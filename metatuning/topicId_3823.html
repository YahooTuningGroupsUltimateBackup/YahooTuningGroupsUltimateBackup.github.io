The day before<br/>his flight to Chicago in late November, the renowned musician had to<br/>leave his home in Aberystwyth at 5.30am for an emergency appointment<br/>at the US Embassy in London.<br/>His last-ditch plea for a visa worked, and he is now touring America,<br/>as he has done so often before. His tale is part of a disturbing<br/>trend caused by the US government&apos;s fight against terrorism, a<br/>squelching of non-American culture. Scores of international<br/>performers have had to cancel appearances since America tightened its<br/>visa rules and security checks this summer.</p><p>Performers and presenters in the US are losing money. The recording<br/>industry will be hampered, say critics of the policy. Labels prefer<br/>to issue CDs when a group is touring. And Americans are being<br/>deprived of cultural communication at a time when it is more crucial<br/>than ever before.</p><p>&apos;This just increases the sense of isolation that&apos;s descending on the<br/>US and shows how much we&apos;re not in synch with the rest of the world,&apos;<br/>says Richard Pena, director of the New York Film Festival.</p><p>In September, Iranian film director Abbas Kiarostami, former winner<br/>of the Cannes Palme d&apos;Or, could not attend the premiere of his latest<br/>film, Ten, at the festival -- even though he had been to the US seven<br/>times previously. As a protest, Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki, one-<br/>time winner of the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes, refused to attend.</p><p>World-famous musicians The Afro-Cuban All Stars recently had to back<br/>out of a tour of sold-out concerts. Two of their members, Ibrahim<br/>Ferrer and Ruben Gonzalez, have worked with the Buena Vista Social<br/>Club. Other Cubans denied visas include famed jazz pianist Chucho<br/>Valdes, rapper X Alfonso and members of Sintesis, some of a startling<br/>total of 22 Cubans who could not attend September&apos;s Latin Grammy<br/>Awards in Miami.</p><p>Havana-based film director Humberto Solas, one of whose films has<br/>been nominated at Cannes, could not attend a film festival tribute to<br/>his work in November. Polo Montanez, whose music is topping the<br/>charts in much of Latin America, had to cancel his US appearances.<br/>Just over a fortnight ago he died in a car crash.</p><p>&apos;Americans will now never see him perform live,&apos; says immigration<br/>lawyer Bill Martinez. He is working with the World Music Institute of<br/>New York which, along with several other cultural organisations, may<br/>soon sue the US State Department for denying &apos;freedom of expression&apos;,<br/>a constitutional right.</p><p>Iranian musician Hussein Alizadeh was only able to join a group of<br/>Iranian performers in the US in October after sympathetic members of<br/>the US Congress intervened. He missed the first nine gigs.</p><p>Nor does working with a household name protect a foreign artiste from<br/>ignominy. Canadian-Iranian instrumentalist Kayhan Kalhor, who<br/>performs with Yo-Yo Ma&apos;s Silk Road Ensemble, was so flustered by<br/>being fingerprinted, photographed and searched that he has vowed<br/>never to return.</p><p>A Canadian citizen, he has lived in New York. But his birthplace,<br/>Iran, marked him. He says the new restrictions amount to harassment<br/>and discrimination.</p><p>Syria and Iran are among the US&apos;s &apos;group of seven&apos;, along with Libya,<br/>Iraq, Sudan, Cuba and North Korea. Another film-maker who could not<br/>attend a festival was Bahman Ghobadi, the Kurdish-Iranian director of<br/>A Time For Drunken Horses, another winner at Cannes. His film<br/>Marooned In Iraq, which purportedly contains a few rants against<br/>Saddam Hussein, came first at the Chicago International Film Festival<br/>in October. Infuriated, he turned down the prize.</p><p>President Bush signed the Enhanced Border Security and Reform Act in<br/>May, which targeted those born in seven countries that the US says<br/>sponsor terrorism, even if they were citizens of another country.</p><p>A second, more extensive, list of suspect countries has been issued,<br/>many of them Muslim, including Pakistan and Indonesia, Saudi Arabia<br/>and Morocco. Since August, anyone applying for a US visa faces more<br/>thorough background checks.</p><p>The classical Artemis Quartet, from Berlin, was forced to cancel a<br/>concert in San Francisco last month after immigration officials found<br/>that its cellist, Eckart Runge, had stolen a pair of tweezers as a<br/>young man in Colorado.</p><p>Three-time Booker Prize nominee Rohinton Mistry, the Canadian<br/>novelist born in India, made front-page news this autumn when he<br/>cancelled a book tour because of humiliating treatment at three US<br/>airports. He said afterwards: &apos;I don&apos;t find this is the random check<br/>that they talk about, not when they happen to have it at every single<br/>stop, every single airport.&apos;</p><p>Even his compatriot Margaret Atwood had difficulty. She had to return<br/>home to come up with more paperwork, missed her flight to the US and<br/>only just arrived in time for her book reading.</p><p>On October 30, Canada issued a rare travel warning to its citizens<br/>visiting America. As of Tuesday this week, crossing the Canadian-US<br/>border becomes even more tricky. All Commonwealth citizens, except<br/>those from the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, must have<br/>visas.</p><p>Denis Coderre, Canada&apos;s minister of citizenship and immigration<br/>blasted the new policy as racial profiling that shows a lack of<br/>confidence in Canada&apos;s new immigration regulations. Less widely know<br/>is that all would-be foreign male visitors to the US aged between 16<br/>and 45 -- but not women -- must now account for every country visited<br/>in the last decade, in case they are terrorists.</p><p>Even members of Burach, the Celtic rock group from Edinburgh, had to<br/>defend their visits to Russia, Turkey and India when they entered the<br/>US in September, according to their US agent Nancy Carlin. The<br/>ultimate impact, she says, is a chilling of cultural communication.<br/>She cites the example of a colleague, the director of a small<br/>festival in Michigan, who now says he will no longer consider non-<br/>American acts. It is just too risky financially, he told Carlin,<br/>especially for a small presenter.<br/>--- End forwarded message ---</p></div>
