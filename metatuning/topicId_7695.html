There<br/>are also plans to develop a mat of sensors that will be used in airports to<br/>test the answers of passengers during questioning.</p><p>The technology, developed by an Israeli high-tech company, uses external<br/>sensors that cause minimum physical discomfort to the person being<br/>interrogated.</p><p>The Technical Support Working Group of the American Homeland Security<br/>authorized a grant of $750,000 earlier this week to fund the project, a<br/>joint venture of the Israeli Atlas and the American Whizsoft. The research<br/>and development stage is expected to be completed in 16 months with a<br/>single prototype that will be tested.</p><p>Atlas, an Israeli R&amp;D company operating since 1977 which specializes in the<br/>analysis of psychophysiological phenomena and their impact, works mostly in<br/>outsourcing functions for medical equipment for both Israeli and foreign<br/>companies, but also for the Defense Ministry.</p><p>Atlas is joining the wave of dual-use technologies whose origins are in<br/>medical treatment and are also being used in the development of anti-terror<br/>equipment.</p><p>According to Gideon Miller, an adviser to Atlas in the project, what is<br/>unique in this project is the ability to process the information in real<br/>time and the ability of the sensors to evaluate from a distance the<br/>condition of the person interrogated</p><p>Great, should be used whenever a politician speaks in public :-)</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=7696 href="#7696">ðŸ”—</a>Dante Rosati &#x3C;dante@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2004 9:15:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/Midwest/06/24/fireworks.shooting.ap/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/Midwest/06/24/fireworks.shooting.ap/index.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=7700 href="#7700">ðŸ”—</a>Charles Lucy &#x3C;16tone@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2004 2:18:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I remember reading somewhere that lie detection could be achieved by analysis of voice stress.<br/>Could this mean that the microtonalists really may hold the &quot;keys&quot; to this technology with our knowledge of pitch and timbre analyses;-)</p><p>Charles Lucy - lucy@...
