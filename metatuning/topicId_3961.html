Certainly, we were<br/>all infidels then, just as we are now.  According to the religion, we<br/>should still be destroyed then, just as now.  Or, why isn&apos;t, say, the<br/>nation of Brazil subject to Islamic war today?  It&apos;s mostly Catholic,<br/>right?  They&apos;re infidels, shouldn&apos;t they die?</p><p>&#x9;So then why are they, today, attacking the US, instead of some<br/>other un-believing nation, at some other time?</p></div><h3><a id=3970 href="#3970">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E; &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/1/2003 7:46:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;So then why are they, today, attacking the US, instead of some<br/>&gt; other un-believing nation, at some other time?</p><p>It is because they now have the ability to obtain powerful weapons, move easily from country to country, and communicate over long distances easily.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
