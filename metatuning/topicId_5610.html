Normally one only writes only to the virtual<br/>pixels, but with sub-pixel rendering the sub-pixels are<br/>exposed to the programmer.  They&apos;re fairly useless for<br/>everything but anti-aliasing small, black curves as found<br/>in text, and AFAIK only things going through the font<br/>renderer use it (not images).</p><p>Are you using Acrobat 6?  In theory you one could recover<br/>every bit of the files you sent me from the pdf.  So<br/>there&apos;s something in your display methodology if the pdf<br/>doesn&apos;t look as good as the bmps.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
