As I said, I hadn&apos;t been much into the Yes material for a long time, but I did have a soft spot for them from my youth, and it was difficult to watch/listen.</p><p>&gt; Steve Howe&apos;s Turbulence with Bill Bruford is a great album.<br/>&gt; I mention that because I&apos;m involved in a prog-rock disscussion<br/>&gt; somewhere else on the net. Turbulence seems to be<br/>&gt; one of the last great prog-rock albums from the Yes gang.</p><p>I don&apos;t know that one! Even though (especially on a list like meta-) we all know each other pretty well, I am careful to not say things like &quot;my favorite part of the group was Bill Bruford&quot;. The stereotypic &quot;the drummer listens to the drummer&quot;, and all that. But it seems to me that of all the members of that band over the years, Bruford has had the most impressive and musical output in the last few decades. Never resting on laurels, usually challenging himself to not merely fill a drummers idea of drumming, and usually finding really interesting musicians to play with. I&apos;d be curious to hear &quot;Turbulence&quot;!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yep, I&apos;ve got that.  It was going around Juilliard in &apos;99.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t listened to the Yellow Shark in a few years, but<br/>&gt; it is one of my fave Zappa albums. Amazing.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll get it out this weekend to try to find the zip of<br/>&gt; rock.</p><p>Well, I *hope* you find zip! I enjoy that a lot, esp since it was so near the end of FZ. BTW, for you guitarists in the audience who also happen to approve of FZ, it has been really a great few years here in San Diego with guitarist Mike Keneally living here. He pops up here and there with (always different) interesting groups of players, and this guy is simply mind-numbing in the depth of his skill on the guitar and the breadth of his musicianship.</p><p>The over-used term: awesome.

Is your friend Larry Groupe?!</p><p>That&apos;s my boy. Larry has been close friends of my wife and I for 20 years, we hang out all the time (she was just recording at Warner Bros. last Friday with Larry conducting a score by Rolfe Kent), and he is one of the great undiscovered commercial composers (well, his heart is in film work) around today. He does a lot of work in Seattle (just saw his name on the conducting work for &quot;About Schmidt&quot;), and I&apos;ve worked in the studio for 2 decades with Larry as the producer on a large production music library. He has the most accurate and fastest set of ears I&apos;ve ever know a person to have in the booth. He can catch the slightest miscue, and can find the one element to add to a mix/arrangement that turns it from pedestrian to ultra.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry. You can tell I like this man like he was my brother, which we sometimes joke that we are!</p><p>(and, along with the Mahler/MIDI thread, Larry is one of those who has mastered the &apos;fake orchestra&apos; in his home studio; I&apos;ve heard him do an orchestral score with all synths/samplers, and then just add maybe clarinet and cello [live] and even though orchs are my business, they come damn close to fooling my ears)</p><p>&gt; They&apos;re sooo burned out, dude.  I don&apos;t consider anything post<br/>&gt; 1978 to be Yes.</p><p>Sure, I understand about burnout. But they should get off the fucking stage then!</p><p>Leave rock and roll to the people that it really means something to, not the over-the-hill clowns who are simply trying to rake in Euros.</p><p>Gad, would someone please kick this soapbox out from under my feet!!!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2003 3:43:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But it seems to me that of all the members of that band over the<br/>&gt;years, Bruford has had the most impressive and musical output in the<br/>&gt;last few decades.

I often wonder about someone like Bruford - he&apos;s the kind of player whose talents don&apos;t fit an easy box, so he has to make avenues for himself. Not all the avenues will pan out, and not all that are good will find commercial or public support, and therefore wither and die.</p><p>If he (or others in his boat) have a killer set of music, but can&apos;t interest promoters or record labels in it, we most likely will never hear of it. One can always self produce, but the chances of people *finding* it are pretty slim. I&apos;ve been surfing hard for a few months, looking for music that inspires me.

The switch<br/>&gt; from Bruford to Alan White occured between ctte and Tales, and<br/>&gt; ctte is the only classic material I know of for which both<br/>&gt; Bruford and White created a drum part, Bruford&apos;s being far<br/>&gt; superior IMO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Outside of his astounding contribution to Relayer (esp. the<br/>&gt; 2nd track), I never thought that much of White.  Bruford is<br/>&gt; one of my favorite drummers... the stream-of-beats style<br/>&gt; showcased in the duet with Squire during the introduction<br/>&gt; buildup to Heart of the Sunrise... the live solo in Perpetual<br/>&gt; Change as heard on YesSongs...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, IMO Wakeman, Moraz and Howe all outstrip Bruford in<br/>&gt; musical output since 1972.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I have the Earthworks album with Towner, and nice, yes, but<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; totally forgettable, even boring.

(Columbia was doing a week of their artist with such mixed bills)  I partically liked Jan Hammers solos as being the most sparse but concise. this band to went down hill fast as it is pretty hard to keep such intensity going.Only Cecil Taylor has managed to hold that type of energy, but he is in a different ballpark. I really really liked<br/>Mahavishnu at the time but am amazed at how badly it has stood the test of time. it is kinda chessey to me now. Miles on the other hand went the other way for me , with the post bitches brew stuff not really me impressing me as much as the time and find it greater with age.
