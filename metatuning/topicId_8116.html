Even chimpanzees, if they<br/>understand lying and truth, can only<br/>do that because of their interactions with<br/>others.</p><p>Though there would be a lot of discussion<br/>about how exactly we learn about it<br/>and whether we have private worlds<br/>as well at all, or whether that is<br/>some kind of illusion (there, I think we<br/>do in some sense but not sure if I<br/>could well argue my case with a seasoned<br/>philosopher who is well up on this<br/>as that can be a bit hard to do if<br/>they really challenge you, - you have<br/>to have your wits about you)</p><p>Then, there is the matter, if we<br/>do have private worlds, what form<br/>do they take and to what extent<br/>can they be shared with others.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So unless you say it also changes<br/>&gt; &gt; the language in which it is written<br/>&gt; &gt; as it goes on (and there is no<br/>&gt; &gt; great advantage in doing that<br/>&gt; &gt; as all computer languages are<br/>&gt; &gt; universal as far as computing is concerned)<br/>&gt; &gt; then that gives you a finite program<br/>&gt; &gt; + data.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.  But it might still be the case that<br/>&gt; G today is no longer G tomorrow.</p><p>Well probably I&apos;ll give up at this<br/>point just because it is too much<br/>hand waving and I&apos;d like to see<br/>what Roger Penrose has said about it,<br/>after all I haven&apos;t spent years<br/>researching this!</p><p>Just that I don&apos;t personally find<br/>it very convincing an idea yet that<br/>there might be some way to program<br/>a computer to get around the limitations<br/>and add in Godel sentences somehow<br/>without doing it using an algorithm<br/>that could be analysed by a human<br/>and used to make a sentence for<br/>the result by meta reasoning about it.<br/>But then not much motivated to look<br/>for ways out of the argument as<br/>I find it convincing, and those<br/>who don&apos;t already find it convincing<br/>are the best ones to challenge it #<br/>I suppose.</p><p>Perhaps we can take this up again<br/>later after I have read his book<br/>and read what he has to say.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2004 10:56:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Robert,</p><p>&gt; &gt; You can say that they understand truth in<br/>&gt; &gt; the same way you can say other humans<br/>&gt; &gt; understand truth: by observing their behavior.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s what a behaviourist might say</p><p>As it happens, I am a behaviourist!</p><p>&gt; If one were brought up with no communications<br/>&gt; with others, one wuold have an undeveloped<br/>&gt; sense of truth like that of an animal<br/>//<br/>&gt; Even chimpanzees, if they<br/>&gt; understand lying and truth, can only<br/>&gt; do that because of their interactions with<br/>&gt; others.</p><p>Communication with others is behavior on<br/>their part, and stimulus for you (and<br/>vice versa, of course).</p><p>&gt; Perhaps we can take this up again<br/>&gt; later after I have read his book<br/>&gt; and read what he has to say.</p><p>Sure.
