International law provides a remedy for just<br/>this behavior, and it is not a preemptive invasion. Instead, the U.N.<br/>Security Council should establish a tribunal for crimes against<br/>humanity by the leaders of Iraq, and move immediately to indict Saddam<br/>and selected others of his Ba&apos;ath Party. This should allow us to focus<br/>on the crimes of the leadership while protecting the lives of the<br/>innocent people of Iraq.</p><p><a href="http://www.actforchange.com">http://www.actforchange.com</a></p></div><h3>kris peck &#x3C;kris.peck@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2003 11:15:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Bailey &lt;chris@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; A beginning to an alternative to war is to call for Saddam Hussein<br/>to be<br/>&gt; indicted for crimes against humanity:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Take action!<br/>&gt; <a href="http://act.actforchange.com/">http://act.actforchange.com/</a></p><p>It is very encouraging to see this!  Up till now I have never seen<br/>any anti-war folks advocating any action whatsoever against Saddam.<br/>The attitude toward SH has seemed to be anywhere from total<br/>disinterest to blatant support in some cases (i.e. Saddam-organized<br/>propaganda tours, human shield volunteers taking orders from Saddam,<br/>etc).  Not saying there hasn&apos;t been anti-Saddam activity, just that<br/>this is the first time *I* have seen it.  Very refreshing, and I hope<br/>this effort gets a lot of exposure.</p></div>
