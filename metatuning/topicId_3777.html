<a href="/metatuning">back to list</a><h1>a simple and cohesive explanation</h1><h3>X. J. Scott &#x3C;xjscott@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2002 12:20:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My detractors claim that I -- Jeff Scott -- am a racist. Yet this cannot be<br/>correct, since Islam is a multinational belief system, not confined to one<br/>single race.</p><p>My detractors claim that I am mentally ill -- yet this cannot be case, since<br/>I am merely citing documented facts.</p><p>My detractors claim that all my quoting is a lie, yet this cannot be true<br/>because it&apos;s simple and easy to check my quotes and verify that they are in<br/>fact a documented printed record of what is currently being written in the<br/>mainstream Islamic press.</p><p>So all the claims of my opponents fall apart on examination. They make no<br/>sense. They are completely self-contradictory -- I am insane yet I am so<br/>cleverly clear-minded that I deceive people with my diabolically slanted<br/>scholarship.</p><p>I&apos;m a bigot but I&apos;m not a bigot because I am discussing the belief system of<br/>Islam, not any particular racial group.</p><p>I&apos;m full of hate but I&apos;m not full of hate because I merely cite documented<br/>facts and ask what a sensible person concludes beyond a reasonable doubt<br/>from the preponderenace of the evidence.</p><p>Against these incoherent and self-contradictory arguments, I have a simple<br/>and elegant and irresistabilty powerful argument: people who urge the murder<br/>of innocents for reasons of religious belief are morally bankrupt, and<br/>people who tell repeated lies in public in a futile effort to defend such<br/>morally bankrupt Islamic true believers are themselves morally bankrupt, and<br/>the facts prove this beyond a reasonable doubt. Murdering or calling for the<br/>murder of innocent people is proof of moral bankruptcy. Telling repeated<br/>lies in public is proof of moral bankruptcy.</p><p>Therefore the liars support Islamic murderers precisely because the liars<br/>are morally bankrupt -- birds of a feather flock together.</p><p>This explains simply and clearly why the liars lie (because they have rotten<br/>moral character) and it also explains why they try to defend people who call<br/>for the murder of all unbelievers and the genocidal deaths of innocent women<br/>and children and old men (because they have rotten moral character).</p><p>The liars defend Islamic murderers for the same reason that Tony Lo Bianco<br/>defended his cousin&apos;s rape and murder of innocent women -- because they have<br/>rotten moral character. They do not care about the difference between right<br/>and wrong. They are, in a word, sociopaths with no concern for others and no<br/>ability to empathize with other people and no concern for the consequences<br/>of their actions.</p><p>A person who tells repeated lies in public engages in sociopathic behavior,<br/>just as a person who urges the cold-blooded murder of innocent women and<br/>children merely because they believe in a different religion also engages in<br/>sociopathic behavior.</p><p>Is it any surprise that one sociopath defends another?</p><p>How could it be otherwise?</p><p>If one sociopath condemns another sociopath for his sociopathic behavior, it<br/>opens the door for others to condemn him for his own sociopathic behavior,<br/>does it not?</p><p>Therefore we would expect that people who do sociopathic things like tell<br/>repeated lies in public would desperately try to defend Islamic clerics who<br/>do sociopathic things like call for the death of all unbelievers -- for the<br/>alternative would require that we examine and deplore the sociopathic<br/>behavior of the liar, isn&apos;t that obvious?  After all, once we begin<br/>examining and deploring one kind of sociopathic behavior, who knows where it<br/>will stop? And this poses a deadly danger for the sociopathic liar, does it<br/>not?</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
