Bush, on the second anniversary of the terrorist attack on America, was hailed by chiefs of state throughout the world.  Mr. Bush announced that after, &quot;two years of bloodshed, economic devastation, and spreading fear in America and abroad,&quot; he saw no choice but to accept that, &quot;I have held a title which I did not win, and for which I have proven unqualified.&quot;</p><p>The text of the former President&apos;s September 11 address to the nation<br/>follows:</p><p>&quot;My fellow Americans:</p><p>I come to you tonight with a heavy heart.  Two years ago today,<br/>thousands of innocent Americans were murdered by terrorist maniacs.</p><p>In the script I&apos;ve been handed, I&apos;m now supposed to tell you that<br/>America is safer today, and that the world is kinder and nicer and<br/>happier, because of I&apos;m such a brilliant general in the War on Terror.</p><p>But who are we kidding? Yesterday, Osama released his new hit video.<br/>The terrorists are having a picnic ever since I turned over our foreign policy to Saudi Arabia and Exxon-Mobil.</p><p>And here&apos;s the point in my speech where my handlers would have me tell you about how I&apos;ve been praying hard, making it sound like I just got off the phone with the Lord.  I don&apos;t know about you, but I find it pretty darn offensive, downright blasphemous, to drag the Lord&apos;s name into every cheap campaign speech and chest-pounding war threat.  Osama says he talks to God too.  Let&apos;s leave Him out of the politics from now on, OK?</p><p>Look, in my speech this past Sunday, I used the word &quot;democracy&quot; about 11 times when talking about Iraq.   It&apos;s democracy Florida-style, I suppose.  Except we&apos;re not fixing the vote this time ... we aren&apos;t letting these people vote at all.  &quot;Iraqis aren&apos;t prepared for<br/>democracy.&quot;  That&apos;s what Dick Cheney and Saddam Hussein told me.</p><p>So we&apos;re blowing 100 billion bucks we don&apos;t have to colonize a country we don&apos;t want.  Rummy tries to explain it to me each morning -- oil this and oil that -- but I just don&apos;t see it. And one of our kids dying there every day - where are their parents, anyway?  My dad didn&apos;t let that happen - he got me out of the service.  Didn&apos;t I look neat in that fly-boy suit?</p><p>And, let me tell you, I just looked at our nation&apos;s piggy bank.  Uh-oh.</p><p>When I arrived, the last guy left me $4 trillion and said, &quot;Be<br/>careful with all that cash in this neighborhood.&quot;  Well, I have to level with you, America:  it&apos;s all gone.  The cupboard&apos;s bare and this year alone we blew half a trillion more dollars than we have in our bank account. Man, I can&apos;t believe I went through all that dough stone sober.</p><p>And what did we get for it?  A Fatherland Security Department that&apos;s<br/>trying to read the labels on everyone&apos;s underpants.  Think about it,<br/>all this Total Information Awareness KGB stuff:  two years ago<br/>Americans were the victims - but my government has made Americans the<br/>suspects.  I don&apos;t know about you, but this guy Ashcroft scares the<br/>bejeezus out of me.</p><p>And today I&apos;m told that over nine million Americans are out of work.<br/>That&apos;s not so bad:   I haven&apos;t done much work in my lifetime either.<br/>But my mama explained to me that not everyone&apos;s daddy can lend them an oil well to tide them over.</p><p>It&apos;s like I can&apos;t get anything right. The lights are going out in Ohio and the North Pole is melting. I don&apos;t get it.  I appointed all those regulators that Ken Lay told me to, and I got rid of all the rules that got in the way of patriotic Polluter-Americans .... and what&apos;s the upshot? America the Beautiful is looking like she&apos;s had a pretty rough night.  Won&apos;t be long before the whole country smells like Houston.</p><p>And now the stock market&apos;s floating face down in the swimming pool --<br/>despite everything I&apos;ve done for those guys on Wall Street. Even my<br/>plan to give every millionaire an extra million seems to have<br/>backfired.  Greenspam says I&apos;ve created &quot;business risk.&quot;  Says I spook investors.

I&apos;ve gotten all their<br/>resignations today.  And while I&apos;ve got some character left, here&apos;s my own good-bye note too. Let&apos;s face it:  I have held a title which I did not win, and for which I have proven unqualified.  You know it.
