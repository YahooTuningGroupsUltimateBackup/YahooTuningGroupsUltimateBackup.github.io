I don&apos;t think this list<br/>existed before the 2001 break, though I did post political<br/>views on the tuning list a few times.  The views I&apos;ve expressed<br/>here recently are ones I&apos;ve held for years before I joined<br/>these lists, and are hardly unique to me.  They owe something<br/>to libertarian and individualist thinkers such as Jefferson,<br/>Emerson, etc. etc., and a somewhat greater debt to Classic<br/>Eastern/Greek philosophy (see microwave for comments on the<br/>correspondence here).  And I suppose similarities could be<br/>found in some of Jesus&apos; parables, as well as in the metacritical<br/>tendency of the French postmodern thinkers.  Then again, it&apos;s<br/>roundly possible to find similarities between any two works of<br/>hortatory philosophy.  I would venture that if you think my<br/>statements are nonsensical, you&apos;ve misunderstood them.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=7479 href="#7479">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2004 5:47:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; About not voting...That&apos;s your right....at least it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; benefits no one and hurts no one.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;On the contrary, it benefits all mankind by reducing the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;power of government.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; How does it reduce the power of government?

Perhaps all I can suggest is, maybe<br/>10 years from now, look back over some of the difficult exchanges<br/>you&apos;ve had with some members of our community since your return to<br/>the tuning list. Maybe you&apos;ll be as baffled by the things you said as<br/>others were at the time you said them. But maybe not. Anyway, I&apos;m<br/>sincerely sorry for what I said and still think you&apos;re posting an<br/>awful lot of intelligent stuff, so keep it up.</p></div>
