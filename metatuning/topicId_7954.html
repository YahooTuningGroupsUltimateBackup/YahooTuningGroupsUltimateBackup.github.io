But I was intrigued that just last week composer Larry Polansky came to Bard and showed me a piece of software he had devised that finds the perfect temperament for any musical situation. Its format was pretty similar to Belief-O-Matic. First you specify how many pitches you want per octave, then what intervals you want to use (in cents). Then you prioritize (using numbers from 0 to 10) how important each interval is, and then prioritize which keys you want to play in. Say, if you put 386 cents as the most important interval, and 702 as second most important, and mark C, G, D, and A as the most important keys (or something like that, you know what I mean and I&acirc;m not going to look it up), you get something very similar to Werckmeister III. If you prioritize all the keys equally, you get an equal temperament. Maybe this is old hat for some of you. But I&acirc;ve always found tuning curiously analogous to astrology anyway (12 keys = 12 signs, consonant and dissonant intervals = easy and difficult aspects), and I was intrigued that you could calculate the perfect temperament on the same kind of form that you could also use to calculate the perfect religion. Just as I find it revealing that the same people who reject the culturally dominant tuning also reject the culturally dominant religions, the official explanations of 9-11, etc.</p><p>Maybe the next step is to correlate what tuning goes best with what religion. %^D</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3>Aaron K.

I did a quick search and come up with a small routine from<br/>one of his classes that I think was for SuperCollider, which I believe<br/>is a Mac only solution.
