The only way<br/>&gt;   I can get the timing right is by accident.</p><p>I am *beyond* certain I could get you to master this in very little<br/>time - 3 against 2 is the easiest hemiola or cross-rhythm to teach. I<br/>simply need to know exactly what you are asking. For instance:</p><p>- straight quarter notes in the left hand (bass clef)<br/>- quarter note triplets in the right hand (treble clef)</p><p>If you will just identify the two rhythms as to what notes they<br/>constitute (note that you said you &quot;have a triplet in the G clef&quot; but<br/>you don&apos;t say whether it is a quarter, half, or eight triplets.</p><p>It sounds as though your reading is rudimentary, but reading music is<br/>a skill that anyone can learn, and is unfortunately one of those<br/>skills in life that depends on spending time doing it, in a slow and<br/>methodical manner. Since I&apos;ve been playing music since I was 8 years<br/>old, and have been doing it professionally for 30, you think the<br/>mystery would be over. But I&apos;m a dedicated teacher, and work with<br/>students of all ages, at all skill levels, on just these subjects.<br/>Even a skill like sight-reading can wax and wane, depending on how<br/>much you&apos;ve been doing. When I was doing a lot of studio work, you<br/>really never knew what would come in the door and have to be virtually<br/>sight-read correctly at the drop of a hat. I always kept a stack of<br/>various books - violin, flute, guitar, etc - piled up next to my<br/>marimba, and would sight-read an hour a day if I could spend it. The<br/>main goal is to *never* go back over something, but to really &quot;read it<br/>at sight&quot; - take it at a slow enough tempo that you could read the<br/>notes and rhythms 100% correct. Not glamorous, but it works.</p><p>I&apos;m not kidding, Stephen - 2:3 is one you can learn with both a<br/>counting scheme and practice. For anyone who is advanced, there is a<br/>great book on polyrhythms (with a CD of the examples) by Pete Magadini.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=10723 href="#10723">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/17/2006 1:21:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;   My problem at the moment is this.

On the other hand, if a mistake in the<br/>rhythm is made, everyone immediately feels that something<br/>is wrong. Most music has some type of &quot;flow&quot; to it, in time,<br/>and when that sense of flow is interrupted it is usually<br/>a jarring listening experience.</p><p>Of course there are aspects of both types of sensory<br/>response which are relevant for both aspects of music,<br/>but in general i think this is correct.</p><p>-monz</p></div>
