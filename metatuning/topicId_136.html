We have decided<br/>it is off topic for the group, and belongs to metatuning.</p><p>&gt; OK yes I really should have said &apos;irrationals *include*<br/>&gt; transcendental numbers&apos;.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; And imaginary and complex numbers can be irrational or<br/>&gt; rational I suppose: 3i vs 2i/3 + 1/4.</p><p>Yes they can.</p><p>In fact Galois theory (is all<br/>to do with starting with the rational complex numbers,<br/>then adding in irrational numbers such as square roots<br/>one at a time, each time adding in at the same time<br/>all multiples of the new number by the numbers already there<br/>inverses of it, negative vrsion of it and so on, to complete<br/>the resulting &quot;field&quot; under all the arithmetical operations.</p><p>2i/3 + 1/4. is same as (8i + 3)/12, so if one thinks<br/>of 8i + 3 as a kind of complex integer, this is a complex<br/>rational.</p><p>You can also do things like find (3 + 8i)/(11 - 5i)</p><p>Multiply top and bottom by (11 + 5i) and you will get rid<br/>of the imaginary part in the quotient:<br/>(11 + 5i) (11 - 5i) = 121 -25 * (i)^2<br/>= 146, so after multiplying out the top as well, using i^2= -1<br/>you will end up with a complex number with rational coefficients<br/>again.</p><p>So, complex numbers with rational coefficients are &quot;closed&quot;<br/>under all the usual arithmetic operations - when you apply<br/>any of them, result will again be a complex number with rational<br/>coefficients.</p><p>Galois theory is used to show that certain things can&apos;t be<br/>done with ruler and compass. Basic idea is, start with<br/>the rational complex numbers. Considering them as coordinates<br/>they give you all geometrical points with rational coordinates<br/>= all the points one can construct using a ruler alone using<br/>traditional Euclidean methods, and two points.</p><p>Now add in constructions involving circles, and one finds<br/>this is equivalent to being able to find the square root<br/>of any of the complex numbers constructed so far.</p><p>Now take one of thc classic ruler and compass problems from<br/>antiquitey, e.g. to trisect 60 degrees using ruler and<br/>compass.</p><p>With a lot of rather advanced algebra,<br/>one can prove that this point isn&apos;t any of the ones<br/>you get by using rational coordinates + adding in the<br/>square root construction. So it can&apos;t be constructed<br/>using the standard Euclidean methods of ruler and<br/>compass construction.</p><p>It can be constructed using other methods of deploying<br/>the rulers and compasses, and some people think they have<br/>found a counter example by doing this, but these extended<br/>geometrical ways of making the points were already known<br/>to the Greeks, so it is nothing new.</p><p>Same method applies for the other classic problem of<br/>doubling the volume of a cube, and what was the third<br/>one, I forget now.</p><p>&gt; Not sure if imaginary numbers are or are not<br/>&gt; transcendental. Graham says &quot;A transcendental number<br/>&gt; can&apos;t be the solution of a polynomial equation of<br/>&gt; integers.&quot; which if that is a sort of definition<br/>&gt; would separate the two since complex numbers obviously can<br/>&gt; be soch a solution.</p><p>To state it more completely, a transcendental number<br/>can&apos;t be the solution of a polynomial equation with rational<br/>coefficients (or one could also say, a polynonial equation<br/>with integer coefficients here, as one can multiply through<br/>by the least common multiple of all the quotients to get<br/>integer coefficients).</p><p>Some complex numbers are solutions of polynomial equations<br/>with rational coefficients. Others aren&apos;t. So you get<br/>rational, irrational, and transcendental complex numbers,<br/>just as you do for real numbers. (Here, &quot;real&quot; = math<br/>jargon for number with no imaginary part to it, i.e.<br/>ordinary non complex number).</p><p>Rest was about things Graham was explaining, so leave it to<br/>him!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
