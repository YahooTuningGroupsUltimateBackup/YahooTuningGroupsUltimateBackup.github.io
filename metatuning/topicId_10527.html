It is not so &quot;well-known&quot; and it only has a<br/>&gt;percentage of truth.  Surely, Israel (correct spelling in English) would<br/>&gt;have<br/>&gt;preferred an alternative to Hamas.  Sounds like a lot of rationalization &gt;to<br/>&gt;believe<br/>&gt;Israel &quot;supported&quot; Hamas.<br/>&gt;</p><p>No, I think they literally sent money to them, etc.,  because they thought it would be easier to demonize a radical religious orgainzation,  than a more rational secular one (the PLO).</p><p>Just google:  &quot;israel supported hamas&quot;  and you&apos;ll find plenty of links.</p><p>Everybody is learning the lessons of blowback.  When do the ends justify the means?</p></div>
