Bush and the<br/>war in Iraq. He wants it to be remembered as the first big-audience,<br/>election-year film that helped unseat a president.</p><p>&quot;And it&apos;s not just a hope,&quot; the Oscar-winning filmmaker said in a phone<br/>interview last week, describing focus groups in Michigan in April at which,<br/>after seeing the movie, previously undecided voters expressed eagerness to<br/>defeat Bush.</p><p>&quot;We found that if you entered the theater on the fence, you fell off it<br/>somewhere during those two hours,&quot; he said. &quot;It ignites a fire in people who<br/>had given up.&quot; The movie&apos;s indictment of Bush is nothing if not sprawling.<br/>Moore suggests that Bush and his administration jeopardized national<br/>security in an effort to placate Bush family cronies in Saudi Arabia, that<br/>the White House helped members of Osama bin Laden&apos;s family to flee the<br/>United States after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and that the<br/>administration manipulated terrorism alert levels to scare Americans into<br/>supporting the invasion of Iraq.</p><p>Moore&apos;s previous films generated a cottage industry of conservative<br/>commentators eager to prove sloppiness and exaggeration in his films; a<br/>handful of mainstream critics have also found flaws. But if &quot;Fahrenheit<br/>9/11&quot; attracts the audience Moore and his distributors are predicting, Moore<br/>may face an onslaught of fact-checking unlike anything he - or any other<br/>documentary filmmaker - has ever experienced. After all, White House<br/>officials and the Bush family began impugning the film even before any of<br/>them had seen it.</p><p>So how will Moore&apos;s movie stand up under close examination? Is the film&apos;s<br/>depiction of Bush as a lazy and duplicitous leader, blinded by his family&apos;s<br/>financial ties to Arab moneymen and the Saudi Arabian royal family, true to<br/>fact? Moore and his distributors refused to circulate copies of the film and<br/>its script before the film&apos;s release on Friday; his production team said<br/>recently there was no final script because the film was still undergoing<br/>minor editing - for clarity, they said, not accuracy.</p><p>After a year spent covering the U.S. commission investigating the Sept. 11<br/>attacks, I was recently allowed to attend a Hollywood screening. Based on<br/>that single viewing, and after separating out what is clearly presented as<br/>Moore&apos;s opinion from what is stated as fact, it seems safe to say that<br/>central assertions of fact in &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; are supported by the public<br/>record.</p><p>Moore is on firm ground in arguing that the Bushes, like many prominent<br/>Texas families with oil interests, have profited handsomely from their<br/>relationships with prominent Saudis, including members of the royal family<br/>and of the large and fabulously wealthy bin Laden clan, which has insisted<br/>it long ago disowned Osama.</p><p>Moore spends several minutes in the film documenting ties between the<br/>president and James Bath, a financial adviser to a prominent member of the<br/>bin Laden family who was an original investor in Bush&apos;s Arbusto energy<br/>company and who served with the future president in the Air National Guard<br/>in the early 1970s. The Bath friendship, which indirectly links Bush to the<br/>family of the world&apos;s most notorious terrorist, has been well documented.</p><p>Moore charges that Bush and his aides paid too little attention to warnings<br/>in the summer of 2001 that Al Qaeda was about to attack, including a<br/>detailed Aug. 6, 2001, CIA briefing that warned of terrorism within the<br/>United States. In its final report next month, the Sept. 11 commission can<br/>be expected to offer support to this assertion. Moore says that instead of<br/>focusing on Al Qaeda, the president spent 42 percent of his first eight<br/>months in office on vacation; the figure came not from a conspiracy-hungry<br/>Web site but from a calculation by The Washington Post. The most valid<br/>criticisms of the film are likely to involve the artful way that Moore<br/>connects the facts, and whether he has left out others that might undermine<br/>his scalding attack. A great many statistics fly by in the movie - like<br/>assertions that 6 percent to 7 percent of America is owned by Saudi<br/>Arabians, and that Saudi companies have paid more than $1.4 billion to Bush<br/>family interests. Moore and his team say they have news reports and other<br/>evidence to back up the numbers, and that it will be posted on his site,<br/><a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com">www.michaelmoore.com</a>, after the release of the documentary. Moore may also<br/>be criticized for the way he portrays the evacuation of the extended bin<br/>Laden family from the United States after Sept. 11. As the Sept. 11<br/>commission has found, the Saudi government was able to pull strings at<br/>senior levels of the Bush administration to help the bin Ladens leave the<br/>United States. But while the film clearly suggests that the flights occurred<br/>at a time when all air traffic was grounded immediately after the attacks<br/>(&quot;Even Ricky Martin couldn&apos;t fly,&quot; Moore says over video of the singer<br/>wandering in an airport lobby), the Sept. 11 commission said in a report<br/>this April that there was &quot;no credible evidence that any chartered flights<br/>of Saudi Arabian nationals departed the United States before the reopening<br/>of national airspace,&quot; and that the FBI had concluded that no one aboard the<br/>flights was involved in Sept. 11.</p><p>Moore defended the scene, saying his goal was to show how the White House<br/>was eager to bend and break the rules for Saudi friends, in this case the<br/>extended family of the terrorist who had just brought down the twin towers<br/>of the World Trade Center and attacked the Pentagon. And as reporters have<br/>found, the White House still refuses to document fully how the flights were<br/>arranged. &quot;I don&apos;t want to get lost in the forest because of a single tree,&quot;<br/>Moore said. &quot;The main point I want people to go away with is that these<br/>people got special treatment because they were bin Ladens or Saudi royals,<br/>and you and I would never have been given that treatment.&quot;</p><p>Moore is readying for a conservative counterattack, saying he has created a<br/>&quot;war room&quot; to offer an instant response to any assault on the film&apos;s<br/>credibility. He has retained Chris Lehane, a Democratic Party strategist<br/>known as a master of the black art of &quot;oppo,&quot; or opposition research, used<br/>to discredit detractors. He also hired outside fact-checkers, led by a<br/>former general counsel of The New Yorker and a veteran member of that<br/>magazine&apos;s legendary fact-checking team, to vet the film. And he is<br/>threatening to go one step further, saying he has consulted with lawyers who<br/>can bring defamation suits against anyone who maligns the film or damages<br/>his reputation. &quot;Any attempts to libel me will be met by force,&quot; Moore said.<br/>&quot;The most important thing we have is truth on our side. If they persist in<br/>telling lies, knowingly telling a lie with malice, then I&apos;ll take them to<br/>court.&quot;</p><p>Joanne Doroshow, a public interest lawyer and filmmaker who shared in a 1993<br/>Oscar for documentaries and who joined the fact-checking effort last month,<br/>said, &quot;We have gone through every single word of this film - literally every<br/>word - and verified its accuracy.&quot; That said, Moore&apos;s fact-checkers said<br/>they did not view the film as straight reporting. &quot;This is an Op-Ed piece,<br/>it&apos;s not a news report,&quot; said Dev Chatillon, the former general counsel for<br/>The New Yorker, adding, &quot;The facts have to be right, yes, but this is an<br/>individual&apos;s view of current events. And I&apos;m a very firm believer that it is<br/>within everybody&apos;s right to examine the actions of their government.&quot;</p><p>Besides, it may turn out that the most talked-about moments in the film are<br/>the least impeachable. For the White House, the most devastating segment of<br/>&quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; may be the video of a befuddled-looking Bush staying put<br/>for nearly seven minutes at a Florida elementary school on the morning of<br/>Sept. 11, continuing to read a copy of &quot;My Pet Goat&quot; to schoolchildren even<br/>after an aide has told him that a second plane has struck the twin towers.</p><p>Bush&apos;s slow, hesitant reaction to the disastrous news has never been a<br/>secret. But seeing the actual footage, with the minutes ticking by, may<br/>prove more damaging to the White House than all the statistics in the world.</p></div>
