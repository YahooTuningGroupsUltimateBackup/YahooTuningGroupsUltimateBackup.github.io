The reasons<br/>are plain. Eighty six per cent of you say ID cards<br/>would help police fight crime, 77 per cent reckon it<br/>would help identify illegal immigrants and 60 per cent<br/>claim it would help prevent terrorism.</p><p>Former Tory Home Secretary Michael Howard&apos;s plans for a<br/>voluntary ID card were scrapped after pressure from<br/>civil liberties groups.</p><p>But our poll reveals opposition has crumbled. Just 22<br/>                     -----------------------<br/>per cent believed ID cards infringed a person&apos;s<br/>freedom.</p><p>But there is also an overwhelming call for the cards to<br/>be packed with information to clearly identify the<br/>   -----------------------<br/>holder.</p><p>These include photograph (97 per cent), date of birth<br/>(96 per cent) eye colour (92 per cent), a finger print<br/>                                          ------------<br/>(85 per cent), DNA details (75 per cent), criminal<br/>               -----------<br/>records (74 per cent) and religion (67 per cent).
