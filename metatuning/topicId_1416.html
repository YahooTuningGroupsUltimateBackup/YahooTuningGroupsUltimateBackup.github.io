They want money to tell you the other two<br/>&gt; bits.</p><p>I ended up being an ENFP - here are the broad and then detailed<br/>descriptions; I can live with them:</p><p>The Idealist Portrait<br/>All Idealists (NFs) share the following core characteristics:</p><p>Idealists are enthusiastic, they trust their intuition, yearn for<br/>romance, seek their true self, prize meaningful relationships, and<br/>dream of attaining wisdom. Idealists  pride themselves on being<br/>loving, kindhearted, and authentic. Idealists tend to be giving,<br/>trusting, spiritual, and they are focused on personal journeys and<br/>human potentials. Idealists make intense mates, nurturing parents,<br/>and inspirational leaders.</p><p>Idealists, as a temperament, are passionately concerned with personal<br/>growth and development. Idealists strive to discover who they are and<br/>how they can become their best possible self--always this quest for<br/>self-knowledge and self-improvement drives their imagination. And<br/>they want to help others make the journey. Idealists are naturally<br/>drawn to working with people, and whether in education or counseling,<br/>in social services or personnel work, in journalism or the ministry,<br/>they are gifted at helping others find their way in life, often<br/>inspiring them to grow as individuals and to fulfill their potentials.</p><p>Idealists are rare, making up no more than 8 to 10 percent of the<br/>population. But their ability to inspire people with their enthusiasm<br/>and their idealism has given them influence far beyond their<br/>numbers.</p><p>Idealist Portrait of the Champion (ENFP)</p><p>Like the other Idealists, Champions are rather rare, say two or three<br/>percent of the population, but even more than the others they<br/>consider intense emotional experiences as being vital to a full life.<br/>Champions have a wide range and variety of emotions, and a great<br/>passion for novelty. They see life as an exciting drama, pregnant<br/>with possibilities for both good and evil, and they want to<br/>experience all the meaningful events and fascinating people in the<br/>world. The most outgoing of the Idealists, Champions often can&apos;t wait<br/>to tell others of their extraordinary experiences. Champions can be<br/>tireless in talking with others, like fountains that bubble and<br/>splash, spilling over their own words to get it all out. And usually<br/>this is not simple storytelling; Champions often speak (or write) in<br/>the hope of revealing some truth about human experience, or of<br/>motivating others with their powerful convictions. Their strong drive<br/>to speak out on issues and events, along with their boundless<br/>enthusiasm and natural talent with language, makes them the most<br/>vivacious and inspiring of all the types.</p><p>Fiercely individualistic, Champions strive toward a kind of personal<br/>authenticity, and this intention always to be themselves is usually<br/>quite attractive to others. At the same time, Champions have<br/>outstanding intuitive powers and can tell what is going on inside of<br/>others, reading hidden emotions and giving special significance to<br/>words or actions. In fact, Champions are constantly scanning the<br/>social environment, and no intriguing character or silent motive is<br/>likely to escape their attention. Far more than the other Idealists,<br/>Champions are keen and probing observers of the people around them,<br/>and are capable of intense concentration on another individual. Their<br/>attention is rarely passive or casual. On the contrary, Champions<br/>tend to be extra sensitive and alert, always ready for emergencies,<br/>always on the lookout for what&apos;s possible.</p><p>Champions are good with people and usually have a wide range of<br/>personal relationships. They are warm and full of energy with their<br/>friends. They are likeable and at ease with colleagues, and handle<br/>their employees or students with great skill. They are good in public<br/>and on the telephone, and are so spontaneous and dramatic that others<br/>love to be in their company. Champions are positive, exuberant<br/>people, and often their confidence in the goodness of life and of<br/>human nature makes good things happen.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=1420 href="#1420">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2002 12:51:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: clumma &lt;carl@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Thursday, January 10, 2002 10:49 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] My personality type<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The &quot;MBTI&quot; system, and related Keirsey system, group<br/>&gt; personalities into 16 types, using four bits, as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Extraversion-Introversion (E or I)<br/>&gt; Sensing-iNtuition (S or N)<br/>&gt; Thinking-Feeling (T or F)<br/>&gt; Judging-Perceiving (J or P)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; According to two inventory tests at: <a href="http://www.keirsey.com/">http://www.keirsey.com/</a>, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; an &quot;Idealist&quot; (NT).

Healers<br/>&gt;&gt; present a seemingly tranquil, and noticiably pleasant<br/>&gt;&gt; face to the world, and though to all appearances they<br/>&gt;&gt; might seem reserved, and even shy, on the inside they<br/>&gt;&gt; are anything but reserved, having a capacity for caring<br/>&gt;&gt; not always found in other types. They care deeply-indeed,<br/>&gt;&gt; passionately-about a few special persons or a favorite<br/>&gt;&gt; cause, and their fervent aim is to bring peace and<br/>&gt;&gt; integrity to their loved ones and the world.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Healers have a profound sense of idealism derived from a<br/>&gt;&gt; strong personal morality, and they conceive of the world<br/>&gt;&gt; as an ethical, honorable place. Indeed, to understand<br/>&gt;&gt; iNFps, we must understand their idealism as almost boundless<br/>&gt;&gt; and selfless, inspiring them to make extraordinary sacrifices<br/>&gt;&gt; for someone or something they believe in. The iNFp is the<br/>&gt;&gt; Prince or Princess of fairytale, the King&apos;s Champion or<br/>&gt;&gt; Defender of the Faith, like Sir Galahad or Joan of Arc.<br/>&gt;&gt; Healers are found in only 1 percent of the general<br/>&gt;&gt; population, although, at times, their idealism leaves<br/>&gt;&gt; them feeling even more isolated from the rest of humanity.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=1425 href="#1425">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2002 1:11:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Your Type is INFP<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Introverted Intuitive Feeling Perceiving<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Strength of the preferences %<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 22 78 11 44</p><p>My numbers were approximately 50 100 50 100.</p></div><h3><a id=1426 href="#1426">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2002 1:14:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In metatuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Your Type is INFP<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Introverted Intuitive Feeling Perceiving<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Strength of the preferences %<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 22 78 11 44<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My numbers were approximately 50 100 50 100.</p><p>Well, not really . . . what I meant is that I came out about halfway<br/>between &quot;Introverted&quot; and &quot;Extroverted&quot;, very much &quot;Intuitive&quot; rather<br/>than &quot;Sensing&quot;, about halfway between &quot;Feeling&quot; and &quot;Thinking&quot;, and<br/>very much &quot;Perceiving&quot; rather than &quot;Judging&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=1427 href="#1427">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2002 2:12:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: paulerlich &lt;paul@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, January 11, 2002 1:14 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] Re: My personality type<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; --- In metatuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In metatuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Your Type is INFP<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Introverted Intuitive Feeling Perceiving<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Strength of the preferences %<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 22 78 11 44<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My numbers were approximately 50 100 50 100.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, not really . . . what I meant is that I came out about halfway<br/>&gt; between &quot;Introverted&quot; and &quot;Extroverted&quot;, very much &quot;Intuitive&quot; rather<br/>&gt; than &quot;Sensing&quot;, about halfway between &quot;Feeling&quot; and &quot;Thinking&quot;, and<br/>&gt; very much &quot;Perceiving&quot; rather than &quot;Judging&quot;.</p><p>So then the conclusion is that you and I are quite similar<br/>personality types?
