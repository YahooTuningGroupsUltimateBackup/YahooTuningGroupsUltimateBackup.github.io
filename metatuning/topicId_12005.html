It really does seem to be an &apos;intelligent<br/>organism&apos;, on a certain level.</p><p>I&apos;m amazed to see some of the close calls in this clip. It seems that<br/>everyone is just extra aware of what&apos;s happening. But I wonder what<br/>the accident statistics are. It seems &apos;safe&apos;, if a bit scary, from<br/>these clips, but I&apos;d be willing to bet more people die b/c there are<br/>no stop signs or lights...I&apos;d love to be proven wrong, though, that<br/>would be *cool* that _utter chaos_ is SAFER!!!!!</p><p>-AKJ</p></div>
