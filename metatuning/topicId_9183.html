Denise decided to stay with her mother,<br/>her niece and grandniece (who is 2 years old); she<br/>figured they&apos;d be safe at the hospital. they went to<br/>Baptist, and had to wait hours to be assigned a room<br/>to sleep in; after they were finally assigned a<br/>room, two white nurses suddenly arrived after the cut-off<br/>time (time to be assigned a room), and Denise and<br/>her family were booted out; their room was given up to<br/>the new nurses. Denise was furious, and rather than stay<br/>at Baptist, decided to walk home (several blocks away)<br/>to ride out the storm at her mother&apos;s apartment. her<br/>mother stayed at the hospital.</p><p>she described it as the scariest time in her life. 3<br/>of the rooms in the apartment (there are only 4)<br/>caved in. ceilings caved in, walls caved in. she huddled<br/>under a mattress in the hall. she thought she would<br/>die from either the storm or a heart attack. after<br/>the storm passed, she went back to Baptist to seek<br/>shelter (this was Monday). it was also scary at Baptist; the<br/>electricity was out, they were running on<br/>generators, there was no air conditioning. Tuesday the levees<br/>broke, and water began rising. they moved patients<br/>upstairs, saw boats pass by on what used to be<br/>streets. they were told that they would be<br/>evacuated, that buses were coming. then they were told they<br/>would have to walk to the nearest intersection, Napoleon<br/>and S. Claiborne, to await the buses. they waded out in<br/>hip-deep water, only to stand at the intersection,<br/>on the neutral ground (what y&apos;all call the median) for 3 1/2 hours. the buses came and took them to the<br/>Ernest Memorial Convention Center. (yes, the convention<br/>center you&apos;ve all seen on TV.)</p><p>Denise said she thought she was in hell. they were<br/>there for 2 days, with no water, no food. no shelter.<br/>Denise, her mother (63 years old), her niece (21<br/>years old), and 2-year-old grandniece. when they arrived,<br/>there were already thousands of people there. they<br/>were told that buses were coming. police drove by,<br/>windows rolled up, thumbs up signs. national guard<br/>trucks rolled by, completely empty, soldiers with guns<br/>cocked and aimed at them. nobody stopped to drop off<br/>water. a helicopter dropped a load of water, but all<br/>the bottles exploded on impact due to the height of<br/>the helicopter.</p><p>the first day (Wednesday) 4 people died next to her.<br/>the second day (Thursday) 6 people died next to her.<br/>Denise told me the people around her all thought<br/>they had been sent there to die. again, nobody stopped.<br/>the only buses that came were full; they dropped off<br/>more and more people, but nobody was being picked up and<br/>taken away. they found out that those being dropped<br/>off had been rescued from rooftops and attics; they<br/>got off the buses delirious from lack of water and<br/>food. completely dehydrated. the crowd tried to keep<br/>them all in one area; Denise said the new arrivals<br/>had mostly lost their minds. they had gone crazy.</p><p>inside the convention center, the place was one huge<br/>bathroom. in order to shit, you had to stand in<br/>other people&apos;s shit. the floors were black and slick with<br/>shit. most people stayed outside because the smell<br/>was so bad. but outside wasn&apos;t much better: between the<br/>heat, the humidity, the lack of water, the old and<br/>very young dying from dehydration... and there was<br/>no place to lay down, not even room on the sidewalk.<br/>they slept outside Wednesday night, under an overpass.</p><p>Denise said yes, there were young men with guns there.<br/>but they organized the crowd. they went to Canal<br/>Street and &quot;looted,&quot; and brought back food and water<br/>for the old people and the babies, because nobody<br/>had eaten in days. when the police rolled down windows<br/>and yelled out &quot;the buses are coming,&quot; the young men<br/>with guns organized the crowd in order: old people in<br/>front, women and children next, men in the back.<br/>just so that when the buses came, there would be<br/>priorities of who got out first.</p><p>Denise said the fights she saw between the young men<br/>with guns were fist fights. she saw them put their<br/>guns down and fight rather than shoot up the crowd.<br/>but she said that there were a handful of people<br/>shot in the convention center; their bodies were left<br/>inside, along with other dead babies and old people.</p><p>Denise said the people thought there were being sent<br/>there to die. lots of people being dropped off,<br/>nobody being picked up. cops passing by, speeding off.<br/>national guard rolling by with guns aimed at them.<br/>and yes, a few men shot at the police, because at a<br/>certain point all the people thought the cops were<br/>coming to hurt them, to kill them all. she saw a<br/>young man who had stolen a car speed past, cops in<br/>pursuit; he crashed the car, got out and ran, and the cops<br/>shot him in the back. in front of the whole crowd. she<br/>saw many groups of people decide that they were going to<br/>walk across the bridge to the west bank, and those<br/>same groups would return, saying that they were met<br/>at the top of the bridge by armed police ordering them<br/>to turn around, that they weren&apos;t allowed to leave.</p><p>so they all believed they were sent there to die.</p><p>Denise&apos;s niece found a pay phone, and kept trying to<br/>call her mother&apos;s boyfriend in Baton Rouge, and<br/>finally got through and told him where they were. the<br/>boyfriend, and Denise&apos;s brother, drove down from Baton<br/>Rouge and came and got them. they had to bribe a few<br/>cops, and talk a few into letting them into the city<br/>(&quot;come on, man, my 2-year-old niece is at the<br/>Convention Center!&quot;), then they took back roads to<br/>get to them.</p><p>after arriving at my other cousin&apos;s apartment in Baton<br/>Rouge, they saw the images on TV, and couldn&apos;t believe how the media was portraying the people of New<br/>Orleans. she kept repeating to me on the phone last<br/>night: make sure you tell everybody that they left us<br/>there to die. nobody came. those young men with guns<br/>were protecting us. if it wasn&apos;t for them, we wouldn&apos;t<br/>have had the little water and food they had found.</p><p>that&apos;s Denise Moore&apos;s story.</p><p>Lisa C.
