Before<br/>all this happened, I myself used the term &quot;Tuning Police&quot;<br/>but I was not thinking of anyone in particular. For me it<br/>is similar to the term &quot;Dream Police&quot; -- the characters in<br/>your dreams that try to convince you you are really awake<br/>once you start lucid dreaming and have taken control. They<br/>are a force to stop you from being lucid and aware of<br/>yourself and able to create productively. So for me the<br/>Tuning Police, whoever &quot;they&quot; are (Police I think is<br/>plural or collective, not singular which would be<br/>Policeman) represents -any- force that distracts us from<br/>creating things, intentional or not. Sometimes or perhaps<br/>ALWAYS in is our OWN SELVES -- just like the Dream Police<br/>are obviously parts of our own subconscious.</p><p>Anyway, he term &apos;Tuning Policeman&apos; or &apos;the Tuning Cop&apos; was<br/>_never_ used by anyone so I think it is incorrect to say a<br/>specific person was thought of.</p><p>I think the only reason Jacky used the term is because he<br/>had read my post from last week and thought the term<br/>itself was funny. Not because he was thinking of any one<br/>person:</p><p>&gt;Subject: [tuning] The Lawless Tuning Cyberworld<br/>&gt;Date: Sun, May 13, 2001, 5:10 PM</p><p>&gt;Hi Monz &amp; Dan,</p><p>&gt;&gt; Dan Stearns uses a different metaphor: he calls Paul the<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;Tuning Police&quot;.  So during his absence we posted in a<br/>&gt;&gt; lawless tuning cyberworld.</p><p>&gt;Ah... that sounds so sweet! Where can I find this<br/>&gt;tuning utopia of freedom and beauty?</p><p>&gt;Dan, if you have the web address, send it to me<br/>&gt;privately.</p><p>&gt;- Jeff</p><p>But come on now, I was not being very serious here, and I<br/>think everyone got that because no one flamed me for<br/>saying that. I was just fooling around, and I don&apos;t think<br/>Monz or Dan were all that serious either. If I thought<br/>there was any spirit of meanness in Monz&apos;s post, I would<br/>not have chimed in.</p><p>&gt;&gt; 5. If somebody posts something that you don&apos;t personally feel<br/>&gt;&gt; is overly theoretical and not particularly practical, please<br/>&gt;&gt; tell only them, rather than broadcast your criticism over the<br/>&gt;&gt; list.</p><p>&gt; This is what Jeff had suggested at the beginning - the Tribal<br/>&gt; Thunk - sent privately of course.</p><p>Hey look everybody! It&apos;s my name.</p><p>In the spirit of disclosure, I will reveal what I said<br/>about &apos;thunking&apos; so people know what I am talking about<br/>here. I was thinking it would be fun to have some &apos;rules&apos;<br/>like they do on a certain TV game show to help us focus on<br/>creation of music. But I later realized that having such<br/>mandatory rules before the fact would make _me_ the<br/>&apos;Tuning Policeman&apos; so I changed my mind and decided what I<br/>_really_ needed to do was apply the rules to *myself*<br/>first and see if they worked. I figured that if people saw<br/>me applying these rules to myself and noticed that they<br/>were actually working to help me write more music, they<br/>might be inspired and try the rules themselves. So I made<br/>some posts about that instead, letting people know they<br/>could &apos;challenge&apos; me to produce actual music anytime I<br/>posted some new tuning I had devised without giving an<br/>example.</p><p>&gt; TRIBAL CUSTOM 1 - THE THUNK<br/>&gt; ---------------------------</p><p>&gt; If you notice anyone who is being impractical or talking about<br/>&gt; tunings he/she has never actually composed with you can call<br/>&gt; him/her on it by issuing a &apos;thunk&apos; call. In this case, you<br/>&gt; respond to them privately with an email that has their subject<br/>&gt; and in the body you write:</p><p>&gt; &quot;Thunk!&quot;</p><p>&gt; Whenever we get thunked on a post, we keep count of the number<br/>&gt; of thunks and then, in the spirit of humility, post a summary to<br/>&gt; the list a day or two later.</p><p>&gt; Example:</p><p>&gt; &quot;Hello list, since I posted on &apos;Spiral Galaxy Adaptive Tunings&apos;,<br/>&gt; I have gotten 17 thunks. But I do want to say that I am<br/>&gt; -personally- writing the software to do this, so I am trying<br/>&gt; somewhat to keep it real.&quot;</p><p>&gt; &quot;Hello list, since I posted on &apos;Interactive Bilateral/ Tuning<br/>&gt; Dimensional Lattices&apos;, I have gotten 28 thunks. I confess I have<br/>&gt; no music to back my claims and I will not bring it up again<br/>&gt; until I do. Thank you for helping me keep it real.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Thunks are the same thing as issuing a SCRABBLE challenge: &quot;I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t believe that is a real word.&quot;</p><p>------</p><p>I also came up with a related rule, which I&apos;ll include for<br/>completeness.  That&apos;s why I said the email should be<br/>private. I came up with another way of doing it called<br/>&apos;the challenge&apos; that could be done publically, but also<br/>entailed a risk -- once the challengee survived the<br/>challenge, the challenger had to put up some music too!</p><p>&gt;TRIBAL CUSTOM 2: THE CHALLENGE<br/>&gt;------------------------------</p><p>&gt; If someone is talking about some tuning like they are a big<br/>&gt; fancy expert, any member is welcome to issue &apos;The Challenge&apos;.</p><p>&gt; Once you receive &apos;The Challenge&apos;, you must either make available<br/>&gt; an excerpt from music you have written using the tuning, or post<br/>&gt; an article or review of a concert you have given which uses the<br/>&gt; tuning.</p><p>&gt; As an alternative, another list member may &quot;Bear Witness&apos; on<br/>&gt; your behalf if they have personally heard music from you that<br/>&gt; uses the tuning.</p><p>&gt; Once you have faced and survived &apos;The Challenge&apos;, the person who<br/>&gt; challenged you must post an excerpt of his/her own music, and<br/>&gt; will lose a turn to post. Oh wait, no that&apos;s Scrabble. You don&apos;t<br/>&gt; lose a turn, but other than that this holds.</p><p>&gt; This custom serves the tribal motto &quot;Keeping it Real&quot; and also<br/>&gt; serves as an incentive for us all to make sure we are writing<br/>&gt; music and not just talking about it.</p><p>-------</p><p>If anyone likes these rules they can use them. I came up<br/>with them not to mock or spite anyone but because I was<br/>wondering what we could do to help people who want to<br/>&apos;keep it real&apos; and _write_ more music. I myself suffer the<br/>temptation to theorize and metapost (as I am doing now) as<br/>a substitute for writing music and I also see that when it<br/>really comes down to it, there is not so much music being<br/>written but a lot of talk going on. We all, including<br/>myself, need to get real with the program if we want to<br/>call ourselves composers, or admit we are theorists and be<br/>happy with that. Either way is fine with me. I&apos;m just<br/>concerned that there are others like myself hoping to get<br/>a little incentive and inspiration from involvement with<br/>other composers here but for some reason that&apos;s not<br/>working. My personal decision has been to openly invite<br/>people to keep me real in the PM list.</p><p>Anyway, in summary... there you have it.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2001 10:56:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
