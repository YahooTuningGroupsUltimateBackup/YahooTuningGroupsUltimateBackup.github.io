It&apos;ll have your return address, the<br/>destination address, greeting, etc., on a separate letter for each<br/>destination (senator1, senator2, rep, president, etc).  It also generates<br/>a little mailing label sheet so you don&apos;t have to get tendonitus writing<br/>that stuff on the envelopes.</p><p>&#x9;You can check it out at this URL:<br/><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/poli">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/poli</a></p><p>&#x9;In order for it to work for you, send me your name, address, and<br/>the names (and addresses if you have time) of your Rep and Senators, and<br/>I&apos;ll enter you in the database, and send you a codename.  (If you&apos;re a<br/>couple, I&apos;ll enter the two of you separately;  you both have a vote--so<br/>why not send separate letters?)</p><p>&#x9;I&apos;ve tested it with several people, and I think the thing&apos;s<br/>working----but we&apos;ll never know til we start running it en masse.</p><p>Anyway, thank you, and I hope we can use this in the future,</p><p>C Bailey</p><p>app programmed in LISP and PHP<br/><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/</a></p></div>
