The violence of<br/>grinding poverty, exacerbated by economic sanctions after the first Gulf<br/>War, has been deepened by the latest invasion. Every day the economic<br/>policies of the occupying authorities create more hunger among Iraq&apos;s<br/>working people, transforming them into a pool of low-wage, semi-employed<br/>labor, desperate for jobs at almost any price.</p><p>While the effects of U.S. policy on daily life go largely unseen in the<br/>U.S. media, anyone walking the streets of Baghdad cannot miss them.<br/>Children sleep on the sidewalks. Buildings that once housed many of the<br/>city&apos;s four million residents, or the infrastructure that makes life in a<br/>modern city possible, like the telephone exchange, remain burned-out ruins<br/>months after the occupation started. Rubble fills the broad boulevards<br/>which were once the pride of a wealthy country, and the air has become<br/>gritty and brown as thousands of vehicles kick the resulting dust into the<br/>air.</p><p>In the meantime U.S. contractors get rich from the billions of taxpayer<br/>dollars supposedly appropriated for reconstruction. Iraq&apos;s national wealth<br/>-- factories, refineries, mines, docks, and other industrial facilities --<br/>are being readied for sale to foreign companies by the occupation&apos;s<br/>bureaucracy, to whom democracy and the unrestrained free market are the<br/>same thing.</p><p>But Iraqi workers, while facing bleak conditions, are not accepting their<br/>fate, at least as defined by corporate planners. They are organizing and<br/>making plans of their own.</p><p>Iraqi workers need a raise - desperately. For six months, they&apos;ve been<br/>paid at an emergency level dictated by the US occupation authority, known<br/>as the Coalition Provisional Authority, or CPA. Most workers get<br/>$60/month, a small percentage $120, and a tiny minority (mostly<br/>administrators and managers) $180. This is the same wage scale that<br/>prevailed under the last few years of the Saddam Hussein regime.</p><p>One worker at the General State Leather Industry Factory, the largest shoe<br/>factory in the Middle East, says she supports six people in her family<br/>with the emergency payment. With unemployment still at catastrophic<br/>levels, every working Iraqi is supporting many other people at home. As<br/>she explains her situation, she&apos;s surrounded by four other seamstresses,<br/>each wearing a hejab and worn tan tunic over their clothes. They stand<br/>protectively around her while she speaks for all of them. &quot;The prices of<br/>food and clothing are going up rapidly, and the salary is very low. We<br/>work hard, and I&apos;ve been here 10 years. I have to have a raise,&quot; she<br/>pleads.</p><p>Another worker at the Al Daura oil refinery just outside Baghdad,<br/>complaining anonymously for fear that he would lose his job, told me he&apos;d<br/>spent 10 years fighting in the Iran-Iraq war, only to return home to his<br/>six children with nothing. &quot;I still have no house or place to live,&quot; he<br/>said bitterly, &quot;and the current emergency wage is totally incapable of<br/>supporting us.&quot;</p><p>In September and October, the refinery saw three work stoppages, in which<br/>workers demanded a regular salary, at a level higher than the emergency<br/>payments. Leather factory workers even stormed out of their plant, and<br/>marched to the Labor Ministry, complaining about their manager and the<br/>wages. Similar protests have been happening at workplaces throughout the<br/>country.</p><p>Those without jobs, estimated at about 70 percent of the workforce, or<br/>about 7-8 million people, have even less. Twenty years ago, most people<br/>living in Baghdad were supported by regular employment. Today the<br/>informal, or black economy, is the means of survival for an enormous part<br/>of the population. Since April, the CPA and the Iraqi Ministry of Labor<br/>and Social Affairs have rewritten all the country&apos;s job classifications,<br/>and their corresponding salaries, at least three times. But the actual pay<br/>received by workers has remained exactly the same. The $87 billion just<br/>appropriated by Congress for Iraqi &quot;reconstruction&quot; contains not a dime<br/>for workers or the unemployed. Instead, the money will prepare the way for<br/>the transformation of the Iraqi economy, and the privatization of the<br/>state enterprises at its heart. In the process the Bush administration is<br/>not considering measures that would protect and reinforce labor rights.<br/>Instead, since April the CPA has essentially banned unions in Iraqi state<br/>enterprises, and even issued a decree prohibiting strikes.</p><p>In an October 8 phone press conference, Thomas Foley, director for private<br/>sector development for the CPA, announced a list of the first state<br/>enterprises to be sold off, including cement and fertilizer plants,<br/>phosphate and sulfur mines, pharmaceutical factories and the country&apos;s<br/>airline. Foley described his goal as a &quot;fully thriving capitalist<br/>economy.&quot; On September 19 the CPA published Order No. 39, which permits<br/>100% foreign ownership of businesses, except for the oil industry, and<br/>allows repatriation of profits. No. 37 suspends income and property taxes<br/>for the year, and limits taxes on individuals and corporations in the<br/>future to 15%.</p><p>Dathar Al-Kashab, manager of the Al Daura refinery, predicted that<br/>privatization would have an enormous effect. &quot;A worker starting here today<br/>has a job for life, under the old system, and there&apos;s no law which permits<br/>me to lay him off. But if I put on the hat of privatization, I&apos;ll have to<br/>fire 1500 [of the refinery&apos;s 3000] workers. In America when a company lays<br/>people off, there&apos;s unemployment insurance, and they won&apos;t die from<br/>hunger. If I dismiss employees now, I&apos;m killing them and their families.&quot;<br/>Al Kashab was formerly the manager of the maintenance department, and<br/>still wears his machinist&apos;s overalls as he sits behind the huge desk of<br/>the plant director, a position to which he was appointed when the<br/>occupation began.</p><p>The state-owned Mamoun Factory of Vegetable Oils, which employs 771<br/>workers is another prime candidate for sale to a private owner. &quot;But<br/>there&apos;s no private person in Iraq with enough money to buy this place,&quot;<br/>said manager Amir Faraj Bhajet. &quot;It would have to be a foreign owner. They<br/>would like the assets, but would they want the workers?&quot; Production is low<br/>and many of the plant&apos;s injection molding machines, which make plastic<br/>bottles for the oil, are disabled. Replacement parts were unavailable<br/>during 12 years of sanctions, and the plant was inspected 20 times as a<br/>possible site for chemical weapons production, since the PVC used in<br/>making bottles has a dual possible use. Iraqi newspapers are already<br/>carrying stories on possible buyers.</p><p>Despite fear of privatization, however, the fall of the Saddam regime has<br/>led to an explosion of workplace organizing activity. Low wages are one<br/>motivation, but often working conditions are even more important. At the<br/>Al Daura refinery, Detrala Beshab, president of the refinery&apos;s new union,<br/>noted that while the workday is officially seven hours, the day shift is<br/>actually 11 hours long, and the night shift 13 hours. Since workers are<br/>paid by the month, there is no overtime pay. &quot;When we talked to the<br/>manager, he told us he had to talk to the Oil Ministry, which had to talk<br/>to the Finance Ministry, which had to get permission from the coalition<br/>forces,&quot; Beshab said. &quot;The coalition forces control the finances and our<br/>wages.&quot; Beshab and the union committee are all older men, at least in<br/>their forties. The plant hasn&apos;t hired new workers in some time. Any job in<br/>Baghdad right now may be precarious, but it is a means of survival, so<br/>workers hang onto them by any means they can. An eleven hour shift is much<br/>better than no shift at all.</p><p>The workers&apos; situation is so desperate the refinery gives them motor oil<br/>every month to make up for their low income. On the highway outside the<br/>plant, the sons of refinery workers have set up little roadside stands<br/>selling it to passing cars. In Saddam&apos;s time no one could afford to retire<br/>- &quot;the pension wasn&apos;t enough to pay a taxi to collect the check,&quot; Beshab<br/>laughs. But the refinery and every other state enterprise did pay other<br/>important benefits. There was a system of bonuses and profit-sharing,<br/>which often was as much as the salary itself, and a food subsidy as well.<br/>All those benefits disappeared when the occupation authorities took over.<br/>Workers have suffered a drastic cut in income since April as a result of<br/>CPA decisions. A skyrocketing exchange rate (2000 dinars to the dollar in<br/>mid-October) has made imports more expensive -- in effect, another cut in<br/>salary.</p><p>    No one in the refinery, except the fire department, has boots or<br/>gloves. Safety glasses are unknown. &quot;Lots of us have breathing problems,<br/>and there are accidents in which people get burned,&quot; explained another<br/>union member, Rajid Hassan. If anyone gets hurt or sick, they have to pay<br/>for their own medical care, and lose pay for the time they&apos;re out of work.</p><p>    Two months ago, organizers came out to the plant from one of Iraq&apos;s<br/>two new labor federations, the Workers Democratic Trade Union Federation,<br/>the modern successor to the country&apos;s pre-Saddam labor movement. Iraq has<br/>a long history of labor and radical activity, born during the fight<br/>against the British during their 6-year occupation of the country at the<br/>end of World War One. Starting with oil, railroad and dock workers, unions<br/>mounted strikes, which the British suppressed at gunpoint, killing<br/>strikers.</p><p>    The monarchy that the British installed, lasting until 1958, continued<br/>to make union organizing illegal. After the 1958 revolution overthrew the<br/>king, unions and radical political parties came aboveground for the first<br/>time. But in 1963, the CIA mounted a coup against the Kassem government,<br/>and installed the Baath Party. In 1977, Saddam Hussein, who became the<br/>Baath Party ruler, purged the unions and made radical parties illegal.<br/>Many activists were executed, and others fled Iraq into exile.</p><p>    Following the fall of the Saddam regime in April, organizers of the<br/>old unions resurfaced. In Basra, they mounted a strike two days after the<br/>arrival of British troops, demanding the right to organize and protesting<br/>the appointment of a Baath Party member as the new mayor. Subsequently,<br/>400 union activists met in Baghdad in June, forming the Workers Democratic<br/>Trade Union Federation, and laid plans to reorganize unions in twelve of<br/>the country&apos;s main industries. After that meeting, organizers fanned out<br/>to workplaces, including the Al Daura refinery. There they encouraged<br/>workers in each of the nine departments to elect union committees, and to<br/>choose leaders for the entire installation. While the plant manager seemed<br/>very willing to talk with the union, he was not able to sign any kind of<br/>contract with the federation.</p><p>    The refinery and all other state enterprises are still covered by the<br/>law issued by Saddam on March 11, 1987, which abolished Labour Law No. 151<br/>of 1970, which guaranteed such rights as the 8 hour day. Saddam&apos;s 1987<br/>decree turned workers in the public sector into &quot;civil servants,&quot; thereby<br/>denying them the right to form or join unions or to bargain. The pension<br/>funds of these workers were handed to the treasury without compensation.<br/>At the same time that unions in the public sector were banned, new<br/>&quot;unions&quot; were created for the private sector which, according to Law 52 of<br/>1987, would work with management to &quot;increase efficiency and work<br/>discipline.&quot;</p><p>    The 1987 law has a special effect on workers employed in enterprises<br/>set to be privatized-if they have no legal union, no right to bargain and<br/>no contracts, the privatization of the plants and the huge job losses that<br/>will come with it will face much less organized resistance.</p><p>    On June 5 CPA head Paul Bremer issued a decree, called &quot;Public<br/>Incitement to Violence and Disorder.&quot; In a paragraph about &quot;prohibited<br/>pronouncements,&quot; section b) list those that &quot;incite civil disorder,<br/>rioting or damage to property.&quot; Those who violate the decree &quot;will be<br/>subject to immediate detention by CPA security forces and held as a<br/>security internee under the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 [which<br/>governs prisoners of war].&quot; The phrase civil disorder can easily be<br/>interpreted as applying to people advocating or organizing strikes.</p><p>    On an October 13 interview, Dr. Nuri Jafer, assistant to the Iraqi<br/>Minister of Labor, was asked whether the 1987 law would be repealed, and<br/>refused to answer the question. Sitting next to him in his ornate office<br/>was Leslie Findley, a British advisor assigned by the CPA to oversee the<br/>ministry. She was asked the same question, and also refused to answer.<br/>Then she complained about the number of union delegations visiting the<br/>ministry, making the same request. &quot;I&apos;m going to tell the minister that<br/>these are taking too much of his time, and recommend that he concentrate<br/>instead on doing his job,&quot; she warned. Dr. Jafer spent a half-hour<br/>describing in glowing terms his idea for a new system of unemployment<br/>benefits, paying, he hoped, a survival income &quot;without removing the<br/>motivation from people to go out and find jobs.&quot; Leaving aside the<br/>repetition of the free-marketeers&apos; horror that poor people might lose<br/>their desire to work, Dr. Nuri&apos;s explanation had one other major problem.<br/>&quot;As yet, unfortunately,&quot; he conceded, &quot;we have yet to find any country<br/>willing to help us fund it.&quot;</p><p>    At the shoe and vegetable oil factories, another new labor group began<br/>organizing workers this summer, called the Workers Unions and Councils.<br/>With its encouragement, shoe factory workers organized a union and<br/>demanded legal recognition. Like workers at the refinery, they complained<br/>about long hours without overtime pay, no vacations, and the disappearance<br/>of their extra pay when the occupation started. At the factory this<br/>reporter was immediately surrounded by dozens of angry workers, each<br/>interrupting the other in their urgent efforts to describe their<br/>frustration. Dressed in the standard blue overalls of most Iraqi factory<br/>workers, they looked as if they had just taken a break from operating<br/>their machines. All seemed very willing to speak out within just a few<br/>yards of the manager&apos;s office, but hesitated at giving their names. They<br/>explained their reluctance by noting that workers whose names wound up on<br/>lists maintained by Saddam Hussein security police were fired and<br/>blacklisted, or even executed.</p><p>    &quot;We&apos;re demanding the right to form a union which must have full<br/>authority to represent workers here,&quot; explained one worker. &quot;We must<br/>change this law that says we don&apos;t have to right to a union. If the law<br/>doesn&apos;t change, we&apos;ll change it anyway, like it or not. We are the<br/>people.&quot; When an assistant manager listening to the interview began to<br/>explain the reason why the factory director couldn&apos;t negotiate, this<br/>worker lost his patience and his loud, intense disagreement made the<br/>manager retreat back into the office. &quot;Life has gotten much worse,&quot; said<br/>another, pointing emphatically into the air. &quot;Everything is controlled by<br/>the coalition. We don&apos;t control anything.&quot; Even without legal status,<br/>unions are finding a way to operate and win some demands. The vegetable<br/>oil factory&apos;s employees tried first to set up a union for the food<br/>products industry. The labor ministry then reminded them that they were<br/>civil servants, and therefore prohibited from collective bargaining. The<br/>workers and the Workers Councils responded by setting up a union for civil<br/>servants, defying the ban. The new union&apos;s demands include reclassifying<br/>the workers so that they can receive higher salaries, lifting the<br/>punishment of banned former employees, and the reinstatement of<br/>profit-sharing. According to its general secretary Majeed Sahib Kareem, &quot;a<br/>major reason for our existence is to eliminate the laws issued by the<br/>Baath regime.&quot; Kareem displayed a long list of workers at the plant who<br/>had been arrested and executed during the Saddam Hussein regime for<br/>belonging to the Al Daiwa Party, which is now part of the Iraqi Governing<br/>Council. The children of these workers were blacklisted and unable to find<br/>jobs. Kareem and his union seek to get the government and factory<br/>management to make restitution for the old crimes, and correct the harm<br/>done to workers&apos; families.</p><p>    The WDTUF also condemns the 1987 law and calls for its repeal, but<br/>doesn&apos;t organize mass demonstrations against it. &quot;We think civil<br/>disobedience is a fertile ground for troublemakers to create havoc and<br/>endanger the lives of the people who participate,&quot; said Abdullah Muhsin,<br/>the federation&apos;s international representative. Part of the Workers<br/>Councils network is the Union of the Unemployed, which for months marched<br/>and demonstrated in the streets for survival payments for people who often<br/>are starving. On July 29 they set up a tent encampment in front of the<br/>compound of the US occupation authorities, and the soldiers detained 21 of<br/>the union&apos;s leaders as a result. &quot;The money they spent on just ten combat<br/>helicopters would be enough to meet the needs of all the unemployed<br/>workers in our country,&quot; charged Qasim Hadi, the union&apos;s general<br/>secretary, who has been arrested twice in protests.</p><p>    In the face of extreme levels of unemployment, the occupation<br/>authorities have claimed that the contracts for reconstruction given to US<br/>corporations will result in jobs for large numbers of Iraqis. In an August<br/>13 letter to the Union of the Unemployed, William B. Clatanoff, the<br/>then-CPA advisor to the Ministry of Labor, boasted that neighborhood<br/>councils throughout Baghdad would nominate projects &quot;which will not only<br/>offer productive jobs, but also quickly impact neighborhoods in need of<br/>overdue improvements.&quot; Anyone driving through the city&apos;s streets in the<br/>following two months could easily see the absence of any such public<br/>works, however. Enormous piles of rubble from the war remain untouched.<br/>Clatanoff promised 300,000 jobs throughout Iraq, none of which have<br/>appeared.</p><p>    Nevertheless, US corporations are actively providing some essential<br/>services to the occupation troops, maintaining prison compounds, and<br/>rebuilding those parts of the infrastructure, like ports and pipelines,<br/>needed to get oil exports restarted. But here the employment of Iraqi<br/>nationals is much less desired.</p><p>    Highly paid technicians are brought in from outside, and housed in<br/>compounds surrounded by walls and razor wire, escorted by soldiers.<br/>According to the Financial Times of London, contractors preparing meals<br/>for troops on their bases use foreign nationals because they don&apos;t trust<br/>Iraqis. &quot;Iraqis are a security threat,&quot; said a manager for the Tamimi<br/>Company, which provides food service for 60,000 soldiers. Instead, the<br/>firm brought in 1800 workers from Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bangladesh.<br/>Tamimi in turn is a contractor to US construction giant Kellogg, Brown and<br/>Root, a subsidiary of the Halliburton Corporation. Halliburton&apos;s no-bid<br/>contract in Iraq is worth over $2 billion.</p><p>    Those Iraqis who do get hired to work for the Americans on the bases<br/>describe oppressive working conditions. Muiwafa al Saidy, who works for US<br/>contractors doing construction at the Baghdad airport, complained that<br/>&quot;soldiers aim guns at us wherever we go, even to the toilet.&quot; Workers are<br/>paid $5 a day, but have to give $2 of that to a &quot;translator&quot; who threatens<br/>to tell the soldiers they&apos;re terrorists unless he gets paid off. They have<br/>to pass through three different gates to gain access to the area where<br/>they work, and al Saidy described instances in which they were held in a<br/>no-man&apos;s land between the gates all day, to punish them for arriving a few<br/>minutes late. Adding to the tension are the presence of prisoners in the<br/>compound. Al Saidy said he&apos;s seen children brought in from the soccer<br/>fields, balls in hand, old men in their 80s, and even hospital patients<br/>carrying their drip bags. He described treatment bordering on contempt -<br/>food thrown on the ground, blows with sticks, and other forms of<br/>disrespect.</p><p>    In August, a representative of the International Labor Organization,<br/>Walid Hamdan, visited Iraq. On his return, he made a report to the<br/>International Confederation of Trade Unions (ICFTU). Guy Ryder, the<br/>ICFTU&apos;s general secretary, called for an international labor delegation to<br/>visit Iraq to investigate conditions for workers. &quot;Ensuring respect for<br/>workers&apos; rights, including freedom of association, must be central to<br/>building a democratic Iraq and to ensuring sustainable economic and social<br/>development,&quot; the ICFTU said in a May 30 statement. &quot;Democracy must have<br/>roots. It requires free elections, but also mass based, democratic trade<br/>unions that help secure it and protect it as well as being schools of<br/>democracy.&quot; Arab trade unionists are also critical of the occupation&apos;s<br/>effect on workers.</p><p>    According to Hacene Djemam, General Secretary of the International<br/>Confederation of Arab Trade Unions, &quot;war makes privatization easy: first<br/>you destroy the society and then you let the corporations rebuild it.&quot; He<br/>emphasized that Iraqi workers must be able to form unions of their own<br/>choosing.</p><p>    Meanwhile, US Labor Against the War, which brought together unions and<br/>labor councils that opposed the Bush intervention before it took place,<br/>prepared a research paper after the occupation started, profiling the US<br/>corporations that were given reconstruction contracts. A USLAW delegation<br/>to Iraq in October took copies of the report, and offered to assist unions<br/>there if and when they confront the kind of union-busting activity for<br/>which some of those companies have become notorious. A British labor<br/>delegation also visited Iraq in September.</p><p>    Labor support in the US for Iraqi unions will focus on the repeal of<br/>the 1987 Saddam law prohibiting collective bargaining for state-sector<br/>workers, and the removal of other legal barriers on labor activity. The US<br/>Labor Assembly for Peace, convened in Chicago on October 24 and 25 by<br/>USLAW, announced it was launching a national campaign to defend Iraqi<br/>labor rights under the occupation, and resolved to make this an issue in<br/>the 2004 election. It called for Congressional hearings into the<br/>enforcement of the 1987 law, and began circulating resolutions through<br/>unions around the country to build up pressure on Bush and the CPA.</p><p>    Clarence Thomas, former secretary-treasurer of San Francisco longshore<br/>Local 10 of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, was a member<br/>of the USLAW October delegation. He explained to a meeting of WDTUF<br/>leaders that his local had opposed the war even before it started, a<br/>position backed up by the International union at its convention in June.<br/>Jassim Mashkoul, the new federation&apos;s director for internal<br/>communications, thanked him for his opposition to the war and occupation.<br/>&quot;At the beginning, we thought our situation might be better afterwards,<br/>since we got rid of Saddam Hussein. But it hasn&apos;t been.&quot; He cited the<br/>occupation authority&apos;s enforcement of the 1987 law as a major obstacle. In<br/>addition, he noted, the new federation has asked that the old union<br/>structure set up by Saddam Hussein be officially dissolved, and its<br/>buildings and the benefit funds it administered turned over to the new<br/>unions. The occupation authorities have turned a deaf ear to these appeals<br/>as well. Both the WDTUF and the Workers Councils federations opposed the<br/>war and call for an end to the occupation. But according to another leader<br/>of the federation, Muhsen Mull Ali, who spent two long stints in prison<br/>for organizing unions in Basra, &quot;they will reimpose capitalism on us, so<br/>our responsibility is to oppose privatization as much as possible, and<br/>fight for the welfare of our workers.&quot; &quot;We need Congressional hearings<br/>into the union-busting actions by US occupation authorities in Iraq,&quot;<br/>Thomas declared. &quot;If unions here knew what&apos;s being done in our name over<br/>there, they&apos;d be outraged.&quot;</p><p>    [David Bacon, Bay Area labor photojournalist, accompanied Clarence<br/>Thomas, executive board member of ILWU Local 10 in San Francisco, to Iraq<br/>and chronicled their meetings with Iraqi workers, union organizers, and<br/>others.

The violence of grinding<br/>&gt; poverty, exacerbated by economic sanctions after the first<br/>&gt; Gulf War, has been deepened by the latest invasion.<br/>&gt; Every day the economic policies of the occupying authorities<br/>&gt; create more hunger among Iraq&apos;s working people, transforming<br/>&gt; them into a pool of low-wage, semi-employed labor, desperate<br/>&gt; for jobs at almost any price.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;etc. ... snip&gt;</p><p>there&apos;s no way for me to know for sure, but i would<br/>bet that the fact that that report is 7 months old<br/>*is* significant.</p><p>the things i&apos;ve read that recently came directly from<br/>the mouths of regular Iraqi citizens seems to indicate<br/>that in general life there now -- under the occupation --<br/>is *much* better for most people than it was during<br/>Saddam&apos;s rule.</p><p>of course, the world of business in Iraq right now<br/>is like it always is in any war zone: crazy.  i read<br/>an interview with one guy who had been living in exile<br/>in America and now has gone back to Baghdad, opened<br/>a combination auto-repair/chop shop, and is happily making<br/>$1000 a month (or it might even be $1000 a week, i don&apos;t<br/>remember now) doing work for both legitimate customers<br/>and car thieves.  he doesn&apos;t care where his income<br/>comes from, he&apos;s just glad to be making it.  by the<br/>$60-a-month standard you quoted, he&apos;s rapidly becoming<br/>a very rich man in his society.</p><p>this might be of interest:<br/><a href="http://www.baghdadproject.com/">http://www.baghdadproject.com/</a></p><p>-monz</p></div>
