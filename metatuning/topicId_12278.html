More recently, von<br/>Schweinitz has turned to a profound exploration of microtonal<br/>phenomena in a body of work whose newest opus is this evening&apos;s<br/>sublime Plainsound Glissando Modulation, a raga in just intonation for<br/>violin and double bass. Receiving its U.S. debut, the monumental<br/>composition is played with consummate artistry by violinist Helge<br/>Slaatto and bassist Frank Reinecke, the virtuoso duo who last year<br/>recorded the 75-minute raga for Bayerische Rundfunk. The concert opens<br/>with Erika Duke-Kirkpatrick&apos;s performance of Plainsound-Litany, for<br/>solo cello.
