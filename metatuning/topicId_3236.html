And there are two things that, hands down, make my life so easy when surfing:</p><p>1. the mouse click forward/back (as mentioned in the article) which in virtually no time became so intuitive that I literally found myself doing it in other programs, not remembering that it wasn&apos;t a supported &apos;gesture&apos;</p><p>2. a simple icon to click on that turns image loading on or off. I surf with no images, which not only speeds up the (dial-up line) process, but also avoids the ads on Yahoo; if I come to a site that images are integral to (as in navigation or photos I want to view), one click turns them back on, rather than looking in menus or preferences somewhere.</p><p>There are still sites (probably because of non-standard compliance) that don&apos;t display that well in Opera, but increasingly few. I&apos;d say the future is bright for intuitive and gestural computing...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
