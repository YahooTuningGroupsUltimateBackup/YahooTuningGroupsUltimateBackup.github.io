I see no reason to doubt the truthfulness<br/>of what this article says.</p><p>I&apos;m trying to come to terms with the timing of this post, and the<br/>subject line you chose for it, given recent and very painful events<br/>here on these lists.</p><p>You and I are both opposed to the war in Iraq and to the right-wing<br/>regimes of the countries that are supporting it, including Israel.</p><p>There is no question that human rights violations have occured in the<br/>name of the Israeli state.</p><p>Why not mention that Israel&apos;s Supreme Court has repeatedly overruled<br/>the army and the government and made them operate under the rule of<br/>law, something that cannot be said for any other Middle Eastern<br/>nation? That Isreal&apos;s Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the legal<br/>rights and due process of its country&apos;s attackers, something without<br/>remote parallel in the region?</p><p>Or that it utterly overshadows the rest of the Middle East, and<br/>indeed the vast majority of the world, in its regard for the rights<br/>of women, homosexuals, the disabled, and in its upholding of the<br/>freedom of speech, press, dissent, association, and of course<br/>religion?</p><p>You&apos;ve posted about Israel over and over again. I guess it&apos;s silly<br/>for me to expect that one of these posts will be positive. Why not,<br/>on this very difficult day on these lists, make a post on behalf of<br/>the victims, whose complaints have poured into the UN over the years<br/>with no raft of condemning resolutions resulting, of human rights<br/>abuses in Bahrain, Chad, China, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Pakistan,<br/>Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and Zimbabwe<br/>(perhaps they&apos;re spared such resolutions because these countries,<br/>like the Palestinian Authority but unlike Israel, are part of the<br/>UN&apos;s private strategic and information-sharing sessions in the five<br/>UN regional groups)?</p><p>How about a post mentioning that after the Tiananmen Square killings,<br/>Yasser Arafat was the first to congratulate the killers, writing,</p><p>&apos;On behalf of the Arab Palestinian people, their leadership and<br/>myself, I . . . take this opportunity to express extreme<br/>gratification that you were able to restore normal order after the<br/>recent inicidents in People&apos;s China. I wish you, close friends, more<br/>progress in your endeavor to achieve the hopes, goals, aspirations,<br/>stability and security of our friends, the Chinese people&apos;</p><p>?</p><p>Israel, and seemingly only Israel, is under your microscope, the<br/>microscope of the UN, and the microscope of the world media. Maybe<br/>just today, on this one very difficult day, you can point your gaze<br/>somewhere else?</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3><a id=6351 href="#6351">ðŸ”—</a>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2003 3:42:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This is a new one on me . guess we know now for sure where he is getting his<br/>support</p><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How about a post mentioning that after the Tiananmen Square killings,<br/>&gt; Yasser Arafat was the first to congratulate the killers, writing,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &apos;On behalf of the Arab Palestinian people, their leadership and<br/>&gt; myself, I . . . take this opportunity to express extreme<br/>&gt; gratification that you were able to restore normal order after the<br/>&gt; recent inicidents in People&apos;s China.

These freedoms extend to *all* religious groups.<br/>Including Muslims, who according to some estimates (extrapolating<br/>current trends), comprise the demographic future of Israel.</p><p>It&apos;s true that there is some discrimination there compared with, say,<br/>the United States. But this is on the decline. The Israel Supreme<br/>Court ruled in 2002: &quot;The principle of equality prohibits the state<br/>from distinguishing between its citizens on the basis of religion of<br/>nationality. The principle also applies to the allocation of state<br/>land . . . The Jewish character of the state does not permit Israel<br/>to discriminate between its citizens.&quot; Compare this to the rest of<br/>the Middle East, where non-Muslims, particular Jews, are little more<br/>than dirt in the eyes of the law.</p><p>It&apos;s also true that all non-criminal Jews are automatically entitled<br/>to citizenship in Israel. This is essentially why Israel became a<br/>state in 1948 in the first place, because the simultaneous fronts of<br/>German and Arab Nazism left surviving Jews with nowhere to go (turned<br/>away even by the USA). Jordan, which makes up the majority of<br/>Palestine, also has a &quot;right of return&quot;, which explicitly denies<br/>citizenship to all Jews (and only to Jews), even those who lived<br/>there for generations. Saudi Arabia is a similar case, as are most<br/>Muslim states. Germany and China have &quot;right of return&quot; laws for<br/>members of those nationalities. Yet you never hear these countries<br/>singled out as &quot;racist&quot; or &quot;apartheid&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Only Jews are allowed to immigrate<br/>&gt; to this wonderful example of enlightened civilization.</p><p>Another falsehood. For example, many non-Jewish Soviet emigres,<br/>Muslims who escaped from the Bosnian Civil War in 1993, and Albanian<br/>refugees rescused from Kosovo in 1999, have been given first-class<br/>citizenship in Israel.</p><p>&gt; Surely that&apos;s<br/>&gt; a bit of an anachronism in the modern world, 21st century and all<br/>&gt; that, wouldn&apos;t you say?</p><p>Perhaps, but Israel&apos;s neighbors (outnumbering it in population by 60-<br/>to-1) look even less like this ideal of the modern world, and hate<br/>Isreal for its -- believe it or not -- comparitavely progressive<br/>social environment.</p></div><h3><a id=6626 href="#6626">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2004 1:40:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Peter Wakefield Sault&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/metatuning/topicId_6342.html#6438">/metatuning/topicId_6342.html#6438</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  It would display a lack of love for the<br/>&gt; &gt; people of Israel not to criticize Sharon and his band of thugs.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***You know, I have real questions about Sharon.

But the visit was<br/>negotiated in advance with Palestinian leaders. Meanwhile, the<br/>evidence shows the violence had been carefully planned well before<br/>Sharon&apos;s visit. Arafat&apos;s rejection of Barak&apos;s peace offer was<br/>carefully planned to coincide with an outbreak of terrorism (I can<br/>explain more fully if you wish). As the communications minister of<br/>the Palestinian Authority candidly acknowledged (to the Jerusalem<br/>Post):</p><p>&apos;The PA had begun to prepare for the outbreak of the current Intifada<br/>since the return from the Camp David negotiations, by request of<br/>President Yasser Arafat, who predicted the outbreak of the Intifada<br/>as a complementary stage to the Palestinian steadfastness in the<br/>negotiations, and not as a specific protest against Sharon&apos;s visit to<br/>[Temple Mount] . . . The Intifada was no surprise for the Palestinian<br/>leadership. The leadership had invested all of its efforts in<br/>political and diplomatic channels in order to fix the flaws in the<br/>negotiations and the peace process, but to no avail. It encountered<br/>Israeli stubbornness and continuous renunciation of [Palestinian]<br/>rights . . . The PA instructed the political forces and factions to<br/>run all the materials of the Intifada.&apos;</p><p>The Mitchell commission came to a similar conclusion: &quot;The Sharon<br/>visit did not cause the Al-Aksa Intifada.&quot;</p><p>Still, Sharon did not behave like a 21st century hero -- far from it.<br/>Nevertheless, it would be very suprising indeed if neither side<br/>stages such another such provocation in the near future. Are we to<br/>accept violence as a legitimate response to such provocations? Or can<br/>the 21st century (actually much older) concept of freedom of<br/>expression eventually take hold in this troubled region? I hope so.</p></div>
