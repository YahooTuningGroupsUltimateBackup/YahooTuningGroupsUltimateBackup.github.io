There is a related Jewish story about an artificial  intelligence<br/>from the Prague, Czech Jewish community in the middle ages, where  the idea of<br/>the Robot took place.  What Vilnai is trying to say is that if,  on paper, a<br/>deadly degree of violence (qassam missles) moves out past Sderot (as  now with<br/>Ashkelon), a line will have been crossed.  The robot goes into a  new mode of<br/>response.<br/>&quot;In Tokyo on  Thursday, Condoleeza Rice, the US secretary of  state, briefly<br/>met Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister, and said the  Hamas rocket<br/>attacks &quot;need to stop&quot;.<br/>----She gets it.  While  Palestinians understand their reality quite well,<br/>demonstrating their will as  the result of the Nakba, their own &quot;perception of a<br/>holocaust&quot; either present or  forthcoming, they do not empathize with the<br/>other side.  Israel represent a  much wider degree of different opinions, and<br/>Jews worldwide likely even  wider.  Palestinians likely are using basic math to<br/>show the disparity in  deaths they have suffered, land that has been lost,<br/>dignity that has been  maligned, and worse.  There cannot be a telephone call when<br/>Israel and  Palestine are on different calls.<br/>&quot;Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman  for Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian<br/>president, who is negotiating with  Israel, said in a statement its  military actions<br/>&quot;meant only one thing: the Israeli government ... aims to  destroy the peace<br/>process&quot;.<br/>-----It seems  that Abbas is oblivious. The peace process is an abstract<br/>thing: the  line crossed is becoming imminent.  This is not good.  And note the<br/>destroyer just sent by Bush to Lebanon, a microcosm of a much larger  picture.<br/>Respectfully to  all parties,<br/>Johnny</p><p>**************Ideas to please picky eaters.
