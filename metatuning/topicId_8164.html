Similar prices for a decent desktop<br/>&gt;computer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Example - the people I bought my desktop computer<br/>&gt;from  are selling a low range laptop for &pound;675.62<br/>&gt;which is 1,253.61 dollars and that would be considered<br/>&gt;cheap for a laptop here - you wouldn&apos;t expect<br/>&gt;anything fancy at that price. If you have special<br/>&gt;requirements it might well be over $2000<br/>&gt;and that wouldn&apos;t be considered expensive,<br/>&gt;only middle range. Expensive would be more<br/>&gt;like $3000 to $4000.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Lucky you :-).</p><p>Honestly, I don&apos;t know how Europeans afford anything.</p><p>Actually, despite that Americans still enjoy low prices<br/>on many things, I think it&apos;s starting to happen here.<br/>For one thing, none among my close classmates are likely<br/>to be as wealthy as their parents.  I wonder if this<br/>isn&apos;t part of the natural progression of Empires.  You<br/>get obscene wealth, but then all that wealth causes<br/>inflation, and that crushes your younger generations.<br/>Did the American Empire top out in 1965?  Looks like it<br/>from where I&apos;m sitting.  In this view, it&apos;s abhorrent<br/>but understandable that Republicans are trying so hard<br/>for another WWII.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
