Where are the articles in<br/>&gt;peer-reviewed journals that prove the mailing lists it purports to<br/>&gt;discuss even exist? For that matter, can you prove that you haven&apos;t<br/>&gt;been banned from metatuning? Can you prove that I exist? Where is the<br/>&gt;hard evidence that I exist?</p><p>PLAIN ENGLISH TRANSLATION:<br/>&quot;I&apos;m scared spitless of an open debate about the alleged connection<br/>of the harmonic series and small integer ratios with Western music,<br/>because if I try to face mclaren in an open debate I&apos;ll get my ass<br/>whipped as badly as Dante Rosati has.  So instead I&apos;m going to<br/>make ridiculous assertions and try to put &apos;em in mclaren&apos;s mouth<br/>to avoid having to debate on the issues.&quot; -- Graham Breed</p><p>------------------------</p><p>GRAHAM BREED&apos;S CODE PHRASE:<br/>&gt;Another blatant lie. It is precisely the censoring of so-called &quot;logic&quot;<br/>&gt;and &quot;documented facts&quot; by the so-called &quot;moderators&quot; of the<br/>&gt;Alternative Lying so-called &quot;List&quot; that led me to ban every one of them<br/>&gt;from so-called &quot;posting&quot; to metatuning. And, as evidence of my own<br/>&gt;so-called &quot;adherence&quot; to sound logical principles I have now so-called<br/>&gt;&quot;banned&quot; myself from posting to so-called &quot;metatuning&quot;. Any so-called<br/>&gt;&quot;evidence&quot; to the contrary, including this so-called &quot;message&quot;, is<br/>&gt;simply a so-called &quot;figment&quot; of your overactive so-called &quot;imagination&quot;.</p><p>PLAIN ENGLISH TRANSLATION;<br/>&quot;It really pisses me off when mclaren points out that a lot of what<br/>passes of knowledge on these microtonal forums isn&apos;t. But I have<br/>no facts and no logic to rebut mclaren&apos;s arguments, so all I can<br/>do is try to create a cartoonish caricature of mclaren in the hope<br/>that no will notice I&apos;m not offering a rational argument.&quot; -- Graham Breed<br/>------------------------</p><p>GRAHAM BREED&apos;S CODE PHRASE:<br/>&gt;What is the objectively verifiable evidence that proves that I posted<br/>&gt;this message? Again, where is the hard evidence that I exist? Have I<br/>&gt;ever provided any proof that I exist?</p><p>PLAIN ENGLISH TRANSLATION:<br/>&quot;I soil myself with fear at the prospect of confronting the hard<br/>evidence about JI from psychoacoustics and acoustics and<br/>ethnomusicology, because I know the evidence is overwhelmingly<br/> against me. So instead I&apos;ll try to make up a load of gobbledygook and<br/>stuff  it into  mclaren&apos;s mouth so no one will notice I&apos;m not actually<br/>making a case  for JI as it is discussed on these forums.&quot; -- Graham Breed<br/>------------------------</p><p>GRAHAM BREED&apos;S CODE PHRASE:<br/>&gt;So let us apply common sense and the test of reality to Carl Lumma&apos;s<br/>&gt;so-called &quot;post&quot;.<br/>&gt;Does a reasonable person spend his life submitting so-called &quot;messages&quot;<br/>&gt;to some wacky so-called &quot;mailing list&quot; he read on the internet just<br/>&gt;because somebody made the claim that it exists without offering a shred<br/>&gt;of so-called &quot;proof&quot; (which has been discredited anyway)? Where are the<br/>&gt;tablets of stone handed down by significant deities stating that there<br/>&gt;is even an Alternative Logic List to ban Brian McLaren from?</p><p>PLAIN ENGLISH TRANSLATION:<br/>&quot;I&apos;m going to make the outlandish claim that mailing lists don&apos;t<br/>exist, and that we must require proof in forms of &grave;tablets of stone<br/>handed down by significant deities&apos; and then I&apos;m going to put this<br/>crazy nonsense in mclaren&apos;s mouth.<br/>&quot;I&apos;m going to do this  because if I try to go up against mclaren<br/>straight on, he&apos;ll slice me to ribbons by pointing out the logical<br/>fallacies in my arguments. So instead I&apos;ll try some ridicule, rather<br/>than a sensible  argument. Maybe it&apos;ll work...maybe the members of the<br/>meta_tuning  forum are so stupid they won&apos;t notice what I&apos;m trying to<br/>get away  with.&quot; -- Graham Breed<br/>------------------------</p><p>GRAHAM BREED&apos;S CODE PHRASE:<br/>&gt;What are the issue numbers and the volume numbers and the page numbers<br/>&gt;of the peer-reviwed journal articles of listening experiments which<br/>&gt;prove that the AAWL is genuinely uncensored? Can anybody provide<br/>&gt;objectively verifiable facts and logic to prove that the AAWL even<br/>&gt;exits? What is the hard objectively verifiable evidence that Carl Lumma<br/>&gt;has not been banned from metetuning? What is the hard objectively<br/>&gt;verifiable evidence that anybody is reading this? What is the hard<br/>&gt;objectively verifiable evidence that I exist?</p><p>PLAIN ENGLISH TRANSLATION:<br/>&quot;I&apos;m so cynical and so manipulative that I think I can get away with<br/>putting words in mclaren&apos;s mouth and no one will notice.   I have such<br/>contempt for the people on this list that I&apos;resure I can bamboozle &apos;em<br/>all into accepting this cartoonish caricature as a substanative<br/>contribution, instead of the McCarthy-style smear tactic it is. After<br/>all, since the ATL uses the language of science and the outward<br/>trappings of science but does not use the actual methods of science,<br/>it would be fatal to let mclaren point this out. So *anyone* asking<br/>for peer-reviewed scientific  journal  articles as proof of _any_<br/>claim HAS to be publicly ridiculed.<br/>&quot;The true scientific method must be sneered at and denigrated because<br/>it&apos;d debunk  TOPS and Harmonic Entropy  and vals and wedgies<br/>in a hot minute. And I&apos;d look like a damn fool for getting suckered in<br/>by all that musically meaningless numerological gibberish for all<br/>those years.  Pseudoscience is fine for me. Asking for proof that a<br/>claim is true is repugnant to me.  Whenever I see a sign of rational<br/>argumentation and critical thinking, it bugs me so badly I just have<br/>to stoop to McCarthy-style smear tactics like this.&quot; -- Graham Breed</p><p>------------<br/>--mclaren</p></div>
