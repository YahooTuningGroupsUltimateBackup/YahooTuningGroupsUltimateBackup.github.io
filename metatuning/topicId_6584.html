Best<br/>source I&apos;ve come across so far for that perspective. - D. McR.</p><p>*<br/>Friday, December 12, 2003</p><p>Meanwhile...<br/>We heard the latest statement from Washington about Germany, France,<br/>Russia<br/>and Canada not being allowed to have anything to do with the<br/>reconstruction.<br/>Iraq no longer feels like a country- it feels like war spoils: the<br/>winning<br/>team gets the pickings. So how is the world supposed to be involved in<br/>the<br/>reconstruction of Iraq when they are being deliberately excluded?</p><p>It&apos;s a decision like this one that brings to light the complete<br/>uselessness<br/>of the Governing Council. Why is Washington calling the shots on the<br/>reconstruction issues? This means that even after a military occupation,</p><p>we&apos;ll be under an economic occupation for years to come. Why aren&apos;t any<br/>of<br/>the new ministers or GC members saying anything about this? Somehow, I<br/>have<br/>a feeling that if they have anything to say, it&apos;ll be in accordance with</p><p>this latest decision.</p><p>There was a demonstration in Baghdad yesterday of about 4,000 people.<br/>The<br/>parties who are a part of the GC took part in an &apos;anti-terror&apos; protest.<br/>The<br/>roads were closed for security reasons and helicopters were hovering<br/>over<br/>head. There were a couple of women&apos;s groups. I recognized some women<br/>from<br/>Al-Da&apos;awa Al-Islamiya- Al-Jaffari&apos;s party. The Iraqi communist party and</p><p>SCIRI were also involved. The irony is seeing SCIRI members hold up the<br/>&quot;NO<br/>TERROR&quot; banners (they could start by not terrorizing the Al-Iraqiya<br/>station<br/>because the anchorwomen don&apos;t wear hijabs.).</p><p>There were other demonstrations in some provinces, and they&apos;ve all been<br/>lobbed together with the one in Baghdad. The truth is that some of them<br/>were<br/>actually anti-occupation demonstrations, like the one in Khaldiya. There</p><p>were large crowds demonstrating in Khaldiya, demanding the release of<br/>boys<br/>and men who have been detained for over 3 months in American prison<br/>camps.</p><p>Today (well, technically, yesterday) there was another large<br/>demonstration<br/>in Baghdad which was a peaceful anti-occupation demonstration. The<br/>demonstrators were mainly university students and teachers who were<br/>opposing<br/>the raids occurring in some colleges and universities. They were<br/>demanding<br/>the release of three women who were detained when the Technology<br/>University<br/>in Baghdad was raided. Their spokesperson, a professor, I think, said<br/>that<br/>this was going to be the first demonstration in a long series of<br/>anti-occupation activism being organized by teachers and students.</p><p>There were some loud explosions a while ago... I just read it might have</p><p>been inside of the &apos;Green Zone&apos;.</p><p>- posted by river @ 2:22 AM</p><p>Kerosene and Gasoline...<br/>The electricity has been terrible lately- it comes in fits and starts.<br/>The<br/>moment it goes off, we start running around the house unplugging things<br/>and<br/>flicking off the power switches- you don&apos;t want anything to be turned on</p><p>when the power comes back either too high or too low. That&apos;s why I&apos;ve<br/>been<br/>blogging less often. Every time there&apos;s electricity, we remember a long<br/>list<br/>of things that can only be done in an electrical world. like vacuum.<br/>Some<br/>say it&apos;s not only Baghdad- the north also seem to be having continuous<br/>electricity problems.</p><p>The most popular guy in the neighborhood these days Abu Hassen. He lives<br/>on<br/>our street and he&apos;s going to purchase one of those large generators that</p><p>will, supposedly, provide electricity to around 20 houses. The problem<br/>is<br/>that it can&apos;t accommodate any more than 20 houses (probably fewer) and<br/>anyone who wants to has to &apos;sign up&apos; for the electricity. When E. went<br/>to<br/>get us registered for a few amperes, Abu Hassen told him that he already<br/>had<br/>30 families who wanted to sign on but he would put us on a waiting list<br/>(!).</p><p>Since the generators are expensive, Abu Hassen has been hesitant to buy<br/>one.<br/>E. says he has a nephew who works at one of the electric power stations<br/>in<br/>Baghdad who convinced him it would be a *great* investment because the<br/>power<br/>situation promises to be very erratic for a while yet.</p><p>The big problem now is that gasoline is hard to come by. This is a very<br/>frustrating issue for Iraqis. Gasoline was like water here. In fact,<br/>bottled<br/>water used to be far more expensive than gasoline and admittedly still<br/>is.<br/>The lines at the gas stations are long and tedious. E. and my cousin<br/>sometimes go to fill up the car and disappear for hours at a time. The<br/>gasoline is necessary for running the generators and now they&apos;re going<br/>to<br/>start rationing it. This will mean that within days, the price of gas is</p><p>going to go up because people will start selling black market gasoline.</p><p>Kerosene is also hard to come by these days. Every time the kerosene man</p><p>comes banging down our street, representatives from each household<br/>instantly<br/>run outside and stand impatiently at their gates, some greeting him with<br/>an<br/>energetic &quot;Hello, habibi!&quot; We need the kerosene for the &apos;sopas&apos; or the<br/>kerosene heaters, and the kerosene lamps. The weather is nice during the</p><p>day, but it gets somewhat chilly during the evening. We light the<br/>kerosene<br/>heaters in the rooms and watch them carefully so that they don&apos;t start<br/>giving out poisonous fumes from burning kerosene. There have been entire</p><p>families that died in their sleep from CO poisoning from kerosene<br/>heaters.</p><p>The nicest thing about the heaters is the fact that there&apos;s always a<br/>kettle<br/>of water on top of them. This accomplishes two things it once: it keeps<br/>the<br/>air in the room from getting very dry, and it provides a ready kettle of<br/>hot<br/>water for the tea ritual during the evening. The sopa is also fantastic<br/>for<br/>heating bread. At night, when there is no hope of electricity, we sit<br/>around<br/>on the rug, a little distance away from the sopa, and drink sweet tea,<br/>with<br/>warm bread and some famous Iraqi salted white cheese, while listening to<br/>the<br/>radio or just talking about family matters, or political matters.</p><p>The sun sets quite early these days and, if there&apos;s no electricity, it<br/>gets<br/>a little bit depressing. E. and I often go out to the roof to enjoy the<br/>last<br/>few minutes of sun every evening. Sometimes, the electricity will return<br/>at<br/>night and the lights will flicker on suddenly, leaving us too dazzled<br/>for<br/>the first few moments to do anything but sit there, allowing our eyes to</p><p>adjust to the abrupt change.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
