Whenever<br/>we have almost succeeded in doing so, the Enemy permits a war or an<br/>earthquake or some other calamity, and at once courage becomes so<br/>obviously lovely and important even in human eyes that all our work<br/>is undone, and there is still at least one vice of which they feel<br/>genuine shame. The danger of inducing cowardice in our patients,<br/>therefore, is lest we produce real self-knowledge and self-loathing<br/>with consequent repentance and humility. And in fact, in the last<br/>war, thousands of humans, by discovering their own cowardice,<br/>discovered the whole moral world for the first time. In peace we can<br/>make many of them ignore good and evil entirely; in danger, the<br/>issue is forced upon them in a guise to which even we cannot blind<br/>them. There is here a cruel dilemma before us. If we promoted<br/>justice and charity among men, we should be playing directly into<br/>the Enemy&apos;s hands; but if we guide them to the opposite behaviour,<br/>this sooner or later produces (for He permits it to produce) a war<br/>or a revolution, and the undisguisable issue of cowardice or courage<br/>awakes thousands of men from moral stupor.</p><p>-Screwtape</p><p><a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/phantom1/books2/c._s._lewis_-">http://members.fortunecity.com/phantom1/books2/c._s._lewis_-</a><br/>_the_screwtape_letters.htm</p></div>
