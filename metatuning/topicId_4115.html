The report is a chilling catalog of the<br/>mechanisms of violence and its impact on Guatemalan society. Among the<br/>findings of that report were that SOA  (the School of the Americas, a<br/>United States government terrorist training camp in Georgia)  graduates<br/>were responsible for the assassination of anthropologist Myrna Mack, the<br/>cover-up of the murder of U.S. citizen Michael Devine, and the torture and<br/>murder of Efrain Bamaca, husband of U.S. citizen Jennifer Harbury.</p><p>The report also states that SOA graduate Benedicto Lucas Garcia<br/>masterminded the creation of vigilante groups known as PACs that were<br/>responsible for some of the most horrific violations of the war.<br/>Furthermore, three SOA graduates were top officials in the notorious D-2<br/>intelligence agency, which the report characterizes as having played &quot;a<br/>central role in the conduct of military operations, in massacres,<br/>extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances, and torture.&quot; It is also<br/>known that SOA graduates held key cabinet positions under the brutal<br/>dictatorships of Lucas Garcia, Rios Montt, and Mejia Victores.</p><p>In June 2001, a Guatemala court found three military officers guilty of<br/>having planned his murder; the first time a Guatemalan court had ever<br/>convicted military officials of a political crime.  One of those<br/>convicted, Byron Lima Estrada, former head of the notorious G-2 military<br/>intelligence unit, was a School of the Americas graduate.</p><p>In October 2002 an appeals court annulled the historic verdict, a decision<br/>that stunned supporters all over the world.  The judges ordered a new<br/>trial for the accused, based on their belief that testimony of a key<br/>witness was flawed.</p><p>Less than a month later, the Guatemalan Supreme Court (CSJ) suspended the<br/>appeals courtÂ’s sentence.  Tomorrow, on January 31st, the CSJ will hold a<br/>hearing to decide whether or not the convicted will receive a new trial.<br/>Visit <a href="http://www.soaw.org">www.soaw.org</a> for updates.</p><p>With the verdict now up in the air, human rights workers in Guatemala and<br/>abroad are left wondering what the future holds: will justice prevail or<br/>will impunity and the increasingly violent environment in Guatemala throw<br/>the winning punch?</p></div>
