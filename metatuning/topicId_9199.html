Some of the mercenaries say they have<br/>been &quot;deputized&quot; by the Louisiana governor; indeed some are wearing gold<br/>Louisiana state law enforcement badges on their chests and Blackwater photo<br/>identification cards on their arms. They say they are on contract with the<br/>Department of Homeland Security and have been given the authority to use<br/>lethal force. Several mercenaries we spoke with said they had served in Iraq<br/>on the personal security details of the former head of the US occupation, L.<br/>Paul Bremer and the former US ambassador to Iraq, John Negroponte.</p><p>&quot;This is a totally new thing to have guys like us working CONUS (Continental<br/>United States),&quot; a heavily armed Blackwater mercenary told us as we stood on<br/>Bourbon Street in the French Quarter. &quot;We&apos;re much better equipped to deal<br/>with the situation in Iraq.&quot;</p><p>Blackwater mercenaries are some of the most feared professional killers in<br/>the world and they are accustomed to operating without worry of legal<br/>consequences. Their presence on the streets of New Orleans should be a cause<br/>for serious concern for the remaining residents of the city and raises<br/>alarming questions about why the government would allow men trained to kill<br/>with impunity in places like Iraq and Afghanistan to operate here. Some of<br/>the men now patrolling the streets of New Orleans returned from Iraq as<br/>recently as 2 weeks ago.</p><p>What is most disturbing is the claim of several Blackwater mercenaries we<br/>spoke with that they are here under contract from the federal and Louisiana<br/>state governments.</p><p>Blackwater is one of the leading private &quot;security&quot; firms servicing the<br/>occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan. It has several US government contracts<br/>and has provided security for many senior US diplomats, foreign dignitaries<br/>and corporations. The company rose to international prominence after 4 of<br/>its men were killed in Fallujah and two of their charred bodies were hung<br/>from a bridge in March 2004. Those killings sparked the massive US<br/>retaliation against the civilian population of Fallujah that resulted in<br/>scores of deaths and tens of thousands of refugees.</p><p>As the threat of forced evictions now looms in New Orleans and the city<br/>confiscates even legally registered weapons from civilians, the private<br/>mercenaries of Blackwater patrol the streets openly wielding M-16s and other<br/>assault weapons. This despite Police Commissioner Eddie Compass&apos; claim that<br/>&quot;Only law enforcement are allowed to have weapons.&quot;</p><p>Officially, Blackwater says it forces are in New Orleans to &quot;join the<br/>Hurricane Relief Effort.&quot; A statement on the company&apos;s website, dated<br/>September 1, advertises airlift services, security services and crowd<br/>control. The company, according to news reports, has since begun taking<br/>private contracts to guard hotels, businesses and other properties. But what<br/>has not been publicly acknowledged is the claim, made to us by 2 Blackwater<br/>mercenaries, that they are actually engaged in general law enforcement<br/>activities including &quot;securing neighborhoods&quot; and &quot;confronting criminals.&quot;</p><p>That raises a key question: under what authority are Blackwater&apos;s men<br/>operating? A spokesperson for the Homeland Security Department, Russ Knocke,<br/>told the Washington Post he knows of no federal plans to hire Blackwater or<br/>other private security. &quot;We believe we&apos;ve got the right mix of personnel in<br/>law enforcement for the federal government to meet the demands of public<br/>safety.&quot; he said.</p><p>But in an hour-long conversation with several Blackwater mercenaries, we<br/>heard a different story. The men we spoke with said they are indeed on<br/>contract with the Department of Homeland Security and the Louisiana<br/>governor&apos;s office and that some of them are sleeping in camps organized by<br/>Homeland Security in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. One of them wore a gold<br/>Louisiana state law enforcement badge and said he had been &quot;deputized&quot; by<br/>the governor. They told us they not only had authority to make arrests but<br/>also to use lethal force. We encountered the Blackwater forces as we walked<br/>through the streets of the largely deserted French Quarter. We were talking<br/>with 2 New York Police officers when an unmarked car without license plates<br/>sped up next to us and stopped. Inside were 3 men, dressed in khaki<br/>uniforms, flak jackets and wielding automatic weapons. &quot;Y&apos;all know where the<br/>Blackwater guys are?&quot; they asked. One of the police officers responded,<br/>&quot;There are a bunch of them around here,&quot; and pointed down the road.</p><p>&quot;Blackwater?&quot; we asked. &quot;The guys who are in Iraq?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; said the officer. &quot;They&apos;re all over the place.&quot;</p><p>A short while later, as we continued down Bourbon Street, we ran into the<br/>men from the car. They wore Blackwater ID badges on their arms.</p><p>&quot;When they told me New Orleans, I said, &apos;What country is that in?,&apos;&quot; said<br/>one of the Blackwater men. He was wearing his company ID around his neck in<br/>a carrying case with the phrase &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom&quot; printed on it.<br/>After bragging about how he drives around Iraq in a &quot;State Department issued<br/>level 5, explosion proof BMW,&quot; he said he was &quot;just trying to get back to<br/>Kirkuk (in the north of Iraq) where the real action is.&quot; Later we overheard<br/>him on his cell phone complaining that Blackwater was only paying $350 a day<br/>plus per diem. That is much less than the men make serving in more dangerous<br/>conditions in Iraq. Two men we spoke with said they plan on returning to<br/>Iraq in October. But, as one mercenary said, they&apos;ve been told they could be<br/>in New Orleans for up to 6 months. &quot;This is a trend,&quot; he told us. &quot;You&apos;re<br/>going to see a lot more guys like us in these situations.&quot;</p><p>If Blackwater&apos;s reputation and record in Iraq are any indication of the kind<br/>of &quot;services&quot; the company offers, the people of New Orleans have much to<br/>fear.</p><p>............</p><p>Jeremy Scahill, a correspondent for the national radio and TV program<br/>Democracy Now!, and Daniela Crespo are in New Orleans.
