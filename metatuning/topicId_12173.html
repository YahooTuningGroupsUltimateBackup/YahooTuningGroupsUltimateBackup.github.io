He suspected the dust was laced with anthrax.&quot; This introduction is certainly eye-catching and paints Ivins as having obsessive tendencies directed at clutter or, the media might like you to think, the investigation. While superficially sinister, the media fails to recognise the fact that these could simply be personal eccentricities of an extremely intelligent scientist. He certainly isn&apos;t the only creative person to have exhibited quirks. The article later states: &quot;One researcher described a common room in the lab area as a &quot;rats&apos; nest.&quot; And experts say the &quot;sloppiness&quot; documented in the report may complicate prosecution if the anthrax killer is ever caught, especially if defense lawyers can cast doubt on USAMRIID&apos;S reliability.&quot; In this light, shouldn&apos;t Ivins&apos; cleanliness-- even if slightly over the top-- be seen as an asset in a dangerously disorganized office?</p><p>now look at this from USA TODAY 2004<br/><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-10-13-anthrax-labs_x.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-10-13-anthrax-labs_x.htm</a><br/>&lt;<a href="http://letters.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/08/01/anthrax/permalink/055f469834749b297fd3bb9a12555e76.html">http://letters.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/08/01/anthrax/permalink/055f469834749b297fd3bb9a12555e76.html</a>&gt; Anthrax slip-ups raise fears about planned biolabs<br/>By Dan Vergano and Steve Sternberg, USA TODAY<br/>Bruce Ivins was troubled by the dust, dirt and clutter on his officemate&apos;s desk, and not just because it looked messy.
