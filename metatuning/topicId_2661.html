Friedman<br/>New York Times<br/>June 16, 2002</p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/16/opinion/16FRIE.html?todaysheadlines">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/16/opinion/16FRIE.html?todaysheadlines</a></p><p>Iran has the bomb. I know. I found it.</p><p>No, no &iuml;&iquest;&half; not that bomb. This bomb is hiding in plain sight &iuml;&iquest;&half; in high<br/>schools, universities and coffee houses. It is a bomb that is ticking away<br/>under Iranian society, and over the next decade it will explode in ways that<br/>will change the face of this Islamic Republic. It&apos;s called here, for short,<br/>&quot;The Third Generation.&quot;</p><p>The first generation of Iranian revolutionaries overthrew the Shah in 1979<br/>and founded the Islamic Republic. They are now old, gray and increasingly<br/>tired, a clerical regime clinging to power more by coercion than by any<br/>popular acceptance of their plan to Islamize all aspects of Iranian life.<br/>The second generation came of age during the 1980&apos;s Iran-Iraq war, which<br/>left 286,000 Iranians dead and 500,000 injured. This is a lost generation,<br/>deflated and quiescent.</p><p>The third generation are those Iranians from 16 to 30 who have come of age<br/>entirely under Islamic rule. They never knew the Shah&apos;s despotism. They have<br/>known only the ayatollahs&apos;. There are now 18 million of them &iuml;&iquest;&half; roughly a<br/>third of Iran&apos;s population &iuml;&iquest;&half; and they include 2 million university students<br/>and 4 million recent university grads.</p><p>&quot;As with most revolutions, this third generation has no special sympathy for<br/>the founders of the revolution &iuml;&iquest;&half; in fact they blame our generation for<br/>bringing them a government they feel doesn&apos;t know how to run the country<br/>properly,&quot; observed Mohsen Sazgara, a former aide to Ayatollah Khomeini and<br/>now a top reformer. &quot;They are the most significant population group in Iran<br/>[until the fourth generation, the 24 million Iranians under 16, comes of<br/>age], and wherever this generation decides to go is where Iran will go in<br/>the next decade.&quot;</p><p>Where this Third Generation wants to go is already apparent. While some of<br/>them are religious conservatives, most are not. They are young, restless,<br/>modern-looking and often unemployed, because there are not enough good jobs.<br/>They are connected to the world via the Internet or satellite dishes &iuml;&iquest;&half; and<br/>they like what they see. They want the good life, a good job, more<br/>individual freedom and more connections with the outside world &iuml;&iquest;&half; and they<br/>are increasingly angry that they don&apos;t have those things. They embrace<br/>Islam, but they don&apos;t want it to occupy every corner of their lives.</p><p>&quot;They are not anti-religious, but they are anti-fundamentalism &iuml;&iquest;&half; they refuse<br/>to be blind followers of anything,&quot; says Hamidreza Jalaeipour, a sociology<br/>professor. His 19-year-old son, Mohammadreza, nods vigorously in agreement.</p><p>The government has already had to ease up in response to them. When I was<br/>last here, six years ago, a friend took me to see an Iranian guitarist who<br/>had an electric guitar but could only play songs in his bedroom, because pop<br/>music had been banned. Today he is giving public concerts of Iranian pop<br/>songs and cutting CD&apos;s. When I was last here women had to be covered in<br/>black robes and their hair could not show. Now the robes are multicolored<br/>and many push back their head scarves to show their hair. When the mullahs<br/>shout at them, many young women shout right back. The most popular Iranian<br/>films today are those that mock the hypocrisy of the theocracy, including<br/>one now playing in Tehran about a 15-year-old Iranian girl who has a child<br/>out of wedlock and decides to keep the baby, and another about a mother who<br/>runs off with her daughter&apos;s fianc&iuml;&iquest;&half;.</p><p>This Third Generation of Iranians is quite different from its counterpart in<br/>Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is a country getting younger, poorer, more<br/>Islamic and more anti-American &iuml;&iquest;&half; as young Saudis react against what they<br/>consider a corrupt, irreligious, pro-American regime. Iran is a country<br/>getting younger, poorer, less Islamic and less anti-American &iuml;&iquest;&half; as young<br/>Iranians react against an anti-American theocracy, isolating them from the<br/>world.</p><p>When Iran got the telegraph in the early 1900&apos;s it helped trigger the first<br/>constitutional revolution against the despotic Qajar regime. When telephones<br/>and tape cassettes spread around Iran in the 1970&apos;s, they became tools<br/>through which Ayatollah Khomeini spread his revolution against the Shah.<br/>Today the Internet and satellite TV have come to Iran, bringing with them<br/>new appetites and aspirations for Iran&apos;s Third Generation.</p><p>This Third Generation hoped President Khatami&apos;s reformist candidacy would<br/>satisfy those aspirations, but he proved to be a bust, unwilling to confront<br/>the conservatives. No matter. The Third Generation will eventually find a<br/>new political horse to ride and, when it does, Iran will change &iuml;&iquest;&half; with or<br/>without the ayatollahs&apos; blessings.</p></div>
