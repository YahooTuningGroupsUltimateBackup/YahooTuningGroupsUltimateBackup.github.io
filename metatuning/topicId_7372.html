Any event that is<br/>outside routine everyday occurrence can trigger such a loss of control<br/>... Once aroused, African hostility will vent itself indiscriminately on<br/>all outsiders.&quot;<br/>These statements, I think you&apos;ll agree, are thoroughly offensive. You<br/>would probably imagine them to be the musings of some 19th century<br/>colonialist. In fact, they come from a book promoted by its US publisher<br/>as &quot;one of the great classics of cultural studies&quot;, and described by<br/>Publisher&apos;s Weekly as &quot;admirable&quot;, &quot;full of insight&quot; and with &quot;an<br/>impressive spread of scholarship&quot;.<br/>The book is not actually about Africans. Instead, it takes some of the<br/>hoariest old prejudices about black people and applies them to Arabs.<br/>Replace the word &quot;African&quot; in the quotations above with the word &quot;Arab&quot;,<br/>and you have them as they appear in the book. It is, the book says, the<br/>Arabs who are lazy, sex-obsessed, and apt to turn violent over the<br/>slightest little thing.<br/>Writing about Arabs, rather than black people, in these terms apparently<br/>makes all the difference between a racist smear and an admirable work of<br/>scholarship.<br/>The book in question is called The Arab Mind, and is by Raphael Patai, a<br/>cultural anthropologist who taught at several US universities, including<br/>Columbia and Princeton.<br/>I must admit that, despite having spent some years studying Arabic<br/>language and culture, I had not heard of this alleged masterpiece until<br/>last week, when the investigative journalist Seymour Hersh mentioned it<br/>in an article for New Yorker magazine.<br/>Hersh was discussing the chain of command that led US troops to torture<br/>Iraqi prisoners. Referring specifically to the sexual nature of some of<br/>this abuse, he wrote: &quot;The notion that Arabs are particularly vulnerable<br/>to sexual humiliation became a talking point among pro-war Washington<br/>conservatives in the months before the March 2003 invasion of Iraq.<br/>&quot;One book that was frequently cited was The Arab Mind ... the book<br/>includes a 25-page chapter on Arabs and sex, depicting sex as a taboo<br/>vested with shame and repression.&quot;<br/>Hersh continued: &quot;The Patai book, an academic told me, was &apos;the bible of<br/>the neocons on Arab behaviour&apos;. In their discussions, he said, two themes<br/>emerged - &apos;one, that Arabs only understand force, and two, that the<br/>biggest weakness of Arabs is shame and humiliation&apos;.&quot;<br/>Last week, my own further enquiries about the book revealed something<br/>even more alarming. Not only is it the bible of neocon headbangers, but<br/>it is also the bible on Arab behaviour for the US military.<br/>According to one professor at a US military college, The Arab Mind is<br/>&quot;probably the single most popular and widely read book on the Arabs in<br/>the US military&quot;. It is even used as a textbook for officers at the JFK<br/>special warfare school in Fort Bragg.<br/>In some ways, the book&apos;s appeal to the military is easy to understand,<br/>because it gives a superficially coherent view of the Arab enemy and<br/>their supposed personality defects. It is also readily digestible,<br/>uncomplicated by nuances and caveats, and has lots of juicy quotes, a<br/>generous helping of sex, and no academic jargon.<br/>The State Department, too, used to take an interest in the book, although<br/>it seemingly no longer does. At one stage, the training department gave<br/>free copies to officials when they were posted to US embassies in the<br/>Middle East.<br/>In contrast, opinions of Patai&apos;s book among Middle East experts at US<br/>universities are almost universally scathing. &quot;The best use for this<br/>volume, if any, is as a doorstop,&quot; one commented. &quot;The book is old, and a<br/>thoroughly discredited form of scholarship,&quot; said another.<br/>None of the academics I contacted thought the book suitable for serious<br/>study, although Georgetown University once invited students to analyse it<br/>as &quot;an example of bad, biased social science&quot;.<br/>There is a lot wrong with The Arab Mind apart from its racism: the title,<br/>for a start. Although the Arab countries certainly have their distinctive<br/>characteristics, the idea that 200 million people, from Morocco to the<br/>Gulf, living in rural villages, urban metropolises and (very rarely these<br/>days) desert tents, think with some sort of single, collective mind is<br/>utterly ridiculous.<br/>The result is a collection of outrageously broad - and often suspect -<br/>generalisations. Patai asserts, for example, that Arabs &quot;hate&quot; the west.<br/>He backs up this claim with two quotations: one from a book published in<br/>the mid-50s (&quot;Most westerners have simply no inkling of how deep and<br/>fierce is the hate, especially of the west, that has gripped the<br/>modernising Arab&quot;), and another from Bernard Lewis - currently the<br/>neocons&apos; favourite historian - referring to the mood of &quot;many, if not<br/>most Arabs&quot; in 1955 (just before the Suez crisis).<br/>We are also informed (page 144) of &quot;the Arab view that masturbation is<br/>far more shameful than visiting prostitutes&quot;.<br/>Whether this is why Iraqi prisoners were forced to masturbate in front of<br/>cameras is unclear, but the only supporting evidence for Patai&apos;s claim is<br/>a survey of Arab and US students published in 1954: the US students<br/>admitted to masturbating twice as often as the Arabs, while 59% of the<br/>Arabs, but only 28% of the Americans, said they had visited a prostitute<br/>during the previous 12 months.<br/>In &quot;outlying areas&quot;, such as Siwa oasis in Egypt, Patai says,<br/>&quot;homosexuality is the rule, and practised completely in the open&quot;. This<br/>unequivocal statement is based on accounts dating from 1935, 1936 and<br/>1950, and, in a footnote, Patai concedes that they &quot;need to be checked<br/>out by an anthropologically trained observer&quot;.<br/>There is also a good deal of confusion in the book between the present<br/>and the past. An Arab man, Patai writes, even if he has four wives, &quot;can<br/>have sexual relations with concubines (slave girls whom he owns)&quot;.<br/>All this adds up to an overwhelmingly negative picture of the Arabs.<br/>Positive characteristics are mentioned, but are given relatively short<br/>shrift.<br/>Hospitality and generosity - two highly regarded virtues in Arab<br/>societies - get three and one and a half pages respectively, compared<br/>with a whole chapter devoted to alleged sexual hang-ups.<br/>The book is a classic case of orientalism which, by focusing on what<br/>Edward Said called the &quot;otherness&quot; of Arab culture, sets up barriers that<br/>can then be exploited for political purposes.<br/>The Arab Mind was originally published in 1976, but - according to one US<br/>academic - actually belongs to the &quot;national character&quot; genre of writing<br/>that was popular in comparative politics around the middle of the last<br/>century.<br/>Its methodology, therefore - not to mention much of its content - was<br/>considerably behind the times even when it first appeared.<br/>Patai died in 1996, but his book was revived by Hatherleigh Press in 2002<br/>(nicely timed for the war in Iraq), and reprinted with an enthusiastic<br/>introduction by Norvell &quot;Tex&quot; De Atkine, a former US army colonel and the<br/>head of Middle East studies at Fort Bragg.<br/>&quot;It is essential reading,&quot; De Atkine wrote. &quot;At the institution where I<br/>teach military officers, The Arab Mind forms the basis of my cultural<br/>instruction.&quot;<br/>In a speech last week, the US president, George Bush, congratulated<br/>himself on having removed &quot;hateful propaganda&quot; from the schools in Iraq.<br/>Perhaps it is now time he turned his attention to military schools in the<br/>US.</p></div>
