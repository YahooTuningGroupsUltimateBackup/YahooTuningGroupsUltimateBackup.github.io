In<br/>a review I read on YesNet, this reviewer has the answer the questions<br/>of why they are not using this and playing a &quot;Yesymphonic Overture&quot;<br/>with respect to the orchestra, instead of playing a recording of<br/>Firebird Suite.</p><p>This reviewer wrote and 8 page review.</p><p>Venue: Woodinville, WA, August 3<br/>Posted by: Brian Beck (Heartunes@...)<br/>&quot;Not having the Firebird Suite is due likely to the cost at each live<br/>event in the amount of about $2500 per show for the orchestra to<br/>have the music in front of them to play, as indicated by a previous<br/>reviewer.  Residuals, et al ...  It&apos;s MUCH more money than to<br/>just play the recording.  Multiply a dollar figure like that by the<br/>number of shows (there is talk of a Magnification Tour with<br/>orchestra :&gt;).  100 shows would be a quarter of a mill ...  &quot;</p><p>Cheryl</p><p>(Yes)Music HAS magic!

I thought you were speaking about the cost of hiring<br/>orchestral<br/>&gt; musicians to play a piece... which is exorbitant.</p><p>No, that cost was already paid. Yes hires an orchestra in each city<br/>they play a gig in. Jon Szanto was in one of these. The question<br/>regarded why these orchestras weren&apos;t playing the Firebird Suite<br/>(which is Yes&apos;s usual intro music).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure, if the composer prints out the score and parts himself it&apos;s<br/>not<br/>&gt; very expensive... probably under $100...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If one had to hire a copyist it would be, naturally, considerably<br/>&gt; more...</p><p>So I&apos;m wondering . . . isn&apos;t this piece now &quot;public domain&quot;? Why<br/>should it be so vastly expensive to get the sheet music?</p></div>
