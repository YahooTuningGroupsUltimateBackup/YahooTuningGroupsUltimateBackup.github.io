Thats 40% if you look at<br/>plus and minus 20%.<br/> I was hoping it might be closer to the Schuman resonance.</p><p>Here&apos;s Andy Fabian (the main scientist involved)reply to my inquiry<br/>regarding the pitch.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Chad</p><p>Date: Wed, 10 Sep 2003 21:50:58 +0100 (BST)</p><p>Hi</p><p>It was worked out from the frequency, which is about one cycle per 10<br/>million yr (to an accuracy of about 20%). If you agree that an octave is</p><p>a factor of two, then 57 octaves above this frequency we get to about<br/>479<br/>Hz or c/s, which is about B flat (A is 440Hz). You might tell me that<br/>479<br/>is closer to a note in another system, perhaps!? (I&apos;ve briefly looked<br/>at web-sites which suggest this is possible.) But given the uncertainty<br/>I don&apos;t think it makes a difference for the present purpose which is an<br/>attempt to illustrate this note in words.</p><p>We actually work out the pitch of the note we see from the wavelength<br/>(measured as the separation of the ripples in the X-ray image) and the<br/>speed of sound in the gas (measured from the temperature which we get<br/>from<br/>the spectrum or &apos;colour&apos; of the X-rays).</p><p>I hope that&apos;s intelligible and thanks for your interest.</p><p>yours<br/>Andy Fabian<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=5770 href="#5770">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2003 12:17:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, kraig grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s Andy Fabian (the main scientist involved)reply to my inquiry<br/>&gt; regarding the pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Chad<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Date: Wed, 10 Sep 2003 21:50:58 +0100 (BST)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was worked out from the frequency, which is about<br/>&gt; one cycle per 10 million yr (to an accuracy of about 20%).<br/>&gt; If you agree that an octave is a factor of two, then<br/>&gt; 57 octaves above this frequency we get to about 479 Hz<br/>&gt; or c/s, which is about B flat (A is 440Hz).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;</p><p>well, OK, then that makes the frequency approximately</p><p>479 / 2^(57)  =  3.32373 * 10^-15  Hz</p><p>-monz</p></div>
