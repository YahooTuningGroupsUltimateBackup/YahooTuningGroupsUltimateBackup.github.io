The letter first appeared on the<br/>internet in Arabic and has since been translated and circulated by Islamists<br/>in Britain.</p><p>............</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,</p><p>&quot;Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers)<br/>who are fought against, because they have been wronged and surely, Allah is<br/>Able to give them (believers) victory&quot; [Quran 22:39]</p><p>&quot;Those who believe, fight in the Cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve,<br/>fight in the cause of Taghut (anything worshipped other than Allah e.g.<br/>Satan). So fight you against the friends of Satan; ever feeble is indeed the<br/>plot of Satan.&quot;[Quran 4:76]</p><p>Some American writers have published articles under the title &apos;On what basis<br/>are we fighting?&apos; These articles have generated a number of responses, some<br/>of which adhered to the truth and were based on Islamic Law, and others<br/>which have not. Here we wanted to outline the truth - as an explanation and<br/>warning - hoping for Allah&apos;s reward, seeking success and support from Him.</p><p>While seeking Allah&apos;s help, we form our reply based on two questions<br/>directed at the Americans:</p><p>(Q1) Why are we fighting and opposing you?</p><p>Q2) What are we calling you to, and what do we want from you?</p><p>As for the first question: Why are we fighting and opposing you? The answer<br/>is very simple:</p><p>(1) Because you attacked us and continue to attack us.</p><p>a) You attacked us in Palestine:</p><p>(i) Palestine, which has sunk under military occupation for more than 80<br/>years. The British handed over Palestine, with your help and your support,<br/>to the Jews, who have occupied it for more than 50 years; years overflowing<br/>with oppression, tyranny, crimes, killing, expulsion, destruction and<br/>devastation. The creation and continuation of Israel is one of the greatest<br/>crimes, and you are the leaders of its criminals. And of course there is no<br/>need to explain and prove the degree of American support for Israel. The<br/>creation of Israel is a crime which must be erased. Each and every person<br/>whose hands have become polluted in the contribution towards this crime must<br/>pay its*price, and pay for it heavily.</p><p>(ii) It brings us both laughter and tears to see that you have not yet tired<br/>of repeating your fabricated lies that the Jews have a historical right to<br/>Palestine, as it was promised to them in the Torah. Anyone who disputes with<br/>them on this alleged fact is accused of anti-semitism. This is one of the<br/>most fallacious, widely-circulated fabrications in history. The people of<br/>Palestine are pure Arabs and original Semites. It is the Muslims who are the<br/>inheritors of Moses (peace be upon him) and the inheritors of the real Torah<br/>that has not been changed. Muslims believe in all of the Prophets, including<br/>Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon<br/>them all. If the followers of Moses have been promised a right to Palestine<br/>in the Torah, then the Muslims are the most worthy nation of this.</p><p>When the Muslims conquered Palestine and drove out the Romans, Palestine and<br/>Jerusalem returned to Islaam, the religion of all the Prophets peace be upon<br/>them. Therefore, the call to a historical right to Palestine cannot be<br/>raised against the Islamic Ummah that believes in all the Prophets of Allah<br/>(peace and blessings be upon them) - and we make no distinction between<br/>them.</p><p>(iii) The blood pouring out of Palestine must be equally revenged. You must<br/>know that the Palestinians do not cry alone; their women are not widowed<br/>alone; their sons are not orphaned alone.</p><p>(b) You attacked us in Somalia; you supported the Russian atrocities against<br/>us in Chechnya, the Indian oppression against us in Kashmir, and the Jewish<br/>aggression against us in Lebanon.</p><p>(c) Under your supervision, consent and orders, the governments of our<br/>countries which act as your agents, attack us on a daily basis;</p><p>(i) These governments prevent our people from establishing the Islamic<br/>Shariah, using violence and lies to do so.</p><p>(ii) These governments give us a taste of humiliation, and places us in a<br/>large prison of fear and subdual.</p><p>(iii) These governments steal our Ummah&apos;s wealth and sell them to you at a<br/>paltry price.</p><p>(iv) These governments have surrendered to the Jews, and handed them most of<br/>Palestine, acknowledging the existence of their state over the dismembered<br/>limbs of their own people.</p><p>(v) The removal of these governments is an obligation upon us, and a<br/>necessary step to free the Ummah, to make the Shariah the supreme law and to<br/>regain Palestine. And our fight against these governments is not separate<br/>from out fight against you.</p><p>(d) You steal our wealth and oil at paltry prices because of you<br/>international influence and military threats. This theft is indeed the<br/>biggest theft ever witnessed by mankind in the history of the world.</p><p>(e) Your forces occupy our countries; you spread your military bases<br/>throughout them; you corrupt our lands, and you besiege our sanctities, to<br/>protect the security of the Jews and to ensure the continuity of your<br/>pillage of our treasures.</p><p>(f) You have starved the Muslims of Iraq, where children die every day. It<br/>is a wonder that more than 1.5 million Iraqi children have died as a result<br/>of your sanctions, and you did not show concern. Yet when 3000 of your<br/>people died, the entire world rises and has not yet sat down.</p><p>(g) You have supported the Jews in their idea that Jerusalem is their<br/>eternal capital, and agreed to move your embassy there. With your help and<br/>under your protection, the Israelis are planning to destroy the Al-Aqsa<br/>mosque. Under the protection of your weapons, Sharon entered the Al-Aqsa<br/>mosque, to pollute it as a preparation to capture and destroy it.</p><p>(2) These tragedies and calamities are only a few examples of your<br/>oppression and aggression against us. It is commanded by our religion and<br/>intellect that the oppressed have a right to return the aggression. Do not<br/>await anything from us but Jihad, resistance and revenge. Is it in any way<br/>rational to expect that after America has attacked us for more than half a<br/>century, that we will then leave her to live in security and peace?!!</p><p>(3) You may then dispute that all the above does not justify aggression<br/>against civilians, for crimes they did not commit and offenses in which they<br/>did not partake:</p><p>(a) This argument contradicts your continuous repetition that America is the<br/>land of freedom, and its leaders in this world. Therefore, the American<br/>people are the ones who choose their government by way of their own free<br/>will; a choice which stems from their agreement to its policies. Thus the<br/>American people have chosen, consented to, and affirmed their support for<br/>the Israeli oppression of the Palestinians, the occupation and usurpation of<br/>their land, and its continuous killing, torture, punishment and expulsion of<br/>the Palestinians. The American people have the ability and choice to refuse<br/>the policies of their Government and even to change it if they want.</p><p>(b) The American people are the ones who pay the taxes which fund the planes<br/>that bomb us in Afghanistan, the tanks that strike and destroy our homes in<br/>Palestine, the armies which occupy our lands in the Arabian Gulf, and the<br/>fleets which ensure the blockade of Iraq. These tax dollars are given to<br/>Israel for it to continue to attack us and penetrate our lands. So the<br/>American people are the ones who fund the attacks against us, and they are<br/>the ones who oversee the expenditure of these monies in the way they wish,<br/>through their elected candidates.</p><p>(c) Also the American army is part of the American people. It is this very<br/>same people who are shamelessly helping the Jews fight against us.</p><p>(d) The American people are the ones who employ both their men and their<br/>women in the American Forces which attack us.</p><p>(e) This is why the American people cannot be not innocent of all the crimes<br/>committed by the Americans and Jews against us.</p><p>(f) Allah, the Almighty, legislated the permission and the option to take<br/>revenge. Thus, if we are attacked, then we have the right to attack back.<br/>Whoever has destroyed our villages and towns, then we have the right to<br/>destroy their villages and towns. Whoever has stolen our wealth, then we<br/>have the right to destroy their economy. And whoever has killed our<br/>civilians, then we have the right to kill theirs.</p><p>The American Government and press still refuses to answer the question:</p><p>Why did they attack us in New York and Washington?</p><p>If Sharon is a man of peace in the eyes of Bush, then we are also men of<br/>peace!!! America does not understand the language of manners and principles,<br/>so we are addressing it using the language it understands.</p><p>(Q2) As for the second question that we want to answer: What are we calling<br/>you to, and what do we want from you?</p><p>(1) The first thing that we are calling you to is Islam.</p><p>(a) The religion of the Unification of God; of freedom from associating<br/>partners with Him, and rejection of this; of complete love of Him, the<br/>Exalted; of complete submission to His Laws; and of the discarding of all<br/>the opinions, orders, theories and religions which contradict with the<br/>religion He sent down to His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Islam is<br/>the religion of all the prophets, and makes no distinction between them -<br/>peace be upon them all.</p><p>It is to this religion that we call you; the seal of all the previous<br/>religions. It is the religion of Unification of God, sincerity, the best of<br/>manners, righteousness, mercy, honour, purity, and piety. It is the religion<br/>of showing kindness to others, establishing justice between them, granting<br/>them their rights, and defending the oppressed and the persecuted. It is the<br/>religion of enjoining the good and forbidding the evil with the hand, tongue<br/>and heart. It is the religion of Jihad in the way of Allah so that Allah&apos;s<br/>Word and religion reign Supreme. And it is the religion of unity and<br/>agreement on the obedience to Allah, and total equality between all people,<br/>without regarding their colour, sex, or language.</p><p>(b) It is the religion whose book - the Quran - will remained preserved and<br/>unchanged, after the other Divine books and messages have been changed. The<br/>Quran is the miracle until the Day of Judgment. Allah has challenged anyone<br/>to bring a book like the Quran or even ten verses like it.</p><p>(2) The second thing we call you to, is to stop your oppression, lies,<br/>immorality and debauchery that has spread among you.</p><p>(a) We call you to be a people of manners, principles, honour, and purity;<br/>to reject the immoral acts of fornication, homosexuality, intoxicants,<br/>gambling&apos;s, and trading with interest.</p><p>We call you to all of this that you may be freed from that which you have<br/>become caught up in; that you may be freed from the deceptive lies that you<br/>are a great nation, that your leaders spread amongst you to conceal from you<br/>the despicable state to which you have reached.</p><p>(b) It is saddening to tell you that you are the worst civilization<br/>witnessed by the history of mankind:</p><p>(i) You are the nation who, rather than ruling by the Shariah of Allah in<br/>its Constitution and Laws, choose to invent your own laws as you will and<br/>desire. You separate religion from your policies, contradicting the pure<br/>nature which affirms Absolute Authority to the Lord and your Creator. You<br/>flee from the embarrassing question posed to you: How is it possible for<br/>Allah the Almighty to create His creation, grant them power over all the<br/>creatures and land, grant them all the amenities of life, and then deny them<br/>that which they are most in need of: knowledge of the laws which govern<br/>their lives?</p><p>(ii) You are the nation that permits Usury, which has been forbidden by all<br/>the religions. Yet you build your economy and investments on Usury. As a<br/>result of this, in all its different forms and guises, the Jews have taken<br/>control of your economy, through which they have then taken control of your<br/>media, and now control all aspects of your life making you their servants<br/>and achieving their aims at your expense; precisely what Benjamin Franklin<br/>warned you against.</p><p>(iii) You are a nation that permits the production, trading and usage of<br/>intoxicants. You also permit drugs, and only forbid the trade of them, even<br/>though your nation is the largest consumer of them.</p><p>(iv) You are a nation that permits acts of immorality, and you consider them<br/>to be pillars of personal freedom. You have continued to sink down this<br/>abyss from level to level until incest has spread amongst you, in the face<br/>of which neither your sense of honour nor your laws object.</p><p>Who can forget your President Clinton&apos;s immoral acts committed in the<br/>official Oval office? After that you did not even bring him to account,<br/>other than that he &apos;made a mistake&apos;, after which everything passed with no<br/>punishment. Is there a worse kind of event for which your name will go down<br/>in history and remembered by nations?</p><p>(v) You are a nation that permits gambling in its all forms. The companies<br/>practice this as well, resulting in the investments becoming active and the<br/>criminals becoming rich.</p><p>(vi) You are a nation that exploits women like consumer products or<br/>advertising tools calling upon customers to purchase them. You use women to<br/>serve passengers, visitors, and strangers to increase your profit margins.<br/>You then rant that you support the liberation of women.</p><p>(vii) You are a nation that practices the trade of sex in all its forms,<br/>directly and indirectly. Giant corporations and establishments are<br/>established on this, under the name of art, entertainment, tourism and<br/>freedom, and other deceptive names you attribute to it.</p><p>(viii) And because of all this, you have been described in history as a<br/>nation that spreads diseases that were unknown to man in the past. Go ahead<br/>and boast to the nations of man, that you brought them AIDS as a Satanic<br/>American Invention.</p><p>(xi) You have destroyed nature with your industrial waste and gases more<br/>than any other nation in history. Despite this, you refuse to sign the Kyoto<br/>agreement so that you can secure the profit of your greedy companies and<br/>industries.</p><p>(x) Your law is the law of the rich and wealthy people, who hold sway in<br/>their political parties, and fund their election campaigns with their gifts.<br/>Behind them stand the Jews, who control your policies, media and economy.</p><p>(xi) That which you are singled out for in the history of mankind, is that<br/>you have used your force to destroy mankind more than any other nation in<br/>history; not to defend principles and values, but to hasten to secure your<br/>interests and profits. You who dropped a nuclear bomb on Japan, even though<br/>Japan was ready to negotiate an end to the war. How many acts of oppression,<br/>tyranny and injustice have you carried out, O callers to freedom?</p><p>(xii) Let us not forget one of your major characteristics: your duality in<br/>both manners and values; your hypocrisy in manners and principles. All<br/>manners, principles and values have two scales: one for you and one for the<br/>others.</p><p>(a)The freedom and democracy that you call to is for yourselves and for<br/>white race only; as for the rest of the world, you impose upon them your<br/>monstrous, destructive policies and Governments, which you call the<br/>&apos;American friends&apos;. Yet you prevent them from establishing democracies. When<br/>the Islamic party in Algeria wanted to practice democracy and they won the<br/>election, you unleashed your agents in the Algerian army onto them, and to<br/>attack them with tanks and guns, to imprison them and torture them - a new<br/>lesson from the &apos;American book of democracy&apos;!!!</p><p>(b)Your policy on prohibiting and forcibly removing weapons of mass<br/>destruction to ensure world peace: it only applies to those countries which<br/>you do not permit to possess such weapons. As for the countries you consent<br/>to, such as Israel, then they are allowed to keep and use such weapons to<br/>defend their security. Anyone else who you suspect might be manufacturing or<br/>keeping these kinds of weapons, you call them criminals and you take<br/>military action against them.</p><p>(c)You are the last ones to respect the resolutions and policies of<br/>International Law, yet you claim to want to selectively punish anyone else<br/>who does the same. Israel has for more than 50 years been pushing UN<br/>resolutions and rules against the wall with the full support of America.</p><p>(d)As for the war criminals which you censure and form criminal courts for -<br/>you shamelessly ask that your own are granted immunity!! However, history<br/>will not forget the war crimes that you committed against the Muslims and<br/>the rest of the world; those you have killed in Japan, Afghanistan, Somalia,<br/>Lebanon and Iraq will remain a shame that you will never be able to escape.<br/>It will suffice to remind you of your latest war crimes in Afghanistan, in<br/>which densely populated innocent civilian villages were destroyed, bombs<br/>were dropped on mosques causing the roof of the mosque to come crashing down<br/>on the heads of the Muslims praying inside. You are the ones who broke the<br/>agreement with the Mujahideen when they left Qunduz, bombing them in Jangi<br/>fort, and killing more than 1,000 of your prisoners through suffocation and<br/>thirst. Allah alone knows how many people have died by torture at the hands<br/>of you and your agents. Your planes remain in the Afghan skies, looking for<br/>anyone remotely suspicious.</p><p>(e)You have claimed to be the vanguards of Human Rights, and your Ministry<br/>of Foreign affairs issues annual reports containing statistics of those<br/>countries that violate any Human Rights. However, all these things vanished<br/>when the Mujahideen hit you, and you then implemented the methods of the<br/>same documented governments that you used to curse. In America, you captured<br/>thousands the Muslims and Arabs, took them into custody with neither reason,<br/>court trial, nor even disclosing their names. You issued newer, harsher<br/>laws.</p><p>What happens in Guatanamo is a historical embarrassment to America and its<br/>values, and it screams into your faces - you hypocrites, &quot;What is the value<br/>of your signature on any agreement or treaty?&quot;</p><p>(3) What we call you to thirdly is to take an honest stance with yourselves<br/>- and I doubt you will do so - to discover that you are a nation without<br/>principles or manners, and that the values and principles to you are<br/>something which you merely demand from others, not that which you yourself<br/>must adhere to.</p><p>(4) We also advise you to stop supporting Israel, and to end your support of<br/>the Indians in Kashmir, the Russians against the Chechens and to also cease<br/>supporting the Manila Government against the Muslims in Southern<br/>Philippines.</p><p>(5) We also advise you to pack your luggage and get out of our lands. We<br/>desire for your goodness, guidance, and righteousness, so do not force us to<br/>send you back as cargo in coffins.</p><p>(6) Sixthly, we call upon you to end your support of the corrupt leaders in<br/>our countries. Do not interfere in our politics and method of education.<br/>Leave us alone, or else expect us in New York and Washington.</p><p>(7) We also call you to deal with us and interact with us on the basis of<br/>mutual interests and benefits, rather than the policies of sub dual, theft<br/>and occupation, and not to continue your policy of supporting the Jews<br/>because this will result in more disasters for you.</p><p>If you fail to respond to all these conditions, then prepare for fight with<br/>the Islamic Nation. The Nation of Monotheism, that puts complete trust on<br/>Allah and fears none other than Him. The Nation which is addressed by its<br/>Quran with the words: &quot;Do you fear them? Allah has more right that you<br/>should fear Him if you are believers. Fight against them so that Allah will<br/>punish them by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them<br/>and heal the breasts of believing people. And remove the anger of their<br/>(believers&apos;) hearts. Allah accepts the repentance of whom He wills. Allah is<br/>All-Knowing, All-Wise.&quot; [Quran9:13-1]</p><p>The Nation of honour and respect:</p><p>&quot;But honour, power and glory belong to Allah, and to His Messenger<br/>(Muhammad- peace be upon him) and to the believers.&quot; [Quran 63:8]</p><p>&quot;So do not become weak (against your enemy), nor be sad, and you will<br/>be*superior ( in victory )if you are indeed (true) believers&quot; [Quran 3:139]</p><p>The Nation of Martyrdom; the Nation that desires death more than you desire<br/>life:</p><p>&quot;Think not of those who are killed in the way of Allah as dead. Nay, they<br/>are alive with their Lord, and they are being provided for. They rejoice in<br/>what Allah has bestowed upon them from His bounty and rejoice for the sake<br/>of those who have not yet joined them, but are left behind (not yet<br/>martyred) that on them no fear shall come, nor shall they grieve. They<br/>rejoice in a grace and a bounty from Allah, and that Allah will not waste<br/>the reward of the believers.&quot; [Quran 3:169-171]</p><p>The Nation of victory and success that Allah has promised:</p><p>&quot;It is He Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad peace be upon him) with<br/>guidance and the religion of truth (Islam), to make it victorious over all<br/>other religions even though the Polytheists hate it.&quot; [Quran 61:9]</p><p>&quot;Allah has decreed that &apos;Verily it is I and My Messengers who shall be<br/>victorious.&apos; Verily Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.&quot; [Quran 58:21]</p><p>The Islamic Nation that was able to dismiss and destroy the previous evil<br/>Empires like yourself; the Nation that rejects your attacks, wishes to<br/>remove your evils, and is prepared to fight you. You are well aware that the<br/>Islamic Nation, from the very core of its soul, despises your haughtiness<br/>and arrogance.</p><p>If the Americans refuse to listen to our advice and the goodness, guidance<br/>and righteousness that we call them to, then be aware that you will lose<br/>this Crusade Bush began, just like the other previous Crusades in which you<br/>were humiliated by the hands of the Mujahideen, fleeing to your home in<br/>great silence and disgrace. If the Americans do not respond, then their fate<br/>will be that of the Soviets who fled from Afghanistan to deal with their<br/>military defeat, political breakup, ideological downfall, and economic<br/>bankruptcy.</p><p>This is our message to the Americans, as an answer to theirs. Do they now<br/>know why we fight them and over which form of ignorance, by the permission<br/>of Allah, we shall be victorious?</p></div><h3><a id=3545 href="#3545">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/24/2002 2:24:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
