Imagine, for the sake of simplicity, that we have a crystal made up of atoms in a cubic configuration. These atoms can be visualized (imprecisely, but close enough for our purposes) as an infinite 3 dimensional array of balls connected by springs (six springs per atom, one to connect to each neighbor). The springs represent the atomic forces between the atoms. Then you can imagine that a small vibration of one of the atoms could be transferred to each of it&apos;s neighbors, and so on down the line. You can get periodic waves, like a vibrating crystal (think piezo electric buzzer) or a soliton, that is an isolated wave pulse (and probably other wave types I haven&apos;t thoughta).</p><p>It turns out that the vibrations in a crystaline lattice (or any continuous almost incompressible media) can be modelled as a quantum system. That means that the energy of any particular frequency of vibration take on only a certain set of discrete values, as if your amp could put out, say, only 11 distinct volumes. Because of the quantum mechanical nature of phonons, they can be viewed as particles or waves. When two waves interact, it can be viewed as the creation and/or destruction of sound &quot;particles&quot;, phonons. These &quot;particles&quot; have a constant momentum (mass times velocity) because the velocity is fixed at the velocity of sound in the medium, and the energy is fixed, due to the discrete values of energy.</p><p>So sound waves in an almost incompressible medium can be modelled as a kind of particle. That is the extent of my knowledge. Some of it may be a little off, but it is essentially correct (I hope!) So if you had **really** sensitive hearing, perhaps you could hear the discrete volume levels as you pumped up the exitation of a crystal oscillator.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
