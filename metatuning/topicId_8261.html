I&apos;ve watched<br/>as things developed over the last ten years, and I&apos;ve tried to pay<br/>attention to the trends as well as to the areas I&apos;ve participated in<br/>as well.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t take a lot of searching to find material such as the following:</p><p>&quot;While authors of list messages implicitly agree to share their<br/>intellectual property through the list and its archive, the writers<br/>retain all the copyright privileges of their messages.&quot; [from the<br/>public policy statement of a mailing list]</p><p>There must be no shortage of opinions (legal and otherwise), both<br/>foreign and domestic, on all sides of the issue. One of the<br/>organizations I have always looked to for leadership in this area is<br/>the Electronic Frontier Foundation (<a href="http://www.eff.org/">http://www.eff.org/</a>). Their<br/>masthead mission statement/description is to the point:</p><p>&quot;EFF is a nonprofit group of passionate people Â— lawyers, volunteers,<br/>and visionaries Â— working to protect your digital rights.&quot;</p><p>I think most people in this discussion will already be familiar with<br/>them. One may or may not agree with one or more of their viewpoints or<br/>agendas, but in an area that is hardly settled, they have a long track<br/>record of very effective action.</p><p>So I note that on their very own public mailing list, ACTION (I forget<br/>the acronym), they include the following in the terms of agreement as<br/>you join the list:</p><p>&quot;You own your own words.  Subject to a vote altering these provisions<br/>(e.g. allowing full archival of list traffic or some such), all<br/>postings are to be considered copyrighted by their posters (unless<br/>otherwise noted). Neither EFF nor anyone else has any rights to your<br/>content, nor to the content as a &quot;collective work&quot;.</p><p>It is presumed that posts marked &quot;press release&quot;, &quot;please distribute&quot;,<br/>&quot;announcement&quot;, &quot;news&quot; or otherwise indicative that distribution is<br/>allowed, or having the character of an announcement of some sort, are<br/>in fact redistributable unless otherwise noted (e.g. &quot;discussion<br/>draft, please do not repost&quot; means what it says.)  It is presumed that<br/>anything indicating specifically that it is for this list only is not<br/>to be forwarded to others, and that all other posts, incl. those not<br/>marked, are OK to forward to other individuals with instructions not<br/>to repost, but may not be forwarded to other forums or otherwise<br/>publicly reposted.&quot;</p><p>I believe the above is proper and just.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=8263 href="#8263">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2004 7:54:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jon,</p><p>&gt; &quot;You own your own words. Subject to a vote altering these provisions<br/>&gt; (e.g. allowing full archival of list traffic or some such), all<br/>&gt; postings are to be considered copyrighted by their posters (unless<br/>&gt; otherwise noted).

Nice to have such a clear statement of it.</p><p>I&apos;m sure it has to be opt in - unless someone feels like<br/>paying a lawyer to investigate it professionally.<br/>Anyway even if it were legally okay there is the<br/>matter that you treat with consideration the<br/>views of people you respect about their own<br/>copyright material.</p><p>There will be plenty of interesting material<br/>in the archive as it is - all of Margo Schulter&apos;s<br/>posts for one. Also all of Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>and many others.</p><p>Also something else to note. The archives<br/>will be searchable in google - I made that<br/>clear that it was public when asking<br/>for permission. Each page will have<br/>a header that links to a page<br/>where you can opt into the list<br/>by sending me an e-mail. So anyone<br/>active in the field of tuning is likely<br/>to come across it once it gets properly<br/>indexed in google. So even if they have<br/>left the list long ago, so long as they<br/>are still alive and active in tuning<br/>theory or practice, there is a good chance<br/>they will find out about it in time<br/>and can ask to have their posts added back<br/>in. So maybe gaps will gradually get<br/>filled in that way too.</p><p>Also another thing. I&apos;ve felt all along<br/>that this archive is only an interim<br/>thing and that hopefully once in this<br/>form some incentive may arise for people<br/>to rework their posts in some other<br/>format. If anyone wants to be sent<br/>an archive in the same format but<br/>consisting of just their own posts so<br/>that they can rework them<br/>all then I can do that - and it doesn&apos;t<br/>matter if they have opted in or not.<br/>It is understandable that members<br/>who haven&apos;t opted in may want to<br/>be sent their posts so that they<br/>can rework them into something they<br/>find acceptable for future archiving<br/>in some other format later.</p><p>Manuel and I had plans to make the<br/>archive available on CD. It will<br/>also be uploaded as one enourmous<br/>zip file so that visitors can<br/>download that and read it off-line.<br/>The zip is a lot smaller than<br/>100 Mb because the html has a lot of<br/>repetition and compresses<br/>dramatically - I can&apos;t remember exactly<br/>but it was sort of more like the size<br/>of a large mp3.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=8264 href="#8264">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2004 8:32:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I&apos;m no lawyer, and I&apos;m far from an expert on copyright,</p><p>I can tell.</p><p>&gt; cyberspace (there must be a better word than that...),</p><p>The EFF uses it, it must be right.</p><p>&gt; It doesn&apos;t take a lot of searching to find material such<br/>&gt; as the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;While authors of list messages implicitly agree to share</p><p>That&apos;s how they run their list, and it&apos;s pretty standard<br/>practice, but I&apos;m not aware of it being challenged in<br/>court.
