Who cares, is right.</p><p>I mean, composers write music because they *enjoy* writing it.  At<br/>least that&apos;s why *I* do it.  I&apos;m not thinking of any posterity<br/>(although I am happy it is true that many of my works are in the New<br/>York Public Library...)</p><p>If people like the music, they will play it and there will still be<br/>listeners for it.  Sure, the contemporary music scene never will have<br/>the *hoards* of pop music listeners.  So what?  There is still an<br/>active &quot;new music&quot; scene in New York and elsewhere, with sometimes<br/>several concerts on the same night.  People go to these concerts and<br/>enjoy them.  Sure, the content has changed, and people are more<br/>willing to accept pop-influenced works.  I think that is good, since<br/>it&apos;s a dynamic more reflective of our own time.</p><p>The lament is preliminary.  I&apos;ll bet people will continue to attend<br/>and enjoy contemporary music concerts *at least* the rest of my own<br/>lifetime, particularly since the work are, presently, a bit easier<br/>for the audience to &quot;get a handle on...&quot;</p><p>J.

Don&apos;t forget, *I&apos;m* the one that posits rhythm as being the simplest of music&apos;s tasks, so it makes sense for the low-gene-pool type to gravitate towards the skins.</p><p>Then again, perspective has a lot to do with it. Probably lots of drummers lament the lack of good, solid, team-oriented (and ensemble oriented) guitarists, rather than the run-of-the-mill rock-star wannabees who turn up to 11, go scam some babes while everyone else is packing up the equipment, and drink more than the rest of the band combined.</p><p>But, yeah, drummers are a sorry lot quite often. Maybe you&apos;ve just bumped into the wrong ones, or too small a sampling. I could name 10 here in San Diego that are killer players, take care of biz, are fun to hang with, and family men to boot. Not a slacker in the bunch.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
