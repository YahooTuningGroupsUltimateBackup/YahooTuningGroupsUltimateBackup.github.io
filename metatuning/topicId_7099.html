Without corroborative evidence from other sources,<br/>or physical proof of some sort, ten anecdotes are no better than<br/>one, and a hundred anecdotes are no better than one, and a<br/>hundred anecdotes are not better than ten. Anecdotes are told by<br/>fallible human storytellers.

It appears in Benade&apos;s text<br/>on acoustics as a &quot;just-so&quot; story.</p><p>The reason Aaron K. Johnson cites Benade&apos;s anecdote is<br/>that Aaron K. Johnson is reading from David Doty&apos;s &quot;Just<br/>Intonation Primer&quot; and David Doty cites this anecdote<br/>by Benade as the sole supporting piece of experimental<br/>evidence in favor of 5-limit just intonation.</p><p>The reason why David Doty cites only this one anecdotal<br/>&quot;just so&quot; story by Arthur Benade as the sole supporting<br/>piece of experimental evidence in favor of 5-limit just<br/>intonation is that David Doty could not find any<br/>evidence in the peer-reviewed scientific literature<br/>on psychoacoustics to support Doty&apos;s claims about<br/>5-limit just intonation.  There is no evidence in<br/>the peer-reviewed scientific literature on<br/>psychoacoustics to support claims about a &quot;special<br/>relationship&quot; produced by small integer ratios.<br/>As a result, David Doty found himself forced to<br/>fall back on this anecdote by Arthur Benade -- an<br/>anecdote which was never published in a peer-<br/>reviewed scientific journal.</p><p>The reason why Arthur Benade never published in<br/>a peer-reviewed scientific journal his findings<br/>about &quot;special relationships&quot; among small integer<br/>ratios and sustained tones is simple.</p><p>Arthur Benade&apos;s claim about &quot;special relationships&quot;<br/>where subjects apparantly found 2/1, 3/2, 5/4, 7/4,<br/>etc by tuning oscillators did not get published<br/>in a peer-reviewed scientific journal because<br/>Benade couldn&apos;t get his findings published<br/>in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.</p><p>Benade didn&apos;t get his findings about &quot;special<br/>relationships&quot; published in a peer-reviewed<br/>scientific journal because Benade&apos;s claims<br/>fail to meet the most basic criteria of a<br/>scientific experiment, and they are also<br/>contradicted by a wealth of other genuine<br/>psychoacoustics experiments that did get<br/>published in peer-reviewed scientific<br/>journals.  As a result Benade&apos;s anecdote<br/>would have been rejected by a peer-reviewed<br/>pscyoacoustics journal in a hot minute.<br/>This explains why he published his anecdote<br/>only in a textbook on acoustics, not in<br/>a psychouastics journal.</p><p>Benade&apos;s &quot;special relationships&quot; test does<br/>not qualify as a scientific experiment<br/>because it does not include a control group,<br/>the findings were never statistically analyzed,<br/>Benade made no apparent serious effort to<br/>falsify his hypothesis, his test subjects<br/>were drawn from an intensely biased subgroup,<br/>there was no apparent experimental design<br/>to avoid problems of intrasubject and<br/>intersubject variability, no effort was made<br/>to use either slightly or significantly<br/>inharmonic sustained tones, no precautions<br/>seem to have been taken to avoid external cues<br/>or other forms of cheating, and last but<br/>not least, the test boils down to nothing<br/>but a measure of the degree to which students<br/>had been indoctrinated with the beliefs<br/>which Benade fed them -- which is to<br/>say that Benade made no effort to<br/>ascertain whether, even if his findings<br/>had been valid, they were due to nature<br/>or nurture.</p><p>I will now explain each of these failures<br/>in Benade&apos;s ancedotal just-so story and<br/>detail the specific reasons why Benade&apos;s<br/>ancedote about the &quot;special relationships&quot;<br/>test does not qualify as a scientific<br/>experiment and would have been rejected<br/>by any peer-reviewed scientific journal<br/>on psychoacoustics or cognitve psychology.</p><p>Problem 1: Like the group of people who<br/>give testimonials for the magical magnetic<br/>pain-relieving q-ray bracelet, Arthur<br/>Benade&apos;s test subjects did not include<br/>a control group. In late-nite informercials<br/>we hear plenty of &quot;just-so&quot; stories about<br/>how the magical magnetic q-ray bracelet<br/>relieves pain, but we never hear from<br/>a control group -- that is to say, we<br/>never hear from a group of people who<br/>tried the magical magnetic q-ray bracelet<br/>and did not experience a reduction in pain.<br/>The reason why we don&apos;t hear from a control<br/>group in the late-night magnetic pain<br/>bracelet infomercials is simple -- because<br/>we would then discover that some people<br/>found the magnetic pain-relieving bracelet<br/>seemed to erelieve their pain but many<br/>other people would testify that the<br/>magical magnetic pain-relievigin q-ray<br/>bracelet did nothing at all, and this<br/>woudl give the wrong (read: true)<br/>impression.  Likewise, Arthur Benade<br/>never took small children too young<br/>to have been brainwashed by Western<br/>music thoery; Benade never used that<br/>group for the hearing test with his<br/>variable oscillator.<br/>It transpires that other psychoacoustics<br/>researchers did take small children too<br/>young to have been brainwashed by<br/>Western music theory and they did<br/>perform variable-oscillator tests<br/>of the kind Benade describes. They<br/>also performed fixed-oscillator tests<br/>with questions about the perceived<br/>musical consonance of the intervals.</p><p>&quot;In a laboratory study, Van de Geer<br/>et al, (1962) found that intervals<br/>judged the most consonant by laymen<br/>do not correspond to the group usually<br/>termed consonant. This result is<br/>elaborated by recent work by Fuda and<br/>Wessel (1977).&quot; [Risset, Jean-Claude,<br/>&quot;Musical Acoustics,&quot; Rapports IRCAM,<br/>1978, pp. 7-8]</p><p>By using proper control groups, Van<br/>de Geer &amp; Levelt &amp; Plomp (1962) and<br/>Fuda &amp; Wessel (1977) eliminated the<br/>obvious problem we see from a biased<br/>population in the late-nite magnetic<br/>pain-relieving bracelet infomercials.<br/>In a properly conducted scientific<br/>experiment with an adequate control<br/>group, the result is that both the<br/>claims about the magnetic pain-<br/>relieving bracelet and Benade&apos;s<br/>claims about &quot;special relationships&quot;<br/>collapse.</p><p>Notice that it is unnecessary to<br/>conduct further psychoacoustic<br/>experiments along these lines,<br/>since multiple experiments have<br/>already been conducted and the<br/>findings have been replicated<br/>and published in the peer-reviewed<br/>scientific literature.  To a<br/>scientist, that&apos;s the end of<br/>the story. Case closed. Of<br/>course, to the pseudoscientists<br/>like Paul &quot;All Numerology, No<br/>Scientific Method&quot; Erlich and<br/>Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot;<br/>Smith and Carl &quot;Infinite<br/>Gullibility&quot; Lumma who dominate<br/>the Alternative Wanking List,<br/>such published scientific<br/>results are doubtless not<br/>sufficient. Without question<br/>these masterminds will tell us<br/>that we need _more_ scientific<br/>testing to be sure -- just<br/>as the proponents of cold<br/>fusion assure us that we<br/>need &quot;more testing&quot; to clarify<br/>matters, and just as the<br/>advocates of pyramid power<br/>will tell us &quot;the matter is<br/>not settled and needs to be<br/>looked into further in more<br/>experiments.&quot; Standard operating<br/>procedure for pseudoscientists.</p><p>REFERENCES:<br/>Risset, Jean-Claude, &quot;Musical<br/>Acoustics,&quot; Rapports IRCAM,<br/>1978, pp. 7-8.<br/>Warren, R., &quot;Auditory Perception:<br/>A New Synthesis,&quot; McMillan<br/>&amp; Co.: New York, 1985, pg. 74<br/>Pikler, A.

There<br/>will always be anomalous data<br/>points and some range of variation<br/>in the results. A reputable scientist<br/>wishes to know: how many of the data<br/>points are anomalous?  How often do<br/>they show up?  How large is the range<br/>of variation in the experimental<br/>results?  If the range of variation<br/>is large enough, it can cast doubt<br/>on the experimental findings. Likewise,<br/>if there are too many anomalous data<br/>points, or if the person performing<br/>the experiment found himself forced to<br/>throw out an excessive number of bad<br/>data points, we want to know this because<br/>it could seriously compromise the<br/>credibility of the experiment.<br/>Michael Shermer gives an example of<br/>how the failure to statistically<br/>analyze the results of an experiment<br/>lead to pseudoscience:</p><p>In a test for ESP using an ESP-testing<br/>machine with 5 possible answers (plus,<br/>square, star, circle, wavy lines) at the<br/>Edgar Cayce Association For Research and<br/>Enlightenment &quot;the instructor explained<br/>that &grave;5 right [out of 25 trials] is<br/>average, chance is between 3 and 7,<br/>and anything above 7 is evidence for<br/>ESP.&apos; (..) I then surveyed the group.<br/>In the first set [of 25 trials], three<br/>people got 2 right, while another three<br/>got 8 right; in the second set, one<br/>even got 9 right. So, while I apparently<br/>did not have psychic power, at least<br/>four other people did. Or did they?<br/>&quot;Before concluding that high scores<br/>indicate a high degree of ESP<br/>ability, you have to know what<br/>kind of scores people would get merely<br/>by chance. The scores expected by chance<br/>can be predicted by probability theory<br/>and statistical analysis. Scientists<br/>use comparison ebtween statistically<br/>produced test results and actual test<br/>results to determine whether results<br/>are significant, that is, better than<br/>what would be expected by chance. The<br/>ESP test results clearly matched the<br/>expected pattern for random results.<br/>&quot;I explained to the group &grave;In the<br/>first set [of 25 trials], three got<br/>2, three got 8, and everyone else<br/>(twenty-nine people) scored between<br/>3 and 7. In the second set, there was<br/>one 9, two 2s and one 1, _all scored by<br/>different people than those who scored<br/>high and low in the first test!_ Doesn&apos;t<br/>that sound like a normal distribution<br/>around an average of 5?&apos; (..)<br/>&quot;On a piece of scrap paper, I drew a<br/>crude version of the normal frequency<br/>curve, more commonly known as the bell<br/>curve (see figure 6), explained that<br/>the mean, or average number, of correct<br/>responses (&grave;hits&apos;) is expected by chance<br/>to be 5 (5 out of 25). The amount that<br/>the number of hits will deviate from the<br/>standard mean of 5 by chance, is 2. Thus,<br/>for a group this size, we should not put<br/>any secial signifiance on the fact that<br/>someone scored only 1 or 2 correct hits.<br/>This is exactly what is expected to<br/>happen by chance.<br/>&quot;So these test results suggest that<br/>nothing other than chance was operating.<br/>The deviation from the mean for this<br/>experiment was nothing more than what<br/>we would expect.&quot; [Shermer, Michael,<br/>&quot;Why People Believe Weird Things:<br/>Pseudoscience, Superstition, and other<br/>Confusions Of Our Time,&quot; W. H. Freeman<br/>and Company: New York, 1997, pp. 69-70]</p><p>In Arthur Benade&apos;s test we should like<br/>to have the actual data. But Benade<br/>did not give the actual data in his<br/>ancedotal account of the test, nor<br/>did he offer any statistical analysis --<br/>Benade merely summarizing the results<br/>of his test. That is suspciiously similar<br/>to the ESP tests performed at the Edgar<br/>Cayce Institute, and countless other<br/>factories of junkthink and pseudoscience.</p><p>Problem 3: Benade made no apparent<br/>serious attempt to falsify his hypothesis.<br/>Common sense tells us you need to do more<br/>than search for confirming evidence.<br/>This could easily and simply have been<br/>done. Benade could have run one set of<br/>tests using oscillators an harmonic<br/>serise timbre. Then Benade could have<br/>run another series of tests using<br/>oscillators set to inharmonic<br/>relationships. If the test subjects<br/>in the second set of tests still find<br/>the &quot;special relationships&quot; even with<br/>an inharmonic timbre, then we would<br/>be justified in concluding that<br/>Benade&apos;s &quot;special relationships&quot; are<br/>indeed genetically engraved into the<br/>human auditory system. If, however,<br/>the &quot;special relationships&quot; do not<br/>show up in the second set of tests<br/>which use an inharmonic timbre, then<br/>we may justifiably conclude that<br/>the Benade&apos;s test subjects were<br/>not detecting small integer ratios<br/>at all. Instead, all Benade&apos;s test<br/>subject were doing was detecting<br/>whether the partials line up.</p><p>As it happens, these experiments<br/>have been performed, and they<br/>prove conclusively that listeners<br/>cannot detect small integer ratios<br/>in the absence of auditory cues<br/>from the lining-up of partials.</p><p>&quot;Helmholtz (1867) links the degree<br/>of dissonance to the audibility of<br/>beats between the partials of the<br/>tones. This theory is hardly tenable<br/>becaus the patternof beats for a given<br/>interval depends very much on the<br/>placement of the interval within<br/>the auditory frequency range. Recent<br/>observations (Plomp, 1966) suggest an<br/>improved physical explanation of<br/>consonance: listeners find that<br/>the dissonance of a pair of tones<br/>is at a maximum when the partials<br/>are about a quarter of a critical<br/>bandwidth apart: the tones are<br/>judged consonant when the partials<br/>are more than a critical bandwidth<br/>apart.&quot; [Risset, Jean-Claude,<br/>&quot;Musical Acoustics,&quot; Rapports IRCAM,<br/>1978, pp. 7-8]</p><p>REFERENCES:</p><p>Pierce, J.

The<br/>people Benade tested were students whom<br/>he had spoon-fed his speculations about<br/>musical consonance and the harmonic<br/>series. When different non-biased<br/>populations are tested, they hear<br/>different relationships among both<br/>harmonic series and inharmonic series<br/>tones (see Van de Geer and Plomp and<br/>Mimpen, above).<br/>How representative are Benade&apos;s students<br/>of the general musical population? Did<br/>the degree to which Benade conditioned<br/>his subjects by extensively lecturing<br/>on &quot;special relationships&quot; twixt integer<br/>ratio tones have any effect on their<br/>test results?</p><p>&quot;We must always remmember the larger<br/>context in which a seemingly unusual<br/>event occurs, and we must always analyze<br/>unusual events for their representativeness<br/>of thei class of phenomena. In this case<br/>of the &grave;Bermuda Triangle,&apos; an area of the<br/>Atlantic Ocean where ships and planes<br/>&grave;mysteriously&apos; disappear, ther eis the<br/>assumption that osmething strange or alien<br/>is at work. But we must consider how<br/>representative such events are in that<br/>area. Far more shipping lanes run through<br/>the Bermuda Triangle than in surrounding<br/>areas, so accidents and mishaps and<br/>disappearnces are more liley to happen<br/>in the area.&quot; [Shermer, Michael,<br/>&quot;Why People Believe Weird Things:<br/>Pseudoscience, Superstition, and other<br/>Confusions Of Our Time,&quot; W. H. Freeman<br/>and Company: New York, 1997, pp. 54-55]</p><p>Problem 5:  There was no apparent experimental<br/>design to avoid problems of intrasubject and<br/>intersubject variability.  An experiment<br/>must be carefully designed and the possible<br/>outcomes analyzed beforehand using statistical<br/>methods to make sure that unusual data<br/>points are not the result of pure chance,<br/>or subjects who give an unusually wide range<br/>of variable response. Benade never tells us<br/>the confidence intervals for his test, nor<br/>does he give us the raw data, nor does he<br/>specify the results of a Students T-distribution<br/>or a chi square test on his test results.<br/>Instead, Benade merely gies us an unsupported<br/>ancedote sans data, sans analysis.</p><p>Problem 6: no effort was made to use either<br/>slightly or significantly inharmonic sustained<br/>tones. By designing an experiment in which<br/>slightly inharmonic tones are contrasted<br/>with perfectly harmonic tones using chorus<br/>effects, it can be determined whether<br/>perception of smoothness is the product<br/>of Benade&apos;s claimed &quot;special relationships&quot;<br/>between small integers, or whether the<br/>perceived smoothness results from a<br/>mere lack of beats. As it happens, this<br/>experiment has been performed. In his<br/>PhD thesis the current editor of the<br/>Computer Music Journal, Douglas Keislar,<br/>found no special relationship between<br/>small integers.</p><p>REFERENCES:<br/>Keislar, Douglas, Psychoacoustic Factors<br/>In Musical Intonation: Beats, Interval<br/>Tuning, and Inharmonicity.

The most<br/>obvoius external cue here is the<br/>degree of rotation of the dial or<br/>te length of travel of a slider used<br/>to control the variable oscillator.<br/>J. B. Rhine and other psychic researchers<br/>neglected to account for these kinds<br/>of external cues, and as a result their<br/>ESP experiments prdouced tainted results<br/>and proved worthless.</p><p>Problem 8: the test boils down to nothing<br/>but a measure of the degree to which students<br/>had been indoctrinated with the beliefs<br/>which Benade fed them.<br/>Music students tested with tones whose<br/>timbres are harmonic but which exhibit<br/>a different distribution of overtone<br/>amplitudes than benade used are likely<br/>to give different responses than Benade&apos;s<br/>test subjects:</p><p>&quot;As an application of the consoanne theory,<br/>effects of hamronic structure onm the c<br/>sonconance chacteristics are discussed.<br/>(..) It became claer that the fifth<br/>was not always a consonant interval. A<br/>chord of two tones that consists of only<br/>odd harmonic , for example, shows much<br/>worse consonance at the fifth (2:3)<br/>than t athe major sixth (3:5) or some<br/>other frequency ratios. This was proved<br/>true by psychological exeriemnts carried out in<br/>another institute (sensory Inspection<br/>Committee in th Japan Union of Scientists<br/>and Engineers) with a different method<br/>of scaling. Thus, the facts warns against<br/>making a mistake in applying the conventional<br/>theory of harmony to synthesi musical<br/>tones that can take variety in the<br/>harmonic structure.&quot; [Kameoka, A.<br/>and Kuriyagawa, M., Consonance Theory<br/>Part II: Consonance Of Complex Tones<br/>And Its Calculation Method,&quot; J.

As a result<br/>those who indoctrinate others with<br/>a belief system, as Benade did to<br/>his students, typically prefer only to<br/>perform tests on the students they<br/>have indoctrinated.  This creates a<br/>feedback loop in whihc indosctrination<br/>creates a belief system which, when tested,<br/>confirms the belief system -- and hte results<br/>of the test are then used as the basis for<br/>further indoctrination, which in turns<br/>strengthens the belief system...and so on.<br/>We see this kind of feedback loop, in which<br/>indoctrination produces bias which when tested<br/>confirms the bias and leads to more alleged<br/>support for the indoctrination, most clearly<br/>in the recent &quot;repressed memory&quot; craze:</p><p>&quot;The feedback loop for the movement<br/>now bean to self-organize, encouranged<br/>by psychotherapist Jeffrey Masson&apos;s<br/>1984 book The Assault On Truth, in<br/>which he rejected Freud&apos;s claim that<br/>childhood sexual abuse was fantasy<br/>and argued that Freud&apos;s initial position --<br/>that hte sexual abuse so often recounted<br/>by his pateints was actual, rampant, and<br/>responsible for adult women&apos;s neuroses --<br/>was the correct one.
