In the case of at least one piece,<br/>&quot;The Human Equation&quot; by a group called &quot;Ayreon&quot;, my initial assessment<br/>included &quot;soulless&quot; among its negative points. But it&apos;s still<br/>compelling to me, and I doubt it would be compelling in the same way<br/>to many other people, but that&apos;s the nature of art.</p><p>I think this compelling quality is something completely<br/>extra-critical, not something that can be talked about or even<br/>described. It leaves me at a loss, though, because my friends are<br/>often very harshly critical, inclined to pick apart anything they see<br/>and pass judgment on it. I do it too, and it&apos;s hard to explain why I<br/>would watch a movie, or listen to an album, that I know is offensive,<br/>poorly executed, pandering, or a whole host of other things.</p><p>--TRISTAN<br/>Dreaming of Eden is a Comic with no Pictures<br/><a href="http://dreamingofeden.smackjeeves.com">http://dreamingofeden.smackjeeves.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=11520 href="#11520">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2007 1:55:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>yes art does not have to make sense or explainable and can work for reasons besides even the artist&apos;s intention.<br/>very few people could even stand an hour with Van Gogh.</p><p>Rozencrantz the Sane wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Every once in a while I will come across something that, in any<br/>&gt; criteria I can define, is bad.
