He<br/>wrote a book on 19-tone Equal Temperament. His exposure to and interest in<br/>Chinese music theories may have been a factor in _his_ theory that 19tET was the<br/>next step after 12tET.</p><p>    The Yiddish Anarchist movement has its early roots in Berlin, London and<br/>New York City. Some famous Yiddish Anarchists: Emma Goldman, Alexander<br/>Berkman, Gustav Landauer, Rudolf Rocker (though not Jewish, he edited a Yiddish<br/>Anarchist journal)... it is possible that the mysterious anarchist &quot;B. Traven&quot;,<br/>author of _The Treasure of the Sierra Madre_, a.k.a. Ret Marut a.k.a Otto Feige,<br/>was Yiddish...</p><p>    China&apos;s own Anarchist writer par excellence Ba Jin (Li Feigan) was<br/>influenced by Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. He translated works by Kropotkin,<br/>Goldman, Rocker and many others. He wrote several realistic novels about<br/>contemporary Chinese family life and lifestyles noted for their sharp insights into<br/>how even the smallest of interactions have larger socio-cultural<br/>implications. His _nom de guerre_ &quot;Ba Jin&quot; is made - _mutatus mutandi_ -of the Ba as in<br/>BAkunin and the Kin as in KropotKIN.</p><p>    Linguistics theorist and socio-political critic/commentator Noam Chomsky<br/>is also from a Jewish libertarian socialist lineage. (&quot;Libertarian socialist&quot;<br/>is just another way of saying &quot;anarchist&quot; w/o the loaded stereotyping of<br/>Anarchists as being gun-toting Sacco and Vanzettis or bomb-throwers or &quot;punks&quot;<br/>[&quot;lifestyle anarchists&quot;, posers, as pacifist anarchist Paul Goodman calls<br/>them...]) Chomsky is up there with Bill Moyers and Ralph Nader... way more radical.<br/>And intellectually hard-minded.</p><p>    Leo Tolstoy, though no Jew, is the figurehead of pacifistic Christian<br/>Anarchism. The Christian Anarchist Tolstoy Society in London was of course named<br/>after him.</p><p>    Gandhi was influenced by Tolstoy. The Civil Rights Movement in the US was<br/>directly influenced by the non-violent resistance strategies of Gandhi. The<br/>&quot;Village Movement&quot; in India was and is influenced by Gandhi and Kropotkin and<br/>is the basis of the All-India Green Party, which has direct and strong ties<br/>with other Green Parties world-wide.</p><p>    Fascinating the web of &quot;hidden&quot; and &quot;lost&quot; history be...<br/>    WE are all more connected than WE usually realize.</p><p>---<br/>Hanuman Zhang, _Gomi no sensei_ [Master of junk]</p><p>    &quot;To live is to scrounge, taking what you can in order to survive. So,<br/>since living is scrounging, the result of our efforts is to amass a pile of<br/>rubbish.&quot;  - Chuang Tzu/Zhuangzi, China, 4th Century BCE</p><p>&quot;The most beautiful order is a heap of sweepings piled up at random.&quot; -<br/>Heraclitus, Greece, 5th Century BCE</p><p>    &quot;...So what is life for?
