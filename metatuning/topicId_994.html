A cute little bomb that prepares<br/>flowers for display in vases.</p><p>When I was an active pilot, I had to be aware of military routes,<br/>places that, if not forbidden, were known to be dangerous because of<br/>heavy military practice traffic.  I remember reading that the name of<br/>one of those routes in my area, &quot;Oil Burner&quot;, had been deemed<br/>politically incorrect.  Mind you, the amount of oil consumed did not<br/>diminish, but the name was changed to &quot;Olive Branch&quot;.  Much better!</p><p>How about the euphemism &quot;carpet bomb&quot;?  I see it used in the news every<br/>day (because the U.S. is doing it now), and I know what it means, but I<br/>search in vain for an explanation for those who may not know.  Such a<br/>soft sound: lying on a carpet, or bombing a carpet, it almost seems<br/>benign, but of course it means bombing the holy poop out of every square<br/>inch of earth over a huge area, as might be covered by a giant<br/>wall-to-wall carpet.  Wall-to-wall death.</p><p>It seems very strange to me, what terms are defined regularly and what<br/>terms are not.  About ten times a day I read yet another story about<br/>anthrax, which goes to great lengths to clarify, &quot;anthrax is a<br/>bacterium that can kill its victim, and is considered to be an agent of<br/>biological warfare, blah blah.&quot;  Yeah, I just read that five minutes<br/>ago!  Now tell me the meaning of &quot;carpet bomb&quot; some time, would ya?</p><p>JdL</p></div>
