<a href="/metatuning">back to list</a><h1>When criticism is healthy</h1><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2001 8:57:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>Even though I wasn&apos;t even in the act of offering or promoting<br/>criticism, you seemed to read it that way, and you went out of your<br/>way to then mention everyone you could that you like and offer<br/>congratulations on their work. You are welcome to do that.</p><p>However, your contention that criticism is completely unwarranted<br/>rings hollow (to me), as if you were afraid to have alternate<br/>opinions. I wouldn&apos;t ever offer up an opinion on someone&apos;s music<br/>specifically unless they asked for it, and in most give-and-take<br/>forums it is taken for *granted* that work in progress gets batted<br/>about, because the discussions pro and con about what worked and what<br/>didn&apos;t is healthy. But that is up to individual people when they post<br/>their music, and I&apos;d never pick on a particular piece unless someone<br/>asked. Seems like many of the composer/performers around here aren&apos;t<br/>so sensitive as you make out.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if she is outside of your &apos;interest radar&apos; but I saw a<br/>bit in a story on songwriter/singer Lucinda Williams that follows<br/>along these lines:</p><p>-------</p><p>Her love of words and the arrangement of them so as to convey<br/>powerful emotions appear to be something of a family tradition.<br/>Williams&apos; father is poet Miller Williams, who read a poem at<br/>President Bill Clinton&apos;s second inauguration. Miller Williams is not<br/>only a poet but an editor and a professor at the University of<br/>Arkansas in Fayetteville. A music fan as well as a literary scholar,<br/>he said he likes to surround himself with the worlds of jazz, country<br/>and literature when he writes in his study.</p><p>&quot;Over the years, I would just show him my songs,&quot; she said. &quot;And he<br/>would critique them and make suggestions. And that&apos;s how I learned.&quot;</p><p>-------</p><p>I very much respect the personal nature of creation, and it seems<br/>that music is at least as personal as any of the art forms, maybe<br/>more? So how it strikes a person should be admitted with tact and<br/>care, not with a poison pen. OTOH, if the only thing you do is<br/>cheerlead and say everything is swell, you opinion becomes,<br/>essentially, worthless, because it doesn&apos;t distinguish between weak<br/>and strong work.</p><p>Even if it is only one opinion, that can be helpful to a creator in<br/>their work. Simply stating that you don&apos;t scroll down a long page<br/>gives me pause to consider re-organizing a page, since even one set<br/>of eyeballs not getting all the info is not good. If you had only<br/>told me &quot;those are great web pages&quot; the critical element is lost and<br/>I might not think to change things. And, of course, I thanked you for<br/>the comment.</p><p>I value the community of the tuning list enough that I welcome and<br/>consider the critiques of my work and writings. You may prefer it<br/>otherwise, but you shouldn&apos;t assume that everyone is so sensitive to<br/>probing questions about their work.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>jpehrson@...</h3><span>6/30/2001 9:15:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/305">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/305</a></p><p>Hi Jon...</p><p>It would be hard to disagree with your comments that criticism in<br/>many cases is warranted, and put to good use.</p><p>HOWEVER, in the field of &quot;modern music&quot; I believe you will find, in<br/>such august publications as the New York Times and others, a penchant<br/>for &quot;having to be critical&quot; whether a piece or composer deserves it<br/>or not...</p><p>So, the solution is always to praise the &quot;established&quot; composer...<br/>the Elliott Carter or Milton Babbitt and dump on the &quot;newbie.&quot;  You<br/>may think that the criticism is warranted, but after seeing this<br/>happen time and time again, and after hearing many concerts, I have<br/>come to the opinion that this practice is unfair.</p><p>I know from my stint as a music critic on a college paper (a big<br/>college paper) that editors *expect* reviewers to be critical in<br/>practically every review, so they *have* to fit it in someplace.</p><p>So who gets it??

I<br/>don&apos;t give a flying cantus firmus about the NYT in this instance,<br/>because I am talking about a dialogue within the community.

It means you have to keep track of the<br/>harmony, by writing it down or otherwise.  So it goes from being a<br/>quick improvisation to a fairly involved composition, and usually<br/>doesn&apos;t get finished.  In this case, I didn&apos;t even do a MIDI<br/>recording, but I&apos;ve got the patch if I ever need to use the same<br/>sounds again.

The way it doesn&apos;t<br/>seem to be going anywhere is considered a design feature, right?  It<br/>shouldn&apos;t be so difficult to find variations that use the same unison<br/>vector.  As it stands, I moved up in 7:4 steps, and back by a 5-limit<br/>progression.

But! I preface these remarks that I honestly respect<br/>those who would prefer to not have their materials/creations/etc<br/>reviewed, most especially when they have asked for that consideration.</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., Gordon Rumson &lt;RUMSONG@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ... and this was the FIRST time I ever encountered this<br/>&gt; manner of teaching.  All of the teachers I had had before had<br/>&gt; been of the fault finding/denigrating variety.</p><p>As someone who has taught private students for 30 years, I feel<br/>saddened and ashamed that this was your experience. To those teachers<br/>that worked in this manner: you are consigned to the nether regions<br/>for eternity!</p><p>What more precious object is there than the student seeking guidance?</p><p>In that light, I have had different experiences. While I have had my<br/>share of teachers that were abusive, intolerant, and (worst) ignorant<br/>of my quests, I have had life-affirming and incredibly inspirational<br/>teachers. I wouldn&apos;t have spent so much time, and loved teaching as<br/>much as I do, if it weren&apos;t for these &apos;guiding lights&apos;. The first one<br/>was when I was in 5th grade, my first private music teacher, and<br/>while I am sure he never had a clue how much he did to shape my life,<br/>it happened.</p><p>He was *not* uncritical, but he was also nurturing and positive.</p><p>&gt; My experiences as a student (almost uniformly bad) made me very<br/>&gt; wary of criticizing others.</p><p>In light of your experiences, understandable, but not universal.</p><p>&gt; But the absence of criticism does not mean the absence of comment.</p><p>Yes, I suppose. Comment, as a term, is possibly more benign. However,<br/>I still believe that &quot;constructive criticism&quot; is *not* an oxymoron!</p><p>Hands-down, the very best mail list I&apos;ve ever been on is one that<br/>pertains to a minor sidelight of my interests (web design). This<br/>particular list broke off from a large, noisy one and from virtually<br/>day one to now, five years later, is a paragon of high signal/noise<br/>ratio, is populated by immensely talented people, many of them<br/>important in an industry but eager to &quot;give back&quot; to the community,<br/>and is very much involved in doing critiques of colleague&apos;s work.</p><p>Every so often someone new comes on the list, a site is put up for<br/>critique, and the newbie goes on some bashing run. Without<br/>hesitation, the mature voices remind them that there are important<br/>and necessary parameters to said criticism, that it must be work-<br/>centric and not personal, and should stay within the boundaries of<br/>the critique asked for.</p><p>I have witnessed immense growth in many of the individuals over time,<br/>due in large part to the caring, but sometimes near-merciless, fine-<br/>tooth-combing of a new project. Those that don&apos;t want critiques don&apos;t<br/>submit sites - it&apos;s as simple as that. I have learned far, far more<br/>than I could have in any other manner of education, because it&apos;s<br/>the &quot;best of the best&quot; looking at each other objectively and raising<br/>the bar a notch.</p><p>Music, admittedly, is a very different beast; on the web list, there<br/>are items that are strictly technical in nature that can be pointed<br/>out. OTOH, there are also elements of very personal style and taste,<br/>not unlike a composer&apos;s choices. If handled with respect, I think<br/>these can be looked at as well, but as someone else said, very easy<br/>to simply ask &quot;what do you think about the tuning?&quot; or<br/>instrumentation, or voice leading, or anything else, AND also<br/>state &quot;but I like my melody so don&apos;t go there!&quot;.</p><p>To come full circle, my original point was that if a group of<br/>colleagues and friends becomes merely a circle of humans patting each<br/>other on the back, the progress will be far less than if some of the<br/>patting is interrupted with an occasional dose of &quot;whazzup with that?&quot;</p><p>Or some other suitably erudite commentary... :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@...</h3><span>8/30/2001 5:52:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Because of many of these rather &quot;questionable&quot; practices, I have<br/>&gt; decided I no longer enjoy reviewing works of contemporaries...</p><p>When I asked for some recommendations I looked for reviews on<br/>Gramophone, and didn&apos;t find any.
