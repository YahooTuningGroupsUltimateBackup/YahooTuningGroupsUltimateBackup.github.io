And then one day sitting and listening to the complete<br/>&gt; recording (and it happend to be the Candide that LB did in London in<br/>&gt; the last year of his life) and realizing all the incredible music that<br/>&gt; is parsed into snippets in the overture!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There was recently a live production that NY Phil did on &quot;Great<br/>&gt; Performances&quot; (PBS) that introduced me to the incredible Kristin<br/>&gt; Chenowith, including her singing one of Bernstein&apos;s most incredible<br/>&gt; pieces of song, &quot;Glitter and Be Gay&quot;. Thanks to you for tweaking my<br/>&gt; memory on this, I&apos;ve just gone and searched and found it was released<br/>&gt; on DVD:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.image-entertainment.com/detail.cfm?productID=31995">http://www.image-entertainment.com/detail.cfm?productID=31995</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m gonna get it! The original production I mentioned in London has<br/>&gt; one great advantage in Adolph Green playing Pangloss, but this more<br/>&gt; recent one has a crakerjack cast, the band sounds great, and it was<br/>&gt; really fun watching it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sigh - occasionally music is still fun! :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=10262 href="#10262">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2005 8:33:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>this is often the case with allot of pieces.<br/>Do you think because composers  write from beginning to end, at least after the first couple of drafts?</p><p>kylegann1955 wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;I have to say, though, that the second half rarely equals the quality of the first, which is &gt;incredible - &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
