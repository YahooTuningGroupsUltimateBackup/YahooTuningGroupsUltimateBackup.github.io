In particular they seem to live in other<br/>places.  A lot of them are in America, even those in the UK don&apos;t live<br/>very near Clevedon.</p><p>So, I&apos;ve decided to fix this problem by setting up my own mailing list<br/>for microtonalists in the Clevedon area.  The web page is at</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/clevedon/">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/clevedon/</a>&gt;</p><p>or you can subscribe by sending e-mail to<br/>&lt;mailto:clevedon-subscribe@...&gt;.  Messages can be sent to<br/>the list at &lt;mailto:clevedon@...&gt;.</p><p>I hope this will resolve the &quot;other people&quot; problem of the Tuning List,<br/>and in some small way bring about the time when everybody can have a<br/>tuning list all of their own.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=64 href="#64">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>5/24/2001 9:50:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p><a href="/metatuning/topicId_62.html#62">/metatuning/topicId_62.html#62</a></p><p>You are quite right, Graham, you &quot;cracker...&quot;:</p><p>Each person should have his OWN list and also ONLY POST to his OWN<br/>list...!</p><p>That would solve many of these &quot;messy&quot; problems...</p><p>__________ ______ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=65 href="#65">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2001 10:29:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well graham you&apos;ll have to ban all others</p><p>jpehrson@... wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In metatuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/metatuning/topicId_62.html#62">/metatuning/topicId_62.html#62</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are quite right, Graham, you &quot;cracker...&quot;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each person should have his OWN list and also ONLY POST to his OWN<br/>&gt; list...!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would solve many of these &quot;messy&quot; problems...<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
