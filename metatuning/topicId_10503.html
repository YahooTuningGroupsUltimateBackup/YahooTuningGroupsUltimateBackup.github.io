And<br/>   His eyes are a flame of fire, and upon His head are<br/>   many diadems;...And He is clothed with a robe dipped<br/>   in blood; and His name is called The Word of God.<br/>   And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine<br/>   linen, white and clean, were following Him on white<br/>   horses. And from His mouth comes a sharp sword, so<br/>   that with it He may smite the nations; and He will<br/>   rule them with a rod of iron;...and on His robe and<br/>   on His thigh He has a name written, &quot;KING OF KINGS,<br/>   AND LORD OF LORDS.&quot;</p><p>   More here if you wish:</p><p>   And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried<br/>   out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds which<br/>   fly in midheaven, &quot;Come, assemble for the great supper<br/>   of God; in order that you may eat the flesh of kings<br/>   and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of mighty<br/>   men...&quot; And I saw the...kings of the earth and their<br/>   armies, assembled to make war against Him who sat upon<br/>   the horse, and His army...and the rest were killed with<br/>   the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sat<br/>   upon the horse, and all the birds were filled with<br/>   their flesh.</p><p>   I hope there were no typos in the above. You get the<br/>   idea. Jesus fulfilled his job as a suffering servant<br/>   many years ago.
