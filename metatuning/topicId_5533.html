And Mr. Bush<br/>said the United States might carry out other pre-emptive strikes.</p><p>&grave;&grave;No nation can be neutral in the struggle between civilization and<br/>chaos,&apos;&apos; Mr. Bush told members of the American Legion gathered in St.<br/>Louis for the<br/>group&apos;s convention.</p><p>&grave;&grave;We&apos;ve adopted a new strategy for a new kind of war,&apos;&apos; Mr. Bush said,<br/>to loud applause. &grave;&grave;We will not wait for known enemies to strike us<br/>again. We will<br/>strike them in their camps or caves or wherever they hide, before they<br/>hit more of our cities and kill more of our citizens.&apos;&apos;</p><p>&grave;&grave;We will do everything in our power to deny terrorists weapons of mass<br/>destruction before they can commit murder on an unimaginable scale,&apos;&apos;<br/>Mr. Bush<br/>said. &grave;&grave;The security of this nation, and our friends, requires decisive<br/>action, and with a broad coalition, we&apos;re taking that action around the<br/>globe. We are on<br/>the offensive against terror, and we will stay on the offensive against<br/>terror.&apos;&apos;</p><p>The president also repeated his vision of a Palestinian state living in<br/>peace with Israel. But he added, &grave;&grave;A Palestinian state will never be<br/>built on the foundation<br/>of violence,&apos;&apos; and he said organizations that helped to finance Middle<br/>East terrorism under the guise of charitable giving must be thwarted.</p><p>Mr. Bush&apos;s message of patriotism, conveyed with images from the beaches<br/>of Normandy in World War II to the sand of Iraq, seemed to go over well<br/>with the<br/>American Legion. So did his call for respect for the Stars and Stripes.</p><p>&grave;&grave;Having fought under the American flag and seen it folded and given to<br/>families of your friends, you are committed, as am I, to protecting the<br/>dignity of the<br/>flag and the Constitution of the United States,&apos;&apos; he said, to loud<br/>cheers.</p><p>Mr. Bush has never accused Iraq under Saddam Hussein of a direct role in<br/>the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But he has said many times that Mr.<br/>Hussein and his<br/>followers are of the same ilk as Al Qaeda terrorists. He asserted again<br/>today that what is left of Al Qaeda - &grave;&grave;wounded yet not destroyed&apos;&apos; -<br/>knows that the<br/>overthrow of Saddam Hussein &grave;&grave;is a defeat for them.&apos;&apos;</p><p>Mr. Bush was to head back this evening to his ranch in Texas, where he<br/>is vacationing. Part of his day in St. Louis included a Republican<br/>fund-raiser for<br/>Senator Christopher S. Bond, who is running for re-election in 2004. Mr.<br/>Bush carried Missouri and its 11 electoral votes in 2000, taking just<br/>over 50 percent<br/>of the popular vote. Vice President Al Gore got just over 47 percent,<br/>with Ralph Nader taking the remainder.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
