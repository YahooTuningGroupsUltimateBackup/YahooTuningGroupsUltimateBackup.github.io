This is a prime<br/>example of the shocking irresponsibility of the<br/>doctors, the media, and especially the pharmaceutical<br/>companies. Profit at any cost! Does ANYONE on the list<br/>think that staying awake indefinitely is perfectly safe<br/>and has no long-term consequences, even if it is now<br/>scientifically possible. Is anyone so naive to believe<br/>that this would not destroy the mind after a few years<br/>or months of use? if we are shocked and horrified by<br/>the bizarre crimes commited by people driven insane by<br/>SUI pharmas, we will think that NOTHING compared to<br/>what these people who are awake all the time will be<br/>like, if they survive long enough to see.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
