That researching the tunings becomes further and further removed from the music that could/would be made by the tunings, creating a pursuit of &apos;pure tuning research&apos; akin to &apos;pure math&apos;, and with relationships to &apos;recreational math&apos;.</p><p>So, as I say, I read it as very general in nature, and something reflecting on what even a casual observer could note if they lurked on the list for a couple of weeks. I don&apos;t find any of this new, and the subject has been raised before by others. However, I in no way read *into* his message the things *you* did. Did I read things *out* of it? I don&apos;t think so, but each of us is different.</p><p>&gt;my hunch rests upon a certain pattern of catch-phrases that i have &gt;observed being propagated around since the &quot;rampage&quot;. i went out on a limb &gt;talking about it, and took quite a risk in doing so, but wouldn&apos;t have if &gt;i didn&apos;t feel rather confident (based on real evidence) that there was a &gt;high probablity my hunch was correct.</p><p>Nonetheless, I saw none of these &apos;catch phrases&apos;; it didn&apos;t even occur to me. Whether you are unaware or have simply forgotten, I have been the subject of bitter abuse by the same source that you are indicating, and more so, in person and very personal. I have read a fair amount of his postings and am familiar with the style. I have also had occasion to correspond with David Doty, and have met and talked with him on a couple of occasions. He does not - at all - strike me as a petty or ill-spirited person, and to somehow connect these two people together may very well reflect biases and inferences on your part that simply don&apos;t verify in the actuality.</p><p>I also find it odd (but possibly understandable) that you, normally a paragon of copious background material, would speak in such a manner bolstered only by the &quot;high probability&quot; of your &quot;hunch&quot;.</p><p>&gt;oh yes. if my hunch is correct, and he is relying on &quot;N.P.&quot;&apos;s accounts &gt;(and reacting with cowardice to his own having been dumped upon by &quot;N.P&quot;), &gt;then yes, lies.</p><p>Let us set aside, for a moment, the fact the Doty is a member of the tuning group, and certainly must peruse the postings. You know, as well as I, that there have been numerous occasions where I have indicated my thoughts on something, only to have you say &apos;you are completely misunderstanding such-and-such&apos; or reading things into something that aren&apos;t there, and similar properties. I have a hard time figuring, save for high humidity and temperatures, someone like yourself painting another as a coward and a liar on nothing more than &quot;hunches&quot;. And he could certainly have just put the essay in 1/1, instead of posting it to the list, an action I wouldn&apos;t ascribe to cowardly action.</p><p>&gt;no one does, especially those of us like DBD who have been slandered by BM.</p><p>Get in line pal, I got the venom before you ever did!</p><p>&gt;but i did notice a tendency to react to all that with finger-pointing: &gt;&quot;oh, i&apos;m not the bad one, sure BM has a point, but the bad one really is . &gt;. . . . &quot;</p><p>I have *no* idea what that refers to.</p><p>&gt;but after the rampage, i did notice a rather large wave of this kind of &gt;aloof finger-pointing and advice giving</p><p>Again, I don&apos;t know what you are referencing. Outside of the general discussions that regarded what I will simply call &quot;research v. practice&quot; (and, please, if there is a (are) more acceptable term(s) for the polar extremes of the discussion, feel free to insert them...), the only other thing I noticed was a drop in attendance, and I feel we&apos;ve lost some good people in the last couple of years.</p><p>&gt;particularly on the &quot;splinter&quot; lists. i&apos;m not going to name names, but the &gt;level of discourse did seem to go down a notch.</p><p>I&apos;ve been on the list since Mills. The waves have come and gone, washed up and down; life is rarely ever the quietude that one finds in one&apos;s own study.</p><p>&gt;you bet! but the train seemed to run off the tracks a bit since the &gt;&quot;rampage&quot; -- there&apos;s been more of a tendency to try to distance oneself &gt;from this or that perceived &quot;nonsense&quot; . . .</p><p>I attribute that to some members leaving, and others joining on. The dynamics of the list(s) have certainly changed, but I think you are ignoring or diminishing a more obvious reason: the members of the band are different - the music doesn&apos;t sound the same any more, even when they play the old songs.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I can only say that your phraseology seems to encompass as much<br/>&gt; &gt; mutual suspicion and fear as you seem to want to point out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;oh well! i sure don&apos;t feel any . . .</p><p>That&apos;s all well and good, but I remind you that you yourself frequently attribute these kind of motivations and characteristics to others, including myself, without ever asking &quot;I wonder if maybe they &apos;don&apos;t feel any&apos;&quot;. If that is a reasonable response to such attributions, I&apos;ll remember it in the future.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So old and tired. And we still can&apos;t get past it.<br/>&gt; it&apos;s just that in this case, i found it disingenuous.</p><p>As you say, two wrongs don&apos;t...</p><p>&gt; &gt; mutual edification, and constructive development that are the<br/>&gt; &gt; best aspects of xenharmonic research, whether on the pages of<br/>&gt; &gt; 1/1 or on this here list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is that *all* the list is for, research?</p><p>&gt;. . . you really seem to be flying off on tangents here, and missing the &gt;main point . . .</p><p>This is classic Erlich, I have to say: *I* (Jon) am missing the main point. It couldn&apos;t possibly by you, could it? You have read all manner of behind-the-scenes nefarious agendas into a post, I read it as a more generalist message, and the only way out is that *I* am whacked.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Theory bashing *bandwagon*? No more valid than a &quot;theory promotion<br/>&gt; &gt;bandwagon&quot;!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;care to elaborate on what you mean here?</p><p>Only that when this kind of topic comes up, there are usually pretty equal number of voices on both sides of the coin. For each &quot;too much math&quot; whiner, there is the parallel &quot;Romantic anti-Intellectual!&quot; screed. Witness the flurry of posts the other day on meta, led off by Graham I believe.</p><p>&gt;well, it&apos;s a trend, if you like that word better. BM used to spout ...<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt;. . . but i just ignored the whole thing, and didn&apos;t let it get to me at &gt;all. (ok, maybe a little, and maybe that&apos;s why it&apos;s poking its head out &gt;now -- but that&apos;s the end of it)</p><p>I have to say that it appears it has affected you a lot deeper than you realize. I could write you offlist about this so as to not make a couple of issues public, but I don&apos;t think you are honoring some of the deeper issues at work, and whether or not they affect your reading of some of this.</p><p>I&apos;ll look again at my viewpoints, as well, but this last 1.5 years I&apos;ve pretty much exhausted myself going and self-educating on issues that others, including yourself, have indicated I should better understand to have a healthier view of many of my &apos;colleagues&apos;. I seriously doubt much, if any, similar effort has been made by others. That&apos;s not a pat on the back for myself, I&apos;m just tired of &quot;you must be misunderstanding such-and-such&quot;; I&apos;m not an insensitive or undereducated clod.</p><p>&gt; i don&apos;t -- i used your name as an *example*, and 1/1 as an *example*.</p><p>Maybe, in light of the subject matter at hand, an *unfortunate* pairing?</p><p>&gt;i have no need to rehash that with you, but since you&apos;ve obviously made &gt;your mind about that, let me just close the lid (ahem) on this with the &gt;old platitude, true as ever: &quot;two wrongs don&apos;t make one right&quot;</p><p>Of course. I&apos;m guessing, as you usually mean, that I am once again wrong, and that by &quot;made up your mind&quot; simply means that I didn&apos;t end up agreeing with you, and that you made no attempt to see the situation in another light, including that of the &apos;injured party&apos;. Dialogue and understanding are, as ever, a two-way street.</p><p>One thing I find curious in your relationships - even casual ones such as ours and others that come up in correspondence - is that you seem unwilling to give &quot;the benefit of the doubt&quot;. But maybe this is just as Dan Stearns has recently mentioned: that much of this wouldn&apos;t happen face-to-face. I don&apos;t know, and I&apos;d like to think that. But I, too, am tired of simply being dismissed.</p><p>This reply can&apos;t solve anything, and I don&apos;t know what could on these basic issues. All of that is fairly irrelevant to my respect for your work and knowledge, and that respect - for now - carries me forward.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=2731 href="#2731">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>7/3/2002 3:54:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;5.1.0.14.2.20020702201939.00a13ec0@...&gt;<br/>Jonathan M.
