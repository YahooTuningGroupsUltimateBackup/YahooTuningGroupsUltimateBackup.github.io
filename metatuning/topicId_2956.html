One thing I see ALL the time are musical/physical problems, because playing full-time in a symphony orchestra lets you interact (if one *wanted to...) with a lot of string players, all holding their instruments in positions that the body was *never* intended to be in, even for a short time! And this is stuff that goes for hours a day.</p><p>I&apos;ve seen really good results for some people with the Feldenkrais method, and you&apos;ve had other positive testimonials. My personal experience was watching my wife transformed by the Alexander technique. In a number of months, she not only eradicated all of the problems and pains, but - and I kid you not - she found improvement in her playing technique (as in &quot;Hey, I couldn&apos;t ever do that before&quot;) and even developed a bigger sound. I was, frankly, amazed.</p><p>I think you&apos;ll know when you&apos;ve found the right thing, and I&apos;d only add that, once you&apos;ve gotten the &apos;problems&apos; either solved or moving in the right direction, you might also consider a program of yoga, in one of it&apos;s many forms. I won&apos;t belabor the benefits, but when I started up I was pretty ignorant of what yoga can do for a person. And I&apos;ve been astonished at what it has done for me, truly surprised.</p><p>And, of course, pleased!</p><p>Best in body health to you,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=2959 href="#2959">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/8/2002 10:57:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; you might also consider a program of yoga,</p><p>dante gave me the same advice off-list, and i promise you both that<br/>i&apos;ll follow it. thanks!!!!!!!</p></div>
