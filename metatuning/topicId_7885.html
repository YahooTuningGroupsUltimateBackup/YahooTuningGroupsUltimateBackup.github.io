Nothing could be further<br/>from the truth; there is very little left critique in the movie. In<br/>fact, it&apos;s hard to find any coherent critique in the movie at all.</p><p>        The sad truth is that &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; is a bad movie, but not<br/>for<br/>the reasons it is being attacked in the dominant culture. It&apos;s at times<br/>a racist movie. And the analysis that underlies the film&apos;s main<br/>political points is either dangerously incomplete or virtually<br/>incoherent.</p><p>        But, most important, it&apos;s a conservative movie that ends with an</p><p>endorsement of one of the central lies of the United States, which<br/>should warm the hearts of the right-wingers who condemn Moore. And the<br/>real problem is that many left/liberal/progressive people are singing<br/>the film&apos;s praises, which should tell us something about the<br/>impoverished nature of the left in this country.</p><p>        I say all this not to pick at small points or harp on minor<br/>flaws.<br/>These aren&apos;t minor points of disagreement but fundamental questions of<br/>analysis and integrity. But before elaborating on that, I want to talk<br/>about what the film does well.</p><p>  The good stuff</p><p>        First, Moore highlights the disenfranchisement of primarily<br/>black<br/>voters in Florida in the 2000 election, a political scandal that the<br/>mainstream commercial news media in the United States has largely<br/>ignored. The footage of a joint session of Congress in which<br/>Congressional Black Caucus members can&apos;t get a senator to sign their<br/>letter to allow floor debate about the issue (a procedural requirement)<br/>is a powerful indictment not only of the Republicans who perpetrated<br/>the fraud but the Democratic leadership that refused to challenge it.</p><p>        Moore also provides a sharp critique of U.S. military recruiting</p><p>practices, with some amazing footage of recruiters cynically at work<br/>scouring low-income areas for targets, whom are disproportionately<br/>non-white. The film also effectively takes apart the Bush<br/>administration&apos;s use of fear tactics after 9/11 to drive the public to<br/>accept its war policies.</p><p>        &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; also does a good job of showing war&apos;s effects<br/>on<br/>U.S. soldiers; we see soldiers dead and maimed, and we see how<br/>contemporary warfare deforms many of them psychologically as well. And<br/>the film pays attention to the victims of U.S. wars, showing Iraqis<br/>both before the U.S. invasion and after in a way that humanizes them<br/>rather than uses them as props.</p><p>        The problem is that these positive elements don&apos;t add up to a<br/>good<br/>film. It&apos;s a shame that Moore&apos;s talent and flair for the dramatic<br/>aren&apos;t put in the service of a principled, clear analysis that could<br/>potentially be effective at something beyond defeating George W. Bush<br/>in 2004.</p><p>  Subtle racism</p><p>        How dare I describe as racist a movie that highlights the<br/>disenfranchisement of black voters and goes after the way in which<br/>military recruiters chase low-income minority youth? My claim is not<br/>that Moore is an overt racist, but that the movie unconsciously<br/>replicates a more subtle racism, one that we all have to struggle to<br/>resist.</p><p>        First, there is one segment that invokes the worst kind of<br/>ugly-American nativism, in which Moore mocks the Bush administration&apos;s<br/>&quot;coalition of the willing,&quot; the nations it lined up to support the<br/>invasion of Iraq. Aside from Great Britain there was no significant<br/>military support from other nations and no real coalition, which Moore<br/>is right to point out. But when he lists the countries in the so-called<br/>coalition, he uses images that have racist undertones. To depict the<br/>Republic of Palau (a small Pacific island nation), Moore chooses an<br/>image of stereotypical &quot;native&quot; dancers, while a man riding on an<br/>animal-drawn cart represents Costa Rica. Pictures of monkeys running<br/>are on the screen during a discussion of Morocco&apos;s apparent offer to<br/>send monkeys to clear landmines. To ridicule the Bush propaganda on<br/>this issue, Moore uses these images and an exaggerated voice-over in a<br/>fashion that says, in essence, &quot;What kind of coalition is it that has<br/>these backward countries?&quot; Moore might argue that is not his intention,<br/>but intention is not the only question; we all are responsible for how<br/>we tap into these kinds of stereotypes.</p><p>        More subtle and important is Moore&apos;s invocation of a racism in<br/>which<br/>solidarity between dominant whites and non-white groups domestically<br/>can be forged by demonizing the foreign &quot;enemy,&quot; which these days has<br/>an Arab and South Asian face. For example, in the segment about<br/>law-enforcement infiltration of peace groups, the camera pans the<br/>almost exclusively white faces (I noticed one Asian man in the scene)<br/>in the group Peace Fresno and asks how anyone could imagine these folks<br/>could be terrorists. There is no consideration of the fact that Arab<br/>and Muslim groups that are equally dedicated to peace have to endure<br/>routine harassment and constantly prove that they weren&apos;t terrorists,<br/>precisely because they weren&apos;t white.</p><p>        The other example of political repression that &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;</p><p>offers is the story of Barry Reingold, who was visited by FBI agents<br/>after making critical remarks about Bush and the war while working out<br/>at a gym in Oakland. Reingold, a white retired phone worker, was not<br/>detained or charged with a crime; the agents questioned him and left.<br/>This is the poster child for repression? In a country where hundreds of<br/>Arab, South Asian and Muslim men were thrown into secret detention<br/>after 9/11, this is the case Moore chooses to highlight? The only<br/>reference in the film to those detentions post-9/11 is in an interview<br/>with a former FBI agent about Saudis who were allowed to leave the<br/>United States shortly after 9/11, in which it appears that Moore<br/>mentions those detentions only to contrast the kid-gloves treatment<br/>that privileged Saudi nationals allegedly received.</p><p>        When I made this point to a friend, he defended Moore by saying<br/>the<br/>filmmaker was trying to reach a wide audience that likely is mostly<br/>white and probably wanted to use examples that those people could<br/>connect with. So, it&apos;s acceptable to pander to the white audience<br/>members and over-dramatize their limited risks while ignoring the<br/>actual serious harm done to non-white people? Could not a skilled<br/>filmmaker tell the story of the people being seriously persecuted in a<br/>way that non-Arab, non-South Asian, non-Muslims could empathize with?</p><p>Bad analysis</p><p>        &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; is strong on tapping into emotions and raising</p><p>questions about why the United States invaded Afghanistan and Iraq<br/>after 9/11, but it is extremely weak on answering those questions in<br/>even marginally coherent fashion. To the degree the film has a thesis,<br/>it appears to be that the wars were a product of the personal politics<br/>of a corrupt Bush dynasty. I agree the Bush dynasty is corrupt, but the<br/>analysis the film offers is both internally inconsistent, extremely<br/>limited in historical understanding and, hence, misguided.</p><p>        Is the administration of George W. Bush full of ideological<br/>fanatics?<br/>Yes. Have its actions since 9/11 been reckless and put the world at<br/>risk? Yes. In the course of pursuing those policies, has it enriched<br/>fat-cat friends? Yes. But it is a serious mistake to believe that these<br/>wars can be explained by focusing so exclusively on the Bush<br/>administration and ignoring clear trends in U.S. foreign and military<br/>policy. In short, these wars are not a sharp departure from the past<br/>but instead should be seen as an intensification of longstanding<br/>policies, affected by the confluence of this particular<br/>administration&apos;s ideology and the opportunities created by the events<br/>of 9/11.</p><p>        Look first at Moore&apos;s treatment of the U.S. invasion of<br/>Afghanistan.<br/>He uses a clip of former counterterrorism official Richard Clarke<br/>complaining that the Bush administration&apos;s response to 9/11 in<br/>Afghanistan was &quot;slow and small,&quot; implying that we should have attacked<br/>faster and bigger. The film does nothing to question that assessment,<br/>leaving viewers to assume that Moore agrees. Does he think that a<br/>bombing campaign that killed at least as many innocent Afghans as<br/>Americans who died on 9/11 was justified? Does he think that a military<br/>response was appropriate, and simply should have been more intense,<br/>which would have guaranteed even more civilian casualties? Does he<br/>think that a military strategy, which many experts believe made it<br/>difficult to pursue more routine and productive counterterrorism<br/>law-enforcement methods, was a smart move?</p><p>        Moore also suggests that the real motivation of the Bush<br/>administration in attacking Afghanistan was to secure a gas pipeline<br/>route from the Caspian Basin to the sea. It&apos;s true that Unocal had<br/>sought such a pipeline, and at one point Taliban officials were courted<br/>by the United States when it looked as if they could make such a deal<br/>happen. Moore points out that Taliban officials traveled to Texas in<br/>1997 when Bush was governor. He fails to point out that all this<br/>happened with the Clinton administration at the negotiating table. It<br/>is highly unlikely that policymakers would go to war for a single<br/>pipeline, but even if that were plausible it is clear that both<br/>Democrats and Republicans alike have been mixed up in that particular<br/>scheme.</p><p>        The centerpiece of Moore&apos;s analysis of U.S. policy in the Middle<br/>East<br/>is the relationship of the Bush family to the Saudis and the bin Laden<br/>family. The film appears to argue that those business interests,<br/>primarily through the Carlyle Group, led the administration to favor<br/>the Saudis to the point of ignoring potential Saudi complicity in the<br/>attacks of 9/11. After laying out the nature of those business<br/>dealings, Moore implies that the Bushes are literally on the take.</p><p>        It is certainly true that the Bush family and its cronies have a</p><p>relationship with Saudi Arabia that has led officials to overlook Saudi<br/>human-rights abuses and the support that many Saudis give to movements<br/>such as al Qaeda. That is true of the Bushes, just as it was of the<br/>Clinton administration and, in fact, every post-World War II president.<br/>Ever since FDR cut a deal with the House of Saud giving U.S. support in<br/>exchange for cooperation on the flow of oil and oil profits, U.S.<br/>administrations have been playing ball with the Saudis. The<br/>relationship is sometimes tense but has continued through ups and<br/>downs, with both sides getting at least part of what they need from the<br/>other. Concentrating on Bush family business connections ignores that<br/>history and encourages viewers to see the problem as specific to Bush.<br/>Would a Gore administration have treated the Saudis differently after<br/>9/11? There&apos;s no reason to think so, and Moore offers no evidence or<br/>argument why it would have.</p><p>        But that&apos;s only part of the story of U.S. policy in the Middle<br/>East,<br/>in which the Saudis play a role but are not the only players. The<br/>United States cuts deals with other governments in the region that are<br/>willing to support the U.S. aim of control over those energy resources.<br/>The Saudis are crucial in that system, but not alone. Egypt, Jordan and<br/>the other Gulf emirates have played a role, as did Iran under the Shah.<br/>As does, crucially, Israel. But there is no mention of Israel in the<br/>film. To raise questions about U.S. policy in the Middle East without<br/>addressing the role of Israel as a U.S. proxy is, to say the least, a<br/>significant omission. It&apos;s unclear whether Moore actually backs Israeli<br/>crimes and U.S. support for them, or simply doesn&apos;t understand the<br/>issue.</p><p>        And what of the analysis of Iraq? Moore is correct in pointing<br/>out<br/>that U.S. support for Iraq during the 1980s, when Saddam Hussein&apos;s war<br/>on Iran was looked upon favorably by U.S. policymakers, was a central<br/>part of Reagan and Bush I policy up to the Gulf War. And he&apos;s correct<br/>in pointing out that Bush II&apos;s invasion and occupation have caused<br/>great suffering in Iraq. What is missing is the intervening eight years<br/>in which the Clinton administration used the harshest economic embargo<br/>in modern history and regular bombing to further devastate an already<br/>devastated country. He fails to point out that Clinton killed more<br/>Iraqis through that policy than either of the Bush presidents. He fails<br/>to mention the 1998 Clinton cruise missile attack on Iraq, which was<br/>every bit as illegal as the 2003 invasion.</p><p>        It&apos;s not difficult to articulate what much of the rest of the<br/>world<br/>understands about U.S. policy in Iraq and the Middle East: Since the<br/>end of WWII, the United States has been the dominant power in the<br/>Middle East, constructing a system that tries to keep the Arab states<br/>weak and controllable (and, as a result, undemocratic) and undermine<br/>any pan-Arab nationalism, and uses allies as platforms and surrogates<br/>for U.S. power (such as Israel and Iran under the Shah). The goal is<br/>control over (not ownership of, but control over) the strategically<br/>crucial energy resources of the region and the profits that flow from<br/>them, which in an industrial world that runs on oil is a source of<br/>incredible leverage over competitors such as the European Union, Japan<br/>and China.</p><p>        The Iraq invasion, however incompetently planned and executed by<br/>the<br/>Bush administration, is consistent with that policy. That&apos;s the most<br/>plausible explanation for the war (by this time, we need no longer<br/>bother with the long-ago forgotten rationalizations of weapons of mass<br/>destruction and the alleged threat Iraq posed to the United States).<br/>The war was a gamble on the part of the Bush gang. Many in the<br/>foreign-policy establishment, including Bush I stalwarts such as Brent<br/>Scowcroft, spoke out publicly against war plans they thought were<br/>reckless. Whether Bush&apos;s gamble, in pure power terms, will pay off or<br/>not is yet to be determined.</p><p>        When the film addresses this question directly, what analysis<br/>does<br/>Moore offer of the reasons for the Iraq war? A family member of a<br/>soldier who died asks, &quot;for what?&quot; and Moore cuts to the subject of war<br/>profiteering. That segment appropriately highlights the vulture-like<br/>nature of businesses that benefit from war. But does Moore really want<br/>us to believe that a major war was launched so that Halliburton and<br/>other companies could increase its profits for a few years? Yes, war<br/>profiteering happens, but it is not the reason nations go to war. This<br/>kind of distorted analysis helps keep viewers&apos; attention focused on the<br/>Bush administration, by noting the close ties between Bush officials<br/>and these companies, not the routine way in which corporate America<br/>makes money off the misnamed Department of Defense, no matter who is in<br/>the White House.</p><p>        All this is summed up when Lila Lipscomb, the mother of a son<br/>killed<br/>in the war, visits the White House in a final, emotional scene and says<br/>that she now has somewhere to put all her pain and anger. This is the<br/>message of the film: It&apos;s all about the Bush administration. If that&apos;s<br/>the case, the obvious conclusion is to get Bush out of the White House<br/>so that things can get back to ... to what? I&apos;ll return to questions of<br/>political strategy at the end, but for now it&apos;s important to realize<br/>how this attempt to construct Bush as pursuing some radically different<br/>policy is bad analysis and leads to a misunderstanding of the threat<br/>the United States poses to the world. Yes, Moore throws in a couple of<br/>jabs at the Democrats in Congress for not stopping the mad rush to war<br/>in Iraq, but the focus is always on the singular crimes of George W.<br/>Bush and his gang.</p><p>  A conservative movie</p><p>        The claim that &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; is a conservative movie may<br/>strike<br/>some as ludicrous. But the film endorses one of the central lies that<br/>Americans tell themselves, that the U.S. military fights for our<br/>freedom. This construction of the military as a defensive force<br/>obscures the harsh reality that the military is used to project U.S.<br/>power around the world to ensure dominance, not to defend anyone&apos;s<br/>freedom, at home or abroad.</p><p>        Instead of confronting this mythology, Moore ends the film with<br/>it. He<br/>points out, accurately, the irony that those who benefit the least from<br/>the U.S. system -- the chronically poor and members of minority groups<br/>-- are the very people who sign up for the military. &quot;They offer to<br/>give up their lives so we can be free,&quot; Moore says, and all they ask in<br/>return is that we not send them in harm&apos;s way unless it&apos;s necessary.<br/>After the Iraq War, he wonders, &quot;Will they ever trust us again?&quot;</p><p>        It is no doubt true that many who join the military believe they<br/>will<br/>be fighting for freedom. But we must distinguish between the mythology<br/>that many internalize and may truly believe, from the reality of the<br/>role of the U.S. military. The film includes some comments by soldiers<br/>questioning that very claim, but Moore&apos;s narration implies that somehow<br/>a glorious tradition of U.S. military endeavors to protect freedom has<br/>now been sullied by the Iraq War.</p><p>        The problem is not just that the Iraq War was fundamentally<br/>illegal<br/>and immoral. The whole rotten project of empire building has been<br/>illegal and immoral -- and every bit as much a Democratic as a<br/>Republican project. The millions of dead around the world -- in Latin<br/>America, Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia -- as a result of U.S.<br/>military actions and proxy wars don&apos;t care which U.S. party was pulling<br/>the strings and pulling the trigger when they were killed. It&apos;s true<br/>that much of the world hates Bush. It&apos;s also true that much of the<br/>world has hated every post-WWII U.S. president. And for good reasons.</p><p>        It is one thing to express solidarity for people forced into the</p><p>military by economic conditions. It is quite another to pander to the<br/>lies this country tells itself about the military. It is not<br/>disrespectful to those who join up to tell the truth. It is our<br/>obligation to try to prevent future wars in which people are sent to<br/>die not for freedom but for power and profit. It&apos;s hard to understand<br/>how we can do that by repeating the lies of the people who plan, and<br/>benefit from, those wars.</p><p>  Political strategy</p><p>        The most common defense I have heard from liberals and<br/>progressives to<br/>these criticisms of &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; is that, whatever its flaws, the<br/>movie sparks people to political action. One response is obvious: There<br/>is no reason a film can&apos;t spark people to political action with<br/>intelligent and defensible analysis, and without subtle racism. But<br/>beyond that, it&apos;s not entirely clear the political action that this<br/>film will spark goes much beyond voting against Bush. The &quot;what can I<br/>do now?&quot; link on Moore&apos;s website suggests four actions, all of which<br/>are about turning out the vote. These resources about voting are well<br/>organized and helpful. But there are no links to grassroots groups<br/>organizing against not only the Bush regime but the American empire<br/>more generally.</p><p>        I agree that Bush should be kicked out of the White House, and<br/>if I<br/>lived in a swing state I would consider voting Democratic. But I don&apos;t<br/>believe that will be meaningful unless there emerges in the United<br/>States a significant anti-empire movement. In other words, if we beat<br/>Bush and go back to &quot;normal,&quot; we&apos;re all in trouble. Normal is empire<br/>building. Normal is U.S. domination, economic and military, and the<br/>suffering that vulnerable people around the world experience as a<br/>result. This doesn&apos;t mean voters can&apos;t judge one particular<br/>empire-building politician more dangerous than another. It doesn&apos;t mean<br/>we shouldn&apos;t sometimes make strategic choices to vote for one over the<br/>other. It simply means we should make such choices with eyes open and<br/>no illusions. This seems particularly important when the likely<br/>Democratic presidential candidate tries to out-hawk Bush on support for<br/>Israel, pledges to continue the occupation of Iraq, and says nothing<br/>about reversing the basic trends in foreign policy.</p><p>        In this sentiment, I am not alone. Ironically, Barry Reingold --<br/>the<br/>Oakland man who was visited by the FBI -- is critical of what he sees<br/>as the main message of the film. He was quoted in the San Francisco<br/>Chronicle saying: &quot;I think Michael Moore&apos;s agenda is to get Bush out,<br/>but I think it (should be) about more than Bush. I think it&apos;s about the<br/>capitalist system, which is inequitable.&quot; He went on to critique Bush<br/>and Kerry: &quot;I think both of them are bad. I think Kerry is actually<br/>worse because he gives the illusion that he&apos;s going to do a lot more.<br/>Bush has never given that illusion. People know that he&apos;s a friend of<br/>big business.&quot;</p><p>        Nothing I have said here is an argument against reaching out to<br/>a<br/>wider audience and trying to politicize more people. That&apos;s what I try<br/>to do in my own writing and local organizing work, as do countless<br/>other activists. The question isn&apos;t whether to reach out, but with what<br/>kind of analysis and arguments. Emotional appeals and humor have their<br/>place; the activists I work with use them. The question is, where do<br/>such appeals lead people?</p><p>        It is obvious that &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; taps into many Americans&apos;<br/>fear<br/>and/or hatred of Bush and his gang of thugs. Such feelings are<br/>understandable, and I share them. But feelings are not analysis, and<br/>the film&apos;s analysis, unfortunately, doesn&apos;t go much beyond the feeling:<br/>It&apos;s all Bush&apos;s fault. That may be appealing to people, but it&apos;s wrong.<br/>And it is hard to imagine how a successful anti-empire movement can be<br/>built on this film&apos;s analysis unless it is challenged. Hence, the<br/>reason for this essay.</p><p>        The potential value of Moore&apos;s film will be realized only if it<br/>is<br/>discussed and critiqued, honestly. Yes, the film is under attack from<br/>the right, for very different reasons than I have raised. But those<br/>attacks shouldn&apos;t stop those who consider themselves left, progressive,<br/>liberal, anti-war, anti-empire or just plain pissed-off from<br/>criticizing the film&apos;s flaws and limitations. I think my critique of<br/>the film is accurate and relevant. Others may disagree. The focus of<br/>debate should be on the issues raised, with an eye toward the question<br/>of how to build an anti-empire movement. Rallying around the film can<br/>too easily lead to rallying around bad analysis. Let&apos;s instead rally<br/>around the struggle for a better world, the struggle to dismantle the<br/>American empire.</p><p>---------------------</p><p>Robert Jensen is a journalism professor at the University of Texas at<br/>Austin and the author of &quot;Citizens of the Empire: The Struggle to Claim<br/>Our Humanity&quot; from City Lights Books.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
