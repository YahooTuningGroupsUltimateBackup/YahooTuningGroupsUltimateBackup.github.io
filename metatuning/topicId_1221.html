I<br/>think I had mentioned once before, but I just cracked 48, so I&apos;m<br/>definately the elder of this particular discussion, which on a bad<br/>day would be embarrassing, but on 99% of the days is just how it is!</p><p>RnR certainly has become a generational thing, which is good. I<br/>really do hope there will continue to be bands that speak directly to<br/>a younger generation, and that there will *always* be something<br/>rebellious about it. At best, I am cautiously optimistic.</p><p>Dave, thanks for the Hendrix &quot;Live&quot; reminder.</p><p>And to finish off, the most incendiary guitarist I happen to have in<br/>recent memory was Buckethead playing with Bill Laswell a couple of<br/>years ago. Holy shit, that was scary...</p><p>I&apos;m just a drummer, so I&apos;m outta here!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=1222 href="#1222">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2001 8:56:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; And to finish off, the most incendiary guitarist I happen to have<br/>in<br/>&gt; recent memory was Buckethead playing with Bill Laswell a couple of<br/>&gt; years ago.

Look out for a record in<br/>February -- may end up being my favorite. Sco has replaced harmonic<br/>complexity with harmonic sophistication; his unique voice is 100%<br/>pure and unadulterated, with lots of added flavors; and he&apos;s playing<br/>Miles Davis to the finest young cats around, who can play both<br/>straight-ahead jazz and techno-funk jams at the highest level. And<br/>the &quot;fuzak&quot; element is completely gone!</p></div><h3><a id=1228 href="#1228">ðŸ”—</a>peteysan@...</h3><span>11/28/2001 9:41:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>howdy!</p><p>Scofield can burn, no doubt, but the last thing I heard of his was terminally<br/>like Brecker Brothers&apos; or some other nervous NY &quot;funk&quot;.  Frisell, for all of<br/>his recent insipidity is to me sincere, wry and truly boundary-smearing.</p><p>Pete</p><p>P.S.  I was 15 when I saw Hendrix on a good night (concurred Rod Poole, who<br/>did some archiving), and he was &apos;astral&apos;, brain-damage incomparable!</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
