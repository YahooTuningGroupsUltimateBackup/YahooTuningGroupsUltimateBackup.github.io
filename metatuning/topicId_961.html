People who had become<br/>disillusioned with torture, murder, and mayhem, perhaps.  As it stands,<br/>one hears rumors, and Monbiot relies heavily on the correlation of<br/>numbers alone (so many graduates are involved in nasty behavior back<br/>home).  These are suggestive but inconclusive.</p><p>Of course, who is going to be the journalist who sends out feelers to<br/>graduates that he wants to tell the story?  Ask the wrong guy and you<br/>find out first hand, and no one ever finds your body, perhaps.</p><p>Yeesh, the number of ways it&apos;s possible to be horrible to other people<br/>is just huge.  The U.S. needs to close this school and disavow, in word<br/>and deed, all such tactics.  Until we do, we have little right to beat<br/>our chests about our supposed moral superiority to other nations.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
