It was conquered<br/>by Assyria and Akkad more than once and became part of that empire.<br/>Then the Sumerians regained a measure of control over part of the<br/>area and the final and greatest flowering of Sumerian culture<br/>ocurred around 2100-2000 BC, what&apos;s known as the &quot;Ur III&quot; period.</p><p>The invading Amorites were the ones who brought that to an end,<br/>and eventually Babylon conquered all of Sumer and made it part<br/>of the Babylonian Empire, and took over just about every aspect<br/>of Sumerian culture for its own.  Another result was what was<br/>probably the world&apos;s first great diaspora, as Sumerians fanned<br/>out of Mesopotamia from every direction. (I believe that Abraham,<br/>the father of the Jews, was an emigrating Sumerian.)</p><p>So anyway, my point is that Babylonian cultured followed<br/>directly upon the heels of Sumerian, and they did indeed<br/>usurp all of the Sumerian cultural legacy, and propogated<br/>it nearly intact for another 1500 years, until Babylon was<br/>conquered by the Persians c. 500 BC.</p><p>For those who never learned much about this amazing first<br/>civilization of the Sumerians, here&apos;s a decent history page:<br/><a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/sumerhistory.html">http://www.crystalinks.com/sumerhistory.html</a></p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
