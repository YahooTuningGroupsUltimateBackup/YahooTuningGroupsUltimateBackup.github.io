The office would assume a role traditionally<br/>led<br/>                   by civilian agencies, mainly the State Department.</p><p>                   The small but well-financed Pentagon office, which was<br/>                   established shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist<br/>attacks,<br/>                   was a response to concerns in the administration that<br/>the<br/>                   United States was losing public support overseas for<br/>its<br/>                   war on terrorism, particularly in Islamic countries.</p><p>                   As part of the effort to counter the pronouncements of<br/>the Taliban, Osama bin Laden and their<br/>                   supporters, the State Department has already hired a<br/>former advertising executive to run its public<br/>                   diplomacy office, and the White House has created a<br/>public information &quot;war room&quot; to coordinate<br/>                   the administration&apos;s daily message domestically and<br/>abroad.</p><p>                   Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, while broadly<br/>supportive of the new office, has not<br/>                   approved its specific proposals and has asked the<br/>Pentagon&apos;s top lawyer, William J. Haynes, to<br/>                   review them, senior Pentagon officials said.</p><p>                   Little information is available about the Office of<br/>Strategic Influence, and even many senior<br/>                   Pentagon officials and Congressional military aides say<br/>they know almost nothing about its<br/>                   purpose and plans. Its multimillion dollar budget,<br/>drawn from a $10 billion emergency<br/>                   supplement to the Pentagon budget authorized by<br/>Congress in October, has not been disclosed.</p><p>                   Headed by Brig. Gen. Simon P. Worden of the Air Force,<br/>the new office has begun circulating<br/>                   classified proposals calling for aggressive campaigns<br/>that use not only the foreign media and the<br/>                   Internet, but also covert operations.</p><p>                   The new office &quot;rolls up all the instruments within<br/>D.O.D. to influence foreign audiences,&quot; its<br/>                   assistant for operations, Thomas A. Timmes, a former<br/>Army colonel and psychological operations<br/>                   officer, said at a recent conference, referring to the<br/>Department of Defense. &quot;D.O.D. has not<br/>                   traditionally done these things.&quot;</p><p>                   One of the office&apos;s proposals calls for planting news<br/>items with foreign media organizations<br/>                   through outside concerns that might not have obvious<br/>ties to the Pentagon, officials familiar with<br/>                   the proposal said.</p><p>                   General Worden envisions a broad mission ranging from<br/>&quot;black&quot; campaigns that use<br/>                   disinformation and other covert activities to &quot;white&quot;<br/>public affairs that rely on truthful news<br/>                   releases, Pentagon officials said.</p><p>                   &quot;It goes from the blackest of black programs to the<br/>whitest of white,&quot; a senior Pentagon official<br/>                   said.</p><p>                   Another proposal involves sending journalists, civic<br/>leaders and foreign leaders e-mail messages<br/>                   that promote American views or attack unfriendly<br/>governments, officials said.</p><p>                   Asked if such e-mail would be identified as coming from<br/>the American military, a senior Pentagon<br/>                   official said that &quot;the return address will probably be<br/>a dot-com, not a dot- mil,&quot; a reference to the<br/>                   military&apos;s Internet designation.</p><p>                   To help the new office, the Pentagon has hired the<br/>Rendon Group, a Washington-based<br/>                   international consulting firm run by John W. Rendon<br/>Jr., a former campaign aide to President<br/>                   Jimmy Carter. The firm, which is being paid about<br/>$100,000 a month, has done extensive work for<br/>                   the Central Intelligence Agency, the Kuwaiti royal<br/>family and the Iraqi National Congress, the<br/>                   opposition group seeking to oust President Saddam<br/>Hussein.</p><p>                   Officials at the Rendon Group say terms of their<br/>contract forbid them to talk about their Pentagon<br/>                   work. But the firm is well known for running propaganda<br/>campaigns in Arab countries, including<br/>                   one denouncing atrocities by Iraq during its 1990<br/>invasion of Kuwait.</p><p>                   The firm has been hired as the Bush administration<br/>appears to have united around the goal of<br/>                   ousting Mr. Hussein. &quot;Saddam Hussein has a charm<br/>offensive going on, and we haven&apos;t done<br/>                   anything to counteract it,&quot; a senior military official<br/>said.</p><p>                   Proponents say the new Pentagon office will bring<br/>much-needed coordination to the military&apos;s<br/>                   efforts to influence views of the United States<br/>overseas, particularly as Washington broadens the<br/>                   war on terrorism beyond Afghanistan.</p><p>                   But the new office has also stirred a sharp debate in<br/>the Pentagon, where several senior officials<br/>                   have questioned whether its mission is too broad and<br/>possibly even illegal.</p><p>                   Those critics say they are disturbed that a single<br/>office might be authorized to use not only covert<br/>                   operations like computer network attacks, psychological<br/>activities and deception, but also the<br/>                   instruments and staff of the military&apos;s globe- spanning<br/>public affairs apparatus.</p><p>                   Mingling the more surreptitious activities with the<br/>work of traditional public affairs would<br/>                   undermine the Pentagon&apos;s credibility with the media,<br/>the public and governments around the world,<br/>                   critics argue.</p><p>                   &quot;This breaks down the boundaries almost completely,&quot; a<br/>senior Pentagon official said.</p><p>                   Moreover, critics say, disinformation planted in<br/>foreign media organizations, like Reuters or<br/>                   Agence France-Presse, could end up being published or<br/>broadcast by American news<br/>                   organizations.</p><p>                   The Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency are<br/>barred by law from propaganda activities in<br/>                   the United States. In the mid-1970&apos;s, it was disclosed<br/>that some C.I.A. programs to plant false<br/>                   information in the foreign press had resulted in<br/>articles published by American news<br/>                   organizations.</p></div><h3>jdstarrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/19/2002 8:31:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                    February 19, 2002<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                    Pentagon Readies Efforts to Sway Sentiment Abroad<br/>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>What an odd and stupid thing to do.
