This type of consciousness is still a small<br/>minority among our citizenry, most of whom are out buying SUVs and<br/>such. I&apos;m hoping it will grow to be a majority. And if it does, by<br/>some miracle, many of the &quot;evil&quot; corporations (not yours, of course)<br/>will simply shrivel up. Their managements and employees will simply<br/>have to find something else to do. That&apos;s the beauty of the market.<br/>No need or cause for war at all. Just consciousness. Unfortunately,<br/>lazy gluttony and indifference seems far more prevalent than<br/>consciousness these days.</p></div><h3><a id=7498 href="#7498">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.

Sidenote: had dinner with a former student who is a drummer in<br/>NY, who uses a practice studio near the Ed Sullivan Theatre (home of<br/>the Letterman show). He told me that on daily walks to the studio he<br/>noticed one day some steel beams installed under the marquee, and<br/>couldn&apos;t figure it out. Then he saw that Phish was playing on top of<br/>the marquee (including a B-3) and it all made sense!</p></div>
