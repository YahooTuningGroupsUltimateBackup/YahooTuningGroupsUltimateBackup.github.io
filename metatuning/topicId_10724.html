As I continued, I was able to play some of the pieces (the slow ones :)  almost up to tempo.</p><p>With counterpoint,  just think of each moment vertically---think of the peice going chord by chord--don&apos;t worry about the lines.  As you get more and more skilled at it,  you&apos;ll eventually be able to think about the lines.</p><p>The other thing is,  my teacher said &quot;you have to always be looking ahead, and thinking about what you are doing&quot;.  Well, that didn&apos;t help me. Later, I realized that the trick to sight-reading is the ability to NOT be thinking about what you&apos;re doing,  and still be reading well anyhow.</p><p>The only way to get there is to start slow enough that you don&apos;t have to think too hard.</p></div><h3><a id=10726 href="#10726">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/18/2006 12:25:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Chris,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey &lt;chris@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The other thing is,  my teacher said &quot;you have to always be<br/>&gt; looking ahead, and thinking about what you are doing&quot;.<br/>&gt; Well, that didn&apos;t help me.</p><p>That&apos;s exactly another thing that i emphasize to my students.</p><p>I liken it to riding a bike or skateboard -- something<br/>that most kids understand; for adult students, i use<br/>driving a car as an example. I say &quot;You don&apos;t look down<br/>at the front wheel as you&apos;re moving, right? Why?&quot; (next,<br/>the student chimes in with me in unison) &quot;Because you&apos;ll<br/>crash.&quot; &quot;Exactly. You have to look *ahead* of you so that<br/>you can see where you&apos;re going, because you are moving.<br/>It&apos;s the same thing when playing from written music.&quot;</p><p>Most of my students really grok it after i present it<br/>this way, and they get much better at sight-reading.</p><p>&gt; Later, I realized that the trick to sight-reading is<br/>&gt; the ability to NOT be thinking about what you&apos;re doing,<br/>&gt; and still be reading well anyhow.</p><p>Yes, i think that sums up pretty well how it works.</p><p>&gt; The only way to get there is to start slow enough that you<br/>&gt; don&apos;t have to think too hard.</p><p>Yes, this is always great advice. I think you&apos;ve got it right.</p><p>And for learning a new piece (as opposed to sight-reading),<br/>beginning to practice a new piece *SLOWLY* is THE NUMBER ONE<br/>thing that i teach every one of my students.</p><p>But in this case, it&apos;s not so that you don&apos;t have to think,<br/>it&apos;s precisely the opposite: because you have *so much* to<br/>think about, for each and every note, you have to play it<br/>extremely slowly and make sure that the pitch, rhythm,<br/>dynamics, and phrasing are all absolutely correct. If anything<br/>is wrong when you first start to learn the piece, and you<br/>continue to practice it wrong, you will learn it wrong and<br/>play it wrong. &quot;Practice makes perfect&quot; for sure -- but<br/>perfectly wrong practice makes it perfectly wrong, and<br/>only perfectly correct practice makes it perfectly correct.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=10728 href="#10728">ðŸ”—</a>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2006 8:30:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes, I think counting to 6 would work. One doesn&apos;t know what<br/> the rest of the measure has in store though. I could count to<br/> 6 fast enough to make it work. I can&apos;t count to 12 (that is<br/> 48 in 4/4 time) fast enough to make it work. The reason I choose<br/> 48, was that anything that comes up (at least recently) could<br/> be played in the proper timing with 48 ( that is counting to 12<br/> per quarter note).</p><p> If I played something REAL slow (counting to 48 in 4/4) could<br/> this be speeded-up with Audacity?

I wish you were in my area, one or two sessions would have you<br/>flying. I might suggest you reduce the problem down to it&apos;s elemental<br/>component - rhythm. By this I mean: don&apos;t work at the piano/kbd, just<br/>sit with some music and either count the rhythm (*not* the pitches) or<br/>tap with your hands. This way you aren&apos;t trying to get the correct<br/>pitch AND the correct rhythm, just the rhythm. Isolate all the tricky<br/>ones and do them slowly and with many repetitions; only after you are<br/>comfortable with that should you go back to the kbd and try to play<br/>the pitchs. I also would work on one staff at a time, and then put<br/>them together.</p><p>Suggestion: go to a nearby decent college and see if any percussion<br/>majors give drum lessons. Tell them you&apos;d like to understand basic<br/>rhythmic reading better, and see if they&apos;ll do a couple of lessons<br/>with that in mind.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=10732 href="#10732">ðŸ”—</a>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2006 6:04:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>I might suggest you reduce the problem down to it&apos;s elemental<br/>&gt; component - rhythm.

What I sometimes have been doing lately is<br/>    just playing some songs from the book (Once More, With<br/>    Feeling&quot;) without counting or trying very hard to get the<br/>    timing right. Just trying to hit the notes on the page.<br/>    Timing is totally off of course. I&apos;m pretty confident I can<br/>    get the timing right in 4/4 by counting to 48. One of those<br/>    catch-22 FUBAR situations I guess. You know timing on, yet<br/>    too slow .</p><p>    I used to know a musician.<br/>    I haven&apos;t seen him in about 20 years<br/>    though. He would know what to do. Doesn&apos;t really matter for<br/>    now anyway. Not like I play outside my room for anyone.</p><p>    I guess I&apos;m okay on this for now,</p><p>    -Stephen</p></div>
