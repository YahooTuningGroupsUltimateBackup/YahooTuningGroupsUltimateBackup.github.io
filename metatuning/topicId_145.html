It is perhaps only 3 or 4 hundred<br/>&gt;&gt; years ago that we find instruments that resembles the ones we<br/>&gt;&gt; see today.</p><p>I am sure I have read that gamelan instruments have been<br/>found in excavations going back two millenia. Though<br/>obviously I don&apos;t remember where I read that. Perhaps<br/>we are disagreeing on my use of the term &apos;very little&apos;.</p><p>Would you agree if I said &quot;Of course the basic form of the<br/>instruments used in the Indonesian gamelan has been around<br/>for at least 2000 years.&quot; ?</p><p>&gt;&gt; There is much controversy as to which what came first Pelog or<br/>&gt;&gt; Slendro as it appears they were not both present that far back.</p><p>Yes that&apos;s partly why I referred to my selection as<br/>&apos;Indonesian modes&apos; and not claim any particular label.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The music itself is always changing too. The<br/>&gt;&gt; recordings made by McPhee represent music that is no longer in<br/>&gt;&gt; existence except as a basis for new styles.</p><p>I don&apos;t agree with that though I would accept Wenten&apos;s<br/>assesment since he spends plenty of time in both places.<br/>Have you asked him?</p><p>I agree that the tourists like the modern styles like<br/>Kebyar and the monkey chant; perhaps you are thinking of<br/>that side of it. But to say that the ancient music is<br/>no longer in existence or practiced I believed is<br/>totally and completely untrue, unless all that has<br/>happened in the last ten years.</p><p>&gt;&gt; With the introduction of the Rebab, we see the Persian<br/>&gt;&gt; influence,</p><p>Of course... so you are seeing my point.</p><p>&gt;&gt; but not all Indonesia is Islamic. Bali is Hindu</p><p>Yes yes I know that. Hinduism was there first for a long<br/>time, probably brought there on the spice route. Then when<br/>the Islamic invaders came, the Hindu Royal Courts,<br/>containing the best and brightest artists, writers and<br/>scientists, all emigrated to Bali. Thus the Balinese music<br/>is likely more ancient, which may account for their<br/>gamelans being more simple than the Javanese (in general).</p><p>&gt;&gt; and by the way, credit their tuning as being brought by a<br/>&gt;&gt; Princess of China.</p><p>Well and the Javanese derive from the Balinese so there<br/>you go.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Of course,  China is on the silk road  and they in turn had<br/>&gt;&gt; dealing with the mid east :)</p><p>Right, as I was saying.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Last week i played on my radio show a performer from Yemen who<br/>&gt;&gt; used a copper tray instrument which is played as a fingered<br/>&gt;&gt; percussion instrument. The liner notes remarked that the alloy<br/>&gt;&gt; was the same as the gongs found in Indonesia. hmmmm..</p><p>Ah, so you are making my argument for me! :-)</p><p>By the way, regarding the claims of 300-400 years, let<br/>me quote Wenten&apos;s notes to &quot;Gamelan Semar Pegulingan Saih<br/>Pitu&quot;:</p><p>  The Prakempa traces the origins of the gamelan semar<br/>  pegulingan back to the Simladprana, a 14-century<br/>  ensemble also known as the gamelan gambuh, a court<br/>  gamelan which accompanies the ancient gambuh form of<br/>  dance theater. According to the Balinese musicologist<br/>  and educator Nyoman Rembang, the gamelan semar<br/>  pegulingan reportoire has survived to this day by being<br/>  handed down orally from generation to generation.</p><p>So that is 700 years there of continued unbroken<br/>tradition. Can&apos;t find the same thing even in Western<br/>music. And that&apos;s just the first liner notes I pulled.<br/>Perhaps there are older traditional gamelans too or maybe<br/>I got lucky. The instruments I am fairly positive<br/>are considerably older.</p><p>And I&apos;d like to be real bold here and go ahead and claim<br/>that the gamelan was invented by the Sumerians. No<br/>evidence of it but I thing we will one day be surprised<br/>during an archaeological dig. If anyone reading here has<br/>contact with any ancient Sumerian or Babylonian entities<br/>that could shed some light on this issue, I would not mind<br/>seeing this aspect of it continued in spiritual_tuning.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3>Daniel James Wolf &#x3C;djwolf1@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2001 12:38:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.

Over these two centuries alone, the changes in repertoire,<br/>style, instrumentation, and, yes, tuning are manifold.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
