Material disseminated by the advocates or opponents of a doctrine or cause&quot;</p><p>Pretty much everything is &quot;propoganda&quot; on these lists then. Advocates of just intonation. Advocates of 72-tet. Advocates of this, advocates of that. I note that the above definition says nothing about truth or falsity, and in that sense there is plenty of propoganda on our collection of lists.</p><p>I think what one needs to do is give others credit for some intelligence in reading these posts. I, myself, don&apos;t look at someone like Ariel Sharon based on one statement, so I haven&apos;t even bothered to see if that is a true or false attibution, and I certainly wouldn&apos;t give creedance to a comparison to the most heinous of history based on such a narrow view. But that doesn&apos;t mean he isn&apos;t open to any criticism, either.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon (no &quot;h&quot;) :)</p></div>
