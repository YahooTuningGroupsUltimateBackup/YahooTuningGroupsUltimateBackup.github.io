If you got something, it<br/>sure wasn&apos;t in anything I wrote. What I was referring to was a rather<br/>large scandal, in 1996 I believe, involving allegations that a large<br/>number of children had been murdered/sexually abused in Belgium, and<br/>that the perpetrators were being protected by higher ups in the Belgian<br/>government. There were actually large public demonstrations over this,<br/>and I regret to say that I don&apos;t know what&apos;s happened with this case<br/>since. One of the main perps in the case is a Marc Dutroux, and<br/>according to some articles I saw on the net, there were some mighty<br/>suspicious circumstances regarding the way the police treated him. If<br/>you&apos;re interested, do a name search on Dutroux, and I believe you&apos;ll<br/>find some interesting reading. Again, I was making no slimy references<br/>to any national/racial group...it was the mention of an official in<br/>Belgium, in XJ&apos;s post, that triggered my post...Hstick PS...in the book<br/>&quot;The Biggest Secret,&quot; by David Icke, he mentions the December 29th issue<br/>of  The Sunday Times, as having an article relating to this case, titled<br/>&quot;Satanic Links to Belgian Murder Trial.&quot; I have not checked this out, so<br/>cannot verify what&apos;s in it...</p></div>
