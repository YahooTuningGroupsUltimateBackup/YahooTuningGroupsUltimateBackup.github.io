It will make your palms grow hairy. Such myths<br/>about masturbation are largely a thing of the past. But the latest research<br/>has even better news for young men: frequent self-pleasuring could protect<br/>against the most common kind of cancer.</p><p>A team in Australia led by Graham Giles of The Cancer Council Victoria in<br/>Melbourne asked 1079 men with prostate cancer to fill in a questionnaire<br/>detailing their sexual habits, and compared their responses with those of<br/>1259 healthy men of the same age. The team concludes that the more men<br/>ejaculate between the ages of 20 and 50, the less likely they are to develop<br/>prostate cancer.</p><p>The protective effect is greatest while men are in their twenties: those who<br/>had ejaculated more than five times per week in their twenties, for<br/>instance, were one-third less likely to develop aggressive prostate cancer<br/>later in life  ( BJU International , vol 92, p 211).</p><p>The results contradict those of previous studies, which have suggested that<br/>having had many sexual partners, or a high frequency of sexual activity,<br/>increases the risk of prostate cancer by up to 40 per cent. The key<br/>difference is that these earlier studies defined sexual activity as sexual<br/>intercourse, whereas the latest study focused on the number of ejaculations,<br/>whether or not intercourse was involved.</p><p>The team speculates that infections caused by intercourse may increase the<br/>risk of prostate cancer. &quot;Had we been able to remove ejaculations associated<br/>with sexual intercourse, there should have been an even stronger protective<br/>effect of other ejaculations,&quot; they suggest. &quot;Men have many ways of using<br/>their prostate which do not involve women or other men,&quot; Giles adds.</p><p>Macho exaggeration</p><p>Giles accepts the possibility that the men who completed the questionnaires<br/>could have lied about their habits. But he doubts this skewed the results,<br/>since questions about masturbation are unlikely to evoke the same macho<br/>exaggeration as questions about, say, number of sexual partners.</p><p>But why should ejaculating more often cut the risk of prostate cancer? The<br/>team speculates that ejaculation prevents carcinogens building up in the<br/>gland. The prostate, together with the seminal vesicles, secretes the bulk<br/>of the fluid in semen, which is rich in substances such as potassium, zinc,<br/>fructose and citric acid.</p><p>Generating the fluid involves concentrating these components from the<br/>bloodstream up to 600-fold - and this could be where the trouble starts.<br/>Studies in dogs show that carcinogens such as 3-methylcholanthrene, found in<br/>cigarette smoke, are also concentrated in prostate fluid.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s a prostatic stagnation hypothesis,&quot; says Giles. &quot;The more you flush<br/>the ducts out, the less there is to hang around and damage the cells that<br/>line them.&quot;</p><p>Sexual repertoire</p><p>His findings suggest an intriguing parallel between prostate cancer and<br/>breast cancer, as recent studies indicate that lactating reduces a woman&apos;s<br/>risk of breast cancer, perhaps because this also flushes out carcinogens.<br/>Alternatively, ejaculation might induce prostate cells to mature fully,<br/>making them less susceptible to carcinogens.</p><p>&quot;All these mechanisms are totally speculative,&quot; cautions breast cancer<br/>expert Loren Lipworth of the International Epidemiology Institute in<br/>Rockville, Maryland.</p><p>But if the finding is confirmed, future health advice from doctors may no<br/>longer be restricted to diet and exercise. &quot;Masturbation is part of people&apos;s<br/>sexual repertoire,&quot; says Anthony Smith, deputy director of the Australian<br/>Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society at La Trobe University in<br/>Melbourne.</p><p>&quot;If these findings hold up, then it&apos;s perfectly reasonable that men should<br/>be encouraged to masturbate,&quot; he says.</p></div>
