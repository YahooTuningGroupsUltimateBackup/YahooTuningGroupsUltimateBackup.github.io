Why did you move this to this list BTW<br/>    I know of Gongs going back to the time you mentioned but we really don&apos;t<br/>know what it is they played on them. The trouble i have with the idea of<br/>Gamelan coming from the mideast is their scale types. They are not big on<br/>pentatonics and have nothing that resembles Slendro and Pelog. The Chinese<br/>do and since they say this is where the gamelan comes from, having stone<br/>gongs going back this far, it seem there is more evidence this way. It seems<br/>much more likely that exposure to music of the far east had an influence on<br/>the Persians. It is pretty hard to find an explanation of the neutral third<br/>in their theory (mostly an extension of Greek, which could have been<br/>Sumerian and egyptian in origin, i concede) whereas these interval are<br/>rampant in the music of Burma, Cambodia, and thailand, as well as Sumatra,<br/>and certain forms of Pelog (that approaching 7 equal).<br/>    Thanks for the info on the Gamelan Semar Pegulingan Saih Pitu. I am glad<br/>it is older than i thought. Can&apos;t imagine what bars are like after 700 years<br/>of banging.<br/>    It is my understanding that Balinese Gamelan got allot faster after the<br/>dutch massacre. played much slowed before that.</p><p>&quot;X.

It is perhaps only 3 or 4 hundred<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; years ago that we find instruments that resembles the ones we<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; see today.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am sure I have read that gamelan instruments have been<br/>&gt; found in excavations going back two millenia. Though<br/>&gt; obviously I don&apos;t remember where I read that. Perhaps<br/>&gt; we are disagreeing on my use of the term &apos;very little&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Would you agree if I said &quot;Of course the basic form of the<br/>&gt; instruments used in the Indonesian gamelan has been around<br/>&gt; for at least 2000 years.&quot; ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; There is much controversy as to which what came first Pelog or<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Slendro as it appears they were not both present that far back.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes that&apos;s partly why I referred to my selection as<br/>&gt; &apos;Indonesian modes&apos; and not claim any particular label.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; The music itself is always changing too. The<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; recordings made by McPhee represent music that is no longer in<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; existence except as a basis for new styles.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t agree with that though I would accept Wenten&apos;s<br/>&gt; assesment since he spends plenty of time in both places.<br/>&gt; Have you asked him?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree that the tourists like the modern styles like<br/>&gt; Kebyar and the monkey chant; perhaps you are thinking of<br/>&gt; that side of it. But to say that the ancient music is<br/>&gt; no longer in existence or practiced I believed is<br/>&gt; totally and completely untrue, unless all that has<br/>&gt; happened in the last ten years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; With the introduction of the Rebab, we see the Persian<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; influence,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course... so you are seeing my point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; but not all Indonesia is Islamic. Bali is Hindu<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes yes I know that. Hinduism was there first for a long<br/>&gt; time, probably brought there on the spice route. Then when<br/>&gt; the Islamic invaders came, the Hindu Royal Courts,<br/>&gt; containing the best and brightest artists, writers and<br/>&gt; scientists, all emigrated to Bali. Thus the Balinese music<br/>&gt; is likely more ancient, which may account for their<br/>&gt; gamelans being more simple than the Javanese (in general).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and by the way, credit their tuning as being brought by a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Princess of China.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well and the Javanese derive from the Balinese so there<br/>&gt; you go.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course,  China is on the silk road  and they in turn had<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; dealing with the mid east :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right, as I was saying.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Last week i played on my radio show a performer from Yemen who<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; used a copper tray instrument which is played as a fingered<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; percussion instrument. The liner notes remarked that the alloy<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; was the same as the gongs found in Indonesia. hmmmm..<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, so you are making my argument for me! :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, regarding the claims of 300-400 years, let<br/>&gt; me quote Wenten&apos;s notes to &quot;Gamelan Semar Pegulingan Saih<br/>&gt; Pitu&quot;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   The Prakempa traces the origins of the gamelan semar<br/>&gt;   pegulingan back to the Simladprana, a 14-century<br/>&gt;   ensemble also known as the gamelan gambuh, a court<br/>&gt;   gamelan which accompanies the ancient gambuh form of<br/>&gt;   dance theater. According to the Balinese musicologist<br/>&gt;   and educator Nyoman Rembang, the gamelan semar<br/>&gt;   pegulingan reportoire has survived to this day by being<br/>&gt;   handed down orally from generation to generation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So that is 700 years there of continued unbroken<br/>&gt; tradition. Can&apos;t find the same thing even in Western<br/>&gt; music. And that&apos;s just the first liner notes I pulled.<br/>&gt; Perhaps there are older traditional gamelans too or maybe<br/>&gt; I got lucky. The instruments I am fairly positive<br/>&gt; are considerably older.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I&apos;d like to be real bold here and go ahead and claim<br/>&gt; that the gamelan was invented by the Sumerians. No<br/>&gt; evidence of it but I thing we will one day be surprised<br/>&gt; during an archaeological dig. If anyone reading here has<br/>&gt; contact with any ancient Sumerian or Babylonian entities<br/>&gt; that could shed some light on this issue, I would not mind<br/>&gt; seeing this aspect of it continued in spiritual_tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Jeff<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meta Tuning meta-info:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">metatuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Web page is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To post to the list, send to<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t have to be a member to post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

Did you know I Made<br/>Lasmawan? I was in his group and we would come up and play at the<br/>Consulate on Indonesian Independence Day and for other events in the<br/>area (such as when the King of Jogjakarta made his first trip to the<br/>US - wow!). Also played at Cal Arts once when Pak Chokro retired.<br/>Anyway, knew Wenten through this and also Wenten would come to SD and<br/>perform when we had big concerts. I&apos;m not a very good performer but am<br/>totally stark raving mad about Balinese music and I think that&apos;s why<br/>Made let me into his inner circle.</p><p>&gt; Why did you move this to this list BTW</p><p>Hm... well I am trying to keep my posts to crazy_music to be directly<br/>related to actual music. And here we are getting into detailed<br/>historical speculation which is a little different. Perhaps if we come<br/>to any conclusions, I will summarize how it all relates to the song in<br/>crazy_music.</p><p>&gt; I know of Gongs going back to the time you mentioned but we really<br/>don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know what it is they played on them.</p><p>Yes, alright -- that makes sense. I was about to say that maybe we<br/>could reasonably speculate that the scales and concepts of tuning and<br/>styles of playing were similar since that is where I could tie it in<br/>to the fireflies claim, but you did mention some things I did not know<br/>about, suggesting that scale theory there is somewhat recent. And I<br/>suppose of the old instruments complete sets of keys don&apos;t exist... or<br/>are of unplayable quality.</p><p>&gt; The trouble i have with the idea of<br/>&gt; Gamelan coming from the mideast is their scale types. They are not<br/>big on<br/>&gt; pentatonics and have nothing that resembles Slendro and Pelog.</p><p>I am in 100% agreement with you here. The scale methodologies could<br/>not be more opposed it seems, in fact mirroring somewhat the contrasts<br/>between some of our modern tuning factions.</p><p>BUT Arabic music I think was heavily influenced by Greek music and<br/>there is no evidence I am aware of that Greek theory came from<br/>Babylon. The modern Greco-Arab music theory I think came as a result<br/>of Greek cultural influence on the Arabs. (I&apos;m speculating rampantly<br/>here.) In fact with the Babylonian obsession with taking roots of<br/>numbers and solving complex equations, I would speculate that<br/>Babylonian or Sumerian (if the Babylonians were so influenced) music<br/>theory was quite sophisticated. And if the initial trade routes and<br/>relationships were established by the Babylonians long ago, perhaps on<br/>a small scale, then it is possible we could infer there could be a<br/>connection between the two.</p><p>&gt; The Chinese<br/>&gt; do and since they say this is where the gamelan comes from, having<br/>stone<br/>&gt; gongs going back this far,</p><p>Hm, you&apos;re right that they have those super ancient lithiophones. Are<br/>the tunings intact? Any relationship between those tunings and any<br/>others?</p><p>&gt; it seem there is more evidence this way. It seems<br/>&gt; much more likely that exposure to music of the far east had an<br/>influence on<br/>&gt; the Persians.</p><p>OK - so you are saying it all started with the Chinese, and then moved<br/>South to Indonesia on the silk route and east to Arabia on the spice<br/>route. Seems reasonable, particular since I think the Chinese were the<br/>first to hit Bronze and Iron capabilities, am I right here? And so it<br/>would make mmore sense for bronze technology to move from a big<br/>culture with infrastructure and high tech systems like ancient China<br/>to move down to Indonesia using established routes (particularly since<br/>ancient gamelans are found all the way down the route -- in Thailand<br/>and the Phillipines), rather than of small island nations with sparse<br/>populations and muhc smalller cities to come up with such instrument<br/>technology on their own, though it is possible.</p><p>&gt; It is pretty hard to find an explanation of the neutral third<br/>&gt; in their theory (mostly an extension of Greek, which could have been<br/>&gt; Sumerian and egyptian in origin, i concede)</p><p>OK - as I said with the roots, right?</p><p>&gt; whereas these interval are<br/>&gt; rampant in the music of Burma, Cambodia, and thailand, as well as<br/>Sumatra,</p><p>To be sure. But do you know over what range of neutral fifth they use?<br/>Seems that size interval is convenient and if you are -avoiding- just<br/>intervals you might quite naturally and innocently try to find<br/>something right between 6/5 and 5/4.</p><p>&gt; and certain forms of Pelog (that approaching 7 equal).<br/>&gt;     Thanks for the info on the Gamelan Semar Pegulingan Saih Pitu.
