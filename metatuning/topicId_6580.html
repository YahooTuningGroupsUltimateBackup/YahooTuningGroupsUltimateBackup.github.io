In view of the<br/>many deserving competitors, we regret that only a few can win a<br/>P.U.-litzer.</p><p>And now, the twelfth annual P.U.-litzer Prizes, for the foulest media<br/>performances of 2003:</p><p>MEDIA MOGUL OF THE YEAR -- Lowry Mays, CEO of Clear Channel</p><p>While some broadcasters care about their programming, the CEO of<br/>America&apos;s biggest radio company (with more than 1,200 stations) admits<br/>he cares only about the ads. The Clear Channel boss told Fortune<br/>magazine in March: &quot;If anyone said we were in the radio business, it<br/>wouldn&apos;t be someone from our company. We&apos;re not in the business of<br/>providing news and information. We&apos;re not in the business of providing<br/>well-researched music. We&apos;re simply in the business of selling our<br/>customers products.&quot;</p><p>LIBERATING IRAQ PRIZE -- Tom Brokaw</p><p>Interviewing a military analyst as U.S. jet bombers headed to Baghdad on</p><p>the first day of the Iraq war, NBC anchor Brokaw declared: &quot;Admiral<br/>McGinn, one of the things that we don&apos;t want to do is to destroy the<br/>infrastructure of Iraq, because in a few days we&apos;re going to own that<br/>country.&quot;</p><p>&quot;THE MORE YOU WATCH, THE LESS YOU KNOW&quot; PRIZE -- Fox News Channel</p><p>According to a University of Maryland study, most Americans who get<br/>their news from commercial TV harbored at least one of three<br/>&quot;misperceptions&quot; about the Iraq war: that weapons of mass destruction<br/>had been discovered in Iraq, that evidence closely linking Iraq to Al<br/>Qaeda had been found, or that world opinion approved of the U.S.<br/>invasion. Fox News viewers were the most confused about key facts, with<br/>80 percent embracing at least one of those misperceptions. The study<br/>found a correlation between being misinformed and being supportive of<br/>the war.</p><p>&quot;CLEAR IT WITH THE PENTAGON&quot; AWARD -- CNN</p><p>A month after the invasion of Iraq began, CNN executive Eason Jordan<br/>admitted on his network&apos;s &quot;Reliable Sources&quot; show (April 20) that CNN<br/>had allowed U.S. military officials to help screen its on-air analysts:<br/>&quot;I went to the Pentagon myself several times before the war started and<br/>met with important people there and said, for instance -- &apos;At CNN, here<br/>are the generals we&apos;re thinking of retaining to advise us on the air and</p><p>off about the war&apos; -- and we got a big thumbs-up on all of them. That<br/>was important.&quot;</p><p>&quot;CONSERVATIVE TIMES FOR THE &apos;LIBERAL&apos; MEDIA&quot; AWARD -- ABC News</p><p>Over the years, ABC correspondent John Stossel became known for<br/>one-sided, often-inaccurate reporting on behalf of his pro-corporate,<br/>&quot;greed is good&quot; ideology. He boasted that his on-air job was to &quot;explain</p><p>the beauties of the free market,&quot; received lecture fees from corporate<br/>pressure groups, and even spoke on Capitol Hill against<br/>consumer-protection regulation. In May of this year, when Stossel was<br/>promoted to co-anchor of ABC&apos;s &quot;20/20,&quot; a network insider told TV Guide:</p><p>&quot;These are conservative times. ... The network wants somebody to match<br/>the times.&quot;</p><p>&quot;CODDLING DONALD&quot; PRIZE -- CBS&apos;s Lesley Stahl, ABC&apos;s Peter Jennings and<br/>Others</p><p>On the day news broke about Saddam Hussein&apos;s capture, Stahl and Jennings</p><p>each interviewed Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. In step with their<br/>mainstream media colleagues, both failed to ask about Rumsfeld&apos;s cordial</p><p>1983 meeting with Hussein in Baghdad on behalf of the Reagan<br/>administration that opened up strong diplomatic and military ties<br/>between the U.S. government and the dictator that lasted through seven<br/>years of his worst brutality.</p><p>MILITARY GROUPIE PRIZE -- Katie Couric of NBC&apos;s &quot;Today&quot; Show</p><p>&quot;Well, Commander Thompson,&quot; said Couric on April 3, in the midst of the<br/>invasion carnage, &quot;thanks for talking with us at this very early hour<br/>out there. And I just want you to know, I think Navy SEALs rock.&quot;</p><p>NOBLESSE OBLIGE OCCUPATION AWARD -- Thomas Friedman, New York Times</p><p>In a Nov. 30 piece, Times columnist Friedman gushed that &quot;this war (in<br/>Iraq) is the most important liberal, revolutionary U.S.<br/>democracy-building project since the Marshall Plan.&quot; He lauded the war<br/>as &quot;one of the noblest things this country has ever attempted abroad.&quot;<br/>Friedman did not mention the estimated 112 billion barrels of oil in<br/>Iraq ... or the continuous deceptions that led to the &quot;noble&quot;<br/>enterprise.</p><p>___________________________________</p><p>Norman Solomon is co-author of &quot;Target Iraq: What the News Media Didn&apos;t<br/>Tell You.&quot;</p><p>====<br/>2.

The governor&apos;s action to cut $150 million from this year&apos;s<br/>budget -- initiated to help fund the car tax rollback -- included a $2<br/>million hit on the University of California&apos;s Institute for Labor and<br/>Employment.</p><p>H.D. Palmer, spokesman for the GOP governor&apos;s Department of Finance,<br/>said the cut was part of Schwarzenegger&apos;s effort to resolve the<br/>state&apos;s budget mess and was not intended to reflect any ideological<br/>slant. &quot;Our focus was to identify areas where savings could be<br/>achieved while at the same time maintaining the core mission (of the<br/>university),&quot; Palmer said. &quot;We did that in a number of areas. And this<br/>is one of them.&quot;</p><p>Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg, D-Los Angeles, said Schwarzenegger&apos;s<br/>elimination of the labor institute sends a strong signal about his<br/>thinking when it comes to working people&apos;s efforts to move up in<br/>society.</p><p>&quot;His view of the world, by his first actions here, is, &apos;Them&apos;s that<br/>got is going to get more, and them&apos;s that haven&apos;t, to heck with you,&apos;<br/>&quot; Goldberg said.</p><p>Founded in 2000, the institute has directed nearly $5.5 million in<br/>state funding into more than 300 research projects, some of which have<br/>found their way into the hottest public policy debates in California,<br/>including the recently enacted &quot;pay or play&quot; health insurance bill.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;re really the only unit in the University of California that does<br/>outreach to working people and the labor movement,&quot; said ILE Director<br/>Ruth Milkman, a UCLA sociology professor.</p><p>The 20 to 30 employees at the institute&apos;s offices at UCLA and UC<br/>Berkeley stand to lose their jobs as a result of the cut. Milkman said<br/>the institute has not decided how to respond to Schwarzenegger&apos;s<br/>budget action.</p><p>If the Schwarzenegger administration hesitated to discuss the<br/>ideological implications of the ILE&apos;s demise, conservative groups and<br/>business lobbyists jumped at the opportunity.</p><p>&quot;This body operates like a taxpayer-funded, pro-union think tank,<br/>churning out endless reports that promote a pro-labor union ideology<br/>and a labor union agenda,&quot; said Matt Tennis, legislative director for<br/>the Associated Builders and Contractors.</p><p>California labor leaders, however, deplored the cuts to the ILE as<br/>particularly drastic when 40 percent of the state work force is<br/>earning less than it did 15 years ago, according to a study released<br/>this year by the California Budget Project. Moreover, they say the<br/>university&apos;s labor-oriented research funding pales in comparison with<br/>the amounts directed to the system&apos;s agriculture and business schools<br/>-- $40 million, by the unions&apos; count.</p><p>&quot;We think this is a clear attack on academic freedom,&quot; said Tom<br/>Rankin, president of the California Labor Federation.</p><p>Rankin is a member of the institute&apos;s governing council, a position<br/>that opponents believe colors the ILE&apos;s research.</p><p>&quot;I think the ILE has every right to promulgate their anti-capitalist<br/>views and pro-labor political agenda, but I don&apos;t think taxpayers<br/>should be forced to bankroll their opinions,&quot; said Lawrence McQuillan<br/>of the San Francisco-based Pacific Research Institute.</p><p>For his part, Rankin said the UC Berkeley and UCLA business schools<br/>are researching &quot;how to manage and how to deal with unions&quot; and that<br/>their advisory boards are loaded with corporate titans. One of them,<br/>Gerald L. Parsky, a member of the Board of Visitors of UCLA&apos;s Anderson<br/>School of Business, was appointed Thursday to head President Bush&apos;s<br/>re-election campaign in California.</p><p>In the institute&apos;s three years of existence, ILE-backed researchers<br/>have plowed into issues ranging from a living wage campaign in Santa<br/>Barbara to labor rights in the global high-tech industry.</p><p>This year, the institute is researching a Teamsters campaign to<br/>organize truck drivers in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.<br/>Another project is trying to hash out an alliance between nonprofit,<br/>low-cost housing developers and the building trades unions. The ILE<br/>funds also financed a conference on garment worker unionization<br/>campaigns in California and around the world, among other items.</p><p>Rather than gather dust on ivory tower shelves, ILE research has been<br/>thrust into controversial policy issues such as the state-mandated,<br/>employer-funded health insurance bill. In September, the ILE released<br/>a report in the middle of the Legislature&apos;s debate over the bill that<br/>showed significant employer support for the measure despite lobbying<br/>efforts by big business groups to kill it. The bill, SB 2, was passed<br/>by the Legislature and signed into law by former Gov. Gray Davis.</p><p>The ILE also produces a voluminous annual report called &quot;The State of<br/>California Labor.&quot; This year, the institute reported that union<br/>membership in the state has increased by 500,000 over the past six<br/>years, climbing to 18 percent of the work force, a departure from<br/>national figures that showed a decline in union membership to 13<br/>percent over the same period. The 2003 report also documented<br/>&quot;substantial&quot; upward mobility among immigrant workers.</p><p>University of California spokesman Brad Hayward said eliminating the<br/>ILE is the latest in what has amounted to several hundred million<br/>dollars in budget reductions the system has endured over the past<br/>three years.</p><p>&quot;These are programs that have a major impact on both our understanding<br/>of the world around us as well as on the development of new<br/>technologies and products and innovations,&quot; Hayward said. &quot;Every<br/>additional cut is an additional increment of pain.&quot;<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/25/2003 1:49:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi kraig,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, kraig grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ANNOUNCING THE P.U.-LITZER PRIZES FOR 2003<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By Norman Solomon / Creators Syndicate<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...
