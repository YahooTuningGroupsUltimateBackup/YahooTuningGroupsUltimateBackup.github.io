Some guy tried stealing A CASSETTE.<br/>I had heard about things like this but I was there at the time.  They had<br/>him in handcuffs and put him in the front of the store so that people<br/>walking in could see him and go tsk tsk tsk and know that he was a criminal.<br/>Turns out it&apos;s a common practice.  I&apos;ve seen people hauled away for various<br/>things in NYC and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen such a display of<br/>testosterone when the Sheriff showed up.  There were like three or four<br/>cars, all with the bubbles flashing, read the guy his rights with a few<br/>dozen people gathered around like it was a ceremony.  And they pretty much<br/>DRAGGED him out of there.  This was for A CASSETTE.</p><p>James Dean is from Indianapolis.  Do you know why he&apos;s such a hero there?<br/>Because he&apos;s the only person from there who was ever SMART ENOUGH TO LEAVE.<br/>And the kids that worship him will tell you that.  Big eyes.  *I&apos;M* gonna<br/>get outa here someday too, by golly.</p><p>And several, several times, as soon as people found out I was from New York,<br/>they&apos;d say aw hell I HATE THE KNICKS and walk away mid sentence.</p><p>Marc</p></div><h3>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2002 7:53:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 3/15/02 7:56 PM, &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; hmm . . . wouldn&apos;t l. a. be even worse?</p><p>L.A. has plenty of music and art scenes happening.

The campus was littered with empty bottles<br/>every Saturday morning.</p><p>The state did have a tax surplus when I was there in &apos;95-96.<br/>I&apos;m fairly certain it came from the huge influx of people,<br/>the biggest real-estate expansion in the 50 states at the<br/>time, or so I was told.  Most of those people were from<br/>coastal cities, who probably found 10,000-acre farms turned<br/>into cul-de-sac&apos;d, for-profit developements with look-alike,<br/>vinyl-sided homes sold at relatively low (compared to the<br/>city, but high for Indiana) prices like $120-200K a nice<br/>thing.

Both involved trusting the<br/>wrong person at the wrong moment.  The first was a robbery.  I thought a<br/>laptop was such a commodity.  After 10 years of collecting Mac artifacts, it<br/>seemed it didn&apos;t actually take the $25,000 I&apos;d projected to replace all my<br/>software.  And this might be a good time to reflect on the fact that I have<br/>a very good setup, much better than anything I&apos;d ever thought I&apos;d get back.<br/>I wasn&apos;t too worried when the laptop got stolen because I actually had about<br/>400 disks of all backups of everything.  Which went with the second<br/>incident, which was just an act of sheer stupidity.  So I lost a lot of midi<br/>work, lyrics, a lot of notes... Pretty much everything.</p><p>The first incident was followed with my first heart attack.  The second one<br/>was followed with me calling Angie and saying come pick me up I don&apos;t care<br/>where we go let&apos;s just get out of where we are.  And so begun the famous<br/>road trip, leading us to Columbus Ohio, then NYC, my second heart attack, on<br/>to the famous Indianapolis for two years, her hometown for a year and then<br/>finally back to NYC.</p><p>Staying this time.</p><p>Marc</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2002 5:02:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Orphon Soul, Inc.&quot; &lt;tuning@...&gt;</p><p>&gt; The first incident was followed with my first heart attack.
