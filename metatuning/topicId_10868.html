His 26 aerial kills made him a hero at<br/>home Â— an early symbol of American air power. Not directly<br/>associated with the rise of a separate Air Force, he still embodied<br/>its spirit. &quot;Courage is doing what you&apos;re afraid to do,&quot; he<br/>said. &quot;There can be no courage unless you&apos;re scared.&quot;</p><p>___________________________________________________________________</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tarawa">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tarawa</a></p><p>The Battle of Tarawa was a battle in the Pacific Theatre of World<br/>War II, largely fought from November 20-23, 1943. It was the second<br/>time the United States was on the offensive (the Battle of<br/>Guadalcanal had been the first), and the first offensive in the<br/>critical central Pacific region. It was also the first time in the<br/>war that the United States faced serious Japanese opposition to a US<br/>amphibious landing. Previous landings met little or no initial<br/>resistance; Tarawa was to be different.</p><p>The American invasion force was the largest yet put together for a<br/>single operation, consisting of 17 aircraft carriers, 12<br/>battleships, 8 heavy and 4 light cruisers, 66 destroyers and 36<br/>transports. The force carried the 2nd Marine Division and a part of<br/>the 27th Infantry Division, for a total of about 35,000 soldiers and<br/>Marines.</p><p>(More at link, much of Wikipedia info NOT posted here)</p><p>Only 17 Japanese and 129 Koreans were alive at the end of the<br/>battle. Total Japanese and Korean casualties are about 4,690 killed<br/>in action. For the United States, about 1,000 were killed in action,<br/>and a further 2,200 wounded. The heavy casualties sparked off a<br/>storm of protest in the United States, where the high losses could<br/>not be understood for such a tiny and seemingly unimportant island.</p><p><a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/USMC-M-Tarawa/USMC-M-Tarawa-">http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/USMC-M-Tarawa/USMC-M-Tarawa-</a><br/>7.html</p><p>There were many other lessons learned at Tarawa. Reports submitted<br/>at the close of the operation are filled with them. Constructive<br/>criticism, comments, suggestions, and ideas provided a wealth of<br/>material that was quickly disseminated so that others might benefit.</p><p>There had to be a Tarawa. This was the inevitable point at which<br/>untried doctrine was at length tried in the crucible of battle. The<br/>lessons learned at Tarawa had to be learned somewhere in the course<br/>of the war, and it now seems providential that they were learned as<br/>early and at no greater cost than was involved.</p><p>Had there been no Tarawa to point the way, those lessons would have<br/>remained unlearned until they were driven home with even greater<br/>force in the Marshalls, in the Marianas, at Peleliu, or on Iwo Jima.<br/>The last operation, which occurred 14 months after Tarawa, parallels<br/>more closely than any other battle of the war the bitter fight on<br/>Betio, and it was there, if ever, that the experience of Tarawa<br/>sustained and facilitated victory.</p><p>Tarawa was the key to the Gilberts, which in turn was one of the<br/>keys that unlocked the Marshalls. The key to victory at Tarawa,<br/>however, in the last analysis, was the individual Marine. His<br/>disciplined fighting ability and courage came into sharper focus,<br/>perhaps, than ever before in World War II. His strength, however,<br/>important as an individual, found real effectiveness in the over-all<br/>collective effort, the effort of the task force.</p><p>-Stephen</p></div>
