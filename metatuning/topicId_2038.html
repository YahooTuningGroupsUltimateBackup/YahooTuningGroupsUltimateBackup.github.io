If I&apos;m in the right state of mind, I&apos;ll admit.  A few good things<br/>happened out there in between the trying to fit in.  Actually when we first<br/>got there I tend to remember there was a three-part-comical event... I don&apos;t<br/>actually remember the first two but I remember people being extremely<br/>helpful.</p><p>The third, though, Angie and I were trying to carry this huge box home from<br/>JCPenney, only about ehh 1/8 of a mile home.  But we had no car so you<br/>wouldn&apos;t know how far we were going.  So we&apos;re carrying this box with a<br/>kitchen table in it, and I hear this voice, &quot;y&apos;all need some help with<br/>that?&quot;  And I turn around and there&apos;s this like 70-80 year old woman and I&apos;m<br/>thinking &quot;oh COME ON!!!!!!&quot;... The punch line was &quot;oh my grandson has his<br/>car we can give ya a ride,&quot; pointing to a tall sturdy man probably in his<br/>30s.  The box gave us a struggle but he picked it up and just tossed it in<br/>his trunk.  It was just too funny.  Just to think this 4&apos;6&quot; woman was going<br/>to do the same.</p><p>(If I had said &quot;oh thank you it&apos;s been so hard relocating from New York<br/>and...&quot; I would have been interrupted with &quot;NEW YORK???
