For most it was their</p><p>first day&apos;s work in 10 months. Eager and emblazoned in the club&apos;s new<br/>red<br/>livery,<br/>they helped pull in a take that would have rivalled a busy night for the</p><p>Paddy&apos;s of old.</p><p>The new club has been dubbed Paddy&apos;s &quot;Reloaded&quot; ? after the Matrix movie<br/>of<br/>the same name, but there were flashes of familiarity everywhere ?<br/>especially<br/>for South Australian Taryn Hall, 15, who was in the club when the bomb<br/>went<br/>off.<br/>She had returned to Bali with her mother Carol and some friends.</p><p>&quot;We were about to leave,&quot; Ms Hall said of her ordeal last year. &quot;We were</p><p>waiting for a taxi but the taxi wasn&apos;t there so we came back to the<br/>dance<br/>floor<br/>and as we turned around the bomb went off.&quot;</p><p>Ms Hall then nearly became another victim, running out the front door of</p><p>Paddy&apos;s and turning right towards the Sari Club. The terrorists had<br/>planned<br/>to use<br/>the smaller explosion in Paddy&apos;s to force a spillway of panicked patrons</p><p>into<br/>the path of the devastating Sari Club bomb.</p><p>The bomb knocked Ms Hall to the ground but she escaped with six stitches<br/>and<br/>some bruises.</p><p>Paddy&apos;s co-owner Gede Wiratha said the reopening sent an important<br/>message<br/>to<br/>jittery would-be tourists.</p><p>&quot;The community of Kuta . . . want to show to the people around the world</p><p>that<br/>Bali is still alive,&quot; said Mr Wiratha, who is also the chairman of<br/>Bali&apos;s<br/>tourism board. &quot;Bali is still like before, it is safe and in harmony and</p><p>still<br/>concerned with tourism and culture.&quot;</p><p>Another Australian patron, Dave Campbell, said he was more excited than<br/>nervous about visiting Paddy&apos;s again.</p><p>&quot;They are not going to stop us here,&quot; he said. &quot;We are back, come on<br/>back,<br/>guys. Everything&apos;s like it was.&quot;</p><p>The new Paddy&apos;s is about 100m further south along Jalan Legian from its<br/>predecessor, which like the demolished Sari Club is now vacant land,<br/>occupied only<br/>by banana groves. There are no plans to reopen the Sari Club, where most<br/>of<br/>the 202 victims were killed.</p><p>------------------------------------------<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
