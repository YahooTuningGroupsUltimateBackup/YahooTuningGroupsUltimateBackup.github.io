Successful societies protect<br/>freedom with the consistent and impartial rule of law, instead of<br/>selecting applying -- selectively applying the law to punish<br/>political opponents. Successful societies allow room for healthy<br/>civic institutions -- for political parties and labor unions and<br/>independent newspapers and broadcast media. Successful societies<br/>guarantee religious liberty -- the right to serve and honor God<br/>without fear of persecution. Successful societies privatize their<br/>economies, and secure the rights of property. They prohibit and<br/>punish official corruption, and invest in the health and education<br/>of their people. They recognize the rights of women. And instead<br/>of directing hatred and resentment against others, successful<br/>societies appeal to the hopes of their own people.&quot;</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
