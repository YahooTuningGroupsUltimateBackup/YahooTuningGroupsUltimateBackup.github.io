Currently in the<br/>midst of a lawsuit that may well see her returned to Congress with full<br/>seniority, she has become a living reminder for politicians around the<br/>country that there are questions to be answered and that undefeated and<br/>dedicated voices with growing strength on the political battlefield<br/>are not afraid to demand full accountability.</p><p>The truth never disappears.</p><p>In a recent speech in Harlem, McKinney offered some sobering and very<br/>direct observations about race relations in America, 9/11, civil<br/>liberties, independent media, From The Wilderness and our national ad<br/>campaign which is encountering stiff, unethical, and unconstitutional<br/>resistance from major publications which seem to be continually<br/>resetting the height of the bar we must clear in order to get the ads<br/>run. To<br/>clarify one point: While papers like The Boston Globe and The Atlanta<br/>Journal Constitution have refused to run the ad after checks were<br/>written to the brokerage firm and AFTER the papers had approved the it,<br/>no check has yet been written for The New York Times. The Times<br/>has simply reneged on a prior approval and agreement to run the ad. Each<br/>time FTW passes a new test, another one mysteriously appears.<br/>The powers that be are afraid of these ads. Yet they have seen nothing<br/>compared to the price they will pay when the stench of censorship<br/>becomes so blatant and obvious that the people realize that the most<br/>precious right of every American has been taken away.</p><p>Such censorship is not going unnoticed. The right of free speech and<br/>equal access is not one that can be violated without a reaction. ? MCR,<br/>August 5, 2003]</p><p>----------</p><p>How proud I am to stand at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem USA!</p><p>Thank you Reverend Butts, Bob, Ruby Dee, Ossie Davis, Sonia Sanchez,<br/>Ralph Carter, Hakim, the Coalition of Artists and Activists, and all<br/>who worked hard to put this rally together.  And thank you for inviting<br/>me.</p><p>How appropriate that we gather here at this Church, with all its rich<br/>history of proud resistance and indignant defiance of a social order<br/>that<br/>relegated the giants of their day to second class citizenship.</p><p>And what an honor for me, to stand among the giants of our day, if only<br/>for a moment, and see America&apos;s landscape from their gaze.</p><p>What this rally means, is that America&apos;s vista has now become as ravaged<br/>in its pristine hillside villas as it has always been for those of us<br/>who<br/>muddle</p><p>behind the cities&apos; shadows.</p><p>Our people are dying.</p><p>On the streets of America our people are dying.</p><p>Gathered tonight in this room are people from all walks of life; and for<br/>that reason, this is a very dangerous meeting for the powers that be.</p><p>They would like to see us divided.</p><p>I&apos;m not just saying that.  They wrote that in their COINTELPRO papers;<br/>about how they would keep blacks separated from each other, and<br/>separated from Africans, and separated from other people of color, and<br/>most importantly, separated from progressive activist whites.  They<br/>wrote that they would discredit black activists so they would lose favor<br/>within their community and within our American community.  They<br/>also wrote that they would replace authentic black leaders with what<br/>they called &quot;clean Negroes&quot; whom they had groomed to be more loyal to<br/>them than to us.  Those aren&apos;t my words, they&apos;re their words.</p><p>Well, they were silly enough to write it down, and we were smart enough<br/>to read it.  So we&apos;re not fooled.</p><p>But the Coalition of Artists and Activists has come together to show us<br/>that now is the time for us to get busy.  And take our country back.</p><p>I, for one, can say that I am tired of burying innocent black and Latino<br/>people who die at the hands of this unjust system.</p><p>New Yorkers have buried too many loved ones and shed too many tears.</p><p>But sadly, every major city in America can probably call a roll: Ousmane<br/>Zongo, Alberta Spruill, Patrick Dorismond, Amadou Diallo; and<br/>those are just the names I know.</p><p>Not too far from here, the streets of Benton Harbor, Michigan exploded<br/>because they got tired of adding names to their roll.  It wasn&apos;t enough<br/>that Terrance Shurn and Arthur Patterson, young adults, were on the<br/>list, but those names only topped off 16-year old Eric McGinnis and<br/>7-year old Trent Patterson, who had also made the list.</p><p>I read that the NAACP called for calm and dialogue.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry, but I can&apos;t be calm if my baby is going to be shot or hurt by<br/>out-of-control police.</p><p>I can&apos;t be calm when I drive through sections of Atlanta that look more<br/>like Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo than America.</p><p>I cannot be calm.</p><p>Dialogue must be followed by swift and deliberate action to root out<br/>racism at its very core.  From a California gas station to a Mississippi</p><p>Lockheed plant; from Cincinnati, Ohio to Benton Harbor, Michigan; to New<br/>York City, New York.  And in Belle Glade, Florida where a<br/>young black man was found hanging from a tree, with his hands tied<br/>behind his back and the authorities call it suicide.  In the 21st<br/>Century,<br/>America&apos;s trees still bear Strange Fruit.</p><p>How much injustice can any community absorb before an eruption of<br/>extraordinary proportions occurs?</p><p>And yes, we have our list in Georgia, too.</p><p>And so, placing troops in Cincinnati Ohio or in Benton Harbor to restore<br/>calm and &quot;protect property&quot; is about as helpful for the resolution of<br/>the problems of Ohio, or Michigan, or for that matter Black America as<br/>it is to place US troops in Liberia to resolve the problems on West<br/>Africa&apos;s oil-rich shore.</p><p>Or, for that matter, in the hot, oil-rich desert sands of Iraq.</p><p>And while the South Bend Tribune blared on its editorial page that<br/>Benton Harbor rioters must be held accountable, who will blare, if not<br/>us,<br/>that America must be held accountable for the sick and depraved<br/>conditions under which millions of our people now live.</p><p>Moreover, since that newspaper called for &quot;accountability,&quot; I wonder,<br/>have I ever seen that word in the corporate press when describing the<br/>Bush Administration?</p><p>Now it is a fact that it was the Ashcroft Justice Department that gave<br/>law enforcement officials authority to use the no-knock warrant, like<br/>the<br/>one that resulted in the death of Mrs. Spruill.</p><p>But, I&apos;m wondering where are the no-knock warrants for the Carlyle<br/>Group, Enron, DynCorp, Halliburton, Worldcom, HealthSouth, all the<br/>off-shore companies that fled our country to avoid paying taxes yet<br/>continue to get billions in federal contracts?</p><p>Where are their no-knock warrants?</p><p>And further, on this matter of accountability.</p><p>George Tenet recently &quot;fell on the sword&quot; as they say and took<br/>responsibility for the 16 untrue words that happened to find their way<br/>into<br/>George Bush&apos;s State of the Union Address.</p><p>But who among this Administration will take responsibility for the<br/>tragic events of September 11th and the tremendous intelligence failures</p><p>that cost the lives of thousands of people who live and work in New York<br/>City?</p><p>Interestingly, I was the one who called for an investigation of<br/>September 11th asking the fully appropriate question, What did the Bush<br/>Administration know and when did it know it, about the tragic events of<br/>September 11th?</p><p>Both President Bush and Vice President Cheney asked Tom Daschle not to<br/>investigate what went wrong on September 11th.  An Australian<br/>newspaper ran the headline, &quot;Bosses so lax, agents felt they were<br/>spies.&quot;  They were describing our FBI.</p><p>&quot;Bosses so lax, agents felt they were spies.&quot;</p><p>To this day that I know of no one in any decision-making position in the<br/>whole of this Administration has accepted responsibility for failing<br/>the American people.  Instead, from this Administration we have<br/>obstruction, obfuscation, dissembling, and deception.</p><p>And yet, the one who did her homework, and told the truth to the<br/>American people, that our investment of trillions of dollars in the<br/>defense<br/>and intelligence infrastructures of our country should not have all<br/>failed simultaneously four times on a single day and since they did, we<br/>deserve to know why they did. . .</p><p>Well, that&apos;s the person who got fired.</p><p>Meanwhile, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who remain in office, have the<br/>nerve to launch two simultaneous wars, at least one that is against<br/>international law; award no bid contracts to their friends in the<br/>defense industry; erode our Constitution and our Bill of Rights; put<br/>Paul<br/>Wolfowitz in charge of military tribunals (that same travesty of justice<br/>that we have excoriated other countries for in the past); put a felon,<br/>convicted of lying to Congress, in charge of our privacy; and lie about<br/>the rescue of Jessica Lynch, as well as the landing of America&apos;s top<br/>gun&iuml;&iquest;&half;George W.--on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln, which supposedly<br/>was out at sea, but that was really in San Diego harbor.</p><p>And this all comes after they stole the Presidency on the uncounted<br/>chads of black and Latino voters in a scheme that was orchestrated at<br/>the<br/>top.</p><p>Republicans rewarded Katherine Harris with a Congressional seat.</p><p>In Georgia, 48,000 Republicans crossed over and voted in the Democratic<br/>Primary for the black woman Republican that they had drafted to<br/>run in my Democratic Primary.  Georgia and national Democrats failed to<br/>protect the integrity of their own primary.  Terry McAuliffe crows<br/>today about protecting Gray Davis from any Democratic challenge in a<br/>primary, but where was he when he could have protected this black<br/>loyal Democratic woman from a known Republican shill acting for the Bush<br/>Administration?</p><p>And it&apos;s not enough for this Administration to accept responsibility for<br/>failing the American people.  So too must the corporate media.<br/>Including the New York Times.</p><p>As you may know, I&apos;m involved with Mike Ruppert of From the Wilderness<br/>in a national campaign that is placing anti-Bush ads in<br/>newspapers all across the country.  Sadly, many newspapers are saying no<br/>to the paid ad or are giving us a hard time after they&apos;ve accepted the<br/>money.  The New York Times is no exception.</p><p>At the top of the ad is a cartoon.  It features the big corporate media<br/>being &quot;played&quot; from behind the curtain by the great big, huge, Wizard.<br/>Like in the Wizard of Oz.  But there, ever so small, at the bottom of<br/>the cartoon, is Toto, the little dog, pulling open the curtain and<br/>exposing<br/>the truth about the big, corporate media&iuml;&iquest;&half;kinda like BAI does here.  And<br/>the alternative media do all over our country.  Well, in the cartoon,<br/>Toto is the alternative media--getting the truth out to the people.</p><p>The text mentions oil, missing money from DoD and HUD accounts, the<br/>impeachment clause of the Constitution, the lawsuit that has been<br/>filed against the crossover voting in my election, and a special message<br/>from me.</p><p>My special message in the ad is this:</p><p>&quot;Beware the Land of Oz.  For it is only in the land of Oz that a handful<br/>of vainglorious men could send hundreds of thousands of young<br/>soldiers off to fight in an illegal war.  And only in the Land of Oz can<br/>The Grand Wizard erode basic civil rights and call it enhanced<br/>security.  And where but in Oz could a felon, convicted of lying in<br/>public, be put in charge of Total Information Awareness?  75 million<br/>Americans had no health insurance in 2001 or 2002. Unemployment is at an<br/>8-year high.  Meanwhile, at the Wizard&apos;s court, men of dubious<br/>reputation gorge themselves at the people&apos;s expense.  Expose the Grand<br/>Wizard; this is our America, not Oz.&quot;</p><p>Now, just a few days ago, I received a message through the ad agency<br/>placing the ad that before The New York Times will run it, I need to<br/>prove that what I say about Oz is true.  Can you believe. . . The New<br/>York Times is fact-checking cartoons now?</p><p>Or is it just this cartoon?</p><p>They didn&apos;t bother to fact-check their story about me that&apos;s recounted<br/>in Greg Palast&apos;s book, &quot;The Best Democracy Money Can Buy.&quot;  They<br/>just printed lies about me in an effort to make sure that a black<br/>Republican woman from New York City who is anti-affirmative action and<br/>anti-reparations would sit at the table of the Congressional Black<br/>Caucus and represent you in Washington, DC.</p><p>In 1776, it was King George III who drove the titans of the American<br/>colony to write our Declaration of Independence.  They wrote that<br/>there are certain unalienable rights and that it is the responsibility<br/>of government to protect, preserve, and promote these rights.  However,<br/>in<br/>the words of its signers,</p><p>&quot;when a long train of abuses and usurpations, . . . evinces a design to<br/>reduce [a people to life] under absolute Despotism, it is their right,<br/>it is<br/>their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for<br/>their future security.&quot;</p><p>And with that, a rebellion became a revolution.</p><p>My mother didn&apos;t want me to give this speech tonight.  I&apos;m sure it&apos;s<br/>hard for her to read the terrible things the corporate press and<br/>right-wing<br/>activists write about me.</p><p>In today&apos;s America, she&apos;s right.  I will probably get in trouble for<br/>what I&apos;ve said to you tonight.  But it won&apos;t be the first time I get in<br/>trouble<br/>for telling the truth.  And I&apos;ll continue to tell the truth.  As I have<br/>said before, I won&apos;t sit down and I won&apos;t shut up.</p><p>I agree with Dead Prez:  We need a revolution!</p><p>And it needs to start with us.</p><p>Thank you so much for inviting me to be with you tonight.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
