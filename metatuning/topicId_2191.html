That<br/>&gt; they are encouraging suicide which is prohibited by the<br/>&gt; Koran shows that they not only htave no respect<br/>&gt; whatsoever for Islam, but must deeply hate the<br/>&gt; Palestinians to want to pay them to kill themselves.<br/>&gt; Of course we know from the history of the region that<br/>&gt; the Arabs deeply hate and oppress the Palestitians,<br/>&gt; while sadistically manipulating them for the political<br/>&gt; power goals of the psychotic Arabian despots.]</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3>X.
