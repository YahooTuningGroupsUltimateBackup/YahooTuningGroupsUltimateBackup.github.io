I think you have been<br/>a victim of one of these, for his own purposes, not those of music or<br/>art.</p><p>A nice definition: <a href="http://members.aol.com/intwg/trolls.htm">http://members.aol.com/intwg/trolls.htm</a><br/>Wiki&apos;s less apologetic definition:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll</a> where you can find this:</p><p>&quot;The term trolling, originated as a fishing metaphor: like people who<br/>troll for fish, people on the internet were dragging a conversational<br/>lure through a group, baiting for a particular response, often anger<br/>or argument.&quot;</p><p>And finally, the definitive, if not work-safe description:<br/><a href="http://thingy.apana.org.au/~fun/fsckhead.html">http://thingy.apana.org.au/~fun/fsckhead.html</a></p><p>Prent Rodgers</p></div><h3>alternativetuning &#x3C;alternativetuning@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2004 11:02:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Prent Rodgers&quot; &lt;prentrodgers@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; You have been victimized by a Troll.</p><p>Thank you very much.
