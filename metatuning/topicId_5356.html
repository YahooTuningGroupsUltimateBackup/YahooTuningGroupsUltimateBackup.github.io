It&apos;s not as true today<br/>&gt; &gt; as it was during his lifetime, but to a large degree it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; still more true of music than of any other art-form.  Most<br/>&gt; &gt; musical compositions require an outside body of performers<br/>&gt; &gt; for their realization, with the resultant need for cooperation<br/>&gt; &gt; and standardization that artists working in other media don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; have to deal with.  Thus, the concommitant conservatism about<br/>&gt; &gt; changing the status-quo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this discussion began on the tuning-math list, right<br/>&gt; at the time when i was working out my study of the<br/>&gt; &quot;rational implications&quot; of Schoenberg&apos;s theory as<br/>&gt; presented in his 1911 book _Harmonielehre_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; thus, i&apos;m surprised that at that time i didn&apos;t mention<br/>&gt; Schoenberg in connection with what i wrote here, because<br/>&gt; i had already come to the conclusion that it was primarily<br/>&gt; for reasons of his own career survival that he decided<br/>&gt; to abandon his quarter-tone experiments and stick<br/>&gt; with 12edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Schoenberg maintained at several points in his book<br/>&gt; that microtonality would surely become practical for<br/>&gt; use in the future ... but that at that time (1910)<br/>&gt; microtonality was not a practical choice for a composer<br/>&gt; who wished to have his music performed (mainly because<br/>&gt; of the lack of suitably tuned instruments).  thus, his<br/>&gt; decision to stay with 12edo but use it in a new way<br/>&gt; (which we now call &quot;free atonality&quot;, but which he<br/>&gt; called &quot;pantonality&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; what&apos;s really interesting to see are the changes which<br/>&gt; Schoenberg made to the revised 3rd edition of _Harmonielehre_<br/>&gt; which appeared in 1922, just after he made public his<br/>&gt; invention of the &quot;Method of Composing with Twelve Tones<br/>&gt; Which are Related Only with One Another&quot; (now called<br/>&gt; &quot;serialism&quot;).  he removed or softened many of his 1910<br/>&gt; pronouncements about microtonality, since he felt, as he<br/>&gt; announced in his new method in 1921: &quot;I have made a<br/>&gt; discovery that will ensure the superiority of German music<br/>&gt; for the next 100 years.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; unfortunately, the only complete English translation<br/>&gt; available for the _Harmonielehre_ is Roy Carter&apos;s 1978<br/>&gt; version, titled _Theory of Harmony_, and it&apos;s based<br/>&gt; on the 1922 edition.  Carter mentions the most important<br/>&gt; changes made by Schoenberg in footnotes, in two cases<br/>&gt; even including translations of several sentences which<br/>&gt; Schoenberg removed or modified.  but it would be nice<br/>&gt; to have a complete English text of the 1911 version.<br/>&gt; i&apos;ve been translating chunks of it myself when i find<br/>&gt; a big discrepancy between the two editions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the original 1911 version of _Harmonielehre_ was written<br/>&gt; right after Schoenberg had made his most radical experiments<br/>&gt; in the first group of &quot;atonal&quot; pieces (listed here in<br/>&gt; order of composition):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Quartet no. 2, F-sharp minor, op. 10 (1907/08)<br/>&gt;  15 poems from _Das Buch der h&iuml;&iquest;&half;ngenden G&iuml;&iquest;&half;rten_, op. 15 (1908/09)<br/>&gt;  3 pieces for piano, op. 11 (1909)<br/>&gt;  5 pieces for orchestra, op. 16 (1909)<br/>&gt;  Erwartung [Expectation], op. 17 (1909) (soprano, orchestra)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; he had not yet formulated a new &quot;method&quot; for the<br/>&gt; manipulation of the harmony in his music, and was<br/>&gt; at this point more interested in freeing music from<br/>&gt; the restrictions imposed by &quot;traditional tonality&quot;,<br/>&gt; so that his compositions could &quot;express pure feeling&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; none of Schoenberg&apos;s quarter-tone experiments have<br/>&gt; come to light -- those sketches were probably destroyed<br/>&gt; in World War 2 -- but based on the survival of some<br/>&gt; microtonal sketches of Webern songs, also on poems by<br/>&gt; Stefan George, i have concluded that Schoenberg played<br/>&gt; around with quarter-tones in the voice parts of some<br/>&gt; of the later songs from _Das Buch der h&iuml;&iquest;&half;ngenden G&iuml;&iquest;&half;rten_,<br/>&gt; in late 1908 and/or early 1909.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it was only a short-lived experiment, for by September<br/>&gt; 1909 he had written to Busoni that he had abandoned<br/>&gt; the idea of using microtones in his own compositions.<br/>&gt; Busoni had just sent Schoenberg a copy of his _Sketch for<br/>&gt; a  New Aesthetic of Music_, in which Busoni outlines<br/>&gt; 113 new scales that could be constructed in 12edo,<br/>&gt; then suggests using 1/3-tones, in the form of 36edo<br/>&gt; as two &quot;bike chains&quot; of 18edo a semitone apart.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Schoenberg, having just decided to give up microtonality,<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t put much stock in this last proposal, but Busoni&apos;s<br/>&gt; rhetoric does seem to have inspired Schoenberg to<br/>&gt; produce what i think is his most radical work of all,<br/>&gt; _Erwartung_, which he began composing immediately after<br/>&gt; this exchange with Busoni.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it&apos;s also important to note that, after struggling for<br/>&gt; years to find a publisher with whom he could hope to<br/>&gt; gain some financial security, immediately after composing<br/>&gt; _Erwartung_, Schoenberg signed a 10-year contract with<br/>&gt; Universal Edition, then the leading publisher -- and<br/>&gt; an aggressive promoter -- of &quot;new music&quot; in Vienna.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; when it came time for Schoenberg to write _Harmonielehre_<br/>&gt; in the summer of 1910 for his upcoming teaching job in<br/>&gt; September, he was clearly trying to formulate some<br/>&gt; suggestions on how to deal with the complex sonorities<br/>&gt; he had introduced in these pieces, especially _Erwartung_,<br/>&gt; and was just as clearly still interested in microtonality,<br/>&gt; at least intellectually.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but by the time the revised edition came out in 1922,<br/>&gt; he had hit on his new strategy for regulating the use<br/>&gt; of all 12 pitches of 12edo, and therefore no longer saw<br/>&gt; any need to promote the idea of microtones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but to relate all of this back to the original point ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the *reasons* which compelled Schoenberg to abandon<br/>&gt; microtones had to do with his survival as a composer.<br/>&gt; he emphasizes in _Harmonielehre_ that at that time<br/>&gt; (1910) there were too few instruments available which<br/>&gt; could produce those microtones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; of course, today we have talented performers who know<br/>&gt; how to produce quite specific microtonal pitches from<br/>&gt; regular orchestral instruments.  but in 1910 it&apos;s likely<br/>&gt; that instrumentalists had not yet figured out how to<br/>&gt; do that, and in fact that most wouldn&apos;t be the least<br/>&gt; bit interested in doing so.  at that time, the piano<br/>&gt; was clearly the &quot;king of instruments&quot; in the German<br/>&gt; musical world, and it was, almost universally, tuned<br/>&gt; in 12edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Schoenberg, having grown up in this musical mileu and<br/>&gt; almost entirely self-taught, was not aware of the<br/>&gt; history of Pythagorean and meantone tunings in European<br/>&gt; music (up to about 1500 for Pythagorean and 1850 for<br/>&gt; meantone).  and as he clearly states several times in<br/>&gt; _Harmonielehre_, aside from his more-or-less simplistic<br/>&gt; &quot;overtone model&quot;, he was also unaware of the mathematics<br/>&gt; of intonation.  he had &quot;perfect pitch&quot; and could hear<br/>&gt; overtones up to about the 11th harmonic, and he could<br/>&gt; hear that the 7th and 11th harmonics were tuned quite<br/>&gt; differently from their 12edo representations, but he<br/>&gt; was obviously unfamiliar with any actual use of tunings<br/>&gt; other than 12edo, or of a conception of tuning where<br/>&gt; the &quot;sharps&quot; and &quot;flats&quot; are different pitches, as in<br/>&gt; both Pythagorean and meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; many performers, audiences, and newspaper critics had<br/>&gt; already displayed a tremendously negative reaction to<br/>&gt; his &quot;atonal&quot; 12edo music in concerts of 1909 and 1910.<br/>&gt; but even outside of his immediate circle of students<br/>&gt; and supporters, Schoenberg did have a small group of<br/>&gt; admirers, and his new contract with Universal Edition<br/>&gt; gave him at least some small measure of confidence about<br/>&gt; the future of his work, and the possibility of earning<br/>&gt; income from it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it makes complete sense to me that at this juncture<br/>&gt; (1910), he would not have been willing to jeopardize<br/>&gt; the prospect of earning royalties from his compositions<br/>&gt; by using &quot;non-standard&quot; tunings.  it seems to me that<br/>&gt; this desire for standarization is what lies at the root<br/>&gt; of Schoenberg&apos;s rejection of microtonality and<br/>&gt; enshrinement of 12edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; if Schoenberg had been in a position to create his<br/>&gt; music entirely by himself, as Partch had the courage<br/>&gt; and skills to do for many years, and as we can do easily<br/>&gt; today, i think it&apos;s very likely that he *would* have made<br/>&gt; further explorations into the use of microtonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i find it one of the great ironies of music history<br/>&gt; that just at the time that microtonalists such as<br/>&gt; Mager, Mollendorf, and Haba began giving demonstrations<br/>&gt; and concerts involving quarter-tones in Vienna<br/>&gt; (around 1912-1918), Schoenberg moved to Berlin and<br/>&gt; thus missed the opportunity to actually experience<br/>&gt; quarter-tone music.  he had already been in contact<br/>&gt; with Josef Hauer during this period and had begun to<br/>&gt; formulate his 12-tone method.  perhaps if he had<br/>&gt; stayed in Vienna during those years, or if the<br/>&gt; microtonalists had begun their work just a few years<br/>&gt; earlier, Schoenberg might have been more favorable<br/>&gt; towards the actual implementation of microtonal music,<br/>&gt; and the history of 20th-century music may have turned<br/>&gt; out to be vastly different.  i just love to speculate ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;

It&apos;s not as true today<br/>&gt; as it was during his lifetime, but to a large degree it&apos;s<br/>&gt; still more true of music than of any other art-form.  Most<br/>&gt; musical compositions require an outside body of performers<br/>&gt; for their realization, with the resultant need for cooperation<br/>&gt; and standardization that artists working in other media don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have to deal with.  Thus, the concommitant conservatism about<br/>&gt; changing the status-quo.</p><p>this discussion began on the tuning-math list, right<br/>at the time when i was working out my study of the<br/>&quot;rational implications&quot; of Schoenberg&apos;s theory as<br/>presented in his 1911 book _Harmonielehre_.<br/>&gt; &gt; thus, i&apos;m surprised that at that time i didn&apos;t mention<br/>Schoenberg in connection with what i wrote here, because<br/>i had already come to the conclusion that it was primarily<br/>for reasons of his own career survival that he decided<br/>to abandon his quarter-tone experiments and stick<br/>with 12edo.</p><p>Schoenberg maintained at several points in his book<br/>that microtonality would surely become practical for<br/>use in the future ... but that at that time (1910)<br/>microtonality was not a practical choice for a composer<br/>who wished to have his music performed (mainly because<br/>of the lack of suitably tuned instruments).  thus, his<br/>decision to stay with 12edo but use it in a new way<br/>(which we now call &quot;free atonality&quot;, but which he<br/>called &quot;pantonality&quot;).</p><p>what&apos;s really interesting to see are the changes which<br/>Schoenberg made to the revised 3rd edition of _Harmonielehre_<br/>which appeared in 1922, just after he made public his<br/>invention of the &quot;Method of Composing with Twelve Tones<br/>Which are Related Only with One Another&quot; (now called<br/>&quot;serialism&quot;).  he removed or softened many of his 1910<br/>pronouncements about microtonality, since he felt, as he<br/>announced in his new method in 1921: &quot;I have made a<br/>discovery that will ensure the superiority of German music<br/>for the next 100 years.&quot;</p><p>unfortunately, the only complete English translation<br/>available for the _Harmonielehre_ is Roy Carter&apos;s 1978<br/>version, titled _Theory of Harmony_, and it&apos;s based<br/>on the 1922 edition.  Carter mentions the most important<br/>changes made by Schoenberg in footnotes, in two cases<br/>even including translations of several sentences which<br/>Schoenberg removed or modified.  but it would be nice<br/>to have a complete English text of the 1911 version.<br/>i&apos;ve been translating chunks of it myself when i find<br/>a big discrepancy between the two editions.</p><p>the original 1911 version of _Harmonielehre_ was written<br/>right after Schoenberg had made his most radical experiments<br/>in the first group of &quot;atonal&quot; pieces (listed here in<br/>order of composition):</p><p> Quartet no. 2, F-sharp minor, op. 10 (1907/08)<br/> 15 poems from _Das Buch der h&iuml;&iquest;&half;ngenden G&iuml;&iquest;&half;rten_, op. 15 (1908/09)<br/> 3 pieces for piano, op. 11 (1909)<br/> 5 pieces for orchestra, op. 16 (1909)<br/> Erwartung [Expectation], op. 17 (1909) (soprano, orchestra)</p><p>he had not yet formulated a new &quot;method&quot; for the<br/>manipulation of the harmony in his music, and was<br/>at this point more interested in freeing music from<br/>the restrictions imposed by &quot;traditional tonality&quot;,<br/>so that his compositions could &quot;express pure feeling&quot;.</p><p>none of Schoenberg&apos;s quarter-tone experiments have<br/>come to light -- those sketches were probably destroyed<br/>in World War 2 -- but based on the survival of some<br/>microtonal sketches of Webern songs, also on poems by<br/>Stefan George, i have concluded that Schoenberg played<br/>around with quarter-tones in the voice parts of some<br/>of the later songs from _Das Buch der h&iuml;&iquest;&half;ngenden G&iuml;&iquest;&half;rten_,<br/>in late 1908 and/or early 1909.</p><p>it was only a short-lived experiment, for by September<br/>1909 he had written to Busoni that he had abandoned<br/>the idea of using microtones in his own compositions.<br/>Busoni had just sent Schoenberg a copy of his _Sketch for<br/>a  New Aesthetic of Music_, in which Busoni outlines<br/>113 new scales that could be constructed in 12edo,<br/>then suggests using 1/3-tones, in the form of 36edo<br/>as two &quot;bike chains&quot; of 18edo a semitone apart.</p><p>Schoenberg, having just decided to give up microtonality,<br/>didn&apos;t put much stock in this last proposal, but Busoni&apos;s<br/>rhetoric does seem to have inspired Schoenberg to<br/>produce what i think is his most radical work of all,<br/>_Erwartung_, which he began composing immediately after<br/>this exchange with Busoni.</p><p>it&apos;s also important to note that, after struggling for<br/>years to find a publisher with whom he could hope to<br/>gain some financial security, immediately after composing<br/>_Erwartung_, Schoenberg signed a 10-year contract with<br/>Universal Edition, then the leading publisher -- and<br/>an aggressive promoter -- of &quot;new music&quot; in Vienna.</p><p>when it came time for Schoenberg to write _Harmonielehre_<br/>in the summer of 1910 for his upcoming teaching job in<br/>September, he was clearly trying to formulate some<br/>suggestions on how to deal with the complex sonorities<br/>he had introduced in these pieces, especially _Erwartung_,<br/>and was just as clearly still interested in microtonality,<br/>at least intellectually.</p><p>but by the time the revised edition came out in 1922,<br/>he had hit on his new strategy for regulating the use<br/>of all 12 pitches of 12edo, and therefore no longer saw<br/>any need to promote the idea of microtones.</p><p>but to relate all of this back to the original point ...</p><p>the *reasons* which compelled Schoenberg to abandon<br/>microtones had to do with his survival as a composer.<br/>he emphasizes in _Harmonielehre_ that at that time<br/>(1910) there were too few instruments available which<br/>could produce those microtones.</p><p>of course, today we have talented performers who know<br/>how to produce quite specific microtonal pitches from<br/>regular orchestral instruments.  but in 1910 it&apos;s likely<br/>that instrumentalists had not yet figured out how to<br/>do that, and in fact that most wouldn&apos;t be the least<br/>bit interested in doing so.  at that time, the piano<br/>was clearly the &quot;king of instruments&quot; in the German<br/>musical world, and it was, almost universally, tuned<br/>in 12edo.</p><p>Schoenberg, having grown up in this musical mileu and<br/>almost entirely self-taught, was not aware of the<br/>history of Pythagorean and meantone tunings in European<br/>music (up to about 1500 for Pythagorean and 1850 for<br/>meantone).  and as he clearly states several times in<br/>_Harmonielehre_, aside from his more-or-less simplistic<br/>&quot;overtone model&quot;, he was also unaware of the mathematics<br/>of intonation.  he had &quot;perfect pitch&quot; and could hear<br/>overtones up to about the 11th harmonic, and he could<br/>hear that the 7th and 11th harmonics were tuned quite<br/>differently from their 12edo representations, but he<br/>was obviously unfamiliar with any actual use of tunings<br/>other than 12edo, or of a conception of tuning where<br/>the &quot;sharps&quot;

&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; [Gene:]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why is music, even here, so rife with arch-conservativism?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; In other fields you seem to be able to express a thought<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; without people jumping you, but here even the radicals<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; are conservatives.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [me, monz:]<br/>&gt; &gt; I think this might have something to do with a circumstance<br/>&gt; &gt; which Partch touched on in his book.  It&apos;s not as true today<br/>&gt; &gt; as it was during his lifetime, but to a large degree it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; still more true of music than of any other art-form.  Most<br/>&gt; &gt; musical compositions require an outside body of performers<br/>&gt; &gt; for their realization, with the resultant need for cooperation<br/>&gt; &gt; and standardization that artists working in other media don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; have to deal with.  Thus, the concommitant conservatism about<br/>&gt; &gt; changing the status-quo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this discussion began on the tuning-math list, right<br/>&gt; at the time when i was working out my study of the<br/>&gt; &quot;rational implications&quot; of Schoenberg&apos;s theory as<br/>&gt; presented in his 1911 book _Harmonielehre_.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; thus, i&apos;m surprised that at that time i didn&apos;t mention<br/>&gt; Schoenberg in connection with what i wrote here, because<br/>&gt; i had already come to the conclusion that it was primarily<br/>&gt; for reasons of his own career survival that he decided<br/>&gt; to abandon his quarter-tone experiments and stick<br/>&gt; with 12edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Schoenberg maintained at several points in his book<br/>&gt; that microtonality would surely become practical for<br/>&gt; use in the future ... but that at that time (1910)<br/>&gt; microtonality was not a practical choice for a composer<br/>&gt; who wished to have his music performed (mainly because<br/>&gt; of the lack of suitably tuned instruments).  thus, his<br/>&gt; decision to stay with 12edo but use it in a new way<br/>&gt; (which we now call &quot;free atonality&quot;, but which he<br/>&gt; called &quot;pantonality&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; what&apos;s really interesting to see are the changes which<br/>&gt; Schoenberg made to the revised 3rd edition of _Harmonielehre_<br/>&gt; which appeared in 1922, just after he made public his<br/>&gt; invention of the &quot;Method of Composing with Twelve Tones<br/>&gt; Which are Related Only with One Another&quot; (now called<br/>&gt; &quot;serialism&quot;).  he removed or softened many of his 1910<br/>&gt; pronouncements about microtonality, since he felt, as he<br/>&gt; announced in his new method in 1921: &quot;I have made a<br/>&gt; discovery that will ensure the superiority of German music<br/>&gt; for the next 100 years.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; unfortunately, the only complete English translation<br/>&gt; available for the _Harmonielehre_ is Roy Carter&apos;s 1978<br/>&gt; version, titled _Theory of Harmony_, and it&apos;s based<br/>&gt; on the 1922 edition.  Carter mentions the most important<br/>&gt; changes made by Schoenberg in footnotes, in two cases<br/>&gt; even including translations of several sentences which<br/>&gt; Schoenberg removed or modified.  but it would be nice<br/>&gt; to have a complete English text of the 1911 version.<br/>&gt; i&apos;ve been translating chunks of it myself when i find<br/>&gt; a big discrepancy between the two editions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the original 1911 version of _Harmonielehre_ was written<br/>&gt; right after Schoenberg had made his most radical experiments<br/>&gt; in the first group of &quot;atonal&quot; pieces (listed here in<br/>&gt; order of composition):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Quartet no. 2, F-sharp minor, op. 10 (1907/08)<br/>&gt;  15 poems from _Das Buch der h&iuml;&iquest;&half;ngenden G&iuml;&iquest;&half;rten_, op. 15 (1908/09)<br/>&gt;  3 pieces for piano, op. 11 (1909)<br/>&gt;  5 pieces for orchestra, op. 16 (1909)<br/>&gt;  Erwartung [Expectation], op. 17 (1909) (soprano, orchestra)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; he had not yet formulated a new &quot;method&quot; for the<br/>&gt; manipulation of the harmony in his music, and was<br/>&gt; at this point more interested in freeing music from<br/>&gt; the restrictions imposed by &quot;traditional tonality&quot;,<br/>&gt; so that his compositions could &quot;express pure feeling&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; none of Schoenberg&apos;s quarter-tone experiments have<br/>&gt; come to light -- those sketches were probably destroyed<br/>&gt; in World War 2 -- but based on the survival of some<br/>&gt; microtonal sketches of Webern songs, also on poems by<br/>&gt; Stefan George, i have concluded that Schoenberg played<br/>&gt; around with quarter-tones in the voice parts of some<br/>&gt; of the later songs from _Das Buch der h&iuml;&iquest;&half;ngenden G&iuml;&iquest;&half;rten_,<br/>&gt; in late 1908 and/or early 1909.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it was only a short-lived experiment, for by September<br/>&gt; 1909 he had written to Busoni that he had abandoned<br/>&gt; the idea of using microtones in his own compositions.<br/>&gt; Busoni had just sent Schoenberg a copy of his _Sketch for<br/>&gt; a  New Aesthetic of Music_, in which Busoni outlines<br/>&gt; 113 new scales that could be constructed in 12edo,<br/>&gt; then suggests using 1/3-tones, in the form of 36edo<br/>&gt; as two &quot;bike chains&quot; of 18edo a semitone apart.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Schoenberg, having just decided to give up microtonality,<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t put much stock in this last proposal, but Busoni&apos;s<br/>&gt; rhetoric does seem to have inspired Schoenberg to<br/>&gt; produce what i think is his most radical work of all,<br/>&gt; _Erwartung_, which he began composing immediately after<br/>&gt; this exchange with Busoni.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it&apos;s also important to note that, after struggling for<br/>&gt; years to find a publisher with whom he could hope to<br/>&gt; gain some financial security, immediately after composing<br/>&gt; _Erwartung_, Schoenberg signed a 10-year contract with<br/>&gt; Universal Edition, then the leading publisher -- and<br/>&gt; an aggressive promoter -- of &quot;new music&quot; in Vienna.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; when it came time for Schoenberg to write _Harmonielehre_<br/>&gt; in the summer of 1910 for his upcoming teaching job in<br/>&gt; September, he was clearly trying to formulate some<br/>&gt; suggestions on how to deal with the complex sonorities<br/>&gt; he had introduced in these pieces, especially _Erwartung_,<br/>&gt; and was just as clearly still interested in microtonality,<br/>&gt; at least intellectually.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but by the time the revised edition came out in 1922,<br/>&gt; he had hit on his new strategy for regulating the use<br/>&gt; of all 12 pitches of 12edo, and therefore no longer saw<br/>&gt; any need to promote the idea of microtones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but to relate all of this back to the original point ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the *reasons* which compelled Schoenberg to abandon<br/>&gt; microtones had to do with his survival as a composer.<br/>&gt; he emphasizes in _Harmonielehre_ that at that time<br/>&gt; (1910) there were too few instruments available which<br/>&gt; could produce those microtones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; of course, today we have talented performers who know<br/>&gt; how to produce quite specific microtonal pitches from<br/>&gt; regular orchestral instruments.  but in 1910 it&apos;s likely<br/>&gt; that instrumentalists had not yet figured out how to<br/>&gt; do that, and in fact that most wouldn&apos;t be the least<br/>&gt; bit interested in doing so.  at that time, the piano<br/>&gt; was clearly the &quot;king of instruments&quot; in the German<br/>&gt; musical world, and it was, almost universally, tuned<br/>&gt; in 12edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Schoenberg, having grown up in this musical mileu and<br/>&gt; almost entirely self-taught, was not aware of the<br/>&gt; history of Pythagorean and meantone tunings in European<br/>&gt; music (up to about 1500 for Pythagorean and 1850 for<br/>&gt; meantone).  and as he clearly states several times in<br/>&gt; _Harmonielehre_, aside from his more-or-less simplistic<br/>&gt; &quot;overtone model&quot;, he was also unaware of the mathematics<br/>&gt; of intonation.  he had &quot;perfect pitch&quot; and could hear<br/>&gt; overtones up to about the 11th harmonic, and he could<br/>&gt; hear that the 7th and 11th harmonics were tuned quite<br/>&gt; differently from their 12edo representations, but he<br/>&gt; was obviously unfamiliar with any actual use of tunings<br/>&gt; other than 12edo, or of a conception of tuning where<br/>&gt; the &quot;sharps&quot; and &quot;flats&quot; are different pitches, as in<br/>&gt; both Pythagorean and meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; many performers, audiences, and newspaper critics had<br/>&gt; already displayed a tremendously negative reaction to<br/>&gt; his &quot;atonal&quot; 12edo music in concerts of 1909 and 1910.<br/>&gt; but even outside of his immediate circle of students<br/>&gt; and supporters, Schoenberg did have a small group of<br/>&gt; admirers, and his new contract with Universal Edition<br/>&gt; gave him at least some small measure of confidence about<br/>&gt; the future of his work, and the possibility of earning<br/>&gt; income from it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it makes complete sense to me that at this juncture<br/>&gt; (1910), he would not have been willing to jeopardize<br/>&gt; the prospect of earning royalties from his compositions<br/>&gt; by using &quot;non-standard&quot; tunings.  it seems to me that<br/>&gt; this desire for standarization is what lies at the root<br/>&gt; of Schoenberg&apos;s rejection of microtonality and<br/>&gt; enshrinement of 12edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; if Schoenberg had been in a position to create his<br/>&gt; music entirely by himself, as Partch had the courage<br/>&gt; and skills to do for many years, and as we can do easily<br/>&gt; today, i think it&apos;s very likely that he *would* have made<br/>&gt; further explorations into the use of microtonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i find it one of the great ironies of music history<br/>&gt; that just at the time that microtonalists such as<br/>&gt; Mager, Mollendorf, and Haba began giving demonstrations<br/>&gt; and concerts involving quarter-tones in Vienna<br/>&gt; (around 1912-1918), Schoenberg moved to Berlin and<br/>&gt; thus missed the opportunity to actually experience<br/>&gt; quarter-tone music.  he had already been in contact<br/>&gt;
