would<br/>show further examples (beyond the decatonic one) of how the diatonic<br/>concept can be generalized, leading to other systems with &quot;naturals&quot;<br/>and &quot;accidentals&quot; such as negri&apos;s (which he used for 19-equal),<br/>herman miller&apos;s &quot;porcupine&quot;

All questions on this stuff are always<br/>promptly and happily answered.  And then maybe you could<br/>write a really excellent intro, since we&apos;re all blinded<br/>by being too close to this stuff!</p><p>As for revising tFoT, I have no doubt it could be done.<br/>But in my experience you can&apos;t make gold out of alluminum<br/>with revisions, especially with a short document like this.<br/>That&apos;s because it&apos;s very hard to fix anything without<br/>breaking something else.  It&apos;s why truly good engineering<br/>is so difficult.*  Even if the document could be improved<br/>substantially, it almost always takes more time than<br/>starting afresh.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>* For an example of absolutely fantastic engineering, look<br/>no farther than the common, cheap version of the carrot<br/>peeler.  Self-sharpening, ultra-reliable, very effective<br/>and easy to use, made from about $0.002 of material.  You<br/>also can&apos;t improve it easily.  Change anything, and you<br/>break it.  For example, compare the $0.75 retail peelers<br/>to any other peeler, with rubberized grips, etc, costing<br/>$5.00 or more.  The ones with extra features are vastly<br/>inferior!</p><p>By the way, if you view engineering as compression in the<br/>computer-science sense, you can sketch a line of reasoning<br/>about this...  There are fewer shorter strings than longer<br/>ones.  Therefore, if you expect to be able to explain the<br/>same variety of things (in the case of Science, everything)<br/>with theories of about the same size, you can expect that<br/>shorter theories will break more easily -- a single bit<br/>shift, for example, will be more damaging.  It&apos;s one way of<br/>explaining how Einstein, for example, could be so sure<br/>General Relativity had to be correct -- any change breaks it.</p><p>Well, this is metatuning.  :)</p></div><h3><a id=5724 href="#5724">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2003 7:13:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;PERLICH@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/metatuning/topicId_5640.html#5708">/metatuning/topicId_5640.html#5708</a></p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;PERLICH@A...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve always known you as a person that needs a reason for<br/>&gt; &gt;everything,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; that&apos;s why i&apos;m such a lousy composer. it gives me too much time to<br/>&gt; second-guess my intuition, indeed forget it entirely as my<br/>creativity<br/>&gt; falls under an avalanche of competing technical considerations.<br/>&gt; composing with others is a great help because i can use, as a valid<br/>&gt; reason, &quot;their intuition said so&quot;! improvising is the best musical<br/>&gt; scenario for me, because by the time i can question my intuition,<br/>the<br/>&gt; notes have already been played, their meaning absorbed by the<br/>&gt; audience, and it&apos;s too late to go back and change anything!</p><p>***Basically, you&apos;re too smart to be a composer... :)</p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=5725 href="#5725">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2003 7:16:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;PERLICH@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/metatuning/topicId_5640.html#5712">/metatuning/topicId_5640.html#5712</a></p><p>&gt; when i was young, i knew some polish and some english, but my<br/>&gt; thinking was far more advanced than my abilities with either<br/>&gt; language. i just visualize everything in my head, like a silent<br/>&gt; movie. that&apos;s why physics was such an extremely easy subject for me<br/>&gt; in school. ironically, spanish was my other best subject . . .<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Isn&apos;t that what is traditionally termed a &quot;photographic memory??&quot;<br/>That&apos;s why you&apos;re so useful... and I&apos;ve never had to really pay you<br/>much either... :)  (well, a few free dinners here and there... ) :)</p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=5726 href="#5726">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2003 7:19:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, kraig grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;</p><p><a href="/metatuning/topicId_5640.html#5713">/metatuning/topicId_5640.html#5713</a></p><p>wrote:<br/>&gt; They say the best 20th century poets were the spainish speaking<br/>ones.<br/>&gt;  I have never been confortable with words, and likewise can see way<br/>beyond my translation into their use<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Well, George Crumb and Lorca are a pretty good pair.
