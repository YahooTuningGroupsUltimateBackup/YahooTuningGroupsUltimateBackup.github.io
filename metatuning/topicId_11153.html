I&apos;ll post some below. Not too<br/> much or no one will read it all. People can comment or not. I<br/> just had some time.</p><p> I&apos;m not sure if the entire book is here. (?)</p><p> The link below goes to Chapter 17 which is the best chapter.<br/> Chapters 3 and 5 are also interesting. Chapter 5<br/> has musical references.</p><p><a href="http://www.readprint.com/chapter-5929/Aldous-Huxley">http://www.readprint.com/chapter-5929/Aldous-Huxley</a></p><p> The excerpt below has obvious relevance to my recent posts.</p><p>===================================================================</p><p>&quot;But God&apos;s the reason for everything noble and fine and heroic. If<br/>you had a God...&quot;</p><p>&quot;My dear young friend,&quot; said Mustapha Mond, &quot;civilization has<br/>absolutely no need of nobility or heroism. These things are symptoms<br/>of political inefficiency. In a properly organized society like<br/>ours, nobody has any opportunities for being noble or heroic.<br/>Conditions have got to be thoroughly unstable before the occasion<br/>can arise. Where there are wars, where there are divided<br/>allegiances, where there are temptations to be resisted, objects of<br/>love to be fought for or defendedÂ–there, obviously, nobility and<br/>heroism have some sense. But there aren&apos;t any wars nowadays. The<br/>greatest care is taken to prevent you from loving any one too much...</p><p>===================================================================</p><p>&quot;But all the same,&quot; insisted the Savage, &quot;it is natural to believe<br/>in God when you&apos;re aloneÂ–quite alone, in the night, thinking about<br/>death...&quot;</p><p>&quot;But people never are alone now,&quot; said Mustapha Mond. &quot;We make them<br/>hate solitude; and we arrange their lives so that it&apos;s almost<br/>impossible for them ever to have it.&quot;</p><p>===================================================================</p><p> MORE IS BELOW IF THE READER HAS INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p> There is no way to know what Aldous Huxley was thinking when<br/> he choose the name Mustapha Mond for this powerful man.<br/> If he was thinking<br/> along the lines of Islam or not. Too late to know now. I did<br/> come up with some info below if anyone is into onomastics.</p><p> Apparently Mustapha Mond means literally: &quot;the chosen one<br/> of the world&quot;. Condsidering what he says in the book, Mustapha<br/> Mond is obviously a anti-Christ.</p><p> Another excerpt from same chapter is below:</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The Controller, meanwhile, had crossed to the other side of the room<br/>and was unlocking a large safe set into the wall between the<br/>bookshelves. The heavy door swung open. Rummaging in the darkness<br/>within, &quot;It&apos;s a subject,&quot; he said, &quot;that has always had a great<br/>interest for me.&quot; He pulled out a thick black volume. &quot;You&apos;ve never<br/>read this, for example.&quot;</p><p>The Savage took it. &quot;The Holy Bible, containing the Old and New<br/>Testaments,&quot; he read aloud from the title-page.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> First a brief view of the character, Mustapha Mond.</p><p><a href="http://www.huxley.net/whoswho.htm">http://www.huxley.net/whoswho.htm</a></p><p>MUSTAPHA MOND</p><p>Resident World Controller of Western Europe. He presides over one of<br/>the ten zones of the World State, the global government set up after<br/>the cataclysmic Nine Years&apos; War and great Economic Collapse.</p><p>The Controller argues that art, literature and scientific freedom<br/>must be sacrificed in order to secure the ultimate utilitarian goal<br/>of maximising societal happiness. He defends the genetic caste<br/>system, behavioural conditioning and the lack of personal freedom in<br/>the World State as a price worth paying for achieving social<br/>stability. Stability is the highest social virtue because it leads<br/>to lasting happiness.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> Mustapha - Variant of Arabic Mustafa, meaning &quot;the chosen one.&quot;</p><p> <a href="http://www.20000-names.com/male_m_names_4.htm">http://www.20000-names.com/male_m_names_4.htm</a><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> Mond - world</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustapha_Mond">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustapha_Mond</a><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_veneration_for_Muhammad">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_veneration_for_Muhammad</a></p><p>Muhammad is often referenced with titles of praise:</p><p>Al Mustafa, &quot;the chosen one&quot;</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>****************************************************************<br/>****************************************************************</p><p><a href="http://www.behindthename.com/php/search.php">http://www.behindthename.com/php/search.php</a>?<br/>terms=Mustapha&amp;nmd=n&amp;gender=both&amp;operator=or</p><p>MUSTAPHA<br/>Gender: Masculine</p><p>Usage: Arabic</p><p>Other Scripts: &atilde;&Otilde;&Oslash;&Yacute;&igrave; (Arabic)</p><p>Variant transcription of MUSTAFA<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><a href="http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=mustafa">http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=mustafa</a></p><p>MUSTAFA<br/>Gender: Masculine</p><p>Usage: Arabic</p><p>Other Scripts: &atilde;&Otilde;&Oslash;&Yacute;&igrave; (Arabic)</p><p>Means &quot;the chosen one&quot; in Arabic, an epithet of Muhammad.
