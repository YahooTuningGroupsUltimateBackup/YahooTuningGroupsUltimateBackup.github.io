The question is not an insignificant one.</p><p>In 2003, Secretary of State Powell exploited his sterling image to<br/>help mislead the nation into the Iraq War. [For details on Powell, see<br/>our book Neck Deep.] Now, McCain hopes his &quot;straight-talk-express&quot;<br/>appeal will help keep US troops in Iraq indefinitely.</p><p>So, there&apos;s urgency for Americans to know whether John McCain is a<br/>sanctimonious phony and a self-assured liar, who&apos;s just masquerading<br/>as the guy who tells it like it is and disdains the self-serving ways<br/>of Washington.</p><p>*Evidence of Lies*</p><p>Though no new evidence has surfaced about McCain and Iseman as a<br/>romantic item, McCain&apos;s blanket denial about assisting Iseman and<br/>other lobbyists is fast disintegrating.</p><p>As we noted in an article on Feb. 21, McCain&apos;s assertion in response<br/>to the Times article -- that during his quarter-century congressional<br/>career, he &quot;has never violated the public trust, never done favors for<br/>special interests or lobbyists&quot; -- just isn&apos;t true.</p><p>For instance, the Times story recalled how McCain helped one of his<br/>early financial backers, wheeler-dealer Charles Keating, frustrate<br/>oversight from federal banking regulators who were examining Keating&apos;s<br/>Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.</p><p>At Keating&apos;s urging, McCain wrote letters, introduced bills and pushed<br/>a Keating associate for a job on a banking regulatory board. In 1987,<br/>McCain joined several other senators in two private meetings with<br/>federal banking regulators on Keating&apos;s behalf.</p><p>Two years later, Lincoln collapsed, costing the US taxpayers $3.4<br/>billion. Keating eventually went to prison and three other senators<br/>from the so-called Keating Five saw their political careers ruined.</p><p>McCain drew a Senate reprimand for his involvement and later lamented<br/>his faulty judgment. &quot;Why didn&apos;t I fully grasp the unusual appearance<br/>of such a meeting?&quot; he wrote in his 2002 memoir, Worth the Fighting For.</p><p>But some people close to the case thought McCain got off too easy.</p><p>Not only was McCain taking donations from Keating and his business<br/>circle, getting free rides on Keating&apos;s corporate jet and enjoying<br/>joint vacations in the Bahamas  McCain&apos;s second wife, the beer<br/>fortune heiress Cindy Hensley, had invested with Keating in an Arizona<br/>shopping mall.</p><p>In the years that followed, however, McCain not only got out from<br/>under the shadow of the Keating Five scandal but found a silver lining<br/>in the cloud, transforming the case into a lessons-learned chapter of<br/>his personal narrative.</p><p>McCain, as born-again reformer, soon was winning over the Washington<br/>press corps with his sponsorship of ethics legislation, like the<br/>McCain-Feingold bill limiting &quot;soft money&quot; contributions to the<br/>political parties.</p><p>However, there was still the other side of John McCain as he wielded<br/>enormous power from his position as chairman of the Senate Commerce<br/>Committee, which helped him solicit campaign donations from<br/>corporations doing business before the panel.</p><p>*Pressure on the FCC*</p><p>The Times story suggested that McCain did favors on behalf of Iseman&apos;s<br/>lobbying clients, including two letters that McCain wrote in 1999 to<br/>the Federal Communications Commission demanding that it act on a<br/>long-delayed request by Iseman&apos;s client, Florida-based Paxson<br/>Communications, to buy a Pittsburgh television station.</p><p>In the furious counter-offensive against the Times article, McCain&apos;s<br/>campaign issued a point-by-point denial, calling those letters routine<br/>correspondence that were handled by staff without McCain meeting<br/>either with Paxson or anyone from Iseman&apos;s firm, Alcalde &amp; Fay.</p><p>&quot;No representative of Paxson or Alcalde &amp; Fay personally asked Senator<br/>McCain to send a letter to the FCC,&quot; his campaign said.</p><p>But that turned out not to be true. Newsweek&apos;s investigative reporter<br/>Michael Isikoff dug up a sworn deposition from Sept. 25, 2002, in<br/>which McCain himself declared that &quot;I was contacted by Mr. Paxson on<br/>this issue.  He wanted their [the FCC&apos;s] approval very bad for<br/>purposes of his business. I believe that Mr. Paxson had a legitimate<br/>complaint.&quot;</p><p>Though McCain claimed not to recall whether he had spoken with<br/>Paxson&apos;s lobbyist [presumably a reference to Iseman], he added, &quot;I&apos;m<br/>sure I spoke to [Paxson],&quot; according to the deposition. [See<br/>Newsweek&apos;s Web posting, Feb. 22, 2008]</p><p>McCain&apos;s letters to the FCC, which Chairman William Kennard criticized<br/>as &quot;highly unusual,&quot; came in the same period when Paxson&apos;s company was<br/>ferrying McCain to political events aboard its corporate jet and<br/>donating $20,000 to his campaign.</p><p>After the Feb. 21 Times article appeared, McCain&apos;s spokesmen confirmed<br/>that Iseman accompanied McCain on at least one of those flights from<br/>Florida to Washington, though McCain said in the 2002 deposition that<br/>&quot;I do not recall&quot; if Paxson&apos;s lobbyist was onboard.</p><p>First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams, who conducted the deposition in<br/>connection with a challenge to the McCain-Feingold law, asked McCain<br/>if the benefits that he received from Paxson created &quot;at least an<br/>appearance of corruption here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Absolutely,&quot; McCain answered. &quot;I believe that there could possibly be<br/>an appearance of corruption because this system has tainted all of us.&quot;</p><p>*Sticking to the Story*</p><p>When Newsweek went to McCain&apos;s 2008 campaign with the seeming<br/>contradictions between the deposition and the denial of the Times<br/>article, McCain&apos;s people stuck to their story that that the senator<br/>had never discussed the FCC issue with Paxson or his lobbyist.</p><p>&quot;We do not think there is a contradiction here,&quot; campaign spokeswoman<br/>Ann Begeman told Newsweek. &quot;It appears that Senator McCain, when<br/>speaking of being contacted by Paxson, was speaking in shorthand of<br/>his staff being contacted by representatives of Paxson. Senator McCain<br/>does not recall being asked directly by Paxson or any representative<br/>of him or by Alcalde &amp; Fay to contact the FCC regarding the Pittsburgh<br/>license transaction.&quot;</p><p>That new denial, however, soon crumbled when the Washington Post<br/>interviewed Paxson, who said he had talked with McCain in his<br/>Washington office several weeks before McCain sent the letters to the FCC.</p><p>The broadcast executive also believed that Iseman had helped arrange<br/>the meeting and likely was in attendance. &quot;Was Vicki there? Probably,&quot;<br/>Paxson said. [Washington Post, Feb. 23, 2008]</p><p>A day earlier, the Post also noted the discrepancy between a central<br/>tenet of McCain&apos;s campaign  his denunciation of lobbyists and the<br/>corrupt revolving-door ways of Washington  and his reliance on<br/>lobbyists for his congressional work and his campaign.</p><p>&quot;When McCain huddled with his closest advisers at his rustic Arizona<br/>cabin last weekend to map out his presidential campaign, virtually<br/>every one was part of the Washington lobbying culture he has long<br/>decried,&quot; the Post reported on Feb. 22.</p><p>In its article about McCain and Iseman, the New York Times also noted<br/>that in 2001, McCain helped found a non-profit organization called the<br/>Reform Institute supposedly to advance McCain&apos;s signature cause of<br/>political ethics.</p><p>But the institute drew much of its funding from companies trying to<br/>ingratiate themselves with McCain and his Commerce Committee. Though<br/>denying any impropriety, McCain severed his ties to the Reform<br/>Institute in 2005 because of the &quot;bad publicity.&quot;</p><p>So, one of the pressing questions for American voters as they look<br/>toward the formal nomination of McCain as the Republican presidential<br/>candidate is whether he is a phony who&apos;s long been protected by his<br/>gilded reputation or whether he suffers from severe  or at least<br/>convenient  memory loss.</p><p>McCain also may have learned some tricks from watching his former<br/>rival, George W. Bush, whose tendency to lie grew increasingly brazen<br/>after 9/11.</p><p>As Commander in Chief for a nation at war, Bush brushed aside<br/>questions about his statements not squaring with the facts: From his<br/>insistence that waterboarding is not torture to Saddam Hussein not<br/>letting the UN inspectors in. [See, for instance, <a href="http://Consortiumnews.com">Consortiumnews.com</a>&apos;s<br/>&quot;Bush&apos;s Favorite Lie.&quot;]</p><p>Since McCain as Commander in Chief would ensure that the United States<br/>remains at war for the foreseeable future, he might expect a Bush-like<br/>pass when his words diverge almost 180 degrees from the facts. Endless<br/>war will justify endless lies.</p><p>Or maybe he just believes his own press clippings  that he is such a<br/>straight-talker that whatever comes out of his mouth must be the truth.</p><p>Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories in the 1980s for<br/>the Associated Press and Newsweek.
