But the whole<br/>situation is indicative to much how we view our artist. Artists exist in two<br/>and only two categories. either geniuses or not really worth talking about,<br/>much. When we as a society place artist in the first category, soon<br/>afterwards there are those &quot;attacks&quot; on  clay feet, as if to prove what an<br/>AH someone is or how evil he/she was, pedophile, gambler  etc. etc.<br/>I remember when Feldman was more in the second category and how as soon as<br/>he died he can do no wrong. I guess this always happen to a certain degree.</p><p>Sometimes the persons personality can get in the way. I am sure we all know<br/>very talented people who drove any success away from themselves. I am sure<br/>none of us really would have like Van Gogh as a person and wouldn&apos;t have<br/>lasted an evening in his presence.</p><p>    I think it would be much healthier if work was excepted for what it is.<br/>I have heard as many great unknowns as i have knowns and so much work that<br/>is out there is not done by those who we elevate to Goddess)head (only in<br/>order to tear them down), whose work is not so supernatural as<br/>supra-natural-as an activity . And this supra-natural activity should be<br/>recognized for what it is worth.</p><p>    I would much rather just be able to enjoy Feldman for what he does that<br/>have to decide if he is really a music god or not. Do i have to worship<br/>every note of dismiss it all as falling short of Debussy? This seems to be<br/>the position we are forced into.</p><p>Still at some point it does become necessary to recognize those who do what<br/>others cannot as there are those who do exceed beyond the rest. To place<br/>them in the context of all those who come close, hit or miss, etc. would<br/>really give them the recognition they deserve and maybe take it away from<br/>those others who don&apos;t really cut the cake.</p><p>More would be gained by having a society where we could take in more art on<br/>a more daily basis instead of those excursions to the museums. Instead of<br/>mass produced paintings on restaurant walls, works by local artist (this is<br/>quite common in Europe) and for us, instead of Muzak in public spaces, work<br/>by composers/sound artist creating environmental sound.<br/> One such thing i can imagine is common practice chord progression done in<br/>JI, and in reverse and modulating so that they constantly raise in pitch<br/>over periods of time until you get back to someplace where you can loop it.<br/>Of course it would be interesting to observe whether such rising was<br/>pleasing or not or if it made the environmental sounds around it appear to<br/>descend because of some weird figure/ground relationship. Maybe it is better<br/>to descend subliminally and cause the environment to raise or give the<br/>effect that after a piece, the sound has &quot;ascended&quot; in pitch. We could call<br/>this -For Paul Erlich.<br/>    We have segregated art away from us.</p><p>Christopher Bailey wrote:</p><p>&gt; This is pretty harsh:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Encounters with Morton Feldman<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; by Elliott Sharp<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
