However, secretary of state<br/>spokesman Douglas Stone later told Wired News that the county in<br/>question is Alameda.</p><p>   Alameda County, a Democratic stronghold that includes the cities of<br/>Berkeley and Oakland, converted to all-electronic voting last year at<br/>a cost of more than $12 million. The county used the machines in state<br/>elections last year and in last month&apos;s gubernatorial recall election.<br/>The machines will also be used in tomorrow&apos;s municipal election in<br/>Alameda.</p><p>   The only other California county currently using the Diebold<br/>touch-screen machines on election days is Plumas. Los Angeles County<br/>uses a limited number of the machines for early voting. No one was<br/>available for comment on whether uncertified software may have been<br/>installed on machines used in Plumas or Los Angeles.</p><p>   The Diebold machines slated for state certification, known as the<br/>AccuVote TSx, are a modified version of the machines used in Alameda<br/>and Plumas. The new machine is said to be a lighter, more compact<br/>version.</p><p>   At the meeting, Carrel delayed indefinitely the certification of<br/>the new machines until the secretary of state&apos;s office can investigate<br/>the matter. Diebold officials, who were attending the meeting, seemed<br/>surprised by the announcement and expressed displeasure to several<br/>panelists afterward that it had been introduced in a public forum.<br/>They were unavailable for comment.</p><p>   Also present at the meeting were representatives from Solano, San<br/>Diego, and San Joaquin counties, where officials are waiting for state<br/>certification to begin using the new machines. Officials from Alameda<br/>County&apos;s registrar of voters were unavailable for comment.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
