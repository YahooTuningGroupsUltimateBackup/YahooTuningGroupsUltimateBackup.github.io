The crisis in<br/>energy, and in inequality of living conditions, would be there in any<br/>event.</p><p>Secondly, I consider it vital to recognize that acts of terrorism or<br/>&quot;collateral damage&quot; against civilians are reprehensible, as much so at<br/>the World Trade Center as anywhere else in the world.</p><p>There seem to me three imperatives of the 21st century that these<br/>attacks underscore, indeed three imperatives pointing to a nonviolent<br/>revolution of expectations and reality.</p><p>                               I</p><p>The first imperative is one of basic human rights, the elementary<br/>standards defined and defended by such organizations as Amnesty<br/>International and the European Union.</p><p>From this perspective, for example, a major problem in the troubled<br/>land of Palestine/Israel is the frequent violation of elementary human<br/>rights by the authorities of both recognized &quot;sides,&quot; a problem shared<br/>in common between the Jewish and Palestinian communities despite their<br/>many well-publicized differences:</p><p>             * Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority have been<br/>               implicated by respected international human rights<br/>               organizations in the use of torture, whether excused<br/>               as &quot;moderate physical pressure&quot; or otherwise;</p><p>             * The Palestinian Authority has carried out judicial<br/>               executions; while Israel, although it has laudibly<br/>               abolished the death penalty in practice since 1962,<br/>               has made extrajudicial killings an act of policy.</p><p>While borders and political arrangements may evolve in various ways as<br/>negotiations proceed -- with internationalization of Jerusalem, and<br/>possibly a larger portion of Palestine/Israel, an alternative to be<br/>considered -- the guaranteeing of basic human rights within those<br/>borders should be a top priority of policy for nations committed to<br/>democracy, including the USA.</p><p>                                II</p><p>The second imperative is a revolution _in_ the means of defense and<br/>revolution: a shift toward &quot;People Power&quot; and active nonviolence as<br/>weapons for communal empowerment and the restructuring or replacement<br/>of governments which violate the principles of democracy and human<br/>rights, whether the oppression is aimed against minoriity groups or<br/>the overall population.</p><p>Here a hero of the Pashtun people who have endured so much suffering<br/>within the borders of the former British Empire, and more recently of<br/>Pakistan and Afghanistan, may play a special role in this revolution<br/>needed throughout the world, including the Islamic world.</p><p>Khan Abdul Gaffir Khan, known and honored as Badshah Khan or &quot;King<br/>Khan&quot; among his people, came from a nation with a fierce warrior<br/>tradition and led that nation in a new development of that tradition:<br/>a war against the British occupation fought with the weapons of<br/>militant nonviolence.</p><p>Looking both to the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, and to his Islamic<br/>tradition, Khan and his followers founded the Khudai Khidmatgar, or<br/>&quot;Servants of God,&quot; identified as the &quot;Red Shirts&quot; because of their<br/>distinctive dress. They were a disciplined army of nonviolent<br/>soldiers, pledged to reject not only the outward enemy of British<br/>oppression but the inward violence of traditional codes of revenge.</p><p>They took part in the great Salt Campaign against British Rule in<br/>1930-1931, where in Peshawar they faced machine guns of the Imperial<br/>forces without either fleeing or retaliating violently.</p><p>The best defense against terrorism is what Badshad Khan established:<br/>an engaged nonviolent army drawing the youth into social service and<br/>active struggle against injustice.</p><p>Badshah Khan, who ironically later spent time as a political prisoner<br/>in Pakistan after the defeat of the British, has been aptly called a<br/>&quot;nonviolent soldier of Islam.&quot; His life may help to give the best<br/>definition to an oft-cited concept of Islam: _jihad_.</p><p>Here it should be understood that _jihad_ might be translated by the<br/>English word &quot;struggle,&quot; and refers to a person&apos;s inner ethical and<br/>spiritual struggle as well as to social or political struggles for<br/>justice.</p><p>While the term _jihad_ has sometimes described armed struggles viewed<br/>as just, the life of Badshah Khan shows how both the personal or<br/>spiritual struggle and the outward or political struggle may be waged<br/>by means of active nonviolence.</p><p>All too often, tragically, this active nonviolence or &quot;People Power&quot;<br/>has been asserted by oppressed peoples where the convenience of the<br/>USA and other &quot;developed countries&quot; may not necessarily coincide with<br/>the interests of justice.</p><p>For example, the struggle of the indigenous Ogoni people of Nigeria<br/>has been waged with the support of global human rights organizations<br/>not only against human rights abuses by the Nigerian government, but<br/>to protect the Ogoni lands and culture against violations by<br/>international corporations such as Shell exploiting Ogoni resources.</p><p>An Ogoni leader of this nonviolent struggle, Ken Sawo-Wiwa, was put on<br/>trial on a charge of murder not taken seriously by independent<br/>observers, including Amnesty International, and hanged along with<br/>other leaders of the campaign in 1995.</p><p>While each people must wage its own struggle, the USA can and should<br/>act so as to facilitate rather than to impede such movements for<br/>justice, even if corporate interests are sometimes inconvenienced.</p><p>Prisoners of conscience and activists for their people such as Leyla<br/>Zana of Northern Kurdistan, winner of the Sakharov Prize of the<br/>European Parliament for 1995, deserve the support of democratic<br/>governments and international organizations.</p><p>Also, the USA can and should declare that in a world where conflict is<br/>itself an inevitable human experience, the resolution of such<br/>conflicts by nonviolent means is an imperative interest for friends of<br/>peace, justice, and human rights.</p><p>Thus the USA should establish a Department of Peace seeking to promote<br/>research, development, and education in the methods and technologies<br/>of active nonviolence as dedicated as was the pursuit of nuclear<br/>weapons technologies in the 20th century.</p><p>                             III</p><p>The third imperative is the development as an emergency priority of<br/>renewable sources of energy, and the addressing of economic inequities<br/>that pose a reality of suffering now for billions of people, with the<br/>threat of instability and terrorism in many forms for a global<br/>community rife with such injustices.</p><p>Here active nonviolence and &quot;People Power&quot; must be part of a movement<br/>for economic democracy as well as political democracy, the struggle<br/>for &quot;Freedom From Want,&quot; to borrow the words of President Franklin<br/>Delano Roosevelt of the USA.</p><p>The institution of foreign and economic policies encouraging<br/>community-based development with a central role for women is one<br/>weapon of peace in the struggle against want and terrorism.</p><p>The reform of international economic associations whose current<br/>practices weaken environmental standards or the ability of labor to<br/>organize within or across national borders is another priority in the<br/>struggle for community self-determination and power, and against<br/>terrorism.</p><p>On 4 April 1967, just one year before his assassination, Martin Luther<br/>King, Jr., voiced many of these concerns in a famous address given in<br/>the city of New York, a city which now courageously continues its<br/>struggle for survival and community after the attacks of September 11<br/>and now another airplane tragedy which may have been an accident.</p><p>In the year 2001, a date sometimes connected with science fiction<br/>scenarios, we face the challenges already outlined in 1967 by Dr. King<br/>in his speech, the challenges of peace, nonviolent struggle, and<br/>economic renewal through global democracy.</p><p>An old political adage has it that what touches all, must be consented<br/>to by all. Today the communal security of the Ogoni people may be<br/>essential to the security of the people of New York, both seeking<br/>fulfillment in a world of shared dignity and diverse cultures.</p><p>Although world peace has often been sought through a consolidation of<br/>power, whether in Dante Alighieri&apos;s _monarchia_ or universal<br/>government, or in some New World Order, the key to peace may today<br/>take shape in a more culturally and politically decentralized world,<br/>with basic human rights standards and techniques of active nonviolence<br/>as unifying themes.</p><p>For example, the precise political form which a Kurdistan might take<br/>in the 21st century is an open question: but one can predict that any<br/>kind of regional organization that does not have room for recognizing<br/>the cultural and political reality of Kurdistan does not have room for<br/>true democracy and human rights for others living in the region.</p><p>It would be naive to suppose that terrorist acts are always committed<br/>by those devoted to the cause of social justice, or that they always<br/>and necessarily represent the last desperate resort of &quot;the poorest of<br/>the poor.&quot; All too often the actors are major world powers defending<br/>oppressive interests and privileges, or sometimes lesser powers with<br/>equally oppressive agendas. Let us not romanticize history.</p><p>However, it is equally evident that terrorism is often a kind of<br/>opportunistic infection which strikes and spreads when a society&apos;s<br/>normal immune system of free social institutions and human rights<br/>values have been disrupted, or forestalled, by war or economic<br/>exploitation. In places from Cambodia to Afghanistan, the calculated<br/>military violence of superpowers has been followed by mass genocide or<br/>democide -- the &quot;killing of the people&quot; by murderous forces filling<br/>the vacuum.</p><p>In the 21st century, the highest and most noble form of leadership for<br/>a &quot;developed&quot; nation such as the USA may be to follow the path of<br/>Badshah Khan, Ken Sawo-Wiwa, and Leyla Zana.</p><p>Against the threat of terrorism, a moment of quiet reflection and<br/>self-examination may be a most powerful weapon of the spirit. Let us<br/>listen and hear the &quot;voice of the voiceless,&quot; which may reverberate<br/>through the world in a global revolution of nonviolence.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>dante.interport@...</h3><span>11/13/2001 11:34:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This is a trick question because the very existence of things like<br/>&quot;presidents&quot; &quot;kings&quot; &quot;dick-tators&quot; &quot;high poo-bahs&quot; etc. is precisly the<br/>problem that needs to be corrected.

That is still up to<br/>us all.</p><p>These are difficult words in a difficult time, which I humbly address<br/>in welcome to someone who has made an uncommon commitment to minimize<br/>complicity with violence out of hatred or violence out of simple<br/>political inertia.</p><p>Loving the people on all sides, and rejecting the hatred of people on<br/>all sides, is an ideal which I seek, however imperfectly.</p><p>Given the importance of Indigenous movements in the land recently<br/>known as Australia, as well as on other continents, I might comment<br/>that my goal as a newcomer to the land of the Nisenan Nation, one of<br/>the many peoples of the continent on which I live, is to become an<br/>immigrant rather than an agent of conquest and occupation.</p><p>Recognizing the Indigenous roots of the land on which one lives,<br/>learning the language if possible, and considering how the people of<br/>the First Nations (to use a term current in Canada) are treated are<br/>steps toward friendship and mutual respect between Natives and<br/>newcomers.</p><p>For example, in Massachusetts, the Woapanaak Nation is acting to<br/>reclaim its language, often known as Wampanoag -- interestingly, one<br/>learned by Roger Williams in the 17th century, an English newcomer of<br/>that time and an advocate of religious liberty.</p><p>Nine years ago, in 1992, I had the opportunity to participate in a<br/>commemmoration of the Quincentennial of the invasion of 1492, in which<br/>an Aborginal Australian (as I recall he described himself) took part;<br/>next year, another representative of one of the peoples of Indigenous<br/>Australia gave a very interesting presentation on the local University<br/>campus, focusing on the themes of community and shared responsibility.</p><p>Dave, thank you for sharing your views here, and I hope that as your<br/>time permits we may have some ongoing dialogues.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
