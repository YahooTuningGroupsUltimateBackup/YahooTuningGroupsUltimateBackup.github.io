From<br/>The Art of Improvisation in Persian Music</p><p>At the moment of creation, the musician faithful to the art of improvisation chooses a certain path by selecting various intervals in harmony with his mood. Until the sounding of the first note on stage, this path is a secret to the conscious mind of the improviser and what is desired during the concert is only known to the unconscious. In Eastern mysticism, the unconscious is also called &quot;the clear heart&quot;. The more meaningful, clear, and active the subconscious is, the more attractive and beautiful the spiritual mood of the creation becomes. During the performance, one can choose from many different paths which have been learned by the conscious mind. Through years of practice and repetition, the musician is usually comfortable with such paths, however, all the selections are made without any awareness, and this fact makes every performance different. When, during the performance, one becomes too restricted according to paths learned from the old masters, one has to create a new way while keeping in mind the various rules of improvisation. Love and loyalty to the ideal of improvisation and secrets of creation are one&apos;s principle and one&apos;s guidance. At the time of creation, one is nothing but an instrument and one maintains respect for this creation by being modest toward it, hence, this art in the East is called &quot;inspirational&quot;. All one has to do is let one&apos;s feelings flow freely in the currents of truth, the searching rays of God. Love of God, which is one&apos;s absolute love, has been and will be the most complete path to creation.<br/>- Mohammad Reza Lotfi</p><p>Blessings,<br/>Danielle<br/>   Danielle Woerner<br/>Soprano, Teacher of Singing<br/>  <a href="http://www.HVmusic.com/artists/danielle">http://www.HVmusic.com/artists/danielle</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.hvmusic.com/artists/danielle">http://www.hvmusic.com/artists/danielle</a>&gt;<br/>  <a href="http://www.HVmusic.com/services/woodlark">http://www.HVmusic.com/services/woodlark</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.hvmusic.com/services/woodlark">http://www.hvmusic.com/services/woodlark</a>&gt;<br/>Faculty-Adjunct, Bard College &amp; Dutchess Community Coll.</p><p>&quot;She is a singer, and therefore capable of anything.&quot; - Bellini</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.323 / Virus Database: 267.8.8/36 - Release Date: 7/1/2005</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=9045 href="#9045">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2005 3:40:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; this was too good not to share and pass along.</p><p>And too good to go unremarked upon - thank you for posting that.
