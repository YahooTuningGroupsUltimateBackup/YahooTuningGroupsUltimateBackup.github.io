However: what about all the people writing for either<br/>just one or two performers, or just writing for their own<br/>electronics - why are so many of *them* conservative??? I&apos;ve said it<br/>before a lot, and it&apos;s just my $0.02, but most of the micro music I<br/>hear is dated when it hits the speakers/earphones - why isn&apos;t the<br/>edge being cut with a microtonal razor?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=1509 href="#1509">ðŸ”—</a>clumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2002 4:24:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Damn, Carl!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Everything in your post was wonderful, and then...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;clumma&quot; &lt;carl@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Unlike the self-appointed Partch experts around here, I take<br/>&gt;&gt; Harry&apos;s artistic vision seriously</p><p>You&apos;re right Jon, I should have left that out.</p><p>&gt;If you mean me, I certainly will never apologize for having<br/>&gt;worked with him, performed his music for many years, and<br/>&gt;continue study of his aesthetic.</p><p>I didn&apos;t mention aesthetic.</p><p>&gt;2.

But the differences in our interpretations<br/>&gt; of Partch&apos;s artistic vision are well documented over on the<br/>&gt; main list.</p><p>Threads spread too disparately. If you feel like an airing of what<br/>you think his &quot;artistic vision&quot; is/was, I&apos;d be curious to know. But<br/>I&apos;m in the process of last minute production efforts for the San Jose<br/>Centennial event, so I&apos;m about to wean myself off the lists for a few<br/>days.</p><p>&gt; &gt;But there is a whole hell of a lot that he would have had no use<br/>&gt; &gt;for.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That who would have had no use for?</p><p>Partch. While many glom onto Genesis for its theory, he basically got<br/>that stuff hashed out as far as he wanted (and, as I said before,<br/>would most likely be interested in the many developments since), and<br/>he left that behind to make music. And from that point on he had<br/>little interest, beyond the casual, in all the intense type of<br/>theoretical research that we find so much on the tuning lists. And he<br/>spoke on many occasions with disdain at those who would reduce his<br/>work to &apos;merely&apos; the development/use of modern-day just intonation.</p><p>&gt; For me, Partch said something about human life.  I didn&apos;t know<br/>&gt; him, and I&apos;ve never been in a performance of his music.  But<br/>&gt; I have my interpretation, and it isn&apos;t for the faint of heart.</p><p>If you believe he spoke about human life, then you have to figure<br/>just what it was like knowing him, and include that in the<br/>interpretation. One of the most amazing things I&apos;ve witnessed is the<br/>delving, in mind-numbing detail, into arcane bits of information from<br/>long-dead theorists and composers, and yet when there are people<br/>alive with the same knowledge, they are treated like mush-brained<br/>cultists.</p><p>Well, I&apos;m not mush-brained! And I don&apos;t wear brand new sneakers or<br/>drink Kool-Aid... :)</p><p>&gt; Info?  I&apos;ll be there!</p><p>I did one posting to the list, but I&apos;m actually working out details<br/>for new info on the site tonight and a new email which will get to<br/>the tuning list as well. And if you want to see a beautiful poster<br/>for the event, there should be one down at Amoeba Records (unless<br/>they&apos;ve gotten ripped off!) and other places in the Bay Area...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=1512 href="#1512">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2002 6:37:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I did one posting to the list, but I&apos;m actually working out details<br/>&gt; for new info on the site tonight and a new email which will get to<br/>&gt; the tuning list as well.</p><p>Good, because while there is quite a bit of Partch Centennial info out there, it isn&apos;t about the San Jose event.</p></div><h3><a id=1513 href="#1513">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2002 6:47:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Good, because while there is quite a bit of Partch Centennial info<br/>out there, it isn&apos;t about the San Jose event.</p><p>Latest update to the site, which was 01/06/02, contains the basics of<br/>the San Jose event as the first news item:</p><p><a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p><p>But why not wait until later tonight for a more in-depth listing...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
