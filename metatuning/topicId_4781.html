S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) revealed a<br/>second incident of contamination of a food crop by<br/>an experimental genetically engineered crop, engineered to contain a<br/>pharmaceutical or industrial chemical, in Iowa. This follows<br/>yesterday?x2019;s announcement that 500,000 bushels of soybeans in<br/>Nebraska destined for human consumption have also<br/>been quarantined due to biocontamination by a similar crop.<br/>The USDA has refused to reveal what chemical or drug was grown in either<br/>crop, but research into the company that produces the<br/>biopharmaceutical crops, ProdiGene, reveals that the contaminates could<br/>be one of the following:<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half; Aids vaccine ?gp120 a glycoprotein<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half; Blood-clotting agent&iuml;&iquest;&half;Aprotinin<br/> &iuml;&iquest;&half; Digestive enzyme&iuml;&iquest;&half;Trypsin<br/> &iuml;&iquest;&half; Industrial adhesive&iuml;&iquest;&half;Laccase, an enzyme derived from a fungus</p><p>Other biopharm crops reportedly grown by ProdiGene include experimental<br/>oral vaccines for hepatitis B and for a pig disease,<br/> transmissible gastroenteritis. According to USDA records ProdiGene has<br/>received 85 test permits for experimental open-air trials of<br/>genetically engineered biopharmaceutical and chemical crops for planting<br/>in at least 96 locations. More information on ProdiGene.<br/> ?x201C;With this latest contamination the government should halt all<br/>experimental genetically engineered crops grown on<br/>farms,?x201D; said Matt Rand, biotechnology campaign manager for the<br/>National Environmental Trust. ?x201C;If the government<br/> continues to develop policies for the biotech industry instead of for<br/>the safety of the U.S. food supply it is just a matter of time<br/> before one of these experimental crops ends up on our dinner<br/>plates.?x201D;.<br/>Today,the GEFoodAlert coalition announced its intention to file a legal<br/>petition to the USDA calling for the immediate halt to all<br/> biopharms. Additionally with the US government not revealing pertinent<br/>information on the contamination incidents, the Center for<br/> Food Safety, a member of the coalition, filed a Freedom of Information<br/>Act (FOIA) petition to access all government documents on<br/>ProdiGene. A similar FOIA was submitted by Friends of the Earth in April<br/>2001and the USDA declined to provide permit<br/>information.<br/> Last week members of GEFoodAlert coalition met with the USDA regarding<br/>the open-air farm testing of biopharmaceuticals and<br/>asked the USDA if contamination testing was taking place. The USDA<br/>flatly denied that any contamination testing was being<br/> performed.</p><p> ?x201C;The government clearly knew about this contamination weeks ago<br/>and chose not to reveal the information to the public,<br/> but instead worked behind closed doors with the industry to try to<br/>cover this up,?x201D; said Joseph Mendelson, legal director at<br/>the Center for Food Safety.</p><p> ###<br/>For a comprehensive report on biopharm, see <a href="http://www.gefoodalert.org">www.gefoodalert.org</a>.<br/> The GEFoodAlert is a coalition of health, consumer and environmental<br/>groups that supports the removal of genetically engineered<br/>ingredients from grocery store shelves unless they are adequately safety<br/>tested and labeled.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
