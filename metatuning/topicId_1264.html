CLARKE OFFERS HIS VISION OF THE FUTURE<br/>By Raymond Kurzweil &amp; Arthur C. Clarke<br/><a href="http://KurzweilAI.net">KurzweilAI.net</a><br/>December 3, 2001</p><p>On Friday, November 30, 2001, Arthur C. Clarke, author of 2001: A Space<br/>Odyssey, and inventor of the geosynchronous communications satellite, joined<br/>myself and two other panelists by video and phone connection from Sri Lanka<br/>to offer his vision of the future. The event took place at Worcester<br/>Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts in front of an audience of<br/>approximately 500 college and high school students and teachers.</p><p>The other panelists included Alison Taunton-Rigby, president of Forester<br/>Biotech and David Cyganski, WPI professor of electrical and computer<br/>engineering and an expert in machine vision.</p><p>The legendary science fiction author offered the predictions below. My own<br/>view is that Clarke&apos;s near term predictions involving energy are at least a<br/>decade premature. However, many of his predictions involving intelligent<br/>machines and nanotechnology are insightful and reflect a keen understanding<br/>of the acceleration of technological progress.</p><p>Arthur C. Clarke&apos;s predictions for the next century:</p><p>2002 - Clean low-power fuel involving a new energy source, possibly based on<br/>cold fusion.</p><p>2003 - The automobile industry is given five years to replace fossil fuels.</p><p>2004 - First publicly admitted human clone.</p><p>2006 - Last coal mine closed.</p><p>2009 - A city in a third world country is devastated by an atomic bomb<br/>explosion.</p><p>2009 - All nuclear weapons are destroyed.</p><p>2010 - A new form of space-based energy is adopted.</p><p>2010 - Despite protests against &quot;big brother,&quot; ubiquitous monitoring<br/>eliminates many forms of criminal activity.</p><p>2011 - Space flights become available for the public.</p><p>2013 - Prince Harry flies in space.</p><p>2015 - Complete control of matter at the atomic level is achieved.</p><p>2016 - All existing currencies are abolished. A universal currency is<br/>adopted based on the &quot;megawatt hour.&quot;</p><p>2017 - Arthur C. Clarke, on his one hundredth birthday, is a guest on the<br/>space orbiter.</p><p>2019 - There is a meteorite impact on Earth.</p><p>2020 - Artificial Intelligence reaches human levels. There are now two<br/>intelligent species on Earth, one biological, and one nonbiological.</p><p>2021 - The first human landing on Mars is achieved. There is an unpleasant<br/>surprise.</p><p>2023 - Dinosaurs are cloned from fragments of DNA. A dinosaur zoo opens in<br/>Florida.</p><p>2025 - Brain research leads to an understanding of all human senses. Full<br/>immersion virtual reality becomes available. The user puts on a metal helmet<br/>and is then able to enter &quot;new universes.&quot;</p><p>2040 - A universal replicator based on nanotechnology is now able to create<br/>any object from gourmet meals to diamonds. The only thing that has value is<br/>information.</p><p>2040 - The concept of human &quot;work&quot; is phased out.</p><p>2061 - Hunter gatherer societies are recreated.</p><p>2061 - The return of Haley&apos;s comet is visited by humans.</p><p>2090 - Large scale burning of fossil fuels is resumed to replace carbon<br/>dioxide.</p><p>2095 - A true &quot;space drive&quot; is developed. The first humans are sent out to<br/>nearby star systems already visited by robots.</p><p>2100 - History begins.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>------------</p></div>
