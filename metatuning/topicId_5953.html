Anyway, I just<br/>paid $$$ for the 6 upgrade two months ago.  So $150 for me<br/>seems a bit high.</p><p>And I still don&apos;t think it&apos;s that good.  I&apos;ve owned full<br/>versions since version 2 or 3, but I always wind up using<br/>Cool Edit.  But now that Adobe have got their claws on it,<br/>I&apos;m expecting it to be bloated and ruined within the year.<br/>Complete with &quot;sampler-mover tool&quot;...</p><p>But I digress.  I&apos;m sick of paying for this monstrosity.<br/>I bittorrented it.  Screw the glubbermint.  Yeah!
