Unlike that<br/>largely desert-based conflict, most of the rounds fired in March and<br/>April<br/>were in heavily residential areas.</p><p>DU rounds are highly combustible and tiny particles of the radioactive<br/>material are left on the battleground.</p><p>If inhaled the material can attack the body causing cancers, chronic<br/>illness, long-term disabilities and genetic birth defects - none of<br/>which will be<br/>apparent for at least five years.</p><p>Veterans of the first Gulf War believe that DU exposure has played a<br/>role in leaving more than 5,000 of them chronically ill and almost 600<br/>dead.</p><p>The Royal Society, Britain&apos;s leading scientific body, described<br/>America&apos;s failure to confirm how much or where they used DU rounds as an</p><p>&quot;appalling situation&quot;.</p><p>Professor Brian Spratt, chairman of the society&apos;s working group on DU,<br/>said: &quot;The Americans are really giving us no information at all and<br/>think it<br/>is a pretty appalling situation that they are not taking this seriously<br/>at all.</p><p>&quot;We really need someone like the UN Environment Programme or the World<br/>Health Organisation to get into Iraq and start testing civilians and<br/>soldiers for uranium exposure.&quot;</p><p>Evidence of massive uranium radiation has emerged in recent weeks. The<br/>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle analysed swabs from<br/>bullet holes in Iraqi tanks and confirmed elevated radiation levels.</p><p>Last month Scott Peterson, of the respected Christian Science Monitor,<br/>took Geiger counter readings at several sites in Baghdad. Near the<br/>Republican Palace, his radiation readings were the &quot;hottest&quot; in Iraq at<br/>nearly 1,900 times background radiation levels.</p><p>Even the Ministry of Defence, which has consistently refused to accept<br/>there are dangers involved in DU exposure or that it has played role in<br/>Gulf<br/>War illnesses is addressing the problem. Soldiers returning from this<br/>year&apos;s conflict will be routinely tested for uranium poisoning.<br/>Professor<br/>Malcolm Hooper, who sits on two committees advising the Government on<br/>Gulf health issues, said he is not surprised by the radiation levels.</p><p>He said: &quot;Really these things are dirty bombs. Exactly the sort of<br/>device that President Bush and Prime Minister Blair keep talking about<br/>being in<br/>the hands of terrorists.&quot;</p><p>Dozens of US soldiers, backed by armoured vehicles and helicopter<br/>gunships, searched farms on the outskirts of the northern Iraqi city of<br/>Mosul<br/>yesterday in their hunt for followers of Saddam Hussein.</p><p>THOUSANDS of Iraqis packed into northern Baghdad yesterday for the<br/>funeral of Ayatollah Mohammed Baqer al-Hakim, a Shi&apos;ite Muslim cleric<br/>slain by a car bomb which also killed scores of his followers.</p><p>A senior official in Hakim&apos;s Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution<br/>in Iraq (SCIRI) said the Americans bore some blame for Friday&apos;s attack<br/>as<br/>they had failed to ensure adequate security measures.</p><p>Up to five suspects, all of them Iraqi, have been detained over the car<br/>bomb attack, the local governor said yesterday.</p><p>END<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
