Some<br/>time back, I started a thread, and on the very first response it veered<br/>into something else altogether.  I eagerly opened each of the many<br/>follow-up posts with the same subject line, and they _all_ were<br/>responses to the other topic!  Arggh.  But I&apos;ve been guilty too, and I&apos;m<br/>the only guy who can control the subject line of MY posts, so I&apos;ll try<br/>to be more aware of this.</p><p>JdL</p><p>P.S. On the subject of farm animals, do _not_ go to the movie &quot;The<br/>Animal&quot; (my 15-year-old son conned me into seeing it).  Compared to<br/>this, &quot;Saving Silverman&quot; and &quot;Joe Dirt&quot; are high art.</p></div>
