John Watkins, R-Chesterfield, said the bill<br/>responds to a growing problem of identity theft. Stolen<br/>driver&apos;s licenses, Social Security cards and passports<br/>have allowed thieves to con banks and tap into credit<br/>lines. Home computers, scanners, printers and various<br/>software make it easy for criminals to create<br/>fraudulent accounts in victims&apos; names.</p><p>[Actually one of the top sources of fradulent IDs<br/>IS the state DMVs -- their employees are notorious<br/>for selling ID and blank documents to their friends.<br/>This will do nothing to stop that. Also note that<br/>most of the recent terrorists have had LEGITIMATE<br/>IDs. So what problem does this really solve? The<br/>problem of the gov&apos;t not being able to track and<br/>control the common folk as much as they would like.<br/>Are we the slaves of the government? How we respond<br/>to these incursions tells if we give or withdraw our<br/>consent to by owned by Ol&apos; Massa Sam.]</p><p>The measure passed, 28 to 10, with one abstention. It<br/>now goes to the House of Delegates for consideration.</p><p>More General Assembly news, bill tracking, discussions,<br/>citizens guide, links Several senators opposed<br/>requiring law-abiding citizens to give fingerprints to<br/>the state. While acknowledging it is a worthy goal to<br/>enhance safety and security, they also argued that the<br/>proposal is too broad in giving the state the right to<br/>                      --------------------------------<br/>require DNA samples.<br/>-------------------</p><p>&quot;That concerns me,&quot; said Sen. William T. Bolling,<br/>R-Hanover. Watkins said it was unlikely the department<br/>           -------------------------------------------<br/>would require DNA samples because they are expensive to<br/>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>collect. He said adding a fingerprint to the front or<br/>-------<br/>back of a license would cost between $1 and $2 per<br/>card.</p><p>[Note that cost is the only reason discussed - not<br/>privacy.]</p><p>Watkins said the state needs to catch up with the new<br/>technology and new ways of fraud. The Department of<br/>Motor Vehicles already collects biometric information,<br/>he said, in the form of pictures used on a license.</p><p>&quot;There are those who say George Orwell has arrived in<br/>Richmond,&quot; Watkins said. &quot;Look over your shoulder. He<br/>got here 10 years ago.&quot;</p><p>Watkins said he did not advocate having the DMV keeping<br/>the information on file, although he noted the<br/>department already keeps photographs.</p><p>He said it would be more difficult to forge papers if<br/>another kind of identification is required. A person<br/>may be asked to give an additional thumbprint if a bank<br/>or government agency doubted the authenticity of his or<br/>her license or identification.</p><p>[What good would that do?]</p><p>For law-abiding citizens, he said, &quot;it only provides<br/>another layer of protection.&quot;</p><p>[Does it?]</p><p>Kent Willis, executive director of the Virginia Chapter<br/>of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the state<br/>should collect private information only when it is<br/>absolutely necessary. The state should study whether</p><p>[Maybe the ACLU should stop pandering to gov&apos;t and<br/>revise their statement to use the word &apos;never&apos;.]</p><p>the thumbprints would actually make Virginians safer<br/>and more secure, he said.</p><p>[The government can order studies to say whatever<br/>conclusion the gov&apos;t is looking for.]</p><p>Instead, he said, &quot;someone will spend more money for<br/>licenses, and the privacy of citizens will be invaded.&quot;</p></div>
