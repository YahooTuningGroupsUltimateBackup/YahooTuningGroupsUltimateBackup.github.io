The silence felt almost eerie after a night of<br/>shooting so intense it hurt the eardrums and shattered the nerves. My<br/>footsteps felt heavy on the hot, dusty asphalt as I walked slowly towards<br/>the bridge at Nasiriya. A horrific scene lay ahead.</p><p>Some 15 vehicles, including a minivan and a couple of trucks, blocked the<br/>road. They were riddled with bullet holes. Some had caught fire and turned<br/>into piles of black twisted metal. Others were still burning.</p><p>Amid the wreckage I counted 12 dead civilians, lying in the road or in<br/>nearby ditches. All had been trying to leave this southern town overnight,<br/>probably for fear of being killed by US helicopter attacks and heavy<br/>artillery.</p><p>Their mistake had been to flee over a bridge that is crucial to the<br/>coalition&apos;s supply lines and to run into a group of shell-shocked young<br/>American marines with orders to shoot anything that moved.</p><p>One man&apos;s body was still in flames. It gave out a hissing sound. Tucked away<br/>in his breast pocket, thick wads of banknotes were turning to ashes. His<br/>savings, perhaps.</p><p>Down the road, a little girl, no older than five and dressed in a pretty<br/>orange and gold dress, lay dead in a ditch next to the body of a man who may<br/>have been her father. Half his head was missing.</p><p>Nearby, in a battered old Volga, peppered with ammunition holes, an Iraqi<br/>woman - perhaps the girl&apos;s mother - was dead, slumped in the back seat. A US<br/>Abrams tank nicknamed Ghetto Fabulous drove past the bodies.</p><p>This was not the only family who had taken what they thought was a last<br/>chance for safety. A father, baby girl and boy lay in a shallow grave. On<br/>the bridge itself a dead Iraqi civilian lay next to the carcass of a donkey.</p><p>As I walked away, Lieutenant Matt Martin, whose third child, Isabella, was<br/>born while he was on board ship en route to the Gulf, appeared beside me.</p><p>&quot;Did you see all that?&quot; he asked, his eyes filled with tears. &quot;Did you see<br/>that little baby girl? I carried her body and buried it as best I could but<br/>I had no time. It really gets to me to see children being killed like this,<br/>but we had no choice.&quot;</p><p>Martin&apos;s distress was in contrast to the bitter satisfaction of some of his<br/>fellow marines as they surveyed the scene. &quot;The Iraqis are sick people and<br/>we are the chemotherapy,&quot; said Corporal Ryan Dupre. &quot;I am starting to hate<br/>this country. Wait till I get hold of a friggin&apos; Iraqi. No, I won&apos;t get hold<br/>of one. I&apos;ll just kill him.&quot;</p><p>Only a few days earlier these had still been the bright-eyed small-town boys<br/>with whom I crossed the border at the start of the operation. They had<br/>rolled towards Nasiriya, a strategic city beside the Euphrates, on a mission<br/>to secure a safe supply route for troops on the way to Baghdad.</p><p>They had expected a welcome, or at least a swift surrender. Instead they had<br/>found themselves lured into a bloody battle, culminating in the worst<br/>coalition losses of the war - 16 dead, 12 wounded and two missing marines as<br/>well as five dead and 12 missing servicemen from an army convoy - and the<br/>humiliation of having prisoners paraded on Iraqi television.</p><p>There are three key bridges at Nasiriya. The feat of Martin, Dupre and their<br/>fellow marines in securing them under heavy fire was compared by armchair<br/>strategists last week to the seizure of the Remagen bridge over the Rhine,<br/>which significantly advanced victory over Germany in the second world war.</p><p>But it was also the turning point when the jovial band of brothers from<br/>America lost all their assumptions about the war and became jittery<br/>aggressors who talked of wanting to &quot;nuke&quot; the place.</p><p>None of this was foreseen at Camp Shoup, one of the marines&apos; tent<br/>encampments in northern Kuwait, where officers from the 1st and 2nd<br/>battalions of Task Force Tarawa, the 7,000-strong US Marines brigade, spent<br/>long evenings poring over maps and satellite imagery before the invasion.</p><p>The plan seemed straightforward. The marines would speed unhindered over the<br/>130 miles of desert up from the Kuwaiti border and approach Nasiriya from<br/>the southeast to secure a bridge over the Euphrates. They would then drive<br/>north through the outskirts of Nasiriya to a second bridge, over the Inahr<br/>al-Furbati canal. Finally, they would turn west and secure the third bridge,<br/>also over the canal. The marines would not enter the city proper, let alone<br/>attempt to take it.</p><p>The coalition could then start moving thousands of troops and logistical<br/>support units up highway 7, leading to Baghdad, 225 miles to the north.</p><p>There was only one concern: &quot;ambush alley&quot;, the road connecting the first<br/>two bridges. But intelligence suggested there would be little or no fighting<br/>as this eastern side of the city was mostly &quot;pro-American&quot;.</p><p>I was with Alpha company. We reached the outskirts of Nasiriya at about<br/>breakfast time last Sunday. Some marines were disappointed to be carrying<br/>out a mission that seemed a sideshow to the main effort. But in an ominous<br/>sign of things to come, our battalion stopped in its tracks, three miles<br/>outside the city.</p><p>Bad news filtered back. Earlier that morning a US Army convoy had been<br/>greeted by a group of Iraqis dressed in civilian clothes, apparently wanting<br/>to surrender. When the American soldiers stopped, the Iraqis pulled out<br/>AK-47s and sprayed the US trucks with gunfire.</p><p>Five wounded soldiers were rescued by our convoy, including one who had been<br/>shot four times. The attackers were believed to be members of the Fedayeen<br/>Saddam, a group of 15,000 fighters under the command of Saddam&apos;s<br/>psychopathic son Uday.</p><p>Blown-up tyres, a pool of blood, spent ammunition and shards of glass from<br/>the bulletridden windscreen marked the spot where the ambush had taken<br/>place. Swiftly, our AAVs (23-ton amphibious assault vehicles) took up<br/>defensive positions. About 100 marines jumped out of their vehicles and took<br/>cover in ditches, pointing their sights at a mud-caked house. Was it<br/>harbouring gunmen? Small groups of marines approached, cautiously, to search<br/>for the enemy. A dozen terrified civilians, mainly women and children,<br/>emerged with their hands raised.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s just a bunch of Hajis,&quot; said one gunner from his turret, using their<br/>nickname for Arabs. &quot;Friggin&apos; women and children, that&apos;s all.&quot;</p><p>Cobras and Huey attack helicopters began firing missiles at targets on the<br/>edge of the city. Plumes of smoke rose as heavy artillery shook the ground<br/>under our feet.</p><p>Heavy machinegun fire echoed across the huge rubbish dump that marks the<br/>entrance to Nasiriya. Suddenly there was return fire from three large oil<br/>tanks at a refinery. The Cobras were called back, and within seconds they<br/>roared above our heads, firing off missiles in clouds of purple tracer fire.</p><p>There were several loud explosions. Flames burst high into the sky from one<br/>of the oil tanks. The marines believed that what opposition there was had<br/>now been crushed. &quot;We are going in, we are going in,&quot; shouted one of the<br/>officers.</p><p>More than 20 AAVs, several tanks and about 10 Hummers equipped with<br/>roof-mounted, anti-tank missile launchers prepared to move in. Crammed<br/>inside them were some 400 marines. Tension rose as they loaded their guns<br/>and stuck their heads over the side of the AAVs through the open roof, their<br/>M-16 pointed in all directions.</p><p>As we set off towards the eastern city gate there was no sense of the mayhem<br/>awaiting us down the road. A few locals dressed in rags watched the awesome<br/>spectacle of America&apos;s war machine on the move. Nobody waved.</p><p>Slowly we approached the first bridge. Fires were raging on either side of<br/>the road; Cobras had destroyed an Iraqi military truck and a T55 tank<br/>positioned inside a dugout. Powerful explosions came from inside the bowels<br/>of the tank as its ammunition and heavy shells were set off by the fire.<br/>With each explosion a thick and perfect ring of black smoke ring puffed out<br/>of the turret.</p><p>An Iraqi defence post lay abandoned. Cobras flew over an oasis of palm trees<br/>and deserted brick and mud-caked houses. We charged onto the bridge, and as<br/>we crossed the Euphrates, a large mural of Saddam came into view. Some<br/>marines reached for their disposable cameras.</p><p>Suddenly, as we approached ambush alley on the far side of the bridge, the<br/>crackle of AK-47s broke out. Our AAVs began to zigzag to avoid being hit by<br/>a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG).</p><p>The road widened out to a square, with a mosque and the portrait of Saddam<br/>on the left-hand side. The vehicles wheeled round, took up a defensive<br/>position, back to back, and began taking fire.</p><p>Pinned down, the marines fired back with 40mm automatic grenade launchers, a<br/>weapon so powerful it can go through thick brick walls and kill anyone<br/>within a 5-yard range of where the shell lands.</p><p>I was in AAV number A304, affectionately nicknamed the Desert Caddy. It<br/>shook as Keith Bernize, the gunner, fired off round after deafening round at<br/>sandbag positions shielding suspected Fedayeen fighters. His steel<br/>ammunition box clanged with the sound of smoking empty shells and<br/>cartridges.</p><p>Bernize, who always carries a scan picture of his unborn baby daughter with<br/>him, shot at the targets from behind a turret, peering through narrow slits<br/>of reinforced glass. He shouted at his men to feed him more ammunition. Four<br/>marines, standing at the AAV&apos;s four corners, precariously perched on<br/>ammunition boxes, fired off their M-16s.</p><p>Their faces covered in sweat, officers shouted commands into field radios,<br/>giving co-ordinates of enemy positions. Some 200 marines, fully exposed to<br/>enemy fire and slowed down by their heavy weapons, bulky ammunition packs<br/>and NBC suits, ran across the road, taking shelter behind a long brick wall<br/>and mounds of earth. A team of snipers appeared, yards from our vehicle.</p><p>The exchange of fire was relentless. We were pinned down for more than three<br/>hours as Iraqis hiding inside houses and a hospital and behind street<br/>corners fired a barrage of ammunition.</p><p>Despite the marines&apos; overwhelming firepower, hitting the Iraqis was not<br/>easy. The gunmen were not wearing uniforms and had planned their ambush well<br/>- stockpiling weapons in dozens of houses, between which they moved freely<br/>pretending to be civilians.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s a bad situation,&quot; said First Sergeant James Thompson, who was running<br/>around with a 9mm pistol in his hand. &quot;We don&apos;t know who is shooting at us.<br/>They are even using women as scouts. The women come out waving at us, or<br/>with their hands raised. We freeze, but the next minute we can see how she<br/>is looking at our positions and giving them away to the fighters hiding<br/>behind a street corner. It&apos;s very difficult to distinguish between the<br/>fighters and civilians.&quot;</p><p>Across the square, genuine civilians were running for their lives. Many,<br/>including some children, were gunned down in the crossfire. In a surreal<br/>scene, a father and mother stood out on a balcony with their children in<br/>their arms to give them a better view of the battle raging below. A few<br/>minutes later several US mortar shells landed in front of their house. In<br/>all probability, the family is dead.</p><p>The fighting intensified. An Iraqi fighter emerged from behind a wall of<br/>sandbags 500 yards away from our vehicle. Several times he managed to fire<br/>off an RPG at our positions. Bernize and other gunners fired dozens of<br/>rounds at his dugout, punching large holes into a house and lifting thick<br/>clouds of dust.</p><p>Captain Mike Brooks, commander of Alpha company, pinned down in front of the<br/>mosque, called in tank support. Armed with only a 9mm pistol, he jumped out<br/>of the back of his AAV with a young marine carrying a field radio on his<br/>back.</p><p>Brooks, 34, from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, had been in command of 200 men<br/>for just over a year. He joined the marines when he was 19 because he felt<br/>that he was wasting his life. He needed direction, was a bit of a rebel and<br/>was impressed by the sense of pride in the corps.</p><p>He is a soft-spoken man, fair but very firm. Brave too: I watched him sprint<br/>in front of enemy positions to brief some of his junior officers behind a<br/>wall. Behind us, two 68-ton Abrams tanks rolled up, crushing the barrier<br/>separating the lanes on the highway.</p><p>The earth shook violently as one tank, Desert Knight, stopped in front of<br/>our row of AAVS and fired several 120mm shells into buildings.</p><p>A few hundred yards down ambush alley there was carnage. An AAV from Charlie<br/>company was racing back towards the bridge to evacuate some wounded marines<br/>when it was hit by two RPGs. The heavy vehicle shook but withstood the<br/>explosions.</p><p>Then the Iraqis fired again. This time the rocket plunged into the vehicle<br/>through the open rooftop. The explosion was deadly, made 10 times more<br/>powerful by the ammunition stored in the back.</p><p>The wreckage smouldered in the middle of the road. I jumped out from the<br/>rear hatch of our vehicle, briefly taking cover behind a wall. When I<br/>reached the stricken AAV, the scene was mayhem.</p><p>The heavy, thick rear ramp had been blown open. There were pools of blood<br/>and bits of flesh everywhere. A severed leg, still wearing a desert boot,<br/>lay on what was left of the ramp among playing cards, a magazine, cans of<br/>Coke and a small bloodstained teddy bear.</p><p>&quot;They are f****** dead, they are dead. Oh my God. Get in there. Get in there<br/>now and pull them out,&quot; shouted a gunner in a state verging on hysterical.</p><p>There was panic and confusion as a group of young marines, shouting and<br/>cursing orders at one another, pulled out a maimed body.</p><p>Two men struggled to lift the body on a stretcher and into the back of a<br/>Hummer, but it would not fit inside, so the stretcher remained almost<br/>upright, the dead man&apos;s leg, partly blown away, dangling in the air.</p><p>&quot;We shouldn&apos;t be here,&quot; said Lieutenant Campbell Kane, 25, who was born in<br/>Northern Ireland. &quot;We can&apos;t hold this. They are trying to suck us into the<br/>city and we haven&apos;t got enough ass up here to sustain this. We need more<br/>tanks, more helicopters.&quot;</p><p>Closer to the destroyed AAV, another young marine was transfixed with fear<br/>and kept repeating: &quot;Oh my God, I can&apos;t believe this. Did you see his leg?<br/>It was blown off. It was blown off.&quot;</p><p>Two CH-46 helicopters, nicknamed Frogs, landed a few hundred yards away in<br/>the middle of a firefight to take away the dead and wounded.</p><p>If at first the marines felt constrained by orders to protect civilians, by<br/>now the battle had become so intense that there was little time for<br/>niceties. Cobra helicopters were ordered to fire at a row of houses closest<br/>to our positions. There were massive explosions but the return fire barely<br/>died down.</p><p>Behind us, as many as four AAVs that had driven down along the banks of the<br/>Euphrates were stuck in deep mud and coming under fire.</p><p>About 1pm, after three hours of intense fighting, the order was given to<br/>regroup and try to head out of the city in convoy. Several marines who had<br/>lost their vehicles piled into the back of ours.</p><p>We raced along ambush alley at full speed, close to a line of houses. &quot;My<br/>driver got hit,&quot; said one of the marines who joined us, his face and uniform<br/>caked in mud. &quot;I went to try to help him when he got hit by another RPG or a<br/>mortar. I don&apos;t even know how many friends I have lost. I don&apos;t care if they<br/>nuke that bloody city now. From one house they were waving while shooting at<br/>us with AKs from the next. It was insane.&quot;</p><p>There was relief when we finally crossed the second bridge to the northeast<br/>of the city in mid-afternoon. But there was more horror to come. Beside the<br/>smouldering wreckage of another AAV were the bodies of another four marines,<br/>laid out in the mud and covered with camouflage ponchos. There were body<br/>parts everywhere.</p><p>One of the dead was Second Lieutenant Fred Pokorney, 31, a marine artillery<br/>officer from Washington state. He was a big guy, whose ill-fitting uniform<br/>was the butt of many jokes. It was supposed to have been a special day for<br/>Pokorney. After 13 years of service, he was to be promoted to first<br/>lieutenant. The men of Charlie company had agreed they would all shake hands<br/>with him to celebrate as soon as they crossed the second bridge, their<br/>mission accomplished.</p><p>It didn&apos;t happen. Pokorney made it over the second bridge and a few hundred<br/>yards down a highway through dusty flatlands before his vehicle was<br/>ambushed. Pokorney and his men had no chance. Fully loaded with ammunition,<br/>their truck exploded in the middle of the road, its remains burning for<br/>hours. Pokorney was hit in the chest by an RPG.</p><p>Another man who died was Fitzgerald Jordan, a staff sergeant from Texas. I<br/>felt numb when I heard this. I had met Jordan 10 days before we moved into<br/>Nasiriya. He was a character, always chewing tobacco and coming up to pat<br/>you on the back. He got me to fetch newspapers for him from Kuwait City.<br/>Later, we shared a bumpy ride across the desert in the back of a Humvee.</p><p>A decorated Gulf war veteran, he used to complain about having to come back<br/>to Iraq. &quot;We should have gone all the way to Baghdad 12 years ago when we<br/>were here and had a real chance of removing Saddam.&quot;</p><p>Now Pokorney, Jordan and their comrades lay among unspeakable carnage. An<br/>older marine walked by carrying a huge chunk of flesh, so maimed it was<br/>impossible to tell which body part it was. With tears in his eyes and blood<br/>splattered over his flak jacket, he held the remains of his friend in his<br/>arms until someone gave him a poncho to wrap them with.</p><p>Frantic medics did what they could to relieve horrific injuries, until four<br/>helicopters landed in the middle of the highway to take the injured to a<br/>military hospital. Each wounded marine had a tag describing his injury. One<br/>had gunshot wounds to the face, another to the chest. Another simply lay on<br/>his side in the sand with a tag reading: &quot;Urgent - surgery, buttock.&quot;</p><p>One young marine was assigned the job of keeping the flies at bay. Some of<br/>his comrades, exhausted, covered in blood, dirt and sweat walked around<br/>dazed. There were loud cheers as the sound of the heaviest artillery yet to<br/>pound Nasiriya shook the ground.</p><p>Before last week the overwhelming majority of these young men had never been<br/>in combat. Few had even seen a dead body. Now, their faces had changed.<br/>Anger and fear were fuelled by rumours that the bodies of American soldiers<br/>had been dragged through Nasiriya&apos;s streets. Some marines cried in the arms<br/>of friends, others sought comfort in the Bible.</p><p>Next morning, the men of Alpha company talked about the fighting over MREs<br/>(meals ready to eat). They were jittery now and reacted nervously to any<br/>movement around their dugouts. They suspected that civilian cars, including<br/>taxis, had helped resupply the enemy inside the city. When cars were spotted<br/>speeding along two roads, frantic calls were made over the radio to get<br/>permission to &quot;kill the vehicles&quot;. Twenty-four hours earlier it would almost<br/>certainly have been denied: now it was granted.</p><p>Immediately, the level of force levelled at civilian vehicles was<br/>overwhelming. Tanks were placed on the road and AAVs lined along one side.<br/>Several taxis were destroyed by helicopter gunships as they drove down the<br/>road.</p><p>A lorry filled with sacks of wheat made the fatal mistake of driving through<br/>US lines. The order was given to fire. Several AAVs pounded it with a<br/>barrage of machinegun fire, riddling the windscreen with at least 20 holes.<br/>The driver was killed instantly. The lorry swerved off the road and into a<br/>ditch. Rumour spread that the driver had been armed and had fired at the<br/>marines. I walked up to the lorry, but could find no trace of a weapon.</p><p>This was the start of day that claimed many civilian casualties. After the<br/>lorry a truck came down the road. Again the marines fired. Inside, four men<br/>were killed. They had been travelling with some 10 other civilians, mainly<br/>women and children who were evacuated, crying, their clothes splattered in<br/>blood. Hours later a dog belonging to the dead driver was still by his side.</p><p>The marines moved west to take a military barracks and secure their third<br/>objective, the third bridge, which carried a road out of the city.</p><p>At the barracks, the marines hung a US flag from a statue of Saddam, but<br/>Lieutenant-Colonel Rick Grabowski, the battalion commander, ordered it down.<br/>He toured barracks. There were stacks of Russian-made ammunition and<br/>hundreds of Iraqi army uniforms, some new, others left behind by fleeing<br/>Iraqi soldiers.</p><p>One room had a map of Nasiriya, showing its defences and two large cardboard<br/>arrows indicating the US plan of attack to take the two main bridges. Above<br/>the map were several murals praising Saddam. One, which sickened the<br/>Americans, showed two large civilian planes crashing into tall buildings.</p><p>As night fell again there was great tension, the marines fearing an ambush.<br/>Two tanks and three AAVs were placed at the north end of the third bridge,<br/>their guns pointing down towards Nasiriya, and given orders to shoot at any<br/>vehicle that drove towards American positions.</p><p>Though civilians on foot passed by safely, the policy was to shoot anything<br/>that moved on wheels. Inevitably, terrified civilians drove at speed to<br/>escape: marines took that speed to be a threat and hit out. During the<br/>night, our teeth on edge, we listened a dozen times as the AVVs&apos; machineguns<br/>opened fire, cutting through cars and trucks like paper.</p><p>Next morning I saw the result of this order - the dead civilians, the little<br/>girl in the orange and gold dress.</p><p>Suddenly, some of the young men who had crossed into Iraq with me reminded<br/>me now of their fathers&apos; generation, the trigger-happy grunts of Vietnam.<br/>Covered in the mud from the violent storms, they were drained and<br/>dangerously aggressive.</p><p>In the days afterwards, the marines consolidated their position and put a<br/>barrier of trucks across the bridge to stop anyone from driving across, so<br/>there were no more civilian deaths.</p><p>They also ruminated on what they had done. Some rationalised it.</p><p>&quot;I was shooting down a street when suddenly a woman came out and casually<br/>began to cross the street with a child no older than 10,&quot; said Gunnery<br/>Sergeant John Merriman, another Gulf war veteran. &quot;At first I froze on<br/>seeing the civilian woman. She then crossed back again with the child and<br/>went behind a wall. Within less than a minute a guy with an RPG came out and<br/>fired at us from behind the same wall. This happened a second time so I<br/>thought, &apos;Okay, I get it. Let her come out again&apos;.</p><p>She did and this time I took her out with my M-16.&quot;...</p></div>
