As much as we are under attack, and i will most clearly state that artist<br/>are under attack, we should have even less investment in functioning as propaganda elements. What can i possibly know<br/>about the middle east except what others tell me, why we should accept this type of second hand information is always<br/>dangerous. If an accident happens a block away , no matter how many of my neighbors tell me what happened, i cannot<br/>resist going there cause i will always get more out of it somehow.<br/>    Corruption is a whole other ball of wax  (not the Beuys kind) and transends politics.

That<br/>he feels this &quot;anonymous&quot; rant should be included on this list is unfortunate<br/>(least of all because now I have to respond in detail).  I do not feel it is<br/>fit to put anti-Palestinian or anti-Arabic diatribes on this list, however.  Nor<br/>do I think this is the place for Ku Klux Klan rants, etc.  But since it is &mldr;<br/>here &mldr;, there is little choice.  There is no reason to construe that my<br/>response signifies any belief in the opposite of what is ranted below, however.</p><p>Mideast Rant by: Anonymous posted by Carl Lumma for response<br/>&mldr;the choice of an anonymous is the first hint of inappropriateness to this<br/>list.<br/>----------------------------------------------------</p><p>In order to be a supporter of Israel, you must believe:</p><p>No one cared about Palestine until the Jews came and<br/>&quot;fixed it up&quot;. The Palestinians didn&apos;t care about their<br/>homes and land. They were happy to leave and live in<br/>refugee camps.<br/>&mldr;no one cared about he natives/indigenous peoples anywhere in the world by<br/>extension.  The Palestinians were not happy about their lot, but they did end up<br/>in refugee camps after a failed war by themselves, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria.</p><p>Jews need the occupied territories as part of their &quot;safe<br/>haven&quot; from worldwide persecution. A Jewish person is<br/>safer in the Gaza Strip than, say, Los Angeles.<br/>&mldr;this is anti-Semitism, for it is &quot;Jews&quot; that are addressed here, not<br/>Israelis.  &quot;Persecution&quot; is not the same as annihilation.  Jews are safer in the US<br/>than in most anywhere else in the world, however.  &quot;Owning&quot; Gaza Strip is like<br/>putting your head into a hungry lion, but keeping its jaws open.  Clearly,<br/>even this list is not a &quot;safe haven&quot; for  Jews.</p><p>It is the responsibility of other Arab nations to solve<br/>the Palestinian refugee problem which the Israelis created.<br/>&mldr;Actually, Europe created Israel through its policies of death and the<br/>resultant Balfour Declaration of England.  By 1948 Jews were a decimated people,<br/>unlikely to dislodge anyone for their land.  Arab nations played a part in<br/>destroying its ancient Jewish citizens as well, people who were older than the<br/>Muslims that converted later.</p><p>Events which happened 3,000 years ago are relevant to<br/>today, but 1948 and 1967 were a long time ago, and bygones<br/>should be bygones.<br/>&mldr;nothing is mutually exclusive.  We are all descended from people living<br/>3,000 years before and earlier.  Perhaps Jews remember a bit more than some<br/>others.</p><p>The lesson of the Nazi holocaust is not that it is wrong<br/>to persecute people based on their ancestry/religion; the<br/>lesson of the Nazi holocaust is that it is wrong to<br/>persecute Jews based on their ancestry/religion.<br/>&mldr;again &apos;persecute&apos; is the wrong word for the Nazis.  The holocaust was only<br/>the most recent development of over a thousand years of persecution AND<br/>annihilation (but for individual cities, etc. Worms, Mainz, Nordhausen. etc.).  The<br/>difference, explained to me by Germans, is that the Holocaust was the most<br/>highly engineered destruction of a people in human history.  (sounds like<br/>backhanded credit by the Germans a bit too much for my taste.)    It is often said the<br/>Kurds have no friends, and this list can be added to by many other peoples.<br/>Jews, being older, were more known and even through anti-Semitism in world<br/>leaders (including US presidents), they needed a solution that was less final<br/>than that of Hitler&apos;s.</p><p>When the UN voted in 1997 on General Assembly Resolution<br/>52/52, 155 countries were wrong and only the U.S. and<br/>Israel were right.<br/>&mldr;Israel is wrong in its paranoia, as well as when it wants to either<br/>monopolize or to take advantage.  But it cannot trust the UN.  That is the lesson of<br/>Kurt Waldheim and of Srebrenicia.</p><p>Because some Palestinians are terrorists, all<br/>Palestinians deserve to be punished.<br/>&mldr;just crap</p><p>As Ariel Sharon said: Settlements in the occupied<br/>territories need to expand because of &quot;natural population<br/>growth&quot;. It is natural and necessary for these settlers<br/>to have birth rates averaging more than seven children per<br/>family.<br/>&mldr;settlement extension is wrong and many Jews have acknowledged that.  This is<br/>ignored by those that can&apos;t imagine it in a black/white explanation of a<br/>complex situation.  For example, Palestinian cities like Hebron have had Jewish<br/>settlement for centuries, and within the human memory of many moderns.</p><p>It was irrational for the Palestinians to react violently<br/>to the Zionist movement in the first half of the 20th<br/>century because, after all, the goal of the Zionists was<br/>merely to transform their land into a Jewish theocracy in<br/>which Arabs would be second-class citizens in their own<br/>country. The Palestinians were paranoid in believing that<br/>this might actually happen.<br/>&mldr;to listen to some Europeans, it was irrational for Jews to defend themselves<br/>at all.  When seen as a vast Arabic world, one accomplished by taking over<br/>the people&apos;s and religions of those people&apos;s, Palestine seems quite small.  Jews<br/>were once widespread and are now with their backs against the proverbial walls<br/>&mldr;.wait, oh right, they are actually erecting physical walls.</p><p>Anyone who has compassion for Palestinians is anti-Semitic<br/>and hates all Jewish people.<br/>&mldr;this would mean that Carl is anti-Semitic, as well as myself.  Since I am<br/>not, and I prefer to believe that Carl is not (unless he would like to come out<br/>as an anti-Semite), this is just crap.</p><p>When Palestinians kill Israelis they are irrational<br/>&quot;terrorists&quot; contributing to the cycle of violence; but<br/>when Israelis kill Palestinians it is reasonable to expect<br/>that this &quot;retaliation&quot; will lead to peace.<br/>&mldr;to me it is irrational to turn to suicide murders of innocents.  For Israel<br/>to respond is to be expected.  Leading to Peace is not the reason for either<br/>side.  But it does sound like this one-sided diatribe by anonymous does not<br/>belong in Metatuning.</p><p>The UN Security Council was dispassionate and objective<br/>when it granted Israel&apos;s right to exist a few years after<br/>the Nazi Holocaust, but was &quot;just kidding&quot; when it passed<br/>242 &amp; 338.<br/>&mldr;And the Popes were only kidding about covering up the sexual destruction of<br/>the youth in their care.</p><p>The Palestinians think with one mind. They are all<br/>terrorists; they all want to kill all Jews and destroy<br/>Israel. Yasser Arafat is the Palestinian Borg Queen. If<br/>he ordered an end to all violence, all the Palestinians<br/>would obey his command.<br/>&mldr;and yet they have a centralized leadership under Arafat since the Balfour<br/>Declaration.  Is it too much to assume a difference between a central command<br/>that orders murders of innocents and one that treats the death of innocents of<br/>bystanders as unfortunate?  I admit they are quite close.  But musical<br/>intervals can be close and yet different.</p><p>It is an unknowable mystery why Ariel Sharon took<br/>hundreds of troops to occupy the Temple Mount on<br/>September 28, 2000, but it couldn&apos;t possibly have been<br/>because he wanted to incite Palestinian anger and thereby<br/>torpedo the peace talks.<br/>&mldr;.how amazingly effective Sharon was if that was his aim.  Why wouldn&apos;t<br/>Sharon have since just bombed the hell out of Gaza as an example to the West Bank,<br/>as the Nazis did to Rotterdam as an example to Amsterdam?  (I better answer<br/>this because some may not recognize that I was being rhetorical.)  Sharon is<br/>doing more of a tit for tat in his &quot;terrorism&quot; than he is destroying.</p><p>God gave this land to the Jews. God is a racist.<br/>&mldr;there is no god.  And there are no races.</p><p>The Palestinians need to make more concessions for peace.<br/>Their homes, their land, and their basic freedoms are not<br/>enough. When Israel takes land militarily and then gives<br/>some back, it is making a &quot;concession&quot;. When<br/>Palestinians lose land because they cannot defend against<br/>the Israeli war machine, they are not making a concession.<br/>&mldr;I only wish Mr./Ms. Anonymous could make some concessions to both sides<br/>because this one-sided shit only confuses people on all sides.</p><p>The story of the holocaust at Auschwitz cannot be told<br/>enough, but the massacre at Deir Yassin should be<br/>forgotten.<br/>&mldr;I just have to let this one go.  I&apos;d ask my Dad why he has the initials KL<br/>on his arm even those these are not his initials.  And then there are those<br/>pesky numbers on his arm&mldr;But that would have ruined the family get together we<br/>had yesterday.</p><p>When NPR correspondents such as Linda Gradstein and Eric<br/>Weiner file reports which suggest that the Israeli<br/>government might not be granting Arab Israelis exactly the<br/>same rights as Jewish Israelis, then this only proves that<br/>the media is biased against Israel.<br/>&mldr;what it proves is the author of this rant is a coward for naming others<br/>only.</p><p>It&apos;s not good to mix religion and government; unless the<br/>religion is Judaism, in which case it&apos;s a splendid idea.<br/>&mldr;none of this has anything to do with religion to me.  And yet I am forced to<br/>respond to this sickness.  I agree with Kraig, please, a moratorium.
