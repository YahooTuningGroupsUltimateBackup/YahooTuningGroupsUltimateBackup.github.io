I<br/>infer that you do this to prove that you are correct. What if someone<br/>were to quote, on this list, from the Koran, or ancient Hebrew texts,<br/>or Buddhist writings? What makes your book the trump card? Why can&apos;t a<br/>Muslim, who believes in his version of God/Allah, be just as sure that<br/>he is as correct as you are? Or, more to the point, the *only* correct<br/>way to be?</p><p>There is no doubt you have a deep faith in your beliefs. There is no<br/>doubt that people who martyr themselves in the name of their faith<br/>also have deep beliefs. They kill people, and as your postings<br/>suggest, you would have others (as you won&apos;t be doing it yourself)<br/>kill them.</p><p>There are people, all over the world, killing in the name of God. I<br/>have to think that if God is watching, God is beyond sad about all<br/>this. And I don&apos;t have a book to back me up on that, just the deep<br/>belief in a God that is merciful, compassionate, and just. &quot;Thou shalt<br/>not kill&quot;, from the very book you quote from, seem hollow words in<br/>these days.</p><p>Jon</p></div><h3>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2006 11:30:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stephen,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You very frequently reply to comments with quotes from the Bible.
