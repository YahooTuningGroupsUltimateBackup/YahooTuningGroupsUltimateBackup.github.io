Reaching a well he descended into it, drank his fill, and came up. Then he saw a dog with its<br/>     tongue hanging out, trying to lick up mud to quench its thirst. The man saw that the dog was feeling the same thirst that he had felt so he went down to the well again and filled his shoe with water and gave the dog a drink. God forgave his sins for this action.&quot; The prophet was asked: &quot;Messenger of God, are we rewarded for kindness towards animals?&quot; He said, &quot;There is a reward for kindness to every living thing&quot;.</p><p>So... is it possible that a whole bunch of nasty stuff was added later to justify killing and nastyness? Or is the Koran just as full of self contradiction as the Bible?</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
