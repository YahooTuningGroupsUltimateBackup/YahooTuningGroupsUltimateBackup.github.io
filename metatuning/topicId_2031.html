Until now I didn&apos;t<br/>miss the WTC from the skyline but when I looked up from Park<br/>Row, I really missed that big building. And then I get to Church Street<br/>and there&apos;s a tractor hanging rolling by. As I looked South all<br/>I saw was flood lights.</p><p>* David Beardsley<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a><br/>* <a href="http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley">http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2002 7:23:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., David Beardsley &lt;db@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/2031">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/2031</a></p><p>&gt; I just took a walk out side to check out the WTC Memorial.</p><p>***They&apos;re pretty.
