It is only a question<br/>of will and investment,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;If you look to our societies, we are already<br/>registered from birth until death. Our governments know<br/>who we are and what we are. But one of the basic<br/>                                ----------------<br/>problems is the numbers of people in the world who are<br/>------------------------------------------------------<br/>not registered, who do not have a set identity, and<br/>----------------------------------------------<br/>when these people move with real or fake passports, you<br/>cannot identify them.</p><p>[Problem for who again? Note assumption that persons<br/>w/o &apos;registrations&apos; have &apos;no identity&apos;. In other words,<br/>you do not have an identity unless the government<br/>chooses to allow you to have one. Bow to the beast<br/>friends!]</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s a basic rule of management that if you want to<br/>manage something, you measure it. It&apos;s the same<br/>-----------------------------------------------<br/>with human beings and migration.<br/>-------------------------------</p><p>[manage == control]</p><p>&quot;But instead of measuring it, you have to register<br/>them.&quot;</p><p>Mr Smet said the scheme would give people dignity by<br/>             ---------------------------------------<br/>giving them an identity if their papers had been lost<br/>-----------------------<br/>or destroyed.</p><p>[standard double-speak - black is white, etc]</p><p>And he said it would allow countries to open their<br/>borders to genuine travellers or asylum seekers,<br/>because they would be able to prove the identity of any<br/>over-stayers and deport them without argument from<br/>their home country.</p><p>Mr Ruddock appeared unconvinced by the merits of the<br/>plan.</p><p>&quot;In principle we would be supportive of a system which<br/>would crack down on multiple asylum claims, but a<br/>universal identification system would be taking it too<br/>far,&quot; he said through a spokeswoman.</p></div>
