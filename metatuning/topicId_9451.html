Graham and<br/>I have had productive and friendly conversations privately, so I know<br/>it wasn&apos;t purposeful. I note that he mentioned he had been &quot;grumpy&quot;<br/>and there was a notably high-octane response of his on tuning a couple<br/>weeks ago, but we should probably just let it go, with my thanks to<br/>all for assisting in clarification.</p><p>Best,<br/>Jon</p></div>
