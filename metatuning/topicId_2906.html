Invoking<br/>&gt; both the controversial 1998 DMCA and computer crime laws,<br/>&gt; HP has threatened to sue a team of researchers who publicized<br/>&gt; a vulnerability in the company&apos;s Tru64 Unix operating system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; etc. etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please, you dumb clucks in Dee Cee, could you think before<br/>&gt; you pass laws written by your paymasters, and maybe consider<br/>&gt; the consequences?</p><p>extrememly doubtful.  in 1893 the US Supreme Court actually<br/>*legislatively* declared that the tomato is a vegetable!</p><p>this is absurd, as, botanically, the decision as to what is<br/>classified as fruit and what is classified as vegetable is<br/>based entirely on what *part* of a plant is eaten, and not<br/>on the species of plant.</p><p>a fruit is the part of a plant which surrounds or contains<br/>the seed(s), and a vegetable is any other part (root, stem,<br/>leaves).  the tomato is clearly a fruit.</p><p>but the law had a tremendous impact on the taxation of<br/>tomato farmers, which seems to have been the real reason<br/>behind the legislation.</p><p>see<br/><a href="http://www.nutrition.cornell.edu/nutriquest/070599/fruitveg.html">http://www.nutrition.cornell.edu/nutriquest/070599/fruitveg.html</a></p><p>(unfortunately, the link that that page provides to details<br/>of the court case, is now dead.)</p><p>- monz</p></div>
