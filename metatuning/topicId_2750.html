Government, the presumed protector of the public&apos;s<br/>property,<br/>has become, instead, the enabler of this plunder and theft. The media,<br/>the<br/>nation&apos;s self-professed watchdogs, are apathetic at best in sounding the</p><p>alarm about the people&apos;s loss of control over resources they have paid<br/>for<br/>or inherited from previous generations.</p><p>   As a result, corporations have found it easy to lay claim to a wide<br/>range<br/>of public resources: publicly funded medical advances, national forests,</p><p>public spaces in cities, the Internet, software innovations, the<br/>airwaves,<br/>and the DNA of animals, plants, and humans. Surprisingly, corporate<br/>appropriation, or privatization, of public resources has proceeded<br/>quietly<br/>with only sporadic public outcries against the most blatant thefts.</p><p>   One public interest activist and author, David Bollier, is making a<br/>valiant effort to change that. As Bollier argues, the abuses go<br/>unnoticed<br/>because the thefts are generally seen &quot;only in glimpses, not in<br/>panorama,<br/>when [they are] visible at all.&quot; Bollier&apos;s new book, &quot;Silent Theft: The<br/>Private Plunder of Our Common Wealth&quot; (Routledge), is a loud wake-up<br/>call<br/>for citizens interested in halting the steady exploitation and erosion<br/>of<br/>the nation&apos;s resources and values for short-term gains by the few.</p><p>   &quot;We have become a nation of eager consumers ?- and disengaged<br/>citizens -?<br/>and so are ill-equipped to perceive how our common resources are being<br/>abused,&quot; Bollier writes. He moves quickly to specifics: our tax dollars<br/>helped develop breakthrough cancer drugs, but pharmaceutical companies<br/>acquired the rights to those drugs for a song ?- and the companies now<br/>charge exorbitant prices. An archaic 1872 law gives mining companies the</p><p>lucrative right to mine valuable mineral resources on our public lands<br/>for<br/>$5 an acre -? a right the mining industry preserves through what Bollier</p><p>describes as &quot;well-deployed campaign contributions.&quot;</p><p>   Bollier is especially critical of the federal government&apos;s role in<br/>giving<br/>away its most promising drug research and development to the drug<br/>companies.<br/>&quot;It is a sweet deal for drugmakers, but an outrage for millions of<br/>American<br/>taxpayers and consumers,&quot; Bollier says. &quot;It is a scandalous fact that<br/>the<br/>fruits of risky and expensive scientific work typically do not accrue to<br/>the<br/>sponsors/investors -? the American people -? until drug companies have<br/>extracted huge mark-ups of their own. The American people pay twice,<br/>first<br/>as taxpayers, reaping a lower (or nonexistent) return on their<br/>investments,<br/>and second as consumers paying higher drug prices charged by<br/>pharmaceutical<br/>companies.&quot;</p><p>   Bollier reminds the reader that Americans own collectively one-third<br/>of<br/>the surface area of the country and billions of acres of the outer<br/>continental shelf. The resources are extensive and valuable: huge<br/>supplies<br/>of oil, coal, natural gas, uranium, copper, gold, silver, timber<br/>grasslands,<br/>water, and geothermal energy. The nation&apos;s public land also consists of<br/>vast<br/>tracts of wilderness forests, unspoiled coastlines, sweeping prairies,<br/>the<br/>Rocky Mountains, and dozens of beautiful rivers and lakes.</p><p>   &quot;As the steward of these public resources, the government&apos;s job is to</p><p>manage these lands responsibly for the long-term,&quot; Bollier argues. &quot;The<br/>sad<br/>truth is that the government stewardship of this natural wealth<br/>represents<br/>one of the great scandals of the 20th Century. While the details vary<br/>from<br/>one resource to another, the general history is one of antiquated laws,<br/>poor<br/>enforcement, slipshod administration, environmental indifference and<br/>capitulation to industry&apos;s most aggressive demands.&quot;</p><p>   Despite his vigorous criticism of the exploitation and neglect of the</p><p>public&apos;s resources -? &quot;the commons&quot; -? Bollier remains optimistic that<br/>people can be galvanized to reverse the current trend. &quot;Americans have a</p><p>long tradition of creating innovative vehicles for ensuring fair return<br/>to<br/>the American people on resources they collectively own,&quot; he writes. &quot;It<br/>is<br/>time to revive this tradition of innovation in the stewardship of public</p><p>resources and give it imaginative new incarnations in the twenty-first<br/>century.&quot;</p><p>--------------------</p><p>Ralph Nader&apos;s column appears weekly in the Bay Guardian.

Bush, who was a member of<br/>Harken&apos;s<br/>audit committee, sold the stock for about $848,000. The SEC at the time<br/>investigated for possible insider trading law violations but did not<br/>charge<br/>Bush.</p><p>   &quot;I think it would be wise for the SEC ... to reopen that<br/>investigation in<br/>order to get the full facts before the American people,&quot; said Nader, who<br/>ran<br/>for president against Bush and former Vice President Al Gore. &quot;When<br/>President Bush was asked about this by a reporter earlier this week, he<br/>brushed it aside, saying the he had been adequately vetted. That&apos;s not a</p><p>sufficient answer.&quot;</p><p>   Nader said Bush&apos;s 1990 stock sale was unethical. &quot;He engaged in very<br/>late<br/>filings with the SEC,&quot; Nader said. &quot;He sold the stock just before some<br/>very<br/>damaging news was disclosed.&quot; The White House this week blamed the late<br/>filings on a mix-up among corporate lawyers. Bush&apos;s representatives in<br/>the<br/>past had said the SEC lost the documents.</p><p>   Nader and his group Citizenworks are calling for reforms in the<br/>corporate<br/>world, including an end to off-shore tax shelters, tightening of laws<br/>governing corporations&apos; financial reporting, and jail time for those who</p><p>violate them. The group also calls for investors to group together to<br/>protect their interests from what it calls predatory and greedy<br/>management.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
