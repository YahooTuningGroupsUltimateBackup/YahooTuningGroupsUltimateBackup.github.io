Or could US air security<br/>operations have been deliberately stood down on September 11? If so,<br/>why, and on whose<br/>    authority?&quot;</p><p>    The article prompted an angry response from the US Embassy in<br/>London, which issued a statement declaring that Meacher&apos;s &quot;assertions<br/>that the US<br/>    government knowingly stood by while terrorists killed some 3,000<br/>innocents in New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia would be monstrous, and<br/>monstrously<br/>    offensive, if they came from someone serious or credible.&quot;</p><p>    For its part, major US media outlets blacked out any reference to<br/>Meacher&apos;s explosive charges.</p><p>    The claim that Meacher is not &quot;serious or credible&quot; has no<br/>foundation. He is not a back-bench maverick or a member of what the<br/>right-wing British press<br/>    likes to refer to as the &quot;loony left.&quot; On the contrary, he was the<br/>Labour Party&apos;s most experienced cabinet minister, having served in<br/>Parliament for 33 years,<br/>    holding various cabinet posts going back to the Wilson and Callaghan<br/>administrations in the 1970s. He served in Blair&apos;s cabinet as<br/>environment minister for<br/>    six years until he was removed in June amid the mounting crisis of<br/>the Labour government over the Iraq war. He played a prominent role in<br/>the negotiation<br/>    of the Kyoto accords on the environment and was long considered a<br/>contender for the position of Labour Party leader.</p><p>    That someone with these political connections charges in print that<br/>elements within the US administration knew that a terrorist attack was<br/>coming on<br/>    September 11 and allowed it to happen to further their war plans<br/>represents an extremely dangerous development for the Bush White House.<br/>He speaks not<br/>    just for himself. The thesis he advances is indicative of what is<br/>assumed and is being said behind the scenes among much wider circles<br/>within the sole major<br/>    government to have backed Washington in its invasion of Iraq.</p><p>    It is doubtless that the article was motivated by the deepening<br/>crisis of the Blair government itself over the exposure of the lies it<br/>used to promote the Iraq<br/>    war. With continuing revelations from within the government&apos;s own<br/>intelligence agencies about the fabrication of evidence against Iraq,<br/>recent polls have<br/>    shown a majority of Briton&apos;s in favor of Blair&apos;s resignation.</p><p>    The questions Meacher raises have never been answered by anyone in<br/>the US government. On the eve of the second anniversary of the September<br/>11 terrorist<br/>    attacks, the American public knows almost nothing more about what<br/>happened that day-and how it was allowed to happen-than it knew two<br/>years ago. The<br/>    Bush White House has made every effort to derail or stonewall any<br/>independent investigation into these tragic events. To this day, no one<br/>has explained how<br/>    suspected terrorists, under the surveillance of the FBI and the CIA,<br/>were allowed to enter the US, commandeer commercial aircraft and fly<br/>them unhindered<br/>    until striking their targets.</p><p>    Meacher&apos;s article pursues many of the same themes that have been<br/>raised over the past two years by the World Socialist Web Site<br/>concerning the way the<br/>    September 11 events were seized upon by the Bush government to drive<br/>forward its longstanding plans for military aggression, as well as the<br/>ample evidence<br/>    that the government was repeatedly warned about the impending<br/>attacks, yet failed to take even routine actions to counter them.</p><p>    Meacher rejects the official explanation that the successive US wars<br/>in Afghanistan and Iraq represented Washington&apos;s response to the attacks<br/>on the Pentagon<br/>    and New York City&apos;s Twin Towers, declaring, &quot;The truth may be a<br/>great deal murkier.&quot;</p><p>    He begins by citing a document issued in 2000 by the right-wing<br/>Washington think tank, the Project for a New American Century (PNAC), an<br/>outfit that<br/>    served as the Republican administration&apos;s national security<br/>establishment-in-waiting until its ideas could be implemented following<br/>the installation of Bush as<br/>    president in 2001.</p><p>    Entitled, &quot;Rebuilding America&apos;s Defenses,&quot; the central plans of this<br/>document were incorporated directly into Bush&apos;s &quot;National Security<br/>Strategy of the<br/>    United States&quot; issued in September 2001, which advanced the strategy<br/>of &quot;preventive war.&quot;</p><p>    Describing the document as a &quot;blueprint for the creation of a global<br/>Pax Americana,&quot; Meacher writes: &quot;The plan shows Bush&apos;s cabinet intended<br/>to take<br/>    military control of the Gulf region whether or not Saddam Hussein<br/>was in power. It says &apos;while the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides<br/>justification, the<br/>    need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf<br/>transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein.&quot;</p><p>    The document, he notes, includes the warning that it would be<br/>difficult to win public support for a military campaign to transform the<br/>US into &quot;tomorrow&apos;s<br/>    dominant force&quot; without &quot;some catastrophic and catalyzing event-like<br/>a new Pearl Harbor.&quot; With September 11, the administration had just such<br/>an event:<br/>    &quot;The 9/11 attacks allowed the US to press the &apos;go&apos; button for a<br/>strategy in accordance with the PNAC agenda which it would otherwise<br/>have been politically<br/>    impossible to implement.&quot;</p><p>    Having established the political motive for welcoming some form of<br/>terrorist provocation on US soil, Meacher goes on to raise substantive<br/>questions about<br/>    the official US response to the ample warnings of impending acts of<br/>terrorism as well as to the attacks themselves. He carefully documents<br/>each of his charges<br/>    with specific references to reports that appeared in the mainstream<br/>media.</p><p>    &quot;First, it is clear the US authorities did little or nothing to<br/>pre-empt the events of 9/11,&quot; writes the British Parliament member. &quot;It<br/>is known that at least 11<br/>    countries provided advance warning to the US of the 9/11 attacks.<br/>Two senior Mossad experts were sent to Washington in August 2001 to<br/>alert the CIA and<br/>    FBI to a cell of 200 terrorists said to be preparing a big operation<br/>(Daily Telegraph, September 16, 2001). The list they provided included<br/>the names of four<br/>    of the 9/11 hijackers, none of whom was arrested.&quot;</p><p>    Against the Bush administration&apos;s repeated claims that no one had<br/>ever contemplated the use of hijacked airplanes to carry out terrorist<br/>attacks, Meacher cites<br/>    1996 and 1999 intelligence reports that warned precisely of such a<br/>threat.</p><p>    He also raises the question of whether US intelligence had<br/>undisclosed connections with those alleged to have organized the<br/>hijacking, dating back to the war<br/>    against the Soviet-backed regime in Afghanistan. &quot;Fifteen of the<br/>9/11 hijackers obtained their visas in Saudi Arabia,&quot; Meacher writes.<br/>&quot;Michael Springman,<br/>    the former head of the American visa bureau in Jeddah, has stated<br/>that since 1987 the CIA has been illicitly issuing visas to unqualified<br/>applicants from the<br/>    Middle East and bringing them to the US for training in terrorism<br/>for the Afghan war in conjunction with Bin Laden (BBC, November 6,<br/>2001). It seems<br/>    this operation continued after the Afghan war for other purposes. It<br/>is also reported that five of the hijackers received training at secure<br/>US military<br/>    installations in the 1990s (Newsweek, September 15, 2001).&quot;</p><p>    The British Labourite points to the well-known decision of the FBI<br/>in Washington to suppress an investigation into Zacarias Moussaoui (now<br/>dubbed the 20th<br/>    hijacker by US prosecutors) despite a warning from a local agent<br/>that he could be part of a plot to crash a plane into the Twin Towers.</p><p>    Meacher goes on to review the unexplained delay in US air security<br/>responding to the hijackings: &quot;The first hijacking was suspected not<br/>later than 8:20 a.m.,<br/>    and the last hijacked aircraft crashed in Pennsylvania at 10:06<br/>a.m.,&quot; he writes. &quot;Not a single fighter plane was scrambled to<br/>investigate from the US Andrews<br/>    Air Force Base, just 10 miles from Washington DC, until after the<br/>third plane had hit the Pentagon at 9:38 a.m. Why not? There were<br/>standard FAA intercept<br/>    procedures for hijacked aircraft before 9/11. Between September 2000<br/>and June 2001 the US military launched fighter aircraft on 67 occasions<br/>to chase<br/>    suspicious aircraft (AP, Aug. 13, 2002). It is a US legal<br/>requirement that once an aircraft has moved significantly off its flight<br/>plan, fighter planes are sent up<br/>    to investigate.&quot;</p><p>    All of which leads Meacher to pose his question: who ordered the US<br/>national security apparatus to &quot;stand down&quot;?</p><p>    He further points to extensive evidence of the relative US<br/>indifference to pursuing Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of the<br/>September 11 attacks,<br/>    quoting one US official as saying that his capture could result in a<br/>&quot;premature collapse of our international effort.&quot;</p><p>    Meacher argues that Washington&apos;s &quot;&apos;war on terrorism&apos; is being used<br/>largely as bogus cover for achieving wider US strategic geopolitical<br/>objectives.&quot;</p><p>    &quot;In fact, 9/11 offered an extremely convenient pretext to put the<br/>PNAC plan into action,&quot; he writes. &quot;The evidence is quite clear that<br/>plans for military action<br/>    against Afghanistan and Iraq were in hand well before 9/11.&quot; He<br/>points to a September 18, 2001 BBC report that US officials warned<br/>Pakistan in July<br/>    2001-two months before the terrorist attacks-that US &quot;military<br/>action against Afghanistan would go ahead by the middle of October.&quot;</p><p>    Meacher comments: &quot;Given this background, it is not surprising that<br/>some have seen the US failure to avert the 9/11 attacks as creating an<br/>invaluable pretext<br/>    for attacking Afghanistan, in a war that had clearly already been<br/>well planned in advance.&quot; He suggests that there is a precedent for the<br/>Bush administration&apos;s<br/>    inaction on September 11 in the similar failure of President<br/>Roosevelt to heed warnings of an impending Japanese attack on Pearl<br/>Harbor, an event that fueled<br/>    sufficient public outrage to achieve his administration&apos;s goal of<br/>bringing the US into the Second World War.</p><p>    The former environment minister argues that motivation for both the<br/>Afghanistan and Iraq wars was to seize control of strategic sources of<br/>oil and natural gas<br/>    in both the Caspian and Persian Gulf regions.</p><p>    Meacher concludes: &quot;The conclusion of all this analysis must surely<br/>be that the &apos;global war on terrorism&apos; has the hallmarks of a political<br/>myth propagated to<br/>    pave the way for a wholly different agenda-the US goal of world<br/>hegemony, built around securing by force command over the oil supplies<br/>required to drive<br/>    the whole project. Is this myth and junior participation in this<br/>project really a proper aspiration for British foreign policy?&quot;</p><p>    None of the information provided by Meacher is new; it has merely<br/>been concealed from the broad public. Increasingly bitter divisions<br/>within ruling circles,<br/>    both in the US and Britain, have brought it to the surface.</p><p>    The former cabinet minister speaks for sections of the British<br/>ruling elite who support distancing London&apos;s policy from that of the<br/>Bush administration. Their<br/>    hand has been considerably strengthened by the mounting catastrophe<br/>confronting the US military occupation of Iraq as well as the deep<br/>crisis facing Blair,<br/>    the principal proponent of unconditional British support for US<br/>strategic aims.</p><p>    The unraveling of the Blair government&apos;s fabrication of evidence<br/>about alleged Iraqi weapons of mass destruction has opened a Pandora&apos;s<br/>box for the Bush<br/>    administration. The exposure of one set of lies has opened the door<br/>to renewed questions about all of the conspiracies and provocations<br/>carried out by the<br/>    gang of criminals that have seized control of the White House.</p><p>    The Bush administration has exploited the tragedy of September 11 as<br/>the justification for launching two wars in the space of a year and a<br/>half and for<br/>    carrying out far-reaching attacks on both the democratic rights and<br/>social conditions of the American people. At the same time it has acted<br/>ruthlessly to<br/>    suppress any serious investigation into the 9/11 attacks. As the<br/>Meacher article indicates, the administration&apos;s ability to continue this<br/>cover-up is being fatally<br/>    undermined by its own growing political crisis.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
