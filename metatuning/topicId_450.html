I was deeply honored by their<br/>participation in<br/>recording seven of my early compositions for gamelan. Sukamso assembled the<br/>group and played kendhang, Joko Purwanto supervised the recording. (I&apos;ll provide<br/>a complete list of musicians and pieces to anyone who is interested.)</p><p>terus dan terus</p><p>jody diamond</p></div>
