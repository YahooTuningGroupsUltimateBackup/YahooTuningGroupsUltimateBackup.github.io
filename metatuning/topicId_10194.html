With luck, I&apos;ll be a<br/>Dad before Christmas (the Solstice is actually our due date).<br/>I&apos;ve dropped off Tuning too, but I&apos;m sticking around on MMM,<br/>tuning-math, and SpecMus, and I hope to participate a bit on<br/>the Tonescape group and on Keenan Pepper&apos;s new Wikiproject...</p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/8lmrn?__TuningWikiProject">http://tinyurl.com/8lmrn?__TuningWikiProject</a></p><p>Rather than try to reply to the hanging thread(s), I&apos;ll<br/>leave you with a final thought: Love is revolutionary.</p><p>I read an article on this somewhere recently.  The author<br/>said that civilization is to the point where simply loving<br/>is an act of revolution.</p><p>I agree, except it must have always been so.  While we might<br/>like it if there were more love in the world, I don&apos;t know<br/>that this means we&apos;re in bad shape, historically speaking.</p><p>And in fact all actions are actions of revolution, practical<br/>statements of the place you want to be -- this is the core<br/>idea behind my criticism of politics as it is usually<br/>practiced.</p><p>Having a baby is revolutionary.  Especially, in the West,<br/>if the Mom is under 30.  In the West, having a baby outside<br/>of a hospital is revolutionary.  Check out the work of<br/>Michel Odent, who correctly frames the issue &quot;in terms of<br/>civilization&quot;.</p><p>Whatever school of political thought we&apos;re partial to,<br/>whether we want footpaths or superhighways, love speaks the<br/>same message to us, by virtue of our being human.  Even<br/>nihilists, I bet.  (Just as serialists can recognize JI?)</p><p>So here&apos;s to everybody who loves anybody.</p><p>-Carl<br/><a href="http://lumma.org/microwave">http://lumma.org/microwave</a></p></div><h3>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>11/25/2005 11:33:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>CONTGRATULATIONS!!!

Why, it seems like just yesterday you<br/>married the lovely mum! :) I like the spelling of the subject line,<br/>and am in complete agreement on the subject of love. More, more, more,<br/>all the time. It is truly the one thing that can&apos;t hurt (except for<br/>achy-breaky hearts).</p><p>My very best to you and your wife, and we&apos;ll look forward to the new<br/>person making their place in this world.
