With unseemly regularity, they<br/>take credit for all Democratic<br/>victories as having been rooted in their philosophy of<br/>turn-your-back-on-organized labor and open-your-pockets-to-corporations<br/>(who fund the DLC, incidentally). All Democratic<br/>defeats are explained as owing to losing candidates being too &quot;left&quot; or<br/>too &quot;populist.&quot;</p><p>The DLC brags about one of their own-- Bill Clinton-- developing the<br/>message that brought the Democrats the White House in 1992, after the<br/>disastrous failed and supposedly<br/>ultra-liberal candidacies of Walter Mondale in 1984 and Michael Dukakis<br/>in 1988. Clinton insiders will tell you that Ross Perot (and his 19<br/>million voters) was more responsible<br/>for beating President George H. W. Bush than the DLC strategy.</p><p>So what is the explanation when two of their very own, Gore and<br/>Lieberman, lost what should have been a landslide election in 2000? Soon<br/>after the election was stolen by<br/>the Bushites and the Supreme Court, From&apos;s group gathered to post-mortem<br/>the reasons why Gore lost (though he won) and concluded it was because<br/>he chanted populism<br/>(&quot;I will represent the people, not the powerful&quot;). A few months later,<br/>Lieberman agreed with From, saying he would not have campaigned with<br/>words that criticized industries like<br/>the oil, insurance, drug and HMO barons. (To his credit, From has not<br/>blamed the Greens.)</p><p>But Gore won the election-- both the popular and, as subsequent reviews<br/>documented, the electoral vote in Florida as well. (See Jeffrey Toobin&apos;s<br/>book &quot;Too Close to Call.&quot;)<br/>Instead of going after the still-operating perpetrators of this theft in<br/>Florida and pushing for national electoral reform that not only<br/>accurately counts all the votes but eliminates<br/>the disenfranchisement of citizens from the voting rolls, the DLC<br/>continues its ideological tautologies.</p><p>Observers are still waiting for the DLC to explain how, with Democratic<br/>candidates espousing its protective imitation of Republicanism, the<br/>Party could lose more governorships,<br/>more state legislatures and both the U.S. House and Senate. Overall, it<br/>has been downhill since the DLC drove the Party into groveling<br/>haplessness beneath corporate<br/>lobbies and their corrupting campaign contributions.</p><p>As the New Republic, a fan of the DLC, reported, the Party deliberately<br/>chose conservative Democratic challengers to win back the House in 1998<br/>and 2000 only to have them<br/>go down in defeat. DLC-type Democratic Senate incumbents went down to<br/>defeat in 2002, plaintively expressing their support for George W.<br/>Bush&apos;s war mongering and<br/>pro-super wealthy tax policies.</p><p>To the DLC mind, Democrats are catering to &quot;special interests&quot; when they<br/>stand up for trade unions, regulatory consumer-investor protections, a<br/>pre- emptive peace policy<br/>overseas, pruning the bloated military budget now devouring fully half<br/>of the federal government&apos;s entire discretionary expenditures, defending<br/>Social Security from Wall Street<br/>schemes, and pressing for universal health care coverage.</p><p>So right-wing is the DLC, mounted imperiously on their sagging Party,<br/>that even opposing Bush&apos;s tax cuts for the wealthy, that cause huge<br/>federal deficits and program cuts in<br/>necessities such as health, education, environmental protection and<br/>children well-being, is considered ultra-liberal and contrary to winning<br/>campaigns.</p><p>&quot;Special interests&quot; to the DLC means defending the rights of African-<br/>Americans, Hispanics, blue-collar workers, and securing the full day in<br/>court for wrongfully injured<br/>Americans. Being serious about consumer justice and environmental<br/>protection also raises DLC&apos;s eyebrows.</p><p>It is hard to discern how much is left for the Democratic Party&apos;s raison<br/>d&apos;etre when these activities are excluded.</p><p>In 1995, Al From emerged from a closed-door meeting with Silicon Valley<br/>executives and announced his support for their restrictive legislation,<br/>which passed and made it<br/>harder for defrauded investors to hold the responsible outfits<br/>accountable. Al &gt;From was on another mission that day- raising money<br/>from these same computer industry<br/>moguls.</p><p>Small wonder that the DLC is not exactly hard on the ensuing corporate<br/>crime wave that has looted or drained trillions of dollars from millions<br/>of investors and pensions.</p><p>So far right is the corporatist DLC that it believes that the Party can<br/>move toward Republican positions and still maintain its voting base<br/>among labor and minorities because<br/>they have nowhere else to go. Maybe that is one reason so many of these<br/>voters are staying home.</p><p>Liberal Republican Senators in the Seventies, such as Jacob Javits (New<br/>York) and Chuck Percy (Illinois), would now be considered on the left<br/>wing of the DLC-dominated<br/>Democratic Party.</p><p>Besides, what does the Democratic Party win if it loses its historic<br/>principles as the Party of working people and the downtrodden? Nothing<br/>more than the right to take marching<br/>orders from its corporate paymasters.</p><p>Ralph Nader is America&acirc;s leading consumer advocate.
