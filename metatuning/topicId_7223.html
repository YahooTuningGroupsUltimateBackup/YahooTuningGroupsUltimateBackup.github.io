I mean,  AFAIK,  Jackson was the main leader responsible<br/>for wiping out the Native Americans.  If you want a comparison to Hitler,<br/>that&apos;s it. . (in fact,  I think Hitler studies Jackson&apos;s methods).</p><p>But of course,  it&apos;s hard to compare. .  because Presidents are more<br/>restricted in the &quot;evil&quot; that they can do now (believe it or not).  I<br/>mean,  even the invasion of Iraq,  horrific as it&apos;s been,  think of what<br/>it would have been like with 1800&apos;s moral standards:  we probably just<br/>would have nuked them (given the technology),  and the word &quot;Empire&quot;,  I<br/>believe was uttered proudly by leaders well into the 20th-century.  Even<br/>the Bush people at least &quot;pretend&quot; they&apos;re not interested in that.  (which<br/>means they know that as far as the general public is concerned, it&apos;s now a<br/>dirty word. .  .something that wasn&apos;t true in the 1800&apos;s)  And<br/>they certainly didn&apos;t have any notion of trying to avoid civilian<br/>casualties,  with &quot;laser-guided munitions&quot; and what not.</p><p>So Bush is probably better than other &quot;worst&quot; Presidents,  simply because<br/>he&apos;s not allowed to be as bad,  even with all of the massive<br/>corruption, lying,  imperial thinking, and so on that goes on.</p><p>Again, just imagine what things would have been like with a Bush-like guy<br/>in the 1800&apos;s---not that things aren&apos;t bad now,  and not that we shouldn&apos;t<br/>be fighting them now  (far from that !)---but it&apos;s a testament,  certainly<br/>not to Bush and his crew,  but to the centuries of hard-fought social and<br/>political struggle that put laws into place and raised public awareness<br/>such that there are some things that Bush and crew still (though for how<br/>long?) can&apos;t get away with.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/12/2004 5:00:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Chris and Carl,</p><p>(Carl, thanks for posting that article about Jackson.)</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey &lt;chris@m...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think the comparison to Jackson is apt,</p><p>one might think so, because the electoral shenanigans<br/>seem comparable -- but they&apos;re not.</p><p>Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, et al, ***STOLE*** the 2000 election.</p><p>please read that again.</p><p>Bush did *not* win the popular vote in that election<br/>(Gore did), and the only reason Bush won the electoral<br/>votes he needed in Florida was because he and his cronies<br/>BROKE THE LAW by preventing thousands of legally<br/>registered Florida voters from voting, and also by<br/>counting duplicate absentee ballots twice.</p><p>once all the votes were finally counted, long after the<br/>Supreme Court invalidated the process and installed<br/>Bush as &quot;President&quot;, it was clear that Gore won the<br/>popular vote in the entire country, but he did *not*<br/>win Florida, whose 25 electoral votes put Bush ahead<br/>of Gore by 5 electoral votes ... but there were some<br/>very ugly tricks W and his buddies pulled to successfully<br/>prevent many Florida democrats from voting.<br/>(more on that below ... )</p><p>for the states which Gore won by more than 1% of<br/>the popular vote (ranked according to ratio of<br/>Gore/Bush votes: DC, RI, MA, NY, HI, CT, MD, NJ,<br/>DE, CA, IL, VT, WA, ME, MI, PA, MN), Gore won<br/>236 electoral votes.</p><p>for the states which Bush won by more than 1% of<br/>the popular vote (ranked according to ratio of<br/>Bush/Gore votes: UT, WY, ID, AK, NE, ND, MT, SD,<br/>OK, TX, KS, MS, SC, IN, KY, AL, NC, GA, CO, VA, LA,<br/>AZ, WV, AR, TN, NV, OH, MO, NH), Bush won 246<br/>electoral votes.</p><p>the &quot;close&quot; states which Gore won, by less than<br/>0.5% of the popular vote (OR, IA, WI, NM, winning by<br/>6765, 4144, 5708, and 366 actual votes, respectively),<br/>earned Gore another 30 electoral votes, putting his<br/>total at 266.</p><p>the only other &quot;close&quot; state was Florida, which<br/>Bush ultimately won by only 537 votes -- which is<br/>LESS THAN 1/100 OF A PERCENT OF FLORIDA VOTES CAST<br/>-- and which gave Bush the 25 electoral votes he<br/>needed to beat Gore.</p><p>all the data is available at the Federal Election Commission&apos;s<br/>official government webpage:</p><p><a href="http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2000presgeresults.htm">http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2000presgeresults.htm</a></p><p>yes, most of this does sound a lot like Jackson ... but<br/>as i said, the Bush campaign ILLEGALLY managed to remove<br/>voters from the rolls.  details below.</p><p>&gt; So Bush is probably better than other &quot;worst&quot; Presidents,<br/>&gt; simply because he&apos;s not allowed to be as bad,  even with<br/>&gt; all of the massive corruption, lying,  imperial thinking,<br/>&gt; and so on that goes on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, just imagine what things would have been like with<br/>&gt; a Bush-like guy in the 1800&apos;s---not that things aren&apos;t bad<br/>&gt; now,  and not that we shouldn&apos;t be fighting them now  (far<br/>&gt; from that !)---but it&apos;s a testament,  certainly not to Bush<br/>&gt; and his crew,  but to the centuries of hard-fought social<br/>&gt; and political struggle that put laws into place and raised<br/>&gt; public awareness such that there are some things that Bush<br/>&gt; and crew still (though for how long?) can&apos;t get away with.</p><p>Chris, you say truthful things here ... but do you really<br/>read the news?  watching TV news (even CNN) doesn&apos;t count.</p><p>from the first webpage i cite below: &quot;In Florida, felons<br/>are banned for life from voting unless granted clemency.&quot;</p><p>The Bush gang took advantage of the fact that Jeb Bush was<br/>governor of Florida, which made it easier to abuse (note:<br/>i did not say &quot;exploit&quot;) that law -- thousands of Floridians<br/>who were legally registered to vote had been removed from<br/>the polls *without their prior knowledge* because they<br/>shared a name or birthday with a convicted felon.  they<br/>didn&apos;t find out until they showed up at the polling place<br/>to vote and were turned away.</p><p>and the second website i cite below notes that voting<br/>irrelugarities were documented in about a dozen other<br/>states besides Florida.</p><p>the US 2000 Presidential &quot;election&quot; was nothing other than<br/>a bloodless coup d&apos;etat.</p><p><a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0527-03.htm">http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0527-03.htm</a></p><p><a href="http://www.naacp.org/news/archives/2000/florida_irregularities.shtml">http://www.naacp.org/news/archives/2000/florida_irregularities.shtml</a></p><p>i also highly recommend the first chapter of Michael Moore&apos;s<br/>book _Stupid White Men_, which documents the sordid tale<br/>in detail.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/12/2004 5:14:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, et al, ***STOLE*** the 2000 election.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for the states which Gore won by more than 1% of<br/>&gt; the popular vote (ranked according to ratio of<br/>&gt; Gore/Bush votes: DC, RI, MA, NY, HI, CT, MD, NJ,<br/>&gt; DE, CA, IL, VT, WA, ME, MI, PA, MN), Gore won<br/>&gt; 236 electoral votes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for the states which Bush won by more than 1% of<br/>&gt; the popular vote (ranked according to ratio of<br/>&gt; Bush/Gore votes: UT, WY, ID, AK, NE, ND, MT, SD,<br/>&gt; OK, TX, KS, MS, SC, IN, KY, AL, NC, GA, CO, VA, LA,<br/>&gt; AZ, WV, AR, TN, NV, OH, MO, NH), Bush won 246<br/>&gt; electoral votes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the &quot;close&quot; states which Gore won, by less than<br/>&gt; 0.5% of the popular vote (OR, IA, WI, NM, winning by<br/>&gt; 6765, 4144, 5708, and 366 actual votes, respectively),<br/>&gt; earned Gore another 30 electoral votes, putting his<br/>&gt; total at 266.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the only other &quot;close&quot; state was Florida, which<br/>&gt; Bush ultimately won by only 537 votes -- which is<br/>&gt; LESS THAN 1/100 OF A PERCENT OF FLORIDA VOTES CAST<br/>&gt; -- and which gave Bush the 25 electoral votes he<br/>&gt; needed to beat Gore.</p><p>all this and more can be seen on graphs in a nice<br/>Excel spreadsheet i made from the official government<br/>data -- it&apos;s in the &quot;monz&quot; folder in the &quot;files&quot;<br/>section of this list:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/files/monz/2">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/files/monz/2</a><br/>000-presidential-election.xls</p><p>or</p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2nscc">http://tinyurl.com/2nscc</a></p><p>-monz</p></div>
