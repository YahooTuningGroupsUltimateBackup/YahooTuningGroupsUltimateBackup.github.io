I have repeatedly asked him to post this information about<br/>the break-in to the list if they are true and get the police involved. First<br/>it was a mysterious Chinaman who may have broke in, then it was mclaren<br/>himself who allegedly broke into his account, and finally he is now<br/>suggesting that I am the one who did it. He claims the police have<br/>investigated his computer and his ISPs have looked into his accounts.</p><p>In case anyone is unclear -- I did not break into his computer and have no<br/>trouble publically stating this.</p><p>We are now talking about serious crimes and I want to publically state that<br/>I WELCOME the involvement of the FBI, if either this guy or mclaren (the two<br/>parties directly involved) want to pursue it to find out what the truth is.</p><p>There are logs of this stuff at his ISP, at Brian&apos;s ISP, at Yahoo, and other<br/>places along the way that may all be inspected by the FBI and I am sure they<br/>will reveal the truth.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2001 9:21:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeff!<br/>    Listen , i find it unfair to put all these &quot;impostors &apos; in the same<br/>category. Frankly outside of one, they added more spice to the list than harm<br/>to my memory. I think anonymously is kinda a ridiculous request at this point.<br/>Since someone else has already prevented that from happening. It seems others<br/>were so quick to point out how the language was not McLaren. It seem it is<br/>&quot;obvious to any one with intelligence (:))&quot; that the language adds up even less<br/>being the other party. Innocent till proven guilty.</p><p>&quot;X. J.
