J. Scott&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; OK, was reviewing once again the 2000 PDR on Zoloft<br/>&gt; which is manufactured by Pfizer. Zoloft is a selective<br/>&gt; serotonin reuptake inhibitor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Among its *observed* side effects:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; agitation, anxiety, insomnia, nervousness, depression,<br/>&gt; amnesia, paroniria,teeth-grinding, emotional lability,<br/>&gt; apathy, abnormal dreams, euphoria, paranoid reaction,<br/>&gt; hallucination, aggresive reaction, aggravated<br/>&gt; depression, psychotic delusions, suicide ideation,<br/>&gt; somnabulism, illusion<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So what are we looking at here?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A highly intelligent and creative woman grows up, goes<br/>&gt; to school, gets a degree, doing well academically and<br/>&gt; becomes a nurse. Her career is exemplary. She is active<br/>&gt; in the community doing volunteer work. She has no<br/>&gt; criminal record, not even a single speeding or parking<br/>&gt; infraction. She marries a NASA engineer, becomes<br/>&gt; pregnant and decides to stay home with her child. This<br/>&gt; involves giving up her career and greatly reducing her<br/>&gt; social contact with others. It is common under such a<br/>&gt; move to experience some depression, which she does. She<br/>&gt; speaks to her doctor about it and rather than seeing it<br/>&gt; as normal, he decides she has post-partum depression<br/>&gt; and should be put on 125 mg of Zoloft. She immediately<br/>&gt; begins to display several known side-effects of Zoloft,<br/>&gt; including:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; anxiety<br/>&gt; nervousness<br/>&gt; depression<br/>&gt; apathy<br/>&gt; abnormal dreams<br/>&gt; euphoria<br/>&gt; paranoid reaction<br/>&gt; hallucination<br/>&gt; aggravated depression<br/>&gt; psychotic delusions<br/>&gt; suicide ideation<br/>&gt; illusion<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At this point, ANY competant doctor would immediately<br/>&gt; recognize that she is having severe reactions to<br/>&gt; Zoloft, which is not even surprising or unusual.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that these<br/>&gt; sypmtoms were caused by the Zoloft. In fact, Andrea<br/>&gt; herself said that the Zoloft made her feel crazy and<br/>&gt; she did not want to take them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The competant doctor should then switch her to another<br/>&gt; drug, or prescribe psychotherapy, diet change, or<br/>&gt; social activity instead of the drugs, while keeping her<br/>&gt; monitored closely for the 14 days it takes the Zoloft<br/>&gt; to get out of her system (it is a very slow drug to get<br/>&gt; out -- read the PDR for details.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But therapy is expensive and does not profit the<br/>&gt; pharmaceutical companies. Insurance companies would<br/>&gt; much rather pay for drugs than therapy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For whatever reason, the doctors decide to treat her<br/>&gt; side-effects. The most serious side effects of the<br/>&gt; Zoloft are psychotic delusions. The appropriate<br/>&gt; treatment is to stop the Zoloft. Instead, the doctors<br/>&gt; made a conscious decision to put here on the powerful<br/>&gt; anti-psychotic drug Haldol. Haldol works -- whether you<br/>&gt; are naturally psychotic, or merely psychotic as a<br/>&gt; common side effect of taking antidepressants, it stops<br/>&gt; the insanity. But at a cost -- more side effects.<br/>&gt; Feeling detached from your body, unable to function,<br/>&gt; etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At this point, having made a conscious and deliberate<br/>&gt; decision to treat the Zoloft psychosis side-effect with<br/>&gt; drugs, the doctor should have made every effort to keep<br/>&gt; a close eye on her and to inform her family that the<br/>&gt; psychosis they were treating was being caused by the<br/>&gt; Zoloft and so that under no circumstances should she<br/>&gt; stop taking the Haldol while still taking the Zoloft.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The doctor did not do this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As her symptoms progressed, time and time again she was<br/>&gt; evaluated by psychiatrists who diagnosed her,<br/>&gt; accurately as psychotic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Finally she went to see Dr. Mohammed Saeed. He told her<br/>&gt; to stop taking the anti-psychotic Haldol, but that it<br/>&gt; was OK to keep taking the Zoloft.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A short time after that, she began to believe she must<br/>&gt; kill her children herself to save their souls and then<br/>&gt; she must be executed herself because she had led them<br/>&gt; astray, being deranged about a verse in the Gospel of<br/>&gt; Luke. She then drowned all five of her children in the<br/>&gt; bathtub, which she believed at the time to be the<br/>&gt; morally correct thing to do, and then turned herself<br/>&gt; into the police with the specific desire that she be<br/>&gt; executed because it was &apos;better that she be killed that<br/>&gt; a single one of her little ones be led astray&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My conclusion:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dr. Mohammed Saeed should be convicted of negligent<br/>&gt; homicide and sentenced to life in prison.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pfizer Corporation, manufacturer of Zoloft, should be<br/>&gt; immediately dismantled and its board of directors sent<br/>&gt; to prison.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Andrea Yates should be taken off Zoloft. If she returns<br/>&gt; to sanity, she should be released.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would be justice.
