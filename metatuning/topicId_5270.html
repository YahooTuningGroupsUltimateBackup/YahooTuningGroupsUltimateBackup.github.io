Bush Our King?<br/>     He Can Designate Any of Us an Enemy Combatant<br/>     By Nat Hentoff<br/>     <a href="http://VillageVoice.com">VillageVoice.com</a></p><p>     Friday 25 July 2003</p><p>     Courts have no higher duty than protection of the individual<br/>freedoms<br/>guaranteed by our Constitution. This is especially true in time of war,<br/>when<br/>our carefully crafted system of checks and balances must accommodate the</p><p>vital needs of national security while guarding the liberties the<br/>Constitution promises all citizens. -- Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals<br/>judge<br/>Diana Gribbon Motz, dissenting, Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, July 9.</p><p>     Some of the most glorious illuminations of the Bill of Rights in<br/>American history have been contained in Supreme Court dissents by, among</p><p>others, Louis Brandeis, William Brennan, Hugo Black, and Thurgood<br/>Marshall.<br/>Equal to those was the stinging dissent by judge Diana Gribbon Motz when<br/>the<br/>Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals (8 to 4) gave George W. Bush a fearsome<br/>power that can be found nowhere in the Constitution--the sole authority<br/>to<br/>imprison an American citizen indefinitely without charges or access to a</p><p>lawyer.</p><p>     This case is now on appeal to the Supreme Court, which will<br/>determine<br/>whether this president--or his successors until the end of the war on<br/>terrorism--can subvert the Bill of Rights to the peril of all of us.</p><p>     Judge Motz began her dissent--which got only a couple of lines in<br/>the<br/>brief coverage of the case in scattered media reporting--by stating<br/>plainly<br/>what the Bush administration has done to scuttle the Bill of Rights:</p><p>     &quot;For more than a year, a United States citizen, Yaser Esam Hamdi,<br/>has<br/>been labeled an enemy combatant and held in solitary confinement in a<br/>Norfolk, Virginia, naval brig. He has not been charged with a crime, let</p><p>alone convicted of one. The Executive [the president] will not state<br/>when,<br/>if ever, he will be released. Nor has the Executive allowed Hamdi to<br/>appear<br/>in court, consult with counsel, or communicate in any way with the<br/>outside<br/>world.&quot;</p><p>     I have not seen what I am about to quote from her dissent anywhere<br/>in<br/>the media. You might want to send what follows to your member of<br/>Congress<br/>and senator. Judge Motz said accusingly:</p><p>     &quot;I fear that [this court] may also have opened the door to the<br/>indefinite detention, without access to a lawyer or the courts, of any<br/>American citizen, even one captured on American soil, who the Executive<br/>designates an &apos;enemy combatant,&apos; as long as the Executive asserts that<br/>the<br/>area in which the citizen was detained was an &apos;active combat zone,&apos; and<br/>the<br/>detainee, deprived of access to the courts and counsel, cannot dispute<br/>this<br/>fact.&quot; (Emphasis added).</p><p>     As I have detailed in two previous columns (&quot;A Citizen Shorn of All</p><p>Rights,&quot; Voice, January 1-7, 2003, and &quot;Liberty&apos;s Court of Last Resort,&quot;</p><p>Voice, January 29-February 4, 2003), Hamdi was taken into custody by the</p><p>Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, and then declared an &quot;enemy combatant&quot;<br/>by<br/>order of George W. Bush on the flimsiest of &quot;evidence&quot; that he had been<br/>a<br/>soldier of the Taliban--an accusation that Hamdi has not been able to<br/>rebut<br/>in a court of alleged law.</p><p>     Judge Motz is not engaging in scare tactics when she says that with<br/>the<br/>president having assumed the powers of an absolute monarch, in this kind<br/>of<br/>case, any American citizen can be hauled off an American street and<br/>stripped<br/>of all his or her rights. On June 5, Attorney General John Ashcroft<br/>unequivocally told the House Judiciary Committee that the streets of<br/>America<br/>are now &quot;a war zone.&quot;</p><p>     Furthermore, The Washington Post--in a July 13, 2002, lead<br/>editorial, a<br/>year before the Motz Fourth Circuit dissent--warned of the increasing<br/>tendency of the courts to defer to the dangerously overreaching<br/>executive<br/>branch:</p><p>     &quot;FBI Director Robert Mueller has said that a sizable number of<br/>people<br/>in this country are associated with terrorist groups, yet have so far<br/>done<br/>nothing wrong [so] there is therefore no basis to indict them. How many<br/>of<br/>them, one wonders, might the government [by bypassing the courts] hold<br/>as<br/>enemy combatants? And how many of them would later turn out to be<br/>something<br/>else entirely?&quot;</p><p>     But how much later would these innocent citizens--locked away until<br/>the<br/>war on terrorism is over--be let out?</p><p>     This is an unprecedentedly serious assault, folks, on the core of<br/>our<br/>system of justice. As Judge Motz said in her passionate dissent, &quot;[This<br/>court&apos;s] decision marks the first time in our history that a federal<br/>court<br/>has approved the elimination of protections afforded a citizen by the<br/>Constitution solely on the basis of the Executive&apos;s designation of that<br/>citizen as an enemy combatant, without testing the accuracy of the<br/>designation. Neither the Constitution nor controlling precedent<br/>sanctions<br/>this holding.&quot; (Emphasis added).</p><p>     As for the government&apos;s &quot;evidence&quot; that Hamdi is an enemy<br/>combatant,<br/>Judge Motz emphasizes that all the Defense Department offered is a<br/>two-page,<br/>nine-paragraph statement by Michael Mobbs, a special adviser for policy<br/>in<br/>the Defense Department. The buck stops with Donald Rumsfeld.</p><p>     As Judge Motz points out, the majority of the Fourth Circuit, in<br/>its<br/>&quot;breathtaking holding&quot; relying on the Mobbs declaration, ruled that it<br/>is<br/>&quot;undisputed&quot; that Hamdi was captured in a zone of active combat. This,<br/>she<br/>charges, is &quot;pure hearsay . . . a thin reed on which to rest abrogation<br/>of<br/>constitutional rights, and one that collapses entirely upon examination.<br/>For<br/>Hamdi has never been given the opportunity to dispute any facts.&quot;</p><p>     Before this case reached the Fourth Circuit, it was heard in<br/>Federal<br/>District Court--with Hamdi unable to be present or to communicate at all</p><p>with his public defender, Frank Dunham, who therefore could not contest<br/>the<br/>Mobbs declaration. Nevertheless, Judge Robert Doumar, a Reagan<br/>appointee,<br/>scathingly demolished the government&apos;s &quot;evidence.&quot;</p><p>     &quot;A close inspection of the [Mobbs] declaration reveals that [it]<br/>never<br/>claims that Hamdi was fighting for the Taliban, nor that he was a member<br/>of<br/>the Taliban. . . . Is there anything in the Mobbs declaration that says<br/>Hamdi ever fired a weapon?&quot; (Emphasis added.)</p><p>     In the January 9 New York Times, Elisa Massimino of the Lawyers<br/>Committee for Human Rights exposed an earlier decision by a panel of the</p><p>Fourth Circuit to bow to Bush and to continue the stripping of Hamdi&apos;s<br/>citizen&apos;s rights. &quot;[The Fourth Circuit] seems to be saying that it has<br/>no<br/>role whatsoever in overseeing the administration&apos;s conduct of the war on</p><p>terrorism . . . the beginning and end of which is left solely to the<br/>president&apos;s discretion.&quot;</p><p>     Now, the full Fourth Circuit bench has handed George W. Bush the<br/>crown<br/>that George Washington disdained. What if the Supreme Court agrees? Bush</p><p>will be King George IV.</p><p>***<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
