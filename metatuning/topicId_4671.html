Not since Sabra<br/>and Chatila had I seen the innocent slaughtered like this. The Lebanese<br/>refugee women<br/>            and children and men lay in heaps, their hands or arms or<br/>legs missing, beheaded or disembowelled. There were well over a hundred<br/>of them. A baby<br/>            lay without a head. The Israeli shells had scythed through<br/>them as they lay in the United Nations shelter, believing that they were<br/>safe under the<br/>            world&apos;s protection. Like the Muslims of Srebrenica, the<br/>Muslims of Qana were wrong.</p><p>            In front of a burning building of the UN&apos;s Fijian battalion<br/>headquarters, a girl held a corpse in her arms, the body of a grey-<br/>haired man whose eyes<br/>            were staring at her, and she rocked the corpse back and<br/>forth in her arms, keening and weeping and crying the same words over<br/>and over: &quot;My father,<br/>            my father.&quot; A Fijian UN soldier stood amid a sea of bodies<br/>and, without saying a word, held aloft the body of a headless child.</p><p>            &quot;The Israelis have just told us they&apos;ll stop shelling the<br/>area,&quot; a UN soldier said, shaking with anger. &quot;Are we supposed to thank<br/>them?&quot; In the remains<br/>            of a burning building - the conference room of the Fijian UN<br/>headquarters - a pile of corpses was burning. The roof had crashed in<br/>flames onto their<br/>            bodies, cremating them in front of my eyes. When I walked<br/>towards them, I slipped on a human hand...</p><p>            Israel&apos;s slaughter of civilians in this terrible 10-day<br/>offensive - 206 by last night - has been so cavalier, so ferocious, that<br/>not a Lebanese will forgive<br/>            this massacre. There had been the ambulance attacked on<br/>Saturday, the sisters killed in Yohmor the day before, the 2-year-old<br/>girl decapitated by an<br/>            Israeli missile four days ago. And earlier yesterday, the<br/>Israelis had slaughtered a family of 12 - the youngest was a four-<br/>day-old baby - when Israeli<br/>            helicopter pilots fired missiles into their home.</p><p>            Shortly afterwards, three Israeli jets dropped bombs only<br/>250 metres from a UN convoy on which I was travelling, blasting a house<br/>30 feet into the<br/>            air in front of my eyes. Travelling back to Beirut to file<br/>my report on the Qana massacre to the Independent last night, I found<br/>two Israeli gunboats<br/>            firing at the civilian cars on the river bridge north of<br/>Sidon.</p><p>            Every foreign army comes to grief in Lebanon. The Sabra and<br/>Chatila massacre of Palestinians by Israel&apos;s militia allies in 1982<br/>doomed Israel&apos;s 1982<br/>            invasion. Now the Israelis are stained again by the<br/>bloodbath at Qana, the scruffy little Lebanese hill town where the<br/>Lebanese believe Jesus turned<br/>            water into wine.</p><p>            The Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres may now wish to end<br/>this war. But the Hizbollah are not likely to let him. Israel is back in<br/>the Lebanese<br/>            quagmire. Nor will the Arab world forget yesterday&apos;a<br/>terrible scenes.</p><p>            The blood of all the refugees ran quite literally in streams<br/>from the shell-smashed UN compound restaurant in which the Shiite<br/>Muslims from the hill<br/>            villages of southern Lebanon - who had heeded Israel&apos;s order<br/>to leave their homes - had pathetically sought shelter. Fijian and<br/>French soldiers heaved<br/>            another group of dead - they lay with their arms tightly<br/>wrapped around each other - into blankets.</p><p>            A French UN trooper muttered oaths to himself as he opened a<br/>bag in which he was dropping feet, fingers, pieces of people&apos;s arms.</p><p>            And as we walked through this obscenity, a swarm of people<br/>burst into the compound. They had driven in wild convoys down from Tyre<br/>and began<br/>            to pull the blankets off the mutilated corpses of their<br/>mothers and sons and daughters and to shriek &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; (God is<br/>Great&quot;) and to threaten the<br/>            UN troops.</p><p>            We had suddenly become not UN troops and journalists but<br/>Westerners, Israel&apos;s allies, an object of hatred and venom. One bearded<br/>man with fierce<br/>            eyes stared at us, his face dark with fury. &quot;You are<br/>Americans,&quot; he screamed at us. &quot;Americans are dogs. You did this.<br/>Americans are dogs.&quot;</p><p>            President Bill Clinton has allied himself with Israel in its<br/>war against &quot;terrorism&quot; and the Lebanese, in their grief, had not<br/>forgotten this. Israel&apos;s<br/>            official expression of sorrow was rubbing salt in their<br/>wounds. &quot;I would like to be made into a bomb and blow myself up amid the<br/>Israelis,&quot; one old<br/>            man said.</p><p>            As for the Hizbollah, which has repeatedly promised that<br/>Israelis will pay for their killing of Lebanese civilians, its revenge<br/>cannot be long in<br/>            coming. Operation Grapes of Wrath may then turn out then to<br/>be all too aptly named.<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
