I very much hope, for your sake and for those that would find it of interest and benefit, that you&apos;ll devote a significant amount of time in preparing some of your theoretical work into a cogent documentation, and publish via your web site.</p><p>And, very seriously, I would hope you would work with a music editor or some interested reader who stands a bit apart from the mathematical world that you comfortably inhabit, and allow them to assist you in the written manner of the documentation. Your way of describing things is not well suited to lay people, or even to many who have a passing knowledge of these issues, and I think you are a big enough person to accept help from someone.

Tunings are something one interacst with and i enjoy them putting up<br/>with their own inclinations, like conversing with a friend you enjoy the<br/>subtlies as you watch them lean this way or that. I started working with ETs<br/>and wanted to stay with them. the sound finally pushed me away toward what i<br/>like.<br/>    We all hear the way we do and it takes a long time i think ( maybe i am<br/>just slow) to really realize just what it is i wanted to start with. At 50,<br/>i have a fairly good idea. such things impress upon ourselves by what type<br/>of subsets we extract from a given tuning. my advice is to follow this train<br/>where it leads you. theory be damned for so often we do things we didn&apos;t<br/>realize was an acting factor till we can look at it,  here theory can be<br/>brought back in to tell us possibly why we did what we did or why we wanted<br/>to. Gene hears differently than i do and i am glad he is investigated the<br/>directions he is. I on the other hand have little interest in others using<br/>the tunings i do, i fact it might make me feel crowded.</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;***I agree wholeheartedly with Kraig&apos;s idea of sticking with<br/>&gt; &gt;only a *few* tunings.
