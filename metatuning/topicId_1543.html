Somebody had taught the pig how to drink<br/>beer, so people would walk by and toss the pig cans of<br/>beer. The pig would run, jump up in the air and catch<br/>the beer with its snout, pop open the top and drink the<br/>beer. The problem was that too many people in the<br/>neighborhood knew about the pig and were always coming<br/>around to give the pig beers and it wasn&apos;t good for the<br/>pig because he was getting really fat.</p><p>Anyway, she finally went and put a sign in her front<br/>yard that said: &quot;Please Do Not Block The Pumps&quot;.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
