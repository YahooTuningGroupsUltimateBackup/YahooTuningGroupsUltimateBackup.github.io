Recent stories in the Wall Street<br/>Journal (Sept. 27 &amp; 28, 2001), ABC News (Oct. 1,<br/>2001), as well as a host of reports from so-called<br/>alternative news sources have begun to focus attention<br/>on the Bush family&apos;s profit-making role in creating<br/>and arming our enemies.The following is a more<br/>comprehensive look at the documented history of these<br/>relationships that will also open some new avenues of<br/>inquiry for the press, Congress and the American<br/>people.</p><p>In a world now filled with biowarfare agents, backpack<br/>nuclear devices, and chemical weapons like Sarin gas -<br/>where there are people in many countries with reasons<br/>to oppose the United States -- the Bush Administration<br/>is following predictable strategies in a way that<br/>redefines the concept of brinksmanship. Human survival<br/>may depend upon the will and the ability of both the<br/>Congress and the press to focus on these relationships<br/>and to take appropriate action. Moreover - and I am<br/>not the first to say this - if a national security<br/>priority is to seize the financial assets of those who<br/>support terrorists, then perhaps we should start right<br/>here at home.</p><p>Adolph Hitler</p><p>Meticulous research, including U.S. government records<br/>from the era, along with contemporaneous news stories<br/>from the New York Times and other papers are presented<br/>in the 1992 book entitled, &quot;George Bush, The<br/>Unauthorized Biography&quot; by Webster G. Tarpley &amp; Anton<br/>Chaitkin, Published by The Executive Intelligence<br/>Review and located at:</p><p><a href="http://www.tarpley.net/bushb.htm">http://www.tarpley.net/bushb.htm</a></p><p>The following is sourced entirely from Chapter II of<br/>this essential work.</p><p>[Note: Although FTW does not always agree with<br/>conclusions reached by the Executive Intelligence<br/>Review, or its founder Lyndon La Rouche, we have never</p><p>found a single flaw in any of their factual research.<br/>History is history, no matter who presents it. And<br/>this history is essential to understanding our era.]</p><p>George W. Bush&apos;s grandfather, Prescott Bush, was the<br/>Managing Director of the investment bank Brown<br/>Brothers, Harriman from the 1920s through the<br/>1940s. It was Brown Brothers, in conjunction with<br/>Averell Harriman, the Rockefeller family, Standard<br/>Oil, the DuPonts, the Morgans and the Fords which<br/>served as the principal funding arm in helping to<br/>finance Adolph Hitler&apos;s rise to power starting in<br/>1923. This included direct funding for the SS and SA<br/>channeled through a variety of German firms. Through<br/>associations with the Hamburg-Amerika Steamship line,<br/>Nazi Banker Fritz Thyssen (pronounced Tee-sen),<br/>Standard Oil of Germany, The German Steel Trust<br/>(founded by Dillon Read founder, Clarence Dillon), and<br/>I.G. Farben, Prescott Bush used the Union Bank<br/>Corporation to funnel vast quantities of money to the<br/>Nazis and to manage their American interests. The<br/>profits from those investments came back to Bush<br/>allies on Wall Street. Thyssen is universally regarded<br/>as having been Hitler&apos;s private banker and ultimate<br/>owner of the Union Bank Corporation.Early support for<br/>Hitler came from Prescott Bush through the<br/>Hamburg-Amerika line -- also funded by Brown Bothers<br/>-- that funneled large sums of money and weapons to<br/>Hitler&apos;s storm troopers in the 1920s.</p><p>&quot;In May 1933, just after the Hitler regime was<br/>consolidated, an agreement was reached in Berlin for<br/>the coordination of all Nazi commerce with the U.S.A.<br/>The Harriman International Company... was to head a<br/>syndicate of 150 firms and individuals, to conduct all<br/>exports from Hitler Germany to the United States.&quot;</p><p>According to Tarpley and Chaitkin a 1942 U.S.<br/>government investigative report that surfaced during<br/>1945 Senate hearings found that the Union Bank, with<br/>Prescott Bush on the board, was an &quot;interlocking<br/>concern&quot; with the German Steel Trust that had<br/>produced:- 50.8% of Nazi Germany&apos;s pig iron- 41.4% of<br/>Nazi Germany&apos;s universal plate- 36% of Nazi Germany&apos;s<br/>heavy plate- 38.5% of Nazi Germany&apos;s galvanized sheet-<br/>45.5% of Nazi Germany&apos;s pipes and tubes- 22.1% of Nazi<br/>Germany&apos;s wire- 35% of Nazi Germany&apos;s explosives.</p><p>The business relationships established by Bush in 1923<br/>continued even after the war started until they became<br/>so offensive and overt as to warrant seizure by the<br/>U.S. government under the Trading with the Enemy Act<br/>in 1942.</p><p>In 1942, &quot;Under the Trading with the Enemy Act, the<br/>government took over Union Banking Corporation, in<br/>which Bush was a director. The U.S. Alien Property<br/>Custodian seized Union Banking Corp.&apos;s stock shares...</p><p>&quot;... all of which shares are held for the benefit<br/>of... members of the Thyssen family, [and] is property<br/>of nationals... of a designated enemy country.&quot;</p><p>&quot;On October 28, the government issued orders seizing<br/>two Nazi front organizations run by the Bush-Harriman<br/>bank: the Holland-American Trading Corporation and the<br/>Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nazi interests in the Silesian-American Corporation,<br/>long managed by Prescott Bush and his father in law<br/>George Herbert Walker, were seized under the Trading<br/>with the Enemy Act on Nov. 17, 1942...&quot;</p><p>These seizures of Bush businesses were reported in a<br/>number of American papers including The New York Times<br/>and The Wall Street Journal.  Prescott Bush went on to<br/>become an influential Republican Senator from<br/>Connecticut who went on to be a regular golfing<br/>partner of President Dwight Eisenhower. His attorneys<br/>were the lawyers John Foster and Allen Dulles, the<br/>later became the CIA Director under Eisenhower.</p><p>Saddam Hussein</p><p>After becoming President in January 1989, Prescott<br/>Bush&apos;s son, George Herbert Walker Bush - father of our<br/>current President - authorized a series of programs<br/>which not only armed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein but<br/>also provided him with technology that assisted in his<br/>development of chemical weapons like Sarin gas, and<br/>biological weapons, which he still possesses.</p><p>Apologists for Bush (the elder) say that, after the<br/>Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s left the region unstable,<br/>he was just trying to establish a new balance of<br/>power. Not so. Bush directives and policies, including<br/>relationships with the Bank of Credit and Commerce<br/>International (BCCI), the Banca Nacional del Lavoro<br/>(BNL) were directly and deliberately responsible<br/>for creating the army the U.S. fought in 1991.</p><p>In its March/April issue the Colombia Journalism<br/>Review (CJR), in a story by Russ W. Baker, published<br/>the most compelling overview of Iraqgate.</p><p>&quot;ABC News Nightline opened last June 9 with words to<br/>make the heart stop &apos;It is becoming increasingly<br/>clear,&apos; said a grave Ted Koppel, &apos;that George Bush,<br/>operating largely behind the scenes throughout the<br/>1980s, initiated and supported much of the financing,<br/>intelligence, and military help that built Saddam&apos;s<br/>Iraq into the aggressive power that the United States<br/>ultimately had to destroy...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why, then, have some of our top papers provided so<br/>little coverage?...&quot;</p><p>&quot; The result: readers who neither grasp nor care about<br/>the facts behind facile imagery like The Butcher of<br/>Baghdad and Operation Desert Storm. In particular,<br/>readers who do not follow the story of the Banca<br/>Nacional del Lavoro, which apparently served as a<br/>paymaster for Saddam&apos;s arms buildup, and thus became a<br/>player in the largest bank-fraud case in U.S. history.</p><p>&quot;Complex, challenging, mind-boggling stories (from<br/>Iran-Contra to the S&amp;L crisis to BCCI) increasingly<br/>define our times: yet we don&apos;t appear to be getting<br/>any better at telling them...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Much of what Saddam received from the West was not<br/>arms per se, but so-called dual-use technology --<br/>ultra sophisticated computers, armored ambulances,<br/>helicopters, chemicals, and the like, with potential<br/>civilian uses as well as military applications. We&apos;ve<br/>learned that a vast network of companies, based in the<br/>U.S. and abroad, eagerly fed the Iraqi war machine<br/>right up until August 1990, when Saddam invaded<br/>Kuwait.&quot;</p><p>And we&apos;ve learned that the obscure Atlanta Branch of<br/>Italy&apos;s largest bank, Banca Nacional del Lavoro,<br/>relying partly on U.S. taxpayer-guaranteed loans,<br/>funneled $5 billion to Iraq from 1985 to 1989. Some<br/>government-backed loans were supposed to be for<br/>agricultural purposes, but were used to facilitate<br/>the purchase of stronger stuff than wheat. Federal<br/>Reserve and Agriculture department memos warned of<br/>suspected abuses by Iraq, which apparently took<br/>advantage of the loans to free up funds for munitions.<br/>U.S. taxpayers have been left holding the bag for what<br/>looks like $2 billion in defaulted loans to Iraq.&quot;</p><p>&quot;... In fact, we now know that in February 1990, then<br/>Attorney General Dick Thornburgh [appointed by George<br/>H.W. Bush] blocked U.S. investigators from traveling<br/>to Rome and Istanbul to pursue the case...&quot;</p><p>&quot;... As New York Times columnist William Safire argued<br/>last December 7, &apos;Iraqgate is uniquely horrendous: a<br/>scandal about the Systematic abuse of power by<br/>misguided leaders of three democratic nations [The<br/>U.S., Britain, and Italy] to secretly finance the arms<br/>buildup of a dictator.</p><p>&quot;As Democrat Henry Gonzales, Chairman of the House<br/>Banking Committee during the period, stood as the lone<br/>voice from the wilderness in raising alarms about<br/>Bush&apos;s obvious corruption, the rest of the Congress<br/>sheepishly ignored all the signs demanding immediate<br/>action. Gonzales&apos; voice reportedly fell silent after<br/>his empty car was machine-gunned in a Washington<br/>suburb in what passed for a drive-by shooting.  The<br/>CJR continues:</p><p>&quot;Meanwhile, The Village Voice published a major<br/>investigation by free-lancer Murray Waas in its<br/>December 18, 1990 issue...&quot;</p><p>That American troops could be killed or maimed because<br/>of a covert decision to arm Iraq,&apos; Waas wrote, &quot;is the<br/>most serious consequence of a U.S. foreign policy<br/>formulated and executed in secret, without the advice<br/>and consent of the American public...&quot;</p><p>The L.A. Times, on Feb 23, 1992, dug deep enough to<br/>find secret National Security Decision Directives by<br/>the Bush Administration in 1989 ordering closer ties<br/>with Baghdad and paving the way for $1 billion in new<br/>aid. The Times&apos; series, co-authored with Waas,<br/>emphasized that, &quot;buried deep in a 1991 Washington<br/>Press piece - that Secretary of State James Baker,<br/>after meeting with Iraqi foreign minister Tariq Aziz<br/>in October 1989, intervened personally to support U.S.<br/>government loans guarantees to Iraq.&quot;</p><p>The CJR report also noted, &quot;On October 3, the [Wall<br/>Street] Journal reported [BNL official Christopher]<br/>Drogoul&apos;s assertion that the director general of<br/>Iraq&apos;s Ministry of Industry and Military Production<br/>had told him, &apos;We are all in this together. The<br/>intelligence service of the U.S. government works<br/>very closely with the intelligence service of the<br/>Iraqi government.&apos; Three weeks later, the Journal<br/>reported that [Henry] Gonzales &apos;produced a<br/>phone-book-sized packet of documents&apos; showing the<br/>involvement of U.S. exporting firms... The documents<br/>mentioned one... which designed parts for Iraq&apos;s<br/>howitzers and was financed through BNL...&quot;</p><p>In the wake of highly suspicious anthrax outbreaks in<br/>Florida, just miles form where several of the WTC<br/>suicides pilots trained, we add one final note. In his<br/>1998 book &quot;Bringing the War Home&quot; author William<br/>Thomas writes, &quot; Under that same [weapons transfer]<br/>program, 19 containers of Anthrax bacteria were<br/>supplied to Iraq in 1988 by the American Type Culture<br/>Collection company, located near Fort Detrick, MD, the<br/>site of the US Army&apos;s high security germ warfare<br/>labs.&quot;</p><p>The Carlyle Group, the Bushes and bin Laden</p><p>The warnings about the Carlyle Group, the nation&apos;s<br/>11th largest defense contractor, and the Bushes came<br/>long before the World Trade Center attacks.  The<br/>Carlyle Group is a closely held corporation, exempt<br/>from reporting its affairs to the Securities and<br/>Exchange Commission. Little is known of what it<br/>actually does except that it buys and sells defense<br/>contractors. As of October 4, 2001, it has removed its<br/>corporate web site from the World Wide Web making<br/>further investigation through that channel impossible.<br/>Its Directors include Frank Carlucci, former Reagan<br/>Secretary of Defense; James Baker, former Bush<br/>Secretary of State; and Richard Darman, a former White<br/>House aide to Ronald Reagan and Republican Party<br/>operative.</p><p>On March 3, 2001, just weeks after George W Bush&apos;s<br/>inauguration, the conservative Washington lobbying<br/>group Judicial Watch issued a press release. It<br/>said:(Washington, D.C.) Judicial Watch, the public<br/>interest law firm that investigates and prosecutes<br/>government abuse and corruption, called on former<br/>President George Herbert Walker Bush to resign<br/>immediately from the Carlyle Group, a private<br/>investment firm, while his son President George W.<br/>Bush is in office. Today&apos;s New York Times reported<br/>that the elder Bush is an<br/>&quot;ambassador&quot; for the $12 billion private investment<br/>firm and last year traveled to the Middle East on its<br/>behalf. The former president also helped the firm in<br/>South Korea.</p><p>The New York Times reported that as compensation, the<br/>elder Bush is allowed to buy a stake in the Carlyle<br/>Group&apos;s investments, which include ownership in at<br/>least 164 companies throughout the world (thereby by<br/>giving the current president an indirect benefit).<br/>James Baker, the former Secretary of State who served<br/>as President George W. Bush&apos;s point man in Florida&apos;s<br/>election dispute, is a partner in the firm. The firm<br/>also gave George W. Bush help in the early 1990&apos;s when<br/>it placed him on one of its subsidiary&apos;s board of<br/>directors.</p><p>&quot;This is simply inappropriate. Former President Bush<br/>should immediately resign from the Carlyle Group<br/>because it is an obvious conflict of interest.  Any<br/>foreign government or foreign investor trying to curry<br/>favor with the current Bush Administration is sure to<br/>throw business to the Carlyle Group. And with the<br/>former President Bush promoting the firm&apos;s investments<br/>abroad, foreign nationals could understandably confuse<br/>the Carlyle Group&apos;s interests with the interests of<br/>the United States government,&quot; stated Larry Klayman,<br/>Judicial Watch Chairman and General Counsel.</p><p>&quot;Questions are now bound to be raised if the recent<br/>Bush Administration change in policy towards Iraq has<br/>the fingerprints of the Carlyle Group, which is trying<br/>to gain investments from other Arab countries who<br/>[sic]<br/>would presumably benefit from the new policy,&quot; stated<br/>Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.</p><p>Judicial Watch noted that &quot;even the Clinton<br/>Administration called on the Rodham brothers to stop<br/>their business dealings in [The former Soviet Republic<br/>of] Georgia because those dealings started to<br/>destabilize that country.&quot;</p><p>Since the WTC attacks the Wall Street Journal has<br/>reported (Sept. 28, 2001) that, &quot;George H.W. Bush, the<br/>father of President Bush, works for the bin Laden<br/>family business in Saudi Arabia through the Carlyle<br/>Group, an international consulting firm.&quot; The senior<br/>Bush had met with the bin Laden family at least twice<br/>in the last three years - 1998 and 2000 -- as a<br/>representative of Carlyle, seeking to expand business<br/>dealings with one of the wealthiest Saudi families,<br/>which some experts argue, has never fully severed its<br/>ties with black sheep Osama in spite of current<br/>reports in a mainstream press that is afraid of<br/>offending the current administration.</p><p>The Nation, on March 27, 2000 - in a story co-authored<br/>by David Corn and Paul Lashmar - wrote, &quot;In January<br/>former President George Bush and former British Prime<br/>Minister John Major paid a social call on Saudi<br/>Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah...&quot; This story confirms<br/>at least one meeting between the elder Bush and Saudi<br/>leaders, including the bin Ladens. That the bin Ladens<br/>attended this meeting was confirmed in a subsequent<br/>September 27, 2001 Wall Street Journal (WSJ) story.<br/>The January 2000 meeting with the bin Ladens was<br/>also later confirmed by Bush (the elder&apos;s) Chief of<br/>Staff Jean Becker, only after the WSJ presented her<br/>with a thank you note sent by Bush to the bin Ladens<br/>after that meeting.</p><p>James Baker visited the bin Ladens in 1998 and 1999<br/>with Carlyle CEO Frank Carlucci.  The WSJ story went<br/>on to note, &quot;A Carlyle executive said that the bin<br/>Laden family committed $2 million through a London<br/>investment arm in 1995 in Carlyle Partners II Fund,<br/>which raised $1.3 billion overall. The fund has<br/>purchased several aerospace companies among 29 deals.<br/>So far, the family has received $1.3 million back in<br/>completed investments and should ultimately realize a<br/>40% annualized rate of return, the Carlyle executive<br/>said.&quot;</p><p>But a foreign financier with ties to the bin Laden<br/>family says the family&apos;s overall investment with<br/>Carlyle is considerably larger...In other words, Osama<br/>bin Laden&apos;s attacks on the WTC and Pentagon, with the<br/>resulting massive  increase in the U.S. defense budget<br/>have just made his family a great big pile of money.</p><p>More Bush connections appear in relation to the bin<br/>Ladens. The WSJ story notes that, &quot;During the past<br/>several years, the [bin Laden] family&apos;s close ties to<br/>the Saudi royal family prompted executives and staff<br/>from closely held New York publisher Forbes, Inc. to<br/>make two trips to the family headquarters, according<br/>to Forbes Chairman Caspar Weinberger, a former U.S.<br/>Secretary of Defense in the Reagan administration. &apos;We<br/>would call on them to get their view of the country<br/>and what would be of interest to investors.&apos; President<br/>G.H.W. Bush pardoned Weinberger for his criminal<br/>conduct in the Iran-Contra scandal in 1989.</p><p>Our current President, George W. Bush has also had --<br/>at minimum -- indirect dealings with Carlyle and the<br/>bin Ladens. In 1976 his firm Arbusto Energy was funded<br/>with $50,000 from Texas investment banker James R.<br/>Bath who was also the U.S. investment counselor for<br/>the bin Laden family. In his watershed 1992 book, &quot;The<br/>Mafia, The CIA and George Bush,&quot; award winning<br/>Texas investigative journalist Pete Brewton dug deeply<br/>into Bath&apos;s background, revealing connections with the<br/>CIA and major fraudulent activities connected with the<br/>Savings &amp; Loan scandal that took $500 billion out of<br/>the pockets of American taxpayers. A long-time friend<br/>of George W. Bush, Bath was connected to a number of<br/>covert financing operations in the Iran-Contra<br/>scandal, which also linked to bin Laden friend Adnan<br/>Khashoggi, one of the richest men in the world and the<br/>arms merchant who was at the center of the whole<br/>Iran-Contra scandal. Khashoggi, whose connections to<br/>the bin Ladens is more than superficial, got his first<br/>business break by acting as middle-man for a large<br/>truck purchase by Osama bin Laden&apos;s older brother,<br/>Salem.</p><p>Another key player in the Bush Administration, Deputy<br/>Secretary of Defense Richard Armitage, left his post<br/>as an Assistant Secretary of Defense in the<br/>Reagan Administration after a series of scandals<br/>connected to CIA operatives Ed Wilson, Ted Shackley,<br/>Richard Secord and Tom Clines placed him at the<br/>brink of criminal indictment and jail. Shackley and<br/>Secord are veterans of Vietnam operations and have<br/>long been linked to opium/heroin smuggling. The<br/>Armitage scandals all focused on the illegal provision<br/>of weapons and war materiel to potential or actual<br/>enemies of the U.S. and to the Contras in Central<br/>America.</p><p>Armitage, a former Navy SEAL, who reportedly enjoyed<br/>combat missions and killing during covert operations<br/>in Laos during the Vietnam War, has never been far<br/>from the Bush family&apos;s side. Throughout his career,<br/>both in and out of government, he has been perpetually<br/>connected to CIA drug smuggling operations. Secretary<br/>of State Colin Powell, in a 1995 Washington Post<br/>story, called Armitage, &quot;my white son.&quot; In 1990, then<br/>President Bush dispatched Armitage to Russia to aid in<br/>its &quot;transition&quot; to capitalism. Armitage&apos;s Russian<br/>work for Bush has been frequently connected to the<br/>explosion of drug trafficking under the Russian<br/>Mafias, which became virtual rulers of the nation<br/>afterwards. In the early 1990s Armitage had extensive<br/>involvement in Albania at the same time that the<br/>Albanian ally, Kosovo Liberation Army was coming to<br/>power and consolidating its grip, according to The<br/>Christian Science Monitor, on 70% of the world&apos;s opium<br/>trade.</p><p>[See FTW Vol. II, No 2 - April 24, 1999]</p><p>Armitage and Carlucci are both  Board Members of the<br/>influential Washington  think tank, the Middle East<br/>Policy Council.  The connections continue with<br/>Vice President Dick Cheney. Amongst the multitude of<br/>oil pipelines  construction running through the new<br/>war zone is one project - according  to a Sept. 19,<br/>2001 Wall Street Journal story - a joint venture in<br/>which the  bin Laden family joined with the<br/>construction firm H.C. Price. Price  subsequently<br/>changed its name to Bredero Shaw, Inc. and is now<br/>owned by  a subsidiary of the Halliburton Corporation,<br/>Dresser Industries. It was Dresser industries that<br/>gave George H.W. Bush his first post war job in 1948.</p><p>Vice President Dick Cheney, who served as Secretary of<br/>Defense during Desert Storm, directing the campaign<br/>against Saddam Hussein, was Halliburton&apos;s CEO until<br/>last year&apos;s election.  And, according to a 2000 story<br/>from Harper&apos;s Magazine, in 1990 our current President,<br/>through a position as a corporate director of<br/>Caterair, owned by the Carlyle Group - at a time when<br/>the bin Laden&apos;s were invested in Carlyle - had<br/>additional connections to the bin Laden family. In<br/>addition, on March 1, 1995, when George W. Bush was<br/>Texas governor and a senior Trustee of the university,<br/>the University of Texas Endowment voted to place $10<br/>million in investments with the Carlyle Group. As to<br/>how much of that money went to the bin Ladens we can<br/>only guess. But we do know that there is a long<br/>tradition in the Bush family of giving money to those<br/>who kill Americans.</p><p>Now, as the people of America are beginning to awaken<br/>to what is really being unleashed upon them, as a few<br/>brave souls are asking who&apos;s going to get all the<br/>money the Bush Administration is &quot;borrowing&quot; from<br/>government coffers and who&apos;s going to pay for it - the<br/>above history is more than ominous.Considering that<br/>during the 1980s, under the pretext of fighting a<br/>Sandinista regime in Nicaragua that never once<br/>launched an attack on the U.S., these same people<br/>oversaw an explosion in U.S. cocaine consumption<br/>that went from 80 metric tons in 1979 to 600 metric<br/>tons in 1989 - considering that the CIA trained and<br/>equipped death squads that tortured and murdered<br/>hundreds of thousands of people from Guatemala to<br/>Panama - considering that these same people have<br/>brutalized Iraq, leaving portions of it radioactively<br/>contaminated by depleted uranium for the next 4<br/>billion years and causing a fivefold increase in the number of<br/>childhood leukemia cases amidst a starving population,<br/>one can only wonder what they will produce for the<br/>world now given the context of the World Trade Center<br/>attacks.</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2001 6:32:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Paul, for passing this on.
