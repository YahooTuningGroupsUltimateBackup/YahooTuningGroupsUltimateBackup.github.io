But I believe the actions of the US<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; government have increased the amount and severity of weapons<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in the world 100-fold beyond what was necessary, even without<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; any governance change of the kind we are discussing.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; this is putting the cart before the horse.  You know that if I<br/>&gt; &gt; write to my congresspeople askign them to curtail arms sales,<br/>&gt; &gt; they&apos;ll come back with the &quot;but people will lose jobs argument&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Would they?  That argument doesn&apos;t hold any water as far as I&apos;m<br/>&gt; concerned.  A harder-to-debunk argument would be that extreme US<br/>&gt; military force is needed to keep the world running smoothly.  But<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t believe that either.</p><p>You&apos;re right, it would probably be a combination of both arguments.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; in other words, they can&apos;t turn  their backs on the people<br/>&gt; &gt; that funded their campaigns.<br/>&gt; &gt; In other words, the government is doing what it&apos;s doing<br/>&gt; &gt; largely at the behest of the corporations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s definitely feedback, but the government&apos;s desire<br/>&gt; for weapons is definitely primary in my view.</p><p>Maybe,  but I thought we were discussing the SALE of weapons to OTHER<br/>governments.  The only interest in that, (especially if they are shady<br/>nature, like Iraq in the 80&apos;s, or who knows where now (we&apos;ll find out in<br/>20 years when we have to send more soldiers to die killing civilians of<br/>some country run by some dictator that we&apos;re currently arming), the only<br/>interest in that,  is big business.  and to some extent,  making sure<br/>communist govt&apos;s don&apos;t arise.
