At<br/>previous points in my life I composed with guitar, bass, keyboards, an akai<br/>sampler, and my computer; on which I used software such as<br/>acid,fruityloops,and soundforge to create music, and later using Reason and<br/>Rebirth to create live improvised performances that take the 20 minutes the<br/>demo provides as a challenge to set up and perform a piece in that timespan.<br/>I do own the full versions of both.</p><p>I am extremely moody and that relates to my creative practice in many ways.<br/>Some days I create mind bending structures (though from what I see after I<br/>have subscribed to quite a few lists that there are many people who delve<br/>deep) other days I just improvise, and the more I try to do one, the more I<br/>end up doing the other.</p><p>I went to the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1999-2000 and focused my<br/>studies on Sound Art, taking Sound 1 and History of Sonic Art with Zeena<br/>Parkins and Dave Moulton.  My moods got the best of me there because  I felt<br/>too much of an outsider, and didn&apos;t take well to the &apos;game&apos; of art school.</p><p>I tend to prefer just about every type of music:  Some favorites currently<br/>are:<br/>Led Zepplin<br/>Gamelan Music<br/>Breakin Records Artists (DMX Krew, Mandroid, etc)<br/>Herbie Hancock&apos;s Mwandishi<br/>Grateful Dead<br/>Pole<br/>Nirvana<br/>Pansonic<br/>Bob Marley<br/>Dylan<br/>Tortoise<br/>Ferarri<br/>Aphex Twin Selected Ambient Works II<br/>Yoko Ono<br/>Mudhoney</p><p>My wisdom teeth are coming in. I swear to god they came in a few years ago.<br/>It sure felt like it. but there are more right now.<br/>I am especially interested in the Tarot and the Kabbalah.   In the book, An<br/>Illustrated Guide to Tarot, there is a system of musical notation based on<br/>the 12 tone and tarot assignment to write music.  Also fractal music.<br/>Sometimes I feel like being very outgoing and others you probably wont hear<br/>from me.<br/>I am a devourer of music and theory, and spend too much on CDs.<br/>Currently my computer is out of operation and I am using another without a<br/>soundcard, which kills me.<br/>I used to be a raging drunk.<br/>I am currently working on putting together an artists group, coacalina. with<br/>its home at <a href="http://www.coacalina.org">http://www.coacalina.org</a> .  I am working on about 20-30<br/>different projects right now from a novel to paintings to tarot spread<br/>reference websites to electronic meditational music to live improvisation on<br/>guitar, keyboards computer etc.<br/>I am quite interested in what this list and others similar have to offer, I<br/>appreciate if anyone could point out some internet sites that are related.<br/>I find that I am a beginner in some ways and a intermediate in others and I<br/>love learning more than anything else, well almost.<br/>I have had a wierd upbringing regarding music.  My mom listened to classical<br/>and 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s popular, and was a choir director when I was younger, and<br/>my dad listens to only 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s popular.  When the beatles stopped<br/>wanting to hold your hand, my dad stopped listening.  I played piano from<br/>4th-8th grade with private lessons (actually I was a Sythesizer performer, I<br/>learned and performed on them since the start, but my 1 hour lessons were<br/>always on piano).  In result, I am constantly learning about music as I<br/>missed most of the popular trends in music, and didn&apos;t know anything about<br/>70&apos;s 80&apos;s anything.  anything.  So I am quite interested in listening to<br/>what others may dismiss as &apos;just&apos; the Dead, or Dylan, or CSNY, or whatnot,<br/>as it is basically all new to me.  I am also interested in Jazz, and Reggae,<br/>and people like Reich,Ferrari, and P.Henry.  I tend to vary on how much I<br/>remember about what I have learned.  Today is a day of learning, as I have<br/>forgotten all about a bit of things.   Tomorrow I may expound the ideas of<br/>Plutarch or something.</p><p>I hope no one was offended in the previous &apos;kicking in the balls&apos; statement,<br/>I have been weary of all of the fighting on mail lists lately, and its hard<br/>to gauge which is a good one and which is bad, because of all of the OT<br/>debating over political issues.   Not that I haven&apos;t been guilty of the<br/>same, or that I particularly mind, but that Its just difficult to tell the<br/>worth of perusing through hundreds of emails, that I might just want to<br/>ignore.</p><p>erik</p></div><h3><a id=584 href="#584">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/28/2001 11:52:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;ammegand&quot; &lt;ammegand@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello everyone.<br/>&gt; My name is Erik.<br/>&lt;snip Eric tells all&gt;</p><p>Nice to make your aquaintance.
