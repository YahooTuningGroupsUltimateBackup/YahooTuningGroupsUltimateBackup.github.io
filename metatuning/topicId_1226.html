He was the<br/>cat that took Muddy, Wolf, and that whole deep blues thing to the next<br/>level. He was a man of the times, and, along with the Beatles, sort of<br/>sums up the essence of the 1960&apos;s rock explosion. Often, Hendrix&apos;s music<br/>actually transcends music, for me, and seems more like a natural force,<br/>like a storm, or the winds of space. &quot;Voodoo Chile/Slight Return,&quot;<br/>reminds me of a lightning storm over the mountains, and &quot;Machine Gun&quot; is<br/>like a battlefield in the Vietnam war. And, I don&apos;t think he&apos;s been<br/>topped yet.<br/>   As far as Frisell, I think the album &quot;Power Tools&quot; was some of his<br/>best work...I think he&apos;s a marvelous musician, but sometimes, lately,<br/>gets a bit sleepy for me. At his best, he&apos;s the shit...his work with Jan<br/>Garbarek was good, too. Scofield is great, as well. And, does anyone<br/>remember Terje Rypdal? I know he&apos;s still active, maybe not as creative;<br/>he kind of summed up the whole ECM thing for me, creating some very<br/>creative soundscapes over the years. Erkan Ogur is a Turkish feller,<br/>plays fretless, real creative, I see his CD&apos;s now and then...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=1231 href="#1231">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2001 11:49:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: Neil Haverstick &lt;STICK@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 28, 2001 12:12 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] Hendrix, guitarists<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...

Awesome stuff.</p><p>His sonic imagination was just incredible.  Actually, a<br/>closer parallel with him as a composer would be the works<br/>Schoenberg wrote in 1909.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
