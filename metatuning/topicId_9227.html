In the<br/>documentation, there is a separate .pdf doc for the scripting engine,<br/>which looks to be a powerful part of this instrument. There are<br/>appearances that much of the instrument can be scripted, and therefore<br/>molded to personal needs/tastes.</p><p>However...</p><p>This thing is still built on an architecture that assumes, from the<br/>git, 12 notes per octave. I uploaded two files in the &apos;jon&apos; directory<br/>of meta: one is a graphic screen cap that shows the microtuning area,<br/>and how things may be manipulated; the other are two scripts<br/>concatenated into one text file. The first (smaller) is the kludge<br/>they use to on-the-fly fake a 12 note structure into a 1/4 tone scale;<br/>the second, longer part of the script is the microtuning script.</p><p>It looks from studying the scripting that it not only effects the<br/>tuning, but also manages to create the microtuning edit window that<br/>I&apos;ve captured in the jpg. It *may* be possible to go completely wild<br/>and create a larger-than-12 structure, and be able to seed the notes<br/>with tunings. But it looks as if it would be a non-trivial task, and<br/>is certainly a far cry from importing, directly, a .scl, .tun, or MTS<br/>file.</p><p>That&apos;s my take on it so far, and I see a lot to like in this<br/>instrument, but not in it&apos;s microtuning implementation. It isn&apos;t<br/>really any different from K1 or Kompakt in the ability to handle more<br/>than 12 discrete pitches, and if it does it will either require each<br/>person to grunt a lot of code editing, or one truly magnanimous person<br/>who can code up and compile a Scala/MTS -&gt; Kontakt script conversion tool.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2005 3:38:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; This thing is still built on an architecture that assumes, from<br/>&gt; the git, 12 notes per octave.
