This was over a year ago.</p><p>Perhaps I have not made myself clear.  I strongly suspect that W used<br/>coke (quite heavily, it would seem), but I don&apos;t _care_ whether he did<br/>or not.  What I care about is that he is now a drug warrior, and<br/>refuses to acknowledge the inconsistency between his own right to<br/>privacy and everyone else&apos;s &quot;right&quot; to be snooped on by the government.</p><p>As I have mentioned on another list, my own sister had to undergo<br/>chemotherapy about a year ago.  I won&apos;t describe even the little hints<br/>she gave me about what it was like.  Pot is proven to help a vast<br/>majority of patients undergoing chemo.  But it is illegal.  The thought<br/>of my sister suffering more than necessary causes me great sorrow.  And<br/>the thought of sanctimonious bozos like Bush and Ashcroft sticking their<br/>fat noses into other people&apos;s lives fills me with great anger.</p><p>If, as it seems, you are outraged that I have presented informed<br/>speculation as if it were incontrovertible fact, I withdraw my assertion<br/>that W used coke.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
