When the two I<br/>corresponded with came back just last week, I was able to complete the<br/>interviews I started several months ago<br/>with some new details on how the war is actually going.</p><p>I was shocked and angered when I found out how many of the service men<br/>hate being in Iraq and want nothing to<br/>do with rebuilding and policing the devastated nation. From the<br/>conversations I had, many soldiers never wanted<br/>to go over to Iraq and fight, and the ones who had were now convinced of<br/>the awful crime that had been<br/>committed against Iraq and our own troops. I was told very few soldiers<br/>now believe in staying in Iraq, or want to<br/>stay in the country and serve any more days.</p><p>The following interview was with an enlisted man, but someone very high<br/>up in the enlisted ranks, with over 20<br/>years of military service. I have promised not to reveal his identity<br/>for reasons that he has a family and has been<br/>told not to speak to journalists. He told me the Army had put a gag<br/>order on him while he was home, and told him<br/>they would give him twenty years in prison if he spoke out in any manner<br/>against the US or the government.</p><p>I took several weeks to finish this interview because of not being able<br/>to safely be seen with this individual out of<br/>his fears of being caught speaking out.</p><p>He asked me to call him USA in all the transcripts of these interviews.<br/>I have followed his wishes and tried to<br/>write what he said in the manner it was said so as not to lose any<br/>impact. At times the interview was very rough<br/>and the grammar is not perfect, but I tried to write this in his voice<br/>so that he can tell the world how bad it is in<br/>Iraq. I truly want you to feel what he has experienced in some way if<br/>possible.</p><p>CFTM-- &iuml;&iquest;&half;??How are you today? Resting I hope?&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>USA-- &iuml;&iquest;&half;??Can&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t sleep for sh..t and I have horrible nightmares when I<br/>do sleep. I might be lucky to catch an<br/>hour at a time before the nightmares wake me up. I slept easier in the<br/>combat then now that I&iuml;&iquest;&half;??m away from<br/>there. Most awful place I&iuml;&iquest;&half;??ve ever been or served duty and I didn&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t<br/>want to leave my guys. That was the<br/>hardest part was leaving the guys I had been leading around and trying<br/>to keep out of trouble and alive.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>CFTM-- &iuml;&iquest;&half;??Did you see a lot of your buddies get killed? How did it<br/>affect you?&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>USA-- &iuml;&iquest;&half;??How the hell do you think it affected me? I saw over 30 of the<br/>men I had to keep safe die, and over 100<br/>get wounded and not come back. I still don&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t know if some of the<br/>wounded men made it or not. I was never<br/>told before I came back home.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>CFTM-- &iuml;&iquest;&half;??So it really was awful and as bad as some returning troops<br/>have claimed?&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>USA-- &iuml;&iquest;&half;??It was like a long trip to hell that you knew you might return<br/>from. Of course it is as bad as the soldiers<br/>say it is. Hell it&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s even worse if the truth has to come out. It&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s a<br/>constant fu..ing nightmare trying to figure<br/>out where the guerillas are going to hit, how to keep the civilians<br/>calm, and also getting enough water and food to<br/>eat. That is one thing the media never really told the Americans about,<br/>how bad it was when our convoys<br/>weren&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t getting through. We had to go to some Iraqi people and trade<br/>socks and underwear for some food and a<br/>little water.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>CFTM-- &iuml;&iquest;&half;??You really did get that desperate because I saw it in the<br/>foreign media that the Iraqi civilians had<br/>stepped in and fed a whole bunch of troops that had been days without<br/>food.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>USA-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??Yeah, that ain&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t no joke about getting help from the<br/>civilians right after the invasion. We had a<br/>pretty good laugh about that and how the army owed them some money for<br/>reimbursement. We would not have<br/>starved probably, but when we got the food from the people it made sure<br/>we could still operate as a functioning<br/>unit. It was a near thing that several guys almost died of dehydration<br/>because we ran out of clean water for a few<br/>days.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>CFTM-- &iuml;&iquest;&half;??Just keep going, I want to hear more about the hardships the<br/>military and Bush made you go through.<br/>I want the American people to know what a nightmare this war has become<br/>and what it&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s doing to our service<br/>men over there.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>USA-- &iuml;&iquest;&half;??Okay, well I can bitch about the problems like food being short<br/>and water going bad, but I want to tell<br/>people about how bad the attacks on US and coalition forces have gotten<br/>in the last month. In the last two weeks I<br/>was there we were attacked at least 20 times a day if you count all the<br/>shots we heard from random sniper or<br/>opportunity attacks. We were losing at least five men a day to injuries<br/>and there was at least one of our unit killed<br/>every twenty four hours.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>CFTM-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??So you were getting one a day killed and at least five<br/>injured? Did you know many of the guys<br/>killed?&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>USA-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??That&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s a real dumb fu..ing question to ask me. You know what<br/>my rank is, of course I knew them, I<br/>was the head NCO for years in our unit. I knew most of the guys who died<br/>and I held a lot of hands as they were<br/>dying. You tell me that&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s not gonna to give you nightmares!&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;??I had one guy tell me all he wanted was to see his little daughter;<br/>she was born three days after the war started.<br/>He died in the sand holding my hand and crying because his daughter<br/>would never know him. Tell me that&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s<br/>fu..ing right. Where was George Bush when this kid was gasping for air<br/>and spitting his blood on foreign soil?&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>CFTM-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??I talked to you about this the other day. Do you think George<br/>Bush is the wrong man to order troops<br/>into battle when he ducked it himself?&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>USA-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??That asshole went AWOL and never showed up for duty and then<br/>he has the nerve to take us into two<br/>different wars that will be going on for years. I do not believe he<br/>should be president of this country, he&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s a<br/>complete idiot and he&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s controlled by madmen with a drive for only<br/>profits and getting oil.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>CFTM-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??I just have to get this straight for the public, you are well<br/>educated are you not? I mean you have had<br/>years of leadership training and schools right? You sound very well<br/>informed and aware of the current lies and<br/>manipulations, which I have not found in some other soldiers.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>USA-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??I have a four year degree in the economics field and I am not<br/>a soldier all the time. I am Reservist who<br/>just keeps getting caught on long duty assignments. Believe it or not I<br/>read authors like Noam Chomsky, Gore<br/>Vidal, and Jim Hightower, and went through three copies of &iuml;&iquest;&half;??Stupid<br/>White Men&iuml;&iquest;&half;?? by Michael Moore while I<br/>was over there. I let people read parts of Mike&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s book and they were<br/>irate that Bush had screwed us so hard. I<br/>had parts of &iuml;&iquest;&half;??Best Democracy Money Can Buy&iuml;&iquest;&half;?? mailed to me because I<br/>knew if I had the whole book it<br/>would get stolen in a heartbeat.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>CFTM-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??So you might be quite a bit more aware and well informed<br/>about the real reasons for the war that<br/>others did not know. I don&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t know of many line soldiers reading Greg<br/>Palast or Noam Chomsky.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>USA-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??I guess you&iuml;&iquest;&half;??re right and that might be why I am trying to<br/>speak out and let the Americans know that<br/>they are sending us to be slaughtered. If you don&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t mind I am going to<br/>cut through all the niceties and get down<br/>to why I am going against every oath I took and giving you this<br/>interview. I am doing it for the guys still over<br/>there and for the ones who are going. If I&iuml;&iquest;&half;??m not careful I&iuml;&iquest;&half;??ll end up<br/>back there for another six months.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>CFTM-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??Alright tell me what it was really like and don&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t skip the<br/>gory details. I want people to be shocked<br/>and offended enough to realize why you spoke out and what it is doing to<br/>our military by sending them over there<br/>with blind flag waving and cheers of false victory&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>USA-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??Well the first thing I would like to thank Bush, Cheney,<br/>Rumsfeld, and Congress for is that nice huge<br/>cut they made to Veterans Benefits as soon as the war started. I am in<br/>the Reserves after years of active duty and<br/>now I cannot get PTSD counseling or many medical benefits I used to take<br/>for granted. I knew I would have the<br/>benefits because I was laying my life down for my country. Now my<br/>benefits are cut by around 2/3 and I have to<br/>go to either group therapy or pay for a private counselor out of my own<br/>pocket. What happens when someone like<br/>me has been through enormous battle stress and combat fatigue and then<br/>comes home to no counseling?&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;??I&iuml;&iquest;&half;??ll tell you what is going to happen, he will either kill himself<br/>or take a bunch of people with him. Some of<br/>the guys coming back are going to have gone through the worst time of<br/>their lives with their buddies dying and<br/>getting hurt, and then they&iuml;&iquest;&half;??ll find out they got screwed out of any<br/>counseling. It is the greatest disservice<br/>America is committing against soldiers who fought for this country and<br/>may come back wounded or horribly<br/>scarred. Medical services, school aid to dependents, school aid for the<br/>vets, all slashed to the bare bones; mental<br/>health and drug and alcohol counseling are being eliminated or the<br/>waiting lists will be years long for whatever<br/>services manage to survive.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;??That is one thing the American people still have not really caught on<br/>to is the fact that while they were<br/>screaming out &iuml;&iquest;&half;??Support Our Troops&iuml;&iquest;&half;?? the current regime makers were<br/>fu..ing the military and veterans out of<br/>almost every social program and non essential service that would make<br/>life easier.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;??Bush really fu..ked us while we were gone. We found out about after<br/>being in the middle of heavy fighting for<br/>several weeks. It was one of the first things I read in Stars and<br/>Stripes, and I thought it was a joke because it was<br/>just to hard to believe Congress and our leaders would screw us that bad<br/>while we were fighting and dying.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>CFTM-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??Glad you brought that up about counseling because I wasn&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t<br/>even aware of it. Are you alright to<br/>talk about some of the civilian casualties you witnessed and some of the<br/>horrifying images you told me about<br/>when we first started talking?&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>USA-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??I want to talk about some of the children I saw killed for no<br/>reason, maybe it will wake someone up<br/>who doesn&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t believe it was happening, or that it was very bad. I can<br/>tell you I will never forget the screams of<br/>the wounded or orphaned kids, or the wailing of the parents who lost<br/>their kids. The Iraqis and most Muslims<br/>have a very vocal way of mourning the dead by lamenting and wailing for<br/>the dead. There is no mistaking a<br/>mother or father crying out in pain for the loss of a child. They<br/>don&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t cry like that unless there has been a death.<br/>Sometimes after a bombing raid or an artillery attack you could here<br/>hundreds of people wiling and weeping.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;??I have several grown children with grand kids about the age of most<br/>of the dead children I saw in Iraq. I also<br/>have several kids who are about half grown and I saw a lot of Iraqi<br/>children that age wandering around in charge<br/>of three or four little ones because their parents were dead.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;??Let me tell you about the cluster bomb raid we saw wipe out a whole<br/>bunch of little kids. It looked like they<br/>had already lost their parents and were trying to salvage food from a<br/>destroyed Iraqi convoy by the side of the<br/>road we were on. The kids were way off to the side about half a mile<br/>away by then when we got the word that the<br/>Iraqi column was going to be hit with cluster bombs and we had to clear<br/>the area. We got on the radio and tried to<br/>get the air strike stopped but we were told it was too late to get it<br/>stopped.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;??We could see the body parts flying up into the air after the bombs<br/>hit. It was terrible and we could not do a<br/>damn thing but watch it happen and scream into the radio at the dumb<br/>sh.t pilot that was dropping the bombs.<br/>After the strike was over we went to see if there were any survivors and<br/>all we found was bits and pieces of little<br/>kids and here and there an arm or leg you could still identify.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>CFTM-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??Pretty rough stuff to have to see. Did that kind of thing<br/>happen a lot?&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>USA-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??More than you can imagine until you&iuml;&iquest;&half;??ve seen it over and over<br/>again. Man I don&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t want to talk<br/>about this sh.t anymore. It doesn&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t help to talk about it because it<br/>just makes me think about it again. I can&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t<br/>even get any counseling without having to pay for it.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;??Let all those people who support our troops in on that nice surprise<br/>that Bush gave us. That&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s how much we<br/>really mean to Bush, the Department of Defense and all those other<br/>stupid assholes who keep saying how good<br/>we&iuml;&iquest;&half;??re doing over there. Let those patriotic morons go and fight and<br/>die for our country. Let them leave their<br/>families behind for months and maybe come back home in a box. I&iuml;&iquest;&half;??ll be<br/>the first one to salute them or honor<br/>them when they die.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;??It&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s just like Nam was in the beginning. I was twelve when my dad<br/>got back and I&iuml;&iquest;&half;??ll never forget the pain<br/>and agony he lived with the rest of his life. Its kind of what I feel<br/>now, I suppose. I never thought I would ever<br/>serve in some stuff that&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s so much like Nam it isn&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t funny. Now I<br/>really see what my pop went through, and<br/>if I could I would go back in the past a few months, I would go AWOL or<br/>turn conscientious objector on them,<br/>but it&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s too late for that now.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;??I damn sure will not go back over there even if they throw me in<br/>Leavenworth. I never could understand how a<br/>guy could be a conscientious objector until what I just went through. I<br/>wish more guys would stand up and tell<br/>Bush and the Pentagon they will not fight their war for oil. We should<br/>not have to die for these rich bastards<br/>profits and enrichment.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>CFTM-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??Thank you for taking the risk and talking to me. I know there<br/>will be other soldiers who can&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t<br/>speak out who will thank you for having the courage.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>USA-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??It isn&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t about courage it&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s a matter of what&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s right.<br/>This war is killing the poor or middle class<br/>American men and women who went in the armed forces to have college or<br/>some kind of better future. You<br/>don&iuml;&iquest;&half;??t see the rich kids joining up or any Senator&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s kid dying in<br/>Iraq. It&iuml;&iquest;&half;??s us little guys who are dying over<br/>there or getting disabled for life. Where are the leaders that are<br/>supposed to be looking out for the little man?<br/>They are elected to look after out interests not the interests of Cheney<br/>and Halliburton, or any of the rest of the fat<br/>cats piling up the profits while the blood of our soldiers flows over<br/>their hands.&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>CFTM-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??Anything else you want to say to America? Any final thoughts<br/>or words?&iuml;&iquest;&half;??</p><p>USA-- -&iuml;&iquest;&half;??Yeah! Wake up America! Your sons and daughters are dying for<br/>nothing! This war is not about<br/>freedom or stopping terrorism. Bring us home now! We are dying for oil<br/>and corporate greed!<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
