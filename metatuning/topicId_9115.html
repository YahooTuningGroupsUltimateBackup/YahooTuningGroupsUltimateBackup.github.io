Have you ever tried...<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;1/1 8/7 7/6 6/5 5/4 4/3 7/5 3/2 8/5 5/3 12/7 7/4<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;1/1 28/27 9/8 7/6 9/7 4/3 49/36 3/2 14/9 12/7 7/4 49/27<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ll look into &apos;em.</p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;   From: Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: Re: XV 3080&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;the first scale is the same as my centaur scale  except for the 13/8<br/>&gt;&gt;which i have a 14/9 and 45/32 instead of 7/5<br/>&gt;&gt; David Canwright had a good scale with 13 that also used the 11/8 !<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>Doh!!  Yeah,  that&apos;s right,  the scale I posted should have read:</p><p>1/1 21/20 9/8 7/6 5/4 21/16 11/8 3/2 13/8 5/3 7/4 15/8</p><p>I&apos;m betting that may be the same as David&apos;s ?</p><p>Morton Feldman would have loved one thing I do with this, which is to<br/>play/hold a low 1/1,  and then an octave higher, play and hold the chord<br/>21/20, 7/6, 11/8, 13/8 over it.</p><p>A sound of such desolation . . and one that really &lt;needs&gt; the tuning<br/>(play it on the 12-tet piano, and it&apos;s just a wimpy C Db Eb Gb Ab).</p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; to really see what a scale can do, i find it useful to modulate a basic<br/>&gt;&gt;scale by a cycle of fifths through all the keys. that way you see what<br/>&gt;&gt;happens changing one tone at a time<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>Yep, good plan.</p><p>I really need to get a keyboard.  Right now,  I&apos;ve got a MAX patch where I<br/>play my typing &quot;QWERTY&quot; keyboard and it sends midi to my XV.  I pasted<br/>little white slips where the &quot;black keys&quot; should be.  Pretty low budget!!</p><p>Know of a good keyboard controller (only need a controller), with a wide<br/>range, good dynamics,  for cheap?</p><p> :D</p></div>
