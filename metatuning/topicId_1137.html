And, just<br/>because it&apos;s always been done, or lands, through history, have<br/>continually changed hands (which is correct), doesn&apos;t mean what happened<br/>here, or is still happening to tribal folks in Brazil, Indonesia,<br/>Borneo, and other places, is correct. As far as what happened/happens<br/>here, in what we now call America; all I know is that there were<br/>millions of folks here, with many nations and languages, and the white<br/>folks from Europe came over, took their lands rather unfairly, I<br/>believe, while destroying their cultures as much as they could. That, as<br/>we know, is history. And, it&apos;s pretty obvious that thus scenario<br/>happened all over the world, with the French, Belgians, Dutch, Spanish,<br/>and English (as well as others), pretty much taking the lands they<br/>wanted, with little regard for who was already living there. I am<br/>certainly aware that, before all this happened, those tribal folks were,<br/>undoubtedly, kicking the shit out of each other, as well. Fighting has<br/>long been a problem on this planet, and the Europeans did not invent it.<br/>I am aware I live on a land that was not originally the heritage of my<br/>own ancestral culture; yet, here I am, and I love this land, knowing<br/>that it was taken from others, who may well have been here for a long<br/>long time. What I feel I can do best, is try to be honest about what<br/>happened here, and speak the truth whenever possible...I truly feel that<br/>this is exactly what the Creator wants from me as an individual. If all<br/>folks do the same, I feel that wrongs can be righted, and honor<br/>restored. Maybe naive, but I&apos;m not sure what else one can do. And yes, I<br/>do believe we, as a nation, need to immediately address what has<br/>happened here; I do, indeed, believe we have a big karmic debt that<br/>needs to be resolved. How do we do it? Well, it took hundreds of years<br/>to screw everything up, so it won&apos;t happen overnight. The first step is<br/>just acknowledging what happened, and looking at it squarely in the<br/>face. We, as a nation, haven&apos;t even done that yet, so if that ever<br/>happens, then the next steps will come. And, my own deeply held beliefs<br/>are not always easily explainable, especially on a computer screen; I&apos;m<br/>sure it&apos;s the same for anybody. Probably the most basic belief I have is<br/>that which Jesus is reported to have said, when asked what the most<br/>important commandments were; love the Creator with all your heart, and<br/>then love your neighbor the same way...then, everything else will fall<br/>into place. Simple, yes, but it obviously hasn&apos;t been too easy on this<br/>Earth, or we wouldn&apos;t be in the mess we are now...let&apos;s keep these<br/>discussions going, I think it&apos;s very stimulating...Hstick</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/18/2001 8:24:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; just<br/>&gt; because it&apos;s always been done, or lands, through history, have<br/>&gt; continually changed hands (which is correct), doesn&apos;t mean what<br/>happened<br/>&gt; here, or is still happening to tribal folks in Brazil, Indonesia,<br/>&gt; Borneo, and other places, is correct.</p><p>You have complete agreement from me on that.</p><p>&gt; As far as what happened/happens<br/>&gt; here, in what we now call America; all I know is that there were<br/>&gt; millions of folks here, with many nations and languages, and the<br/>white<br/>&gt; folks from Europe came over, took their lands rather unfairly, I<br/>&gt; believe, while destroying their cultures as much as they could.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>&gt; What I feel I can do best, is try to be honest about what<br/>&gt; happened here, and speak the truth whenever possible...</p><p>Me too!</p><p>&gt; I truly feel that<br/>&gt; this is exactly what the Creator wants from me as an individual.

Quite<br/>intentional when a group calls another group of people<br/>savages and nonhumans, rants about their own racial<br/>superiority from the safety and comfort of their<br/>self-righteous plupits, declares war on them, pays<br/>people to kill off their food supply to the point of<br/>extinction, and intentionally deliver them<br/>&apos;humanitarian supplies from your friends in the US<br/>Army&apos; in the form of warm winter blankets laced with<br/>the bioweapon smallpox virus. This activity was much<br/>greater than, much more evil and sadistic, and much<br/>more successful than the acts committed by the German<br/>people during WWII. AS much as they could. And every<br/>person living in the US territory knew what was going<br/>on and did nothing whatsoever to stop it. There were no<br/>underground railroads or noble freedom fighters working<br/>behind the scenes to stop it. Everyone was in on it.<br/>And everyone involved and their descendents have blood<br/>on their hands.</p><p>Seems the more &apos;civilized&apos; people become with their<br/>technology and their uniforms and the pagentry and<br/>their self-righteous &apos;identity&apos; religious racism, the<br/>more brutal, dangerous and just plain evil they<br/>become. And the religion need not come from a church<br/>or mosque -- fanatical cult beliefs are taught just<br/>as effectively from the mouths of the media, the<br/>governments, the scientists, and in whatever other<br/>earthly authority and institutions man places his faith<br/>and thus worships as an idol.</p><p>--</p><p>Wanted to make the point about the lands that paying<br/>off Indians $10,000 each or $200,000 each or even<br/>$100 billion each will do nothing to solve the problem.<br/>Money needs to be paid but not to the Indians. The<br/>lands of 1/3 of each US state (not the junk toxic waste<br/>filled land but good arable land) needs to be returned<br/>to the tribes as land of their sovereign nations --<br/>each to be fully diplomatically recognized and offered<br/>membership in the UN. This land should be bought by the<br/>government and the current occupants resettled to new<br/>locations. Anything less will only contribute to more<br/>genocide against the tattered remains of what is left<br/>of our people and our culture. We must be free to live<br/>our lives and work our own land, completely free from<br/>any regulation or oversight by some corrupt paternal<br/>agency.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
