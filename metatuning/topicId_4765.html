Tens of thousands of<br/>teachers have received pink slips and looming budget deficits only<br/>promise worse to come.  Yet in Washington, Congress seems unaware<br/>of the problems at home.  They&apos;re talking about cutting taxes and<br/>cutting budgets -- not about how to keep the schools and essential<br/>services going.</p><p>The final vote on these budget cuts will come in just a few days, and<br/>we&apos;re leading a campaign to bring focus to who is getting hurt --<br/>especially to the cuts that will hurt our kids and fail our schools.</p><p>Please join us and sign a petition to Congress, asking key<br/>Congressional leaders to lead the fight against tax and budget cuts,<br/>and to save education and other basic services from drastic cuts.<br/>Just go to:</p><p>  <a href="http://www.moveon.org/saveschools/">http://www.moveon.org/saveschools/</a></p><p>With this petition, we&apos;re also collecting personal stories about the<br/>impact budget cuts have already had on schools in your area.  Tell<br/>Congress about teachers who have been fired, about schools closed,<br/>about the impact on your own children or grandchildren.  Instead of<br/>proposing a plan to support the states and our schools during this<br/>difficult time, the Bush administration is cutting back billions in<br/>federal support, just when it&apos;s most needed.  We&apos;ve got to expose<br/>the real-world pain of these cuts.</p><p>We&apos;ll deliver the petitions and the stories to key leaders in<br/>Congress who have the power to block this dangerous tax bill.</p><p>Help us highlight what&apos;s at stake at</p><p>  <a href="http://www.moveon.org/saveschools/">http://www.moveon.org/saveschools/</a></p><p>This petition is part of a seven day countdown campaign, called the<br/>&quot;Countdown to Budget Disaster&quot;, leading up to the final vote.</p><p>In the past, the administration has succeeded in framing budget<br/>negotiations in terms of the size of a tax cut.  Of course, this a<br/>continuation of the right-wing strategy of forcing historic program<br/>cuts by driving the U.S. budget into deep deficit.  This ideological<br/>maneuver may be good political strategy, but it&apos;s terrible policy.<br/>It&apos;s time to fight back.</p><p>Critiques based on sound economic policy have largely fallen on deaf<br/>ears.  Even Alan Greenspan objects to tax cuts, yet Congress continues<br/>to argue over the size of cuts.  We have ignored the vast pain that<br/>will result from a crippled federal government.  This pain is already<br/>beginning to bubble up from across the nation.  It&iuml;&iquest;&half;s time to connect<br/>the dots.  It&iuml;&iquest;&half;s time to focus on the pain, and to lay responsibility<br/>for this pain on Bush and the right-wing ideologues.</p><p>Our campaign will be a daily drumbeat, in the midst of congressional<br/>debate on the budget.  Each day will focus on a different kind of<br/>pain, and highlight who is gaining by these cuts and how.  We will<br/>lay bare the costs of blind ideology -- to our children, to our<br/>elders and to ourselves.</p><p>Thank you for your support.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>-Wes Boyd<br/> <a href="http://MoveOn.org">MoveOn.org</a><br/> May 6th, 2003</p><p>P.S.  I&apos;ve attached Senator Jeffords May 3 radio address on the budget<br/>cuts below.  He summarizes the situation very well.<br/>_____</p><p>Saturday, May 3, 2003<br/>SENATOR JIM JEFFORDS DELIVERS THE<br/>WEEKLY DEMOCRATIC RADIO ADDRESS<br/>                                                &#x9;<br/>Hello, this is Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont.</p><p>Two years ago this month I made my decision to leave the Republican<br/>Party and become an Independent.   One reason I made that change was<br/>that I felt the Republican Party that I knew, and grew up with, had<br/>changed its priorities dramatically.  Those changed priorities were best<br/>exemplified by President Bush&apos;s insistence on a budget that<br/>short-changed so many of our national needs: education and special<br/>education; health care and prescription drugs for our elderly,<br/>environmental protection; and, importantly, deficit reduction.</p><p>It is now two years later, and it seems that we&apos;re having the same<br/>debate again.  The President is again proposing a budget that does not<br/>adequately fund America&apos;s needs and includes new tax breaks that are<br/>likely to force disastrous cuts in urgent national programs, and create<br/>horrendous future deficits.  And again, those who are expressing their<br/>reservations are being vilified for taking stands of conscience.  This<br/>happened in 2001 when I made my decision to leave the Republican party,<br/>and it is sad for me to watch it happen again.  When did standing on<br/>principle, speaking your conscience and representing your constituents<br/>become unacceptable in certain Republican circles?</p><p>When he was pushing for the first tax cut, President Bush said that we<br/>could do it all, we could afford a tax cut, make investments in our<br/>national priorities, and still have money left over to pay down the<br/>debt.  Time has proven those words wrong, and we have massive job losses<br/>and a soaring deficit to show for it.  After the President&apos;s proposal<br/>was reduced, I supported the 2001 tax cut.   That was a mistake, one I<br/>will not make again.</p><p>Now, those needs I spoke of two years ago have become even more<br/>pressing, and we face the new challenges of protecting America and<br/>fighting a war against terror.  President Bush has said that his plan is<br/>a, &quot;jobs growth package.&quot;  But the only thing guaranteed to grow is the<br/>federal budget deficit, something Republicans used to care about, and I<br/>still do.  We will be paying for these tax cuts with borrowed funds,<br/>money borrowed from our children and grandchildren who will be forced to<br/>foot the bill.  And these deficits will explode just as the baby boom<br/>generation begins to retire, further endangering the health of Social<br/>Security and Medicare, both of which are so critically important to our<br/>seniors.</p><p>Perhaps more importantly, the President&apos;s plan doesn&apos;t benefit the<br/>people who need it most.  In my home state of Vermont, 2,200 people have<br/>lost their jobs.  Many who are lucky enough to have jobs are just barely<br/>scraping by.  What will this plan do for them?  Well, two-thirds of<br/>Vermont taxpayers will get a tax cut of less than $100.  Yet, someone<br/>who makes a million dollars a year will get a tax cut of $90,000.</p><p>This fervor for tax breaks at the expense of all else demonstrates that<br/>there are some who see tax cuts not as a policy, but as a theology.<br/>Their belief that tax cuts will solve any problem is uncompromising,<br/>unyielding, and, sadly, undeterred by past experience.  Our goal should<br/>not be a tax cut for the sake of a tax cut, especially one that gives<br/>most of its benefits to a very few people.  Our goal should be a policy<br/>that puts Americans back to work, gets our economy growing and keeps us<br/>on the right track for future generations.</p><p>What should we do to boost our ailing economy and help those Americans<br/>most in need?  We should start by extending unemployment insurance<br/>benefits, currently scheduled to expire at the end of May.  More than<br/>100,000 additional jobs were lost in March, and the overall number of<br/>jobs fell to a 40-month low.  We should help the states, which are<br/>facing the worst budget crisis in 50 years.   To close budget deficits,<br/>some states are cutting back school days, eliminating effective early<br/>education programs and eliminating health insurance coverage for our<br/>neediest families.  We should support programs that encourage job<br/>creation, like boosting federal spending to improve our nation&apos;s highway<br/>system, money we are going to have to spend someday anyway.  According<br/>to the U.S. Department of Transportation, 47,000 jobs are created for<br/>every billion dollars spent on our highways and bridges.</p><p>That is the approach I support.  Millions of Americans need help.  Yet,<br/>the President insists on a tax cut that hurts those who need help most,<br/>and helps those who need it least.  In Vermont we take care of our own,<br/>and as a nation we should do the same.</p><p>This is Jim Jeffords, Independent Senator of Vermont, thanks for<br/>listening.<br/>_____</p></div>
