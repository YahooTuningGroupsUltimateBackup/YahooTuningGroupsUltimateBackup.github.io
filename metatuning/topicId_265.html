The xed... address is really his,<br/>and he really was a member of practicalmicrotonality and<br/>he really did submit those long posts loaded with challenges<br/>and criticisms.

How about CC-ing it to Crazy Music, since that seems to be the<br/>accepted replacement for PM?  And/or to Tuning-challenges, since<br/>that&apos;s the one Brian was specifically invited to rejoin (ah-huh, in<br/>more than one way!).
