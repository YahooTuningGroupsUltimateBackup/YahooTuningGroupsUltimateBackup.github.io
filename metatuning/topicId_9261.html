Religion does not. except Buddhism, which is<br/>hardly a religion. The Dalai Lama has said, quite admirably, that if Buddhist<br/>scriptures disagree with the findings of modern science, the scriptures<br/>should be changed. That&apos;s a refreshing view!</p><p>Let me also point out that the Biblical way of life would not allow us to be<br/>having this cyber-conversation. Science and tecnology allow that.

Religion is founded on the same search for truth<br/>&gt; that &quot;we all&quot; (I hope) undertake at some point, just like<br/>&gt; science.</p><p>Oh, yeah, check out this search for truth from &apos;Leviticus&apos;:</p><p>1:8  And the priests, Aaron&apos;s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the<br/>fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:<br/>1:9 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall<br/>burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of<br/>&quot;a sweet savour unto the LORD&quot;.<br/>1:10 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the<br/>goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.<br/>1:11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD:<br/>and the priests, Aaron&apos;s sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the<br/>altar. &quot;Kill and sprinkle blood round about.&quot;<br/>1:12 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the<br/>priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon<br/>the altar: (1:12-13) &quot;Cut it into pieces and burn it for a sweet savour unto<br/>the Lord.&quot;<br/>1:13 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest<br/>shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an<br/>offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.<br/>1:14 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls, then<br/>he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.<br/>1:15 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and<br/>burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of<br/>the altar: &quot;Wring off its head and burn it.&quot;<br/>1:16 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside<br/>the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:<br/>1:17 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it<br/>asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is<br/>upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet<br/>savour unto the LORD.</p><p>...detestble stuff, that.</p><p>&gt; A religion is not a political philosophy any more than a science<br/>&gt; is.  Now, a &quot;church&quot; or a &quot;scientific institute&quot;<br/>&gt; probably DOES have<br/>&gt; a political philosophy, and the need to gain and retain some form of<br/>&gt; power, ie domination of some group of people.</p><p>I think this al depends on the practitioners. History shows clearly that<br/>scientists tend to be reasonable people too busy with their own reserach to<br/>be bothered with power-play. I&apos;m sure there are exceptions.</p><p>OTOH, no religion (with the exception of Buddhism, which, again, is hardly a<br/>&apos;religion&apos;) was ever born without tremendous drive to subjugate and corral<br/>its human subjects towards brainwashing, and no-where is this more true than<br/>in the history of the Christian denominations. And now witness the violence<br/>with which fundamentalist Islam clings to its&apos; 11th century vies for dear<br/>life! What threats and punishments were/are piled on to disbelievers!!! I<br/>judge religions in inverse proportion to their advocacy of violence: Buddhism<br/>comes out on top (no where, and we all know who&apos;s on the bottom.</p><p>I challenge you to come up with a single case of a murder of a human being<br/>being committed *by a scientist* in the name of scientific truth. I&apos;m sure<br/>somewhere it exists, but compare that tend with what we know about religious<br/>violence.</p><p>The number of murders of of humans by humans in the name of some religious<br/>view, however, is *so* large, stretching as it does back into the mists of<br/>pre-history.</p><p>&gt; It is thus set up to<br/>&gt; be ripe for abuse.  I don&apos;t think religion OR<br/>&gt; science is exempt from blame in the kind of shitty politics you<br/>&gt; describe.  In the form of churches and institutions, for sure, no?<br/>&gt; How long has it been since &quot;scientists&quot; stopped trying to prove<br/>&gt; racial inferiorities?  I don&apos;t think they have, or it&apos;s only been<br/>&gt; about a minute.</p><p>Well, the truth is, all the races appear *not* to be created equally. How far<br/>you take that is a political question, not a scientific one.</p><p>For example, certain black africans have been shown to be better built for<br/>long-distance sprinting. The jury may still be out on intellectual prowess,<br/>etc. but I&apos;m doubtful personally that the differences are truly significant,<br/>and can mostly be attributed to cultural/economic factors.</p><p>&gt; And by the way, was it shitty science, or mad religion that led to<br/>&gt; the destruction of New Orleans?  The mad religion of materialism,<br/>&gt; perhaps?</p><p>It was shitty everything, led by the blind eye of the incompetent Republican<br/>party under George W. Bush.</p><p>&gt; I have tremendous respect for the strength of your convictions, in<br/>&gt; any case.  I think agnostics are kinda lame, too.</p><p>Well, I was only joking....I try not to think anyone is &apos;lame&apos;, even if they<br/>are.</p><p>In truth, I think, like Chris pointed out, agnosticism is the only really<br/>truly consistent view: we know so little about the universe.</p><p>To that, I would add: we also know enough to know when something goes against<br/>what we know in a ridiculous way (the Bible), and that meaningless questions<br/>(does God exist?) don&apos;t really have meaningful answers.</p><p>Take it as you will, but statistics aso show that the higher your IQ, the less<br/>likely you are to believe in god(s), or be agnostic or disinterested on the<br/>matter. this will doubtless make some people angry to hear, but statistics is<br/>studying the universe *as it is*, not as we wish it to be: that&apos;s the realm<br/>of morality.</p><p>&gt; And I think Messiaen will forgive you as well, hee!</p><p>I think he doesn&apos;t really exist anymore to care!</p><p>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pete</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron.</p></div><h3>ambassadorbob &#x3C;peteysan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2005 9:38:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson<br/>&lt;aaron@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On Friday 30 September 2005 2:58 am, ambassadorbob wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;aaron@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have tremendous respect for the strength of your convictions,<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; any case.

Can I take them on &quot;faith&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No belief is &quot;reasonable&quot; IMO, it&apos;s just a comfort zone<br/>&gt; for this or<br/>&gt; that person, who may or may not be hostile to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t feel the need to believe in science OR god(s)/religion,<br/>&gt; if<br/>&gt; you must know.  I think they&apos;re both human, both fallible, and<br/>&gt; both<br/>&gt; potentially extremely pathological.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Look at the state of the science of mass murder in this country.<br/>&gt; Them boys are rockin&apos; to the tune of $500 billion a year for so-<br/>&gt; called defense.  Defense against what?  Hunger?  Ignorance?<br/>&gt; Disease?  Nope.  Against &quot;heresy&quot;, I think.  Certainly not<br/>&gt; against<br/>&gt; bullshit!</p><p>No offense, but there seems to be little understading of what science<br/>is demonstrated here. Especially in thie last paragraph. I&apos;ll<br/>probably have more to say about this in a subsequent post. Science?<br/>No president of the U.S. has ever been as universally reviled by<br/>scientists as the current one. Bush is the anti-science president,<br/>and this is the consensus of scientists:</p><p><a href="http://www.votenader.org/issues/index.php?cid=121">http://www.votenader.org/issues/index.php?cid=121</a></p><p>&gt; How long has it been since &quot;scientists&quot; stopped trying to prove<br/>&gt; racial inferiorities?  I don&apos;t think they have, or it&apos;s only been<br/>&gt; about a minute.</p><p>Where do you get your information, pray tell? Your statement may be<br/>true of some isolated, fringe &quot;scientists&quot; but is certainly not true<br/>of scientists in general.</p><p>To address your other point, neither religion nor science need greedy<br/>institutions in order to exist. The difference is repeatability.<br/>Anyone can repeat Galileo&apos;s or Newton&apos;s experiments themselves and<br/>they will obtain the same result, without the need for any<br/>institution or previous knowledge of that result. A false scientific<br/>theory will eventually run up against the evidence, and will<br/>therefore have to be abandoned (as science, at least). Meanwhile,<br/>different religions disagree with one another fundamentally, in ways<br/>that mere observation cannot reconcile. You can&apos;t run an experiment<br/>to resolve the disagreement. But you can&apos;t let your children be<br/>taught beliefs contrary to your own! This makes the history of<br/>religion &quot;interesting&quot;, to use a euphemism for massive wars and<br/>genocides.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2005 6:12:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ambassadorbob&quot; &lt;peteysan@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; My<br/>&gt; observation has been that scientists are the worst when it comes to<br/>&gt; admitting we don&apos;t know.</p><p>If so, the scientists you&apos;ve met aren&apos;t very good ones.

Say what you will, the act of<br/>killing millions with a disease (is that what you meant?) or a bomb<br/>is not &quot;science&quot; by any stretch of the imagination. Scientists who<br/>commit atrocious actions are morally responsible for them; neither<br/>they nor you can blame &quot;science&quot; as if that was some sort of sentient<br/>entity governing their actions or some sort of dogma endorsing<br/>murder. Those who worked on *engineering* and *building* the bomb<br/>(note: not science) had their motivations to do so, whether<br/>nationalistic brainwashing, a desire to defeat forces that had<br/>suppressed them in the past, or perhaps something more insiduous.<br/>Plenty of people in the world are working on the bomb today but you<br/>can&apos;t say that that they&apos;re doing so because they&apos;re morally<br/>disinterested and &quot;science is above right or wrong&quot; and dropping the<br/>bomb would be a scientific thing to do -- come on now.
