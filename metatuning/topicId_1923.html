Who<br/>reads it?  Probably the same people who are reading this list.  Maybe<br/>a few other &quot;academic&quot; types, but I doubt many.</p><p>It will mostly be for sale at places like the &quot;Microthons&quot; etc. and<br/>go to the same people who read the lists.  Maybe Paul would get it<br/>published and on <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, but it wouldn&apos;t be a big seller<br/>like &quot;Temperament&quot; unless Paul were willing to put a lot of BS in it,<br/>and that&apos;s not his style.</p><p>So maybe the *interactive* communication we are having over the<br/>Internet is *just* as important as writing books...</p><p>Or putting things on the Web like Monz does.  Possibly this is a<br/>*newer* way of conveying information, and even *interactively!*</p><p>Just a &quot;devil&apos;s advocate&quot; positioning...</p><p>jp</p></div>
