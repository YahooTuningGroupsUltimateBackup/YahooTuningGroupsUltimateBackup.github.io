They had a notebook containing information<br/>about the &quot;American base in Turkey&quot;, &quot;Alia Airport&quot; in Jordan and the<br/>&quot;American foreign minister&quot;, legal documents state. The three, Ahmed Hanna,<br/>33, Karim Koubriti, 23, and Farouk Ali-Halmoud, 21, from Morocco and<br/>Algeria, worked at Detroit Metropolitan Airport preparing food for airlines.</p><p>FBI agents stumbled across the trio while searching the address of Habil<br/>al-Marabh, a suspected associate of the World Trade Centre hijackers. The<br/>Arabs said that they did not know him. They have been charged with<br/>conspiracy and having false immigration papers.</p><p>The FBI is concentrating its energies on deterring more attacks this<br/>Saturday. &quot;Yes, we have heard something about September 22 but nothing<br/>specific,&quot; an investigative source told America&apos;s Knight Ridder news<br/>service.</p><p>&quot;We have information that leads us to believe that there could be more<br/>attacks very soon. The same murky sources that indicated something might be<br/>happening in the weeks before the attacks have indicated something may be<br/>happening this weekend.&quot;</p><p>Bob Graham, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that the New<br/>York and Washington suicide strikes were &quot;part of a larger plan with other<br/>terrorism acts, not necessarily the hijacking of airplanes&quot;.</p><p>The FBI has issued a &quot;watch list&quot; of 223 people suspected of being<br/>associates of the hijackers. Nearly a quarter of the people on the list are<br/>able to fly aircraft.</p><p>------------</p><p>NHNE News List:</p><p>To subscribe, send a message to:<br/><a href="mailto:nhnenews-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">nhnenews-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a></p><p>To unsubscribe, send a message to:<br/><a href="mailto:nhnenews-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">nhnenews-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a></p><p>To review current posts:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nhnenews/messages">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nhnenews/messages</a></p><p>Published by NewHeavenNewEarth (NHNE)<br/>eMail: nhne@...<br/>NHNE Website: <a href="http://www.nhne.com/">http://www.nhne.com/</a><br/>Phone: (928) 282-6120<br/>Fax: (815) 346-1492</p><p>Appreciate what we are doing?<br/>You can say so with a tax-deductible donation:<br/><a href="http://www.nhne.com/main/donations.html">http://www.nhne.com/main/donations.html</a></p><p>P.O.
