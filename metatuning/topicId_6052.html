Is it OK to leave the<br/>chargeable battery in the unit?  I suppose it&apos;s like most devices and<br/>maybe it should be taken out if the unit is not used for a long<br/>period of time, but otherwise it&apos;s OK to leave it in...  Correct?  (I<br/>couldn&apos;t find the answer to that question anywhere in the manual).</p><p>They seem quite obsessed with recording in &quot;groups&quot; of tracks.  I<br/>haven&apos;t tried to get that to work, yet, but it seems somewhat<br/>superfluous, inless one really wanted to number tracks of various<br/>pilfered CD albums... I haven&apos;t done that yet.</p><p>I also had a question about the *REMOTE.*  It seems one cannot start<br/>recording or set recording levels from that, yes?  It seems more like<br/>a convenience unit for playback, say if the main unit is in a<br/>backpack or such like, and you want to adjust the order and volume of<br/>playback tracks.  However, I don&apos;t believe you can set it to start<br/>recording or set recording levels.  Correct?</p><p>In that case, I don&apos;t think there is much point in using the remote.<br/>Is that right, Jon?</p><p>It sure sounds Sharp... (couldn&apos;t resist), but I haven&apos;t tried it<br/>extensively on music yet, although with some rehearsals coming up, it<br/>won&apos;t be too long...</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joe P.</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2003 9:41:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>Sorry for the delay - I&apos;m not having much time for lists, and it is going to get even less for the forseeable future.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Well, I have the little minidisk player Sharp MD-DR7 or MD-DR480H (I<br/>&gt; can&apos;t figure out why they can&apos;t decide which model number it is!)</p><p>Try and think a little more globally: the DR7 model is what is sold in the Asian market, the DR480 is for the European market; there are some very minor differences in packaging and contents.</p><p>&gt; It works just great so far, and there is no problem getting it into<br/>&gt; my computer, although the output plug is a little &quot;funky&quot; with *four*<br/>&gt; sections, and hence needs an adaptor (which they supply) to three.</p><p>If you read about it, it isn&apos;t funky: there are four lines to enable the newer generation of headphone output/input, to more discretely separate the 2 channels of audio.</p><p>&gt; Jon, I have one question about the battery.

There is one reason I might use one: if you keep the remote plugged into the output jack, you avoid plugging and unplugging the headphones/line-out mini-plug into that jack, and one of the most common things is to have those jacks go bad. I usually use either a line like that remote, or even an angled adaptor that *stays* plugged in, and you plug your line/phones into *that*. That way the wear and tear is on the remote/adaptor, and not the plug that is built into the unit.</p><p>&gt; It sure sounds Sharp... (couldn&apos;t resist), but I haven&apos;t tried it<br/>&gt; extensively on music yet, although with some rehearsals coming up, it<br/>&gt; won&apos;t be too long...</p><p>Try it with your mic and see how you like it. I think you&apos;ll be pleased, and if you got the DR7 you&apos;ve got lots of recording time on that internal battery and one very small and elegant recorder to record with. I bought one of those little LED &apos;flashlights&apos; that they sell for a couple of bucks to hang on a key chain so you can see your door lock (I got a red colored one to reduced it&apos;s &quot;visibility&quot;) and I use that, with a quick pinch to turn it on, to see the bar graph levels if I am going to record in a place where there is little or no visible light. Naturally, that is one of the nice features of the red LED lights on the old Walkman Pro cassette...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2003 5:52:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/6057">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/6057</a></p><p>&gt; Joe,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry for the delay - I&apos;m not having much time for lists, and it is<br/>going to get even less for the forseeable future.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Thanks, Jon, for the response.
