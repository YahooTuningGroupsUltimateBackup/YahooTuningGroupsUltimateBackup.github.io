Byrd<br/> October 17, 2003<br/> The Emperor Has No Clothes</p><p> In 1837, Danish author, Hans Christian Andersen, wrote a wonderful<br/>fairy tale which<br/> he titled The Emperor&apos;s New Clothes.  It may be the very first example<br/>of the power<br/> of political correctness.  It is the story of the Ruler of a distant<br/>land who was so<br/> enamored of his appearance and his clothing that he had a different<br/>suit for every<br/> hour of the day.</p><p> One day two rogues arrived in town, claiming to be gifted weavers.<br/>They convinced<br/> the Emperor that they could weave the most wonderful cloth, which had a<br/>magical<br/> property.  The clothes were only visible to those who were completely<br/>pure in heart<br/> and spirit.</p><p> The Emperor was impressed and ordered the weavers to begin work<br/>immediately.<br/> The rogues, who had a deep understanding of human nature, began to<br/>feign work<br/> on empty looms.</p><p> Minister after minister went to view the new clothes and all came back<br/>exhorting the<br/> beauty of the cloth on the looms even though none of them could see a<br/>thing.</p><p> Finally a grand procession was planned for the Emperor to display his<br/>new finery.<br/> The Emperor went to view his clothes and was shocked to see absolutely<br/>nothing,<br/> but he pretended to admire the fabulous cloth, inspect the clothes with<br/>awe, and,<br/> after disrobing, go through the motions of carefully putting on a suit<br/>of the new<br/> garments.</p><p> Under a royal canopy the Emperor appeared to the admiring throng of his<br/>people - -<br/> all of whom cheered and clapped because they all knew the rogue<br/>weavers&apos; tale<br/> and did not want to be seen as less than pure of heart.</p><p> But, the bubble burst when an innocent child loudly exclaimed, for the<br/>whole<br/> kingdom to hear, that the Emperor had nothing on at all.  He had no<br/>clothes.</p><p> That tale seems to me very like the way this nation was led to war.</p><p> We were told that we were threatened by weapons of mass destruction in<br/>Iraq, but<br/> they have not been seen.</p><p> We were told that the throngs of Iraqi&apos;s would welcome our troops with<br/>flowers, but<br/> no throngs or flowers appeared.</p><p> We were led to believe that Saddam Hussein was connected to the attack<br/>on the<br/> Twin Towers and the Pentagon, but no evidence has ever been produced.</p><p> We were told in 16 words that Saddam Hussein tried to buy &quot;yellow cake&quot;<br/>from<br/> Africa for production of nuclear weapons, but the story has turned into<br/>empty air.</p><p> We were frightened with visions of mushroom clouds, but they turned out<br/>to be only<br/> vapors of the mind.</p><p> We were told that major combat was over but 101 [as of October 17]<br/>Americans<br/> have died in combat since that proclamation from the deck of an<br/>aircraft carrier by<br/> our very own Emperor in his new clothes.</p><p> Our emperor says that we are not occupiers, yet we show no inclination<br/>to relinquish<br/> the country of Iraq to its people.</p><p> Those who have dared to expose the nakedness of the Administration&apos;s<br/>policies in<br/> Iraq have been subjected to scorn. Those who have noticed the elephant<br/>in the<br/> room -- that is, the fact that this war was based on falsehoods ? have<br/>had our<br/> patriotism questioned.   Those who have spoken aloud the thought shared<br/>by<br/> hundreds of thousands of military families across this country, that<br/>our troops should<br/> return quickly and safely from the dangers half a world away, have been<br/>accused of<br/> cowardice.  We have then seen the untruths, the dissembling, the<br/>fabrication, the<br/> misleading inferences surrounding this rush to war in Iraq wrapped<br/>quickly in the<br/> flag.</p><p> The right to ask questions, debate, and dissent is under attack.  The<br/>drums of war<br/> are beaten ever louder in an attempt to drown out those who speak of<br/>our<br/> predicament in stark terms.</p><p> Even in the Senate, our history and tradition of being the world&apos;s<br/>greatest<br/> deliberative body is being snubbed.  This huge spending bill has been<br/>rushed<br/> through this chamber in just one month.  There were just three open<br/>hearings by<br/> the Senate Appropriations Committee on $87 billion, without a single<br/>outside witness<br/> called to challenge the Administration&apos;s line.</p><p> Ambassador Bremer went so far as to refuse to return to the<br/>Appropriations<br/> Committee to answer additional questions because, and I quote: &quot;I don&apos;t<br/>have time.<br/> I&apos;m completely booked, and I have to get back to Baghdad to my duties.&quot;</p><p> Despite this callous stiff-arm of the Senate and its duties to ask<br/>questions in order to<br/> represent the American people, few dared to voice their opposition to<br/>rushing this<br/> bill through these halls of Congress.  Perhaps they were intimidated by<br/>the false<br/> claims that our troops are in immediate need of more funds.</p><p> But the time has come for the sheep-like political correctness which<br/>has cowed<br/> members of this Senate to come to an end.</p><p> The Emperor has no clothes.  This entire adventure in Iraq has been<br/>based on<br/> propaganda and manipulation.  Eighty-seven billion dollars is too much<br/>to pay for<br/> the continuation of a war based on falsehoods.</p><p> Taking the nation to war based on misleading rhetoric and hyped<br/>intelligence is a<br/> travesty and a tragedy.  It is the most cynical of all cynical acts.<br/>It is dangerous to<br/> manipulate the truth.  It is dangerous because once having lied, it is<br/>difficult to ever<br/> be believed again.  Having misled the American people and stampeded<br/>them to<br/> war, this Administration must now attempt to sustain a policy<br/>predicated on<br/> falsehoods.  The President asks for billions from those same citizens<br/>who know that<br/> they were misled about the need to go to war.  We misinformed and<br/>insulted our<br/> friends and allies and now this Administration is having more than a<br/>little trouble<br/> getting help from the international community.  It is perilous to<br/>mislead.</p><p> The single-minded obsession of this Administration to now make sense of<br/>the chaos<br/> in Iraq, and the continuing propaganda which emanates from the White<br/>House<br/> painting Iraq as the geographical center of terrorism is distracting<br/>our attention from<br/> Afghanistan and the 60 other countries in the world where terrorists<br/>hide.  It is<br/> sapping resources which could be used to make us safer from terrorists<br/>on our own<br/> shores.  The body armor for our own citizens still has many, many<br/>chinks.  Have we<br/> forgotten that the most horrific terror attacks in history occurred<br/>right here at home!!<br/> Yet, this Administration turns back money for homeland security, while<br/>the President<br/> pours billions into security for Iraq.  I am powerless to understand or<br/>explain such a<br/> policy.</p><p> I have tried mightily to improve this bill.  I twice tried to separate<br/>the reconstruction<br/> money in this bill, so that those dollars could be considered<br/>separately from the<br/> military spending.  I offered an amendment to force the Administration<br/>to craft a plan<br/> to get other nations to assist the troops and formulate a plan to get<br/>the U.N. in, and<br/> the U.S. out, of Iraq.  Twice I tried to rid the bill of expansive,<br/>flexible authorities that<br/> turn this $87 billion into a blank check.  The American people should<br/>understand<br/> that we provide more foreign aid for Iraq in this bill, $20.3 billion,<br/>than we provide for<br/> the rest of the entire world!   I attempted to remove from this bill<br/>billions in wasteful<br/> programs and divert those funds to better use.  But, at every turn, my<br/>efforts were<br/> thwarted by the vapid argument that we must all support the requests of<br/>the<br/> Commander in Chief.</p><p> I cannot stand by and continue to watch our grandchildren become<br/>increasingly<br/> burdened by  the billions that fly out of the Treasury for a war and a<br/>policy based<br/> largely on propaganda and prevarication.  We are borrowing $87 billion<br/>to finance<br/> this adventure in Iraq.  The President is asking this Senate to pay for<br/>this war with<br/> increased debt, a debt that will have to be paid by our children and by<br/>those same<br/> troops that are currently fighting this war.  I cannot support<br/>outlandish tax cuts that<br/> plunge our country into potentially disastrous debt while our troops<br/>are fighting and<br/> dying in a war that the White House chose to begin.</p><p> I cannot support the continuation of a policy that unwisely ties down<br/>150,000<br/> American troops for the foreseeable future, with no end in sight.</p><p> I cannot support a President who refuses to authorize the reasonable<br/>change in<br/> course that would bring traditional allies to our side in Iraq.</p><p> I cannot support the politics of zeal and &quot;might makes right&quot; that<br/>created the new<br/> American arrogance and unilateralism which passes for foreign policy in<br/>this<br/> Administration.</p><p> I cannot support this foolish manifestation of the dangerous and<br/>destabilizing<br/> doctrine of preemption that changes the image of America into that of a<br/>reckless<br/> bully.</p><p> The emperor has no clothes.  And our former allies around the world<br/>were the first<br/> to loudly observe it.</p><p> I shall vote against this bill because I cannot support a policy based<br/>on<br/> prevarication.  I cannot support doling out 87 billion of our<br/>hard-earned tax dollars<br/> when I have so many doubts about the wisdom of its use.</p><p> I began my remarks with a fairy tale.  I shall close my remarks with a<br/>horror story, in<br/> the form of a quote from the book Nuremberg Diaries, written by G.M.<br/>Gilbert, in<br/> which the author interviews Hermann Goering.</p><p> &quot;We got around to the subject of war again and I said that, contrary to<br/>his attitude, I<br/> did not think that the common people are very thankful for leaders who<br/>bring them<br/> war and destruction.</p><p> &quot;. . . But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine<br/>the policy and it is<br/> always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a<br/>democracy or a<br/> fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.</p><p> &quot;There is one difference,&quot; I pointed out. &quot;In a democracy the people<br/>have some say<br/> in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United<br/>States only<br/> Congress can declare wars.&quot;</p><p> &quot;Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can<br/>always be<br/> brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do<br/>is tell them<br/> they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of<br/>patriotism and<br/> exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.&quot;<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2003 1:17:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, kraig grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Remarks by U.S. Senator Robert C.
