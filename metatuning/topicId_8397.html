If this mail look<br/>like scam to you delete it, we are looking for serious minded person.</p><p>As we all know, top officials do loot funds out of the country with<br/>non-residence<br/>foreigners. When they try and fail, the world hears it as fraud/scam, but<br/>when they go through, nobody or a newspaper writes it.</p><p>This trade is huge here and people are making lots of money out there in<br/>most foreign countries. Though the government are mapping out sophisticated<br/>strategies to checkmate unauthorized dealers. From the president to the<br/>cleaner in the house, they are all into this trade. Go and read about<br/>Abacha,the<br/>former late head of state. Even the so-called present head is still in it.</p><p>Most foreigners residing in Nigeria camouflage under corporate bodies,while<br/>they collaborate with top government officials to aid in these<br/>things.Opportune<br/>average officials in our various sectors with out much connection to bring<br/>in foreigners to establish first could only build such relationship through<br/>mail etc.</p><p>That I am trying to do.</p><p>The point I am making is nothing more than asking you to handle a pure deal<br/>of approximately USD$50,000,000.00, which will take approximately two weeks<br/>to conclude from here. Then the funds clear in any account of yours after<br/>72hrs upon the remittance.</p><p>We can only work with a group head or the CEO/Managing director, who possess<br/>the credibility to defend the funds with every solid reputation. Though<br/>we must have to secure all relevant documents to define origin and legitimacy<br/>of funds.</p><p>If you could assist us, kindly reach me via this email so we could further<br/>discuss the modalities of this deal.</p><p>I await your urgent response via the email:chrisemeka@...</p><p>Regards,<br/>Dr. Chris Emeka</p></div><h3><a id=8398 href="#8398">ðŸ”—</a>Mats &#xD6;ljare &#x3C;oljare@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/2004 10:12:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>HOW exactly did this end up here?
