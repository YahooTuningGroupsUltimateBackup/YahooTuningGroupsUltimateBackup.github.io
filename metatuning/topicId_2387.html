Palestinians go door to door, shooting Jews.<br/>They shoot a 5 year old girl in the head point blank.<br/>They shoot a woman. Etc. All civilians.</p><p>I suppose we can feel sorry for the Palestitians and we<br/>can feel sorry for the Nazis and we can feel sory for<br/>Pol Pot&apos;s gang but at some point we are going to have<br/>to put an end to this sh*t because it is evil. No Jews<br/>have evr gone door to door shooting civilians because<br/>of their race. This latest crime by the Plaestinians is<br/>not justifiable. It is not understandable. It is a<br/>crime against humanity. It is part of the Arabic<br/>genocide campaign against the Jews. It is time to put<br/>an end to it.</p><p>- J</p><p>----</p><p>Palestinians Kill 4 Jewish Settlers</p><p>Sat Apr 27,10:23 AM ET</p><p>By SUSAN SEVAREID, Associated Press Writer</p><p>JERUSALEM (AP) - Palestinian gunmen disguised as<br/>soldiers slipped into an Israeli settlement in the West<br/>Bank on Saturday and went from house to house, shooting<br/>residents in their bedrooms and killing four people,<br/>including a 5-year-old girl, the army said.</p><p>One or more attackers cut through the defensive<br/>perimeter fence of the Adora settlement, west of<br/>Hebron, entered a house and shot a couple in their<br/>bedroom, killing a woman. In the upstairs bedroom of<br/>the next home, they killed the girl and wounded her<br/>mother and two younger brothers, the army and survivors<br/>said.</p><p>At least seven people were wounded in the attack, which<br/>began around 9 a.m. The attackers disappeared, said Lt.<br/>Gen. Amos Ben Avraham.</p><p>It was the worst attack on a West Bank settlement since<br/>Israeli forces punched into the area on March 29 in an<br/>operation to hunt down Palestinian militants. The Adora<br/>killings ratcheted up tensions after Israel withdrew<br/>from several main towns last week and negotiations were<br/>progressing to resolve two long standoffs.</p><p>Overnight, Israeli troops withdrew from Qalqiliya, a<br/>town in the northern West Bank, after a daylong<br/>incursion. As it withdrew, the army underlined that it<br/>would enter any areas &quot;it feels necessary in order to<br/>thwart terrorist activity.&quot;</p><p>After the Adora attack, Israeli troops launched a<br/>large-scale manhunt in the Hebron region on Saturday,<br/>searching Taffuh, the closest Palestinian village. In<br/>Hebron, Palestinian security officers abandoned their<br/>buildings, expecting an Israeli reprisal.</p><p>Israeli troops conducted a house-to-house search in<br/>Adora, fearing that at least one gunman may be hiding<br/>and holding hostages. But they found no one.</p><p>Many of the settlers were attending Sabbath prayers in<br/>the synagogue when the attack began. Some rushed to the<br/>area to confront the infiltrators but were unable to<br/>find them, Avraham said.</p><p>Yaakov Shefi, the father of the slain girl, was in the<br/>synagogue and rushed home when he heard the shots.<br/>Shefi, a policeman, said his wife was sitting with<br/>their daughter and two sons, aged 4 and 1, when the<br/>gunmen broke into the room and sprayed them with<br/>gunfire.</p><p>&quot;She remembers pushing the children under the bed. She<br/>said, &apos;Be quiet and don&apos;t cry, so that they don&apos;t come<br/>back,&apos;&quot; Shefi said.</p><p>Anat Harari said the gunman shot at her through the<br/>kitchen window, wounding her in the shoulder. She fled<br/>to the bathroom, where she phoned her parents on her<br/>mobile phone.</p><p>&quot;I am on the floor, bleeding in a pool of blood, in the<br/>bathroom. I stay on the phone with my parents. I am<br/>talking to my parents without stopping. I tell them<br/>what is going on. I tell them, it&apos;s not the army, it&apos;s<br/>terrorists in disguise. And I wait for help,&quot; Harari<br/>said later from a hospital bed.</p><p>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the<br/>attack. It came several days after Israeli forces<br/>killed Marwan Zalloum, the Hebron leader of the Al Aqsa<br/>Martyr&apos;s Brigades, a militia linked to Yasser Arafat&apos;s<br/>Fatah movement.</p><p>Israel said it held Arafat&apos;s Palestinian Authority<br/>responsible, as it does for nearly all Palestinian<br/>attacks against Israel or its settlements.</p><p>Israeli Cabinet Minister Tzachi Hanegbi, on hearing<br/>about the settlement attack, said, &quot;The war against<br/>terror is not over.&quot; Just before Israel launched its<br/>West Bank offensive, a Palestinian attacker killed four<br/>Israelis in a West Bank settlement. In December, gunman<br/>attacked a bus near a settlement in the northern West<br/>Bank, killing 10 people.</p><p>In their West Bank offensive, Israeli forces entered<br/>villages in the Hebron area, but there were not the<br/>large-scale occupations seen elsewhere. Israel scaled<br/>back its operation last week, withdrawing from the city<br/>centers of several main towns.</p><p>Israel and the Palestinians, meanwhile, tried to find<br/>ways to resolve standoffs in Ramallah and Bethlehem,<br/>where Israel has said it won&apos;t completely withdraw its<br/>forces until wanted Palestinians in both surrender.</p><p>A Palestinian negotiator, Salah Taameri, consulted with<br/>Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at his besieged<br/>headquarters about Israeli proposals to end the 25-day<br/>standoff at Bethlehem&apos;s Church of the Nativity, where<br/>some 200 people, including 30 militiamen, were under<br/>siege. After a nearly three-hour meeting at the<br/>Ramallah compound, Taameri returned to Bethlehem.</p><p>The focus of negotiations to resolve the standoff<br/>centered on the fate of six wanted men holed up inside<br/>Â‹ whether they will be escorted to the Gaza Strip (news<br/>- web sites), as the Palestinians propose, or be sent<br/>into exile, as Israel demands.</p><p>Palestinians inside the church said by telephone that<br/>Israeli snipers shot one man walking in the church<br/>courtyard Saturday, wounding him in the abdomen. The<br/>Palestinians were trying to arrange his safe evacuation<br/>through the international Red Cross.</p><p>A U.N. fact-finding mission, which had been due to<br/>arrive Saturday to start an investigation into a battle<br/>in Jenin refugee camp, was delayed a day because of the<br/>Sabbath. Palestinian say Israeli forces<br/>indiscriminately killed civilians in the northern West<br/>Bank camp. Israel denies the accusation, saying<br/>casualties were mainly Palestinian militants killed in<br/>fierce gunbattles.</p><p>In the second standoff, at Arafat&apos;s Ramallah compound,<br/>Israel demands the Palestinians hand over six wanted<br/>men inside. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told<br/>Secretary of State Colin Powell by telephone Friday<br/>that he was willing to release Arafat from confinement<br/>if he agreed to leave for Gaza or anywhere in the West<br/>Bank without the wanted men, an Israeli official said<br/>on condition of anonymity.</p><p>It appeared unlikely Arafat would agree since he has<br/>said he would not hand over the men Â‹ five of whom<br/>allegedly were involved in the assassination of an<br/>Israeli Cabinet minister and the sixth in arms<br/>smuggling.</p><p>President Bush repeatedly has demanded Israel leave the<br/>Palestinian towns. He said Friday he&apos;d had enough of<br/>the Israeli incursions. &quot;It&apos;s now time to quit it<br/>altogether,&quot; Bush said.</p><p>Israeli forces pulled out of Qalqiliya in the northern<br/>West Bank late Friday night.</p><p>The army said it had &quot;neutralized&quot; three<br/>explosives-making laboratories in Qalqiliya and<br/>arrested 20 Palestinians, including 11 who remained in<br/>custody after troops left the town.</p><p>Raed Nazal, the local leader of a radical PLO faction,<br/>the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, was<br/>killed in a firefight.</p></div>
