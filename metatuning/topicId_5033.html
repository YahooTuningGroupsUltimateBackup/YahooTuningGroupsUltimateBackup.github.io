Boron Interviews Noam Chomsky</p><p>14/6/03 (APR)</p><p>Atilio A. Boron: Looking at the recent US policies in Iraq,<br/>What do you think was the real goal behind this war?</p><p>Noam Chomsky: Well, we can be quite confident on one thing. Reasons<br/>we are given can&apos;t possibly be the reasons. And we know that, because<br/>they are internally contradictory. So one day, Bush and Powell would<br/>claim that &quot;the single question,&quot; as they put it, is whether Iraq would<br/>disarm and the next day they would say it doesn&apos;t matter whether Iraq<br/>disarms because they will go on and invade anyway. And the next day<br/>would be that if Saddam and his group get out then the problem will be<br/>solved; and then, the next day for example, at the Azores, at the summit</p><p>when they made an ultimatum to the United Nations, they said that even<br/>if Saddam and his group get out they would go on and invade anyway.<br/>And they went on like that. When people give you contradictory reasons<br/>every time they speak, all they are saying is: &quot;don&apos;t believe a word I<br/>say.&quot;<br/>So we can dismiss the official reasons.</p><p>And the actual reasons I think are not very obscure. First of all,<br/>there&apos;s a long standing interest. That does not account for the timing<br/>but it does account for the interest. And that is that Iraq has the<br/>second large oil reserves in the World and controlling Iraqi oil and<br/>even ending up probably with military bases in Iraq will place the<br/>United States in an extremely strong position to dominate the global<br/>energy system even more than it does today. That&apos;s a very powerful<br/>lever of world control, quite apart from the profits that comes from it.</p><p>And the US probably doesn&apos;t intend to access the oil of Iraq; it intends</p><p>to use primarily safer Atlantic basin resources for itself (Western<br/>Hemisphere, West Africa). But to control the oil has been a leading<br/>principle of US foreign policies since the Second World War, and Iraq<br/>is particularly significant in this respect. So that&apos;s a long standing<br/>interest. On the other hand it doesn&apos;t explain the timing.</p><p>If you want to look at the timing, I think that it became quite clear<br/>that the massive propaganda for the war began in September of last year,</p><p>September 2002. Before that there was a condemnation of Iraq but no<br/>effort to whip people into war fever. So we asked what else happened<br/>then September 2002. Well, two important things happened. One was the<br/>opening of the mid term congressional campaign, and the Bush&apos;s campaign<br/>manager, Karl Rove, was very clearly explaining what should be obvious<br/>to anybody anyway: that they could not possible enter the campaign with<br/>a focus on social and economic issues. The reason is that they are<br/>carrying out policies which are quite harmful to the general population<br/>and favourable to an extremely narrow sector of corporate power and the<br/>corrupt sectors as well, and they can&apos;t face the electorate on that. As<br/>he pointed out, if we can make the primary issue national security then<br/>we will be able win because people will flock to power if they feel<br/>frightened. And that is second nature to these people; that&apos;s the way<br/>they have ran the country - right through the 1980 s - with very<br/>unpopular domestic programs but accustomed to press into the panic<br/>button - Nicaragua, Grenada, crime, one thing after another. And Rove<br/>also pointed out that something similar would be needed for the<br/>presidential election.</p><p>And that&apos;s true and what they want do is not just to stay in office but<br/>they would like to institutionalise the very regressive program put<br/>forward domestically, a program which will basically unravel whatever is</p><p>left of New Deal social democratic systems and turn the country almost<br/>completely into a passive undemocratic society, controlled totally by<br/>high concentration of capitals. This means slashing public medical<br/>assistance, social security; probably schools; and increasing state<br/>power. These people are not conservatives, they brought the country<br/>into a federal deficit with the largest increase in federal spending in<br/>20<br/>years, that is since their last term in office and huge tax cuts for the</p><p>rich, and they want to institutionalise these programs. They are seeking</p><p>a &quot;fiscal train wreck&quot; that will make it impossible to fund the<br/>programs. They know they cannot face an election declaring that they<br/>want to destroy very popular programs, but they can throw up their hands</p><p>in despair and say, &quot;What can we do, there&apos;s no money,&quot; after they have<br/>made sure there would be no money by huge tax cuts for the rich and<br/>sharp increase in spending for military (including high tech industry)<br/>and other programs beneficial to corporate power and the wealthy. So<br/>that&apos;s the second, that&apos;s the domestic factor and in fact, there was a<br/>spectacular propaganda achievement on that. After the government-media<br/>propaganda campaign began in September they succeeded in convincing a<br/>majority of the population very quickly that Iraq was an imminent threat</p><p>to the security of the United States, and even that Iraq was responsible</p><p>for September 11th. I mean, there is not a grain of truth in all that,<br/>but by now majority of the population believes those things and those<br/>attitudes are correlated strongly with the commitment to war, which is<br/>understandable. If people think they are threatened with destruction by<br/>an enemy who&apos;s already attacked them it is likely that they&apos;ll go to<br/>war. In effect, if you look at the press today they describe soldiers as</p><p>saying: &quot;we are here for revenge - you know - because they blew up the<br/>World Trade Centre, they will attack us,&quot; or something. Well, these<br/>beliefs are completely unique to the United States.</p><p>No one in the World believes anything like this. In Kuwait and Iran<br/>people hate Saddam Hussein, but they are not afraid of him, they know<br/>they&apos;re the weakest country in the region. In any event the<br/>government-media propaganda campaign worked brilliantly as the<br/>population was frightened and to a large extent it was willing to<br/>support the war despite the fact that there was a lot of opposition. And</p><p>that&apos;s the second factor.</p><p>And there was a third factor which was even more important. In<br/>September the government announced the national security strategy.<br/>That is not completely without precedent, but it is quite new as a<br/>formulation of state policy. What is stated is that we are tearing the<br/>entire system of the international law to shreds, the end of UN charter,</p><p>and that we are going to carry out an aggressive war - which we will<br/>call &quot;preventive&quot; - and at any time we choose and that we will rule the<br/>world by force. In addition, we will assure that there is never any<br/>challenge to our domination because we are so overwhelmingly powerful<br/>in military force that we will simply crush any potential challenge.</p><p>Well, you know, that caused shudders around the world, including the<br/>foreign policy elite at home which was appalled by this. I mean it is<br/>not that things like that haven&apos;t been heard in the past. Of course they</p><p>had, but it had never been formulated as an official national policy. I<br/>suspect you will have to go back to Hitler to find an analogy to that.<br/>Now, when you propose new norms in the international behaviour and<br/>new policies you have to illustrate it, you have to get people to<br/>understand<br/>that you mean it. Also you have to have what a Harvard historian called<br/>an &quot;exemplary war&quot;, a war of example, which shows that we really mean<br/>what we say.</p><p>And we have to choose the right target. The target has to have several<br/>properties. First it has to be completely defenceless. No one would<br/>attack anybody who might be able to defend themselves. That would be<br/>not prudent. Iraq meets that perfectly: it is the weakest country in the</p><p>region, it&apos;s been devastated by sanctions and almost completely disarmed</p><p>and the US knows every inch of the Iraq territory by satellite<br/>surveillance and overflights, and more recently U-2 flights. So, yes,<br/>Iraq it is extremely weak and satisfied the first condition.</p><p>And secondly, it has to be important. So there will be no point<br/>invading Burundi, you know, for example, it has to be a country<br/>worthwhile controlling, owning, and Iraq has that property too. It&apos;s, as</p><p>mentioned, the second largest oil producer in the world. So it&apos;s perfect</p><p>example and a perfect case for this exemplary war, intending to put the<br/>world on notice saying that this is what we&apos;re going do, any time we<br/>choose. We have the power. We have declared that our goal is domination<br/>by force and that no challenge will be accepted. We&apos;ve showed you what<br/>we are intending to do and be ready for the next. We will proceed on to<br/>the next operation. Those various conditions fold together and they make</p><p>a war a very reasonable choice in taking to a test some principles.</p><p>Atilio A. Boron: According to your analysis then the question is: who<br/>is next? Because you don&apos;t believe that they are going to stop in Iraq,<br/>wouldn&apos;t you?</p><p>Noam Chomsky: No, they already made this clear. For one thing they<br/>need something for the next presidential election. And that will<br/>continue.<br/>Through their first twelve years office this continued year after year;<br/>and it will continue until they manage to institutionalise the domestic<br/>policies to which they are committed and to ensure the global system<br/>they want. So what&apos;s the next choice? Well the next choice has to meet<br/>similar conditions. It has to be valuable enough to attack, and it has<br/>to be weak enough to be defenceless. And there are choices, Syria is a<br/>possible choice. There Israel will be delighted to participate. Israel<br/>alone is a small country, but it&apos;s an offshore US military base, so it<br/>has an enormous military force, apart from having hundreds of nuclear<br/>weapons (and probably a kind of chemical and biological weapons), its<br/>air and armed forces are larger and more advanced that those in any Nato</p><p>power, and the US is behind it overwhelmingly.</p><p>So Syria is a possibility. Iran is a more difficult possibility because<br/>it&apos;s a harder country to dominate and control. Yet there is a reason to<br/>believe that for a year or two now, efforts have been under way to try<br/>dismantle Iran, to break it into internally warring groups. These US<br/>dismantling efforts have been based partly in Eastern Turkey, the US<br/>bases in Eastern Turkey apparently flying surveillance over Iranian<br/>borders. That&apos;s another possibility. There is a third possibility that<br/>can not be considered lightly, and is the Andean region. The Andean<br/>region has a lot of resources and it&apos;s out of control. There are US<br/>military bases surrounding the region, and US forces are there already.<br/>And the control of Latin-America is of course extremely important. With<br/>the developments in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, Bolivia it&apos;s<br/>clear that US domination is challenged and that can&apos;t be accepted, in<br/>particular in a region so close and so crucial because of its resource<br/>base. So that is another possibility.</p><p>Atilio A. Boron: This is really frightening. Now the question is, do<br/>you think that this situation in Iraq, the invasion and the aftermath<br/>would affect in a non-reparable manner the political stability of the<br/>region? What are likely to be the side effects of this invasion in<br/>countries with a very fragile political constitution like the South<br/>Arabia or even Syria, Iran or even the Kurds? What may be the<br/>future of the Palestine question, which still is of paramount importance</p><p>in the area?</p><p>Noam Chomsky: Well, what&apos;s going to happen in the Arab world is<br/>extremely hard to predict. It&apos;s a disorganised and chaotic world<br/>dominated by highly authoritarian and brutal regimes. We know what the<br/>attitudes are. The US is very concerned with attitudes in the region so<br/>they have pretty good studies made by US Middle East scholars on the<br/>attitudes in the region, and the results are pretty dramatic. One of the</p><p>more recent ones, a University of Maryland study covering from Morocco<br/>to the Gulf to Lebanon, the entire area, shows that a very large<br/>majority of the population wants religious leaders to have a greater<br/>role in government. It also shows that approximately another 95% believe</p><p>that the sole US interest in the region is taking its oil, strengthening</p><p>Israel and humiliating the Arabs. That means near unanimity. If there is</p><p>any popular voice allowed in the region, any moves toward democracy, it<br/>could become sort of like Algeria ten years ago, not necessarily radical</p><p>Islamists but a government with some stronger Islamist currents. This is</p><p>the last thing the US wants, so chances of any kind of democratic<br/>opening very likely will be immediately opposed.</p><p>The voices of secular democracy will also be opposed. If they speak up<br/>freely, about violation of UN resolutions for example, they will bring<br/>up the case of Israel, which has a much worse record than Iraq in this<br/>respect but is protected by the United States. And they will have<br/>concerns for independence that the US will not favour, so it will<br/>continue to support oppressive and undemocratic regimes, as in the past,</p><p>and as in Latin America for many years, unless it can be assured that<br/>they will keep closely to Washington&apos;s priorities.</p><p>On the other hand these chaotic popular movements are so difficult to<br/>predict. I mean, even the participants can&apos;t or don&apos;t know what they<br/>want. What we know is this tremendous hatred, antagonisms and fear -<br/>probably more than ever before - on the Israel-Palestine issue that is,<br/>of course, the core issue in the Arab world. The Bush administration has</p><p>been very careful not to take any position, though there are actions,<br/>which undermine the prospects for peaceful resolution: funding more<br/>Israeli settlement programs, for example.</p><p>They don&apos;t say anything significant. The most they say is that we have<br/>a &quot;vision,&quot; or something equally meaningless. Meanwhile the actions have</p><p>been taken, and the US had continued to support the more extremist<br/>positions within Israel. So what the press describes as George Bush&apos;s<br/>most significant recent statements, then later reiterated by Colin<br/>Powell, was the statement that said that settlement in the occupied<br/>territories can continue until the United State determines that the<br/>conditions for peace have been established, and you can move forward<br/>on this mythical &quot;Road Map.&quot;</p><p>The statement that was hailed as &quot;significant&quot; in fact amounts to a<br/>shift in policy, to a more extremist form. Up until now the official<br/>position has been that there should be no more settlements. Of course,<br/>that&apos;s hypocritical of the United States because meanwhile it continues<br/>to provide the military, and economic, and diplomatic support for more<br/>settlements, but the official position has been opposed to it. Now the<br/>official position is in favour of it, until such time as the US<br/>determines unilaterally that the &quot;peace process&quot; has made enough<br/>progress, which means, basically indefinitely. Also it wasn&apos;t very well<br/>noticed that last December, at the UN General Assembly, the Bush<br/>administration shifted the US policy crucially on an important issue. Up</p><p>until that time, until last December, the US has always officially<br/>endorsed the Security Council resolutions of 1968 opposing Israel&apos;s<br/>annexation of  Jerusalem, and ordering Israel to withdraw the moves to<br/>take over East Jerusalem and to expand Jerusalem, which is now a huge<br/>area.</p><p>The US had always officially opposed that, although, again<br/>hypocritically. As of last December the Bush administration came out in<br/>support of it. This was a pretty sharp change in policy, and it is also<br/>significant that it was not reported in the United States. But it took<br/>place. So this is the only concrete act, and continues like that. The US</p><p>has in the past vetoed the European efforts to place international<br/>monitors in the territories, which would be a way of reducing political,</p><p>violent confrontations. The US undermined the December 2001 meetings in<br/>Geneva to implement the Geneva conventions and as almost all the other<br/>contracting parties appeared the US refused and that, essentially,<br/>blocked it. Bush then declared Sharon to be &quot;a man of peace&quot; and<br/>supported his repressive activities, as was pretty obvious. So the<br/>indications are that the US will move towards a very harsh policy in the</p><p>territories, granting the Palestinians at most some kind of meaningless<br/>formal status as a &quot;state&quot;. Of course, this would dress up as democracy,</p><p>and peace, and freedom, and so on. They have a huge public relations<br/>operation and it would be presented in that way, but I don&apos;t think the<br/>reality looks very promising.</p><p>Atilio A. Boron: I have two more questions to go. One is about the<br/>future of the United Nations system. An article by Henry Kissinger<br/>recently reproduced in Argentina argued that multilateralism is over and</p><p>that the world has to come to terms with the absolute superiority of the</p><p>American armed forces and that we&apos;ve better go alone with that because<br/>the old system is dead. What is your reflection on the international<br/>arena?</p><p>Noam Chomsky: Well you know, it&apos;s a little bit like financial and<br/>industrial strategy. It is a more brazen formulation of policies which<br/>have always been carried out. The unilateralism with regard to the<br/>United Nations, as Henry Kissinger knows perfectly well, goes far back.<br/>Was there any UN authorisation for the US invasion of South Vietnam<br/>40 years ago? In fact, the issue could not even come up at the United<br/>Nations. The UN and all the countries were in overwhelming opposition<br/>to the US operations in Vietnam, but the issue could literally never<br/>arise<br/>and it was never discussed because everyone understood that if the<br/>issues were discussed the UN would simply be dismantled.</p><p>When the World Court condemned the United States for its attack on<br/>Nicaragua, the official response of the Reagan administration, which is<br/>the same people now in office, the official response when they rejected<br/>World Court jurisdiction was that other nations do not agree with us and</p><p>therefore we will reserve to ourselves the right to determine what falls</p><p>within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States. I am quoting it.<br/>In this case, that was an attack on Nicaragua. You can hardly have a<br/>more extreme unilateralism than that. And American elites accepted that,</p><p>and so it was applauded and, in fact, quickly forgotten. In your next<br/>trip to the US take a poll in the Political Science Department where you</p><p>are visiting and you will find people who never heard of it. It&apos;s as<br/>wiped out as this. As is the fact that the US had to veto the Security<br/>Council&apos;s resolutions supporting the Court&apos;s decision and calling on all</p><p>states to observe international law. Well, you know that is<br/>unilateralism in its extreme, and it goes back before that.</p><p>Right after the missile crisis, which practically brought the world to<br/>a terminal nuclear war, a major crisis, the Kennedy administration<br/>resumed its terrorist activities against Cuba and its economic warfare<br/>which was the background for the crisis and Dean Acheson, a respected<br/>statesman and Kennedy advisor at the liberal end of the spectrum, gave<br/>an important address to the American Society of International Law in<br/>which he essentially stated the Bush Doctrine of September 2002. What<br/>he said is that no &quot;legal issue&quot; arises in the case of a US response to<br/>a<br/>challenge to its &quot;power, position, and prestige.&quot; Can&apos;t be more extreme<br/>than that. The differences with September 2002 is that instead of being<br/>operative policy now it became official policy. That is the difference.<br/>The UN has been irrelevant to the extent that the US refused to allow it</p><p>to function. So, since the mid 1960&apos;s when the UN had become somewhat<br/>more independent, because of decolonisation and the recovery of other<br/>countries of the world from the ravages of the war, since 1965 the US is</p><p>far in the lead in vetoing Security Council resolutions on a wide range<br/>of issues - Britain is second - and no one else is even close. All that<br/>renders the UN ineffective. It means, you do as we say or else we will<br/>kick you in the pants. Now it is more brazen.</p><p>The only correct statement that Kissinger is making is that now we will<br/>not conceal the policies that we are carrying out.</p><p>Atilio A. Boron: OK. Here is my last question: What has been the impact<br/>of the Iraqi War on the freedoms and public liberties of the American<br/>public? We have heard horrific stories about librarians being forced to<br/>indicate the names of people checking out books regarded as suspicious<br/>or subversives. What has been the real impact of the war in the domestic</p><p>politics of the US?</p><p>Noam Chomsky: Well, those things are taking place but I don&apos;t think<br/>they are specifically connected with the Iraq War. The Bush<br/>administration, let me repeat it again, they are not conservatives; they</p><p>are statist reactionaries. They want a very powerful state, a huge state</p><p>in fact, a violent state and one that enforces obedience on the<br/>population. There is a kind of quasi-fascist spirit there, in the<br/>background, and they have been attempting to undermine civil rights<br/>in many ways. That&apos;s one of their long term objectives, and they have to</p><p>do it quickly because in the US there is a strong tradition of<br/>protection<br/>of civil rights. But the kind of surveillance you are talking about of<br/>libraries and so on is a step towards it. They have also claimed the<br/>right to place a person - even an American citizen - in detention<br/>without charge, without access to lawyers and family, and to hold them<br/>there indefinitely, and that in fact has been upheld by the Courts,<br/>which is pretty shocking. But they have a new proposal, sometimes called</p><p>Patriot II, a 80-page document inside the Justice department. Someone<br/>leaked it and it reached the press. There have been some outraged<br/>articles by law professors about it. This is only planned so far, but<br/>they would like to implement as secretly as they can. These plans would<br/>permit the Attorney General to remove citizenship from any individual<br/>whom the attorney general believes is acting in a way harmful to the US<br/>interests. I mean, this is going beyond anything contemplated in any<br/>democratic society. One law professor at New York University has written</p><p>that this administration evidently will attempt to take away any civil<br/>rights that it can from citizens and I think it s basically correct.<br/>That fits in with their reactionary statist policies which have a<br/>domestic aspect in the economy and social life but also in political<br/>life.</p><p>Atilio A. Boron: Professor Chomsky, it was a great pleasure to have you<br/>expressing your words for the Argentine audience. I want to thank you<br/>very much for this interview and I hope that we can be in touch again in</p><p>the future.
