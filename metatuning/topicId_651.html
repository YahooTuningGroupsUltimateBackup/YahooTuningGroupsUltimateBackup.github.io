They<br/>describe us in very similar terms. I find this troubling.</p><p>Now I must ask, was it an accident that you &apos;penned&apos; your next note<br/>to not only include obscenities but done in all caps, so as to let us<br/>know you were shouting at us, hoping that &apos;raising your voice&apos; would<br/>get your point across more forcefully?</p><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.

If someone is pointing<br/>&gt; a loaded gun at me, I may choose to defend myself. If<br/>&gt; someone is threatening my family, I will defend them<br/>&gt; using whatever force is necessary to remove the threat.</p><p>A man after my own heart. In Colorado, we have a law known<br/>colloquially as the &quot;make my day&quot; law. If someone forcefully enters<br/>your home you have the right to kill him inside your home. It was<br/>passed with much opposition, but studies showed, at least in Colorado,<br/>a confronted intruder would harm the occupant rather than retreat. I<br/>find it comforting that I will not be prosecuted for defending my<br/>family or myself in my own home.</p><p>&gt; Fortunately these situations are very rare. But you can<br/>&gt; be assured that if someone were to rape any of my<br/>&gt; children or my wife or my sister, that that person<br/>&gt; would beg to be killed when I am through with him.</p><p>I suspect I would just kill the man...</p><p>&gt; This is a normal, rational, human response to evil John.</p><p>I disagree that torture is rational, and that is what you are talking<br/>about in the previous passage. Isn&apos;t it more rational to just remove<br/>the threat as quickly and surely as possible?</p><p>&gt; This is what any real man would do for his family.</p><p>There is a lot of variability in &quot;real men&quot;. You and I would kill<br/>those who violently attacked our families. Others here would disable<br/>them and turn them over to the police, I suspect. Depending on your<br/>religious and moral views, either might be deemed &quot;reasonable&quot; and<br/>&quot;manly&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think you should see a doctor and see if there is a<br/>&gt; &gt; chemical imbalance in your system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In order to get a visa to teach overseas a couple years<br/>&gt; back, I went through a complete battery of psych tests<br/>&gt; and am perfectly sane. No imbalances, John.</p><p>Good. Just a suggestion I thought was appropriate for what I saw as a<br/>tendency to demonize those with whom you disagreed. Glad to hear<br/>you&apos;re OK.</p><p>&gt; Anyone else want to share their test results?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Jeff</p><p>Sorry, nothing to share.
