Heaping billions on the<br/>rich while ensuring that one out of six American kids doesn&apos;t get a<br/>penny is dead wrong.</p><p>But that&apos;s exactly what Congressional Republicans did -- and what<br/>President Bush signed off on.</p><p>This is not a right/left issue. It&apos;s a right/wrong issue. But the GOP&apos;s<br/>self-appointed morality czars have been deafeningly silent on this bit<br/>of<br/>economic indecency. I guess Bill Bennett was too busy shaking the hands<br/>of<br/>every one-armed bandit in Vegas to notice.</p><p>Adding to the obscenity is the fact that while the Congressional hatchet</p><p>men were hacking up the $3.5 billion child tax credit in the name of<br/>keeping the total tax cut under $350 billion, they let stand billions in</p><p>corporate tax dodges and accounting cons, including the use of offshore<br/>tax havens.</p><p>The White House labeled this particular piece of supply-side porn the<br/>Jobs<br/>and Growth Act. I guess the Leave No Corporate Loophole Behind Act<br/>didn&apos;t<br/>focus group as well.</p><p>The last few years have shown us what happens when an entire subculture<br/>loses its moral compass: Enron, Tyco, Adelphia, WorldCom, et al. And<br/>it&apos;s<br/>becoming increasingly clear that the current administration has embraced</p><p>the unethical ethos of the corporate oligarchy from which so many of its</p><p>members came -- and which all of them continue to serve. The same<br/>inability to distinguish right from wrong that characterized the<br/>corporate<br/>scandals is now dominating public policy.</p><p>It&apos;s the Enronization of Washington.</p><p>Want more proof? How about the unprecedented aircraft-leasing deal<br/>currently being put together by the Pentagon and Boeing -- a plan that<br/>uses the same kind of accounting sleight-of-hand popularized by the gang</p><p>at Enron. Here&apos;s how it works: instead of the Pentagon buying the 100<br/>new<br/>jets it wants to use as aerial refueling tankers directly from Boeing,<br/>at<br/>an upfront cost of $138 million per plane, a special-purpose entity<br/>created on Wall Street will purchase the planes and lease them to the<br/>Air<br/>Force.</p><p>That way the Pentagon gets to acquire the planes without having to dip<br/>into the Air Force&apos;s limited procurement budget, and Boeing gets to reap</p><p>billions in new military contracts without having to show the debt<br/>associated with the shady deal on its balance sheet. It&apos;s an<br/>off-the-books<br/>win-win deal for them both -- but a losing proposition for taxpayers,<br/>who&apos;ll end up forking over an additional $8 billion to cover the<br/>interest<br/>payments on the leases.</p><p>The sleazy new deal is being put together by the good bankers at<br/>Citigroup<br/>-- the same outfit that helped Enron defraud shareholders out of, what<br/>do<br/>you know, also $8 billion. Who says irony is dead?</p><p>Then there is the news that, in an effort to ensure the passage of its<br/>cherished tax-cut plan, the Bush administration buried a highly damaging</p><p>study -- commissioned by its own Treasury department -- that found that<br/>it<br/>would take either the permanent elimination of all future federal<br/>discretionary spending or an immediate and permanent tax hike of 66<br/>percent to cover the upcoming retirement and healthcare needs of aging<br/>baby boomers. You think that bombshell might have put a little damper on</p><p>Bush&apos;s tax cut orgy?</p><p>This is exactly the kind of skullduggery corrupt corporations used to<br/>conceal potentially disastrous news from investors -- like Adelphia<br/>hiding<br/>its $3.1 billion loans to the Rigas family in tiny footnotes in an<br/>earnings filing.</p><p>Like many disgraced companies, the White House has proven adept at<br/>playing<br/>fast and loose with the numbers in order to mislead its &quot;shareholders&quot;<br/>--<br/>the American people. Take the administration&apos;s shifty use of &quot;averages&quot;<br/>to<br/>make it seem like the new tax cut benefits everyone -- claiming that &quot;91</p><p>million taxpayers will receive, on average, a tax cut of $1,226,&quot; when,<br/>in<br/>fact, the majority of households will receive a tax cut of $100 or less.</p><p>Or the way it used sure-to-be-repealed &quot;sunset clauses&quot; to make it seem<br/>as<br/>if the president was reasonably settling for a $350 billion tax cut,<br/>when<br/>the actual price tag on the new bill will be close to $1 trillion.</p><p>It&apos;s the kind of economic book cooking that would do ol&apos; Kenny Boy Lay<br/>proud.</p><p>It&apos;s time to expand the Right&apos;s definition of immorality beyond sex,<br/>drugs, and rock and roll to include lying, cheating, and callous<br/>indifference to those in need.</p><p>CEOs lying to investors to pad their own pockets is bad enough.<br/>Political<br/>leaders lying to the American people to pad the pockets of their big<br/>buck<br/>contributors is immoral -- and intolerable.</p><p>-----</p><p>Arianna Huffington is the author of &quot;Pigs at the Trough: How<br/>Corporate Greed and Political Corruption are Undermining<br/>America.&quot; For information on the book, visit<br/><a href="http://www.PigsAtTheTrough.com">www.PigsAtTheTrough.com</a></p><p>If you have questions or comments, contact Arianna at<br/>arianna@...<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
