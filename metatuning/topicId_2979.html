<a href="/metatuning">back to list</a><h1>speaking of hackers, Monsanto, and biotech . . . .</h1><h3>Christopher Bailey &#x3C;cb202@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/10/2002 2:31:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Corporate<br/>Phantoms</p><p>By George<br/>Monbiot</p><p>Tony Blair&apos;s speech to the Royal<br/>Society last Thursday was a wonderful<br/>jumble of misconceptions and logical<br/>elisions. He managed to confuse<br/>science with its technological<br/>products. GM crops are no more &quot;science&quot;<br/>   than cars, computers or washing<br/>machines, and those opposing them<br/> are no more &quot;anti-science&quot; than people<br/>who don&apos;t like the Millennium<br/> Dome are &quot;anti-architecture&quot;.</p><p>     He suggested that in the poor world<br/>people welcome genetic<br/> engineering. It was unfortunate that<br/>the example he chose was the<br/> biotech industry in Bangalore in<br/>south-west India. Bangalore happens<br/> to be the centre of the world&apos;s most<br/>effective protests against GM crops,<br/>the capital of a state in which<br/>anti-GM campaigners outnumber those in<br/> the UK by 1,000 to one. Like most<br/>biotech enthusiasts, he ignored the<br/> key concern of the activists: the<br/>corporate takeover of the food chain,<br/> and its devastating consequences for<br/>food security.</p><p> But it would be wrong to blame Blair<br/>alone for these misconstructions.<br/> The prime minister was simply<br/>repeating a suite of arguments<br/>     formulated elsewhere. Over the past<br/>month, activists have slowly been<br/> discovering where that &quot;elsewhere&quot; may<br/>be.</p><p> Two weeks ago, this column showed how<br/>the Bivings Group, a PR<br/> company contracted to Monsanto, had<br/>invented fake citizens to post<br/> messages on internet listservers.<br/>These phantoms had launched a<br/> campaign to force Nature magazine to<br/>retract a paper it had published,<br/> alleging that native corn in Mexico<br/>had been contaminated with GM<br/> pollen. But this, it now seems, is<br/>just one of hundreds of critical<br/>interventions with which PR companies<br/>hired by big business have<br/> secretly guided the biotech debate<br/>over the past few years.</p><p> While I was writing the last piece,<br/>Bivings sent me an email fiercely<br/> denying that it had anything to do<br/>with the fake correspondents &quot;Mary<br/> Murphy&quot; and &quot;Andura Smetacek&quot;, who<br/>started the smear campaign</p><p>checked the email&apos;s technical<br/>  properties. They contained the<br/>identity tag &quot;<a href="http://bw6.bivwood.com">bw6.bivwood.com</a>&quot;. The<br/>   message came from the same computer<br/>terminal that &quot;Mary Murphy&quot;<br/>  has used.</p><p>  New research coordinated by the<br/>campaigner Jonathan Matthews<br/>  appears to have unmasked the fake<br/>persuaders: &quot;Mary Murphy&quot; is<br/>        being posted by a Bivings web<br/>designer, writing from both the office<br/>and his home computer in Hyattsville,<br/>Maryland; while &quot;Andura<br/> Smetacek&quot; appears to be the company&apos;s<br/>chief internet marketer.</p><p> Not long ago, the website <a href="http://slashdot.com">slashdot.com</a><br/>organised a competition for<br/>         hackers: if they could successfully<br/>break into a particular server, they<br/> got to keep it. Several experienced<br/>hackers tested their skills. One of<br/> them was one using a computer<br/>identified as <a href="http://bw6.bivwood.com">bw6.bivwood.com</a>.</p><p>     Though someone in the Bivings office<br/>appears to possess hacking<br/>          skills, there is no evidence that<br/>Bivings has ever made use of them.</p><p>  But other biotech lobbyists do appear<br/>to have launched hacker attacks.<br/> Just before the paper in Nature was<br/>publicly challenged, the server<br/> hosting the accounts used by its<br/>authors was disabled by a particularly<br/>  effective attack which crippled their<br/>capacity to fight back. The culprit<br/>  has yet to be identified.</p><p>  Bivings is the secret author of<br/>several of the websites and bogus<br/>  citizens&apos; movements which have been<br/>coordinating campaigns against<br/>  environmentalists. One is a fake<br/>scientific institute called the &quot;Centre<br/>  for Food and Agricultural Research&quot;.</p><p>    Bivings has also set up the &quot;Alliance<br/>for Environmental Technology&quot;, a<br/> chlorine industry lobby group. Most<br/>importantly, Bivings appears to be<br/> connected with AgBioWorld, the genuine<br/>website run by CS Prakash, a<br/> plant geneticist at Tuskegee<br/>University, Alabama.</p><p> AgBioWorld is perhaps the most<br/>influential biotech site on the web.<br/>    Every day it carries new postings<br/>about how GM crops will feed the world,<br/> new denunciations of the science which<br/>casts doubt on them and new<br/> attacks on environmentalists. It was<br/>here that the fake persuaders<br/> invented by Bivings launched their<br/>assault on the Nature paper.</p><p>AgBioWorld then drew up a petition to<br/>have the paper retracted.</p><p> Prakash claims to have no links with<br/>Bivings but, as the previous article<br/>showed, an error message on his site<br/>suggests that it is or was using<br/> the main server of the Bivings Group.<br/>Jonathan Matthews, who found<br/> the message, commissioned a full<br/>technical audit of AgBioWorld. His<br/>  web expert has now found 11<br/>distinctive technical fingerprints shared by<br/>      AgBioWorld and Bivings&apos;s Alliance for<br/>Environmental Technology site.</p><p> The sites appear, he concludes, to<br/>have been created by the same<br/>programmer.</p><p>Though he lives and works in the<br/>United States, CS Prakash claims to<br/>   represent the people of the third<br/>world. But he set up AgBioWorld with<br/>Greg Conko of the Competitive<br/>Enterprise Institute, the far-right<br/>      libertarian lobby group funded by such<br/>companies as Philip Morris,<br/> Pfizer and Dow Chemical.</p><p>  Conko has collaborated with Matthew<br/>Metz, one of the authors of the<br/>     scientific letters to Nature seeking<br/>to demolish the maize paper, to<br/>     produce a highly partisan guide to<br/>biotechnology on the AgBioWorld<br/>site.</p><p>The Competitive Enterprise Institute<br/>boasts that it &quot;played a key role in<br/>the creation&quot; of a petition of<br/>scientists supporting biotech (ostensibly to<br/>     feed the third world) launched by<br/>Prakash. Unaware that it had been<br/> devised by a corporate lobby group,<br/>3,000 scientists, three Nobel<br/> laureates among them, signed up.</p><p>  Bivings is just one of several public<br/>relations agencies secretly building<br/>a parallel world on the web. Another<br/>US company, Berman &amp; Co, runs a<br/>fake public interest site called<br/><a href="http://ActivistCash.com">ActivistCash.com</a>, which seeks to<br/>   persuade the foundations giving money<br/>to campaigners to desist.</p><p>  Berman also runs the &quot;Centre for<br/>Consumer Freedom&quot;, which looks like<br/> a citizens&apos; group but lobbies against<br/>smoking bans, alcohol restrictions<br/> and health warnings on behalf of<br/>tobacco, drinks and fast food<br/> companies. The marketing firm Nichols<br/>Dezenhall set up a site called<br/> StopEcoViolence, another &quot;citizens&apos;<br/>initiative&quot;, demonising activists.</p><p>    In March, Nichols Dezenhall linked up<br/>with Prakash&apos;s collaborator, the<br/>    Competitive Enterprise Institute, to<br/>sponsor a conference for journalists<br/>    and corporate executives on<br/>&quot;eco-extremism&quot;.</p><p>   What is fascinating about these<br/>websites, fake groups and phantom<br/> citizens is that they have either<br/>smelted or honed all the key weapons<br/> currently used by the world&apos;s biotech<br/>enthusiasts: the conflation of<br/> activists with terrorists, the<br/>attempts to undermine hostile research, the<br/> ever more nuanced claims that those<br/>who resist GM crops are<br/> anti-science and opposed to the<br/>interests of the poor.</p><p>     The hatred directed at activists over<br/>the past few years is, in other<br/>     words, nothing of the kind. We have<br/>been confronted, in truth, by the<br/>     crafted response of an industry<br/>without emotional attachment.</p><p>     Tony Blair was correct when he<br/>observed on Thursday that &quot;there is only<br/>     a small band of people... who<br/>genuinely want to stifle informed<br/>     debate&quot;. But he was wrong to identify<br/>this small group as those<br/>     opposed to GM crops. Though he didn&apos;t<br/>know it, the people seeking to<br/>     stifle the debate are the ones who<br/>wrote his speech; not in the days<br/>     before he delivered it, but in the<br/>years in which the arguments he used<br/>     were incubated.</p></div>
