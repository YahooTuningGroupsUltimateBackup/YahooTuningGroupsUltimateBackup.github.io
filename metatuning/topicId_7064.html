He accomplished essentially nothing<br/>in his first 3 years in the U.S. senate.</p><p>    In a desperate bid to find a way  to cover up his lack of<br/>accomplishments, McCarthy hit on the anti-communist witch<br/>hunt.</p><p>    Senator McCarthy&apos;s specialty was the sweeping innuendo.<br/>Make a big insinuation with vast implications, provide no proof,<br/>move on to another broad innuendo before the victim could recover.<br/>Put words in the victim&apos;s mouth. Use guilt by assocation. The<br/>apparent hope was that the victims would get so tangled up<br/>in all the sweeping misrepresentations that they&apos;d drown<br/>and be unable to answer (in large part because Senator McCarthy<br/>tried to make sure there weren&apos;t any actual testable facts in his<br/>insinuations that anyone could rebut).</p><p>   Like Senator Joseph McCarthy, Carl Lumma has accomplished<br/>nothing of note in the field of microtonality.  He has produced no<br/>microtonal CDs worth mentioning, no scholarship of any note,<br/>nothing anyone can point to as a serious accomplishment.</p><p>    In a desperate bid to cover up his own lack of accomplishment,<br/>Carl Lumma has now hit on something -- smear tactics. Like<br/>Senator Joseph McCarthy, Carl Lumma has abandoned testable<br/>facts and he has lowered himself to mere innuendo and insinuation:</p><p>Message 7058 of 7060  |   Previous |  Next  [ Up Thread ] &#x9;Message Index &#x9;<br/>  Msg #<br/>From:  &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt;<br/>Date:  Sat April 10, 2004  2:31 am<br/>Subject:  Carl Lumma spouts more lies</p><p>&gt;Not content to merely lie about the harmonic series and<br/>&gt;similar paranoid obfuscatia, Carl &quot;Shameful Liar&quot; Lumma<br/>&gt;has disgraced himself yet again by telling yet another<br/>&gt;lie. Let&apos;s have a look...</p><p>  When did I ever publicly identify Carl Lumma as someone<br/>who has &quot;lie[d] about the harmonic seres&quot;?</p><p>  Show me my words, Carl  -- let us all see where I E*V*E*R<br/>claimed Carl Lumma &quot;lie[s] about the harmonic series.&quot;</p><p>    Carl Lumma continues with his Senator-Joseph-McCarthy-<br/>style  innuendos and distortions by trying to ridicule my use of<br/>facts and logic:</p><p>&gt;As always, let&apos;s evaluate this with logic and documented<br/>&gt;facts.</p><p>  Let&apos;s do that, Carl.</p><p>  Let&apos;s evaluate your innuendos using logic and documented<br/>facts. If your innuendos are anything but  Joseph-McCarthy-<br/>style smear tactics, then you should have some hard facts to<br/>back up your insinuations.</p><p>   Show &apos;em to us.  Show me in my own words where I have<br/>claimed that you  &quot;lied about the harmonic series.&quot;</p><p>   You can&apos;t show me any place I said that because I never<br/>have -- your entire post is a distortion filled with misleading<br/>innuendo, and you know it.</p><p>   Show me in my own words where I have made any post<br/>publicly describing you as &quot;Carl &grave;Shameful Liar&apos; Lumma.&quot;</p><p>    You can&apos;t show me any post where I called you &quot;Carl<br/>&grave;Shameful Liar&apos; Lumma&quot; because you&apos;re just making<br/>insinuations, using ridicule .</p><p>    In the tradition of Senator Joseph McCarthy,  once<br/>again Carl Lumma continues putting words in my mouth that<br/>I never said:</p><p> &gt;Documented Fact #2: Carl &quot;Can&apos;t take what he dishes out&quot;<br/>&gt;Lumma is a known character assasin.</p><p>     If you continue with distortions and innuendos like<br/>this post, you _will_ get a reputation for character assassination.<br/>Oddly enough, if you persist with these kinds of smear<br/>tactics against me, you will actually become most of things<br/>I never made a post saying you are. If you continue to put<br/>words in my words I never posted, you _will_ make a liar and a<br/>character assassin of yourself. That&apos;s oddly ironic, Carl.<br/>By trying to avoid a situation, you are actually creating the<br/>conditions for it. Shades of &quot;Appointment In Samara,&quot; eh?</p><p> &gt;Documented Fact #3: Carl &quot;All Talk, No Music&quot; Lumma hasn&apos;t<br/>&gt;made a single microtonal CD. And that CD was a genuine<br/>&gt;failure.</p><p>  I am guessing that this particular innuendo is a feeble<br/>attempt to capitalize on my trivial  flub about Dante<br/>Rosati&apos;s alleged CD. Here&apos;s the backstory -- at the December<br/>2001 MicroFest in El Paso, someone had a microtonal CD<br/>by somebody called &quot;Sri Swifty.&quot;  I gave it a listen. Didn&apos;t<br/>impress me.</p><p>   Since I have no idea who the hell &quot;Sri Swifty&quot; is, I asked<br/>someone -- they told me it was Dante Rosati.  Well, they<br/>gave me bad info.  Turns out &quot;Sri Swifty&quot; is Patrick Pagano.</p><p>   So that&apos;s the big story. Great, Carl, I&apos;m human and I&apos;m<br/>fallible and I made one tiny mistake -- beliving what someone<br/>else told me at the 2001 MicroFest in El Paso.</p><p>   Note well that this trivial misapprehension on my part does<br/> not change the substantive truth of my assertion that Dante<br/>Rosati has released no microtonal music on CD of any<br/>significnace.</p><p>   I stand corrected -- isntead of producing one crappy-<br/>sounding CD of microtonal music, Dante Rosati produced<br/>NO microtonal CDs at all...by his own admission.</p><p>   So what we have got here is a guy who tries to defend<br/>himself against the charge that he has produced  very<br/>little of musical value by claiming that, no, mclaren is<br/>wrong, he actually produced no music at all.</p><p>   That&apos;s  a peculiar defense, isn&apos;t it?</p><p>   Apparently I&apos;m guilty of giving Dante Rosati *more<br/>credit* than he deserves.  Seems I was * too generous*<br/>in my estimation of Dante Rosati&apos;s so-called contributions<br/>to microtonality.</p><p>   Instead of making only a microscopic musical contribution,<br/> Dante Rosati wants it known that he has made no musical<br/>contribution at all to microtonality on CD.</p><p>   Great, Carl.  THIS is the best you can come up with?</p><p>   I made the mistake of being too generous by half about<br/>Dante Rosati...?</p><p>   Good luck with that criticism of me.  Yeah -- I&apos;m too<br/>generous and too kind-hearted about Dante Rosati,<br/>so I must be ridiculed and smeared in public.</p><p>   Carl Lumma continues putting words in my mouth<br/>in the very best tradition of Senator Joseph McCarthy:</p><p> &gt;With these documented facts in mind, any reasonable<br/>&gt;person would have to ask himself: What shed of evidence is<br/>&gt;there that Carl &quot;Censorship&quot; Lumma hasn&apos;t banned Brian<br/>&gt;McLaren from the Alternate Lying List? C&apos;mon Carl, if what<br/>&gt;you say is true, show us one notarized shred of proof that<br/>&gt;you didn&apos;t disgrace yourself by banning Brian McLaren from<br/>&gt;the Alterate Lying List.</p><p>   In this particular iosinuation, Carl, you seem to imply that<br/>I use the faulty argument of requiring proof that something<br/>hasn&apos;t happened.  Now let&apos;s apply some logic -- it&apos;s usually<br/>impossible to prove that something _didn&apos;t_ happen out in the<br/>great big real wide world.</p><p>  Show me the proof in my own words that I have ever<br/>required someone to prove that some vague nebulous<br/>thing &quot;never happened.&quot;  That&apos;s a basic mistake because<br/>it&apos;s usually logically impossible. (In a lab you can<br/>sometimes prove something probably didn&apos;t happen --<br/>but even then it&apos;s damn hard to actually  *prove* it.)</p><p>   What I have instead demanded is proof that someone<br/>didn&apos;t make some specific post that they damn well did<br/>make.  Here&apos;s the bottom line, kiddies -- on the internet,<br/>YOU OWN YOUR WORDS.</p><p>   If you posted it, you can&apos;t wriggle out of it. If you<br/>made the claim in public, then you have to take the<br/>responsibility for saying those things in public.</p><p>   You can&apos;t wriggle out of it by telling the lie &quot;I never<br/>said that! I never said any such thing!&quot; as Jonathan<br/>Szanto has.  You can&apos;t wriggle out of what you said<br/>in public by trying to use misleading innuendo, as<br/>Carl Lumma is doing right now.</p><p>   YOU OWN YOUR WORDS.</p><p>  People on these public forums think they can tell lies<br/>in public (&quot;[mclaren is] an imbecile&quot;- Gene Ward Smith)<br/>and then move on and nobody will remember or pay<br/>attention or care.</p><p>  People on these public forum think they can indulge<br/>in hysterical name-calling (&apos;you baboon&quot; - Dante<br/>Rosati) and then blithely walk away and never have<br/>to take responsibility for that kind of public name-<br/>calling.</p><p>   Well, here&apos;s a news flash for you, ladies and gents --<br/>YOU OWN YOUR WORDS.  If you tell repeated<br/>lies in public, I will call you on it.</p><p>   And all Carl Lumma&apos;s attempts at ridicule won&apos;t<br/>cover your asses.</p><p>   Here&apos;s something hot off the AP wire -- YOU OWN<br/>YOUR WORDS.  If you indulged in empty name-<br/>calling as a debate tactic on these forums, I will<br/>call you on it.</p><p>   And all Graham Breed&apos;s efforts at ridicule will<br/>save from having to take responsibility for what<br/>you said.</p><p>   Carl Lumma continues his misleading insinuations:</p><p>&gt;But Carl &quot;Censorship&quot; Lumma hasn&apos;t and won&apos;t do that.<br/>&gt;Why? Because there isn&apos;t even a minutia of RFID-tagged<br/>&gt;evidence that he didn&apos;t ban Brian McLaren from the<br/>&gt;Alternate Wanking List, and Carl &quot;Blubbering Sociopath&quot;<br/>&gt;Lumma knows it. And let&apos;s not forget, Carl &quot;All talk no<br/>&gt;action&quot; Lumma hasn&apos;t produced a single microtonal CD.<br/>&gt;Think about that next time you&apos;re brushing your teeth.</p><p>       Show me in my own words where I ever called you<br/>&quot;Carl &grave;Blubbering Sociopath&apos; Lumma.&quot;</p><p>    You keep making these Joseph-McCarthy-style<br/>innuedos, but I don&apos;t see any proof to back &apos;em up.<br/>It&apos;s the old Senator Joseph McCarthy game...make<br/>an insinuation so vague and so damning that the<br/>victim can&apos;t fight back because it&apos;s all just<br/>smoke and mirrors.</p><p>&gt;The Alternate Wanking List is a factory that produces<br/>&gt;lies and pseudoscientific mistruths by the wagonload.<br/>&gt;Nevertheless, it&apos;s a disgusting act of censorship to be<br/>&gt;banned from it, whether you&apos;re actually banned or not.</p><p>    History shows that superstitions can only be sustained<br/>by censorship and lies. In the former Soviet Union,<br/>Lysenkoism was maintained only by censoring scientists<br/>who spoke out against it.  Only Stalinist purges and<br/>official lies succeeded in making Lysenkoism last<br/>for any length of time as a scientific doctrine.</p><p>    We can see what happens to superstitions in an<br/>Jeffersonian democracy  by taking a look at the cold<br/>fusion imbroglio.  That superstition lasted about 3<br/>weeks. Then it sank like a rock.</p><p>   Why?</p><p>   Because open debate rapidly destroys the credibility<br/>of superstitions. Only censorship and a campaign of lies<br/>can keep superstitions in place and make &apos;em seem<br/>credible.</p><p>   The Alternative Wanking list is based on provably<br/>false superstitions about music and acoustics and<br/>psychoacoustics and musical history and ethno-<br/>musicology.</p><p>   People like me, who apply critical thinking and<br/>the test of reality to the claims people make on<br/>these forums,  must be publicly  identified people<br/> to be censored on and  banned. The reason for<br/>publicly indentifying people like me as individuals<br/>who mus tbe censored and banned is simple. It&apos;s<br/>obvious. It&apos;s as plain as day. People like me, who<br/> apply critical thinking, would instigate free and<br/>open debate on the ATL.</p><p>   And guess what?</p><p>   In a free and open debate onthe ATL, pseudoscientific<br/>superstitions like &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; and &quot;TOPS&quot; would<br/>collapse in a New York minute.</p><p>-----------<br/>   Carl Lumma has done a mediocre job of using innuedo<br/>to try to smear me in the very best Paul Erlich/Joseph McCarthy<br/>style.</p><p>   Make sweeping charges...provide no proof.</p><p>   Make vast dark insinuations...then move on before the<br/>victim has a chance to rebut &apos;em.</p><p>   Put words in another person&apos;s mouth...then hit &apos;em with<br/>another straw man argument until they&apos;re punch-drunk.</p><p>   The old whack-a-mole game. Spew so many innuedos<br/>and insinuations the other person keeps trying to play<br/>whack-a-mole and can&apos;t keep up.</p><p>   As everyone can clearly see by now, Carl Lumma&apos;s latest<br/>post is nothing but a giant example of the classic logical<br/>fallacy of the &quot;straw man argument.&quot;  In this discredited<br/>and faulty debate tactic, a person (Carl Lumma) cynically<br/>puts misleading words in his opponent&apos;s mouth and<br/>distorts and caricatures his opponent&apos;s position. Fine<br/>examples of this discredited and logically fallacious<br/>&quot;straw man argument&quot; can be found in the recent<br/>rhetorical calisthenics of the Bush administration --<br/>&quot;Opponents of the Iraq war wanted to keep Saddam&apos;s<br/>torture chambers open for business.&quot;  No they didn&apos;t,<br/>and there&apos;s no evidence that anyone who opposed the<br/>war in Iraq ever approved of Saddam&apos;s torture cahmbers.<br/> But the discredited and logically bankrupt straw man<br/>argument wants you to ignore the facts and instead<br/> concentrate only on the misleading caricature.</p><p>   Likewise, when Carl Lumma indulges in discredited<br/>straw man arguments against me, Carl wants you to<br/>ignore the fact that I never said any of the things Carl<br/>implies I said  -- instead, Carl wants you to concentrate<br/>only on his misleading caricature of me.</p><p>   Well, guess what, kiddies?</p><p>   The Bush administration&apos;s discredited straw man<br/>argument against people who opposed the Iraq war<br/>isn&apos;t working because opponents of the war keep<br/>pointing to all the brave servicemen and women<br/>who keep getting shot and mutilated and blown<br/>apart and burned alive by Iraqi insurgents, and<br/>the hard facts coming out of Riaq every day now<br/>are starting to overwhelm the Bush administration&apos;s<br/>phoney straw man argument. Polls seem to show<br/> public sentiment moving against involvement in<br/>Iraq.</p><p>   In the same way, the facts are beginning to<br/>overwhelm Carl Lumma&apos;s phoney straw man<br/>argument against me.  It is a documented<br/>fact that people have crawled out of the<br/>woodwork to indulged in hysterical name-<br/>calling aimed at me, and these same people<br/>have offered no logical arguments and no<br/>facts to insupport their insupportable<br/>claims about microtonality. Eventually,<br/>the facts add up and everyone realizes<br/>what&apos;s going on...regardless of Carl Lumma&apos;s<br/>innuendos and insinuations about me.</p><p>   But you made one big mistake, Carl.  Among all the<br/>insinuations and all the innuedo you threw at me, you<br/>did make one factual claim that can be tested.</p><p>   You claimed I&apos;m not censored and banned from the<br/>ATL.</p><p>  Let&apos;s take a look at Carl Lumma&apos;s own words and<br/>see about that:</p><p>[From the Alternative Lying List]<br/>Message 51672 of 53097 | Previous | Next [ Up Thread ] Message Index<br/>Msg #</p><p>From: Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l... &lt;<a href="mailto:ekin@l">mailto:ekin@l</a>...&gt;&gt;<br/>Date: Mon Jan 12, 2004 1:35 pm<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: moderator policies</p><p>(..)<br/>Quoted below is the policy that, after much carful [sic] thought, I have<br/>adopted.
