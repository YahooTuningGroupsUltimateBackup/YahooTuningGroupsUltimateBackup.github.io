The next revolution will not involve a<br/>ballot box. The human race just has to wake up, start<br/>being gentle and begin treating each other with grace!  I<br/>don&apos;t think this will happen within the system. Ghandi or<br/>Martin Luther King did way more than any Democrat ever has.&quot;</p><p>The video of disenfranchized voters in Ohio he&apos;s talking<br/>about is found here (I haven&apos;t watched it yet)...</p><p><a href="http://www.metroblogging.com/videothevote/">http://www.metroblogging.com/videothevote/</a></p><p>My friend Adam has two interesting posts...</p><p><a href="http://adam.giant-robot.com/archives/000264.html">http://adam.giant-robot.com/archives/000264.html</a><br/><a href="http://adam.giant-robot.com/archives/000266.html">http://adam.giant-robot.com/archives/000266.html</a></p><p>I recommend The Power of Nightmares (a documentary aired<br/>on BBC2), which compares American neo-conservatives with<br/>radical Islamists.
