I&apos;ve seen him delay decisions, often for a long time,<br/>looking for a lot of input from other people. But he is a composer,<br/>he is breaking new ground (I think?) and the comment was offered as<br/>one of support for individuality, support just for his _efforts_, and<br/>to just bolster him *should* he want to just say &quot;Basta! I&apos;m going<br/>with this one, and others can adjust to me!&quot;</p><p>There was nothing - not one jot, not one iota - condescending about<br/>it. You are in error in my reasoning for even mentioning it, I&apos;m sure<br/>Joseph himself is way more than intelligent enough to weigh the<br/>microscopic impact of a statement from *me* on *Blackjack*, so why<br/>don&apos;t you just leave it right there.</p><p>If this doesn&apos;t seem clear enough, you&apos;ll hear it from me in person...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=1181 href="#1181">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/26/2001 2:07:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You know, I&apos;m still going to call you when you&apos;re home in<br/>&gt; Boston!!! :) But honest to god(s), you recently declared complete<br/>&gt; sadness at something Kraig said, regarding &quot;having made progress&quot;.<br/>&gt; Well, my dear guitar-toting friend, you have Completely Misread My<br/>&gt; Comments To Joseph.</p><p>You might want to ask Joseph what he thinks about that.
