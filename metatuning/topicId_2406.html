Scientists of Bashkir<br/>State University have found indisputable proofs of an<br/>ancient highly developed civilization&sup1;s existence. The<br/>question is about a great plate found in 1999, with<br/>picture of the region done according to an unknown<br/>technology. This is a real relief map. Today&sup1;s military<br/>has almost similar maps. The map contains civil<br/>engineering works: a system of channels with a length<br/>of about 12,000 km, weirs, powerful dams. Not far from<br/>the channels, diamond-shaped grounds are shown, whose<br/>destination is unknown. The map also contains some<br/>inscriptions. Even numerous inscriptions. At first, the<br/>scientists thought that was Old Chinese language.<br/>Though, it turned out that the subscriptions were done<br/>in a hieroglyphic-syllabic language of unknown origin.<br/>The scientists never managed to read itÂŠ<br/>...<br/>&sup3;How did we manage to identify the place? At first, we<br/>could not imagine the map was so ancient. Happily,<br/>relief of today&sup1;s Bashkiria has not changed so much<br/>within millions of years. We could identify Ufa Height,<br/>while Ufa Canyon is the main point of our proofs,<br/>because we carried out geological studies and found its<br/>track where it must be according to the ancient map.<br/>Displacement of the canyon happened because of tectonic<br/>stabs which moved from East. The group of Russian and<br/>Chinese specialists in the field of cartography,<br/>physics, mathematics, geology, chemistry, and Old<br/>Chinese language managed to precisely find out that the<br/>stab contains the map of Ural region, with rivers<br/>Belya, Ufimka, Sutolka,&sup2; &shy; Alexandr Chuvyrov said while<br/>showing the lines on the stone to the journalists. &shy;<br/>You can see Ufa Canyon &shy; the break of the earth&sup1;s<br/>crust, stretched out from the city of Ufa to the city<br/>of Sterlitimak. At the moment, Urshak River runs over<br/>the former canyon.&sup2; The map is done on a scale 1 : 1.1<br/>km.<br/>...<br/>Geological structure of the stab was determined: it<br/>consists of three levels. The base is 14 cm thick, made<br/>of the firmest dolomite. The second level is probably<br/>the most interesting, &sup3;made&sup2; of diopside glas. The<br/>technology of its treatement is not known to modern<br/>science. Actually, the picture is marked on this level.<br/>While the third level is 2 mm thick and made of calcium<br/>porcelain protecting the map from external impact.</p><p>&sup3;It should be noticed, - the professor said, - that the<br/>relief has not been manually made by an ancient<br/>stonecutter. It is simply impossible. It is obvious<br/>that the stone was machined.&sup2; X-ray photographs<br/>confirmed that the stab was of artificial origin and<br/>has been made with some precision tools.</p><p>...</p><p>etc!!</p></div><h3><a id=2407 href="#2407">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/1/2002 4:15:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
