He oversees a dead boy being put into an ambulance. The<br/>sequence is not good enough. He gives stage directions. The boy is<br/>taken out again, transferred pointlessly to another stretcher, put<br/>back in the ambulance. Daher makes sure there is a clear field of<br/>view for the camera and the blanket over the boy is pulled back so<br/>that his face can be seen.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vPAkc5CLgc&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Foutcut%">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vPAkc5CLgc&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Foutcut%</a><br/>2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F08%2Fndr%2Dlsst%2Ddie%2Dgrne%2Dbombe%<br/>2Dplatzen%2Ehtm</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/> The below youtube video is a duplicate of the above video.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vPAkc5CLgc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vPAkc5CLgc</a><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>  I&apos;ve seen more faked photos of the Qana event.
