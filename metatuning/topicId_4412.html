Do you own a car?<br/>&gt;Did you create it? Who created it? Who has the right to<br/>&gt;set its price?</p><p>Its price is set by the market.  I trade my labor for<br/>a convenient medium of exchange (&quot;dollars&quot;) at a rate<br/>my employer and I negotiate without government<br/>interference.  I take those dollars and troll the local<br/>car dealer and see what I can work out, again without<br/>government coercion.   Or I talk to my next door neighbor,<br/>who&apos;s got a car nobody seems to use much, and ask if he<br/>wants to sell it.  Good basic barter.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;and I claim the right to trade peacefully with others,<br/>&gt;&gt;without interference.</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;Who gives you that right?</p><p>I claim it as the inalienable right of all free individuals to<br/>trade peacefully with others.</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;Who protects you from pirates?</p><p>The government of the size and scope that I consider legitimate<br/>concerns itself with such things.</p><p>&gt;I say, you are not protected from pirates, but the pirates<br/>&gt;have been bred fairly tame.</p><p>Uhhh, you lost me there.</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Governments are free-market entities that must survive, like<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;everything else.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;No they&apos;re not. Bill Gates doesn&apos;t force sales at the point<br/>&gt;&gt;of a gun.</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;But it&apos;s getting to the point where I couldn&apos;t survive without<br/>&gt;Bill Gates. Certainly, where I was raised, I couldn&apos;t survive<br/>&gt;without a car. Was I coerced into working 40-hour weeks for<br/>&gt;years to afford one?</p><p>Bill&apos;s face is out there, no question, and to vow to avoid him<br/>means to close many doors.  Therefore what?  Let us be very<br/>careful that the &quot;cure&quot; is not worse than the &quot;disease&quot;.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;George Bush does.</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;I long for the day without compulsory financing. Meanwhile I<br/>&gt;suspect that people are forced to pay taxes for a reason --<br/>&gt;they otherwise lack the clarity to behave. So it&apos;s a choice<br/>&gt;between freely-chosen chaos and order at the point of a gun.<br/>&gt;I&apos;m honestly not sure which I&apos;d rather have.</p><p>Are you serious?  You are scaring me.</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;What&apos;s Freedom? What does it work for?</p><p>Well dang, what is not clear here?  The idea that each one of us<br/>makes his own determination of what he will spend his efforts<br/>creating, and goes about freely marketing the fruits of his<br/>labors to others.</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;I notice the strike-the-root site only accepts articles<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;that support certain fundamental doctrines. A very<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;distressing sign of political methodology. On the tuning<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;tuning list we don&apos;t delete posts advocating 12-tET.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;LOL! Are you condemning any site that takes a stand? Would,<br/>&gt;&gt;according to the Carl Lumma school of Perfect Society, everyone<br/>&gt;&gt;be forced to post a representative sample of every viewpoint?<br/>&gt;&gt;Now THERE&apos;s a Utopia for you; I can&apos;t wait!</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;I simply stated that this is not a scientific methodology, a<br/>&gt;fact of which I&apos;m sure you&apos;re well aware. Naturally, he has<br/>&gt;the obligation to post only what he wants. But if he wants to<br/>&gt;restrict scientific discourse, our ability to trust his<br/>&gt;publication goes down.</p><p>&quot;Scientific methodology&quot; has little relevance here, in my view.</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;Leave the shirt-tearing at home.</p><p>Sorry, you lost me again.</p><p>I know I&apos;m way behind in responding to other posts of yours; will<br/>make up as I&apos;m able.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=4415 href="#4415">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2003 10:26:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;Who protects you from pirates?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The government of the size and scope that I consider legitimate<br/>&gt;concerns itself with such things.</p><p>So there is place for a government, after all.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I say, you are not protected from pirates, but the pirates<br/>&gt;&gt;have been bred fairly tame.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Uhhh, you lost me there.</p><p>In this allegory our governments are pirates, after years of<br/>being forced to obey things like constitutions.</p><p>&gt;&gt;But it&apos;s getting to the point where I couldn&apos;t survive without<br/>&gt;&gt;Bill Gates.

Therefore what?</p><p>Let me say the answer to this is equivalent to the answer to<br/>the question &quot;Was I coerced into working 40-hour weeks for years<br/>to afford a car?&quot;.</p><p>&gt;Let us be very careful that the &quot;cure&quot; is not worse than<br/>&gt;the &quot;disease&quot;.</p><p>No worries; the antitrust action against microsoft amounted<br/>to literally nothing.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I long for the day without compulsory financing.

Would you rather be completely<br/>free and have to defend your family every night from thugs, or<br/>have no choice but to pay tribute to some big thugs and have<br/>some reasonable expectation of safety?</p><p>&gt;&gt;What&apos;s Freedom?
