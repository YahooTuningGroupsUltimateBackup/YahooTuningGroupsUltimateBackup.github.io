(or of course just empty ones web cache).</p><p>It works on ones own machine (as a proxy server) so one<br/>isn&apos;t dependent on connection to a remote site.</p><p>It&apos;s a neat program - I got the idea about how to add textures<br/>to FTS by looking at it.</p><p>Occ. you come across an ad it doesn&apos;t block &amp; need to add that in.<br/>Some recent yahoogroups ads have been using<br/><a href="http://us.a1.yimg.com/">http://us.a1.yimg.com/</a><br/>so I&apos;ve blocked that, which got rid of them.</p><p>I also found it wasn&apos;t showing the FTS web site stats, but that was<br/>because sitemeter is on the list of blocked urls, - so had<br/>to be removed before I could see them - I suppose that is<br/>because of the sitemeter graphic at the bottom of every page<br/>with the counter on it.</p><p>Anyway, now all my browsing is blissfully ad free :-).</p><p>Reading posts off-line is also nice, kind of leisurely<br/>way of doing things. We have a high volume here, but<br/>other lists may have posts every few days, and they<br/>can go on for years like that, so one doesn&apos;t have to<br/>have quite such a rapid turn around of the conversations<br/>all the time.</p><p>......................................................</p><p>You do still get the extra page at times but it is just a blank<br/>page with the [Ad here] thing on it so it isn&apos;t so distracting at all.</p><p>Also the <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> ads - I was browsing there the other day and<br/>suddenly the whole browser window turned gray so that one couldn&apos;t<br/>read anything in it any more - it turned out to be an advert<br/>to join the US army. You had to click a button to dismiss it<br/>in order to continue. It happened twice.</p><p>Anyway proxymitron gets rid of all the <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> ads too.</p><p>You have to set up your browser to use a proxy server to use<br/>it but there is nothing to that - in Win 98:</p><p>You go to Tools | Internet Ooptions | Connections<br/>| Settings, select use a proxy server, and then go to<br/>Advanced | proxy address &amp; enter address: localhost Port: 8088</p><p>- explained somewhere in the help for proxymitron.</p><p>I wonder what will happen if everyone starts to use proxymitron<br/>and the like? Maybe more and more disguised urls in the adverts...</p><p>Anyway it is working well at this present time.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
