Exxon Mobil Corporation, which admits it was &gt; behind the criminal complaint brought by Homeland Security against me &gt; and television producer Matt Pascarella, has informed me that the oil &gt; company will no longer push charges that Pascarella and I threatened &gt; &quot;critical infrastructure.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The allegedly criminal act, which put us on the wrong side of &gt; post-9/11 anti-terror law, was our filming of Exxon&apos;s Baton Rouge &gt; refinery where, nearby, 1,600 survivors of Hurricane Katrina remain &gt; interned behind barbed wire.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have sworn to Homeland Security that we no longer send our footage &gt; to al-Qaeda -- which, in any case, can get a much better view of the &gt; refinery and other &quot;critical infrastructure&quot; at Google maps &gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.gregpalast.com/mailing/link.php?URL=aHR0cDovL21hcHMuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9tYXBzP2Y9cSZhbXA7aGw9ZW4mYW1wO3E9NDA0NStTY2VuaWMrSHd5LCtCYXRvbitSb3VnZSwrTEErNzA4MDUmYW1wO2llPVVURjgmYW1wO3o9MTUmYW1wO2xsPTMwLjQ4NzE0MywtOTEuMTY5MTQzJmFtcDtzcG49MC4wMTY1MzEsMC4wNTQyNDUmYW1wO3Q9ayZhbXA7b209MSZhbXA7aXdsb2M9QQ%3D%3D&Name=&EncryptedMemberID=MzI0OTk%3D&CampaignID=32&CampaignStatisticsID=12&Demo=0&Email=mwasley@">http://www.gregpalast.com/mailing/link.php?URL=aHR0cDovL21hcHMuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9tYXBzP2Y9cSZhbXA7aGw9ZW4mYW1wO3E9NDA0NStTY2VuaWMrSHd5LCtCYXRvbitSb3VnZSwrTEErNzA4MDUmYW1wO2llPVVURjgmYW1wO3o9MTUmYW1wO2xsPTMwLjQ4NzE0MywtOTEuMTY5MTQzJmFtcDtzcG49MC4wMTY1MzEsMC4wNTQyNDUmYW1wO3Q9ayZhbXA7b209MSZhbXA7aXdsb2M9QQ%3D%3D&Name=&EncryptedMemberID=MzI0OTk%3D&CampaignID=32&CampaignStatisticsID=12&Demo=0&Email=mwasley@</a>...&gt;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Given Exxon&apos;s back-down, I hope to confirm with Homeland Security, &gt; Baton Rouge, that charges will be dropped today.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Matt and I want to thank you, our readers and viewers, for your &gt; extraordinary and heartfelt responses.  Public support undoubtedly led &gt; Exxon to call off the feds. &gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, this was never about our tipping off Osama that Louisiana &gt; contains oil refineries.  This has an awful lot to do with a petroleum &gt; giant&apos;s sensitivity to unflattering depictions of their plants which &gt; are major polluters along Louisiana&apos;s notorious &quot;Cancer Alley.&quot; &gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve learned that, in April last year, Exxon brought a similar &gt; Homeland Security charge against Willie Fontenot, an assistant to the &gt; Attorney General of Louisiana. Fontenot was guiding a group of &gt; environmental studies pupils from Antioch College on a tour of Cancer &gt; Alley.  Exxon&apos;s complaint about the &quot;national security&quot; threat posed &gt; by their photos of the company&apos;s facility cost Fontenot his job.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The issue is not national security but image security.  You can get &gt; all the film you want from Exxon of refineries if you&apos;ll accept nice, &gt; sanitized VPRs (video press releases) of clean smokestacks surrounded &gt; by happy herons.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s dangerous is not that reporters will end up in Guantanamo; the &gt; insidious effect of these threats is to keep networks from filming &gt; government and corporate filth, incompetence and inhumanity.  Besides &gt; the Exxon foolishness, our camera crew was also blocked from filming &gt; inside the notorious Katrina survivors trailer encampment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Furthermore earlier that same day, a FEMA contractor had grabbed our &gt; camera, in mid-interview, when polite but pointed questions exposed &gt; their malfeasance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As with Exxon, the bar from filming at the refugee camp and in the &gt; offices of the government contractor were presented to us as a &gt; &quot;Homeland Security&quot; matter. &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After the September 11 attacks, CBS Newsman Dan Rather said, &quot;George &gt; Bush is the President. &iuml;&iquest;&half;Wherever he wants me to line up, just tell me &gt; where.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reporters who step out of line, who ask uncomfortable questions and &gt; film uncomfortable scenes, soon find their careers toasted, as Dan can &gt; attest to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One of George Bush&apos;s weirder acts in office (and that&apos;s saying a lot) &gt; was to move FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose main &gt; job is to save us from floods and earthquakes, into the control of the &gt; Department of Homeland Security.  Exxon&apos;s refineries, once &quot;pollution &gt; source points&quot; scrutinized by government watchdogs, are now &quot;critical &gt; infrastructure&quot; protected by federal hounddogs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As the front lines in the War on Terror expand from Baghdad to Baton &gt; Rouge, we find that America has been made secure only against hard &gt; news and uncomfortable facts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, our sincere thanks and gratitude for your support.
