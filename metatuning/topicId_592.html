I only obtained a B.S. (I bet<br/>&gt; you like that, don&apos;t you).</p><p>Oh it&apos;s fine with me. I think credentials are silly<br/>and when people call attention to their own I usually<br/>am suspicious. Actually I liked you as a Doctor better<br/>since it worked better for the &quot;Doctors&quot; routine. Was<br/>also trying to figure a way to get in a reference to<br/>the Bobsey Twins, but you&apos;ve smoked me out so I&apos;ll lay<br/>it aside.</p><p>&gt; I stopped pursuing the subject because, once I understood<br/>&gt; quantum mechanics, it was clear that my innate interests<br/>&gt; could only be satisfied by exploring the philosophy of<br/>&gt; quantum mechanics rather than further details of physics.</p><p>Sounds like a wise decision and one I can respect.</p><p>&gt; I toy with the idea of going back to school in philosophy,<br/>&gt; but music currently interests me much more.</p><p>That&apos;s good. Experience is so much more valuable, in my<br/>opinion, than dragging along at some institute feeding<br/>the academic money mill. Of course there are exceptions<br/>and good reasons to do so but it seems many people drag<br/>on their formal education far longer than needed to do<br/>them any good or expand their mind or what have you,<br/>and gain little but a tragic debt situation and apathy<br/>towards a field they were once greatly interested in.<br/>It&apos;s a mark of intelligence and wisdom to know when to<br/>stop.</p><p>&gt; What do I do for a living? I do quantitative research for a<br/>&gt; financial company. They don&apos;t seem to mind me spending lots<br/>&gt; of time chatting on tuning lists!</p><p>Apparently not!! :-) But as long as you get your<br/>projects done, why not!</p><p>&gt; Sorry about the rude comment yesterday, but I felt you were<br/>&gt; being equally rude to John and John.
