Osama bin Laden is killed by the massive firepower of the U.S.</p><p>   . Osama bin Laden is captured, tried, and (if found guilty by<br/>     fairly presented evidence) locked up till he dies.</p><p>Which of these better serves the interests of the United States?  The<br/>former creates a martyr, a poster boy, a symbol in whose name new<br/>recruits to the cause of hatred toward the U.S. will be willing to die.<br/>The second?  He is still alive, rotting in prison.  Not such an<br/>attractive figure for sacrifice, I believe.</p><p>Perhaps catching bin Laden alive is impossible, I don&apos;t know.  But I<br/>would argue that if we can, we should.  And if we&apos;re smart, we should<br/>avoid imposing the death penalty, no matter how badly we lust to do so.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@...</h3><span>9/13/2001 6:17:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>And if we&apos;re smart, we should<br/>&gt; avoid imposing the death penalty, no matter how badly we lust to do<br/>so.</p><p>The only way that could be accomplished is if he is tried somewhere<br/>else, as in the Pan Am 103 case.</p></div>
