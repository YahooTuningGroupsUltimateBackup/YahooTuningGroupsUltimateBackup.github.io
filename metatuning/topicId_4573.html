It&apos;s a scary phenomenon --<br/>&gt;channels whose mandate used to be balanced and objective<br/>&gt;reporting are relying more and more on right-wing<br/>&gt;commentators.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Among these, few use rhetoric as hateful and violent as<br/>MSNBC&apos;s recent hire, Michael Savage.  Here are a few of his<br/>most pungent quotes (dozens more follow at the end of this<br/>message):</p><p>&quot;We need racist stereotypes right now of our enemy in order to<br/>encourage our warriors to kill the enemy,&quot; (San Francisco<br/>Chronicle, 2/6/03)</p><p>Speaking about kids killed by guns, he said, &quot;They&apos;re not<br/>kids, they&apos;re ghetto slime... they&apos;re the same kids that are<br/>in Sierra Leone toting AK47s.&quot; (Savage World, 5/15/00)</p><p>Savage&apos;s comments are atrocious.  But the real problem is<br/>that he&apos;s a trial balloon for MSNBC&apos;s rightward shift.  If<br/>viewers respond well to folks like Savage, we can expect<br/>MSNBC to be little more than Fox News II.</p><p>Please take five minutes to call MSNBC and let them know --<br/>speaking from the heart -- exactly how this kind of talk<br/>makes you feel about the network.  Explain that we&apos;d like<br/>them to be alternative to Fox News -- not another<br/>right-wing clone.</p><p>You can reach MSNBC at:</p><p>   (201) 583-5000</p><p>When you speak with a staff member, take a minute or two to<br/>tell them who you are, what you&apos;re calling about, and why it<br/>concerns or upsets you.  If you watch MSNBC, you may want to<br/>mention that as well.  Remember that the people you&apos;ll be<br/>talking to probably aren&apos;t personally responsible for putting<br/>Savage on the air; polite and calm comments are always more<br/>effective.</p><p>Then let us know you&apos;ve made your call by going to:</p><p>   <a href="http://www.moveon.org/mediacorps/msnbc.html">http://www.moveon.org/mediacorps/msnbc.html</a></p><p>Let&apos;s ask MSNBC to take the high road and serve the public<br/>interest, rather than pandering to racism and hatred.  Thanks<br/>for your participation.  Reports on Savage by FAIR and the<br/>Minority Media and Telecom Council follow.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>--Eli Pariser<br/>  International Campaigns Director<br/>  <a href="http://MoveOn.org">MoveOn.org</a><br/>  April 3, 2003</p><p>---------------</p><p>FAIR ACTION ALERT:<br/>GE, Microsoft Bring Bigotry to Life<br/>Hate-talk host Michael Savage hired by MSNBC<br/><a href="http://www.fair.org/activism/msnbc-savage.html">http://www.fair.org/activism/msnbc-savage.html</a></p><p>February 12, 2003</p><p>The latest hire by the cable news network MSNBC-- co-owned by<br/>General Electric/NBC and Microsoft-- is Michael Savage, a<br/>radio talk show host noted for his unabashed bigotry. Savage<br/>is scheduled to have his own weekly one-hour show on MSNBC<br/>beginning in March.</p><p>Savage routinely refers to non-white countries as &quot;turd world<br/>nations&quot; and charges that the U.S. &quot;is being taken over by the<br/>freaks, the cripples, the perverts and the mental defectives&quot;<br/>(San Francisco Bay Guardian, 9/20/00). In a recent broadcast<br/>he justified ethnic slurs as a national security tool: &quot;We<br/>need racist stereotypes right now of our enemy in order to<br/>encourage our warriors to kill the enemy,&quot; he explained (San<br/>Francisco Chronicle, 2/6/03).</p><p>&quot;Turd world&quot; immigrants are a frequent target of Savage&apos;s<br/>anger: &quot;You open the door to them, and the next thing you<br/>know, they are defecating on your country and breeding out of<br/>control&quot; (Oregonian, 4/24/02).</p><p>At times Savage&apos;s arguments echo the conspiratorial<br/>scapegoating of the white supremacist movement: &quot;With the<br/>[Latino] population that has emerged, since they breed like<br/>rabbits, in many cases the whites will become a minority in<br/>their own nation... The white people don&apos;t breed as often for<br/>whatever reason. I guess many homosexuals are involved. That<br/>is also part of the grand plan, to push homosexuality to cut<br/>down on the white race&quot; (San Francisco Bay Guardian, 9/20/00).</p><p>Commenting on the &quot;Million Mom March&quot; in favor of gun control<br/>(which he dubbed the &quot;Million Dyke March&quot;), he dismissed<br/>organizers&apos; reference to American children killed by guns<br/>(5/15/00): &quot;They&apos;re not kids, they&apos;re ghetto slime... they&apos;re<br/>the same kids that are in Sierra Leone toting AK47s.&quot;</p><p>Misogyny and homophobia are staples of Savage&apos;s show as well<br/>as racism. In his book Savage Nation, he argues that Sen.<br/>Hillary Clinton and Supreme Court justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg<br/>and Sandra Day O&apos;Connor have &quot;feminized and homosexualized<br/>much of America, to the point where the nation has become<br/>passive, receptive and masochistic.&quot;</p><p>Discussing student volunteers distributing food to the<br/>homeless in San Francisco, Savage declared that &quot;the girls<br/>from Branson [school] can go in and maybe get raped... because<br/>they seem to like the excitement of it. There&apos;s always the<br/>thrill and possibility they&apos;ll be raped in a dumpster while<br/>giving out a turkey sandwich&quot; (San Francisco Bay Guardian,<br/>9/20/00).</p><p>In announcing the hire, MSNBC president Erik Sorenson<br/>described Savage as &quot;brash, passionate and smart,&quot; and<br/>promised that he would provide &quot;compelling opinion and<br/>analysis with an edge.&quot;</p><p>----------------</p><p>&gt;From the Minority Media and Telecom Council:</p><p>AN AGGREGATION OF WHITE SUPREMACY<br/>IN THE PAPER TRAIL OF MICHAEL SAVAGE<br/><a href="http://www.mmtconline.org/">http://www.mmtconline.org/</a></p><p> * On the day before Yom Kippur in 1999, Savage played tapes<br/>of Adolf Hitler&apos;s speeches over German military music.</p><p> * Savage suggested that homeless people are &quot;living rats&quot; who<br/>should be run off the streets and put in state hospitals.</p><p> * Referring to Asians as &quot;little soy eaters&quot; and Chinese<br/>people &quot;little devils,&quot; Savage called for dropping nuclear<br/>weapons on China and said that Chinese-Americans should be put<br/>in internment camps if they wouldn&apos;t sign loyalty oaths.</p><p> * Savage declared that &quot;the next time you&apos;re in your backyard<br/>grilling hot dogs, don&apos;t be surprised if your Korean neighbor<br/>is actually grilling his dog. That&apos;s the way things are done<br/>in Korea.&quot;</p><p> * Pronouncing Trent Lott&apos;s endorsement of Strom Thurmond&apos;s<br/>1948 presidential candidacy &quot;innocent comments,&quot; Savage<br/>nonetheless labeled the members of the Congressional Black<br/>Caucus who voiced opposition to the comments &quot;a lynch mob&quot; --<br/>even though it was Thurmond&apos;s campaign that opposed<br/>antilynching laws.</p><p> * Savage referred to the National Council of La Raza as &quot;a<br/>racist group,&quot; the Mexican American Legal Defense and<br/>Education Fund (MALDEF) as &quot;an Anti-American racist group,&quot;<br/>and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund as &quot;an<br/>antiwhite pressure group.&quot; He used the term &quot;radical front<br/>group&quot; to attack the League of Women Voters and the<br/>Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.</p><p> * Savage is reported to have said that the &quot;liberal media&quot;<br/>was covering up the fact that James Byrd, the black Texan who<br/>was murdered and then dragged behind a truck, was a coke<br/>dealer and his murder was an attempted sale gone bad.</p><p> * Savage has characterized Mahatma Gandhi as a<br/> &quot;diaper-wearing moron&quot; who was responsible for the 1947 split<br/> between India and Pakistan (which Gandhi actually opposed).</p><p> * On CNN&apos;s &quot;Talkback Live,&quot; Savage told Charles Barkley, who<br/>was considering a bid for the Republican nomination for<br/>Governor of Alabama, &quot;You&apos;re a dumb basketball player. Go<br/>dribble a ball. Go dribble a ball. You couldn&apos;t shine my<br/>shoes, buster.&quot;</p><p> * Discussing the government&apos;s use of media during World War<br/>II, Savage declared &quot;we need racist stereotypes right now of<br/>our enemy in order to encourage our warriors to kill the enemy.&quot;</p><p> * According to Savage, Muslims &quot;created nothing in a thousand<br/>years. They cut throats and blow things up....The women just<br/>want to have mustaches and wear veils.&quot;</p><p> * Savage routinely refers to non-white countries as &quot;turd<br/>world nations,&quot; and declared that &quot;[g]eese are like immigrants.<br/>You open the door to them and the next thing you know, they<br/>are defecating on your country and breeding out of control.&quot;</p><p> * Savage expressed this opinion of nonwhites: &quot;as long as<br/>[non-whites] are uncomfortable in a clean environment run by<br/>&apos;uptight&apos; white people, there&apos;s going to be racism. But as<br/>soon as America starts to look and stink like the Third<br/>World, they&apos;ll feel more at home.&quot;</p><p> * Commenting on the May, 2000 &quot;Million Mom March&quot; in favor of<br/>gun control (which he characterized as the &quot;Million Dyke<br/>March&quot;) he dismissed organizations&apos; references to American<br/>children killed by guns: &quot;They&apos;re not kids, they&apos;re ghetto<br/>slime...they&apos;re the same kids that are in Sierra Leone toting<br/>AK47s.&quot;</p><p> * Savage expressed this opinion of Hispanic Americans: &quot;with<br/>the [Latino] population that has emerged, since they breed<br/>like rabbits, in many cases the whites will become a minority<br/>in their own nation...The white people don&apos;t breed as often<br/>for whatever reason. I guess many homosexuals are involved.<br/>That is also part of the grand plan, to push homosexuality to<br/>cut down on the white race.&quot;</p><p>Sources: San Jose Mercury News, the San Francisco Chronicle,<br/>Los Angeles Times, and Fairness and Accuracy in Media (FAIR).</p></div><h3><a id=4577 href="#4577">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/3/2003 12:34:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: &quot;Chris Bailey&quot; &lt;chris@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;Undisclosed recipients:&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 03, 2003 9:11 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] Keep this sick racist @#$% off the air.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; FAIR ACTION ALERT:<br/>&gt; GE, Microsoft Bring Bigotry to Life<br/>&gt; Hate-talk host Michael Savage hired by MSNBC<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.fair.org/activism/msnbc-savage.html">http://www.fair.org/activism/msnbc-savage.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; February 12, 2003<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The latest hire by the cable news network MSNBC-- co-owned by<br/>&gt; General Electric/NBC and Microsoft-- is Michael Savage, a<br/>&gt; radio talk show host noted for his unabashed bigotry.
