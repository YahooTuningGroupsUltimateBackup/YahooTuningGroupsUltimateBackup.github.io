With George Bush in the White House,<br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger in the California State House, and Paul Bremer<br/>ruling Iraq, it was a chore just to get out of bed each morning.<br/>But get out of bed we did, and we spent our days educating,<br/>strategizing, organizing and mobilizing. As we greet the new year, let&iuml;&iquest;&half;s</p><p>remember and celebrate some of our hard-fought victories in a time of<br/>adversity.</p><p>1. We organized the most massive, global protests against war the world<br/>has ever seen. On February 15 alone, over12 million people came<br/>out on the streets in over 700 cities in 60countries and on every<br/>continent. So impressive was this outpouring of anti-war sentiment that<br/>the<br/>New York Times, not known for hyperbole, claimed there were now two<br/>superpowers: the US and global public opinion.</p><p>2. Over the last few months, mainstream Americans have been buying<br/>progressive books&iuml;&iquest;&half;by the millions. Authors such as Michael<br/>Moore, Al Franken, Molly Ivins, Paul Krugman and David Corn have seen<br/>their books soar to the New York Times bestsellers list. With<br/>humor and biting exposes of the Bush administration, these authors<br/>helped our movement gain legions of new converts. No more<br/>preaching to the choir this year!</p><p>3. When the World Trade Organization met in Cancun in September to<br/>promote global rules that give even greater power to transnational<br/>corporations, they were met by well-coordinated opposition from<br/>countries in the global south, hundreds of non-governmental<br/>organizations, and thousands of activists. When our movement&iuml;&iquest;&half;s<br/>sophisticated inside-outside strategy forced the talks to collapse,<br/>there was<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half;gloom in the suites and dancing in the streets.&iuml;&iquest;&half; And as a counter to<br/>these corporate-dominated global institutions, the fair trade movement<br/>had a stellar year.</p><p>4. The poorest country in South America, Bolivia, proved that people<br/>power is alive and well. Sparked bythe Bolivian president&iuml;&iquest;&half;s plan to<br/>privatize and export the nation&iuml;&iquest;&half;s natural gas, an astounding grassroots<br/>movement of peasants, miners, workers, and indigenous people<br/>poured into the streets to demand his resignation. After five weeks of<br/>intense protests and a government crackdown that left 70dead,<br/>Sanchez de Lozada was forced to resign. Now that&iuml;&iquest;&half;s regime change!</p><p>5. The silver lining in the budget crisis affecting the states<br/>throughout this nation is that from Louisiana to Texas to Michigan&iuml;&iquest;&half;and<br/>even<br/>in Arnold Schwarzenegger&iuml;&iquest;&half;s California&iuml;&iquest;&half;state governments are cutting<br/>prison budgets by releasing non-violent drugoffenders. The year<br/>has been marked by a steady move toward treatment instead of<br/>incarceration and a greater understanding that drug abuse should be<br/>handled<br/>in the doctors&iuml;&iquest;&half; office, not the prison cell.</p><p>6. For so long, celebrities have put their careers above their beliefs.<br/>This year witnessed a &iuml;&iquest;&half;coming out&iuml;&iquest;&half; of allt ypes of celebrities on all<br/>manner of progressive issues.  Jay-Z and Mariah Carey railed against the<br/>racist Rockefeller drug laws, Bono and Beyonce Knowles called<br/>for the world to fight AIDS, and a host of celebs such as Sean Penn,<br/>Susan Saradon and Laurence Fishbourne courageously took a stand<br/>against the invasion of Iraq.</p><p>7. Progressives now have a powerful new tool for organizing: the<br/>internet. E-activism through venues such as MoveOn, Working Assets,<br/>and <a href="http://Meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> have allowed ordinary people to challenge big money and<br/>powerful institutions. We raised millions of dollars to run ads,<br/>we&iuml;&iquest;&half;ve confronted corporate-dominated institutions like the Federal<br/>Communications Commission, and e-activism has allowed an anti-war<br/>candidate, Howard Dean, to become a frontrunner in the 2004 elections.</p><p>8. In an unprecedented outpouring of local opposition to the assault on<br/>our civil liberties, over 200 cities, towns, counties, and states across</p><p>the country have passed resolutions against the Patriot Act. In fact,<br/>the outcry has been so profound that plans for a successor act, dubbed<br/>Patriot Act II, that would further broaden federal investigatory powers,<br/>have been scuttled.</p><p>9. While eclipsed by the war in Iraq, the corporate scandals that topped<br/>the headlines in 2002 continued in 2003,with indefatigable New<br/>York State Attorney-General Eliot Spitzer exposing the trading abuses in<br/>the mutual funds industry. The Enron, WorldCom and<br/>accounting scandals produced some positive legislation against corporate<br/>crime and forced institutional investors like pension funds to<br/>become more active. And anti-corporate crusaders joined with peace<br/>activists to expose the obscene war profiteering of Halliburton and<br/>Bechtel&iuml;&iquest;&half;with more exposes to come in 2004!</p><p>10.  Despite the conservative takeover of the courts, this year produced<br/>several landmark rulings we can be proud of. The Supreme Court<br/>upheld affirmative action, giving a sweeping victory to the University<br/>of Michigan and colleges all over the country. It struck down<br/>sodomy laws criminalizing gay sex, affirming the constitutional right to<br/>privacy. The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that gays should<br/>be able to marry. The Appeals Court ruled that the US military could not<br/>detain American citizen Jose Padilla as an &iuml;&iquest;&half;enemy combatant&iuml;&iquest;&half;,<br/>and in an even more significant decision, found that all 600 detainees<br/>at Guantanamo Bay should be granted access to lawyers.</p><p>There are many more&iuml;&iquest;&half;the immigrants&iuml;&iquest;&half; freedom march that crisscrossed the<br/>nation to counter the anti-immigrant backlash, the amazing<br/>youth movement that is bringing new culture and vibrancy to organizing,<br/>the renewed women&iuml;&iquest;&half;s activism through groups like Code Pink,<br/>the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to an Iranian women Shirin Ebadi.<br/>And each one of us could add to the list.</p><p>So while we lament the present state of the world and the present<br/>occupant in the White House, just remember that even in the gloomiest<br/>days of 2003, we kept slugging away&iuml;&iquest;&half;and sometimes even winning.
