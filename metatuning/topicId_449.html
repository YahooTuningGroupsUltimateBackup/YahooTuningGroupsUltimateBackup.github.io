Info on where it came from is<br/>at the bottom.</p><p>Sorry it came as high priority. I use the priority<br/>thing as a bookmarker in Outlook and try to turn it off<br/>before forwarding or replying but there&apos;s a bug in<br/>Outlook where that doesn&apos;t always work.</p><p>Also, I want to say that I agree with Scott Peck (The<br/>Road Less Travelled, etc) who is mentioned in the<br/>article -- we have to eventually realize that there<br/>really is true evil in the world.</p><p>The terrorists we are dealing with, whoever they are,<br/>are NOT men of faith and religion, regardless of what<br/>we are told. The are not muslims even if they say they<br/>are</p><p>Neither should we assume that everyone in our own<br/>churches are godly person just because they are sitting<br/>there, or preaching, or whatever.</p><p>If you are a Christian, a Jew, a Muslim, or even a<br/>Hindu, your faith outlines the *reality* of demonic<br/>presences. Not a myth. Not a convenient representation<br/>of a psychological principle, but a reality. This<br/>is what we are dealing with from the terrorists.<br/>And I believe we are starting to see deceptions with<br/>this source coming from our own government, our media,<br/>and academia. The lie can be very close to the truth<br/>and that is when it is most seductive.</p><p>Be kind to your Muslim neighbors!</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
