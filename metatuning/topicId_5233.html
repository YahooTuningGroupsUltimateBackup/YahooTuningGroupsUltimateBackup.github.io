By all accounts, Uday Hussein,<br/>the elder, was a sexual<br/>predator and murderer, while Qusay, as chief of Iraq&apos;s notorious<br/>security apparatus, had even<br/>more blood on his hands. Given the reactionary nature of the regime,<br/>there is no reason to doubt<br/>the extent and depth of their crimes.</p><p>Having said that, both the means by which Hussein&apos;s sons were liquidated<br/>and the manner in<br/>which the killings were greeted by the American government and media<br/>speak volumes about the<br/>nature of the US intervention in Iraq and the character of the American<br/>political establishment.</p><p>On the plane of morality, there exist no fundamental differences between<br/>the personnel of the<br/>Hussein regime and the Bush administration. The latter operates in every<br/>sphere with unashamed<br/>lawlessness and violence. If there is a difference in the degree of<br/>brutality against its own<br/>citizens, the &quot;restraint&quot; exercised by the Bush forces is a matter of<br/>circumstance rather than<br/>moral superiority over the killers and torturers of the ousted Iraqi<br/>regime.</p><p>In the operation against the Hussein brothers the US military mobilized<br/>hundreds of troops and<br/>dozens of vehicles and aircraft. The American forces used automatic<br/>weapons, rockets,<br/>rocket-propelled grenades and tow missiles against four individuals<br/>armed with AK-47<br/>automatic rifles.</p><p>The assault had the character of a gangland slaying, the vengeful wiping<br/>out of the cornered<br/>leadership of one gang by a more powerful and better-armed outfit. An<br/>unnamed senior US<br/>military official in Iraq spoke like a Mafia don, telling the UPI: &quot;This<br/>is a very beneficial hit.<br/>They cannot feel anything other than doom, since if we can take down<br/>these guys, we can take<br/>down anybody.&quot;</p><p>The exultation of US and British officials and the media over the<br/>killings in Mosul-which<br/>included the death of the 14-year-old son of Qusay Hussein, Mustapha-can<br/>only arouse<br/>revulsion. The pleasure that these circles take in bloodletting and<br/>violence has a pathological<br/>character.</p><p>President George W. Bush boasted, &quot;Now more than ever Iraqis can know<br/>the former regime is<br/>gone and is not coming back.&quot; Senator Ted Kennedy, the dean of<br/>Democratic &quot;liberals,&quot;<br/>expressed satisfaction over the killings. &quot;It&apos;s progress,&quot; he said.</p><p>Britain&apos;s Prime Minister Tony Blair was less restrained, declaring,<br/>&quot;This is a great day for the<br/>new Iraq.&quot;</p><p>The American media was both jubilant and bloodthirsty. The New York<br/>Daily News carried<br/>photos of Saddam Hussein and his two sons, with red crosses placed over<br/>Uday and Qusay, and<br/>the words, &quot;One to go.&quot; Rupert Murdoch&apos;s New York Post, headlined its<br/>editorial<br/>&quot;E-RAT-ICATED!&quot;</p><p>The New York Times also celebrated the &quot;hit&quot; in Mosul, calling the<br/>assassination of the Hussein<br/>brothers &quot;the most encouraging news out of Iraq in weeks.&quot; The editors<br/>of the Washington<br/>Post called the deaths &quot;very good news indeed&quot; and went on to claim that<br/>the killings &quot;meant a<br/>serious blow to the diehard resistance that has plagued the postwar<br/>administration.&quot;</p><p>The notion that the murders in Mosul will halt Iraqi resistance to the<br/>US colonial occupation of<br/>that country is wishful thinking of the most politically blinkered<br/>variety. The American<br/>government and media establishment apparently believes its own<br/>propaganda that the only<br/>opposition to the US presence is being offered by &quot;holdouts&quot; of the old<br/>regime, &quot;terrorists&quot; and<br/>&quot;criminals.&quot;</p><p>These people are so blind to social and political reality and so distant<br/>from the Iraqi people that<br/>they cannot conceive of popular resistance that rejects both the<br/>Ba&apos;athist regime and foreign<br/>imperialist tyranny. Attacks on US forces continued unabated July 23, as<br/>two more American<br/>soldiers died and nine were wounded in attacks.</p><p>Why were they not taken alive?</p><p>Why was no effort made to capture Uday and Qusay Hussein alive? When<br/>asked about this, Lt.<br/>Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, who was in charge of the operation, answered<br/>blandly, &quot;Our mission is to<br/>find, kill or capture.&quot;</p><p>A number of factors come into play. After weeks of US deaths and sagging<br/>troop morale,<br/>American officials no doubt concluded that a murderous assault would<br/>boost the spirits of the<br/>war constituency in the US and the psychotic element in the military. In<br/>any event, they share the<br/>outlook of this constituency and were in need of a bloodletting<br/>themselves. The pent-up rage and<br/>vindictiveness, in the face of growing Iraqi resistance, expressed<br/>itself in the extermination of<br/>Hussein&apos;s sons.</p><p>More fundamentally, the capture of Uday and Qusay Hussein presented<br/>politically troublesome<br/>problems. Putting the two former officials on trial would have<br/>inevitably raised the issue of the<br/>entirely lawless character of the war and occupation. The Hussein<br/>brothers would not have<br/>found it a great challenge to turn the tables on their prosecutors and<br/>expose the hypocrisy and<br/>criminality of the Anglo-American operation in Iraq.</p><p>We have the example of the ongoing Slobodan Milosevic war crimes trial<br/>in The Hague, which<br/>has turned into a fiasco for the US and NATO. The former Yugoslav<br/>president has already<br/>succeeded-during the prosecution phase of the case-in using the tribunal<br/>to expose the<br/>machinations of the great powers. Milosevic is expected to develop his<br/>arguments during the<br/>two years he will now have to present his defense.</p><p>Beyond the immediate situation in Iraq, there is the equally vexing<br/>question of the long-standing<br/>relationship between the US government, including some of its current<br/>leading officials, and the<br/>former Hussein regime.</p><p>In February 2003 the National Security Archive released 60 documents<br/>detailing the extent of<br/>the relations between the Reagan administration and the Iraqi government<br/>during the 1980s. At<br/>the time of the Iran-Iraq war the US, while claiming to be neutral in<br/>the conflict, supported<br/>Hussein against the Islamic regime in Teheran. The Archive notes that<br/>Washington, through<br/>direct and indirect means, provided financing, weaponry, intelligence<br/>and military support to<br/>Baghdad &quot;in accordance with policy directives from President Ronald<br/>Reagan,&quot; several years<br/>before the US restored formal relations with Iraq in November 1984.</p><p>A highlight of the process of normalizing American-Iraqi relations was<br/>the visit by then<br/>presidential envoy (and current Secretary of Defense) Donald Rumsfeld to<br/>Baghdad in<br/>December 1983, where he held a 90-minute conversation with Saddam<br/>Hussein. The US was<br/>well aware that the Iraqis were using chemical weapons against Iranian<br/>forces and Kurdish<br/>insurgents. Rumsfeld made no mention of the issue in this discussion. A<br/>secret memo sent to the<br/>State Department reported that &quot;Saddam Hussein showed obvious pleasure<br/>with [the] President&apos;s<br/>letter and Rumsfeld&apos;s visit and in his remarks.&quot;</p><p>As the New York Times reported in March 2003, the US and France were the<br/>sources of Iraq&apos;s<br/>biological weapons programs.</p><p>Iraqi officials have learned to their cost that whether a foreign leader<br/>is feted by Washington or<br/>assassinated depends entirely on the circumstances.</p><p>The assassination of the Hussein brothers has further undermined the<br/>claim that the US went to<br/>war to prevent the Iraqi regime from developing or using weapons of mass<br/>destruction (WMD).<br/>According to Judith Miller in the July 23 New York Times, Qusay Hussein<br/>&quot;was also<br/>responsible for overseeing Iraq&apos;s unconventional weapons. ... Stephen<br/>Black, a former inspector<br/>and chemical weapons expert, said that by virtue of his control of the<br/>security services, Qusay<br/>would have known, for instance, &apos;whether they had chemical weapons, how<br/>many they had, and<br/>where they were deployed.&apos; ... Finally, he said, Qusay would have known<br/>not the exact hiding<br/>places but the &apos;broad brushes of the concealment policy and<br/>practices-whether Saddam had<br/>destroyed or hidden weapons or the capability for just-in-time<br/>production, and what the goals of<br/>this concealment were.&apos;&quot;</p><p>Obviously, by taking the decision to murder Qusay, the US government and<br/>military expressed<br/>their total lack of interest in the existence of WMD and, in effect,<br/>acknowledged that such deadly<br/>and dangerous weapons do not exist.</p><p>US role at Nuremberg</p><p>The bloodlust and lawlessness of the present-day political establishment<br/>is placed in sharp relief<br/>by comparing its campaign of political assassination in Iraq with the<br/>attitude of the US to the<br/>treatment of fascist mass murderers captured at the end of World War II.</p><p>Less than sixty years ago, Washington opposed the summary execution of<br/>the leaders of Nazi<br/>Germany and Imperial Japan-who had committed crimes on a far more<br/>massive scale than any<br/>carried out by the regime of Saddam Hussein-and insisted they be placed<br/>on public trial and<br/>accorded all of the legal privileges of due process. The vast contrast<br/>between then and now<br/>underscores the break with any conception of democratic principles that<br/>has occurred within the<br/>American ruling elite.</p><p>The surviving Nazi leaders were responsible for the deaths, by genocide<br/>and war, of tens of<br/>millions, yet American officials were scrupulous in demanding that they<br/>be captured alive and<br/>placed on trial, as they eventually were, at the Nuremberg War Crimes<br/>Tribunal in 1945-46.<br/>Considerable pains were taken to ensure that the defendants not take<br/>their own lives. The US<br/>was insistent that the defendants be provided with counsel and access to<br/>evidence and that they<br/>be accorded the right to cross-examine witnesses.</p><p>Dennis Hutchinson of the University of Chicago in a November 18, 2001<br/>Chicago Tribune<br/>article cited the comments of Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson,<br/>chosen to represent the<br/>US in any post-war proceeding, explaining the options he presented to<br/>President Harry Truman:<br/>&quot;We could execute or otherwise punish them [the Nazi officials] without<br/>a hearing. But<br/>undiscriminating executions or punishments without definite findings of<br/>guilt, fairly arrived at,<br/>would ... not set easily on the American conscience or be remembered by<br/>our children with<br/>pride.&quot; Jackson insisted that the only appropriate &quot;course is to<br/>determine the innocence or guilt<br/>of the accused after a hearing as dispassionate as the times and horrors<br/>we deal with will permit,<br/>and upon a record that will leave our reasons and motives clear.&quot;</p><p>Jackson feared that summary executions would erode the moral high ground<br/>that the victorious<br/>powers enjoyed, according to Hutchinson, and that it was necessary as<br/>well to document the<br/>precise nature of the Nazi crimes for posterity. Jackson commented:<br/>&quot;Unless we write the record<br/>of this movement with clarity and precision, we cannot blame the future<br/>if in days of peace it<br/>finds incredible accusatory generalities uttered during the war. We must<br/>establish incredible<br/>events by credible evidence.&quot;</p><p>In a comment directly relevant to the current international situation,<br/>both in Iraq and<br/>Afghanistan, Jackson noted that the Allied triumph by itself did not<br/>provide the victors with the<br/>legal sanction to punish German officials, nor did Allied claims and<br/>proclamations. The guilt of<br/>the Nazi leaders had to be proven in a court of law.</p><p>Jackson declared, &quot;The president of the United States has no power to<br/>convict anyone. He can<br/>only accuse. He cannot arrest in most cases without judicial authority.<br/>Therefore, the accusation<br/>made carries no weight in an American trial whatsoever. These<br/>declarations are an accusation<br/>and not a conviction. That requires a judicial finding. Now we could not<br/>be parties to setting up<br/>a formal judicial body to ratify a political decision to convict. Then<br/>judges will have to inquire<br/>into the evidence and give an independent decision.&quot;</p><p>In his opening statement to the Nuremberg tribunal, Jackson said, &quot;That<br/>four great nations,<br/>flushed with victory and stung with injury, stay the hand of vengeance<br/>and voluntarily submit<br/>their captive enemies to the judgment of law is one of the most<br/>significant tributes that power<br/>has ever paid to reason.&quot;</p><p>Jackson&apos;s comments and actions were bound up with a certain fidelity to<br/>democratic principles<br/>that still held sway within the American ruling elite. They expressed as<br/>well a certain confidence<br/>in the prospects for US capitalism and the post-war world. They came<br/>from a position of relative<br/>political and economic strength.</p><p>The prevailing atmosphere in present-day Washington, which venerates<br/>repression and murder,<br/>represents the collapse of any adherence to democracy, at home and<br/>abroad. The Bush<br/>administration, which came to power through fraud and thuggery, serves<br/>the interests of a<br/>crisis-ridden ruling elite that can only hope to exercise power through<br/>the unrestrained use of<br/>violence on a global scale.</p><p>The campaign of political assassinations in Iraq is a further<br/>demonstration of the criminalization<br/>of the American ruling elite.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3>monz@...</h3><span>7/25/2003 8:02:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Kraig,</p><p>&gt; From: kraig grady [mailto:kraiggrady@...]<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, July 25, 2003 1:42 PM<br/>&gt; To: metatuning<br/>&gt; Subject: [metatuning] The killing of Hussein&apos;s sons: the Nuremberg<br/>&gt; precedent and the criminalization of the US ruling elite<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The killing of Hussein&apos;s sons: the<br/>&gt; Nuremberg precedent and the<br/>&gt; criminalization of the US ruling elite<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By David Walsh<br/>&gt; 24 July 2003<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the plane of morality, there exist no fundamental<br/>&gt; differences between the personnel of the Hussein<br/>&gt; regime and the Bush administration.
