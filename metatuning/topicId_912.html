He&apos;s<br/>recorded a CD, and says, in the Denver Post...&quot;The experience of feeling<br/>unsafe, unprotected, subject to random violence and hatred is new to<br/>most Americans. But for black people between 1619 and about 1965, that&apos;s<br/>what it meant to be (black)....We can gain great insight from a blues<br/>people. Especially now, as a whole country has the blues.&quot; Of course, he<br/>didn&apos;t mention the Native Americans, who not only have suffered<br/>enormously, but have had their whole country occupied by a foreign<br/>culture for the last few hundred years (which BTW, is still a living<br/>issue, not a remnant of the past. It&apos;s also something that not a lot of<br/>folks seem to talk about...but, I believe it&apos;s an enormously important<br/>concern). If the recent horrid events get folks to thinking about such<br/>profound and serious issues, there may indeed be hope for the future.<br/>For, if nations (and surely not just the US) can honestly look at their<br/>past mistakes, and vow to never commit them again, I believe that peace<br/>between the myriad cultures of the world is attainable...Hstick</p></div>
