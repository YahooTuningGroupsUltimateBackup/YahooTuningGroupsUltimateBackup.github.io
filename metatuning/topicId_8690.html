You know that if I<br/>&gt; write to my congresspeople askign them to curtail arms sales,<br/>&gt; they&apos;ll come back with the &quot;but people will lose jobs argument&quot;</p><p>Would they?  That argument doesn&apos;t hold any water as far as I&apos;m<br/>concerned.  A harder-to-debunk argument would be that extreme US<br/>military force is needed to keep the world running smoothly.  But<br/>I don&apos;t believe that either.</p><p>&gt; in other words, they can&apos;t turn  their backs on the people<br/>&gt; that funded their campaigns.<br/>&gt; In other words, the government is doing what it&apos;s doing<br/>&gt; largely at the behest of the corporations.</p><p>There&apos;s definitely feedback, but the government&apos;s desire<br/>for weapons is definitely primary in my view.</p><p>However, what if we replaced the word &quot;corporations&quot; in<br/>your statement, with the phrase &quot;the people who work for<br/>defense contractors&quot;.  And what if we replaced that<br/>phrase with the word &quot;people&quot;.  What changes?</p><p>&gt; another example: in &quot;Deterring Democracy&quot;,  Chomsky<br/>&gt; relates the tale of how the gov&apos;t tried to curtail<br/>&gt; cocaine trade by possibly going after corporations such<br/>&gt; as the companies that make chemicals for processing the<br/>&gt; cocoa plant into the refined drug,</p><p>What chemicals are those?  I don&apos;t know what they use...<br/>hydrochloric acid?  Whatever it is, it isn&apos;t specialized<br/>to extracting cocaine.</p><p>Chomsky is a nitwit.  He doesn&apos;t give references, and I&apos;m<br/>fairly certain his fact-checking is tabloid-quality.</p><p>&gt; and going after the banks that a lot of drug money was<br/>&gt; passing through.  Well maybe &quot;going after&quot; is too strong<br/>&gt; a term,  I think it was more like telling them &quot;don&apos;t sell<br/>&gt; to kingpins&quot;.  This was, of course, immediately stopped<br/>&gt; in it&apos;s tracks by corporate leaders.</p><p>In the model Kurt and I are discussing, profits are, or<br/>can be, an indicator of what activities humans should<br/>engage in.  In this case, they are indeed better indicators<br/>of that than the whims of the goverment -- cocaine<br/>prohibition is wrong.</p><p>&gt; And of course,  penalizing drug users  (in the case of<br/>&gt; cocaine, mostly rich white people), is highly difficult.</p><p>And lots of poor black people, in the case of crack.</p><p>&gt; Thus the only possible way to &quot;fight the drug problem&quot; was<br/>&gt; to throw as many poor blacks in jail as possible, for as<br/>&gt; long as possible; people who were understandbly unable<br/>&gt; to resist the temptation of taking their only available route<br/>&gt; towards making as much as upper-middle-class (or higher)<br/>&gt; white folk.</p><p>Yes, drug prohibition is wrong.</p><p>&gt; Contrasting the acts of the US gov&apos;t with the corporations<br/>&gt; they serve, for the most part, is misleading.</p><p>Not at all.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
