It&apos;s just statistics...</p><p>I think I remember hearing that one person in 20 who has ever been alive<br/>is alive today - is that right?  So that still means that 19/20 of<br/>the compositional talent has gone to past music.  Some of which is, of<br/>course, LONG gone.  However, I also believe that there are productive<br/>times and unproductive times for music.  The period 1770 thru 1830<br/>(boundaries chosen arbitrarily) was extremely productive, IMHO.  As for<br/>the period 1900 thru 1999?  Including &quot;popular&quot; music, extremely<br/>productive, I believe.  Of course, what is now &quot;classical&quot; music was<br/>&quot;popular&quot; music when it was young.  Maybe that&apos;s an important clue for<br/>us today!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>jpehrson@...</h3><span>6/2/2001 8:35:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/142">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/message/142</a></p><p>John...</p><p>Listen to Darius Milhaud, and then get back to me...</p><p>Try &quot;The Creation of the World...&quot;  (La Creation du Monde)</p><p>You won&apos;t be disappointed.</p><p>Milhaud uses a *lot* of &quot;polytonality,&quot; but it&apos;s VERY rooted...</p><p>probably would sound good in some kind of &quot;adaptive just&quot; as well...</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe</p><p>_________ _______ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2001 5:10:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Joseph Pehrson wrote:]<br/>&gt;John...</p><p>&gt;Listen to Darius Milhaud, and then get back to me...</p><p>&gt;Try &quot;The Creation of the World...&quot;  (La Creation du Monde)</p><p>Thanks for the recommendation!

Among others, that is one reason why I&apos;ve hung out<br/>on the tuning list (for instance, my most recent pleasure was<br/>discovering Jacky Ligon&apos;s &quot;Galunlati&quot;). But the music might be in<br/>tiny cracks and crevices, and you won&apos;t always know where or when<br/>you&apos;ll get it.</p><p>A few years ago, I had the unfortunate sentence of being in a waiting<br/>room for hours as a loved one had surgery. I was freaking pretty<br/>hard, so I had an FM radio on the local classical station. I missed<br/>the beginning of a broadcast, but heard most of the first and all of<br/>the other three movements of a symphony. In so many ways is seemed<br/>familiar: maybe Brahms, but, no, it has a pastoral quality, early<br/>Elgar? what? An unknown composer, being re-discovered?</p><p>Turned out to be a symphony by late-Victorian British composer Sir<br/>Charles Villiers Stanford, one of 9 (I think) symphonies he wrote, in<br/>addition to much sturdy choral music, evocative English song and<br/>dramatic cycles, and etc. I ended up collecting quite a bit, and<br/>subsequently filling in an unknown hole in my fondness for<br/>English/Scottish/Irish composers, especially of this era. (BTW, he<br/>taught Elgar and many of the later, more well-known British composers<br/>as an instructor at Cambridge).</p><p>So there is stuff out there (I&apos;m not saying Stanford&apos;s stuff is for<br/>you, but I enjoy Symphony No. 5 in D major, as well as &quot;Songs of the<br/>Sea and Fleet&quot;). Don&apos;t stop, and this is only some of the older<br/>stuff -- I don&apos;t dare ask you to try Icebreaker (sort of an<br/>English &quot;Bang On A Can&quot;)!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2001 5:54:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon Szanto wrote:&gt; I don&apos;t dare ask you to try Icebreaker (sort of an&gt; English &quot;Bang On A Can&quot;)!First band I saw live!Graham</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@...</h3><span>6/3/2001 8:58:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;Graham Breed&quot; &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Jon Szanto wrote:&gt; I don&apos;t dare ask you to try Icebreaker (sort of<br/>an&gt; English &quot;Bang On A Can&quot;)!First band I saw live!Graham</p><p>Hay!

He said they are still intact, and still do occasional<br/>projects, though they are almost all in other musical endeavors as<br/>well. Bob also mentioned that they have just recorded a new CD of<br/>music by a Dutch composer (other than Andriessen) that is even more<br/>uncompromising than anything else -- definitely NOT for JdL!!!</p><p>Thanks for sharing about IB, I think they (as players) must be<br/>spectacular live.
