The<br/>milk will also contain a pig protein that could prevent<br/>baby pigs from contracting diarrhea, he said.</p><p>The Taiwanese institute is undertaking a four-year<br/>research project to clone more pigs and produce<br/>clotting and other medicines, he said.</p><p>It also plans to work with foreign scientific research<br/>organizations to advance the cloning technology so that<br/>it can be used to clone pigs whose organs can be<br/>transplanted into human beings without being rejected,<br/>Wong said.</p><p>Pigs are ideal for transplant because they can<br/>reproduce quickly and their organs are of sizes similar<br/>to those of human beings, he said.</p><p>Taiwan&apos;s government has encouraged biotechnology<br/>research and hopes Taiwan will became a leader in the<br/>field just as it did in the electronics industry.</p></div>
