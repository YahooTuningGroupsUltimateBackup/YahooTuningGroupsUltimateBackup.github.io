So the main problem involves preventing the fuel<br/>from leaking from its containers - the fuel itself is generated<br/>from lithium, and as the other part of its fuel, it needs<br/>deuterium, which you can get from sea water:</p><p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/fusion.html#c5">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/fusion.html#c5</a></p><p>The other radioactivity problem involves the casing of the reactor<br/>itself and components that are close to the reaction - they<br/>can become radioactive. But whether they do depends on what<br/>they are made of so that can be controlled by making the<br/>housing of materials that don&apos;t get very radioactive when<br/>they are irradiated, or that only convert into radioactive<br/>materials with short half lives.</p><p>Then, there is no problem with nuclear proliferation as nuclear<br/>fusion technology can&apos;t be used to make plutonium or atomic<br/>bombs. Nor can the fusion reactor explode - it runs in a vacuum<br/>and the problem is to maintain that vacuum and to maintain<br/>the magnetic fields to contain the plasma - which has to<br/>be heated up to many times the temperature at the center<br/>of the sun before it can produce any power. If anything<br/>goes wrong then the plasma simply dissipates<br/>and the reactor stops producing power - there is very little<br/>actual matter in the plasma at any time  - or if the<br/>vacuum gets compromised, again it just stops producing<br/>power. It can&apos;t explode like a nuclear fission reactor<br/>and there are no moderating rods - rather the problem<br/>is to keep it contained enough to fuse at all and if<br/>anything goes wrong it just fizzles out.</p><p>So, no worries about terrorists or accidents.<br/>No greenhouse gases. The main fuel is in plentiful<br/>supply from the sea, and tritium can be generated<br/>from Lithium which isn&apos;t that rare. No long lived<br/>radioactive waste to deal with. Only the problems of<br/>leaking tritium from the fuel tanks, and of<br/>the reactor building itself becoming radioactive<br/>need to be addressed, and with careful work they<br/>can be made small. Tritium, though radioactive<br/>enough to require care, isn&apos;t highly radioactive<br/>in the way that uranium or plutonium are.<br/>It has a very short half life so if some of it escapes<br/>it won&apos;t linger long.</p><p>An interesting possibility is that once large fusion power<br/>stations can be built, it is possible that<br/>the insights could be used to build much<br/>smaller ones later - as confinement may well be easier<br/>if the reactor is smaller, once one has a better<br/>idea of what is needed to achieve it.</p><p>It really looks as though it may not be so many<br/>years away now. There have been many ups and downs.<br/>Originally in the middle of the twentieth century<br/>scientiest were very optimistic and thought it would<br/>only require a few years of research to make nuclear<br/>fission a reality. Then, just maybe ten years ago they<br/>were thinking it looked almost hopeless becaue<br/>it was so difficult to contain the plasma<br/>magnetically at the very high temperatures<br/>needed. The magnetic confinement of the plasmas<br/>kept leaking whatever they tried.<br/>The thing there is that the plasma<br/>is so hot that no ordinary material can contain it,<br/>only a magnetic field - and the charged plasma itself<br/>will distort the field so it is quite a complicated<br/>situation.</p><p>But then there were some breakthroughs<br/>in methods of containing the plasma at the<br/>end of the last century and as a result<br/>it became much more hopeful, I knew that<br/>through reading the popular science journals, but<br/>hadn&apos;t realised how far they had got - now<br/>apparently the next prototype will actually<br/>generate power - practical fusion reactors<br/>can&apos;t be so very far in the future after that.<br/>Looks like it might well be finally developed<br/>and become practical at about the same time that<br/>oil becomes very scarce (with some luck).</p><p>It might be the thing that takes us<br/>from a world depending on fossil fuel<br/>to one using renewables - well fusion power<br/>isn&apos;t quite renewable but about close to it,<br/>and will surely be far better for us<br/>than relying on nuclear fission power.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=8482 href="#8482">ðŸ”—</a>Dante Rosati &#x3C;dante@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/2004 10:35:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Robert-</p><p>amazingly, even cold fusion is being given another look:</p><p><a href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/WEBONLY/resource/sep04/0904nfus.html">http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/WEBONLY/resource/sep04/0904nfus.html</a></p><p>wouldn&apos;t that be something!</p><p>Dante</p></div>
