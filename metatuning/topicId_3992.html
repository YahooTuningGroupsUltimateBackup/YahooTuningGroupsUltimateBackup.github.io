Dow continues to play whack-a-mole with these<br/>sites (at least one ISP has received veiled threats).</p><p>Burson-Marsteller, the public relations company that helped to &quot;spin&quot;<br/>Bhopal, has meanwhile sued college student Paul Hardwin<br/>(phardwin@...) for putting up a fake Burson-Marsteller site,<br/><a href="http://www.bursonmarsteller.com">www.bursonmarsteller.com</a>, which recounted how the PR giant helped to<br/>downplay the Bhopal disaster. Burson-Marsteller&apos;s suit against Hardwin<br/>will be heard next week by the World Intellectual Property Organization<br/>(<a href="http://www.reamweaver.com/bmwipo/wipo.html">www.reamweaver.com/bmwipo/wipo.html</a>).</p><p>Hardwin, unable to afford a lawyer, has composed a dryly humorous 57-page<br/>rebuttal to the PR giant&apos;s lawsuit<br/>(<a href="http://www.reamweaver.com/bmwipo/response.htm">www.reamweaver.com/bmwipo/response.htm</a>). On page 7, for instance, the<br/>student notes that Burson-Marsteller&apos;s &quot;stated goal is &apos;to ensure that the<br/>perceptions which surround our clients and influence their stakeholders<br/>are consistent with reality.&apos;&quot; Hardwin goes on to assert that his<br/>satirical domain is doing precisely that, by publicizing &quot;academic and<br/>journalistic materials about Burson-Marsteller&apos;s involvement with and<br/>relationship to, for example, Philip Morris and the National Smoker&apos;s<br/>Alliance, a consumer front group designed to create the appearance of<br/>public support for big-tobacco policies; Union Carbide and the deaths of<br/>20,000 people following the 1984 disaster in Bhopal; and political regimes<br/>such as that of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and more recently<br/>Saudi Arabia following the events of September 11; and to properly<br/>associate them with the relevant Trademark so that they may be understood<br/>accordingly by Internet users.&quot;</p><p>In response to the suit&apos;s claim that &quot;a substantial degree of goodwill is<br/>associated with [the Burson-Marstellar Trademark]&quot; Hardwin offers much<br/>&quot;evidence to the contrary&quot; including &quot;a newspaper headline in which the<br/>Complainant is characterized as &apos;the Devil.&apos;&quot;</p><p>The primary goal of RTMark (<a href="http://rtmark.com">rtmark.com</a>) is to publicize corporate<br/>subversion of the democratic process. Just like other corporations, it<br/>achieves its aims by any and all means at its disposal. RTMark has<br/>previously helped to publicize websites against political parties<br/>(<a href="http://rtmark.com/othersites.html#fpo">rtmark.com/othersites.html#fpo</a>), political figures<br/>(<a href="http://rtmark.com/bush.html">rtmark.com/bush.html</a>), and entities like the World Trade Organization<br/>(<a href="http://www.gatt.org">www.gatt.org</a>) and the World Economic Forum<br/>(<a href="http://www.world-economic-forum.com">www.world-economic-forum.com</a>).</p></div>
