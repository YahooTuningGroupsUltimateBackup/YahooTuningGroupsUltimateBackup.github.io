In this case, we&apos;ll be seeing a centre-right candidate going<br/>one-on-one with the far right.  Hopefully he&apos;ll stay squeaky clean to make<br/>sure centre-left voters turn out for him, rather than drifting to the<br/>right to reduce Le Pen&apos;s support.</p><p>One thing I thought about researching for a previous thread:  the National<br/>Front have a big group on the local government of Marseilles.  Although<br/>the politicians don&apos;t openly support it, racist attacks always go up when<br/>the far right have a following anywhere.  So it may be significant that it<br/>was the *national* government vowing to protect synagogues in that story.<br/>Of course, newspapers suggesting the local government was turning a blind<br/>eye would be in legal trouble.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3>X.

Racist attacks on synagogues and schoolbuses are<br/>&gt;&gt; taking place in France.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 2. These attacks are a profound embarassment to French<br/>&gt;&gt; citizens.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So voting for a far-right presidential candidate will make<br/>&gt; them less embarrassed?</p><p>The term &apos;far-right&apos; seems like name-calling. It<br/>conjures up images of stormtroopers and goosestepping.<br/>Does not seem to me that this cat is a racial supremist<br/>as is being implied. What&apos;s wrong with being<br/>anti-globilization and Francophilic? A frenchman being<br/>proud of French culture is very different from a<br/>Fascist seeking to eradicate cultures not his own.</p><p>What I am saying is that the racists who have attacked<br/>the synagogues did not vote for Jean-Marie. As if!</p><p>&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>&gt; Many of the attacks are seen as being perpetrated by young<br/>&gt; members of<br/>&gt; France&apos;s five million Muslims, most of whom come from North<br/>&gt; African<br/>&gt; immigrant families that identify with the Palestinian cause.<br/>&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Young members of immigrant families are not usually<br/>themselves<br/>&gt; immigrants.</p><p>Perhaps not. But the fact is that they learned their<br/>racism somewhere; from their parents and friends are<br/>likely sources.</p><p>The synagogue attackers do not respect or have interest<br/>in the culture of their host country that is giving<br/>them a chance. Instead they want to spread<br/>anti-semitism and violent acts. Sending them away or at<br/>least prevented more of them from coming in seems a<br/>reasonable response to the problem. I note that France<br/>does not make itself open to immigration from<br/>jew-hating, hitler-loving white-supremists from<br/>Montana. Why treat jew-hating hilter-loving<br/>islamo-supremists sany differently?</p><p>&gt; Oh, so it&apos;s about cheese!  And when Le Pen said</p><p>&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot; We mustn&apos;t delude ourselves. Europe is already &grave;German.&apos;<br/>&gt; Germany is the geopolitical center of Europe. It is the<br/>&gt; largest country on the continent, demographically and<br/>&gt; economically, and its influence will only grow after the<br/>&gt; Eastern European countries are added to the EU, since they<br/>&gt; are essentially the German hinterland. &quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>I am sympathetic to this statement he made. Europe is<br/>very likely to become the 4th Reich the way it is<br/>headed and Jean-Marie is OPPOSED to that. So am I.<br/>Facism has not been good for Europe in the past.</p><p>&gt; it was because he wanted to keep on eating unpasteurised<br/>&gt; cheese.</p><p>That&apos;s part of it, yes.</p><p>&gt; Immigrants are frequently the victims of racist attacks, but<br/>&gt; opposing immigration is a roundabout way of preventing them.</p><p>I am not aware that there is a pattern in france of<br/>Islamic militant immigrants being the victims of racist<br/>attacks.</p><p>&gt;&gt; 6. Therefore the nationalist party seems to represent<br/>&gt;&gt; the concerns of the people and gains political<br/>&gt;&gt; following.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I sincerely hope the National Front does not represent the<br/>&gt; concerns of the people.</p><p>I agree with the French who are opposed to<br/>globalization &amp; the federalization of Europe. But<br/>that&apos;s their battle and perogative not mine.</p><p>I believe immigration is a good thing in many cases but<br/>can sympathize with those in France who are questioning<br/>whether allowing vast numbers of radical islamists to<br/>come in and tear the country to shreds, attacking<br/>peaceful french jews, burning synagogues to the ground<br/>and so forth. Clearly it is time to start asking what<br/>is wrong with that picture and what can be done to fix<br/>it. Jean-Marie offers an open discussion of the problem<br/>and does not pretend there is not a problem. I can see<br/>that would be appealing to people tired of what they<br/>see as BS and selling out done by the current<br/>government. Whether Jean-Marie would be any different<br/>who knows. There is no chance he will be elected so the<br/>world will never know.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Now whether the nationalist party really work on those<br/>&gt;&gt; things I have no idea. But I see why people support<br/>&gt;&gt; them and racism is not the reason.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you think of a non-racist reason, then?  So far, you seem<br/>&gt; to be<br/>&gt; suggesting it&apos;s because they hate Muslims and Germans.</p><p>Did I mention anything about Germans in my post?<br/>Did I or Jean-Marie say anything about hating people?</p><p>Recognizing that a group of people is causing a lot of<br/>trouble and discussing in public whether anything can<br/>be done to change that is very different from hating<br/>anyone.</p><p>Speaking of REAL hate, the musilm high pope of mecca<br/>guy says jews are monkeys and pigs. The muslims of the<br/>world, forcibly kept ignorant and illiterate by their<br/>wealthy masters, have no reason not to believe the evil<br/>racist diatribes of these satanic leaders. I personallf<br/>think the solution is that Muslims leaders running<br/>hate-cults need to be revealed for what they are. This<br/>is not possible though since the countries and areas in<br/>which they operate do not enjoy free speech.</p><p>I fully agree with the Israeli tactic of isolating the<br/>biggest terrorist leader we&apos;ve seen -- Arafat. And<br/>rounding up the terrorist leaders is a good move. The<br/>Palestinian people have been deceived and manipulated<br/>by these power-mongering psychopaths long enough.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3>jdstarrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2002 3:32:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In metatuning@y..., &quot;X.
