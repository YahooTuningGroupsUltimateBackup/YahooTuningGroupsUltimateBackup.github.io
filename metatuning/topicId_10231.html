Once your signature -- which can last anywhere from one<br/>second to a couple of minutes -- has been generated, you can listen to<br/>it and share it with friends.</p><p>iTunes Signature Maker was commissioned by Rhizome<br/>(<a href="http://rhizome.org">http://rhizome.org</a>). The Rhizome Commissions Program is made possible<br/>by support from the Jerome Foundation in celebration of the Jerome Hill<br/>Centennial, the Greenwall Foundation, the Andy Warhol Foundation for<br/>the Visual Arts, and the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs.<br/>Additional support has been provided by members of the Rhizome<br/>community.</p><p>I&apos;d appreciate it if you could pass this information along to anyone<br/>who might enjoy iTunes Signature Maker.</p><p>--Jason</p><p>--</p></div><h3>Dante Rosati &#x3C;dante@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/2005 9:38:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="http://www.ilikejam.dsl.pipex.com/audiophile.htm">http://www.ilikejam.dsl.pipex.com/audiophile.htm</a></p></div>
