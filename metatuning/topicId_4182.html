He published his<br/>&gt;&gt;  first novel, Player Piano, in 1952 at the age of 29.<br/>&gt;&gt;  Since then he has written 13 others, including<br/>&gt;&gt;  Slaughterhouse Five, which stands as one of the<br/>&gt;&gt;  pre-eminent anti-war novels of the 20th century.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  As war against Iraq looms, I asked Vonnegut, a reader<br/>&gt;&gt;  and supporter of this magazine, to weigh in. Vonnegut<br/>&gt;&gt;  is an American socialist in the tradition of Eugene<br/>&gt;&gt;  Victor Debs, a fellow Hoosier whom he likes to quote:<br/>&gt;&gt;  &quot;As long as there is a lower class, I am in it. As long<br/>&gt;&gt;  as there is a criminal element, I am of it. As long as<br/>&gt;&gt;  there is a soul in prison, I am not free.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;                                  --Joel Bleifuss<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  Q: You have lived through World War II, Korea, Vietnam,<br/>&gt;&gt;  the Reagan wars, Desert Storm, the Balkan wars and now<br/>&gt;&gt;  this coming war in Iraq. What has changed, and what has<br/>&gt;&gt;  remained the same?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  One thing which has not changed is that none of us, no<br/>&gt;&gt;  matter what continent or island or ice cap, asked to be<br/>&gt;&gt;  born in the first place, and that even somebody as old<br/>&gt;&gt;  as I am, which is 80, only just got here. There were<br/>&gt;&gt;  already all these games going on when I got here. ...<br/>&gt;&gt;  An apt motto for any polity anywhere, to put on its<br/>&gt;&gt;  state seal or currency or whatever, might be this<br/>&gt;&gt;  quotation from the late baseball manager Casey Stengel,<br/>&gt;&gt;  who was addressing a team of losing professional<br/>&gt;&gt;  athletes: &quot;Can&apos;t anybody here play this game?&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  My daughter Lily, for an example close to home, who has<br/>&gt;&gt;  just turned 20, finds herself--as does George W. Bush,<br/>&gt;&gt;  himself a kid--an heir to a shockingly recent history<br/>&gt;&gt;  of human slavery, to an AIDS epidemic and to nuclear<br/>&gt;&gt;  submarines slumbering on the floors of fjords in<br/>&gt;&gt;  Iceland and elsewhere, crews prepared at a moment&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;  notice to turn industrial quantities of men, women and<br/>&gt;&gt;  children into radioactive soot and bone meal by means<br/>&gt;&gt;  of rockets and H-bomb warheads. And to the choice<br/>&gt;&gt;  between liberalism or conservatism and on and on.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  What is radically new in 2003 is that my daughter,<br/>&gt;&gt;  along with our president and Saddam Hussein and on and<br/>&gt;&gt;  on, has inherited technologies whose byproducts,<br/>&gt;&gt;  whether in war or peace, are rapidly destroying the<br/>&gt;&gt;  whole planet as a breathable, drinkable system for<br/>&gt;&gt;  supporting life of any kind. Human beings, past and<br/>&gt;&gt;  present, have trashed the joint.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  Q: Based on what you&apos;ve read and seen in the media, what<br/>&gt;&gt;  is not being said in the mainstream press about<br/>&gt;&gt;  President Bush&apos;s policies and the impending war in Iraq?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  That they are nonsense.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  Q: My feeling from talking to readers and friends is that<br/>&gt;&gt;  many people are beginning to despair. Do you think that<br/>&gt;&gt;  we&apos;ve lost reason to hope?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  I myself feel that our country, for whose Constitution<br/>&gt;&gt;  I fought in a just war, might as well have been invaded<br/>&gt;&gt;  by Martians and body snatchers. Sometimes I wish it had<br/>&gt;&gt;  been. What has happened, though, is that it has been<br/>&gt;&gt;  taken over by means of the sleaziest, low-comedy,<br/>&gt;&gt;  Keystone Cops-style coup d&apos;etat imaginable. And those<br/>&gt;&gt;  now in charge of the federal government are upper-crust<br/>&gt;&gt;  C-students who know no history or geography, plus<br/>&gt;&gt;  not-so-closeted white supremacists, aka &quot;Christians,&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;  and plus, most frighteningly, psychopathic<br/>&gt;&gt;  personalities, or &quot;PPs.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  To say somebody is a PP is to make a perfectly<br/>&gt;&gt;  respectable medical diagnosis, like saying he or she<br/>&gt;&gt;  has appendicitis or athlete&apos;s foot. The classic medical<br/>&gt;&gt;  text on PPs is The Mask of Sanity by Dr. Hervey<br/>&gt;&gt;  Cleckley. Read it! PPs are presentable, they know full<br/>&gt;&gt;  well the suffering their actions may cause others, but<br/>&gt;&gt;  they do not care. They cannot care because they are<br/>&gt;&gt;  nuts. They have a screw loose!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  And what syndrome better describes so many executives<br/>&gt;&gt;  at Enron and WorldCom and on and on, who have enriched<br/>&gt;&gt;  themselves while ruining their employees and investors<br/>&gt;&gt;  and country, and who still feel as pure as the driven<br/>&gt;&gt;  snow, no matter what anybody may say to or about them?<br/>&gt;&gt;  And so many of these heartless PPs now hold big jobs in<br/>&gt;&gt;  our federal government, as though they were leaders<br/>&gt;&gt;  instead of sick.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  What has allowed so many PPs to rise so high in<br/>&gt;&gt;  corporations, and now in government, is that they are<br/>&gt;&gt;  so decisive. Unlike normal people, they are never<br/>&gt;&gt;  filled with doubts, for the simple reason that they<br/>&gt;&gt;  cannot care what happens next. Simply can&apos;t. Do this!<br/>&gt;&gt;  Do that! Mobilize the reserves! Privatize the public<br/>&gt;&gt;  schools! Attack Iraq! Cut health care! Tap everybody&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;  telephone! Cut taxes on the rich! Build a<br/>&gt;&gt;  trillion-dollar missile shield! Fuck habeas corpus and<br/>&gt;&gt;  the Sierra Club and In These Times, and kiss my ass!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  Q: How have you gotten involved in the anti-war movement?<br/>&gt;&gt;  And how would you compare the movement against a war in<br/>&gt;&gt;  Iraq with the anti-war movement of the Vietnam era?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  When it became obvious what a dumb and cruel and<br/>&gt;&gt;  spiritually and financially and militarily ruinous<br/>&gt;&gt;  mistake our war in Vietnam was, every artist worth a<br/>&gt;&gt;  damn in this country, every serious writer, painter,<br/>&gt;&gt;  stand-up comedian, musician, actor and actress, you<br/>&gt;&gt;  name it, came out against the thing. We formed what<br/>&gt;&gt;  might be described as a laser beam of protest, with<br/>&gt;&gt;  everybody aimed in the same direction, focused and<br/>&gt;&gt;  intense. This weapon proved to have the power of a<br/>&gt;&gt;  banana-cream pie three feet in diameter when dropped<br/>&gt;&gt;  from a stepladder five-feet high.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  And so it is with anti-war protests in the present day.<br/>&gt;&gt;  Then as now, TV did not like anti-war protesters, nor<br/>&gt;&gt;  any other sort of protesters, unless they rioted. Now,<br/>&gt;&gt;  as then, on account of TV, the right of citizens to<br/>&gt;&gt;  peaceably assemble, and petition their government for a<br/>&gt;&gt;  redress of grievances, &quot;ain&apos;t worth a pitcher of warm<br/>&gt;&gt;  spit,&quot; as the saying goes.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  Q: As a writer and artist, have you noticed any difference<br/>&gt;&gt;  between how the cultural leaders of the past and the<br/>&gt;&gt;  cultural leaders of today view their responsibility to<br/>&gt;&gt;  society?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  Responsibility to which society? To Nazi Germany? To<br/>&gt;&gt;  the Stalinist Soviet Union? What about responsibility<br/>&gt;&gt;  to humanity in general? And leaders in what particular<br/>&gt;&gt;  cultural activity? I guess you mean the fine arts. I<br/>&gt;&gt;  hope you mean the fine arts. ... Anybody practicing the<br/>&gt;&gt;  fine art of composing music, no matter how cynical or<br/>&gt;&gt;  greedy or scared, still can&apos;t help serving all<br/>&gt;&gt;  humanity. Music makes practically everybody fonder of<br/>&gt;&gt;  life than he or she would be without it. Even military<br/>&gt;&gt;  bands, although I am a pacifist, always cheer me up.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  But that is the power of ear candy. The creation of<br/>&gt;&gt;  such a universal confection for the eye, by means of<br/>&gt;&gt;  printed poetry or fiction or history or essays or<br/>&gt;&gt;  memoirs and so on, isn&apos;t possible. Literature is by<br/>&gt;&gt;  definition opinionated. It is bound to provoke the<br/>&gt;&gt;  arguments in many quarters, not excluding the hometown<br/>&gt;&gt;  or even the family of the author. Any ink-on-paper<br/>&gt;&gt;  author can only hope at best to seem responsible to<br/>&gt;&gt;  small groups or like-minded people somewhere. He or she<br/>&gt;&gt;  might as well have given an interview to the editor of a<br/>&gt;&gt;  small-circulation publication.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  Maybe we can talk about the responsibilities to their<br/>&gt;&gt;  societies of architects and sculptors and painters<br/>&gt;&gt;  another time. And I will say this: TV drama, although<br/>&gt;&gt;  not yet classified as fine art, has on occasion<br/>&gt;&gt;  performed marvelous services for Americans who want us<br/>&gt;&gt;  to be less paranoid, to be fairer and more merciful.<br/>&gt;&gt;  M.A.S.H. and Law and Order, to name only two shows,<br/>&gt;&gt;  have been stunning masterpieces in that regard.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  Q: That said, do you have any ideas for a really scary<br/>&gt;&gt;  reality TV show?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  &quot;C students from Yale.&quot; It would stand your hair on end.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  Q: What targets would you consider fair game for a<br/>&gt;&gt;  satirist today?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  Assholes.<br/>&gt;&gt;  ___________________________<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
