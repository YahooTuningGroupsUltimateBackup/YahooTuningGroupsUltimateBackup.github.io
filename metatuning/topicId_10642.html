So what does primatology have to say about war and peace?<br/>&gt;    Contrary to what was believed just a few decades ago, humans are not<br/>&gt;    &quot;killer apes&quot; destined for violent conflict, but can make their own<br/>&gt;    history.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Robert M. Sapolsky is John A. and Cynthia Fry Gunn Professor of<br/>&gt;    Biological Sciences and Professor of Neurology and Neurological<br/>&gt;    Sciences at Stanford University. His most recent book is &quot;Monkeyluv:<br/>&gt;    And Other Essays on Our Lives as Animals.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    THE NAKED APE<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    The evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky once said, &quot;All<br/>&gt;    species are unique, but humans are uniquest.&quot; Humans have long taken<br/>&gt;    pride in their specialness. But the study of other primates is<br/>&gt;    rendering the concept of such human exceptionalism increasingly<br/>&gt;    suspect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Some of the retrenchment has been relatively palatable, such as with<br/>&gt;    the workings of our bodies. Thus we now know that a baboon heart can<br/>&gt;    be transplanted into a human body and work for a few weeks, and human<br/>&gt;    blood types are coded in Rh factors named after the rhesus monkeys<br/>&gt;    that possess similar blood variability.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    More discomfiting is the continuum that has been demonstrated in the<br/>&gt;    realm of cognition. We now know, for example, that other species<br/>&gt;    invent tools and use them with dexterity and local cultural variation.<br/>&gt;    Other primates display &quot;semanticity&quot; (the use of symbols to refer to<br/>&gt;    objects and actions) in their communication in ways that would impress<br/>&gt;    any linguist. And experiments have shown other primates to possess a<br/>&gt;    &quot;theory of mind,&quot; that is, the ability to recognize that different<br/>&gt;    individuals can have different thoughts and knowledge.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Our purported uniqueness has been challenged most, however, with<br/>&gt;    regard to our social life. Like the occasional human hermit, there are<br/>&gt;    a few primates that are typically asocial (such as the orangutan).<br/>&gt;    Apart from those, however, it turns out that one cannot understand a<br/>&gt;    primate in isolation from its social group. Across the 150 or so<br/>&gt;    species of primates, the larger the average social group, the larger<br/>&gt;    the cortex relative to the rest of the brain. The fanciest part of the<br/>&gt;    primate brain, in other words, seems to have been sculpted by<br/>&gt;    evolution to enable us to gossip and groom, cooperate and cheat, and<br/>&gt;    obsess about who is mating with whom. Humans, in short, are yet<br/>&gt;    another primate with an intense and rich social life -- a fact that<br/>&gt;    raises the question of whether primatology can teach us something<br/>&gt;    about a rather important part of human sociality, war and peace.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    It used to be thought that humans were the only savagely violent<br/>&gt;    primate. &quot;We are the only species that kills its own,&quot; one might have<br/>&gt;    heard intoned portentously at the end of nature films several decades<br/>&gt;    ago. That view fell by the wayside in the 1960s as it became clear<br/>&gt;    that some other primates kill their fellows aplenty. Males kill;<br/>&gt;    females kill. Some kill one another&apos;s infants with cold-blooded<br/>&gt;    stratagems worthy of Richard III. Some use their toolmaking skills to<br/>&gt;    fashion bigger and better cudgels. Some other primates even engage in<br/>&gt;    what can only be called warfare -- organized, proactive group violence<br/>&gt;    directed at other populations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    As field studies of primates expanded, what became most striking was<br/>&gt;    the variation in social practices across species. Yes, some primate<br/>&gt;    species have lives filled with violence, frequent and varied. But life<br/>&gt;    among others is filled with communitarianism, egalitarianism, and<br/>&gt;    cooperative child rearing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Patterns emerged. In less aggressive species, such as gibbons or<br/>&gt;    marmosets, groups tend to live in lush rain forests where food is<br/>&gt;    plentiful and life is easy. Females and males tend to be the same<br/>&gt;    size, and the males lack secondary sexual markers such as long, sharp<br/>&gt;    canines or garish coloring. Couples mate for life, and males help<br/>&gt;    substantially with child care. In violent species, on the other hand,<br/>&gt;    such as baboons and rhesus monkeys, the opposite conditions prevail.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    The most disquieting fact about the violent species was the apparent<br/>&gt;    inevitability of their behavior. Certain species seemed simply to be<br/>&gt;    the way they were, fixed products of the interplay of evolution and<br/>&gt;    ecology, and that was that. And although human males might not be<br/>&gt;    inflexibly polygamous or come with bright red butts and six-inch<br/>&gt;    canines designed for tooth-to-tooth combat, it was clear that our<br/>&gt;    species had at least as much in common with the violent primates as<br/>&gt;    with the gentle ones. &quot;In their nature&quot; thus became &quot;in our nature.&quot;<br/>&gt;    This was the humans-as-killer-apes theory popularized by the writer<br/>&gt;    Robert Ardrey, according to which humans have as much chance of<br/>&gt;    becoming intrinsically peaceful as they have of growing prehensile<br/>&gt;    tails.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    That view always had little more scientific rigor than a Planet of the<br/>&gt;    Apes movie, but it took a great deal of field research to figure out<br/>&gt;    just what should supplant it. After decades&apos; more work, the picture<br/>&gt;    has become quite interesting. Some primate species, it turns out, are<br/>&gt;    indeed simply violent or peaceful, with their behavior driven by their<br/>&gt;    social structures and ecological settings. More important, however,<br/>&gt;    some primate species can make peace despite violent traits that seem<br/>&gt;    built into their natures. The challenge now is to figure out under<br/>&gt;    what conditions that can happen, and whether humans can manage the<br/>&gt;    trick themselves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    PAX BONOBO<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Primatology has long been dominated by studies of the chimpanzee, due<br/>&gt;    in large part to the phenomenally influential research of Jane<br/>&gt;    Goodall, whose findings from her decades of observations in the wild<br/>&gt;    have been widely disseminated. National Geographic specials based on<br/>&gt;    Goodall&apos;s work would always include the reminder that chimps are our<br/>&gt;    closest relatives, a notion underlined by the fact that we share an<br/>&gt;    astonishing 98 percent of our DNA with them. And Goodall and other<br/>&gt;    chimp researchers have carefully documented an endless stream of<br/>&gt;    murders, cannibalism, and organized group violence among their<br/>&gt;    subjects. Humans&apos; evolutionary fate thus seemed sealed, smeared by the<br/>&gt;    excesses of these first cousins.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    But all along there has been another chimp species, one traditionally<br/>&gt;    ignored because of its small numbers; its habitat in remote,<br/>&gt;    impenetrable rain forests; and the fact that its early chroniclers<br/>&gt;    published in Japanese. These skinny little creatures were originally<br/>&gt;    called &quot;pygmy chimps&quot; and were thought of as uninteresting, some sort<br/>&gt;    of regressed subspecies of the real thing. Now known as bonobos, they<br/>&gt;    are today recognized as a separate and distinct species that<br/>&gt;    taxonomically and genetically is just as closely related to humans as<br/>&gt;    the standard chimp. And boy, is this ever a different ape.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Male bonobos are not particularly aggressive and lack the massive<br/>&gt;    musculature typical of species that engage in a lot of fighting (such<br/>&gt;    as the standard chimp). Moreover, the bonobo social system is female<br/>&gt;    dominated, food is often shared, and there are well-developed means<br/>&gt;    for reconciling social tensions. And then there is the sex.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Bonobo sex is the prurient highlight of primatology conferences, and<br/>&gt;    leads parents to shield their children&apos;s eyes when watching nature<br/>&gt;    films. Bonobos have sex in every conceivable position and some<br/>&gt;    seemingly inconceivable ones, in pairs and groups, between genders and<br/>&gt;    within genders, to greet each other and to resolve conflicts, to work<br/>&gt;    off steam after a predator scare, to celebrate finding food or to<br/>&gt;    cajole its sharing, or just because. As the sound bite has it, chimps<br/>&gt;    are from Mars and bonobos are from Venus.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    All is not perfect in the bonobo commune, and they still have<br/>&gt;    hierarchies and conflict (why else invent conflict resolution?).<br/>&gt;    Nonetheless, they are currently among the trendiest of species to<br/>&gt;    analyze, a wonderful antidote to their hard-boiled relatives. The<br/>&gt;    trouble is, while we have a pretty good sense of what bonobos are<br/>&gt;    like, we have little insight into how they got that way. Furthermore,<br/>&gt;    this is basically what all bonobos seem to be like -- a classic case<br/>&gt;    of in-their-nature-ness. There is even recent evidence for a genetic<br/>&gt;    component to the phenomenon, in that bonobos (but not chimps) possess<br/>&gt;    a version of a gene that makes affiliative behavior (behavior that<br/>&gt;    promotes group cohesion) more pleasurable to males. So -- a wondrous<br/>&gt;    species (and one, predictably, teetering on the edge of extinction).<br/>&gt;    But besides being useful for taking the wind out of we-be-chimps<br/>&gt;    fatalists, the bonobo has little to say to us. We are not bonobos, and<br/>&gt;    never can be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    WARRIORS, COME OUT TO PLAY<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    In contrast to the social life of bonobos, the social life of chimps<br/>&gt;    is not pretty. Nor is that of rhesus monkeys, nor savanna baboons -- a<br/>&gt;    species found in groups of 50 to 100 in the African grasslands and one<br/>&gt;    I have studied for close to 30 years. Hierarchies among baboons are<br/>&gt;    strict, as are their consequences. Among males, high rank is typically<br/>&gt;    achieved by a series of successful violent challenges. Spoils, such as<br/>&gt;    meat, are unevenly divided. Most males die of the consequences of<br/>&gt;    violence, and roughly half of their aggression is directed at third<br/>&gt;    parties (some high-ranking male in a bad mood takes it out on an<br/>&gt;    innocent bystander, such as a female or a subordinate male).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Male baboons, moreover, can fight amazingly dirty. I saw this happen a<br/>&gt;    few years ago in one of the troops I study: Two males had fought, and<br/>&gt;    one, having been badly trounced, assumed a crouching stance, with his<br/>&gt;    rear end up in the air. This is universally recognized among savanna<br/>&gt;    baboons as an abject gesture of subordination, signaling an end to the<br/>&gt;    conflict, and the conventional response on the part of the victorious<br/>&gt;    male is to subject the other to a ritualized gesture of dominance<br/>&gt;    (such as mounting him). In this instance, however, the winner,<br/>&gt;    approaching the loser as if to mount him, instead abruptly gave him a<br/>&gt;    deep slash with his canines.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    A baboon group, in short, is an unlikely breeding ground for<br/>&gt;    pacifists. Nevertheless, there are some interesting exceptions. In<br/>&gt;    recent years, for example, it has been recognized that a certain<br/>&gt;    traditional style of chest-thumping evolutionary thinking is wrong.<br/>&gt;    According to the standard logic, males compete with one another<br/>&gt;    aggressively in order to achieve and maintain a high rank, which will<br/>&gt;    in turn enable them to dominate reproduction and thus maximize the<br/>&gt;    number of copies of their genes that are passed on to the next<br/>&gt;    generation. But although aggression among baboons does indeed have<br/>&gt;    something to do with attaining a high rank, it turns out to have<br/>&gt;    virtually nothing to do with maintaining it. Dominant males rarely are<br/>&gt;    particularly aggressive, and those that are typically are on their way<br/>&gt;    out: the ones that need to use it are often about to lose it. Instead,<br/>&gt;    maintaining dominance requires social intelligence and impulse control<br/>&gt;    -- the ability to form prudent coalitions, show some tolerance of<br/>&gt;    subordinates, and ignore most provocations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Recent work, moreover, has demonstrated that females have something to<br/>&gt;    say about which males get to pass on their genes. The traditional view<br/>&gt;    was based on a &quot;linear access&quot; model of reproduction: if one female is<br/>&gt;    in heat, the alpha male gets to mate with her; if two are in heat, the<br/>&gt;    alpha male and the second-ranking male get their opportunity; and so<br/>&gt;    on. Yet we now know that female baboons are pretty good at getting<br/>&gt;    away from even champions of male-male competition if they want to and<br/>&gt;    can sneak off instead with another male they actually desire. And who<br/>&gt;    would that be? Typically, it is a male that has followed a different<br/>&gt;    strategy of building affiliative relations with the female -- grooming<br/>&gt;    her a lot, helping to take care of her kids, not beating her up. These<br/>&gt;    nice-guy males seem to pass on at least as many copies of their genes<br/>&gt;    as their more aggressive peers, not least because they can go like<br/>&gt;    this for years, without the life-shortening burnout and injuries of<br/>&gt;    the gladiators.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    And so the crude picture of combat as the sole path to evolutionary<br/>&gt;    success is wrong. The average male baboon does opt for the combative<br/>&gt;    route, but there are important phases of his life when aggression is<br/>&gt;    less important than social intelligence and restraint, and there are<br/>&gt;    evolutionarily fruitful alternative courses of action.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Even within the bare-knuckle world of male-male aggression, we are now<br/>&gt;    recognizing some surprising outposts of primate civility. For one<br/>&gt;    thing, primates can make up after a fight. Such reconciliation was<br/>&gt;    first described by Frans de Waal, of Emory University, in the early<br/>&gt;    1980s; it has now been observed in some 27 different species of<br/>&gt;    primates, including male chimps, and it works as it is supposed to,<br/>&gt;    reducing the odds of further aggression between the two ex-combatants.<br/>&gt;    And various primates, including male baboons, will sometimes<br/>&gt;    cooperate, for example by supporting one another in a fight.<br/>&gt;    Coalitions can involve reciprocity and even induce what appears to be<br/>&gt;    a sense of justice or fairness. In a remarkable study by de Waal and<br/>&gt;    one of his students, capuchin monkeys were housed in adjacent cages. A<br/>&gt;    monkey could obtain food on its own (by pulling a tray of food toward<br/>&gt;    its cage) or with help from a neighbor (by pulling a heavier tray<br/>&gt;    together); in the latter case, only one of the monkeys was given<br/>&gt;    access to the food in question. The monkeys that collaborated proved<br/>&gt;    more likely to share it with their neighbor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Even more striking are lifelong patterns of cooperation among some<br/>&gt;    male chimps, such as those that form bands of brothers. Among certain<br/>&gt;    primate species, all the members of one gender will leave their home<br/>&gt;    troop around puberty, thus avoiding the possibility of genetically<br/>&gt;    deleterious inbreeding. Among chimps, the females leave home, and as a<br/>&gt;    result, male chimps typically spend their lives in the company of<br/>&gt;    close male relatives. Animal behaviorists steeped in game theory spend<br/>&gt;    careers trying to figure out how reciprocal cooperation gets started<br/>&gt;    among nonrelatives, but it is clear that stable reciprocity among<br/>&gt;    relatives emerges readily.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Thus, even the violent primates engage in reconciliation and<br/>&gt;    cooperation -- but only up to a point. For starters, as noted in<br/>&gt;    regard to the bonobo, there would be nothing to reconcile without<br/>&gt;    violence and conflict in the first place. Furthermore, reconciliation<br/>&gt;    is not universal: female savanna baboons are good at it, for example,<br/>&gt;    but males are not. Most important, even among species and genders that<br/>&gt;    do reconcile, it is not an indiscriminate phenomenon: individuals are<br/>&gt;    more likely to reconcile with those who can be useful to them. This<br/>&gt;    was demonstrated in a brilliant study by Marina Cords, of Columbia<br/>&gt;    University, in which the value of some relationships among a type of<br/>&gt;    macaque monkey was artificially raised. Animals were again caged next<br/>&gt;    to each other under conditions in which they could obtain food by<br/>&gt;    themselves or through cooperation, and those pairs that developed the<br/>&gt;    capacity for cooperation were three times as likely to reconcile after<br/>&gt;    induced aggression as noncooperators. Tension-reducing reconciliation,<br/>&gt;    in other words, is most likely to occur among animals who already are<br/>&gt;    in the habit of cooperating and have an incentive to keep doing so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Some deflating points emerge from the studies of cooperation as well,<br/>&gt;    such as the fact that coalitions are notoriously unstable. In one<br/>&gt;    troop of baboons I studied in the early 1980s, male-male coalitions<br/>&gt;    lasted less than two days on average before collapsing, and most cases<br/>&gt;    of such collapse involved one partner failing to reciprocate or, even<br/>&gt;    more dramatically, defecting to the other side during a fight.<br/>&gt;    finally, and most discouraging, is the use to which most coalitions<br/>&gt;    are put. In theory, cooperation could trump individualism in order to,<br/>&gt;    say, improve food gathering or defend against predators. In practice,<br/>&gt;    two baboons that cooperate typically do so in order to make a third<br/>&gt;    miserable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Goodall was the first to report the profoundly disquieting fact that<br/>&gt;    bands of related male chimps carry out cooperative &quot;border patrols&quot; --<br/>&gt;    searching along the geographic boundary separating their group from<br/>&gt;    another and attacking neighboring males they encounter, even to the<br/>&gt;    point of killing other groups off entirely. In-group cooperation can<br/>&gt;    thus usher in not peace and tranquility, but rather more efficient<br/>&gt;    extermination.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    So primate species with some of the most aggressive and stratified<br/>&gt;    social systems have been seen to cooperate and resolve conflicts --<br/>&gt;    but not consistently, not necessarily for benign purposes, and not in<br/>&gt;    a cumulative way that could lead to some fundamentally non-Hobbesian<br/>&gt;    social outcomes. The lesson appears to be not that violent primates<br/>&gt;    can transcend their natures, but merely that the natures of these<br/>&gt;    species are subtler and more multifaceted than previously thought. At<br/>&gt;    least that was the lesson until quite recently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    OLD PRIMATES AND NEW TRICKS<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    To some extent, the age-old &quot;nature versus nurture&quot; debate is silly.<br/>&gt;    The action of genes is completely intertwined with the environment in<br/>&gt;    which they function; in a sense, it is pointless to even discuss what<br/>&gt;    gene X does, and we should consider instead only what gene X does in<br/>&gt;    environment Y. Nonetheless, if one had to predict the behavior of some<br/>&gt;    organism on the basis of only one fact, one might still want to know<br/>&gt;    whether the most useful fact would be about genetics or about the<br/>&gt;    environment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    The first two studies to show that primates were somewhat independent<br/>&gt;    from their &quot;natures&quot; involved a classic technique in behavioral<br/>&gt;    genetics called cross-fostering. Suppose some animal has engaged in a<br/>&gt;    particular behavior for generations -- call it behavior A. We want to<br/>&gt;    know if that behavior is due to shared genes or to a<br/>&gt;    multigenerationally shared environment. Researchers try to answer the<br/>&gt;    question by cross-fostering the animal, that is, switching the<br/>&gt;    animal&apos;s mother at birth so that she is raised by one with behavior B,<br/>&gt;    and then watching to see which behavior the animal displays when she<br/>&gt;    grows up. One problem with this approach is that an animal&apos;s<br/>&gt;    environment does not begin at birth -- a fetus shares a very intimate<br/>&gt;    environment with its mother, namely the body&apos;s circulation, chock-full<br/>&gt;    of hormones and nutrients that can cause lifelong changes in brain<br/>&gt;    function and behavior. Therefore, the approach can be applied only<br/>&gt;    asymmetrically: if a behavior persists in a new environment, one<br/>&gt;    cannot conclude that genes are the cause, but if a behavior changes in<br/>&gt;    a new environment, then one can conclude that genes are not the cause.<br/>&gt;    This is where the two studies come in.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    In the early 1970s, a highly respected primatologist named Hans Kummer<br/>&gt;    was working in Ethiopia, in a region containing two species of baboons<br/>&gt;    with markedly different social systems. Savanna baboons live in large<br/>&gt;    troops, with plenty of adult females and males. Hamadryas baboons, in<br/>&gt;    contrast, have a more complex, multilevel society. Because they live<br/>&gt;    in a much harsher, drier region, hamadryas have a distinctive<br/>&gt;    ecological problem. Some resources are singular and scarce -- like a<br/>&gt;    rare watering hole or a good cliff face to sleep on at night in order<br/>&gt;    to evade predators -- and large numbers of animals are likely to want<br/>&gt;    to share them. Other resources, such as the vegetation they eat, are<br/>&gt;    sparse and widely dispersed, requiring animals to function in small,<br/>&gt;    separate groups. As a result, hamadryas have evolved a &quot;harem&quot;<br/>&gt;    structure -- a single adult male surrounded by a handful of adult<br/>&gt;    females and their children -- with large numbers of discrete harems<br/>&gt;    converging, peacefully, for short periods at the occasional desirable<br/>&gt;    watering hole or cliff face.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Kummer conducted a simple experiment, trapping an adult female savanna<br/>&gt;    baboon and releasing her into a hamadryas troop and trapping an adult<br/>&gt;    female hamadryas and releasing her into a savanna troop. Among<br/>&gt;    hamadryas, if a male threatens a female, it is almost certainly this<br/>&gt;    brute who dominates the harem, and the only way for the female to<br/>&gt;    avoid injury is to approach him -- i.e., return to the fold. But among<br/>&gt;    savanna baboons, if a male threatens a female, the way for her to<br/>&gt;    avoid injury is to run away. In Kummer&apos;s experiment, the females who<br/>&gt;    were dropped in among a different species initially carried out their<br/>&gt;    species-typical behavior, a major faux pas in the new neighborhood.<br/>&gt;    But gradually, they assimilated the new rules. How long did this<br/>&gt;    learning take? About an hour. In other words, millennia of genetic<br/>&gt;    differences separating the two species, a lifetime of experience with<br/>&gt;    a crucial social rule for each female, and a miniscule amount of time<br/>&gt;    to reverse course completely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    The second experiment was set up by de Waal and his student Denise<br/>&gt;    Johanowicz in the early 1990s, working with two macaque monkey<br/>&gt;    species. By any human standards, male rhesus macaques are unappealing<br/>&gt;    animals. Their hierarchies are rigid, those at the top seize a<br/>&gt;    disproportionate share of the spoils, they enforce this inequity with<br/>&gt;    ferocious aggression, and they rarely reconcile after fights. Male<br/>&gt;    stump tail macaques, in contrast, which share almost all of their<br/>&gt;    genes with their rhesus macaque cousins, display much less aggression,<br/>&gt;    more affiliative behaviors, looser hierarchies, and more<br/>&gt;    egalitarianism.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Working with captive primates, de Waal and Johanowicz created a<br/>&gt;    mixed-sex social group of juvenile macaques, combining rhesus and<br/>&gt;    stump tails together. Remarkably, instead of the rhesus macaques<br/>&gt;    bullying the stump tails, over the course of a few months, the rhesus<br/>&gt;    males adopted the stump tails&apos; social style, eventually even matching<br/>&gt;    the stump tails&apos; high rates of reconciliatory behavior. It so happens,<br/>&gt;    moreover, that stump tails and rhesus macaques use different gestures<br/>&gt;    when reconciling. The rhesus macaques in the study did not start using<br/>&gt;    the stump tails&apos; reconciliatory gestures, but rather increased the<br/>&gt;    incidence of their own species-typical gestures. In other words, they<br/>&gt;    were not merely imitating the stump tails&apos; behavior; they were<br/>&gt;    incorporating the concept of frequent reconciliation into their own<br/>&gt;    social practices. When the newly warm-and-fuzzy rhesus macaques were<br/>&gt;    returned to a larger, all-rhesus group, finally, their new behavioral<br/>&gt;    style persisted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    This is nothing short of extraordinary. But it brings up one last<br/>&gt;    question: When those rhesus macaques were transferred back into the<br/>&gt;    all-rhesus world, did they spread their insights and behaviors to the<br/>&gt;    others? Alas, they did not. For that, we need to move on to our final<br/>&gt;    case.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    LEFT BEHIND<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    In the early 1980s, &quot;Forest Troop,&quot; a group of savanna baboons I had<br/>&gt;    been studying -- virtually living with -- for years, was going about<br/>&gt;    its business in a national park in Kenya when a neighboring baboon<br/>&gt;    group had a stroke of luck: its territory encompassed a tourist lodge<br/>&gt;    that expanded its operations and consequently the amount of food<br/>&gt;    tossed into its garbage dump. Baboons are omnivorous, and &quot;Garbage<br/>&gt;    Dump Troop&quot; was delighted to feast on leftover drumsticks, half-eaten<br/>&gt;    hamburgers, remnants of chocolate cake, and anything else that wound<br/>&gt;    up there. Soon they had shifted to sleeping in the trees immediately<br/>&gt;    above the pit, descending each morning just in time for the day&apos;s<br/>&gt;    dumping of garbage. (They soon got quite obese from the rich diet and<br/>&gt;    lack of exercise, but that is another story.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    The development produced nearly as dramatic a shift in the social<br/>&gt;    behavior of Forest Troop. Each morning, approximately half of its<br/>&gt;    adult males would infiltrate Garbage Dump Troop&apos;s territory,<br/>&gt;    descending on the pit in time for the day&apos;s dumping and battling the<br/>&gt;    resident males for access to the garbage. The Forest Troop males that<br/>&gt;    did this shared two traits: they were particularly combative (which<br/>&gt;    was necessary to get the food away from the other baboons), and they<br/>&gt;    were not very interested in socializing (the raids took place early in<br/>&gt;    the morning, during the hours when the bulk of a savanna baboon&apos;s<br/>&gt;    daily communal grooming occurs).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Soon afterward, tuberculosis, a disease that moves with devastating<br/>&gt;    speed and severity in nonhuman primates, broke out in Garbage Dump<br/>&gt;    Troop. Over the next year, most of its members died, as did all of the<br/>&gt;    males from Forest Troop who had foraged at the dump.[See Footnote #1]<br/>&gt;    The results were that Forest Troop was left with males who were less<br/>&gt;    aggressive and more social than average and the troop now had double<br/>&gt;    its previous female-to-male ratio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    The social consequences of these changes were dramatic. There remained<br/>&gt;    a hierarchy among the Forest Troop males, but it was far looser than<br/>&gt;    before: compared with other, more typical savanna baboon groups,<br/>&gt;    high-ranking males rarely harassed subordinates and occasionally even<br/>&gt;    relinquished contested resources to them. Aggression was less<br/>&gt;    frequent, particularly against third parties. And rates of affiliative<br/>&gt;    behaviors, such as males and females grooming each other or sitting<br/>&gt;    together, soared. There were even instances, now and then, of adult<br/>&gt;    males grooming each other -- a behavior nearly as unprecedented as<br/>&gt;    baboons sprouting wings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    This unique social milieu did not arise merely as a function of the<br/>&gt;    skewed sex ratio; other primatologists have occasionally reported on<br/>&gt;    troops with similar ratios but without a comparable social atmosphere.<br/>&gt;    What was key was not just the predominance of females, but the type of<br/>&gt;    male that remained. The demographic disaster -- what evolutionary<br/>&gt;    biologists term a &quot;selective bottleneck&quot; -- had produced a savanna<br/>&gt;    baboon troop quite different from what most experts would have<br/>&gt;    anticipated.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    But the largest surprise did not come until some years later. Female<br/>&gt;    savanna baboons spend their lives in the troop into which they are<br/>&gt;    born, whereas males leave their birth troop around puberty; a troop&apos;s<br/>&gt;    adult males have thus all grown up elsewhere and immigrated as<br/>&gt;    adolescents. By the early 1990s, none of the original low<br/>&gt;    aggression/high affiliation males of Forest Troop&apos;s tuberculosis<br/>&gt;    period was still alive; all of the group&apos;s adult males had joined<br/>&gt;    after the epidemic. Despite this, the troop&apos;s unique social milieu<br/>&gt;    persisted -- as it does to this day, some 20 years after the selective<br/>&gt;    <a href="http://bottleneck.In">bottleneck.In</a> other words, adolescent males that enter Forest Troop<br/>&gt;    after having grown up elsewhere wind up adopting the unique behavioral<br/>&gt;    style of the resident males. As defined by both anthropologists and<br/>&gt;    animal behaviorists, &quot;culture&quot; consists of local behavioral<br/>&gt;    variations, occurring for nongenetic and nonecological reasons, that<br/>&gt;    last beyond the time of their originators. Forest Troop&apos;s low<br/>&gt;    aggression/high affiliation society constitutes nothing less than a<br/>&gt;    multigenerational benign culture.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Continuous study of the troop has yielded some insights into how its<br/>&gt;    culture is transmitted to newcomers. Genetics obviously plays no role,<br/>&gt;    nor apparently does self-selection: adolescent males that transfer<br/>&gt;    into the troop are no different from those that transfer into other<br/>&gt;    troops, displaying on arrival similarly high rates of aggression and<br/>&gt;    low rates of affiliation. Nor is there evidence that new males are<br/>&gt;    taught to act in benign ways by the residents. One cannot rule out the<br/>&gt;    possibility that some observational learning is occurring, but it is<br/>&gt;    difficult to detect given that the distinctive feature of this culture<br/>&gt;    is not the performance of a unique behavior but the performance of<br/>&gt;    typical behaviors at atypically extreme rates.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    To date, the most interesting hint about the mechanism of transmission<br/>&gt;    is the way recently transferred males are treated by Forest Troop&apos;s<br/>&gt;    resident females. In a typical savanna baboon troop, newly transferred<br/>&gt;    adolescent males spend years slowly working their way into the social<br/>&gt;    fabric; they are extremely low ranking -- ignored by females and noted<br/>&gt;    by adult males only as convenient targets for aggression. In Forest<br/>&gt;    Troop, by contrast, new male transfers are inundated with female<br/>&gt;    attention soon after their arrival. Resident females first present<br/>&gt;    themselves sexually to new males an average of 18 days after the males<br/>&gt;    arrive, and they first groom the new males an average of 20 days after<br/>&gt;    they arrive (normal savanna baboons introduce such behaviors after 63<br/>&gt;    and 78 days, respectively). Furthermore, these welcoming gestures<br/>&gt;    occur more frequently in Forest Troop during the early post-transfer<br/>&gt;    period, and there is four times as much grooming of males by females<br/>&gt;    in Forest Troop as elsewhere. From almost the moment they arrive, in<br/>&gt;    other words, new males find out that in Forest Troop, things are done<br/>&gt;    differently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    At present, I think the most plausible explanation is that this<br/>&gt;    troop&apos;s special culture is not passed on actively but simply emerges,<br/>&gt;    facilitated by the actions of the resident members. Living in a group<br/>&gt;    with half the typical number of males, and with the males being nice<br/>&gt;    guys to boot, Forest Troop&apos;s females become more relaxed and less<br/>&gt;    wary. As a result, they are more willing to take a chance and reach<br/>&gt;    out socially to new arrivals, even if the new guys are typical jerky<br/>&gt;    adolescents at first. The new males, in turn, finding themselves<br/>&gt;    treated so well, eventually relax and adopt the behaviors of the<br/>&gt;    troop&apos;s distinctive social milieu.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    NATURAL BORN KILLERS?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Are there any lessons to be learned here that can be applied to<br/>&gt;    human-on-human violence -- apart, that is, from the possible<br/>&gt;    desirability of giving fatal cases of tuberculosis to aggressive<br/>&gt;    people?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Any biological anthropologist opining about human behavior is required<br/>&gt;    by long-established tradition to note that for 99 percent of human<br/>&gt;    history, humans lived in small, stable bands of related<br/>&gt;    hunter-gatherers. Game theorists have shown that a small, cohesive<br/>&gt;    group is the perfect setting for the emergence of cooperation: the<br/>&gt;    identities of the other participants are known, there are<br/>&gt;    opportunities for multiple iterations of games (and thus the ability<br/>&gt;    to punish cheaters), and there is open-book play (players can acquire<br/>&gt;    reputations). And so, those hunter-gatherer bands were highly<br/>&gt;    egalitarian. Empirical and experimental data have also shown the<br/>&gt;    cooperative advantages of small groups at the opposite human extreme,<br/>&gt;    namely in the corporate world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    But the lack of violence within small groups can come at a heavy<br/>&gt;    price. Small homogenous groups with shared values can be a nightmare<br/>&gt;    of conformity. They can also be dangerous for outsiders. Unconsciously<br/>&gt;    emulating the murderous border patrols of closely related male chimps,<br/>&gt;    militaries throughout history have sought to form small, stable units;<br/>&gt;    inculcate them with rituals of pseudokinship; and thereby produce<br/>&gt;    efficient, cooperative killing machines.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Is it possible to achieve the cooperative advantages of a small group<br/>&gt;    without having the group reflexively view outsiders as the Other? One<br/>&gt;    way is through trade. Voluntary economic exchanges not only produce<br/>&gt;    profits; they can also reduce social friction -- as the macaques<br/>&gt;    demonstrated by being more likely to reconcile with a valued partner<br/>&gt;    in food acquisition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Another way is through a fission-fusion social structure, in which the<br/>&gt;    boundaries between groups are not absolute and impermeable. The model<br/>&gt;    here is not the multilevel society of the hamadryas baboons, both<br/>&gt;    because their basic social unit of the harem is despotic and because<br/>&gt;    their fusion consists of nothing more than lots of animals<br/>&gt;    occasionally coming together to utilize a resource peacefully. Human<br/>&gt;    hunter-gatherers are a better example to follow, in that their small<br/>&gt;    bands often merge, split, or exchange members for a while, with such<br/>&gt;    fluidity helping to solve not only environmental resource problems but<br/>&gt;    social problems as well. The result is that instead of the<br/>&gt;    all-or-nothing world of male chimps, in which there is only one&apos;s own<br/>&gt;    group and the enemy, hunter-gatherers can enjoy gradations of<br/>&gt;    familiarity and cooperation stretching over large areas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    The interactions among hunter-gatherers resemble those of other<br/>&gt;    networks, where there are individual nodes (in this case, small<br/>&gt;    groups) and where the majority of interactions between the nodes are<br/>&gt;    local ones, with the frequency of interactions dropping off as a<br/>&gt;    function of distance. Mathematicians have shown that when the ratios<br/>&gt;    among short-, middle-, and long-distance interactions are optimal,<br/>&gt;    networks are robust: they are dominated by highly cooperative clusters<br/>&gt;    of local interactions, but they also retain the potential for less<br/>&gt;    frequent, long-distance communication and coordination.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Optimizing the fission-fusion interactions of hunter-gatherer networks<br/>&gt;    is easy: cooperate within the band; schedule frequent joint hunts with<br/>&gt;    the next band over; have occasional hunts with bands somewhat farther<br/>&gt;    out; have a legend of a single shared hunt with a mythic band at the<br/>&gt;    end of the earth. Optimizing the fission-fusion interactions in<br/>&gt;    contemporary human networks is vastly harder, but the principles are<br/>&gt;    the same.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    In exploring these subjects, one often encounters a pessimism built<br/>&gt;    around the notion that humans, as primates, are hard-wired for<br/>&gt;    xenophobia. Some brain-imaging studies have appeared to support this<br/>&gt;    view in a particularly discouraging way. There is a structure deep<br/>&gt;    inside the brain called the amygdala, which plays a key role in fear<br/>&gt;    and aggression, and experiments have shown that when subjects are<br/>&gt;    presented with a face of someone from a different race, the amygdala<br/>&gt;    gets metabolically active -- aroused, alert, ready for action. This<br/>&gt;    happens even when the face is presented &quot;subliminally,&quot; which is to<br/>&gt;    say, so rapidly that the subject does not consciously see it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    More recent studies, however, should mitigate this pessimism. Test a<br/>&gt;    person who has a lot of experience with people of different races, and<br/>&gt;    the amygdala does not activate. Or, as in a wonderful experiment by<br/>&gt;    Susan Fiske, of Princeton University, subtly bias the subject<br/>&gt;    beforehand to think of people as individuals rather than as members of<br/>&gt;    a group, and the amygdala does not budge. Humans may be hard-wired to<br/>&gt;    get edgy around the Other, but our views on who falls into that<br/>&gt;    category are decidedly malleable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    In the early 1960s, a rising star of primatology, Irven DeVore, of<br/>&gt;    Harvard University, published the first general overview of the<br/>&gt;    subject. Discussing his own specialty, savanna baboons, he wrote that<br/>&gt;    they &quot;have acquired an aggressive temperament as a defense against<br/>&gt;    predators, and aggressiveness cannot be turned on and off like a<br/>&gt;    faucet. It is an integral part of the monkeys&apos; personalities, so<br/>&gt;    deeply rooted that it makes them potential aggressors in every<br/>&gt;    situation.&quot; Thus the savanna baboon became, literally, a textbook<br/>&gt;    example of life in an aggressive, highly stratified, male-dominated<br/>&gt;    society. Yet within a few years, members of the species demonstrated<br/>&gt;    enough behavioral plasticity to transform a society of theirs into a<br/>&gt;    baboon utopia.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    The first half of the twentieth century was drenched in the blood<br/>&gt;    spilled by German and Japanese aggression, yet only a few decades<br/>&gt;    later it is hard to think of two countries more pacific. Sweden spent<br/>&gt;    the seventeenth century rampaging through Europe, yet it is now an<br/>&gt;    icon of nurturing tranquility. Humans have invented the small nomadic<br/>&gt;    band and the continental megastate, and have demonstrated a<br/>&gt;    flexibility whereby uprooted descendants of the former can function<br/>&gt;    effectively in the latter. We lack the type of physiology or anatomy<br/>&gt;    that in other mammals determine their mating system, and have come up<br/>&gt;    with societies based on monogamy, polygyny, and polyandry. And we have<br/>&gt;    fashioned some religions in which violent acts are the entr&eacute;e to<br/>&gt;    paradise and other religions in which the same acts consign one to<br/>&gt;    hell. Is a world of peacefully coexisting human Forest Troops<br/>&gt;    possible? Anyone who says, &quot;No, it is beyond our nature,&quot; knows too<br/>&gt;    little about primates, including ourselves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    [Footnote #1] Considerable sleuthing ultimately revealed that the<br/>&gt;    disease had come from tainted meat in the garbage dump, which had been<br/>&gt;    sold to the tourist lodge thanks to a corrupt meat inspector. The<br/>&gt;    studies were the first of this kind of outbreak in a wild primate<br/>&gt;    population and showed that, in contrast to what happens with humans<br/>&gt;    and captive primates, there was little animal-to-animal transmission<br/>&gt;    of the tuberculosis, and so the disease did not spread in Forest Troop<br/>&gt;    beyond the garbage eaters.&lt;/x-flowed&gt;</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: Gene Ward Smith &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Mon, 27 Mar 2006 19:40:52 -0000<br/>Subject: [metatuning] Re: Evolution</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:metatuning@yahoogroups.com">metatuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Other than the fact that chimps and humans are not related to each<br/>other but to a common anscestor, my biggest objection is that people<br/>don&apos;t know who the Bonobo are.
