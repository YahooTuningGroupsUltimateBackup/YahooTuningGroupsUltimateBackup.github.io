He<br/>found the regimes all had 14 things in common, and he calls these the<br/>identifying characteristics of fascism. The article is titled &apos;Fascism<br/>Anyone?&apos;, by Lawrence Britt, and appears in Free Inquiry&apos;s Spring 2003<br/>issue on page 20.</p><p>The 14 characteristics are:</p><p>1.  Powerful and Continuing Nationalism -- Fascist regimes tend to make<br/>constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other<br/>paraphernalia.  Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing<br/>and in public displays.</p><p>2.  Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights -- Because of fear of<br/>enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are<br/>persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of<br/>&quot;need&quot;.  The people tend to &apos;look the other way&apos; or even approve of<br/>torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of<br/>prisoners, etc.</p><p>3.  Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause -- The people<br/>are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a<br/>perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities;<br/>liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.</p><p>4.  Supremacy of the Military -- Even when there are widespread domestic<br/>problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government<br/>funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected.  Soldiers and military<br/>service are glamorized.</p><p>5.  Rampant Sexism -- The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost<br/>exclusively male-dominated.  Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles<br/>are made more rigid.  Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and<br/>anti-gay legislation and national policy.</p><p>6.  Controlled Mass Media -- Sometimes the media is directly controlled by<br/>the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by<br/>government regulation, or through sympathetic media spokespeople and<br/>executives.  Censorship, especially in wartime, is very common.</p><p>7.  Obsession with National Security -- Fear is used as a motivational<br/>tool by the government over the masses.</p><p>8.  Religion and Government are Intertwined -- Governments in fascist<br/>nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to<br/>manipulate public opinion.  Religious rhetoric and terminology is common<br/>from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are<br/>diametrically opposed to the government&apos;s policies or actions.</p><p>9.  Corporate Power is Protected -- The industrial and business<br/>aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government<br/>leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government<br/>relationship and power elite.</p><p>10.  Labor Power is Suppressed -- Because the organizing power of labor is<br/>the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either<br/>eliminated entirely or are severely suppressed.</p><p>11.  Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts -- Fascist nations tend to<br/>promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia.  It<br/>is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even<br/>arrested.  Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments<br/>often refuse to fund the arts.</p><p>12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment -- Under fascist regimes, the<br/>police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws.  The people are<br/>often willing to overlook police abuses, and even forego civil liberties, in<br/>the name of patriotism.  There is often a national police force with<br/>virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.</p><p>13.  Rampant Cronyism and Corruption -- Fascist regimes almost always are<br/>governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to<br/>government positions, and who use governmental power and authority to<br/>protect their friends from accountability.  It is not uncommon in fascist<br/>regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even<br/>outright stolen by  government leaders.</p><p>14.  Fraudulent Elections -- Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a<br/>complete sham.  Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns<br/>against (or even the assassination of) opposition candidates, the use of<br/>legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and<br/>the manipulation of the media.  Fascist nations also typically use their<br/>judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.</p></div>
