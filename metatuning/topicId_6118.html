Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby, in<br/>mid-September, according to Cheney&apos;s office.</p><p>The move is significant, not only because Cheney is seen increasingly as<br/>the<br/>dominant foreign-policy influence on President George W. Bush, but also<br/>because it adds to the notion that neo-conservatives remain a formidable</p><p>force under Bush despite the sharp plunge in public confidence in Bush&apos;s</p><p>handling of post-war Iraq resulting from the faulty assumptions<br/>propagated<br/>by the &quot;neo-cons&quot; before the war.</p><p>Given the recent intensification of tensions between Washington and<br/>Damascus - touched off by this month&apos;s U.S. veto of a United Nations<br/>Security Council resolution deploring an Israeli air attack on an<br/>alleged<br/>Palestinian camp outside Damascus - Wurmser&apos;s rise takes on added<br/>significance.</p><p>The move also follows House of Representatives&apos; approval of a bill that<br/>would impose new economic and diplomatic sanctions against Syria.</p><p>Wurmser&apos;s status as a favoured protege of arch-hawk and former Defence<br/>Policy Board chairman Richard Perle at the American Enterprise Institute</p><p>(AEI) also speaks loudly to Middle East specialists, who note Perle&apos;s<br/>long-time close association with Cheney, Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld<br/>and<br/>Rumsfeld&apos;s chief deputy Paul Wolfowitz.</p><p>Wolfowitz was the first senior administration official to suggest that<br/>Washington might take action against Syria amid reports last April that<br/>Damascus was sheltering senior Iraqi leaders and weapons of mass<br/>destruction<br/>in the wake of the U.S. invasion.</p><p>&quot;There&apos;s got to be a change in Syria,&quot; Wolfowitz said, accusing the<br/>government of President Bashar Assad of &quot;extreme ruthlessness.&quot; Rumsfeld</p><p>subsequently accused Syria of permitting Islamic &quot;jihadis&quot; to infiltrate</p><p>Iraq to fight U.S. troops.</p><p>Perle, who last week was in Israel to receive a special award from the<br/>&quot;Jerusalem Summit,&quot; an international group of right wing Jews and<br/>Christian<br/>Zionists who describe themselves as defenders of &quot;civilisation&quot; against<br/>&quot;Islamic fundamentalism,&quot; has made no secret of his own desire to<br/>confront<br/>Damascus.</p><p>In a series of interviews, Perle applauded Israel&apos;s attack on Syrian<br/>territory - the first since the 1967 war - in alleged retaliation for a<br/>Palestinian suicide bombing in Israel. &quot;I am happy to see the message<br/>was<br/>delivered to Syria by the Israeli Air Force, and I hope it is the first<br/>of<br/>many such messages,&quot; he said.</p><p>Perle said he &quot;hope(d)&quot; the United States would itself take action<br/>against<br/>Damascus, particularly if it turned out that Syria was acting as a<br/>financial<br/>or recruiting base for the insurgency in Iraq.</p><p>&quot;Syria is itself a terrorist organisation,&quot; he asserted, insisting that<br/>Washington would not find it difficult to send troops to Damascus<br/>despite<br/>its commitment in Iraq. &quot;Syria is militarily very weak,&quot; added Perle.</p><p>Damascus has been in Wurmser&apos;s sights at least since he began working<br/>with<br/>Perle at AEI in the mid-1990s.</p><p>For the latter part of the decade, he wrote frequently to support a<br/>joint<br/>U.S.-Israeli effort to undermine then-President Hafez Assad in hopes of<br/>destroying Baathist rule and hastening the creation of a new order in<br/>the<br/>Levant to be dominated by &quot;tribal, familial and clan unions under<br/>limited<br/>governments.&quot;</p><p>Indeed, it was precisely because of the strategic importance of the<br/>Levant<br/>that Wurmser advocated overthrowing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in<br/>favour<br/>of an Iraqi National Congress (INC) closely tied to the Hashemite<br/>monarchy<br/>in Jordan.</p><p>&quot;Whoever inherits Iraq dominates the entire Levant strategically,&quot; he<br/>wrote<br/>in one 1996 paper for the Jerusalem-based Institute for Advanced<br/>Strategic<br/>and Political Studies (IASPS).</p><p>Wurmser, whose Israeli-born spouse Meyrav Wurmser heads Middle East<br/>studies<br/>at the neo-conservative Hudson Institute, was the main author of a 1996<br/>report by a task force convened by the IASPS and headed by Perle, called<br/>the<br/>&apos;Study Group on a New Israeli Strategy Toward 2000&apos;.</p><p>The paper, called &apos;A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the<br/>Realm&apos;,<br/>was directed to incoming Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.</p><p>It featured a series of recommendations designed to end the process of<br/>Israel trading &quot;land for peace&quot; by transforming the &quot;balance of power&quot;<br/>in<br/>the Middle East in favour of an axis consisting of Israel, Turkey and<br/>Jordan.</p><p>To do so, it called for ousting Saddam Hussein and installing a<br/>Hashemite<br/>leader in Baghdad. From that point, the strategy would be largely<br/>focused on<br/>Syria and, at the least, to reducing its influence in Lebanon.</p><p>Among other steps, the report called for Israeli sponsorship of attacks<br/>on<br/>Syrian territory by &quot;Israeli proxy forces&quot; based in Lebanon and<br/>&quot;striking<br/>Syrian military targets in Lebanon, and should that prove insufficient,<br/>striking at select targets in Syria proper.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Israel can shape its strategic environment, in cooperation with Turkey<br/>and<br/>Jordan, by weakening, containing, even rolling back Syria,&quot; the report<br/>argued, to create a &quot;natural axis&quot; between Israel, Jordan, a Hashemite<br/>Iraq<br/>and Turkey that &quot;would squeeze and detach Syria from the Saudi<br/>Peninsula.&quot;</p><p>&quot;For Syria, this could be the prelude to a redrawing of the map of the<br/>Middle East, which could threaten Syria&apos;s territorial integrity,&quot; it<br/>suggested.</p><p>A follow-up report by Wurmser titled &apos;Coping with Crumbling States&apos;,<br/>also<br/>favoured a substantial redrawing of the Middle East along tribal and<br/>familial lines in light of what he called an &quot;emerging phenomenon - the<br/>crumbling of Arab secular-nationalist nations.&quot;</p><p>The penchant of Washington and the West in general for backing<br/>secular-nationalist states against the threat of militant Islamic<br/>fundamentalism was a strategic error, warned Wurmser in the second<br/>study, a<br/>conclusion he repeated in a 1999 book, Tyranny&apos;s Ally, which included a<br/>laudatory foreword by Perle and was published by AEI.</p><p>While the book focused on Iraq not Syria, it elaborated on Wurmser&apos;s<br/>previous arguments by attacking regional specialists in U.S.<br/>universities,<br/>the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) who,<br/>according to him, were too wedded to strong secular states in the Arab<br/>world<br/>as the preferred guarantors of regional stability.</p><p>&quot;Our Middle East scholarly and policy elite are informed by bad ideas<br/>about<br/>the region that lead them to bad policies,&quot; he charged, echoing a<br/>position<br/>often taken by Perle.</p><p>In the book&apos;s acknowledgments, Wurmser praised those who most influenced<br/>his<br/>work, a veritable &quot;who&apos;s who&quot; of those neo-cons most closely tied to<br/>Israel&apos;s far right, including Perle himself, another AEI scholar,<br/>Michael<br/>Ledeen and Undersecretary of Defence for Policy and the man in charge of</p><p>post-Iraq war planning, Douglas Feith.</p><p>He listed former CIA director James Woolsey, who has called the conflict<br/>in<br/>Syria the early stages of &quot;World War IV,&quot; Harold Rhode, a Feith aide who<br/>has<br/>also called himself Wolfowitz&apos;s &quot;Islamic Affairs adviser&quot; and INC leader</p><p>Ahmed Chalabi.</p><p>Wurmser also gave thanks to Irving Moskowitz, a major casino operator<br/>and<br/>long-time funder of Israel&apos;s settlement movement, whom he described as a</p><p>&quot;gentle man whose generous support of AEI allows me to be here.&quot; 1996<br/>Report, &quot;A Clean Break&quot; and &quot;Coping With Crumbling States.&quot;</p><p>Copyright: Inter Press Service<br/><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article5031.htm">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article5031.htm</a></p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
