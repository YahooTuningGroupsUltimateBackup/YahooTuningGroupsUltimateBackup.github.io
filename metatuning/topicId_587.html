The statement you quoted is a little on<br/>the extreme<br/>side. Read Ronald Numbers&apos; book &quot;The Creationists&quot; for a sympathetic treatment.<br/>Also, the last episode of the PBS Evolution series is short on science, strong<br/>on sociology of belief, and deals sympathetically with Wheaton college students<br/>who find learning about evolution a challenge to their faith.</p><p>Re Linton: Not true, Shigella dysenteriae turns out to be E. coli which<br/>has picked<br/>up virulence plasmids. This is a clear case of how organisms can<br/>increase their<br/>complexity by simple genetic means.</p><p>Re HIV: Nobody claims that HIV becomes a new species in the bodies of<br/>victims. All that is claimed is that drug resistance arises by mutation during<br/>treatment and that relaxing the selection allows the remaining wild type<br/>viruses<br/>to outgrow the mutants. Because the viral load is ne low, the immune<br/>system can recover some function. I agree that it is a poor example, but<br/>it does<br/>illustrate  mutation and selection in circumstances of public interest.</p><p>Re Skeptical Dissent: This means nothing more than that 100 not very<br/>well known<br/>scientists out of several hundred thousand in the US alone are willing<br/>to publically<br/>proclaim their ignorance.  I would take such a list more seriously if<br/>the signees were<br/>from the National Academy of Sciences or were the heads of the major<br/>biological societies and editors of the peer-reviewed journals. Note<br/>that many are from religious colleges<br/>or are fields quite distant from evolutionary biology.</p><p>However, depending on the circumstances of the poll, I might agree with<br/>it, though<br/>I believe it is deliberately and dishonestly designed to confuse the<br/>public as to<br/>the real status of evolutionary theories.</p><p>The question as posed omits other known evolutionary mechanisms,<br/>particularly those which INCREASE the genetic complexity of organisms, a<br/>point ignored by ID and IR theorists. These mechanisms include gene<br/>duplication (and amplification), exon shuffling, chromosomal doubling,<br/>hybridization, horizontal transfer (natural gene transfer by viruses,<br/>free DNA, etc.) and sub-cellular symbiosis. The statement also ignores<br/>neutral mutation, genetic drift, and allopatric speciation (aka<br/>punctuated equilibrium in the weak sense) an other known mechanisms of<br/>evolutionary change.  The drafters of the question should take the 2nd<br/>part seriously themselves.</p><p>The list is an interesting mix to say the least. Hearn is a theistic<br/>evolutionist, but not a young earth creationist. He was featured on the<br/>last episode of the Evolution series on PBS. Behe is a legitimate<br/>biochemist (I have one of his DNA papers in my files), but has gone off<br/>the deep when with ID/IR theory. Many of the other scientists are from<br/>fields other than evolutionary biology or biochemistry.</p><p>As for Schaefer, Nobel Prize nominations are made only by previous<br/>winners and their deliberations are secret. Anyone else can nominate<br/>anybody for a Nobel Prize, but only official nominations by Nobel<br/>laureates count.</p><p>Tipler is not even a supernaturalist as he believes that God is a<br/>material supercomputer<br/>that gets its energy  from a special type of anisotropic collapse of the<br/>whole universe after the expansion due to the Big Bang has stopped and<br/>reversed into the Big Crunch. He also believes that this supercomputer<br/>can simulate as finite state automata every intelligent being that will<br/>ever exist in the universe and that what we call Resurrection and<br/>Immortality are simulations in this machine.  Furthermore, he believes<br/>that this supercomputer sends messages backwards in time (advanced<br/>potentials) to tweak evolution so some intelligent species builds it.<br/>Somehow I don&apos;t think this is creationists have in mind when they ask<br/>that alternatives to Darwinian evolution be taught in schools.</p><p>I met him at a Skeptics Conference at Cal Tech a few years ago, joined<br/>him for lunch,  and have read his book, &quot;The Physics of Immortality.&quot;<br/>The physics makes sense and the theory is testable. However, the most<br/>recent cosmological data indicate that the expansion is speeding up, not<br/>decreasing, and that there is not enough matter in the universe to cause<br/>it to collapse.</p><p>Except for Dembski and Fana, I didn&apos;t see any names I immediately<br/>recognized, so I don&apos;t anything about the rest of them and don&apos;t have<br/>time to look them up. In any case, appeals to authority are unimportant<br/>in science.</p><p>Whether evolution erodes people&apos;s faith has no bearing on whether it<br/>occurred or not. The Bible also implies that the world is flat and that<br/>pi is 3, but hundreds of millions of Christians and Jews accept the<br/>rotundity of the earth and the transcendentality of PI. People can<br/>modify their faiths to accomodate the findings of science and<br/>mathematics. Haverstick&apos;s post shows how he has done it and the<br/>evolutionist Stephen Jay Gould has written a book recently about<br/>reconciling the two &quot;magisteria&quot; as he calls them.</p><p>You missed the point about the fruit fly data, only a very small<br/>fraction of which was shown on PBS. These studies show that the basic<br/>mechanisms determining the body plans of vertebrates and arthropods are<br/>the same, something that special creation does not predict.<br/>There is an immense literature on homeotic genes, hox boxes and the like<br/>and the homologies between the genes themselves, their chromosomal<br/>organization, and their functions are clearly apparent. The so-called<br/>evolutionary dead ends or monsters are simply the means by which the<br/>genes were first identified. It is often easier to look at pathologies<br/>than the normal states because what observe differences due to loss or<br/>gain of functions. This methodology is uncontroversial.</p><p>Similarly the basic control genes for eyes are the same in both phyla.<br/>Dawkins has reported that eyes have evolved independently from primitive<br/>light sensitive patches at least 20 times in different lineages, but the<br/>basic control mechanisms have been conserved since the Pre-Cambrian when<br/>the basic body plans evolved and diverged. We have a whole series of<br/>eyes of differing design and complexity. Computer simulations suggest<br/>that it would take only about 100,000 generations to go from an eye spot<br/>to an eye as complex as that of a vertebrate or octopus.</p><p>Similarly, birds and dinosaurs have been shown to be very closely<br/>related and are now classified in the same family. There are dinosaurs<br/>with feathers as well as birds with teeth, bony tails, and wing claws.<br/>For some time it has been known the chick cells in culture can be<br/>induced to make tooth proteins; now we know that even more genes in the<br/>tooth program have been retained as chick embryos can make tooth buds,<br/>although adult birds no longer have teeth.</p><p> All of these data show that we can understand &quot;irreducibly complex&quot;<br/>systems, given enough data and a modicum of imagination. Frankly, IR and<br/>ID are pseudoscience and have been refuted numerous times as they are<br/>basically &quot;arguments from ignorance.&quot;  Just because Dembski and Behe<br/>can&apos;t imagine how eyes or the immune system (which by the way, has been<br/>shown by Doolittle at UCSD to simpler homologs in invertebrates ),<br/>doesn&apos;t justify giving up, saying we can never understand how they<br/>evolved,  and therefore claiming that God must have designed them. The<br/>mathematics are irrelevant because the assumptions are wrong -- &quot;GIGO.&quot;</p><p>--John</p></div>
