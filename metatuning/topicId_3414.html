Meru, carried out to a<br/>12 tone constant melodic structure, positioned as chromatic tetrachords<br/>within the Lesser Perfect System, with the highest rank doubling at the<br/>&quot;fifth&quot;, resulting in the interpolations of tones in the gaps of the<br/>overall chromatic structure and further completed by interpolations<br/>resulting from the transposition in the bottom rank.</p><p>The repertoire of solo hammer-like dulcimer music in Anaphoria<br/>flourished in the 17th century to such a high degree that little change<br/>in its &quot;form&quot; has developed. We would be at a lost though if we looked<br/>for those architectonic models commonly found in the west.  Instead we<br/>must bear witness to the almost universal use of the &quot;interacting of a<br/>garden of musical characters&quot;, possibly more like spirits or genii in<br/>alchemical combinations able to divide and mold together.  It would be a<br/>mistake not to take note of those changes that have occurred; new scale<br/>resources and new technical innovation passed on and developed by the<br/>masters in the successive generations till the present.  Overall it is a<br/>tradition not unlike a growing tree, new branches from its nourishing<br/>unmoving trunk.</p><p>and</p><p>The Biggi Vinkeloe Trio<br/>Biggi Vinkeloe, reeds<br/>Lisle Ellis, contrabass<br/>Donald Robinson, percussion</p><p>- -</p><p>Line Space Line is proud to host two great sets of music this coming<br/>Monday.  First up is local microtonal alchemist Kraig Grady performing a<br/>very hypnotic solo<br/>set on the unique Anaphorian hammer dulcimer.  The second set is a very<br/>rare chance to catch the wonderful Swedish saxophonist Biggi Vinkeloe<br/>with the sensitive<br/>and sympathetic rhythm section of Lisle Ellis and Donald Robinson. Biggi<br/>Vinkeloe has been coming to the West Coast quite regularly as of late,<br/>but this is a chance<br/>to hear her music in her setting of choice, the classic<br/>reeds-bass-percussion trio.</p><p>- -</p><p>Biggi Vinkeloe, is an alto player and flutist of immense energy and<br/>creativity. She was born in Germany and has lived in France where she<br/>began her musical career.<br/> She is now living in Sweden. She has performed with, amongst others,<br/>Andr&iuml;&iquest;&half; Jaume, Cecil Taylor, Barre Phillips, Peter Uuskyla, Peter Kowald,<br/>Peter Friis Nielsen,<br/>Perry Robinson, Miya Masaoka, Wayne Lopes, Ken Filiano, Steve Swell,<br/>Lotte Anker, Filippo Monico and Gino Robair, among others before forming<br/>her own trio<br/>in 1990.</p><p>Lisle Ellis has been an active performer on acoustic bass, and a<br/>composer, conductor, curator and director of orchestras, and small<br/>ensembles for more than<br/>twenty-five years. He has worked with many players associated with Cecil<br/>Taylor including Andrew Cyrille, Raphe Malik, as well as the late Jimmy<br/>Lyons and<br/>Glenn Spearman. Ellis has toured and performed worldwide with many if<br/>not all of the luminaries of creative music including Paul Bley, Alvin<br/>Curran, Marilyn<br/>Crispell, Myra Melford, and Paul Plimley..</p><p>Described variously as a &quot;percussive dervish&quot; (Coda), and as a provider<br/>of &quot;solid support,&quot; Donald Robinson is a technical master of the drums.<br/>He has been called<br/>&quot;a stalwart of the San Francisco Bay avant-garde jazz scene,&quot; playing<br/>and recording with many of the area&apos;s improvisational players, from<br/>saxophonists John Tchicai,<br/>Larry Ochs (from ROVA Saxophone Quartet), Glenn Spearman and Marco<br/>Eneidi to koto player Miya Masaoka, and with prominent visitors like<br/>Cecil Taylor,<br/>trumpeter Raphe Malik and Canadian pianist Paul Plimley.</p><p>- -</p><p>- -</p><p>line space line<br/>Monday, November 11th at 8 pm<br/>Salvation Theater<br/>1519 Griffith Park Blvd (at Sunset Blvd)<br/>Los Angeles, CA 90026-1048</p><p>$10-5 sliding scale</p><p>Jeremy Drake contact@...<br/>Chris Heenan cbheenan@...<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM 8-9PM PST</p></div>
