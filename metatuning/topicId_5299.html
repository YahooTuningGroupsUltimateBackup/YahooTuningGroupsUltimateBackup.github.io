Horrors!</p><p>We ate cupcakes, bread and butter, and drank soda pop with sugar in it, but<br/>we were never overweight because we were always outside playing.</p><p>We shared one soft drink with four friends , from one bottle, and no one<br/>actually died from this.</p><p>We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps and then rode down<br/>the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into the bushes<br/>a few times, we learned to solve the problem.</p><p>We would leave home in the morning and play all day , as long as we were back<br/>when the street lights came on. No one was able to reach us all day. No cell<br/>phones. Unthinkable!</p><p>We did not have Playstations, Nintendo 64, X-Boxes, no video games at all, no<br/>99 channels on cable, video tape movies, surround sound, personal cell<br/>phones, personal computers, or Internet chat rooms.</p><p>We had friends! We went outside and found them.</p><p>We played dodge ball, and sometimes, the ball would really hurt. We fell out<br/>of trees, got cut and broke bones and teeth, and there were no lawsuits from<br/>these accidents . They were accidents. No one was to blame but us.&nbsp; Remember<br/>accidents?</p><p>We had fights and punched each other and got black and blue and learned to<br/>get over it.</p><p>We made up games with sticks and tennis balls and, although we were told it<br/>would happen , we did not put out any eyes.</p><p>We rode bikes or walked to a friend&apos;s home and knocked on the door, or rang<br/>the bell or just walked in and talked to them.</p><p>Little League had tryouts and not everyone made the team . Those who didn&apos;t<br/>had to learn to deal with disappointment.&nbsp;</p><p>Some students weren&apos;t as smart as others, so they failed a grade and were<br/>held back to repeat the same grade.<br/>Horrors!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Tests were not adjusted for any reason.</p><p>Our actions were our own. Consequences were expected.</p><p>The idea of&nbsp; parents bailing us out if we got in trouble in school or broke a<br/>law was unheard of. They actually sided with the school or the law. Imagine<br/>that!</p><p>This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers, problem solvers,<br/>and inventors, ever.&nbsp;</p><p>We had freedom, failure, success, and responsibility ---&nbsp; and we learned how<br/>to deal with it. And you&apos;re one of them!<br/>Congratulations.</p><p>Please pass this on to others who have had the luck to grow up as kids before<br/>lawyers and government regulated our lives for our own good !!!</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/8/2003 12:02:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I Can&apos;t Believe We Made It!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; According to today&apos;s regulators and bureaucrats, those of us<br/>&gt; who were kids in the 30&apos;s, 40&apos;s, 50&apos;s, 60&apos;s, 70&apos;s or even the<br/>&gt; early 80&apos;s, probably shouldn&apos;t have survived.</p><p>I was born in &apos;77.  I was just old enough to see the freedom<br/>my brother&apos;s generation enjoyed.  If you were a teen in 1981<br/>you could pretty much do anything.  Your biggest fear was your<br/>parents, not the cops.</p><p>One of the biggest changes I can remember is the advent of<br/>open container rules.  We&apos;d go down to North Carolina for<br/>short summer vacations every-other year.  Even into the early<br/>90&apos;s, my Dad would sometimes have a beer in the cup holder<br/>of the car!  It maybe wasn&apos;t a good idea, but it wasn&apos;t all<br/>that uncommon.</p><p>I&apos;m not aware of any general reduction in alcohol-related<br/>accidents.  Of course, there are more drivers on the same<br/>roads (pretty much since Ike built them) these days.</p><p>I was all grown up before cell phones made it.  I see kids<br/>going around with phones and it gives me the creeps.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
