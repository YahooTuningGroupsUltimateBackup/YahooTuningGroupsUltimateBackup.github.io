His<br/>fledgling group of adherents now meet in a<br/>pyramid-shaped temple in Salt Lake City.</p><p>...</p><p>since Summum&apos;s establishment in 1975, 250,000 people<br/>have received its teachings</p><p>...</p><p>The pyramid temple, made of anodized copper over steel<br/>with sides 40 feet wide at the base, sits in a one-acre<br/>compound in an industrial zone just off an interstate<br/>in Salt Lake City. The temple is open to the public<br/>each Thursday night for meditation and philosophy<br/>instruction.</p><p>Three mummified animals encased in bronze sit in the<br/>entryway. .... The sacramental wine is fermented in a<br/>gleaming stainless steel vat set behind the furniture.</p><p>During the 77-day fermentation process, those who<br/>espouse Summum meditate for the wines so they will<br/>contain spiritual concepts. The wines are then aged<br/>from one to 15 years.</p><p>...</p><p>Ra said at least 250,000 bottles have been given away<br/>to people who have undergone a screening process ...</p><p>Adherents use the wines, also known as &quot;liquid<br/>knowledge&quot; and &quot;nectar publications,&quot; to enhance seven<br/>types of meditation, including the one serving Summum&apos;s<br/>paramount belief: the power of sexual ecstasy.</p><p>Summum&apos;s take is that copulation played a vital role in<br/>creation of the universe, and that all progression and<br/>evolution happens through sexual ecstasy.</p><p>With Summum, sexuality is not merely an avenue to<br/>enjoyment. &quot;It&apos;s there for meditation,&quot; Ra said. &quot;But<br/>when you have that ecstasy, that&apos;s creation itself. We<br/>call it the state of becoming god. It&apos;s not something<br/>you would do at a brothel or only for procreation.&quot;</p><p>The vital role of sex in Ra&apos;s beliefs is evident in<br/>decorations in the pyramid, including candleholders<br/>molded to look like sex organs.</p><p>Ra&apos;s assistant ... also does mummifications, which<br/>Summum prefers over burial.</p><p>Mummification costs about $8,000 for animals and starts<br/>at $63,000 for humans. None of the 147 people who<br/>prepaid have died yet, Ra said.</p><p>etc</p><p>full story at:</p><p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/wire/US/ap20020426_10.html">http://abcnews.go.com/wire/US/ap20020426_10.html</a></p></div>
