This is<br/>a different issue from the fact that no process of<br/>generating energy is 100% efficient.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Siemens rates the SP150 at 150W (I believe, during &quot;peak&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;hours), and guarantees it will come within 80% of this<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;for 25 years.  Let&apos;s assume it only ever makes 80% -- 120W.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Let&apos;s say I can expect in Berkeley only 2 hours per day of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;peak sun.  That means in one month the SP150 can pay for<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;itself, if I&apos;m doing this right.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;OK, using these numbers you&apos;re off by a factor of 1000.<br/>&gt;&gt;(kW vs W). (Sanity check here: obviously very few<br/>&gt;&gt;people pay $870/month for electricity &amp; most people are<br/>&gt;&gt;also using a lot more than 150W of electricity at any<br/>&gt;&gt;given time since that is only one 150W lightbulb and<br/>&gt;&gt;1/3 of a typical 450W computer.)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;In 1000 months, it will pay off using these figures.<br/>&gt;&gt;That&apos;s 83 years, which is more than 3 times as long as<br/>&gt;&gt;the cells are expected to last.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oops; silly factors of 1000.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can make it pay for itself if we give realgoods the<br/>&gt; normal retail markup of 100%, and assume I get 3 hours<br/>&gt; of peak sun a day (which is quite reasonable, from what<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve read).  And that&apos;s still assuming Siemens uses<br/>&gt; electric heat to cook the thing, pays retail for<br/>&gt; electricity, and has no other expenses in making it.</p><p>You are forgetting that your electric power also has<br/>about a 100% profit markup. I am a member of an<br/>nonprofit electric power collective which sells me<br/>electricity at cost which is 6 cents / kilowatt-hr,<br/>which is 1/2 your stated cot of 12 cents/ kilowatt-hr.<br/>Obviously we see here that local electricity costs and<br/>the location and electricity contract of the solar fab<br/>facility is a relevant factor, which is why the subject<br/>of actual energy consumed in manufacture is so<br/>important.</p><p>If though we wish to debate whether or not you can ever<br/>break-even on the COST of a solar panel, that is a<br/>different issue. First, let us remove the factors of<br/>cost-supports and government subsidies that can change<br/>the true economics here. (Obviously if the government<br/>buys a solar panel and hands it to me for free, solar<br/>power suddenly becomes infinitely more cost effective<br/>than grid power.)</p><p>Anyway, the issue of break-even cost is already<br/>well-known. Unless you live in an area in which grid<br/>energy is unusually expensive -- Hawaii is currently<br/>the only state in the US where this is currently true<br/>for the already-grid connected -- you will *never*<br/>recoup the cost of your solar plant.</p><p>See:</p><p><a href="http://www.eren.doe.gov/millionroofs/breakevn.html">http://www.eren.doe.gov/millionroofs/breakevn.html</a></p><p>...for unassailable &amp; recent evidence of this fact.</p><p>&gt;&gt;A standard 50W panel produces 250W during the summer<br/>&gt;&gt;under ideal circumstances (noon, no clouds or shadows,<br/>&gt;&gt;module nearly new).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, really?</p><p>Yes, seems that&apos;s the way they are rated.</p><p>&gt;&gt;of its original *peak* production (which should be 5<br/>&gt;&gt;times the rating).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, I&apos;ve been using the rating as the peak production.<br/>&gt; If I get three hours of peak sun a day at 600Wp/hr<br/>&gt; (.8 * 150 * 5), and assume once again that realgoods<br/>&gt; makes no money on the transaction, in pays off in 11<br/>&gt; years.</p><p>You will only get a moment of your peak production and<br/>only at the beginning of your ownership curve<br/>(performance degrades as time goes by) and only if you<br/>are situated in an ideal location.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Cells do degrade quite a bit over time using the methods<br/>&gt;&gt;that have been devised for creating them and the harsh<br/>&gt;&gt;conditions to which they are exposed in use.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They guarantee 80% of rated output for 25 years.  I&apos;m<br/>&gt; assuming it never makes more than that from day 1.  And<br/>&gt; I&apos;m assuming it&apos;s pitch black except for my 3 hours of<br/>&gt; peak sun every day.</p><p>This is an important distinction -- do they guarantee<br/>that the peak will be 80% of rated at the end of 25<br/>years? You seem to be saying so. In this case then<br/>there is an apparent loss of peak power production from<br/>750 W (peak = 5 * rated = 5 * 150) to 120W (.8 * rated<br/>= .8 * 150) which means there is a *6.25* times<br/>reduction in power output over the life of your cell.</p><p>Might also note that your cell cost $5.80/rated Watt<br/>seems to be a good price if it is inclusive -- doe<br/>states $6-$7 complete to be more usual, as of Dec.<br/>2001.</p><p>Solar can be cost effective in remote areas where the<br/>cost of running an electric line would tip the scales<br/>to solar&apos;s advantage. But that doesn&apos;t change the<br/>apparent situation we are in where fabricating solar<br/>cells currently burns more fossil fuels than the solar<br/>cell replaces in its lifetime, which means that the use<br/>of solar cells right now results in more pollution than<br/>coal.</p><p>The environmental spiel given by the for-profit solar<br/>cell peddlers is just that -- a spiel. Those truly<br/>hoping to reduce their generation of pollution would do<br/>better to look elsewhere at this time than solar until<br/>it is ready.</p><p>I have a feeling that the day that solar cells can<br/>produce more electricity than they consume we will all<br/>know it because that will be the day that construction<br/>of the first commercial solar generating plant will be<br/>announced.</p><p>Again, let common sense prevail -- if solar is more<br/>cost effective than grid power, why does not a single<br/>solar cell manufacturing facility run off of solar<br/>power?</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=2237 href="#2237">ðŸ”—</a>clumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2002 10:51:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;I can make it pay for itself if we give realgoods the<br/>&gt;&gt;normal retail markup of 100%, and assume I get 3 hours<br/>&gt;&gt;of peak sun a day (which is quite reasonable, from what<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;ve read).

I&apos;m guessing they don&apos;t use<br/>electric heat to cook the panels.  I&apos;ve already<br/>disclaimed my use of the retail price of power to divide<br/>more than once.  Nevertheless I think it demonstrates<br/>it&apos;s not impossible that I&apos;m right.</p><p>&gt;Anyway, the issue of break-even cost is already<br/>&gt;well-known.</p><p>The only thing I was able to find -- a couple posts on the<br/>usenet -- claim it&apos;s an urban myth.</p><p>&gt; Unless you live in an area in which grid<br/>&gt; energy is unusually expensive -- Hawaii is currently<br/>&gt; the only state in the US where this is currently true<br/>&gt; for the already-grid connected -- you will *never*<br/>&gt; recoup the cost of your solar plant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; See:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.eren.doe.gov/millionroofs/breakevn.html">http://www.eren.doe.gov/millionroofs/breakevn.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...for unassailable &amp; recent evidence of this fact.</p><p>We&apos;re not talking about plants -- we&apos;re talking about<br/>the efficiency of panels.  Storage, transmission, and<br/>business models have nothing to do with this issue.</p><p>I&apos;ve also been told that no nuclear power plant has<br/>ever paid for itself (&quot;They only build them to get<br/>weapons-grade uranium&quot;).  I doubt this, too, but less<br/>so than your statement about solar panels.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;of its original *peak* production (which should be 5<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;times the rating).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Oh, I&apos;ve been using the rating as the peak production.<br/>&gt;&gt;If I get three hours of peak sun a day at 600Wp/hr<br/>&gt;&gt;(.8 * 150 * 5), and assume once again that realgoods<br/>&gt;&gt;makes no money on the transaction, in pays off in 11<br/>&gt;&gt;years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You will only get a moment of your peak production and<br/>&gt;only at the beginning of your ownership curve<br/>&gt;(performance degrades as time goes by) and only if you<br/>&gt;are situated in an ideal location.</p><p>Siemens *guarantees* 80% of the rated output over<br/>25 years.

You&apos;re making a very<br/>important mistake in the &quot;wait until ready department&quot;.<br/>It&apos;s the consumer market that can really get something<br/>ready in a hurry.</p><p>And solar cells on homes have the important effect of<br/>de-centralizing power generation, yielding the social/<br/>psychological benefits I mentioned earlier.</p><p>&gt;Again, let common sense prevail -- if solar is more<br/>&gt;cost effective than grid power, why does not a single<br/>&gt;solar cell manufacturing facility run off of solar<br/>&gt;power?</p><p>Because it takes a lot of surface area, and land is expensive.</p><p>[You could put one in the desert, but you&apos;d have to move the<br/>power a good distance, which I&apos;m guessing would involve loss<br/>to resistance and incur large expenses of building high-<br/>capacity lines in remote areas.  It would also have a large<br/>environmental impact.  All of these problems go away when you<br/>put them on already wasted space -- rooftops (actually worse<br/>than wasted, since conventional shingles are designed to fail --<br/>even sold based on their engineered lifetimes!), right next<br/>to where the power is used.  Unfortunately, the high initial<br/>investment -- made up mostly of the cost of contracting,<br/>installation, and batteries -- makes it difficult for most<br/>home owners to switch.]</p><p>It generates the bulk of its power on off-peak hours.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=2238 href="#2238">ðŸ”—</a>clumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2002 11:29:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here is a document that addresses the issue at hand:</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/EnergyPayback.pdf">http://lumma.org/EnergyPayback.pdf</a></p><p>According to it, it takes 3-4 years to break even<br/>with today&apos;s technology -- about 15% of the power<br/>a solar unit generates goes into paying back the<br/>power it took to make.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=2242 href="#2242">ðŸ”—</a>clumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/11/2002 11:27:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>By the way, Jeff, I do think it&apos;s cool that<br/>you&apos;re in an electricity co-op.
