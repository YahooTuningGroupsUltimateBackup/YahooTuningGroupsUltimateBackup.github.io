In<br>>particular, I<br>>don't see that he's advocating any particular style of music over any other.<br>>Here's what I think he's pointing out, and I believe quite accurately and<br>>appropriately:  Technical, improvisational, and compositional skill of the sort<br>>that comes only with untold hours and hours of practice, has a VERY big effect<br>>upon the excitement of the music that comes of it.<br>><br>>   And that, I believe quite firmly, is true of ALMOST every style of music.<br>>...<br>>   Now I say that virtuosity is valuable to "almost" every style of music,<br>>because I suppose that if you actually WANT to express a feeling of<br>>rigidity and<br>>clumsiness, then I guess you would actually benefit from lack of virtuosity.<br>>But rigidity and clumsiness are certainly a very limited realm of expression.<br><br>I think what Adam is pointing out is that a composer's instrumental chops<br>(which, I believe is what Neil focussed on in his post) are much more<br>fundamental to certain types of music than others. Neil's focus in his<br>post, while I may be slightly more sympathetic to it than Adam, still<br>betrays a bias towards certain styles.<br><br>Not every composer of good music has been a virtuoso, or even good,<br>performer. In these days of sequencing and computer composition, there are<br>certain styles in which the composer does not have to be a performer at<br>all. Perhaps you don't like music written this way, but I've heard a lot of<br>good CDs that included no live performance.<br><br>It's possible I misread Neil's post, and, as Gary implies, it should be<br>extended to include "compositional virtuosity," not just instrumental. But<br>if that's the case, then his post amounts to little more than "Why don't<br>you people write better music?" Hardly a helpful way to spend bandwidth.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
