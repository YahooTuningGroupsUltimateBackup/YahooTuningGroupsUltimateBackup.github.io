To ru=<br>n<br>a riff on Korzybski, notations are not the sounds themselves, and no matt=<br>er<br>how convenient a particular notation may be, no single notation is<br>neccessary. For example, attempts to standardize Just intonation with<br>Johnston's or my own or some other notation should be discouraged in favo=<br>r<br>of getting players to think flexibly about pitch in general. Flexible<br>notational will only follow from such a precondition. As another example,=<br><br>the continuous claims for priority in graphing techniques on this list<br>don't lead anywhere (or at least anywhere previously unvisited by Riemann=<br><br>or Tanaka or Wilson...). As some one has recently pointed out,<br>triangulating a lattice is an obvious idea (as it was to Tanaka a century=<br><br>ago).</div><h3><a id=8930 href="#8930">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/1998 9:23:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>All-<br>	I'm finally back on line after a two week hiatus.

It combines the scholarly aspects of the<br>western monochord with a sensitivity to the aesthetics of the pitch-timbr=<br>e<br>continuum that remains largely unsurpassed in music history. The instrume=<br>nt<br>itself is an object of great reverence and respect, played with a minimum=<br><br>of physical contact by the player (contrasting, for example, with the way=<br> a<br>guitarist or veena player embraces the instrument). The instrument is<br>extremely quiet, played upon a tabletop for an audience consisting of onl=<br>y<br>the player himself (traditionally women were not allowed to play).
