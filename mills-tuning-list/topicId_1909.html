By your definition, diminished triads <br>are 2nd-order-ME as well as major and minor triads. This is because, after <br>deriving the diatonic scale as the 7-deg ME scale in 12-tet (which is <br>historically fallacious, but never mind for now) you pretend that the 7 <br>scale degrees are actually 7-tet when determining the 3-deg ME scale. Then <br>you remember the actual 12-tet positions of the 7-tet scale, and using them <br>you translate the 3-deg scale back to 12-tet. In my definition, one keeps <br>the 7 scale degrees always in 12-tet, even when determining the closest <br>approximation to 3-tet. Then only major and minor triads are obtained.<br><br>In case that wasn't clear, imagine a clock. First you take a disk with seven <br>equidistant arrows pointing away from the center. No matter how you rotate <br>this disk, the numbers on the clock face that come closest to the arrows <br>form a diatonic scale. That's just 1st order maximal evenness. Now, on the <br>SAME clock, put a disk with three equidistant arrows. No matter how you <br>rotate it, the diatonic numbers derived previously that come closest to the <br>three arrows will form either a major or a minor triad. (If two arrows each <br>fall exactly between two notes, which happens with probability zero if you <br>"spin" the disk randomly, and you decide to round one arrow clockwise and <br>the other counterclockwise, you can get either a diminished or a suspended <br>triad. But such cases should be disallowed, or else you can conjure up some <br>funny results of 1st-order ME, such as a 12-out-of-22 scale with intervals <br>1-2-2-2-2-1-2-2-2-2-2-2, which I'm sure you'd disallow as well, although <br>there are other reasons for liking this scale!).<br><br>Your procedure requires two clocks, one with 12 hours and one with 7 hours. <br>You put the 7-arrow disk on the 12-hour clock, the 3-arrow disk on the <br>7-hour clock, and then translate from one clock to the other. So your <br>procedure requires more construction and more abstraction (the translation <br>process) than mine.<br><br>Anyway, stepping up to 22->12->7, you'll see that my definition does not <br>require the additional rule that there be only one tritone, which apparently <br>you derived from Jay Rahn (what possible justification is there for this <br>rule?), in order to isolate the four gramas.<br><br>I view this as little more than a curiosity since, if you buy this theory as <br>an explanation, you still have to explain where the three numbers 22, 12, <br>and 7 come from. But I thought this would be interesting to you.<br><br>I have a paper on 22-tone equal temperament in the upcoming Xenharmonikon. I <br>have two new scales (one ME, one not) that have more of the important <br>properties of the diatonic scale than any other scale ever invented, save <br>perhaps the pentatonic scale. A 7-limit (tetratic) TONAL system is the goal <br>and this goal is attained. I also discuss plausible derivations of the <br>22-tone quantification of the Indian system. Finally, I propose an unequal <br>22-tone tuning in which several transpositions of my new scales as well as <br>well-tuned (close to JI) Indian scales are available. I'm having my guitar <br>refretted to 22-equal . . .<br><br>I look forward to hearing from you.<br><br> -Paul E.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 27 Mar 1997 23:04 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA19907; Thu, 27 Mar 1997 23:04:15 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA19903<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id OAA08326; Thu, 27 Mar 1997 14:02:38 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 27 Mar 1997 14:02:38 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B1E8ACE1DCBED.8F69@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
