I have seen - but not heard - an LP by Emil Richards<br>>with a title akin to _Emil Richards and his Microtonal Blues Band_. It was<br>>in Erv Wilson*s record collection and he pointedly stopped me from further<br>>inquiry.<br><br>There were two LP's, both still sitting in my closet:<br><br>- "Journey To Bliss - Emil Richards and the Microtonal Blues Band" <br>(Impulse Stereo A-9166)<br><br>- "Spirit of 1976 - Emil Richards and the Microtonal Blues Band / Live at<br>Donte's" <br>(Impulse Stereo A-9182)<br><br>To be upfront about it, these are not excursions into microtonal composition<br>per se;  Emil and company just used microtonal instruments, virtually all of<br>these percussion (and mostly made by Emil, I think) to add colors to the<br>music.  They had been influenced by Hari Har Rao, who had recently begun<br>teaching Indian music in the LA area at the time.  Most of the expansion of<br>the jazz idiom came in the form of odd meters.  They were also being<br>influenced by the Maharishi himself (with LP #1 having a particularly<br>striking oil painting of him on the back), and more than a certainty being<br>influenced by burning vegetation of an illegal nature (except for medicinal<br>purposes, of course).  <br><br>You probably don't need to check them out as microtonal resources, but if<br>you want a retro insight into the late 60's (when I believe these were<br>recorded) they are just the ticket.  Side Two of LP #1 is "Journey To Bliss:<br>A Meditation Suite in Six Movements".  Priceless stuff, I assure you.<br><br>Emil was turned on (hmmm...) to the Indian thing by Don Ellis, and for a<br>while they had a group called the Hindustani Jazz Sextet.  About that group,<br>I know nothing.  Maybe Daniel Wolf knows - seems like he was a California<br>boy back then...<br><br>Peace and love, flower-people!<br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br>*--------------------------------------------------------------------*<br>   Jonathan M.

Also, I often prefer <br>more dissonant chord voicings on guitar over more consonant ones, if the <br>musical context befits them. Of course, for a six-string chord, you have 15 <br>individual values for dissonance to add up.<br><br>Since you are comparing intervals to their inversions and not to <br>fundamentally different intervals, the results I posted for you were <br>perfectly useless to you. Fortunately, my theory tells you that the <br>certainty with which a tempered interval will be perceived as its most <br>likely just interpretation is proportional to the denominator of that just <br>interval (in lowest terms), and a factor, related to the degree of <br>mistuning, which will be the same for all inversions of an interval, and <br>thus ignorable for your purposes. So, interpreting this certainty as <br>consonance, we can say that the perfect twelfth is twice as consonant as the <br>perfect fifth and three times as consonant as the perfect fourth. The major <br>tenth is twice as consonant as the major third and 2.5 times as consonant as <br>the minor sixth. The major sixth is 1.666666667 times as consonant as the <br>minor third or minor tenth. However, the increased consonance of wider <br>intervals comes at the price of a thinner harmonic texture, which is not <br>always desireable.<br><br>For other intervals, the ratio-interpretation will vary according to <br>inversion; contact me privately for more details. Also, if I'm treating the <br>intervals as non-interacting and simply adding values for each interval in a <br>chord, I'd feel better about adding dissonance levels than adding consonance <br>levels.
