Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/1998 3:19:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>There seem to be two schools of thought about the melodic structure of<br>scales; one is based on tetrachords, the other on "maximal evenness".<br>Let's flesh out what they mean for some common scales.<br><br>First, let's consider the modes of the major scale. All of them are<br>maximally even in 12-, 19- or 26-tone equal temperament; that is, there<br>is no way to more closely approximate a 7-tone equal-tempered scale in<br>these tunings than the major scale and its modes. Now look at the modes<br>themselves:<br><br>(C D E F) (G A B C)<br>(D E F G) (A B C D)<br>(E F G A) (B C D E)<br>F (G A B (C) D E F)<br>(G A B (C) D E F) G or G (A B C (D) E F G)<br>A (B C D (E) F G A) or (A B C (D) E F G) A<br>(B C D (E) F G A) B<br><br>Each octave species contains two identical tetrachords, shown in<br>parentheses. In the first three modes, the tetrachords are disjunct, and<br>in the last four, they are conjunct. So in the first three modes, any<br>melody played in one tetrachord can be repeated an approximate 3:2 away,<br>and in the last four, any melody played in one tetrachord can be played<br>an approximate 4:3 away.<br><br>Why is this important? Well, one theory is that the minor third was the<br>first melodic interval ever used, and the most primitive melodies had<br>only two notes a minor third apart. See for yourself how easy it is to<br>sing just about any text in such a melody, and how common it is in<br>popular sing-song. Later, a third note was added, a whole-tone away so<br>that the outer two notes formed a perfect fourth, the 4:3 ratio. This<br>interval is a simple enough ratio so that even without harmony, had some<br>sort of pretonal strength to it. This three-note scale, or "trichord"<br>was then repeated either starting on the last note of the previous<br>trichord, or a whole-tone higher such that the last note of the second<br>trichord was an octave, or 2:1 ratio, away from the first note of the<br>first trichord. Thus were formed all the modes of the pentatonic scale:<br><br>(C D F) (G A C)<br>(D F G) (A C D)<br>F (G A (C) D F)<br>(G A (C) D F) G or G (A C (D) F G)<br>(A C (D) F G) A<br><br>(These are maximally even pentatonic scales in 7- or 12-tone equal<br>temperaments).<br><br>Then the minor thirds were filled in. In the West, the minor thirds were<br>divided into a whole tone (already familiar) and a half tone (new).<br>Ordering these two intervals the same way in both trichords leads to two<br>identical tetrachords, thus the modes of the major scale above.<br><br>In the Arabic world, the minor thirds were often divided instead into<br>two equal parts, 3/4-tones which were not familiar from the trichords.<br>This led to the following scales (+ means quarter-tone sharp, - means<br>quarter-tone flat):<br><br>(C D E- F) (G A B- C)<br>(D E- F G) (A B- C D)<br>F (G A B- (C) D E- F)<br>(G A B- (C) D E- F) G or G (A B- C (D) E- F G)<br>(A B- C (D) E- F G) A<br><br>Also appearing was a scale, Mohajira, which put the 3/4-tones at<br>opposite ends of the tetrachords and the whole-tone in the middle:<br><br>(E- F G A-) (B- C D E-)<br><br>(This is a maximally even heptatonic scale in 17-, 24-, or 31-tone equal<br>temperament).<br><br>Many scales in the East may have been formed by halving the whole tones,<br>rather than the minor thirds, in each trichord. Though a clear violation<br>of the maximal evenness principle, some of the resulting scales are<br>found outside the West:<br><br>(C C# D F) (G G# A C)<br>(D F F# G) (A C C# D)<br>F (G G# A (C) C# D F)<br>(G G# A (C) C# D F) G<br>G (A C C# (D) F F# G)<br>(A C C# (D) F F# G) A<br><br>Also appearing was a scale (Major Gypsy or Persian) which put the<br>half-tones at opposite ends of the tetrachords and the minor third in<br>the middle:<br><br>(C# D F F#) (G# A C C#)<br><br>In India, musicians may have had a very high sensitivity to intonation,<br>which forced them to distinguish two types of whole tones. Tuning the<br>original minor third to 6:5, the whole tone completing the 4:3 would<br>have to be 10:9, while the one that, along with the two 4:3s, completed<br>the 2:1, would have to be a 9:8. They appear to have reckoned the former<br>as 3 srutis, the latter as 4 srutis, and the minor third as 6 srutis,<br>making a 22-sruti octave. There seems to have been an early attempt at<br>dividing the minor third into two equal parts, resulting in a scale<br>known as Gandhaara grama, which did not survive the ancient period and<br>whose true nature is shrouded in mystery. More successful were the<br>Western-type approach of dividing the minor third into a half-tone (2<br>srutis) and a whole-tone (4 srutis). When the two minor thirds were<br>divided the same way, the resulting "diatonic" scales could have the<br>following sequences of intervals:<br><br>(3 2 4) (3 2 4) 4<br>(3 4 2) (3 4 2) 4<br>(4 2 3) (4 2 3) 4<br>(4 3 2) (4 3 2) 4<br>(3 2 4) 4 (3 2 4)<br>(3 4 2) 4 (3 4 2)<br>(4 2 3) 4 (4 2 3)<br>(4 3 2) 4 (4 3 2)<br>4 (3 2 4) (3 2 4)<br>4 (3 4 2) (3 4 2)<br>4 (4 2 3) (4 2 3)<br>4 (4 3 2) (4 3 2)<br><br>There are four distinct scale types here, each represented by three<br>modes. The four scale types are the ones that appear to have been most<br>important in a period in Indian music history, according to a paper by<br>Lewis Rowell, John Clough, and others. They show that these scales can<br>be singled out from all 7-out-of-22 scales by demanding two properties.<br>One is that there be only one tritone (half-octave interval). The other<br>is a sort of second-order maximal evenness involving the numbers 7, 12,<br>and 22. I pointed out to John Clough that a different but equally simple<br>definition of second-order maximal evenness allows one to obtain the<br>four scale types without the additional tritone rule. However, I did not<br>make a big deal out of it, since I believe the acoustical-tetrachordal<br>derivation to be more relevant.<br><br>In modern Indian scales the two minor thirds were, however, not always<br>divided with the intervals in the same order. Also the Eastern-type<br>approaches of dividing the whole-tone are used in India. Finally, even<br>the scales above each have only three octave species with identical<br>tetrachords. Probably, the majority of Indian scales cannot be<br>considered to have two identical tetrachords.<br><br>If you read my paper on decatonic scales in 22-tone equal temperament,<br>you will see that one version of the scale has the property that all its<br>octave species contain two identical pentachords, either conjunct or<br>disjunct, while another version is maximally even. The pentachordal<br>scale can be derived from the Indian scales above by treating the 22<br>srutis as equal and dividing all 4-sruti intervals in half. As far as<br>melodic appeal goes, I think the tetrachord (trichord, pentachord)<br>concept wins, as evidenced by comparing the two scales played<br>melodically. However, the maximally even scale contains 8 consonant<br>tetrads to the pentachordal scale's 6. Another case of melody and<br>harmony being at odds for scale construction (something Ivor Darreg<br>liked to point out).</div>
