I<br>have a few more comments. First, when I say "Bach," I am actually using<br>his name as a representation of that general period in Western music...I<br>don't just mean him, per se. There were tons of musicians back then. It<br>also seems that tunings were in a much less settled state at that time<br>than they are now, with well temperaments, meantone, equal temps, and<br>most likely others, all vieing for attention, and musicians trying to<br>decide which tunings were appropriate for what situation.<br>   For example, when Bach jammed with the great lutenist, Sylvius Leopold<br>Weiss, did they use equal temps while they played? How were lutes fretted<br>back then? Bach liked the lute sound so much that he had a clavier built<br>that sounded like a lute. Also, when Bach arranged the 5th cello sonata,<br>and the 3rd violin partita for lute, was he using equal temps? When he<br>wrote flute sonatas, what tuning were the flutists using? How about his<br>gigantic works, like the St. Matthew Passion? Well tempered, or equal? Do<br>we know, or are we guessing (however intelligent our guesses)? We also<br>know that Handel had a keyboard with, I believe, 16 tones/octave...was<br>this a common practice then? Did Handel use 16 tones/octave extensively?<br>    These are all valid questions, to me, and they only open the door to<br>many more questions about historical tuning practice...it is a<br>fascinating subject, to be sure.<br>    Mself, I believe that Bach, and most likely many others, used various<br>tunings, depending on the context of the piece, and the instrumentation.<br>Bach was nothing if not very practical, so to think that he would switch<br>between systems is not too farfetched. As to what he would have ideally<br>preferred, are there any writings on this subject? If so, I would very<br>much like to study them....It is, again, a fascinating subject...Hstick<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
