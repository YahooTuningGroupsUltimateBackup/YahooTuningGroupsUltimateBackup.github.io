That is, a scale could be proper without having a<br>1:1 >relationship between its consonances and scale steps?<br><br>But I don't think Paul E. meant 1:1 relationship.  I think he meant that<br>any consonance would always subtend the same number of scales steps, but<br>not necessarily that this number of scales steps couldn't represent a<br>dissonance, or another consonance.  But it still doesn't change the fact<br>that propriety says nothing about connsonance or dissonance - it only<br>addresses the relative sizes of intervals associated with scale steps.  And<br>so a given scale could be proper and not meet Paul's criteria; the<br>consonance in question could be an ambiguous interval.<br><br>But all in all, a small point.<br><br>Carl</div>
