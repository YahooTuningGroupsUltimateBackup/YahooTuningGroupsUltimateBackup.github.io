Let me be more clear about what I<br>was trying to say by providing a simple example:<br><br>Suppose you want to create a function that takes the integers 1, 2, and three<br>as inputs and gives 5, 7, and 11 and outputs.  Unless my spreadsheet has lead<br>me totally astray, two simple examples of such functions are f1(n)=n*n-7n+1<br>and f2(n)=6/x-x+5.  I could provide you with as many more as you would like.<br><br>Now to guess what you might be trying to say:<br><br>If you analyze a series of integers using some particular method you will get<br>a particular generating function.<br><br>I got my distaste for this kind of phraseology from sweating over those<br>Junior High School tests that require you to provide the next number in a<br>series.  Later, I came to realize that there are an infinite number of ways<br>to analyze any particular set of data, and that this "teaching method" has<br>more to do with helping the teacher to maintain control of the class than a<br>real study of methods of analysis, as does much of what is taught in schools.<br><br>When it comes to analyzing data, I have found it better not to be so<br>monoTHEsistic.<br><br>Marion<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 27 Jul 1996 08:32 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id XAA15974; Fri, 26 Jul 1996 23:32:14 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 26 Jul 1996 23:32:14 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199607270631.AAA04816@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3325 href="#3325">ðŸ”—</a>bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G.

And rightfully so...<br>Jon Szanto's comment to me in the last digest about respecting a<br>person's wishes as to how they want their music performed, referring<br>to Partch, was OK by me...but, again, I must state that music, once <br>brought into the physical world, belongs to no one (except in a legal<br>sense, to prevent them from getting ripped off)...since I did not know<br>Partch, I am at somewhat of a disadvantage here...but, I see no sensible<br>reason why his music should not be performed by whoever wants to, on<br>whatever instruments they want to use. Of course, one should respect<br>another's wishes...however, I think being selfish with one's art is<br>unacceptable on a deep level...sorry...Hstick<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 27 Jul 1996 19:23 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id KAA21195; Sat, 27 Jul 1996 10:23:18 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 27 Jul 1996 10:23:18 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199607271721.LAA18998@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
