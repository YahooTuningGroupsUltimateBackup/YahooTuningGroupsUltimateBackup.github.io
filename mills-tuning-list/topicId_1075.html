This means 12, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, ...<br>>and certainly both 19 and 22 qualify [. . .] I think that melodically, from <br>what I've said, assuming >that most tunes consist of sequences from the <br>diatonic scale up or down for large portions of >their scope, 19, 12, or 22 <br>will sound all about the same.<br><br>In 22, you can only get a resonable-sounding diatonic scale with three <br>different-sized steps, and one scale degree has to be "mutable" to <br>accomodate the syntonic comma. A 5x + 2y scale in 22 will sound WAY off <br>(although beautiful in its own right). Bruce, I don't think you thought this <br>through.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 30 Oct 1996 18:01 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04396; Wed, 30 Oct 1996 18:02:12 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA30850<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA17854; Wed, 30 Oct 1996 09:02:10 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 30 Oct 1996 09:02:10 -0800<br>Message-Id: <40961030170104/0005695065PK5EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
