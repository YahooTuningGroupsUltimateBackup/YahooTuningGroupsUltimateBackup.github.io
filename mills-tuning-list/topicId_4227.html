The acoustical<br>> nature of simple intervals is a much stronger organizing force in music<br>> (at least the music I enjoy) than abstract set and group constructs.<br>> Harry Partch devoted his life to exploring microtonality and the results<br>> he puts forward are not to be taken lightly. For the most part, he is in<br>> agreement with a millenia-old tradition of musician/mathematicians for<br>> whom the acoustical "pull" of simple ratios is undeniable. At present,<br>> at least three distinct psychoacoustical phenomena have been identified<br>> which contribute to this impression, and octave equivalence is a fourth<br>> factor which Balzano happily accepts while rejecting the others. Partch<br>> has shown that music with a simple-ratio basis need not be<br>> backward-looking, but can be as exciting and unexpected as any 20th<br>> century music. It is heartening that most on this list seem to<br>> understand that there is a relationship between frequency ratios and<br>> consonance and are not content to choose frequencies just because their<br>> logarithms make pretty necklace-like patterns (although that can be<br>> important too).<br><br>First of all, Paul, although I disagree with you on what I consider to be<br>minor points -- congratulations (-- no trick -- I'm not being cynical --<br>I'm serious, and you'll see why in a moment.) <br><br>You may be missing the point I was trying to make.  I'm well aware of the<br>fact that you like to work with tetras and pentas -- and, while I am<br>attempting to challenge the list in a colleagial way, I'm not trying to<br>pick a fight with you or anyone.  I chose your particular post to use as a<br>POSITIVE example because it presents systems with more than a few fruitful<br>possibilities (a point I think you were making as well -- and it shouldn't<br>be lost). <br><br>As far as the "Balzano/Clough/Douthett approach to scales" being "bunk," I<br>more than disagree, but NOT because I think B/C/D are right and you are<br>wrong. Rather, after reading your approach, I can't find any DEEP<br>incompatabilities between you and B/C/D, beyond the fact that C & D use<br>the term "maximally even" in an understandably more restricted (pitch<br>class) sense than you do.  But I sympathize with your approach as<br>well (at least up to, but not including, your tuning demands) in that I<br>consider an interval string such as, say, <1131113> to have important<br>*intervallically* "maximally even"  properties.  By C & D's definition,<br>this string would not be ME, but I know for a fact that that does not<br>imply that C & D would not consider it an interesting string.  In my<br>opinion, it seems that the whole argument you have with their approach<br>(beside the tuning aspects) boils down to the fact that yours is an<br>intervallic approach and theirs is a pitch-class approach.  And whether<br>pc-set theory or ic-set theory, set theory is set theory, so whether or<br>not you realize it, you're already heavily into set theory. <br><br>If you want to take the time, you can check out my "White Note Fantasy --<br>Part I" in Music Theory Online 4.3 which, among other things, shows why<br>strings like <1131113>, <9949994>, <3323332>, etc., including the "usual<br>(maligned)  diatonic"  <2212221>, share some important invariant<br>properties since they can all be derived from the same generic (identity)<br>interval string. This is to say that all of these strings (scales) are<br>simply versions of the same "complex string" <xxyxxxy> which itself is a<br>version of the string <XyX'y>.  The 22@41 scale you described, beside its<br>individual properties, is simply a version of <XyXyX'y>.  Not only is it<br>an interesting structure for the reasons you discuss (and those I hinted<br>at and many more), but it should also be investigated in its simpler forms<br>to see what interesting invariant features can be spotted and used in<br>the more complex version.  AND it suggests other transformations -- but only<br>if we are willing to bracket tuning considerations while we thoroughly<br>investigate the geometry (set theory).  So unless Paul objects, in the<br>future when I describe these tri-fold hyperdiatonic structures (resulting<br>from a modified cloning transformation), I'll call them "Erlich strings." <br><br>Then...<br><br>> Joe Monzo wrote, > > >I found this article while snooping around > >on<br>the web.
