The discussion about ji this or eq that is <br>rather academic, I feel, with little substance at this point. I certainly <br>agree that pure tunings are part of the Universal structure, and to be in <br>harmony with the Universe is the most worthy goal of life...however, if <br>you like music with chord changes, as I do, you gotta use some sort of <br>eq...at least, as far as I know, you do. So, we sacrifice the pureness <br>that comes with modal oriented music, and at what cost, I know not. But, <br>I love jazz, Bach, Bartok, Debussy, and lots of other music that <br>modulates...what's a feller to do? And, I do indeed love modal music as <br>well, and am studying like crazy to understand the mysteries of the <br>harmonic series better. Theoretically, on a fretless instrument, one <br>could play absolutely every note purely, in any key...can this be done in <br>reality? I don't know...to play "Donna Lee" by Charley Parker on a <br>fretless axe, with every note perfectly aligned with a natural ratio, <br>would be tough, indeed...perhaps possible, though.<br>    Rather than engage in fruitless speculation about eq versus ji (which <br>for me is a non issue), or which eq is better than that one, we should <br>look at different issues, such as: which tuning will bebop sound best in? <br>How about bluegrass, or reggae, or Celtic folk music? Which tuning best <br>expresses what the Bedouins of Arabia feel? How about a guy in Argentina, <br>singing about how lonely he is...what tuning works best for him? What <br>about a European (say, German) keyboard player, who hears music with 4 or <br>5 voices...what tuning should he play in? What if a composer wants to <br>write about the death of his wife, whom he dearly loved...which tuning <br>system best expresses such feelings? <br>    My point is simple...I am interested in music and composing, and I am <br>concerned about how to 1. say something meaningful and profound 2. learn <br>to play the shit out of my instrument, because the better my proficiency, <br>the deeper my expressive powers, plus I enjoy the challenge of trying to <br>"master" the guitar, which is an impossible task, but a worthy goal for <br>this life. The discussion of tunings without a corresponding body of <br>music to supplement it is quite boring, I'm afraid, and I increasingly <br>see this forum heading in exactly that direction. In fact, I know several <br>people who are losing interest in the forum for exactly this reason. Of <br>course, that's neither here or there, and the minds I encounter on my <br>computer are quite stimulating at times. Again, however, I find the <br>amount of great music, or virtuoso players (and that is indeed a <br>deceptive word, I know, but I am making a point) connected with alternate <br>tunings to be quite small, as opposed to the endless theorizing about <br>this or that tuning, or which one is "better". Yikes, guys...let's make <br>some monster music that touches people in their hearts, that makes the <br>world a better place to be, that fights injustice, that changes people's <br>consciousness for the better. Use a tuning that fits your musical needs, <br>that allows you to say the things you need to say. And, learn to play <br>your instruments and compose on a level that's much deeper than most of <br>the microdoodling that I've heard up to this point. Practice and <br>study...that's what it takes. We don't need to hear someone demonstrate <br>how cool a "just" scale sounds on a cheesy sounding synth; we need <br>masterful compositions, with skillful playing. Are we gonna get it? I <br>sure hope so. Because if we don't, the world at large is just going to <br>view us as a sort of quirky, fringe group, talking about vague subjects <br>that have little meaning to anyone's real life...and, that's a shame, <br>because there is such potential to use other tuning systems to change <br>music for the better...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 15 May 1997 09:24 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02368; Thu, 15 May 1997 09:24:32 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 15 May 1997 09:24:32 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02366<br>Received: (qmail 25956 invoked from network); 15 May 1997 07:24:28 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 15 May 1997 07:24:28 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199705150719.JAA15071@reliam.teaser.fr><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
