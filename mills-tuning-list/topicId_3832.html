I never realized that tuning <br>     could be such a technical issue.<br>     <br>     Does anyone have any experience using the Pitch Palette with <br>     microtunable synths? I downloaded Roland's Virtual Sound Canvass and <br>     was impressed with it.<br>     <br>     I'm learning this west African instrument called the balafon (type of <br>     marimba). My teacher is a master balafonist from Guinea. I've been <br>     introducing him to MIDI technology as a tool he can used to test out <br>     some of his arrangements/compositions. He really loves it.<br>     <br>     As you might have guessed tuning is a problem. He can't play his <br>     instrument with his MIDI arrangements, since the balafon tuning can't <br>     be adjusted. <br>     <br>     <br>     It seems like the Pitch Palette microtuning software from Justonic is <br>     what I need, since it can retune the Virtual Sound Canvass to the <br>     tuning of the balafon. Can this be done?<br>     <br>     I eventually plan to purchase the Mallet controller which is a <br>     xylophone midi controller. This will allow my teacher to be more <br>     creative in his arrangements since this is his instrument.<br>     <br>     Comments recommendations?<br>     <br>     Thanks<br>     <br>     JL</div>
