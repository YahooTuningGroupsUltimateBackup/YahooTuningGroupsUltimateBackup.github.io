Instead of 10-equal, use a tuning with a <br>372-cent major third and a 720-cent perfect fifth. John Chalmers would see <br>this as just as good as 15-equal. The minor third of 348 cents is 32 cents <br>off just, so I would rate this tuning as much worse than 15-equal, where the <br>minor third is only 4 cents off. Listen to some major and minor triads in <br>both tunings and see who is right.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 4 Mar 1997 18:32 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05902; Tue, 4 Mar 1997 18:32:30 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05952<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id JAA28814; Tue, 4 Mar 1997 09:30:21 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 4 Mar 1997 09:30:21 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v03101802af420a0d0d4a@[128.114.128.121]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
