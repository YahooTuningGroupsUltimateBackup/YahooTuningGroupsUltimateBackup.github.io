I'm currently contemplating a chamber piece with retuned harpsichord <br>in just intonation. Does anyone have any experience or suggestions?<br>Any just harpsichord CDs available? (I'm planning on tuning the two <br>manuals differently, for 24 total pitches - haven't settled on the <br>tuning yet.) I know of one - a disc of Scelsi and Zender on cpo which<br>includes a chamber cantata by Zender with just hpscd. Unfortunately, it <br>was stolen (!) so I don't have morte info.<br><br>2.) A CD came out a few years ago of Charles Koechlin's horn music<br>played by Barry Tuckwell. It includes a number of implicitly 13-limit<br>pieces for multiple natural horns - quite a surprise when I first <br>bought it! Has anyone tried writing for multiple natural horns in <br>different keys?<br><br>3.) I've made simple PVC notch flutes in the 8-10-foot-long-range. I can <br>get to the 23rd or 24th harmonic fairly easily, but have some problems <br>with response and agility. Any feedback regarding notch<br>design, material, etc.? <br><br>______________________________________________________<br>Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com</div>
