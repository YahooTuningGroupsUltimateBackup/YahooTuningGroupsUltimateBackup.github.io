Does it always sound<br>against Bb and never against C?<br><br>>    I was curious whether this scale corresponded to one in any other <br>> culture or historical period, that anybody knew of. Thanks.<br><br>The major pentatonic scale (with various tones as the root) comes up in<br>so many different situations I don't know if there'd be any point in<br>naming them all.  It would be a big effort to try, although I wouldn't<br>be surprised if Manuel Op de Coul didn't already have them all in a list<br>or database somewhere.<br><br>--pH <manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu> http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote<br>    O<br>   /\        "Churchill?
