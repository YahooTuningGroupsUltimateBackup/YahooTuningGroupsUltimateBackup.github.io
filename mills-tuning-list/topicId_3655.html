It has a Master Tuning <br>preference. I don't know the exact details in terms of whether pitches <br>can be specified as frequencies and/or in cents, how many tones per <br>octave are allowed, or what the tuning resolution is, but I've e-mailed <br>the company and the person who told me about it, and will post any <br>further info when I get it.<br><br>   There is also a free demo of the program (which DOESN'T contain the <br>re-tunability feature) available for download, for anybody who would <br>like to check out the more general features of the synthesis and <br>sequencing aspects of the program.<br><br>   This looks like an entry-level product that the alternate tuning <br>community can really get behind, so please try it out, if you get a <br>chance.<br><br>   VAZ+ requires either Windows 95 or NT. This is because 32bit <br>performance was essential for the program. On a 486/66 PC playback at <br>22kHz is possible. A Pentium system will easily manage 44kHz. The <br>program defaults to a conservative 11kHz settings when first run.<br><br>   Full details and screen shots of the synthesis and sequencing windows <br>are available at:<br><br><br>   http://www.software-technology.com/info/softech/vaz.htm<br><br><br><br>   Bill Flavell<br><br><br><br>______________________________________________________<br>Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com</div>
