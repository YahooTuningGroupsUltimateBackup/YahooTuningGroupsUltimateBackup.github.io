If you<br>need more specific information, email Rex Wyler at rex@justonic.com.<br><br>I must say I've had a far more positive experience surfing the<br>WEB than Brian has, but then I wasn't looking specifically for<br>"Microtonality Made Simple". Altavista has worked the best for<br>me, but it is necessary to take some thought as to what phrase(s)<br>or word(s) to search for and to use quotes, capitals, and/or semicolons<br>to limit the range, else one will get the union and not the<br>intersection of the topics.<br><br>The simplest strategy may be to use URL's from the Tuning List and<br>follow the links.<br><br>A minor correction to my last post: The venue of the SAG's December 7th<br>concert is called the Spruce Street Forum, 301 Spruce Street, <br>San Diego, CA 92103 (619) 295-0301. The director is Bonnie Wright.  <br>The SSF shares space with the Porter Troupe Gallery which specializes <br>in contemporary African-American art and artists. <br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 14 Nov 1996 00:04 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05465; Thu, 14 Nov 1996 00:05:21 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05397<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id PAA24096; Wed, 13 Nov 1996 15:05:18 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 13 Nov 1996 15:05:18 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01510101aeaf913e97d5@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
