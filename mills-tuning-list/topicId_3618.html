A 1/5Hz<br>>beat is pretty darned slow.  You'd have to have some very high harmonics on<br>>some very long, sustained tones to be able to hear that.<br><br>So,the MR series resolution is good enough that one might, in all <br>probability ,never wish for more ?<br><br>BTW,please ignore that rubbish in that post about "psychoacoustic efx" <br>blah-blah.Just thinking aloud.Could've kicked myself for forgetting to <br>delete it from the message.<br><br>Also there is another alternative: MSP,the real-time synthesis software <br>that works on top of Max.<br>It uses Hertz.<www.cycling74.com> Also distributed by IRCAM.<br><br>John (Loffink),thanks for the Yamaha FM info,but drat..... <br>And you should get MSP onto you website.<br><br>-Drew</div>
