Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/1997 1:33:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>}Also, regarding Gregg Gibson's assertion that the octave should be<br>stretched<br>}a few cents, wouldn't this be a problem for guitar players (and steel<br>}guitarists) who are accustomed to sounding harmonics to get an octave<br>above<br>}the note they are fingering (or barring)?<br><br>Guitarists commonly sound the 5th harmonic, even though it is 13.7 cents<br>off 12TET. The 2nd harmonic being 2.7 cents off will not be a problem.<br><br>}I also suspect that there would<br>}be a lot of beats happening around double- and triple-octave pairs.  If<br>the<br>}bass player plays an A, and my A three octaves higher adds 10 cents to<br>the<br>}equation, I wouldn't expect it to sound good.<br><br>An 8:1 off by 10 cents would be no worse than a 5:1 off by 14 cents, and<br>we accept the latter. Certainly a 7:1 off by 31 cents is much worse, and<br>yet the harmonic seventh has been used as a consonance even in 12TET.<br>Gamelan orchestras purposely detune octaves by far more than 2.7 cents;<br>although their instruments have inharmonic partials, they can tune pure<br>octaves using second-order beating and difference tones, and yet they<br>choose highly distorted (usually stretched) octaves. They even tune<br>their unisons so that they produce beating.<br><br>Beating is not the same as dissonance. Beating occurs when two pure<br>tones are so close in pitch that they are perceived as one tone of<br>changing amplitude. Roughness, one contributor to dissonance, occurs<br>when the two pure tones are partially resolved from one another but are<br>less than the critical bandwidth apart. Beating may be incidental to<br>roughness, but changes in amplitude are not what constitutes dissonance<br>(or else we would consider a tremolo effect dissonant).<br><br>For an interval in perfect just intontation, whatever phase difference<br>was present at the beginning of the sound would persist for the duration<br>of the sound. Let's say two instruments are producing tones, both of<br>which have an equally loud partial at 1000Hz. For someone standing in a<br>particular location with respect to the two instruments, there is some<br>delay time between the beginning times of the two instruments for which<br>the 1000Hz components will interefere constructively, resulting in four<br>times the energy at that frequency than what one instrument alone would<br>produce. For a delay time just 1/2000 of a second longer, you get<br>destructive interference, or no energy at that frequency. Obviously no<br>human instrumentalist can control their onset time to within 1/2000 of a<br>second relative to the onset time of another instrument. So you end up<br>with a random number between zero and four to describe the energy of the<br>1000Hz component -- probably not the musical effect you were looking<br>for. Even an individual performer playing both instruments can't do it<br>-- try tuning two synth keys to the same note and notice how repeatedly<br>playing both keys "simultaneously" leads to random fluctuations in the<br>loudness.<br><br>Now if the onset times are controlled really accurately by MIDI, and<br>let's say a 90-degree phase shift is chosen so that the energy at 1000Hz<br>is twice that from one instrument, then you're doing okay, right? But<br>for someone standing in a different location in the room, though, the<br>differece in the path lengths from the two instruments, and thus the<br>phase, will be different. There are nodes of destructive interference<br>and antinodes of constructive interference in the room no matter what<br>the original phase shift was. So some members of the audience may be<br>receiving no energy at 1000Hz, while others may be receiving four times<br>what they would from one instrument. Again, probably not the effect you<br>were looking for.<br><br>If both instruments are electronic, and their signals are mixed into one<br>speaker, there will be no spatial nodes or antinodes. So finally you can<br>control the musical effect. But other than monophonic electronic<br>MIDI-sequenced music, perfect JI can lead to big problems. In the real<br>world, thankfully, acoustic instruments are slightly out-of-tune with<br>each other, so that whatever the onset delay and whatever the position<br>in the room, one gets a signal that frequencies common to both tones<br>have an average energy twice that of one instrument. There will not be<br>noticeable, let alone startling, differences in the musical effect<br>depending on minute variations in the onset delay or position in the<br>room.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Brian M.
