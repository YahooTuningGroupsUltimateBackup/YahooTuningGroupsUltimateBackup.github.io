He has<br>been traveling all over the country  with his theremins.  ( I got one,  it is<br>the ultimate "air" machine). <br>   And for the possible "thereminists-to-be-maybe-if-I-find-one-more-reason-<br>to-get-one" out there,  when it comes time for the amp, I strongly recommend<br>that you get one with not only reverb, but also chorus effect.   The really<br>clean, dry, theremin sound is strong, but extremely difficult to do without a<br>lot of woodsheddin'.  It is surprising how fast things get rusty when your<br>chops are waving.    <br>    The instrument really comes alive with some phase activity going on.  I<br>suppose this effect may share some psycho-affective territory within which<br>tempering operates.  Speaking of tempering...........<br>    The historical temperament crusade added another head (University piano<br>department) to the converted.  After a weekend of Young, Beethoven, and<br>Steinway, Dr. Reed, at Lipscomb University, called me late Sunday, saying he<br>was a changed man!   This was his first exposure to Well Tempering, and two<br>days later, he played his Sabbatical recital( a biggie),  on a temperament he<br>didn't know existed a week before.   <br>      Someone tell McClaren that another pebble has fallen off the "ET<br>monolith".  <br>Regards to all, <br>Ed Foote <br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn.<br>The CD liner notes from "Beethoven In The Temperaments" are now on a web page<br>http://www.airtime.co.uk/forte/history/edfoote.html</div>
