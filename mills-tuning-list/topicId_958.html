From Pauls definition, a /4:/5:/6 minor triad, lacking a<br>power of two in the lowest voice, is less _stable_ than a Major 4:5:6.<br>However, when placed in a progression, it may very well have the opposite<br>reading. For example, if the tonic key is established as minor, than the<br>Major dominant triad will _resolve_ to the tonic minor triad. Of course the<br>root motion of the downward fifth (or upward fourth) is a strongly defining<br>feature, but this ordering of chord qualities is well established in the<br>_common practice_ repertoire (or else we would find more mixolydian<br>cadences).  In this case, key identity, spacing, and voice leading from one<br>chord to the next are equally or more determinant of _stability_ than<br>rootedness. Further, all of these determinants seem  largely to be examples<br>more of conditioning rather than of psychoacoustic properties. (The<br>existence of alternative practices in other repertoires (eg _modal_<br>progressions in pop musics) both confirms the locality of the conditioning<br>described above, and the varieties of progressions encountered in these<br>repertoires suggest the inapplicabilty of a _stability_ concept outside of<br>narrowly defined diachronic contexts). <br><br>(2) On the other hand, _stability_, in a musical context without<br>repertoire-defined harmonic progression may be achieved by means of<br>extended durations or by reiterations. In this case, the conditioning is<br>taking place in real time (Pavlov meets Stravinskys _assertion_ of<br>tonality), and the examples of this that I find immediately suggest that<br>lowest voice, 2^n roots are not a prerequisite to achieving stability.<br><br>(3) Back to sine waves. The argument that Paul used against my sine wave<br>subharmonics can be turned around and applied to regular harmonic-spectra<br>harmonic pitch complexes, where the reinforcement of a single series will<br>create masking so that individual pitches will be difficult if not<br>impossible to discern. (This was my initial rationale for the _sine wave<br>orchestra_; long experience with synthesized sound and precise tuning had<br>convinced me that the situation has to be simplified in order to get any<br>useful results at all).<br><br>(4) The intuitionist (like an algorithm maker, or a student of musical<br>cognition) proceeds in strictly chronological steps. If from the unity 1:1,<br>the twoity is observed, and from the sum of 1+1, 2 is constructed, yielding<br>the first harmonic interval, only then may the first subharmonic (the<br>inversion) be constructed. In constructing the series, the subharmonic will<br>always lag behind. Of course, another fundamental approach will have all<br>intervals appear simultaneously, but I am lost in trying to figure out how<br>that is described cognitively.<br><br>(5) I never said that mathematics goes funny at the infinitesimal, I made<br>the observation that the calculation in this direction is counterintuitive,<br>and I speculated about why it should be so. Your examples of string lengths<br>etc. I found curious, as the (pre-wave length) music theory using this<br>instrumentality was inversionally flexible in the extreme, and ran counter<br>to Pauls strong harmonic series approach. (Needless to say, classical<br>harmonics was used to describe a repertoire without chords). There is<br>indeed a (mathematical and physical) boundary problem for the infinitesimal<br>(with null or the vacuum) that the infinite does not have.<br><br>Daniel Wolf <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 2 Oct 1996 17:57 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04020; Wed, 2 Oct 1996 16:57:48 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04011<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA00832; Wed, 2 Oct 1996 08:57:41 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 2 Oct 1996 08:57:41 -0700<br>Message-Id: <63961002154336/0005695065PK4EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3722 href="#3722">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/1996 4:43:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> My experience with non-octave scales (and <br>> I'm still playing with them) is that although you can set up functional <br>> harmonic relationships and weird but beautiful melodies without octaves, <br>> once you "modulate" far enough to use an interval which is a near-octave, <br>> that won't sound like a distant harmonic relationship but like an <br>> out-of-tune version of the same note.<br><br>   I absolutely agree with Paul here;  off-octaves (in 88CET at least) to my<br>ears really do sound like out-of-tune octaves rather than pitch relationships in<br>themselves.  Some have disagreed however.  <br><br>   In my 88CET demo tape I have an example of traditional harmonies as rendered<br>in 88CET.  The first ... six I think it was ... chords illustrate this<br>"wandering tonic" effect.  The progression I think was a typical I V ii V V7 I.<br>The trick is that the second I chord is written with the tonic in a different<br>octave from the first.  The effect I think is really wild and fascinating:  If<br>you're not paying much attention, it just sounds like a boring old chorale<br>fragment.  <br><br>   But if you listen more carefully (and only a little more carefully), you<br>notice that the tonic mysteriously migrated by about 1/41 octave.  All of our<br>musical experience since childhood tells us that we just went 360 degrees around<br>and landed where we started, but mysteriously we somehow landed somewhere else.<br><br><br>   Forgive me for pushing one of my proverbial hot-buttons, but some feel that<br>this wandering tonic effect is a problem to be dealt with, but to me it's a<br>really interesting, surprising, and useful musical effect.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 4 Oct 1996 15:38 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00589; Fri, 4 Oct 1996 14:39:42 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00587<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id GAA05589; Fri, 4 Oct 1996 06:39:38 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 4 Oct 1996 06:39:38 -0700<br>Message-Id: <961004092444.2042111a@emuvax.emich.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
