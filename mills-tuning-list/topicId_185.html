J. Ellis's <br>appendix to Helmholtz's On the Sensations of Tone in which he derives <br>56 tonal 7-tone "trichordal" modes in 5-limit JI by allowing the tonic, <br>dominant and subdominant triads to either major or minor and then <br>circularly permuting each scale (8 x 7 = 56). The concept goes back to <br>Rameau. What I did was to generalize the type of triad and apply the<br>idea to MOS and similar scales in ET as well. <br> <br>One is not limited to only 3 triads or to triads. Some scales are <br>best chorded with 5  triads, 4 tetrads, etc.<br> <br>Max Mathews, Linda Roberts and John R. Pierce have also experimented<br>with this kind of scale, especially those based on 3:5:7 and 5:7:9.<br>The Pierce-Bohlen scale in based on 3:5:7:9 triads mapped into the<br>13th root of 3/1 (This ET has also been proposed by Enrique Moreno).<br>Unfortunately, none of their published papers actually give the<br>ratios or notes of the 4 scales they discovered. Does anyone have<br>the M357a, M357b (the P-B scale in JI?), M579 and P3579a scales? <br> <br>JI: One of the major themes of Brian's recent posts on psychoacoustics<br>was that subjects tested in the laboratory prefer sharp to JI intervals.<br>While there is considerable data supporting this idea for single voice <br>melodic intervals, it is not necessarily true for intervals in chords. <br>Roberts and Mathews (1984) found that for the middle tone of various <br>triads (major, minor,  5:7:9 and 3:5:7) some listeners preferred JI and <br>some preferred intervals either sharp or flat by about 15 cents. <br>Preference correlated with musical experience, violinists, cellists and tympanists preferred JI, untrained musicians, singers and pianists <br>preferred the "rich" non-JI intonation. In these experiments the outer <br>tones were tuned pure and the inner tones varied. In the case of minor <br>triads, the "rich" intonationists preferred the flat 300 cent interval <br>to the JI value. <br> <br>Similar results were obtained for chords in I IV I progressions.<br>The roots of the triads were 262 hz. In the case of the progressions,<br>the subdominant was taken from a major or natural minor scale on <br>262 hz. The 3:5:7 and 5:7:9 progressions appear to be taken from the corresponding tritriadics, but I have not been able to verify this<br>yet.<br> <br>The point is that while musical experience has a strong effect<br>on preference, though how one separates musical experience clearly<br>from musical talent has never been clear to me, some listeners not <br>only prefer JI for major and minor chords, they also do so for 7-limit<br>chords as well. Secondly, while some listeners prefer sharp<br>intervals, others prefer flat ones or have no preference for the<br>direction of mistuning. They just like beats. These data imply that <br>JI has a distinct "mood" which many, but not all, listeners prefer.<br> <br>The principal reference is Linda A. Roberts and Max V.Mathews. 1984.<br>Intonation Sensitivity for traditional and nontraditional chords.<br>J Acoust. Soc.

The 5th<br>harmonic is way sharp and it misses some really neat harmonics - 7, 11, and 13<br>for example.  It does, however, provide a fairly EFFICIENT mapping to the<br>harmonics it does match - matching the first 5 harmonics reasonably well on as a<br>coarse resolution as 100 cents, is in my view an impressive feat.  <br><br>   Buuuut, that's not the central focus of your question.  In response to your<br>question, I suppose it's worth pointing out that Brian is speaking about a<br>classification of tunings that ... well, I was starting to say "intentionally<br>avoid" harmonic relationships, but I suspect it would be more appropriate to<br>say, "make no effort to match" harmonic relationships.  <br><br>   I'm still catching up on Brian's NJNET posts, so I'm not certain of the<br>context behind his allusion to different vibrational modes.  Buuuut, everything<br>I've read of those posts so far suggest that they are based upon abstract<br>mathematical formulations (other than those of JI and ET), and not upon "found"<br>pitch relationships, by which I mean pitch relationships found in natural<br>vibrational systems.  <br><br>   That is unless of course he's found a NJNET mathematical formulation for the<br>vibrational modes of spheres or whatever.  I kind of doubt if those vibrational<br>modes are predictable by formulations like the inharmonic series formulations<br>he's mentioned (such logs of factorials).  <br><br>   So I kinda doubt if vibrational modes of physical structures other than<br>strings is his main point really.  Unfortunately, since I haven't gotten that<br>far yet, I'm not much good for commenting on what he was speaking of there.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 16 Nov 1995 08:30 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA25062; Wed, 15 Nov 1995 22:30:00 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 22:30:00 -0800<br>Message-Id: <951116062526_71670.2576_HHB31-4@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
