True, none of them have mathematically exact<br>integer multiple partials, but bells are many many times further from<br>harmonic than woodwinds and strings.  ''<br><br>While the absolute deviation from the interger series is greater in bells<br>than in woodwinds, the smaller absolute deviations actually encountered in<br>woodwinds are - as equations - no less complex.<br><br>Gary's observations that synthetic instrumental sounds with integer<br>harmonic spectra are satisfactory substitutes does illustrate how other<br>aspects of sound - particularly the envelope - may be equally or more<br>critical to our recognition of a sound. <br><br>Since I was around at the start of this discussion, let me reiterate that<br>while I find the integer series to be the best available model, real<br>instruments do deviate from this model (some more than others) and that it<br>might be _useful_ to a composer to investigate the deviations. The claim<br>that another model is more correct - Mr. Lucy's - would need to be<br>supported in a way that decisively demonstrates an advantage over the<br>integer model. He has been unable to do this and, I suspect,  has in fact<br>misunderstood why his tuning might provide certain attractions. At the<br>moment, the difference tone sequences of Erv Wilson provide a more<br>convincing rationale for this entire family of tunings, of which Lucy's is<br>but one in an indefinite number. Beating frequencies are indeed an<br>interesting line of research, particularly in the psychoacoutical domain,<br>but the best way of going about this work is not to start with a single<br>model - i.e. Harrison - and try to prove its superiority but to try to<br>define the advantages of particular beating rates and then determine the<br>tunings that best support these rates in a musical context. The Harrison<br>tuning might just happen to turn up somewhere in such a study, but I would<br>not hazard a bet on it!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 19 Feb 1997 16:50 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11663; Wed, 19 Feb 1997 16:50:32 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11657<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id HAA24253; Wed, 19 Feb 1997 07:47:50 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 19 Feb 1997 07:47:50 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B020C5D2F250B.3038@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
