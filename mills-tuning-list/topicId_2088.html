To me a<br>tonal center is a psychological tendency to hear a certain pitch within the<br>system as a home base, a gravitational center, however you want to say it.<br>This tendency is operative in most music whether it has harmony or not. The<br>tonal center is very often the _finalis_, but not necessarily.<br><br>The use of the term "modal" in most theory textbooks as in the distinction<br>between "modal" and "tonal" counterpoint, is misleading I believe (also<br>"tonal").<br><br>>While there has been a fairly strict intonational standard at most times and<br>>places, "somewhat flexible" here is a considerable understatement.  The<br>>distinction between n-limit JI, x-comma meantone, well-temperament, and<br>>12TET is *totally irrelevant* to the definition of modes and scales!<br>><br>Well, right now I have my synth tuned in a very interesting 11-limit<br>lattice, and when I play the white keys from C to C it certainly doesn't<br>sound like any kind of major scale I would recognize.<br><br>>Look at a music theory book and its description of musical resources.  Where<br>>is there any discussion of pitch or tuning?  It just doesn't matter.  The<br>>only thing that rules out applying JI or meantone is the circle of fifths<br>>with its enharmonic equivalence of notes.<br><br>This is one real problem with most theory books (by which I assume you<br>primarily mean harmony books) but I won't get into that. The reason that<br>they don't go into it is because 12TET is assumed as a standard now. They<br>don't go into a lot of the "why's," not because they aren't important, but<br>just because they want to take a lot of things as given in order to get on<br>to the business of augmented sixth chord arcana. However, in many theory<br>books of pre-12TET period, tuning is discussed as a prerequisite to the<br>study of harmony.<br><br>>>2) A subset of pitches from that tuning system, or, put another way, a<br>>>pattern of intervals. (In the European tradition this means the diatonic<br>>>set.)<br>><br>>But the notes of the modes were not taken from a larger set.  They WERE all<br>>the defined notes.  Others were *added* to the set as necessary for<br>>polyphony.  They were initially considered as intonational inflections, only<br>>later being accepted as separate notes in their own right as sharps and flats.<br>><br>Historically, this is true. However, pitch systems change over time. I have<br>no problem with defining pitch systems in Guido's time as 8/7/0, but I<br>think it's obvious that diatonic European music since at least the 15th<br>century has been 12/7/0. Yes, perhaps accepting enharmonic equivalence was<br>an important step in European music. Personally, I think it was a step<br>conceptually taken long before the 18th century and the use of 12TET, but<br>in any case, once made, the definition of a diatonic mode as a 12-tone<br>subset became a valid one.<br><br>>I agree with Daniel that modes and scales can only be defined in terms of<br>>whole tones and "half" tones, as a pattern of approximate intervals.  I don't<br>>think that those patterns can be described as pitches selected from a<br>>predefined tuning system.<br>><br>This works for the diatonic set (though I think this definition has come to<br>be equivalent with a 12-tone tuning system subset). However, there are<br>other tuning systems that simply are not defined in terms of whole and half<br>steps. Pelog is one that comes to mind. (Though some have posited a 9TET<br>superset for pelog, I have yet to see any convincing evidence for this<br>hypothesis, and much that contradicts it.)<br><br>The tuning system that I mentioned I'm working with now has 9 different<br>sized steps in the octave, ranging from 27 to 204 cents. Perhaps you can<br>hear some sort of generalized half and whole steps defining a "pattern of<br>approximate intervals" in such a system. I can't. However, the ability to<br>do so in a system is part of what I meant by "recognizably diatonic" when<br>refering to the flexibility of tuning systems in defining modes.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
