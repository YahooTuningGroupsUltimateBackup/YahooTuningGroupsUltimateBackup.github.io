Statements such as<br>the one about Atlantis are basically equivalent to and as historically<br>precise as contemporary "channelled communications." Steiner's roots<br>were in the Theosophical movement of the 19th century; he eventually<br>broke from the Theosophists to form his own school, Anthroposophy, a<br>pastiche of Christianity, Northern European pre-Christian traditions,<br>Goethean science, Zoroastrianism, and eastern esotericism.<br><br>The motif of intervals and the octave as emblems of human experience are<br>discussed in _In Search of the Miraculous_, by P.D. Ouspensky, and<br>_Enneagram Studies_, by J.G. Bennett. While these writings are<br>subsequent to Steiner's, they also derive from late nineteenth century<br>esotericism, and from individuals who were as mysterious as Steiner<br>regarding the sources of their information.
