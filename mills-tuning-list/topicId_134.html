While both of these composers have asked me not to review their <br>> work in public, they probably wouldn't mind my saying that their latest work <br>> is excellent.  <br><br>   Thanks, Brian!<br><br>   Actually, I wouldn't mind Brian reviewing my (88CET) music in public.<br>Perhaps he's refering to the fact that I asked him not to duplicate the tape?  <br><br>   Anyway, both of those statements go for others of you who have received<br>copies of my 88CET demo.  You're welcome to review my 88CET demo on this forum,<br>and I also ask you not to copy it.  Stan Hoffman, Randy Winchester, Steve<br>Curtin, and several others have given me some very useful constructive criticism<br>along areas that I hadn't considered.  So thanks to all of you as well.  <br><br>   Here's something else I'd love to hear what you folks have to say about, if<br>anything:<br><br>   Perhaps the most important thing I've learned from their constructive<br>criticism is that attempting to simulate "very convincing orchestral wind and<br>percussion ensembles" (to use Brian's words), is a risky business.  Our ears are<br>VERY picky about classical music.  It's kind of like discussing which is the<br>better violinst between Guidon Kramer and Itzak Perlman:  Violinists can debate<br>that question for hours on end, but the undeniable truth of the matter is that<br>they're both excellent.  So when an electronically synthesized violin<br>performance comes along, it's just not even on tens-of-parts-per-million kind of<br>scale (puns intended of course) we normally use to evaluate classical<br>performances.  Not even CLOSE!  That even though, in the big picture, it could<br>be 95% of the way up the naturalness scale with Itzak Perlman at the top, and a<br>1968-vintage Moog at the bottom.  <br><br>   Or as I'm fond of putting it, when you move from analog and FM synthesis, to<br>physical modeling, sampling, or additive synthesis, you find that your<br>instrument simulations ... improve (?) ... from impressive imitations to what<br>sound like ungodly hideous real instruments!  <br><br>   Any thoughts, anybody?  <br><br>   And my reviewers have pointed out another very amusing risk in attempting the<br>simulate classical ensembles - one especially relavant to xenharmonic<br>realizations:  Traditional timbres carry a strong weight with them.  One<br>reviewer (perhaps I ought not mention names) pointed out that my "Night and Day"<br>(scored for flute quartet, trumpet, three horns, bass trombone, and percussion)<br>felt a lot like listening to Junior High School orchestra performance, because<br>it contained a lot of out-of-tune notes on orchestral instruments!  (Or at least<br>reasonably good simulations of them.)  If it were on abstract electronic timbres<br>instead that sort of image would never have come up.  Along similar lines,<br>another reviewer wasn't sure whether to take my short 88CET fife, drum, and<br>bugle corps piece, called A Different Drummer, for the cute little scherzo I<br>intended it to be, largely because it was rendered on serious-sounding<br>instrument simulations, in a militaristic style.  <br><br>   Any thoughts on that?  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 6 Feb 1996 06:46 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA23946; Mon, 5 Feb 1996 21:46:13 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 5 Feb 1996 21:46:13 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01520d05ad3c2b5be7cb@[10.0.2.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4482 href="#4482">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/1997 2:00:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> > Adding a new definition to the synonym stew only risks novices thinking<br>> > that the two mean two subtly different things.  <br>> Hmm, I don't see that.
