Somebody said that what's wrong with theorizing about<br>tunings; it's harming no one, so why can't they just do it and have folks<br>(like me) quit complaining...good question. So, I've now seen that one of<br>my problems with reading those posts is simply that I do NOT understand a<br>lot of the basic terms and how they're applied to music. I hear about,<br>and have done some reading about, tonality diamonds, stellated hexany's<br>and all, but I need to know what they are before I can feel like a<br>participant in those sorts of discussions. Yes, I am a player first, but<br>theory is vital to help folks keep inquiring and pushing forward. Some of<br>you folks are way out there with this stuff, and that's a compliment...I<br>would like to know more what's being discussed at times. Perhaps some of<br>you guys can talk about some of the basic concepts of advanced theory and<br>help bridge the gap that sometimes exists between the theorists and the<br>street folks like me. Of course, the math is a different story because<br>it's a whole language of concepts and symbols; I just do not have the<br>time to get real heavy into it, and I know many others who feel the same<br>way...still, I believe the basic idea of math, which seems to be<br>explaining the Universe in terms of various numerical balances of sorts,<br>is not so hard to see. I have the greatest respect for the  amazing minds<br>I've encountered on this forum...I cannot always keep up on the theory<br>end, but I'd like to know more of what you're talking about...Hstick<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  george_kahriman@hotmail.com<br>Subject:  Ernest McClain<br>PostedDate:  28-07-97 16:41:22<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  28-07-97 16:41:19-28-07-97 16:41:20,28-07-97 16:40:19-28-07-97 16:40:20<br>DeliveredDate:  28-07-97 16:40:20<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564E2.0050ADAA; Mon, 28 Jul 1997 16:41:13 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA23837; Mon, 28 Jul 1997 16:41:22 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 28 Jul 1997 16:41:22 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA23839<br>Received: (qmail 8987 invoked from network); 28 Jul 1997 14:39:28 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 28 Jul 1997 14:39:28 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199707281437.HAA17101@f63.hotmail.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
