Sorry for the confusion. BTW, are their bbshop<br>>5tets, etc. (not mass choirs)?<br><br>You've got to watch it, with all these people using "tet" instead of "tone<br>equal temperament".  Does anyone like this nomenclature?  Why not call<br>equal-step tunings by the size of the step, or maybe by the number of<br>divisions per space (I referred to 12tet in each of these ways in a previous<br>posting to try them out, "100 equal" and "12:2 equal" respectively), as both<br>of these are consistent for octave and non-octave based temperaments.  Any<br>ideas?  I can say I am not particularly endeared to McLaren's favorite<br>Xtyith root of Nth scheme, found in Xenharmonikon 14.<br><br>Anyway, all Barbershop is 4-part, be it quartet or chorus.  Barbershop is a<br>unique type of style-> rigidly defined by the one organization that saved<br>it, and then made it, www.SPEBSQSA.org.<br><br>I sing with my local Barbershop chorus, and I have found it highly<br>rewarding, both for my vocal technique and for my understanding of the 7-limit.<br><br>And on the topic of choral work, I think we should dispatch at once quartets<br>to sing in the 13-limit.  A Society for the Encouragement of Just Intonation<br>Choral Singing at www.SEJICS.org?  Why not?<br><br>-----<br>As regards Paul Hahn's statements on 22 vs. 24 equal step/octave tunings....<br><br>>To get back to the question, 22TET is consistent up to the 11-limit,<br>>while 24TET is only consistent to the 5-limit.  (In this respect it is<br>>actually worse than its subset 12TET, which is consistent to the<br>>9-limit.)<br><br>>Peter, if you are interested I could dredge up some of the messages from<br>>the last time we discussed this.  (Hey, is the list archived anywhere?)<br><br>I for one would be interested in anything you've got on this.  I think I<br>remember seeing this term "consistency" in an article in an old issue of the<br>Xenharmonikon, but I didn't understand it until now.  Thanks, Paul!<br><br>There was also another term that Ivor used, "symmetry".  He never defined it<br>too well, but he complained that 12-tone was too symmetric, and that when<br>one first began Xenharmonic exploration, it was crucial to "knock the ear<br>out" with a non-symmetric tuning like 19-tone.  Could this be the same<br>thing, Ivor's term for consistency?<br><br>Wouldn't it be nice to have a chart that measured both the "approximation"<br>and "consistency" values for each limit for each temperament?<br><br>Carl<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Paul-Hahn@library.wustl.edu<br>Subject:  Re: Barbershop and Equal-Step Tuning<br>PostedDate:  25-09-97 21:52:35<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  25-09-97 21:52:17-25-09-97 21:52:17,25-09-97 21:51:21-25-09-97 21:51:21<br>DeliveredDate:  25-09-97 21:51:21<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C125651D.006D25F2; Thu, 25 Sep 1997 21:52:11 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA31111; Thu, 25 Sep 1997 21:52:35 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 25 Sep 1997 21:52:35 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA31072<br>Received: (qmail 26216 invoked from network); 25 Sep 1997 12:52:32 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 25 Sep 1997 12:52:32 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95q.970925143314.6784B-100000@library.wustl.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
