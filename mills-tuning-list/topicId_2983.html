We have had him at<br>Microstock twice, and I really enjoy his music and concept. He is<br>presently getting ready to record a new CD (I forgot what material), and<br>I know Ben Johnston is currently writing him a piece. And, dare I say it,<br>John requested that I write down my acoustic version of "The Spider" (19<br>equal), and he said he was going to build a 19 tone fingerboard and learn<br>it...a real honor for me, and unusual in that John only plays in pure<br>tunings...hope it happens.<br>    Also, I forgot to mention that all of my 34 tone guitars were either<br>sent to me, or financed, by the late Larry Hanson. The 34 electrics were<br>built in Los Angeles, and the 34 acoustics were built here in Denver by<br>Starrett, from grants provided by Larry. He truly put his money where his<br>mouth is, and I am very grateful for the chance to know him...Hstick<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com><br>Subject:  Instruments<br>PostedDate:  04-01-98 18:09:17<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  04-01-98 18:06:46-04-01-98 18:06:47,04-01-98 18:06:05-04-01-98 18:06:05<br>DeliveredDate:  04-01-98 18:06:05<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256582.005DFF76; Sun, 4 Jan 1998 18:08:38 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29417; Sun, 4 Jan 1998 18:09:17 +0100<br>Date: Sun, 4 Jan 1998 18:09:17 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29426<br>Received: (qmail 8155 invoked from network); 4 Jan 1998 09:09:13 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 4 Jan 1998 09:09:13 -0800<br>Message-Id: <19980104170842000.AAA162@ascend513.nni.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6943 href="#6943">ðŸ”—</a>sejic@nersp.nerdc.ufl.edu (World Harmony Project Inc.)</h3><span>1/5/1998 1:01:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Well, I use a lot of instruments.
