I had always gotten the<br>the feeling that mush of what Densmore collected was unsystematic be<br>concidering the time (1900 of some) an awkward collection is better than<br>none at all!. Has anyone found evidence of data she collected being<br>wrong? As for her having objection to "out of tune" singers, her<br>comments on intonation in Chipewa Music (B of AE no.45 1910) stike me as<br>someone that would not be that way, but not everything that happens<br>,happens in print! Having a great great grandmother from the above tribe<br>(she lived from 1840-1946!) endears her to me in a way. Are there any<br>observations as to intonation thayt you could share?!<br>								Kraig Grady<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Kraig Grady <kraiggrady@anaphoria.com><br>Subject:  Re: Rod Poole<br>PostedDate:  30-12-97 06:53:22<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  30-12-97 06:51:05-30-12-97 06:51:05,30-12-97 06:50:29-30-12-97 06:50:29<br>DeliveredDate:  30-12-97 06:50:29<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125657D.00202086; Tue, 30 Dec 1997 06:52:51 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA27588; Tue, 30 Dec 1997 06:53:22 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 30 Dec 1997 06:53:22 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA27608<br>Received: (qmail 9105 invoked from network); 29 Dec 1997 21:53:19 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 29 Dec 1997 21:53:19 -0800<br>Message-Id: <34A88BBE.4984@anaphoria.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
