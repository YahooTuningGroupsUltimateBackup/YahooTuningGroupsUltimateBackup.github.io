I did a quick scan<br>of the tuning list digests that came in the email while I've been gone and<br>didn't see mention of it (sorry if I missed it), so here it is -- point<br>your browser at:<br><br>	http://www.composersrecordings.com/partch.html<br><br>to see a listing of the tracks and order online if you like.<br><br>It is hard to believe that after so many years of one or two recordings in<br>the bins, in almost one fell swoop (and counting the releases available<br>from Philip Blackburn's "Enclosures" series) virtually all of Partch's<br>recorded output (which means mostly everything he composed) is now at our<br>disposal for listening (and viewing, in the "Enclosures" videos). And I'm<br>not excited just because I did the analog-to-digital tape transfers for CRI...<br><br>In any event, it's a pretty singular year for the amount of material<br>released, so let's enjoy the bounty. He didn't just write "Genesis of a<br>Music".<br><br>Nope -- lot's more than that.<br><br>Have fun!<br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br>*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*<br> Jonathan M.

Congrats on the A->D<br>>transfers!  Thanks a bunch!  I hope you get royalties, as CRI says they're<br>>selling like hot cakes!<br><br>Sincere thanks for the kind comments. I did the best I could on the A->D,<br>but I will say that the sonic nature of some of those very old tapes amazed<br>me when I listened to them the first time. The physical nature was a<br>different matter (old splices breaking left and right). A lot of people<br>have asked me about the project, and in a short while I'll have an article<br>on the web site about what putting together all that material entailed.<br><br>For the obsessed only, of course.<br><br>>No Delusion of the Fury, tho?  CRI don't have it, and I don't remember<br>>seeing an enclosure for it.<br><br>Well, there are still rumors that Sony, who inherited the Columbia archives<br>(read: bought them out) intends on re-issuing it. If the CRI sell well<br>and/or get a lot of notice they'll probably smell $$$. In any event, they<br>own the master, not the Harry Partch Foundation, one of the only times that<br>happened to Partch.<br><br>BUT.......... On Enclosure Four, Philip Blackburn has released the film<br>that Madeline Tourtelot did of the "Delusion" production in LA. Sonically<br>it can't remotely compare with the recording, but on the other hand you can<br>see to what extent HP wanted musicians to get involved in a piece in the<br>film. Well worth getting, even if you have to convince friends and split<br>the cost or something.<br><br>If Sony is listening: get off your butts or I'll bootleg the thing...<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>On other notes:<br><br>1. I have replied to Dan Wolf about the Erickson stroke rods.<br>2. I just came across info that Kraig Grady will be performing in LA at a<br>percussion convention (on their "Music Research [read: wacko] Day") next<br>Wednesday. It may not be public, but if anyone is interested I'll track<br>down the info and post back to the list.<br><br>OK, I've got to go put on my SuperFly coat and sell some CDs on the street<br>corner...<br><br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br>*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*<br> Jonathan M.
