Gibson either. Distinguishing notes, intervals,<br>melodies, and so on in many systems with smaller intervals than 19-tET is<br>not a problem in many contexts. Perhaps he meant something else and would<br>clarify.<br><br>To say 22-tET is useless suggests only that he has never used it. Another<br>clarification, perhaps? Many people have declared of no interest various<br>tunings simply because they don't fit their requirements. The requirements<br>aren't universal.<br><br>In his 1973 book, for example, Eric Regener dismissed all positive tunings<br>(P5 greater than 700 cents) because of a non-universal assumption about<br>"regular" tunings. This doesn't invalidate the rest of his book, because<br>you can take or leave his approach on that matter.<br><br>Paul Rapoport<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  A440A <A440A@aol.com><br>Subject:  Chestnut help......<br>PostedDate:  08-12-97 01:35:56<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  08-12-97 01:34:04-08-12-97 01:34:05,08-12-97 01:33:53-08-12-97 01:33:54<br>DeliveredDate:  08-12-97 01:33:54<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256567.00031D00; Mon, 8 Dec 1997 01:34:00 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA09021; Mon, 8 Dec 1997 01:35:56 +0100<br>Date: Mon, 8 Dec 1997 01:35:56 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09025<br>Received: (qmail 1243 invoked from network); 7 Dec 1997 16:35:46 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 7 Dec 1997 16:35:46 -0800<br>Message-Id: <57c03573.348b3ef8@aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6567 href="#6567">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>12/9/1997 1:59:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>19th century tuning by ear was a highly developed=0A=0Aart based=<br>> on aesthetic judgments for every tone, and test chords were=0A=0Aused mo=<br>>re than test intervals.

Certainly pianos have been able to be tuned to equal temperament before any<br>    20th century technology was applied to it.  It seems surprising that the<br>    same nontechnological methodologies couldn't be applied to 17th-century<br>    clavichords.<br>2.  Clearly there was one very easily available tuning device by which to tune<br>    a clavichord to equal temperament, so that it will match a lute.  That<br>    tuning reference device is the lute itself.<br><br>   Bear in mind of course that I'm just speaking in terms of what seems<br>possible;  I certainly don't by any means claim to be an expert on 17th<br>century clavier tuning practices.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Steven Rezsutek <rezsutek@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov><br>Subject:  In support of 22, among others<br>PostedDate:  09-12-97 16:41:27<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  09-12-97 16:39:35-09-12-97 16:39:35,09-12-97 16:39:22-09-12-97 16:39:22<br>DeliveredDate:  09-12-97 16:39:22<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256568.0056030F; Tue, 9 Dec 1997 16:39:28 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10582; Tue, 9 Dec 1997 16:41:27 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 9 Dec 1997 16:41:27 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10575<br>Received: (qmail 25307 invoked from network); 9 Dec 1997 07:41:23 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 9 Dec 1997 07:41:23 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199712091538.KAA16890@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
