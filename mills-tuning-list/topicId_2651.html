We<br>could have a web page about who (member of the tuning mailing list)<br>plays what instrument. We could divide the discussion into private<br>e-mails (by intrument.) This is easy to do with the CC option of e-mail<br>(carbon copy). If you do not know how it works, just hit the "reply to<br>all" button. THERE WILL BE DETAILLED INSTRUCTIONS IN THE FIRST MESSAGE<br>YOU WILL RECEIVE. An archive of all the discussions could be kept, and<br>if there is a demand, articles could be written.<br><br> If you are interested, send me your infos (instruments played/owned,<br>tunings used, geographic location and anything else that you want to<br>share, like year of birth-- on the internet, we do not know who you are)<br>at mailto://kami@interlinx.qc.ca<br><br>Maybe this won't work : in that case, it would still be interesting to<br>keep a database about who's who (it could be made necessary to send you<br>infos when you first subscribe to the list. Is this a possibility?) And<br>why not maintain a "Clarinet technique page", "Basson fingering page",<br>"Steel guitar tuning page" (this one already exists,<br>http://www.wco.com/~quasar/articles/just_e9.html ). Why not an orchestra<br>site, with links to the instruments? A page only has to be written once,<br>but can can updated whenever we get new ideas.<br><br>So send me a e-mail, your ideas are welcome! If we all do this together,<br>maybe there will be more than just ten persons reponding. It's up to<br>you!<br><br>REQ: Could someone send me the Yunik and Swift article about 19TET<br>trumpet? I did my own research on the subject, but I have not seen this<br>article.<br><br>PS : I notice that there is no info on JI-chord progressions and<br>wandering tonics on the 'net. Maybe we could put ours ideas together on<br>this subject as well?
