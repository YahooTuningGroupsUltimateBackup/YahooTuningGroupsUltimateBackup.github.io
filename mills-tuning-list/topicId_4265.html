I've found that if I enter space then <br>carriage return by the time I've typed 72 characters in a line <br>my entry looks normal and the quotes and other <br>punctuation marks are transmitted as I've typed <br>them.  It took me a while to discover this but it's <br>working well now.  Let's see - (80 character line) -<br><br>xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx<br>xxxxxxxxx <br> <br><br>Dave Hill,    La Mesa, CA</div><h3><a id=8956 href="#8956">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;John Loffink&#x22; &#x3C;jloffink@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/1998 4:43:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>From: William Sethares <sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>><br>>I looked into this. One fact is that in order for Amazon to carry the<br>>CD, it must have a UPC code (so they can track their inventory).<br>>When I followed the UPC links, it looks like its easy to get a number,<br>>but it costs about $350 to become a "manufacturer" (six digits) and<br>>then you have access to five digits (10,000 different) individual product<br>>numbers.<br>><br>>Since I am not currently planning to release 10,000 different CDs<br>>(in the near term) it made me wonder if maybe there would be a way<br>>to "go in on" a number with a few people, or to find someone who already<br>>has a UPC number and would be willing to share/sell/rent a number or two.<br>><br>>Has anyone done this before?<br>><br><br><br>Many of the larger CD makers provide a UPC code as part of their package at<br>no extra charge.<br><br>John Loffink<br>jloffink@pdq.net<br>http://freeweb.pdq.net/jloffink</div>
