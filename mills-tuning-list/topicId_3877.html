It may be over-cute, or just a feature I added to confuse<br>librarians, but the book title is the subject of this post, the enclosed CD<br>is titled differently: "Lou Harrison: A World Composed."<br><br>We have not been able to arrange a discount deal--mainly because Oxford<br>kept the list price down to $35 even after costs of CD exceeded their<br>budget, and we went 100 pages over our contract limit. We've also tried to<br>get online booksellers like Amazon &c to give a discount, but they won't do<br>so, since for academic titles Oxford gives only a "short discount" to<br>wholesalers. (In any case, the whole kit and caboodle is worth the price of<br>admission just to get David Doty's realization of the "Simfony in Free<br>Style" and Lou's private taped performance of the "Suite from Cinna"<br>preceeded by his demonstration of the tuning procedure and scale--just two<br>of the 9 first recordings our of the 12 works on the CD.)<br><br>While I hope that your local bookstores will stock it, the most efficient<br>way to order the book is via our web page at:<br><br>http://arts.ucsc.edu/lou.harrison/<br><br>which includes table of contents for the book and CD, and an "Order" link<br>that goes to Oxford's web page for the book.<br><br>I stress our website primarily because we will be using it to supplement<br>the book with a large selection of color photos, continuously updated<br>discography and bibliography, errata (PLEASE send me any suggestions,<br>errors of omission or commission, typos, &c), and gopod willing, Real Audio<br>clips of archival material to supplement the CD.<br><br>On September 15, there will be a release party with live music and signing<br>by Lou and the authors at Bookshop Santa Cruz. We are trying to arrange<br>other appearance/signing dates, but this and perhaps one other in Aptos in<br>October, will be the only ones Lou plans to attend.<br><br>We are currently working on a second volume, which will include all of<br>Lou's uncollected prose writings, published and unpublished, both essays<br>and reviews. Also a considerable volume of correspondence, and an initial<br>selection from Lou's voluminous and sometimes indecipherable notebooks<br>(there are over a hundred of these in the archive!).<br><br><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------<br>Fredric Lieberman    	 Professor of Music     U.C.
