I have either scanned or thoroughly studied (or somewhere in<br>between) all of the material that you suggest and found them all quite<br>influential in forming my present opinions. Fokker, Vyshnegradski, et al,<br>were only excluded from my thesis for the simple fact that projects, like<br>human beings, must have limits. The paper was written with the foresight<br>that I might, someday, have the opportunity to teach a course (or a section<br>of a course) in methods of composition in extended tonalities and would be<br>able use it for that purpose. Many of you have probably already read, first<br>hand, all of the source material that went into the project and would glean<br>little, if any, "new" information from it. However, it is not completely<br>without merit to make comparisons of epitomized theories viewed in close<br>proximity. So from that point of view you might find it at least amusing. I<br>am hoping to publish segments of it at some point in the future, so you<br>might see it pop up somewhere. Otherwise, I can produce and mail it for<br>about $8.

(Harry Partch didn't - or so it seems to me anyway - do a methodical<br>survey of tunings, as much as he created an innovative new musical world and let<br>his mind play in it.)  That along with the folks he already, like Easley<br>Blackwood.  Ivor Darreg did an even more complete survey of equal-temperaments<br>in his Xenharmonic Frontier, Multiples of Five, and Multiples of Seven studies.<br>(Some of that is in his CD, by the way.)  But perhaps more importantly, he<br>investigated and published methodical suggested approaches to composition in<br>those tunings.  <br><br>   It's kind of odd in a way:  I both strongly agree, and yet somewhat disagree,<br>with Matthew's view of the importance of methodically evaluating<br>the various new-tuning possibilities.  That makes a lot of sense with regard to<br>making sense of the chaos, and guiding people with certain inclinations toward<br>appropriate tunings.  The balance to that though is the creative zing we often<br>get seemingly from nowhere - I call it divine inspiration - in doodling around<br>with a given tuning.  That doesn't have much to do with methodical<br>investigation, neither with respect to locating an appropriate tuning, nor with<br>respect to the composition process itself.  Some of the best compositional and<br>listening inspirations I've had were totally inexplicable best I can tell.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 24 Jan 1996 08:44 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id XAA09160; Tue, 23 Jan 1996 23:44:36 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 23 Jan 1996 23:44:36 -0800<br>Message-Id: <960124073647_71670.2576_HHB48-12@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2491 href="#2491">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;J.
