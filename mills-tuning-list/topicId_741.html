Thanks, though, for the earlier references.<br><br>I'd be happy to clear this up, but I don't see what your complaint is <br>directed at.<br><br>>> Exactly. Here's the implicit derivation of your strict mathematical<br>>> definition: the syntonic comma is (3:2)^4/(5:4) (ignoring octaves);<br>>> therefore the best syntonic comma is 4 times the best perfect fifth minus <br><br>>> the best major third, mod the number of notes per octave. Another, just <br>as<br>>> musically relevant and just as mathematically strict, definition would <br>be:<br>>> the syntonic comma is (3:2)^3/(5:3) (again ignoring octaves); therefore <br>the<br>>> best syntonic comma is 3 times the best perfect fifth minus the best <br>major<br>>> sixth, mod the number of notes per octave. If the two definitions lead to <br>a<br>>> conflict, I see no reason one should take precedence. Therefore, in such<br>>> cases, there is no "best" syntonic comma.<br><br>>Perhaps someone else would like to explain the precedence of 1:5 over<br>>3:5. It's fairly clear to me, which does not invalidate attempts to base<br>>a system on 3:5. I don't know whether something could be concocted to<br>>include both in all cases.<br><br>That's precisely the point. In a case, like 20tet, where the two approaches <br>lead to different results, then the tuning is simply not compatible with a <br><br>just-intonation view. Defining a "best" size for the syntotic comma is <br>futile in such systems. The precedence of 1:5 over 3:5 seems consistent with <br>an Euler-Fokker, or square lattice, philosophy but not an Erv Wilson, or <br>triangle lattice, philosophy. I have investigated the relationship between <br>the two approaches in terms of lattices and made some geometrical <br>discoveries in the process. Both approaches extend to any number of <br>dimensions -- perhaps I'll write a paper on this someday. Paul, I guess your <br>notation system succeeds within the Euler-Fokker philosophy, but I lean <br>towards a more egalitarian one.<br><br>> >The method . . . . also allows for an improvement in Blackwood's <br>notations<br>>> in a few cases.<br><br>>Blackwood's notation for 16, 18, and possibly a few others isn't<br>>consistent in potential use on all steps of the tuning. (I haven't his<br>>work at hand as I write this.) Examining the scales he writes out at the<br>>beginning of each piece in the 12 etudes should show what I am getting<br>>at.<br><br>Ah, I'll bet this derives from his desire to preserve standard notation of <br>diminished scales.
