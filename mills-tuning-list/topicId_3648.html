A friend from the Csound <br>list,Javier Ruiz, just sent me the foll. bit of info.<br><br>>Drew, if you are interested in microtonality you should check the work of<br>>Robert Dick. This man has compiled dozens of positions to get microtonal<br>>divisions on the flute. A friend of mine (just returned from Amsterdam)<br>>showed me those techniques last saturday. It was amazing! and I am back to<br>>write instrumental music.<br><br>I see that there is an album by R. Dick listed in the mcLaren/Op de Coul <br>CD list at Mills.<br><br>Later,<br>Drew</div><h3><a id=7944 href="#7944">ðŸ”—</a>Johnny Reinhard &#x3C;reinhard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/1998 7:15:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>There are many dedicated microtonal flutists throughout the world.  Robert<br>Dick plays unsystemitized microtones, neither just nor equal.<br><br>Andrew Bolotowsky of the AFMM Ensemble has played in a myriad of tunings<br>on flute (AFMM flutist).  Stefani Starin plays dead on JI flute with<br>Newband, which she co-directs.  John Fonville, Ann LeBerge, Bruce Gremo,<br>Pierre Yves Artaud, and others with whom I am as yet unfamiliar.<br><br>Three are numerous fingering charts for flute since the mid-eighteenth<br>century.  Howell's early flute work featured a 31-TET fingering chart in<br>1974 (The Avant-Garde Flute, University of California Press).<br><br>There was a tough period when Bartolozzi's _New Sounds For Woodwinds_<br>printed quartertone fingerings for flute that didn't work.  Toru Takemitsu<br>was really burned by this when he wrote _Voice_ and other flute works<br>utilizing Bartolozzi's fingerings.<br><br>Open hole flute or closed hole flute?  No contest, Robert Dick has the<br>only open hole bass flute - I believe - in the world.  (He had it made.)<br>Robert is now living in Zurich, Switzerland.  He has a private press<br>called Mutliple Breath.  I learned to circular breathe using his book for<br>circular breathing on the flute.  Couldn't have done it without him.  Very<br>straight forward.  He says his style of microtonal composition stems from<br>his years as a Yale composition student working primarily with tape music,<br>cutting and splicing. <br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music	<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@idt.net<br>http://www.echonyc.com/~jhhl/AFMM</div>
