Daniel brought a great deal of knowledge and experience to the<br>discussions here, and I felt that it would be a great loss to have him<br>sign off. I felt insulted on behalf of the list subscribers, especially<br>the newer ones, as I interpreted Daniel's comments to indicate that he<br>had nothing more to learn and it was not worth his while to teach.<br>Another interpretation is possible, however; Daniel may simply have been<br>too busy to keep up with the influx of new subscribers and (often) old<br>topics and needed to focus more time on real life for a while. With<br>insulting brats like myself around having no lives ourselves, who could<br>blame him?<br><br>My sincerest apologies to Daniel Wolf and here's hoping he returns to<br>the fold soon.<br><br>>-----Original Message-----<br>>From:	Paul H.

I joined this list in<br>>the #600s, and Paul Rapoport and I have been repetedly asking the same<br>>question (deleted above: what recordings of WTC 1&2 exist in unequal<br>>temperaments) to no avail (except that I already knew of the Anthony Newman).<br>>The archives, which I read, only go up to about #350, so the "so thorough<br>>discussion" of this must have occured between 350 and 600. Will somebody just<br>>name a good recording of WTC 1&2 in some kind of pseudo-authentic tuning,<br>>PLEASE, so I don't have to plunk $50 on some equal-tempered or lousily played<br>>version? P.S. I think you're dead wrong about most harpsichordists, but God<br>>bless your optimism.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com><br>Subject:  EMI<br>PostedDate:  05-02-98 21:38:07<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  05-02-98 21:37:07-05-02-98 21:37:08,05-02-98 21:35:41-05-02-98 21:35:41<br>DeliveredDate:  05-02-98 21:35:41<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C12565A2.00714006; Thu, 5 Feb 1998 21:36:59 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA09064; Thu, 5 Feb 1998 21:38:07 +0100<br>Date: Thu, 5 Feb 1998 21:38:07 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09062<br>Received: (qmail 14215 invoked from network); 5 Feb 1998 12:37:19 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 5 Feb 1998 12:37:19 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.96.980205123609.29816B-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
