To<br>>paraphrase David Brinkley, I may not be able to be objective but I can try<br>>to be fair.<br><br>Good for you. Perhaps you can do us *all* a favor and take a look at the<br>local newspaper for a couple of local concerts to recommend to Brian<br>that might give him a better field for the breadth of work that comes out<br>of "academia" these days. I think it's worth gambling that things are at<br>*least* as loose there as here. Here I am out in dairyland and I'm sitting<br>through Charles Wuorinen wannabes *and* folks who want to channel<br>Shostakovich or Debussy or Duke Ellington and then walking across the<br>street to hear Marilyn Crispell and Roscoe Mitchell running down some<br>kind of harmolodic improvisatory take on the work of this local guy with<br>some serious serialist chops whose music uses a completely different set<br>of tonal resources. I get in my car and drive to Chicago where I spend the<br>interset bits of the aforementioned Table of the Elements festival chatting<br>up some of the string players from Rachel's about Erkki-Sven Tuur and<br>Peteris Vasks. Heck, there's even the rumour that Tristan Murail is going<br>to be at Columbia. That's certainly a sign of the End Times (since I know<br>that they interviewed both Rzewski *and* Ferneyhough)! If he were in<br>Japan, we could simply turn Eric Lyon loose on him :-). See if you can<br>check a copy of Jamey Pritchett's book "The Music of John Cage" outta<br>the library and make him at least flip through the thing. Buy him a good<br>bottle of Merlot and sit him down for the canonical chat about catching more<br>flies with honey than with vinegar. I know we can count on you, John....<br><br>If this SAG thang is a chance to hear a live version of the Anaphorian Grady<br>stuff that John Chalmers played for us in Hong Kong, RUNDON'TWALK. It<br>was *wonderful.* My fondest hope for you is that it transpires that la<br>Bry turns out to be just some guy who turns from being slightly socially<br>challenged in real life to an ideologue with a megaphone (in short, that<br>he and I will turn out to be largely similar in real life, as Mr. Chalmers<br>so well knows....except for my reticence when it comes to calling for the<br>ruination and banishment of those with whom I disagree, of course!) once<br>he's free from the vicissitudes of real interaction outside of the electron<br>stream. May it be so.<br><br>>Am I nuts or what?<br><br>No, you're close enough to go and hear some wonderful music. I'd jump<br>at the chance, if I were you.<br><br>>Must be the single malt talking...<br><br>Ardbegh? (did I spell that right?) Given mah heritage, Ah'm a small batch<br>Bourbon person mahse'f. Booker Noe's.<br><br>[insert Walker Percy quote here],<br>Gregory<br><br>_<br>I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,<br>paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only<br>maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it.
