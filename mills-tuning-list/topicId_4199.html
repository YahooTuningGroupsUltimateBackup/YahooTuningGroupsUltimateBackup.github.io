Whoever's keeping track of those out there, pay heed!<br><br>I'm assuming that no one else has paid any attention to my contest, but<br>in case anyone gave it a try, at this point I'm willing to allow for<br>some rule-bending. For example, a couple of 14 out of 26-tET scales look<br>good if you drop the requirement that three complete chords suffice to<br>cover the scale. If also you drop the requirement that otonal and utonal<br>chords be constructed from the same pattern of scale steps, a whole<br>array of many-noted scale open up. A couple of very well-tuned ones have<br>occured to us: 22 out of 41-tET to me, and 19 out of 31-tET to Dave. Let<br>me describe these scales a bit . . .<br><br>A maximally even 22 out of 41-tET has a very interesting melodic<br>structure. First, note that any octave span (C-c, D-d, etc.) of the<br>normal diatonic scale (maximally even 7 out of 12-tET, 19-tET, or<br>26-tET) has two tetrachords, each spanning a 4:3 frequency ratio and<br>consisting of several equally-sizes large steps plus one small step, and<br>that an additional large step (either at the bottom, at the top, or<br>between the two tetrachords) completes the octave. Well, any 2:1 span of<br>the 22-out-of-41 scale has three "octachords", each spanning a 5:4<br>frequency ratio and consisting of several equally-sized large steps<br>(2/41 oct) plus one small step (1/41 oct), and an additional large step<br>(either at the bottom, at the top, between the bottom two octachords, or<br>between the top two octachords). This is a remarkable similarity and may<br>have something to with the fact that 22 out of 41 is an MOS scale<br>generated by 41's 5:4 approximation, 13/41 oct.<br>Now the harmonic properties of this scale are at least as remarkable.<br>First, note that the normal diatonic scale in any meantone tuning<br>(including 12-tET, 19-tET, 26-tET, 31-tET, and many non-closed<br>temperaments) has close approximations to three Otonalities complete<br>through the 5-limit (major triads) and three Utonalities complete<br>through the 5-limit (minor triads). These have a maximum error of 15.6<br>cents in 12-tET and a maximum error of 5.4 cents in quarter-comma<br>meantone. Well, the 22-out-of-41 scale has ten Otonalities complete<br>through the 9-limit and ten Utonalities complete through the 9-limit<br>(two of each can be completed through the 11-limit). The maximum error<br>is 6.8 cents, which is the error of the 9:5. The largest error within<br>the 7-limit is that of the 5:3, namely, 6.3 cents.<br><br>A maximally even 19 out of 31-tET can be thought of as being constructed<br>from identical tetrachord-like blocks. But there are several instances<br>of both large (2/31 oct.) and small (1/31 oct.) step sizes in each<br>block. Therefore it may be difficult to know where one is in such a<br>scale just from the melodic succession. Richmond Browne has pointed out<br>the importance of rare intervals for position finding. The closest thing<br>to such a signpost is the three-step sequence small-large-small, which<br>only happens twice in the scale. But the scale is generated by the 4:3<br>approximation, something it has in common with the traditional diatonic<br>scale.<br>Harmonically, the scale is wonderful, having nine Otonalities complete<br>through the 9-limit and nine Utonalities complete through the 9-limit,<br>all with a maximum error of 11.1 cents (in the 9:5) and a maximum<br>7-limit error of 6 cents (in the 5:3).<br><br>A while back Andrzej Gawel described a maximally even 19 out of 36-tET<br>scale which was summarily ignored by the List. This scale is a 19-note<br>MOS generated by the 19/36 oct interval, much like the standard diatonic<br>scale is a 7-note MOS generated by the 7/12 oct interval, and including<br>the latter scale within it. Thus the tetrachord-like structure spans the<br>approximate 7:5, and only one small interval occurs within each of the<br>tetrachord-like blocks, which bodes well for position finding. The scale<br>has seven Otonalities complete through the 7-limit and seven Utonalities<br>complete through the 7-limit, with a maximum error of 15.8 cents (in the<br>7:5). This almost half the size of the smallest step. Attemting to<br>construct 9-limit chords forces one to have an error of more than half<br>the smallest step, since 36-tET is not consistent through the 9-limit.<br>Can anyone think of a way of improving Gawel's proposal?</div><h3><a id=8863 href="#8863">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/18/1998 6:56:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Here's a version of my tuning that is easier to remember since it has whole cent offsets from 12-tET and reduces the two semi-wolves (12 cent error) to (barely) acceptable fifths with a 10 cent error. The price paid for this improvement is only an increase from 12 to 13.2 cents in the maximum 9-limit error (excluding the 7:5), so we see it is a tolerant tuning. (The 7:5 error is fixed at 17.5 cents for all versions since it is approximated by the half octave.)<br><br>This version has 8 fifths of 706 cents, 2 of 712, and 2 wolves of 664 cents.<br><br>Note	Offset		Step<br>	from 12-tET	size<br>	(cents)	(cents)<br>---------------------------<br>C	+ 6		106<br>C#	+12		106<br>D	+18		 64<br>D#	-18		106<br>E	-12		106<br>F	- 6		112<br>F#	+ 6		106<br>G	+12		106<br>G#	+18		 64<br>A	-18		106<br>A#	-12		106<br>B	- 6		112<br><br>This can be seen to be 12 from 200-tET, however it does not use the interesting approximations given by Robin Perry in this list on 17-Nov-1998.<br><br>Errata: The offsets in my earlier posting were as they would have been for a scale starting on G, not C as shown.
