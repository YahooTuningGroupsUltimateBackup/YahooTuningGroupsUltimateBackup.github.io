Over the past two years or so I've developed a new diatonic tuning for<br>the pedal steel.  Please take a moment to look at it at the following web<br>page:<br><br>http://wco.com/~quasar/tunings/fscale12.htm<br><br>Notice the tempering chart midway down the page.  I tune the instrument with<br>a Korg tuning meter that shows the number of cents from 12TET at A440.<br><br>Now, my understanding is that this is meantone temperment.  Most of my<br>steel-playing friends draw a blank on the word "meantone".  The temperment<br>debate among steel guitarists is quite simple: JI vs. 12TET (though they<br>call them by different names.<br><br>My first question: is my temperment meantone, or is it something else?  It<br>sounds real pretty but I know it's not JI.<br><br>After reading in this group about 19TET (I'd never heard of it until a week<br>ago!), I've come to realize that it would be fairly easy to retune my<br>diatonic steel to it.  I'd have to paint myself a 19 tone fretboard - that<br>sounds like fun, actually.  Tuning the strings, pedals and knee levers would<br>be a snap with my Korg tuner.<br><br>I wonder if anyone here would care to speculate on how it would sound.  In<br>particular, would the harmonies ring as nicely as they do in my current<br>(meantone?)temperment?  Or should I expect it to sound a little rougher?<br><br>I'd be happy to answer any questions about the pedal steel.  I've been<br>playing for over 25 years, and I write for the various pedal steel<br>publications occassionally.  I personally feel that it's the most versatile<br>instrument for microtonal music, and I'm always disappointed that it isn't<br>used outside of country music as often as it could be.<br><br>    -b0b-<br>-----<br>quasar@wco.com (Bobby Lee)<br>http://wco.com/~quasar/<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
