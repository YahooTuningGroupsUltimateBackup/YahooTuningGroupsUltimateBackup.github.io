Since then, I've learned that SoundBlasters respond to MIDI<br>>pitchbend commands in unconventional ways.  This means that I was hearing the<br>>ET one correctly, but the JI version was out of tune.  No wonder it sucked!<br><br>When I pieced together the Moussorgsky MIDI files, along with other MIDI<br>files reachable via http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint, I also<br>found out that "pitch bend" did not seem to have a standardized<br>implementation.  At the time, I was hoping I found the most-commonly-used<br>implementation.  It seemed to be most often implemented as follows (where<br>100 cents = an equal tempered semitone):<br><br>        bend -8192 means "bend flat 200 cents<br>        bend -4096 means "bend flat 100 cents<br>        bend +0 means "don't bend it"<br>        bend +4096 means "bend sharp 100 cents<br>        bend +8192 means "bend sharp 200 cents<br><br>In other words, I hoped it was 4096 per half-step, and that it was "linear".<br><br>I haven't experimented with different sound cards too much, but so far I<br>found out that some will completely ignore pitch bend commands, and others<br>will bend the notes to some amount other than a half-step for a value of<br>4096.  I even heard that the amount it bends for value 4096 can be some sort<br>of user-changeable parameter, which might be okay for some sort of live<br>performance machine with a real pitch wheel on it, but would give all sorts<br>of weird sounds when trying to playback a MIDI file on a different PC.<br><br>>Having now heard it on a Mac, which does respond to PBs in the standard way, I<br>>must certainly retract my previous vote and cast it in favor of the 5-lim JI<br>>version.<br><br>I'm still rooting for 5-limit JI myself!<br><br>I was considering having some sort of "test your sound-card" web page, to<br>see if the user's sound card reacted the way it needed to get the desired<br>tuning.  I stumbled across someone else's page that had some microtonal<br>examples, that didn't work on my PC.  Instead of using "pitch bend"<br>commands, it was using some sort of "system exclusive" commands, which I<br>guess only worked on a particular manufacturer's sound card (It might have<br>been for a Roland keyboard in this case).  Anyway, that page did have a<br>"testing" option, which helped me see that I didn't have the right<br>equipment.  It kept playing a note, saying that the note should be changing<br>(and it didn't change on my lousy sound card).<br><br>>Thanks for a fun and informative page!<br><br>Thank you for the fun and informative email!<br><br>--Mark<br>+------------------------------------------------------+<br>| Mark Nowitzky                                        |<br>| email:  nowitzky@alum.mit.edu    AIM:  Nowitzky      |<br>| www:    http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky          |<br>|         "If you haven't visited Mark Nowitzky's home |<br>|         page recently, you haven't missed much..."   |<br>+------------------------------------------------------+</div>
