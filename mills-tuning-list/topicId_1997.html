I hope this is the right<br>place where I can find the information that I need so urgently. I didn't<br>work before with temperaments, but now I have to prepare in short an<br>examples tape containing some very simple four-part choir settings in which<br>different<br>historical temperament are employed (Pythagorean, JI and 12-ET). Other<br>examples, little more complicated,  are in a ET as assumed framework but<br>coming with some irregularities (like a soprano-part sharp of 1 cents or<br>more). <br>My problem is that I don't know at all the technology to work with that,<br>so, please: how can I realize it? I think the best way will be to employ a<br>synth. Could you suggest me a microtonal one and a software able to fine<br>retune *individual* tones (until 1 cent resolution).<br>Thanks in advance to everyone will lose time with my questions!!<br><br>Silvio Segantini<br>sarastro@etr.it<br>gruppo polifonico "F.Coradini", Arezzo<br>tel e fax 0039 575 380635<br><br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 1 May 1997 22:57 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02210; Thu, 1 May 1997 22:57:34 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02188<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id NAA03593; Thu, 1 May 1997 13:55:37 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 1 May 1997 13:55:37 -0700<br>Message-Id: <vines.Fd59+jPDOnA@bangate.compaq.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
