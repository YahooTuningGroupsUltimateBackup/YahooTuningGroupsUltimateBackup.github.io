I just cannot imagine how 'ciblon' can be played<br>>in keyboards.<br><br>Well, it's tough using samples of "other" instruments, although it sounds<br>like you're exploring the processing part of your instruments.  With<br>respect to the ciblon, one thinks of the cello parts sometimes heard in<br>Kroncong, which mimic (quite effectively) pitch and rhythms similar to<br>ciblonan.  With appropriate control of dynamic envelope you should be able<br>to achieve a similar quality with a sampled cello.<br><br><br>>A friend of mine<br>>gave me an idea to use my computer - but I do not have the program. Do<br>>you know what program I can use and where to find it ?<br><br>You might consider using Max.  (By Opcode for the Macintosh)  It's a little<br>more demanding than a conventional sequencer, but if you're interested in<br>modelling musical behaviour like Karawitan (a very interesting challenge)<br>Max is useful in that you can program variations into the individual parts<br>and come up with something closer to the "dynamic steady state" that's<br>essential to this music.  An interactive system like this provides<br>compositional challenges and opportunities that point to some of the deeper<br>levels of intercultural creativity discussed on the list in the last few<br>days.<br><br>With respect to tuning (embat);  Al's posting to the gamelan list in Bahasa<br>Indonesia several months back elaborated on some of the possibilities<br>inherent in the tuning of a gamelan:  (also check out Polansky on<br>"Paratactical Tunings" and Wendy Carlos on "Tuning", both in past Computer<br>Music Journals for more fruitful musings.)<br><br>1. 'mbat Pleng: in which the tone an octave above agrees with the pitch<br>below.  Usually used for dance with Mataraman-style pieces.<br><br>2. 'mbat Larasati:  in which the tone an "octave" above is raised slightly<br>higher than a "true" octave (more than 1200 cents).<br><br>Actually this can be quite subjective and dependent on the nature of the<br>timbres being tuned, as the problem of tuning the somewhat inharmonic low<br>strings of the piano has shown.<br><br>3. 'mbat Sundari:  where the tone an "octave" above is lowered slightly<br>lower than a "true" octave (less than 1200 cents).<br><br>Al mentions that the effect of this tuning is similar to that of 'mbat<br>Larasati.  I haven't heard much mention of this type of "compressed" tuning<br>in Karawitan, the stetched or spiral tuning seems to be more common.  (Our<br>gamelans in Vancouver use 'mbat Larasati)  Does anyone know 'mbat Sundari<br>is commonly used?<br><br>________________________________________________________<br>       Kenneth Newby, Vibrant Arts! newby@sfu.ca<br><br>                 921 East 10th Avenue<br>                   Vancouver, B.C.<br>                   Canada V5T 2B3<br><br>                    604 872-2864<br>________________________________________________________<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 17 Jul 1996 18:51 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA05803; Wed, 17 Jul 1996 09:51:55 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 17 Jul 1996 09:51:55 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960717094740.9986E-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
