My<br>ears at least get the sense of a voice dropping out and something being out of<br>tune.  <br><br>   So in that sense, parallel octaves may actually be a bigger concern in 88CET.<br>And consider also that voices could move in similar, but not quite parallel,<br>motion from one off-octave to the other!  I haven't tested that case personally,<br>but I doubt that whether its one off-octave or the other would be of much<br>concern to our ears.  They're just really nasty intervals (again, not in the<br>case of Bill Sethares' mapped timbres).<br><br>   I suspect that all of this also applies, but not as critically, to the<br>off-twelfth and -double-octave intervals.  But I haven't specifically tried<br>those cases either.  <br> <br>   But what about 88CET's fairly accurate triple octave?  At the risk of<br>committing blasphemy against my classical music training, I'll suggest that<br>parallel triple-octaves rarely compromise independence of contrapuntal voicing<br>in any tuning.  It's just simply too distant an interval for the two voices<br>involved to be confused.  Still, classically trained ears are conditioned to<br>shun them, so you're probably better off not using them anyway (unless you're<br>just trying to thumb your nose at your old Walter Piston textbook!).  <br><br>   What about other parallel intervals?  As you'd probably suspect, they're<br>generally fine, best I've noticed anyway.  Still, I mentioned "raising the ante"<br>earlier.  I find that the 5:2 major tenth sounds strangely perfect-like in an<br>environment of more complex, nontraditional harmonies.  <br><br>   Moving on from parallel motion, classical voice-leading rules say that you're<br>not supposed to write melodic tritones.  That has always struck me as the<br>spoilsport's rule, and a lot of modern traditional music tosses it out the<br>window.  I recommend ignoring that rule in 88CET.  <br><br>   A lot of students and instructors alike profess that these textbook<br>voice-leading rules are all a bunch of hooey anyway;  not of interest for real<br>compositional purposes.  You may well ask why I'm messing around with drivel<br>like this.  <br><br>   There's a difference between ignoring such considerations and consciously<br>violating them for musical effect.  Anybody who's heard Mozart's "Ave Verum<br>Corpus" can readily see that music written in this sort of style can be very<br>powerful.  These considerations definitely aren't pointless nonsense!  They<br>describe pretty much indisputably real and useful musical effects.  Whether or<br>not you want to invoke those effects is a compositional choice to be made.  But<br>to not evaluate these or other compositional tools is to be ignorant of a<br>significant concern to western ears.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 11 Oct 1995 16:33 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA18138; Wed, 11 Oct 1995 07:32:57 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 11 Oct 1995 07:32:57 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199510111432.JAA28960@copper.ucs.indiana.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
