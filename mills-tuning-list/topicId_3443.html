So, if you were going <br>to post your liner notes by email for me to download, it is not going to <br>happen. However, John Starrett has graciously said that you can send him <br>the info, and he will pass it onto me...his address is: <br>jstarret@math.cu.denver.edu   If possible, send info soon as I want to <br>get this organized in the near future...we're actually getting <br>closer..see you...Hstick<br>PS...Foote's accidental post about trolls was appreciated..this list is <br>usually very peaceful; occasionally a personal dig surfaces, and it <br>always says more about the digger than the digee...no need for personal <br>attacks...HHH</div>
