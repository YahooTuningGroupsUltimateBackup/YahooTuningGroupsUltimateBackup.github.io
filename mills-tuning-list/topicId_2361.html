Apologies to<br>>>anyone who received perplexing e-mails from me based on this error.<br>><br>>Actually, this is the correct description of Ma-grama starting on Sa (the<br>>Hindu system tonic). Bill Alves' description (4 3 4 2 4 3 2) begins on Ma, or<br>>sruti 0. In the ancient texts, Ma-grama is derived from Sa-grama (4 3 2 4 4 3<br>>2, starting on sruti 0, called Sa) by raising the fourth note of the latter<br>>by two srutis, and then rotating the note names (Sa -> Ma, etc.) so that Sa<br>>remains what we would consider the tonic of a "major scale." Bill Alves'<br>>description reflects the intermediate step in this derivation, and when the<br>>two scales are compared side-by-side, they can be considered as subsets of a<br>>single sruti system. However, when Graham's descriptions are placed<br>>side-by-side, the fact that a single comma alteration was considered as one<br>>sruti is clearly seen.<br>><br>>The evidence that temperament was used lies in the fact that sruti 2 served<br>>as a recognized chromatic alterations in both scales. It likely functioned as<br>>16/15 in sa-grama and as 135/128 in ma-grama. Early instruments seemed to<br>>have placed the fret for sruti 2 exactly halfway between the open position<br>>and sruti 4. This indicates that a compromise was likely adopted so that<br>>these two notes a diaschisma apart could be represented by one note. Graham,<br>>I'm not sure whether you were trying to say that the specification comma=1,<br>>diaschisma=0, leads unambiguously to 22 tones while your previous<br>>specification comma=diesis could lead to 12, 22, 34, or 46. If this is what<br>>you were saying, can you guide us through the math?<br>><br>>In the 4th century texts, all 7 note names were shifted by one from their<br>>modern definitions (I used the modern names above). Sa was the second note of<br>>the "major scale," rather than the first note. Some have interpreted this<br>>fact to imply that the archetypal modes for the two gramas were actually what<br>>we would now call the "dorian modes" of those scales.<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Paul-Hahn@library.wustl.edu<br>Subject:  Re: J Carrillo<br>PostedDate:  28-08-97 20:04:29<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  28-08-97 20:04:46-28-08-97 20:04:46,28-08-97 20:04:35-28-08-97 20:04:35<br>DeliveredDate:  28-08-97 20:04:35<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256501.00634B86; Thu, 28 Aug 1997 20:04:34 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04310; Thu, 28 Aug 1997 20:04:29 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 28 Aug 1997 20:04:29 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04303<br>Received: (qmail 2990 invoked from network); 28 Aug 1997 18:04:21 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 28 Aug 1997 18:04:21 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95q.970828125410.8795B-100000@library.wustl.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
