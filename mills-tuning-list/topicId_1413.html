Do these interface acceptibly?  THanks <br>> for any info.<br><br>Bruce,<br><br>If no one on the list has, then I suppose I can provide some info.<br>About one year ago Gary and I were working together on this, me<br>sending him midi files and him telling me how they worked. It took<br>quite a lot of them until everything was right. Gary used the ASR-10,<br>which has the same dump format as the EPS. However the ASR sometimes<br>sends back a NAK (negative acknowledgement) message even if the<br>retuning went allright. This problem is known to Ensoniq and the NAK's<br>can be ignored. Steve Curtin told me that the EPS does not do this. <br>So I don't know anyone who actually used it with the EPS, but I'm pretty<br>convinced that it works. And if there remains a problem, I can always<br>make it work, provided you are willing to receive uuencoded midi-files<br>from me for trial. <br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 20 Dec 1996 20:28 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA16230; Fri, 20 Dec 1996 20:30:30 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA16228<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA26061; Fri, 20 Dec 1996 11:30:22 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 20 Dec 1996 11:30:22 -0800<br>Message-Id: <vines.Fd59+9ViimA@bangate.compaq.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
