No just kidding.<br><br><br><br>> Your remarks about the relative difficulty of retuning to 17- or 19ET on <br>> the one hand and 16ET on the other are interesting. I guess you are <br>> referring to the fact that in 16ET the 4-step intervals coincide with the <br>> minor thirds of 12ET but nothing matches the perfect fifth very closely, <br>> while in 17ET and 19ET the fifths do better. Have I understood this <br>> correctly?<br><br>   That's certainly one way to put it.  Another way is that several apparently<br>independent investigations of 16TET (Easley Blackwood and Ivor Darreg for<br>example) have concluded that the most useful way to work with 16TET is as four<br>interlaced diminished seventh chords rather than diatonic subset mode.<br>Blackwood went on to devise a diatonic-subset-based notation system from this<br>framework, but Ivor Darreg, Brian McLaren, and franky I as well, have found his<br>metaphore to diatonic structures difficult to relate to, and of little value.<br><br> <br><br>> This all raises the question of why non-12 ETs are used. I gather from <br>> much of what I have been reading on the subject, that many use them in <br>> order to get closer approximations to various 'ideal' small-whole-number <br>> ratio intervals than are available in 12ET. Fair enough. <br><br>   Finding more accurate approximations to just intonation is the most<br>traditional reason to pursue unusual tunings.  Another, closely-related<br>motivation is to find all-new pitch relationships, whether they be just,<br>approximations to just, or based on some other underlying concept.  <br><br>   And speaking of Ivor Darreg, his main motivation was what he called "moods",<br>which, were I to try to define the concept, I would say that the mood of a<br>tuning is the collective effect of all of its available pitch relationships.<br><br>   Another meaningful motivation is how the tuning works as a system, or perhaps<br>relative to a notation system, including what pitch relationships it casts as<br>more "basic".  17TET for example, on has a pretty good approximation to the 11:9<br>neutral third, and one probably could come up with a system for using 17TET that<br>way.  Most people have approached it a very different way though, concentrating<br>on its way-sharp major third as a dissonance that must be resolved outward to a<br>fourth.  That of course is a reversal of traditional harmonic principles, which<br>can lead to some surprising effects.<br><br><br><br><br>> in retuning for 16ET I wouldn't think of picking out a subset of size 12. I <br>> would simply tune two channels, each to 8ET, with one a 16ET step sharper <br>> than the other. Each channel would then have four unused note numbers. <br><br>   That strikes me as reasonable.  Most people just punt and map it linearly -<br>key for note, mismatching octave boundaries in the keyboard with octave<br>boundaries in the tuning.  Some people (Brian McLaren and Jonathan Glasier for<br>example) have what I consider an amazing ability to ignore the black-white<br>structure of a traditional keyboard.  I've never gotten the hang of that.  Then<br>again, I never really got the hang of keyboard technique at all really;  I'm<br>more of a woodwind and guitar kind of dude.  <br><br><br><br>> I wonder how you carry out your retunings for 88CET. Here, I guess, would <br>> be a case where retuning on the fly or using pitch bends might be useful.<br><br>   I use my Ensoniq ASR-10 for the majority of my 88CET work, and the ASR-10 has<br>provision for (realistically) four tuning tables per instrument.  (Actually, it<br>can have up to eight per instrument, but only four of the eight can be switched<br>off between using the patch-select buttons.)  I however use a purely static<br>tuning table based upon a circle of fifths wrapping within a 7:4.  Under that<br>scheme, I remove the G#/Ab key from the system, which makes the black keys are<br>functionally meaningful auxiliaries, by which I mean that the notes along the<br>circle of fifths spans the white keys first and then the black keys, analogous<br>with the traditional circle.  (The circle reads upward as C A F D B G E C# A# F#<br>D# B#=C, or downward toward the flats as B D F A C Eb Gb Bb Db Fb Ab Cb=B.)<br><br>   As far as I know all others who have worked with 88CET have mapped it<br>linearly instead, and Johnny Klonaris found some curious analogies between<br>stacks of fifths in that notation system and what look on the keyboard like<br>open-position diminished triads in 12TET.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 20 Oct 1996 19:18 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04314; Sun, 20 Oct 1996 19:20:20 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04317<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id KAA05887; Sun, 20 Oct 1996 10:20:17 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 20 Oct 1996 10:20:17 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.95.961020131635.18770F-100000@freenet2.afn.org><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
