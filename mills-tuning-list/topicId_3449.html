So I would go a step beyond odd/prime and allow as how<br>>evenness can't be ignored in this either -- it all just seems to boil<br>>down to how many partials are involved and how faint and far out in the<br>>spectrum they are.<br><br>I have to agree. The "integer-limit" seems an even better<br>characterization of harmonic fusion. However, given the pervasiveness of<br>octave equivalence on the level of musical composition, the<br>considerations that go into designing a tuning system should typically<br>consider all inversions and extensions of an interval to be an<br>equivalence class. Thus the odd-limit concept gains its practical<br>relevance.<br><br>But see the "BUT" below.<br><br>Gary wrote,<br><br>>I personally am pretty much a fence-sitter on the prime vs. odd<br>>question, but perhaps it's worth asking:  Do you perceive that there's any<br>>mechanism in our auditory system for detecting powers of two (i.e.,<br>>octaves)?  If so, then why not powers of three or five?<br><br>There does seem to be a brain-based mechanism for detecting powers of<br>two, even in some animals exposed to pure sine waves. It may be that as<br>a way of efficiently processing auditory information, the factor of two<br>was chosen by evolution as a period of repetition; that way, (a) the<br>redundant information contained in the 2nd, 4th, 8th, etc. partials need<br>not confuse the system; and (b) the pitch space is reduced from some 10<br>octaves down to one octave, feasible since any particular stimulus<br>(especially a given human voice) tends to stay within a one-octave range<br>anyway.<br><br>BUT, I read that the cochlea actually winds around once per octave. If<br>there is any cross-stimulation between one turn of the cochlea and<br>adjacent ones, then there is a mechanism for at least some degree of<br>octave equivalence even on the level of the auditory stimulus, which<br>would of course affect harmonic fusion as well as pitch recognition. If<br>such a phenomenon exists, then there is no reason to postulate a<br>brain-based mechanism for recognizing powers of two.<br><br>Ken wrote,<br><br>>However this was a very narrowly defined exercise concentrating only<br>>on beating, roughness and harmonic fusion, without addressing any<br>>other aspects of interval recognition, such as whether it's easier to<br>>tune a 15/8 than a 13/7 based on affect, and if so, why.  On the prime/odd <br>>controversy, I'm still an agnostic.  I've certainly noticed how 7, 11 and<br>>13 sound exotic to me and 9 and 15 sound familiar, but just why that is,<br>>I haven't decided.<br><br>Fair enough. I attribute this familiarity to the diatonic grammar with<br>which we were brought up. This grammar is very powerful and has some<br>amazing properties, as I point out in my paper. The psychological effect<br>of these properties is profound. 7 and 11 are usually not understandable<br>in terms of this grammar and so sound exotic, regardless of the degree<br>of harmonic fusion of these intervals.</div>
