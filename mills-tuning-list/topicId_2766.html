By 'worthless' I do not mean 'morally<br>reprehensible' or 'indicating criminal insanity in those who use them'.<br>I mean that certain temperaments grossly reduce the number of<br>expressible, distinct melodies as compared with other temperaments _or_<br>deprive us of even so much consonant harmony as is found in the senario.<br>(I find septimal intervals quite valuable as dissonances, but happen to<br>believe the senario includes all consonance... that is another subject<br>though.) Actually, every one of the worthless temperaments that have<br>some following (17- 22- 29- 34- 41- & 53-tone equal) impoverish _both_<br>melody and harmony. This is too complex to even begin to prove here.<br>This will have to wait for its own post.<br><br>Some assume that every system has at least a few interesting features,<br>and therefore, I presume, that music should use an infinity of different<br>temperaments, with perhaps the best (if they can bring themselves to<br>make any judgements at all) enjoying slightly greater use. This is the<br>opposite error to that made by previous generations of theorists, who<br>with the enormous resources of the 19-tone equal staring them in the<br>face, looked at its flat fifth for a second or two, dismissed this<br>temperament without taking five minutes to inquire if this could be<br>remedied, and went on to lose themselves in the serpentine coils of 53<br>tones in the octave. I am thinking of Ellis in particular, but thousands<br>more made the same mistake. Every generation seems to delight in making<br>the opposite mistakes from those made by its predecessors.<br><br>This universal, unconditional tolerance betrays an astounding naivet?<br>about human nature, and also about musical reality. For those who<br>haven't noticed, 12-tone equal rules our musical life perhaps more than<br>any musical system has ever tyrannized over a culture. One is reminded<br>of the Chinese with their sacred bamboo pipes and later, their edicts<br>against wicked temperers of the pythagorean scale. Those who expect<br>instrument-makers to provide us with thirty different fundamentally<br>different kinds of guitar or keyboard or oboe, and who imagine music<br>teachers will be found to instruct pupils on them, inhabit the happy<br>realm of Faerie, where all things are possible.<br><br>Happily however, anyone who dispassionately investigates the subject of<br>temperament with the view to expanding our musical resources will at<br>once (I mean, after 10 years or so) find one temperament - and one only<br>- that _dramatically_ expands the melodic and harmonic resources of the<br>12-tone equal... and of just intonation as well! This is 19-tone equal.<br><br>I would like to now begin to explore why this is so, at least in<br>outline. Here we have a temperament that opens up to us an immense world<br>of enharmonic melody, to begin with. This, as the great theorist<br>Francisco Salinas long ago noted, is the _only_ system that does so, for<br>it alone provides us with an interval, the 1/3 tone, that is wide enough<br>to always effect a change in melody when a given melodic member is<br>altered thereby, but narrow enough never to be confused with the<br>diatonic semitone.<br><br>To give some idea of just how immense this universe is - and remember<br>these are _real_, usable resources, not purely theoretical, aurally<br>imperceptible variations - compare the number of modes (I here use the<br>term loosely merely to indicate a collection of seven notes used in a<br>melody) consisting of 12 notes taken 7 at a time:<br><br>nCr   where n = 12   &   r = 7<br>= 792<br>with the number of modes consisting of 19 notes taken 7 at a time:<br>nCr    where n = 19  &  r = 7<br>= 50,388<br>Most of the difference consists of 19-tone enharmonic modes. Later, if<br>there is an interest, I will provide some summaries of some of my<br>studies of chromatic modes (those modes that are neither enharmonic nor<br>diatonic) which should make it clear that in that respect as well, the<br>19-tone equal is far, far richer melodically than the 12-tone equal.<br><br>The harmonic contrast between 12- & 19-tone equal is no less dramatic.<br>It is not merely that 19-tone gives much more consonant chords. It also<br>gives much more powerfully, wrenchingly<br>_dissonant_ chords. These are not whining, commatically mistuned<br>consonances such as one finds in 53-tone equal, but outright dissonances<br>that possess full _melodic_ independence from any consonance. This power<br>of the 19-tone dissonances is obvious when one recalls that the<br>augmented primes, augmented & diminished fifths, and augmented &<br>diminished octaves of the 19-tone equal are roughly 1/3 tone from the<br>just consonances, instead of about 1/2 tone as in the case of the<br>12-tone dissonances, and consequently much more dissonant. These 19-tone<br>dissonances happen to fall in precisely the most dissonant regions that<br>surround these most powerful consonances. One proof of this is<br>Helmholtz' famous graph of the smoothness of violin tone; when the<br>19-tone dissonances are superimposed thereon it will be found as I have<br>observed above.<br><br>12-tone equal has weakly consonant, rather simpering chords and weakly<br>dissonant chords; the contrast between the two classes is feeble, and<br>the overall effect leaves the heart stone-cold. It is scarcely<br>surprising that under the leaden weight of such a temperament, harmony<br>has fallen into disrepute.<br><br>19-tone equal has, especially if its octave is stretched by two or three<br>cents to equalize the roughness of its fifths and fourths, extremely<br>smooth consonances. The fourth is scarcely more sensitive to mistuning<br>than the third, for reasons having to do with beating partials present<br>in the fourth. Consequently one can mistune the fourth much more than<br>the fifth without noticeably impairing its consonance. The consonances<br>of the 19-tone equal are just mistuned enough to be brilliant, but of<br>course not quite so smooth or quiet as those of just intonation.<br><br>Hence, 19-tone equal gives rise to a powerful contrast between<br>consonance and dissonance, both melodically and harmonically speaking.<br>The effect is to give music a kind of elastic, forward impetus quite<br>unknown in the 12-tone equal, which has a more static, uncertain<br>esthetic.<br><br>This contrast between consonance and dissonance affects the emotions<br>very poignantly. Composers with a reputation for formalism or mannerism<br>such as Gesualdo, Haydn and Mozart seem bursting with suppressed<br>vitality in the 19-tone equal. Gesualdo in particular is virtually a<br>different - and a far better - composer in the 19-tone equal, lending<br>credence to the story that he owned a 19-tone clavier (not necessarily,<br>but quite possibly more or less equally tempered.)<br><br>No other temperament, and certainly not the 31-tone equal with its<br>continual problems of interval confusion in melody, can remotely compare<br>to the 19-tone equal for sheer tension and force.<br><br>In a famous passage, Fokker has spoken of 31-tone equal having two<br>faces, one turned to the past, one to the future. This is far, far more<br>profoundly true of the 19-tone equal. For the 19-tone equal, at the same<br>time that it renders the ancestral music of our own culture more present<br>to the imagination and the emotions, also opens up to us the unsuspected<br>melodic riches both of rock music and of non-Western cultures, of which<br>the former however is of more vital concern to our own people than the<br>latter. For any song that can be sung and reliably reproduced by<br>singers, can be notated and played in 19-tone equal. This is a<br>consequence of the fact that, providentially, the human melodic limen<br>(55-60 cents) is just narrower than the tuning degree of 19-tone equal<br>(~63 cents).<br>This may not, by the way, be _entirely_ providential. Our species may<br>have evolved as a 19-tone-equal and 5-limit interpreter of musical<br>experience. I merely suggest this by the way... obviously this is very<br>speculative.<br><br>All this means that, for the first time, this temperament permits us<br>to notate all musical traditions - especially our own living, popular,<br>rock tradition - with as much precision as singers (and listeners) can<br>reliably reproduce (and esthetically understand) their own native<br>melodies.<br><br>All this is very exciting, and at least merits determined<br>popularization. I make no doubt that popular, Renaissance, and classical<br>musicians alike have very much to gain from the commercial development<br>of 19-tone instruments. The academic 12-tone equal abortions of our<br>century are of no concern. Undoubtedly the museums could preserve a few<br>12-tone instruments so that the odd musicologue could study these<br>compositions, if he has nothing better to do.<br><br>Instead of embracing the 19-tone equal temperament however, we seem,<br>mostly through ignorance (the subject of temperament is at once very<br>difficult, and poorly remunerated, and so progress has been slow) but<br>partly from less excusable motives, more concerned to endlessly prove<br>how better we are at hearing than the poor, stupid masses.<br><br>Thank God we are all so wise.<br><br>But among those masses are popular musicians, some of whom have more<br>creativity in their little fingers than many a whole conservatory.<br>Certain of the most creatively sterile academic composers are the most<br>eager, either to perpetuate the 12-tone equal as some kind of apostolic<br>chrism, or else to have us adopt some utterly lifeless, dissonant,<br>emotionally neutral temperament, whose only claim to recognition is the<br>certainty that no paying, demanding audience would ever sit still to<br>hear such aimless, random impudence for five minutes. In other words,<br>they seem to adopt temperaments other than 12-tone equal only as a means<br>to out-Schoenberging Schoenberg.<br><br>I would like to emphasize however that our 12-tone equal mandarins are<br>far more malevolent (as will as far more powerful) than our most<br>inconsequent microtonal devotees. Absurdities that everyone politely<br>ignores are harmless, and beneath the civilized to condemn; it is<br>absurdities enshrined in dogma that stunt and maim.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Bob Lee" <quasar@wco.com><br>Subject:  Singing small intervals<br>PostedDate:  13-12-97 08:35:43<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  13-12-97 08:33:45-13-12-97 08:33:45,13-12-97 08:33:28-13-12-97 08:33:28<br>DeliveredDate:  13-12-97 08:33:28<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656C.00298987; Sat, 13 Dec 1997 08:35:38 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14408; Sat, 13 Dec 1997 08:35:43 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 13 Dec 1997 08:35:43 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14411<br>Received: (qmail 20965 invoked from network); 12 Dec 1997 23:35:40 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 12 Dec 1997 23:35:40 -0800<br>Message-Id: <01bd0799$17c948e0$1f379bce@default><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
