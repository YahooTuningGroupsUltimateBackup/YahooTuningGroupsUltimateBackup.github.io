If the chord occurs as a result of<br>>simultaneous melodic lines in a piece of music, I don't think you're right,<br>>unless you'd allow 20 cents to be considered a few cents. If you're listening-<br><br>>for beats, then yes, you're exactly right.<br><br>I was thinking in terms of 2 or 3 cents.  You do have to listen<br>pretty hard for the difference, but it's there.  By the time<br>you get to 20 cents, the detuning is instantly obvious with the<br>most sensitive timbres.  I wouldn't allow a tonic to be out of<br>tune by this amount.<br><br>>3, 5 and 7 are successive odd numbers, so I don't think one has to resort to<br>>12tet to explain the increasing dissonance of their respective intervals<br>>(which I clearly hear).<br><br>I wouldn't like to say whether 4:5:6 or 4:6:7 is more consonant<br>in my schismic tuning.  Both, though, are a lot better than<br>4:5:7.  Either this is a result of the poor 7/5, or the odd<br>limit is not a perfect discriminator of consonance.  If my<br>soundcard's behaving itself, 7/5 should only be out by 5 cents.<br>The dissonance of 4:5:7 is very obvious.  I'm using the "Chorused<br>Piano" preset at the moment, but I hear the same effect with<br>others.<br><br>In 31tet, the 7/4 has an unpleasant ring to it, which may be a<br>result of its purity.  "Vibraphone" illustrates this well.  I<br>conclude, therefore, that the minutiae of tuning are more<br>important than the difference between the residual dissonances<br>of the 5- and 7-axes.  This is all subjective, so you're<br>welcome to disagree with me.  I expect to see some evidence of<br>what you're listening to, though.<br><br>A definition of consonance you ask?  I can only give an example.<br>the purity an interval of 702 cents posesses that a randomly<br>chosen interval does not -- that's consonance.<br><br>>Right. If an n:1 frequency ratio is tuned too purely in sustained harmonic<br>>timbres, the upper note will disappear.<br><br>In 12TET the octaves are, of course, pure.  I'm sure this has<br>a lot to do with why octaves are treated differently to other<br>overtones, but I don't want to get into that at the moment.<br><br>I was more thinking that the blurred sound of 12TET is suited<br>to some music -- easy listening, cocktail jazz, that sort of<br>thing.  Also, I sometimes hear unpleasant things in the upper<br>harmonics with the nearest I can get to JI.<br><br>I wouldn't go this far, though:<br><br>> But there's nothing conceptually wrong, as far as I can see, with saying<br>> that two intervals whose difference is less than the ear's accuracy are<br>> musically the same.  This is the only way Canright's "all intervals" can be<br>> "just".<br><br>The range of musical similarity is _much_ wider than the accuracy<br>of the ear for the tuning of chords.<br><br><br>The following statement of Paul Erlich's is entirely correct:<br><br>>... the probability that two physical strings are tuned<br>>to a rational inteval is zero, as Cantor showed...<br><br>As a general rule, there's no such thing in the real world as<br>integer relationships of continuous quantities.  Entrainment<br>only goes so far.<br><br>However, by the same argument, this is wrong:<br><br>> _Bowed_<br>> strings, however, if bowed at a constant speed and pressure, are<br>> perfectly harmonic, since they undergo exactly the same motion (analysed<br>> by Helmholtz) in each slip-stick cycle.<br><br>Never say "perfect" -- say _how_ imperfect!<br><br>Turning to this,<br><br>> It must be something else, then, that causes additive patches to sound more<br>> like violins when you detune the harmonics.<br><br>I suggest that "something else" is vibrato.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  William Sethares <sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Subject:  a definition of sensory dissonance<br>PostedDate:  29-10-97 21:06:07<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  29-10-97 21:05:04-29-10-97 21:05:05,29-10-97 20:05:37-29-10-97 20:05:38<br>DeliveredDate:  29-10-97 20:05:38<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125653F.006E52B4; Wed, 29 Oct 1997 21:05:01 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA31013; Wed, 29 Oct 1997 21:06:07 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 29 Oct 1997 21:06:07 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29740<br>Received: (qmail 25593 invoked from network); 29 Oct 1997 12:06:04 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 29 Oct 1997 12:06:04 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199710292003.AA19549@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
