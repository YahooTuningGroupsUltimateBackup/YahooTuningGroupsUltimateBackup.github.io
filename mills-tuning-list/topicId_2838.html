No matter what one's particular bias, matters such as the<br>optimal temperature of the octave are determinable using objective<br>criteria. Your figures for relative consonance, in particular for those<br>of the 22-tone equal, are however utterly incorrect, for, as I have<br>tried to demonstrate to you - and this is by no means a difficult matter<br>to understand - that temperament is noncyclic. You cannot blithely<br>assign the closest values to all consonances when evaluating the<br>consonance of a noncyclic temperament, for in such systems these<br>consonances do not exist together either in diatonic music (which you<br>have admitted) nor yet in chromatic or enharmonic music, which also<br>require a modicum of consonance and tonal coherence. I formerly made the<br>same error which you are making, but had no one to tell me so; I was<br>forced to discover this for myself.<br><br>In the present case, it is _not_ all the consonances that are<br>_ultimately_ relevant to the determination of the amount by which the<br>19-tone equal octave can or should be tempered, even though I have<br>considered them all, as a kind of courtesy to Fokker, and a<br>demonstration that all of them have to be considered initially. For,<br>finally, the fourth cannot be tempered by much more than 8.4 cents and<br>remain satisfactory, i.e no more deteriorated than the more sensitive<br>fifth at 5.7 cents deviation, and no less consonant than 5:3 or 5:4.<br>This puts a limit on the permissible temperature of the octave, as does<br>the fifteenth, I need not tell you why.<br><br>You should be very chary of reducing congruence with consonances to<br>percentages in the facile manner you have done. This is a habit of<br>thought that too often leads one to overlook many important factors. A<br>rigorous mathematical calculation of all the important factors is<br>certainly beyond you; it is also as yet beyond anyone. But it is<br>unnecessary to spend 300 years with the equations to know a good or bad<br>temperament when one hears and sees one.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  William Sethares <sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Subject:  melodic lemons<br>PostedDate:  18-12-97 16:53:59<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  18-12-97 16:51:57-18-12-97 16:51:58,18-12-97 16:51:34-18-12-97 16:51:35<br>DeliveredDate:  18-12-97 16:51:35<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256571.00572414; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 16:53:45 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29663; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 16:53:59 +0100<br>Date: Thu, 18 Dec 1997 16:53:59 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29656<br>Received: (qmail 23243 invoked from network); 18 Dec 1997 07:53:55 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 18 Dec 1997 07:53:55 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199712181551.AA24698@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
