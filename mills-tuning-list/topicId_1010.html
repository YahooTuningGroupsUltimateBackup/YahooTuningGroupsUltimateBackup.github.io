Rasch examined tunings in which <br>> intervals and their inversions had the same beat rate (e.g. 1/4 comma <br>> in which the major third and minor 6th have 0 beats). In 1991 I <br>> decided to examine other temperaments in which pairs of non-<br>> inversionally related intervals had the same beat rate. I was able <br>> to find solutions for 9 such tunings. I also found fractional comma <br>> approximations for them as well.<br><br>I think only 2 are correct.<br><br>>     E.B.
