Thanks, Gary!<br><br>However, I disagree. Syntonic comma may be defined algebraically and then<br>applied to any tuning system in which that formula makes sense. To say,<br>for example, that 53-tET has no syntonic comma isn't helpful. Sure it's<br>tempered, but so are all ET intervals, including the perfect fifth, a term<br>which is not restricted to 3/2 in common usage. What's so special about<br>81/80?<br><br>I know we've been over this before, but I think I'm being consistent. As<br>far as I'm concerned, anyone is welcome to talk about quartertones in<br>31-tET; you just won't find them in the tuning.<br><br>Any JI term that has an ET equivalent is probably OK to use in the<br>tempered sense, as long as that use is understood. This is where<br>"quartertone" is different: it's already a tempered term.<br><br>Your turn, Gary.<br><br>Paul Rapoport<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  kukula@synopsys.com<br>Subject:  Natural Harmony<br>PostedDate:  12-08-97 22:44:12<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  12-08-97 22:44:14-12-08-97 22:44:15,12-08-97 22:42:37-12-08-97 22:42:38<br>DeliveredDate:  12-08-97 22:42:38<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564F1.0071E612; Tue, 12 Aug 1997 22:44:13 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00459; Tue, 12 Aug 1997 22:44:12 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 12 Aug 1997 22:44:12 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00457<br>Received: (qmail 20733 invoked from network); 12 Aug 1997 20:31:59 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 12 Aug 1997 20:31:59 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199708122027.NAA05498@sunatg3><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5964 href="#5964">ðŸ”—</a>DMB5561719@aol.com</h3><span>8/14/1997 5:32:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>In a message dated 97-08-13 15:43:48 EDT,<br>Denis.Atadan@mvs.udel.edu writes:<br><br>>  It seems a number of you need a bit more time to get your materials<br>together.<br>><br>>  Originally I put a deadline of a postmark of 15 august 1997.
