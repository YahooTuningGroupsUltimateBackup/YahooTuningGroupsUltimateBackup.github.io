I would refer those people to the following:<br><br>Canright, David. "A Justly Tuned Guitar", 1/1 vol. 2 no. 2, 1986, pp.<br>8-11.<br><br>Darreg, Ivor.

Try looking for a used EPS-16, they tend to go for<br>$7500-$1000. In fact if you're interested I know someone who's selling one.<br>They don't support MTS but are supported by JICalc for downloading tunings.<br>Likewise some inexpensive keyboards have scaling of keyboard-pitch<br>modulation- you can change this to get N equal tones per octave. <br><br>That Kawai probably does support temperaments- these assume an<br>octave-repeating tuning with a +-50 cents variation per note.  Most<br>'tunable' samplers, even expensive ones, use this system.  Ensoniq's<br>EPS/ASR, VFX/TS, KT and MR let you tune any key to any other MIDI note with<br>an offset.<br><br>>   Whether it is or not, it's almost certainly your best bet for a machine that<br>>implements the MIDI tuning standard. <br><br>In terms of MTS the MR series is the only game in town.  We're shipping the<br>keyboard with sequencer version and it should be in stores soon if anyone<br>want to check it out.<br><br>Steve Curtin<br>Ensoniq Corp<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 27 Jun 1996 21:04 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA02108; Thu, 27 Jun 1996 12:04:12 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 27 Jun 1996 12:04:12 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v02130500adf8829a2f06@[192.168.11.201]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
