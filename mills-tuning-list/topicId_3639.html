But here are a couple of drive-by comments:<br><br>I've generated a couple more consistency tables, and the best candidates<br>I've spotted so far for synthesizers are probably 1224 (2^3 * 3^2 * 17)<br>and 1848 (2^3 * 3 * 7 * 11).  You can see their consistency levels at<br>various limits at <http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote/consist4.txt>.<br><br>It's diameter, not radius, please, and yes, an ET having a diameter less<br>than or equal to its consistency level is a desirable property in my<br>book.  I think of it being "quasi-JI-like", in a way.<br><br>It's kind of hard to represent on a 2D screen with ASCII characters what<br>I would do with a 4D 9-limit lattice, but here's a go:<br><br>    10/9 --- 5/3 --- 5/4<br>     / \     / \10/7 / \<br>    /   \   /   \   /   \<br>   /14/9 \ / 7/6 \ / 7/4 \<br>16/9 --- 4/3 --- 1/1 --- 3/2 --- 9/8<br>           \ 8/7 / \12/7 / \ 9/7 /<br>            \   /   \   /   \   /<br>             \ / 7/5 \ /     \ /<br>             8/5 --- 6/5 --- 9/5<br><br>This is a projection of part of the 3D 7-limit lattice into a plane.<br>The triangles are in the 3-5 plane, and the ratios inside the triads are<br>either one layer above or below depending on whether they're inside<br>major or minor triads.  This shows all pitches separated from the 1/1 by<br>intervals I consider consonant or primary within the 9-limit; however,<br>without drawing lines which intersect and become confusing I can't<br>draw lines for all those intervals, even when I'm not restricted to<br>ASCII art.  Several of the 9-limit intervals look like secondaries<br>instead of primaries when represented this way.  In 4 dimensions it<br>would look like this:<br><br>                     5/3 --- 5/4<br>                     / \10/7 / \<br>    10/9            /   \   /   \         3/2 --- 9/8<br>     / \           / 7/6 \ / 7/4 \          \ 9/7 /<br>    /   \        4/3 --- 1/1 --- 3/2         \   /<br>   /14/9 \         \ 8/7 / \12/7 /            \ /<br>16/9 --- 4/3        \   /   \   /             9/5<br>                     \ / 7/5 \ /<br>                     8/5 --- 6/5<br><br>The tetrad on the left would be the 3D layer "below" the middle one in<br>4D space, and the one on the right the layer "above".  All primary<br>9-limit intervals could then be seen as being one step away from the<br>origin.
