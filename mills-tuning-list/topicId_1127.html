(Actually he had help from Ernie<br>Crews on the tabla.)  <br><br>   I suspect that others will report on the microtonal gig in El Paso this past<br>weekend, but here's mine.  <br><br>   The short version is that most of the audience was new to unusual tunings, it<br>was fun, and it sure was great to meet all of these people, many for the first<br>time, and others after a long time.  <br><br>   Flavor the descriptions you're about to hear with the fact that these were<br>presented in a gallery about the size of a large strip-mall store.  It has two<br>rooms.  As you face the stage, if you can call it that, the room on the right<br>has that stage, and in the adjoining room Erv Wilson and others have setup<br>displays of tubulongs among other things.  <br><br>   The first night Neil Haverstick played a couple of pieces, the first on<br>classical 34-tone guitar with Ernie Crews accompanying him.  That improv sounded<br>to me like what would have happened if India had invaded Spain instead of the<br>Moors.  It had a decidedly Ravi-Shankar-like sound to it, but the timbre was<br>clearly that of a Spanish guitar rather than a sitar or veena for example.  Neil<br>then played a solo on his 19-tone guitar, using a Roland guitar synth and<br>several delay pedals.  With all of the delays, he stopped actually generating<br>more notes about 3 minutes before he finished the performance, which was pretty<br>wild.  This improv he appropriately described as "space music".  <br><br>   I get the impression that about half of the audience was entraced or at least<br>interested by Neil's two pieces (I would guess that they lasted about 25 minutes<br>each), and the other half was looking for something a little closer to top 40.  <br><br>   In the afternoon of the second (and last) day, Erv Wilson, then Jonathan<br>Glasier, then Neil Haverstick, and then again Erv Wilson, put on "workshops".<br>Erv Wilson's first presentation highlighted his simultanous harmonic/subharmonic<br>tuning, which I believe was just a 90-degree flip of one of Denny Genovese's<br>student's diamond marimbas.  He illustrated it using a composition by Warren<br>Burt (on tape;  El Paso is a tad far away for Warren!).  As I recall, it was a<br>semirandomish sort of thing in a typical electronic timbre, if such a thing<br>exists.  <br><br>   Jonathan then did his workshop on "vocal harmonics", wherein he would sing<br>the bass line with his voice, and simultaneously kinda-sorta whistle the melody<br>line - whistling in the sense of carefully shaping his mouth to resonate one<br>harmonic of that bass note.  Even though he wasn't whistling as such, it sounded<br>kind of like that.  Jonathan is very good at it, and can pick out a harmonic<br>nearly as powerfully as an old-time analog synthesizer's lowpass filter with the<br>resonance turned way up.  Everybody seemed to enjoy that demo a lot.  Jonathan<br>then demonstrated an autoharp retuned to harmonics (by matching to his vocal<br>harmonics only by the way), and then played the m'bira he built patterned after<br>one of Bill Wesley's instruments.  You could think of it as the most ungodly<br>HEEEyyuuuuuuge kalimba you've ever seen.  It had a resonating box roughly the<br>size, but not shape, of that of a 'cello, and I would estimate about 100 tynes.<br><br><br>   Neil Haverstick then took the reins, and gave a very effective lecture on<br>what I suppose I'd characterize as the general nature of microtonal ideas from<br>his perspective, which is mostly that of a street-wise microtonal ET performer,<br>and a very entertaining one at that.  He has a quite effective stage presence,<br>both in playing and in speaking.  I can't recall exactly how it went from there,<br>but Jonathan and Erv also contributed to that toward the end as well.  <br><br>   Oh, I almost forgot!  Rod Poole then explained his nifty 17-toned JI guitar<br>tuning.  It was based upon a circle of fifths broken in several places, where at<br>each break he added in a new harmonic basis (I think it went something like 3,<br>then 5, then 13, then 11, then 7, but I can't recall for sure).  He performed a<br>couple of (comparatively) short improvs in that tuning.  <br><br>   After that, still in the Saturday-afternoon session, Erv told all about the<br>22- and 70-tone-per-octave JI tubulongs he had in the adjoining room.  But<br>before he did that, he played a corporate propaganda tape by Justonic Tuning<br>Inc.  I had spoken with Rex Weyler before, but I didn't have much feel for how<br>serious a company they were.  It seems likely from the tape and from Erv<br>Wilson's impressions, that they're very real and very determined to get their<br>automatically justifying synthesizers out on the market.  Erv then briefly<br>described the 22-toned JI tuning, and played a tape of another three<br>compositions by Warren Burt illustrating successively more complex harmony<br>within this tuning, starting with a limit of 7, and ending with 31, the latter<br>of which sounded to me to have a lot of out-of-tune unisons and octaves.<br>Stylistically, for lack of any more specific way to decribe it in words, I'd<br>call it a semirandom piano composition.  <br><br>   After that, I (unscheduled) attempted to throw in a short presentation about<br>88CET, but we kinda ran out of time.  Rod Poole seemed especially interested,<br>but then again, by that time there were only about six people left (this had<br>been going on for several hours).  <br><br>   That evening, Rod Poole played a long, and very intriguing-sounding<br>partly-improvised/partly-composed composition on his 17-toned JI guitar.  I<br>would describe it as being - speaking in broad generalities - a little like the<br>typical Philip-Glass-like minimalist.  A lot of it consisted of short figures<br>(e.g., fast arpeggios) that repeated many times, but slowly evolved over time.<br>Each time he would put a new note into that evolutionary sweepstakes, I found<br>myself cocking my head sideways like a dog encountering a strange phenomenon<br>it's never seen before.  Jonathan then did a presentation somewhat like his<br>workshop contents, but in a much more concert-like idiom.  That's where he<br>positively floored everbody with his didjeridu boogie!  <br><br>   If there was a bad point about the concert portions of this gig, it almost<br>certainly would be that there wasn't a stage.  For various practical reasons,<br>Neil and others had to sit on the floor during their performances, so, for all<br>realistic purposes, nobody beyond about the third row could see the performance.<br>Not good.  <br><br>   Oh, by the way, Rod Poole did get an excellent DAT recording of the music,<br>and a TV camera crew from one of the local stations was there too.  It was to be<br>aired Sunday night, but I didn't stay to see it (I'm back in Austin now).  <br><br>   Thanks go to Sonja Wayne (not on the tuning list) for putting it on.  I think<br>if I understand the story correctly, it originated when Neil Haverstick wanted<br>to visit some relatives in El Paso, noticed that Sonja lived there, gave here a<br>buzz, one thing led to another, and next thing ya knew, they had a multimedia<br>event!  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 09:38 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03947; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 09:39:30 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03952<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id AAA06652; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 00:39:28 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 11 Nov 1996 00:39:28 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199611110339_MC1-BDF-9BF7@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
