I've also managed to get undertones on my TX81Z.<br>I don't have it here to check, but I think setting the modulator<br>to about a third above the carrier does the trick.  It sounds<br>Trautonium-like, but I don't know if there's a full undertone<br>series or not.<br><br>Are any of these software synthesizers about to go microtonal<br>capable of imitating a Trautonium?  Those I've seen so far are<br>either geared towards subtractive synthesis, or too complicated<br>for me to work out.  So, I'm sticking with my AWE64 and pitch<br>bends, waiting for a Sound Font retuning program.<br><br>As the Trautonium is a naturally microtonal instrument, with unique<br>harmonic possibilities, someone should really think of emulating<br>it on a PC.  I would do it myself, but I've got too much else to<br>get around to.<br><br><br>                    Graham Breed<br>      gbreed@cix.co.uk        www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/</div>
