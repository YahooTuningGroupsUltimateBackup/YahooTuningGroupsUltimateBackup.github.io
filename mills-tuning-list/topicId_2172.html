In his words, the <br>content of:<br><br>The Microtonal Synthesis Home Page <br><br>     A listing of all synthesizers, samplers, sound cards and software <br>synthesizers capable of user programmable microtonal<br>     scales or tunings: just intonation, non-12 equal tempered, <br>well-tempered scales, xenharmonics, etc. Information on types<br>     and number of scales is also given. Samples of microtonal music <br>using modern electronic instruments can be found by<br>     checking out the artists in Recommended Listening <br><br>It seems quite useful, and the recommended listening could become a <br>valuable resource.<br><br>John Loffink's page is at<br>http://www.homefree.net/cgi-shl/dbml.exe?templateomefree/view.dbm&pageidy72<br><br><br>Later, gang.<br><br>John Starrett<br>http:/www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 27 Jun 1997 19:58 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13195; Fri, 27 Jun 1997 19:58:51 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 27 Jun 1997 19:58:51 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13175<br>Received: (qmail 18217 invoked from network); 27 Jun 1997 17:56:55 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 27 Jun 1997 17:56:55 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.970627114834.34063B-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5709 href="#5709">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>6/29/1997 11:13:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>I have always used the term "limit" as if it were really "prime<br>>limit", and I think I am probably not the only person who sees<br>>things this way.<br><br>   I too am inclined to see it as primes rather than odds, although I don't<br>claim to but a little bit of experimental basis for that.<br><br>   The underlying principle for using odds, as I understand it (this is<br>coming from Dave Hill who changed his opinion from primes to odds), is that<br>octaves duplicate harmony, so anything that doesn't involve a factor of two<br>will produce a nonduplicate harmony.<br><br>   That makes sense under the assumption that there are no recognizable and<br>compoundable qualities of 3, 5, 7, or other primes.  That is to say that,<br>for example stacks of 3:1s or of 5:1s, do NOT have distinctive properties<br>of their own other than the duplication property of two.  I think they do<br>based upon 27:16 compared to 5:3:  27:16, to my ears, still has the steely<br>cold, brazen sensation of a fifth or fourth, whereas 5:3 has a genuine<br>sweetness to it.<br><br>   But I personally am not very firmly commited to that premise.  I think<br>it's quite clear that two other qualities of an interval are much more<br>significant than this prime- or odd-number basis idea:<br>*  The size of the interval.  No matter factors you put into a major sixth<br>   they'll all be much more alike than any tritone for example.<br>*  The simplicity of the frequency relationship (ratio) they come closest to.<br><br>   And "closest to" here is another question, and a complex one.  It<br>harkens WAAAAAAYYY back to a conversation on the list a long time ago<br>shortly after I joined, about how far off you can be from a given ideal<br>ratio before it becomes clearly something else in its own right rather than<br>a "bad" version of that interval.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 29 Jun 1997 22:19 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA20959; Sun, 29 Jun 1997 22:20:05 +0200<br>Date: Sun, 29 Jun 1997 22:20:05 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA20896<br>Received: (qmail 9253 invoked from network); 29 Jun 1997 20:19:48 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 29 Jun 1997 20:19:48 -0000<br>Message-Id: <970629161837_-1327393451@emout08.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
