For me discovering THE MYTH OF INVARIANCE was<br>a big thrill. I'd been playing around with keyboard configurations for just<br>tuning, sketching out triangular patterns on a plane - then to open up<br>McClain and see the very same patterns, associated with Plato, the Vedic<br>Rishis, etc. Grand fun. Of course now I seem them pratically every day on<br>this list, and lots more. Amazing!<br><br>A bit off the tuning front, but still... David Fideler's JESUS CHRIST, SUN OF<br>GOD has lots of numerology. One main focus as I recall is on rational<br>approximants to the square root of three. The book explores the influence of<br>Platonism on Christianity in the first few centuries after Christ.<br><br>There's a delightful debate we often circle around - is "harmony" some<br>absolute property, a basic structure of the universe? Or perhaps it's some<br>built-in property of human beings, like having five fingers. Perhaps<br>sea-slugs find octaves discordant? Or perhaps harmony is just some socially<br>trained language. Even if many cultures appreciate similar forms of harmony,<br>perhaps this is just due to millenia of inter-cultural musical exchange.<br><br>Tuning relates music to math. My background is physics, I work as an<br>engineer. Please excuse my crudity. But for the reductionist materialist<br>crowd I hang around with during the week, mathematics is something like the<br>foundation of truth. While music is more like an ornamental cornice. That's<br>one of the reasons I love the whole tuning affair. The mathematical structure<br>of music seems paradoxical from a materialistic engineering<br>perspective. I.e. it seems to highlight a defect or limitation of that<br>perspective.<br><br>Of course these days math has gotten pretty flipped out. I think it was<br>Kronecker back 100 years ago and more who thought the integers were God's<br>handiwork and all the rest human invention. Fits in well with the<br>Pythagoreans. The square root of two is just too wierd to comprehend.<br><br>Jim<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com<br>Subject:  RE: theories<br>PostedDate:  30-07-97 01:01:02<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  30-07-97 01:01:06-30-07-97 01:01:07,30-07-97 00:59:54-30-07-97 00:59:55<br>DeliveredDate:  30-07-97 00:59:55<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564E3.007E704A; Wed, 30 Jul 1997 01:01:02 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA25147; Wed, 30 Jul 1997 01:01:02 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 30 Jul 1997 01:01:02 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA25146<br>Received: (qmail 8631 invoked from network); 29 Jul 1997 22:59:31 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 29 Jul 1997 22:59:31 -0000<br>Message-Id: <c=US%a=_%p=Acadian-Asset%l=MARS-970729202244Z-2589@mars.acadian-asset.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5932 href="#5932">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>8/1/1997 9:09:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>The math involved in tuning theory is quite simple, really.
