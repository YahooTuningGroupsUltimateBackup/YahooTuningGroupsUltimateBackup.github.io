Each ASM module stores four complete 128-note tuning<br>tables. Each patch is stored with one of the tables already selected (or<br>with equal temperament). The tuning resolution is an astonishing 512<br>increments per half-step, or about .2 cent.<br>   "Just as astonishing: In tests with a stripped-down test tone patch, we<br>could hear that that fine resolution really existed, and was stable from one<br>hardware voice to another. When we played a two-note interval and adjusted<br>the intonation of one of the notes, we could hear the rate of beating<br>between overtones increasing very gradually." <br>   I haven't done any testing of my own. But regardless of the actual<br>resolution, I do enjoy having four user-tuning tables in an analog sound module.<br>   <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 9 Oct 1996 07:24 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01208; Wed, 9 Oct 1996 07:26:11 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01197<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id WAA28197; Tue, 8 Oct 1996 22:26:08 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 8 Oct 1996 22:26:08 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01540b12ae80e4bd60e5@[131.172.160.53]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
