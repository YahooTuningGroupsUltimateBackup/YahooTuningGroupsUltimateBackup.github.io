Oh, sit down, you in the back.  I realize that this is<br>an informal forum for public opinion, but I look back over the last<br>couple of days' postings and wish that I had prepared the material in a<br>more rigorous way (a paper or presentation or some such); I respect the<br>writings I have seen in the list before my joining the fray.  Oh well, it<br>be writ.  I am richer for having heard other opinions (which I don't have<br>to agree with <g>) and am glad to have stirred the waters.  Hit it...<br><br>**********<br><br>What I would ask, of *all* who find value in the creative output of Mr.<br>Harry Partch, is to view his works in a different manner than most any<br>other composer, for Partch is certainly a unique case.  To constrain him,<br>and a constraint it is, to the concert hall in a concert setting is an<br>undeniable disservice to a larger view of "ritual-experience", a "basic<br>mutilation".  If Harry, save for "a few studies", viewed his music as<br>embodying "dramatic ideas", why would anyone choose to lessen it's impact<br>by presenting it in "the obsessive formality of the concert stage" or,<br>worse yet (by leaps and bounds), an adaptation for non-Partch<br>instruments?  These actions would, as Harry said, "deny fulfillment".  To<br>agree to such a request for integrity in belief and action would beget a<br>monumental undertaking, pointing towards a performance style that we in<br>the West Coast group were only part way down the road to.<br><br>The question has been raised as to the substantial, yet (at face value)<br>non-corporeal works such as the "Li Po" songs, the "Intrusions", and<br>similar.  As Partch's aesthetic of integrated disciplines evolved over<br>his lifetime, the later pieces he created came to embrace more of the<br>all-involving corporealism he had sought for many years, even as the<br>earlier, smaller pieces did not.  I have often thought that his ideal of<br>a corporeal performance could be 'backwards compatible'; a sensitive<br>staging of even the vocal and small ensemble works, with appropriate<br>settings, could serve to *enhance* their content, not detract from it.  A<br>difficult task, to be sure (without it seeming to be the tail wagging the<br>dog), but how wonderful it would be to see the "Li Po" done with the<br>instrumentalist intoning the texts himself.  "Barstow", while not<br>directly bearing a traditional story line, adapts itself well to having<br>players in the group be 'in character' and having different players<br>assume the singing/speaking roles.  With appropriate stage design,<br>costuming, etc., it lifts the piece to another place, someplace Partch<br>wanted to be.<br><br>I recall a performance of "U.S. Highball" done on one of our tours that<br>was staged in a similar manner, with an intermingling of<br>singer-actors-players.  After the performance, an audience member<br>commented that, having been a hobo himself, the evening reminded him of<br>not only the "sights and sounds of the road, but the smells, too!".  A<br>good justification for getting away from the "insane specialization"<br>Partch abhorred, and a way to avoid standard concert-hall presentations.<br>Somehow, this just doesn't jive with four people in a string quartet<br>backing up a 'singer', even if the notes, the text -- the music -- was<br>correctly rendered.  After all, the guy who wrote it told us: "I must<br>therefore decline to limit the dimensions of my rather intense beliefs by<br>the modernly specialized word 'music'".<br><br>In this light, it seems doubly injurious to the experience to promote his<br>'music' on non-Partch instruments.  They were so integral to the<br>development of the works themselves; even as the instrumental palette<br>expanded Partch reworked some of the older pieces (thanks to Dr. Philip<br>Blackburn we can hear some of those, and trace a trajectory).  It is<br>inconceivable to replace the "sculptural beauty" inherent to those<br>instruments.  If they were not such a critical component, could Harry<br>have stated:<br><br>    "And as for imaginative and sculptural forms of instruments, I have<br>    easily given as much time to this endeavor as to intonation".<br><br>Brian McLaren, who got me rolling on this, had his own 'revelation':<br><br>    "As a chronically unrepentant electronics gonzo, permit me a small<br>    confession: Yes, I finally built myself a duplicate of Harry Partch's<br>    Harmonic Canon I (minus Harry's bad design features).  And it sounds<br>    INCREDIBLE.  Johnny Reinhard has roundly chided me for slighting<br>    acoustic music.  Of course, he's right.  In the end, there's no<br>    substitute for live acoustic music played by good performers on real<br>    acoustic instruments.  The richness and subtlety of the sound is<br>    nonpareil. [...]  A universe of subtle & gorgeous xenharmonies lie<br>    within its bridges and pinblocks."<br><br>Not to mention the raw physicality that is transmitted (ideally) to the<br>audience, the musician-dancer-actor breaking the normal bindings of a<br>specialist-performer.  Quite a goal to shoot for: "magical-sounds, visual<br>form and beauty, experience-ritual".<br><br>I am well aware that none of Partch's instruments emerged from the womb<br>of creativity fully realized; some where created using the only materials<br>he could get his hands on, using his own carpentry and other 'skills';<br>all of this is pretty well documented elsewhere.  They were not meant for<br>the long haul; a good portion of my time was spent in repair and<br>replacement, and the ordeal of tuning them all was a constant ritual.<br>Could 'better' copies be made?  I'm certain of it.  Should copies be<br>made?  Sure, why not? (Not counting the cost, time, effort...hah!).<br>Would I have chucked all that work and replaced them with MalletKATS,<br>just-tuned samples and whatever other electronic devices seemed a<br>panacea?  Not bloody likely.  To do so, folks, is to truly, truly miss<br>the point.  And with only one set of instruments, it does indeed set up a<br>horrendously frustrating set of circumstances, for all of us.<br><br>I don't harbor any illusions about what will happen from here on out.  I<br>am, in spite of the depth of my respect for Partch and my years spent<br>with his works and creations, as powerless as any one of you in the<br>future uses (and abuses) of Partch's body of literature.  I can (and<br>will) speak out against those performances that, by their very nature,<br>diminish the very experiences that Partch hoped to propagate.  I can (and<br>will) speak out in favor of those people who do their utmost to ensure<br>that integrity and respect, with regard to Harry's own guidelines and<br>visions for his work, are the reason for laying mallet to bar, pick to<br>string.  Precious good it will do me, I imagine.  It has been a few years<br>now since I last played any of the pieces; I wish Harry had left us in a<br>different state than we are in.  That, however, is the real world, and we<br>have to deal with Harry in his own way, problematic, cantankerous, and a<br>pain-in-the-ass to the end.  Somehow, a way will be found, and to all<br>that care for more than frequencies in the air, Harry said: "This thing<br>began with the truth, and truth does exist."<br><br>**********<br><br>As an addendum, I offer these bits o' info.  For those of you that have<br>not visited the British Harry Partch Society Web site, it is a lot of fun<br>and a bit of information.  I urge you to join, if only because these guys<br>are doing a great job of spreading the word, and are being pretty<br>non-judgemental about it (not like me, huh?).  I especially draw your<br>attention to the July 1996 newsletter (which is not on the Web site yet),<br>because it contains writing far more eloquent and coherent than mine<br>regarding the Kronos "Barstow"; a must read.  I will be continuing my<br>activity in the tuning list (with a day or so off), email me if you have<br>questions outside of the issues raised in the forum, and I will try to<br>respond to all flames and bravos in a somewhat timely manner.  Last but<br>not least, I plan on having a very small Web site of my own up in a few<br>days, as kind of a clearinghouse for Partch-related info.  I'll post<br>something when it's running (anybody taking bets on if I get content on<br>the pages before Allen Strange <bg>)?
