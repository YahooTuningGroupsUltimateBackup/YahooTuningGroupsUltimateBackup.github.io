(There's at least one piece of music with this title--I don't<br>recall by whom.) Whether or not it's Chomsky's I can't recall--my days in<br>linguistics pretty much ended a few years after "Aspects of a Theory of<br>Syntax," which means nearly 30 years ago (unfortunately). <br><br>The ongoing conversation between Paul Erlich and me on this list may<br>continue--here or elsewhere--I've been out of town and very busy. I thank<br>him again for his insights... <br><br>The basic diagrams on Erv Wilson's CPSs may be found in Xenharmonikon 12. <br>Erv's article is short on explanation, however. His use of 1/1 may be <br>found at odds with Brian McLaren's, but there is nothing wrong with <br>fiddling with the ratios in a number of ways, as Brian points out.<br><br>My article on Erv's system in MusicWorks 60 is fairly rudimentary and <br>specific to one particular tuning. There's much it omits and much I <br>still don't know about the CPSs. Thanks to Brian for mentioning the article.<br><br>==========================      =================================<br>Dr. Paul Rapoport               e-mail:	rapoport@mcmaster.ca<br>SADM (Music)	                   tel: (+1) 905 529 7070, ext. 2 4217<br>McMaster University                fax: (+1) 905 527 6793<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 16 Aug 1996 14:25 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18979; Fri, 16 Aug 1996 15:07:59 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18964<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id GAA16777; Fri, 16 Aug 1996 06:07:21 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 16 Aug 1996 06:07:21 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960816130147_71670.2576_HHB62-16@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
