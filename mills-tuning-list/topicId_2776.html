Then there is a category<br>> beyond a some point when the chord loses its identity and cohesion and<br>> this I would call dissonance. But then this could just be my own little<br>> way of seeing things.I suppose many of you use a mathematical definition<br>> of consonance, comparing partials and such, that I wouldn't begin to<br>> understand, but I trust my ears.  The voicing of chords is also an<br>> important factor; 7:5 sounds magnificent when placed in the octave above<br>> a 4:5:6 chord, even a 4:5:6:7 chord, or an 8:9:10:12:14 chord.<br>> Erik Nauman<br>> ><br>When I say that the septimals are dissonant, I do not mean to imply that<br>I hate them. They can be quite charming, when used as dissonances. The<br>only dissonances that I hate are those so near to the consonances that<br>they sound like, and are, mistuned consonances.<br><br>You might enjoy trying the close approximation to the 25:18 interval of<br>the 19-tone equal (the augmented fourth). This interval sounds intensely<br>laid-back and weirdly cool - even more than the 7:5.<br><br>No one can go far wrong by trusting his own ears, provided he lives in<br>fear of his audience.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Re: re: 31-tone equal melodic progression<br>PostedDate:  14-12-97 04:26:30<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  14-12-97 04:24:32-14-12-97 04:24:33,14-12-97 04:24:15-14-12-97 04:24:15<br>DeliveredDate:  14-12-97 04:24:15<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656D.0012B704; Sun, 14 Dec 1997 04:26:21 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14817; Sun, 14 Dec 1997 04:26:30 +0100<br>Date: Sun, 14 Dec 1997 04:26:30 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14812<br>Received: (qmail 2529 invoked from network); 13 Dec 1997 19:26:27 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 13 Dec 1997 19:26:27 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3493B431.49F2@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
