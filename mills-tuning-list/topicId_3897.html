It was 10 days of communing with artists and<br>with humpback whales.<br><br>Maza Meze, a 9-person Arabic/Greek ensemble was the featured act and its<br>use of microtones was superb. I jammed with them several times and heard<br>them many other times.  I've their new CD which I continue playing along<br>with: yes bassoon fits beautifully with this ensemble of oud,<br>ney/clarinet, violin, percussion, 6 vocalists, and qanun/belly dancer.<br>They announced to the audience before one song, "This was starts on a<br>half-flat."<br><br>Toronto's Critical Band, lead by maker/guitarist John Gzowsky shared a<br>bill with Malcolm Goldstein.  Together they played 2 performances of Gayle<br>Young's "Black Bean Soup" with Gzowski in 19TET.  John Gzowsky actually<br>prefers Just and 31-TET for his own compositions, of which there were 3:<br>"Five Short Things", "145," and "Crackling Knuckles."  These and my solo<br>"Dune" for solo bassoon were done in Toronto's Music Gallery a couple of<br>years ago.<br><br>Also performed was Harry Partch's Barstow for which I intoned.  Garnet<br>Willis played chromelodeon in the form of 2 accordians and a<br>foot-controlled bellows system, while Gzowski built a Partch guitar, in an<br>electric instrument.  It was recorded for broadcast by CBC radio.<br><br>Becky Van Der Post, violinist/composer, collaborated with fiance Willis<br>for an exciting new work "Upon Reading a Ch8ild's Guide to Modern<br>Physics."<br><br>John Butcher of London, England was a featured saxophone soloist that<br>performed microtonally all the time, mainly as the result of extended<br>techniques and a fascination with physics (he has a PhD in physics).<br>He's a connection to London's "scene."<br><br>Hearing the lunch-time Harbor Symphonys was real fun.  Ships in St. John's<br>harbor had their ship's horns taken over my composers and performers for<br>short new works.  I counted 7.<br><br>Other highlights included Parisian Pierre Bastien's robot musicians, and<br>Garnet Willis' sound sculpture of 3 giant balloons that sang like whales<br>by way of magnets, et al.<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music	<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@idt.net<br>http://www.echonyc.com/~jhhl/AFMM</div>
