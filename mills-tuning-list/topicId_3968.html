Any thoughts? Worth<br>>purchasing?<br><br>I'm really happy that someone did all this long-needed research on Partch's<br>life. It is really illuminating and, for me, well worth it. Gilmore went<br>through land records, small town newspapers, and every other resource you<br>can think of to track down Partch's nomadic existence (even so, there are<br>some significant lacunae in his hobo period). Though the tone of the book<br>is always rather scholarly and detached, Gilmore also draws a good portrait<br>of Partch's personality, too, and helps the reader understand many of the<br>decisions that affected his life.<br><br>If you're looking for detailed information about his music, though, the<br>book, like most composer biographies, is a little disappointing. There is<br>some good background info on all his known pieces that usually goes beyond<br>mere liner notes, but little in the way of actual analysis. To be fair,<br>this was not part of Gilmore's goal, and his accomplishment is still<br>substantial.<br><br>Unfortunately, the unavailability of his scores and the difficulty of<br>rendering them in an easily-understood notation has made such analysis<br>infrequent, at least from what I've seen or heard about. Why doesn't<br>someone publish facsimilies of his scores, at least, with a guide to<br>reading them, so that we can just peruse his scores in libraries like every<br>other major composer of this century?<br><br>Bill<br><br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
