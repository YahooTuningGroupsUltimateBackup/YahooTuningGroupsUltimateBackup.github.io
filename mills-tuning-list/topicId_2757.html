So in<br>one sense it does not merge (or compromise between) the two species of<br>tone, but in another sense it does merge them, at a very unfortunate<br>excentric value.<br><br> In other terms, 22-tone equal eliminates the comma only to break the<br>back of the cycle of fifths, harmonically considered. It also reduces<br>the diatonic semitone from 112 cents to 55, and the chromatic semitone<br>it swells enormously from 71 cents to 164, presuming the fifths are held<br>consonant at 709 cents. I suppose someone will announce they adore music<br>without any consonant fifths, and if possible, without any other<br>consonances either, but no matter. It would be hard to find a more<br>grotesque temperament for any purpose of melody, whether diatonic,<br>chromatic or enharmonic.<br><br>On the other hand... this system is _so_ outrageous that perhaps one<br>should give it the benefit of the doubt! Perhaps it will find wide use<br>as an example of what exquisitely mistuned intervals sound like.<br><br>All harmonically usable temperaments: 12- 19- 31- 43- 50- 55-tone equal,<br>etc merge the two species of tone at a value intermediate between 10:9 &<br>9:8. This permits the cycles of the fifth, major third and minor third<br>to be integrated within a single coherent system. These temperaments<br>divide the tone into 2,3,5,7,8 & 9 equal parts respectively.<br><br>It is interesting that no usable temperament divides the tone into four<br>equal parts. Both 22- and 24-tone equal do so, and both are dogs, though<br>for very different reasons. There is also a gap in the sequence at 6.<br><br>It occurs to me that I might make my points concerning 22-tone equal<br>easier to understand by giving at least the first few fifths of the<br>system. I start on C, purely out of reverence for tradition:<br><br>	etc	F		C		G		D		<br>A		E		B		F#	etc<br>		491		0		709		218		<br>927		427		1145	654<br><br>Note the very narrow diatonic semitone between E & F, and the very wide<br>chromatic semitone between F & F#. It occurs to me that Pythagoreans<br>bored with their chosen system, and who want to _really_ get hold of<br>some mistuned intervals, might love all this.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
