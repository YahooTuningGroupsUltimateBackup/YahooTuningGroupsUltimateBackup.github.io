Szanto suggests. I can*t surf. I never inhaled.<br>And I never heard of the Hindustani Jazz Sextet. (Though I sometimes heard<br>Harihar Rao*s Indian Music program on KPFK).<br><br>I do know Emil Richards* book,  however. _Emil Richards* World of<br>Percussion** is interesting for a couple of Erv Wilson instruments, and<br>Richards had Harry Partch tune up a few of the instruments in his<br>collection. Perhaps a good Partch scholar should add these to the list.<br>(Along these lines, Mills College also has a Partch instrument, the _double<br>canon_, or prototype of the Surrogate Kithara, whose picture is found in<br>the first edition of _Genesis of a Music_. The dance music that this was<br>used for at Mills should also be added to the Partch works list. Perhaps,<br>there should be a prize created for anyone ever finding either (a) the<br>abandoned Guitar I or (b) one of the abandoned reed organs or (c) one of<br>the fugues Partch composed while in Hawaii.)   <br><br>Daniel Wolf<br>Frankfurt<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 7 Nov 1996 16:03 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06895; Thu, 7 Nov 1996 16:04:42 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06887<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id HAA24052; Thu, 7 Nov 1996 07:04:40 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 7 Nov 1996 07:04:40 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961107150049_71670.2576_HHB68-9@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3993 href="#3993">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/12/1996 7:10:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> I THINK I heard on the list a few weeks ago that the Kurzweil 2500<br>> couldn't be programmed into 19 TET unless each key was setup to playback a<br>> tuned sample.  <br><br>   I'm the one who posted that conclusion by my K2500-owner friend.  That<br>conclusion has the potential to be true provided that you're trying to map<br>linearly across the keyboard, mismatching octave boundaries in the tuning with<br>octave boundaries in the white/black structure of the keyboard).  <br><br>   (An aside:  Speaking for myself, I'm very impressed by people who are capable<br>of ignoring the 7+5 white/black structure of the traditional keyboard.  Although<br>I have always found it very difficult to ignore, there can be no doubt that the<br>majority of people exploring 19 and many other microtonal ETs on keyboard map it<br>that way, and see nothing particularly problematic about it.)<br><br>   I say "has the potential to be true" because somebody down in the bowels of<br>Kurzweil responded saying that that's not true.  The K2x00 apparently has four<br>basic capabilities useful for unusual tunings, as I understand it anyway:<br>1.  You can tune all C-C octaves identically to just about any conceivable <br>    pitch.  The limitation is that it must be on C-C (or A-A or whatever) <br>    boundaries, and the pattern must repeat in octaves.  Apparently you can <br>    have quite a few of this sort of table loaded and can switch off between<br>    them with a SysEx message.  So you can certainly map 19 into two, three,<br>    or more 12-toned subsets.  One way that strikes me as reasonable for doing<br>    this is a tuning table with naturals and sharps, one with naturals and <br>    flats, and another with the more common nonnaturals (e.g., F# instead of<br>    Gb, and Bb instead of A#) and also containing B#/Cb and E#/Fb notes.  You<br>    can also create 19 tables for each of the 19 possible key signatures.  <br>2.  You can tune the interval between adjacent keys to a consistent cent <br>    distance identical between all adjacent key pairs.  The limitation is that<br>    you have only 2-cent resolution.  So using this mechanism alone, 19 mapped<br>    linearly across the keyboard (instead of in 12-toned subsets) turns out <br>    way off by the time you reach the 19th key in the sequence.  <br>3.  The fellow at Kurzweil, who apparently prefers the 12-tone subset approach<br>    or perhaps doesn't do much with microtonal ETs, says that you can refine <br>    this 2-cent resolution using something I think he called a "function".  I <br>    don't know the details, nor do I personally know anybody who's <br>    successfully implemented this suggestion (not to suggest for a moment that<br>    I have any reason to think that this Kurzweil fellow is misleading us, of <br>    course).<br>4.  James McCartney, whose address I don't recall, uses a K2000 microtonally<br>    by using what I suppose might be called a "memorizing controller".  Ap-<br>    parently the K2x00 has at least one controller which, when you set it to<br>    some value, it remembers that value.  You can then use it kind of like a <br>    pitch-bend by applying it to pitch calculations, and it does NOT affect <br>    notes currently playing.  <br><br>   Without a doubt, in my mind and many others', Ensoniq's pitch-table approach<br>is FAR more intuitive and easier to work with.  But certainly in many ways the<br>K2x00 instruments are more powerful at a purely synthesizer-capability level<br>than the ASR.  Apparently their effects processor isn't as capable as the ASR's<br>though.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 13 Nov 1996 05:12 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02384; Wed, 13 Nov 1996 05:13:48 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02390<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id UAA13865; Tue, 12 Nov 1996 20:13:45 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 12 Nov 1996 20:13:45 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.961112210813.35472A-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
