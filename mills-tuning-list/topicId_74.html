The only way to<br>> actually *determine* what you're<br>> hearing (rather than what you *think*<br>> you're hearing) is to use double-blind<br>> psychoacoustic tests.<br><br>Well, none of the music that I'm familiar with is listened to with<br>double-blind tests. We all hear just what we believe we hear. (How is<br>hearing otherwise possible?) I agree that culture, learning, and a whole<br>range of acoustical factors determine how we hear intervals (or virtually<br>anything!), and, whether we as composers choose to embrace those factors or<br>work against them, they are the foundation for musical listening.<br><br>To say that listeners "prefer" a certain interval or that they find it more<br>"consonant" in a psychoacoustical test is useless without a musical<br>context. Brian in an earlier post seemed to support a subjective definition<br>of consonance and dissonance, but this seems to be contradicted by the<br>many sources he quotes to try to disprove the theory that consonance is<br>determined by the relative smallness of numbers in a ratio.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, though. I think that psychoacoustical research is very<br>valuable for composers. The impressionist painters were able to exploit<br>discoveries in the science of vision to invent new and artistically<br>effective techniques. But does their use of science make the art better? Can<br>we say that science therefore "supports" the impressionist techniques over<br>those of, say, the cubists? Of course not.<br><br>It is meaningless to say that discoveries in science "support" any aesthetic<br>position, and the choice of a tuning system is an artistic one, just as is<br>the rhythm, the melody, the harmony (if, indeed, such elements exist at<br>all).<br><br>When I write a piece, I don't see any choice but to write it the way I want<br>to hear it. Maybe my ears are "fooling" me, but I would rather trust them<br>than numbers in a prestigious scientific journal. My ultimate aim is for<br>listeners to share enough of my cultural background, learning, and<br>physiology for my composition to effectively communicate a rewarding musical<br>experience.<br><br>Bill Alves<br>alves@hmc.edu<br>http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 9 Oct 1995 16:53 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA08810; Mon, 9 Oct 1995 07:52:48 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 9 Oct 1995 07:52:48 -0700<br>Message-Id:  <9510090747.aa29053@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
