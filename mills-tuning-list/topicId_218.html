She<br>found it difficult to think of the great composers composing music by rules and<br>formulas.  <br><br>   I responded pointing out that there's a very important difference between<br>composing by rules and formulas and composing by cleverness and intellect.<br>Rules and formulas are unemotional of course, but they're also unintellectual.<br>They're just statements of reality.  For something to be intellectual, it must<br>be open to interpretation.  If it were not, then there would be no clever or<br>uninspired usage of it, because there would be only one possible way to use it!<br><br><br>   Truly great music carries both emotional poignancy and intellectual intrigue.<br>Music that goes only by the rules is boring, because it has no source of<br>inspiration.  Music that carries only emotionalism is unintelligible.  Music<br>that carries only intellectual intrigue has great meaningfulness but quickly<br>loses it over time, because it never finds a home in your heart.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 8 Dec 1995 04:33 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id TAA27985; Thu, 7 Dec 1995 19:33:36 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 7 Dec 1995 19:33:36 -0800<br>Message-Id: <951208032815_71670.2576_HHB62-10@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
