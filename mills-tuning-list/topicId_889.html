You can meet me in<br>the big tent at 2PM. The adress is 96, fifth avenue. I will arrive with<br>the parade, and will wear white socks, black shorts, white shirt. I will<br>be playing trumpet, some of you probably knew that already. You are all<br>invited to follow the band, bring your instrument if you think you can<br>fit in the group. The evening will be in a hotel, so you dont have to<br>worry about where you will sleep. I think it costs 5$ to get in the<br>tent, and if you want a hotel room, you will have to pay a part of the<br>price. This is our chance to meet other xenharmonists.<br><br>Talk to you soon, <br>-Kami<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 18 Sep 1996 02:27 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08271; Wed, 18 Sep 1996 02:29:46 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08565<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id RAA16036; Tue, 17 Sep 1996 17:29:44 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 17 Sep 1996 17:29:44 -0700<br>Message-Id: <44960917230044/0005695065PK1EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3623 href="#3623">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/1996 7:50:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Thanks for your comments, Paul (E).

So level 2 <br>> consistency seems like an arbitrary requirement, as level 2.1 consistency <br>> and level 1.9 consistency would lead to results which are slightly different <br>> but just as meaningful musically.<br><br>This is a good question, and I'm not sure if I have a good answer for<br>it.  Probably the best answer I can give is this: the main thrust of my<br>theoretical wanderings in xenharmony is to discover tunings that are<br>analogous to common practice harmony, in the sense that they have<br>similar structures according to various hypothesized perceptual models.<br>Common practice 5-limit harmony did not find 5TET or 7TET sufficient for<br>its purposes, despite the fact that they are level 1 consistent at the<br>5-limit; it settled on 12TET, which is level 3 consistent.  Therefore, I<br>tentatively conclude that there is some kind of advantage to higher<br>levels of consistency.<br><br>A possible explanation is this: an ET which is level 1 consistent at a<br>given limit may err from a just interval within that limit by up to<br>half a step.  It seems to me that my ear, at least, would not readily<br>accept such an ET as an approximation to that interval when almost any<br>interval randomly chosen from the continuous gamut would be more closely<br>approximated by that ET.  Since the average error of random intervals is<br>1/4 step, level 2 consistency at the N-limit ensures that N-limit<br>intervals will be better approximated than the average randomly chosen<br>interval.  Thought of in this way, one can justify choosing level 2 as a<br>lower limit on consistency.<br><br>Does that make any sense?<br><br>--pH (manynote@library.wustl.edu or http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote)<br>       O<br>      /\             "Foul?

For 1<N<1.5, there is no guarantee that the approximating intervals <br>will be consistent with one another.<br><br>	    I don't think the concept of consistency has much to do with whether a <br>particular JI interval is approximated well enough to be used as a harmonic <br>consonance. The absolute accuracy of the approximation is the determining <br>factor, not the accuracy relative to the size of the smallest steps in the <br>tuning. For example, the 12-tET major third sounds like a 5/4 even if 12-tET <br>is considered a subset of 72-tET, where the interval is off by an entire <br>step. I have derived an algorithm for determining the certainty with which <br>an arbitrary interval is perceived as one or another JI intervals, based on <br>J. L. Goldstein's 1973 paper, "An optimum processor theory for the central <br>formation of the pitch of complex tones." Manual Op de Coul has ingeniously <br>integrated this algorithm into Scala, under the Farey command. I leave it to <br>him to provide instructions. Using this algorithm, we find that for any <br>listener across the entire gamut of frequency resolution the most prominent <br>interpretation of the a 7-tET "third" will be 11/9, and the most prominent <br>interpretation 7-tET "tenth" will be as 17/7. Listeners at one extreme of <br>the gamut will perceive the 7-tET "sixth" as 5/3, but those at the other <br>extreme will hear it as 18/11. Thus the typically considered "imperfect <br>consonances" in triadic harmony are not well represented in 7-tET.<br><br>	    What consistency offers is a supplement to considerations of how good <br>the approximations to JI are. Essentially, composing with a consistent <br>tuning will be no more difficult than composing in JI, while in inconsistent <br>tunings, complications may arise if one attempts to always use the best <br>approximations to JI intervals.<br><br> - Paul E.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 19 Sep 1996 21:15 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA09749; Thu, 19 Sep 1996 21:16:57 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA30269<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA07606; Thu, 19 Sep 1996 12:16:50 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 19 Sep 1996 12:16:50 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01510105ae674b5036b2@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3637 href="#3637">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/1996 12:55:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Thu, 19 Sep 1996, PAULE wrote:<br>> Paul H.,<br>> <br>> 	    I believe your original definition leads to consistency for level <br>> N>1.5.

I find level 1 consistency to<br>be far too low a standard.  Very weird things can happen in level 1<br>consistent tunings.  A simple example: 5TET is consistent at the<br>5-limit.  A 16/15, represented as a 4/3 less a 5/4, becomes 2-2=0 steps,<br>or a unison.  However, a 25/24, represented as a 5/4 less a 6/5, becomes<br>2-1=1 step.  In other words, a larger interval becomes a unison while a<br>smaller interval does not.  Maybe this doesn't bother you, but for me it<br>causes cognitive dissonance.<br><br>--pH (manynote@library.wustl.edu or http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote)<br>       O<br>      /\             "Foul?
