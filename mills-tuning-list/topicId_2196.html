E.g., given two waves, one of which has a frequency at a<br>>  power-of-two of the other, the lower one will cross the zero point<br>(volage-<br>>  or SPL-wise) only at points at which the higher one is crossing as well.<br>>   This is a unique property of frequencies related by powers-of-two; they<br>>  have, then a special relationship of some kind, no?  The higher one is<br>>  repeating at the same frequency as the lower one, as well as at its own<br>>  nominal frequency.  They can, then, in a very real and physical sense, be<br>>  considered to be the same note; i.e., the same "pitch" but in different<br>>  registers.<br><br>I was wrong.  8-)>  Graham Breed was gracious enough to point out my error to<br>me off-list.  The above definition would apply to any whole-number multiple<br>of the lower frequency, not just powers of two.  However, there is still a<br>unique relationship if you consider that the lower one will cross the zero<br>point only at points at which the higher one is also crossing _and completing<br>an even number of cycles_.  It turns out that odd-number multiples cross in<br>mid-cycle where the lower one crosses, and even ones cross at completed<br>cycles.  I acknowlege that this weakens my argument considerably.<br><br>Much more interesting was Marion's observation:<br><br>>On octave invariance, it has just occurred to me that, in LCM<br>>terms, the octave has a property that no other ratio shares. <br>>That is two notes that differ only by octaves can be mixed<br>>without making the length of the resulting "interference" pattern<br>>longer than the waveform of the lowest note.<br><br>That's what I was picturing in my mind but stated rather poorly, using the<br>wrong point of reference.  Thanks, Marion.  So for now I still maintain my<br>conclusion that two pitches separated by the interval 2:1 are the same note<br>in different registers.  That triad inversions sound different is the result<br>of a different set of intervals within each inversion of the chord, and so<br>does not seem to require throwing out the idea of octave equivalence.<br><br>As to Gary M.'s comment that this argument would be distroyed by simply<br>mistuning the octaves slightly, I think that since its proximity to 2:1<br>causes the ear to treat it (musically) as if it were exactly 2:1, the theory<br>is still valid.<br><br>David<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 4 Jul 1997 22:36 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA23054; Fri, 4 Jul 1997 22:36:44 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 4 Jul 1997 22:36:44 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05115<br>Received: (qmail 11467 invoked from network); 4 Jul 1997 20:36:38 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 4 Jul 1997 20:36:38 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199707042031.PAA29119@kimserv><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5756 href="#5756">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>7/5/1997 12:20:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>To check against paper, using the ratio for the 5th or 3/2, or 1.5,<br>>and using A220, (a)  for conveince, four fifths gives a frequency of<br>>220*1.5^4 (as entered on the W95 calculator, OK so ^ is the x^y key)<br>>or  1113.75.
