There are ratio<br>>analyses of ICM which give prime limits up to 31 and if anyone's<br>>interested I'll be happy to dig out the references.<br><br>I'm extremely interested -- please, dig.<br><br>I should perhaps state that it is my belief (as expounded in my book)<br>that the original Indian tuning was a string of 22 4/3s and 3/2s, and<br>that because some of the resulting intervals were only a schisma<br>(roughly 2 cents) away from some 5-limit intervals which could be<br>inferred, the result in practice was damn close to a 5-limit system.<br><br>(Although I haven't done a serious study of Indian music, this<br>tuning does agree with the oldest Indian theoretical writings<br>I've read.)<br><br>>Secondly, I have no argument with the idea of the quality of prime <br>>numbers. Danielou's writing was the thing that got me into thinking<br>>in those terms.<br><br>I'm sorry if my posting made it sound like that was your position --<br>and glad to know that you agree with the idea of prime qualities.<br>I mentioned your name only because of what you reported about<br>the relevance of Danielou's work to actual Indian practice.  Scott<br>Makeig's reference to Danielou was what got *me* into thinking<br>in terms of prime qualities.<br><br>My whole interest in just-intonation theory started because I<br>wanted to find a better way to notate the ratios.  16 years later,<br>it has evolved into something far deeper and broader than<br>that -- to the point where I feel that prime qualities, whether<br>actually present or merely implied by the tuning, are the<br>basic cognitive archtype behind the harmonic and melodic<br>aspects of music-making, whatever the actual tuning used<br>(be it just, 12- or other- equal, well-tempered, meantone,<br>non-octave, roots of pi, or other more exotic number-play).<br><br>This is not meant to be a dogmatic assertion that primes are<br>the only justifiable tuning system or analytical methodology,<br>but merely a statement that the feelings and sounds evoked<br>by the bewildering variety of intervals actually heard in music<br>are most *simply* analyzed by studying the prime qualities<br>present in or implied by those intervals, by reduction of the<br>frequency-ratios to prime factors and their exponents.<br><br>(Thanks to Paul Erlich's endless debates with me in his<br>pursuit of precision, that's the clearest statement of my<br>position I've ever come up with.)<br><br>>What I cannot go along with however in Danielou's work is that <br>>anything over prime 5 takes you into potentially dangerous areas <br>>metaphysically. There are many musical cultures which tune to<br>>higher prime limits than five. <br>><br>>I hope this makes my position clearer.<br><br>My microtonal analysis of a Robert Johnson blues song (see my<br>website) was done by ear, and although I believe that I came as<br>close as I could in my MIDI sequence to what he actually sings<br>on the CD, I will admit that that some of the ratios in the vocals<br>may indeed be quite different from the ones I chose.<br><br>However, it is indisputable to me that Delta Blues guitar parts<br>implied 7, and vocal parts used 7, all over the place, and that the<br>vocals used primes far higher than that.<br><br>I wouldn't be so fast to discredit the idea that "anything over<br>prime 5 takes you into potentially dangerous areas metaphysically" <br>though -- perhaps that's exactly what makes the blues "the<br>Devil's music"!  Although Danielou didn't accept 7, maybe he<br>was on to something here.<br><br>- Joe Monzo<br>  joe_monzo@hotmail.com<br>  http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html<br><br>___________________________________________________________________<br>You don't need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at http://www.juno.com<br>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</div>
