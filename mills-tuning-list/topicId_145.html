Many of those<br>statements relate to the "taboo", off perfect consonances, like the off octaves,<br>and how important it is to avoid them.  I also briefly aluded to Bill Sethares'<br>work with 88CET using timbres optimized for 88CET.  <br><br>   That's what I'm going to discuss briefly here.  <br><br>   As most tuning-listers are well aware, almost all musical tones consist of<br>composite of frequency components (partials).  Although we often speak in terms<br>of relationships between the fundamental pitches of the notes in a chord, all of<br>the frequency components in all notes within a chord ultimately interact.  The<br>pitches of all of the partials ultimately determine how a chord will sound.  <br>   So my repeated statements then that the "taboo" off perfect consonances sound<br>awful, are all relative to the timbre in which you play them.  If the partials<br>are essentially harmonic, then those "taboo" intervals are realistically<br>unusable.  <br><br>   But Sethares took this tuning-timbre relationship in reverse.  Rather than<br>taking the overtone structure for granted, and accepting certain intervals as<br>unfortunate casualties, Sethares instead took the 14-step stretched octave as a<br>basic building block of his 88CET music, and remapped the partials so that<br>sounds good.  In particular, he came up with a mapping so that the 1232c<br>off-octave creates an identity sensation much like that of an octave for the<br>exact harmonic timbres.  Not surprisingly, Sethares has this process down to a<br>science, or at least to an art, and 88CET is just one of many tunings to which<br>he's applied the technique.  <br><br>   Two general comments are in order.  First, this pseudo-octave aside, this<br>mapping process produces some really fascinating-sounding timbres.  They sound<br>somewhat like hybrid timbres - hybrids of whatever they were before mapping,<br>with a bell-like sound.  The commonly-held belief that only harmonic overtone<br>structures "fuse" to what our ears perceive as single tones, turns out to be<br>mostly myth.  Secondly, it does work;  on their own terms, these timbres really<br>do produce an octave-like identity sensation.  <br><br>   This paper is not the correct forum for explaining the theory behind<br>Sethares' mapping process, but this much is worth telling:  The mapping is built<br>upon empirical curves elating the dissonance of two sinewaves to frequency<br>differences, measured by Plomp and Levelt in 1965.  Their experimental data was<br>based on statistical surveys of many people.  Sethares curve-fitted this<br>experimental data to a mathematical relationship, and derived a procedure for<br>applying the results to all partials of a complex tone, thereby measuring the<br>overall dissonance of an given interval as rendered in a given tonal spectrum.<br>He then turned the process around so that he could derive tonal spectra for<br>minimal dissonance of a given set of intervals.  <br><br>   In the dissonance curve for 88CET, the troughs (local minima) in the curve<br>are places of minimum dissonance, and thus maximal consonance.  The overtone<br>retuning for making 88CET's 1232c off-octave into a pseudo-octave, starting from<br>a hypothetical purely-harmonic tone, uses the following frequency multipliers<br>for the first ten partials:  1, 2.03, 3.06, 3.94, 5.087, 5.92, 6.9, 8.04, 9.36,<br>10.36.<br><br>   Perhaps not surprisingly, this isn't without its trade-offs, both good and<br>bad.  To my ears, these nonharmonic overtone structures make the exact pitch of<br>the notes a little hard to pinpoint.  As such, they somewhat blur 88CET's<br>interval approximations that are nearly just.  The fifth loses some of its<br>steely-cold simplicity, the subminor third and seventh some of their septimal<br>"zap", and the major tenth some of its sweet richness.  But at least one<br>intervals benefits: the 9:7 supramajor third, often cited as harsh, loses some<br>of its edge.  The dissonance curve has a trough on 88CET's 9:7 approximation.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 4 Nov 1995 07:04 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA12354; Fri, 3 Nov 1995 21:04:50 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 3 Nov 1995 21:04:50 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199511040504.AA03370@world.std.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2250 href="#2250">ðŸ”—</a>Johnny Reinhard &#x3C;reinhard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/1995 9:17:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Since the clavichord was introduced, this is no basis for equal <br>temperament.
