As I did<br>saw them, an analogy to why I think there is value in systematizing tuning<br>came to mind.  <br><br>   It may be analogy that some list subscribers can relate to, perhaps<br>others not, since it is an analogy to particle physics.  (And of course,<br>this is just my opinion;  others might disagree entirely.)<br><br>   In one of my favorites from my video library, a particle physicist said<br>the following (this is an approximate quote anyway), "The standard model of<br>the Universe is very powerful.  It explains so much, but it's not complete.<br> It's main flaw is an asthetic flaw:  it's too complicated.  Ever since the<br>ancient Greeks put us on our current line of inquire, we've had this<br>prejudice that there's something simple underlying it all.  Well, six<br>quarks and six leptons, coming in different 'colors', and in their<br>antiparticle forms, is too complicated."  <br><br>   In short, what they're fighting is the sense they have that, if they<br>ever encounter anything they can't explain, they just patch up their theory<br>by contriving a new particle, rather than finding a way that<br>well-understood particles or forces can explain that phenomenon.  (Of<br>course, those particles are not contrived though in the sense that that<br>particle must actually be detected in a particle accelerator before it is<br>accepted to exist.)  <br><br>   In analogy, using a coherent system of pitches rather than just<br>inventing a new pitch whenever you run into a new compositional problem to<br>solve, I believe can lead to more meaningful musical results.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 21 Dec 1996 22:16 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA23211; Sat, 21 Dec 1996 22:18:36 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA23210<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA11556; Sat, 21 Dec 1996 13:18:34 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 21 Dec 1996 13:18:34 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612211616_MC1-DBF-624D@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
