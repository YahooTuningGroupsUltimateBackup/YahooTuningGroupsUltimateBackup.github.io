Scala is<br>written in Ada, which makes the program very easily portable, but sad<br>enough there is no decent Ada compiler for the Macintosh, at least not<br>at the moment. So, the more people tell to Apple to fund and support<br>development of an Ada compiler, like it funded porting of Linux, the<br>better.<br>On the other hand, there is a joint venture currently underway to port<br>the GNAT Ada95 compiler to the Macintosh (running Machten UNIX).<br>Delivery of both 68k and PowerPC versions is expected in the third<br>quarter of 1996. The GNAT compilers are for free. More details via<br>email at: gnat-mac@lists.csn.net . <br>When the compiler is available someone else is welcome to do the port, <br>since I don't own a Mac myself, but I'm willing to support the effort.<br>However I don't know if any MIDI studios use Machten UNIX.<br><br>It's possible to run Scala on a PC, and still use the files on a Mac.<br>The scale files are just ASCII files, and the tuning dumps are<br>standard MIDI files with system exclusive messages. Keyboard mappings<br>(scale degrees to MIDI note numbers) are also ASCII files. <br>JICalc's scale model is less flexible than Scala's but with a text<br>editor or a program it should be possible to change most Scala files<br>with just intonation scales into files readable by JICalc. A difference <br>is that JICalc has the keyboard mapping as a header inside the scale <br>files, and Scala has them as separate files.<br><br>If someone is interested in some of the algorithms in the program,<br>they can contact me for (well readable) source code.<br><br>This is an overview of the help items:<br><br>ADD        APPEND     APPROXIMATE           CALCULATE  CATALOGUE  CD<br>CLEAR      CLOSE      COMPARE    CONVERGENTS           COPY       CPS<br>DELETE     DIFFERENCE DIRECTORY  DIVIDE     DOUBLE     ECHO       EGALIZE<br>EQUALTEMP  EUCLID     EULERFOKKER           EXCHANGE   EXIT       FAREY<br>FILE       FIT        FLIP       HARMONIC   HELP       INPUT      INSERT<br>INTERSECT  INVERT     ITERATE    KEY        LATTICE    LIMIT      LOAD<br>MERGE      MODE       MOS        MOVE       MULTIPLY   PAUSE      PERMUTE<br>PIPEDUM    POLYNOMIAL POP        PRODUCT    PROJECT    PUSH       PYTHAGOREAN<br>QUANTIZE   RATIO      REDUCE     REMOVE     REPLACE    REVERSE    SAMPLE<br>SAVE       SEED       SELECT     SEND       SET        SHOW       SORT<br>SPAWN      SQUARE     STRETCH    SUBTRACT   SWAP       SYMMETRIZE TEMPERAMENT<br>UNIQUE     VARY       @          $          %          !          ?<br>About...
