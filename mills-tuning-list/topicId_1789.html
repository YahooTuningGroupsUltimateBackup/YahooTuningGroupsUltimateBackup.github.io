The Chrysalis, the rotating circular lyre, is a stunning<br>instrument. (Forster is a superb cabinet-maker.) <br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 5 Mar 1997 01:58 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06158; Wed, 5 Mar 1997 01:58:35 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06267<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id QAA05062; Tue, 4 Mar 1997 16:57:00 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 4 Mar 1997 16:57:00 -0800<br>Message-Id: <332eb7c0.371995479@kcbbs.gen.nz><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
