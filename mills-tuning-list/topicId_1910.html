A 12-note <br>Pythagorean tuning will involve odd numbers as high as 177147 (this apperas <br>in the ratio of the wolf), but the music itself may never go past the <br>3-identity, or, especially if schismatic approximations are used, the <br>5-identity (as in the middle and late Medieval periods, respectively).<br><br>By the way, this is not a question of adopting a new term, it is a question <br>of preserving the terminology introduced by Harry Partch in light of <br>separate developments that have stolen the word "limit."<br><br>By the other way, my roommates this summer had studied electronic music at <br>Harvard using Allen Strange's textbook.
