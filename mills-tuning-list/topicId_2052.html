The<br>strength of JI as a system is that the rational relationships between the<br>notes can be expressed in whole numbers whereas ET systems define the notes<br>logarithmically.<br><br>Please bear in mind that not all JI systems are the same. You can construct<br>a JI scale by taking a chunk of the harmonic series (what Partch calls<br>Otonality). You can take a mirror image of the harmonic series (what some<br>would call the undertone series) and an octave chunk of that becomes your<br>scale (Utonality in Partch's nomenclature). You can work in a tetrachordal<br>system or you can as Lou Harrison sometimes does work in free JI where you<br>just intuitively step around using a set of intervals rather than a fixed<br>scale. <br><br>As there are various JI scales, there are various ways of structuring. For<br>example, the higher the prime identity of the note (in relation to another<br>note) the greater the potential dissonance. So by looking at the numbers and<br>how they move you can get an idea of the relative dissonance or consonance<br>of a pattern without mentally calculating the exact interval. Eventually one<br>can develop a right-brained approach to number. <br><br>JI can't however let you play in anything like a key system (except that is<br>for what Ray Tomes calls Dynamic JI where the intervals get automatically<br>recalculated whenever you declare a new tonic). There are JI scales of more<br>than 12 notes to an octave where you can take subsets of notes according<br>their prime identity and these subsets (or spaces) have similar internal<br>structure, so moving from one harmonic space to another can give that gear<br>shift feel of changing key. But unlike ET you're not giving your spaces<br>arbitrary labels from the letters of the alphabet, with JI your space has a<br>numerical identity and that's what you call it. <br><br>Those are the sort of structural concerns that interest me at the moment.<br><br>Brian Lee<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 16 May 1997 03:06 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03386; Fri, 16 May 1997 03:06:16 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 16 May 1997 03:06:16 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03384<br>Received: (qmail 26152 invoked from network); 16 May 1997 01:06:12 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 16 May 1997 01:06:12 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541101afa114c0af4a@[207.207.3.171]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
