In fact,<br>the other musicians we play with are usually intrigued and interested<br>in our instruments, and the "average" fans may be a little confused,<br>but they are usually receptive. We do a real cross section of 19 tone<br>music, including jazz, reggae, blues, and country...as soon as we get<br>a 34 tone repertoire more together, we'll be doing that as well. People<br>all over Denver have heard of what we do, and usually in a positive way.<br>When I first started playing 19 tone 6 years ago, I never would have<br>dreamed that it would be so well accepted...Hstick<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 29 Jun 1996 01:10 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id QAA09028; Fri, 28 Jun 1996 16:10:10 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 28 Jun 1996 16:10:10 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.960628162115.27903B-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
