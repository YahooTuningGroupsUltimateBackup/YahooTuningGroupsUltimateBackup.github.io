Also, thanks to Linus Liu for showing a group of us around<br>>and being so hospitable in Hong Kong!<br><br>I'll second that, and add that (having been present in the flesh for *both* of<br>the tutorials) they were both models of erudition and that particular variety<br>of "the soft answer that turneth away wrath" that pretty much guaranteed a<br>serious hearing. One of the gentlemen in the auditorium seated behind me seems<br>to have found John's presentation of lattices of interest in the sense that<br>he'd<br>probably discovered that some of the things he loves about serial composition<br>and some of his skills as a table traverser might actually map somehow onto this<br>strange and new territory. The results will be quite different, but I'm<br>perfectly<br>happy to watch folks discover *any* path into working in the space.<br><br>I've also gotta say that I heard enough of an excerpt of Kraig Grady's<br>recent disc<br>of Anaphorian music [where they reduplicate for stress?] to be *very* impressed.<br>Our own Eric Lyon's electroacoustic decentrefest "Red Velvet" was a major<br>shredding<br>experience. Let's see - I also discovered that ffitch and myself probably<br>attended the<br>very same screenings of Rocky Horror in Salt Lake City in the 70s [tiny<br>world], and<br>Larry Polansky was his usual beatific and sane presence. My only regret is<br>that I<br>wound up at the Teaware Museum instead of finding out about the Linus Liu<br>goodwill<br>tour of instrument shops. Bill Sethares' bitchin' green erhu case is (as<br>the kids say)<br>*da bomb.*<br><br>And one other thing - can you *believe* this? There were actually pieces<br>played in<br>the *concerts* in non12TET. The composers weren't clubbed to death by those<br>representatives of Yurrupean High Modernism in attendance, either. There was<br>certainly a number of "usual suspects" pieces as well - don't get me wrong.<br>But it<br>*is* changing, so I believe that things are looking up for a non12TET stealth<br>recruitment program. This is particularly auspicious owing to the fact that the<br>next ICMC is in Thessaloniki, in the bosom of those tetrachordal folks. I'm<br>sorely<br>tempted to turn away from my Indonesianisms and to take a run at channelling a<br>hiphop-flavored Archytus zoned for Light Industrial myself.<br><br>And Bill Sethares? In terms of papers, he's one of the *major* meme generators.<br>I kept hearing about the tutorial from other folks who wanted to know if<br>I'd gone.<br>Definitely executive timbre.<br><br>With regards,<br>Gregory<br><br>_<br>I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,<br>paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only<br>maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it.
