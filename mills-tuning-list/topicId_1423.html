It seems like a product<br>that would have a great domestic demand as well as a potential for<br>profitable export to niche markets abroad (like American microtonalists!).<br>Maybe some list members have concrete ideas. Perhaps a 12 (Pyth)+10 (comma<br>varied) keyboard with a variable fundamental frequency would be sufficient.<br> <br>I think I remember seeing an electronic microtonal keyboard used in<br>Middle Eastern music as far back as the 70's, but I don't remember<br>any details about it.  I never checked on what kind it was or where<br>it was made, but it saw it in performances in Los Angeles.<br><br>In reply to Neil's reply to Kami:<br><br>>Haverstick here...Kami's post on Indian systems fits exactly with a<br>book I've been reading by Alain Danielou, "Music and the Power of<br>Sound"...<br><br>I haven't had a chance to look at this book, but I have seen one of<br>Danielou's previous books, "Northern Indian Music."  This has a<br>number of ragas in it, and Danielou's notation system for their<br>tuning as he believes ithem to be.  (It's controversial and I've<br>had serious discussions with ethnomusicalologists about it, as many<br>follow Jharaizbhoy's claim that real musicians don't play in<br>just nintonation or Pythagoriean tuning, as Danielou claims.)  Anyway,<br>you can figure out the ragioshhtios for the ragas by matching a key at<br>the beginning of the book with Danielou's notation for teh tuhe tunings.<br>I prepared some charts about that and included them in my <br>dissertation, which is supposedly available from University <br>Microfilms, though I never received the copies that I ordered from<br>them.  ("Exploring Microtonal Tuinnings:  A Kaleidoscope of Extended<br>Just Tuinnings and Their Compositional Applications.)")<br><br>Anyway, whether or not Danielou (who isn't Indian) "gfoot it right" or<br>not, his tunings are very gbbeautiful and they sound reasonably "Indian"<br>to me.  Real artists don't just play tunings, though, they add a <br>lot of "gamakas" which are different kind s of ornaments, with<br>sliding around a pitch.  I would doubt that many singers are as<br>accurate as computers., but teh Che CD I just listened to by Lakshmi<br>is pretty awesome.
