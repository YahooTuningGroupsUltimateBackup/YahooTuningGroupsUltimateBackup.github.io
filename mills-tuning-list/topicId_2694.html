I wanted to report on a couple of microtonal presentations<br>I saw last week at the Percussive Arts Society Intenational Convention in<br>Anaheim, California (hell, at the *Disneyland* Hotel and Convention Center,<br>no less...). These took place on the first day, which is designated "New<br>Music and Research Day".<br><br>The first presenter was George Zelenz, who was to introduce "Intonation and<br>Instrument Design: A Practical Approach to an Evolving Relationship".<br>Unfortunately, the seminar/concert bore little resemblence to the announced<br>title. Mr. Zelenz proceeded to give an introductory lecture/demonstration<br>of just intonation, utilizing overhead diagrams and a large tubalong<br>instrument definately built on Erv Wilson's principles. The information<br>wasn't organized too well, and my notes can't tell me if the instrument was<br>22TET or 11-limit JI; it was another aluminum-tube-with-no-resonators type<br>of thing, so nothing special there.<br><br>This was the kind of seminar that falls in my "missed opportunity"<br>category; though the audience wasn't gigantic, it was the kind of people<br>that would be open to new ideas and musics. Instead, we were treated to the<br>typical "tyranny of equal temperment", scattered bits of numerical data and<br>noodling on the instrument. I really had Neil H. in mind, as he probably<br>would have stormed the stage and *demanded* that the guy go home and get<br>his chops together. The only hope was a tape he played at the end, which<br>was Mr. Zelenz on drums, unknown fretless bass player and sequenced<br>just-tuned synth -- a fairly funky piece. If he continues in this direction<br>maybe someone will be swayed, but this afternoon was a lost cause.<br><br>On a brighter note was the following hour, with Kraig Grady presenting some<br>of his instruments from the island of Anaphoria :) Mr. Grady is an<br>unassuming fellow who has also learned from Erv Wilson. Unlike some others,<br>he has developed quite a few good sounding (and looking!) instruments of<br>various designs -- metallophones, marimbas, hammered string and reed<br>organs. During this session, Mr. Grady played a short piece on an 11-limit<br>just metallophone and demonstrated a bass metallophone, and discussed<br>developing instruments for the ensemble. Logistics precluded my attendance<br>at a concert later that evening, but Kraig has a second CD out and has the<br>beginning of a web site.<br><br>Kraig Grady has taken an interesting tack, building the imaginary folklore<br>and music of Anaphoria as a path to just intonation explorations. Combined<br>with an appealing visual approach to instrument building, the net effect<br>supercedes the sometimes wandering quality of the<br>compositions/improvisations. It would be a lovely evening to see one of his<br>frequent collaborations: music for shadow plays. If people are interested<br>in the CD's and such I'll try to dig up more info.<br><br>I continue to search for the people who hear a music in their head, and<br>develop an intonational pallette to realize it! I've grown very tired of<br>folks who find all these cool scales, only to wonder just what the hell<br>they're going to do now that they found them...<br><br>~~~~~~~<br><br>By the way, now that everyone is straight on Jim French and the<br>"Frenchophones", one other item bears mentioning: I knew Jim when he used<br>to live down here in San Diego, and if it's of use to anyone he is a true<br>authority on the many varieties of bamboo, having grown and studied them<br>quite a bit. Amazing improvisor, too.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br><br><br>*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*<br> Jonathan M.
