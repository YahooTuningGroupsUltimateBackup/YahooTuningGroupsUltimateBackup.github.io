This is John Harrison's pi tuning, -- mclaren<br>and Paul added<br>"Erh?  I thought in pi tuning the octave was to the major third as pi is<br>to one.  The two are not equivalent, at least according to my<br>calculations." -- Paul Hahn<br>Paul is correct so far as he goes.  I had in mind (and should<br>have mentioned that I had in mind) Charles Lucy's modification <br>of Harrison's pi tuning.  <br>In Lucy's  more general modification, the ratio and<br>difference of two intervals (a large interval and a small<br>interval) are used, with octave corrections, to obtain<br>an unlimited number of subsequent pitches.<br>Paul, however was incorrect when he posted<br><br>"And how is this scale self-similar?  The Golden Tuning is because<br>successive trips around the spiral of fifths keep subdividing intervals<br>by Golden Sections, but pi tuning does no such thing." -- Paul Hahn<br><br>[pi/2]^N and [4/pi]^N with N running from one to infinity produces<br>a set of self-similar intervals insofar as the ratio of one interval<br>to the subsequent or previous one is always pi/2  or 4/pi, depending<br>on whether you go up by pi/2 or down by pi/2.<br><br>> Or one could choose to define a tuning in which the<br>> interval of 2 octaves + 7/6 is to the 1/1 as<br>> 4.6692106 (Feigenbaum's constant).<br>> Or one could choose to define a tuning in which the<br>> octave + 11/8 is to the 1/1 as 2.718281828:1<br>> And so on. -- mclaren<br><br>Paul Hahn goes on to say:<br>"It's these kind of proposals of Brian's that baffle me sometimes.  I<br>cannot imagine any fashion in which Feigenbaum's or Euler's constants<br>could possibly be aurally significant in any way." -- Paul Hahn<br><br>The inability to imagine X is generally not a valid criticism of<br>X.  Rather it is an implied critique of the person making<br>the comment.<br>Arthur C. Clarke's famous bon mot ought to be modified as follows:<br>"Whenever a respected music theorist says that something is<br>aesthetically possible, he is quite probably right.  But whenever a<br>respected music theorist says that something is aesthetically<br>impossible, he is almost certainly wrong."<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>( One might also recall Clarke's words to the effect that any<br>sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.<br>I might suggest that "Any sufficiently advanced music is <br>indistinguishable <br>from noise."
