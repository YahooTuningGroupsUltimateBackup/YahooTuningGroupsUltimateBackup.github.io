But<br>trying to tune them with an electronic tuner isn't that obvious. So I<br>wanted to calculate how to calibrate the tuner to give me a just third at<br>440Hz. What I calculated was around 443.6 so I guess 444 will do fine but<br>I'd be glad to hear some advice from you.<br>BTW, what do you think of available automatic tuning software such as<br>Frequency Meter, Oscilloscope 2.0 and the "Perfect Pitch" products?<br>Obviously, a software JI tuner could be a very practical tool for some of<br>us. I wonder why it should be *that* complicated to do.<br>Apart from that, I'm currently playing with a Malian musician who tunes<br>the six-strings of his instrument (a harp-lute similar to the kora) in<br>something similar to the second mode of a major pentatonic scale but I<br>haven't been able to precisely check his tuning. Apart from checking each<br>string with an electronic tuner (which seems somewhat unscientific), what<br>method would you recommend?<br>Anyway, TIA for any help.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G.
