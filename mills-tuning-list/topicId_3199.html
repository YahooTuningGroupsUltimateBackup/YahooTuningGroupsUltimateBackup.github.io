The musical instruments of Harry Partch<br>are being expelled from their current location.  Full details of the<br>problem, crisis indeed, is to be had at:<br><br>http://www.corporeal.com/nb_dilem.html<br><br>It is important that such an event NOT occur or that alternative<br>arrangements be found for housing these national treasures.<br><br>As a supporter of music of the new and little known I hope that others will<br>share my concern.  Should he not be widely respected and performed?<br><br>Please check out the site and send a letter to the 'powers that be' to<br>encourage them to alter their decision.<br><br>The Internet is not merely a forum for opinion, it is also a tool for<br>action.  Please do not be offended by this message and please do join in<br>preventing a major error of judgment.<br><br>All best wishes,<br><br>Gordon Rumson<br><br><br>Canadian Pianist and Composer<br><br>Founder and Proprietor of Sikesdi Press<br>Music Publishers of the "New and Little Known"<br>Music by Sorabji, Johansen, Mellers, Flynn, ApIvor and others.<br>Please visit our Web Page at:<br>http://www.cadvision.com/Home_Pages/accounts/liszt/SikesdiPressWebpage.html</div>
