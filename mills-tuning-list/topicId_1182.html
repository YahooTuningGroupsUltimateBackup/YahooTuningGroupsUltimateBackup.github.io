Just tuning of course<br>>would require vastly more keys, assuming it could be considered a<br>>satisfactory tuning (which I don't happen to believe).<br><br>14 notated pitches per octave in 1850? Split keys were certainly used in<br>the 17th and 18th centuries, but 12 keys per octave was still the norm. 1/4<br>comma meantone with 12 keys per octave is still quite usable on the vast<br>majority of music written in the 18th century, and well temperaments<br>rendered 12 even more useful. I can see how mass production necessitated<br>standardization of the construction of keyboards, but I remain unconvinced<br>that 12TET is the only possible (or even most likely) result of such<br>standardization.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
