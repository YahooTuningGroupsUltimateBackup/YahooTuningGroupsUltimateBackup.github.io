I think that was ... oh ... probably something like<br>       about a half hour into the movie, as a guess.<br>2001:  The vocal (choral) music associated with the black monolith.  Probably<br>       something on the order of 15 minutes into the movie, again as a guess.<br>I haven't checked into either of those suggestions.  I don't recall either<br>being particularly microtonal, but I don't have any reason to doubt what<br>they're saying.<br><br>   Some other comments in this thread bring to mind a personal opinion<br>about microtonality in general:  There's a big difference between music<br>being microtonal, and having notes detuned here and there.  I personally<br>believe that a truly microtonal composition should be tuned, preferably<br>systematically, unlike 12TET throughout the entire composition.</div>
