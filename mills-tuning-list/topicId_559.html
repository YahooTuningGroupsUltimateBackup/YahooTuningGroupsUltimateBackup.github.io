On my first trip <br>to The Netherlands Mr. Badings invited me to his home in the Dutch <br>"countryside" so that he could hear me play a 31-tone ET scale throughout <br>the range of the bassoon.  <br><br>He was so happy with the experience that he agreed to compose a new <br>quartet for the AFMM - flute, bassoon, cello, and guitar.  A mistake in <br>the granting process (outlander rather than inlander) put off the writing <br>a full year.  Mr. Badings explained what had happened and that he would <br>rectify the situation in the next year - however, he had passed away.<br><br>I had been warned about Henk Badings regarding his taking over the <br>Conservatory leadership after its previous Jewish director was sacked by <br>Nazi order.  As a Jew this is clearly of import.  Badings was guilty of <br>moral cowardice in the service of ambition.  He was not, however, a Nazi.<br><br>Badings does not have a record that continues in this vein.  He worked <br>hard at his craft with often beautiful results.  Unlike Waldheim, Badings <br>was quite visible and held accountable by his countrymen.  <br><br>My experience was 100% with him <br>and I am very happy that I had the opportunity to meet him and his lovely <br>wife.  His music is well recorded on LP.  Especially wonderful are his <br>many Duos for the Lemkes Violin Duo in 31-ET.  Sadly, Mr. Lemkes lost the <br>use of his Bow arm in a traffic accident, silencing Mr. Bading's <br>strongest musical voice.  His music is published by Donemus in Amsterdam.<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@styx.ios.com<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 9 Jul 1996 08:14 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id XAA07806; Mon, 8 Jul 1996 23:14:24 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 8 Jul 1996 23:14:24 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199607090613.AAA07466@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
