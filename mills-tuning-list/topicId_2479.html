To<br>that end I wrote a paper titled _Phenomenology and Its Application to<br>Microtonality_ while a graduate student in ethnomusicolgoy.<br><br>The results of 3 years working phenomenologically, in a Husserlian model,<br>was that when aproaching the sound continuum intersylistically, no single<br>cultural model is to be considered any more "natural" than another.  (This<br>includes 12ET.)<br><br>Phenomenology as a methodology distinguishes between essences and<br>accidents.  Just Intonation, as well as equal divisions of the octave, and<br>cyclings of particlur intervals are all "essential" microtonal<br>relationships.<br><br>Meanings of words evolve.  The word "enharmonic" for example has evolved<br>from 1. an ancient Greek genus that utilized a tetrachord made up of a 5/4<br>just major third and 2 "quartertones" (which themselves were unequal to<br>each other in size).  2. in the baroque era an enharmonic interval was<br>produced between the meantone F# and Gb, a syntonic comma.  3. Enharmonic<br>is now an identity as it appears on the standard bearer piano (F# is Gb).<br><br>"Microtone" by itself may not have any utility.  It is vague and signifies<br>insignificance by itself.  IMHO.<br><br>A discipline of Microtonality, which I adhere to, would include the<br>commonality of all musics from the perspecitive of pitch and their<br>intervallic relationships.  It is to this end that Alexander J. Ellis<br>invented "cents" which divides the octave logarithmically into 1200<br>cents.  This is the "yardstick" to measure all music microtonally.<br>1200 is a convenient number at the very threshold of pitch<br>differentiation.<br><br>When the Harvard Dictionary of Music pulished its early 20th century<br>definition of a _microtone_ as "smaller" than a quartertone, it was<br>also describing _just intonation_ as mere theory with no evidence of<br>historical useage and as virtually impossible to negotiate in practice.<br>Both definitions needed to be updated.  If Egyptian music is considered<br>microtonal (which it has), and there is no interval smaller than a<br>semitone in the Maqam system, what does that say about the word microtone?<br><br>By Mr. Wolf's definition, and that of the early 20th Century Harvard<br>Dictionary of Music, Egyptian music is not microtonal. And the flute is a<br>woodwind made exclusively with metal.<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@idt.net<br>http://www.echonyc.com/~jhhl/AFMM<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "kris peck" <kpeck@wavetech.net><br>Subject:  how about 22et vs 19et ?<br>PostedDate:  07-10-97 05:01:09<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  07-10-97 05:00:41-07-10-97 05:00:42,07-10-97 03:59:16-07-10-97 03:59:16<br>DeliveredDate:  07-10-97 03:59:16<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256529.001087D3; Tue, 7 Oct 1997 05:00:33 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA09549; Tue, 7 Oct 1997 05:01:09 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 7 Oct 1997 05:01:09 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09537<br>Received: (qmail 16437 invoked from network); 6 Oct 1997 20:01:04 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 6 Oct 1997 20:01:04 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199710070249.VAA14236@riptide.wavetech.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
