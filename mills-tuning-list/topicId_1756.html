The problem with which you are dealing,<br>that of working out the exact correct frequency of every note in any<br>composition, is the same one that I address in my AJI pages at<br>http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/aji-main.htm<br><br>Robert, congratulations on a nice clear presentation.<br><br>In your pages you say:<br>>Another point to note is that most pieces of traditional tonal music, <br>>even short and seemingly simple pieces by Mozart and Haydn, cannot be <br>>translated without modification from traditional notation into integer <br>>ratios. Chromatic passages are especially difficult to recast into this <br>>new framework.<br><br>Right!  I have considered a number of options for this and believe that<br>in general the best solution is one based on a sort of information<br>theory idea.  The following may be a bit heavy, but once grasped can be<br>seen as a powerful tool.<br><br>To explain this idea, consider that each chord played has notes related<br>by ratios to the tonic.  Suppose that these ratios for a particular<br>chord are 5/4, 15/8, 3/1.  Then it is necessary to find the LCM (lowest<br>common multiple) of the numerators and divisors which are 15 and 8.  My<br>system then consists of counting demerit points for the factors of these<br>two numbers.  We have 2^3 and 3^1*5^1 and so must score demerits by<br>weighting the value for the indices here.  Generally ratios of 2 are<br>most acceptable and then 3 and then 5 etc.  My preferred formula for<br>demerits is in proportion to p*ln(p) so that if 2 is set as unity each 3<br>and 5 will score 2.4 and 5.8 respectively.  In that case 8 and 15 will<br>score 3 and 2.4+5.8 for a total of 11.2 demerits.  If there is a better<br>way to "read" the chord then it will score less.<br><br>Some intervals such as a minor sixth may be interpreted as 7/4, 16/9 or<br>9/8 depending on circumstances.  The one that minimises the demerits is<br>to be considered better because it is more simply related to the other<br>notes present or even previously played.<br><br>BTW, there is a missing graphic on one of your pages.

I have in turn been<br>reading your paper on just intonation, which is located at:<br><br>http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/aji-main.htm<br><br><br>I think you have many fine ideas, such as translating passages of<br>traditionally notated music with variable pitch sets. I will take more<br>time later to delve into the details.<br><br>I have devised a mechanism similar to the keyboard system in your paper.<br>In my translator, a Csound orchestra stores variable pitch sets (12<br>members each) in wave tables, then looks them up as they are needed<br>according to values stored in the score.<br><br>For the purposes of pedagogy, especially at the introductory level, I<br>try to avoid references to traditional tuning systems. Doing so<br>eliminates the unnecessary step of translating from a limited, fixed<br>system into an unlimited one. For this reason, I left comparisons and<br>translations between equal temperament and just intonation out of the<br>most recent version of my paper.<br><br>As to some specific details, I believe you are incorporating intervals<br>in your Mozart example that are not in keeping with the classical style.<br>For example, you use octave equivalents of 7/4 as some of your frequency<br>ratios. I challenge you or anyone to create a dominant seventh chord,<br>using the number seven as a multiple in the denominator of the chordï¿½s<br>seventh, that would not sound out of place in a piece of chamber music<br>by Mozart.<br><br>I would suggest giving it the acid test, which would be to make a WAV<br>sound file of your Mozart score using Csound. With the tempo nice and<br>slow, try 7/4, then 16/9 as the relative frequency for the seventh of<br>your dominant chord.<br><br>Under such conditions, nearly everyone would agree the ratio 16/9 is a<br>much better selection for music of this period. I cannot provide an<br>airtight proof of why this is the case, but my ear and 30+ years<br>experience as a musician tell me it is so. I can point out that from the<br>major scale provided by Helmholtz in his book, ï¿½Sensations of a Toneï¿½,<br>the relationship of 16/9 for the seventh of a dominant seventh chord may<br>be inferred.<br><br>You state, ï¿½Some intervals such as a minor sixth may be interpreted as<br>7/4, 16/9 or 9/8 depending on circumstances.ï¿½<br><br>Without going into the potential merits of your statistical approach to<br>pitch selection, I must point out that 7/4 is approximately a minor<br>seventh; 16/9 is an in-tune minor seventh; and 9/8 is a major second.<br>Certainly none of these ratios is a minor sixth. I assume this is just a<br>grammatical error.<br><br>When I stated in my paper that pieces of traditional tonal music could<br>not be translated without modification from traditional notation into<br>integer ratios, I could have elaborated further with the following two<br>points:<br><br>1. Often, such as when employing chromatic scales, the composer is<br>simply filling in the space from point A to point B with notes. Such<br>passages do not need to be translated, nor often can they be, into<br>ratios. One might even argue that such passages are not really music,<br>but rather more like dust on a mirror.<br><br>2. Composers of the past wrote their music using limited instruments and<br>tuning systems that were available at the time. We should not expect to<br>translate their imperfect creations into a purely mathematical<br>framework; in fact, we should be surprised when it is possible to do so.<br><br>In my paper, I have included one such surprise, complete with a WAV<br>sound file generated in Csound. This entire two-part invention, a lovely<br>gem by Bach, can be tuned according to the principles given 130 years<br>ago by Hermann Helmholtz. The Csound orchestra, score and WAV file are<br>located at:<br><br>http://www.terraworld.net/users/r/robert/htmlpap7.htm<br><br><br>In the Csound score for this two-part invention, every interval is<br>provided in the last two parameter fields, columns 5 and 6. The bars are<br>numbered clearly to facilitate comparison with an actual score.<br><br>Regarding the problems you are having with the graphics in my paper,<br>would you please contact me if you experience additional difficulties?
