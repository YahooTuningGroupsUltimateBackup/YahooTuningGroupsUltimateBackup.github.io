A pitch bend is 3<br>>>instructions.  To send 16 of these takes 3*16/3125*1000=15.36 ms,<br>>>or twice as much if you include the note-ons as well.  Is this<br>>>really a problem?<br>><br>>Not in my experience.  I have used MMT with two Yamaha TX81Z's, the<br>Proteus,<br>>and a Kawai K5m, and I have yet to hear a "blurp" from any style of playing<br>>whatever.  MMT can't play midi files, but it does accept live midi data,<br>>and, if one is bent on playing midi files, a second computer can be used.<br>>Denny is looking to develope MMT further, and would appreciate any input in<br>>that regard.<br>><br>>Before I close this message, I would like to make it clear that I am not an<br>>advocate of the pitch-bend method.  Or of the tuning-table method.  Any<br>>pitch-bend favoritism detected in this letter may be considered fair<br>defense<br>>against those who seem to pick on it without considering cons of sysex or<br>>the work of artists like Denny and Jules Siegel, who use it to great<br>effect.<br>><br>>What I do believe, quite frankly, is that both of these methods suck.  I<br>>don't think that any of us really believe otherwise --  it's all too easy<br>to<br>>let which method is better and why obscure the fact that we're being<br>handing<br>>our hats when it comes to a microtuning solution for midi.  Now, I'm told<br>>that the Symbolic Systems Kyma setup is just about as good as can be, but<br>>I've never seen one.  Has anyone seen one?  Justonic is working on a synth<br>>designed for microtuning called the "Tone Palette".  They claim it is<br>>several orders of magnitude quicker and higher-res than anything else.<br>>They've got a prototype, but are having problems getting to production.<br>>Find out more in the bowels of their site at www.justonic.com.<br>><br>>Carl<br>><br><br>Beware that Pitch Palette does NOT support the MIDI Tuning Dump standard per<br>se!  The standard is too slow for the on-the-fly retuning that their program<br>does.  To retune takes 408 bytes or about 130 ms. which is much too slow.  I<br>asked them about the Ensoniq MR rack which they do support.  It retunes via<br>the MIDI Tuning Dump.  Ensoniq in their superior wisdom designed the MR<br>series with a shortcut mode where you need only send one octave worth of<br>tuning data, 50 bytes or about 16 ms.  Great, for octave repeating tunings.<br><br>Even the MIDI Real Time Single-Note Tuning Change takes 8 bytes plus 4 bytes<br>multiplied by the number of notes to be changed.  This might work but the<br>program would have the added complexity of having to select which notes need<br>to be retuned first in the context of the music.<br><br>I went through all the trouble of looking for a sound card (Turtle Beach<br>Tropez+) that supports the MIDI Tuning Dump standard only to find that the<br>standard is flawed for many applications.  Or is it MIDI in general that is<br>flawed for microtonal applications?<br><br>---Fred<br><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------<br> Fred Kohler, #7-240 Burnside Rd E, Victoria, BC, Canada<br> phone:(250)388-7918  email:Fred_Kohler@bc.sympatico.ca</div>
