[Vosta = Mojanab + whole tone (9/8)].<br>>From exprimental studies on 3 most trustworthy singers, we measured<br>the intervals in mode 'Segah', and find Mojanab = 25/23 (144.36 cents),<br>Vosta = 225/184 (348.29 c). I could generalize this measurment to<br>other mods of ITM. I searched in my references for this intervals<br>and the nearest was 162/149 (144.83c) introduced by Farabi (Ref#1).<br>In next searach, I find that Farabi had vaguely and indirectly<br>introduced 88/81 (143.51c) in relation with 12/11 (Mojanab analogous<br>with Vosta-Zalzal = 27/22) : 88/81= (32/27) / (12/11).<br>(32/27 = Vosta-Qadime)<br>Since the different between 88/81 and 25/23 is very small we selected<br>this interval, and used for playing with computer. It was confirmed<br>by musicians. So 11/9 is the Vosta analogous with this Mojanab.<br>(88/81 * 9/8 = 11/9)<br>According to Arab musicologists, Mojanab = 12/11 and Vosta-Zalzal = 27/22<br>is used in arabian music, but not in ITM.<br><br>We had wrote:<br>>==========================================================================<br>>SYSTEM II is just as SYSTEM I but the minor tone and Major semitone are<br>>different.

The tetrachords of ancient Greece <br>kept the 4/3 inviolable, even as they could be connected for over 2 <br>octaves and could modulate.  Similarly they serve as pillars to Iranian <br>music as recently pointed out by Mr. Moradi in his latest post.  <br>Likewise, Bulgarian music maintains this 4/3 essence, even as smaller <br>intervals are reputed to have no proper names.  <br><br>In Iran the Dastgah is 4/3 concerned, which is then part of a larger <br>Maqam.  Persian/Greek/Thracian (now Bulgarian) were connected musical <br>cultures that counted on the stability of the 4/3.  <br><br>The 3/2 as a basic building block for scales, as 3-limit just intonation, <br>as an ingredient in the aforementioned systems, is paramount in many <br>other musics.  These include Babylonia and Sumer (according to tablets <br>found over a decade ago and reported in the California press), European <br>Middle Ages (probably of Celt origin), much of Chinese music, etc.  Our <br>inherited 12ET is a temperament of this interval, even as it is 11th <br>comma meantone, a homogenization of 12 well-tempered or unequal tuning <br>(for reasons of performers travelling for concerts with new orchestras), <br>an accomadation within 16 cents of 5-limit just intonation, etc.<br> <br>Johnny Reinhard<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@ios.com<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 17 Sep 1995 21:03 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA14509; Sun, 17 Sep 1995 12:03:01 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 17 Sep 1995 12:03:01 -0700<br>Message-Id: <950917190053_71670.2576_HHB66-1@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
