Look at the Greek quadrivium  <br>to see how music fits in:<br><br>        MATHEMATICS                    GEOMETRY<br>          (number)                    (magnitude)<br><br>           MUSIC                       ASTRONOMY<br>    (number as embodied          (magnitude as embodied<br>         in sound)                 in celestial motion)<br><br>The schism between the sciences dealing with the discrete vs those  <br>dealing with the continuous (number vs magnitude) was a huge factor  <br>in the development of mathematical methods. It was precisely because  <br>Greek geometry *could* deal with the continuous and the irrational  <br>that it flourished, rather than Greek mathematics, which dealt only  <br>with the discrete and the rational. So, for example, a proof of what  <br>we think of today as a simple algebraic identity like <br><br><br>   (a-b)^2 (a-b)(a+b)<br><br>had to be ingeniously couched in purely geometrical terms.  Eudoxus  <br>(a contemporary of Plato) put forward a brilliant theory of  <br>irrational proportions that could have incorporated them into Greek  <br>mathematics, but unfortunately no-one really took him up on it till  <br>the late 19th century. (By the way, Plato shouldn't be mentioned in  <br>connection with hiding the fact that there are irrational numbers --  <br>somewhere he says that any man unaware of their existence is no  <br>better than a swine...)<br><br>I guess if Pythagoreans could have construed music as *magnitude*  <br>embodied in sound (i.e. subordinate to geometry) rather than *number*  <br>embodied in sound, there would never have been a problem with  <br>irrational proportions in music.  Don't jump to any conclusions and  <br>think that Aristoxenus favoured such a switch in music's allegiance,  <br>however: as mentioned already in this thread he places music  <br>subordinate to nothing save perception, as exemplified in his  <br>do-it-yourself investigation (he never called it a "proof") of  <br>whether the fourth contains two and a half tones, which you can find  <br>at the end of book II of the Elements of Harmonics. <br><br><br>Anyway, despite Greek geometry's perfectly adequate treatment of  <br>irrational proportions, repugnance towards them in areas where  <br>*number* was thought to matter was very real, and is evidenced in  <br>many writings dealing with "mathematical" disciplines. One fantastic  <br>example, mentioned by Aristides Quintilianus and also found in the  <br>Hippocratic *Endemics*, tells physicians that diseases whose symptoms  <br>appear in "concordant" ratios (like one day for every two they are  <br>absent) are not dangerous, while those whose symptoms appear in  <br>irrational or continuous proportions are "deadly, and to be feared".  <br>Heck, even Aristotle thought that pleasant colours resulted from  <br>elementary particles of black and white mixed in simple ratios,  <br>whereas irrational proportions gave rise to unpleasant colours (this  <br>is somewhere in *De Sensu*). And as far as musical thinking goes,  <br>here's Barker's translation of Adrastus:<br><br>      Under irrational relations noises are irrational<br>      and unmelodic, and should not strictly even be called<br>      notes, but only sounds; but under relations that place<br>      them in certain relations to one another, they are<br>      [...] strictly and properly notes.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 5 Mar 1997 05:17 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06286; Wed, 5 Mar 1997 05:17:10 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06248<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id UAA16996; Tue, 4 Mar 1997 20:15:41 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 4 Mar 1997 20:15:41 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.95.970304224511.17203A-100000@u3.farm.idt.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5026 href="#5026">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MorriSonics@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/1997 7:48:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>-------------------- Begin Original Message --------------------<br><br>Message text written by INTERNET:tuning@ella.mills.edu<br><br>"Now, surely everybody who reads this list is aware that<br>C# and Db are physically identical on a piano.
