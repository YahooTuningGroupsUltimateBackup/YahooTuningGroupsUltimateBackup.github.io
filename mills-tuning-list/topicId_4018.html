I've only looked<br>at it briefly, but it seems to be pretty cool from what I've seen of it so<br>far.<br><br>   http://homerecording.miningco.com/library/weekly/aa092397.htm</div><h3><a id=8529 href="#8529">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/28/1998 3:10:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> What kind of devices exist to measure the exact frequency of any particular<br>> sound. And more specifically are there any that are fairly inexpensive?<br><br>   I designed some flutes back in high school using a frequency counter I<br>built from a kit.  It was, however, designed to work with much radio<br>frequencies, so what they advertised as astounding resolution to plus or minus<br>1Hz, wasn't so impressive for audio frequencies.  But I was able to get away<br>with by averaging several measurements.</div>
