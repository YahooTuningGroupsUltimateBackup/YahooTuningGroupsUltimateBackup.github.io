I should have calculated before asking questions. What I had<br> in mind was the potentiality of using the circle of 7:4s instead of 3:2s. And<br> if the double 88s could mean something similar to that.....ah! have to calcul<br>ate again.....anyway...it wasn't circle at last! So it means getting rid of th<br>e octaves will bring in a good chance for each equal tempered notes becomming <br>a root of a well tuned chord, doen't it? Is this just a FAQ? Maybe it is.

A program is usually quicker though.<br><br>The command is called PYTHAGOREAN. It can calculate any Pythagorean <br>scale. First it wants to know how many notes the scale must get.<br>Type for instance: 26. Then, what the formal octave must be. I use the <br>word "formal" to distinguish it from the octave of 2/1. It may be any <br>value namely. But type for instance: 2/1. This will be the value of <br>the last note in the scale and the interval that is subtracted every<br>time the cycle of fifths passes over the last note. Instead of "formal<br>octave", "interval of equivalence" is sometimes used. Then the scale<br>degree for the formal fifth must be given (again to distinguish it<br>from the perfect fifth). In 12-tET the degree of the fifth is 7. Here<br>one can also enter 0, which means "I don't know" and then the program<br>takes the nearest degree depending on the formal fifth to be given. So<br>let's enter 0. Then enter the formal fifth, for instance: 7/4. Last,<br>it is asked how many of the notes must result from fifths stacked in<br>the downward direction. In this example they will be: 8/7, 64/49, etc.<br>Going upwards you get 7/4, 49/32, etc. Let's enter: 10. That's all.<br>The scale that results is this one:<br><br>  1:      16807/16384        44.12955<br>  2:  282475249/268435456    88.25910<br>  3:        132.389 cents    132.3886<br>  4:     131072/117649       187.0446<br>  5:          8/7            231.1741 septimal whole tone<br>  6:       2401/2048         275.3037<br>  7:   40353607/33554432     319.4333<br>  8:        363.563 cents    363.5628<br>  9:    1048576/823543       418.2188<br> 10:         64/49           462.3483<br> 11:        343/256          506.4779<br> 12:    5764801/4194304      550.6074<br> 13:        594.737 cents    594.7370<br> 14:    8388608/5764801      649.3930<br> 15:        512/343          693.5225<br> 16:         49/32           737.6521<br> 17:     823543/524288       781.7817<br> 18:        825.911 cents    825.9112<br> 19:   67108864/40353607     880.5672<br> 20:       4096/2401         924.6967<br> 21:          7/4            968.8264 harmonic seventh<br> 22:     117649/65536        1012.955<br> 23: 1977326743/1073741824   1057.085<br> 24:  536870912/282475249    1111.741<br> 25:      32768/16807        1155.871<br> 26:          2/1            1200.000 octave<br><br>With the command SHOW CYCLE we can find out where this leaves the<br>"wolf" 7/4 and see that it is placed between degrees 3 and 24.<br>We can also see that the scale is fairly close to 26-tET.
