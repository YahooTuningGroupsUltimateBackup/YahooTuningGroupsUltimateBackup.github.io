I have written to Yamaha asking <br>them to clarify their position regarding manufacture of 19TET instruments <br>by entities other than themselves.<br>	There is plenty of prior art out there to invalidate all but the <br>most creative claims for new musical instruments, but when large <br>corporations get legal means to profit from a popular idea, they usually <br>are very aggressive in their approach. Am I paranoid then? No, I guess I <br>was just a little tightly wound. Woaa! What was that????..........Aggghhh!<br><br>John Starrett<br>http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</div>
