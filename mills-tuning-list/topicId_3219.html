What could be more important than having the<br>firmest possible intuitive grasp of how a new tuning sounds?<br><br>   Well OK, I don't want to sound fanatical of course;  performance<br>fluidity and a firm grasp of theoretical underpinnings are certainly<br>important as well.  And comparative studies of one tuning to another can<br>provide valuable "cross-fertilization" of ideas.  These are certainly<br>worthy pursuits.  But being able to anticipate the sound of the notes, and<br>the notes for the sound, before they are actually played is absolutely<br>critical to composition and improvisation.  And that's equally critical<br>whether the notes are on the composer's score or on the improvisor's<br>instrument.<br><br>   Ear training, I believe, is all the more critical in the realm of the<br>more nontraditional tunings - tunings such as 88CET that are based upon<br>historically rare pitch relationships, like 9:7 or 11:6.  And it's more<br>vital still for nontraditional tunings - also like 88CET - where those rare<br>pitch relationships are organized into structures unrelated to traditional<br>diatonic scales.  That as opposed to, for example, tunings like 31TET or<br>41TET that offer traditional diatonic structures with nontraditional<br>pitches as available alternatives.<br><br>   This nontraditional-structuring situation, despite opening all kinds of<br>exciting new avenues in music, means that you have to learn more than pure<br>ear training.<br><br><br><br>But Wait!  There's More!<br>------------------------<br><br>   When you have these sorts of nontraditional structures, this skill of<br>knowing what something sounds like before you play it also requires another<br>kind of learning.  In 88CET, we have to replace the knowledge we learned as<br>kids that, for example, A-major scale is spelled A B C# D E F# G# A, with<br>some new information.  We have to do that for two very important reasons:<br>1.  Major scale?  What major scale?!  There is no major scale in 88CET.<br>2.  There are other scale and pitch relationships patterns that are<br>    interesting, but none of them are spelled A B C# D E F# G# A.<br><br>   So having a firm grasp of, for example, what an A ascending to the<br>next-higher D will sound like in 88CET depends not only on the purely<br>ear-training task of knowing what a 9:7 supramajor third sounds like, but<br>also upon the strictly intellectual task of memorizing that A up to D is a<br>supramajor third.<br><br>   But this task of learning an alternative set of pitch nomenclature and<br>pitch relationships is not as big a problem as it might seem.  First of<br>all, I doubt if any of you will start confusing the two systems.  Once you<br>learn that the pitch a perfect fifth above C in 88CET is A, I really don't<br>think that you'll suddenly start getting confused about what interval C up<br>to G is in traditional tunings.  After all, it's not like you're suddenly<br>going to forget the English word for that thing you drive to work everyday<br>just because you've now learned the Spanish word "coche"!<br><br>   Secondly, as with practicing an instrument or so many other things in<br>life, whether learning a new system of pitch relationships proves tedious<br>or fun depends a lot on your attitude.  I personally find it intriguing to<br>learn an all new way of thinking.  That in itself is fun in its own way.<br><br>   So there's more to this task than strictly pure ear training, but the<br>goal is ultimately the same:  Again, to know what the notes (be they on the<br>page, in the mind, or on an instrument of improvisation) sound like before<br>you play them.  I'll never put this entire task under the broad heading of<br>ear training, since that is the ultimate goal, despite the additional<br>learning tasks.</div>
