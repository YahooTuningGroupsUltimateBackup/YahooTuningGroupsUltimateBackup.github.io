Haverstick)</h3><span>7/3/1996 11:10:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Haverstick here...I just listened to BB King Live at the Regal, and as<br>it did many years ago, it blew my mind...it is a great record, and it<br>got me to wanting to say a few things about blues on this forum. Of<br>course, blues has always been "microtonal" because of the practice<br>of taking certain notes and bending them...as soon as you do this, all<br>the rules change. For example, Albert King was a master at moving<br>around in his bends from the flat 3rd of a scale up to the Ma.3rd;<br>from a 4th to a 5th; and from a b7th to the root. Albert stills kills<br>me, because he could take numerous choruses, using just a few notes,<br>but the many different ways that he subtly changed his pitch was a <br>real kick...he greatly influenced many of the great rock guitarists,<br>such as Clapton, Hendrix, and Stevie Ray Vaughn, so Albert was slippin'<br>them microtonal thingies to white kids 30 years ago. Needless to say,<br>this was all done by feel, and is a real natural part of many different<br>culture's musical expression. I mean, listen to Native American singing,<br>and it's not so easy to get a grasp on it...it's very "simple", but it<br>has absolutely nothing to do with such European concepts such as equal<br>temperament.<br><br>Blues players are IMPROVISORS; this is essential to the art itself, and<br>is where "academic" (sorry...the academics invented that word, not me)<br>music parts ways with not only blues, but much of the other musics<br>of the world as well. This tendancy to improvise is what makes blues<br>so difficult...you are really handed a sort of loose chordal and melodic<br>history, and it's up to you to stand on your own and come up with some-<br>thing in the tradition, yet yours. This is where 19 has freed me up to<br>take some standard American music cliches, and mess with them a bit.<br><br><br>I've always thought it interesting that much of the innovation in 1960's<br>heavy rock and jazz was from folks who had a real heavy grounding in the<br>blues, and then messed with it. Hendrix was a staple on the R&B circuit<br>before he hit it big, and was a killer blues player. Ornette Coleman<br>was a gutbucket tenor honker before he helped to pioneer "free" jazz;<br>Coltrane apprenticed with Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson before he went way<br>out there; and, I used to see a guy in Kansas City who was a great blues<br>player (still is...Ed Toler), but also was into free stuff in a real<br>organic way. The list is endless, but again, so called microtones have<br>really been a part of the mainstream sound for many years.<br><br>And talk about tone! Blues guys are the masters at using the pure sound<br>of a note for many different emotional reasons...eventually, guys like<br>Jeff Beck, Hendrix, and others got into letting their guitars feed back,<br>using the amplifier as a part of the sound chain, and I tell you all sorts<br>of neat frequencies and pitches would happen...listen to "Machine Gun"<br>by Hendrix, which is a real masterpiece of happenin' music.<br><br>Over the years, I've seen a lot of great musicians in various fields,<br>and I'll still say that a deep slow blues is probably one of life's<br>transcendent moments. When I hear the Wolf, Muddy, or BB and Albert<br>King lay it in there, it's as fresh as the first time I heard it. So,<br>I love the intellectual side of tunings, and the math and all of that<br>is intriguing, but my own humble roots of hanging out in blues bars<br>in St. Louis and KC have really payed off since I got into other systems.<br>Of course, forget tunings and such for a moment...it's REALLY the soul<br>we want in our art, and the blues got it, no problem. In fact, that's,<br>for me, why I don't like a lot of stuff by folks such as Schoenberg;<br>God help us he was a genius, but his serial stuff leaves me feeling<br>like a bad session at the analyst's.<br><br>Anyway, I want to talk more about this field later...when you get in there<br>and sort of musically analyze what's going with blues structures, it is<br>fascinating and totally unlike much of "traditional" western music...and,<br>it's relevant as hell (which is also seeming more relevant all the time),<br>since it's slimy little bends have been inspiring zillions of folks to<br>do all sorts of things for years. Yet, I still know some people who<br>think "classical" music is "superior" to blues; why, I don't know. But,<br>the form of the blues is strong and powerful, and can be bent is couln-<br>less ways...and, of course when I say blues, I also mean jazz as well.<br>My dear teacher George Keith used to say JS Bach and Charley Parker were<br>the greatest of all musicians, and to this day, I don't think he's too<br>far off the truth.<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 4 Jul 1996 15:02 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id GAA15578; Thu, 4 Jul 1996 06:02:23 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 4 Jul 1996 06:02:23 -0700<br>Message-Id: <9607041301.AA10846@arthaud.saclay.cea.fr><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
