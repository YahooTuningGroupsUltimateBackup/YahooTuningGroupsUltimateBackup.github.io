But,<br>I must say, that perhaps the neatest thing for me was that kids of<br>differnt ages were on hand, playing the instruments, and hearing sounds<br>which could affect their musicality for the rest of their lives. If we<br>micropioneers want to truly change things, we must educate others in a<br>real natural way, and kids is the best place to start. My 10 year old<br>cousin was playing Xmas carols on Erv's 22 tone tubalong, and no one<br>seemed to thionk it was WEIRD...very cool.<br>We need more of these festivals to happen, on a regular basis, we need<br>books written about tunings in a down to earth language, and we need to<br>demystify this whole field if we want it to spread...McLaren's post<br>about the economics of 12eq was great, and underscores an important<br>point: money, not art, is often a motivating factor in this world, so we<br>need to find a way to make beautiful art a part of mainstream<br>culture...only a lot of great compositions, and the skills to get them<br>to folks everywhere, will break the stranglehold of the dreaded 12 tone<br>temperament...Hstick<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 16 Nov 1996 00:07 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13565; Sat, 16 Nov 1996 00:08:19 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13577<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id PAA01235; Fri, 15 Nov 1996 15:08:17 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 15 Nov 1996 15:08:17 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199611152307.SAA02644@freenet5.carleton.ca><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
