It was<br>immediately obvious to me that many deliscious notes were being absolutely<br>ignored. I spent the bulk of the time allotted to the monochord <br>listening to such lovely intervals as 8/7 7/6 12/11 7/4 etc. But I was<br>not satisfied with hearing them in stark isolation, so I built a simple<br>lyre to have a few of them in relation to one another. Since then I have<br>built several other lyres, a movable-fretted long-necked lute (which I<br>call "saz" the normal turkish name for this sort of thing-- I really<br>ought to call it "pandura"...), and a tetrahedral double zither: all<br>of which I tune up in more-or-less exotic versions of just intonation.<br>I recently bought an old DX-7 with the E! card, so there is a wholly<br>new set of approaches to microtonality opening up: it's real exciting!<br>When I play wind instruments, I am drawn to the exotic intervals, like<br>the neutral third which a recorder gives when you ignore the "normal"<br>forked fingerings. I especially like to treat it as a neutral second 12/11<br>by shifting the "do" or "sa".  I am quite fond of Indian music, both <br>classical and folk; this spills over into fondness for drone-based highly <br>melodic styles. In 1980 I had the great fortune to hear a series of <br>lectures/concerts of Erv Wilson, Ivor Darreg, Johnny Glasier, et al. in<br>San Diego. I played for a single semester in the Partch Ensemble at<br>San Diego State, but did not manage the transition from St John's (pop.<br>300) to SDSU (pop. 30,000) at all well. I have continued playing in <br>small ensembles and listening to all the xenharmonic sounds I can find.<br>I have recently sung Lou Harrison's "Koro Sutro" *twice*. The first time<br>changed my life in an unexpected direction: it kindled my love of Esperanto<br>the international language. I am sure that many of you detwelvulators know<br>that Lou Harrison is a longtime advocate of Esperanto, but how many are <br>aware that Ivor Darreg also was an Esperantist? [John Chalmers told me <br>this.] I know that at least one other lurker has some experience with <br>this fresh, new language. I suspect that there is a kind of kinship<br>between the sense of discovery of fresh terrain which links new tunings<br>and this new language. I am beginning to integrate the two strains by<br>composing songs with Esperanto texts using xenharmonic modes. I am most<br>struck by the elegant simplicity of several of the pentatonic scales<br>described in Harrison's "Music Primer". Although I like to hear others'<br>works in dense fields of little intervals, I enjoy the spaciousness of<br>the pentatonic and hexatonic modes. This tuning list has been a constant<br>source of delight for me, especially the enthusiastic ravings of Brian <br>McLaren. I wish that the anti-Brian crowd would just learn to use a kill<br>file and stop complaining! I am deeply disturbed by suggestions of<br>censorship....<br>Keep those wild tunings happening!<br>Amike salutas vin<br>Miko. <br><br><br>Miko SLOPER              elna@netcom.com              USA  (510) 653 0998<br>Direktoro de la          ftp.netcom.com:/pub/el/elna   fax (510) 653 1468 <br>Centra Oficejo de la     Learn Esperanto!
