A. Mathieu's notion that<br>small-integer ratio intervals are relatively easy to<br>find _by singing_ because our bodies have cavities<br>that resonate to these harmonic frequencies. [See his<br>recently published book "Harmonic Experience"]. He<br>gives lessons on how to find these ratios and then<br>build scalar patterns with them while playing a drone.<br>This could certainly be one avenue thru which to approach<br>this subject.<br><br>My own viewpoint is that the series of prime numbers<br>acts as some kind of cognitive template into which we<br>try to fit the patterns of frequency relationships we<br>are hearing as we listen to music.  It's my belief<br>(disputed by some folks on this list) that individual<br>prime numbers have "affects" associated with them.<br>I'm not going to try to define or describe them --<br>suffice to say that each prime is unique in sound<br>and feeling.<br><br>Following this line of reasoning, perhaps people<br>have some kind of innate feeling for or affinity to<br>particular prime numbers?  It would be interesting<br>to get feedback on this from others on the list.<br>For example, does Gary Morrison have a special<br>liking only for 7:4, or does it extend to other<br>7-limit ratios as well?  I personally really love<br>using 13:8 and 11:6 (separately) in chords, but<br>haven't really done enough listening experiments<br>to know how much I like particular primes as a set.<br><br>I think Gary's other comment, about how a particular<br>interval can pick up associations from tunes in<br>which it's used, is also a very valid point.<br><br>- Joe Monzo<br>  monz@juno.com<br>  http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html<br><br>___________________________________________________________________<br>You don't need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html<br>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</div><h3><a id=8798 href="#8798">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.
