Learning to set meantone, a Kirnberger or<br>a<br>> Werkmeister by ear isn't terribly hard - while tuning 12tet is<br>really<br>> specialist work unless you're using a digital tuner or a strobe.<br>> <br>> At both of my Universities in the States, and here at the Frankfurt<br>> Musikhochschule, the early keyboard faculty and students are<br>themselves<br>> responsible for tuning the instruments. <br><br>	Most piano tuning supply houses should sell a G# fork at 415.3 cps. <br>I would be interested in how the students are instructed (learn) to<br>tune the harpsichords and fortepianos. <br><br>Richard Moody<br>Piano Tuner Technician<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 4 Jul 1997 07:17 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04748; Fri, 4 Jul 1997 07:18:08 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 4 Jul 1997 07:18:08 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04707<br>Received: (qmail 19718 invoked from network); 4 Jul 1997 05:17:59 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 4 Jul 1997 05:17:59 -0000<br>Message-Id: <3.0.2.32.19970703221147.0069a774@adnc.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5754 href="#5754">ðŸ”—</a>DMB5561719@aol.com</h3><span>7/5/1997 9:48:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>In a message dated 97-07-05 00:51:58 EDT, <br>"Jonathan M.
