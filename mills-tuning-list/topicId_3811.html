There have been more<br>>recent studies that suggest that lower frequencies are perceived very<br>>differently from higher ones.  <br><br>Are you holding back on me?<br><br>>I certainly don't claim to be an expert on the topic though.  Brian<br>>McLaren has surveyed a LOT of recent literature on the topic.<br><br>Did you get an idea of what conclusions he reached?<br><br><br>***Jesse Gay wrote***<br><br>>The basilar membrane is shaped like an elongated triangle.<br>>Different areas resonate at different frequencies, just as piano strings<br>>of different lengths resonate at different frequencies.  So, when a sound<br>>wave travels down the basilar membrane, the membrane gets most excited @<br>>spots which resonate @ the frequency of the sound wave, or any of its<br>>partials.<br><br>So it's the width at various points?  How do you respond to the assertion<br>made by Ewan Macpherson that it's the stiffness at various points?<br><br>>This explanation is the basis for the place theory of pitch perception,<br>>which, as you probably know, is not the whole story.<br><br>Actually, I've heard this before, but I've never heard what the whole story<br>actually is.<br><br><br>***From Ewan A. Macpherson***<br><br>>You're right, a point on the BM can't respond to only a single <br>>frequency.  Instead each point acts like a bandpass filter. <br>>Excitation causes a travelling wave to move down the BM, and <br>>different frequency components of the wave peak at different places <br>>as it progresses.  The portion of the BM nearest the middle ear is <br>>stiffest and responds best to high frequencies, and the membrane <br>>becomes increasingly floppy along its length, lowering the "best <br>>frequency" of the bandpass filters.<br><br>So it's the stiffness at various points?  How do you react to the statement<br>made by Jesse Gay that it's the width at various point?<br><br>And what does this have to say about Helmholtzian place theory, and its<br>explaination of the critical band phenomenon?<br><br>Carl</div>
