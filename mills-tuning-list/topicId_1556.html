Cyrus Teed and Georges <br>Ivanovich Gurdjieff were mentioned here, and Moondog was in Johnny <br>Reinhard's CD collction. Of course, the rest of the musical establishment <br>views us as weirdos, and would certainly put Partch, Darreg, and Ives into a <br>Big Book of Musical Weirdos . . . Beethoven was of course the weirdest of <br>all . . .<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 15 Jan 1997 21:01 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA20215; Wed, 15 Jan 1997 21:04:21 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA20172<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA07749; Wed, 15 Jan 1997 12:04:18 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 12:04:18 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701151452_MC2-F50-E164@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
