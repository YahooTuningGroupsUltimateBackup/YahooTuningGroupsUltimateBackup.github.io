But the ability <br>to prove 12ET strictly by ear, by comparing the beat speeds of adjacent <br>intervals, was not common until the early years of this century.<br><br>   Part of the problem was inertia.  Piano tuners did not use the <br>harmonic series as a tool, as they do today.  They prefered the results <br>of the older methods, which were based on a melodic comparison of <br>intervals.<br><br>   Owen Jorgensen is not on line, but I'm sure he would appreciate any <br>correspondence on matters of tuning.
