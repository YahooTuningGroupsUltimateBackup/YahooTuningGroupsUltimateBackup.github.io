Has anyone ever investigated this?<br>>It might be a fruitful exercise.<br><br>First, let's get some acoustics straight. Beats only occur between tones <br>that are very close (within a critical bandwidth) and are never heard as <br>musical tones, even when they are rapid enough to match the frequency of <br>audible tones. Helmholtz is a good reference for all this, and should be <br>quite readable to a 19th century mind like Ray's :). However, at loud <br>volumes, nonlinearities in our ears cause "difference tones" as well as <br>other, weaker "combination tones" to be heard. So Ray's analysis is <br>mathematically valid but applies not to "beats" at all but to difference <br>tones. Difference tones are important (Heinz Bohlen believes difference <br>tones to be the foundation of all harmony) while matching beat rates to <br>scale pitches can have no musical significance whatsoever.<br><br>Now, to answer the question, with "beats" changed to "difference tones," I <br>believe Erv Wilson's meta-meantone tuning has some difference tones that <br>are in tune with each other. It should also be possible to devise meantone <br>tunings where some difference tones are in tune with some scale tones. <br>Perhaps John Chalmers or Manuel Op de Coul have compiled a list of such <br>tunings? The nice thing about meantone tuning, of course, is that re-la is <br>what it "wants to be."<br><br>--<br>P.S.
