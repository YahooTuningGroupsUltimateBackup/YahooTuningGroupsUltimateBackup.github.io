I am mostly interested in finding out whether <br>>so-called adaptive tuning techniques may be implemented on the trombone and<br>>if so, whether anyone has worked them through and there is anything published<br>>on the subject.<br>><br>>Any information will be much appreciated. <br><br>I personally have not seen anything published on the subject, and I'm kind<br>of surprised, because trombone seems like a perfect instrument for just<br>intonation.<br><br>As a T-bone player myself, I know that we routinely make minor adjustments<br>to the slide position as we play, depending on the surrounding notes of the<br>chord.  And I've been thinking about working out the math for what slide<br>positions might be needed for, say, a 5-limit just intonation piece.<br><br>I suppose whatever notation is used can be a modified version of the "slide<br>position number" notation - 1 through 7.  Something like "This Eb is in '3rd<br>Position', but that Eb is in 'Long 3rd Postion'".  It'll be a little odd,<br>'cuz the conventional slide positions get further apart as you go toward 7,<br>and they're sort of "equal temperament" based.<br><br>What other mailing list did you post your inquiry to?  Let me know what you<br>come up with.  Good luck!<br><br>--Mark<br><br>P.S.:  The "list processor" that the TUNING list is on may have recently<br>gone "on the blink".  I haven't received any new mail from it for a few days.<br><br>P.P.S.:  How are things up there in Cambridge?  I might go to my 20 year MIT<br>reunion in 1999.  I'm sure things have changed!<br>+------------------------------------------------------+<br>| Mark Nowitzky                                        |<br>| email:  nowitzky@alum.mit.edu    AIM:  Nowitzky      |<br>| www:    http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky          |<br>|         "If you haven't visited Mark Nowitzky's home |<br>|         page recently, you haven't missed much..."   |<br>+------------------------------------------------------+<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1531<br>*************************</div>
