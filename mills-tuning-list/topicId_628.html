When editing the tuning table, although the nominal resolution is 1 cent, <br>the true resolution is in fact a few cents, as nominal 1 or 2 cent changes <br>often result in exactly the same rate of beating.<br><br>2. When changing the pitch of a voice, the resolution does appear to be in <br>fact 1 cent. However, the amount of detuning displayed may be inaccurate. <br>For example, a perfect match to the third harmonic is found at 1 octave, 7 <br>semitones, and 00 cents, instead of 1 octave, 7 semitones, and 02 cents.<br><br>3. Interpolating often produces strange results. It appears to insist that <br>all steps be exactly the same number of cents, and takes the liberty of <br>changing one of your endpoint pitches to make this possible. Often, the <br>resulting interpolation is backwards, decreasing in pitch rather than <br>increasing as you go up the keyboard, with one huge step from an extremely <br>low note to an extremely high note in the middle. The order in which you <br>specify the endpoints does not seem to matter.<br><br>4. Extrapolating seems to work fine. The display won't show you assignments <br>higher than C8, but they're there, up to a point. Some high notes sound <br>really distorted though -- must be the digital architecture.<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 20 Jul 1996 03:40 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id SAA16796; Fri, 19 Jul 1996 18:40:51 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 19 Jul 1996 18:40:51 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9607192105.A21238-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
