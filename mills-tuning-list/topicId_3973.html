Introduction<br>---------------<br><br>Recently I posted a just intonation tuning very closely approximating<br>12-tone equal temperament (12-tet), using the schisma fifth<br>16384:10935 -- which had, in fact, been proposed by Johann Philipp<br>Kirnberger as early as 1766.<br><br>>From a xenharmonic perspective, this interval (about 700.00128 cents)<br>and the fourth of 16384:10935 (its octave complement) occur in various<br>musical systems and tunings, including Alexander Ellis's variant on<br>Helmholtz's 1/8-schisma temperament[1].<br><br>It is only fair to add that while Kirnberger and other developers and<br>exponents of this interval (Lambert, Marpurg, and later Farey) were<br>indeed seeking a just intonation approach for tuning the virtual<br>equivalent of 12-tet, the schisma fourth or fifth is for Ellis<br>actually a "defective" interval in a tuning scheme striving for pure<br>fifths and thirds -- albeit hardly a "Wolf" <grin>.[2]<br><br>Apart from teaching me once again that it can indeed be hard to come<br>upon a really "new" tuning, my encounter with Kirnberger's<br>quasi-12-tet scheme has suggested an even more intricate scheme with<br>even larger integer ratios for tuning an approximation of one of my<br>favorite scales: 17-tet.<br><br>To get this idea, I needed only to realize that a 17-tet fifth of<br>about 705.882 cents is very close to a pure fifth at 3:2 (about 701.955<br>cents) plus _two_ schismas of about 1.95372 cents -- or 705.862 cents.<br><br>While such an approximation of 17-tet might be even more unlikely than<br>Kirnberger's quasi-12-tet for anyone actually to tune, I found it a<br>charming exercise in musico-mathematical poetry. Each interval in the<br>chain seems full of historical associations lending their flavor to<br>the intrigue of the whole.<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>2. Of fifths, thirds, and a curious semitone<br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Our object is to arrive at a generating interval for our quasi-17-tet<br>scale: a fifth two schismas wider than pure. This turns out easy to<br>arrange on paper, although even less easy than quasi-12-tet to tune in<br>practice. If one accepts Barbour's description of Kirnberger's scheme<br>for the latter task as "roundabout,"[3] I'm not quite sure what term<br>might apply to this scheme -- possibly "labyrinthine"?<br><br>We begin with a chain of 9 pure fifths up, or fourths down where<br>called for to keep within the desired octave, arriving at a schisma<br>minor third of 19683:16384, e.g.<br><br>c-g-d-a-e-b-f#-c#-g#-d#<br><br>This interval of c-d#, a Pythagorean augmented second, is precisely<br>one schisma wider than a pure m3 at 6:5 (about 315.64 cents), or<br>about 317.595 cents.<br><br>If we add another chain of nine pure fifths, we get a kind of curious<br>"diminished fifth" equal in size to precisely two such schisma thirds:<br><br>     19683:16384<br>----------------------<br>c-g-d-a-e-b-f#-c#-g#-d#-a#-e#-b#-f##-c##-g##-d##-a##-e##<br>                     -----------------------------------<br>                                19683:16384<br><br>The interval c-e## might be described in two ways. From a Pythagorean<br>viewpoint, it consists of two augmented seconds each a Pythagorean<br>comma (531441:524288, about 23.46 cents) wider than a usual m3 at<br>32:27 (about 294.13 cents).<br><br>>From a 5-limit perspective, it could also be described as being formed<br>from two minor thirds each a schisma wider than 6:5, producing an<br>interval _two_ schismas wider than a diminished fifth of 36:25 (about<br>631.13 cents).<br><br>Either calculation gives us a ratio for c-e## of 387420489:268435456,<br>or the square of our schisma m3 ratio 19683:16384 -- about 635.190<br>cents.<br><br>To get from this curious interval to our quasi-17-tet fifth, we move<br>first a just 5:4 major third up, and then a just 6:5 minor third<br>down. The difference of these two intervals defines a 5-limit<br>chromatic semitone of 25:24, or about 70.672 cents. Adding this 25:24<br>interval to our "double minor schisma third" c-e##, we arrive at the<br>not inconsiderable ratio of 3228504075:2147483648, or about 705.862<br>cents.<br><br>While conventional Pythagorean notation nicely expresses all of our<br>chain of fifths from c to e##, representing these last steps invites a<br>notation showing variances from a Pythagorean tuning in syntonic<br>commas of 81:80 or about 21.506 cents. Thus we might write the<br>intervals up a major third and then down a minor third as:<br><br>e##-g###(-1)<br>g###(-1)-e###(-2)<br><br>and the final quasi-17-tet fifth (two schismas wider than just) as:<br><br>c-e###(-2).<br><br>Here each sharp raises a note by a Pythagorean apotome of 2187:2048<br>(about 113.69 cents), while each parenthetical negative number lowers<br>a note by that number of syntonic commas. Starting with a regular<br>Pythagorean major third of c-e (81:64, about 407.82 cents), adding an<br>apotome for each of the three sharps to obtain c-e###, and then<br>subtracting two syntonic commas to obtain c-e###(-2), brings us to the<br>expected fifth-plus-two-schismas.<br><br>It is understandable why tuning 18 pure fifths, a pure major third,<br>and then a pure minor third down to arrive at a quasi-17-tet fifth may<br>be more enchanting in theory than in practice.<br><br>>From a theoretical and contemplative viewpoint, however, each step has<br>its significance. The familiar Pythagorean intervals of the 18-fifth<br>chain c-e## represent the classical Gothic style from Perotin and<br>earlier to Machaut. The schisma minor thirds c-d# and d#-e##, also a<br>part of this chain, recall the era around 1400 when such thirds<br>heralded a new approach to keyboard tunings and music. The 25:24<br>semitone, and the pure 5:4 and 6:5 third together defining it, evoke<br>for me the tertian just intonation of the Renaissance.<br><br><br>--------------------------------<br>3. How accurate is quasi-17-tet?<br>--------------------------------<br><br>Comparing a true 17-tet fifth of 10/17 octave (about 705.8824 cents)<br>with our quasi-17-tet fifth-plus-two-schismas (about 705.8624 cents),<br>we have a difference of about 0.0200 cents, or 1/50 cent.<br><br>If we generate a quasi-17-tet scale, seeking to close the circle at<br>the octave by tuning 17 such fifths, then we will fall slightly short<br>of this octave (17 fifths - 10 octaves) by a comma having a ratio<br>equal to <br><br>                       (3228504075:2147483648)^17<br>                       --------------------------<br>                                  2^10<br><br>or the rather large integer ratio<br><br>449803428507699070078142388657801512055553043909284604089805711<br>333684881797231175590710351961955330881848802903918457871062446<br>517174209283548407256603240966796875:<br>449891379454319638281053850768598185886969711830191663310075557<br>261183758067148787031904068610389085714992091063352089512320826<br>605549429968900851518086516385513472<br><br>It will be seen that the two almost equal terms of this ratio are each<br>somewhat larger than a googol, or 10^100. Since 17-quasi-tet fifths<br>yield an interval slightly _smaller_ than an octave, our ratio is<br>slightly _less_ than unity, or about 0.99984775469834538259397238309.<br><br>Converting to cents, we find that the quasi-17-tet comma is equal to<br>about -0.33847849865247873430151573027 cents, with the negative sign<br>again showing that in this tuning 17 fifths is a bit _smaller_ than 10<br>octaves.<br><br>This approximation of 17-tet thus involves an error factor about 20<br>times larger than in Kirnberger's quasi-12-tet[4], but still somewhat<br>smaller than that of 1/3-comma meantone vis-a-vis 19-tet, or 1/4-comma<br>meantone vis-a-vis 31-tet. These two meantone tunings have commas of<br>about .9385 cents wide (19 fifths/11 octaves) and 6.0687 cents narrow<br>(31 fifths/18 octaves) respectively.  <br><br>If we assume a truncated quasi-17-tet tuning with a pure 2:1 octave,<br>then the 17th fifth would be _larger_ than the others by the comma of<br>about.338 cents, thus being equal to about 706.201 cents, as compared<br>to the other fifths at 705.86 cents, or 705.88 cents in 17-tet<br>proper. Such a small divergence should hardly have a tangible effect<br>on the character of the tuning vis-a-vis true 17-tet.<br><br>Other divergences within the scale would be even smaller: thus the<br>true 17-tet major third (6/17 octave) is about 423.53 cents, as<br>compared to its quasi-17-tet counterpart of about 423.45 cents. This<br>interval thus retains its characteristic flavor and its penchant for<br>expanding to a fifth with a definite neo-Gothic "zonk."<br><br>Incidentally, a scale step in either 17-tet or quasi-17-tet -- that<br>is, the diatonic semitone of about 70.59 cents in either tuning --<br>happens to be almost identical to the 25:24 chromatic semitone of<br>tertian just intonation (about 70.67 cents). Thus it might be<br>appropriate that the just tuning chain for quasi-17-tet should combine<br>a chain of 18 pure fifths (suggesting the "neo-Pythagorean" qualities<br>of the tuning) with a 25:24 ratio.[5]<br><br><br>--------------------------------<br>4. Naming caution and dedication<br>--------------------------------<br><br>Having confirmed once again by my quasi-12-tet adventure that almost<br>any tuning may have a long documented history (in that case going back<br>at least to Kirnberger), I would hesitate to propose _any_ name for<br>this quasi-17-tet tuning or its comma, the latter likely involving<br>some of the larger integers encountered in just intonation theory.<br><br>However, I would not hesitate to dedicate this essay itself to one<br>whose career on this planet has immensely advanced xenharmonics, just<br>intonation, and the recognition of 17-tet as an honored member of the<br>diverse n-tet family: Ivor Darreg.<br><br><br>                             -----------------<br>                                   Notes<br>                             -----------------<br><br><br>1. Hermann L. F. Helmholtz, with translation, notes, and Appendices by<br>Alexander J. Ellis, _On the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological<br>Basis for the Theory of Music_, 6th ed. (New York: Peter Smith, 1948),<br>p. 316, n. at *. Ideally, the Helmholtz tuning would call for making<br>each fifth 1/8-schisma narrow to produce pure major thirds; Ellis,<br>allowing for the limited accuracy of human hearing, instead "dumps"<br>the full schisma on one fifth or fourth out of the chain of 8<br>producing a pure M3.<br><br>2. Ibid. Ellis remarks that such fifths or fourths "are defective,<br>.. being 700 cents down or 500 up, in place of 702 and 498 as all the<br>others." Lest any reader be tempted to take this "defect" too<br>seriously, it might be well to recall the view of Helmholtz, ibid. at<br>p. 315, that "[t]he principal fault of our present tempered intonation<br>[i.e. 12-tet], therefore, does not lie in the Fifths; for their<br>imperfection is really not worth speaking of, and is scarcely<br>perceptible in chords." At issue, of course, was rather the tuning of<br>major and minor thirds.<br><br>3. J. Murray Barbour, _Tuning and Temperament: A Historical Survey_<br>(East Lansing: Michigan State College Press (1953), p. 64.<br><br>4. As Ellis notes in Helmholtz, see n. 1, p. 316 n. at *, the schisma<br>fifth (used in Kirnberger's quasi-12-tet) is larger than a true 12-tet<br>fifth by about 0.001280 cents. Thus the comma (12 fifths/7 octaves)<br>is 12 times this variance, or about 0.01536 cents.<br><br>5. It is interesting that an interval of about 70 cents serves as a<br>_diatonic_ semitone (e.g. e-f, c#-d, eb-d) in 17-tet or quasi-17-tet,<br>but as a _chromatic_ semitone (e.g. c-c#, eb-e) in tertian just<br>intonation, where the diatonic semitone of 16:15 is equal to about<br>111.73 cents. Curiously, the usual 17-tet or quasi-17-tet M3 of about<br>423.5 cents is quite close to the 32:25 diminished fourth (about<br>427.37 cents) of tertian just intonation. Here we see a dramatic case<br>of Mark Lindley's observation associating active thirds with keen<br>diatonic semitones (as holds more moderately in Pythagorean and<br>12-tet), and restful thirds with large diatonic semitones (as holds<br>also in 19-tet and 31-tet, and the kindred 1/3-comma and 1/4-comma<br>meantone tunings).<br><br>Most respectfully,<br><br>Margo Schulter<br>mschulter@value.net</div>
