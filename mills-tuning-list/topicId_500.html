The JI versus ET or nj-net debate is <br>unlikely to be resolved, especially since Roberts and Mathews found that <br>there are two types of listeners, those that prefer JI and those that <br>prefer the richness of intervals tuned sharp or flat in triads. Frankly, <br>given the over-learning of 12-tet that musically trained subjects will <br>have been subjected to and the self-selection that musically naive <br>persons <br>will have undergone for the lack of musical discrimination abilities, I <br>tend to be skeptical of many preference studies. My advice is for <br>composers <br>and performers to use the tuning they find best for their musical <br>purposes. <br>I suspect that their audiences will usually agree.<br><br>  Roberts, Linda A. and Max Mathews.

I would imagine that if you<br>asked subjects to state their "preference" between minor seconds and major<br>thirds, the thirds would be a near unanimous choice. Does this mean that<br>minor seconds should never be used in music?<br><br>Also, I don't think many people since the time of Helmholtz have claimed<br>that small-number ratios are the only criterion of consonance. Certainly I<br>have not. Consonance, in a musical sense as well as a strictly<br>psychoacoustic sense (if there is such a thing) is a very complex<br>phenomenon that depends on the ratio, on its relationship to the critical<br>bandwidth, on the relative timbres, the absolute frequencies, the loudness,<br>and, not least of all, the musical context.<br><br>Finally, as John Chalmers has pointed out, these studies are not without<br>their cultural biases. Though such biases difficult to test, given the<br>current ubiquity of twelve-tone equal temperament through radio and<br>television, I think that one is bound to show a "preference" for the<br>familiar. Some evidence for this comes from the article Brian quoted<br>earlier: Kessler, Hansen, and Shepard, "Tonal Schemata in the Perception of<br>Music in Bali and the West" (Music Perception, Winter 1984 V2/2, 131-165).<br><br>>[1] [Comparison of sqrt(3/2) to 45/32]<br><br>I personally find 45/32 much too high a ratio to be called "consonant," and<br>I don't really hear it as just. To take a fairer comparison, I do find 7/5<br>more consonant than a neutral third.<br><br>>[2] Tune up 11/9 and compare it to 9/8.  Which sounds more<br>>consonant?<br><br>This is true and illustrates my problem with a reliance on LCM analysis.<br>Because 9/8 is small and, depending on the absolute frequency, may lie<br>within the critical bandwidth, I find it relatively dissonant. I don't<br>think that the relative simplicity of the ratios are as much of an issue.<br><br>>[3] Tune up a second inversion 4:5:6 chord--that is, a just major<br>>chord with a 4/3 in the bass, i.e., a 9:12:15 triad. Now compare it<br>>with a 10:12:15 minor chord.<br><br>If one resolves the numbers here you have 4/3 and 5/3 in the first and 6/5<br>and 3/2 in the second. Based only on the ratios, I find 5/3 and 6/5<br>equivalent -- they are inversions of each other. That leaves 4/3 and 3/2.<br>Clearly 3/2 is the more stable because it lies lower in the harmonic<br>series.<br><br>>[4] Tune up the ratio 3:5:7 and then tune up the ratio 18:22:27.<br>>Which one sounds more consonant?<br><br>Here I have to disagree. While they both have distinctive sounds, I find<br>the 3/5 and 5/7 intervals more consonant than the 11/9 interval of the<br>second triad.<br><br>>This also sidesteps the dilemma of the just perfect fourth.<br><br>The dilemma of the perfect fourth is in part a historical artifact of<br>producing counterpoint by counting intervals relative to the lowest sound<br>voice (which for simplicity I'll call the bass). Thus the apparent<br>consonance of the perfect fourth and perfect fifth sounding together if one<br>only looks at them relative to the bass is taken care of by considering the<br>fourth dissonant. As is obvious to anyone looking at all the interval<br>combinations, the dissonance is not so much the fourth as the second<br>between the two upper voices.<br><br>The second reason for considering the fourth relative to the bass a<br>"dissonance" is to explain the need for the second inversion triad to<br>resolve. To me, this need for resolution is not so much because the 9:12:15<br>is "dissonant" as the simplest interval lies higher in the harmonic series<br>than either the octave or the perfect fifth. Therefore the chord sounds<br>less stable than one based on a 3/2. Also, some medieval musicians were not<br>bothered by this relative instability.<br><br>>Too, as Norman Cazden points out:<br>>"Traditional rules of harmony and counterpoint explicitly<br>>proscribe parallel successions of perfect intervals, though<br>>with the unaccountable excpetion of that same troublesome<br>>fourth when it is not in the lowest placement.<br><br>Using the stylistic conventions of one musical culture during one period of<br>history is a weak justification at best. The main reason behind the<br>prohibition of parallel perfect intervals was to maintain the independence<br>of the voices sought by European polyphonic composers of the 15th to 19th<br>centuries.<br><br>Parallel octaves causes the texture to suddenly thin because the octave<br>lies so low in the harmonic series -- which is why we tend to consider men<br>and women singing in parallel octaves virtually the same as monophony. Put<br>another way, the upper voices are doubling a harmonic already present in<br>the lower voices.<br><br>So, do we prohibit all parallel intervals, since they must be found in the<br>same harmonic series of some fundamental somewhere? Of course not. As we<br>move further up the harmonic series the impression of the two voices<br>operating "as a single unit" becomes less and less prominent. So where does<br>one draw the line? Perfect unison? Perfect octave? Perfect fifth? Perfect<br>fourth? Major third? Minor third? Well, composers of the 15th century chose<br>the draw the line between the perfect fifth and the perfect fourth.<br>Incidentally, it is interesting to note that 13th century motet composers<br>quite intentionally avoided parallel thirds, though parallel fifths and<br>fourths are often found.<br><br>I have nothing against composers who prefer the musical usefulness of equal<br>temperament or any other type of temperament. Nazir Jairazhboy, the Indian<br>music master quoted by Brian earlier, points out that he finds that<br>tempered intervals can give extra tension to a melody in need of<br>resolution. As Brian has pointed out as well, the Javanese find perfect 2/1<br>octaves rather lifeless and usually try to compress or expand them.<br><br>However, to say that there is some natural predilection for just,<br>equal-tempered, or any other kind of scale is, I think, to misunderstand<br>the relationship between nature and art. Certainly one would think Brian<br>would understand this, having composed in JI himself, according to John.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.

The weights of the hammers<br>purportedly produced different pitches<br>when the blacksmith smote the anvil.<br>This is of course pure fantasy.  Hammers<br>of different weights striking an anvil<br>give off the same tone at different<br>volumes.  It is the bell, not the clapper,<br>which produces a tone, and the pitch of<br>the tone is not determined by the mass<br>of the clapper but by the mass and<br>shape of the bell. (Bells have recently<br>been designed by computer to sound a<br>major chord rather than a minor chord.)<br>In any case, simply doubling the weight<br>which hangs at the end of a string would<br>produce a pitch in the ratio of 1.414 to the<br>original note (Pythagoras was supposed to<br>have rushed home and performed this<br>experiment; obviously he did not, nor<br>did Boethius. Galileo's father did, and<br>published the results.).  Doubling anvil weights<br>produces an interval not of an octave but<br>a tritone. As it happens, vibrating metal<br>bars behave differently from strings, and<br>so the tale about Pythagoras is a myth.<br>However, this tall tale shows pretty clearly<br>the level of technology available in classical<br>Greece.  Pythagoras didn't rush home and<br>try out his theory on a keyboard instrument<br>or a  zither with 88 different strings at<br>high tension because the Greeks didn't have<br>the technology to build such instruments.<br>For one thing, you have to know a good deal<br>about metallurgy to produce tough wires as<br>would be needed in a harpsichord or zither or <br>piano; for another, the Greeks didn't have<br>the technology to machine metal as is<br>required to produce metal screws, iron<br>frameworks for pianos, etc.<br>What sort of intonation system is most<br>appropriate for a technology limited to<br>lyres with only a few gut strings and<br>some wind instruments?<br>Because gut changes its tension with<br>humidity and because it must be kept at<br>low tension lest the gut strings break,<br>the intonation best suited for such <br>technology would use only the simplest<br>and most obvious members of the harmonic<br>series.  Plucked gut strings produce harmonic<br>series timbres, so the second and third<br>members of the harmonic series would be<br>most useful in tuning such instruments. <br>Because of the extremely low tension of<br>a tortoise-shell lyre (try and add a lot of<br>strings or tune them to high tension and <br>either the back of the lyre will collapse<br>or the gut strings will snap), the sounds<br>will be faint and only the very lowest<br>harmonics will be audible.  The 5th <br>harmonic and higher harmonics would<br>probably have been extremely faint on<br>a plucked gut string, too faint to tune<br>to.<br>Thus the technology of classical Greek<br>music lent itself primarily to Pythagorean<br>tuning.<br>The tuning of auloi is not so limited; however,<br>it remains unclear what the Greek auloi were.<br>Some authors claim they were similar to<br>oboes, in which case they would demand<br>a tremendous amount of air.  Other authors<br>claims the Greek auloi were more flute-like,<br>in which case the sound would have been much<br>louder and the players less sorely taxed.<br>However, even today it's impossible to calculate<br>precisely the position of tone holes for simple<br>wood instruments theoretically; the theory<br>never matches the actual position.  In classical<br>times, the position of tone holes would have<br>been a matter of guesstimation, and this<br>would have necessarily limited the intonational<br>complexity of Greek auloi.<br>Net result? <br>Pythagorean tuning was a technological<br>necessity for the Greeks, as it was for<br>the bablyonians and the Sumerians.  These<br>latter recorded a Pythagorean tuning on<br>tablet U7/80 (Side 2) in the British Museum; it<br>is almost certain that the tall tales about<br>Pythagoras mask an intonational tradition<br>which drifted from the older civilizations<br>of Egypt and the Euphrates valley to the<br>newer civilizations of the Mediterranean.<br>--  <br>Inventions were common in the classical<br>era of ancient Greece: Ktesibos of Alexandria<br>build a device to produce "intermittant bird<br>song" around 270 B.C. It worked by regulating<br>the flow of water into a closed chamber.<br>But such devices were very limited in their<br>musical utility because the air pressure was<br>low and so the "bird songs" would have<br>been extremely faint--and when the chamber<br>designed to catch the streamof water filled <br>up, the sound would have stopped.<br>Ktesibos solved this problem by using a<br>double-barreled water pump he had devised<br>to fight fires--he modified this pump<br>to create a continuous source of compressed<br>air.  The roman author Hero reports around<br>the first century B.C. that Ktesibos used<br>three components to  build his hydraulis<br>(water organ): a single-cylinder air pump,<br>a large cistern filled with water, and a smaller<br>vessel attached to the bottom of the cistern<br>to act as a regulator to keep constant the rate of<br>flow of water out of the cistern.<br>This organ used sliders moving in and out<br>of slots below each pipe; the sliders<br>were controlled by the keys of the keyboard<br>and when a player pressed a key, the hole<br>in the slider aligned with the opening in<br>the corresponding pipe.  By spring action, the<br>keys recoiled, dragging each slider back to<br>its closed position.<br>Notice several problems with this organ.<br>First, it must have required at least as<br>much force to depress a key as would<br>be required to drag each slider back into<br>its closed position.  Second, the organ<br>can play only as long as the cistern <br>contains water.  Third, the size of the<br>cistern and its height determine <br>the maximum available air pressure and thus<br>the total number of pipes and the maximum<br>volume of the sound.  But the biggest<br>problem is that as more and more keys<br>were depressed, the air pressure would<br>drop because the regulator at the bottom<br>of the cistern would prohibit water from<br>flowing at more than a certain maximum<br>rate from the reservoir.  This means that<br>if more than one key was depressed, the<br>overall air pressure of the organ would<br>drop and the overall pitch of all notes<br>would fall.  It would not have been<br>possible to remedy this by eliminating<br>the regulator, since its purpose is to<br>maintain even air pressure--otherwise<br>there would initially be high air pressure<br>as a great mass of water started to <br>press down on the pump at the start<br>and the air pressure would continually<br>fall as the mass of water in the <br>cistern continually lessened.<br>Thus Ktesibos' organ would not have<br>been useful for performing with other<br>instruments, since its pitch changed<br>as more keys were depressed. Also,<br>it could only play for a short time,<br>and the creaking of the wooden pump<br>and the burble of water pouring out<br>of the cistern would have made the<br>instrument hard to hear.<br>As a result, the hydraulis was only<br>a novelty item.  Even so it impressed<br>contemporaries: Athenaeus describes<br>a feast at which the hydraulis was<br>discussed: "The sound of the hydraulis<br>was heard close by.  So pleasant and <br>charming was it that we all turned <br>towards the sound, fascinating by the<br>harmony."<br>The reaction here hints at the surprise<br>and shock Alexandrian citizens must<br>have felt at hearing sustained chords.<br>This was clearly alien to their experience.<br>It is reasonable to assume that the <br>hydraulis used Pythagorean intonation;<br>remember that the pitch changes as<br>more keys are depressed.  This would make<br>an elaborate tuning system very hard<br>to tune up. Even Pythagorean was probably<br>only roughly approximated on such organs.<br>The Romans used such instruments at<br>the arena; the oldest archaeological remains<br>of an organ were unearthed at Aquincum<br>(near currest-day Budapest), dedicated<br>in A.D. 228 to the college of weavers there.<br>Having listened to the hydraulis, the <br>Pythagorean Philolaus proclaimed: "The<br>nature of number and harmony admits<br>no falsehood... But in fact number, fitting<br>all things into the soul through<br>sense-perception makes them recognizable<br>and comparable with one another."<br>This is a fine statement of the <br>Pythagorean conception of the universe as<br>an expression of pure theoretical math.<br>Music was unpopular with the early <br>leaders of Christianity. Divine revelation<br>was preferred to the study of nature.<br>Early Christian thinkers did not have<br>much interest in the application of<br>logic and the study of physical evidence<br>(an attitude represented on this forum<br>by Greg Taylor); instead, they preferred <br>the mystic contemplation of sacred verse, <br>from which music proved an unwanted <br>distraction.<br>Saint Augustine wrote in the early 5th<br>century that he found music in any form<br>suspect, but allowed as how "now when <br>I hear sung in a sweet and well-trained<br>voice those mleodies...I do, I confess,<br>feel a pleasurable relaxation. But this<br>bodily pleasure to which the mind should<br>not succumb without enervation, often<br>deceives me.... In these matters I sin<br>without realizing it." <br>The message is clear: to the early<br>Christians, beautiful music was a sin.<br>(This is an attitude remarkably similar<br>to that of many academic music theorists<br>of the modern day.)<br>--<br>The first organ to reach Western Europe<br>after the sack of Rome in 476 was a<br>gift from the Byzantine emperor <br>Constantine V to the Frankish king<br>Pepin in the year 757. The gift<br>excited amazement because its like<br>had not been seen for hundreds of <br>years--a clear indication of how<br>much knowledge and scientific<br>thought could be lost forgotten and<br>how badly the capacity for clear<br>thinking could erode during the<br>Dark Ages (a fate which awaits us<br>all if we follow the prescriptions<br>of the Eric Lyons and the Greg Taylors<br>of the world).<br>Ermold le Noir wrote an epic in which<br>he proclaimed "Even the organ, never<br>yet seen in France, which was the <br>overweening pride of Greece and which<br>in Constantinople was the sole reason<br>for them to feel superior to us--even <br>that is now in the palace of Aix."<br>The organ was slowly transformed<br>into an engine of divine worship in<br>the churches--this took a while, given<br>the attitude of Augustine: "Whatever<br>knowledge man has acquired outside<br>of Holy Writ, if it be harmful it is there<br>condemned; if it be wholesome, it is<br>there contained." (An attitude remarkably<br>similar to that of contemporary music<br>professors, save that their Holy Writ is<br>Schoenberg's "Harmonielehre" and John<br>Cage's "Silence.")<br>Organs were increasingly optimized for<br>volume. By the 990s this led to what<br>Wulstan described as "Like Thunder,<br>the strident voice assails the ear,<br>shutting out all other sounds than its<br>own; such are its reverberations,<br>echoing here and there, that each man<br>lifts his hands to stop his ears, unable<br>as he drawn hear to tolerate the roaring<br>of so many different and noisy combinations."<br>Clearly volume came at the price of<br>intonational precision--the "noisy <br>combinations" surely describe the<br>effect of an unsteady air-flow on<br>the pitches of the individual pipes.<br>This organ (like most around the 900s)<br> did not seem to have been<br>used for music so much as to amaze<br>and shock the crowd and entice them<br>into attending church services.<br>By the 12th century, organs had been<br>accepted into the church in a feat of<br>intellectual jiu-jitsu similar to<br>Thomas Aquinas' introduction of<br>Aristotle.  By this time the organs<br>clearly had worked up high air<br>pressure, though the steadiness<br>of their intonation was probably<br>still poor: Saint Aelred, abbot at<br>Rievaulx in Yorkshire, wrote<br>"What use, pray is this terrifying<br>blast from the bellows that is <br>better suited to imitate the noise<br>of thunder than the sweetness of the<br>human voice..."  <br>This quote indicates that the organs<br>were now using bellows--in fact<br>banks of them, one for each pipe,<br>with serfs treading on them in time<br>to the music.  This would have greatly<br>increased air pressure, but it required<br>the serfs to tread in lockstep and more<br>to the point the air pressure would still<br>change over the course of a note as the<br>bellows emptied.  The initial higher<br>air pressure would, ironically, have<br>produced a more drastic drop in the<br>pitch of each note while it sounded.<br>Moreover, the notes could not sound<br>for a very long time--only as long<br>as it took the bellows feeding air to<br>that pipe to empty.<br>The overall effect would have been<br>of a set of notes which dropped in<br>pitch as they were sounded and<br>which would have had to be played<br>in strict robotic meter; however,<br>the problem of polyphony changing<br>the overall pitch of the organ had<br>been solved, and the organs of the<br>12th century would have sounded much<br>louder than that of Ktesibos.<br>Moreover, these 12th-century organs<br>still didn't have keyboards.  They<br>were played by ramming blocks of<br>wood forward and back to open up<br>and cut off the flow of air into each<br>pipe.  Given the size of the pipes,<br>this would have been a real workout.<br>Some time between the 11th century<br>and the 14th century, true keyboards<br>appeared.  These were spring-loaded,<br>like Ktesibos' keys.  They still had<br>to be bashed with the fist--but they<br>could now be played more musically.<br>Given the persistent problems<br>with changing pitch and lack of any<br>kind of real keyboard,  Pythagorean<br>intonation was still used into the <br>12th century according to the organ-<br>building manuals of that period--even <br>though modern keyboards had started<br>to evolve.<br>However, by the 14th century small<br>portable foot-pumped organs were<br>starting to appear. Henri Arnaut <br>published the best suriviving text<br>on building medieval organs in<br>1450; around this time the single<br>greatest innovation in musical<br>technology between 100 B.C. and<br>1800 A.D. was introduced--the<br>multiple-chamber bellows.<br>Water-operated organs were clumsy<br>because they demanded a source of<br>water and they could only play for<br>a limited time; bellows were better<br>because they could be pumped relatively<br>silently (I've played some of these<br>portatives and you can't hear the<br>bellows).  <br>Adding a second chamber onto the bellows<br>produced constant air pressure.  The <br>second inner chamber of the bellows had<br>an aperature into which air could be forced<br>but could exit except through the organ pipes.<br>Thus, even though the pressure of the primary<br>bellows constantly changed as it was pumped,<br>the secondary chamber maintained a relatively<br>constant air flow.<br>Around this time Napier also introduced the<br>logarithm, making possible calculations which<br>treated musical intervals as portions of the<br>octave which could be added and subtracted <br>rather than as messy complex grade-school<br>fractions which had to be multiplied and<br>divided. <br>These two advances had an explosive impact<br>on intonation.<br>Within a few generations of the late 1400s,<br>the Pythagorean intonation was no longer<br>in widespread use (though it was still taught<br>in music theory--much as 12-TET is still<br>universally taught today even thought modern<br>composers are using it less and less).  Organs<br>with large numbers of pipes became common.<br>Moreover, serfs no longer needed to tread in<br>strict time on sets of bellows.  By adding<br>a secondary chamber, all the pipes could be<br>connected to a single bellows and as long<br>as it was large enough, the air pressure<br>would be sufficient that no matter how<br>many keys were depressed (within some<br>reasonable limit) the overall air pressure<br>inside the inner chamber (after the<br>secondary bellows) wouldn't change.<br>This not only allowed composers<br>and performers to explore much wilder<br>and less regular rhythms, it also allowed<br>more elaborate intonational schemes<br>than 3-limit just, and it made possible<br>the exploration of complex polyphony<br>with many notes of stable pitch <br>sounding all at once.<br>With more notes available on the organ<br>keyboard, the possibility of modulation<br>is correspondingly greater.  Between<br>the early 1500s and the middle 1700s<br>this increasing use of modulation by<br>composers would have made various<br>meantone systems particularly popular.<br>Indeed, Mark LIndley claims that the<br>early English virginal piece "Ut, Re,<br>Mi, Fa, Sol, La" by John Bull (written<br>in the late 1500s) used 1/3-comma<br>meantone.  Bull was a wild-eyed<br>avant garde composer, the Stockhausen<br>of his time, and this sounds reasonable<br>given Bull's penchant for pushing the<br>outside of the musical envelope.<br>The next post concludes this examination<br>of technology's effect on tuning.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 14 Nov 1996 18:24 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08898; Thu, 14 Nov 1996 18:25:54 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08919<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA08110; Thu, 14 Nov 1996 09:25:47 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 14 Nov 1996 09:25:47 -0800<br>Message-Id: <83961114165538/0005695065PK3EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4025 href="#4025">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/1996 8:28:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: technology and intonation<br>--<br>A tenth century text on organ building laid<br>out the rules for pipe length exactly as<br>Pythagoras would have in the Greek era.<br>Start with a pipe and call it C. Divide it<br>into 4 parts, remove one and you have the<br>pipe for the low F. Divide the C pipe into<br>3, throw away one part, and the resulting<br>pipe sounds a G above C. Divide the G<br>pipe into three, add one part to it, and <br>the result is D below G.  The instructions<br>continue in the same way, producing<br>a completely standard Pythagorean scale<br>that effectively translates the tuning<br>of a monochord into fixed ratios of<br>pipe length.<br>This is a typical reaction to new <br>technology.  As Marshall McLuhan<br>pointed out, new forms of technology<br>typically start by taking on the modes<br>and habits of older forms of tehcnology.<br>Only gradually does the new technology<br>start to develop unique and novel<br>modes of use.<br>For example, early printing presses<br>used type designed to fool its readers<br>into thinking the letters had been<br>written by hand.  Each letter was <br>carefully designed to imitate the <br>shape of a letter written in ink with<br>a square-nibbed pen; printers of the 1490s<br>even used multiple typesets with<br>different inks to produce the effect<br>of illumination by scribes with red<br>ink for special words, etc.<br>Early television programs imitated<br>plays; early Internet applications<br>imitate magazines--for example,<br>this tuning forum.  The world wide<br>web is not limited to ASCII text,<br>as is this tuning forum, and soon<br>sounds will be sent attached to<br>graphics and text as a matter of<br>course (this still takes too much<br>bandwidth today--a 44.1 khz stereo<br>soundfiles demands 10.5 megs of<br>data per minute). <br>In the 1450s Duke Philip's organ<br>designer Henri Arnaut came up with<br>the idea of modifying the Pythagorean<br>system to keep as many fifths pure as<br>possible while still making as many<br>keys as possible listenable (i.e., triads<br>without excessive beats).  This was<br>in retrospect a failed attempt to<br>use the new technology of the modern<br>organ for polyphonic music; meantone<br>tuning did the opposite of Arnaut's<br>procedure, keeping thirds just while <br>shaving bits off each fifth.<br>Meantone proved so successful that,<br>according to Alexander J. Ellis and<br>others, it remained the dominant form<br>of tuning through the 1840s.<br>In between the 1500s and the 1840s,<br>many different peculiar variants of<br>meantone were tried.  <br>Example: an organ at Bucksburg, build around<br>1615, boasts 14 keys per octave.  Handel's<br>harpsichord also uses 14 keys to the <br>octave.  I have pictures in my files of many<br>peculiar-looking keyboards which have as<br>many as three tiers of keys--one set of<br>ordinary white keys, a second set of <br>black keys with some extra smaller keys<br>*in between* B and C, and a third tier of<br>keys, also blac keys, which reproduce the<br>conventional black keys but translated<br>by a comma up.  Mersenne's Harmonie <br>Universelle is full of such illustrations,<br>but many such keyboards were actually<br>built.  Between 1500 and 1800 there was<br>no such thing as "a standard keyboard<br>instrument keyboard"--there were a lot<br>of different types of keyboards, since <br>all musical instruments throughout that<br>period were hand-made.<br>Such extended meantone keyboards flourished<br>during the 17th and 18th century, a period<br>when standardization was not the norm,<br>and when musical tuning--like spelling!--<br>was considered a matter of individual<br>taste within the overall limits of the<br>meantone system. (It's important to <br>remember that because meantone is<br>a general method in which fifths are<br>altered to preserve just thirds, there<br>are *many* different flavors of meantone.<br>1/3 comma, 1/4-comma, 1/6 comma,<br>1/11 comma--known as 12-TET--and<br>variants such as the irregular circulating<br>temperaments of Marpurg and Werckmeister<br>and Kirnberger.)<br>The next great technological leap was made<br>by Henry Maudslay, who worked at the<br>smithy in Woolwich Royal Arsenal in the<br>early late 1700s.<br>Joseph Brahma, an entrepeneur who wanted<br>to build an unpickable lock to cash in on<br>a highly-publicized series of robberies in<br>London, hired Maudslay as an apprentice<br>locksmith. By 1797, Maudslay asked for<br>a raise of thirty shillings a week (to<br>support his wife and children) and Brahma<br>refused, so Maudslay walked out and<br>started his own workshop on Oxford street<br>in London.<br>Maudslay's first product was a new lathe<br>he had designed. <br>A lathe is basically a machine which<br>uses a screw as a moving base for a knife;<br>the knife can cut wood, or if made of<br>tempered steel, iron or copper.<br>The 1800 Maudslay lathe was far larger<br>than any of its predecessors (which were<br>mainly used for ornamental work on small<br>gewgaws) and his sliding tool-rest<br>was perfectly mounted on accurately<br>planed triangular bars.  Because Maudslay<br>was a fanatic for accuracy, he built his<br>lathes to extraordinarily fine tolerances<br>for the era; but the big suprise was not<br>that Maudslay's lathe could turn out more <br>accurate work faster than any other lathe.<br>The real shock came when people realized<br>that they could use Maudslay lathes to<br>machine extremely accurate and regular<br>screws and bars for use in *other*<br>lathes, which in turn could produce<br>*other* machine tools...  Starting with<br>extremely accurate screws, it is <br>possible to build a huge variety of<br>precision machine tools.  These tools<br>in turn make possible the creation<br>of even more precise machine tools.<br>The process builds on itself in much<br>the same way as the development of<br>ever-more-powerful silicon chips has<br>led to silicon compilers which in turn<br>allow the construction of even more<br>powerful computer chips by automated<br>methods.<br>The end result of Maudslay's lathe was<br>that woodworking, metalworking,<br>manufacture, toolmaking, and factories<br>were all revolutionized.  Maudslay's<br>lathe changed the nature of warfare<br>and it made Britain the greatest sea<br>power in the world.  It also made possible<br>the modern orchestra and the modern<br>piano.<br>How so?<br>Napoleonic warfare depended on the fact<br>that rifles were inaccurate.  They were<br>inaccurate because there was no way<br>to rifle barrels with precise accuracy or<br>to turn out standardized gun parts with <br>high precision at high speed.  This meant<br>that if you shot at an enemy more than<br>a few score yards away, your shot probably<br>wouldn't hit.  So Napoleonic warfare depended<br>on masses of infantry marching in lockstep<br>toward one another until they got close enough<br>to mow each other down.<br>Britain became a great sea power when it built<br>and equipped enough ships to rule the seas; but<br>this wasn't possible without turning out more<br>than 1400 block-and-tackle units to haul sails<br>up and down *on each and every ship* (and that's<br>only on 3rd-class ships.  First-line ships used <br>> 2000 blocks!).  These blocks and winches and<br>pulleys were made of wood by hand.  There <br>weren't enough carpenters in Britain (or in<br>Europe) for all the blocks the British navy<br>needed, and you couldn't run a ship without<br>'em.<br>Marc Isambard Brunel came to Maudslay<br>in 1800 with an idea to turn out these blocks<br>for the Royal Navy using his new lathe; by 1808,<br>the first large-scale mass production <br>facility in the world, Maudslay's factory,<br>was turning them out by the truckload.<br>To string a piano you need huge amounts of<br>wire, and--even more important--you need<br>precision machines to build the die through<br>to draw the wire, and more precision machines<br>to loop the wire at the ends, and even *more*<br>precision machines to wind the lower strings.<br>Maudslay's lathes made it possible to build<br>such precision machinery, and as a result the piano<br>rapidly evolved from a relatively thin-voiced<br>instrument strung at low tension in the 1830s<br>to a robust instrument with three wires per<br>note at high tension and wound strings on the<br>lower octaves by the 1880s--all due to<br>the tidal wave of change produced in<br>manufacturing by Madslay's lathe.<br>Woodwind instrument had always been <br>nortoriously dicey in their intonation, in large<br>part due to the problems of precisely boring<br>amd machining wood (essentially the same <br>problem as rifling a musket barrel). By the 1880s<br>woodwinds had reached high standards of<br>precision (though they still depended crucially<br>on those temperamental reeds).  Moreover,<br>woodwinds plummeted in price along with brass<br>instruments as precision machine tools <br>proliferated. <br>The valves of brass instrument benefited<br>most of all from Maudslay's lathe because <br>of the precision tools built to bend and seal<br>them.<br>Eventually, wire strings became so common<br>that they replaced gut strings in the string<br>instruments, leading to the godawful <br>screeching-train sound of modern string<br>instruments and a corresponding increase<br>in sheer volume (and a precipitous drop<br>in listenability--the average violin solo<br>noawdays sounds like a cat being castrated).<br>--<br>The upshot of these precision machine tools<br>was the 12 tone equal tempered scale. Musical<br>instruments built by mass production could not<br>be economically individualized so as to accomodate<br>dozens of different meantone variants.  To make<br>money turning out modern musical instruments,<br>you must *standardize*--all exactly alike. When you<br>build only one or two harpischords per year, you<br>can easliy afford to use exotic three-tier keyboards<br>fitted to special custom meantone tuning schemes...<br>but when you build 100 pianos a year you must <br>settle on a single rigid standard keyboard. As<br>soon as musical instruments became mass-market<br>commodities, their tuning also had to be standardized<br>to make a profit for the manufacturer.<br>The result--as Ivor Darreg pointed out for many<br>years--was that 12-TET was foisted on the<br>musical world by musical instrument manufacturers,<br>rather than by musical theorists, performers,<br>or composers.  As Lou Harrison has pointed out, the<br>advantages of 12-tet are "almost entirely economic."<br>In fact Ellis reports that meantone "sounds by far <br>the sweetest" of all the intonations he tried; <br>clearly *technology* forced 12 equal tones on<br>musicians, and they went along *reluctantly.*<br>With the advent of the digitial synthesizer the<br>iron fist of 12 made itself manifest in the velvet<br>glove of digital technology.  As Ivor pointed out,<br>once people started to hear pure unadulterated<br>exactly precise 12, they fled from it in droves.<br>Pianos and string instruments strayed gracefully from<br>12, especially in the upper and lower registers--<br>the octaves on a piano are systematically stretched,<br>and vioinists tend to bend pitches whenever <br>they possibly can.  <br>But with the earliest digital synthesizers, there<br>was no choice--the intonation was burned into<br>the ROMs and listeners and composers and<br>performers were stuck with pure perfect 12.<br>And the beats drove them crazy, so they slathered<br>on hockey-rink reverb, they used phase shifting<br>and multitrack tape and echo...

So the many ludicrous<br>errorsin the following muttonheaded "translation"<br>are strictly *MY* fault, not the author's.<br>--<br>The first article is "The dynamism of scales<br>and consonances in the principal acoustical<br>systems and its influence on the development<br>of music" by Jacques Chailley.  This is the same<br>Chailley who wrote the excellent "40,000 Years<br>of Music" in 1964, one of the best books on<br>music history, period.<br>"Of the various acoustic systems which involve<br>physical considerations in some way, three<br>stand out in western musical practice. Up to<br>the 16th century, musical practice was primarily<br>Pythagorean; from the 16th to the 18th century,<br>it was based on Zarlino's work; and from that<br>era to the present, on 12-tone equal temperament.<br>"I. The origins of the Pythagorean intonation are<br>empirical. (This is 100% backwards from the <br>reality; Aristoxenos, the chief intonational<br>empiricist of ancient times, vehemently disagreed<br>with the Pythagoreans and make considerable light<br>of their reliance on the sacred tetraktys as the<br>source of all music -- but then, no doubt my<br>"translation" is hog-wild --mclaren) Clearly there's<br>no truth to the tale of Pythagoras hearing blacksmith's<br>hammers (John Chalmers has pointed this out, also<br>why. For one thing, the anvil would ring and not the<br>hammers just as the clapper does not ring rather<br>than the bell.  For another thing, vibrating masses<br>follow a different law of musical ratios than <br>vibrating strings-- mclaren).  Instead he established <br>the relationship between the size of the interval and<br>the length of string.  Pythagoras deduced that the<br>octave, the fifth and the fourth were the basis of<br>all existing music. (Actually the Pythagoreans<br>worshipped a numerological pyramid made of<br>the number 1, 2, 3, and 4, called the tetraktys.<br>M. Chailley's statement is not quite accurate,<br>but close.  Either he has confused the <br>ecstatic 3-worship of Holy Trinity-influenced<br>Medieval music theorists like Jean de Muris with<br>Pythaogras' writings, or my ludicrous "translation"<br>is to blame -- mclaren)  Pythagoras had no <br>contact with other cultures which did not use such<br>intervals--such as the American Indians.<br>"Concerning the list of resonances, Pythagoreans<br>started their investigation at the second and<br>stopped at the fourth harmonic.  They ignored,<br>evidently, the harmonic principle discovered<br>during the 17th century, namely that of the<br>relationship between consecutive harmonics which<br>transformed simultaneous consonances into<br>a posteriori operation. (Hard to see what he's<br>getting at here. Probably my nonexistent French<br>is bamboozling me. --mclaren)  Superparticularity<br>was considered the most important relationship,<br>not the proximity of the sounds in a list of<br>harmonics--which was ignored when the first<br>frequencies were calculated. (I've probably got<br>it scrambled.  The gist seems to be that absolute<br>frequencies are not important but rather their<br>relationships--which is to say, ratios, and<br>that superparticular ratios are considered the<br>most important. --mclaren) And so the 9/8<br>interval is not defined as the ratio twixt<br>harmonics 8 and 9, but the difference betwene<br>the 3/2 fifth and the 4/3 fourth.  There was<br>no consideration of the 5/4 "natural" third,<br>although it was superparticular, because<br>the Pythagoreans stopped their investigations<br>at harmonic 4.<br>"In arresting his observations at the number 4,<br>Pythagoras conformed to the most primitve<br>classification of consonance: category1 (unison,<br>ocrtave) represents perfect consonance,<br>while category 2 (fifth, fourth) consists of<br>imperfect consonances.  In the melodic<br>art of music, this results in a scale whose<br>structure in the sound-universe of Pythagorean<br>theory is based exclusively on the cycle of <br>fifths:<br>(Here M. Chailley gives an unfortunately <br>misleading 5-line staff with 7 musical <br>pitches notated as the conventional 12-TET<br>notes.  The naive reader might be deceived<br>by this diagram into imagining that the final<br>B in M. Chailley's diagram--starting pitch<br>F, ending pitch after 6 just 3/2s B-- <br>corresponds to the familiar B on the piano <br>keyboard, ratio 2^[6/12] = 1.41414... or <br>600 cents. In fact, in the Pythagorean <br>tuning this pitch pitch is not the familiar B <br>above F but a pitch above F = (3/2)^6 = <br>11.390625 = 11.390625/8 = 611.73 cents.<br>The difference between this "B" and the<br>B on the piano keyboard is clearly audible.<br>12 cents is not a subtle or indetectable<br>interval.  The point here is that Mssr. <br>Chailley's diagram entirely leaves out the<br>fact that in a Pythagorean tuning the<br>pitches rise by 1.995 cents for each note<br>prdouced by a leap of a just perfect fifth<br>as compared to 12-tet. After 6 notes this<br>adds up to 6*1.995 cents = about 12 cents,<br>a non-trivial difference. --mclaren)<br>"The system is fundamentally a succession<br>of fifths producing 1, 2 and eventually all 7<br>of the notes of the diatonic scale. <br>"The cycle stops at 7 notes. Chromaticism<br>becomes a question of physics in the <br>continuation of the cycle of just perfect<br>fifths, rather than a matter of convention<br>and musical language.<br>"And so Pythagorean intonation is perfectly<br>suited to melody, and C-E-G-C' are perfectly<br>in tune. In the middle ages western <br>music was melodic and Pythagorean  tuning<br>was popular, but did not last beyond the<br>16th century.  The intonation was <br>prediminantly minor, since in hexatonic<br>Pythgorean tuning, the minor Pythagorean<br>third is much more a point of acoustic rest<br>than the Pythagorean major third, and<br>the pentatonic mode was primarily used.<br>(The Pythagorean major third so-called<br>is usually calculated as (3/2)^4, = 81/64<br>=  1.2625625 = 407.82 cents, while<br>the Pythagorean minor third is usually<br>calculated as the difference twixt the<br>9/8 and the 4/3 or 8/9*4/3 = 32/27 =<br>1.185185 = 294.1349 cents. -- mclaren)<br>"As far as polyphony goes, the Pythagorean<br>system was not favorable to the development <br>of triadic harmony based on its<br>fundamental intervals, since perfect<br>consonance was restricted to only two<br>of these. It was favorable to the<br>development of counterpoint in independent<br>lines, where the requirement for perfect<br>consonance was not great: aside<br>from the unison and octave, and the<br>two imperfect consonanances, it was<br>a matter of indifference in which of the<br>two classes (fifth or fourth) the intervals<br>fell.  Practically speaking, this made for<br>primitive polypohony, and throughout the<br>Middle Ages polyphony was restricted<br>to such counterpoint, in which all parts<br>were composed so as to proceed together,<br>rather than various lines in contrary motion.<br>(Mssr. Chailley is alluding to fauxbourdon<br>here, along with plainchant.  In fauxbordon<br>an upper voice duplicates the lower at the<br>interval of a just fourth, which in plainchant<br>duplication at the octave was allowed -- mclaren)<br>In conclusion, the Pythagorean system had<br>the characteristic, that the semitones<br>were enlarged compared to the other <br>intervals and were not considered proper<br>consonances.  The resulting tendency was<br>for very strongly consonant intervals to<br>sound on the fifth, the minor third<br>and the unison, the major sixth above <br>the octave, the minor sixth above the<br>fifth or the fourth.<br>"Plagal cadences were typical. As a result,<br>Pythagorean intonation was a dynamic system,<br>whose accentuation of the differences between<br>intervals emphasized dissonance more than<br>consonance.<br>"As a result, certain pitches were often made<br>more attractive by modification to their<br>consonance in performance (musica falsa),<br>and this was the primary function of <br>chromaticism.  Marchetto of Padua (in <br>the 16th century) used the 5/4 as a chromatic<br>alteration in this manner instead of the 81/64.<br>"This could be considered an early Medieval<br>use of temperament.  The Pythagorean major<br>third is a true dissonance, whose tendency <br>toward resolution is very strong.  Thus<br>Pythagorean chromaticism represents the<br>triumph of the large interval as one of<br>maximum attraction. (Presumably Mssr.<br>Chailley means here that the 407.8-cent<br>P maj 3rd tended to resolve to the just<br>3/2 701.955 cent fifth. -- mclaren)<br>"Pythagorean triadic harmony was not<br>consonant; the P maj 3rd was constantly<br>drawn along a line of strong attraction to<br>the fifth. The music of the Middle Ages<br>was characterized by primitive polyphony<br>and strong dynamism.<br>"II. Zarlino held a contrary view.  He adopted<br>the major third as a basic consnance, using<br>harmonic 5 to make three fundamental<br>consonances instead of 2.  (That is, 5/4<br>along with 2/1 and 3/2 -- mclaren)<br>"The result was that consonance was extended<br>to triads, and a major third over the fundamental<br>satisfied the requirements of proper sonority<br>in accordance with the model of resonance. <br>(Presumably this refers obliquely to the fact<br>that all the members of a just 4:5:6 chord are <br>harmonics of an unheard fundamental. Or it<br>might simply refer to the fact that when<br>just intonation is used, there in a noticeable<br>increase in the resonance of chords played on<br>instruments with strictly integer harmonics.<br>-- mclaren) Harmony in the 16th century<br>accreted bit by bit from counterpoint and <br>progressively deviated from a strict adherence<br>to consonance.  The harmonic progressions<br>did not solely rest on consonances, but did<br>exhibit a constant relationship to a bass line.<br>"Zarlino's system was therefore static.<br>The chromaticism of Zarlino's system <br>accentuated the character of individual<br>keys.  The chromatic tetrachord of the Greeks<br>was identified through an error of orthogoraphy<br>with a description by Boethius, instead of<br>the intervals of Zarlino's system. (Eh? This<br>is probably me scrambling the translation...<br>--mclaren)<br>"The chromaticism of Zarlino represents the <br>triumph of the small interval. (Presumably<br>this refers to the fact that Zarlino's theory<br>brought thirds into music as consonances and<br>respectable members of chords -- mclaren)<br>"Concerning melodic construction, the advent<br>of Zarlino's system required the modification<br>of the concept of intonational structure.  The<br>hierarchy of the cycle of fifths must needs be<br>finite if modulation is to be effected.  Thus,<br>based on classical ideas, Zarlino's method<br>effected a radical transformation.<br>"Zarlino divided consonances into three<br>categories.  Harmonic 7 did not fit into<br>any of these; in fact, the just seventh<br>was incompatible with the rest of 16th century<br>theory and practice. As the seventh became<br>more and more used in music through the 18th<br>century, it posed grave problems as to its<br>correct resolution: Rameau's theory dealt<br>with this question (among others).<br>"III.  It is impossible to construct a practical<br>system of just intonation using only the first<br>4 integers. (The organ builders of the 10th through<br>15th centuries would have been greatly surprised<br>to hear this.  In fact a tenth-century text<br>lays out the rules in exact Pythagorean fashion:<br>start with a pipe of whatever length and call<br>it C, divide ito four parts and remove one--<br>that's low F.  Divide the C pipe into three, <br>toss out one part, and you have the fifth above<br>C or G. And so on. Duke Philip's organ designer<br>Henri Arnaut, around 1450, used a slightly<br>modified Pythagorean system which concentrated<br>the dissonance into the interval twixt B and F-sharp.<br>Under Arnaut's system, only 4 thirds out of the 12<br>were consonant and the bad fifth is amazingly<br>awful--a true wolf.  Nonetheless, Arnaut's system<br>represented a workable compromise for the period.<br>To call a system of tuning employed on organs from<br>the 10th through the 15th centuries "impractical"<br>tells me  Mssr. Chailley didn't do his homework<br>here -- mclaren)<br>"Logically, it is suitable to divide  consonances<br>into four categories, the fourth accomodating<br>the 7th harmonic.  This is not in accord with<br>Zarlino's 3 categories of  consonances.<br>"That, incidentally, is why the 7th harmonic was<br>never accepted as a consonance in western <br>music. (Mssr. Chailley may be barking up the wrong<br>tree here--the 7th was never accepted as a<br>consonance because the interval between <br>harmonic 7 and harmonic 6 is the first interval<br>in successive members of the harmonic series<br>which falls within the critical band.  The reason<br>is psychoacoustic, not historical. However, my<br>alleged and preposterous "translation" might<br>well be the culprit instead of M. Chailley -- mclaren)<br>"The sounding of the chord C-E-G-B creates a<br>dissonance which fails to resolve. The musican,<br>in assimilating harmonic 7, creates attractive<br>new intervals but cannot resolve these chords<br>within the conventional western system. The<br>7th harmonic does not correspond to any<br>degree in the western scale; moreover, the<br>resolution of seventh chords has contributed<br>to the tyranny of the dominant chord.  (vii<br>usually resolves to V in classical harmony --<br>mclaren) In classical tonal music, the just seventh<br>cannot coexist with usual melodies, and is<br>only found as a suggestion in the traditional<br>seventh chords.<br>"IV. Pythagorean intonation is dynamic, while<br>Zarlino's just triadic  harmonic intonation is static.<br>Equal temperament is neither one nor the other. <br>It is a compromise, whose intervals do not partake<br>entirely of either of these systems, and thus<br>is a somewhat neutral system whose employment<br>was spurred by the need to find a correct middle<br>ground between Pythagorean intonation's excellence<br>for melody and Zarlino's just intonation system's<br>excellence in harmony.   Equal temperament was<br>not imposed by fiat, but arose from the nature<br>of the music being made.<br>"The result is a certain musical ambiguity; the<br>possibilitity that a given pitch may be taken<br>in more than one sense.  (Das Wohltempierte<br>Klavier of Bach is an example.)  <br>(Well, Mssr. Chailley has fallen into the trap<br>of assuming Bach wrote in 12-tet, but we<br>must grant him parole for that insofar as he was<br>writing around 1958.  People weren't nearly<br>as aware of the use of well temperament in<br>the 17t and 18th century back in the 1950s<br>as they are today, largely due to the efforts<br>of pioneers like Johnny Reinhard--whose <br>remarkable yearly Christmas programs of<br>well-tempered Bach have detwelvulated ears<br>far and wide -- mclaren)<br>"Equal temperament greatly facilitated rapid<br>modulation (for example, listen to<br>Bach's Kleine Harmonisches Lanyrinth<br>for organ) and allowed the employment of<br>modern harmonies. (Presumably Mssr. Chailley<br>refers also to the use of diminished, augmented<br>and seventh chords, which certainly can be<br>found in profusion in the music of Bach --<br>mclaren)<br>"Equal temperament formed the character of<br>the classical epoch of music. (Alexander<br>John Ellis disputes this, along with Patrizio<br>Barbieri.  Both these scholars cite sources<br>to prove that meantone survived on pianos <br>into the early 1840s, while in some parts<br>of Europe--Italy, for instance--meantone<br>was used by orchestras into the 1890s --<br>mclaren)<br>"By the end of the 19th century, musicians <br>had begun to explore extremes of ambiguity.<br>The result was the decadence of fin-de-sicle<br>tonality.  This was a neutral system: it was<br>opposed to firm tonality.  Such departure<br>from strict tonality led to an increasing<br>dissolution of the sense of key (for<br>example, Wagner, Liszt, Debussy).  This<br>ambiguity led to an ensuing agressive<br>negation of tonality (Schoenberg). The<br>result was that any combination of<br>notes was permitted.<br>"Concerning melodic structure, <br>temperament proceeded in the same<br>way. Temperament in and of itself<br>was not opposed to the continuation of<br>classical thematicism based on the<br>C-E-G triad.  Moreover, with the<br>rediscovery and reintroduction of<br>folk melodies around the end of the<br>19th century, ancient melodic structures<br>based on the cycle of pure fifths revived<br>in popularity.  And so some other composers<br>(Debussy, Bartok, Stravinsky, etc.)<br>renewed the thematic structure of music<br>by using harmonies based on primitive<br>categories of consonance divided into<br>only 2 classes, highly consonant, and highly<br>dissonant. (This is an interesting point and<br>one which I've not seen made before. --mclaren)<br>"To conclude, equal temperament provided the<br>necessary conditions (but not sufficient conditions)<br>for dodecaphonic music. (12-tone serialism,<br>presumably -- mclaren) Temperament was<br>definitely an acoustic compromise and marked<br>the starting point of theoretical department from<br>historical precendents.  Once introduced, it was<br>not possible to retain the resonance principle<br>(i.e., Rameau's doctrine that a major chord is<br>based on integer multiples of an unheard<br>fundamental -- mclaren) and thus there was<br>successively greater departure from Pythagorean<br>models. In the absence of consonances typical<br>of that system, sounds tends to devolve into<br>chord-complexes without acoustical rationale,<br>and this led to new concepts of musical<br>organization (musique concrete, electronic music,<br>etc.) as well as serial music (Boulez, Barraque,<br>Stockhausen, etc.) This evolution would have<br>been impossible without the initial confusion<br>introduced by equal temperament.<br>CONCLUSION<br>"The historical change in music from acoustic<br>systems to different ones non-acoustic<br>in nature was not an accident, but a <br>continuation of historical practice which<br>began with the study of acoustical phenomena.<br>"The essential elements of this evolution were<br>in place when a language of music and a method of<br>writing down music emerged."

And that "tetrachords carry<br>inevitably a potential toward modulation... Nevertheless,<br>sharping thirds can be pleasant. (..) The central African<br>musics aren't concerned about melodic modulatory<br>implications... Therefore I do not see that the specific<br>use of wide octaves can be used to discredit the<br>theoretical notion of a just standard." [Will Grant]<br>Will makes some excellent points, with considerable<br>insight. <br>First,  Will G. is certainly right that in many parts of<br>Africa the overall "gamut" of pitch is somewhere<br>in the neighborhood  of a third.  This is not simply<br>based on my listening, but on the research printed<br>in the Journal of Ethnomusicology, etc., the bulk<br>of which supports Will Grant's statement--for<br>*many* African musics.  <br>However, this is not the case for *all* musical<br>traditions in Africa, and may not be the case<br>for a majority.  I don't know enough about <br>African music to decide whether a majority<br>of the cultures use a gamut of a third.<br>However, I do know of several specific exceptions<br>to that rule--and where there are several <br>excpetions to a general ethnomuiscological<br>"rule," experience has taught me that there<br>are apt to be many more. The "weeping song"<br>of the Gisalo, if memory serves, exceeds the<br>compass of a third by a considerable amount,<br>and the ugubhu is typically played using harmonics<br>up to 7. <br>Second:<br>While Will Grant's argument is ingenious and<br>very well thought out, it does not appear to apply<br>to the example cited in my post. Permit me<br>to quote the full text of my original citation:<br>"This definition is refused by the practices <br>of these musicians, who tune their xylophones<br>using adjacent intervals, step by step. Our<br>experimentation verified that 'perfect'<br>consonances are not a consituent of Central<br>African concept of the scale.  These musicians<br>do not judge a strict octave (1200 cents) to<br>be better than a large major seventh (1150<br>cents) in any rgister, probably because of the<br>roughness it creates on the octaves that are<br>always played simultaneously with double<br>sticks in each hand."

On the other<br>hand, it's possible that I've misunderstood<br>the text.  In any case Will might want to<br>study the article in question in detail.<br>Others examples (some outside Africa):<br>The panpipes of the 'Are-'are of the Solomon<br>Islands are tuned in 7 equal-tempered tones<br>to the octave which cannot be understood<br>in terms of the harmonic series (unless, of<br>course, there's something I've overlooked or<br>not taken account of--always possible); the same<br>seems to be true of the xylophones of the Kwaiker<br>indians of central Mexico and Guatamala.<br>The Burmese oboe-like instruments,<br>the drums of the Akan in West Africa,<br>and much of the vocal music of the Kaluli<br>of highland New Guinea and other music<br>from sub-Saharan Africa all seem to use <br>pitches  which systematically avoid just ratios.<br>Of course the most spectacularly non-just<br>non-equal-tempered musical traditions<br>are those of Bali and Java, along with<br>Thailand. No one has succeeded in<br>explaining these musical traditions<br>in terms of small integer ratios, to the<br>best of my knowledge, and so my case<br>seems to stand.  However, it's quite<br>possible I've made some silly error or<br>failed to see some crucial point.

He wrote: "The point is that if a note<br>comes close enough to an octave or a multiple octave, <br>it will sound equivalent, especially in the case of <br>harmonic partials. For example, an interval of 33 Pierce<br>steps exhibits equivalence, even though it is a very<br>different pitch class in the tritave scheme. Even when <br>the even partials are removed, I believe the virtual <br>pitch sensation is not very octave-specific."<br>My ears agree with Paul Erlich's here.  Removing<br>odd or even partials doesn't seem to affect my<br>perception of the Bohlen-Pierce scale.<br>However, Paul E. did not mention whether he was<br>talking about "an interval of 33 Pierce steps"<br>*melodically* or *harmonically.*  That is,<br>sounding the interval as a vertical dyad or<br>as two sequential notes one after the other.<br>Now, my experience is that this makes a *huge*<br>difference in the perception of octave<br>equivalence in non-octave scales.  My ears<br>hear sequential (melodic) intervals as<br>being octave equivalent even if they are <br>significantly off from the octave--upwards<br>of 30 or 40 cents in many cases, especially<br>if the interval is a multiple of an octave--say,<br>2 octaves, 3 octaves, etc.<br>However, the range of detuning within which my<br>ears will accept an interval as octave equivalent <br>is much smaller when the interval is a vertical<br>dyad (harmonic): somewhere in the range of 0-18<br>cents.<br>As a concrete example, take the Bohlen-Pierce<br>scale.  Play melodically the interval of 8 scale<br>steps; if you play the melodic interval reasonably<br>quickly, you'll find that your ear accepts it as<br>a melodic octave.  But if you sound that 8-step<br>interval as a vertical dyad, it will not sound <br>like an octave at all since the interval is <br>1170.4338 cents, outside the acceptable vertical<br>range for octave equivalence (except at very<br>low fundamental frequencies).<br>This brings up an interesting point with regard<br>to non-octave scales: as most of you know, Enrique<br>Moreno has a very different conception of non-octave<br>scales than Gary Morrison or Your Humble E-Mail<br>Correspondent.  Enrique believes that it is pointless<br>and meaningless to try to assign to the intervals of<br>non-octave scales familiar categories such as <br>"third" or "fifth" or "octave."  Instead, Enrique <br>suggests that we accept the intervals of non-octave<br>scales on their own merits, rather than misguidedly<br>trying to jam them into familiar but conceptually<br>and musically limiting categories.<br>This view has merit.  It recognizes the fact that<br>non-octave scales sound different in a basic way<br>from octave = 2.0 scales; Gary Morrison has<br>described non-octave scales as sounding like<br>"the musical equivalent of thick rich chocolate <br>milk shakes" and this is true--there's something<br>unutterably exotic and gorgeously alien about<br>most non-octave scales.  They all share a very<br>sultry foreign "sound" which renders, say,<br>the 12th root of 3, the 15th root of 3 and the <br>13thr oot of 3 and the 25th root of 5 and the<br>37th root of 31 much more akin to one another<br>in "sound" or what Ivor Darreg called "mood"<br>than any trivial considerations of audible<br>octave equivalence.<br>On the other hand, there are problems with <br>Enrique's view of non-octave scale.  For one<br>thing, there exist infinitely many non-octave<br>scales which are audibly identical to familiar<br>octave = 2.0 divisions of the octave.  For<br>example: I defy anyone to tell the difference<br>audibly between 12-TET and the 51st root<br>of 19, or the 105th root of 431, or the 114th <br>root of 727, the 122nd root of 1153, or the 126th<br>root of 1453.  THe difference between a 2/1<br>and the equivalent interval in each of these<br>"non-octave" scales is less than 1/3 cent--<br>you *cannot* hear the difference between these<br>intonations and 12.<br>There exist infinitely many non-octave scales<br>audibly identical (not close, *identical* to<br>the ears, with a 2/1 less than 0.1 cents off<br>from 1200 cents) to 13-TET, 14-TET, 15-TET,<br>and so on.<br>This being the case, we are forced to recognize<br>that for a significant sub-class of non-octave<br>Nth root of K scales, there is *no audible<br>difference whatsoever* between  these and <br>some N-TET octave = 2.0 scale.  This being the<br>case, it would obviously be perverse in a <br>tuning audibly identical to 12-TET to try to<br>describe the intervals in exotic Nth root of<br>K terms rather than in terms of the familiar<br>fifth, major and minor third, fourth, major<br>and minor second, and so on.<br>Thus the situation for non-octave scales is<br>more complicated than anyone has mentioned<br>to date. <br>On the one hand, listeners will tend to hear<br>intervals in these scales *very* differently<br>melodically than harmonically if the interval<br>is slightly off from a familiar interval.<br>On the other hand, there exist a large class<br>of non-octave scales which sound audibly<br>*identical* to familiar dvisions of the octave.<br>Lastly, there's the question: In a given Nth<br>root of K non-octave scale, what is the most<br>consonant interval?  That is, what is the<br>interval which takes the musical and acoustic <br>place of the 2:1 octave in ordinary divisions<br>of the octave with harmonic series timbres?<br>--<br>There is no simple answer to this question.<br>A superficial answer is: obviously, if we're <br>talking about the Nth root of K, then K is the <br>most consonant interval in all cases.<br>This is sometimes true, and sometimes clearly<br>false.<br>In the 13th root of 3, the 3:1 ratio is clearly the<br>primary consonant interval.  It functions musically<br>in the same way that a 2:1 does.  If you "double"<br>pitches at an interval of 13 scale steps in the<br>13th root of 3, you'll get much the same result<br>as when you double pitches at an interval of 12<br>scale steps in 12/oct.<br>In the 21st root of 17, however, the interval<br>of 21 scale steps is not nearly as great a<br>point of acoustic rest as the interval of 3 scale<br>steps.  <br>Moreover, all Ks are not created equal.  <br>Intervals which are low members of the harmonic<br>series multplied by small integers tend to sound<br>more consonant than Ks which are high members<br>of the harmonic series.  Thus , an interval of 17:1<br>sounds less consonant than 6:1 since 6:1 is 3:1 times<br>2, while 17 is relatively far up the harmonic series.<br>Even this statement must be qualified, for the<br>harmonic series exhibits the property  that <br>consonance decreases as one climbs the harmonic<br>series, then suddenly it begins to increase as one<br>climbs further, then consonance decreases again,<br>then it suddenly increases, and so on.<br>For example:  2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are highly consonant.<br>7 is less so, intermediate in fact between consonance<br>and dissonance; 8, 9, 10 are highly consonant, 11<br>is much less consonant; 12 is highly consonant;<br>13 is relatively dissonant; 14, as a multple of 7,<br>is intermediate in consonance; 15, 16 are highly<br>consonant; 17 is relatively dissonant; 18 is highly<br>consonant; 19 is quite consonant, ditto<br>20 and 21; but 22 and 23 are relatively dissonant;<br>24, 25 are highly consonant; 26 is dissonant,<br>27 is extremely consonant; 28 intermediate;<br>29 is dissonant...and so on.<br>Thus the particular K is question must be considered,<br>in addition to the issue of whether the Nth root<br>of K scale contains an interval interval within<br>the N:1 span that sounds more consonant than<br>N:1.<br>One last point is that the absolute size of the<br>musical interval in question is very important.<br>Paul Erlich mentioned that an interval of 33<br>scale-steps of the Bohlen-Pierce scale sounds<br>like an interval of 4 octaves.  However, this<br>interval comes out to 4828.0396 cents, 28 cents<br>away from 4 octaves.  The ear doesn't tend to<br>notice this discrepancy for very large intervals<br>because the two notes are so greatly separated<br>from one another than there is little opportunity<br>for the harmonics of the lower and the upper<br>note to beat with one another.  Most acoustic timbres <br>exhibit very little energy above the 16th harmonic,<br>and the 16th harmonic is the fundamental of a<br>pitch 4 octaves above the base note of a dyad.<br>Thus, while an interval of 33 scale steps in<br>the Bohlen-Pierce scale is about as far away <br>from the octave as an interval of 8 scale<br>steps (28.039 cents for the former as opposed to<br>29.567 cents for the latter), 8 scale-steps in<br>the 13th root of 3 sounds very far from octave<br>equivalence while 33 scale-steps sounds <br>reasonably close to octave equivalence because<br>many harmonics of both notes fall within the<br>critical band in the case of the 8-step interval<br>while almost no harmonics of both notes fall<br>within the same critical band in the case of the<br>33-step interval.<br>In short, octave equivalence and the question of<br>which intervals will most tend to function and<br>sound as points of acoustic and musical rest in<br>intervals formed from  the notes of non-octave<br>scales are issues more complex than anyone on <br>this forum appears to have suggested.<br>--<br>Paul Erlich goes on to write that "In the case<br>of inharmonic partials, octave equivalence may <br>play less of a role, but still exists, and is less<br>demanding as to intonation."  Both my experiments<br>with additive synthesis inharmonic timbres in<br>Csound and William Sethares' experiments with<br>resynthesized Fourier-analyzed timbres with<br>stretched partials strongly contradict this<br>statement.  In particular William Sethares has<br>a set of instrument timbres resynthesized with<br>all harmonics stretched so that the octave is a <br>ratio of 2.1 instead of 2.0, etc.<br>Playing a vertical octave dyad with such timbres<br>produces unbearable dissonance; but playing a<br>vertical octave whose ratio is 2.1 rather than 2.0<br>produces the familiar sensation of octave<br>equivalence.  So the evidence *strongly* indicates<br>that 2:1 octave equivalence goes away when the<br>timbre becomes inharmonic, and this is confirmed<br>by William Sethares' mathematical procedure for<br>finding scale pitches from an inharmonic timbre.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 23 Nov 1996 18:34 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05277; Sat, 23 Nov 1996 18:35:39 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05269<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA12668; Sat, 23 Nov 1996 09:33:58 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 23 Nov 1996 09:33:58 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9611231238.A13352-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4143 href="#4143">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/1996 7:28:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: the future of microtonality<br>--<br>While watching a particularly magnificent sunset<br>with Maxfield Parrish clouds this evening,  it occurred <br>to me how far we've come--and how much there remains<br>to do.<br>The history of intonation can be divided into five<br>eras. The first era, lasting roughly 15,000 years,<br>began when nomadic hunters first built musical<br>instruments.  Since bone flutes have been discovered<br>in caves coeval with Neolithic stone tools from <br>15,000 years ago, it's clear that the act of building<br>musical instruments predates the discovery of<br>writing.  Thus xenharmonics is an earlier and more<br>basic activity than reading and writing, and our <br>pre-school curriculum should be changed from the<br>"three Rs" to the "three Xs." (Xenharmonic instrument<br>building, Xenharmonic music-making, and Xenharmonic<br>'Rithmetic.  JI is a superb way to teach fractions because<br>you can *hear* them.) In the Trois Freres cave in Frances <br>there is a clear depiction of a performer using a mouth<br>bow (also called a Jaws Harp), and since none of<br>these instruments use 12-tone equal temperament<br>it's also clear that microtonality has been actively<br>practiced for at least 15,000 years, and probably<br>longer.<br>The second era of intonation was inaugurated by<br>John Napier with his discovery of logarithms in<br>the mid-16th century.  There's no mystery why<br>the late 16th century witnessed such a remarkable<br>explosion of interest in different tuning systems--<br>"Napier's bones" had as vast an impact on composers<br>and music theorists of the late 16th century as<br>computers have had on composers and music<br>theorists of the late 20th century.  Vicentino's<br>and Huyghens' advocacy of 31-TET and Titelouz's,<br>and Salinas' interest in 19-TET precisely follow<br>the introduction of logarithms which for the<br>first time allowed music theorists to easily<br>calculate added or subtracted musical intervals.<br>(I mean the 16th century Salinas, not J.A.M.<br>Salinas here!)<br>The third era of microtonality was ushered in by <br>John Henry Maudslay's 1843 invention of the modern<br>lathe--which led immediately to modern machine<br>tools, precise and reliably machined tolerances,<br>and the standardization of machined parts. <br>Woodwind instruments and keyboard instruments<br>could not be turned out at simultaneously low cost<br>and high intonational accuracy prior to the Maudsley <br>lathe.  Even brass instruments and guitars were influenced <br>by modern precision machine tools: the equipment used<br>to bent and shape the tubes of which brass instruments<br>are made and the equipment used to make wound guitar<br>strings has since the 1840s been entirely machined<br>by modern precision machine tools.  (The valves of<br>trumpets owe a particular debt to this technology.)<br>To a large extent, Maudslay's lathe led to the <br>standardization of 12-TET in the western world and<br>to the rule of the modern orchestra as the supreme<br>ideal of western music.  And of course large <br>orchestras with complete families of all instruments<br>were only possible once the woodwinds and brass<br>instruments and the piano had been made intonationally<br>accurate by the Maudsley lathe & its progeny.  (This<br>is why earlier "orchestras" uses primarily stringed<br>instruments with a few valveless brass instruments.)<br>The fourth era of microtonality was inaugurated in<br>1959 by Max Mathews' MUSIC I through IV computer<br>programs.  All current commercial digital <br>synthesizers are essentially hard-wired subsets of<br>the Mathews MUSIC N paradigm, with special-purpose<br>ICs which allow sounds to be calculated in real<br>time when the keys are pressed.<br>The fifth era of microtonality dawned when the<br>first fully retunable digital synthesizers appeared:<br>the DX7II family in 1987.  This was the first time<br>it was easily possible to explore an unlimited number<br>of different tunings using many simultaneous <br>polyphonic notes with a large pallette of different <br>timbres.<br>--<br>It's worth a thought or two.  Although we've come<br>far, we're still at  the beginning of the journey.  The<br>most recent advance in intonation only came 9<br>years ago, when for the first time in human history<br>it was possible to rapidly switch between different<br>tunings while playing enough simultaneous notes<br>on an instrument cheap enough for anyone to afford<br>in a large enough gamut of timbres to get a reasonable<br>idea of what each intonation sounds like both <br>harmonically and melodically.<br>9 years!  That's all!<br>Retunable MIDI synthesizers offer an almost unbelievable<br>breakthrough for the microtonal composer.  Prior to<br>1987, composers either had to settle for a very limited<br>timbral range (retunable analog Moog-type synthesizers)<br>or a very small number of simultaneous notes (home-built<br>non-12 guitars, metallophones, etc.) or a fabulously<br>expensive computer music set-up (prior to the mid-1980s<br>most computer music facilities were based around DEC<br>minicomputers costing a quarter of a million dollars each<br>--or more.  Prior to 1980, no privately owned single-user <br>high-quality 16-bit computer music  facility existed <br>anywhere in the world).<br>While we've come far, it's sobering to realize that this<br>latest breakthrough is only 9 years old.  To put it another<br>way, 9.5 years ago, if you wanted to hear the sound of<br>a string orchestra playing in 27-tone equal temperament<br>or Partch's monophonic fabric or the free-free metal<br>bar scale, you would have had to get a doctorate at an<br>elite computer music institution.  Only grad students <br>at a few elite schools had access to the kind of computer<br>power that would allow realization of xenharmonic music<br>with a large number of different timbres and a large<br>array of different tunings.<br>Your other choice would have been to bury yourself<br>in sawdust (like Partch) for 20 years to produce a<br>set of xenharmonic instruments; but this still meant<br>confining yourself to a single tuning system.  If you<br>wanted to hear many different tunings played on<br>many different instruments so as to compare the "sound"<br>of each intonation, prior to 1987 you either had to<br>be lucky enough to work as a grad student at IRCAM<br>or Stanford or Princeton or Simon Fraser University<br>or the U. of Toronto or Columbia or one or two other<br>places.<br>--<br>In retrospect, our progress has been staggering.  For<br>15,000 years, stasis--hand-built instruments, tuning<br>by ear.  Suddenly, logarithmic calculation of musical<br>intervals; then, 100 years later, high-speed digital<br>computers.  30 years later, inexpensive special-purpose<br>digital computers with built-in tuning tables (these<br>special-purpose computers are now called "digital<br>keyboards" but this should not deceive us as to<br>their lineage or essential function).<br>Looking forward, what can we see in the<br>xenharmonic future?<br>--<br>Clearly the rapid rate of increase in the speed of <br>desktop computers means that within 10 to 15 years<br>every synthesis algorithm currently used in Csound<br>and its ilk will run in real time.  Of course, new<br>and even more demanding synthesis algorithms<br>will be developed in the meantime--but within the<br>next 10 years or so the average person will be<br>able to use a remarkable array of extremely<br>sophisticated synthesis techniques to play<br>notes generated completely in software by<br>a desktop general-purpose computer in real time.<br>This will probably be the next era of microtonality.<br>--<br>One likely result is that live concerts will<br>continue to fade away. This has been happening<br>already, but the trend will accelerate.  Johnny<br>Reinhard has already noticed it.  Within a few<br>years live concerts using traditional acoustic<br>musical instruments will be priced far out of the<br>range of the average person's ability to afford<br>'em, and they'll be available in only a few of<br>the world's largest cities.<br>Another of the implications of this next era is that it<br>will for the first time be possible to calculate<br>the timbre of a microtonal instrument on the fly.<br>Thus, it will be of great interest to match timbres<br>to tunings.<br>At present William Sethares' work in this area has<br>gone relatively unnoticed by the microtonal community<br>because exotic, expensive and wildly time-consuming<br>programs are needed to analyze and resynthesize <br>acoustic sounds.  As of 1996, it requires anywhere<br>from a few minutes to several hours to number-crunch<br>an acoustic sound, manipulate its partials, and <br>resynthesize them so that the timbre fits the tuning.<br>Programs like MatLab cost $2000 (yes, two THOUSAND<br>dollars) and are difficult to use though adequately<br>flexible; programs like Csound's HETRO and on the <br>Mac LEMUR cost nothing but are inadequate for <br>microtonal/musical use because of their lack<br>of flexibility. (In MatLab you can tell the program<br>to take input partials and map them to the closest<br>notes in 19-TET; you cannot do this with HETRO or<br>LEMUR.  Both HETRO and LEMUR prevent the user<br>from accessing the guts of the program in this way.)<br>Moreover, all of these programs require minutes<br>or hours to complete a single analysis/synthesis<br>cycle of a single note.  For multi-sampled notes<br>spread over an 88-note keyboard, hundreds of<br>analysis/synthesis cycles are required.  And<br>for (say) 30 different timbres in (say)<br>30 different tunings, tens of thousands of<br>different analysis/resynthesis cycles would<br>be needed.   This means years worth of non-stop<br>computing time even with today's 200 Mhz<br>CPUs.<br>Bill Schottstaedt several years ago mentioned<br>that he felt the need for a machine at least<br>100 times as fast as the original NeXT cube.<br>Given the magnitude of the tasks which face<br>us in matching timbres to microtonal tunings,<br>that probably represents a very conservative <br>estimate.<br>--<br>Beyond real-time resynthesis and its implied<br>total timbral & pitch flexibility, what are the <br>next few eras of microtonality likely to be?<br>Virtual synthesis and performance environments<br>are likely to appear.  <br>This implies that a generalized musical controller<br>represents the next era of microtonality, beyond<br>the next 10 years.  With VR gear it should be easy<br>enough to produce a virtual theremin or a virtual<br>marimba (we probably won't be using MIDI, but<br>a superset thereof, possibly based on FIreWire<br>or the Uuniversal Serial Bus) or a virtual violin<br>or a virtual Bosanquet keyboard.<br>It's unclear whether VR generalized keyboards will<br>catch on; a large part of musical instrument<br>performance is muscle memory built by tactile<br>feedback.  VR gear offers no tactile feedback, nor<br>is there any prospect of adding it to VR gear<br>at low cost in the foreseeable future. (So much<br>for teledildonics, gearheads.)<br>So beyond the next 10 years my guess would be<br>that the next era in microtonality will be heralded<br>by new types of controllers, specifically Bosanquet-<br>type controllers...  But it's unclear whether they'll<br>be physical controllers or virtual instruments.<br>--<br>What are the current gaps?  What kinds of tools<br>and theories do we need to push microtonality<br>beyond the extremely primitive point at we<br>find ourselves in the late 1990s?<br>--<br>First and most important is a generalized MIDI<br>keyboard.  The lack of a true generalized 2-D<br>keyboard has crippled microtonality to a <br>devastating extent.  Paul Rapoport has pointed<br>out repeatedly in this forum that it's almost<br>impossible to perform useful non-12 music <br>on a standard 7-white-5-black keyboard,<br>and he's right.  A few of us have managed<br>to produce some highly microtonal music<br>using conventional keyboards by subjecting<br>ourselves to a deeply perverted S&M-style<br>conditioning process whereby we unlearn<br>conventional fingering techniques and<br>chord progressions--but this has proven<br>useful only for the equal temperaments and<br>just arrays with roughly 22 or fewer notes.<br>Beyond that point, we've had to flounder<br>around with solo melodic lines or N-out-of-M<br>notes of a given intonation.<br>--<br>So my first clarion call to the members of this<br>tuning forum is:  someone get to work <br>commercializing a cheap reliable MIDI <br>Bosanquet-type keyboard!  Harold Fortuin has<br>already built one, but it's unclear whether<br>his licensing agreement with STEIM will let<br>him commercialize it, and it's even more<br>unclear whether STEIM gives a damn about<br>driving the cost down on the clavette and<br>pumping these things out by the thousands.<br>Probably not.  Most large music foundations<br>have zero interest in doing the tough work<br>required to move the state of the art forward<br>and produce tectonic change;  large music<br>foundations prefer to sponsor works of<br>arts and individuals and thus produce <br>obvious tangible short-term one-of-a-kind<br>results.<br> This leaves it to you, the members of this<br>tuning forum.  Between you, there's more than<br>enough talent and ability to produce a cheap<br>commerical reliable MIDI generalized <br>keyboard.  <br>Who among you will build one that I can<br>afford to buy?<br>--<br>The second enormous gap is in software tools.<br>Specifically, we need easy-to-use MIDI software<br>tools which allow us to quickly and efficiently<br>manipulate xenharmonic MIDI files.<br>The problem is this:  if you're in, say, Partch's<br>43-tone and you want to modulate to the 3/2,<br>that means switching to a second MIDI channel<br>in which all the intervals have been tuned up<br>by a 3/2.  However, there's no easy way to<br>directly transpose the existing MIDI sequence<br>on channel 1 and use it harmoniously on channel<br>2 along with channel 1 without encountering<br>awkward commas.  A human performing such<br>a modulation in just intonation would know<br>which notes on channel 2 to omit and which<br>notes "fit" with channel 1.  But MIDI, being<br>nothing more than a set of note numbers from<br>1-27,  knows nothing of which 3/2-transposed<br>just pitches on channel 2 "fit" with the original<br>pitches on channel 1.<br>Clearly, we need an intelligent MIDI file parser.<br>This MIDI file parser would offer a simple input<br>screen and would quickly process input MIDI<br>files and generate output MIDI files.<br>In the example above, it would take MIDI notes<br>on channel 1 and output MIDI notes on channel 2.<br>Notes on channel 2 which don't "fit" with those<br>on channel would be left on MIDI channel 1.<br>This example concerns just intonation, but an<br>equally important example could be taken from<br>non-12 equal temperament.  Suppose you're<br>composing a set of variations in 5-TET through<br>53-TET; you want to play a theme in the nearest<br>notes to a given set of pitches in each of those<br>equal temperaments.  Your input is a set of<br>MIDI notes.  How do you proceed?<br>At present, a lot of skull sweat and programming<br>is required.  Again, what we desperately need is<br>an intelligent MIDI file parser.  The parser would<br>offer a simple input screen (something like: "input<br>number of tones/oct?" _____  "Number of output<br>equal temperaments? (1-16)" ____   "Enter output<br>ET number 1 and track number: " ___  ____ ...."<br>In other words, this intelligent parser would<br>accept user input and process a single MIDI<br>file with a single track and generate an output<br>MIDI file with multiple tracks.  Each output<br>track would contain the MIDI notes of the <br>closest notes to a given set of pitches in<br>a desired equal temperament.<br>There is nothing like this in existence anywhere<br>that I know.  It is an extremely important <br>requirement, since many situations arise<br>every day in which such xenharmonic MIDI<br>file processing is an absolute necessity.<br>Let me give another example of badly needed<br>this kind of intelligent MIDI file parser is:<br>suppose you have a MIDI synth module like <br>the Proteus II orcehstral block.  This MIDI<br>synth is basically a playback-only unit.  It<br>contains lots of orchestral samples.  Because<br>these samples are fixed in ROM, they can't<br>be changed.  This means that if you want <br>to play the Proteus II in Partch 43 tone<br>monophonic fabric pitches, most of the<br>samples will sound godawful because they'll<br>be either far too high or far too low.  That is,<br>the note at which the sample was orginally<br>recorded becomes farther and farther away<br>from the pitch played in Partch 43 tone  JI<br>as you move toward the extreme upper and<br>lower end of the keyboard.<br>Because the Proteus II has only one tuning<br>table, you're stuck.  The only way around this<br>problem is an intelligent MIDI file parser.<br>What you need to do is break up the tuning<br>table into 4 blocks of 12 out of the Partch<br>43 just pitches;  each track would play<br>12 of Partch 43 on a different channel.<br>You then tune the Proteus II to set #1 of<br>12 out of Partch 43 and play the processed<br>MIDI track #1 containing MIDI tones<br>for only 12 out of Partch 43.  You record<br>this to hard disk or ADAT or portastudio.<br>Then you play back processed MIDI track #2<br>after returning the Proteus II to the second<br>12-out-of-Partch-43 pitch table and record<br>that in simul-sync with the first track.<br>And so on for 4 complete tracks.<br>When played back all together, the 4 <br>separate tracks completely avoid the<br>chimpunking (samples played much too<br>high or low) and sound as they should.<br>This can only be done with the aid of<br>an intelligent MIDI file parser.<br>We desperately need something like this.<br>This tuning forum surely boasts a<br>remarkable overload of programming<br>talent.  Who among you will write<br>such an intelligent MIDI file parser?<br>--<br>A third and extremely important task<br>that someone needs to do is to tear<br>down and resynthesize a complete<br>set of sampled orchestral timbres<br>so that the altered timbres are<br>maximally consonant in equal<br>temperaments 5 through 53 per<br>octave.<br>This is an enormous task, requiring<br>fantastic amounts of processing<br>power.  Who among you will accomplish<br>this vital task?<br>--<br>A fourth extremely important gap<br>in the xenharmonic toolkit is a set<br>of MIDI file processing programs<br>which clean up the output from<br>non-standard controllers.  As we<br>all know, microtonality accomodates<br>atypical controllers--wind controllers,<br>MIDI violin controllers, MIDI theremins,<br>MIDI guitars.  The problem is that most<br>of these controllers are not yet ready<br>for prime time.  They output loads of<br>spurious notes and glitches.  There<br>should be easily-available shareware<br>MIDI file processing programs which<br>take input MIDI wind controller files<br>and search-and-destroy all the tiny<br>brief note-on glitches and spurious<br>pitch-bends.  Ditto MIDI theremin<br>input tracks: ditto MIDI guitar input<br>tracks.<br>Who among you will produce such a<br>piece of shareware programming?<br>--<br>We also need music theory tools to<br>deal with unanswered questions<br>in microtonality.  <br>Example: why does a tuning with<br>"good" numbers like 24-TET sound<br>so uninteresting while a tuning<br>with "bad" numbers like 9-TET sound<br>so musical and so fascinating?<br>We need better theoretical tools<br>than crude measurements of this or<br>that scale against the harmonic series.<br>As has been pointed out often enough,<br>the harmonic series is not the be-all<br>and end-all of music; most musical<br>cultures throughout the world do not<br>use pitches derived from the harmonic<br>series, and psychoacoustic studies<br>demonstrate that when intervals drawn<br>from the harmonic series are played,<br>most people hear them as "impure" and<br>"not just."  Computer analysis of live<br>performances by expert musicians also<br>show wild deviations from the target notes,<br>which deviations are nonetheless heard as<br>being "in tune."<br>We need more and better psychoacoustic<br>research to understand this, and we need<br>more sophisticated theories of intonation<br>to explain these results.<br>We need better music theoretic tools to<br>quantify the "moods" of the various tunings,<br>as Ivor Darreg called them.  Everyone knows<br>that 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40-TET<br>share a similar "sound" or "mood."  But we<br>need to be able to turn it into hard numbers.<br>Similarly, everyone knows that Ptolemy's intense<br>diatonic and the scale of Olympos share more<br>of a "mood" than the enharmonic genus, but again<br>we need more finely honed theories to quantify<br>this.<br>We all know that the "limit" of a just tuning<br>has an important effect on the "mood" of the <br>scale.  But we need theoretical tools which<br>will allow finer distinctions to be made <br>among just tunings than something as coarse<br>as the "limit" of the tuning.  At present, there<br>is a singular dearth of such theoretical tools.<br>--mclaren <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 25 Nov 1996 17:10 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07097; Mon, 25 Nov 1996 17:11:58 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07185<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA03226; Mon, 25 Nov 1996 08:11:55 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 25 Nov 1996 08:11:55 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v02130501aebf733ec12e@[192.168.11.203]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4166 href="#4166">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/27/1996 7:39:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: Muddy thinking, con artistry, and John Cage<br> - part I of 2<br>--<br>Many thanks to Eric Lyon for falling into<br>the Bengal tiger trap hidden in my post<br>in Topic 3 of Tuning Digest 803.<br>By helpfully committing so many flagrant<br>logical errors, he has given me leave<br>to dilate on  important points which the<br>brevity of Topic 3, digest 803 did not permit<br>me to discuss.<br>My post stated (in part): "Exactly what is<br>an experimental composer? <br>"Which hypothesis does the experimental<br>composer conduct an experiment to test?<br>"What is the experimental control?

Of the nature<br>of an experiment; tentative."<br>John Cage's use of the word "experimental"<br>violently contradicts all three of these <br>meanings.<br>--<br>Lyons' logical error is his assumption that<br>he can misuse and abuse and warp and twist <br>the word  "experimental" at will. (Notably, <br>this is one of John Cage's most flagrant <br>errors as well.)<br>And, like Cage, Lyon has not only misused<br>the word "experimental," he has demonstrated <br>his ignorance of the meaning of the word --<br>and of its profoundly important implications<br>in our culture.<br>The word "experimental" inevitably takes on<br>overtones of the scientific method whenever<br>it is used nowadays. "Of the nature of an <br>experiment" (the dictionary definition which<br>refers to this implication of the word) refers <br>to the use of experimental technique and <br>methodology in the course of applying the <br>scientific method. <br>What is the scientific method?<br>Clearly Eric Lyon does know.  He states that<br>"the scientist makes the utmost effort to<br>*disprove* his hypothesis to determine its<br>veracity." <br>This is not the scientific method.  It is<br>never enough merely to "make the utmost<br>effort to disprose" an hypothesis, since<br>one's utmost efforts are likely to be futile--<br>life is short, experiments are complex, and<br>there are too many possible ways of doing<br>the wrong experiment.<br>For example, suppose I hypothesize that light<br>is a form of electromagnetic radiation.  Such<br>radiation is--as we all know--produced by<br>accelerating an electric charge or a magnet.  <br>To test this hypothesis, I shake a magnet with <br>my hand.  No matter how rapidly I shake the<br>magnet, it never emits any light.  To do<br>my utmost to disprove my hypothesis, I<br>hook up the magnet to a widget which <br>agitates the magnet over a wide range of<br>frequencies, up to thousands of times a<br>second.  Having "done my utmost" to disprove<br>the hypothesis that light is electromagnetic<br>radiation, I conclude that my hypothesis is<br>false.<br>What's wrong with this "experiment"?<br>The problem is that I would have had to<br>agaitate the magnet at a rate of about<br>10^15 cycles per second to get it emit<br>visible light. Doing "my utmost to disprove"<br>the hypothesis wasn't remotely adequate,<br>because I didn't know the range of requencies<br>required for visible light.  Another variant<br>of such bad science would be to fire up<br>a radio broadcast tower, transmit over a<br>wide range of frequencies, and show that<br>in no case was light ever emitted.  Again,<br>this fails the test of a scientific experiment<br>because experimental scientists do NOT<br>try to "do their utmost to disprove the <br>hypothesis."  Rather, in the real world they calculate <br>an  expected result from a mathematical model<br>and perform repeatable experiments to determine<br>whether the calculated values match the<br>observed experimental results.<br>Moreover, Lyon's claim is obviously false for<br>another reason. It is *never* possible <br>to "make the utmost effort to *disprove*" <br>an hypothesis, since one can never prove<br>a negative.  The effort required to disprove<br>an hypothesis is infinite and thus the utmost<br>effort is unending and without limit.<br>For example, a scientist who hypothesizes<br>that a psuedorandom number generator<br>produces a good simulation of an ergodic <br>stochastic source would--by Lyon's criterion--<br>have to perform an infinite number of tests<br>on an infinite number of runs by the pseudo-<br>random number generator.  Otherwise, the<br>scientist would not be "doing his utmost<br>to disprove his hypothesis."<br>Of course, no scientist does what Eric Lyon<br>suggests because this is not science.  Lyon<br>clearly does not know what science is,<br>what constitutes an experiment, or the<br>nature of the scientific method.<br>"Experiment is the sole source of truth. It<br>alone can teach us something new; it alone<br>can give us certainty. These are two points<br>that cannot be questioned. (..) It is not<br>sufficient merely to observe; we must use<br>our observations, and for that purpose we<br>must generalize.  This is what has always<br>been done, only as the recollection of past<br>errors has made man more and more<br>circumspect, he has observed more and more<br>and generalized less and less. (..) What<br>then is a good experiment? It is that which <br>teaches us something more than an isolated<br>fact.  Without generalization, prediction is<br>impossible. The circumstances under which<br>one has operated will never again be <br>reproduced simultaneously. The fact observed<br>will never been repeated. All that can be <br>affirmed is that under analagous circumstances<br>an analagous fact will be produced. To predict<br>it, we must therefore invoke the aid of analogy--<br>that it to say, even at this stage, we must<br>generalize. (..) Experiment only gives us a<br>certain number of isolated points. They must<br>be connected by a continuous line, and this<br>is a true generalization. But more is done.<br>The curve thus traced will pass between and near<br>the points themselves. Thus we are not<br>restricted to generalizing our experiment,<br>we must correct it. (..) Detached facts cannot<br>therefore satisfy us, and that is why our science<br>must be ordered, or, better still, generalized."<br>[Poincare, Henri, "Hypotheses in Physics," pg.<br>142, from Science and Hypothesis, Dover<br>Edition, 1952] <br>One of the finest mathematicians of all time,<br>Poincare had a good idea what the scientific<br>method involved. "Every experiment must<br>enable us to make a maximum number of<br>repdictions having the highest possible <br>degree of probability. The problem is, so to<br>speak, to increase the output of the scientific<br>machine. I may be permitted to compare science<br>to a library which must go on increasing<br>indefinitely; the librarian has limited funds<br>for his purchases, and he must, therefore,<br>strain every nerve not to waste them." [Poincare,<br>op. cit, pg. 144] <br>Lyons' claim about the scientific method<br>grossly violates Poincare's principle of<br>experimental parsimony. This is as we would<br>expect, since Lyon understands nothing of<br>the scientific method; but Poincare makes<br>it pellucidly clear that quick rejection of<br>an hypothesis is of the utmost importance.<br>"Every generalization is a hypothesis. <br>Hypothesis therefore plays a necessary role,<br>which no one has ever contested. Only, it<br>should always be as soon as possible <br>submitted to verification. ...If it cannot<br>stand this test, it must be abandoned without<br>any hesitation. (..) If [the hypothesis] is not<br>verified, it is because there is something<br>unexpected and extraordinary about it, because<br>we are on the point of finding something unknown<br>and new. Has the hypothesis thus rejected been<br>made sterile? Far from it.  It may even be<br>said that it has rendered more service than<br>a true hypothesis. Not only has it been the<br>occasion of a decisive experiment, but if<br>this experiement had been made by chance,<br>without the hypothesis, no conclusion could<br>have been drawn; nothing extraordinary<br>would have been seen; and only one fact the<br>more would have been catalogued, without<br>deducing from it the remotest consequence."<br>[Poincare, Henri, op cit., pg. 151]<br>Notice that this latter pointless activity<br>is *precisely* what Cage advocates. From<br>this "experiment...made by chance" without<br>an hypothesis, no conclusion can be drawn;<br>the outcome is "without the remotest<br>consequence."  This is not science.  This is<br>not an experiment.  It is not "experimental."<br>Neither Eric Lyon nor John Cage understood<br>this--because neither of them understood<br>the meaning of the word "experiment," the<br>nature of the scientific method, or (apparently)<br>any of the other technical vocabulary they<br>have chosen to misuse.<br>This discussion of the the experimental method<br>is particularly appropriate to  microtonality <br>because, as we've seen, time and time again <br>xenharmonic intonations have been <br>dismissed as "useless" and "impractical"<br>and "unmusical" on the basis of abstract<br>calculations--yet these same intonations <br>prove superbly useful for composers of<br>microtonal music.  Barbour, for instance,<br>dismissed 19-tet: yet reams of excellent<br>19-tet music has been composed.  Fox-<br>Strangways dismissed just intonation as<br>impractical--yet Partch and the members of<br>the JIN have composed enormous amounts of<br>beautiful music using ji.  15-tet has been<br>pooh-poohed as "unmusical," yet Easley<br>Blackwood has proven that it is not only<br>musical but fertile ground for microtonal<br>composition.  And so on.<br>Thus, it is especially vital when discussing<br>microtonality to have a firm grasp on the<br>scientific method, for new tunings must<br>always be *tested* by *experiment* before<br>they can be accepted or discarded.  And<br>Eric Lyon makes this difficult because he<br>has given a series of utterly false definitions<br>of "experiment" and by implication the scientific<br>method.<br>Instead, what scientists actually do is to<br>try to prove their hypotheses by measuring<br>physical events and comparing the results<br>with calculations based on mathematical<br>models derived from their hypotheses.<br>To proceed in the opposite way, by trying (and<br>failing) to disprove one's hypothesis, is futile<br>and in fact a profound logical fallacy.  For<br>Lyon reasons that if a large enough number of<br>instances in which an hypothesis is not<br>true cannot be demonstrated, the hypothesis <br>must be correct. This is obviously false, and it<br>has been known to be false for more than two<br>thousand years: Aristotle discussed this logical<br>error, and it has been used as a textbook example<br>of faulty reasoning in universities throughout<br>Medieval Europe, the great institutions of<br>learning of the Renaissance, and up to the<br>modern day.<br>This reasoning is faulty because no matter how<br>many experiments you perform to disprove your<br>hypothesis, it doesn't guarantee that *both* your<br>hypothesis *and* the null hypothesis might be<br>false, and the truth might be a third possibility<br>you hadn't thought of. <br>Notice that this is *exactly* and *precisely*<br>the same logical fallacy into which critics of JI and<br>microtonality have consistently fallen; a theorist<br>here and there attempts to compose in a xenharmonic<br>intonation, and knowing nothing about the intonation,<br>produces unlistenable junk.  From this they conclude<br>that microtonal tunings are "useless" and "unmusical."<br>Barbour is a prime example: his misuse of JI--in which<br>hs tries to compose a passage which modules from C<br>to F# without changing any of the pitches by a comma--<br>does not show that JI is "useless" or "unmusical,"<br>it merely shows that Barbour's use of JI is <br>inept, unmusical and willfully ignorant.<br>This should be so obvious as to require no <br>explanation, but apparently  this kind of <br>2500-year-old logical fallacy is news to <br>many of you, including Eric Lyon.<br>(Sigh)<br>The scientific method does not stress disproof,<br>but positive demonstrations, for precisely<br>this reason. A million pieces of bad music<br>composed by people ignorant of JI do not<br>disprove the utility of JI: but one good piece<br>of music composed by someone knowledgable<br>of JI *DOES* prove the intonation's utility.<br>Eric Lyon clearly does not understand the<br>scientific method, nor the logic behind it.  These <br>concepts are apparently alien to him, just as they were <br>to John Cage, just as no "experimental" composer<br>appears to have known what the scientific method<br>involves or why it is *vitally* important when<br>dealing with new intonations.<br>As John Backus pointed out, "terms borrowed<br>from the field of science must be used with their<br>precise scientific meanings."  Otherwise, the result<br>will be pseudo-science, "disregard for the accepted<br>meanings of scientific terms, (..) unintelligibility,<br>and (..) complete lack of any reference to the results<br>of other workers as support for (..) statements."<br>[Backus, J.
