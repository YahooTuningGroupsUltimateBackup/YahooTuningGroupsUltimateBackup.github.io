In fact, it sounds like that's just what you're doing<br>> here:<br>> <br>> >My question would be, "why try to use a structure which doesn't suggest<br>> >itself<br>> >musically?".<br>> <br>> where by "musically" you mean nothing but "in terms of ratios."<br><br>You're putting words in my mouth. Let me paraphrase, first "purpose",<br>then "suggest itself musically".<br><br>What I mean by purpose is the association "a pleasant chord". In 12tet, a <br>Major 6 9 chord has taken on this association over time just as diminished<br>chords have taken on the association of "danger". This can happen because<br>in 12tet a Major 6 9 chord is relatively consonant compared to other<br>possible structures, even though if you listen closely, it's actually<br>dissonant. This sort of thing can take place in any limited pitch set, where <br>there are only so many possible structures, so that there are no competing <br>"better" choices for producing an effect, and so a particular stucture will <br>win out. <br><br>In unlimited JI, being an infinite pitch set (infinite yet not<br>containing all intervals of course), relative dissonance or <br>consonance is based directly on the tuning so this ability to "choose <br>the lesser of two evils" in creating associations doesn't exist in the <br>same way. <br><br>In JI there are many many more-consonant and more-pleasant structures <br>than the various approximations of a 12tet Major 6 9 chord.<br><br>When people put up examples like this to show me that there's a problem<br>in JI because, say, a Major 6 9 chord is dissonant in JI, I note that<br>the problem is in trying to transfer a structure that means something <br>in another tuning system into JI and expecting JI's various approximations<br>of this structure to mean the same thing (have the same association,<br>especially as compared to other structures available in the system). <br><br>What I meant by "suggest itself musically" is to play around with<br>the resources in JI (improvise, if you will, on paper or in real time)<br>to find out what's there, and see what kinds of consonance-dissonance<br>relations can be found, and what kinds of associations spring up,<br>and to use these musically--rather than improvise in 12tet and then<br>try to translate it into JI. To me, a Major 6 9 chord doesn't<br>"suggest itself musically" in JI, the way it does in 12tet. Other<br>structures do "suggest themselves musically".<br><br>> >1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 [...] starts to support its own dissonance in a<br>> really nice way since<br>> >each little otonal 8:9:10 subset resonates on its own even with the 40/27's<br>> >and stuff going on between them, at least to my ear.<br>> <br>> Yeah, but try the utonal version of this chord -- blech! <br><br>I can't hear it in my head, but I'll bet you're right. I tend n<br>ot to "believe in" utonal structures at this point in my exploring. <br>I mean, I can use them and hear them, just as I can hear and use <br>stacks of various arbitrary intervals, but utonality doesn't seem <br>to have the same self-organizing "pull" that otonality has even <br>though the math would suggest it. I reserve the right to alter my <br>position.<br><br>> Polytonality is<br>> much easier to establish with otonal than with utonal units, as every early<br>> 20th century composer knew. <br><br>This is probably because otonality is easier to establish period! The <br>difference tones in otonality tend to support the same otonality. The <br>difference tones in utonality tend to disrupt the utonality by producing <br>difference tones which would support an otonality instead. <br> <br>Summation tones would tend to support utonality, but I lean <br>towards the camp that holds that these are rarely heard and<br>are practically unimportant in the natural hearing process.<br><br>I've even read that difference tones may be generated internally,<br>as part of the hearing process itself, so that even listening to<br>two sine waves in head phones at low levels, we do some <br>"otonal"-style internal processing.<br><br>After once reading mail from Marshal Tuttle on the Fidonet <br>Comp 101 echo (BTW, does anyone know how to access Fidonet via <br>internet?) who said that string players tend to tune major thirds as <br>pythagorean (81/64) and minor chords 12tet (300 cents), I wanted <br>to see what JI interval a 12tet minor third is close to. It turns <br>out to be a close match with 19/16 at 297.5 cents; roughly the <br>same error as a 3/2 receives in 12tet. Compare this to the generally <br>accepted standard JI minor third 6/5 at 315.6 cents. The first-order <br>difference tones for 16:19:24 are 3:5:8, making it possible that these <br>string players are intuitively aiming for an otonal, not utonal, minor <br>chord!<br><br>> Or you can see this chord as a<br>> 24:27:30:32:36:40, whose first-order difference tones form a<br>> 2:3:4:5:6:8:9:10:12:13 chord . . .<br><br>Neat. It would probably work well in the high register, to bring this out.<br><br>Matt Nathan<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 7 Feb 1997 05:03 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14256; Fri, 7 Feb 1997 05:02:59 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA28594<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id UAA24653; Thu, 6 Feb 1997 20:01:19 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 6 Feb 1997 20:01:19 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.155309@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4747 href="#4747">ðŸ”—</a>Matt Nathan &#x3C;mattn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/1997 9:10:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Charles Lucy wrote:<br><br>> *<br>> When I touch a guitar string gently at specific points, I can hear<br>> tones which are "higher" than the open string or the fretted string.<br>> *<br><br>> Probably everyone on this list has read Helmholtz, most have also<br>> prolly read Baccus (God of Whine?).
