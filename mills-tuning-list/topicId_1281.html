Nearly all of his comments to citations show that he<br>has never aquired the ability to read a text for its overt semantic<br>content, let alone is he in possession of the critical reading or writing<br>skills that might allow him to form cogent opinions of more complicated<br>tropes and put them down on paper or disk. His incapacity to read and argue<br>within an aesthetic context  is a fine advertisement for the poverty of his<br>own education. And his continued attacks upon educational institutions<br>simply illustrate his  total lack of familiarity with the variety of what<br>may go on within them. Do him a favor: file his columns away someplace and<br>save him from further public self-demolition and us from further<br>embarrassing display of such wasted potential.<br><br>John Cageï¿½s music and texts deserve serious critical attention, but it is<br>certainly not to be found in MacLarenï¿½s rantings. I recommend highly the<br>writings of William Brooks (in the John Cage Reader, Peters Edition),<br>Stefan Schaedler (in the _MusikKonzepte_ second volume on Cage), and by<br>Schaedler, Eric de Visscher, and Walter Zimmermann (in John Cage: Anarchic<br>Harmony, from Schott).  My own articles in _MusikTexte_ on the Cage*s late<br>view  of _Harmony_, and in the Schott volume, may also be of some interest.<br><br>Daniel Wolf, Frankfurt<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 29 Nov 1996 19:50 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11951; Fri, 29 Nov 1996 19:51:42 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12033<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id KAA13519; Fri, 29 Nov 1996 10:51:40 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 29 Nov 1996 10:51:40 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3.0.32.19961129104616.00688fa8@adnc.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
