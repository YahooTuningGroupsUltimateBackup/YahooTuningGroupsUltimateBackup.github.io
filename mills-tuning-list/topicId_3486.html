I mentioned <br>period tripling in maps of the real interval- all the cases that I know of <br>are discontinuous and rather contrived, and probably don't apply to music.<br>	<br>	Musically speaking, we have a driven pendulum experiment whose <br>angular position is determined by decoding square wave pulses from an <br>optical shaft encoder. In addition to decoding the absolute position, I <br>also feed the output to a speaker. The angular velocity of the pendulum <br>manifests itself as a pitch, and the bifurcations of the system are <br>heard as subtle changes in melody. I am trying to get my student to hear <br>these subtleties so he can recognize when something interesting is <br>happening by sound alone as we sweep through parameter space. You really can <br>distinguish very small pitch changes when the bifurcations take place.<br><br>John Starrett <br>http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</div>
