This includes detailed<br>descriptions of four proposals on how our current system of twelve note<br>equal temperament can be expanded to a greater number of notes per octave,<br>and on what sort of instruments music composed in such new tunings may be<br>performed. Further, this study demonstrates how these new intonations can<br>be accurately notated. None of these four theories is in itself complete or<br>foolproof. The reader must compare, edit, synthesize, and redefine these<br>ideas. The development of a personal thesis allows one to fill in a more<br>complete description of the process of composition with microtones. Thus,<br>the goal of this study is to provide the reader with the necessary<br>information which would allow the informed selection of those elements<br>needed to begin the development of a process of composing in an expanded<br>tonality.<br>        This paper is organized as follows: Part 1-Tuning Systems. Two<br>systems of extended just intonation and two systems of extended equal<br>temperament are described and evaluated; Part 2-Instruments. Many new<br>instruments have been constructed as well as modification or adaptation of<br>traditional instruments have taken place in order to accommodate various<br>extended tonalities. Four different approaches are examined; Part<br>3-Notation. Four proposed systems for notating a more discrete tonality<br>than 12-note equal are evaluated;  Part 4-Conclusions. These four major<br>sections are followed by a glossary of microtonal terms and a bibliography.<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 25 Jan 1996 20:19 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA10933; Thu, 25 Jan 1996 11:19:29 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 25 Jan 1996 11:19:29 -0800<br>Message-Id:  <9601251116.aa21978@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
