Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com><br>> <br>> The VFX-SD has something like 100 basic waveforms, and while some are<br>> sample-based, some are purely synthetic (you've got all your standard<br>> waveforms here). The Yamaha's synthetic waveforms are interesting but<br>> could hardly be said to represent more of a "synthesis from scratch"<br>> philosophy than the VFX.<br><br>Paul, you must be confusing the SY77/SY99 with some other Yamaha SY synths.<br> Not all of them were FM based, some were wavetable only like the VFX.  Any<br>wavetable synth is timbrally quantized.  They're limited to filtering and<br>mixing of the prerecorded timbres, while FM synthesis creates harmonically<br>rich spectra by frequency modulation of sine or more complex waves.<br><br>John Loffink<br>jloffink@pdq.net</div>
