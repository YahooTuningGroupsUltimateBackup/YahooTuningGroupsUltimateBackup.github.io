Mark<br>Lindley's articles in _Early Music_ in the mid 70's were probably the<br>turning point - after that, basically no self-respecting early keyboardis=<br>t<br>would be caught dead tuning in ET. Not only baroque but classical<br>repertoire can be found played in arguably appropriate temperaments. Most=<br><br>harpsichordists can tune themselves, setting their own mean- and<br>well-temperaments, and the vast majority of new tracker organs are built =<br>in<br>historical tunings, often with split keys (the composer Douglas Leedy has=<br><br>made a specialty of being commissioned to write new pieces inaugurating n=<br>ew<br>instruments in old temperaments). =<br><br><br>In fact, if I really wanted to find an 12TET recording of the 48, I would=<br><br>probably have to go to piano recordings (of which Gould's are so<br>satisfyingly articulated that you - almost - forget the tuning) or to now=<br><br>historical harpsichord performances from the Landowska-Kirkpatrick era. =<br><br><br>We have been through this discussion so thoroughly before that I figure<br>that I have gone full circle with the tuning list. So, I'll sign off for =<br>a<br>while with a suggestion that new subscribers should spend some time with<br>the list archives. =<br><br><br>Daniel Wolf<br><br><br>DR DANIEL WOLF / MATERIAL PRESS / FRANKFURT-AM-MAIN<br>http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/DJWOLF_MATERIAL/mphome.htm =<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Erik Nauman <ENauman@TrevorDaySchool.pvt.k12.ny.us><br>Subject:  Hammer Strings<br>PostedDate:  03-12-97 23:13:03<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  03-12-97 23:11:23-03-12-97 23:11:24,03-12-97 23:11:17-03-12-97 23:11:17<br>DeliveredDate:  03-12-97 23:11:17<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256562.0079E036; Wed, 3 Dec 1997 23:11:12 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05480; Wed, 3 Dec 1997 23:13:03 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 3 Dec 1997 23:13:03 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05476<br>Received: (qmail 2390 invoked from network); 3 Dec 1997 14:12:54 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 3 Dec 1997 14:12:54 -0800<br>Message-Id: <c=US%a=_%p=Trevor_Day_Schoo%l=EX1-971203220444Z-8017@ex1.trevordayschool.pvt.k12.ny.us><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
