A study of the instructions for=0A=0Atuning given in the p=<br>resent book (by A. J. Ellis who invented the cent=0A=0Ameasurement)  for =<br>the years through 1885 verifies that essential=0A=0Aacoustical informatio=<br>n for tuning equal temperament was lacking.  This=0A=0Awas one reason for=<br> the 19th century tuners=92 inability to tune equal=0A=0Atemperament by e=<br>ar.  Other deviation was due to the basic concepts of=0A=0Atuning then in=<br> vogue.  19th century tuning by ear was a highly developed=0A=0Aart based=<br> on aesthetic judgments for every tone, and test chords were=0A=0Aused mo=<br>re than test intervals.  By contrast, 20th century tuning is a=0A=0Amathe=<br>matical skill."=0A     My own experience bears this well.

If a given<br>>melody has one of its members altered by less than this limen, the<br>>melody may well be heard as vaguely different, but there will be _no_<br>>fundamental change in melody.<br><br>   I agree about half-way with Gregg here.  I agree in that I have found<br>that melody maintains its recognizability through what might seem on the<br>surface to be extreme manipulation.  That fact is also born out by melodic<br>variation and inversion.  To that end I have found that differences in<br>12-toned temperaments, or even 5-limit diatonic JI, produce effects that<br>are subtle in comparison to the full gamut of new-tuning possibilities.<br><br>   So, speaking for my own personal new-tuning interests, I find the more<br>radically nontraditional tunings to be much more interesting.  Tunings that<br>have no recognizable representation of a major scale, for example, seem to<br>me to provide vastly more exciting possibilities.  Of course that's a<br>matter of personal opinion and interpretation.<br><br>   Now, speaking of interpretations, I interpret Gregg to say that<br>differences in 12-toned diatonic tunings, such as would occur between<br>12TET, a Werckmeister well temperament, QC meantone, and Ptolemaic JI to be<br>(realistically speaking) so subtle as to be musically insignificant.  I<br>definitely can't agree with that.  They are more subtle than, oh ...<br>quartertones for example, but I have performed or participated in many<br>studies of one sort or another to show that those subtle differences are<br>indeed musically interesting.  One example is the comparison of JI and<br>LucyTuning I described to you tuning listers something like a couple years<br>ago.<br><br>   There is also another very important counterexample to Gregg's belief<br>here, again assuming that I understood it correctly.  That counterexample<br>is microtonal steps - e.g., 41sts of an octave, in a melody.  Clearly a<br>melody that uses melodic steps smaller than Gregg's 60-cent limen can't<br>possibly be rendered faithfully in a tuning with 12 tones per octave.  If<br>anybody doesn't buy that, I recommend picking up a copy of Neil<br>Haverstick's new CD.  It has plenty of examples of great melodies whose<br>meaning and even recognizability would be significantly impaired by<br>attempting them in 12's comparatively crude tuning resolution.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Re: Harvard's Just<br>PostedDate:  15-12-97 03:08:53<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  15-12-97 03:06:52-15-12-97 03:06:52,15-12-97 03:06:33-15-12-97 03:06:33<br>DeliveredDate:  15-12-97 03:06:33<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656E.000B9C3C; Mon, 15 Dec 1997 03:08:45 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA15386; Mon, 15 Dec 1997 03:08:53 +0100<br>Date: Mon, 15 Dec 1997 03:08:53 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA15389<br>Received: (qmail 9648 invoked from network); 14 Dec 1997 18:08:46 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 14 Dec 1997 18:08:46 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541102b0b9942704a9@[207.207.2.47]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
