I've had a few<br>insights lately that may be of interest. For one, blues has been my root<br>for 30 years, and this is a very fortunate thing, I feel; I was playing<br>"microtonally" for years, and never knew it...it was done intuitively.<br>Now, I can intellectualize it a bit better, but it doesn't really change<br>what I am already doing..it only deepens it, by allowing me to explore<br>other systems, and the new opportunities they afford me.<br>    I believe blues is totally connected to Indian, Arabic, and modal<br>musics all around the world, and this has given me the tools to better<br>understand just what tunings are all about, anyway. For example, since<br>equal temps were developed to play chordal music, it's obvious that,<br>since most all music was originally modal, equal temps were not NEEDED,<br>since there was no modulation happening. Thus, to say that Asian and<br>Eastern systems use eq temp doesn't make much sense (unless, of course,<br>we understand that since the "West" pretty much dominated the whole world<br>through colonialism, they also brought THEIR musical ideas everywhere<br>they went; this is the reason why we may find these truly ancient musical<br>systems perhaps flirting with eq these days). But, I do not believe that<br>Indian music originally intended to use only 12 notes; and however<br>many there were, they sure as hell were not equally spaced. That concept<br>goes against the whole CONCEPT of what modally derived music is all<br>about. It's no big secret that European based harmonic music is fairly<br>recent compared to such ancient forms such as Indian ragas.<br>    In fact, I believe that there are an infinity of notes within the<br>continuum of tones generated from the harmonic series. I also feel that<br>some great musicians throughout time have been able to accurately locate<br>and play perhaps hundreds of teensy intervals and pitches...I see no<br>reason why this could not be so. To say that this could not happen, I<br>feel, robs us of the greatness of the human spirit. To try and limit<br>music to a fixed number of tones, pure or tempered, is not even part of<br>my concept of music. I think big, and greatly admire those who achieve<br>the awesome.<br>    The Creator gave us the mystery of the Harmonic Series...he/she did<br>NOT tell us how to use it. There's a lot of room, in the vastness of<br>music, for individuality, and creative expression. Remember, theory only<br>describes that which can only be experienced directly...ratios do not<br>describe sadness, joy, anger, heroism, or the infinity of human<br>experience that the actual sound of music expresses. I dearly enjoy<br>hearing novel approaches to this infinity. Theory is an honorable study,<br>to be sure, but the SOUND came first. Most great spiritual teachings<br>speak of the infinite power of sound, and have great respect for it.<br>    To me, it's no big secret what the great Indian and Arabic (and<br>other) masters of music do...they play the intervals that create deep and<br>profound states of consciousness. I don't think they limit themselves to<br>12 or 19 or 31 or 53 notes...they try to hit the right spot in the<br>continuum to say what must be said. Then, the theorists spend years<br>trying to explain what happened...and that's ok, but it isn't IT. And, I<br>believe that many of these masters are keeping pretty quiet about the<br>secrets of tunings because they are concerned about the misuse of this<br>knowledge. It's no accident that there are very few written words from<br>the great practitioners of Indian music on the true nature of ratios and<br>their deep meanings.<br>    To endlessly talk of beats and waves and ratios can get a bit<br>wearying...and, to try and say one tuning is "THE TUNING" is no different<br>than trying to say one style of music is superior to all others. Of<br>course, it surprises me not that some folks do try to assert dominance in<br>this fashion. In fact, that attitude is definitely a big part of the<br>European way of life, but it's old and stinky. I call it musical racism,<br>and it is very ugly to me. I say let's play with the great resources<br>we've been given, and try to do something wonderful with them. Let's<br>don't try and limit the myriad ways in which we can create with the<br>zillions of sounds and frequencies all around us...even the ones we can't<br>"hear" (because even these exist, and may have musical uses that we<br>cannot yet understand). Bickering and pettyness are a waste of<br>time...maybe the forum needs to get on with more important<br>issues...Hstick<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  22-tone Equal and the Genera<br>PostedDate:  20-12-97 10:23:50<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  20-12-97 10:21:46-20-12-97 10:21:47,20-12-97 10:21:22-20-12-97 10:21:22<br>DeliveredDate:  20-12-97 10:21:22<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256573.00336BC2; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 10:23:35 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22583; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 10:23:50 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 20 Dec 1997 10:23:50 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22548<br>Received: (qmail 17904 invoked from network); 20 Dec 1997 01:23:46 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 20 Dec 1997 01:23:46 -0800<br>Message-Id: <349BF0DB.2F7F@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
