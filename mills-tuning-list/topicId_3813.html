Funky, varied, earthy, <br>and a great variety of sounds...this stuff ain't watered down. Covers <br>lutes, reeds, percussion, strings, and vocals...wonderful.<br><br>Song of the Banyan, Folk Music of Vietnam (Music of the World)...one of <br>the loveliest albums I have heard in years...this music is delicate but <br>strong, like a spider's web. The tunings are subtle, and give the music a <br>haunting quality...get it.<br><br>Wu Man and Ensemble; Chinese traditional and contemporary music <br>(Nimbus)...ye Gods, but Wu Man is a monster musician. An astonishing pipa <br>player, she has jaw dropping chops, but also great musicality...moves <br>from ancient themes to the most avant Chinese compositions around. I <br>imagine the pipa is in 12 equal, but didn't Chinese music start with a <br>circle of 5ths based 5 tone scale? This woman is a genius...<br> <br>Ali Akbar Khan; AMMP Signature Series (AMMP)...another jaw dropper, this <br>man is probably one of the most advanced musicians on the earth. Said in <br>his book that he would play 23 and 1/2 srutis if he felt like it...<br><br>Masters of Turkish Music (Rounder)...another survey, encompassing the <br>years 1906-1949. A very passionate bunch, the Turks; many different moods <br>and expressions here.<br><br>Erkan Ogur; Fretless (Feuer und Eis)...Erkan is a monster guitarist, <br>again Turkish, who played in the Midwest for a while with a stone blues <br>guy...said the Turkish system worked fine with blues. Says there's 53 <br>komas in the Turkish system...he has chops to spare, but makes really <br>profound, deep music...I want to get him for Microstock.<br><br>Forbidden Planet (GNP Crescendo)...the mother of space music soundtracks.<br>The Musician's Union wouldn't let them call it music on the film's <br>credits, so it was called electronic tonalities instead...a masterpiece, <br>and timeless.<br><br>Howlin' Wolf; His Best (Chess)...I've been listening to Wolf for almost <br>30 years, and his music still gives me chills. Deep, dark, joyful, and <br>microtonal as anything...Hubert Sumlin, his guitarist, was a big <br>influence on many rock players, from Clapton to Hendrix...how I wish Wolf <br>was still here.<br><br>Kazuhito Yamashita; JS Bach's Solo Violin Sonatas and Partitas (Crown <br>Classics)...by far the greatest interpreter of Bach I've ever heard. <br>Technical skills beyond imagination, and soul to spare...he recorded <br>these when he was only 28; holy shit, indeed (he plays guitar).<br><br>I have also been rediscovering some of my rock favorites from my early, <br>pre microtonal, years, including the Yardbirds (Roger the Engineer), Pink <br>Floyd (Ummagumma), Deep Purple (Book of Taliesyn), Captain Beefheart <br>(Trout Mask Replica), and a few others...these guys were young and wild, <br>and very very creative, setting the stage for much of what later became <br>metal, punk, Gothic rock, and much of pop/rock in general. Although <br>working with 12 eq instruments, the music transcends this tuning because <br>of the ideas expressed...it's some great stuff...Hstick  PS...oops, <br>almost forgot White Elephants and Golden Ducks; Musical Treasures from <br>Burma (Shanachie)...yikes, what a strange and delightful set...these guys <br>use traditional Burmese instruments, mixed with piano and slide guitar, <br>of all things. This is some of the most unique Asian music I've ever <br>heard...one tune reminds me a lot of King Crimson's 21st Century Schizoid <br>Man, of all things...HHH</div>
