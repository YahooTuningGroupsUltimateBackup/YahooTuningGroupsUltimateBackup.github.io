I <br>don't know if this is because people on this forum are all too familiar <br>with the psychological research in music or maybe just not interested.  <br>Perhaps the discussion belongs in a different forum.  But for anyone <br>interested in and unfamiliar with it, much of the research in the field <br>of music/psychology seems very relevant to the discussions on this <br>forum.  Some areas of research include (found through the internet) <br>cognitive organization, music perception/cognition, pitch perception, <br>perception of simple combinations of notes, cognition of musical form, <br>roughness of chords, musical minds/musical ears, social psycholgy and <br>music, teaching/learning, training, practice, composition, sight reading, <br>eye movements in sight reading, auditory representation in sight reading, <br>to name a few.  There are numerous sites on the internet including the <br>Society for Research in Psychology of Music and Music Education (SRPMME) <br>and Music Perception.<br><br>Brian Carlson<br>Denver, Colorado<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 30 Apr 1997 07:36 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00832; Wed, 30 Apr 1997 07:36:54 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01021<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id WAA01958; Tue, 29 Apr 1997 22:35:20 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 29 Apr 1997 22:35:20 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199704300531.WAA13311@sunatg3><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5368 href="#5368">ðŸ”—</a>Brian Belet &#x3C;BBELET@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/1997 11:32:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Tue, 29 Apr 1997 22:35:56 -0700 James Kukula said:<br>>The May 1997 issue of IEEE Spectrum has an article "Power electronics'<br>>polluting effects", by R.
