This very<br>entertaining and informative flame-war between Jon and Johnny is starting to<br>crowd out discussions of the subject in general.  Certainly Harry himself<br>would say that he's not the first person who ever did tuning, merely<br>following a very ancient and venerable tradition.<br><br>He's certainly not the last either.  This almost religious concern about<br>what Harry might or might not have wanted is fine for people wanting to<br>reproduce and sustain the body of work created by this amazing person.<br>However, what about living people making Just and N-ET music?   What about<br>current tuning theory and musical applications of same?  Who is Partch's<br>heir?   I guess in a sense we are.  I'd be curious to hear about where<br>Partch's theories have been taken and if any extensions have been made to<br>them, or any new music has been made using them.  Other Music is one group<br>that comes to mind.  Newband is another.<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 23 Aug 1996 17:16 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29837; Fri, 23 Aug 1996 17:17:01 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29867<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA16219; Fri, 23 Aug 1996 08:16:58 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 23 Aug 1996 08:16:58 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.93.960823111049.18234A-100000@freenet2.afn.org><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3464 href="#3464">ðŸ”—</a>World Harmony Project &#x3C;sejic@...&#x3E;</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ARCHIVES OF THE SOUTHEAST JUST INTONATION CENTER</div>
