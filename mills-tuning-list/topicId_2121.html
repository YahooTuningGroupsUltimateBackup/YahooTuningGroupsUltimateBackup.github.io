I say that by no means because I don't like JI, or don't use<br>it, but because I don't use it exclusively.  I have mostly experimented<br>with octave-repeating harmonic- and subharmonic-series fragments, but my<br>current fascination with a nonoctave equal temperament.<br><br>   So with that background, I'll briefly (re)state my opinion on to what<br>degree temperament constitutes unnecessary dissonance pollution.<br><br>   In summary, I personally agree with that idea up to the degree that JI<br>ratios are the essential reference points for harmony.  I disagree beyond<br>there though.  I disagree both from the perspective of the words<br>"unnecessary" and "pollution", and also from the perspective of the roles<br>of melody and harmony.<br><br>   From the "unnecessary" perspective, using the analogy I've stated<br>before, I have no doubt that JI ratios represent the navigational bouys in<br>pitch space, but we don't have to jump heroically between the 5:4 and 4:3<br>bouy panic-stricken that we might fall into the waters between.  The waters<br>between 5:4 and 4:3 are every bit as interesting too, and the only way to<br>explore them is to take off our JI tuxedos, put on our swimsuits, and dive<br>in headfirst!  But again, I have no doubt that our ears will characterize<br>the the waters between those two bouys as "five cents sharp of 5:4", or<br>halfway between.<br><br>   From the pollution perspective, as I mentioned above, I don't see "off"<br>versions of JI-defined intervals as fundamentally undesirable.  12TET's<br>sharp approximation to 5:4 has a very distinctive "YOW!" sensation to it,<br>and that can be useful musically.  For one thing, it makes the third in a<br>block chord stand out more, where quarter-comma meantone in that same major<br>chord will call attention to the fifth.<br><br>   Still, there can be no doubt that that's a matter of degree, depending<br>upon not only how far off, but also upon the "basicness" of interval being,<br>and the overtone structure of the timbre in which its realized.  It's hard<br>to deny, for example, that off octaves are more panic-striking than<br>equally-off major thirds.<br><br>   Finally, I think it's apparent that the question is different from<br>perspective of harmony vs. melody.  A C-major-scale fragment tuned to the<br>traditional 1:1 9:8 5:4 4:3 3:2, playing the repeated melodic fragment C D<br>E F G F E D C... has a very different effect when played against a C drone<br>or not.  With the drone, the cleanliness of the harmony demands a lot of<br>attention, but without the drone, it's the comparatively large between C<br>and D can feel disconcerting (especially so in the descending sequence, to<br>my ears).  I'm not suggesting that that disconcerting feeling is<br>necessarily undesirable;  just that that's how it can sound.<br><br>Received: from alpha255 [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 6 Jun 1997 05:25 +0200<br>Received: by alpha255; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04064; Fri, 6 Jun 1997 05:25:28 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 6 Jun 1997 05:25:28 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by alpha255 (smtpxd); id XA04059<br>Received: (qmail 27935 invoked from network); 6 Jun 1997 03:17:53 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 6 Jun 1997 03:17:53 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199706060313.UAA09610@dnai.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
