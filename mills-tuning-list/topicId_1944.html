(But no, it doesn't generate<br>tones.)<br><br>Features: this spreadsheet is designed to be both objective and subjective<br>in temperament analysis.  The objective part: it makes complete beat rate<br>charts for all thirds, fourth, fifths, sixths, and sevenths (including 7/6<br>minor thirds and several types of minor sevenths) showing how far sharp or<br>flat of pure (simple integer ratio) the interval is in the programmed<br>temperament.  It also converts everything to both cents and Hz, and<br>arranges its analyses both chromatically and in a circle of fifths.  Then,<br>getting to the subjective part, I've tried to come up with formulas of<br>subjective tolerability of the minor and major thirds and sevenths, and<br>the fourths and fifths.  The triads and seventh-chords on all scale<br>degrees get analyzed for usability, tension, etc., and displayed in<br>tables.  These subjective formulas are based on my own tuning experience<br>with many temperaments over the years, and reading historical and modern<br>sources about what the ear finds tolerable (so it's not *completely*<br>arbitrary!).  The formulas automatically choose the nearest simple ratio<br>(for instance, choosing between the 9/5 and 7/4 minor sevenths, or the 6/5<br>and 7/6 minor thirds), then look at the beat rates.<br><br>The upshot of all this is that simply entering a temperament recipe in one<br>place yields beat charts for actually setting it (from either a C or an A<br>fork of any specified frequency), and charts that show which keys are the<br>best/worst to play in, and how the ear might take it on all scale degrees<br>of those keys.  For example, in a well temperament, it's easy to see how<br>modulation around the circle of fifths increases/decreases tension in the<br>triads and sevenths.  And in 1/4 comma meantone, the Bb-D-F-G# chord shows<br>up sounding like an almost pure dominant seventh (that low pseudo-Ab and<br>all).  The spreadsheet makes these features obvious without requiring one<br>to go set the temperament first on an instrument...it could also help in<br>planning an effective overall temperament for a recital, given the keys<br>and modulatory depth of the pieces to be played.<br><br>Temperaments are specified with superscript comma adjustments plus or<br>minus, the familiar way the old Barbour book did it.  My old Quattro<br>version had about 70 temperaments in it, including (I think) all the<br>Barbour ones, some of Jorgensen's, plus others I made up as "what-if"<br>scenarios.  I don't remember how many I've converted to the new Excel<br>version, but in any case it's easy to enter new ones...takes only about a<br>minute or two once ye get the hang of it.  Twelve notes per octave, and it<br>determines automatically what the enharmonic name of a note is based on<br>the superscript value.<br><br>The parameters are:  start from either an A or C fork; frequency of that<br>fork; temperament name; tuning recipe in fractions of commas; which<br>comma is used; which temperament in the recipe library to display (index<br>number).  Everything else is derived.  It's also easy to change the<br>subjective formulas that analyze triads and seventh chords.<br><br>V1.1 has several more temperaments in its library, and displays four<br>more beat-rate intervals (such as the 7/4 minor seventh that a<br>meantone Bb-G# almost is). <br><br>   http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/temper.html<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Bradley Lehman, bpl@umich.edu       http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 12 Apr 1997 23:25 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00411; Sat, 12 Apr 1997 23:25:38 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00409<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id OAA05668; Sat, 12 Apr 1997 14:23:42 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 12 Apr 1997 14:23:42 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.95.970412170340.29509A-100000@u2.farm.idt.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
