In<br>addition, it has the best freeway system of any city I've<br>known, so gridlock is not bad (only a little, at rush hours).<br><br>I haven't gotten the chance to visit the LA microtonalists<br>yet, but it certainly does seem to me that there's a very<br>active bunch of us here in San Diego.  There hasn't been a<br>strong focal center for them since Ivor Darreg died, until<br>now -- that's what we're working to create at Sonic Arts.<br><br>Bill Alves, however, made some very salient points.  Although<br>we are glad to offer our resources at Sonic Arts, it has nowhere<br>near the facilities that a college can offer, and that's important<br>if this is going to happen on as large a scale as it looks like<br>it might.  Perhaps I can talk to my connections at UCSD, but<br>I'd go with Bill's college.<br><br>And as for a special dinner, I'd like to add that some of the<br>most enjoyable and most informative aspects to attending Johnny<br>Reinhard's AFMM festivals in New York were the "post mortems"<br>(as Wendy Carlos called them), where a fairly large group of<br>us went to dinner after the concerts and talked tuning-ese.<br><br>- Joe Monzo<br>  monz@juno.com<br>  http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html<br><br>___________________________________________________________________<br>You don't need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html<br>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</div>
