I asked if he knew what layers<br>are about.  Here was his reply followed by my reply to that:<br><br><br><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br><br>>Well, yes, of course, I know what a layer is, but why only 4?<br><br>   Good.<br><br>   The 4 is because there are two patch-select buttons over by the<br>pitch-bend and mod wheels, and there are four possible combinations of two<br>on-off switches like that.<br><br>   To use them to select layers, and thereby tuning tables, go over to the<br>Edit:Instrument page, then punch the back-arrow button until you get to a<br>page that looks like "OO PATCH=" followed by a bunch of numbers or dashes.<br><br>   A patch is a combination of layers playing at the same time, and with<br>this page you can choose which patches play with each up-down combination<br>of the patch-select buttons.<br><br>   If, for example, you want:<br>- Layer 1 (only) to play when you have both patch-select buttons<br>  released,<br>- Layer 2 (only) when you press the right patch-select button but<br>  not the left,<br>- Layer 3 (only) when you press the left patch-select button but<br>  not the right,<br>- Layer 4 (only) when you press both the left and right patch-<br>  select buttons.<br>To set this up, move the cursor with the right- and left-arrow buttons in<br>this "OO PATCH=" display until it's directly to the right of the "=".  If<br>you push the up-arrow button at there, a 1 will pop up next to the "=".<br>That means that layer 1 will play when you have neither patch-select button<br>depressed.  If there are any other numbers to the right of that 1, then<br>move the cursor over to them and press the down-arrow button, which will<br>turn off those layers.<br><br>   To turn on layer 2 for the right-button-only patch, press the right<br>patch-select button, and hold it down.  You will notice that the display<br>changes to "O* PATCH=" followed by numbers or dashes.  The "*" means that<br>that patch-select button (the right one) is down, and the "O" means that<br>that button (the left button) is up (i.e., not depressed).  The numbers in<br>that display the layers that will play when you have that combination.<br>Turn layer 2 on in the same way as you turned layer 1 on for the "OO"<br>patch, and turn the rest off.  You have to hold the right patch-button down<br>throughout that entire operation.<br><br>   You can then set the "*O" and "**" patches similarly.<br><br>   To make the ASR play different tunings, or tuning subsets, in each of<br>those layers, you can get one of the layers to sound right, and then do a<br>Command:Layer:Copy Layer command to create layers 2, 3, and 4 as duplicates<br>of layer 1.  Be sure to use the "Params Only" option, since that will avoid<br>copying the sample data itself, which hogs a lot of memory.<br><br>   You then select each layer one by one, and do an Edit:Layer on it, and<br>cursor over to the "PITCH TBL=" (I think that's how it reads anyway) page.<br>You can use the up- and down-arrow keys to select a pitch table for that<br>layer.  That then will give you a different pitch table for each of four<br>otherwise identical-sounding patch-button selections.</div>
