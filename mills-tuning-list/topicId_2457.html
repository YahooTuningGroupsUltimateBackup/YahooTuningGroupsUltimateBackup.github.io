Six people contributed to original spec.  A preliminary<br>>version was published in Computer Music Journal with a request for<br>>comments.  One comment was received.<br><br>I saw the preliminary version in 1/1 and Computer Music Journal.  At<br>the time, I did not see the weaknesses in the spec.  I was working<br>with keyboards with full keyboard tuning tables (EPS and TX81Z).  I<br>was using fixed just intonation scales without any real modulation,<br>apparently just like the creators of the spec.  For these purposes,<br>it works just fine.<br><br>>>The greatest limitation is the insistance on handling tuning dumps<br>>>only on a full keyboard basis.  This makes dynamic tuning programs<br>>>like Justonic's almost impossible as the MIDI bandwidth can't<br>>>support real-time updates.<br><br>>But the spec says that the full keyboard "non-real-time" dump isn't<br>>intended for performance.  Instead, there's an additional 12-byte<br>>"real-time" message for retuning any individual note on the fly.<br><br>>I don't know exactly what Justonic is doing, but I can't imagine why it<br>>would need more than these 12 bytes per note-on.  The synthesizer<br>>doesn't need to know the entire tuning table, it just needs to get<br>>up-to-date frequency data for sounding notes from its host.<br><br>A MIDI byte takes 320 microseconds to transmit.  Let's say you have<br>a fairly dense arrangement with 20 notes on 10 MIDI channels sounding<br>as you modulate to another tonic.  It takes, not counting the actual<br>note ons, 320 us per byte x 12 bytes per message x 20 sysex messages =<br>76.8 milliseconds to send the updated tunings to the various<br>instruments.  This is clearly not adequate.  It is also very painful<br>to insert these individual sysex messages in a general purpose<br>sequencer unless you modulate or change scales only infrequently.<br><br>A sysex octave tuning table is generally around 30-42 bytes long.<br>Sending 320 us per byte x 36 bytes per message x 10 MIDI channels =<br>115.2 milliseconds.  Well, that's even worse, unless you're using<br>just 2-3 synthesizers with global rather than channelized tuning<br>scales.<br><br>Since the MIDI bandwidth limitation is the problem, the obvious<br>solution for now is to preprogram the modulations into the synthe-<br>sizer tuning tables and select the tables over MIDI sysex.  This<br>works well with instruments like the DX7IIFD and TX802 which can<br>store 64 tables, or the K2000 and K2500 which can store 255 tables.<br>It does not work well with programs like Justonic that don't<br>presume to know where you will modulate to in advance.  Justonic<br>uses just one of the preprogrammed scales for all of its<br>modulations.<br><br>>>The other problem is the immediate updating of sustained notes.<br>>>This is also a problem for real-time key modulations, especially<br>>>for rapid paced music.<br><br>>To quote from the spec:<br><br>>"There is some question as to whether instantaneous response to<br>>real-time tuning changes is desirable in every circumstance. In some<br>>performance situations it makes more sense if a tuning change affect<br>>only those notes which occur subsequent to the change, and not affect<br>>sounding notes. But there are also situations in which tuning changes<br>>should take place instantaneously, as specified in the standard, and<br>>should affect sounding notes without disrupting their continuity.<br><br>>"If the instrument responds well in the latter situation, some<br>>workaround is possible for the former. The reverse is not true.<br>>Therefore the standard requires that tuning changes immediately affect<br>>sounding notes. Manufacturers might, however, consider implementing a<br>>switchable instantaneous/next-note-on option within an instrument."<br><br>>I still think this is sound.  An example of when immediate response by<br>>sounding notes might be desired: glissando of a tone to keep a fixed<br>>tonic during certain modulations.<br><br>I haven't figured out what the workaround is to next-note-on type<br>compositions with an instrument that supports only instantaneous<br>retuning.  Perhaps you could explain further?  If I want sustaining<br>notes to hold their current tuning while sounding new notes in a<br>new scale, what are my options?  If it's back to the individual sysex<br>messages per note, I'll need some MIDI Draino to unclog the limited<br>bandwidth.:-)<br><br>John Loffink<br><br><br><br> <br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Carter Scholz <csz@well.com><br>Subject:  Re: Tuning 1193<br>PostedDate:  30-09-97 05:41:51<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  30-09-97 05:41:28-30-09-97 05:41:29,30-09-97 05:40:26-30-09-97 05:40:26<br>DeliveredDate:  30-09-97 05:40:26<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256522.001443F8; Tue, 30 Sep 1997 05:41:21 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02085; Tue, 30 Sep 1997 05:41:51 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 30 Sep 1997 05:41:51 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02090<br>Received: (qmail 21753 invoked from network); 29 Sep 1997 20:41:48 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 29 Sep 1997 20:41:48 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199709300340.UAA05772@well.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
