The ratios within each octave for this tuning are 7:7, 8:7, 9:7, 10:7,<br>11:7, 12:7, 13:7, and 14:7, obvious 7:7 being the unison and 14:7 being the<br>octave.  <br><br>   This is a tuning I've played with before, and I thought that Bill would very<br>good at using it in the way that I concluded would be best, after I used it in a<br>way I concluded to be less than ideal.  <br><br>   Bill tuned it up on his Kurzweil K2500 last night and found it rather<br>intimidating.  He likes to use the phrase "out of tune" because he knows that<br>that's inadequate to characterize a tuning except at a very high level.  <br><br>   Anyway, here are some suggestions I made to him that perhaps some of you<br>might want to consider playing with as well:<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>   Yesterday afternoon I wanted to expound further on how to use that 7-step<br>octave-repeating harmonic-series-based tuning.  You said that you weren't sure<br>how to use it, noting semijokingly that it sounded "pretty out-of-tune".  <br><br>   My responses to that are:<br>1.  Hey, no pain no gain!  <br>2.  Is that really any more disconcerting than the microtonal scale-step size<br>    phenomenon you like to tantalyze your audience with?  I'm refering to how <br>    you described 19 to Dave E. and me ... oh, probably 9 months back:  <br>    Tantalyzingly delaying an expected melodic resolution by approaching it in <br>    small microtonal steps.  Is the out-of-tune nature of this tuning really<br>    all that much more disconcerting?  And whether it is or not, is that a <br>    problem?  <br>3.  One thing you're really good at, and I'm not (yet) is music involving <br>    long, sustained tones with faster stuff, often repeated figures, dancing <br>    on top of the sustained chords.  This tuning, I suspect, is well-suited to <br>    that sort of thing:<br>  a.  You can build large chords will little chance of a clash in the minor-<br>      second/major seventh sense of the word, because the pitch relationships<br>      are very simple.  <br>  b.  There exists a semi-standard mixing engineer/artist's analogy of the<br>      sounds they mix to a three-dimensional space:  left/right stereo gives<br>      you the left-right dimension with high- vs. low-pitch suggests top-<br>      bottom and quiet- vs. loud-volume suggests far and close.   Combine<br>      that with the fact that each tone of the octave has a distinct color to <br>      it, and then play a musical, 3D version of ... Pollock was it?  - the <br>      fellow who first painted with squirt-guns).  <br>4.  What it's probably not good for is what I used it for on that tape I gave <br>    you early on, with the last three movements of a Symphonietta in that <br>    tuning.  In that case I tried to build classical structures - traditional<br>    instrumentation, forms, melodies - with nontraditional harmony.  Well, I<br>    concluded that what I did in that regard went reasonably well, but that <br>    that style is not what this tuning is built for.  <br>5.  Since when have you been concerned with audiences thinking your music <br>    weird?!  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 11 Jul 1996 15:39 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id GAA19542; Thu, 11 Jul 1996 06:39:20 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 11 Jul 1996 06:39:20 -0700<br>Message-Id: <009A52C72F5A7420.82A7@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3233 href="#3233">ðŸ”—</a>COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I have created a list of equal temperaments up to about 650 tones<br>per octave with their consistency limits as was explained by Paul<br>Erlich's post of 13 June 1996.
