How close is close?  <br><br>   I don't think I still have exact measurements of real-instrument<br>deviations from exact harmonics lying around.  I don't think I ever printed<br>them out.  And last I checked, my near-harmonic tone decomposition and<br>resynthesis program was in a rather chaotic state.  It will need some<br>changes to be reversed and reimplemented before I could make those<br>measurements again.  <br><br>   But the comments I made in this regard, are based upon decomposing<br>(mostly) orchestral instrument sounds and then resynthesizing them, but<br>forcing them to have purely integer pitch relationships, and then comparing<br>the result to the original tones.  Certainly two conclusions were true:<br>1.  Negating the aharmonicity of an instrument didn't affect the <br>    character of harmonies realized in those instrument sounds more than<br>    realizing them in different timbres altogether, or in other<br>combinations<br>    of timbres.  <br>2.  The main effect of negating aharmonicity was to make the timbres sound <br>    "dead" and mechanical, somewhat like the old Hollywood notion of a <br>    robot's voice.  <br>I think I do still have a copy of the executable version of that program<br>that's capable of doing forced-harmonic resyntheses, by the way.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 5 Jan 1997 22:21 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02051; Sun, 5 Jan 1997 22:24:08 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02049<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA26071; Sun, 5 Jan 1997 13:24:05 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 5 Jan 1997 13:24:05 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701051619_MC2-E48-35DE@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
