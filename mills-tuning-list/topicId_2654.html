But perhaps that<br>>depends on what you mean by paradigm.  I take the term to mean a set of<br>>bounds that you put yourself into.<br><br>Individuals can apply various sets of bounds to particular efforts with the<br>intention of exploring the space created within the bounds.  This is, I am<br>almost sure, what you are saying.  And, as you say, it just plain yields<br>interesting results.  Let me give an example, and Gary, if this is not what<br>you mean, please say so:<br><br>There are many ways to play the piano.  Bach spent his life looking at the<br>keyboard as a place where a simulation of independent solo voices could be<br>run.  Only within the last 100 or so years has an approach that worked with<br>the entire possible "space" of the keyboard been invented.  Both approaches<br>give interesting results.<br><br>But one might expect the Bach approach to be a subset of the modern<br>approach.  This is not the case->  It would seem that every set of limits,<br>no matter how confining, yields unique results!!!<br><br>>>>>>>>>>>>> HOWEVER! <<<<<<<<<<<<<<br><br>In my recent post, "Xenharmonic?", I was using the word "paradigm" to mean a<br>set of bounds placed over an entire field of human interest for a long<br>period of time that's hard to change.  This, it seems to me, is an<br>embarrassment to civilization.<br><br>Leafing back thru the pages of history, I often notice that 12-tone music<br>isn't the only example of this kind of "paradigm" (that is, the broad<br>reaching, entrenched kind)-> Take chess for example:<br><br>People have spent the last 200 years figuring out all the ways to start the<br>game (opening books).  We've finally worked ourselves up to the point where<br>a motivated modern student of chess could blow the heals off the masters of<br>the past; Garry Kasparov is the not just the best human player alive today,<br>he is the best human to ever play the game.<br><br>But all this applies only to regular FIDE chess.  There are an infinity of<br>possible "chess variants" (see the link on my web page under Chess for an<br>EXCELLENT reference on chess variants) that produce significant changes in<br>the way humans look at the game -- even the slightest change to the starting<br>position obsoletes opening study -- and thousands of them are at least as<br>worthwhile as regular chess.  There's absolutely no rational for picking<br>FIDE chess and sticking to it so completely for the last 400 years.<br><br>Maybe the reason we take so long with things is because we're just not that<br>smart.  The fields of FIDE chess are still ripe for the plucking after all<br>these years, and, I believe, contrary to popular belief, that 12 tone equal<br>temperament also has plenty left to offer.<br><br>I've never heard a cogent reason as to why 12-tone should be exhausted.<br>What I have heard seems to blame 12-tone for bad composition (and there<br>seems to be an extra helping of that in the serialist camp).  For the<br>critic, I believe the vitality of 12-tone is well demonstrated by the CD and<br>midi files available through my web site.  Inversely, Xenharmonics do not<br>guarantee interesting music, although it probably makes it much easier.<br><br>In any case, I do not attempt to debate the wisdom of the collective efforts<br>of 12 generations of our ancestors.  What I do say, and hope, is that human<br>evolution is reaching the point where we no longer need to stretch our<br>paradigms over the entire civilization and lock in the freshness with gobs<br>of industrial standards to have them be effective.  Can you see a future in<br>which each individual can exercise intellectual freedom without having to<br>independently re-discover the possibility of intellectual freedom, become a<br>carpenter, or live like a hermit?<br><br>Carl<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Subject:  new standards<br>PostedDate:  19-11-97 23:14:40<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  19-11-97 23:13:15-19-11-97 23:13:16,19-11-97 23:13:23-19-11-97 23:13:23<br>DeliveredDate:  19-11-97 23:13:23<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256554.007A0D6E; Wed, 19 Nov 1997 23:13:08 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03272; Wed, 19 Nov 1997 23:14:40 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 19 Nov 1997 23:14:40 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03270<br>Received: (qmail 22204 invoked from network); 19 Nov 1997 14:14:37 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 19 Nov 1997 14:14:37 -0800<br>Message-Id: <34736EFE.3BE@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
