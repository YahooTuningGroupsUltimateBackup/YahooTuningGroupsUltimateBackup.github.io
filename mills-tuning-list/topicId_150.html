Is it Chalmers or Mclaren<br>or are they a duo? Maybe it was mentioned in the <br>first postings, I remember that 25 were announced,<br>but some were lost during my computer hazards.<br>Why am I asking? I wish to express my thanks and<br>my gratitude to the originators. The psychoacustic <br>postings are amongst the most interesting readings<br>which I have collected so far. The whole documentation<br>must be the result of years of work. I think it is<br>worth to be line-edited into a book and supplemented <br>with illustrations. Don't be curious why your audience<br>is silent and quiet, we are busy reading and learning!<br>yours<br>Helmut Wabnig<br>wabi@net4you.co.at<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 4 Nov 1995 21:53 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA26131; Sat, 4 Nov 1995 11:53:34 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 4 Nov 1995 11:53:34 -0800<br>Message-Id:  <9511041153.aa02463@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
