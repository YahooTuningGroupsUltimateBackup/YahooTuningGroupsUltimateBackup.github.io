"Physically" was obviously the wrong word for me to have used<br>there.  Of course plenty of physical systems have nonlinearities in them<br>(I forget which chaos theorist said "talking about non-linear systems is<br>like talking about non-elephant animals"), and buzzes are a prime<br>example.<br><br>Nevertheless, I remain skeptical about adding sine waves of matching<br>frequency to eliminate beats.
