All microtuning must be done on the <br>fly by replacing note-on & note-off messages with sysex messages <br>indicating the exact pitch to be played.  This is very flexible, but <br>of course requires some software.  The tuning resolution is only 64 <br>steps/semitone.  The manual isn't too bad in describing how the <br>microtuning works. A long time ago I wrote some awful QuickBasic <br>code to do some of this. I suppose MAX or something similar could be <br>used on the Mac.  I once saw Martin Bartlett demonstrating <br>microtuning on the FB-01 with some Atari software, but I suspect that <br>was homebrew.<br>In terms of sound programming, the FB-01 has only 4 sinewave <br>operators. The TX-81Z has other waveforms as well.<br>--<br>Ewan Macpherson   <emacpher@umich.edu><br>Central Systems Laboratory<br>Kresge Hearing Research Institute<br>http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emacpher</div><h3><a id=7967 href="#7967">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>6/1/1998 6:22:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>  Also, does anyone know of a source for tangless, glued-on frets? These<br>>would make fret application possible for those of us with no woodworking<br>>tools.<br><br>   I know only that, when Tom Stone's "Novatone" went under, Mark Rankin<br>said that they had a small outstanding debt to the company that custom-made<br>that wire for them.  They were holding the extrusion die they used to form<br>it hostage, so to speak.  I suppose it's fair to guess that Mark ended up<br>paying the debt to that company and bought the die, but I don't know that<br>for certain.</div>
