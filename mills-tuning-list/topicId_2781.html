Sorry for the delay.  I shall be<br>ready to start shipping them as soon as I confirm that I have the first<br>piece correct on the master.  That first piece was different between the<br>master and the cassette version I received earlier, so I need to be<br>absolutely certain that I don't send out the wrong thing.<br><br>   I expect to begin sending them out in a day or two.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Re: Discrimination of Intervals in Melody<br>PostedDate:  14-12-97 20:39:53<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  14-12-97 20:37:59-14-12-97 20:38:00,14-12-97 20:37:41-14-12-97 20:37:41<br>DeliveredDate:  14-12-97 20:37:41<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656D.006BD4A6; Sun, 14 Dec 1997 20:39:44 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA15057; Sun, 14 Dec 1997 20:39:53 +0100<br>Date: Sun, 14 Dec 1997 20:39:53 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA15064<br>Received: (qmail 29674 invoked from network); 14 Dec 1997 11:39:27 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 14 Dec 1997 11:39:27 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541103b0ba234e81d1@DialupEudora><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
