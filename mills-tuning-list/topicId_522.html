Apparantly, the Ensoniq EPS would qualify, but it's been <br>out of production for a couple of years. I went to a music store, and the <br>salespeople I talked to pointed me to Korg, which makes marvelous <br>synthesizers with amazingly realistic timbres (it's been a long time since I <br>played with synthesizers). It has only one programmable tuning, where each <br>of the twelve notes can be detuned  100 cents. The meager selection of <br>internal tunings does not even include meantone.<br><br>However, I found a way to get the $700 Korg to do 22tet in the store. I set <br>the programmable tuning to a "pythagorean tuning" based on 709-cent fifths. <br>I then split the five-octave keyboard in the middle, and transposed the <br>bottom half up two and a half acoustical octaves. This gave me two and a <br>half octaves of 22tet, with a few redundant notes. I bet the next people who <br>tried out the keyboard were annoyed! Hopefully, I can hook up my roommate's <br>Yamaha DX as a slave via MIDI and have five octaves of 22tet. (?)<br><br>I want to hear what others have to say on this question before I make the <br>purchase. Although 22tet is my main interest, and should be easily <br>realizable on a guitar (my main instrument), I'd love to be able to play <br>with tunings more freely than the Korg allows, if at all possible.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Paul Erlich<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 27 Jun 1996 19:56 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id KAA29228; Thu, 27 Jun 1996 10:56:00 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 27 Jun 1996 10:56:00 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199606271754.NAA13092@cerberus2.Ensoniq.Com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
