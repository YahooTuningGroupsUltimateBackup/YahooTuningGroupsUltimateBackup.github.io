Certain broad musical characteristics are shared<br>between these traditions, but the shared characteristics between North<br>Indian and Persian Music or between Karnatic and Singhalese music are just<br>as rich and audible.<br><br>My experience with Karnatic music is more extensive than with Northern<br>Indian music, but I am certain that the Northern tradition enjoys a larger<br>pitch vocabulary, and in certain styles cultivates a large number of varied<br>intonations for single srutis (including SA and PA) even within a single<br>rag. Some composed rag sections will have certain pitches firmly defined<br>intonationally, others - particularly the slow, improvised Alap - will vary<br>radically. In any case, the intonation chosen may follow a particular style<br>belonging to a school of performers or a single guru. And even though the<br>drone will create a prominent harmonic background for a performer, often<br>part of the performance dynamic is to deviate audibly from the drone<br>pitches or their harmonics.<br><br>One great difficulty in dealing with subcontinental musics - not unfamiliar<br>elsewhere - is that the performers, even noted artists, are very uneven in<br>their intonational skills. A certain Kirana vocalist favored by many in the<br>tuning community, could be extraordinarily precise in his performances, but<br>was frequently completely off, and would often deliver a beautifully<br>intoned alap only to follow up with a composition that was extremely rough.<br><br>In Karnatic music, the tuning is rather more stable throughout the<br>tradition (although 12tet has made inroads in recent years, particularly<br>with the advent of mandolin and guitar performers, as well as the<br>introduction of electronic keyboards) and limited to a set of 12 named<br>pitches, which may vary by a comma much as Rousseau has described,<br>particularly in the ragas where MA moves to a sharp fourth degree (contrary<br>to a lot of literature, this pitch is fixed around 45/32, not the 11/8 that<br>many claim to be hearing). The precise intonation of a Raga varies with the<br>particular tradition, guru, and with the particular composition, but the<br>value attached to tuning is high: as T. Viswanathan put it to me: Sing in<br>tune or go to hell!.<br><br>It has long been surprising that an electronic microtonal keyboard has not<br>been commercially produced in India or Pakistan. It seems like a product<br>that would have a great domestic demand as well as a potential for<br>profitable export to niche markets abroad (like American microtonalists!).<br>Maybe some list members have concrete ideas. Perhaps a 12 (Pyth)+10 (comma<br>varied) keyboard with a variable fundamental frequency would be sufficient.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 23 Dec 1996 06:16 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA31668; Mon, 23 Dec 1996 06:18:47 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA31665<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id VAA20196; Sun, 22 Dec 1996 21:18:44 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 22 Dec 1996 21:18:44 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95.961222210900.23999A-100000@equinox><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5183 href="#5183">ðŸ”—</a>alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)</h3><span>3/24/1997 1:36:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>In my previous suggested bibliography of Indian classical music, I should<br>have made clear that most of the sources I suggested dealt with Hindustani,<br>or North Indian classical music.

It's from a book called "Sonic Design," <br>and I'm afraid I don't know the author. When referring to Indian tunings, <br>they demonstrated with a 27 note to the octave scale, rather than the <br>usual 22 srutis I am used to seeing. Then, they pointed out that each <br>note was more of an "area", rather than a "fixed pitch"...the performer <br>was at liberty to use several different "notes" to express the mood of <br>the raga he/she was playing. This makes perfect sense to me...notation is <br>a tricky affair at times, and in many cases, such as bending a note, <br>there is absolutely NO way to tell a person where to put that note, since <br>it is a matter of feeling and expression...and, this, of course, is where <br>real music differs from theory. <br>    I've been playing blues for 30 years, and it is impossible to tell <br>someone where to play a pitch when they bend; you have to DO it; yet, I <br>know when it's wrong, and so do my students. Again, it's a feeling. I <br>truly believe that only the practitioners of a style of music are <br>qualified to be authorities on what makes it tick. That's why there is so <br>much speculation on Indian tunings by westerners, but little <br>authoritative knowledge...many western theorists do not actually play <br>Indian music, so they're approaching it as outsiders. To me, the concept <br>of no final "pitch" for a note is a lot like so called "quantum" theory, <br>where only probabilities are certain, and our own participation in <br>looking for an electron can affect where it turns up. Again, all <br>improvised music is like this, to some extent. Even though flamenco, for <br>example, is in 12 eq, no one can tell you what to play next on your <br>instrument, so notation is only showing you what happened at that <br>particular time; next time, you'll play something else. Each style is a <br>language, deep and unique. To live it is to speak it truthfully.<br>    Again, I would love to see more great music in our field. There's an <br>awful lot of great 12 eq musicians out there, and I am hoping that the <br>folks who actually play instruments in other tunings will develop their <br>playing and composing skills to the highest possible level. Most people <br>in the world just look at you funny when you say "microtonal," so I <br>believe our work is just beginning. Yet, with powerful, profound music to <br>back up our theories, I am convinced we can help people hear that we are <br>on to something valid, and worthwhile. That's why microdoodling bugs me <br>so much; I'd much rather hear someone play their ass off in 12 eq than to <br>poot around in a rudimentary way on an instrument, trying to convince me <br>that "just" (pure) tunings are "superior" because they are better in <br>tune. As the level of musicianship rises in other tuning systems, things <br>will improve. Until then, a lot of folks think that microtonal music is <br>just a bunch of bleeps and bloops, made by guys at big universities with <br>white coats...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 6 May 1997 13:46 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05866; Tue, 6 May 1997 13:46:38 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05800<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id EAA26388; Tue, 6 May 1997 04:44:36 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 6 May 1997 04:44:36 -0700<br>Message-Id: <970506074218_1289508024@emout05.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5417 href="#5417">ðŸ”—</a>Allen &#x3C;STRANGE@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/1997 8:58:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>"Sonic Design" mentioned by Neil is by Pozzi and Escot or maybe Escot a<br>Pozzi- great book- not sure if its still in print.<br><br>Allen Strange<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 6 May 1997 21:19 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06142; Tue, 6 May 1997 21:19:31 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06138<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id MAA29194; Tue, 6 May 1997 12:16:04 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 6 May 1997 12:16:04 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199705061445_MC2-160C-ABD1@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5421 href="#5421">ðŸ”—</a>Brian Belet &#x3C;BBELET@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/1997 2:02:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Tue, 6 May 1997 08:58:47 -0700 Allen said:<br>>"Sonic Design" mentioned by Neil is by Pozzi and Escot or maybe Escot a<br>>Pozzi- great book- not sure if its still in print.<br>><br>Clarification:  _Sonic Design:  The Nature of Sound and Music_, by<br>Robert Cogan and Pozzi Escot.

My source for this information is an excellent little book,<br>"An Introduction to the Study of Indian Music" by E Clements (1912).<br>There is a diagram at http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/in_music.gif<br>which shows the relationships between the notes in indian music with the<br>ratios of 2, 3, 5 and 7 shown.  The frequencies and names are according<br>to Clements and the layout according to an idea I got from elsewhere.<br><br>Some notes like ma have 7 different frequencies (although 2 are old<br>values), namely 315, 337, 320, 341+1/3, 324, (333+1/3, 316+4/81)<br>and are the flat7, natural, flat\, t and flat respectively.<br>[Hey I can't do those notations in ascii  :-]<br><br>>    I've been playing blues for 30 years, and it is impossible to tell <br>>someone where to play a pitch when they bend; you have to DO it; yet, I <br>>know when it's wrong, and so do my students. Again, it's a feeling. I <br>>truly believe that only the practitioners of a style of music are <br>>qualified to be authorities on what makes it tick.<br><br>I acknowledge that practitioners do know what to do.  However I suspect<br>that you automatically go to the correct one of the above depending on<br>the context.<br><br>-- Ray Tomes -- rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz -- Harmonics Theory --<br>     http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 10 May 1997 12:43 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08535; Sat, 10 May 1997 12:43:49 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 10 May 1997 12:43:49 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08543<br>Received: (qmail 9201 invoked from network); 10 May 1997 10:43:42 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 10 May 1997 10:43:42 -0000<br>Message-Id: <33b2500e.301901156@kcbbs.gen.nz><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
