Monzo's description of Duane Allman's slide guitar reminds me that<br>many of you may be unaware of some of the excellent classic JI pedal steel<br>recordings.  At the top of my list is Buddy Emmons' excellent "Emmons Guitar<br>Company".  Buddy has switched to 12TET in recent years, but most players<br>agree that this late 60's release is the best pedal steel album ever made.<br><br>Another favorite is Jimmy Day's "Steel and Strings".  The material is all<br>country ballads - perfect vehicles for Day's perfectly tuned JI triads.<br>Jimmy Day demonstrates his mastery by weaving those triads together with<br>emotionally charged slide transitions.<br><br>The fact that the pedal steel guitars on these classic albums are tuned in<br>just intonation is not advertised anywhere, but it's obvious to the ear.  I<br>have little doubt that the pure intervals used on recordings like these<br>inspired many of today's players (like me) to take up the instrument.<br><br>Both of these are available on CD from Scotty's Music in St. Louis<br> http://www.iwc.com/scottys-music/ ).  The Emmons CD is listed as "Black<br>Cover" (it's often referred to as "the black album"), and the Day CD also<br>includes his "Steel Guitar Golden Hits" LP.<br><br>    -b0b-<br><br>http://wco.com/~quasar</div>
