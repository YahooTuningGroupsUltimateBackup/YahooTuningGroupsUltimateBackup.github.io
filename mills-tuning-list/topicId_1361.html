The two basic procedures in doing this are repetition and<br>contrast.  A monody can be _tonal_, for example, without outlining chords,<br>but but establishing - through repetition - fixed reference pitches and<br>contrasting them with other pitches. <br><br>Schenker demonstrated one way (or a complex of ways) in which voice leading<br>created contrast to a basic triad. The tones of the triad were contrasted<br>with neighbor and or passing tones. The particulars of his voice leading<br>were observed in late 18th and early nineteenth century european musics; I<br>have no doubt that alternative particulars could be observed in other<br>musics. Bohlen's method of scale construction appears to be in the same<br>spirit - if not derived specifically from voice leading in a particular <br>repertoire. Great minds think alike...<br><br>What still appears the be curious to me about both infill methods of scale<br>construction is why a triadic infill of the octave (4,5,6,8) should be<br>preferred to, for example, the tetrad (4,5,6,7,8), and why the harmonic<br>infills are preferred over subharmonic or neutral divisions. (And why<br>should a harmonic triadic infill (4,5,6,8) be itself infilled in a<br>non-harmonic way (i.e. the diatonic scale and not harmonics 8 through 16).<br>Are these preferences innate or acquired, and if acquired (my own<br>suspicion), what is the range of possible variation? <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 11 Dec 1996 14:37 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA23095; Wed, 11 Dec 1996 14:39:36 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA23064<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id FAA06191; Wed, 11 Dec 1996 05:39:33 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 11 Dec 1996 05:39:33 -0800<br>Message-Id: <01BBE73D.AF0FF320@ashcraac.sct.ucarb.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
