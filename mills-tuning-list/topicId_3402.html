A very stimulating evening indeed that included music by Harrison,<br>Partch, Arvo Part, Johnny Reinhard, George Zelenz, Esmaeel Tehrani, and Sasha<br>Bogdanowitsch.  All the pieces on the program had a great deal to offer.<br>Reinhard's performed his solo bassoon piece, DUNE, which expertly employed<br>innovative uses of multiphonics,  poly-microtonality, and extended<br>instrumental techniques.  Sasha Bogdanowitsch presented an ambitious 25 minute<br>chamber work in JI  featuring his exquisite vocal work.  The audience seemed<br>quite fascinated by the exotic language he created for the text.  He<br>accompanied each syllable with dance-like gestures that further expressed the<br>emotion inherent in the sung phrase.  Quite compelling.  The concert was<br>produced by John Schneider and was well attended.</div>
