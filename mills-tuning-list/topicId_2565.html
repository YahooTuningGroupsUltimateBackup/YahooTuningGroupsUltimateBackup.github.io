I<br>just enjoy 'em.  Mr. Erlich can rest assured that I have nothing but the<br>highest respect for his work.  His was one of my favorite cuts on the tape<br>swap and has got me wanting more.<br><br>He also may or may not wish to know that one of the first tunings I'm going<br>to map to my generalized keyboard (when I get it) will be 22 equal.<br><br>>Today is my last day as a full-time employee of an investment company. I<br>>already spend almost all my free time playing music...<br><br>So how is that working out?  Are you able to resist the temptation of<br>playing with your 12 tone friends enough to go home and be microtonal?<br><br>Lastly, I will say again that altough I used a posting of Mr. Erlich's as an<br>example, I was addressing the community at large with an issue at large.<br>Anyway, here's my response...<br><br>>Now these intervals are getting closer and closer to 3/2, and after just<br>>a few of them even the best ear can't tell the difference between them<br>>and 3/2. Yet according to Carl, 3/2 is more consonant than any of these<br>>ratios. Thus we must conclude that Carl's definition of consonance has<br>>little to do with anything you can actually hear.<br><br>The idea of defining Consonance as a product of the sizes of the numbers in<br>a ratio wasn't Just something I dreamt up.  It is littered all over the<br>literature, especially the JI Primer.  But there's always something vague<br>like "strong implied preference" involved.<br><br>It is told straight in Denny Genovese's thesis "The Harmonic Series as a<br>Practical Approach to Just Intonation", in chapter 2, "Quantification of<br>Dissonance and an Acoustic Definition of Consonance".<br><br>To paraphrase: If you've got two frequencies represented by a ratio in<br>lowest terms whose decimal value is between 1 and 2, then the period of the<br>composite waveform of these two frequencies is the product of the two<br>numbers in the ratio.  I believe this makes a more useful definition of<br>Consonance than any other I've ever heard.  If somebody's got one they think<br>I havn't heard, please share.<br><br>This definition is independent of what a person may or may not hear, and it<br>is independent of how they might like or dislike what they hear.  For those<br>of you who do not view these as assets, don't use this definition.<br><br>The ear has a limit of resolution, just like anything else.  That the one<br>example given by Mr. Erlich is beyond the ear's resolution does not mean<br>that this definition has no practical application.  Clorox is poison but<br>lots of folk find it useful to chlorinate their water.  I think the<br>practical usefulness of the definition is obvious.<br><br>While I can't hear the difference between a 3/2 and a 300001/200001, I can<br>hear the difference between a 19/16 and a 19723/16565.  I'm listening to it<br>right now.  But I've been told that an error of 2 cents is not significant<br>when comparing tempered intervals to just ones.<br><br>Working within the practical limits of human hearing, the perception of<br>subtle mis-tuning is very sensitive to the timbres used, the voicing of the<br>intervals, how high the identities are, and how they are used in combination<br>with other intervals.<br><br>If your timbres have a high degree of inharmonicity, you'll loose<br>resolution.  Don't use bowed strings for high resolution work.  If your<br>interval is down in the lowest octave of the piano, don't expect to hear a<br>10 cent difference.  You're much less likely to notice a 3/2 2 cents off<br>than a 11/7 mistuned by 2 cents.  You can't hear the difference between a<br>3/2 and 700 cents in a melody, but in an otherwise just triad, it sticks out<br>like a sore thumb.<br><br>So my original point was:  When comparing an equal-step tuning to a just<br>tuning on a broad, theoretical level, define Consonance on a broad<br>theoretical level.<br><br>My other original point was: Equal step tunings have nothing to apologize<br>for.  I don't view them as imitating just tunings.  They're a different<br>breed of cat.  The kind of music that makes sense in an equal temperament<br>doesn't make sense in JI and vice versa.  It's like apples and oranges.<br><br>I used to think that an equal step tuning was like having all the pitches<br>that you needed to modulate in every key of a just tuning, except you used a<br>single average pitch instead of two or three or four just ones.  So you<br>could make music on this huge matrix of a just tuning with less notes and<br>worse sound.  But the difference is much deeper than that.  I can't explain<br>it.  The Pauls (Erlich and Hahn) turned me on to this, and their ideas on<br>this matter are much farther along than mine.<br><br><br>And I never said dissonance was bad,<br><br>Carl<br><br><br>Aline Surman writes...<br><br>>I always enjoy the discussions about ratios and eq temps. It is true<br>>that being "in tune" is a mathematical phenomenon of frequencies matching<br>>up perfectly...I agree that when we say eq temps approximate a pure<br>>ratio, it doesn't correlate in a way because as soon as you are off of<br>>the ratio, the new note is NOT the ratio, so it IS something else.<br><br>Thanks for the support!  I know writing these posts is beneficial for me.<br>It's nice to know they are of interest to others as well.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed) <br>Subject:  fourth based keyboard mapping<br>PostedDate:  23-10-97 19:23:27<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  23-10-97 19:22:38-23-10-97 19:22:38,23-10-97 18:23:18-23-10-97 18:23:18<br>DeliveredDate:  23-10-97 18:23:18<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256539.005F7132; Thu, 23 Oct 1997 19:22:29 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA25485; Thu, 23 Oct 1997 19:23:27 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 23 Oct 1997 19:23:27 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA25473<br>Received: (qmail 25782 invoked from network); 23 Oct 1997 10:23:22 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 23 Oct 1997 10:23:22 -0700<br>Message-Id: <memo.641887@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
