At the outset, it would be well to emphasize that while<br>Ervin has indeed provided both the conceptual basis and inspiration<br>for the analysis which follows, its imperfections are my own.<br><br>One of the most intriguing chapters in the history of Western European<br>music and tuning, with many potential byways yet open to explore, is<br>the epoch around 1400. Here I would like to focus on a cadence from<br>this era, which, in a prevalent keyboard tuning of the time, would<br>have a striking Pythagorean "Wolf" fourth.<br><br>Let us consider first a conventional analysis of this cadence based<br>primarily on late Gothic theory, and then a difference tone analysis,<br>concluding with a bit of philosophical musing about harmonic<br>"implications" (acoustical or otherwise) and stylistic context.<br><br><br>---------------------------------<br>1. Anatomy of a 15th-century Wolf<br>---------------------------------<br><br>In Pythagorean tuning, all tones and intervals are generated by a<br>series of pure 3:2 fifths (about 701.955 cents each). Around 1400, a<br>popular arrangement of the chain of 11 fifths for a full chromatic<br>keyboard scale was as follows:<br><br>Gb - Db - Ab - Eb - Bb - F - C - G - D - A - E - B<br>F#   C#   G# <br><br>In this tuning, all accidentals are positioned as flats, with the<br>three notes at the flat end of the chain used as substitutes for true<br>Pythagorean sharps. One effect of this substitution is to make major<br>thirds and sixths involving these "quasi-sharps" a Pythagorean comma<br>smaller than usual, and minor thirds and sixths a Pythagorean comma<br>larger, resulting in nearly pure forms.[1]<br><br>Another result is to make the fifth B-Gb, or the fourth Gb-B, a<br>Pythagorean "Wolf": the fifth is a full Pythagorean comma narrower<br>than just (262144:177147, around 678.495 cents), and the fourth a<br>comma wider than just (177147:131072, around 521.505 cents).<br><br>A keyboard octave chart may illustrate these points:<br><br>   256:243     32:27          1024:729    128:81      16:9<br>    90.22     270.67           588.27     792.18     996.09  <br>     db'        eb'              gb'        ab'        bb'<br> _90.2|113.7|90.2|113.7_     _90.2|113.7_90.2|113.7_90.2|113.7_    <br> c'         d'         e'    f'         g'         a'         b'   c''<br>1:1        9:8       81:64  4:3        3:2       27:16   243:128  2:1<br> 0        203.91    407.82 498.04    701.96     905.87   1109.78 1200<br>    203.91     203.91    90.22   203.91    203.91   203.91    90.22<br><br>To solve the problem of the Wolf, some musicians of the time advocate<br>keyboards with 13 or more notes per octave including a true F#<br>key. However, while this solution may have been implemented on some<br>keyboards, documents of the period suggest that these instruments were<br>the exception rather than the rule. [2]<br><br>In fact, much keyboard music of the period (e.g. the earlier pieces<br>from the Buxheimer Organ Book) seems to fit the G-Bb tuning very<br>nicely. An especially charming resource is the contrast in color<br>between active Pythagorean thirds and sixths involving diatonic notes<br>or flats, and almost-pure schisma thirds and sixths involving sharps, the<br>latter being only a schisma (about 1.954 cents) from the simplest<br>5-based ratios (5:4 for M3, 6:5 for m3, 5:3 for M6, 8:5 for m6):<br><br> Regular Pythagorean intervals             Schisma intervals<br>interval  example  ratio  cents    interval example   ratio     cents<br>   M3      g-b     81:64  407.82     M3      d-f#   8192:6561   384.36<br>   m3      d-f     32:27  294.13     m3      c#-e  19863:16384  317.60<br>   M6      d-b     27:16  905.87     M6      a-f#' 32768:19683  882.40<br>   m6      e-c'   128:81  792.18     m6      f#-d'  6561:4096   815.64<br><br>Some of these pieces, however, include a popular cadence of the 14th<br>and early 15th centuries which takes on a very special quality in this<br>tuning. In the notation which follows, numbers in parentheses identify<br>vertical intervals in cents between a given note and lower notes in a<br>sonority; signed numbers show the melodic motion of each part up or<br>down.<br><br>     b'   --  +90.2 -- c''<br>(905.9, 521.5)    (1200, 498.0)<br>     f#'  -- +113.7 -- g'<br>  (384.4)           (702.0)<br>     d'   -- -203.9 -- c'<br><br>In this standard Gothic cadence, the unstable major third expands to a<br>fifth and the major sixth to an octave, arriving at the complete<br>stable harmony of an outer octave, lower fifth, and upper fourth. This<br>stable combination has a frequency ratio of 2:3:4, and plays a role<br>analogous to that of the 4:5:6 triad in Renaissance-Romantic harmony<br>and of various more complex sonorities in 20th-century music. It<br>represents what I call the point of _stable saturation_, the richest<br>possible sonority which may yet be perceived in a given stylistic<br>setting as a restful point of arrival.<br><br>What is less standard about this cadence in the Gb-B tuning is the<br>combination in the unstable sonority d'-f#'-b' of a usual Pythagorean<br>major sixth (d-b) with a schisma third d'-f#'. This produces a Wolf<br>rather than pure fourth between the two upper voices, a Pythagorean<br>comma wider than just.<br><br>While conventional wisdom tells us that a Pythagorean Wolf is the very<br>epitome of an "unplayable" interval in contexts where a pure fifth or<br>fourth is expected, Mark Lindley interestingly has a more tolerant<br>verdict to render regarding this cadence.<br><br>Finding such a progression "less noxious to the ear than one might<br>expect," he suggests that "[s]omehow the cadential context and the<br>purity of D-F# alleviate the effect of the wolf fourth."[3]<br><br>One possible factor at work here is the tendency for "discordant"<br>intervals of various kinds between two upper voices to be somewhat<br>mitigated in their impact if both affected voices form "concords" with<br>the lowest voice. For example, in a 16th-17th century meantone<br>setting, Easley Blackwood has observed that an augmented fifth such as<br>Bb-F# may be acceptable where these notes form a minor sixth and major<br>tenth above the lowest tone. Here I assume 1/4-comma meantone:<br><br>                              f#'<br>                       (1586.3, 772.6)<br>                              bb<br>                           (813.7)<br>                              d<br><br>Although the augmented fifth between the upper voices is a full diesis<br>(128:125, about 41.058 cents) narrower than a just minor sixth, the<br>concordant intervals of both voices with the lowest part somewhat<br>"cushion" this tension.<br><br>As Lindley also notes, the "cadential context" plays a role in making<br>our cadence with the Pythagorean Wolf fourth more acceptable: an<br>unstable cadential sonority, after all, is often expected to be a<br>point of harmonic tension rather than of restful euphony. Yet another<br>factor is that in the examples he cites [4], these sonorities are not<br>especially prolonged.<br><br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>2. Can a difference tone make a difference?<br>-------------------------------------------<br><br>Having presented a more or less conventional analysis of this cadence<br>with its striking Wolf fourth, I would like to consider an analysis in<br>terms of difference tones.<br><br>One complication of such an analysis might be that while the outer<br>Pythagorean major sixth of d'-f#'-b' (or in this tuning d'-gb'-b') has<br>a rather simple ratio of 27:16, the schisma third d'-f#' (8192:6561)<br>and the Wolf fourth f#'-b' (177147:131072) are much more complex.<br><br>A possible solution is to treat the latter two intervals as if they<br>were defined by simple 5-based ratios, disregarding the difference in<br>each case of a schisma between acoustical reality and simplified<br>model. In such a model, we treat d'-f#' as if it were 5:4, and f#'-b'<br>(actually gb'-b') as if it were 27:20, a Wolf fourth differing from just<br>by a syntonic comma (81:80, about 21.506 cents) rather than a<br>Pythagorean comma:<br><br>                               b'  27<br>                                       7<br>                               f#' 20<br>                                       4<br>                               d'  16<br><br>If we accept this simplification, then the difference tone between the<br>lower two voices (20:16) is equal to 4; the difference tone between<br>the upper voices forming the Wolf is 7. These tones would imply a<br>sonority like the following:<br><br>                               b'  27<br>                               f#' 20<br>                               d'  16<br>                              (c~)  7<br>                              (D)   4<br><br>>From this point of view, we might caption this cadence when realized<br>in the Gb-B tuning as "Pythagoras meets Partch." The difference tone<br>of 4 implies a doubling of the fundamental of our d'-f#'-b' sonority<br>at two octaves below, while the difference tone of 7 implies a pitch<br>notated above as c~ -- that is, c lowered by a septimal comma (64:63).<br><br>Curiously, a Pythagorean tuning system having a highest prime of 3 and<br>a highest odd factor in multiplex (9:1) or superparticular ((9:8)<br>ratios of 9 is producing not only schisma approximations of 5-based<br>intervals, but difference tones approximating 7-based intervals. Might<br>these intervals, including those implied by difference tones,<br>contribute to the harmonic color or force of the cadence?<br><br>While these tones might be perceived to add color, I find it more<br>difficult (at least at first blush) to interpret them as playing a<br>directed cadential role in early 15th-century terms. The cadential<br>paradigm for this epoch involves progression from mildly unstable<br>intervals to stable ones (e.g. m3-1, M3-5, M6-8) by conjunct contrary<br>motion. Here the progression d'-f#'-b' to c'-g'-c'' is already<br>complete: no further difference tones are required.<br><br><br>----------------------------------------------<br>2.1. Xenharmonic time travel: which direction?<br>----------------------------------------------<br><br>As it happens, the period around 1400 marks the point where seconds<br>and sevenths come to be treated more and more cautiously in practice<br>as well as theory, one of the changes often taken to mark the<br>transition from the late Gothic to the early Renaissance.<br><br>To have our difference tones make a difference in terms of _directed_<br>harmony, we must apparently travel to an era where vertical seconds<br>and sevenths play a more "essential" role in cadential action than in<br>the early 15th century. We might journey in either direction: either<br>back to the 13th century, when such intervals regularly participate in<br>directed resolutions, or ahead to the 17th and 18th centuries, when<br>they again come to play a prominent role in bold cadences.<br><br>Let us consider the latter alternative first, since it is simpler from<br>the viewpoint of the difference tone levels required.<br><br>                               b'  27<br>                               f#' 20<br>                               d'  16<br>                              (c~)  7<br>                              (D)   4<br><br>>From an 18th-century viewpoint, our c~ is a "harmonic seventh," and<br>from a viewpoint of 7-limit just intonation, the interval c~-f#'<br>(20:7) is an octave transposition of 7:5, the 7-based diminished<br>fifth. These intervals, in such viewpoints, form an ideally euphonious<br>form of tertian dominant seventh chord, inviting a resolution to a<br>sonority based on G. While the actual cadence is to a stable Gothic<br>combination on C -- not a triadic sonority on G -- possibly a listener<br>oriented to 18th-century style might argue that the f#'-g' progression<br>of the actual middle voice fulfills some of these expectations.<br><br>>From a 13th-century viewpoint, we can derive an interesting result by<br>considering not only primary difference tones, but what I would call<br>"secondary difference tones" arising these primary tones:<br><br>                               b'  27<br><br>                               f#' 20<br><br>                               d'  16<br><br>                              (c~)  7<br>                                       3 <br>                              (D)   4<br><br>The difference tone of 7:4 is 3, and we might also take the sum tone<br>of 20:4 or 24: these procedures imply an additional note at A or a'.<br>If one is willing to consider such procedures as musically relevant,<br>then we can happily derive a 13th-century progression where the new<br>tone indeed reinforces a compelling directed cadence. Note that the<br>schisma thirds and Wolf fourth are 15th-century anachronisms in this<br>earlier Gothic context, but the other intervals fit both the<br>expectations of a more classic Pythagorean tuning and the patterns of<br>harmonic action:<br><br><br>          b'    --  +90.2 --     c''<br>(905.9, 521.5, 203.9)   (1200, 498.0, 498.0)<br>          a'    -- -203.9 --     g'<br>    (702.0, 317.6)           (702.0, 0)<br>          f#'   -- +113.7 --     g'<br>       (384.4)                (702.0)<br>          d'    -- -203.9 --     c'<br><br>In a 13th-century context, the "implied" tone a' takes part in two<br>directed resolutions by contrary motion: an m3-1 resolution with the<br>other middle voice, and a very dynamic M2-4 resolution with the<br>highest voice. Most typically, this cadence occurs in the 13th century<br>as g-b-d'-e' to f-c'-f' rather than d-f#-a-b to c-g-c'.<br><br>Having derived a pure Pythagorean fifth from a schisma third<br>associated with a Wolf fourth -- a curious line of descent, one is<br>tempted to quip -- we can factor out these 15th-century elements to<br>arrive at a very common 13th-century cadence for three voices with all<br>intervals in their classic Gothic sizes:<br><br>          b'    --  +90.2 --    c''<br>    (905.9, 203.9)         (1200, 498.0)<br>          a'    -- -203.9 --    g'<br>       (702.0)               (702.0)<br>          d'    -- -203.9 --    c'<br><br>Here a major sixth (27:16) expands to an octave, and a major second<br>(9:8) to a fourth.<br><br>>From the intriguing transitional world of keyboard tunings around<br>1400, we have managed through a curious musical logic to return to the<br>more traditional but likewise colorful harmonic universe of the Ars<br>Antiqua. It would seem that difference tones can be a refreshing<br>mechanism for stylistic time travel.<br><br><br>---------------------------<br>3. In search of conclusions<br>---------------------------<br><br>The concept of difference tones has been used in many ways, from very<br>tangible applications in FM synthesis to the drawing of various<br>conclusions for composition and analysis. For example, it has been<br>argued that parallel fifths (3:2) imply parallel octaves, because the<br>difference of 3:2 is 1, generating octaves below the lower note of the<br>fifth. Possibly this phenomenon might be used to explain why parallel<br>fifths and octaves alike are accepted in 13th-century harmony but<br>excluded from usual 16th-century harmony, for example.<br><br>"Wolves" are one area where difference tones may be significant, at<br>least for some intervals, periods, and styles. Here I am indebted to<br>the enthusiastic wit and wisdom of Ervin Wilson, and open to<br>suspicions of being overly imaginative at the least in applying such<br>concepts to what may be quite unlikely stylistic contexts.[5]<br><br>>From one point of view, difference tones may provide a kind of musical<br>ink blot test: one can take a 15th-century cadence and come up with<br>either an 18th-century or a 13th-century cadence. Whether such<br>associations have much connection with what a listener actually hears,<br>they offer in any case a new way to move around the centuries of music<br>history and alternative tunings.<br><br><br>                        -------------------------<br>                                  Notes<br>                        -------------------------<br><br>1. 1. Lindley, Mark, 1980a. "Pythagorean Intonation and the Rise of the<br>Triad," _Royal Musical Association Research Chronicle_ 16:4-61. ISSN<br>0080-4460.<br><br>2. Thus see ibid., at pp. 10-11, for a diagram of a keyboard showing<br>true F# (a pure fifth above B), as a useful note not included on<br>actual keyboards; see also pp. 13, 15-16, and 30 for statements<br>indicating that a true F# key was a desired rather than standard<br>feature of 15th-century instruments. On musical evidence for the use<br>of actual 13-note instruments in this period, see pp. 44-45.<br><br>3. Ibid. p. 43. Lindley follows traditional 20th-century terminology<br>in describing this progression as a "double-leading-note" cadence, and<br>indeed one of its distinguishing marks is the presence of two<br>ascending semitonal progressions (f#'-g', b'-c''). While I am not<br>aware of any 15th-century term for the cadence as a whole, the term<br>"double-expansion cadence" might not be inapposite also: the major<br>third expands to the fifth, and the major sixth to the octave.<br>Theorists of the period 1300-1450 often emphasize the "perfection" and<br>force of these expansions, and the cadence combines them in a mutually<br>reinforcing manner.<br><br>4.
