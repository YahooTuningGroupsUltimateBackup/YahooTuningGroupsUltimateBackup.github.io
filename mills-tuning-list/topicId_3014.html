I keep my Steinway in equal temperament. The<br>organ at church is tuned to equal, at 68 degrees Farenheit; my practice<br>time in the winyter is usually at closer to 55 degrees, so when I use the<br>reed stops, the beat presence is alarming/astounding. Harpsichords at home<br>and church. Clavichords: unfretted, double fretted usually to mean-tone,<br>triple fretted usually at Kirnberger II. (changing tuning on fretted<br>clavichords isn't the work of a spare 10 minutes).<br><br>Recorders by Alec Loretto and Rob Turner made as replicas of Renaissance<br>and 17th century instruments, which can handle any temperament. Cornetto<br>by John McCann which picks its own temperamints and with which I have many<br>heated disagreements. Sackbutt which will play anything.<br><br>Judith Conrad, Clavichord Player (jconrad@sunspot.tiac.net)<br>Director of Fall River Fipple Fluters<br>Church Musician at First Congregational Church, Bristol, R.
