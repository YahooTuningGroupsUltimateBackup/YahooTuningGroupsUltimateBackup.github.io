This is "the same" principle that Steinberger uses in their<br>>>TransTrem whammy bar (by the way, I have always thought that a<br>>>Steinberger guitar with a transtrem would make a great microtonal<br>>>instrument, since you can adjust the pitch of each string separately when<br>>>modulating to one of five new key centers).<br><br>>Can you elaborate (I thought the TransTrem just bent all the strings the<br>>same amount)?<br><br>The Transtrem bends all the strings by the same amount by having a <br>variable string length and angle behind the roller bridge pieces. <br>If you tuned the guitar to an open just major chord, for instance, you <br>could play in five different keys with the same just tuning. Its not a very <br>flexible way to play or compose, but we take what we can get. I overstated <br>by saying "a great microtonal instrument". Perhaps I should have said<br>"a fun guitar to fool around with".<br><br>BTW, I like Ken Wauchope's suggestion that we use the term "Allotonality" <br>(alternative (allos=other) to describe the practice of list members.
