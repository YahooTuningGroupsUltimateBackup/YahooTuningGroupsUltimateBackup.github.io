To those of you who posted <br>me wanting to proofread the liners, my apologies, but I believe that you <br>will be pleased with the final results...it looks real sharp. I am not <br>sure yet of the final costs, but will know soon...the artwork and dat <br>transfers were done at minimal cost, so we're in pretty good shape...post <br>me with any questions. I've been listening to a cassette version of the <br>CD, and we have a unique project here, one which I believe will really <br>impress a lot of folks...good job from all involved...Hstick  PS <br>congratulations to Stephen James Taylor for his music credits in the new <br>movie "Why Do Fools Fall In Love"...I saw an ad for it on TV the other <br>nite, and said "Hey, I know that guy"...</div>
