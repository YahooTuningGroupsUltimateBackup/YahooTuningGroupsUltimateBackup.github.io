Murray Barbour's "Tuning and Temperament."<br>Table 3 on page 16 is labelled "Eratosthenes' Enharmonic," though the<br>ratios are those of Ptolemy's enharmonic genus (in the Dorian mode).<br>I have just noticed that the decimal-fraction sexagesimal string<br>lengths in the first line are also wrong. They are, in fact, those<br>of Didymos's enharmonic, 1/1 32/31 16/15 4/3 3/2 48/31 8/5 2/1, though<br>it is stated on page 21 that "Didymus' enharmonic is not included in<br>the above tables." As Barbour states on p.21 elsewhere that the<br>pyknon of Didymos's tuning was "resulting from an arithmetical<br>division of the 16:15 semitone," this would seem to be a production<br>error. <br><br>The correct decimal-fraction sexagesimal string lengths for<br>Ptolemy's enharmonic, 1/1 46/45 16/15 4/3 3/2 23/15 8/5 2/1,<br>are 120.00 117.39 112.50 90.00 80.00 78.26 75.00 60.00 to two<br>decimal places.<br><br>There is another error on p.21, Table 21 where the name of Ptolemy's<br>Diatonic Homalon is given as Hemiolion.<br><br>BTW, the text Harry Partch used was Barbour's dissertation upon which<br>this book is based.<br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 30 Nov 1996 17:47 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12633; Sat, 30 Nov 1996 17:49:06 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12844<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA20615; Sat, 30 Nov 1996 08:49:03 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 30 Nov 1996 08:49:03 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961130114634_1784789785@emout17.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
