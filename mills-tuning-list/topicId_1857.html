So to understand music, you'd have to see it from all of those<br>disciplines' viewpoints.  But the MUST remain separate viewpoints, and can<br>never be merged.  <br><br>   Here's the key point:<br>      Science raises PLENTY of questions we DO NOT know the answer to,<br>      but it NEVER raises questions that we CANNOT know the answer to.  <br><br>   The goal of science is to make what was once unknown, become absolutely<br>obvious, unambiguous, and just plain as day.  <br><br>   But the situation is the opposite for mysticism and religion.  The<br>obvious and unambiguous are what are of marginal interest at best to<br>mysticism.  What's interesting are the haunting little questions like, "why<br>when I hear Brahms' Requiem late at night in a dark room does it sometimes<br>make me smile like a baby and sometimes make me cry like a baby?"<br><br>   You know as well as I do that a neurophysiologist could prattle off an<br>answer, probably involving neurotransmission enzyme action across synaptic<br>.. trimethyl-dibenzyl ... neuron firing rates ... ... autonomic hormonal<br>.. ... capillarian blood flow to the hippcampal ...  <br><br>   And you also know as well as I do that that wouldn't answer the question<br>at all!  <br><br>   So you'd certainly be absolutely correct to recognize that music<br>manifests itself both as the purely objective physical reality of sound<br>waves, and in the joyous, curious, haunting, devastating, or inspiring<br>waves of emotion it splashes through our minds.  <br><br>   But you'd equally certainly be sadly mistaken if you think that you can<br>apply scientific law to mystic sensation, or apply mystical inspiration to<br>solving differential equations!  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 19 Mar 1997 13:24 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05693; Wed, 19 Mar 1997 13:24:13 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05686<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id EAA11738; Wed, 19 Mar 1997 04:22:01 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 19 Mar 1997 04:22:01 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.970319121826.3401A-100000@kali><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5147 href="#5147">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Jo A.

What we accept as<br>axiomatic truths science is based upon are, almost always, readily apparent<br>and consistently agreed upon by all humans, so there's not much mystery in<br>them.  <br><br>   But it's certainly true that, since the axia, by definition of "axiom",<br>cannot be proven, you could perhaps attribute a mystic dimension to them. <br>And it's also certainly true that science itself has often required us to<br>reexamine these axia, a recent example being the relative nature of time<br>and space.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 21 Mar 1997 09:27 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07627; Fri, 21 Mar 1997 09:27:08 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07628<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id AAA03425; Fri, 21 Mar 1997 00:25:34 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 21 Mar 1997 00:25:34 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703210321_MC2-12E6-AB9B@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
