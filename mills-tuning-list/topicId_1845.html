At<br>first, Paul makes eminent sense about going too far afield looking for<br>intervallic relevance in seemingly unrelated natural occurrence.  And I<br>don't share Neil's passion for religious connection to art, as did so many<br>of the Baroque musicians that equated the major triad with the trinity.<br><br>However, in practice I have had great success in mapping out diverse<br>natural phenomena and employed them successfully in my compositions.<br>Examples include mapping the splittings of cosmic rays (Cosmic Rays String<br>Quartet), golden mean (in Dune for bassoon), and quadratic primes (in Rama<br>for trombone).  <br><br>Using material from other semantic realms seems the very stuff of music<br>material, certainly in the words we use to describe the nearly ineffable<br>qualities of music.  Iannis Xenakis recently announced in NYC "Sound and<br>visual things are very close in the mind, but we are not conscious of<br>that," and he's an accomplished architect.<br><br>For weeks I have been teaching my classes at C.W. Post the importance of<br>the overtone series.  I point out repeatedly how the major triad is<br>outlined by 4:5:6, how the "perfect" intervals are only the first 4 of the<br>series, how they exist as definitive consonance, how the fundamental gets<br>the most repeats in the series and is of the highest amplitude, second<br>only to the "dominant" interval of the 3rd harmonic.  I explain that<br>temperament surgically alters the precise intervals, and there are prescribed<br>directions for each precise overtone-derived interval.  To modulate<br>between keys is expensive in "notes needed" for sure transition and has<br>been culturally accepted at 12-per-octave.  12 may have to do with the<br>shape of our hands, the ability to visually discern "inches" of the<br>octave, to what seems to me the smallest number visible mathematically by<br>the most numbers, proportionately.<br><br>Ultimately, I come repeatedly to the conclusion that there is no overtone<br>series, per se.  Merely the resonance of the ordering of rational numbers<br>from 1, onwards.  Any thoughts on how the "overtone series" would alter if<br>on a different celestial object? <br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@idt.net<br><br><br>p.s.

He was similarly<br>outspoken against the nationalistic and technological equivalents of that<br>sort of fanaticism, including for example wars driven by little more than<br>national pride, or using superior technology to obliterate a civilization. <br><br><br>   As with our friend John C., Sagan was also down on pseudoscience,<br>meaning cases where people use incompletely or misdirectedly, or give the<br>impression of using, scientific methodology to advance a cause they are<br>particularly fond of.  A common example is citing evidence in favor of a<br>conclusion while (whether intentionally or not) ignoring evidence to the<br>contrary.  Also common is citing evidence based upon sample sizes that are<br>insignificant statistically.  Many pseudoscientific cases are also<br>presented with an attitude suggesting that their conclusion cannot be<br>refuted.<br><br>   Carl Sagan's attitude in matters where we just simply have no reliable<br>objective information about a question, or where the question is clearly<br>arbitrary from a scientific perspective is a different matter.  I<br>personally never got the impression of a condscending attitude toward those<br>who take a position such matters based solely upon a personal preference or<br>intuition of whatever sort.  His choices of music and sounds to put onto<br>his Voyager record, for example, were based upon very open and tolerant<br>attitudes toward human diversity.  <br><br>   I have long wondered what Sagan would have had to say about<br>Xenharmonics.  I suspect not much really, in the sense that I suspect that<br>he didn't have much experience with music as a whole.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 15 Mar 1997 22:55 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA25345; Sat, 15 Mar 1997 22:55:18 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA25346<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id NAA12353; Sat, 15 Mar 1997 13:53:16 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 15 Mar 1997 13:53:16 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703151651_MC2-12A6-99EB@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5120 href="#5120">ðŸ”—</a>rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz (Ray Tomes)</h3><span>3/17/1997 6:02:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net> wrote:<br><br>>All of this relates to music, to me...I cannot separate music from any <br>>other facet of life, including what we call "science."
