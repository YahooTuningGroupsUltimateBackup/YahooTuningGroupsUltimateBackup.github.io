Well, I hate to admit it but you have a point there.  In<br>looking back over the discussion I find that I myself got caught in the trap<br>of using words denoting value like "better" and "superior," which are<br>subjective and relative in the context of the judgement of a scale in its own<br>right.  Sorry!<br><br>On the other hand, I would have to contend that our speculation has not been<br>entirely fruitless.  My original question was *Why*, and was a genuine<br>attempt to understand the motivations people have for studying ET scales, as<br>well as an attempt to get us all thinking and talking about why we do what we<br>do.  It can really help clarify your own vision of your work to think at that<br>level now and then, kinda the old forest/trees thing, ya know.  I'd bet that<br>some of the people who had to scratch their heads to answer my question have<br>a better grasp of the purpose of their studies than they had before.  I also<br>hoped it would spin off a number of other good topics, but that didn't pan<br>out as much as I would have liked.<br><br>So, I now have a pretty good understanding (I think) of the need to study ET<br>scales, although I'm still not convinced it's the most promising path for<br>musical developement at this historical juncture, and I'm quite sure I won't<br>be doing it any time soon.  That's not a criticism of anyone who chooses to<br>do so.<br><br>> ... we should <br>> look at different issues, such as: which tuning will bebop sound best in? <br>> How about bluegrass, or reggae, or Celtic folk music? Which tuning best <br>> expresses what the Bedouins of Arabia feel? How about a guy in Argentina, <br>> singing about how lonely he is...what tuning works best for him? What <br>> about a European (say, German) keyboard player, who hears music with 4 or <br>> 5 voices...what tuning should he play in? What if a composer wants to <br>> write about the death of his wife, whom he dearly loved...which tuning <br>> system best expresses such feelings?<br><br>Do you have any absolute answers for these, or similar, questions, Aline?  If<br>so, I'd be interested to see them.  They seem to me rather like asking "What<br>car will be best for a vacation?"  They depend on so many factors other than<br>those enumerated.  In the cases involving music already written, chances are,<br>the scale used to write them is best.  In the case of what someone feels,<br>whatever scale(s) the person is most comfortable with would generally be<br>best.  It seems to me that the question belongs the other way around - "How<br>can I best express what I feel through a given scale"; and that the questions<br>of the appropriateness of any given scale are related more to principles of<br>theory than emotional content or message.<br><br>That's not to say that there are no patterns whatsoever observable between<br>particular scales and emotional states.  Any analysis/anecdotes anyone has<br>regarding those connections would be fascinating reading for me.  I'm vaguely<br>familiar with some of the ancient Greeks' opinions, what with governments<br>banning certain scales and all.  Intriguing.<br><br>> Yikes, guys...let's make <br>> some monster music that touches people in their hearts, that makes the <br>> world a better place to be, that fights injustice, that changes people's <br>> consciousness for the better. Use a tuning that fits your musical needs, <br>> that allows you to say the things you need to say.<br><br>Thanks for the timely encouragement!  O. K., I'll shut up and go to my ivory<br>tower now.<br><br>David J.
