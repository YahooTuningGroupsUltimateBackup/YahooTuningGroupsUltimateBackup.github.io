Since even the Great McLaren's <br>interest was piqued by one of my posts on consistency, maybe it's worth <br>reviewing. Unfortunately, all of my e-mail from that far back is lost, so <br>instead I'll review Manuel's post in Tuning Digest 776:<br><br>Manuel wrote:<br>>I have created a list of equal temperaments up to about 650 tones<br>>per octave with their consistency limits as was explained by Paul<br>>Erlich's post of 13 June 1996. However it's not restricted to<br>>integer divisions, all scale step sizes that give a different<br>>consistency limit were calculated. Initially I thought this could<br>>make a nice graph, step size horizontally, limit vertically,<br>>but the function behaves very wildly and there are very many points.<br>>Not included in the file are points where both left and right side<br>>limits are smaller than 5.<br>>This is the filename:<br>>ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/papers/consist_limits.txt<br><br>>Another larger file<br>>ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/papers/cons_limit_bounds.txt<br><br>>contains the step size bounds for each consistency limit of 3 to 18,<br>>also up to 650-tET.<br><br>Here's a definition of consistency: Given an odd number n, an octave-based <br>equal temperament is consistent within the n-limit if, for any odd numbers <br>a, b, and c such that 0<a<b<c<=n, the number of steps that best approximates <br>a:b plus the number of steps that best approximates b:c is equal to the <br>number of steps that best approximates a:c.<br><br>No equal temperament can be adequately notated using the symbols of just <br>intonation (Pythagorean scale plus syntonic commas) if it is not consistent <br>within the 5-limit. Paul Rapoport disagrees. I guess we'll just have to <br>agree to disagree.<br><br>I found 111-tet by looking at consist_limits.txt.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 9 Aug 1996 08:23 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06760; Fri, 9 Aug 1996 08:24:01 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06642<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA08441; Thu, 8 Aug 1996 12:50:11 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 8 Aug 1996 12:50:11 -0700<br>Message-Id: <85960808194558/0005695065PK2EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
