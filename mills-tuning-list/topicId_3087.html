Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/1998 11:04:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>}I've worked out that Paul Erlich's Pentachordal modes can be<br>>}written as 10 JI notes plus three commas of 50/49.  This<br>>}interval is larger than a syntonic comma, so some tempering is<br>>}advisable, but it should be small enough for the scales to<br>>}function as 10 pitch classes.<br>><br>>In my paper, I mention that in JI, two of the ten notes of the pentachordal<br>>modes would each require two versions a 50:49 apart. An earlier version of<br>>the paper (such as the one on John Starrett's web page) had 49:48 instead of<br>>50:49. That was an error. However, the number two is correct. You don't need<br>>three commas, just two, and the two are located at scale steps a 6:5 from one<br>>another.<br>><br>>The symmetrical decatonic modes, however, require four 50:49 commas, and two<br>>64:63 commas.<br>><br>><br>>For those confused but interested, the pentachordal scale is<br>><br>>s s s L s s s L s s<br>><br>>and the symmetrical scale is<br>><br>>s s s s L s s s s L<br>><br>>and the template (1,4,7,9) is supposed to produce complete 7-limit tetrads on<br>>most scale degrees, just like, in the diatonic scale, the pattern (1,3,5)<br>>produces complete 5-limit triads on most scale degrees. Unlike Partch, I<br>>think the most stable root of these chords is the lower note of the 3:2<br>>interval found within them, and this root will always be the (1) in these<br>>templates.<br>><br>>}As 10 fixed pitches, the comma of 50/49 means that the tritones<br>>}10/7 and 7/5 must be equal.  With just octaves, they must both<br>>}be an exact half-octave.  As these are the worst 7-limit<br>>}intervals in 22-equal, that means there is no better way of<br>>}tuning decatonic modes unless you allow more than 10 notes.<br>><br>>Yuppers. This is all in the paper.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
