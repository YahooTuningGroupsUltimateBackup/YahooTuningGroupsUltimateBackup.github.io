It is like the musical system in India, which is not so <br>rigidly fixed as western music. Our composers give a certain definite outline,<br>a system of melody and rhythmic arrangement, and within a certain limit <br>the player can improvise upon it. He must be one with the law of that <br>particular melody, and then he can give spontaneous expression to his musical <br>feeling within the prescribed regulation. We praise the composer for his <br>genius in creating a foundation along with a superstructure of melodies, but we <br>expect from the player his own skill in the creation of variations of <br>melodic flourish and ornamentation. In creation we follow the central law of <br>existence, but if we do not cut ourselves adrift from it, we can have <br>sufficient freedom within the limits of our personality for the fullest <br>self-expression. <br><br>EINSTEIN: That is possible only when there is a strong artistic tradition <br>in music to guide the people's mind. In Europe, music has come too far <br>away from popular art and popular feeling and has become something like a <br>secret art with conventions and traditions of its own. <br><br>TAGORE: You have to be absolutely obedient to this too complicated music. <br>In India, the measure of a singer's freedom is in his own creative <br>personality. He can sing the composer's song as his own, if he has the <br>power creatively to assert himself in his interpretation of the general law <br>of the melody which he is given to interpret. <br><br>EINSTEIN: It requires a very high standard of art to realize fully the <br>great idea in the original music, so that one can make variations upon <br>it. In our country, the variations are often prescribed. <br><br>TAGORE: If in our conduct we can follow the law of goodness, we can have <br>real liberty of self-expression. The principle of conduct is there, but <br>the character which makes it true and individual is our own creation. In <br>our music there is a duality of freedom and prescribed order. <br><br>EINSTEIN: Are the words of a song also free? I mean to say, is the singer <br>at liberty to add his own words to the song which he is singing? <br><br>TAGORE: Yes. In Bengal we have a kind of song-kirtan, we call it-which <br>gives freedom to the singer to introduce parenthetical comments, phrases <br>not in the original song. This occasions great enthusiasm, since the <br>audience is constantly thrilled by some beautiful, spontaneous sentiment <br>added by the singer. <br><br>EINSTEIN: Is the metrical form quite severe? <br><br>TAGORE: Yes, quite. You cannot exceed the limits of versification; the <br>singer in all his variations must keep the rhythm and the time, which is <br>fixed. In European music you have a comparative liberty with time, but <br>not with melody. <br><br>EINSTEIN: Can the Indian music be sung without words? Can one understand <br>a song without words? <br><br>TAGORE: Yes, we have songs with unmeaning words, sounds which just help <br>to act as carriers of the notes. In North India, music is an independent <br>art, not the interpretation of words and thoughts, as in Bengal. The <br>music is very intricate and subtle and is a complete world of melody by itself. <br><br>EINSTEIN: Is it not polyphonic? <br><br>TAGORE: Instruments are used, not for harmony, but for keeping time and <br>adding to the volume and depth. Has melody suffered in your music by the <br>imposition of harmony? <br><br>EINSTEIN: Sometimes it does suffer very much. Sometimes the harmony <br>swallows up the melody altogether. <br><br>TAGORE: Melody and harmony are like lines and colors in pictures. A <br>simple linear picture may be completely beautiful; the introduction of <br>color may make it vague and insignificant. Yet color may, by combination <br>with lines, create great pictures, so long as it does not smother and destroy <br>their value. <br><br>EINSTEIN: It is a beautiful comparison; line is also much older than <br>color. It seems that your melody is much richer in structure than ours. <br>Japanese music also seems to be so. <br><br>TAGORE: It is difficult to analyze the effect of eastern and western <br>music on our minds. I am deeply moved by the western music; I feel that <br>it is great, that it is vast in its structure and grand in its <br>composition. Our own music touches me more deeply by its fundamental lyrical <br>appeal. European music is epic in character; it has a broad background and <br>is Gothic in its structure. <br><br>EINSTEIN: This is a question we Europeans cannot properly answer, we are <br>so used to our own music. We want to know whether our own music is a <br>conventional or a fundamental human feeling, whether to feel consonance <br>and dissonance is natural, or a convention which we accept. <br><br>TAGORE: Somehow the piano confounds me. The violin pleases me much more. <br><br>EINSTEIN: It would be interesting to study the effects of European music <br>on an Indian who had never heard it when he was young. <br><br>TAGORE: Once I asked an English musician to analyze for me some classical <br>music, and explain to me what elements make for the beauty of the piece. <br><br>EINSTEIN: The difficulty is that the really good music, whether of the <br>East or of the West, cannot be analyzed. <br><br>TAGORE: Yes, and what deeply affects the hearer is beyond himself. <br><br>EINSTEIN: The same uncertainty will always be there about everything <br>fundamental in our experience, in our reaction to art, whether in Europe <br>or in Asia. Even the red flower I see before me on your table may not be <br>the same to you and me. <br><br>TAGORE: And yet there is always going on the process of reconciliation <br>between them, the individual taste conforming to the universal standard.<br><br><br>John Starrett<br>http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</div>
