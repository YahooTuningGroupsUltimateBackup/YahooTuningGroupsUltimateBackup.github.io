From Partch's  "Genesis<br>of a Music", 2nd edition, p. vii:<br><br>> "In 1919, as I recall, I had virtually given up on<br>> both music schools and private teachers, and<br>> had begun to ransack public libraries, doing<br>> suggested exercises and writing music free<br>> from the infantilisms and inanities of professors<br>> as I had experienced them.<br>><br>> When I was twenty-one I finally found, in a<br>> library, the key for which I had been searching<br>> the Helmholtz-Ellis work, _On the Sensations<br>> of Tone_.  Under this new impetus, doubts<br>> and ideas achieved some small resolution,<br>> and I began to take wing."<br><br>It influenced many other harmonically<br>inventive composers in a similar fashion<br> -- I believe among these were Debussy and<br>Ben Johnston.  It's well worth the cost.<br><br>By the way, the full title of the book is "On the<br>Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis<br>for the Theory of Music", and most of it is<br>an explanation of Helmholtz's scientific<br>experiments on sounds and hearing, and<br>their results.   Notice the emphasis this places<br>on the subject (the listener) -- reminiscent of<br>my quoting Meyer the other day about music<br>theory having to do not only with acoustics<br>but also with nervous tissue.<br><br>A very interesting book about the history of<br>tonality in European music, which emphasizes<br>a subjective interpretation of tonal concepts,<br>is _Tonality in Western Culture: A Critical and<br>Historical Perspective_  by Richard Norton<br>[Pennsylvania State University Press, 1984].<br><br>   Joseph L.
