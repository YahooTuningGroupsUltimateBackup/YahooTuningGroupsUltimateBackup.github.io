My goal will be to suggest exercises and<br>qualities of exercises that work, and don't work, on CDs.<br><br>   In traditional University "Musicianship" classes, the ultimate focus of<br>ear-training efforts is often an exercise called "four-part dictation".  In<br>four-part dictation, you hear a short (hopefully!) Bach-chorale-style<br>composition, and your task is to write out all four parts within a few<br>hearings.<br><br>   Is four-part dictation a valuable ear-training goal?  I suppose<br>everybody could have a different answer to that question, or a different<br>goal.  Since I'm most interested in composition, I'm interested in anything<br>that makes it easier to get down on paper (or a MIDI sequencer, or directly<br>to an instrument) the music that's going on in my head.<br><br>   Whether being able to write down, or play directly, the music going on<br>in our heads is the ideal goal or not, for this series' purposes, I'll<br>operate under the assumption that that's what we want out of these CDs.<br><br>   What does that entail for 88CET tuning, or analogously with other tunings?<br>1.  Familiarity with 88CET intervals.<br>2.  Familiarity with 88CET notation.<br>3.  Familiarity with 88CET block-chord harmonies.<br>4.  Familiarity with 88CET scales, as building blocks.<br>And just as with reading music, this leads to being able to recognize<br>groups of notes - motifs or "riffs" I suppose - as atomic units of melody,<br>just as block-chords become atomic units of harmony.  But certainly you<br>have start with individual pitch relationships, or you won't even be able<br>to handle those motifs.<br><br>   But familiarity implies speed.  You can't realistically expect to write<br>down music as fast as you dream it up.  The process of writing a run of<br>16th notes for example usually takes a lot longer than the notes themselves<br>last.  That's not the case for improvisation though;  you certainly can and<br>must play notes and think them at the same musical speed.  But in either<br>case, you clearly can't afford to stop and think, "and then the melody goes<br>down to... dang! what the heck is that note?".<br><br>   So most of the exercises I put onto my ear-training tapes and CDs<br>specifically demand a quick response.  "Quick!  What's a subminor third<br>below A?  Below Db?  Below F?  What are the notes of the pseudodiatonic<br>scale on B?  On G?  What are the intervals in a harmonic-series fragment<br>chord?"  That sort of thing.  In short, I don't give myself much time to<br>respond.<br><br>   Clearly though, you have to be realistic about how long you give<br>yourself to answer a question, or at least about what material you put on<br>the CD.  Don't ask yourself to answer questions two years above your<br>proficiency level in two seconds.<br><br>   Perhaps a better way to put it is that you should use these ear-training<br>CDs to improve your proficiency and speed on tasks that you already can<br>perform, more often than to learn tasks that are mostly new to you.</div>
