HP often separated his theory <br>from his practice. One might imagine upon reading about Monophony that <br>it would be applied to sustained tones with harmonic spectra and<br>vocal texts, however, HP used plucked string and inharmonic percussion<br>timbres primarily and except in Oedipus and some other early works, seldom<br>wrote extended lyrical vocal lines, instead preferring short aphoristic phrases, nonsense syllables, interjections, etc.<br> <br>So, I think we can justifiably divorce his chordal progressions from <br>his theoretical 43-tone  scale and even add extra tones whenever <br>necessary to make the harmony less static.<br> <br>For the benefit of those without access to a copy of _Genesis of a Music_,<br>I've translated some of HP's progressions into ratios which show the <br>voicing better: (The page #'s are from the first edition of Genesis.)  <br>The O's and U's refer to Otonality and Utonality, HP's terms for harmonic <br>and subharmonic as applied to chords. O and U come from Over and Under.<br> <br>p185:	3/1	->	3/1<br>	21/8	->	5/2<br>	9/4	->	2/1<br>	15/8	->	2/1<br>	3/2 	->	1/1<br> <br>	3/2 O		1/1 O (V7 to I)<br> <br>p.186, Diagram 13:<br>	11/8	->	11/8 (both voices to 11/8)<br>	27/20	-><br>	 <br>	33/32	->	11/10<br>		->	11/12 (11/6 in lower octave)<br> <br>	11/8  O?	11/8 U (HP admits that the first chord is<br>			not easily analysed and not very tonal.)<br> <br>p. 186:<br>	33/16	-> 	2/1<br> <br>	27/16	->	7/4<br>	21/16	->	5/4<br>	9/8	->	9/8<br> <br>	15/16	->	1/1<br>	3/4	->	3/4 (3/2 in lowest octave)<br> <br>	3/2 O		1/1 O<br> <br>p. 187:<br>	8/3	->	8/3<br>	32/15	->	2/1<br> <br>	16/9	->	16/9<br>	32/31	->	8/5<br>	32/27	->	8/7<br> <br>	32/33	->	1/1 (64/32 in lowest octave)<br> <br>	4/3 U		1/1 U (plagal cadence)<br> <br>p. 188, Diagram 14:<br>	12/7	->	7/4<br>	10/7	->	7/5<br>	8/7	->	7/6<br> <br>	8/7 O		7/4 U (example of "tonality flux"<br> <br>p. 188, Diagram 15:<br>	11/5	->	24/11	<br> <br>	11/6	->	20/11<br>	11/8	->	16/11<br> <br>	11/8 U		16/11 O (the other example)<br> <br>My class notes state that the homework for the Nov 9, 1967 class was <br>to choose any two hexads which resolve by small intervals and to also <br>write 3 lines of counterpoint in any scale that can be played on the <br>Chromelodeon.  The progression HP gave us in class was from 11/8 U to <br>8/5 O in which the 11/6 moved to 8/5 in the bass, 11/9 to 6/5, 11/7 <br>to 9/5, 2/1 and 11/5 were held,  and 11/4 resolved to 14/5.<br>	<br>Other examples I have in my notes are 5/4 U to 1/1 O, 8/7 O<br>to 4/3 O, and 8/5 O to 4/3 O. I suspect these were my own <br>solutions.<br> <br>What I can't seem to find are any examples of the strongly beating<br>progressions that I recall HP played for us, unless the second<br>one from the top (above) is one of them one. My question to Allen about <br>the class notes was partly rhetorical and partly because mine are <br>very incomplete, especially about the chordal sequences we studied. <br>Most of what HP taught us was in Genesis, save for the beating <br>progressions. I'm sure I've seen a score of them somewhere, but I can't <br>find it now, even though I am back in Texas in my own house at the <br>moment.<br> <br>--John<br> <br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 15 Nov 1995 15:15 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id FAA09311; Wed, 15 Nov 1995 05:15:22 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 05:15:22 -0800<br>Message-Id:  <9511150512.aa23790@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2324 href="#2324">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/1995 10:30:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Aha!  3:5:7:9 harmonies for Pierce-Bohlen.  Excellent.  I've been wondering<br>for a long time, but never had the time to sit down and crank out, what ratio<br>approximations Pierce-Bohlen makes available.  Thanks for pointing that out,<br>John.  <br><br>   That makes sense in light of Brian M's observation that Pierce-Bohlen is<br>essentially every fifth step of 41TET, and that 88CET is essentially every third<br>step.  That of course means that 3 PB steps ~= 5 88CET steps, which is a pretty<br>good approximation to 9:7 (checko).  And 6 PB steps ~= 10 88CET steps, which is<br>a good approximation to 5:3 (checko again).  <br><br>   Oh, by the way, the corresponding harmonic series fragment for 88CET is<br>4:6:7:9:10:11:15.  And as with Pierce-Bohlen's 3:5:7:9 fragment John mentioned,<br>it can be taken in retrograde to form a subharmonic series fragment.  <br><br>   One very valuable difference that falls out of those two harmonic series<br>fragments is that 88CET has a 10:7 tritone, whereas Pierce-Bohlen has a 7:5<br>tritone.  I personally have always liked 7:5 better than 10:7, although that's<br>kind of like saying that I carrots more than potatoes.  They both have value in<br>their own right.  <br><br>   Sorry to keep prattling on about 88CET, or even more importantly, to relate<br>an observation about Pierce-Bohlen, to 88CET as though 88CET were some sort of<br>universal tuning reference.  I blabber about 88CET because it's my current<br>"thing".  But anyway, a number of you have experimented with both tunings, so I<br>thought some of you might find that relationship interesting.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 17 Nov 1995 01:55 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id PAA00648; Thu, 16 Nov 1995 15:55:48 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 16 Nov 1995 15:55:48 -0800<br>Message-Id: <9511161555.ZM7862@frollo><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
