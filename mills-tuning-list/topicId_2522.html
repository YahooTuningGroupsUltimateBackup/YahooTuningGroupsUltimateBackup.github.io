Does anybody know where to get information on this?<br><br>The Sanderson machine is from Inventronics Inc.  9 Acton Road<br>Chelmsford, Ma 01824-341.  or call 1-800-FAST440.<br>    The Sanderson machine does all the things  mentioned, and much more.  It<br>measures the relative inharmonicity in three places on a piano, and<br>calculates an extremely consistant 12ET tuning program.  It can measure the<br>amount of overpull to leave a flat piano in tune and also at pitch.   It is<br>also programmable, just pick your note, pick the harmonic you will use as an<br>index, ( or use the fundamental, doesn't matter),  assign a value to the<br>cents window,( to within .1 cent), and wham! that note is registered, and you<br>can tune anything to it by stopping the lights.  This is a midi-compatible<br>machine with automatic note recognition, designed primarily for professional<br>piano tuners.  High end model is about $1,800. Used ones, when you can find<br>them average about $1,000.<br>      My strongest attachment to it is the ease which it allows in applying<br>Jorgensen's research to any of the modern pianos. I don't have to spend years<br>learning primitive aural techniques,  I can just apply the  alterations to my<br>existing tunings, (that I have worked out!), and instantly have access to the<br>differences between say a Prinz and a Stanhope.<br>         Machines like this are the strongest hope for increased temperament<br>awareness today, as too few tuners can afford the time to learn what is a<br>present, a lightly demanded skill.  If professional tuners can produce these<br>tunings, I think a demand can be created.
