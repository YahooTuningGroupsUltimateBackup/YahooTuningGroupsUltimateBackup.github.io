Square the guess => guess sixth root of 2.<br><br>   This probably should have said:<br>1.  Square the guess of 12th root of two => guess of sixth root of 2.<br><br>>>2.  Square that => guessed cube root of 2.  <br>>>3.  Multiply by result of step 1 => guessed square root of 2.<br>>>4.  Square that => guess of 2.  <br><br>   Johnny K's point here is that it just doesn't take too many iterations of<br>insightful guessing before you resolve the 12th root of 2 down to as fine<br>accuracy as you realistically need for musical purposes.  <br><br>   But you don't need any sort of analytical technique to choose your guesses -<br>just intelligence.  I'd probably start by noticing that 1.1, since 1.2 is almost<br>certainly too high.  1.1 squared is 1.21, and that squared is 1.46, and that is<br>going to square up to something close to 1.5 squared (2.25).  So since 1.1 to<br>only the eighth power is already larger than two, the twelfth power of two must<br>be somewhere between 1.1 and 1.  So, I would probably then split the difference<br>and guess 1.05.  Doing those four multiplications, I find that 1.05 to the<br>twelfth power is 1.795..., meaning that the real twelfth root of two must be<br>somewhat larger than that.  Doing those same multiplications on 1.06 gives me<br>something a lot closer:  2.01.  <br><br>   For the limited purposes of very crude and/or imprecise-pitched instruments,<br>that's about all of the precision you need.  And that in only three iterations<br>of insightful guessing, and a total of eight multiplications.  Not too tough!  <br><br>   From there I'd probably see that I'm so close that I'd probably be best off<br>shaving just a little bit off the 1.06, and try 1.059.  That then lands me at<br>1.9895...:  Low by about the same amount by which I was high at 1.06.  So I'd<br>then try 1.0595.  That puts me at 2.00083...<br><br>   So, after just five iterations - easily less than a day's work with<br>multiplication on paper - I'm down to an error of less than a cent!  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 17 Oct 1995 17:41 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA05341; Tue, 17 Oct 1995 08:40:51 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 17 Oct 1995 08:40:51 -0700<br>Message-Id:  <9510170839.aa04406@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
