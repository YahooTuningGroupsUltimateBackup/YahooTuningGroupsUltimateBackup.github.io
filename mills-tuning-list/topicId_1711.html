I say let the<br>> music make the definitions, not the reverse. ...<br>> If a diatonic analysis is crippled enough to confuse 81/80<br>> with 1/1, then it doesn't fall within the realm of usefulness.<br><br>   Well, then I recommend you avoid diatonic-triad nomenclature and<br>concepts (e.g., "V", "ii", or "vi") if you're not interested in diatonic<br>harmony!  <br><br>   Yes, you're certainly right that definitions don't make music;  they<br>make models for music.  How much heed a composer chooses to give to those<br>model structures is largely a different matter entirely.  <br><br>   It's easy for students and instructors, composers and performers to get<br>the impression, after writing their 629th SATB part-writing exercise, that<br>those annoying voice-leading rules from Freshman and Sophomore Theory<br>classes aren't meaningful to "real" music.  I really disagree.  Anybody who<br>feels that way needs to listen to Mozart's "Ave Verum Corpus", or the<br>"Agnus Dei" of his Requiem.  <br><br>   I'm certainly not suggesting by any means that that is the only valid or<br>useful mindset from which to write music.  But it's far from useless just<br>because it doesn't comprehend the idea of a comma.  <br><br>   The ideas of traditional harmony has value applied to certain microtonal<br>systems - as much or as little value as it has in 12TET.  Traditional<br>theory is based upon triadic harmony, but it's most basic emphasis is<br>functional harmony:  <br>* Leading tones want to go up, <br>* Sevenths want to go down, <br>* Dominant seventh chords want to resolve to tonic chords, etc.<br><br>   Functional harmony is also the basis behind wandering tonics:  If you<br>can convince an audience that some pitch is the leading tone, and you<br>resolve it upward by half-step, then they'll believe that the pitch you<br>land on is the tonic, even if it's not the tonic you started on.  Taken out<br>of the framework of functional harmony, and of tonality, the idea of<br>wandering tonics is no longer meaningful.  <br><br>   So it's certainly not unreasonable to think that the tonic could wander<br>down to the original pitch of the leading tone, for example.  But if it<br>does, it's still functionally the tonic, because that's how our ears will<br>perceive it.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 23 Feb 1997 14:02 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA15122; Sun, 23 Feb 1997 14:02:27 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA15115<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id FAA02395; Sun, 23 Feb 1997 05:00:31 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 23 Feb 1997 05:00:31 -0800<br>Message-Id: <33103EB4.712@ix.netcom.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4866 href="#4866">ðŸ”—</a>Matt Nathan &#x3C;mattn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/1997 10:22:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Charles Lucy wrote:<br>> <br>> >Even allowing for some [error] in measurement, this is definitely<br>> >nowhere near the the series of fourths and fifths you<br>> >predicted!
