He alleged <br>that "we need fewer hurricanes frm the Northwest."  <br>Paul was presumably intent on demonstrating, sans<br>evidence (ex nihilio, as it were) that the bibliographies <br>at the end of his articles are by some convoluted twist  of<br>logic useful and adequate, rather than criminally deficient,<br>atrociously deceptive, falling unpardonably short of even<br>the lowest standards of slipshod scholarship.<br>Of course, my posted statements stand.  <br>They were, if anything, too mild.  Paul's refusal to cite 90%<br>of the basically important articles on equal temperaments<br>can no longer be explained away as "oversights" or<br>"errors" or the result of being "just too busy."  After<br>a number of letters on this point, Paul continues to<br>ignore references of fundamental importance.  His<br>bibliographies continue to deceive and misdirect <br>generations of fledgling xenharmonists. Paul's<br>bibliographies are holding back the progress of<br>xenharmonics.<br>So it's time to go public.<br>Let me point out how *important* this issue is.  At<br>least one forum subscriber has stated that he wished<br>he could go back and do his doctoral thesis all over<br>again.  After studying the many hundreds of pages of<br>articles I xeroxed for him, this tuning forum subscriber<br>was *shocked* and *disgusted* at the *lack* of adequate<br>citation of microtonal articles and sources in current<br>bibliographies and current articles.<br>Paul Rapoport's bibliographies are among the very worst<br>offenders in this regard.<br>Paul is a fine researcher and a gifted composer and an<br>insightful theorist.<br>This doesn't change the fact that the bibliographies<br>in Paul's extremely insightful and valuable articles are<br>*artrociously* inadequate to the point of being overtly<br>deceptive. <br>In fact, if Paul Rapoport's articles (viz., "Some Equal<br>Temperaments are More Equal Than Others--and<br>Decidedly More Temperamental," MusicWorks 43, 1991)<br>weren't as *excellent* as they are it wouldn't matter nearly<br>as much that Paul's bibliographies are so incomplete.<br>If the article's crap, no one will pay much attention to it--<br>but Paul Rapoport's papers are *important* and destined to<br>garner many citations.  Thus there is NO EXCUSE for Paul's <br>failure to cite *most of the essential papers and the most<br>important sources* on equal temperaments.<br>Clearly, neither Paul Rapoport nor any of you will be convinced<br>by a mere *statement* of these facts.  Like mules, you've  got to<br>be *beaten* with a *two-by-four* before you wake up and PAY<br>ATTENTION to this *vitally important issue.*<br>Want to play mule?<br>Fine.  <br>As always, the members of this tuning forum refuse to listen<br>to reason. As always, I'm going to have beat you with a ton<br>of references before you wake up and recognize the truth. As<br>always, you've got to do it the hard way.<br>Fine, let's do it the hard way.  <br>I've got a two-by-four the size of Texas.  One blunt instrument,<br>coming up.  You want to play the mule, you're going to get<br>an education.<br>Consider, as a first atrocious example, the grossly deceptive<br>bibliography at the end of Paul Rapoport's article "The <br>Structural Relationships of Fifths and Thirds in Equal<br>Temperaments," Journal of Music Theory, 1994, pp. 351-<br>389.<br>Here is Paul's bibliography:<br>"Blackwood, Easley. 1982.

Berkeley: University of California Press."<br>--<br>That's it. <br>First, let's ask: "What impression of microtonality would<br>a naive reader come away with after reading Paul Rapoport's<br>article and glancing through his biblioraphy?"<br>The naive reader would conclude:<br>[1] Easley Blackwood is *the* major theorist of equal<br>temperaments.  <br>[2] Rudolf Rasch and Adriaan Fokker were important theorists<br>on equal tempered tunings.<br>[3] The bulk of the existing literature on microtonalty<br>is heavily mathematical and theoretical.<br>[4] Mathematical calculations of the size of various kommas<br>in this or that equal-tempered system offer the primary means<br>by which equal tempered tunings can be understood, and are<br>the most important properties of equal-tempered tunings.<br>--<br>*Every one of these impressions is false.*<br>In actuality:<br>[1] Well over 40% of Easley Blackwood's statements about<br>equal-tempered tunings are verifiably false.  Upward of a<br>third of his mathematical results do not apply, or are<br>irrelvant, or are taken so far out of their original Pythagorean<br>just intonation context as to be meaningless.<br>[2] Rudolf Rasch and Adriaan Fokker are minor theorists of<br>equal-tempered scales.  Rasch is primarily a psychoacoustician<br>and music historian/musiclogist. Fokker was a major theorist of<br>31-TET, but he did not investigate, did not deal with, and<br>clearly did not understand, equal temperaments other than<br>31, 19 and 53.   The reader who looks to Rudolf Rasch and<br>Adriaan Fokker to provide an understanding of 13-TET,<br>14-TET, 9-TET, 21-TET, 27-TET, 40-TET, ad infinitum,<br>is badly mistaken.<br>By contrast, Ivor Darreg was a major theorist of equal<br>temperaments.  His Xenharmonic Bulletins 5 and 10<br>described the characteristics of dozens of equal-tempered<br>systems.  Siemen Terpstra has also done important work<br>on classifying large numbers of equal temperaments, as<br>has Erv Wilson. John Chalmers has done important work<br>in describing the characteristics of some of the more<br>exotic equal temperaments (13-TET, etc).  Not to blow my<br>own horn, it remains a fact that Your Humble E-Mail<br>Correspondent has also done some  work in this<br>area.<br>[3] The bulk of the modern (post 1965) literature on equal<br>temperaments is descriptive and lucid.  Mathematics do<br>not form the main basis of modern approaches to microtonality,<br>primarily because after 1965 synthesizers were available<br>and people could actually *hear* the various equal <br>temperaments.  Thus modern xenharmonic theorists can<br>now speak about the "sound" of an equal temperament,<br>whereas this would have been impractical pre-1965 because<br>the theorist would have had to build 48+ acoustic instruments.<br>[4] It is universally acknowledged that the most important<br>characteristics of the various equal temperaments are their<br>different "sounds" or "moods" or "sonic fingerprints."  A piece<br>of music which sounds thrilling in 19-TET is apt to go flat<br>and lose its punch in 31-TET; a piece of music which sounds<br>gorgeous in 31-TET will sound denatured and dull in 22-TET.<br>And so on.  None of this has *anything* to do with arcane<br>mathematical measurements of abstract kommas, most of<br>which are illusory and inapplicable in the equal temperament<br>concerned.  For example, while it's theoretically possible to<br>calculate the closest approach to the Pythagorean komma in<br>13-TET, doing so is an utter waste of time.  13-TET has no<br>perfect fifths and therefore the difference between a stack<br>of perfect fifths and a stack of major thirds is meaningless<br>in 13-TET, and calculating such a quantity is an exercise<br>in futility.<br>It is exactly as though you were to walk through a museum and<br>listen to a respected art critic explain that the paintings of<br>Picasso's Blue Period were inferior because the red in those<br>paintings was a very washed-out and muddy hue of red. <br>"Wait a minute," you'd say,"The paintings are *supposed* to<br>be mostly blue.  They're basically blue.  That's the whole *point*!"<br>If the art critic continued to explain that there was no such<br>color as blue, that blue was merely a muddy form of red, and<br>that blue had no place in painting, you'd give up on the guy<br>and walk away.<br>Yet this is what, in effect, Easley Blackwood and his mathematically-<br>inclined ilk are telling.  All ET scales are essentially the same, they<br>can all be measured by their approximations to various just<br>kommas, and we can understand all the equal temperaments by<br>discussing the sizes of their perfect fifths, the most useful kinds<br>of quasi-Beethovenian 19th century harmonic triadic progressions,<br>etc., etc.<br>This is obviously false and clearly ridiculous. Many equal <br>temperaments do not have perfect fifths, cannot support<br>consonant triads, do not obey the conventional laws of<br>harmony and instead turn the "rules" voice-leading and<br>harmonic progression and melodic modes upside down<br>and inside out. <br>In many equal temperaments, we must throw Beethoven out<br>and learn from the Kwaiker Indians, the Javanese, or the<br>Thai xylophone tuners.   Beethovenian 19th-<br>century triad harmonic progressions are a small sliver<br>of the world's music, and it is silly to try to force the<br>infinity of xenharmonic tunings into that tiny niche.<br>--<br>Thus, *all* the impressions which the naive reader gets<br>from Paul Rapoport's biblioraphy, quoted above, are<br>verifiably FALSE.<br>Every single idea planted in the mind of an impressionable<br>reader by Rapoport's biblio will be deceptive, incorrect,<br>useless, and will lead the naive microtonalist to try<br>to compose using 12-TET-type harmonic progressions<br>and standard diatonic modes in, say, 17-TET or 19-TET<br>or 14-TET.  <br>*This is a recipe for disaster.* <br>The predictable result?<br>Any fledgling  microtonalist who reads Rapoport's <br>bibliography and seeks out ONLY Rapoport's cited <br>sources will get such godawful results when he <br>composes microtonal music according to Blackwood's <br>and Brun's and Rasch's and Fokker's prescriptions <br>that s/he will give up on microtonality in disgust.<br>I contend that this is a serious problem.<br>This is cause for SERIOUS concern.<br>And so, it's time to end this vicious circle of silence regarding<br>the most useful and the most informative sources for<br>fledging microtonalists (Darreg's writings, Xenharmonikon,<br>the ideas of Balzano and Douthett and Clough, Erv Wilson's<br>writings, etc. ,etc) *MUST* be broken. <br>Otherwise microtonality will continue to be seen as an<br>impossibly difficult mathematical abstract niche, while<br>it is in fact the most wide-open, joyous, exciting and<br>musically vibrant area of late-20th-century music.<br>The next post will get into the nitty-gritty, blow by<br>blow, of the gross inadequacy of Paul's bibliography.<br>For the rest of you who read this, remember--Paul Rapoport<br>is no exception.  YOU are just as culpable as he is.  The<br>problem of inadequate, deceptive, willfully misleading<br>bibliographies is *endemic* throughout the microtonal<br>theory literature.<br>For the sake of the next generation of xenharmonists,<br>this *MUST* change.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 18 Jul 1996 21:18 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA18837; Thu, 18 Jul 1996 12:18:42 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 18 Jul 1996 12:18:42 -0700<br>Message-Id: <35960718191653/0005695065PK4EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
