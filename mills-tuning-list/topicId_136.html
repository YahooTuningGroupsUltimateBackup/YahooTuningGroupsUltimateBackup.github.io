They sound pretty<br>>good.  Other companies have flashier technology,<br>>but Ensoniq's synths sound about as excellent as<br>>anything out there. <br><br>*Blush* thanks so much!  I actually had nothing to do with the ASR-10 since<br>I haven't been here that long, and have passed this message along to Bill<br>Mauchly and the others who made it what it is today.  <br><br>While I'm here though, there's a new synth we've just announced called the<br>MR-rack, which is the first synth shipped with my Midi Tuning Standard<br>implementation.  Both the bulk dump and note-change messages are supported,<br>and the product's been tested with JICalc on the Mac and Midi Tuning Wrench<br>under Windows.  These messages affect a single user tuning table in RAM.<br>Thanks to David Doty and Carter Scholz for assistance and feedback during<br>its development.  The only bad news is that the ASR-10 can't get an MTS<br>retrofit.  <br><br>One area which has been crying out for the note-change ability is the middle<br>east.  The keyboards there have a series of buttons which tune the<br>corresponding note down a preset interval.  We hope to have third-party<br>support for this later in the year.<br><br><br>regards,<br><br>Steve Curtin<br>Ensoniq Corp<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 31 Oct 1995 19:51 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA05606; Tue, 31 Oct 1995 09:51:52 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 31 Oct 1995 09:51:52 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199510311751.JAA05456@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
