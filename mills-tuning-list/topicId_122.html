One of the unpleasant facts of academic life (pace Brian) is that I <br>have to work more and harder this year just to keep going, which is I <br>imagine true of everyone in nearly any profession. Accordingly, there is <br>some tweaking I have to do to this font to be able to present it to <br>others which I have been unable to complete since originally mentioning <br>the font in this forum some months ago.<br><br>Forgive the delay please; it will come, and it will be 1995.<br><br>I have not actually used the font with Finale yet, but there's no reason why <br>it shouldn't work. It is simply a font (bit-mapped, Postscript, TrueType, <br>etc.). It contains 123 symbols, which should keep many people happy or <br>busy or both. More description later if anyone wants it.<br><br>Although I do not want to use this list to sell something, I will offer<br>the straight facts and not attempt to advertise it. If readers object, I<br>will not mention the font again on the list except to say it is available,<br>and then give more information to readers privately. The information will<br>probably end up on the list anyhow... <br><br>It is in a Macintosh format only, by the way. Also, I have not figured <br>out Finale's arcane goings on as have Brian and others. I have used the <br>font until now with Lime, because I can simply declare a pitch offset for <br>each accidental and have my synthesizer produce the correct pitch on <br>playback. This happens regardless of how many accidentals sit in front of <br>a note. The limit is currently 14, I think. But that's to Lime's credit, <br>not mine. Lime has some limits, as Brian mentioned; but using pitch bend <br>it enables many synthesizers to do what I described, (not using pitch <br>bend for the old FB-01). Pitch bend is not ideal, but it works for now.<br><br>==========================      =================================<br>Dr. Paul Rapoport               e-mail:	rapoport@mcmaster.ca<br>SADM (Music)	                   tel: 905 529 7070, ext. 2 4217<br>McMaster University                fax: 905 527 6793<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 26 Oct 1995 18:44 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA23693; Thu, 26 Oct 1995 09:44:39 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 26 Oct 1995 09:44:39 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199510261643.JAA23534@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
