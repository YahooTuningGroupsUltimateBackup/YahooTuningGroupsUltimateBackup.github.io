[snip]<br><br>>Well, I'll give you that (though see Jorgenson for an argument that no<br>>one really tuned accurate ETs until a century or so ago when beat rates<br>>were calculated and began to be used), but the point is that the<br>>evidence that _Bach_, specifically, used ET is tenuous to the point of<br>>nonexistence.<br><br>Hardly.  Jorgensen's thesis (that ET could never have been tuned<br>accurately and was therefore never used in the 18th century) is specious.<br>There are many, many references to tuning ET by ear in the 18th century.<br>Towards the end of the century, many practical treatises give instruction for<br>ET and don't even mention unequal temperaments!  Even if the results<br>might have been less than perfect, the intention was clear: To tune Equal<br>Temperment.  And there is no doubt in my mind that ET or a close<br>approximation was used in the 18th century. Given Jorgensen's criteria for<br>accuracy, ET doesn't exist on harpsichords in this century!  (Member of<br>this List can surely testify to the tremendous stability of most harpsichords;<br>how many times have we tuned our instruments before a concert only to<br>discover that they were out of tune again after removing the tuning<br>hammer from the last wrest pin?)<br><br>[snip, paste]<br><br>> BTW, there are only two Pythagorean ditones in Barnes' temperament.<br><br>I'm not sure whether it is appropriate to use the term "Pythagorean ditone"<br>in expressing the 81:64 or Pythagorean major third.  True, it can be<br>argued that the Pythagorean major third is comprised of two major tones<br>(9:8), and that two *tones* form a *ditone.*  But when all 18th-century<br>writers refer to the ditone, they mean specifically the just major third, 5:4.<br><br>Aleksander Frosztega<br><br><br><br>-------------------------------------------------------<br>Aleksander Frosztega     "Odi summusos; proinde aperte<br>University of Utrecht     dice quid sit quod times."<br>The Netherlands</div>
