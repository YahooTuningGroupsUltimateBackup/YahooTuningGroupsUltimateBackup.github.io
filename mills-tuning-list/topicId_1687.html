I notice that <br>the strongest ghosttone is the one I get when I touch<br>the string near the middle. Does your sequence include<br>this ghosttone?<br><br>Are you saying that there are no ghosttones at places<br>other than these fret positions?<br><br>Are you sure that the volumes of the ghosttones in your<br>series are in the same order as the series (in other<br>words that no ghosttone is louder than one earlier <br>in the series)?<br><br>Are you saying that the volume of a ghosttone some<br>number of fretted-fifths along the series is as <br>loud as the volume of a ghosttone the same number <br>of fretted-fourths along the series (for instance <br>ghosttone at fret for C# as loud as ghosttone at <br>fret for F)?<br><br>Matt Nathan<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 19 Feb 1997 12:14 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11371; Wed, 19 Feb 1997 12:14:34 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11366<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id DAA10386; Wed, 19 Feb 1997 03:11:42 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 19 Feb 1997 03:11:42 -0800<br>Message-Id: <330ADDFE.11F5@ix.netcom.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
