The group consisted<br>of: Meredith Borden, Soprano<br>    Jon Catler, Just Intonation and fretless guitars<br>    Brad Catler, Percussion<br>    Andrew Bolotowsky, Alto Flute<br><br>    Throughout the concert Jon Catler played his solidbody electric<br>with the interchangeable fingerboards (pretty nifty, there's enter-<br>tainment value right there) while Brad Catler played cross-legged on<br>the floor with tabla, dumbek, bodhran, cymbals, bells, chimes and<br>shakers arrayed around him. The choice of alto flute rather than so-<br>prano concert flute gave an added warmth to the music and left clear<br>room for Borden's soaring, mostly wordless vocalizations.<br>    The pieces spanned a pretty broad emotional and stylistic gamut,<br>with some offering an exotic lilt, some wit and humor, while others<br>evoked an undeniable sadness tied, perhaps, to the situations some<br>species are currently in.In all cases, use of the higher harmonic<br>intervals was crucial to the vocal melodies and to the sometimes bit-<br>tersweet chordings and fingerpicked arpeggios.<br>    Jon made extensive use of a phrase-repeating delay device which<br>let modal harmonic stuctures serve as a bed for real-time legato lines.<br>His slow legato work on fretless was especially striking to me; the<br>glissandos and cello-style bridge-to-nut vibrato were fresh-sounding<br>and visceral.<br>    The concert ended with maybe the most immediately accessible piece<br>of the evening,'Bird of Pray', which combined varied instrumental ex-<br>plorations with lyrics that envision an end to armed conflict.<br>    I understand that a Birdhouse CD is in process. I'm looking forward<br>to it.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  William Sethares <sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Subject:  seminar announcement in Ithaca NY<br>PostedDate:  16-02-98 16:20:06<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  16-02-98 16:19:11-16-02-98 16:19:12,16-02-98 16:17:03-16-02-98 16:17:03<br>DeliveredDate:  16-02-98 16:17:03<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C12565AD.00542351; Mon, 16 Feb 1998 16:19:01 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03919; Mon, 16 Feb 1998 16:20:06 +0100<br>Date: Mon, 16 Feb 1998 16:20:06 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03917<br>Received: (qmail 17871 invoked from network); 16 Feb 1998 07:19:03 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 16 Feb 1998 07:19:03 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199802161511.AA26478@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
