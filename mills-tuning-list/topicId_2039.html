If you've ever heard CeDell Davis play his delightfully raunchy<br>style of Mississippi hill-country blues, you know that sometimes some very<br>potent emotion can be communicated by getting as far away as possible from<br>the tuning the ear expects.

Right?  Also, couldn't<br>missing virtually all the time limit your vocabulary as surely as hitting<br>virtually all the time?  Then, too, there's always the possibility of<br>presenting a moving target.  Gets hairy, don't it?<br><br>David J.
