I'm a guitar player, a composer, I have a Mac and a Roland<br>XP-50 with a GI-10.<br>   Can you recommend any particular composers or recordings I should listen to<br>help me broaden my horizons?<br><br>   I have a specific question regarding my XP-50: it has a function called<br>*Keyfollow* which allows me to tune the keyboard using percentages.<br>   +200 gives me a 6-tone (whole-tone) scale, +150 gives me an 8-tone scale (the<br>negative values reverse the keyboard), and if I tune the proper pitches 50 cents<br>sharp (or flat) I get a diminished scale. It's very interesting (and fun) to<br>take something like a Bach midi file and listen to it using one of these<br>tunings.<br>   +120 gives me a 10-tone scale.<br>   +50 gives me a 24-tone scale.<br>   Now, +70 gives me a 17-tone scale, +40 gives me a 30-tone scale, +30 gives me<br>a 40-tone scale, and +20 gives me a 60-tone scale. With these tunings, though, I<br>can't really tell (I guess my ears aren't good enough yet) how accurate the<br>octaves are, and I don't know how to figure it out mathematically. Can anyone<br>tell me how accurate these octaves are, just from the *numbers*, and are these<br>um legitimate or *actually used* scales (I've heard of 17-tone, 24-tone, and I<br>think 31-tone scales?)?<br>   Excuse my ignorance of proper terms, thanks for the help, and do these scales<br>have proper names? Is there maybe a good book someone can recommend that would<br>explain a bit about *microtonal harmony*?<br><br>   P.S. Mr. Haverstick (sp?), I've heard of you. Don't you have some guitars<br>that are um fretted differently to allow you to play *microtonally*? I live here<br>in beautiful Westminster - when and where might I be able to hear you play some<br>music on some of these instruments, and where might I check one out?<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 8 Aug 1996 01:52 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14805; Thu, 8 Aug 1996 01:52:05 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14850<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id QAA21798; Wed, 7 Aug 1996 16:52:52 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 7 Aug 1996 16:52:52 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199608072352.RAA23531@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
