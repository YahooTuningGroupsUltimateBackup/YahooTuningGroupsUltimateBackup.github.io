Parts of the <br>piece were in 12, parts in 19. Of the two major themes, <br>one is in 12 harmonized by 19, while the other is in 19 <br>harmonized by 12. In addition, the two themes used a <br>different relationship between the 12 and the 19, i.e., you <br>have a wide range of choices of how the two are tuned <br>relative to each other. Probably the simplest way is to let <br>them have a note in common, but this is not necessary. <br>One of the themes had a common tone, but the other I just <br>tuned "by ear." I never went back to figure out exactly <br>how they are tuned relative to each other, but I'm sure <br>they didn't have any notes in common.<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 11 Mar 1996 13:59 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id EAA28002; Mon, 11 Mar 1996 04:58:32 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 11 Mar 1996 04:58:32 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9603110746.A9698-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
