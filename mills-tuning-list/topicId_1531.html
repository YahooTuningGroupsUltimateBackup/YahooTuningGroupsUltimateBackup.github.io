Szanto&#x22; &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/1997 11:12:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>To Adam (and other mbira fanciers...):<br><br>Jonathan Glasier has at least one impressive mbira (microtonal), and I<br>believe it was made not by him, but one of his colleagues here in San<br>Diego.  They might have insights into both construction and materials, as<br>they have built a few of them (to my knowledge).<br><br>Re: Bruce and Matt (and the composition/improvisation dialogue):<br><br>There are even larger issues here, if one cares to think about it.  I find<br>value in both sides, but if one is to show the inheirent superiority of a<br>'new' system (alternate tunings), might it not have more power if it is<br>carefully crafted to illumine those new-found strengths, rather than rely<br>upon the Muse striking at just the right time (we all know that even the<br>best improvisors don't have a great night every time!)?<br><br>On the other hand, if one creates an entire sound-field in a new<br>intonation, where all of the instruments share the same intonational<br>resonance (my mind wanders to modern [possibly Western] gamelans), then<br>improvisation in that setting might 'show' the listener the beauty (or<br>ugliness) of a particular tuning, without the need for a carefully worked<br>out harmonic scheme.<br><br>That said, where is this music going?  Aren't we all aware that the *only*<br>reason there was the slightest blip upward in sales of classical recordings<br>was accounted for by all of the cross-over and compilation discs last year?<br> There can be no doubt in anyone's mind: the audience for carefully-hewn,<br>artfully crafted, what might be loosely called 'classical' music is<br>**dwindling**.  All the new groups, with new hair and attitudinal<br>transplants (Bang On A Can, Icebreaker, Kronos, etc.) - they may sell a few<br>discs and get some press, but this too shall pass.<br><br>And does anyone, even Neil, think that by refretting guitars and switching<br>intonations he is going to draw crowds the way KISS did last year?  Are the<br>audiences driven by a popular format ready, willing, *capable* of<br>acknowledging any 'superior' intonation?  Do they want the 'new'?  Do they<br>want the 'experimental'?  More to the point: do the record companies (the<br>bastards!)?<br><br>Or maybe we enter the age (or re-enter) of the amateur, in the truest and<br>most wonderful sense, where the only reason is to make *music* - not<br>converts, not money, not careers, not ?<br><br>Make music.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br><br>[BTW: I haven't been sending the tuning list updates about the Partch site,<br>but I've added material over the last few weeks - stop by.  I now have a<br>link to the tuning list, and a few of the people signing the guestbook have<br>indicated interest in tunings; I sent 'em to you kids...]<br>*------------------------------------------------------------------*<br> Jonathan M.
