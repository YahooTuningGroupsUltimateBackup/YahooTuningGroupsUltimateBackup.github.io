Three-valved brass instruments are actually seve=<br>n<br>natural horns sharing<br>a bell and a mouthpiece. The valves are usually tuned to lower the open<br>horn by multiples of<br>equal-tempered semitones (1st valve by 2 semitones, 2nd by 1, third by 3;=<br><br>actually it might have been more flexible if the third valve lowered by 4=<br><br>but this seems to place horns below the optimal diameter to length ratio =<br>-<br>the more valves added, the weaker the sound). So the fundmentals of the<br>tones produced by all combinations of valves are set to 12tet. The lips<br>buzz at or near positions on a harmonic series, but the actual form of th=<br>e<br>tubing can influence this and the designs of individual manufacturers<br>reflect this fact. An easy demonstration of this is available on the<br>trombone: insert the mouthpiece in the separated bell joint. With the<br>dimensions now largely conical, it becomes virtually impossible to blow a=<br><br>harmonic series (I say virtually, because I do know some players who can<br>lip up or down at least a fifth in any position).<br><br>On the other hand, in altissimo register - and on the early buzzed-lipped=<br><br>woodwind cornett and serpent (the theoretical astrophysicist William<br>Matthews, a virtuoso cornettist, called the cornett ''a physicist's worst=<br><br>dream'')  - the fingering is often more a matter of psychology than<br>physics. The higher one gets, with increased density of partials, the mor=<br>e<br>alternative fingers are available. While several of these alternatives<br>(starting with the written bb1 on the trumpet) suggest intonational<br>variants, most players can and do lip these pitches into the prevailing<br>temperament. I have found, however, that while these alternative fingerin=<br>g<br>cannot be depended upon to trigger particular frequencies they can be use=<br>d<br>to assist the player psychologically into lipping a pitch away from the<br>typical value.<br><br>The mouthpiece can be an addition factor in intonation.
