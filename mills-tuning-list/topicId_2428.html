Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/1997 8:43:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Distortion creates a massive spectrum of combination tones, which will<br>converge to minimum density when they form a harmonic series, which<br>happens if the notes being played have a small integer frequency ratio.<br>Open fifths and fourths and even major ninths are common in distorted<br>guitar music since their 12-tet approximations are close to just. 12-tet<br>thirds sound quite ugly through distortion and so require careful<br>bending (in the absence of crazy Jon Catler JI fingerboards), a fact<br>clearly understood (though perhaps not consciously) by good blues and<br>rock musicians, including David Gilmour. A typical move is to bend the<br>lower note of a perfect fourth or major third up until the interval<br>reaches a just minor third (usually functioning as the third and fifth<br>of a major chord or the fifth and seventh of a minor seventh). When<br>playing blues, I also like to bend a minor third below the root up to an<br>8/7 below the root while holding the root (or major second!) on the next<br>higher string. When the interval in exactly in JI, the root (several<br>octaves lower) materializes out of the noise of the distortion.<br><br>All distorted chords sound better on my 22-tet guitar than my 12-tet<br>guitar, except for open fifths, especially when stacked to form major<br>ninths. Distorted dominant seventh and ninth chords on the 22-tet guitar<br>remind me of Jon Catler and not of anything else I've ever heard (Neil<br>Haverstick tends to use the diatonic rather than harmonic seventh on his<br>19-tet guitar), aural proof that 22-tet is a very significantly better<br>approximation of 7-or 9-limit JI than 12-tet.<br><br>However, if we're talking melody rather than harmony, blues scales seem<br>to sound best to me in 7-tet (playing blues on an Ensoniq harmonica<br>patch in 7-tet, no one thought it sounded out-of-tune, just bluesy).<br><br>Can anyone give me any advice towards formulating 22-tet fingerings for<br>flute? I don't play flute myself, and none of my flute-playing friends<br>have any microtonal experience.<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gregs@mail.usyd.edu.au<br>Subject:  Writing Csound from Scala1.3<br>PostedDate:  24-09-97 17:45:58<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  24-09-97 17:45:38-24-09-97 17:45:39,24-09-97 17:44:44-24-09-97 17:44:44<br>DeliveredDate:  24-09-97 17:44:44<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C125651C.0056920F; Wed, 24 Sep 1997 17:45:34 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA28878; Wed, 24 Sep 1997 17:45:58 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 24 Sep 1997 17:45:58 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA28871<br>Received: (qmail 7857 invoked from network); 24 Sep 1997 15:45:15 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 24 Sep 1997 15:45:15 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.93.970918182832.4157A-100000@extro.ucc.su.OZ.AU><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
