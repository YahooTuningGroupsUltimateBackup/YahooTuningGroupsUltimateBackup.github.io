We have<br>an aesthetic disagreement here, but nothing worth arguing about.<br><br>Now, Mr Gibson on the other hand:<br><br>> Graham Breed said:<br>>> Exactly what are you trying to say, Gregg?  You come up with an<br>>> "undeniable" argument, and then deny it!  Or, am I<br>>> misunderstanding?  To my ears, these chords are certainly more<br>>> concordant than their constituent dyads.  Three examples are quite<br>>> enough to disprove that little theory.<br>><br>> I mean, for example, if you add a fourth note to the triad 4:6:7, e.g.<br>> 4:6:7:8 or 4:6:7:12 you very often get an undoubtedly dissonant chord.<br>> 4:6:7:8 is dissonant because of 8:7, 4:6:7:12 is dissonant because of<br>> 12:7. This is what I mean when I say the senario (i.e. the consonant<br>> chords of the senario, the least consonant of which are more consonant<br>> than the least disssonant septimal chords) are consistent with<br>> themselves, while the septimal chords give rise to dissonance when a<br>> fourth tone is added.<br><br>Gregg, I'm getting sick of this.  I say a chord has a degree of<br>consonance because of its sound, and you tell me it is a dissonance<br>because of one of its intervals.  I have justified my viewpoint,<br>and you have simply ridiculed it.  You have never given any clue as<br>to what these chords sound like, and therefore what property of that<br>sound you consider to be dissonant.  Neither have you given a<br>definition of dissonance.  As you began the discussion, the onus<br>is on you to explain what you mean.<br><br>You _have_, it is true, said that you do like 7-limit chords.<br>However, the fact that you advocate a tuning in which they are<br>poorly approximated deserves explanation.<br><br>In this particular case, you have not answered my point.  Look<br>carefully.  I did not say any chords were consonant.  I said<br>thay were more consonant than the worst of their intervals heard<br>as a dyad.  Do you agree?<br><br>If you add F# to the 5-limit triad C-E-G, you get an undoubtedly<br>dissonant chord.  The 7-limit is special in that adding an octave<br>can sometimes dramatically affect the sound of a chord.  However,<br>you have never said this.<br><br>FWIW, 3:4:6:7 sounds more consonant than 4:6:7.  4:6:7:8 is clearly<br>more dissonant than 4:5:6:8, but is much less so than the triad<br>6:7:8.  Do you agree?<br><br>> For what it is worth, I find the septimal triads 4:6:7 and 4:5:7 more<br>> 'major' in effect than 'minor', but definitely dissonant. I have heard<br>> them in many different temperaments, but of course the just versions are<br>> the standard.<br><br>I've already said that a binary consonant/dissonant argument will get<br>us nowhere.  I find that a small amount of tempering (ie, 41 equal)<br>can improve the sound of these chords.  Do you agree?<br><br>> There are excellent acoustical reasons for supposing the septimals<br>> dissonant.   Musical dissonance and consonance are not absolutely<br>> relative, but must remain to the physical constraints of nature if they<br>> are to have any artistic meaning.<br><br>Gregg, PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!! stay with in the constraints of the English<br>language!  The terms "absolute" and "relative" are diametric opposites.<br>What on earth does "absolutely relative" mean?  What are these<br>acoustical reasons, and what are the physical constraints that I<br>am violating?  Or, are you again making unspecific accusations of<br>straw men?<br><br>> By such reasoning one could argue that 15:8 is consonant, because 48:25<br>> is even rougher. Your argument is therefore evidently invalid.<br><br>Paul Erlich's argument is not in the least invalidated.  He did not<br>declare any chord to "be" consonant.  His argument is, in fact,<br>very good.<br><br>To move away from music for a paragraph.  Gregg has stated Paul's<br>tone to be "insolent" in this discussion.  I, on the other hand,<br>feel Paul has very patiently attempted to make Gregg see the<br>omissions and inconsistencies in his argument.  Gregg's attitude<br>in the exchange, however, I find to be highly offensive.  He has<br>never considered Paul's ideas, as published on the Internet, and<br>I suggest he has not even read that paper.  It would be a simple<br>courtesy for Gregg to spell Paul's surname correctly.  I make these<br>points in case Paul's modesty or civility prevent him from doing so<br>himself.  While I'm at it, to state that a tuning system is<br>"useless" is offensive to people who use that tuning system, and<br>who place value on their aesthetic judgements.  I have certainly<br>been offended by much of what Gregg has said.<br><br>> The '5-limit' and '7-limit' habit of thought can be very dangerous if it<br>> is not carefully borne in mind that each include very different<br>> intervals and chords, with different effects. I have heard people wrap<br>> themselves in knots trying to 'hear' 9:7 as consonant because they got<br>> it into their muddled heads (I was one of them, boy have I had some<br>> strange notions) that it somehow had something to do with the 'consonant<br>> 7-limit'.<br><br>Which, of course, it does not, as it is only a 9-limit interval.<br>I have taken care not to step outside the Partchian 7-limit.  I<br>have also made clear distinctions between 7-limit chords.  I'm<br>not saying stupid people can write 7-limit music, simply that it<br>deserves exploration.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  neuwirth <neuwirth@smc.univie.ac.at><br>Subject:  multimedia product about historical tunings<br>PostedDate:  20-12-97 17:03:23<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  20-12-97 17:01:22-20-12-97 17:01:23,20-12-97 17:00:57-20-12-97 17:00:57<br>DeliveredDate:  20-12-97 17:00:57<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256573.0058008C; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 17:03:09 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22734; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 17:03:23 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 20 Dec 1997 17:03:23 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22668<br>Received: (qmail 26936 invoked from network); 20 Dec 1997 08:03:19 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 20 Dec 1997 08:03:19 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Chameleon.882632996.neuwirth@polya.neuw.univie.ac.at><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6751 href="#6751">ðŸ”—</a>alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)</h3><span>12/20/1997 4:00:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I have tried to remain silent, allowing the wave of Gibsonia to wash by<br>(perhaps even depositing a few valuables), at least when the discussion<br>dealt with the arcana of 19 vs. 22 or some such thing. But I have a hard<br>time letting this pass:<br><br>Gregg Gibson:<br>>There are excellent acoustical reasons for supposing the septimals<br>>dissonant.   Musical dissonance and consonance are not absolutely<br>>relative, but must remain to the physical constraints of nature if they<br>>are to have any artistic meaning.<br><br>Why must a musical value be absolute to be artistically meaningful?<br>Loudness is certainly relative and a spectrum of values. Timbre is relative<br>along many different axes. In painting, brightness, saturation, and, of<br>course, the spectrum itself change by degrees, in addition to altering the<br>perception of each other in context. While there have been some great<br>painting using only black and white, I would go so far as to claim that the<br>parameters of media are most valuable BECAUSE they are relative.<br><br>It makes no difference to me personally whether you call a 7/6 consonant,<br>dissonant, assonant, or Gibsonant (tm). A 7/6 is a 7/6, and it has a<br>particular quality to me that is quite beautiful in a lot of music. It is<br>certainly not discordant and has no particular compulsion to resolve, to my<br>ears, though that, too, may depend on the musical context. An<br>equal-tempered minor seventh has no need to resolve when used in blues<br>piano music, at least to me. (If you hear its function unchanged from<br>Mozart, then I can understand why you might dislike blues piano.)<br><br>Nor do dissonances always have to resolve. To insist that they do would rob<br>us of the spice and wonder of Perotin, Bartok, Ligeti, and certain<br>Bulgarian folk music. Likewise, insisting that a melody must be singable by<br>amateurs (presumably those trained in the Western tradition, because<br>Indonesian singers from childhood find the near-septimal intervals of<br>slendro no problem) is an arbitrary constraint that would rule out much of<br>Beethoven, Debussy, even rock and jazz. A universe of music of the type<br>that Mr. Gibson seems to advocate I would find a much poorer place indeed.<br><br>Even if I were to concede that Mr. Gibson's conclusions derive entirely<br>from physical facts as he claims, and not from a selective combination of<br>acoustics and certain highly debatable and subjective premises about the<br>nature of music, I would still not accept his conclusion that music must at<br>least approximate the path that he has found in order to be at all<br>artistically successful or profound. Does this mean that I have a<br>terminally open mind? I hope so. Does this mean that I like all music<br>equally and uncritically? Of course not.<br><br>I have encountered many times and can even understand those that believe<br>that art is ultimately objective, and that anything that fails to fulfill<br>those objective criteria is "bad art." What offends me, and, I think,<br>others on this forum, Mr. Gibson, is the implication that anyone who does<br>not arrive at your conclusion either has not examined your evidence, is<br>incapable of logical reason, or is intentionally perverse. Or perhaps you<br>will condescend to express understanding of the unenlightened masses who<br>still effect the same muddled thinking and wrong ideas that you once did<br>because of the influence of either the evil hegemony of 12TET or the<br>aforementioned intentionally perverse xenharmonicists.<br><br>Music to me is not about following acoustical norms. It's about exploiting<br>one's (learned or intuitive) knowledge of acoustics, psychology, and<br>culture towards artistically expressive ends. Sometimes that means working<br>"with" or sometimes "against" acoustics, but thank goodness that human<br>expression is so rich that it can provide us with truly moving art in such<br>a wide variety of musical systems.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
