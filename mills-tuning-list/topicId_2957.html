Crystaline lattices are, once again,<br>>>generated by electron attraction and repulsion, which again is conveyed by<br>>>photons.<br>>>...... So sound is, at this otherwise not very interesting sub/atomic<br>level,<br>>>ultimately conveyed by photons.  The invention of a new particle, the<br>>>phonon, seems to be no more than a pointless complication that side-steps<br>>>well-accepted physical models for no apparent reason.<br><br>Phonons are the quanta of the normal vibrational modes of a crystaline<br>lattice. If you were immersed in a crystaline lattice (didn't this happen<br>on Star Trek?) the displacement of ensembles of molecules (a lattice<br>wave) would correspond to sound, and if you were another molecule in that<br>lattice, your interaction with the phonon would quantized. Thus molecules<br>experience quantized 'musical pitches'. Just as relativistic effects are<br>only noticable at incredibly high velocities, quantization of frequency<br>is only noticable at very high frequency and/or small scale. Our ears,<br>capable of hearing, at best, a 66 cent pitch difference ;-), would never<br>be able to detect quantum effects. Phonons can be thought of as<br>particles of fixed energy and momentum that move with the<br>ensemble velocity of the lattice wave (they also work in<br>continuous media calculations). Using the idea of a particle with<br>these properties, one finds that phonons interact in<br>many ways like the particles we use to imagine thermodynamic physical<br>process, and thus are a convenient mathematical fiction, like photons,<br>electrons, etc. for describing measured phenomena.<br><br><br>John Starrett<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
