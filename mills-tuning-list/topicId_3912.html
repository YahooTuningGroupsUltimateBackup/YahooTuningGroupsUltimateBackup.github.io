Not surprisingly, to say that it's faster would<br>be an understatement to say the least!<br><br>   It's pretty darned quick alright, and that even with no "backside cache",<br>the G3's claim to fame.  And on top of that, the G3 PowerBooks aren't all<br>that much more expensive than comparable PC laptops - a little more<br>expensive, but not much.  Now that's mostly because there's no "generic" PC<br>laptop business to speak of (or none that I know of).  Laptops are dominated<br>by name brands, and thus name-brand prices.  Desktop machines Pentium II<br>machines, on the other hand, are probably going to be cheaper than desktop<br>G3 machines, since you can get non-name-brand desktop PCs.<br><br>   I hear that there have been some early problems with the various audio<br>sequencer plugin formats, and hardware as well, not quite working on the G3<br>machines.  I don't personally know much about that, since I haven't upgraded<br>my desktop machine yet, but I hear that it won't be long before the problems<br>are solved, if they aren't already.</div><h3><a id=8375 href="#8375">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/1998 12:17:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Somehow I copied Dan Wolf E-Mail adress wrong and lost his new adress.<br>please send<br>        Kraig Grady</div><h3><a id=8376 href="#8376">ðŸ”—</a>David Griffel &#x3C;D.Griffel@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/1998 6:32:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Sun, 16 Aug 1998 20:30:43 +0100 (BST) tuning@eartha.mills.edu wrote:<br><br><br>> <br>> the URL for AudioMulch is <http://www.codanet.com.au/audiomulch/?<br><br>Will this (or other) software allow me to take input from a simple <br>(several years old Casio) MIDI keyboard and play it in alternative <br>temperaments (meantone, Vallotti, etc. etc.)?  <br><br>I know essentially nothing about Midi and music software, apart from <br>using a notation program which has  midi input/output.
