Schlosberg. 1943. "Octave <br>Generalization, Pitch Discrimination and Loudness Threshold in the White <br>Rat." J. Experimental Psychology 33: 407.)  <br><br>I have been exchanging email with James Murray, a cognitive <br>neurobiologist <br>at UCSD who has done studies of hearing in animals. He was kind enough <br>to do a quick & dirty literature search for recent papers on octave <br>generalization. The most relevant of the half dozen or so are those <br>below (the others mainly refer to starlings and dolphins, which are, <br>perhaps, not the primary audience for xenharmonic music):<br><br>" Sergeant, Desmond. "The octave: Percept or concept." Psychology of <br>Music, 1983, v11 (n1):3-18.<br><br>"Abstract: Investigated octave generalization in 90 4-9 yr olds by means<br>of responses to matching tasks based on judgments of similarity. In E<br>PI, 54 Subjects, presented with 5 tone bars differing in pitch within an <br>octave range, were asked to match a 6th bar to 1 of the 5 bars. Results <br>indicate a significant tendency for tonal similarity to be judged as <br>proximity of pitch. In Exp II, the probability of judgment on the basis <br>of pitch proximity was reduced by providing an array in which the 5 <br>tones were clustered together in pitch. In Exp III, 36 Subjects were <br>asked to arrange 2 sets of 5 tone bars each so that the arrays were <br>similar. Although a few Subjects completed the task, no significant <br>ability <br>to solve this octave transportation task was found. It is concluded that <br>a concept of "octaveness" is developed experientially and is not of <br>perceptual origin.<br><br><br>"D'Amato, M. R.; Salmon, David P. "Tune discrimination in monkeys <br>(Cebus apella) and in rats." Animal Learning & Behavior, 1982 May, <br>10(n2):126-134.<br><br>"Abstract: Six 10-18 yr old monkeys and 8 female albino rats were trained <br>on an operant discrimination employing structured auditory stimuli (tunes).<br>Rats acquired the tune discrimination very rapidly and considerably faster<br>than monkeys. Both species generalized the discrimination across <br>intensity <br>and octave transformations. Discriminative performance remained at a high<br>level when only the 1st halves of the tunes were presented, but <br>substantially less generalization occurred to the 2nd halves. Rats <br>trained <br>with tones (broken or steady) required 3-4 times more training to reach<br>criterion than did the rats trained wth tunes. The potential of <br>structured auditory stimuli for investigations of information-processing <br>mechanisms <br>is pointed out. "<br><br>While the experimental designs, criteria, and stimuli were undoubtedly<br>very different, it appears that female rodents perceive octaves more <br>readily than apes and human children. The evolutionary and aesthetic <br>implications of these findings are somewhat unclear to me.<br><br>Anyway, does anyone know of any extant musical culture which does not<br>recognize octave equivalence (including stretched or shrunk octaves)?<br>The only counter-examples I can think of might be Eastern Orthodox chant,<br>which is sometimes based on chains of tetrachords or divided fifths.<br>Some Russian chant may be based on chains of divided thirds, but, of course,<br>the octave may still appear among the intervals and choruses may still<br>double in octaves. Some Andean panpipes seem to be tuned to an additive <br>scale, yet the pipes themselves overblow in octaves rather than twelfths <br>due to their deliberate and unusual construction. Does anyone have more<br>specific (especially contradictory) information? (Enrique?)<br><br>--John</div>
