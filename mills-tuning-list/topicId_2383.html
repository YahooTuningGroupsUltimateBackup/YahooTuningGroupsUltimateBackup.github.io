I did just read<br>the words of Ali Akbar Khan in his book (forgot the title); he said that<br>(paraphrased) he might have 23 1/2 srutis if he felt like it. Of course,<br>the point seems to be that there are many positions for a note depending<br>on the effect desired...not a big surprise, and again I must note the<br>similarities between this approach and my own experience with blues; same<br>deal, and this is a subject that a student must learn to feel on his<br>own...string bending is tough.<br>   On a related subject, and this is surely not a "scientific" study, I<br>have noticed in my dealings this last year with folks who play music from<br>other cultures, with non western tunings, that they seem to know very<br>little about the subject of tuning, period...it seems to be more<br>intuitive than anything else. Examples...I met with a koto player today,<br>and took a lesson. She is quite talented, but was totally in the dark<br>about the harmonic series, and how Japanese tunings differed from<br>western...she does know they are different, but not the technical<br>details. I met 2 sitar students recently, and neither one had a clue<br>about tunings...in fact, one insisted that ragas could all be played in<br>12 equal...hmmm. Finally, I saw a very good Filipino gamelan orchestra,<br>and played some of the instruments, and got to talk to the leader as<br>well. He, too, was rather vague on the tuning subject, and was not able<br>to offer more than the opinion that the instruments were tuned in the<br>range of the human voice, and that he thought there were 7 tones in the<br>scale...again, no hard technical info, more the intuitive side.<br>    I will continue to meet and hang with folks from all over the world,<br>and learn what I can about their culture and music...it seems, perhaps,<br>that the performers of a music are less concerned with the decimal points<br>than the final result...I would like to hear comments from others on the<br>forum about their similar experiences.<br>    As to Reinhard's summer music camp adventures, what a hoot to imagine<br>polymicrotonal ditties around the campfire...I think reaching "ordinary"<br>folks in this manner is exactly where it's at, and is what will help non<br>12 tunings to become a part of our culture, rather than to be thought of<br>as some weird, esoteric stuff for the egghead crowd...Hstick<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl<br>Subject:  RE: tuning of the 2nd sruti<br>PostedDate:  12-09-97 07:36:49<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  12-09-97 07:36:45-12-09-97 07:36:46,12-09-97 07:36:07-12-09-97 07:36:08<br>DeliveredDate:  12-09-97 07:36:08<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256510.001ED2CA; Fri, 12 Sep 1997 07:36:40 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA27236; Fri, 12 Sep 1997 07:36:49 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 12 Sep 1997 07:36:49 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA27228<br>Received: (qmail 13862 invoked from network); 12 Sep 1997 05:30:36 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 12 Sep 1997 05:30:36 -0000<br>Message-Id: <C125650F.002CD6FD.00@notesrv2.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6072 href="#6072">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;Manuel.Op.de.Coul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/1997 1:57:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I wrote:<br>> B.
