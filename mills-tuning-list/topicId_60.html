Good title.<br><br>>Stenger does not think QM is necessary to explain consciousness<br>>or other mental activities. .... For quantum effects to <br>>be important, the product mvd should be of the same order as<br>>PC. <br><br>It's certainly an open question, and that is a good argument, but<br>is it compelling?  If, after only a hundred years or so of the<br>study of electricity, we can amplify a tiny, tiny radio signal to<br>produce a tv picture, or detonate a nuke, could not millions of<br>years of evolution have generated the ability to amplify quantum<br>effects up to the level of ions.<br><br>>... why not also in the Liver and other organs where<br>they are also prominent?<br><br>Why not?  Human waste disposal technicians have brains, it's not<br>only white collar workers who are gifted with the ability to<br>think.  Information processing capacity of some kind would<br>certainly seem to lend a survival advantage to single celled<br>organisms.<br><br>>The other point raised in your post is speed. The brain<br>>is a massively parallel computer, so while the speed of each<br>>element is low, the ensemble can carry out an enormous number of<br>>operations per unit time.<br><br>Perhaps a more compelling argument for the quantum theory is the<br>ant brain.  They hardly have two neurons to rub together, but I<br>think we have yet to produce aggregates of silicon that can match<br>their computational capacities.<br><br>I am intrigued by the quantum theory, but I am not convinced.  I<br>am also not convinced that it is wrong.<br><br>Note that the question of how much information is transferred<br>when an ion is exchanged between two cells can be important even<br>if we assume quantum effects are not important in thought.  If<br>the position in the cell membrane at which an ion is emitted<br>encodes information, then the information transfer between cells<br>could be vastly more subtle that simple on/off pulses caused by<br>large numbers of ions being exchanged.<br><br>Thanks for your post.<br><br>Marion<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 2 Oct 1995 14:26 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id FAA07033; Mon, 2 Oct 1995 05:25:58 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 2 Oct 1995 05:25:58 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.BSD/.3.91.951002222214.4233A-100000@shell02.ozemail.com.au><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
