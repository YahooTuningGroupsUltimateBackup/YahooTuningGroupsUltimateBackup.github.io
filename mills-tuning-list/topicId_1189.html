It<br>is vivid to hear the point of furthest harmonic remove in the development<br>of a classical sonata when this is also the least well tuned portion of the<br>keyboard. Of course, music through 1812 or so is normally composed with a<br>closer homology between keyboard tuning and harmonic structure than later<br>music, but the landmark works of late romanticism (i.e. after Chopin) are<br>almost exclusively orchestral. (And the best late romantic literature for<br>the piano was written for instruments with Viennese construction, which<br>have a much lighter frame). My reading of Jorgenson is quite different in<br>that I take _Victorian Tunings_ to be an indication of the continued<br>inability/undesireability to get 12tet exactly. These tuning coincide with<br>the earliest accurate measurements of actual tunings, which show clearly<br>the appreciable deviations from 12tet. Moreover, there is a<br>well-established sense of key characteristics that is not explainable on<br>the basis of pitch height - which varied considerably - but must be<br>explained largely on the basis of intonation. (I distinguish these key<br>characteristics from the pitch characteristics used by Skryabin and Hauer<br>in the 20th century - which are solely based on pitch height).<br><br>(2) It would be a great service to the tuning community at large if someone<br>were able to take a frequency counter into a WestLAMusic / Sam Ash sort of<br>store (or better yet, to a music trade fair) and actually measure the<br>tuning resolution of commercially available instruments and digital tuners.<br>I would do it here, but German music store owners tend to be unfriendly<br>about questions _already answered_ in the handbooks.<br><br>Daniel Wolf  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 19 Nov 1996 09:42 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17266; Tue, 19 Nov 1996 09:43:48 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA17468<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id AAA13575; Tue, 19 Nov 1996 00:43:45 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 19 Nov 1996 00:43:45 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v02140b00aeb70ec65090@[164.67.22.183]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
