My typology was not complete. <br><br>The previously described puns must be found in a succession of chords in<br>order to project the various readings of a pun. Some single sonorities,<br>however, are self-sufficient puns.<br><br>3. Vertical puns:<br><br>(a) In temperaments, there are some collections of pitches which are going<br>to heard ambiguously (when heard ''tonally''). These are something like<br>those optical illusions which flip-flop between perceived images.<br><br>(b) A similar flip-flop may obtain in Just Intonation between chords that<br>are ambiguously harmonic or subharmonic. <br><br>I recall that somewhere in _Finnegans Wake_ (that wonderful book of puns)<br>is an appropriate phrase: ''My herrings, the surdity of it all!''  David<br>Antin has spoken/written about the centrality of puns to the work of Marcel<br>Duchamp ('' a pun is a pendulum oscillating between meanings, therefore<br>Duchamp was a futurist''). One key to Mozart's tonal charm was his use of<br>puns with surprising disambiguations; Stravinsky was constantly using<br>cadential puns to toy with the listeners' expectations. An element of<br>levity is certainly missing in much serious new music, but both Stravinsky<br>and Mozart could count on an audience immersed in tonality: I wonder if we<br>can expect an audience nowadays to listen closely enough to catch such<br>puns? <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 14 Jan 1997 21:01 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14576; Tue, 14 Jan 1997 21:04:26 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14610<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA05329; Tue, 14 Jan 1997 12:04:15 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 14 Jan 1997 12:04:15 -0800<br>Message-Id: <55970114175655/0005695065PK4EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
