They certainly do not sing<br>> 436-cent major thirds, which occur repeatedly in the melodic texture of<br>> 22-tone equal, unless very flat fifths of 655 cents are employed. Of<br>> course the centre of 22-tone equal in India is nowadays supposed to be<br>> the South.<br><br>No Indian theorist I've read ever claimed 22 equal has anything<br>to do with Indian music.  Some mention a 22 note scale, but<br>most emphasise that it is _not_ equally tempered.<br><br>One of the features of traditional Indian thinking is a lack<br>of historical sense, so everything is considered as the<br>present and obsolete ideas are not highlighted as such.<br>South Indian theorists, though, do make a much bigger point<br>of the 22 srutis.  I haven't seen any quantitative research<br>on the pitch perception of South Indian musicians.<br><br>As there is no modulation in Indian music, 436-cents thirds<br>will never arise, even if you follow Gregg's highly suspect<br>argument.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed) <br>Subject:  Re: 31-tone equal melodic progression<br>PostedDate:  13-12-97 14:35:17<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  13-12-97 14:33:17-13-12-97 14:33:18,13-12-97 14:33:00-13-12-97 14:33:01<br>DeliveredDate:  13-12-97 14:33:01<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656C.004A73E1; Sat, 13 Dec 1997 14:35:09 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14469; Sat, 13 Dec 1997 14:35:17 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 13 Dec 1997 14:35:17 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14468<br>Received: (qmail 4062 invoked from network); 13 Dec 1997 05:34:01 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 13 Dec 1997 05:34:01 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.348362@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
