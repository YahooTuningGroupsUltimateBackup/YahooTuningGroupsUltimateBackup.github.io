Keislar suggests that "Partch might have been<br>inspired by his reading of Meyer (1929), who depicts a <br>similar diamond on page 22 " of Max Meyer's 1929 book<br>"The Musician's Arithmetic."<br>Can anyone confirm or deny this?<br>--<br>The Innova Release 2 4-CD set of Partch recordings boasts<br>a cover photo of Partch with the adapted viola and an<br>instrument I've never seen before--the Monocordion.<br>It looks like a version of Partch's 1932 circular-key<br>ji keyboard mapped onto an accordion. <br>Does anyone know anything about this instrument?<br>Any sources available on it?<br>Partch mentions nary a word about the Monocordion<br>in "Bitter Music," the 1933 "Exposition of Monophony,"<br>or any other material I've been able to find. <br>--<br>Gary Morrison objected to my posted statement "therefore,<br>naturally, no one has written an article on the tunings <br>between 5 and 11 tones per octave."  Gary pointed out that<br>he has written a number of articles about 10-TET.  <br>My statement should have read "therefore, naturally, no has<br>written an article on all the tunings between 5 and 11 tones <br>per octave as a group."  <br>This set of tunings forms an obvious "island" of equal temperaments<br>separated from the main body of divisions of the octave usually<br>discussed by music theorists.  It seemed surprising to me<br>years ago, and still seems astonishing, that no one else has<br>penned a monograph on this clearly distinct group of equal<br>temperaments.<br>Thus Gary Morrison and Yaws Twuwy are both correct.<br>--<br>Some weeks back, Thierry Rochebois asked for citations<br>of composers who'd combined different tunings in a<br>single composition.  It turns out Allen Strange wrote<br>a string quartet with a tape part circa 1980. "I just<br>finished a piece which was premiered in December, a<br>string quartet, and it dealt with simultaneously seven, twelve<br>nineteen and twenty-five-tone equal temperament, as<br>closely as players could come to it, being kept in tune<br>by a tape..." ["Interview: Allen Strange," Ear Magazine<br>West, 8(3), May-June 1980, pg. 1]<br>No doubt there are bezillions of other composers who've<br>nonchalantly combined different tuning systems but<br>who haven't bothered to let anyone know.<br>How about posting on this forum?  How about letting<br>the rest of us know, folks?<br>--<br>Gary Morrison stated recently that he judged this tuning<br>forum a place for recitations of personal experience<br>in microtonality, rather than for citations of the literature<br>on the subject.<br>Permit me to suggest that both are necessary and appropriate.<br>Without citations, this tuning forum would degenerate into<br>a C.B. radio-type chat line..."Breaker breaker, we got a cool<br>tuning comin' up on the left!"   Without descriptions of the<br>personal experiences of the participants, this tuning forum<br>would degenerate to the Perspectives of New Music level<br>(shudder).<br>--<br>To emphasize my point about the MIDI tuning standard,<br>this quote from Jim Cooper in January 1986 article<br>in "Keyboard" magazine:<br>"Since MIDI is not part of some police state decree,<br>there are differences in implementation. These are <br>mostly too esoteric to explain here, but they can<br>definitiely cause communications problems when<br>two devices are MIDIed toegether. Like most other<br>people, I refer to MIDI as a "standard," but for it<br>to really be a standard would bring up severe legal<br>problems of an anti-trust nature. (...) So MIDI<br>is a specification for a method of interfacing, not<br>a law.  Exactly which parts of the specification <br>actually find their way into a given instrument or <br>device depends on complex tradeoffs that the<br>engineering and marketing departments of each<br>manufacturing company must decide on." <br>Exactly the same point applies to the MIDI tuning<br>dump specification.<br>So the next time someone on this forum claims,<br>"Wow, I just read that such-and-such synthesizer<br>will have a tuning precision of 1/800,000 of a cent!"<br>blow it off.  <br>It's nonsense.<br>We're lucky (alas!) to have the 1024  parts per <br>octave given us by Yamaha and Ensoniq.<br>Incidentally, my point here is NOT that Yamaha<br>and Ensoniq are horrible folks for giving us "only"<br>1024 parts per octave tuning resolution--this <br>resolution is completely adequate for any musical<br>applications I can think of.  The point is, rather, <br>that people on this tuning forum ought to stop<br>wasting their time mooning around for some<br>super-accurate tuning resolution and instead<br>get off your rears and use the equipment we've<br>got.  A number of microtonal theorists who won't<br>be mentioned continue to mope & sulk and refuse<br>to compose in exotic scales with modern digital<br>synths because the "tuning accuracy is inadequate."<br>C'mon, people, remember the Nike commercial:<br>"JUST DO IT."<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 4 Jun 1996 19:25 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id KAA18096; Tue, 4 Jun 1996 10:25:21 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 4 Jun 1996 10:25:21 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.960603092824.51739A-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
