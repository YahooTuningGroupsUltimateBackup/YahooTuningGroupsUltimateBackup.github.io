But you don't say much on<br>>what means you used to search this tunings.<br><br>A computer. Is there anything else that seems ambiguous?<br><br>>>Well, the only real problem in ET's over 34/oct is that consistency is<br>>>not really relevant anymore, since there might be an adequate<br>>>approximation for a given interval which is not the closest<br>>>approximation.<br><br>>This is the real meat of my question about the 1% thing.  What does it mean<br>>"adequate"?  Certainly you don't claim that all scales over 35 sound alike...<br><br>No, certainly not alike. But I guess I should have said something in the<br>paper about how in 12-tone equal temperament there is one and only one<br>way of approximating any consonant ratio, and that is a property that<br>adds a degree of simplicity that  musicians mayt be happy to give up.</div>
