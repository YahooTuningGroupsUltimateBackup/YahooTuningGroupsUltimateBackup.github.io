Is it possible to subscribe<br>>to the tuning list without the McLaren items?<br><br>I think you'll have to content yourself with the hiatus between<br>Brian's bouts of intemperate ranting [i.e. while he's off in his<br>little lair imagining American musical academia by reading<br>back issues of PNM at the public library and carefully crafting<br>straw persons whose burning provides the heat necessary to<br>warm his dish of bile]. Now that he's back to pointing out to<br>us all why he isn't wrong about anything and fulminating at<br>a world which doesn't recognize either his genius or his bias<br>set [cue quantized track composed of a sulky bank of cryptocellos<br>in 11-limit JI] *and* now turning his lordly gaze on the wonders<br>of the web with precisely the same witlessness he brought to bear<br>on the notion of canonicity, the season has begun anew. Isn't<br>it enough that we've had a brief season of relatively high<br>content Brian?<br><br>Ignoring him only encourages his more delusional episodes.<br>I am noticing a marked rise in grumbling about la Brian's<br>new batch of stuff - has dissing the boy moved from those<br>funky littie SoHo clubs to Lincoln Center, so to speak?<br><br>And by the way, as an obligatory nod to those 'orrible<br>Modernists who constantly bombard us with the dreaded<br>mindbogglizer radiation from their U.N. black satellites,<br>I've actually found some recent Petey Boulez that I *like.*<br>Horrors! It's the recent release of "Explosante/Fixe" on<br>Deutsche Gramaphone. Those of you who've found those<br>spectral boys of some interest [P. Hurel, D. Cohen, T.<br>Murail] will, I think, be somewhat pleasantly surprised<br>by what seemed to me to be a stronger sense of colour and<br>a bit of playfulness - to say nothing of some harmonic stuff<br>that sounds positively *consonant* in moments. Speaking as<br>a non-Modernist, I'm actually going to be playing the thing<br>for my radio listeners - it's that good. I understand that<br>DG is also finally going to be putting out "Repons" sometime<br>next year, as well, so we'll all have easy access to some<br>canonical Modernist Cabal stuff in glorious CD stereo.<br><br>Oh yeah - remember that I mentioned going to the Table of<br>the Elements festival in Chicago last weekend? I forgot to<br>mention - Tony Conrad's "Four Violins" (dating from his<br>days with LaMonte Young in the early 60s) has been released<br>by them on vinyl, with a rumoured CD version to follow soon.<br>In the meantime, you can content yourself with the vinyl<br>*and* "Slapping Pythagoras," also on TotE.<br><br>Microtonally yours,<br>you-know-who<br><br>_<br>I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,<br>paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only<br>maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it.
