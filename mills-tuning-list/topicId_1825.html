Functional <br>distinctions only exist within a relational system. Now if Beethoven had <br>been speaking of pitches within a piece, or even of keys arrived at by <br>means of modulation within a piece, then such a system would have <br>provided the context for talk of functional distinctions. But Beethoven <br>was talking about Db major and C# major in vacuo, as the tonics of a <br>piece, and therefore outside such relational systems, and so not <br>amenable to functional distinctions. What else is left if we cannot <br>distinguish the keys on grounds of acoustic difference (as is the case <br>in WT or 12TET), nor on the grounds of notational-functional <br>distinctions? Again, I offered the other possibility in previous <br>messages -- arbitrary associations of keys with various pieces, <br>instruments etc (I'll put synaesthesia in this category too: while <br>individuals, such as Messiaen, feel their associations to be necessary, <br>each synaesthesiac differs). Beethoven's statement would seem to fall <br>firmly into this last category.<br><br>So if not acoustic differences, nor notational-functional differences, <br>nor arbitrary associations, then what?<br><br>Obfuscation, nothing else.<br><br>By the way, if anyone can locate the Beethoven quotation, I'd be <br>grateful.<br>-- <br>Jonathan Walker<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br><br><br>--------------6FB25C3305--<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 12 Mar 1997 15:18 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03127; Wed, 12 Mar 1997 15:17:57 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03125<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id GAA05046; Wed, 12 Mar 1997 06:15:33 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 12 Mar 1997 06:15:33 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703121410.JAA06232@phyleus.interlinx.qc.ca><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5083 href="#5083">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>3/14/1997 2:26:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com><br><br>>Following up Paul Erlich's suggestion, I have computed<br>>the LST SQR positive tunings with 7/6 and 5/3 in addition<br>>to 3/2, 5/4, and 7/4.<br><br>I would also include 7/5.
