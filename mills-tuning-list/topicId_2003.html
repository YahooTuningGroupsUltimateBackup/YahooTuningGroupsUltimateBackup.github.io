Do you know the exact title of the book and the full name<br>of the author, plus eventually the publisher and the year it was published."<br><br>If anybody here knows this book, I would appreciate hearing from you. <br><br>And where is B. Mclaren??   He was writing some of the most interesting stuff<br>here on this list.  Does he know that?? <br><br>Regards, <br>Ed Foote<br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 4 May 1997 12:38 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04049; Sun, 4 May 1997 12:38:15 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04035<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id DAA20640; Sun, 4 May 1997 03:36:38 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 4 May 1997 03:36:38 -0700<br>Message-Id: <336C65E4.4D98@online.no><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5395 href="#5395">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>5/4/1997 7:45:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Would somebody help me in explaining the differences between playing in<br>>Justatonic mode and Pythagorean mode?<br><br>   Sure.<br><br>   First of all, "Justonic" is a trade name of Justonic Tuning, Inc., in<br>Canada.  Their name comes from the idea of "Just Intonation", which is the<br>general concept you're undoubtedly asking about.<br><br>   Just Intonation is not any single tuning really, but instead a general<br>principle for choosing pitches, based upon making their sound-wave<br>frequencies in simple whole-number relations to one another, like 2:1 for<br>octaves, 3:2 for perfect fifths, 5:4 for major thirds, and many others.<br><br>   As with "equal temperament" and "meantone", "just intonation" also<br>carries a historical meaning, which is a subset of the more recent,<br>generalized meaning.  The major-scale tuning for the historical subset<br>meaning (example in C):<br><br>      C      D      E      F      G      A      B      C<br>     1:1    9:8    5:4    4:3    3:2    5:3   15:8    2:1<br><br>   This tuning came later, in Western culture anyway, than the<br>"pythagorean" tuning of:<br><br>      C      D      E      F      G      A      B      C<br>     1:1    9:8   81:64   4:3    3:2   27:16 243:128  2:1<br><br>   So that is the distinction between "pythagorean" and "just", even though<br>pythagorean is in fact just, since it's built upon whole-number ratios,<br>although 243:128 would hardly qualify as a "simple" whole-number ratio,<br>which is of course part of the reason why it evolved into 15:8 in most<br>scenarios.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>>How can one learn to play in these modes without using electronic<br>>equipment?<br>>Is there any valid models used in learning how to use your ear to<br>>recognise these different modes?<br><br>   It doesn't take a huge amount of effort for most competent and motivated<br>musicians to learn to hear new whole-number pitch relationships, although<br>it's deadly critical to bear in mind that how easy it is to hear them<br>depends greatly on how they're used.  Well, it depends on the same factors<br>that playing in tune in any tuning depends upon:  whether you're paying the<br>notes melodically or harmonically, how fast the notes are going by, and<br>such.<br><br>   Probably the best way to get used to hearing these new pitch<br>relationships is a combination of mimicking pitch relationships from<br>recordings or electronic aids of whatever sort, and then try them out for<br>yourself, listening to beat rates in sustained chords.  As you get a feel<br>for those beat rates, you simultaneously will get an increasingly more<br>secure feel for recognizing those intervals by their melodic pitch<br>distance.<br><br>   Johnny Reinhard and his "AFFM" troopers routinely play a wide variety of<br>tunings on traditional acoustic instruments, Johnny himself mostly on<br>bassoon, using alternate fingerings.<br><br>   Also with regard to nonelectronic instruments, lots of people<br>investigate new tunings by refretting guitars and other strings.  That<br>works really well for a lot of people, and for certain styles of music.<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 4 May 1997 16:54 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04233; Sun, 4 May 1997 16:54:15 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04146<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id HAA23230; Sun, 4 May 1997 07:52:28 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 4 May 1997 07:52:28 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01541106af920c880116@[207.207.3.174]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
