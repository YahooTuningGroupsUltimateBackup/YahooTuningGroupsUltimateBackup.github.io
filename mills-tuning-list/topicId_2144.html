I would thus take these<br>figures with more than a grain of salt, and would by no means accept these<br>figures as a definitive representation of Thai practice. In my most recent contacts with mainland southeastasian musical instruments<br>(Thai, Cambodian and Laotian), I have heard very accurate 7-tet tunings. In<br>fact, I spoke last Winter with a Laotian Khaen maker and player (now living<br>in France) who said that he used a digital tuner and that he had both sent<br>cassettes with his instruments and tuners back to Laos where other makershad duplicated his tunings or adopted the use of the digital tuners.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 14 Jun 1997 18:27 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22360; Sat, 14 Jun 1997 18:27:25 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 14 Jun 1997 18:27:25 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22361<br>Received: (qmail 23623 invoked from network); 14 Jun 1997 16:27:19 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 14 Jun 1997 16:27:19 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541104afc81fd87197@[207.207.3.183]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5648 href="#5648">ðŸ”—</a>alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)</h3><span>6/17/1997 12:06:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Charles Lucy wrote:<br>>Lydia Ayers queried the use of the scale x/y/z notation.<br>>I agree with her implied criticism of the ambiguity of this system.<br>><br>>I have used it for many years, yet to mean something totally<br>>different, and much more precise than the vague current Alves usage.<br>><br>>I tackled Bill on this recently, off-list, and he provided a<br>>(to my mind) lame justification for his continued use of the<br>>pattern, which was originally devised in about 1989 by John Gibbon,<br>>Jonathan Glasier and myself in Los Angeles and widely distributed<br>>in pamphlet form.<br><br>Just to set the record straight, Charles Lucy originally wrote me the<br>forwarded email to respond to a post in the context of defining pitches in<br>some modes as subsets of tuning systems.

Three numbers separated by slashes seemed an<br>understandable way to do it. I included obvious qualifications and had no<br>intention to try to express the actual tuning of these modes.<br><br>I also told Charles Lucy that I found the Lucy/Gibbon/Glasier system<br>interesting (if largely unrelated to the point of my post), but that I<br>doubt that all tuning systems or modes could or should be defined in terms<br>of MOS scales.
