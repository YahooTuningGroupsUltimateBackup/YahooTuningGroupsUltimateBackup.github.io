E.g. 3 1 3 1 3 1 has only four different<br>>transpositions, because transposed by 4 steps it's unchanged.  (You can<br>>create such a scale because 4 is a divisor of 12.)  OTOH, in 19TET it's<br>>impossible to create such scales, because 19 is prime.<br><br>Yeah, it seems like this is more like it.  Thanks again, Paul!<br><br>>From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com><br>>Carl Lumma wrote,<br>><br>>>If we can agree that there is a difference between re-tuning music made for<br>>>100 cent equal, as powerful a model and good-sounding a tuning as it is, and<br>>>playing music made for 7+ limit Just Intonation, however embellished,<br>><br>>I agree! That's why I'm more interested in 22-tet than 19, 31, or<br>>50-tet.<br><br>Whoops!
