I've always thought of 4:6:7 as fairly<br>> self-content, but 4:5:7 is most likely dissonant.  (Then again dissonance<br>> is context-related whereas discordance is not, but that's a different<br>> discussion altogether.)<br><br>However, I did actually specify 31 equal, where the situation is<br>more complicated.  In lieu of Gregg Gibson discovering why, I'll<br>respond to his other points:<br><br>> The perfect fifth 3:2 is comprised of the minor third 6:5 and major<br>> third 5:4. This in turn means that the consonant chords of the 3-limit<br>> and those of the 5-limit are congruent, that is to say, they can exist<br>> together without producing dissonant intervals.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is taking a feature of 5-limit and<br>turning it into a principle.  I don't buy it.<br><br>> But when we reach the septimals, we find that the perfect fifth 3:2 is<br>> comprised of 7:6 and the undoubtedly dissonant 9:7. The other possible<br>> septimal bisection of the fifth, 8:7 and 21:16, also includes an<br>> undoubted dissonance (21:16) although the closeness of 8:7 makes it too,<br>> undoubtedly dissonant.<br><br>Yes, bisecting the fifth is a bad idea with septimals.<br><br>> Now a chord with one dissonant interval, is dissonant. Someone may try<br>> to deny this, but I am afraid he will fail.<br><br>I believe your fears are unjustified.<br><br>> There do exist a few septimal triads that seem to escape this argument,<br>> e.g. 5:6:7, 4:5:7, 4:6:7. But a few triads do not begin to compare with<br>> the richness and variety of the harmonies of the senario.<br><br>Exactly what are you trying to say, Gregg?  You come up with an<br>"undeniable" argument, and then deny it!  Or, am I<br>misunderstanding?  To my ears, these chords are certainly more<br>concordant than their constituent dyads.  Three examples are quite<br>enough to disprove that little theory.<br><br>What is "the senario(sic)" supposed to mean?  If 5-limit<br>consonance, we are talking about 6 triads within the octave --<br>3:4:5, 4:5:6, 5:6:8, 1/3:1/4:1/5, 1/4:1/5:1/6 and 1/5:1/6:1/8.<br>Granted, septimal chords don't work well in inverted forms with an<br>8/7. However, I am prepared to admit the utonal versions.  That<br>gives us ... 6 chords.  So, we've doubled the number available<br>from the 5-limit.<br><br>> If follows that the septimals, even if one admits them to be weakly<br>> consonant - which I do _not_ - certainly give rise, for the most part,<br>> to undoubtedly dissonant chords. They have only the most tenuous<br>> relation with the harmony of the senario, which on the contrary, forms a<br>> closed, well-ordered system.<br><br>There is certainly doubt as to the first statement.  Unless you<br>consider all chords containing a septimal interval, when it is<br>true but septimals are no different to quintals in this respect.<br>There is no question that the 7-limit is a different sonority to<br>the 5-limit. Why this is an argument for rejecting 7-limit<br>consonances is beyond me.  Well-ordered systems are really<br>dreadfully early 20th Century.<br><br>> All this was observed centuries ago. Mersenne is full of highly<br>> ingenious arguments regarding the septimals - nihil sub sole novum.<br><br>My ignorance on the subject prevents me form getting into a<br>historical discussion.<br><br>> So today, some people still take it as a personal<br>> insult if an interval they fancy is called dissonant, and - very<br>> absurdly - try to make consonance and dissonance purely relative ideas<br>> with no basis in physics.<br><br>Certainly, consonance and dissonance are relative concepts.  By<br>which I mean that a chord is only consonant or dissonant relative<br>to another chord.  Why is this absurd?<br><br>> But I - just as about 99% of all the Western musical theorists who have<br>> ever lived - do really hate and wish to banish a certain narrow class of<br>> dissonances - those which are so close to consonances that they beat<br>> badly, but yet are melodically confounded with the consonances.<br><br>Well, that's Western musical theorists for you.  Do these include<br>the people who advocated 12 note well temperaments?<br><br>We're clearly going to get nowhere in a consonance/dissonance<br>argument.  I will, however, make the following assertions.<br>7-limit chords have a character which makes them closely akin to<br>5-limit consonances.  7-limit chords are sensitive to tuning and<br>so, if they are to be used, they must be considered in choosing<br>a temperament.  A well tuned 4:6:7 chord fulfils all the usual<br>criteria of concordance.  Some 5-limit chords, spread over more<br>than an octave, sound frankly dissonant -- see Helmholtz for more<br>on this.  In the right circumstances, a 7-limit chord can function<br>as a consonance.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed) <br>Subject:  Pythagoreanism<br>PostedDate:  19-12-97 18:47:23<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  19-12-97 18:45:14-19-12-97 18:45:15,19-12-97 18:44:50-19-12-97 18:44:50<br>DeliveredDate:  19-12-97 18:44:50<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256572.00618509; Fri, 19 Dec 1997 18:47:06 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18869; Fri, 19 Dec 1997 18:47:23 +0100<br>Date: Fri, 19 Dec 1997 18:47:23 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18103<br>Received: (qmail 10395 invoked from network); 19 Dec 1997 09:46:39 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 19 Dec 1997 09:46:39 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.522598@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
