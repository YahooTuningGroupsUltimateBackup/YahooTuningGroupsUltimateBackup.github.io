Dean <br>Drummond and company need to wake up<br>and smell the latte.  Johnny Reinhard should<br>have access to every instrument Drummond<br>has.<br>Now, 1 of the performances about which members<br>of the British Harry Partch Society had<br>questions was a recording done by Ted<br>Mook and a professional singer.  This is the<br>first CD appearance of Partch's Li Po Songs,<br>and the first new recording in more than<br>half a century (to my knowledge).<br>I think it's fantastic that someone had the<br>time, the energy, and the dedication to record<br>Partch's Li Po Songs.  <br>So what if the recording doesn't sound like Harry<br>Partch?<br>Harry himself pointed out that he was far from<br>an ideal vocalist.  In places Harry's pitch wanders<br>as much as 20 to 30 cents from the target notes,<br>as Ted Mook has pointed out.  Partch was under<br>pressure when he made his recording, he didn't<br>have adequate time or opportunity to rehearse<br>and certainly didn't have access to the enormously<br>helpful digital pitch references we have today.<br>In short, Partch did the best he could at performing<br>his Li Po Songs on that old 78 rpm record, but <br>Partch just wasn't a professional singer.<br>Ted Mook's project uses a professional singer,<br>and to my mind the results are neither better nor<br>worse than the original Partch recordings--they are<br>*different.*<br>So?<br>What's the problem?<br>Why shouldn't we have a bunch of *different* versions<br>of Partch's music?<br>Where's the harm in that, provided the pitches are<br>correct?<br>As long as the pitches are scrupulously retained and<br>Harry's music isn't edited, expanded or (ye gods!)<br>translated into 12-TET or some such abomination...<br>Why *not* rearrange Harry's music for other<br>instruments?<br>In particular, certain members of the British Harry<br>Partch Society have been up in arms about the<br>recent Kronos Quartet arrangement of Partch's<br>"Barstow" intoned by Ben Johnston.<br>This is just incomprehensible to me. <br>What in the world is wrong with arranging Partch's <br>music for different instruments?  After all, Dean<br>Drummond did exactly that when he arranged <br>Partch's "Two Studies On Ancient Greek Scales"<br>for flute and zoomoozaphone.  To these old ears,<br>the results sounded wonderful.<br>For that matter, another arrangement of those<br>same pieces was done for just intonation guitar,<br>this time by John Schneider.  You can hear it<br>on the CD "Just West Coast."<br>It sounded just fine.<br>If *these* arrangements of Partch's music<br>weren't a problem, why should the Kronos <br>Quartet's arrangement be a big deal?<br>The other issue here is that if we demand that<br>*all* performances of Partch's music be<br>done *only* on original Partch instruments,<br>then that's going to limit the performances<br>of Partch's music to just about nothing.<br>I mean, c'mon, people!  Dean Drummond adn<br>Danlee Mitchell are the only two people on<br>the planet who have Partch's instruments<br>in their possession.  So that means that<br>only two (count 'em, 2) people on the planet<br>can give concerts of Partch's music if we<br>insist on absolute fanatical authenticity<br>and *never* allow Partch's muisc to be<br>arranged for other instruments.<br>In particular, I see no problem at all with<br>the idea of using synthesizers for some of<br>Partch's music--as long as the synthesizers<br>produce creditable imitations of Partch's<br>instrumental timbres, and as long as the<br>synths are tuned to Partch's scale, and as<br>long as the parts are played correctly.<br>To insist that *only* instruments produced<br>by Partch himself be used in performances<br>would be to lock Partch's music away from<br>the public.<br>In my judgment, it's infinitely better for *lots*<br>of people to hear synth versions of Partch's<br>music, or string quartet versions of his<br>music, or a zoomoozaphone-and-flute version<br>of Partch's music, than for only a tiny few<br>people who live in upstate New York to hear<br>the Absolutely Authentic Real Thing.<br>Ideally, of course, there would be many copies of<br>Partch's instruments, plenty of Partch-trained<br>instrumentalists, and so on.  But we live in the<br>real world.<br>Given real-world constraints, isn't it better to<br>hear *more* of Partch's music in *more* venues,<br>than less?<br>--mclaren <br><br><br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Topic No. 6<br><br>Date:         Fri, 12 Jul 96 16:47:45 PDT<br>From: Allen <STRANGE@SJSUVM1.sjsu.edu><br>To: Folks <tuning><br>Subject: Performing Harry<br>Message-ID: <199607122357.QAA04009@eartha.mills.edu><br><br>Folks:<br><br>I agree whole-heartedly with Brian about access to Harry's music and<br>commented about that in a recent post about Kronos' recording. Some years ago<br>I began an "electronic" orchestration of the same work with Partch tuned MIDI<br>instruments and my own voices which emmulated Harry's timbres. About half way<br>through I thought I might get the blessing of Danlee Mitchell and rang him<br>up. His comments were that I was ignoring the "corporeal" visions Harry<br>had about performances- although I didn't agree with this in the case of<br>Barstow (I think I might agree in the case of some of the big pieces) I did<br>Danlee and Harry's memory the courtesy of terminating the project. After<br>hearing Ted Mook's recording and Ben's Barstow transcriptions-  now let's see<br>if I can find those old files!!!!<br><br>Cheers-<br>       Allen<br><br>=========================================================================<br>|                          Allen Strange                                |<br>|            http://www.music.sjsu.edu/Music/strange.html               |<br>|_______________________________________________________________________|<br>| Electro-Acoustic Music     | International Computer Music Association |<br>|        Studios             |        2040 Polk St., Suite 330          |<br>| School of Music            |        San Francisco, CA 94109           |<br>| San Jose State University  |VOX + (408) 395-2538 Fax + (408) 395-2648 |<br>: 1 Washington Square        |      Email: icma@sjsuvm1.sjsu.edu        |<br>| San Jose, CA 95192-0095    |      URL http://coos.darmouth.edu/       |<br>| Telephone +(408) 924-4646  |          ~rsn/icma/icma.html             |<br>| Fax +(408) 924-4773        |     We hope to see you at the ICMC96     |<br>| <strange@sjsuvm1.sjsu.edu> |         On the Edge in Hong Kong         |<br>|                            |         ICMC96@cs.ust.hk for info        |<br>|=======================================================================<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Topic No. 7<br><br>Date: Fri, 12 Jul 1996 23:15:29 -0400<br>From: Mmcky@aol.com<br>To: tuning<br>Subject: Calculating the time it takes patterns to repeat in chords<br>Message-ID: <960712231529_433213215@emout18.mail.aol.com><br><br>I want to thank Paul for comments on LCM.<br><br>His posts helped me to arrive at my present belief<br>that chords need to be normalized before their<br>LCMs represent the time it takes the pattern they make to<br>repeat.<br><br>Now that I have begun to get over the shock of getting a job<br>and moving to San Jose, I have some small amount of time<br>to devote to music again.<br><br>I have done the following computations for some chords with<br>low LCMs.  Because of having to do this in ASCII, I have<br>resorted to putting numbers at the head of the columns of<br>the table.

Several suggestions have been<br>made - all of them a compromise of some sort, but perhaps different<br>compromises suit different circumstances. My thanks for all of those who<br>have toaken th time to think about the subject.<br><br>The 10-hole single reed diatonic harmonica (known as Richter, after its<br>designer) has twenty reeds - a blow reed and a draw reed to each hole. The<br>blow reeds form the series of notes:<br><br>C  E  G  C  E  G  C  E  G  C  E  G<br><br>The draw reeds are arranged to give s full diatonic scale in the mid-range<br>of the harp, but omit and/or duplicate certain notes to give a C and a G<br>chord in the lower octave for accompaniment and to keep the C major triad as<br>blow notes.<br><br>D  G  B  D  F  A  B  D  F  A<br><br>Traditionally, the chord ws tuned as a just G dominant 9th (the F being a<br>septimal seventh above the G. This sounds great in the G domintant chord,<br>but very flat in melodies. To compromise, it was later tuned as a<br>Pythagorean seventh above the G. This sounded nicer when the DFA triad was<br>played, but the F-A interval was a rather rough sounding Pyth M3rd; so if<br>you used these two notes to suggest a subdominant chord, some unpleasant<br>combination tones were produced. More recently, because the issue of being<br>in tune with other musicians was raised so often (harmonica players<br>wondering why their instruments were "flat" intstead of wondering why the<br>other instruments were in the compromise of 12TET!), there has been a<br>tendency to tune the F even sharper, in some cases getting close to a just<br>Dm chord, but this mkes the G7 almost unbearable. In many cases, the Es and<br>Bs were also tuned a bit higher (midway between just and 12TET). There are<br>other commonly used tunings (I have a collection of about 100, but most of<br>these are far from "commonly used"), based on modal rearrangemnts of this<br>set. For example, the harmonica minor. The blow notes are a repeaing Cm<br>triad and the draw notes are tuned:<br><br>D  G  B  D  F  Ab B  D  F  Ab<br><br>Traditionally, this series was tuned as 8/10/12/14/17 - again some of the<br>individual intervals sound a little rough, but as this harp is hardly ever<br>played in anything other than Cm, that's not much of a problem. Blues and<br>country-style players usually use a C harp to play in the key of G (cross<br>harp), oso to get a major scale out of this position (as the modes are caled<br>in harp-speak), the "country tuning" was developed, which is the same as the<br>standard Richter, but raises the F to F#. This presents not problems with<br>intonation (the F# is a perfect 5th above the B, a pure M3rd above the D, a<br>pure m3rd below the A, etc.) Also, there is the natural minor (again based<br>on the C harp, but the natural minor scale starts from the G). The blow<br>notes are a Cm triad and the draw notes thus:<br><br>D  G  Bb D  F  A  Bb  D  F  A.<br><br>Again, this tunes justly with no real problems - it's one of my favorites<br>because of the perfect 4ths and 5ths you can doublestop (and how well it<br>lends itself to BbM as well as Gm). The chromatic beast I have described<br>earlier - as I have pointed out, it's problem is the Dm6 chord produced by<br>the draw notes. The usual way around this is 12TET.<br><br>Phew! There you have it - the history of the harmonica's tuning. Various<br>other approaches have been tried (including so-called "spiral" tunings,<br>which spreads the scale out into a 13th chord, for example the blow notes<br>could be:<br><br>C  E  G  B  D  F  A  C  E  G <br><br>and the draw notes:<br><br>D  F  A  C  E  G  B  D  F  A<br><br>This seems to lend itself rather well to various meantone ideas.) Other<br>designs have used something like a slide chromatic to produce a "perfect"<br>diatonic (as one of you suggested), but these have not met with much success.<br><br>I hope this is of interest to someone out there!<br><br><br>Pat Missin.<br><br>"...my music's a lot better than it sounds!"
