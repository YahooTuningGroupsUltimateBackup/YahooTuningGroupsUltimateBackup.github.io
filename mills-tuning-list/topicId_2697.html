To David B...I certainly agree about 43 and 49 note<br>scales, but even Catler told me he can only play in 3 keys (I hope I<br>didn't misquote). I do like a lot of modulation at times...my piece<br>"Mysteries," on my new CD, has 54 different chords, and no real key<br>center. Also, I have the feeling, and perhaps I could be wrong, that<br>bebop oriented stuff would be really tricky in just tunings...I have re<br>written Coltrane's "Giant Steps" for 19 tone tuning...if that would be<br>possible in just, than I think I have had the wrong impression about just<br>tunings all along...from what I understand, eq temps evolved precisely to<br>play music that modulated a lot (Bach), and the trade off is less purity<br>of tuning for increased compositional flexibility. Also, a smaller number<br>of notes/octave is sure helpful when you have a lot of chords. Although I<br>am working on chordal pieces on my 34 tone guitar, it's a real bear<br>because of the teensy frets...especially at brisk tempos, which I also<br>like....the ji/eq situation is likely to be an ongoing discussion, which<br>we can all hopefully learn from...Hstick<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Re: Woodwinds<br>PostedDate:  29-11-97 08:22:32<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  29-11-97 08:20:54-29-11-97 08:20:54,29-11-97 08:20:51-29-11-97 08:20:52<br>DeliveredDate:  29-11-97 08:20:52<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125655E.00285AEF; Sat, 29 Nov 1997 08:20:47 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02010; Sat, 29 Nov 1997 08:22:32 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 29 Nov 1997 08:22:32 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02008<br>Received: (qmail 1358 invoked from network); 28 Nov 1997 23:22:28 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 28 Nov 1997 23:22:28 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541103b0a4fe98237f@[207.207.2.68]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
