Here's an <br>oversimplified description.  A pure vibration like that of a tuning <br>fork is a simple smooth "sine wave" of frequency 440, say.  A more <br>"jerky" vibration of frequency 440 is mathematically equivalent to the <br>combination of smooth sine waves of frequencies 440, 880 etc., the <br>bigger the component of the overtones, the more complicated is the <br>resulting waveform and the "richer" is the sound.  The way that the <br>vibration is set up determines what sort of waveform it gives, and <br>hence determines the timbre.<br><br>Basic books on musical acoustics will explain this with diagrams, much <br>better.  perhaps the Just Intonation web site has book references?<br><br>David Griffel<br>-------------<br>School of Mathematics,    email d.griffel@bris.ac.uk<br>University Walk,          Tel. 0117 928 7983<br>Bristol, BS8 1TW,         Fax  0117 928 7999<br>England.</div><h3><a id=8273 href="#8273">ðŸ”—</a>Dr_Orient &#x3C;jma9183@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/1998 8:36:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>  <Nangaku@aol.com> wrote:<br>><br>> Can somebody in this forum help me understand the concepts of overtones and<br>> tone color?

The simplest acoustic timbre (to my knowledge) is that<br>of the flute, which approaches a pure sine wave (fundamental). A vibrating<br>string, on the other hand, vibrates along its entire length (1/1, the fundamental<br>pitch), half its length (1/2, giving the octave), a third of its length (1/3, an<br>octave and a fifth), a fourth (1/4, two octaves), and so on (Pythagoras had some<br>very nice discussions on this subject). Different string materials, means of<br>excitation (such as a bow or the hammers of a piano), tension, and other factors<br>(such as the presence or absence of a mute on a viola, or bray pins on a harp,<br>for example) influence how loud (roughly speaking, how great the amplitude) any<br>given overtone will be in relation to the others. It is the balance or proportion<br>of loudnesses of all the individual overtones that determines the timbre of a<br>sound, whatever the source or medium of that sound might be  it might be a<br>vibrating string, a column of air, a speaker set in motion by an electronic<br>signal, etc.    Incidentally, it is because the ratios of vibration of overtones<br>get progressively more complex the higher up the overtone series one goes that we<br>have the eternal invention of different systems of tuning and their resultant<br>aesthetic and scientific debates (like many that are found in this very digest!).<br>Some of the more theoretically learned contributors can clarify these points<br>better than I (I'm certain I detected a more than a few cringes at my<br>over-simplifications), but hopefully this can begin to help.<br>All The Best,<br>Dr_Orient</div><h3><a id=8280 href="#8280">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/1998 1:44:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Dr_Orient wrote:<br><br>> You're on the right track.

Almost all flute tones have a LOT of<br>overtone content.  As with most winds, they have more overtone content in their<br>lower register, and less in higher registers.  I'll attempt to ftp to where anybody<br>who's interested can find it, a GIF file of a spectral decomposition of a flute<br>tone.<br><br>   A tuning fork is however, indeed pretty much a sinewave, which means that a<br>"Rhodes"-style electric piano should be too.  After the attack transient, a<br>vibraphone and glockenspiel have almost all of their energy in just two or three<br>overtones, but they have a huge amount of wildly nonharmonic overtone content during<br>the attack transient.</div><h3><a id=8282 href="#8282">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;manynote@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/1998 6:52:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Wed, 22 Jul 1998, John Starrett wrote:<br>> It is not so much that rich tones are composed of a fundamental <br>> frequency and its overtones as that they can be decomposed this way. <br>[snip]<br>>               Joseph Fourier figured out how to add up cosine and sine <br>> waves, which are mathematical representations of the the simplest kinds of <br>> sounds, to obtain any type of periodic function whatsoever, [snip]<br>> 	Describing a complex waveform in terms of its decomposition into a <br>> sum of sine and cosine waves whose frequencies are simple multiples of <br>> the fundamental (such as A 440) is useful, but not necessary, for <br>> describing a tone and understanding why a waveform looks and sounds as it <br>> does.<br><br>There's been much excellent discussion on this topic already; I'd just<br>like to interject that the reason Fourier-type decomposition of periodic<br>waveforms is useful is because we believe that the inner ear does<br>something very similar, therefore it tells us something significant<br>(_pace_ Brian, not _everything_) about how we would hear such a sound.<br><br>--pH <manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu> http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote<br>    O<br>   /\        "Churchill?
