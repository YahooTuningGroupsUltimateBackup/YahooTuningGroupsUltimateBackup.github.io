This is a compromise between accurate tuning over the <br>whole neck and ease of setting the bridge piece (comparing the pitch of <br>the open string or octave harmonic to that of the string fretted at <br>the octave can be done by ear). I know of no realistic way to build a guitar <br>that has <br>correct stretching compensation over the whole neck, but if you lay the <br>frets out with no compensation for stretching and adjust the bridge to <br>give correct pitch in the area you expect to play in most (rather that <br>at the octave), you will probably be quite satisfied with the results. <br>	There are a few builders working on computerized retunable guitars, <br>so that the artist can quickly change string tension, but these are not <br>currently operating well enough for discriminating users. Certainly a <br>guitar could be built in which the position of the bridge pieces were <br>quickly adjustable to account for stretching at different locations on <br>the neck (servo or stepper motor control or some mechanical linkage), but <br>this seems like overkill for a relatively small problem. When a guitar is <br>well set up (proper neck relief, nut height, bridge height, string guages,<br>etc), the standard octave compensation is surprisingly good. <br>	Also, please do not consider movable nut pieces to compensate for <br>string stretch. The nut should have the same function as a zero fret, and <br>if it is accurately placed and set it will act as a zero fret.  <br>	In short, put the frets where they should be assuming no string <br>stretch from fretting, set the guitar up properly and then adjust the <br>bridge to compensate in the middle of the most played area. <br>John Starrett<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 5 Jun 1996 00:05 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id PAA27709; Tue, 4 Jun 1996 15:05:06 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 4 Jun 1996 15:05:06 -0700<br>Message-Id: <12960604215721/0005695065PK4EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=8056 href="#8056">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Patrick Ozzard-Low&#x22; &#x3C;patrick.ozzard-low.itex@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/1998 6:53:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Thanks alot to Pauls H and E for commatic commentaries!
