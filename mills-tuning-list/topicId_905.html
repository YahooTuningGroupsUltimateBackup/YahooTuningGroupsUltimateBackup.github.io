This subject has only been treated<br>in passing in harmony and orchestration texts. I will outline some of the<br>main points, in hope of getting some feedback:<br><br>Assumptions (big ones, I know, but useful in staking out the territory):<br>(a) heard materials are mapped by the listener onto a just structure. (b)<br>we are listening to an orchestra of sine waves (thus, the timbres of real<br>instruments are not considered). (c) we have unlimited sample lengths<br>(thus, perception of interval differences within the critical band is<br>possible and harmonic rhythm is not an immediate concern).<br><br>(1) General characterization of pitch spacing: (a) harmonically (larger<br>intervals at the bottom, smaller at top), (b) neutrally (no preponderence<br>of intervals) or (c) subharmonically. A characterization as harmonic<br>follows when a pitch complex is analyzable at a lower position in a<br>harmonic series than in a subharmonic series; a subharmonic<br>characterization follow a contrary analysis; a neutral characterization is<br>inconclusive.<br><br>(2) Specification of pitch complex: (a) harmonic sonorities by fundamental,<br>(b) neutral by central frequency - or ambiguously, between a fundamental<br>and a guiding tone, (c) subharmonic by guiding tone (the lowest pitch<br>common to the spectra of all pitches in the complex).<br><br>(3) Evaluation of relative complexity: lowest mapping of the complex onto a<br>harmonic series. (eg Major triad maps onto 4,5,6, minor onto 10,12,15 (or<br>possibly 6,7,9)) divided by frequency of the fundamental in that mapping.<br>(A method of calculating in greater detail needs to be established;<br>possible models are in Chalmers, Divisions of the Tetrachord). <br><br>(4) Cohensiveness: "gaps" in the series seem to increase instability or<br>ambiguity in perception. (eg the interval 3/2 is easier to perceive than<br>the interval 3/1). (Why is it easier to tune superparticulars?) <br>Suggestion: gaps increase the uncertainty of the harmonic/subharmonic<br>analysis.<br><br>Comment: I am encouraged in making a fundamental distinction between<br>harmonic and subharmonic materials by recent brain research identifying the<br>emotion of happiness with lowered electrical activity in the brain. Whether<br>this is caused by eating chocolate or the processing of small-number ratios<br>seems all the same. It makes sense that the harmonic series, marching<br>happily onward up to the infinite is much easier to process than the<br>subharmonic, going inexorably to the quantum depths of the infinitesimal.<br>Could this be part of the mechanism though which we class the Major triad<br>as "happy" and the minor as "sad".<br><br><br>Daniel Wolf<br>Ludwig-Landmann-Str. 84 B<br>60488 Frankfurt Germany<br>+49 69 764307<br>http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/DJWOLF_MATERIAL<br>      <br><br> <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 20 Sep 1996 10:26 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA24605; Fri, 20 Sep 1996 10:27:40 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA23701<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id BAA24340; Fri, 20 Sep 1996 01:27:30 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 20 Sep 1996 01:27:30 -0700<br>Message-Id: <32426392.284E@cavehill.dnet.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
