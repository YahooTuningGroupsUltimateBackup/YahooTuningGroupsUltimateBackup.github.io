Even so, I have met quite a few who profess that they don't<br>want to get into new tunings because they feel that 12TET has not been<br>sufficiently explored yet.  So I suppose it's a matter of just how much<br>exploration we should do in a tuning before we deem it as, for realistic<br>purposes, fully explored.<br><br>   With all of the myriads of other tunings available, I'd be inclined to<br>think that, should some new tuning system come to dominate, that we'd be<br>better off moving on even if that tuning has clearly not been fully<br>explored.  That because of the laws of diminishing returns:  We could<br>probably always eek out a little more from just about any tuning, but the<br>first 20% exploration of most any new tuning will usually reveal more<br>interesting musical possibilities than the last 10% of another.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Listening to Your Own Music<br>PostedDate:  25-11-97 11:04:06<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  25-11-97 11:02:38-25-11-97 11:02:39,25-11-97 11:02:41-25-11-97 11:02:41<br>DeliveredDate:  25-11-97 11:02:41<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125655A.00372822; Tue, 25 Nov 1997 11:02:27 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00573; Tue, 25 Nov 1997 11:04:06 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 25 Nov 1997 11:04:06 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00566<br>Received: (qmail 26763 invoked from network); 23 Nov 1997 02:00:41 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 23 Nov 1997 02:00:41 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541103b09d008ea4c0@[207.207.2.23]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
