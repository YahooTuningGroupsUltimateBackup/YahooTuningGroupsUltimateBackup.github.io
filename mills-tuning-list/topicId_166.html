Although the intended <br>> 11-limit tuning varies far from equal temperament, it is octave-repeating <br>> and fits under the hands well.  No pitch strays much more than a <br>> quarter-tone from its 12TET version.  The piece was received extremely <br>> well, with hosannas all around.<br>	This seems to show the "intentional fallacy": the idea that art can<br>only be enjoyed by apprehending it or understanding it in the way that the<br>artist intended.  Hearing the piece on a 12-TET piano must have driven your<br>ears crazy though!  <br><br>> Can a composer write JI music that provides tonal motion rather than just <br>> common-tone modulation?  Can this be done with a mere 12 notes or less?<br>> <br>> If the answer to these is "no", for what style is JI best suited?<br> <br>	I believe that most composers who work in Just Intonation use more<br>than twelve tones per octave.  Using only twelve precludes a large difference<br>in the complexity of the ratios involved; the difference between dissonance<br>and consonance is reduced.  Using more than twelve allows you the same<br>relative levels of dissonance and consonance as are found in 12-TET.<br>	You didn't mention what sort of people you played the<br>synthesizer tape for.  If they were people who had heard the piano<br>performance, then naturally the JI version would sound odd to them.<br>						Morgan E.
