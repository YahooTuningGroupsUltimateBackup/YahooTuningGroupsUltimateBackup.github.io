But I find these definitions to arise from the properties of the<br>numbers themselves.<br><br>>If you are making a pre-compositional theory...<br><br>That's basically what I'm up to, yes.  I want to better understand the<br>geometrical relationships between integer-ratio intervals, and how they occur<br>in various JI tunings, partly because I find them beautiful (abstractly and<br>sonically), but also so that I can better capture that beauty in pieces of<br>music.<br><br>>... the way musical materials are<br>>articulated is essential to their interpretation.<br><br>True.  Culture and personal taste will always play the primary role.  But<br>there is a beauty in mathematical order that tends to transcend culture and<br>taste.  They say that laughter and mathematics are the two truly universal<br>languages.  I think that's why music is sometimes considered to be one as<br>well.  It's not always one, but it can be - as a vehicle for expressing human<br>emotion in a context of mathematical order.<br><br>As to the use of dimensionalities in music, a composer might choose to<br>consider only one kind and restrict himself with only its related limit-type.<br> That's fine.  He hasn't done away with the other kinds, he's simply chosen<br>to downplay their ramifications.<br><br>On to the examples:<br><br>>(1) I compose a piece consisting only of chromatically planed (parallel)<br>>Major ninth<br>>chords without fifths in just intonation. If the orchestration is such th=<br>>at a listener can hear the<br>>individual voices of these chords, then 9 is being articulated<br>>independently of 3. Since<br>>9 is here relatively prime, how could 9 be here distinguished a 'real'<br>>prime?<br><br>I tried that.  It may be cultural or the result of intermodulation<br>distortion, but my ear filled in the fifths.  Is there such a concept as<br>"relative primality"?  That's a new one on me.  I don't know the higher maths<br>too well -- but I thought a number was either prime or it wasn't.  Maybe<br>that's where my ignorance is leading me to a false conclusion?<br><br>>(2) I write a chorale in triads that goes I - IV - V - I. There is a 9:8<br>>relationship between IV and V chords, but this is usually weakly<br>>articulated and the V of V (3^2)<br>>relationship is heard as more important.<br><br>I'm not sure where that example is leading.  There is no V of V there of the<br>type that I'm familiar with, which is a II chord acting as a dominant to a<br>following V chord.<br><br>>(3) I compose a sound installation consisting of standing sine waves using<br>>only prime<br>>multiples of a given fundamental and 9 times that fundamental. Depending<br>>upon where<br>>I am in the room, I will hear the 9 as either an independent entity or in<br>>connection with 3.<br><br>If 3 and 9 had a common sound source and were in phase with each other, no<br>place in the installation would cause 3 to phase-cancel without also<br>cancelling the 9, or constructively interfere with the 3 without also<br>boosting the 9.  That could not be true of any two different primes.  Seems<br>to me this one helps my argument.<br><br>If the idea is that the sines are tuned to 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23,<br>.., and the room has a mode at the frequency of the 1, then I believe you<br>would always hear the implied fundamental no matter where you stood in the<br>room, and the 9 would act to enhance that implied tone except where it (the<br>9) phase-cancelled.<br><br>>(4) Using a TX81Z (with a resolution of 1.56 cent deviations from 12tet),=<br>> I perform<br>>a melody based upon random walks over a lattice with two dimensions: 3s and<br>>9s. The<br>>best approximation of 9 does not coincide with the best approximation of<br>>3^2. For all practical purposes, 3 and 9, in this temperament, are<br>>relatively prime.<br><br>Matters of the TX tuning table aside, a tuning is conceivable in which<br>intervals of approximately 3/x and 9/x are used, and one or both differ from<br>their corresponding exact integer-ratio values greatly enough that the one<br>being called "3," when squared, yeilds an interval significantly different<br>from the one called "9" that the two ("3"^2 and "9") would function as<br>distinct entities in the scale or in harmonies.  Is that the idea?  In such a<br>case, IMHO, integers are inadequate to describe the nature of that tuning,<br>and to use "3" and "9" to refer to those intervals is to invite confusion.<br><br>I missed the relation between your fifth example and your point.<br><br>David<br><br><br><br>$AdditionalHeaders:  Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id C12564DA.0007128E; Sun, 20 Jul 1997 03:17:15 +0200</div>
