Most of<br>the discussion took place off-list, so I've put it<br>together to post it here, along with some further<br>editorial additions/ explanations/ clarifications.<br>It's very long, but most of you should find it quite<br>interesting.<br><br>Paul's main point is that due to guitar and finger mechanics,<br>the only viable rational interpretation of the "Hendrix Chord"<br>is 1/1 : 5/4 : 7/4 : 7/6.  However, our debate brought in<br>various thoughts about acoustics and mathematics, and we would<br>both like to see what other subscribers have to say about it.<br>I am particularly interested in what you guitarists have<br>to contribute, as I don't really play the instrument myself.<br><br>-Joe Monzo<br>============================================================<br>from TUNING DIGEST # 1354<br><br>From: Joseph L Monzo<br>To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Date: Sun, 15 Mar 1998 07:45:00 -0500<br>Subject: Re: TUNING digest 1353, Topic No. 4: non12 rock<br><br>> ... can anybody offhand list some people doing<br>> detwelvulated *pop music* ... i.e. "songs" in<br>> some kind of (fairly extended into folk- and<br>> psychedelic-, knowing the guy who's asking the<br>> question) "rock context"?<br><br><snip>...I can provide an illustration of an incredibly<br>talented performer being able to coax any frequency he<br>wanted from an ordinary instrument.

If the bottom three notes of the<br>chord (well known to guitarists as "The Jimi Hendrix<br>Chord") are tuned 1/1:5/4:7/4, and a sharp 9th is added<br>above the chord, the most consonant (and most appropriate<br>on distorted guitar) tuning for the sharp 9th is 7/3<br>[1 octave + 267 cents]. Try it yourself if you don't<br>believe me.  The 4/3 [498 cents, 3^-1 in JustMusic<br>notation] between the 7th and sharp 9th is very solid,<br>while a 19:14 [529 cents, 7^-1 * 19^1 in JustMusic] in<br>the same position is too complex a ratio and just sounds<br>out-of-tune.<br><br>The way the chord is played on guitar, the two lowest<br>notes are played with the two strongest fingers, which<br>a good player (like Jimi) will use to apply bending and/or<br>vibrato.

In order to make this<br>12-equal chord approach Paul's interpretation as<br>1/1 : 5/4 : 7/4 : 7/6, the first finger would have to<br>bend the F# up 31 cents, and the second finger would have<br>to bend the A# up 17 cents.  This gives F#:A#:E the<br>proportions 2:5:7.  The 12-equal A is 500 cents above<br>E, which makes it only 2 cents higher than 7/6.<br><br>-Monzo<br>==========================================================<br>From: Joseph L Monzo<br>To: PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com<br>Date: Thu, 19 Mar 1998 13:14:19 -0500<br>Subject: Hendrix and 7/3<br><br>Thanks for the correction.  It points out the difficulty<br>of analyzing stuff when you don't play the instrument<br>under consideration.  I can only be called a guitarist<br>by a very long stretch of the imagination, and I've always<br>*heard* this chord as having a 19/16.  Can't say I ever<br>tested it on anything other than a keyboard.<br><br><snip><br><br>One of the projects on which I will not give up (although<br>I've been told by nearly everyone that it's all but<br>impossible) is to create software that will analyze the<br>pitches being played on a CD.  The data's there on the<br>disk, already in digital format, it's just a matter of<br>putting the .WAV file through the proper mathematical<br>formulas to break it down into individual instruments and<br>pitches.  This way we would all finally have accurate<br>information on what tunings were actually played by<br>performers, with none of the I-could-be-wrong slips<br>of the ear.<br><br>Last year, all of my musical equipment (with the single<br>exception of my Rational Guitar, described below) and<br>almost all of my CDs and records were stolen.  So I<br>don't have the Hendrix album to check it anymore, and<br>I'm limited these days to doing all my musical work on<br>a computer/soundcard combo.  Makes it even more difficult<br>to check statements I've made on tuning.<br><br>The first specifically microtonal instrument I had<br>was my  "Rational Guitar", an acoustic guitar on which<br>I filed off all the frets and placed new ones,<br>individually for each string.  It's a purely experimental<br>instrument, meant to supply different identities for<br>one chord, up to a 27-Limit.  It's virtually useless<br>as a *musical* instrument, in that it will only play one<br>chord (other chords can be coaxed out of the higher<br>identities, for example, 3 - 15 - 9 make a 1 - 5 - 3<br>triad on the 3/2), but it does give me rock-solid<br>identities up to 27 for that "tonic" chord.  On this<br>instrument, 4:10:14:19 sounds gorgeously in tune.<br><br>You mentioned distortion in the guitar's sound as a<br>factor, and this *is* an acoustic instrument, so maybe<br>that's why it sounds so good to me.  Unfortunately,<br>this guitar has no notes built upward from 4/3, so<br>I can't check how 7/6 would sound in place of 19/16.<br><br>I'll be the first to admit that a particular<br>high-harmonic note may fall within a lower PRIME-limit<br>-- manipulation of primes is what my theory is all about,<br>and it's my belief that most ears take a while to adjust<br>to higher primes -- a good argument for the static pace<br>of La Monte Young's extremely high-prime sound<br>installations.  Without proper tools with which to<br>analyze and check, it's tough.<br><br>-Monzo<br>============================================================<br>From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@acadian-asset.com><br>To: "'monz@juno.com'" <monz@juno.com><br>Date: Thu, 19 Mar 1998 14:58:46 -0500<br>Subject: RE: Hendrix and 7/3<br><br>Clearly the 12-equal sharp 9 [300 cents], which is<br>what Hendrix plays, is a very close approximation<br>of the 19/8 [298 cents].  However, what I'm trying<br>to say is that the relevant acoustical ratio is the<br>4/3 between the sharp 9 and the 7th. Since the<br>7th (7/4) is so high in 12-equal, the 7/3 is very<br>high as well -- in the neighborhood of 19/8. That<br>doesn't make 19/8 the relevant ratio for describing<br>the chord, however.<br><br>When you tune a 1/1:5/4:7/4 on a keyboard, where do<br>your ears tell you the sharp 9 should be?<br><br><snip><br><br>Again, you're not _wrong_ -- I just think you're<br>using ratios too high to be acoustically relevant<br>in this context.<br><br><snip><br><br>Actually, distortion will make that sound even better,<br>as it creates lots of difference tones, which will all<br>be integers. Distortion favors exact harmonic-series<br>based chords, while on an acoustic guitar many other<br>chords, such as subharmonic (utonal) chords, are<br>important. However, even with distortion, 19 is<br>usually a bit too high up the harmonic series to<br>be important.<br><br>I suspect that, _especially on an acoustic instrument_,<br>you will like 7/6 in place of 19/16.<br><br><snip><br><br>Just to clarify -- even if Jimi did bend/vibrato the<br>root up to form a 7/3 with the sharp 9, the bass<br>would still be playing the root in 12-equal, so the<br>12-equal sharp 9 is still there, and that is only<br>3 cents off the 19th harmonic.<br><br>That still doesn't make the 19/8 the most relevant<br>ratio for describing the pitch of that note, however.<br><br>Surely you knew/heard that the seventh that Jimi<br>plays, relative to the bass, is 31 cents sharp of<br>the 7th harmonic, and yet you allowed that error<br>to be ignored in your analysis. Similarly, I would<br>argue, the 7/3 can sustain a fairly large error<br>in tuning.<br><br>If you tune 1/1:7/4:7/3 on an acoustic guitar,<br>and you listen closely for the seventh harmonic<br>of the lowest note, you will hear it quite clearly,<br>since it is also the 4th harmonic of the middle note<br>and the 3rd harmonic of the highest note. This<br>is called a subharmonic (or utonal) chord and is<br>the principle behind minor triads. Distortion<br>tends to weaken these types of harmonies and<br>strengthen ones with a harmonic (or otonal) genesis.<br><br>..I don't think our ears are particularly sensitive<br>to primes; when it comes to intervals, each new ODD<br>number presents something new for our ears to get used<br>to, whether it is prime or not. Johnny Reinhard gave<br>me a copy of your paper several years ago, and that<br>is one of the major problems I have with it.<br><br>-Erlich<br>============================================<br>[5 April 1998]<br><br>As Paul alluded to, it's interesting to note that<br>the 19th harmonic is 31 cents above 7/6 -- almost<br>exactly the same distance or "error" as that of the<br>12-equal 7th above 7/4.<br><br>-Monzo<br>===========================================<br>From: Joseph L Monzo<br>To: PErlich@acadian-asset.com<br>Date: Thu, 19 Mar 1998 17:55:38 -0500<br>Subject: Re: Hendrix and 7/3, accurate notation<br><br><snip><br><br>By the way, it's important to realize that utonal<br>chords can also be analyzed as harmonic-series<br>chords -- the proportional numbers become different<br>(and much larger), but the intervallic relationships<br>are still the same.  For example:<br><br>Build a chord from the bottom up with the ratios<br>1/1 - 7/6 - 7/5 - 7/4.  The standard Partchian<br>analysis calls this a Utonality built downward from<br>7/4, with the udentities (downward) 1 - 5 - 3 - 7.<br>However, this chord can also be called an Otonality<br>built upward from 16/15, with the odentities (upward)<br>15 - 35 - 21 - 105 (with the "root" missing).<br>It's exactly the same chord.<br><br>> However, even with distortion, 19 is usually a bit<br>> too high up the harmonic series to be important.<br><br>I have to disagree with this -- I've analyzed many<br>pieces where others called a note 7/6 (or some<br>other utonal derivation) and I hear it clearly as<br>19/16.  There are numerous arguments among "tuning<br>people" about what the "blue notes" are.<br><br>> ...I don't think our ears are particularly sensitive<br>> to primes...<snip><br><br>Each new odd number provides a new *identity* in a<br>chord, but it's my theory that the emotional and<br>acoustical effect and affect of that interval is<br>determined by its prime-number constituents.  The<br>point of what I wrote above, about being able to<br>analyze chords in either of the two ways, is that<br>what LOOKS like a note that's high in the harmonic<br>series may actually be a much lower utonal harmonic.<br>Of course, I realize that 19 is quite a high prime<br>-- to me, this bears out my theory that studying<br>the PRIMES is what is most important in musical<br>harmony.<br><br><snip>...you said yourself that distortion will<br>tend to emphasize interpretation of the chord ratios<br>as harmonics over a fundamental.<br><br><snip><br><br>Again, you are correct in that I overlooked the fact<br>that the 7th played by Jimi is sharper than the 7th<br>harmonic.  We've all been listening to lots of music<br>this century that implies ratios of 7, but fudges their<br>correct intonation quite extensively.  The bottom<br>line of my argument is that in order for us to<br>properly analyze what's already been done (tuning-wise)<br>by important artists whose legacy exists in recordings,<br>we need to pin down exactly what pitches they were<br>playing/ singing, before we can theorize about chords,<br>harmonics, etc.  My work is mainly an attempt at a<br>notation that can be easily read by musicians, and<br>yet is precisely accurate as to the intonation.  I hope<br>to get my book done soon -- the paper only gives the<br>foundation of what I'm doing; the book fleshes it out<br>a lot with historical examples.  <br><br>-Monzo<br>=====================================================<br>from TUNING DIGEST # 1359<br><br>Date: Thu, 19 Mar 1998 15:40:46 -0500<br>From: "Paul H.

Think of the distortion sound in<br>"Revolution" (fast version) by the Beatles.<br>I think that's transistor distortion. Vacuum tubes<br>(or a simulation thereof) are the usual means of<br>effecting a distorted guitar sound and they have<br>a way of letting the individual notes ring through.<br><br>===========================================================<br>From: "Paul H.

I would argue that<br>any description employing such high numbers is<br>psychoacoustically meaningless. Do you hear the<br>missing "root"? Does it sound right as a bass<br>note for the chord?<br><br>> <snip>...There are numerous arguments among<br>> "tuning people" about what the "blue notes" are.<br><br>Blue notes aside, I will admit that the 12-equal<br>minor triad in root position has a certain<br>stability that is lacking from the just minor<br>triad due to the former's proximity to 16:19:24,<br>which has the "root" in the right place.<br><br>> <snip>...the emotional and acoustical effect<br>> and affect of that interval is determined by<br>> its prime-number constituents.<br><br>I have heard that theory from many people, but I<br>am convinced that it is a fallacy. The ear does<br>many things, but prime factorization is not one of<br>them. The only validity I will allow this theory<br>is a cultural conditioning-type process where<br>musicians will become accustomed to the result of<br>"stacking" low prime-number intervals before moving<br>on to the next prime number. However, to someone<br>brought up with 5-limit music, 13:11 isn't going<br>to bear more similarity to 13:8 or 11:8 than,<br>say, 9:7.<br><br>> <snip>...what LOOKS like a note that's high in<br>> the harmonic series may actually be a much lower<br>> utonal harmonic.  Of course, I realize that 19<br>> is quite a high prime -- to me, this bears out<br>> my theory that studying the PRIMES is what is most<br>> important in musical harmony.<br><br>I don't get it.<br><br><snip><br><br>I was just saying that the relevant acoustical ratio<br>for explaining why the sharp 9 sounds good is the<br>4/3 between the sharp 9 and the 7th. Take away the<br>7th, and the sharp 9 sounds awful. Another common<br>chord in rock, especially alternative rock, is a<br>major triad or dominant seventh chord with an added<br>fourth. What do you think the fourth is, the 11th<br>harmonic? The 21st? The 43rd? No, it's just a 4/3<br>above the root, and luckily in 12-equal, a 4/3 below<br>the 7th. That's why the note sounds good there, and<br>how it should be tuned.<br><br><snip><br><br>Excessive distortion will make most chords sound<br>really bad unless the notes are very close to a<br>harmonic series. Unless all the notes of the chord<br>except the 7th were bent up, there is little chance<br>for the Jimi Hendrix chord to achieve this condition<br>as an 8:10:14:19 chord. It is extremely difficult<br>to achieve the finger independence necessary to bend<br>with all fingers except the ring finger (which would<br>be required here).<br><br><snip><br><br>I think you'll be disappointed at how rough and<br>inconsistent Jimi Hendrix's intonation was. John<br>McLaughlin was sometimes even worse. But by and<br>large, it's 12-equal. Where do you go from there?<br><br>-Erlich<br>=======================================================<br>From: Joseph L Monzo<br>To: PErlich@acadian-asset.com<br>Date: Fri, 20 Mar 1998 19:38:08 -0500<br>Subject: Re: Hendrix and 7/3, accurate notation<br><br><snip><br><br>Certainly, the description with the smallest<br>[proportional] numbers would be the most relevant.<br><br>> I would argue that any description employing such<br>> high numbers is psychoacoustically meaningless.<br><br>There may be other reasons for wanting to describe<br>a utonal chord as the equivalent otonal chord with<br>higher numbers.  We are limited to graphing pitch<br>ratios in 3 dimensions, but there may be many more<br>than 3 prime numbers used in a scale or piece.<br>One solution to this problem is to think of all<br>those primes and odd-identites as rungs in the<br>overtone ladder.<br><br>> Do you hear the missing "root"? Does it sound<br>> right as a bass note for the chord?<br><br>No matter how small or large the numbers are,<br>when they come from an arithmetic series, they<br>will always emphasize the "fundamental" (otonal<br>or utonal), whether it's sounding or not.  In<br>some cases, the missing "root" *can* be heard<br>as a difference tone.  As far as sounding right<br>as a bass note, it depends on many factors: the<br>particular ratios used, the timbre of the<br>instruments, the octave registers of the ratios,<br>whether the notes are in close or open spacing,<br>etc.<br><br>Similarly (conversely), the lower notes of<br>a chord can produce summation tones which appear<br>as higher pitches than those that are actually<br>being played.  These effects are apparent when<br>listening to the music of La Monte Young.  Most<br>likely, the use of distortion (even small amounts)<br>would emphasize this effect.  If you try this out<br>on your guitar, I'd be interested to know if this<br>is true.  Try playing a 4:5:14 chord.<br>5 + 14 = 19, so if my theory is correct, you<br>should be able to hear the 19th harmonic.<br>If it's not apparent, see if adding distortion<br>makes it audible.  If this occurs, then it may<br>be possible that in a regular 4:5:7 chord, the<br>octave overtone of the 7 (14) is reacting with<br>the 5 to produce 19.<br><br>> <snip>...the 12-equal minor triad in root<br>> position has a certain stability that is lacking<br>> from the just minor triad...<snip><br><br>It's interesting that you should say that.  I've<br>always thought that 10:12:15 (the just minor triad),<br>6:7:9, and 16:19:24 ALL sounded good as stable<br>minor triads, just different.<br><br>> <snip>...The ear does many things, but prime<br>> factorization is not one of them.<br><br>Well, we definitely part company here.  This is<br>the foundation of my entire theory.  After reducing<br>any number or collection of numbers as far as they<br>will go, what's left is the prime series.  And<br>personally, I (and many others) distinctly sense<br>a difference in sound and feeling between different<br>prime numbers.<br><br>> <snip>...13:11 isn't going to bear more similarity<br>> to 13:8 or 11:8 than, say, 9:7.<br><br>Your point is valid, but my theory isn't written from<br>the point of view of "someone brought up with 5-limit<br>music", it's written with an eye toward describing<br>ANY possible rational combination of pitches.<br><br>> <snip>...[about analyzing chords as either utonalities<br>> or otonalities:] I don't get it.<br><br>I was simply saying that sometimes when high numbers<br>turn up which are multiples of several primes, many<br>of the primes can be factored out when the analytical<br>orientation (otonal vs. utonal) is reversed.<br><br>> <snip>...Take away the 7th, and the sharp 9 sounds awful.<br><br>I disagree -- on my Rational Guitar (the acoustic one)<br>4:10:19 sounds fine -- maybe a little strange, but far<br>from awful.  And again, it may be that the sharp 9th<br>sounds better when the 7th is added because 19 is a<br>summation tone of 5 and 14.<br><br>> <snip>...[about the "major triad or dominant seventh<br>> chord with an added fourth":]it's just a 4/3...<snip>...<br>> That's why the note sounds good there, and how it<br>> should be tuned.<br><br>My, aren't we being dogmatic here?  If the performer's<br>intonation is not precise, or indeed if it IS precisely<br>12-equal, there are many possible rational<br>interpretations.   I will grant that 4/3 is probably<br>intended most of the time, as it is a very simple<br>ratio, and has been used as a basis for music for a<br>couple of thousand years (at least).  But surely it's<br>not the ONLY ratio that musicians use to fit this<br>particular harmonic slot.<br><br>> <snip>...It is extremely difficult to achieve the<br>> finger independence necessary to bend with all<br>> fingers except the ring finger (which would be<br>> required here).<br><br>OK -- to me this sounds logical.  This is the best<br>argument you've given me as to why your<br>interpretation of this chord is better than mine.<br><br><snip><br><br>I haven't done any thorough analysis of Hendrix's<br>intonation -- I was just making statements based on<br>what I've heard in more-or-less casual listening.<br>Perhaps I don't have the authority to discuss this<br>particular corner of microtonality (as I've already<br>told you several times, I am no guitarist).<br><br><snip><br><br>-Monzo<br>=======================================================<br>From: "Paul H.

Specifically, the chord<br>4:10:19 sounds fine on this (acoustic) guitar, even<br>without the 7th.  And to my ears, 4:10:14:19 sounds<br>even better.  Other than that, I have to do everything<br>on my computer with pitch-bend -- a time-consuming<br>process...<snip><br><br>-Monzo<br>=====================================================<br>[5 April 1998]<br><br>I have since tried Paul's chord on my acoustic guitar.<br>It sounds wonderful, but certainly very different from<br>4:10:14:19.  In my opinion, it's neither better nor<br>more consonant (nor Jimi), just different.<br><br>It's important to realize that Paul's analysis of<br>this chord can *also* be described as harmonic <br>proportions over a fundamental.  If F# is 1/1, then<br>the fundamental would be the missing B with the<br>ratio 4/3. His chord would have the proportions<br>6:15:21:28.  Obviously these numbers are larger<br>than my interpretation as 4:10:14:19, but the<br>highest prime in his chord is 7, while the highest<br>in mine is the much higher 19.  Analyzed in my<br>JustMusic notation, we get:<br><br>       Erlich        Monzo<br>      ----------     -----<br>A     7^1             19^1<br>E     3^1 * 7^1        7^1<br>A#    3^1 * 5^1        5^1<br>F#    3^-1             n^0<br><br>There are aspects to both chords which influence<br>the feeling of consonance and dissonance<br>simultaneously. Both chords have the same strong<br>2:5:7 proportion in the lowest three notes, which<br>gives both of them quite a strong feeling of<br>consonance.<br><br>The aspect which makes Paul's chord more<br>consonant is obviously that the factors in<br>his ratios are all such small primes, and thus<br>the internal interval-structure is also more<br>consonant.<br><br>The aspects which makes mine more consonant are<br>that the notes are piled up as harmonics over a<br>fundamental which is both present and in the bass,<br>and they are single-prime identities of the chord.<br><br>Of course, the factors which make either chord<br>dissonant are the converse of those which make<br>the other consonant: Paul's is only obliquely<br>related to a missing fundamental, and the two<br>middle ratios are combinations of two primes,<br>while mine has the high prime 19.<br><br>Our entire debate is centered around the fact that<br>(as both Ben Johnston and Harry Partch pointed out<br>long ago) consonance-dissonance is determined not<br>only by how large the primes are, but also how<br>large their exponents are, and also how many of<br>them are combined in particular ratios.<br><br>I think the most important thing to realize is --<br>again raising Partch's ghost -- "the ability of<br>the human ear is vastly underestimated".  A tiny<br>difference in the pitch of a note can give it an<br>enormously different sound and feeling; I believe<br>that studying the prime-number relationships among<br>the tones is what will disclose these effects.<br><br>Another important distinction in our different methods<br>of analysis is the dichotomy between the analysis of<br>a chord as one harmonic complex and analysis of it as<br>the sum of individual constituent interval ratios. My<br>interpretation of the chord emphasizes the harmonic<br>complex view, while Paul's emphasizes the interval<br>view.<br><br>There it is.
