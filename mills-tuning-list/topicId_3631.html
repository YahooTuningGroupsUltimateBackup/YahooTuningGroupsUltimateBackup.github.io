The precision depends on the register,<br>> and is 1Hz at best.  This may correspond to the internal frequency<br>> representation, in which case the tuning should be accurate.<br>> Choose the right fundamental and it should work for JI ... except<br>> the way it's set up I don't think it's any use.  Stick to tuning<br>> tables, and put up with the imprecision.<br>> <br>If the carrier is set to fixed frequency mode then it doesn't track MIDI,<br>so it would be useful only for drones since the program only plays one<br>note.  A non-multitimbral Yamaha FM synth wouldn't even be able to play a<br>chord this way.  Besides, the frequency resolution is still less than the<br>tuning tables.<br><br>John Loffink<br>jloffink@pdq.net</div>
