Perhaps I don't understand the terminology<br>> properly.<br>> Bruce Kanzelmeyer<br><br>   I think that what John S. and later Paul E. interpreted Neil's comments<br>to be much more specific than Bruce K., and possibly Neil himself intended<br>them.  In particular, I think they interpreted them - and it's a meaningful<br>interpretation - as refering to SPECIFICALLY playing from the harmonic<br>series itself, as opposed to various tunings built upon the intervalic<br>resources present in the harmonic series.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 16 Feb 1997 04:12 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07592; Sun, 16 Feb 1997 04:12:23 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07587<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id TAA08523; Sat, 15 Feb 1997 19:10:41 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 19:10:41 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.970214151949.7515N-100000@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
