Even when the volume is turned off, I can<br>tell when the TV is on in the next room.<br><br>The ear is specialised tissue that evolved from touch.<br>There is no reason to assume that we hear only with our ears.<br><br>I think our brains are acutely sensitive to a myriad range<br>of electromagnetic fields; some of us are aware of it,<br>most are not.  Partly, I think we are desensitized for<br>practical reasons -- there is so much background noise,<br>including from our own bodies, that it's only sensible<br>to filter out most low-level signals.  But, my word, they're<br>certainly there !
