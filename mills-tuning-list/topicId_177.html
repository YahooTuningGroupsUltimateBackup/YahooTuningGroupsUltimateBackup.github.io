That means, of course, that <br>Pythagorean and 1/4-comma meantone, and, for that matter, most <br>early temperaments, are Just Tunings! Somehow, I don't think <br>that is the definition that JI advocates use today.<br><br>Would readers email me a short answer to two questions:<br>1) if the form of the Harvard definition is adequate, with what <br>number would you replace their number five?<br>2) if the definition is inadequate in form, what is the minimum <br>set of additional criteria you have to call something a just <br>tuning?<br><br>I'll summarize the answers to this list, and to the early music <br>crowd, without attributions. Thanks for your answers.<br><br>--<br>John Sankey              bf250@freenet.carleton.ca<br>Music is Beauty, Beauty is Truth, Truth is Freedom<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 12 Nov 1995 18:54 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA07173; Sun, 12 Nov 1995 08:54:37 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 12 Nov 1995 08:54:37 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199511121653.IAA01620@hopf.dnai.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
