I have a Korg<br>O5R/W syth module that hooks into an old DW-6000 synth. The O5R/W allows<br>for microtonality, but it only allows you to alter the 12 chromatic steps<br>of Western harmony (and automatically tunes every octave of the keyboard to<br>the specs that one specifies). If you want to tune a synth keyboard for<br>more than 12 steps you are out of luck. I read a book by Scott R. Wilkinson<br>called TUNING IN. He made reference to an article by Carter Scholz that<br>appeared in 2/86 copy of KEYBOARD magazine; page 49. He showed how one get<br>any keyboard to play in microtones by writing a program in Pascal and<br>having it interface with a Roland MPU@1 and a Yamaha DX7. The computer<br>waits in an infinite loop in a standby mode and whenever one presses a key<br>on the keyboard, it triggers the correct pitch bend midi data that is<br>written in the program.  Is this possible with my Korg O5R/W? Do you know<br>of anyone who may be of help.<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 16 Dec 1996 20:59 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05940; Mon, 16 Dec 1996 21:02:12 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05942<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA26630; Mon, 16 Dec 1996 12:02:09 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 16 Dec 1996 12:02:09 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01510101aedb5a63546a@[206.244.42.188]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4336 href="#4336">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;106232.3266@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/16/1996 1:17:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Here is one approach to Partch:<br><br>(1) Assume for the moment that he used stable and accurate instruments and<br>that all intervals in the book expressed as ratios are tuned precisely. (In<br>fact, he did a pretty good job under very difficult material<br>circumstances).<br><br>(2) Partch's _limit_ idea is based upon the series of odd whole numbers,<br>and his particular expansion of tonal resources was based upon adding<br>higher odd integers; some in the tuning community prefer to speak of<br>_limit_ in terms of highest prime numbers, some forego the term limit<br>altogether in favor of _genus_ (or set of generating factors). In Partch's<br>case, it is sufficient to think of a limit as the defined by the highest<br>odd number (x 2^n) used in either a numerator or denominator. The ratio<br>16/15, then, has to wait for a 15 limit to appear in a _diamond_ (Partch<br>includes it as a _secondary ratio_, to both fill in the gaps in his scale<br>and to allow some modulations, as well as an implied 15 limit tone<br>(although he called it _inharmonic_).<br><br>(3) As a music theory teacher, you may have probably noticed already that<br>Partch's harmonic scheme has three principals: expansion through a kind of<br>stacked third harmony, common tone chord modulations, and intervallic<br>inversion. (To my ears, this puts him smack in the mainstream of harmonic<br>practice and theory in the first half of this century.) In particular, the<br>use of  inversion will become very important to building his diamond, and<br>it is critical that he identifies inverted harmonic structures by their<br>_highest_ tone.<br><br>(4) There are a couple of ways of looking at the diamond. Here's one<br>without ratios: build a Major triad on c: c e g. Now invert these intervals<br>and build a minor triad _down_ from c: c ab f.  Next build similar minor<br>triads down from e (e c a) and g (g eb c)and Major triads up from ab (ab c<br>eb) and f (f a c). Note the shared tones between the triads, and the fact<br>that all contain c, but in each chord in a different function. This<br>arrangement is the diamond:<br><br>          G<br>     E       Eb<br>C        C       C<br>     Ab      A<br>            F <br><br>And transposed to G is the same as Partch's 5-limit diamond.<br><br>A more generalized way of talking about the diamond is to think in terms of<br>a set of intervals multiplied by its inversion (a technique familiar in the<br>- albeit 12tet - music of Pierre Boulez), so we could map it onto twelve<br>pitch classes as:<br><br>0    4      7<br><br>8    0      3<br><br>5     9      0<br><br>which starts to look like the corner of a twelve-tone row box (who says<br>that Schoenberg and Partch didn't have anything in common?).<br><br>In Partch's case, we are talking about Just intonation, however, so these<br>pitches can be expressed as the ratios of small whole numbers in relation<br>to a given 1/1, or tonic.<br>In the five limit diamond, there are six triads, and each has a distinctive<br>odd whole number (again times 2^n, to make it all fit in an octave) common<br>to either the numerators of the minor triads (_utonalities_) or the<br>denominators of the Major triads (_Otonalities_). For example, locate the<br>minor triad with 5's in the numerator (5/4, 5/51, 5/3). Ignoring this<br>common tone, now, the denominators will show the _function_ of each tone in<br>the triad, which Partch called the _identity_: 5/4: 4 is 2^2, thus a 1<br>_identity; 5/5: 5 is the 5 _identity_; and 5/3: 3 is the 3 identity.  <br><br>Let me know if this was of any help...<br><br>Daniel Wolf, Frankfurt<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 17 Dec 1996 03:07 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06227; Tue, 17 Dec 1996 03:09:42 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06181<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id SAA01865; Mon, 16 Dec 1996 18:09:35 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 16 Dec 1996 18:09:35 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612162108_MC1-D44-3C23@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4341 href="#4341">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/1996 7:10:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> What is a 5 limit (or any "n" limit for that<br>> matter)?  ...

What is a 5 limit (or any "n" limit for that<br>> matter)? Is it a scale that only includes ratios with a 5 in numerator or<br>> denominator? Is the highest prime 5 that any number in numerator or<br>> denominator can be divided into?<br>> He uses a scale as follows: 1/1   6/5   5/4   4/3   3/2   8/5   5/3   2/1<br>> on page 109.<br>>         What about 16/15. This ratio's numerator and denominator are<br>> divisible by primes that are 5 or less. Does he choose his scale based on<br>> what sounded good, on how close to just he could get?<br><br>I'm responding only on memory, not having Partch's "Genesis of a Music" here to refer to. I'm sure others will <br>pipe in with refinements if needed.<br><br>Partch used the idea of "identities" which are odd numbers in either the overnumber or undernumber position of <br>the ratios which describe pitches ignoring octave transposition. A limit sets the highest identity he might <br>use to generate a pitch set (ignoring octave transpositions). Identities are not factored together as in 3*5, <br>so 16/15 is not in 5-limit, but requires 15-limit or higher. <br> <br>In my idiolect, a limit is different. A limit is the highest prime factor needed to analyse a given just pitch <br>set. In this meaning, the interval 16/15 is a 5-limit interval, as is 243/125, etc. <br><br>>        On page 110 he speaks of the coexistence of Major and Minor and<br>> draws the first Tonality diamond in the book. Why do these major and minor<br>> sounds (ie Otonalites and Utonalities) result. It seems like they just<br>> appear out of thin air.<br>>        What is a Numerary Nexus? His definition on page 72 is confusing to me.<br><br>A Numerary Nexus is the number you keep the same in either the undernumber or over number while iterating the <br>identities in the other position to generate a tonality. <br> <br>For instance, to generate the Otonality of 3, iterate the identities in the overnumber position while keeping <br>3 as the Numerary Nexus like so: 1/3, 3/3, 5/3, 7/3, etc. up to your limit. <br><br>An Otonality is so called to match with "o"vernumber, since it is the set of overnumber identities which share <br>a Numerary Nexus. All Otonalities follow the form 1/n, 3/n, 5/n, etc. (n being the numerary nexus). <br> <br>An Otonality is roughly analogous to major tonality, but may be closer to major chord quality, since we <br>usually think of a major tonality as including the various diatonic chords available from a major scale, <br>whereas Partch's tonalities move around with the individual chords, so to speak. The analogies drift apart <br>rapidly with higher ratios. The septimal dominant (or whatever you want to call it) 4:5:6:7 would be a purely <br>otonal chord, but would probably not be thought of by most as "major". Otonality is really an unique term <br>which must be savored for its own theoretical functionality.<br> <br>Otonality is distinct from the overtone series, with which it is sometimes confused. The o in Otonality does <br>not stand for overtone. An overtone series includes all positive integers in the numerator but does not <br>include all octave transpositions of those pitches, while an Otonality includes only the odd overnumbers, but <br>implicitely generates all octave transpositions of those pitches.<br> <br>An Utonality (u for "u"ndernumber) is the set of pitches you get from iterating the identities in the <br>undernumber position, while keeping the same Numerary Nexus in the overnumber, of form n/1, n/3, n/5, etc. <br> <br>For example, the Utonality of 5 with 11 limit is: 5/1, 5/3, 5/5, 5/7, 5/9, 5/11.<br><br>Utonality is roughly analogous to minor tonality or minor chord quality. Utonality is distinct from the <br>undertone series.<br><br>The pitch set you quoted 1/1   6/5   5/4   4/3   3/2   8/5   5/3   2/1 is what you get when you permute the <br>identities in both the overnumber and the undernumber up to a limit of 5, remove the redundant instances, and <br>express them in smallest ascending form (6/5 instead of 3/5 for instance), then throw in a 2/1 for the sake of <br>"scaleness". The raw set would be:<br> <br>1/1 3/1 5/1<br>1/3 3/3 5/3<br>1/5 3/5 5/5<br> <br>The raw set may be what a tonality diamond is; I don't remember.<br> <br>Matt Nathan<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 18 Dec 1996 09:41 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01133; Wed, 18 Dec 1996 09:43:24 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01131<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id AAA03779; Wed, 18 Dec 1996 00:43:21 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 18 Dec 1996 00:43:21 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.665044@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
