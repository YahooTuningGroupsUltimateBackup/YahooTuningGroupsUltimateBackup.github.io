As I looked at the letter names I used above,<br>and flashed back to childhood piano lessons and music theory, I realized I<br>should've called the chord a "D#dim7" (in first inversion).  Mea culpa or<br>whatever...<br><br>Okay, so here's the chord, properly named, and rearranged to be in root<br>position.  The same ratios are shown (they are based on E = 1/1):<br><br>        D#dim7:  D# (15/8)   F# (9/8)    A (4/3)    C (4/5)<br><br>As stated above, a full diminished seventh chord is a stack of minor 3rds,<br>but there's more than one "flavor" of minor 3rd in just intonation.  I chose<br>the 6/5 flavor for D#:F# and for A:C, but I used 32/27 for F#:A.  Here's a<br>table the intervals involved:<br><br>        From    To      Ratio   Interval name*<br>        ----    --      -----   -----------------------<br>        D#      F#      6/5     Just minor Third<br>        F#      A       32/27   Pythagorean minor Third<br>        A       C       6/5     Just minor Third<br>        C       D#      75/64   augmented Tone<br><br>*Interval names shown are from the Table of Intervals in Ellis' additions to<br>Helmholtz' "On the Sensations of Tone".  (Yeah, you gotta buy the book if<br>you haven't already.  Or you have to live in one of those comfy chairs at a<br>Crown & Noble bookstore.)<br><br>Note that the interval C:D# is actually not a minor 3rd, but an augmented<br>2nd (because of it's "spelling").<br><br>>>The values line up as follows:<br>>><br>>>  note name     whole number    small (possibly fractional) number<br>>>  ---------     ------------    ----------------------------------<br>>>  C             192             4*16/15 (= 64/15)<br>>>  D#            225             5<br>>>  F#            270             6<br>>>  A             320             4*16/9 (= 64/9)<br>>><br>>>The "whole numbers" are the smallest numbers I could find that were not<br>>>fractions.  Unfortunately, the more notes there are in the chord, the bigger<br>>>these numbers tend to get.  That's why I showed the alternative, "small<br>>>(possibly fractional) numbers".<br>>How do these single large numbers represent those notes ?<br><br>The numbers were used in the "numbers separated by colons" notation; viz.,<br>"192:225:270:320".  The numbers only have meaning relative to each other.<br>For example:<br><br>        A/F# = 320/270 = 32/27<br><br>A "tuning lattice" may be used to help visualize intervals and chords.<br>Graham Breed describes "Tuning Lattices" at:<br>        http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/lattice.htm<br><br>Here's my tuning of the D#dim7 chord, represented in a tuning lattice:<br><br>                  D#<br>                 / \<br>        A--(E)-(B)--F#<br>         \ /<br>          C<br><br>It shows how the "Pythagorean minor Third" from A to F# is a more "remote"<br>interval than the "Just minor Thirds" (from A to C, and from D# to F#).  You<br>can also see that you can get to the F# by traversing the "cycle of 5ths"<br>from A, to E, to B, to F#.<br><br>That's probably more than enough for now.  Thanks again,<br>--Mark<br><br>P.S.:  If you respond to this, you might want to send a copy to both<br>tuning@eartha.mills.edu and my email address (nowitzky@alum.mit.edu), to<br>make sure I don't miss it.  (It's easy to get left "in the dust" on the<br>information superhighway.)<br><br>P.P.S.:  Now I can go check out those "Continued Fractions" web pages you<br>mentioned in other posts (around 4/17/98).  I'll catch up, as long as I<br>never sleep...<br>+------------------------------------------------------+<br>| Mark Nowitzky                                        |<br>| email:  nowitzky@alum.mit.edu                        |<br>| www:    http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky          |<br>|         "If you haven't visited Mark Nowitzky's home |<br>|         page recently, you haven't missed much..."   |<br>+------------------------------------------------------+</div>
