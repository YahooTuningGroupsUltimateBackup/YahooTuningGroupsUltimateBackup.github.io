Although I am not as expert a player as<br>Neil (I play bass, some keyboard and a little StarrBoard), I have often<br>wished there were more fiery performances of microtonal works. It's not<br>that there are none, but that there aren't enough to keep me sated.<br>However, I believe the problem is more one of numbers than of<br>percentages.<br>        My guess is that, aside from pure theorists (who I see as vital<br>to a relatively new field), the percentage of microtonal players of various<br>technical proficiencies is about the same as it would be in the 12tet <br>world had 12tet instruments just recently become available. Remember that <br>microtonal instruments are not widely available, so the uninitiated have <br>little chance to hear and see these new tonal resources being used, much <br>less try them out themselves. It takes a community of practitioners to <br>bring any art or science to high form, and this particular community is young <br>and small.<br>        Some of you may remember when Chuck Berry was considered a good<br>rock and roll guitarist. Now any 12 year old who can't rip out Johnny B.<br>Goode after a couple of hearings is considered a loss. Its all because of<br>the musical environment, where young guitar players (who must actually be<br>able to get their hands on a 12tet guitar) are saturated with the sounds <br>of thousands of better players (via radio and other media), causing the <br>young player to stretch and take his art to a higher level. This kind of <br>immersion feeds the process, causing tremendous growth.<br>       Sometimes evolution occurs via punctuated equilibrium. Witness <br>the  leap in bass playing technique after LaFaro, Graham, Clarke and <br>Pastorius. A great player can inspire legions others, provided, of <br>course, that the legions can get their hands on a playable instrument. <br>        As I see it, we may be near the critical point, where the art of <br>playing microtonal music will advance by leaps. There are a number of <br>inspiring players, playable instruments are just starting to become <br>available to the general public, awareness of microtonality is increasing <br>(due in some part to the www), and music is being written for the <br>instruments that exist.<br>        I dont view Neils criticism as petty or misdirected, but rather <br>as the heartfelt wish of a passionate man for a world he senses is just <br>over the horizon.<br><br>John Starrett  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 17:41 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02033; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 17:43:04 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02030<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA22125; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 08:43:01 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 6 Dec 1996 08:43:01 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612061139_MC1-CBF-419@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
