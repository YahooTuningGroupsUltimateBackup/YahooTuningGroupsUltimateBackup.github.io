What makes me a <br>>bit ill is 2 things: one, as far as I can tell, after playing guitar for <br>>33 years, if the guitar keeps the same 12 note/octave eq temp <br>>arrangement, it will still be out of tune with the harmonic series, no <br>>matter what else you do. And two, the rather awestruck approval of this <br>>system by numerous prominent mags, including GP, has shown me that the <br>>tuning movement has a long way to go before folks even know what the hell <br>>we're talking about. I have written, repeatedly, the editors of various <br>>music mags, commenting on the innacuracies of Feiten's "innovation," and <br>>his ignorance of terms such as well tempered and meantone; I have offered <br>>to write an article which would explain what is really going on, and how <br>>12 eq is faulty at the very core...no one has shown any interest. And <br>>yes, it bums me out a bit to see such total ignorance of what tuning is, <br>>or what it really could be...a lot of musicians read GP, and Feiten is <br>>totally misleading folks by letting them think that mechanical <br>>adjustments will resolve the out of tune 12 eq system...Hstick<br><br>That's pretty interesting coming from someone who insists on <br>using equal temperaments over just intonation just so he can modulate!<br><br>I've tried a Tom Anderson with the BF system. It really does<br>sound "sweeter" - seems to be a well temperament.<br><br><br>-- <br>* D a v i d        B e a r d s l e y<br>*           xouoxnoREMOVE-THIS@virtulink.com<br>*<br>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br>*<br>* http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</div>
