We do indeed hear pitch logarithmically, where pitch is defined as <br>the "virtual pitch" that is assigned to any harmonic or near-harmonic set of <br>partials. However, due to beats and combination tones, we can detect much <br>finer deviations from an arithmetic or harmonic series in a chord than <br>deviations from a geometric (logarithmic) series in either a chord or a <br>melody. This leads talented performers to essentially mutate the 12-tone <br>grid to achieve 5-limit just intonation in sustained harmonies. It also <br>leads people to think of just intonation as representing the way we actually <br>hear, but it just ain't so.<br><br>>For example, sing alound a 7/4 and<br>>then try to find the logarithmic midpoint that bisects the interval.<br>>Knowing this interval is made up of 969 cents, one can calculate a center.<br><br>Knowing that it is 9 2/3 semitones (you can't hear a 2-cent discrepancy <br>under performance conditions), one can calculate a center even more easily: <br>4 5/6 semitones (beats won't help you tune this one!). Sixths of semitones <br>can be taught systematically, through 11-limit JI harmonies and Arabic and <br>Byzantine scales, while cents imply a lot of guesswork. (I'm thinking of how <br>to best educate, and notate music for, tomorrow's musicians, not necessarily <br>Johnny's highly-skilled ensemble).<br><br>I suppose if Johnny wins out, I would recommend restricting the allowed <br>deviations to 17, 33, and 50 cents when first beginning a course of <br>microtonal education, so that certain points of reference can be <br>established. It's just that having to attach numbers like 17 and 33 to these <br>sounds seems like an unnecessary burden. For the extreme purists among the <br>JI advocates, I would say that really good performers of 11-limit vocal and <br>string music will intuitively mutate the 72-tone grid (by no more than 4 <br>cents) in sustained harmonies to achieve absolute perfection; more accurate <br>notation would not be of any help to those with inferior ears.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 2 Nov 1996 02:52 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14123; Sat, 2 Nov 1996 02:53:26 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12721<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id RAA25608; Fri, 1 Nov 1996 17:53:23 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 1 Nov 1996 17:53:23 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9611011948.A7983-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3899 href="#3899">ðŸ”—</a>Johnny Reinhard &#x3C;reinhard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/1996 5:53:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Paul, it is not possible to sing the midpoint of a 7/4 without first <br>learning it by rote, by memory, from a tuning machine.
