I made a nice little tonality diamond that<br>inserted notes into the sequencer at the time that the cursor was on.  As<br>I remember (as I do not have the program with me right now, but might be<br>able to send it later), there is no ability to create universal variables,<br>only instance variables.  This means that you must use the only three<br>universal variables available to you- now, thru and from.  The now should<br>not be changed, as it is the position that the cursor is at- you should<br>access this for the time of your event.  I used either from or thru to set<br>the duration of the note.  I did it thus:  I made buttons that represented<br>quarter, eigth, etc. notes, and in these I think the only operation was<br>thru = 120; for a quarter note, thru = 60; for an eighth, and so on.<br>Then, thru would be used by each of my diamond buttons as the length<br>value.  It's really a simple evaluation; as I don't remember the code, i<br>can't give an example, but remember to multiply cents value by 41.6 or so<br>in order to get the correct pitch bend amount.  Good luck, but remember<br>that cal is not designed for programs that large, and they are therefore<br>slow and awkward.<br><br>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>[Peter Blasser<br>[Oberlin College Mailroom Box #277, 135 W.Lorain St.,<br>[Oberlin, Ohio, 44074-1081.<br>[Peter.Blasser@Oberlin.edu       .             .            .           .<br>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Peter.Blasser@oberlin.edu<br>Subject:  Sorry, Cal emendation<br>PostedDate:  01-10-97 23:21:08<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  01-10-97 23:20:48-01-10-97 23:20:49,01-10-97 23:19:44-01-10-97 23:19:45<br>DeliveredDate:  01-10-97 23:19:45<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256523.00753E30; Wed, 1 Oct 1997 23:20:36 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04335; Wed, 1 Oct 1997 23:21:08 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 1 Oct 1997 23:21:08 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04330<br>Received: (qmail 1513 invoked from network); 1 Oct 1997 14:21:05 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 1 Oct 1997 14:21:05 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.PMDF.3.95.971001171903.162964A-100000@OBERLIN.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
