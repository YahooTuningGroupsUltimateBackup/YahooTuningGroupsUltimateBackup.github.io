So why can't he have instead 4<br>trumpets that approximate 4 different tunings?  I would think different<br>tunings would be a boon for manufacturing- they're always looking for<br>something to sell.<br><br>Keep in mind that only fixed pitch instruments are fixed in pitch.  My<br>abovementioned friend has a brass quintet.  They played a concert this past<br>Monday night at a local catholic church.  Any chord longer than .5 seconds<br>was played in pure 5-limit Just Intonation, despite the fact that none of<br>them know what that means any better than they know what equal temperament<br>means.  They do know the old rule: "Raise the 5th and Flat the 3rd!"<br><br>They played some songs along with the organ, and it wasn't hard to hear the<br>intonation fight on these tracks.  Afterwards, they all confirmed the<br>difficulty of keeping in tune with the organ.  Anybody familiar with groups<br>like the Canadian or Empire brass can confirm that JI is nothing new to<br>ensembles of this kind.<br><br>>>Will the fragmentation of opinion among tuning pioneers inhibit a popular<br>>>movement beyond 12TET, so that alternate tunings remain the province of<br>>>academics and isolated pockets of experimentation?<br><br>Who wants a popular movement?  A bottom-up enema is needed.  It starts with<br>a generalized midi keyboard and GOOD MICROTUNING SYNTH in every ear training<br>room in the conservatory.  Assignments for analysing the various ET's.<br>Singing Just Intervals.<br><br>We've got it in Barbershop.  I went to a week-long camp called "Harmony<br>College" this past August.  I took a class called "Tune it or Die".  It<br>discussed the problem of where to put the comma so you don't go flat.  The<br>prof had a PC running Justonic's Pitch Pallete (which the Barbershop Society<br>has been involved with from the beginning), and some software that would<br>measure the harmonics of a sound (good Barbershop vocal technique aims to<br>cull every harmonic possible from the human voice).<br><br>He also had an old Xen-modified keyboard called the "Just Intonation<br>Trainer".  It automatically tunes 4-5-6-7 chords in every key, in any<br>inversion, but only if all 4 notes, and no others, are used.  (When one<br>plays a 4 and 6 on the 12-tone physical keyboard, a simple gait opens to a<br>pair of virtual keyboards: one for the 5's, the other for the 7's.)  It has<br>two waveforms and a 3 octave range.  Really a very limiting instrument, but<br>great for singing and hearing- except when the logic was turned off!<br><br>Now, as to where to put the comma...<br><br>>>Certainly, singers temper intervals.<br>>>However, they do not require an explicit system to do so.<br><br>If they did, they wouldn't.  But I don't think they do, at least not without<br>a keyboard.  I'm NOT saying they always sing right on in any system.  But<br>"tempering" usually means adjusting intervals in a specific way, for the<br>purpose of modulating in a specific way.  Singers just don't do this, and I<br>for one, am glad.<br><br>>>As odd as it may seem, I must agree with Gregg Gibson that most traditional<br>>>Western music requires temperament, not necessarily always ET but necessarily<br>>>a meantone temperament, to adequately perform it.<br><br>I don't think i'd say "most".  Much of it really should have meantone, true<br>enough.  But at least as much of it can be tuned in JI with good results.<br><br>>>If the pitches were not adjusted in the midst of playing them, the key of<br>a >>typical piece of classical music would drift, usually downwards, by<br>several >>commas by the time the piece was completed.<br><br>The first thing to consider is if this pitch drift is important.  In pieces<br>that resolve to the tonic, I believe it most definitely is.  Even listeners<br>who do not know that the song has gone flat will without a doubt have some<br>feeling of being let down.  In pieces with plenty of modulation, I'm not<br>sure it's as important.<br><br>The second question is where to put the comma.  In the abovementioned<br>Barbershop class I took, the following example was given...<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Chord:    CMaj      E7       A7       A7       D7       G7      Cmaj<br>          (I)     (III7)    (VI7)    (VI7)    (II7)    (V7)     (I)<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Tenor      5........8........12       7        10       7        5<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Lead       4        7        10.......5        7        5        4<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Bari       3        5        7        4........6        4........3<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Bass       2        3        4        3        4........3        2<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>         "Here     is       why      some     guys     sing    flat"<br><br>..I wish I could include the music.
