Mr. Erickson  was sympathetic to<br>tuning experiments and wrote an insightful article on Archytas's tunings <br>to which I referred in my book and which has recently been published. <br>He used a variety of natural and instrumental sounds in his music,<br>including<br>new instruments based on  metal rods stroked to excite longitudinal rather <br>than transverse vibrations. <br><br>He was one of the founding members of the Music Department at UCSD. <br>According to the obituary in the Saturday San Diego Union-Tribune, a <br>memorial service is still in the planning stage. In lieu of flowers, <br>donations to The Friends of Music are suggested. More information <br>may be obtained by calling (619) 534-4830.<br><br>--John<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 28 Apr 1997 01:04 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA32081; Mon, 28 Apr 1997 01:04:42 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA32087<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id QAA16410; Sun, 27 Apr 1997 16:02:46 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 27 Apr 1997 16:02:46 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199704272300.HAA05250@csnt1.cs.ust.hk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5351 href="#5351">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>4/28/1997 2:03:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>The piece is called "Nineteen" and I wrote it for the CD project,<br>>"Nineteen for the 90s" which we still haven't seen completed (hint).<br><br>   I don't know about others on the list here, notably contributors to that<br>project, but I haven't heard from Brian about that project for ... nearly a<br>year now.
