A few days ago I asked for more comments from others.<br>Understandably, none arrived. (I'm pretty busy too.)<br><br>What I tried to do in that article was derive a system which is based on<br>the one we know which would theoretically cover any ET. Some of the<br>solutions are awkward, because once I figured out what to do, I pushed the<br>result as hard as I could. Consequently, to notate 171-tET the way I did<br>may just seem quaintly humorous. But for a large number of ETs, probably<br>up to 72 or 100 or so, I think I showed that using traditional notation<br>plus signs for various kommas works, and works systematically. That is the<br>key concept, because until now there have been widely divergent<br>approaches. My systematization doesn't do away with those, of course, but<br>it strongly suggests that non-systematic approaches won't work for more<br>than a few tunings, because relationships among them won't appear. <br><br>Yes, this amounts to an expansion of Pythagorean notation, with the<br>addition of signs for the syntonic komma, the diesis, the skhisma, and the<br>diaskhisma. In the process, some theorems are discussed and proved about<br>the relation of the kommas to each other. Below are paraphrases of some of<br>Brian's points (some only, not all that I take issue with), enclosed in<br>angle brackets, plus my discussion. His exact words are in quotation<br>marks. I'd be interested in others' reactions. I am aiming here for a<br>rational (and calm) objection to points I disagree with, no more. <br><br>1. Brian says that <I have an "implicit presumption" that one ought to<br>relate "all the especially 12-like tunings with good fifths."> I don't.<br>The basing of a notation system on fifths is all I did, whether or not<br>those fifths are good or bad, or whether an ET has fifths at all. For<br>those that don't (e.g. 13-tET), I proposed a general solution to notate<br>them within the same framework. <br><br>2. <ETs 9, 10, 23, 22, and 21 cannot be usefully notated using a 5-limit<br>method.> The article shows how to do this. Of course many may prefer the<br>method for ETs with recognizable fifths; see point 1. <br><br>3. <ETs generally do not allow themselves to be seen as an "outgrowth" of<br>just intonation.> Many uses of ETs do exactly that, especially the ones<br>that allow recognizable tonal or modal progressions. This does not mean<br>that they grew from JI historically, which is a different and differently<br>arguable point. <br><br>4. Brian spends some time discussing why small intervals, e.g. 1/17 or<br>1/31 octave don't sound like JI, for no reason I can determine. <br><br>5. <Easley Blackwood's microtonal etudes suffer because he tried to make<br>them all as 12-like as possible.> Not quite; he tried to make them as<br>tonal/modal as possible. <The etude in 19 is weak because Blackwood didn't<br>showcase exotic, non-Pythagorean intervals.> One might as well devalue<br>12-tET tonal music because it isn't atonal, or the other way around, for<br>that matter. There is little point in criticizing something for what it<br>deliberately *doesn't* do, unless it makes a claim that nothing else is<br>acceptable. We need to separate criticizing the premise from criticizing<br>the result. I'd prefer more exotic music too, but that isn't what <br>Blackwood set out to do. <br><br>6. <A string of MIDI numbers (0 to 127) and a MIDI file format constitutes<br>a notation.> It does, but not one anyone I know would want to perform or<br>analyze from. Brian goes on to claim that <I reject pieces of music which<br>aren't in traditional notation,> a point which he dreamed up himself. <br><br>7. <"Essentially no one attends or gives live acoustic concerts any<br>more."> Statements like this lead people on this forum to ignore Brian.<br>More on this later. <br><br>8. <For 25-tET, "a notation which implies that there are more tones than<br>sharped or flatted versions of C, D, E, G, and A proves less than<br>useful."> Sorry, no sale. Keeping to that principle of notation would<br>imply that the only structure in 25-tET is groups of pentatonic scales.<br>But 25 has a quite usable major 3rd and natural 7th, which staying with C<br>D E G A won't reveal adequately. <br><br>9. <Blackwood's (and my) notion that E and F are the same note (in 20, 25,<br>etc., any ET with a 720-cent fifth) is "willful obfuscation."> It is true,<br>however. Several articles show why. But it is possible both to use and<br>relieve this fact in a systematic way. My article does this, but Brian<br>doesn't seem to recognize that. <br><br>10. <22-tET has nothing in common with traditional tunings.> Does anyone<br>agree with this? <br><br>11. <The notation of distinctly un-Pythagorean ETs in this manner doesn't<br>work, e.g. 13- and 14-tET.> My solutions for these and others like them<br>reveal exactly what he says is lacking. For example, there is no major or<br>minor third in 14, and no perfect fifth in 13: this emerges from what I<br>suggest be done to notate these ETs. <br><br>12. <14-tET is nothing more than two sets of 7-equal.> This comment is<br>similar to Brian's comment about 25 being nothing more than 5 sets of<br>5-equal, and equally incorrect. Blackwood's 14-note etude and mine in 25<br>should be enough to show that. <br><br>13. <35-tET is a nightmare to notate.> Anyone who reads my article is<br>invited to determine that this is not so. If anyone wishes, I'll apply the<br>method I've evolved to that, since I didn't illustrate it in my article.<br>It is a curious case, but by no means dreadful. <br><br>14. <Sharps and flats are most useful in tunings which sound like they<br>have semitones.> This is too vague for me. Besides, sharps and flats<br>aren't defined in terms of semitones, but at least initially as 7 perfect<br>fifths (up or down), in a Pythagorean sense, anyhow. What interests me<br>most are cases where the fifths are so far from just that the sharp and<br>flat end up denoting either fairly large or fairly small intervals. <br><br>15. <"The use of sharps and flats in 19 is willfully perverse."> There are<br>many counterexamples to this categorical denial. Of all ETs, 19-tET is<br>closest to 12. In another note, Brian seemed troubled that a double-sharp<br>in 19, being two units of the tuning, conflicted with what it should be,<br>namely a whole step, which is 3 units in the tuning. But in 19-tET F<br>double-sharp and G are not the same note, as will be recognized by anyone<br>dealing with 19 as a tonal/modal tuning. <br><br>At the end of his review, Brian suggested that my article was an admirable<br>advance in examining the notation issue. I can't see why, since he<br>discussed mostly things he disliked. (I have omitted mention of the few<br>things he liked and dicussed.) But I'll emphasize that my post here isn't<br>primarily an argument with Brian McLaren. It's a discussion about matters<br>of notation, which I see in a broader context than one of convenience or<br>necessity: a context which may reveal structures and at the same time be<br>useful for all the things notation is intended for. <br><br>None of this excludes doing things differently. Although I agree with<br>anyone who notes that I don't base my method on primes beyond 3 and 5, I<br>disagree with anyone who claims I reject all possibilities that do go to 7<br>and beyond. Writing an article or several about 3 and 5 does not imply<br>ignorance of or disdain for something else. More about that another time.<br>I have another article to write still about 3x5, and many ideas about 7<br>and beyond. Of course, many others have had such ideas also. <br><br>Finally, Brian's apparently less well thought out statements can be<br>misleading and even damaging. We all need to make it clear when we are<br>discussing things we know something about and when we're not, and to give<br>or at least imply reasons for conclusions to un-obvious questions.<br>Otherwise we risk being written off totally. In Brian's case, he has a lot<br>to offer; he may know more about microtonality than I do. In addition, he<br>has been helpful to many people beyond description, and his bibliography<br>on microtonality is no less than amazing.<br><br>But everyone must read his articles carefully. I am sure he would invite <br>no less an approach.<br><br>==========================      =================================<br>Dr. Paul Rapoport               e-mail:	rapoport@mcmaster.ca<br>SADM (Music)	                   tel: (+1) 905 529 7070, ext. 2 4217<br>McMaster University                fax: (+1) 905 527 6793<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 19 Jul 1996 02:09 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id RAA22405; Thu, 18 Jul 1996 17:09:41 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 18 Jul 1996 17:09:41 -0700<br>Message-Id: <25960719000752/0005695065PK4EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3319 href="#3319">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/1996 9:25:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Paul E says:<br>> Although I believe octave equivalence is universally perceived, I think a <br>> lot of interesting music can be made without octaves. <br><br>   From my work with 88CET tuning, I have found that nonoctave tunings are<br>interesting (partly) BECAUSE OF the universal perception of octave-equivalence,<br>rather than IN SPITE OF it.  Warren Burt, Paul Fly, and others immediately<br>latched on to this as well, when they played with 88CET.  (Let me put in another<br>quick plug for Paul Fly's 88CET "sketches";  they're really neat stuff.)<br><br>   Paul E indirectly mentioned in his post why octave-equivalence makes<br>nonoctave tunings valuable:  In an octave-based tuning, each octave's span<br>provides octave-equivalents of the same basic harmonies, whereas in a nonoctave<br>tuning, each octave's span gives you an all new set of harmonies.  <br><br>   So the almost universal perception and agreement on the idea of octave<br>equivalence bodes well for nonoctave tunings, because it ensures that they<br>provide more harmonic variety than octave-based tunings (for a given scale-step<br>size).  <br><br>   Then again, if you don't buy the idea of octave equivalence, and feel that,<br>for example, a 5:2 M10 sounds fundamentally different from a 5:4 M3, then you'd<br>conclude that octave-based tunings as well nonoctave tunings provide all new<br>harmonies in each octave's span.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 27 Jul 1996 06:26 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA12110; Fri, 26 Jul 1996 21:26:12 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 26 Jul 1996 21:26:12 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960727042249_71670.2576_HHB66-16@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
