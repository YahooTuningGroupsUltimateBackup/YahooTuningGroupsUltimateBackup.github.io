Mathematically, i work a lot with my students (and use in my<br>own composition work) some variant of the tenney HD function, which is very<br>similar to the Euler function and the barlow function (these are explained<br>pretty well in Chalmer's "Divisions...".). we've done some fun things here in<br>seminars with plotting the different functions over common intervals, and so<br>on, and it turns out that they're all pretty similar (low primes vs. few<br>exponents is the basic idea), but have some interesting differences as well.<br><br><br>these are not cognitive functions, exactly, which would need to use the<br>critical band and a heck of a lot of other things (including timbre, context,<br>temporal displacement, memory, etc etc etc)... they are something more like<br>very concise cognitively informed musical similarity functions (if that makes<br>any sense)<br><br><br>lp</div>
