I'm totally inspired to<br>take up playing steel guitar!  (It's gotta be kind of like trombone, right?)<br><br>>I'm always confused by the terminology of numbers separated by colons.  You<br>>wrote:<br>><br>>> Here's your E triad (4:5:6):<br>>>        E:      E (1/1)         G# (5/4)        B (3/4)<br>><br>>Maybe it's my lack of formal music training, but I don't understand the<br>>"4:5:6" reference.<br><br>I don't think you'd learn this stuff in "formal music training".  I think<br>it's more of a "higher math" kind of thing.<br><br>>What do these numbers mean?  Later you use them a lot.  Lacking the<br>>foundation knowledge, I'm having a hard time with equations like:<br>><br>>> a D# diminished triad (45:54:64=5:6:4*16/9)<br>><br>>I see that you know what you're talking about, and I really want to<br>>understand it.  Can you give me a short explanation of this shorthand?<br><br>I'll give it my best shot:<br><br>Basically, the colons are a handy way to show the relation between three or<br>more notes.<br><br>To show the relation between TWO notes, you can use a ratio.  For example, a<br>major third, say, C to E, is 5/4.  And a minor third, like E to G, is 6/5.<br><br>You could also use the colon for this:<br>        C:E is 4:5 (The C is the 4, and the E is the 5.)<br>        E:G is 5:6 (The E is the 5, and the G is the 6.)<br><br>But to show the relation between THREE or more notes, the colons have to be<br>used.  C:E:G is 4:5:6.  (C is 4, E is 5, and G is 6.)<br><br>It would be misleading to use the slash for a triad, as in "6/5/4", because<br>it would be interpreted as "6 divided by 5, divided by 4" (which is 3/10).<br><br>>From C:E:G = 4:5:6, you have these combinations:<br>        E/C = 5/4<br>        G/E = 6/5<br>        G/C = 6/4 (= 3/2)<br><br>As for things like:<br><br>    C full diminished seventh (192:225:270:320)=(4*16/15:5:6:4*16/9):<br>        Cdim7:  C (4/5)     D# (15/8)   F# (9/8)    A (4/3)<br><br>There are four notes instead of three, so three colons to separate them.<br>And the "*" is computerese for "times" (multiply).  The chord is C:D#:F#:A.<br>The values line up as follows:<br><br>  note name     whole number    small (possibly fractional) number<br>  ---------     ------------    ----------------------------------<br>  C             192             4*16/15 (= 64/15)<br>  D#            225             5<br>  F#            270             6<br>  A             320             4*16/9 (= 64/9)<br><br>The "whole numbers" are the smallest numbers I could find that were not<br>fractions.  Unfortunately, the more notes there are in the chord, the bigger<br>these numbers tend to get.  That's why I showed the alternative, "small<br>(possibly fractional) numbers".<br><br>By using the small numbers, you can easily see that D#:F# = 5:6 (instead of<br>having to take 225:270, dividing each number by 45; " 225/5 : 270/5 " =<br>5:6).  If you take parts of the chord two-notes-at-a-time, the numbers stay<br>smaller.  This table shows all the two-note combinations in the C:D#:F#:A chord:<br><br>                C       D#      F#      A<br>            +---------------------------------<br>        C   |   1/1     75/64   45/32   5/3<br>        D#  |           1/1     6/5     64/45<br>        F#  |                   1/1     32/27<br>        A   |                           1/1<br><br>Another way to look at it (if you really want to go nuts) is to represent<br>each of the whole numbers as products of prime numbers, as follows:<br><br>  note name     whole number    prime number breakdown<br>  ---------     ------------    -----------------------------<br>  C             192             2*2*2*2*2*2  *  3<br>  D#            225                             3*3    *  5*5<br>  F#            270             2            *  3*3*3  *  5<br>  A             320             2*2*2*2*2*2            *  5<br><br>You might ask "Why (on earth) do that?"  Because it's easy to cancel common<br>factors when all the prime factors are known.  For example, take F#/D#:<br><br>    F#      270    2 * 3*3*3 * 5       2 * 3       6<br>    --  =  -----  ---------------  =  -------  =  ---<br>    D#      225      3*3 * 5*5           5         5<br><br>(Notice the "canceling" two of the 3's and one of the 5's.)<br><br>By the way, this is where that term "5 limit just intonation" comes from -<br>none of the "prime number factors" are bigger than 5.  If you considered "7<br>limit", then 7's would end up in some of the prime number breakdowns.<br><br>So that's my short explanation.  (I know; with short explanations like that,<br>who needs long ones.)<br><br>Thanks again,<br>--Mark<br>+------------------------------------------------------+<br>| Mark Nowitzky                                        |<br>| email:  nowitzky@pacificnet.net                      |<br>| www:    http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky          |<br>|         "If you haven't visited Mark Nowitzky's home |<br>|         page recently, you haven't missed much..."   |<br>+------------------------------------------------------+</div>
