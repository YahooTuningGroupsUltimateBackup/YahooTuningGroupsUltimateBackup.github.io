It is identical to<br>>Ellis' "Duodene", is it not?<br><br>It seems to me it is, although it is usually more common to center it on<br>"C", rather than on "D", as most people find the fingerings easier this way.<br><br><br>>I was playing with this the other day and started playing Pachelbel's<br>>Canon in D. D major is in fact one of the two "major" keys available in<br>>this tuning (the other is Bb), where each key has the I, iii, IV, V, and<br>>vi chords in tune. The Canon has exactly these chords, so it should have<br>>worked perfectly, right? Not at all. The E in the melody over the<br>>B-minor chord, though just a passing tone, sounded horrible, and the B<br>>neighbor tone sounded awful over the A-major chord. I must conclude that<br>>the only reasonable keyboard tuning for even the simplest triadic<br>>diatonic music is some form of meantone temperament.<br><br>I agree- if I understand what you mean by "triadic diatonic", and if we are<br>limited to 12 tones.  I will add that this tuning is good, even with only<br>12 tones, for types of music other than "triadic diatonic".  Terry Riley<br>has done some nice minimalist-type stuff with it on his album "The Harp of<br>New Albion".<br><br><br>Carl</div>
