That way<br>> you can clearly hear a change in the beats if the pitch changes.<br><br>     Thanks Bill for the excellent suggestion.  I repeated some of the<br>experiments using that method with a sine wave voice, and agree it is<br>in fact a more reliable and sensitive technique.  All pitch changes<br>that had been detected by the overtone method were confirmed as real<br>by the reference tone technique, but in addition some new pitch<br>differences were revealed that had escaped detection before.  In<br>general the qualitative conclusions reached earlier were confirmed.<br><br>    The reference tone method made it possible to tighten up the<br>quantitative estimates for the Sound Canvas (Roland SC-55mkII).  It<br>appears that when set at a pitch bend range of +/-1, the Sound Canvas<br>has a pitch bend resolution of 8 bits everywhere except in the pitch<br>bend region from 8065 to 8319, where instead of the expected three<br>pitch changes there are none at all.  The beat count shows that the<br>omission is not compensated for by a correspondingly larger pitch<br>change across that region.  This would appear to be a design flaw.  If<br>so it is an unfortunate one for microtonalists, because it introduces<br>a gratuitous additional error of 2.34 cents into intervals whose end<br>points are tuned by pitch bends of opposite sign (8192 being<br>equivalent to a pitch bend of zero).  If it were not for this<br>aberration, Sound Canvas owners would enjoy a maximum error of<br>resolution of 0.78 cents.  Another unit that I tested (Fatar GS 1000R)<br>did not exhibit this peculiar behavior.<br><br>      Thanks also to John Loffink for his clarifying remarks, among<br>them:<br><br>> What you have uncovered is the underlying pitch resolution or pitch<br>> quantization of the instrument, whether adjusted by pitch bend or<br>> any other controller, envelope, LFO, etc.  Manufacturers (except<br>> Symbolic Sound and Justonic) never publish these specs, and very few<br>> people have investigated them.<br><br>This being so we would do well to report to John anything new about<br>the resolution of particular models that we discover by<br>experimentation, so that he can (if willing) post the information on<br>his useful web site (http://freeweb.pdq.net/jloffink/default.htm).<br><br>    --Bill Cooper, U.C.
