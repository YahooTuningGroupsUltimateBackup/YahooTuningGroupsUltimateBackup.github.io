This program is meant to be a pre-compositional tool that scans<br>and/or modifies chords along the dimension of dissonance - an uneasy concept if<br>there ever was one; here it is perhaps best understood as referring to<br>something like the opacity of chords: the degree to which it might be difficult<br>to "hear through them" any new sound not already contained in them. Be that as<br>it may; we let the test measure what it does, in fact, measure and its<br>usefulness remain to be seen. <br><br>ASSUMPTIONS. A chord's dissonance is assumed to be a function of its component<br>intervals. Intervals within the octave are ordered from dissonant to consonant<br>(minor second - major seventh - major second -minor seventh - augmented<br>fourth/diminished fifth - all thirds and sixths - perfect fourth - perfect<br>fifth - octave), and all intervals wider than those are proportionally<br>downgraded, a minor second plus octave taking the value of a major seventh, a<br>major seventh plus octave taking the value of a major second, and so on.<br>Furthermore, the possible contribution of a tone that has also its own lower<br>octave(s) in the chord is correspondingly lessened. <br><br>In the first place, the program may be used as a chordscanner. In that case, it<br>displays four things: 1) each note's contribution to the chord's overall<br>dissonance, 2) the chord's dissonance total, which is a number such that if you<br>subtract from it the contribution of any of the chord's component notes<br>(octaves make for exceptions here, sorry), you get the total of another chord<br>that is just like this one except for the absence of that component note; 3)<br>the dsg ("dissonance grading"), which is twice that total divided by the number<br>of component notes, and 4) the dsg class, which positions the chord in one of<br>the five musically interesting subareas in the dissonance continuum we have<br>seen fit to number, roman-style, I through V, in the following way: <br><br>dsg class: I   II  III    IV    V<br>       <br>dsg:    0 -->3 -->8 -->21 -->55 --><br><br>In the second place, the program may be used in some preparatory stage of<br>musical composition. It will try to increase or to diminish, at your choice,<br>the dissonance of any chord you care to specify. It offers you the choice of<br>two ways to do it: (1) by setting it a target dsg, and letting it work its way<br>toward that target for as far as it can, or (2) by parallel subset (semitone)<br>motion. <br><br>Option (1): Going for a Target<br><br>When (after entering your starting chord) you choose the Target option, the<br>program prompts you for the dissonance to be realized. It then sets about<br>attaining this goal in the smallest possible number of (minor or major second)<br>steps, keeping you informed of its progress through its screen and/or printer<br>output. In determining the steps to be taken it is guided by principles<br>essentially akin to those governing voice-leading, such as: in diminishing<br>dissonance, take first the tone contributing most to it; do not conflate two<br>tones into one, etc., and the converse for increasing dissonance. This strategy<br>results in a tendency towards equal distribution of dissonance: extremely<br>unequal contributions of individual notes, which (I think) make for the special<br>combination of spiciness and clarity of many jazz chords, become less likely as<br>the program proceeds in this mode. The other limitation inherent in the target<br>mode lies in the fact that, e.g., starting with eight pitches within a space of<br>an octave you obviously cannot get below a certain dissonance. If you don't<br>like these limitations, use, or mix in, the parallel subset and the<br>change-by-hand modes. <br><br>Option (2): Parallel Subset Motion<br><br>When you choose this option, you accept primes as intervals - two pitches, in<br>working consonance, may get fused into one. (The only way of achieving the<br>converse, i.e. of splitting a single tone in two, is to do it by hand.) Next,<br>you actually enforce change: if the chord was already maximally consonant, and<br>you try to make it more consonant still, you end up with a slightly less<br>consonant chord instead. Lastly, Parallel Subset Motion, or PSM for short,<br>brings home a freedom that every composer working with this program will have<br>to face: it does find effective and elegant ways of changing a chord's<br>dissonance, but it does not tell you much about the precise spatial relations<br>of the resulting two consecutive chords. It may propose you a subset motion of<br>three pitches out of five: obviously, you may do better by moving the other<br>two, or by moving the whole chord in steps of different lengths for its two<br>subchords. (Note that this goes not only for PSM: the results of the Target<br>option leave you with exactly the same kind of freedom; as we all know, letting<br>an (almost) whole chord move in order to relieve the dissonance of even a<br>single motionless note is not unheard of in good music.) <br><br>THE HINDEMITH ROOT. As an extra bonus, the user gets the chord's root thrown<br>in, as it is computed by applying a slightly generalized version of the<br>Hindemith Unterweisung im Tonsatz method. Because of the generalizations<br>results will not always coincide with Hindemith's own. Thus, the program will<br>not balk at chords with less than three pitches; it will also assign their<br>roots to chords considered to be undecidable, such as the augmented triad, the<br>chord built up out of two perfect fourths, and the diminished seventh chord,<br>and it will do that by applying the same methods as everywhere else. Most<br>importantly, we are in disagreement with the master because we think that his<br>method, dependent as it is on the analysis of isolated chords, provides no<br>solid basis at all for musical composition. (Composers are, as always, on their<br>own.) However, its results are never simply foolish, which is why we have<br>included it. An example. The user should suspend any notions about chords being<br>incomplete - for the program, all chords are complete, and the chord c4-b4-d5<br>is assigned b4 as its root, because the third is the best interval contained in<br>it. One might therefore say that, if the chord is incomplete after all, the<br>program would have preferred to add f#4 and a4 to it rather than e4 and g4.<br>Hindemith-style serious results are to be expected only for complete chords. <br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 21 Mar 1997 22:06 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08231; Fri, 21 Mar 1997 22:06:06 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08228<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id NAA24572; Fri, 21 Mar 1997 13:02:25 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 21 Mar 1997 13:02:25 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95.970321124128.5495A-100000@equinox><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
