Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/1998 12:40:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I must admit that with enough distortion, 8:10:14:19 is the preferable<br>tuning for this chord, since distortion creates high-order difference<br>tones. However, we're talking about so much distortion that the<br>individual notes cease to be audible and all that remains is a harmonic<br>series above 1. I don't think even Jimi often took distortion to that<br>extreme. You would have to overdrive a transistor amp to get an idea of<br>the extreme distortion I'm talking about. Think of the distortion sound<br>in "Revolution" (fast version) by the Beatles. I think that's transistor<br>distortion. Vacuum tubes (or a simulation thereof) are the usual means<br>of effecting a distorted guitar sound and they have a way of letting the<br>individual notes ring through.</div>
