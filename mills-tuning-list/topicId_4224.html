This seems like an important grammatical feature without which<br>>the sense of the scale as a fixed melodic basis could be very difficult<br>>for a composer to convey. Stronger requirements such as Rothenberg<br>>propriety (which requires that a given number of scale steps always<br>>subtends an interval smaller than the smallest interval subtended by<br>>that number plus 1 scale steps) seem less useful as they exclude such<br>>common scales (such as the Pythagorean diatonic) from consideration.<br><br>I think agree, but isn't propriety a different measure than yours, rather<br>than a "stronger" one?  That is, a scale could be proper without having a<br>1:1 relationship between its consonances and scale steps?<br><br>[Wolf]<br>>Hearing highly structured, non-tonal music in these temperaments may not<br>>reflect the modes of audition closest to the biases of the physiological<br>>system, but it does remind one ... that musical cognition, with training,<br>>can be a far richer resource than the ear alone.<br><br>Richer resource of what?  The two are different things entirely.  Lack of<br>acoustic pleasure does not prevent the delivery of beautiful symmetries,<br>no.  And the World's most harmonious just scale will not deliever musical<br>symmetries if it is not designed and used as the resources of human memory<br>require.<br><br>>I can't help but note that I find it surpring that Mr. Erlich is framing<br>>his argument in this way. His own work in 22tet is within a system whose<br>>set and group properties are certainly more useful than the quality of its<br>>representation of ratios of small whole numbers.<br><br>I think I agree with this one.  However, although I say that the "lack of<br>acoustic pleasure does not prevent the delivery of beautiful musical<br>symmetries", it may help.  Mr. Erlich's ideas on consonance, as I<br>understand them, are designed to measure within what tolerance acoustic<br>pleasure may help set and group properties.<br><br>There is another, much finer tolerance, which measures only acoustic<br>pleasure.  Thru the 7-limit, it about one cent for tones of the same timbre<br>and spatial location, and 4 cents for tones of different timbre or location.  <br><br>Where Mr. Erlich and I differ is on the matter that having pure just<br>intonation should exclude desirable group properties.  The 5-limit diatonic<br>scale works really well in just intonation, and I think that, despite the<br>more numerous and larger commas, his decatonic scales would as well.  This<br>is because any sensitivity to mistuning in melody (making comma<br>adjustments) must be at least an order of magnitude rougher than the<br>acoustic pleasure tolerance of 1-4 cents.<br><br>Carl</div><h3><a id=8879 href="#8879">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/1998 5:20:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>For the record, I took Judith conrad statements as a humorous support of<br>my previous post.
