Although I agree with the idea that microtonal musicians<br>need to master their "axes" if we are to make any real contribution to the<br>music of our day, I am not so ready to e mbrace his thoughts on<br>improvisation.  Although improvisation may be a skill helpful to the<br>mastery of a particular musical instrument I am not convinced that in<br>itself it adds anything to ultimate musical expierence.  Nor do I feel<br>that improvisational s kill leads to more creative musical expression.  In<br>fact it much more readily falls into the realm of noodling than much of<br>the so-called Western classical repertoire. <br><br>I suppose it ultimately boils down to a discussion of why we make music in<br>the first place.  On the surface I suppose it is a livilhood, but this is<br>only because at some point it fulfills or has fulfilled some deeper need.<br>Whether enhancing religious or political ceremonies, ancient or modern,<br>music has and does affect the spiritual nature of humanity.  I believe<br>this effect can lead either towards that which unifies, enlightens,<br>liberates and enobles life, in a word, "the Good," or can disintegrate<br>(which some may also describe as liberation), enthrall and bind, leading<br>to chaos and Death, in a word, "Evil."  These words have overtones which<br>some may find disagreeable, but the effect cannot be described in simpler<br>terms.<br><br>Musicians do potentially wield great power and inevitably follow one of<br>two paths.  Mostly though, we are unconscious, perhaps numbed by the<br>acoustical pollution our Western civilization creates.  I do not believe<br>there is a single place in the United States, or Europe for that matter,<br>were it is possible to experience silence.  I am sure there are very few<br>who are aware of the effect that airplane and automobile noise has, and<br>when one can escape from that, the hum of the refridgerator or computer or<br>the electric lights, even on the tops of mountains the "inaudible"<br>electromagnetic radio and TV and short wave radiation impinges upon our<br>psyches--these things affect our music--we can't get away from these<br>things!--HOW CAN WE EXPERIENCE THE SILENCE FROM WHICH SPRINGS THE MUSIC<br>OF THE SOUL!!!  It is almost impossible nowadays to even imagine, let<br>alone experience, the impact of Beethoven's music during his time--it has<br>driven our civilization for centuries, for better and worse.  It is not<br>merely a new scale we need--they are as prevalent as christian sects--nor<br>mastering a musical instrument; technicians abound--witness: 300<br>applications for 2nd bassoon position in San Franscisco Symphony not too<br>long ago. <br><br>Music is a musician's quest for truth--no more, no less. As that<br>expression of truth is able to liberate his soul, so does his music<br>enlighten and move the world.<br><br>Cheers to all in the forthcoming year!<br>Bruce Kanzelmeyer<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 10 Jan 1997 05:39 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA15668; Fri, 10 Jan 1997 05:42:28 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA15679<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id UAA29117; Thu, 9 Jan 1997 20:42:25 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 9 Jan 1997 20:42:25 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.94.970109233409.8692A-100000@minerva.cis.yale.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4574 href="#4574">ðŸ”—</a>prent@VNET.IBM.COM</h3><span>1/10/1997 10:25:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>   Adam at Yale wrote:<br>><br>>   This is a question for all of you master-craftspersons out there.

I call them finger piano's<br>instead of thumb piano's, since you play them with your fingers, much<br>like a piano. I still use one that is tuned to 31 tones to the octave,<br>arranged as in Erv Wilson's Bosanquet layout. Another has 12 tones in<br>just to the 13 limit on C and F. Each is amplified. One uses a contact<br>microphone and the others use magnetic transducers much like guitar<br>pickups. The key to tuning them is to make sure that a pronounced<br>overtone is tuned, as well as the fundamental. I found that adding a<br>generous dollop (technical term) of rosin core solder to the ends of<br>the low notes helps bring the overtone two octaves above the<br>fundamental. Otherwise it is two octaves and a major third above, and<br>very unpredictable. File off excess solder until the overtone is in<br>tune with the fundamental, then shorten or lengthen the tongue until<br>the fundamental is in tune with the note desired.<br><br>I use .010 spring steel 3/16" wide for the tongues. This produces a<br>very soft sound, which requires amplification to be properly heard.<br>But it is very easy to work with and sounds nice. Multiple ranks can<br>be made with proper design of the tongue support structure.<br><br><br>As many ranks as you need, top view:<br><br>     ---------------------------------<br>           +              +              brass bars secured with screws<br>     ---------------------------------<br>       \ \    \ \    \ \     \ \         spring steel tongues under the first<br>     ---\-\----\-\----\-\-----\-\-----   brass bar and over the next brass bar<br>         \ \    \ \    \ \     \ \<br>     -----\-\----\-\----\-\-----\-\---<br>       \ \ \ \\ \ \ \\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \<br>     ---\-\-\ \\ \-\ \\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-<br>         \ \ \+\\ \ \+\\ \ \+\ \ \ \+\  <--- solder on the tip<br>     -----\-\----\-\----\-\-----\-\--+<br>           \ \    \ \    \ \     \ \<br>     ---\- -\ \\ \-\ \\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-<br>         \ \ \+\\ \ \+\\ \ \+\ \ \ \+\<br>     -----\-\----\-\----\-\-----\-\--+<br>           \ \    \ \    \ \     \ \<br>     ---\- -\ \\ \-\ \\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-<br>         \ \ \+\\ \ \+\\ \ \+\ \ \ \+\<br>     -----\-\----\-\----\-\-----\-\--+<br>           \ \    \ \    \ \     \ \<br>            \+\    \+\    \+\     \+\<br><br>Side view:<br><br>                    +/    <--- solder tip<br>                    /<br>                   /<br>                  /    <--- .010" 3/16" spring steel<br>                 /<br>                /<br>               /<br>              /<br>   +------+  /+------+<br>   !      ! / !      !  <--- 1/4" x 3/8" brass bar (approximate)<br>   +------+/  +------+<br><br>Secure to a steel or wooden base with screws.
