If it is just a<br>chance to rejoice at one's ability to produce identical 12-tet every time,<br>any other tuners who are likely to be there and I should get together and<br>picket it...>><br><br>      All the classes are published well in advance, but this Temperament<br>Festival is anything but ET!!!!!   <br>    Skip is going to have a variety of temperaments,(there are also others in<br>there tuning their own, etc....),  and there is going to be a crowd of<br>technicians that will be there to judge, listen, allow how this and that, and<br>just in general, get their temperament awareness raised.  This is good, for<br>all of us. <br>     The assault on ET, that McClaren so pointedly gave voice to on this forum<br>in years past, is now joined by a number of piano technicians. There is good<br>solid controversy on the Pianotech list right now, concerning ET vs WT vs MT,<br>(nobody championing Pythagorean or Just, at the moment).  We have the staunch<br>adherents of ET, cursed as they are with the status quo, but the temperament<br>crusade is continuing to advance.  <br>      I don't resent or dislike ET (it's been worth a great deal of money to<br>me all these years), but I, like a growing number of tuners, have come to<br>dislike the hegemony of it.  This is the target  for all of us that are into<br>alternative tunings of any sort.  Getting the public to take that first step<br>off of the familiar is the most important thing to get done first, and<br>professional tuners are in a good position to do it, or at least help.  <br>     Anne Beetem, Susan Halligan, and I have all released CD's that feature<br>tunings other than ET.  There is more to follow, I am sure.  <br>     I have been listening to H'sticks latest, as well as Kirnberger and his<br>buddies.  I like them all <br>Regards, <br>Ed Foote<br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn.</div>
