Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/1997 1:38:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>While I personally am in favor of as diverse as possible a plurality of<br>tunings, polymicrotonality, omnimicrotonality, etc., as long as the<br>results are musical, there is a history of attempts to identify "the<br>next step" in Western tuning after 12-equal; here are some<br>equal-tempered examples:<br><br>8.2021: Bohlen, Pierce<br>16: Goldsmith<br>19: Salinas, Yasser<br>20: Balzano<br>24: Wychnegradsky<br>31: Huygens, Fokker<br>36: Gawel<br>41: von Janko<br>53: Mercator (did he strictly look at 3-limit? Who was the first to note<br>the applicability of 53 to 5-limit?)<br>72: Richter-Herf (Partch missed this in his list -- it would have<br>disturbed him that an ET could come so close to 11-limit JI!)<br><br>My paper is just another proposition along these lines, but it is, I<br>feel, the strongest one. I do believe that composers must be given an<br>alternate set of tools than 12-tone keyboards, guitars, etc. for<br>xenharmonic music to have a chance to naturally evolve. If the goal is<br>to ditch diatonicism but preserve the principles behind Western tonality<br>with minimal alteration, I believe 22 is the best way to go. And<br>harmonically, if JI is your goal, and if you believe the basic harmonies<br>of the diatonic scale in classical compositions can be "bent" by<br>variable-pitch instrumentalists to achieve just 5-limit triads, then the<br>basic harmonies of my 10-tone scales in 22 can be bent by about the same<br>amount to achieve just 7-limit tetrads. 22 also happens to be an<br>important number in describing ancient Indian tuning and if modern<br>accounts of that tuning (basically 5-limit JI) are correct, a 22-tone<br>"well-temperament" can be constructed which combines very close<br>approximations of the ancient Indian scales with a few keys of my<br>7-limit decatonic scales. This is analogous to a 12-tone<br>well-temperament with 6 pure fifths in a row and 6 fifths diminished by<br>1/6 pyth. comma, which contains both a pythagorean scale (in 1 key) and<br>a meantone scale (in 1 key).<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET><br>Subject:  Re: Woodwind etc<br>PostedDate:  21-11-97 03:15:17<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  21-11-97 03:13:52-21-11-97 03:13:52,21-11-97 03:13:58-21-11-97 03:13:59<br>DeliveredDate:  21-11-97 03:13:59<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256556.000C3E4F; Fri, 21 Nov 1997 03:13:43 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04535; Fri, 21 Nov 1997 03:15:17 +0100<br>Date: Fri, 21 Nov 1997 03:15:17 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04532<br>Received: (qmail 26967 invoked from network); 20 Nov 1997 18:15:08 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 20 Nov 1997 18:15:08 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.95.971120210234.24762A-100000@u1.farm.idt.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6471 href="#6471">ðŸ”—</a>jpff@maths.bath.ac.uk</h3><span>11/25/1997 1:02:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>As usual I can offer the ftp.maths.bath.ac.uk:pub/dream site<br>==John<br>>>>>> "greg" == greg phillips <gphillip@senet.com.au> writes:<br><br> greg> Hi everyone,<br><br> greg> I've written a little tuning program for windows (similar to a DOS<br> greg> program some people have already tried).
