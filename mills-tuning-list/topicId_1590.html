Two of the group went to Syria to study for 3 months last year. They<br>also came back with a qanuun that has quarter tone levers, which I understand<br>to is common to even student models. I hear you can also get 9 comma models,<br>though I don't how that is based, ie what comma or how many steps to an<br>octave. However the quarter tone model is usually based on 12 tet tuning<br>(open strings) but is functionally 24 tet.<br>Another friend has been in Turkey for the last 2 years studying they're<br>classical music, she's comming back in a couple of weeks so I'll quiz her<br>more about current tunings.<br><br>John Gzowski<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 23 Jan 1997 21:37 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13289; Thu, 23 Jan 1997 21:37:16 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13298<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA04846; Thu, 23 Jan 1997 12:37:12 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 23 Jan 1997 12:37:12 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.970123090954.26248A-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
