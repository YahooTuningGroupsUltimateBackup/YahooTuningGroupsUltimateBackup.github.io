In April I saw a performance of "Li Po" by Harry Partch, and on <br>Saturday I was fortunate to see Lamonte Young and The Forever Bad Blues Band <br>perform.  The Knitting Factory have their own web page: <br>www.knittingfactory.com and are well known around here as being the home <br>base for John Zorn.<br><br>I was properly prepared for the trip by having received my Neil Haverstick <br>tape "The Gate" that afternoon in the mail, so the 40 minute trip from my NJ <br>home ended up with some rolling 19tone guitar as I parked at the curb 20 <br>feet from the Knitting Factory.  (For area locals, plenty of free parking on <br>the streets.)  (Here's a quote an earlier post by Neil: "And, may I humbly <br>state, I myself have a project available (cassette only at this point)' "The <br>Gate", which features six 19 tone pieces among others...it is very loud and <br>heavy guitar music...great for microtonal parties and driving fast. For <br>tuning forum members I'll let it go for a mere $5.00...write to Box 150271, <br>Lakewood Colo. 80215...hope to hear from some of you...Hstick")<br><br>Lamonte's band included Jon Catler on fretless and alternate tuning guitar, <br>a custom-built Schechter stratocaster clone with replaceable fretboard and a <br>Mesa Boogie amp, Brad Catler on fretless bass, and Jonathon Kane playing a <br>Pearl drum kit.  Lamonte used a JI-tuned Korg M1.<br><br>Lamonte started out with an extended keyboard part, using what I guess in <br>General Midi would be a "celeste" or maybe "detuned guitar" sound that was <br>percussive enough to shake the room yet had clean decay that allowed the <br>beat interactions between the notes to come through.  I'm not sure what key <br>or specific tuning system he was using, but the minor third that dominated <br>the first 20 minutes of the 2:45 set seemed to be "flat" compared to 12tet. <br> After another 20 minutes or so of densely packed notes, perhaps best <br>described as frantic arpeggios, the bass joined in and some time later the <br>guitar and drummer joined the flight.<br><br>Earlier I'd read about "Just Stompin'", a Lamonte Young album that took an <br>hour to unravel before the first chord change!  Based on this description, I <br>somehow expected a long droning buildup of tones and was prepared for an <br>evening of intellectually compelling but perhaps unpleasant and inacessible <br>music.<br><br>Instead got a performance that would have done justice to John McLaughlin if <br>he'd continued looking forward rather than retreating to jazz cliches, or <br>perhaps something Jimi Hendrix would be playing today if he were alive.  The <br>guitar solos dominated the remainder of the show, as Jon showed an amazing <br>talent for the traditional rock guitarist arts of controlled feedback and <br>tone control with the subtler arts of a violonist.  Overall, the music had a <br>distinct 2-bar pattern similar to The Cream's "Sunshine Of Your Love" <br>(forgive the comparison), with a very strong beat.  The guitar-heavy nature <br>of the last 2/3 of the piece were acknowledge by Lamonte by letting Jon's <br>guitar, rather than the keyboard, have the final notes before fadeout.<br><br>Being the FBBB's first set of gigs in two years, the performers after the <br>show were swamped with well-wishers and fellow musicians trading information <br>and tips.  Despite the distractions, Jon Catler took some time to explain <br>the guitar setup and let me know that he, his brother Brad, and the drummer <br>Jonathon Kane have just released their own CD entitled "Crash Landing."  Jon <br>knows Neil Haverstick, and will be attending the Microstock Festival.  I <br>should have been more alert and more persistent in getting a description of <br>Jon's fretted setup and tuning -- perhaps Neil Haverstick could provide a <br>paragraph or two or track Jon down and get a description posted?  The frets <br>were not straight across in a standard N-tone tet.<br><br>Based on this performance, I'm moving Lamonte's "Just Stompin'" from my <br>"weird alternate tuning album I might buy because I suppose I should" to a <br>"must buy and play on a regular basis" and adding "Crash Landing" to my <br>must-buy list as well.<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 10 Jun 1996 16:50 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA27501; Mon, 10 Jun 1996 07:50:56 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 10 Jun 1996 07:50:56 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199606101446.HAA27004@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
