Almost every other instrument in an orchestra is<br>>capable of some real-time microtuning by skilled musicians.<br><br>>12ET is a theory that is honored largely in the breach.<br><br>>Mostly the 12 is really some subset, and the ET is squeezed<br>>toward JI as much as possible.<br><br>>Just listen.<br><br>>Marion<br>-------------------------------<br><br>Microtones are present in all the intervals made by free-intonation<br>instrumentalists.<br>When I was 12 I heard different records of the same piece played by the<br>greats violinists of my time. I didn't understand why the music academy<br>taught 12 tones per Octave and many more were heard. The notes were of<br>different frequencies but nobody answered this dicotomie.<br>This was the start point of my studies on tuning.<br>During their life, all the violinists use the "tonal material" in a<br>different form.<br>Twenty years ago In an ASA joint meeting I spoke to Carleen Hutchins about<br>Ruggiero Ricci and she affirmed what I was telling her, it is that RR was<br>the person who changed more the notes-frequencies in the same piece.<br>I didn't know if she knew this by ear or according to a rigourous work.<br><br>I ask to the forum, does anybody know about some publication on this topic ?<br><br><br>Eduardo<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>      Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi            e-mail : esabat@adinet.com.uy<br>Home: Simon Bolivar 1260       Office FAX-Phone : 598 2 900-0353<br>      11300 Montevideo               Home Phone : 598 2 708-0952<br>      Uruguay</div>
