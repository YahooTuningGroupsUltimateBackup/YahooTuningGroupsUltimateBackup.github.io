Before I go on I should<br>mention that my exposure to his music (like most people's I guess) is from<br>what is available internationally on CD. <br><br>>From my own work with rational tunings, I find that I get most out of them<br>either using long sustained tones or repeated patterns. This gives the<br>quality of the interval time to really resonate for me inwardly. Whereas the<br>short chippy sounds of much of Partch's music communicates well rhythmically<br>but I don't get much else out of it other than at an intellectual level.<br>That's fine, but... When I find slow sustained lines like some melodic<br>sections for the Adapted Viola (I'm thinking of Revelations in the<br>Courthouse Park) I wish he had done more stuff like that. <br><br>The other idea I'm mulling over at the moment relates to Otonalities and<br>Utonalities. Now, if I remember correctly, you get Otonalities by taking a<br>chunk of the harmonic series (for example harmonics 6 through 12) and<br>calling it a scale. Utonalities on the other hand (no I'm not going into the<br>debate about the existence of undertones) I understand best from Kathleeen<br>Schlesinger's work. For example if you fret a one string guitar in 16 equal<br>parts or you make similarly spaced holes in a flute you get a scale which is<br>the Utonality of 16. <br><br>OK (I hope I got that right) Now the 43 tone scale that Partch developed was<br>a mix of O and U tonalities to the 11 limit which creates a typically<br>palindromic structure. The idea, as far as I can judge, was to allow many<br>possibilities to the system that Partch was creating and to pre-empt the<br>criticism that monophony was limiting compared to the richness and<br>complexity of the 12TET key system.<br><br>The next step he made is the one I find discomfiting. Within a piece or a<br>passage or sometimes a line he will switch around between different<br>tonalities. Now since I do not have access to his scores, this comes from my<br>perceptions of his music and I am open to correction because it is this<br>switching around that I find creates the difficulty for me.<br><br>When I'm doing my thing musically, it makes sense to stick to either a U or<br>an O tonality structure for a piece. To mix them confuses me. Personally I<br>prefer working with the introverted quality of Utonalities, compared to the<br>more extraverted quality I perceive with Otonalities.  And so I find myself<br>asking if Partch's mixing of these two tonalities is the difficulty that I<br>and perhaps others have with his music. <br><br>I would be most interested in others comments/opinions<br><br>Brian Lee<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 8 Jun 1996 01:41 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id QAA25911; Fri, 7 Jun 1996 16:41:00 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 7 Jun 1996 16:41:00 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960607163848.13229F-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
