How thick is a fret?<br> <br>>Giving the frequencies of fretted notes doesn't <br>>specify the frequencies of the ghosttones you <br>>get when you touch the string directly above or <br>>near those frets.<br> <br>Of course the fretted frequencies are <br>the fretted frequencies.<br>The ghosttones producted by touching at these <br>positions are another value, which I am to test.<br> <br>>Please just give me a simple list of the ghosttones <br>>in your proposed series, with their frequencies and <br>>string positions, and don't include string positions <br>>which have no ghosttones--they just clutter the list.<br> <br>I will do as soon as I get back home and get it organised.<br> <br>>The best way to notate the string positions would <br>>probably be as a percentage of string length, since <br>>this can be translated to any string, and easily <br>>compared to other models of where vibrational<br>>nodes are found.<br> <br>Percentages sound fine to me: <br>So first octave would be 50% etc.<br> <br> <br>>That was your text, so you should know.<br> <br>I thought it was a "dumb" query. <br> <br>>Saying "usually related to..." is not a sufficient<br>>specification. <br> <br>Agreed! I need to test on a real instrument or string.<br> <br>>How is it that you don't already know the pitches of <br>>the ghosttone sequence for which you claim to have a <br>>better model? <br> <br>Because I did the experiments ten years ago, and I have moved house<br>thirty times in the meantime. The original results are probably in<br>the <br>barn in Herefordshire UK, and I am currently in Hilo, Hawaii.<br> <br> <br>>So the other frets which produce B's don't represent <br>>ghosttone positions?<br> <br>The other B's are really irrelevant, because you will get the same <br>result from each end of the string.<br>The only other B fret positions on the string which is tuned to "A", <br>will be on the second half of the string. i.e. >50%<br> <br>So all values for ghosttone positions will be 50% or less,<br>as the upper 50% will be a mirror image of the lower 50%.<br> <br> <br> <br>>Where does an octave fit into a sequence of fourths<br>>and fifths? As you know, no number of fourths and<br>>fifths will produce an octave (except in equal <br>>temperaments). <br> <br>At the first stage. i.e. at the 50% position.<br> <br>> and octave above (2nd octave fret); 3/4 of distance <br>> nut to bridge: <br> <br>>Same problem; octaves never occur in a sequence of<br>>fourths and fifths. Please explain this contradiction.<br> <br> An octave is an octave, is an octave.<br> <br> ratio 2/1 in these cases.<br> <br>Therefore ocatves are at 50%, 25%, 12.5% 6.25% etc.<br>yet which octave, I have yet to ascertain again.<br> <br>>Have you measured the frequencies of the open string<br>>and this ghosttone using a tuner to see if their<br>>interval ratio is indeed 2.988824? This would be an <br>>obvious first test of your model.<br> <br>Yes, yet it tells me more about the electronics and<br>limitations of my tuner, than about the string sounds<br>or frequencies it is supposed to be reading ....<br> <br>Counting beating against another nearby tuned string with<br>a metronome makes more sense to me.<br> <br>Charles Lucy<br><br>(Wonder if they continue surfing after dark?)<br>It's sunset here in hawaii.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 20 Feb 1997 06:34 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12205; Thu, 20 Feb 1997 06:34:57 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12078<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id VAA29205; Wed, 19 Feb 1997 21:32:57 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 19 Feb 1997 21:32:57 -0800<br>Message-Id: <330BDFD7.3AF7@ix.netcom.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4848 href="#4848">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MorriSonics@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/1997 9:07:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Forgive me if I'm getting involved in a side point here, but...<br><br>-------------------- Begin Original Message --------------------<br><br>Message text written by Neil:<br><br>"In 34 tone eq, you have a comma because of two separate circles of 5ths"<br><br><br>-------------------- End Original Message --------------------<br><br>   Weeeellll...  the two circles are a pseudocomma apart alright, but I'm<br>sure if 34TET's pseudocomma can be said to be because of its double circle<br>of fifths.  I suppose it may be OK to suggest the cause-effect in reverse. <br>And certainly there are double-circle systems that DON't have pseudocomma<br>problems, quartertones for example.  <br><br>   The pseudocomma in 34TET, 22TET, and 53TET are due to the same source as<br>the (real) comma in 5-limit JI:  The (major) third of a chord does not<br>appear four identical fifths above the root.  Four 34TET fifths above the<br>root of a chord is its supramajor third, 1/34 above the real major third.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 21 Feb 1997 06:11 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13358; Fri, 21 Feb 1997 06:11:05 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13352<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id VAA28353; Thu, 20 Feb 1997 21:09:20 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 20 Feb 1997 21:09:20 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199702210005_MC2-118C-A6B0@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
