Both the bulk dump and note-change messages are supported,<br>> and the product's been tested with JICalc on the Mac and Midi Tuning Wrench<br><br>So, like, has anybody on this list tried this?  How would I get a copy of<br>JICalc for the MAc?<br><br>Does the bulk dump let you arbitrarily remap any frequency to any key?<br>How long does it take to do a bulk dump; that is, can you make many bulk dumps<br>during a performance?  etc., etc.<br><br>I use Cubase on my Mac Powerbook, which, to the best of my knowlege, does not<br>support the bulk dump.  Anybody know of a sequencer that could record the bulk<br>dump messages along with your key events?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Marcus<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 4 Jan 1996 03:43 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id SAA03704; Wed, 3 Jan 1996 18:43:14 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 3 Jan 1996 18:43:14 -0800<br>Message-Id: <960104024043_71670.2576_HHB84-4@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
