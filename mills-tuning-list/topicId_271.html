But first I would like to give people <br>a chance to read it--it's been out only a few weeks.<br><br>I would also like to see other comments before I reply. Would anyone oblige?<br><br>In any case, I also recommend Xenharmonikon as a publication dealing with<br>microtonal music, especially to those on this forum who may not know it.<br>This has nothing to do with my article being in No. 16. All issues may be<br>obtained, I believe, both from Frog Peak Music on the east coast and from<br>the Just Intonation Store on the west coast. <br><br>==========================      =================================<br>Dr. Paul Rapoport               e-mail:	rapoport@mcmaster.ca<br>SADM (Music)	                   tel: 905 529 7070, ext. 2 4217<br>McMaster University                fax: 905 527 6793<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 7 Jan 1996 04:34 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id TAA02866; Sat, 6 Jan 1996 19:34:02 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 6 Jan 1996 19:34:02 -0800<br>Message-Id:  <9601061935.aa04485@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
