Maybe it's all been about<br>>  chasing our tail, and could have easily been boiled down to "non-12TET<br>>  musics".  I just don't think *everything* is microtonal. It has to be more<br>>  than a casual happenstance, at least on some level.<br><br>If I may jump in here, I'd like to postulate that it's all relative.  I'm<br>generally an non-relativistic kinda guy, at least philosophically.  You've<br>seen that demonstrated by my JI fascism. ;-)<br><br>But here, I think it really is a matter of perspective.  Hypothetically, how<br>would my European 11th-century forbears hear a 12-tET piece?  Would the pitch<br>relationships sound extraordinary to them?  I bet they would.  Probably<br>downright out-of-tune.  How about people who grow up with 7-tET or Pelog; do<br>they hear their own culture's tuning as microtonal?  I do.  But I bet they<br>don't.  On the other hand, when I hear Candlebox (rock band), I hear the<br>guitars as 12-tET and thus non-microtonal, but the lead singer, who is<br>intentionally all over the place pitch-wise (for emotive purposes) as<br>clearly, deliciously microtonal, both by comparison with his accompaniment<br>and with my ears' expectations.<br><br>It seems logical in a sense, but still a bit restrictive to me, to limit the<br>term to intervals smaller than a particular size.  That doesn't seem to make<br>for a very musically-useful definition since lots of music uses larger<br>intervals that are none-the-less different from what some might expect by<br>small-but-significant amounts.  E.g., 7/6 might be used with intervals that<br>are all more than 50 cents away from it, but it is less than 50 cents away<br>from what many ears expect of a "minor third."<br><br>So microtonal music may be, to a given listener, any music whose<br>compositional/performance model includes pitch relationships that the<br>listener finds to be beyond his own range of perceived normalcy.  I say<br>"compositional/performance model" to exclude performed pitches that miss the<br>performer's intended mark.  How's 'at?<br><br>Well, what happens when I get used to, say, 13-limit JI to the point that it<br>sounds normal to me?  Or what if I got used to a tuning that contained<br>intervals smaller than 50 cents?  O. K., I still know that most of my<br>audience will hear it as microtonal.  It's the listener, not the composer,<br>who defines microtonality.<br><br>David J.

I won't speak for Dan, but I consider music that uses intervals<br>smaller than a semitone to be microtonal not because they sound strange,<br>but because that's what the word's etymological basis is. Personally, I do<br>NOT consider slendro, Iranian music with 3/4 tones, 7TET, or mbira music to<br>be microtonal. I DO consider Carrillo and Partch to be microtonal (most of<br>the time).<br><br>If you are looking for a word that refers to the "strangeness" of the<br>sound, perhaps a better term would be "xenharmonic" (xen = foreign).<br>Personally, I've never grown attached to that neologism because of that<br>connotation, which, as you point out, is culturally and personally<br>relative. I happen to like Ken Wauchope's term "allotonal," meaning<br>"alternate" tuning, but it doesn't seem to have caught on.<br><br>One cannot deny Johnny's point that definitions change over time, but I<br>don't think it's likely that his extreme broadening (which, if I'm reading<br>right, is microtonal = pitch-based) will catch on. People intuitively take<br>"micro" to mean "very small" because it's used that way in so many words. I<br>think it is useful to have a word that refers to music with small<br>intervals, just like it's useful to have terms like "just intonation,"<br>"equal temperament," or "pitch-based."<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
