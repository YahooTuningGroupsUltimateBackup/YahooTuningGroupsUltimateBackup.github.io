I was really afraid of this question but I figure I'll do it this<br>way.<br><br>For all of those who absolutely have nothing to contribute but absolutely want<br>the tape, do this - e-mail me privately 1st and ask me if I'm not completely<br>innundated by requests and if I'm not then - sure! I'd be happy to make up<br>tapes for those not producing music. In fact, in a way, those not tied to<br>their own theories or music often times are the most open listeners and we all<br>could benefit from their ears, I think. So sure, go ahead and request and I<br>will try to accomodate those people as well as I can. But I must ask that<br>those requests come after all the contributing tapes are in, which should be<br>in about one month. This will allow me to see how many tapes I actually have<br>to deal with.<br><br>I've gotten some very positive feedback on this and that makes me happy. I<br>think this will be reasonably successful. In any case, once again....<br><br>Please send your cassette tape, blank tape and Self-addressed Stamped Envelope<br>to:<br><br>Denis Atadan<br>13 Washington Street<br>Newark, DE 19711<br><br>e-mail:<br><br>denis.atadan@mvs.udel.edu<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  stick@dnvr.uswest.net<br>Subject:  theories<br>PostedDate:  28-07-97 08:52:46<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  28-07-97 08:52:46-28-07-97 08:52:46,28-07-97 08:51:46-28-07-97 08:51:46<br>DeliveredDate:  28-07-97 08:51:46<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564E2.0025C747; Mon, 28 Jul 1997 08:52:38 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA21175; Mon, 28 Jul 1997 08:52:46 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 28 Jul 1997 08:52:46 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA21177<br>Received: (qmail 28789 invoked from network); 28 Jul 1997 06:52:28 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 28 Jul 1997 06:52:28 -0000<br>Message-Id: <33DC41F2.7912@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5915 href="#5915">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>7/28/1997 7:18:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>As I often find myself doing, I'd like to second Neil's most recent<br>request:  I too think it would be great, if somebody can spare a half hour<br>or so, to briefly list the essential underlying concepts, and summarize at<br>least some of the discussion that has gone down about them.

It should contain definitions of basic terminology and general<br>descriptions of the most common types of structures and scale generation<br>techniques.  From reading this list the past few months and browsing the<br>archives, it appears that many of the same topics get rehashed over and<br>over and over and over.  Some of the "tuning gurus" that inhabit the list<br>are surprisingly patient in explaining things repeatedly, but it seems that<br>they could save themselves some time by compiling these things into one<br>good document to stick onto someone's web page.  Obviously entire books<br>could be written on combination-product sets, etc. (and someone should do<br>so!) but at least some basic groundwork should be done for referring<br>commonly asked questions.  For example:<br><br>Why use equal temperament rather than JI (or vice versa)?<br>What is prime limit?  "" "" odd-limit?<br>What's a comma?<br>How is meantone tuned?  "" "" well-temperament?<br>What does MOS mean?<br>Where do I find information on tuning my synth/MIDI/guitar/piano/bagpipes<br>to scale X?<br>What's a harmonic series and what does it have to do with tuning?<br>What's a hexany/dekany/hebdomekontany, etc.?<br><br>I suppose if a really good definitive FAQ were compiled, 95% of the<br>discussion would disappear and the list would die.  Or maybe some of the<br>redundancy could be eliminated and the resulting discussions would be more<br>interesting with everyone (who takes the effort to read and understand the<br>FAQ) on an equal footing.<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Denis.Atadan@mvs.udel.edu<br>Subject:  Tape Swap Takes a Holiday<br>PostedDate:  30-07-97 20:55:40<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  31-07-97 16:42:35-31-07-97 16:42:37,31-07-97 16:41:22-31-07-97 16:41:22<br>DeliveredDate:  31-07-97 16:41:22<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564E5.0028060C; Thu, 31 Jul 1997 09:17:11 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA25610; Wed, 30 Jul 1997 20:55:40 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 30 Jul 1997 20:55:40 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA25612<br>Received: (qmail 13602 invoked from network); 30 Jul 1997 18:51:59 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 30 Jul 1997 18:51:59 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199707301849.OAA01509@copland.udel.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
