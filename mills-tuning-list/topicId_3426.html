Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/1998 12:05:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Ken, you appear to agree with me that the "limit" is best defined as the<br>largest odd, not prime, factor, in the ratios, when the intention is to<br>characterize the complexity of an interval's sound. Dave, I know you<br>just joined this forum, but I think your name was mentioned before in<br>that you (or someone named Ralph David Hill?) also believed that it is<br>the odd, not prime, limit, that best characterizes an interval's effect<br>(and affect?).<br><br>The majority of modern thinkers and writers on this subject appear to be<br>against us. There seems to be a pervasive (mis)conception that, for<br>example, an 81/64 pythagorean major third has some of the<br>"strong/steely" characteristics of the perfect fifth and fourth, while<br>the 5/4 just major third has a different, "sweet/emotional" character.<br>Supposedly, this is due to the "character" of the prime numbers 3 and 5,<br>respectively. To me, this sounds preposterous, as there seems to be no<br>mechanism or reason for the auditory system to be performing prime<br>factorizations. But due to association of certain intervals with the<br>tuning systems in which they occur, a sort of brainwashing seems to have<br>arisen around the prime limit concept. Do you guys agree with me? Shall<br>we have a go at preparing an article or Web page to defend our position?</div>
