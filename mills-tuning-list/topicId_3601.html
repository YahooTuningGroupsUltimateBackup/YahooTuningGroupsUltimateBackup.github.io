It seems strange coming from you,<br>since you say you disagree with this theory.<br><br>As an example, say we're examining an "augmented 5th"<br>or "minor 6th" of 807 cents.  This is exactly midway<br>(in cents) between the proportions 26:16 (= 13:8)<br>and 25:16.  Are you saying that the interval would be<br>recognized as 13 (= 13^1) rather than as 25 (= 5^2),<br>because 13 is a higher prime than 5, but a lower odd<br>number than 25?<br><br>That's what it sounds like you're saying to me, and it<br>seems contradictory to everything you've written on<br>the subject so far.  I'd be flabbergasted if I found<br>out you actually really agree with me for once --<br>I can't object to anything you're saying here, except<br>that, in real music, I'd rather *hear*  13/8 or 25/16 than<br>any old 807-cent ET approximation.<br><br>   Joseph L.
