But the majority<br>of the music in which he is the ONLY performer is very definitely premeditated<br>composition.  And of course I can't comment on music he hasn't sent me.  <br><br>   I just wanted to set the record straight there.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 3 Sep 1996 07:29 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA15396; Tue, 3 Sep 1996 07:30:49 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA15312<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA17711; Mon, 2 Sep 1996 22:30:47 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 2 Sep 1996 22:30:47 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199609030529.WAA09232@dnai.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
