Give me the lowest world record.)<br><br>The question is perhaps better approached by rewording it: "...can <br>perceive as a _pitch_?"<br><br>Remember that when we talk about "frequency" and "Hz" we are talking <br>about the number of modulations from 0 air pressure to +/- n air <br>pressure (amplitude) per second. You can _hear_ a 1 Hz tone; it is a <br>transient followed, 1000 milliseconds later, by another transient (tap <br>.. tap ... tap).<br><br>As you increase the frequency, you first hear these transients closer <br>together (um, more "frequently" -- amazing language, ain't it?) until <br>they start to sound more like a buzzing noise and, finally, a low hum (a <br>pitch!) at around 20 Hz.<br><br>(I'm feeling really nostalgic remembering Bob Snyder demonstrating this <br>to my first composition class, sticking a couple of cables into the e-Mu <br>synth on the wall of the classroom and cranking the frequency up & down <br>in the "threshold" zone. Everything I'm recycling here is derived from <br>his course text (of course I never throw _anything_ away)).<br><br>This happens because our brain processes sensory data in "frames" <br>approx. 30-50 ms long ... so discrete events which occur more frequently <br>than 20x per second seem to happen continuously (we cannot perceive <br>their absences between them). This is _exactly_ the same process by <br>which we see film -- a collection of still images -- as a seamless <br>moving image. The threshold below which we can detect flicker in a movie <br>projector is approx. 16-18 frames per second (i.e., 16-18 Hz.). (16 and <br>35mm cinema runs at 18 or 24 fps, (sound always at 24); but many super-8 <br>cameras and projectors run at 16 fps, a speed at which many people can <br>see flicker; at progressively slower speeds, more and more people can <br>resolve a succession of still images.)<br><br>(unfortunately, I can't find the _reader_ from that class, so I'm <br>dependent on the familiarity of names in the bibliography in the text <br>for suggestions ... you might try Lachman, Lachman & Butterfield, <br>"Characteristics of the Short-Term Store" in _Cognitive Psychology and <br>Information Processing_ (1979) (sorry, no editor listed here), Ernst <br>Poppel, _Mindworks--Time and Conscious Experience_ 1988), um, I'd be <br>guessing beyond that ... actually, I'm guessing *period* as to which <br>article had which data, so *definitely* don't quote *me* (e-mail me a <br>fax # & I'll send you the whole biblio))<br><br>Hope some of this helps...<br><br>-- -- -- -- -- -- -- / -- -- -- -- -- -- / -- -- ---- -- -- -- -- /<br> /                               /                 /<br>   /     /   I am not fond enough of lies to talk about truth<br>  /                                                  Aragon, 1926/<br> /                      /          /         <br> /           Jim Flannery            /          newgrange@sfo.com<br>/            Newgrange Media<br>/-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- / -- -- / -- /<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 28 Feb 1996 13:39 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id EAA12498; Wed, 28 Feb 1996 04:39:20 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 28 Feb 1996 04:39:20 -0800<br>Message-Id: <0099E96A741CE6B6.C63C@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
