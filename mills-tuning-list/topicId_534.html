Instead, our<br>challenge will be to explore the unknown and build the wild and free <br>cyberspace generating it by algorithms. Einstein's Daydream will bring <br>artistic and musical cyberspace designs a reality, available for the <br>millions who will access the world-wide information matrix," said Peter <br>Stone, president of Algorithmic Research. <br><br>Einstein's Daydream produces VRML 1.0 and VRML 2.0 Moving Worlds compatible<br>files that can be placed in servers, or processed further in VRML builder<br>programs. Algorithms can control VRML 1.0/2.0 language parameter fields, <br>and allow to create objects, animations, camera paths, behaviours, actions <br>and reactions. <br><br>Algorithms cover lsystems, fourier synthesis, noise, fractals, chaos,<br>oscillators, neurons, number theory, fibonacci sequences, prime numbers,<br>autocatalysis and processors, totaling over 400 functions applicable on <br>any VRML constructs, or MIDI. <br><br>MIDI file generation uses object-oriented SCOM language that covers musical<br>micro and macrostructures definable by algorithms. MIDI playback is based <br>on 256 channel operation, and is internal. A Netscape plug-in is supplied <br>to achieve the same resolution in servers. VRML file generation requires <br>an external VRML-compatible browser for viewing. <br><br>Einstein's Daydream is implemented in Lisp and runs on the Macintosh. Windows<br>version is under preparation and will be announced later this year. <br><br>Einstein's Daydream is targeted for advanced users for creating algorithmic<br>worlds and music, or experimenting and studying virtual architecture not<br>bound to physical constraints. <br><br>"The philosphy of Einstein's Daydream is simple: to supply the user a <br>toolbox of interoperative modular functions, that can be applied on <br>generating whatever there is possible in VRML and MIDI specifications. <br>As an ascii-written, user-extendable Lisp-based language Einstein's Daydream<br>does not represent limits of expression, but naturally requires a certain<br>decipline to adapt into algorithmic construction." <br><br>Features<br><br>Einstein's Daydream includes optimized development environment for editing <br>and maintaining code and accessing hypertext documents needed in program<br>development. The interface enables pasting of language macros for quick <br>coding and 2D viewing of parameter data. If you are not a programmer, this<br>environment will make you a programmer. <br><br>Einstein's Daydream uses open and modular software architecture. New functions<br>can be added snapping in plug-in modules. New modules can be programmed<br>online with build-in Lisp interpreter. The modules can be compiled into<br>fast-executing machine language with Macintosh Common Lisp, available through<br>Digitool. Document system can be expanded by dragging folders containing new<br>documents into the Documents folder. <br><br>Algorithmic Research is collecting a list of subscribers who would like to<br>obtain Einstein's Daydream for Windows at a reduced price for $100 to support<br>the porting costs. After porting the price will jump to the list price $495. <br>In case your company is interested in sponsoring the development, or if you<br>would like to subscribe the Windows version contact Peter Stone. Upgrade to<br>Einstein's Daydream will be available to SCOM Pro users for $199. Developer's<br>discount is available for persons who would like to start writing 3D <br>extension modules, or new scientific algorithms to Einstein's Daydream. <br><br>Specifications<br><br> Platform:<br>                    Macintosh<br> Operating System:<br>                    Mac OS<br> Minimum Memory:<br>                    8 MB RAM, 16 MB-32 MB suggested<br> VRML Generation:<br>                    VRML 1.0 (VRML 2.0 soon) <br> Music Generation:<br>                    MIDI<br> Nmbr. of Algorithms:<br>                    400+100<br><br>Further Information<br><br>Here are a couple of examples that show you the effect of algorithmic<br>construction of a hypercube, nested in levels 2 and 3 (VRML 1.0 file <br>format). cube32.wrl and cube33.wrl.
