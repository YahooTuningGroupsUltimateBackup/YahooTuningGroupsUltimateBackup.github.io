Bart Hopkins has a book on instrument design and<br>construction, called, aptly Musical Instrument Design on See Sharp Press tel.<br>520-628-8720 ,P.O. Box 1731 Tucson AZ 85702. It contains tonnes of practical<br>advice on materials construction and tuning references. Anyone interested<br>should e-mail bart at ExpMusInst@aol.com. The book contains some theories and<br>formulas as well as contacts for materials and lots of plans for different<br>simple instruments. Helmholz's book contains a few more mathematical models<br>for resonance if that is what you need, but if you are making any kind of<br>instrument, get this book.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 29 Mar 1997 19:29 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA21207; Sat, 29 Mar 1997 19:29:13 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA21208<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id KAA17766; Sat, 29 Mar 1997 10:26:37 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 29 Mar 1997 10:26:37 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541105af6204433d11@DialupEudora><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5236 href="#5236">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Jo A.

In this book, Tame takes an overall tone of<br>European racial superiority. His objections to jazz reflect a general<br>objection to any strongly rhythmic music -- to all of the musical forms<br>of Africa and the Middle East, for example. He also objects to any music<br>that constitutes a meeting of different musical genres. I believe his<br>phrase was "grotesque -- as all half-breeds are grotesque." These<br>objections were explicit; however, I don't have the book anymore and<br>can't offer exact quotes. I got rid of it because I found it overtly<br>racist and offensive, and not particularly well-written.<br><br>Far better books on this subject are:<br><br>Berendt, Joachim-Ernst, _The World is Sound: Nada Brahma, Music and the<br>Landscapes of Consciousness (Rochester, VT: Destiny, 1983)<br>Campbell, Don, ed., _Music: Physician for Times to Come_ (Wheaton, IL:<br>Quest/Theosophical Publishing Co., 1991)<br>Gardner, Kay, _Sounding the Inner Landscape: Music as Medicine<br>(Stonington, ME: Caduceus, 1990)<br>Hamel, Peter Michael, _Through Music to the Self_ (Boulder, CO:<br>Shambhala, 1976)<br>Goldman, Jonathan, _Healing Sounds: The Power of Harmonics_ (Rockport,<br>MA: Element, 1992)<br><br>Kathleen Seidel<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 2 Apr 1997 02:54 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01021; Wed, 2 Apr 1997 03:54:34 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01019<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id RAA08789; Tue, 1 Apr 1997 17:53:07 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 1 Apr 1997 17:53:07 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.16263@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
