Artists such as Muddy Waters, 'Big Boy'<br>Crudup, some of the so-called Guitar Evangelists, some early Gospel singers,<br>and so on, sing many neutral intervals.  A low minor 7th occurs very rarely,<br>and a low minor 3rd even less.<br><br>If ratios can describe intonation of 'blue' notes then the 11-limit would<br>describe such notes better.<br><br>Perhaps this subject has been done here before, if so I apologise,<br><br>sincerely,<br><br>Michael Dixon<br>MandLDixon@bigpond. com</div><h3><a id=8477 href="#8477">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/1998 6:22:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> It a sad fact of life that patents are issued<br>> every day for items and ideas in long and common use.<br><br>   Sorry if I'm getting too far off the subject of tuning here, but for the<br>record...<br><br>   You can apply for a "utility" patent (as opposed to a "design" patent,<br>which covers visual appeal rather than practical value), if the invention:<br>1.  Fits into a "statutory class".  The PTO (Patent and Trademark Office)<br>keeps a<br>   database of probably something like about 50,000 to 100,000 classes and<br>sub-<br>   classes of patentable topic matter.<br>2.  Is not a perpetual-motion machine.<br>3.  Is not a plant, in the biological sense of the word (there's a separate<br>type<br>   of patent for plants).<br>4.  Is not an already known idea.<br>5.  Is "unobvious".  (I always thought that that word should be<br>"nonobvious",<br>   but whatever...)  You can't patent something all of whose components are<br>   known, unless their combined effect is something surprising.  For<br>example,<br>   you can't patent asprin, but around the turn of the century, somebody<br>   patented putting asprin into pig feed, because he found (probably<br>accidentally)<br>   that doing so makes them reproduce more successfully.<br><br>   Almost invariably, a patent examiner initially rejects a patent<br>application for one of the last two criteria, and the applicant files a<br>"protest" explaining why the examiner's claims don't make sense.<br><br>   But anyway, as for a patented invention being "in long or common use", a<br>lot of people don't realize that patent law not only prohibits you from<br>patenting things that have not been patented before, but things that are<br>known in any way.  That then leads to what are called "defensive<br>publications", wherein you conclude that you can't or don't see enough value<br>in patenting something, so you instead write a detailed article in a major<br>industry journal about it, solely to prevent anybody else from patenting<br>it.  Probably somewhere around 20% of articles in engineering journals are<br>defensive pubs.<br><br>   Now, it's also important to understand the claims of a patent (typically<br>the last third of a patent, wherein the inventor states what s/he claims as<br>intellectual property).  They start extremely general and get more and more<br>specific.  A court will often throw out the first few claims because they're<br>just too general.  Patent attorneys include them largely to narrow the scope<br>of, or define terminology used in, the later claims.  Claim #4 of a lot of<br>patents read something like "a system as in claim 3 such that...".<br><br>   Although it's not likely, Yamaha might claim something as broad as a<br>guitar, knowing full well that anybody can defeat that claim, just so that<br>they can legally define what a guitar is for their later claims.<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1527<br>*************************</div><h3><a id=8497 href="#8497">ðŸ”—</a>aloe@rev.net</h3><span>9/20/1998 10:35:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>At 03:39 PM 9/9/98 -0400, John Starrett wrote:<br><br>>	I read with amusement and dismay Paul Hahn's reference to the <br>>patent issued to Yamaha for the use of 19TET on keyboards, guitars, wind <br>>and brass instruments.
