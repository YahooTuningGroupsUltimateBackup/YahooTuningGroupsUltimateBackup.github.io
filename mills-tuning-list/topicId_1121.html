In this<br>>respect, he is our earlist psychoacoustician.<br><br>This was exactly by point. Aristoxenos _heard_ twelve equal parts to the <br>octave. Neither he nor his contemporaries knew how to describe what he heard <br>in mathematical terms. But considering the close agreement between <br>Pythagorean tuning and 12-tet, it seems fair to say that Aristoxenus was <br>hearing logarithmically. The octave divided into twelve parts arithmetically <br>or harmonically gets you really horrible "Pythagorean" modes, and the fact <br>that later theorists tried to interpret Aristoxenus this way shows that the <br>proscription against irrationals was still strongly influencing scientific <br>thought.<br><br> -Paul<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 9 Nov 1996 04:42 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02410; Sat, 9 Nov 1996 04:43:49 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02403<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id TAA18488; Fri, 8 Nov 1996 19:43:46 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 8 Nov 1996 19:43:46 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199611082241_MC1-BCA-4765@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
