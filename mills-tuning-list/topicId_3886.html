It is largely tuned to Harmonic-17<br><br>Good luck with this piece and I hope to hear it someday. Are you<br>planning a second "Music of Johnny Reinhard" recording?<br><br>>However, when every<br>>single note is a 17-perspective, might the "-ness" resulting merely be<br>a<br>>manifestaion of the music's "17-ness"?<br><br>Not sure exactly what this means, but remember that individual notes can<br>have a numerical relationship only with other notes, and not standing on<br>their own. Certainly if a 1/1 is played as a drone, and other notes form<br>ratios of 17 with the drone, and the remaining notes are typically used<br>simultaneously with notes they form ratios of 17 with, then 17 will<br>define the harmonic norm of the piece and it can be said to project<br>17-ness, if such a thing is discernible at all. If there is no 1/1 in<br>the music, the 17s in the ratios for the other notes may fail to create<br>any actual ratios of 17 in the music, so projecting a sense of "17-ness"<br>in the sense it has been discussed would be difficult. On the other<br>hand, there are probably many simpler intervals in this tuning which<br>occur between notes which are all defined with 17 in the numerator, or<br>all with 17 in the denominator, and these intervals can easily come to<br>define the harmonic norm of the piece. Recall our earlier discussion<br>about Mayumi's Harmonic-13 piece -- Adam Silverman and I thought we<br>heard just 3/2 intervals in it, but you denied that the tuning had any.<br>When the details of the tuning finally became available, there were<br>several 3/2s to be found in it.<br><br>A lattice representation is more useful that a simple listing of ratios<br>relative to a single tonic for determining the harmonic resources of a<br>tuning. However, a 13-limit tuning may require at least 5 dimensions,<br>and a 17-limit tuning at least 6, so in many cases a single graphical<br>depiction of such tunings may not be able to clarify all its<br>relationships. However, I suspect that in the case of Harmonic-13 and<br>Harmonic-17, there may be simplifying features that could make a<br>graphical representation feasible.
