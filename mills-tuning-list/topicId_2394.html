Also, the pitchbend method would be<br>more accessible<br>to the kind of people whom i am aiming at- people with low-end soundcards<br>that might not support fine/course tuning changes.<br>The fine/course method does have its advantages, as it can have still have<br>polyphony on one channel, while the pitchbend method has to use seperate<br>channels.  It also has sure tunings of pitches, because it fine tunes in<br>cents.<br>Wouldn't it be cool if some mass-producing manufacturer such as<br>soundblaster would make a card that received two messages in addition to<br>modulation, velocity and controllers:<br>1) a 4-bit octave number, and<br>2) a floating point decimal from 1 to 1.99999999 that signifies the raw<br>ratio of the note.<br><br>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>[Peter Blasser, Oberlin College Mailroom Box #277, Oberlin, Ohio ,.<br>[Peter.Blasser@Oberlin.edu       .             .            .           .<br>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  DFinnamore@aol.com<br>Subject:  tuned tunes<br>PostedDate:  14-09-97 23:07:11<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  15-09-97 10:16:15-15-09-97 10:16:16,15-09-97 10:15:33-15-09-97 10:15:34<br>DeliveredDate:  15-09-97 10:15:34<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256512.0073FF31; Sun, 14 Sep 1997 23:06:59 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00875; Sun, 14 Sep 1997 23:07:11 +0200<br>Date: Sun, 14 Sep 1997 23:07:11 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00893<br>Received: (qmail 19189 invoked from network); 14 Sep 1997 21:07:08 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 14 Sep 1997 21:07:08 -0000<br>Message-Id: <970914170514_314762725@emout02.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
