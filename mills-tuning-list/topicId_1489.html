In the 1928 remastered CD performance of the C minor Cello<br>Suite, Casals expresses each note under in pitch to what it would be in<br>archetypical 12ET.  In fact, every note of both C minor and C major is<br>pitched below ideal 12ET placement.  In the only other minor key Suite <br>- D minor -which has its minor third sharper than ideal 12ET, Casals<br>played the opening motif with a sharpened third. <br><br>I understand Casals wrote about his ideas on expressive intonation<br>and I am quite curious to learn more.  However, it is highly<br>unlikely that Casals had any knowledge of how to track specific keys in<br>Werckmeister III.  Translation of the Werckmeister treatise of 1691<br>remains available only in archaic Thuringian German (and in an unpublished<br>English traslation by Oberlin undergrad Elizabeth Hehr).  <br><br>The clear implication is that Bach's music signaled to Casals an<br>expressive coloring for these 2 Suites (mainly prominent in the first<br>movement of each), the only minor keys used in the set of 6.
