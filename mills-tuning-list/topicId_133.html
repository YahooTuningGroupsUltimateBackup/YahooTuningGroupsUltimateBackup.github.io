It seems as if the entire state was participating, including <br>printed press, radio (NPR and a local), university, classical musicians, <br>citizens...<br><br>The audience was warm, full, and comfortable enough to enjoy a 3 hour <br>program.  On a personal level I enjoyed premiering *Miles High* which <br>allows me to create a trumpet sound on the bassoon by removing the reed <br>and buzzing my lips on the bocal while breathing in.  Presto changeo, the <br>bassoon is a "trumpetoon" and the jazz played with cellist David Eggar <br>and bassist Guy Tyler made for progressive jazz.  <br><br>Guy premired his own *Three on the Floor* which comes out of his rock <br>band Texas Firewimmen and is in fast quartertones with an improv section <br>based on glissandi.  (All pieces were graciously received by this <br>audience, regardless how new.)<br><br>Mayumi presented 3 works - all using Harmonic-13 just intonation and <br>skirted all stylistic categories, other than thorough-composed.  Through <br>the klezmer-sounding *Knishtet* quartet, the inward *Bassie* trio <br>(remarkably akin to Eric Dolfy's *Eclipse* we realize since purchasing <br>the CD in Denver), and *Peach* with its instrumental viruosity: all was <br>clear and described as "heartfelt" by an NPR reviewer.  <br><br>My solo *Dune* opened our set the way it was meant too.  (A bassoonist in <br>the audience told me afterwards that I did 80 things on the bassoon that <br>she had never imagined possible.  And I intoned Harry Partch's *A Dream* <br>complementing John Schneider's *Barstow*.<br><br>It was a complete joy seeing and hearing John Schneider perform on his <br>multiple fingerboards.  His solo *Barstow* was corporeal in the most <br>exciting way (notable was his turning around to look at the cross of the <br>church intoning "Jesus was God in the flesh."  The Lou Harrison work was <br>scintilating and people hung on every consonance.  John's own <br>composition, which he re-arranged in just intonation "in order to <br>liberate it from 12-ET" was more "sturm und drang" than any of the other <br>works on his 45 minute set, refreshingly so.  Special thanks to John's <br>care about the acoustics of the sound space regarding curtains, <br>placement, grandfather clocks, amplification, etc.  <br><br>But leader of the team was Neil Haverstick who set the stage for a <br>grand event.  His band with John Starrett (perhaps the grandfather of the <br>Denver microtonal movement since he made the first 19-tone guitars and <br>gave one to Neil) is a solid bassist with the mathematical and <br>construction know-how to guide those interested in idiosyncratic <br>microtonal pursuits, and drummer Ernie Crews (who came to my master class <br>at UC at Boulder instructing microtonal bassoon to the bassoonists of the <br>President of the International Double Reed Society class, and who has <br>been a Partch disciple in study), is dynamite!  New works by Neil in <br>34-tone ET and variety to the 19-tone Blues basis of the ensemble, and <br>word has it that Neil is soon to be playing fretless in just intonation <br>tunings... Check out his recording THE GATE, only you won't get to hear <br>his new fast-picking country tune.<br><br>Neil has captured the imagination of the Denver/Boulder region which is <br>growing economically and microtonally.  Somehow it seems amazing that <br>there has been no comparable concert in California.  Talking with Jon <br>Catler, he thought I should spell out on this forum that the AFMM <br>Ensemble can present music in a myriad of styles on the highest level <br>(e.g. Partch and pioneers, imrov, original works, requested works, and <br>rock throught the Microtones Band).<br><br>John Schneider just represented American in Japan playing Partch and with <br>Walter Mondale addressing it in the program!  Couldn't we drum up enough <br>activity in the USA to have concerts of the sort just witnessed in <br>Denver?  A little money and grass roots organization, combined with a <br>clear artistic aim could bring St. Louis, Boston, Chicago, Gainesville, <br>and other cities into a time when microtonal music is the music of the <br>next millennium, but it's going on right now - in real time!<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@ios.com<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 30 Oct 1995 02:35 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA14253; Sun, 29 Oct 1995 08:35:42 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 29 Oct 1995 08:35:42 -0800<br>Message-Id:  <9510291635.aa29720@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
