But I think that<br>it's important for theorists to acknowledge that although a really cool<br>theory is commendable in itself, what ultmately matters is cool music<br>coming from that theory. I think it's also important to encourage theorists<br>to try out their theories for themselves.  Go ahead - have some fun with<br>the sounds your theories have predicted!<br><br>   Let me also encourage pure theorists out there, when presenting a<br>theory, to also speculate to practical performers about possible ways to<br>use that idea in practical music.<br><br><br><br>$AdditionalHeaders:  Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id C12564DB.0052D112; Mon, 21 Jul 1997 17:04:34 +0200</div>
