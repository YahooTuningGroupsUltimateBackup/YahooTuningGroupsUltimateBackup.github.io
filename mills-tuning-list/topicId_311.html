This is not the case; Erv did it all by himself.<br>I think the confusion stems from a joint paper we published in the<br>ICMC proceedings back in 1981 (at NTSU) on our computer projects at <br>UCSD in the late 60's, though the paper makes it clear that they<br>were Erv's alone. <br>	Erv's discovery of the CPS came about as he pondered the best <br>set of pitch bases for a large table of ratios I was compiling. As we <br>were becoming limited by the great length of the table, Erv observed we <br>could obtain extra "complexity" (more composite intervals and longer <br>chains of 5ths, 3rds, etc.) by transposing the whole list to various <br>pitches related by well-chosen ratios. This turned out to be a very <br>efficient procedure as we had to print out the results on wide computer <br>paper anyway and it cost us essentially nothing to add the extra columns <br>when we printed the list off a tape.<br> <br>I didn't mean to imply that the XH12 paper was the only place where<br>Erv Wilson's theories have been published, but it is the most complete <br>and easily accessible source. Other issues of XH have articles by Erv <br>or his student Kraig Grady and Paul mentioned his article on the 14-tone <br>stellated 1.3.5.7 hexany. (BTW, Paul, Erv said he likes your setting of <br>the Hildegarde of Bingen text very much.)
