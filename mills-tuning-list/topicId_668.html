They're very interesting, by the way, and I encourage<br>you folks to explore them a bit if you haven't heard them yet.  But you<br>certainly don't have to go that far either.  Just listen to a bell or a marimba.<br><br><br>   Now Brian may be side-stepping one important point though:  Some of the more<br>wildly nonharmonic timbres can be difficult to nail down to a specific pitch.<br>Chimes and timpani seem at first to have a very clear pitch, but I find that<br>when I try to tune samples of those instruments to each other, I start having<br>problems.  Strangely, the more carefully I listen to them the less sure I am of<br>what exactly their pitch is.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 27 Jul 1996 06:26 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA12476; Fri, 26 Jul 1996 21:26:56 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 26 Jul 1996 21:26:56 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960727042301_71670.2576_HHB66-18@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
