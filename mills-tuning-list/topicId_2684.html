Who was the first to<br>note<br><the applicability of 53 to 5-limit?)<br><72: Richter-Herf (Partch missed this in his list -- it would have<br><disturbed him that an ET could come so close to 11-limit JI!)<br><br>>>Balzano chose 20 as a scale with differen=<br>>>t<br>>>group characteristics from twelve in order to try out some perceptual<br>>>hypotheses, not to offer ''the next step''.<br>><br>>I think quite a few of the people on my list wanted to try out some<br>>perceptual hypotheses, but Balzano was clearly interested in something more:<br>><br>>"With the advent of the computer, the possibilities of exploring microtonal<br>>systems of octave division broaden considerably. In the face of seemingly<br>>boundless freedom of choice, what is needed is a basis for selection that<br>>will tell us which systems offer the gretest resources and will thereby be<br>>the most likely to reward our exploration." (Balzano 1980)<br>><br>>A statement that I wholeheartedly endorse, though my solution is quite<br>>different. But it sounds to me like he was looking for the "next step," at<br>>least as much as I.<br>><br>>>And Erv Wilson told me that<br>>>Partch was unable to distinguish 41 from his system when playing on<br>>>Wilson's 41tet tubulong (this gives an excellent approximation of the<br>>>Partch scale, with the representations of 10/11 - 12/11 and 11/6 - 20/11<br>>>sharing single pitches).<br>><br>>He probably would have been able to tell the difference on an instrument with<br>>harmonic partials such as a chromelodeon, where beating would occur.<br>><br>>>As for 72, I would certainly add Sims, Manieri,<br>>>and Tenney to the list to get out of that strange little _Ekmelische<br>>>Sackgasse_.<br>><br>>I don't get it.<br>><br>>Anyway, Maneri is local, I should get around to meeting him one day.<br>><br>>>As for 53, the father of the triangulated lattice S. Tanaka h=<br>>>as<br>>>to be added!<br>>>=<br>><br>>Havn't seen anything by him, though I use triangular lattices and their<br>>higher-dimensional equivalents all the time. Can you give me more info?<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
