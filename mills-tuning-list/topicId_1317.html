When I spoke to a group of JIN members in San Francisco some<br>years back, it was clear that the attraction of many members to JI was<br>specifically because of an interest in finding the best environment in<br>which to project _tonal_ musics. Likewise, many working with non-JIï¿½s<br>analyse, describe, and use those tunings in largely _tonal_ terms.   <br><br>My own music is often tonally ambiguous - or locally tonal, but more<br>complex globally - and I find for analysis that the structures of JI are<br>the most useful maps of pitch relationships in _tonal_ music, even when the<br>intervals have been mapped onto a temperament (in which case, the JI<br>analysis may help to define the characteristics of the temperament<br>required). In any case, the reification of functional _tonality_ has never<br>been my central concern. I presume that I am in the minority, but would<br>like to be corrected if wrong.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 3 Dec 1996 11:15 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA21181; Tue, 3 Dec 1996 09:20:42 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA30402<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id AAA24715; Tue, 3 Dec 1996 00:20:39 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 3 Dec 1996 00:20:39 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612030813.AAA12132@netcom16.netcom.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
