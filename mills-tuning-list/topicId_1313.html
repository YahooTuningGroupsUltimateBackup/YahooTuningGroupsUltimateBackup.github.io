Anyway, Brian, your<br>insights at times are greatly appreciated, and I have learned a lot from<br>you, and hope to do so in the future...this is no place, however, for<br>personal attacks on others...Hstick<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 3 Dec 1996 08:31 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29729; Tue, 3 Dec 1996 08:32:51 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29657<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id XAA23039; Mon, 2 Dec 1996 23:32:48 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 2 Dec 1996 23:32:48 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v02140b00aec830b2c376@[164.67.21.35]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
