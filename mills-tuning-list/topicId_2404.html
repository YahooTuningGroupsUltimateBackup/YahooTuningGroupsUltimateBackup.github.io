A given key might sound one way on your<br>  > piano, a different way on another.<br><br>  There's a lot of out-of-tune pianos out there, but as long as the keys<br>  have drifted equally (usually in the "flat" direction), it doesn't seem<br>  to affect the emotion of the piece.  (Of course if the keys have drifted<br>  unequally, it's time to get the piano tuned, or to throw it off the roof<br>  of Baker House, in Cambridge, Mass., USA.)<br><br>  My own pet theory is that as you listen to music, your ears accept the<br>  imperfections in tuning that are presented to them, and knows what was<br>  "meant".  So the same idea/emotion/whatever comes across, whether you're<br>  using equal temperament/meantone temperament/just intonation/whatever.<br><br>  > By the way, I have developed a trick that can fool people into<br>  > thinking I have perfect pitch.

So I<br>  too sometimes lean on the crutch of the hums of electrical devices.<br><br>  Most devices emit a "60 cycle" hum (at least that's what it is in the USA<br>  - some other countries use stuff like 50 cycles).  That'll give you a<br>  note somewhere between B natural and B flat, presuming A natural is 440<br>  cycles per second (which, again, may not be true in other countries, nor<br>  for other centuries for that matter).  So you can usually use that as a<br>  reference tone.<br><br>  WARNING!!!:  You may get a note different than "B half flat" from devices<br>  with rotating parts, such as fans and other motors, since gears and<br>  variable-speed controls can alter the frequency.  Things like light bulbs<br>  are more reliable, but you gotta find a loud one, like a flourescent<br>  bulb.<br><br>  Great thread!<br><br>  --Mark<br><br>  P.S.:  Hermann L. F.
