Also, where is Danielou missing the boat as regards his<br>interpretation of Indian music? Again, who really knows? Anybody on this<br>forum? Because I think the points raised lately concerning the<br>connection between tunings, music, and larger "Metaphysical" issues are<br>very important, and should be pursued. In a similar vein, the Martians<br>in Mars Attacks were destroyed by Slim Whitman's music...is this is<br>what's meant by Shiva the Destroyer?
