It's <br>obvious the reviewer knows little about the subject, but did his best. <br>I've always felt if the press doesn't kill you or make you look stupid, <br>you've "escaped." I am grateful to have escaped again...Hstick<br><br>    Also...the forum CD inches towards it's destiny. Starrett just <br>completed his tracks today, and I'm awaiting Alves' dat; I also have a <br>solo to overdub on Ernie Crews' piece, and it's off to the presses...</div><h3><a id=7849 href="#7849">ðŸ”—</a>gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>The impression I get is that tetrachords are _more_ common than the<br>diatonic scale.  I think of it as being related to octave invariance.<br>The octave is the most consonant non-trivial interval, and so scales<br>tend to repeat about it.  The most consonant intervals within an<br>octave are the perfect fourth and fifth, so there is usually some<br>repetition on that level as well.<br><br>That doesn't explain why Lydian and many Indian scales have sharpened<br>fourths up from the tonic, of course ...</div>
