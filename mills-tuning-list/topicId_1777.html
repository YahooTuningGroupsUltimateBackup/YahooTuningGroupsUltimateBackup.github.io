The theorists could easily champion the cause of the mathematical<br>tuning, (ET), but that does not mean that that was the temperament that was<br>in general use.<br><br>When I quoted Johann Joseph Loehr statement of the early 1800's;<br>> "There never was a man capable of tuning  by a ear a pianoforte or <br>> an organ so as not to leave some inequality of temperament, and <br>> there never will be", etc...........<br><br>Jonathan responded;<br>>>There is a logical problem here, which would seem to undermine its <br>>>usefulness for your argument: namely, we can always choose a margin <br>>>of error small enough to wrong-foot the best tuner, and if we set the <br>>>margin at 0, then of course no-one can tune flawless ET.<br><br>   Let's talk about this "margin".  I would challenge anybody to tune an<br>equal temperament, on a fortepiano,  using the known tuning procedures of<br>1800, so even that a sensitive composer could not tell the difference between<br>keys.  <br>    It is quite easy to use octaves and fifths to get all the way around the<br>circle without a "wolf", however, the thirds will give it away as being<br>unequal, and it is the thirds by which we judge the level of musical tension<br>in a given key.<br><br>Walker goes on to say;<br>> What you would <br>>have to find is not evidence to show that ET was not achieved to <br>>perfection, but rather that musicians/tuners were not _aiming_ for the <br>>equality of all keys, but continued, rather, to favour some over <br>>others. In other words, you will need to find contemporary evidence <br>>not for inequality of results, but inequality of _intention_.<br><br>   This one is easy.  When I was first instructed in the process of tuning, (<br>1972), my tutor pointed out to me that the fifths leading up to the C-E third<br>could be made a little "noisy" so that the key of C would be the "nicest".<br> This was in north Louisiana!!!!!  If the tradition of "key favoritism"  was<br>still extant 25 years ago,  I really believe that in 1800, the practise was<br>probably more widespread .  <br><br>In response to my statement;<br>> I don't think ET was possible, given the state of <br>> science in the 1700's.   <br><br>Walker replies;<br>>>You could make much the same argument for meantone temperaments being<br>>>impossible in the 15th century, but we have corroborating evidence to<br>>>show that they did indeed employ such tunings then; <br><br>      Comparing the ease of production between meantone and 12TET seems like<br>a stretch.  Equal temperament is much more difficult. Meantone (1/4 comma<br>Aaron) is so easy in comparison, that it's use doesn't mean that everything<br>else followed as well, i.e.  tempering four fifths at better than 5 cents<br>each is a lot easier than tuning 12 fifths at 1.95 each.  The scale of<br>difficulty doesn't translate. <br><br>Walker again;<br><snip>   <br>>pronouncements Beethoven made, well into his career, upon key <br>>characteristics, might seem to indicate his continuing preference for <br>>and use of well-temperament (for as long as he could hear any <br>>difference). My point was that he also claimed to be able to <br>>distinguish between Db and C# (and other such "enharmonic <br>>equivalents") and this renders his other statements on key <br>>characteristics useless as a supposed Beethovenian endorsement of <br>>well-temperament.<br><br>  Why does this render his other statements useless?  Do we know what he was<br>talking about inre Db vs.C#?  I don't, and though it seems that from our<br>point of modern view, there is no difference, was he talking about meantone?<br>or was he talking about orchestral intonation, or singers?.  But his<br>pronouncements upon key characteristics are easily understood when listening<br>to his sonati in Well temperament. <br><br>    What it comes down to when deciding performance practises is listening to<br>the music, and making decisions.  It is easy to say that composers didn't<br>write anything down about their preferences, but is that true?  Did they not<br>write down the notes?  Is music a language or not?  If it is, then can it not<br>tell us something about the composers intention?  <br>     Extrapolation of temperament practise from composition is pretty thin<br>stuff, I know,  but coupled with what documentation we have of the state of<br>science, (ET is a scientific tuning), and demonstrated differences in the<br>sound of say, the "Pathetique" performed on Well temperament and Equal<br>Temperament,  I am convinced that it was not composed with ET in mind.  I<br>just cannot imagine Beethoven would have been oblivious to, or uncaring about<br>the lack of tonal contrasts that follow from the use of Equal Temperament.  <br><br>Walker again;<br>>If pianists need their confidence <br>>bolstered by foundationless arguments, concerning the tunings <br>>Beethoven would have heard, <snip><br><br>      Foundationless arguments?  The way I read and hear it,  there is more<br>foundation for the use of unequal tuning than there is for ET. <br><br>Regards, <br>Ed Foote <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 4 Mar 1997 03:52 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03598; Tue, 4 Mar 1997 03:52:14 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03664<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id SAA15582; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 18:50:13 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 3 Mar 1997 18:50:13 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01540b02af413d111631@[206.119.10.100]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4977 href="#4977">ðŸ”—</a>Rabia Kathleen Seidel &#x3C;seidel@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/1997 5:53:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>J.
