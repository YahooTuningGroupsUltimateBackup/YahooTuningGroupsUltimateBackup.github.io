This in turn means that the consonant chords of the 3-limit<br>and those of the 5-limit are congruent, that is to say, they can exist<br>together without producing dissonant intervals.<br><br>But when we reach the septimals, we find that the perfect fifth 3:2 is<br>comprised of 7:6 and the undoubtedly dissonant 9:7. The other possible<br>septimal bisection of the fifth, 8:7 and 21:16, also includes an<br>undoubted dissonance (21:16) although the closeness of 8:7 makes it too,<br>undoubtedly dissonant.<br><br>Now a chord with one dissonant interval, is dissonant. Someone may try<br>to deny this, but I am afraid he will fail.<br><br>There do exist a few septimal triads that seem to escape this argument,<br>e.g. 5:6:7, 4:5:7, 4:6:7. But a few triads do not begin to compare with<br>the richness and variety of the harmonies of the senario.<br><br>If follows that the septimals, even if one admits them to be weakly<br>consonant - which I do _not_ - certainly give rise, for the most part,<br>to undoubtedly dissonant chords. They have only the most tenuous<br>relation with the harmony of the senario, which on the contrary, forms a<br>closed, well-ordered system.<br><br>All this was observed centuries ago. Mersenne is full of highly<br>ingenious arguments regarding the septimals - nihil sub sole novum. The<br>Renaissance and Baroque were much occupied with debating whether the<br>septimals might ever be used as consonances, and were much more<br>acquainted with the septimals than the average modern. They concluded, I<br>would say quite reasonably, that the septimals make charming, effective<br>dissonances of a peculiar and valuable kind - but very poor consonances.<br><br>In former centuries musical theory was an honored and well-rewarded<br>study, and so we should not be surprised if most of what we now think<br>terribly modern questions, are actually very ancient questions. Nor does<br>the accident of being dead make a man necessarily wrong.<br><br>There is a disposition to assume that because one calls an interval<br>dissonant, one hates it, and wishes to banish it from music. One can<br>trace this assumption to the early Renaissance, during which a certain<br>school of composition did actually try to rid music of all dissonant<br>chords, which were felt to make impossible any attempt to join different<br>melodies harmonically. So today, some people still take it as a personal<br>insult if an interval they fancy is called dissonant, and - very<br>absurdly - try to make consonance and dissonance purely relative ideas<br>with no basis in physics. It is as if everyone were convinced red were<br>the only beautiful color, and were mortally offended if anyone dared to<br>call a green shirt anything but red. But the shirt would still be<br>_green_.<br><br>But I - just as about 99% of all the Western musical theorists who have<br>ever lived - do really hate and wish to banish a certain narrow class of<br>dissonances - those which are so close to consonances that they beat<br>badly, but yet are melodically confounded with the consonances. These<br>are called mistuned consonances, and anyone who really loves these<br>intervals does really deserve to be insulted, for if these intervals are<br>accepted they will drain instrumental music of most of its expressive<br>power.<br><br>We find a perfect analogy in modern poetry, where not merely rhyme, but<br>even metre - nay, even clear sense and ordinary grammar - is felt by a<br>certain kind of poet to be too constricting on his power to express his<br>emotions and ideas. And what has been the result? In the mouths of such<br>personnages, language itself becomes more irrelevant to culture than the<br>worst babblings of the Christian or Muslim Fundamentalists. Poetry is<br>now perfectly irrelevant to modern literature, which is dominated by the<br>most miserable, low, fourth-grader prose. But that prose can at least be<br>understood, and is _genuine_ language, and so the people take it to<br>their hearts. Were a true poet to appear today, using metre and even<br>rhyme in the service of easily noble or pathetic thoughts and emotions,<br>he would seem a veritable monster, and would probably be regarded as a<br>madman.<br><br>But to return to music ? singers will never be corrupted by the lunacy<br>of deliberately using badly mistuned consonances, for they will never be<br>able to sing them, unless perhaps one could induce some hopelessly<br>tone-deaf people to become singers. In an age where a composer -<br>personally he was a charming fellow, I believe - can write a piece<br>consisting entirely of _silence_, why not a new music exclusively for<br>the tone-deaf?<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Melodic Limen or Threshold<br>PostedDate:  17-12-97 05:20:45<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  17-12-97 05:18:44-17-12-97 05:18:44,17-12-97 05:18:23-17-12-97 05:18:24<br>DeliveredDate:  17-12-97 05:18:24<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256570.0017AD32; Wed, 17 Dec 1997 05:20:33 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17592; Wed, 17 Dec 1997 05:20:45 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 17 Dec 1997 05:20:45 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA17587<br>Received: (qmail 28840 invoked from network); 16 Dec 1997 20:20:41 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 16 Dec 1997 20:20:41 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3497B536.585A@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
