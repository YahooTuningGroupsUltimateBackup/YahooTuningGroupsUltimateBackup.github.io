        <a href="/mills-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Octaves and farewell</h1><h3><a id=5813 href="#5813">ðŸ”—</a>rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz (Ray Tomes)</h3><span>7/11/1997 4:18:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On the question of casting out 2s from ratios, I think that the<br>strongest evidence that I can give that this is a significant thing is<br>to compare the two chords 8:15 and 15:16.  The former is more pleasant<br>to hear than the latter.<br><br>Also, with a series like 1:2:4:8 the addition of notes at ratios of 5/4<br>(or 9/8 or similar) to the tonic is much more pleasant at the high end<br>than the low (i.e adding 5 or 10 above rather than 5/4 or 5/2).<br>Generally this is practiced in music, with much tighter chords in the<br>treble than in the base.<br><br>Therefore the octave in which a note appears is always important.<br><br>Shortly I will be unsubscribing from the list for a while at least.<br>I would like to thank everyone for lots of stimulating ideas and<br>conversation.  This is without a doubt the most noise free part of<br>internet that I have ever found and you are to be congratulated.<br><br>My reason for departing is that tuning as such is more of a sideline<br>interest of mine and I have just started a cycles list myself which will<br>keep me busy for a while.  That list can be joined by sending a message<br>to cycles-request@esosoft.com with subscribe in the body of the message.<br><br>I would welome email from anyone here on the wider aspects of tuning as<br>found in nature and the universe at large.
