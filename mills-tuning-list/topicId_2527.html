I really do enjoy the surprises that occur while listening to<br>non 12 et music...I truly feel that this is a necessary direction for<br>western music to go to avoid becoming stale and stinky...which it is. I<br>would have liked to hear something from Johhny and Mayumi Reinhard, the<br>Catler Bros, John Schneider, and a few more, as well as more acoustic<br>instruments...but, this was a wonderful idea. Perhaps a tuning@eartha CD?<br>T shirts, posters, etc? Why not...I believe the talent base is<br>here...Hstick<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET><br>Subject:  Re: stray thoughts<br>PostedDate:  16-10-97 06:00:26<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  16-10-97 05:59:41-16-10-97 08:25:33,16-10-97 07:26:18-16-10-97 07:26:21<br>DeliveredDate:  16-10-97 07:26:21<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256532.0015F0A4; Thu, 16 Oct 1997 05:59:38 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18374; Thu, 16 Oct 1997 06:00:26 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 16 Oct 1997 06:00:26 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18387<br>Received: (qmail 9355 invoked from network); 15 Oct 1997 21:00:22 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 15 Oct 1997 21:00:22 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.95.971015233312.3308C-100000@u2.farm.idt.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6294 href="#6294">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Collins, Gordon&#x22; &#x3C;CollinG@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/1997 12:36:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Johnny Reinhard mused:<br><br>>If I played Mary Had A Little Lamb a quartertone sharp from convention's<br>>A=440, then each and every tone I advanced would be a microtone.  By<br>>virtue of the tortured fingerings in sometimes embarrassing postures,<br>>these lambs were microtones.  Why is it no one listening to my<br>>Mary... rendition on the bassoon would notice and remain<br>>convinced that there were absolutely no "microtones" at play (the<br>>rare perfect pitchers aside).<br><br>(You mean that they *would* remain so convinced, right?)<br><br>Because there aren't any microtones at play.  A=440 is far from a<br>universal convention.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the<br>international pitch standard is still 435, and most major orchestras play<br>higher, upwards of 448.  (The string players think they sound better<br>there - it drives the wind players nuts.)  Early music players tune to<br>A=415 ... or 392 ... or 460 ...  because 250 years ago reference pitches<br>varied considerably, with choirs and chamber ensembles often having<br>different (by a third or more) reference pitches at the same time and<br>place!  Even if you didn't travel, you had to be good at transposition,<br>and there are Bach cantatas where the recorder parts are written in a<br>different key so the instruments would end up playing at the same pitch.<br> Perfect pitch may be more curse than gift!<br><br>Is this not why folks on this list use ratios and cents to describe<br>intervals from an arbitrary reference, notated 1/1?<br><br>So no matter what your reference pitch, if all the intervals in your<br>performance are powers of the twelfth root of 2, you're playing in 12TET.<br> Thus a "microtone", whatever it is, is an interval, not a pitch.<br><br><br>>A tone can be an interval of major and minor size, of numerous<br>variations,<br>>actually.  It is also the blend of harmonicities and inharmonicities<br>>of a plethora of amplitudes which all make up the klangfarben of vivid<br>>color in musical tone.<br><br>Well, this is throwing in a completely different definition of the word<br>"tone", meaning "timbre"....<br><br><br>>Could a microtone be an interval that bridges to another microtone, or<br>>not?  Must its pedigree be the remainder of real time arithmetical<br>>calculations ....<br><br>I suspect that the problem with the word "microtone" is that it has been<br>applied to tunings far removed from the context of its invention.  Didn't<br>the word come out of early 20th-century experiments with 24TET, 96TET,<br>and other tunings that were derived by subdividing 12TET?  Its meaning<br>seems clear in that context.<br><br>Now it gets applied to things like 7TET, the intervals of which are<br>barely smaller than a tone, far from "micro".  It seems to be no more<br>specific than a cue word to indicate a non-12TET interval.  In that<br>sense, sure, an interval between two microtones is another microtone,<br>however wide, as long as it is not 2^(n/12).  But this strips the word of<br>almost all meaning.<br><br><br>>"Microtonal" is the personal sensibility one achieves when making the<br>>acquaintence of a progressive number of powerful sound<br>>angles...skipping stones on the sound continuum one moment,<br>>placing stones to cross a river in the next, knocking on<br>>familiar doors all along the way.<br><br>Hmm - "microtonal" essentially meaning "unfamiliar" - a good place for<br>the word "xenharmonic".  Would someone brought up listening to Indian<br>music get the same sensation on hearing 12TET?<br><br>How far away must one get from the familiar doors to produce the<br>microtonal sensation?  If you played "Mary Had a Little Lamb" in<br>Pythagorian tuning, who would consider that microtonal?<br><br>The predominance of the equal-tempered piano and fretted guitar has<br>evidently led many to overlook that, to this day, good musicians who can<br>produce arbitrary pitches do not consider C# and Db to be the same pitch.<br> (They may say otherwise, but one must judge from their performance!)  Is<br>the music they produce microtonal?<br><br>The exclusion of music thought to be 12TET by the speaker or writer but<br>never actually *performed* in 12TET strips "microtone" and "microtonal"<br>of the rest of their meaning.<br><br><br>I think it would be best to restrict the word "microtone" to "an interval<br>significantly smaller than a 12TET semitone", and "microtonal" to "making<br>explicit use of microtones".  Then we need other words to describe the<br>scope of the AFMM.  Since I'm not sure what exactly is excluded, I'm not<br>sure what to suggest.
