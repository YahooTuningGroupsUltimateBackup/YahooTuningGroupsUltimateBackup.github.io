I'm working with a friend on a software for guitar and I need a<br>>list of the intervals in 12-ET from the more consonant to more><br>>dissonant. With "consonant" I mean beatless, empty. So I've tried to do<br>>my own list based only upon my ear:<br><br>>octave<br>>P5<br>>P4<br>>6M<br>>3M<br>>3m<br>>6m<br>>7m<br>>4+<br>>2M<br>>7M<br>>2m<br><br>>This list is istinctive but I'd like to have a more scientific<br>>justification if possible. Anyone can help me? Maybe with a mathematic<br>>law on beating and interval spacing (spacing: 10M is more consonant<br>>than  3M). Ciao.<br><br>>-Lorenzo<br><br>Hindemith tried to do the same thing, mathematically rather than <br>instinctively,<br>and his list was identical to yours through the first seven entries. After <br>that, he went astray due to his refusal to accept 7-limit interpretations. <br>So he but the tritone last, although it is a 7:5 out of tune by 17 cents, <br>which by naive mathematics should be similar in consonance to the minor <br>sixth, an 8:5 out of tune by 14 cents.<br><br>The most common definition of consonance is derived from a psychoacoustical <br>phenomenon known as roughness. The exact rankings will depend on the <br>overtone structure of the tones in question; two Japanese (?) workers whose <br>last names both start with a "K" (anyone?) wrote a paper in JASA giving an <br>example of how to calculate this. They produced a continuous graph showing <br>roughness from the unison up to one or two octaves; needless to say, there <br>were dips in the graph at the first six intervals in your list. The roughest <br>intervals were out-of-tune octaves, fifths, and especially unisons.<br><br>Another component of consonance is tonalness, or how well the tones "fuse" <br>into a single complex-tone perception. I recently posted an algorithm for <br>determining the certainty of perceiving any tempered interval as any <br>interval from the harmonic series. This algorithm only assumes that there <br>will be some audible harmonic overtones within an optimal (rather high) <br>frequency range). There is only one free parameter in the algorithm, the <br>finest pitch resolution of the ear in a harmonic context. Unfortunately, <br>this algorithm doesn't translate well into an absolute ranking of intervals. <br>We can, however, look at the worst-case (out of all inversions and <br>extensions) certainty for the most likely interpretations of the <br>pitch-classes 0-6:<br><br>resolution = 1%:<br>semitones	interpretation	certainty<br>0	   	    1/1	 	    40.1<br>1	   	    18/17	    	    2.35<br>2	   	    9/8	 	    4.34<br>3	   	    6/5	 	    5.31<br>4	   	    5/4	 	    5.85<br>5	   	    4/3	 	    13.3<br>6	   	    7/5 or 10/7	   3.42<br><br>This basically agrees with the ranking in your list.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 31 Oct 1996 21:20 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA15553; Thu, 31 Oct 1996 21:21:11 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA28070<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA22233; Thu, 31 Oct 1996 12:21:09 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 31 Oct 1996 12:21:09 -0800<br>Message-Id: <32790998.4C36@cavehill.dnet.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
