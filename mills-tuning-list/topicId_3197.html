Jon Catler plays just-intonation electric<br>guitar in many styles including rock.<br><br>As for myself, I write rock tunes in just-intonation using my computer.<br><br>However, I can provide an illustration of an incredibly talented<br>performer being able to coax any frequency he wanted from an ordinary<br>instrument. Listen very carefully to Jimi Hendrix, particularly his<br>"bent" notes -- i.e., those where he pushed the guitar string to the side<br>after picking it, to raise the pitch slightly.  Every bend he played was<br>precisely tuned to the exact pitch he wanted.  Sometimes, he provided a<br>dazzling display of his ability by playing several "bent" notes in a row,<br>each one just slightly lower or higher than the last, and sometimes he<br>even interspersed 2-note runs between these each-slightly-different focal<br>notes, in a dactylic rhythm (long-short-short).<br><br>I also give Hendrix the credit for bringing the 19-identity (the "sharp<br>9th" of the chord, i.e., the "minor 3rd" played an octave above the<br>"major 3rd" in a "dominant 7th chord") definitely and securely into the<br>harmonic language of rock -- an excellent example is the main riff at the<br>beginning of  "Foxey Lady" on "Are You Experienced" (vintage 1967).<br> <br>   Joseph L.
