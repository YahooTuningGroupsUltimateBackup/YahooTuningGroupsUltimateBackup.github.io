Is this chord a modern invention?  It seems<br>>}to me that such a thing is impossible in anything but equal temperament.<br>><br>>Please note that Just Intonation is really a "modern invention" as well. The<br>>only tunings that had real significance in the West since the earliest<br>>notated music have been Pythagorean, Meantone, and varieties of<br>>Well-Temperament including Equal Temperament.<br>><br>>}I'm having a hard time getting acceptable diminished chords out of my E9<br>>}pedal steel using the standard JI tuned pedals.  I know I could tune a pedal<br>>}specifically for these chords, but that's really an awkward solution.<br>>}Comments?<br>><br>>Well, in meantone tuning, the diminished seventh chord sounds pretty good,<br>>since the intervals are very close to 6/5, 6/5, 6/5, 7/6. But equal<br>>temperament may maximize the consonance of the chords, since all intervals<br>>are then kinda close to 6/5, which is more consonant that 7/6, even when the<br>>former is a little out-of-tune and the latter is tuned justly.</div>
