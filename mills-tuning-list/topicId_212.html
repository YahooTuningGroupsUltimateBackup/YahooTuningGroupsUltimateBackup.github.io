I'm making another<br>movable-fret guitar and couldn't stand the thought of tapping away at my<br>hand calculator again.  Here's now to install this in your stack:<br><br>1) Start up JICalc.  This has to run under the regular Hypercard 2.0 or<br>greater, not Hypercard Player.<br><br>2) After selecting a card from the index and click to it, make a new card.<br><br>3) Go into field-edit mode under "tools" and make a new field.  Place it<br>somewhere convenient and name it "String Length".<br><br>4) Go into button-edit mode under "tools" and select one of the buttons to<br>calculate the ET +- cent, 1024 or 768, whichever you don't use very much.<br>Rename it "Fret Pos" or something and replace its script with the following:<br><br>on mouseUp<br>  set cursor to 4<br>  get card field "String Length"<br>  put it into strlength<br>  repeat with i=1 to 60<br>    --make sure the field has something in it; skip it otherwise<br>    if line 2 of field i >0 then<br>      --get the ratio<br>      put ((line 1 of field i)-(line 2 of field i))/(line 1 of field i)<br>into ratio<br>      --multply string length by this ratio and display<br>      put strlength * ratio into line 3 of field i<br>      --display and ratio as a check<br>      put ratio into line 4 of field i<br>    end if<br>  end repeat<br>end mouseUp<br><br>5) Enter some ratios and enter the total string length into the new field.<br>Click on the Fret Pos button and the string lengths will be displayed.<br>These are in centimeters for ease in multiplication.  Measure these from the<br>nut.  For the octave above past the octave fret, recalculate with half the<br>string length and place starting at the octave fret.  <br><br>I use 16- or 18-guage steel wire bent around a fretboard which has had its<br>old frets removed.  This is very similar to a sitar's movable frets.  The<br>fret is held at the back of the neck with either tied fishing wire (this is<br>even what sitar builders use) or rubber bands (which break quickly but are<br>good for just a quick check).  Different fret positions for different<br>strings are something this system doesn't allow.  It's derived from articles<br>by David Canright in 1/1. Thanks to him for the information and thanks to<br>Carter Sholz for sending me the original scripts for the JICalc buttons so I<br>could modify them.   <br><br>Steve Curtin<br>Ensoniq Corp<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 5 Dec 1995 01:20 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id PAA22824; Mon, 4 Dec 1995 15:20:18 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 4 Dec 1995 15:20:18 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199512042313.SAA00492@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2364 href="#2364">ðŸ”—</a>vincent.kenis@infoboard.be (Vincent Kenis)</h3><span>12/6/1995 11:09:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Date: Tue, 5 Dec 1995 22:12:03 -0500<br>>From: Mmcky@aol.com<br>>To: tuning<br>>Subject: WAV to MIDI<br>>Message-ID: <951205221105_126183774@mail04.mail.aol.com><br>><br>>I received a phone call from Basim Daoud, who is into microtuning with a<br>>Middle Eastern spin.  He has a 12 string acoustic instrument that he plays<br>>monophonically.  He would like to record his music in a .WAV file and have it<br>>translated to MIDI.<br>><br>>Does anyone know of a software package that will do this?<br><br>Logic Audio (Mac) has a Audio to score feature that works very well. You<br>have access to detection parameters such as granulation, attack range,<br>smooth release, velocity threshold, time correction. After the translation<br>a window automatically opens with 3 different scores : notes, notes with<br>undetermined pitch, noises (percussion, fret buzz etc). It even translates<br>volume in velocity values, but doesn't take vibrato & slide, hence<br>microtonal intervals, into account.<br>Some standalone pitch to MIDI converters use pitch bend for that. But MIDI<br>doesn't give a standard ratio between PB values and cents. On some synths<br>the curve even varies from note to note.<br><br>Good luck<br><br>PS I like very much Middle Eastern music. Is the music youre trying to<br>translate in MIDI "microtonal" because of the Arabian scale quartertones,<br>or is the tuning orignal ? I'd like to hear it.<br><br>PPS is there such a thing as a "microtonality for the rest of us", or<br>whatever, CD compilation ? where can I find it ?<br><br>Vincent Kenis<br><br>     @< @<br>        -<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 6 Dec 1995 21:46 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA05467; Wed, 6 Dec 1995 11:46:40 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 6 Dec 1995 11:46:40 -0800<br>Message-Id: <9512061152206186@csst.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
