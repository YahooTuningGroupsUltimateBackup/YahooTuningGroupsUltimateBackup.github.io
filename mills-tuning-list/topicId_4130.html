It's easy to show that<br>the location of an interval on this spiral does not always determine<br>its perceived degree of concord or discord, and somewhat more delicate<br>a matter to delve into the intricacies of an issue such as 81:64<br>vis-a-vis 5:4.<br><br>For example, one interesting facet of Western European harmonic<br>evolution not so often considered is that 81:64 (the Pythagorean<br>ditone equal to four fifths minus two octaves, about 408 cents) is<br>ranked as relatively concordant by most 13th-14th century theorists,<br>but as "dissonant" by some 16th-17th century theorists. I suggest a<br>possible explanation below which seems intuitively appealing at first<br>blush.<br><br>While judgments of this kind may differ from listener to listener, and<br>certainly from era to era or culture to culture, it's easy to show (as<br>has already been done) that degrees of consonance do not necessarily<br>follow the sequence of the spiral of fifths or fourths. For example,<br>let's consider the ranking schemes common among 13th-century European<br>theorists:<br><br>             Stable       Relatively      Relatively       Strong<br>             concord      concordant        tense          discord<br><br>1 fifth 3:2    x<br><br>2  M2   9:8                                   x<br><br>3. M6  27:16                                  x<br><br>4. M3  81:64                  x<br><br>5. M7 128:81                                                   x<br><br>6. A4 729:512                                                  x<br><br>It's generally agreed among 13th-century theorists that M2 and M6,<br>which come before M3 on the spiral of fifths, are nevertheless _less_<br>rather than more concordant, although they have some "compatibility"<br>also, and might be placed in a middle region of "unstable but<br>compatible."<br><br>While moving further along this spiral of harmonic intervals requires<br>entering the realm of accidental alterations and augmented and<br>diminished spellings, the results might be even more striking.<br><br>Within European and related traditions of composition, most people now<br>as in the 13th century would agree that a major seventh (fifth #5) is<br>a strong discord in itself. Yet fifth #10 gives us a Pythagorean<br>augmented second (19683:16384, about 318 cents), a more complex ratio<br>and also a much more concordant interval to most modern listeners,<br>being only about 2 cents from an m3 at a pure 6:5.<br><br>Similarly, a Pythagorean comma (fifth #12) at 531441:524288 (about<br>23.46 cents) would be strongly dissonant to just about any listener in<br>this tradition. Yet a doubly diminished fourth (fifth #16, e.g. d#-gb)<br>of about 271 cents is only about 3.8 cents from a pure 7:6, which I<br>suspect many people on this list would regard as more concordant than<br>a comma (fifth #12) or even a major seventh (fifth #5).[1]<br><br>As for 81:64 and 5:4, I'd say that it's a choice a bit like carob<br>vis-a-vis a very sweet chocolate. Both of them are relatively "sweet"<br>or "concordant," but the flavor you aren't expecting can seem<br>remarkably "bitter" (or "out of tune").<br><br>In a Gothic setting, 81:64 is treated as relatively concordant in<br>practice and theory, although in practice, of course, intonation would<br>vary except on fixed-pitch instruments. It's like carob, with somewhat<br>more tense intervals like M2 and m7 serving as "spice," and the fifth<br>and fourth providing rich and stable concord. This raises some curious<br>questions: might be there be any correlation between liking carob (one<br>of my favorites) and liking medieval polyphony, or do these thirds<br>have a higher concentration of complex carbohydrates <grin>?<br><br>In a Renaissance setting, however, 5:4 is the new staple: sometimes I<br>get the "meantone munchies," and can't resist the chocolate-like<br>flavor of those pure thirds.<br><br>To Renaissance musicians for whom 5:4 was the essence of sweetness,<br>it's easy to imagine how the carob flavor of an 81:64 may have seemed<br>positively bitter (or "dissonant").<br><br>Another way of looking at it is that an M3 at 81:64 or an m7 at 9:5<br>represents a sonority in motion, while a 5:4 or a 7:4 is more likely<br>to serve as a point of rest. To my ears, either form of M3 seems<br>relatively blending while either form of m7 seems relatively tense,<br>but the microtonal shading can make a difference (along with the<br>style, of course).<br><br>It seems to me that at least one tenable modern approach is to enjoy<br>each of these intervals in their stylistic settings, and maybe invent<br>some new ones (intervals and styles alike).<br><br>Most respectfully,<br><br>Margo Schulter<br>mschulter@value.net</div>
