Do you know the exact title of the book and the full name<br>of the author, plus eventually the publisher and the year it was published."<br><br>If anybody here knows this book, I would appreciate hearing from you. <br><br>And where is B. Mclaren??   He was writing some of the most interesting stuff<br>here on this list.  Does he know that?? <br><br>Regards, <br>Ed Foote<br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 4 May 1997 04:12 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03827; Sun, 4 May 1997 04:12:20 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03889<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id TAA23466; Sat, 3 May 1997 19:09:18 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 3 May 1997 19:09:18 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.970503215920.5450B-100000@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5391 href="#5391">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>5/3/1997 9:51:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>The question about why bother with equal temperaments is welcome. I'd add<br>>that their structures, and widely differing ones at that, make a<br>>fascinating musical--and yes, expressive--difference.<br><br>   I agree with Paul here.<br><br>   Why look at them?  Because they're interesting.  Historically 12TET came<br>about as a necessary compromise.  But when you throw open the field to<br>other numbers of tones per octave, they start becoming interesting for<br>other reasons.<br><br><br><br><br>>Related to this, you<br>>have true enharmonic equivalent pitches and intervals in equal<br>>temperaments, which you may get in just systems only by fudging things<br>>theoretically.<br><br>   That's also a good point.  That, for example, opens you to possibilities<br>analogous with tritone substitutions.<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 4 May 1997 09:37 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03998; Sun, 4 May 1997 09:37:49 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03936<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id AAA05473; Sun, 4 May 1997 00:36:13 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 4 May 1997 00:36:13 -0700<br>Message-Id: <970504033426_-1567705828@emout05.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
