Curtis will open the concert with a set of rarely heard <br>single line ballades and virelais by the 14th century master<br>Guillaume de Machaut.<br><br>On Sunday June 29, from 2pm to mid-night, the Dream House <br>will be transformed by the frequencies of Mobile, Chord 8, a <br>continuous sound installation by Michael J. Schumacher. <br>Come and go through out the afternoon and evening, or <br>stay the entire ten hours to hear a chord consisting of <br>six intervals in just intonation unfolding in algorithmically<br>shifting variations, gradually illuminating the many harmonic <br>combinations.<br><br>Of course Dream House: Seven Years of Sound and Light <br>1993-2000 remains open Thursdays & Saturdays 2pm to midnight.<br>Note: closed July & August - reopens in Sept.<br><br>Mela Foundation<br>275 Church Street<br>NY, NY 10013<br>212-925-8270<br><br><br>Brought to you by...<br><br>D a v i d   B e a r d s l e y .. dmb5561719@aol.com <br>      *            ..    *    ... .*             ....     *......   .<br>            ..*    I M M P  &  B i i n k!   m  u  s  i  c<br>. ..    *             ..                 ..           * ..             <br>J u x t a p o s i t i o n Ezine    *          . ..        *<br> . .*.. .           .. .     .    .*.   . . .     . ..       ..<br>      http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm<br>  . ..         .*..            . .. .           ..*.     .    ..   . *. <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 23 Jun 1997 10:29 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01574; Mon, 23 Jun 1997 10:29:52 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 23 Jun 1997 10:29:52 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01572<br>Received: (qmail 12867 invoked from network); 20 Jun 1997 21:43:05 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 20 Jun 1997 21:43:05 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95q.970620163053.16366B-100000@library.wustl.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5675 href="#5675">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/1997 2:08:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>In the past year I have measured twelve Javanese Gamelan in Germany. While<br>this is not a large sample, I have not detected a preference for stretched<br>over diminished octaves in the tuning of the gamelan as a whole. Exceptionally, slendro instruments with both a low and a high pitch one<br>will almost always have stretched octaves, while those with two pitch sixes<br>almost always diminish the octave. Marc Perlman reports from his tuner that the octaves can be stretched to<br>cover singers who tend to go sharp in the upper octaves - a rationale<br>entirely different from the acoustical explainations most often given.<br>Using the  spectrum analysis feature of Pitch Perfect (which is admitedlybuggy), I have been unable to obtain very consistant patterns in the<br>frequency ratios of the partial tones. Yes, they are stretched from an<br>integer series but in a rather haphazard way depending largely on the shape<br>of the key, and so I would be very hesitant to endorse any explaination of<br>the tuning based upon the timbre of the instruments other than one in which<br>the general inharmonicity allows a greater degree of latitude. A difference<br>tone theory like that of Wilson remains, to my ears at least, plausible.
