On Hindemith. Having never studied with him, I can only report his book<br>>Unterweisung im Tonsatz, translated as The Craft of Musical Composition.<br>>This is the book in which he builds up a new harmonic theory based on the<br>>harmonic series and then treats everything as 12-tET. Hindemith discussed<br>>the 7th harmonic at some length but did not, as far as I can tell,<br>>understand it. His book is to me a historical curiosity: it almost did<br>>something right, perceived something of an abyss at really paying<br>>attention to the harmonic series, and then retreated into the familiar.<br>><br>>I'd be interested in others' opinions.<br><br>I think this evaluation is on the mark. Historically, the tidy-minded<br>Hindemith was looking for some objective way to counter opposing techniques<br>like the 12-tone method. He saw, quite rightly I think, that tonality is<br>inherent in the harmonic series, but then destroyed his own argument by<br>off-handedly saying that of course temperament was inevitable. He also<br>tried to use "undertones," if I recall correctly, without much<br>justification, to fill out the 12 tone system.<br><br>I thought I would report on what I perceive as a kind of contemporary echo<br>of this point of view. While at the 4th Symposium and Festival on<br>Intercultural Music in London last April, I had the pleasure of meeting Roy<br>Travis, professor emeritus of UCLA. While he was a warm and gracious man, I<br>can't say that I agree with the principles of paper he gave.<br><br>A student of Schenker student Felix Salzer and a defender of the<br>Schenkerian faith, Travis endeavored through his career to apply find ways<br>of applying such analysis to twentieth-century works of extended tonality,<br>such as those of Bartok. His claimed insight was to allow the construction<br>of "tonic chords" based on higher-order harmonics.<br><br>In an analysis of the Bartok 4th string quartet, for example, he showed how<br>a particular sonority consisting of the 1st, 5th, and 11th harmonics (C, E,<br>and F# in his analysis) could function as a "tonic chord" the same way a<br>major or minor triad had in the common-practice period. Like Hindemith, he<br>then casually remarked that the compromises of temperament were, of course,<br>necessary.<br><br>Now, I have no problem with Bartok's well-established use of non-triadic<br>sonorities, but I proposed to him in the question-answer session that<br>compromises of temperament (especially with regards to the 11th harmonic)<br>invalidated the justification of the harmonic series. His reply was, as<br>best as I can paraphrase, "I can only tell you that if the major triad,<br>which is also compromised by temperament, is justified through its<br>proximity to the tones in the harmonic series, why not the 7th, 9th, and<br>11th harmonics?"<br><br>I told him that,to me, the 11/1 ratio was a beautiful and consonant<br>interval, but that the equally-tempered tritone was quite a different<br>sound. He said that he thought that the tritone, in a given context, could<br>be heard as consonant, and suggested that perhaps people just hear<br>differently.<br><br>I hope I haven't misrepresented his point of view, but I thought it would<br>be of interest to the subscribers here.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
