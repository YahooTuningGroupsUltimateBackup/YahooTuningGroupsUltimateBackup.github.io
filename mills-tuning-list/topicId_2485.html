I have also appended<br>the unsubscription info at the end.<br><br>The Tuning List has been averaging about 360 subscribers in recent months,<br>with domain distribution as follows (as of last Friday):<br><br>12 Canada, 1 South Africa, 1 Belgium, 10 Germany, 1 Sweden, 9<br>Non-Profit Organizations, 2 Singapore, 2 Switzerland, 1 Finland, 2 Hong<br>Kong, 18 United Kingdom, 1 US Military, 10 Netherlands, 1 Poland, 101<br>"Commercial", 1 India, 2 Norway, 4 Japan, 2 Brazil, 4 France, 1 Greece,<br>1 Korea, 3 Spain, 2 United States, 3 Austria, 41 "Net", 1 Guatemala, 3<br>Italy, 21 Australia, 97 US Education, 1 Yugoslavia, 2 US Government, 1<br>Uruguay.<br><br>The portion of US Education continues to become less predominant.  I think<br>this is a good sign.<br><br>As of today 7006 messages have been sent.  The archives contain 26 Meg<br>of information, with another 21 Meg or so on the related ftp site (some<br>redundancy - the first 499 Digests are available on the ftp site as well as<br>with the GET command, but we decided we could no longer support the<br>redundancy).<br><br>The Tuning List was started on February 1, 1994 by Greg Higgs and Dave<br>Madole at Mills College (Greg went on to save whales and is no longer<br>around).  It is supported by the staff at the Mills College Center for<br>Contemporary Music (plug! you can check out our web site at<br>www.mills.edu/LIFE/CCM/CCM.homepage.html) and with the resources of<br>Mills College.  Mills is located in Oakland, California, USA (near San<br>Francisco).<br><br>Dave Madole<br>Technical Director, Center for Contemporary Music<br>Listserv Administrator<br><br>Mills College<br>Oakland, CA 94613<br>510-430-2336<br><br>madole@mills.edu<br><br><br>to unsubscribe from the tuning list send a message containing ONLY:<br><br>unsubscribe tuning<br><br>(No Subject: first line blank - no other content)<br><br>to<br><br>listproc@mills.edu<br><br>If you have trouble it MAY be because you are not trying to unsubscribe from<br>the same path you subscribed from - if so then send me mail related to<br>unsubscribing from tuning (I get a LOT of mail - up to 100 pieces a day -<br>often including messages to other lists that I am on from people having<br>trouble unsubscribing to them).<br><br>Most people have trouble unsubscribing either for the reason above or<br>because they are sending the unsubscribe message with something<br>relevant to the list processor in the Subject:, e.g., "unsubscribe<br>me".  The list processor (almost all of them) automatically rejects<br>such messages to avoid mail loops, especially with peer list<br>processors.  To disable "suspicious subjects" is paramount foolishness,<br>and most people can figure out the message.  If your mailer automatically<br>inserts subjects, then complain to your mail administrator.  Do not<br>just use "r" to respond to the rejection message because then you are<br>in one of those mail loops (qed).<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "kris peck" <kpeck@wavetech.net><br>Subject:  more guitar refretting<br>PostedDate:  08-10-97 01:17:15<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  08-10-97 01:16:50-08-10-97 01:16:51,08-10-97 00:15:24-08-10-97 00:15:24<br>DeliveredDate:  08-10-97 00:15:24<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256529.008093F4; Wed, 8 Oct 1997 01:16:39 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10633; Wed, 8 Oct 1997 01:17:15 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 8 Oct 1997 01:17:15 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10611<br>Received: (qmail 25069 invoked from network); 7 Oct 1997 16:17:11 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 7 Oct 1997 16:17:11 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199710072303.SAA25886@riptide.wavetech.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6246 href="#6246">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>10/8/1997 6:21:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I have done several refret jobs by removing old frets and attaching new<br>ones.  It works fine, and if you have the right tools, the old-fret holes<br>can be made almost invisible.<br><br>   A couple of notes:<br>1.  If you're refretting a 12-string, then definitely put something a lot<br>    stronger than puddy in the fret holes!<br>2.  Using real luthiers' tools, like a saw calibrated to the size of the fret<br>    wire for example, the operation will be a whole lot more pleasant and the<br>    results more satisfying in every way.  The Luthiers' Merchantile is a great<br>    mail-order place for such tools and supplies.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com><br>Subject:  erickson's metal rods<br>PostedDate:  09-10-97 09:46:25<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  09-10-97 09:45:52-09-10-97 09:45:53,09-10-97 08:44:24-09-10-97 08:44:25<br>DeliveredDate:  09-10-97 08:44:25<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125652B.002AA4CA; Thu, 9 Oct 1997 09:45:47 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11749; Thu, 9 Oct 1997 09:46:25 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 9 Oct 1997 09:46:25 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11968<br>Received: (qmail 27452 invoked from network); 9 Oct 1997 00:46:22 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 9 Oct 1997 00:46:22 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199710090343_MC2-234A-AB6F@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
