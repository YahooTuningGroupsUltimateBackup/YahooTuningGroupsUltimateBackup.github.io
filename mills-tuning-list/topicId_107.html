So the tonic<br>wanders over the course of this progression from (in the 88CET notation) the<br>second-space bass-clef C of the opening I chord, to the pitch-class of the D<br>(somewhat less than an octave above the C) of the final chord.  That even though<br>our ears "calculate" the tonics to be the same based upon how the parts move.  <br><br>   Wandering tonics have a very surprising effect if accomplished over a short<br>progression - short enough that the audience can remember the new and old tonic.<br>The harmony says that you've gone full-circle back to where you started, but you<br>mysteriously ended up somewhere else.  If the progression is too long,<br>especially if it has a lot of temporary tonicization, the audience will probably<br>not notice the effect at all.  <br><br>   Traditional harmony in 88CET poses another difficulty:  lack of octave<br>doubling makes it very difficult to sustain more than three-part traditional<br>harmony.  The possibilities for smooth voice-movement when voices can't move<br>through octave-doubles of other chord tones, dwindles rapidly.  Even in<br>three-part harmony, you end up having to use lots of chords with fifths below<br>their roots, or ninth chords (fifths above their fifths).  Secondary dominants<br>become more common than usual solely so to take advantage of the additional<br>chord tone!  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 20 Oct 1995 10:14 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id BAA00712; Fri, 20 Oct 1995 01:14:30 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 20 Oct 1995 01:14:30 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199510200810.SAA18546@extra.ucc.su.OZ.AU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5733 href="#5733">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;David Madole&#x22; &#x3C;madole@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/1997 12:11:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> Topic No. 14<br>> <br>> Date: Tue, 1 Jul 1997 23:07:23 -0500 (CDT)<br>> From: mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)<br>> To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>> Subject: Re: Get Charlie off  the MTA<br>> Message-ID: <v01541103afdf3a06ff57@[207.207.3.147]><br>> <br>> >In my efforts to un-subscribe from THIS list, I have sent (without result)<br>> >the following FOUR messages to listproc@eartha.mills.edu<br>> >UNSUBSCRIBE<br>> >UNSUBSCRIBE tuning<br>> >UNSUBSCRIBE *<br>> >UNSUBSCRIBE ALL<br>> <br>>    Interesting...  You definitely have the address correct, which is<br>> probably the most common mistake I'm told.  The other common mistake<br>> putting the command in the title line rather than the message-content.<br><br>Actually, the most common mistake (Part 1) is to try to put some word<br>like "unsubscribe" in the subject, (the second option, above).  This is<br>rejected by the listprocessor to avoid mail loops (which is necessary -<br>think it through if you must).  The most common mistake (Part 2) is to<br>then ignore the very clear "suspicious subject" message that the<br>listprocessor sends back and to continue to assume that you are sending<br>the wrong message to the wrong address or something.  I don't know how<br>many times my mailbox has been muddled with people simply ignoring the<br>"suspicious subject" message and trying various addresses and messages<br>and then finally sending me some possibly rude message about how<br>nothing works.<br><br>Dave<br><br>Dave Madole<br>Technical Director, Center for Contemporary Music<br>Listserv Administrator<br><br>Mills College<br>Oakland, CA 94613<br>510-430-2336<br><br>madole@mills.edu<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 3 Jul 1997 21:02 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04162; Thu, 3 Jul 1997 21:02:40 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 3 Jul 1997 21:02:40 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04152<br>Received: (qmail 9283 invoked from network); 3 Jul 1997 15:42:29 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 3 Jul 1997 15:42:29 -0000<br>Message-Id: <970703081358_-360091637@emout01.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=8541 href="#8541">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Patrick Ozzard-Low&#x22; &#x3C;patrick.ozzard-low.itex@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/29/1998 10:22:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Dear Tuning,<br><br>just to say - this is my last day at work before my trip to USA and Europe.
