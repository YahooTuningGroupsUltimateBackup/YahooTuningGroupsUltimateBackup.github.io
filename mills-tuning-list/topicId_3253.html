Don't feel like you<br>have to master all of that;  again the point of this series is to use my<br>88CET ear-training CDs as an example to guide your own such CD projects.<br><br>   Before I launch into the that though, let me make clear that there<br>certainly are limits to what you can do with these CDs.<br><br>   First and foremost, let me acknowledge right up front that these CDs -<br>or at least the ones I've produced - have a very major weakness.<br><br>               ****** They concentrate much more<br>                      on pitch than on rhythm.  ******<br><br>This is a very common weakness;  far more ear-training curricula fall for<br>this pitfall than don't!  And most any music teacher will agree that not<br>only do students have more problems, on the whole, with rhythm than pitch,<br>but rhythmic mistakes are usually *much* more discombobulating in nature,<br>and more difficult to recover from.<br><br>   In my defense, I'll do a little more than acknowledge this flaw:  I'll<br>also point out that it's much more difficult to dream up rhythmic exercises<br>that can be exercised on the CD medium.  For reading, and for composition<br>(on paper anyway), the problem is inherently an audiovisual one.  I'll also<br>admit that I've only attempted to devise a handful of rhythmic ear-training<br>exercises on tape, so perhaps methods exist that I haven't discovered.<br>I'll also point out that rhythmic skills are universally important, and not<br>specific to any particular tuning system, so perhaps this is the wrong<br>place to look for rhythmic help!<br><br>   Another limitation, perhaps some of you are asking about is this:  Given<br>that a series of exercises could take up just a few minutes on a CD, how<br>long would it take before you just simply memorize - consciously or not -<br>the sequence of answers rather than figuring out the answers one by one?<br>That is certainly a valid concern.  Consider though, that in three minutes,<br>you can usually get around 45 individual questions out.  It's not all that<br>easy to memorize 45 individual answers, especially if you're making a<br>conscious effort to answer them by method rather than memorization.<br><br>   That is a definite risk though, which means that ear-training CDs of<br>this nature are better used for improving your breadth of knowledge -<br>learning a variety of skills - than your depth of knowledge - working on a<br>single skill intensively for hours.  I have nevertheless made ear-training<br>tapes of somewhat similar nature for intensive training purposes.  And for<br>that, by the way, tapes work great, because you'll be going from beginning<br>to end without much need for skipping around.<br><br>   But even in a short session, there is a very simple and effective way to<br>minimize that risk:  Don't leave any distinctive markers in your narration.<br>In a few of my earlier (12TET) ear-training tapes, I would occasionally<br>inject a side thought or joke here and there.  But I found that I ended up<br>- again, consciously or not - just always knowing the first two or three<br>answers after that event!  So always speak in about the same tone of voice,<br>and change timbres on your pitch sources either very frequently or very<br>rarely.  Once per exercise-type is often a good approach.<br><br>   I'll have some more thoughts along these lines in the conclusion section.<br><br>   With regard to these CDs specifically, they do not exercise block-chord<br>harmony very much.  It's especially weak with regard to root movement<br>between chords.  Although that's a very basic point in traditional diatonic<br>harmony, I haven't found it to be quite as big a concern in 88CET harmony.<br>Perhaps that's because it's a big piece of establishing tonality, which is<br>the historical norm for traditional harmony, but not really for 88CET.  (By<br>the way, 88CET nevertheless can do tonal music, and even traditional<br>harmony.)  I've been thinking about doing a fourth CD in the series<br>specifically for that sort of topic matter.</div>
