While<br>> he must have had some difficulty keeping the string instruments exactly<br>> in tune, he probably came as close as humanly possible.  I don't agree<br>> that the intervals Partch used later in his life were "dissonant" either.  <br>> The intervals continue to be "strange" for many people, but Partch himself<br>> considered them consonances, as indeed they are on at least some <br>> instruments...<br><br>I should have explained further, because it is _not a matter of opinion._<br>What I meant was that Partch's music<br>often avoids using strong, low-number ratio consonances.  Strong<br>interval-ratios (like 1/1) are "well-tuned," and weaker interval ratios<br>in the same area of the "One-footed Bride" [see Genesis of a Music] (like<br>81/80) are "mis-tuned."  It is my belief, and people may argue this<br>publicly or privately, that this is not cultural conditioning, but is<br>simply fact.  It is also my belief that Harry knew this, too.  He did say<br>that we can be conditioned to accept higher overtone-limits as consonant.<br>I agree.<br><br>Often Harry would "mistune" an "interval of power" (fifth or fourth) even<br>when the 3/2 or 4/3 is available on the instrument in use.  It seems to me<br>that he liked beating.  Dan Wolf recently commented on "Dark Brother,"<br>which includes extended passages of chords made rough by harmonic beats.<br>The coda in "Revelation" uses dissonance to portray Agave's shock at<br>finding Pentheus' head in her hands.  These are extreme examples, but I<br>have found cases of less extreme yet intentional dissonances in every<br>piece that I have studied.  If people want to explore this further, please<br>write me to ask for copies of my translations, (abs22@pantheon.yale.edu)  <br>or read the score to "Daphne" in Glenn Hackbarth's dissertation. <br><br>The fact that Harry's instruments (and almost all other instruments) go<br>out of tune perhaps makes people overlook the subtle dissonances that are<br>written into the music intentionally.  Perhaps if someone did a computer<br>realization with sine waves, the tuning issues would become more easily<br>aparrent.<br><br>While Harry Partch was a Just Intonation theorist, he was not always a JI<br>composer.  A JI composer is someone who seeks the strongest, low-number<br>consonance musically required.  Harry was a microtonalist who used a scale<br>which included Just-relationships, but instead of using a lattice-style<br>plan for viewing the consonance/dissonance continuum, he placed them<br>end-to-end chromatically and worked from there.  He also had a keen ear<br>for creating the clanky and quirky sounds that he picked up on the road.<br><br>-Adam<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 23 Jun 1997 12:32 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11211; Mon, 23 Jun 1997 12:32:46 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 23 Jun 1997 12:32:46 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11212<br>Received: (qmail 13719 invoked from network); 21 Jun 1997 18:13:21 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 21 Jun 1997 18:13:21 -0000<br>Message-Id: <33AC194D.BDF4CCA9@fast.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
