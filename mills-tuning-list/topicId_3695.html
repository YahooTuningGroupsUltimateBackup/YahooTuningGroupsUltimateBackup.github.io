Or even<br>better would be something that lets me do Moog-analog style filtering<br>(etc.) on FM-generated sounds.  Now if it has a set of samples to build<br>from as well, then that's all the better, but the scratch-building<br>capabilities are especially interesting for what I have in mind.<br><br>   And by completely "arbitrary tuning table" I mean one that lets you<br>assign any pitch within the range and resolution of the instrument to any<br>key, completely without regard to what pitch you assign to any of the other<br>keys (e.g., no requirement that they pitches be consistently the same<br>distance apart, or that there be any octave repetition).  Not surprisingly,<br>it would be vastly preferable if the machine had a means of storing away<br>these tables as well (i.e., that I don't have to send it SysEx messages to<br>regenerate the table everytime I power it up).<br><br>   Suggestions?  Thanks!</div>
