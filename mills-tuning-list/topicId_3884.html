For example, 19 is<br>proof of the sacredness of the Koran according to Dr. Rashad Khalifa, and 9<br>is sacred to Bahais (their world headquarters building in Evanston, IL is<br>in the shape of an enneagon).<br><br>Eight is important in Buddhism (and physics, The Eight-Fold Way). Thirteen<br>is<br>both unlucky and I think the number of persons in a minyan(?); also a<br>"Baker's Dozen."  Supposedly, it was the number at the Last Supper<br>(including Christ and Judas).<br><br> Larry Polansky finds much significance in 17, though the the Pythagoreans<br>disdained it as it falls between 16 (perfect square) and 18 (twice a<br>square). One can also construct a heptakaidekagon with only a compass and<br>an unmarked ruler. Other constructable N-gons have 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12,<br>15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 32, 34,...257, 65537... sides.<br><br>Capek mentions "triton" (3-toned) music in "War with the Newts" (pun on<br>triton, a European crested newt). Four was sacred to the Pythagoreans, as<br>was 10. Six is a perfect number, as is 28 (4x7, 2 x14)<br><br>I must admit to drawing a blank this PM WRT 11. Anyone?<br><br>According to one account, King Arthur's Round Table had 31 seats as did the<br>number of administrative posts in the office of a Roman provincial<br>governor.<br><br>I am reminded of one of Dr. Matrix's (aka Martin Gardner) proofs that there<br>are no UNinteresting integers (and by extension, no uninteresting ET's).<br>Let us assume there is a smallest interesting integer. Then 1 less than<br>this integer is interesting by virtue of its position. Every number less by<br>1 than this number is similarly interesting.  <br><br>In like manner, one can prove that 1 more than the smallest interesting<br>number is either interesting per se or interesting by position. Hence all<br>integers are interesting and all tunings are worth considering.<br><br><br>I saw Mark Rankin in San Diego a few weeks ago on his way to the Rainbow<br>Gathering. His mailing address is P.O. Box 201, Alderpoint, CA 95511. One<br>still needs a luthier to attach the fretboard holder to the instrument<br>unless one is skilled at cabinetry. There is also a German (?) inventor of<br>a guitar with sliding frets under each string. I don't know the name and<br>address, alas, but<br>John Schneider has one.<br><br>--John</div>
