I would like to check that my usage and understanding<br>of them is not outside generally accepted bounds. Here they are, and I<br>would appreciate any comments and criticisms you may have:<br>1. Tempering initially referred to how one deviated about the system of<br>Pythagorean tuning (ascending|descending fifths|fourths with frequency<br>ratios of 3/2|4/3) in order to temper sour and howling intervals.<br>Nowadays, however, temperament and tuning seem to be synonymous.<br>2. The circle of fifths seems to have generally been started on middle<br>C. This at least is what is suggested by both von Helmholtzï¿½s book and<br>the piano keyboardï¿½s layout.<br>3. Mean Temperament has two general meanings. First it means a system of<br>tuning by fifths such that four ascending fifths and two descending<br>octaves make up a perfect third. It also means any one of many slight<br>variations about this basic system.<br>4. Bachï¿½s WTC refers to a mean tempered clavichord; in particular,<br>well-tempered means mean tempered. Since the WTC starts in the key of C,<br>it seems that Bachï¿½s thought of mean tempered in terms of ascending<br>fifths started on C.<br>Ed Remler<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 3 Jul 1997 21:26 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04316; Thu, 3 Jul 1997 21:26:28 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 3 Jul 1997 21:26:28 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04258<br>Received: (qmail 19302 invoked from network); 3 Jul 1997 14:37:36 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 3 Jul 1997 14:37:36 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541104afe1a93c8c8f@DialupEudora><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
