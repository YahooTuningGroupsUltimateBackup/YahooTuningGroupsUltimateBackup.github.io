"Horizontal" is what you see<br>>moving horizontally across the page, meaning a single voice of the ensemble<br>>performing over time, meaning (essentially) melody, and when they are<br>>compared to one another, counterpoint.<br><br>Like I thought.  So what is everybody talking about?  Paul E had said that<br>music whose harmonies come from the same scale as its melodies is awesome,<br>and I agree, being a great fan of diatonic classical music, but I also find<br>music with harmonies from outside the melodic scale interesting.  What's the<br>problem here?<br><br>>   So sound is, at this otherwise not very interesting sub/atomic level,<br>>ultimately conveyed by photons.  The invention of a new particle, the<br>>phonon, seems to be no more than a pointless complication that side-steps<br>>well-accepted physical models for no apparent reason.<br><br>Carl<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Steven Rezsutek <rezsutek@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov><br>Subject:  Random<br>PostedDate:  31-12-97 16:30:07<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  31-12-97 16:27:44-31-12-97 16:27:45,31-12-97 16:27:07-31-12-97 16:27:07<br>DeliveredDate:  31-12-97 16:27:07<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125657E.0054EDAB; Wed, 31 Dec 1997 16:29:35 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03547; Wed, 31 Dec 1997 16:30:07 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 31 Dec 1997 16:30:07 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03540<br>Received: (qmail 12732 invoked from network); 31 Dec 1997 07:30:04 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 31 Dec 1997 07:30:04 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199712311529.KAA02150@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
