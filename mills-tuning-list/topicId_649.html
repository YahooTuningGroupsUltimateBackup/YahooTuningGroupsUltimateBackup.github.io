I tried a circulating <br>temperament, where the circle of fifths was nominally adjusted by -3, -2, <br> -1, 0, +1, +2, +3, +2, +1, 0, -1, -2 cents. F# was the most dissonant major <br>chord, as expected, but B-flat, rather than C, was the most consonant. I <br>don't think there would be much of an audible difference for music that goes <br>by at a reasonable pace, so I'm not going to complain. But if there is a <br>systematic way of getting better results, I'd like to know about it.<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 23 Jul 1996 17:09 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA08425; Tue, 23 Jul 1996 08:09:18 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 23 Jul 1996 08:09:18 -0700<br>Message-Id: <90960723150509/0005695065PK3EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
