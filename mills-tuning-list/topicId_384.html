The performance was by <br>"Critical Band," a group lead by John Gzowski (pronounced Zosky) that <br>plays homebuilt instruments in 19  and 31-tets as well as using the <br>harmonic series and empirical pitches.   <br> <br>John Gzowski's principal instrument was constructed as a longish and<br>rather wide fingerboard strung with 10 strings and fretted for 31-tet. <br>It was electrified and rested on stand coupled to a space-frame with <br>another 40 or so resonating sympathetic strings. John also played an <br>19-tet electric guitar. He said that he had used fretting kits purchased <br>from Mark Rankin to construct these instruments. <br> <br>Other novel instruments included a rotationally symmetrical Kalimba <br>(Cylimba?) played by plucking or bowing metal tongues, and two instruments <br>made from large dowels marked for the  harmonic series and strung with <br>about a half-dozen metal strings. They might be described as electric <br>tube zithers, though they were mostly bowed as I remember. <br> <br>There was also a self-excited, free-form soundboard (called the Clusterflux, <br>which was strung with a large number of metal strings, studded with magnets <br>and pickups, and electrified. The current flowing through the strings heats <br>them, causing them to change pitch. After it had played by itself for a <br>few minutes, Marc and a clarinetist joined in playing harmonic series on various fundamentals. <br> <br>Supplementing this armamentarium was a battery of found metal objects, <br>large clay pots, and sound sculptures such as a pair of electrified hedge <br>shears, which were played with great verve and concentration by another <br>member of the ensemble. Another instrument appeared to be part of an<br>automobile exhaust system with attached wires.<br> <br>The performers included the violinist Marc Sabat, a clarinetist, and<br>two other musicians. Unfortunately, I did not get their names or the<br>names of all of the instruments as there were no programs and I forgot<br>to take notes. Marc Sabat subscribes to this List, so perhaps he will<br>post more information and correct any errors I have made.<br> <br>The music tended to be rather dense, sometimes obscuring the character <br>of the non-12 tunings. This might suggest that timbre rather than pitch relations is Gzowski's primary interest at this time. A duet, however, <br>by Marc and John for violin and 19-tet guitar was lovely. I would <br>certainly like to hear more from Critical Band. It's a pity that Toronto <br>is so far away from California, they'd be ideal for the Sonic Arts Gallery <br>and similar West Coast venues. <br> <br>--John<br> <br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 1 Mar 1996 22:42 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id NAA13464; Fri, 1 Mar 1996 13:42:02 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 1 Mar 1996 13:42:02 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9603011630.A2692-0100000@email.ir.miami.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2616 href="#2616">ðŸ”—</a>bf250@freenet.carleton.ca (John Sankey)</h3><span>3/3/1996 4:46:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>"On playback, though, I keep hearing the "bending" between each <br>note.
