In concept, given a<br>strong fifth harmonic, weakening the fourth would make the 5:4 harder to<br>pinpoint, and thus make 9:7 easier to focus on.  Using clarinet, squarewave, or<br>capped flute-pipe sounds does seem to help a little, but not as much as this<br>sort of theory would suggest.  <br><br><br>+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+<br>|  Tip #8:                                                                   |<br>|     When trying to get used to 9:7's initial brashness, use well-known     |<br>|     traditional techniques for softening the blow.                         |<br>+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+<br><br><br>   For many people, probably understandably, some means of cushioning the<br>initial shock of 9:7s will be necessary to keep ears from turning off to it,<br>thus abandoning their effort to try to enjoy it.  This applies equally well to<br>composers first experimenting with 9:7, as to the compositional level.  That is,<br>when audiences hear a composer's work after that composer has already become<br>acustomed to them.  <br><br>   So to reduce the initial freak-out potential, consider using very well-known<br>traditional techniques:  For example, explore melodic uses before harmonic.<br>Also, try it initially with light vibrato or chorus effect.  Use it in passing<br>melodic or dissonant harmonic contexts first, and then later in rhythmically<br>accented places in your music.  (In actual composition, I don't recommend<br>postponing rhythmically accented usage for too long though;  see tip #10.)  <br><br>   You may find that, just as with the "snake charmer" feel of 7:6, 9:7's<br>unique, exotic sensation comes out more clearly melodically.  Perhaps I<br>shouldn't even suggest this, because this was not the case for me.  It came<br>apparent to me harmonically from Dave Hill's tape.  Still, if I were exploring<br>it for myself without the aid of Dave's lecture/demo, I suspect that that's how<br>it would have unfolded first.  <br><br>   And in what specific melodic light should you approach 9:7?  Tip #9 in the<br>next installment gives at least a temporary tactic to consider.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 16 Jan 1996 19:01 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id KAA03046; Tue, 16 Jan 1996 10:00:57 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 16 Jan 1996 10:00:57 -0800<br>Message-Id:  <9601131102.aa10482@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
