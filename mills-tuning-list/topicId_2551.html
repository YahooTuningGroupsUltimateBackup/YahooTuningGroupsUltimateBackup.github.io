I even like 12.  I am<br>always amazed at how good it sounds, and at how powerful it is...<br><br>Okay, so to you, 12-TET tunings are powerful (and this is cause for<br>amazement, presumably because of the high integer ratios it employs)<br><br>Carl Lumma writes:<br>Consonance is a factor of the size the number in an intervals ratio.<br><br>In a sense, yes, because the interval itself is a factor of the sizes of<br>the numbers in the ratio.  But in another sense, no: the Random House<br>Dictionary and the New Harvard Dictionary of Music agree that consonance<br>is a factor of cultural conventions and the "mind of the beholder" (or<br>the musical equivalent of that)<br><br>Carl Lumma writes:<br>An interval 16 cents flat of the sublime 6/5 has frequency ratio<br>19723/16585.  This, of course, is our quite dissonant 12et minor third.<br><br>So, 6/5 is sublime, and 19723/16585 is quite dissonant, yet powerful.<br><br>Carl Lumma writes:<br>An interval 18 cents flat of the 6/5 bears ratio 19/16.  It is a very<br>consonant minor third found in the duple 16-32 of the harmonic series...<br><br>And 19/16 is very consonant.<br><br>Colleagues of the tuning list, the evidence suggests that musical beauty<br>is in the ear of the hearer.  I see many claims that low integer ratios<br>produce more "natural" and "perfect" harmonies, but little proof that<br>people actually respond this way.  This makes the tuning list sometimes<br>read like some medieval treatise on the nature of God.  Why be amazed<br>then, that the Devil incarnate, 12TET, wields such power?<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com><br>Subject:  Dictionary Devils<br>PostedDate:  21-10-97 18:17:44<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  21-10-97 18:17:01-21-10-97 18:17:02,21-10-97 17:17:40-21-10-97 17:17:40<br>DeliveredDate:  21-10-97 17:17:40<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256537.00596E38; Tue, 21 Oct 1997 18:16:49 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22998; Tue, 21 Oct 1997 18:17:44 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 21 Oct 1997 18:17:44 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22996<br>Received: (qmail 15842 invoked from network); 21 Oct 1997 09:17:40 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 21 Oct 1997 09:17:40 -0700<br>Message-Id: <19971021161926484.AAA261@NIETZSCHE><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
