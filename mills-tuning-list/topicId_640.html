When editing the tuning table, although the nominal resolution is 1 cent, <br>>the true resolution is in fact a few cents, as nominal 1 or 2 cent changes <br>>often result in exactly the same rate of beating.<br>>2. When changing the pitch of a voice, the resolution does appear to be in <br>>fact 1 cent. However, the amount of detuning displayed may be inaccurate. <br>>For example, a perfect match to the third harmonic is found at 1 octave, 7 <br>>semitones, and 00 cents, instead of 1 octave, 7 semitones, and 02 cents.<br><br>The resolution of the TS/VFX and EPS/ASR is 768 tones per octave, which is<br>1.5 cents.  This does get mapped a little strangely from the front panel<br>display to the internal tuning sometimes.  One trick is to increment<br>slightly past where you want to tune in and then try decrementing- because<br>of the mapping you'll be able to get an offset which is between the steps<br>reached by just incrementing.<br><br>>3. Interpolating often produces strange results. It appears to insist that <br>>all steps be exactly the same number of cents, and takes the liberty of <br>>changing one of your endpoint pitches to make this possible. Often, the <br>>resulting interpolation is backwards, decreasing in pitch rather than <br>>increasing as you go up the keyboard, with one huge step from an extremely <br>>low note to an extremely high note in the middle. The order in which you <br>>specify the endpoints does not seem to matter.<br><br>I hadn't looked at interpolation that closely but I had tried it out with<br>many of the standard ETs such as 19 etc.  Can you give a specific case for<br>the backwards interpolation?  <br><br>Manual Op De Coul's 'Scala' tuning editor is currently being extended to<br>support the VFX and TS.  I've sent him the sysex docs and you would be a<br>good test subject for this.  Contact him for more info.<br><br>>4. Extrapolating seems to work fine. The display won't show you assignments <br>>higher than C8, but they're there, up to a point. Some high notes sound <br>>really distorted though -- must be the digital architecture.<br><br>The distortion is one of the unfortunate charms of sampling and<br>interpolating oscillators.  Because it's skipping steps in a wavetable the<br>number of 'real' samples in the wavetable decreases as you transpose up or<br>down.  This is why people multisample- that is put a sample in the upper key<br>range that's playing at a higher pitch so the oscillator doesn't have to<br>transpose as far.<br><br>Aside from these problems, I hope the unit is still useful to you.  Ensoniq<br>is the one of the few manufacturers of music synths these days which is<br>producing both affordable and tunable instruments.<br><br>regards,<br><br>Steve Curtin<br>Ensoniq Corp<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 22 Jul 1996 17:24 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA02578; Mon, 22 Jul 1996 08:24:28 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 22 Jul 1996 08:24:28 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v02130505ae1947f49b03@[192.168.11.207]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
