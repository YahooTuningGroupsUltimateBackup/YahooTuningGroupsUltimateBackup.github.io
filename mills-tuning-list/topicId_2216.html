However, there are other intervals <br>that are, and in this respect, ET's are 1-D. In fact, in all ET's with <br>more than 6 tones, there is at least one pair of intervals other than <br>1 and N-1 that is a cyclic generator. (For 6-tet, the pair 1-5 is the only<br>cyclic generator).<br><br>Paul is also correct that meantone rolls the 3x5 plane into an infinite<br>cylinder. This is true for any non-cyclic temperament which defines one<br>harmonic dimension in terms of a cycle of another generating interval. <br>Thus a  meantone-like tuning which defined the 7/4 by 10 ascending fifths <br>would roll up (compactify?) the 3x7 plane. A temperament which tweaked the<br>third to obtain the just 7th would roll up the 5 x 7 plane (disregarding <br>the Fifth for the moment). <br><br>I imagine 1/3 comma meantone, with its just 6/5-5/3, would roll up a plane<br>lying obliquely to the coordinate axes. Paul?<br><br>In summary, the dimensionality of a scale or tonal space depends somewhat<br>on how we conceive or use it. Gerry Balzano described tunings of 12, 20,<br>30, n(n-1) tones in terms of triads whose component "thirds" spanned n and<br>n-1 degrees and scales of 2*n-1 tones. Fokker showed how regions of tonal<br>spaces<br>correspond various to ET's and these regions induce different<br>dimensionalities on ET's of the same number of tones. Thus dimensionality<br>is in the mind of the theorist.<br><br>My other major point is, as I think Graham first mentioned, that one can<br>restrict oneself to various subspaces of these tonal spaces. Fokker in <br>New Music with 31 Notes (translated by Leigh Gerdine from Fokker's <br>German original, published by Orpheus), discusses Diamond-like struct<br>ï¿½ <br>in the 3x5, 3x7 and 5x7 planes generated by mirroring triads such as 1.3.5,<br>1.3.7, and 1.5.7<br><br>A skew Diamond may be generated by mirroring the 3.5.7 triad. These <br>scales are equivalent to portions of the 7 limit Partch Diamond and <br>are perhaps visualized most easily by constructing cross-sets (to use <br>E.W.'s term) of the 1.3.7 triad by its inversion, the sub-1.3.7., etc. <br>For the 3.5.7, multiply 1/1 5/3 7/6 by 1/1 6/5 12/7. Alternatively, <br>one may construct a 7-prime-limit Diamond and delete the notes containing<br>the omitted factors.<br><br>Other scales are possible in subspace (that has a nice SF'nal sound to <br>it).  A very nice pseudo-diatonic scale in the (2)x3x7 subspace is the <br>septimal  or subminor scale 1/1 9/8 7/6 4/3 3/2 14/9 7/4 2/1. Five-less <br>chord progressions can sound very consonant and I recommend trying them.<br><br>A final and minor point: I believe Erv's 22-tone constant structure was <br>based on the 1.3.7.9.11.15 Eikosany with 2 additional tones to complete <br>the gamut. In CPS, the 1 (2, 4, etc.) factor axis may be an essential<br>conceptual dimension, even if it can be omitted (compactified?) when <br>plotting notes on paper.<br><br>It is the presence of small "kommata" that inevitably occur when one uses <br>complex intervals or moves very far from the origin and which are less <br>than single ET degrees that makes it impossible to do 1-to-1 mappings of <br>some scales into some ET's.<br><br>--John<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 9 Jul 1997 21:58 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22297; Wed, 9 Jul 1997 21:58:34 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 9 Jul 1997 21:58:34 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22227<br>Received: (qmail 25303 invoked from network); 9 Jul 1997 19:56:40 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 9 Jul 1997 19:56:40 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199707091549_MC2-1A8F-80CA@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
