I noticed recently, since <br>I was moved to Deltanet, that corrections sometimes transmit differently <br>from what my screen shows. Sometimes saving the file and reopening it <br>helps, but not always.  <br> <br>>find the current 1024 and 728 tone/octave M(pitch resolutions far<br>>too coarse for his work. <br> <br>Anyway, thanks Steve, I'll transmit your reply to Erv today.<br> <br>--John<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 1 Mar 1996 21:21 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA10676; Fri, 1 Mar 1996 12:20:44 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 1 Mar 1996 12:20:44 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01510100ad5ccd751322@[206.119.10.100]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
