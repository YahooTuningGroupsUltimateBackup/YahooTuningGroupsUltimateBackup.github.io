He got it from an<br>unpublished English translation of Werckmeister's treatise. (Beware of<br>other listings of Werckmeister III -- they contain errors!)  <br><br>C = +12<br>C#/Db = +2<br>D = +4<br>D#/Eb = +6<br>E = +2<br>F = +10<br>F#/Gb = 0 <br>G = +8<br>G#/Ab = +4<br>A = 0<br>Bb/A# = +8<br>B = +4<br>C = +12<br> <br>As I stated in the review of this performance which I posted to Tuning<br>Digest, tunings are usually described as starting on C (which would make<br>C the note with O cents adjustment), but as there was no standard<br>reference pitch in use in Europe at the time these temperaments were in<br>use, Reinhard felt it best to tune to A-440 and calculate the adjustments<br>from there.<br><br>>From the research I've done, Werckmeister III seems to have been the<br>most popular of the well temperaments.  (Anyone else know otherwise?)<br><br>----------------------------------------------<br>RE: Diminished-7th Chords<br><br>Diminished-7th chords were used by Bach, so they definitely pre-date the<br>establishment of equal-temperament, although they became much more<br>widespread after the acceptance of 12-equal, as they are singularly<br>fitted to that tuning because of their equal intervals.  Note that in<br>reference to a 12-equal diminished 7th chord, transposition to any of the<br>chord members, and inversion, are equivalent.<br><br>When constructing diminished-7th chords in just-intonation, several<br>different approaches may be used.<br><br>As far as 3-limit goes, I've never experimented with diminished-7ths in<br>this tuning, nor have I ever heard of anyone else doing so.  The minor<br>3rd has the ratio 32/27 (294 cents).  Anyone out there try it?<br><br>For 5-limit, the minor 3rds may be either 32/27, or 6/5 (316 cents).  The<br>particular arrangement of these determines the sound of the chord.  There<br>are a few different constructions that can be used; here are the most<br>consonant :<br><br>A succession of three 6/5s is one method.  This gives, obviously, the<br>most consonant minor 3rds, with a diminished 5th with the ratio 36/25<br>(631 cents), and diminished 7th of 216/125 (947 cents).<br><br>Another possibility is a 6/5, a 32/27, and another 6/5.  This gives a<br>diminished 5th of 64/45 (610 cents) and diminished 7th of 128/75 (925<br>cents).<br><br>Of course, allowing for enharmonic equivalence, an augmented 4th could be<br>used instead of a diminished 5th.  Interestingly, using the intervals<br>6/5, 75/64, and 6/5, gives a chord with exactly the same interval<br>structure described in the example above, just transposed.  In this<br>chord, the diminished 5th is technically an augmented 4th of 45/32 (590<br>cents), and the diminished 7th is technically a Pythagorean 6th of 27/16<br>(906 cents).<br><br>All of these are fairly dissonant, and generally they only work as<br>"resolving" chords, that is, they must move to another, more consonant<br>chord.<br><br>As more and more prime numbers are allowed in the factors of the ratios,<br>the number of possible notes that may be used is increased exponentially,<br>making it impractical to list them all in a posting.  However, allowing<br>higher primes also gives more consonant diminished-5th and diminished-7th<br>intervals.<br><br>In the 7-limit, the minor 3rds may be either 32/27, 6/5, or 7/6 (2.67<br>cents).  Various different combinations of these give interesting and (to<br>varying degrees) pretty good diminished-7th chords.<br><br>In mid-1800s Austrian harmonic theory (beginning, I believe, with<br>Sechter, and continuing all the way to Schoenberg, and to a large extent<br>even today), the diminished-7th chord was considered to be a dominant-7th<br>flat-9th with the root omitted.  As first noted by Ellis in his<br>translation of Helmholtz's "On the Sensations of Tone", the most<br>consonant tuning for the diminished-7th chord is to use the intervals 6/5<br>- 7/6 - 17/14.  This  gives a chord with the chord identities 5, 3, 7,<br>and 17, which are indeed the 10th, 12th, 14th and 17th harmonics of the<br>missing fundamental, and in *perfect* tuning, they would emphasize that<br>missing fundamental.  Note also that all the difference tones of this<br>chord are octaves below the chord members, which serves to further<br>increase the feeling of both consonance and the fundamental.<br><br>   Joseph L.
