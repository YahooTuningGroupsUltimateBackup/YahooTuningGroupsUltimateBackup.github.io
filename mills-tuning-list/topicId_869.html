I don't have a problem with<br>>>that since I happen to like that as much as I<br>>>like Partch, LaMonte Young, Pierre Boulez,<br>>>John Cage, Brian Eno or Richie Blackmore. <br>><br>>><br>>>My "Green Machine" record on Astralwerks avoids 4/4 altogether; the<br>>>rhythmic parts are all in 6/4. The whole record is based on the harmonic<br>>>ratios 6/7/8/9, therefore 6 is the fundamental rhythmic element throughout,<br>>>and the 7, 8 and 9 are used as subdivisions of the 6.<br>>><br><br>Ben Neill will be the featured artist on the latest "Star's End Gathering"<br>on the campus of UPenn in Philadelphia:<br><br>                Star's End Gathering VI<br>                8:00pm Saturday, September 28th, 1996<br>                Houston Hall Auditorium<br>                3417 Spruce Street, Philadelphia<br>                Performing Live: *Ben Neill*<br><br>I'm sure you're aware of Ben's music from all the times I featured his CD:<br>"Green Machine" (Astralwerks) on Star's End. And/or you may have heard Ben<br>play at Cloudwatch down in Baltimore around that same time.<br><br>At The Gathering on September 28th Ben will be performing pieces from not<br>only "Green Machine" but from his brand new CD "Tryptical" (Antilles) which<br>is being released on September 10th, 1996. There's also a slide show<br>presented along with Ben's music.<br><br>Star's End is a "Space Music" radio program broadcasting out of WXPN in<br>Philly.  These Gatherings are a combination spacefest/benefit for the show.<br>The last one in late June featured Steve Roach.<br><br>Another JI artist, Robert Rich, is currently touring and will be playing one<br>of his "sleep concerts" at WXPN on Oct 12/13 along with a bunch of other<br>gigs on the east coast.  I'll put up a tour schedule on the list soon.
