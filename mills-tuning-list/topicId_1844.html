V7 resolves well to vi (minor) as well (i.e. up a major<br>>second), and the augmented sixth chord (e.g. g - b - d - e#) - which is<br>>another chord that I think would be incorrectly represented by a 4-5-6-7<br>>tuning - resolves most effectively to a major or minor chord a *minor<br>>second* below.<br>><br>>The stepwise resolution of the intervals making up the tritone in both<br>>these chords is, I believe, the *critical* factor which determines their<br>>resolution.<br>>For these reasons, and the arguments above, I really think that using<br>>4-5-6-7 in common-practice tonal music is not appropriate.<br>><br>>Using this ratio in a xenharmonic music is of course a different matter!<br><br>   I would like to bring to light another augmented sixth chord that may or<br>may not be appropriate to the 4-5-6-7-8 topic, but maybe a new one. Im<br>thinking about the "French Augmented 6th chord".  It came up in today's<br>music class (De Anza College / Dr. Paul Setziol) while discussing<br>Schubert's _Der_Doppelganger_ C. 957 song.  The b minor piece basically<br>ambiguously toys with the b minor and f# major sonorities.  In mm 32-33 the<br>chord is C E F# A#, the Fr6.  My teacher describes it as a non-tertian<br>sonority.  Its intruiging placement in the music is that is resolves to b<br>minor, and not to e minor, which is the traditional progression.  He also<br>talks about the roles of each within the voice-leading context, and<br>delegates the acoustical context to claiming it's "non-tertian", not based<br>on a acoustic triad like the 4-5-6 relationship.<br>   What is the acoustical basis for this chord / unique sonority?  What is<br>the tuning implications of using a non-tertian sonority as a dominant or<br>penultimate or half-cadence function?  Id like to tie in the traditional<br>music theory with something more responsible to current<br>paradigms/controversies....  etc etc<br><br>Richard E Barber.<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 14 Mar 1997 23:08 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18707; Fri, 14 Mar 1997 23:08:11 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18705<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id OAA09388; Fri, 14 Mar 1997 14:06:14 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 14 Mar 1997 14:06:14 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95q.970314153831.16632B-100000@library.wustl.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5103 href="#5103">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MorriSonics@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/1997 1:53:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I think that Johnny R's most recent series of thoughts regarding<br>(partly) choosing pitch relationships giided by scientific principles,<br>natural phenomena, or mysticism, had some very valuable thinking behind it.<br> Thanks Johnny!<br><br>   I think that microtonal exporation can learn a lot, as music over time<br>has, from the history and methods of scientific exploration.  Scientific<br>exploration has shown clearly two very bad attitudes:<br>1.  Saying that something apparently unrelated to the topic of interest<br>cannot possibly<br>    have any bearing on that topic.  (I realize that I recently - well, up<br>to a point <br>    anyway - reacted this way to somebody's proposal.)<br>2.  Asserting that something apparently unrelated to the topic of interest<br>really is <br>    related based upon no clearly-observable reason.  <br><br>   So let's suppose, for example, that somebody builds a tuning system<br>based upon the orbital periods of the moons of Jupiter.  The history of<br>science has showed us clearly that there are two very bad ways to approach<br>this idea:<br><br>   The first is to closed-mindedly reject the idea that the orbital periods<br>of the moons of Jupiter could possibly have any meaning to our ears, and<br>refuse to even listen to music generated in that manner.  A far greater<br>mistake is to listen to it with a predisposition against it.  <br><br>   The second big mistake is to construct such a tuning, play with it for a<br>moment, and say, "yeah!  Wow!  That really DOES sound good" and claim a<br>major musical discovery.  <br><br>   A major musical discovery must be thrown open to such questions as<br>these:<br>1.  Does a fair number of others also react positively to it, or is it just<br>you?  <br>2.  How confident are you that the tuning is what they're reacting to,<br>rather than the<br>    rhythms you happened to choose for that particular composition, for<br>example?  <br>3.  All in all, do you and others react less positively, or at least<br>differently, to <br>    fairly similar music built upon a different tuning?<br>4.  Have you composed enough music in this tuning, and in enough variety of<br>styles, <br>    orchestration, texture, and so forth, to be confident that you, much<br>less your <br>    audience, REALLY understand this tuning?<br>5.  If you can't explain any sort of reason, based upon well-known<br>principles, to <br>    believe that a tuning SHOULD sound great, can you at least describe<br>what it is <br>    about how the tuning touches you that makes it seem so meaningful?  Can<br>you for <br>    example, say something like, "wow, everytime I hear that interval, it<br>just blows<br>    me away", or are you merely reduced to aspecific nebulocities like, "it<br>just sounds<br>    so right!"<br>6.  Does it seem to lose whatever quality it seems to have when you<br>slightly detune its<br>    pitches from the orbits of the Jovian moons?  Do many others feel a<br>similar sense of<br>    loss regardless of factors like, for example, the order in which you<br>present the <br>    two examples?  <br>7.  Again, regarding original and slightly-detuned versions of the same<br>composition, <br>    using some random means of playing one or the other, can or others you<br>consistently <br>    tell one from the other?  <br>8.  Ask yourself truthfully (and more importantly answer yourself<br>truthfully!) what are<br>    the chances that you're reacting positively to it simply because you<br>have something<br>    invested - even financially - in it?  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 15 Mar 1997 23:33 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA25521; Sat, 15 Mar 1997 23:33:19 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA25515<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id OAA13836; Sat, 15 Mar 1997 14:31:34 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 15 Mar 1997 14:31:34 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.480069@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
