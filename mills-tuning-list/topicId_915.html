Comments</h1><h3><a id=3660 href="#3660">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/1996 2:45:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Kudos to Jonathan Walker for his very clear response to Scott's questions.<br>I have had a similar experience when I once gave a lecture on microtonal<br>music to a group of pathology residents and staff when I was on the<br>faculty of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Attendance at path. <br>department seminars was really abysmal, so the organizer, who was also <br>my boss (we were studying the immunogenetics of retrovirus-induced <br>cancer remission in chickens , a lateral step for me from the fungi I <br>usually worked with) decided on SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT to stir up <br>interest. Well, it worked and I had a large audience, but about a 1/5 the <br>way through, just after playing excerpts of Carrillo's Preludio a Colon <br>and some samples of  Harry Partch, the dept. chairman stood up asked what <br>all these numbers were. I then realized  that most people know very <br>little music theory and even many musicians are unfamiliar with the type <br>of <br>theory we discuss on this list. So, since then I've made a point of <br>starting with the basics whenever I speak to an audience.<br><br>Re Complexity: I've tried both Erlich's and Hahn's complexity <br>algorithms (translated into BASIC) and have found them to agree for<br>level 1 complexity in all cases I've tried. Perhaps it would be helpful <br>if Pauls E and H would repost their definitions of consistency. <br><br>BTW, back in the 60's, Erv Wilson defined "efficiency" a tuning for <br>an interval as the fractional accuracy, i.e., the  difference between <br>the best ET degree and the JI value divided by the step size. While using <br>the absolute value of the error is convenient, the sign of the efficiency <br>tells one if the approximation is sharp or flat of the JI value.<br><br>I might also mention that Manuel's "pipedum" routine, presumably based<br>on Fokker's concept of periodicity blocks in prime factor spaces (tonal<br>lattices) illustrates the type of "weird" behavior described in your<br>discussion. Various ET's are defined by the inter<br> which span 0 <br>degrees of the temperament. For example, 5-tet is defined by the 16/15<br>and 81/80, 7-tet by 25/24 and 81/80, and 12-tet by 128/125 and 81/80, <br>though other sets of kommata will also yield these temperaments (at <br>least in the case of 12; I haven't looked at the other two tets).<br><br>Dan: I think your project is very interesting. Can you post some <br>references to studies of the relationship between brain electrical <br>activity and exposure to concordant and discordant musical intervals?<br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 22 Sep 1996 02:54 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA28280; Sun, 22 Sep 1996 02:55:42 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA26480<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id RAA15620; Sat, 21 Sep 1996 17:55:40 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 21 Sep 1996 17:55:40 -0700<br>Message-Id: <32448EE2.1BB9@sfo.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
