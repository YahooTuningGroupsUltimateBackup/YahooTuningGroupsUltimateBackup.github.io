I found a number of such tetrachords<br>in a book by  Octavio Tiby, "La Musica Byzantina," Fratelli Bocia, <br>Milan, 1938. The tetrachords are  12 +13+ 3; 12 + 5 + 11;. 12 + 9 + 7;  <br>and  9 + 12 + 7. In this system, the whole tone has 12 parts (212 cents), <br>and the octave consists of two such tetrachords and 12 parts for the <br>disjunctive tone. Hence the formula is  28 + 12 + 28 = 68 parts for the <br>octave. 12 + 5 + 11 is a pretty fair "Phrygian" tetrachord, but 3 parts<br>is roughly a 1/4-tone and 9 parts 3/4 of a tone.<br><br>Other writers on Byzantine music, including Xenakis in "Musiques <br>Formelles," give quite different tunings in the 30 parts-to-the-4th system.<br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 30 Aug 1996 00:17 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06836; Fri, 30 Aug 1996 00:18:12 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06694<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id PAA16826; Thu, 29 Aug 1996 15:18:11 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 29 Aug 1996 15:18:11 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960829151323.18831A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
