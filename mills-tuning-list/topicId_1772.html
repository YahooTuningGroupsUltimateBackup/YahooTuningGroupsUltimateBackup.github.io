The meaning is far from clearly defined.<br>It's a rather uncommon term; there may only be two theoreticians in<br>the 17th and 18th century who used it: Werckmeister and Sorge. At<br>first it's used in a loose way by Werckmeister, meaning only "well<br>tempered" or "well tuned". Later he uses it to denote a class of<br>tunings with which can be played in all keys and which contains no<br>wolf intervals. Sorge's interpretation is virtually the same.<br>Therefore it can mean either equal or unequal temperament. Noteworthy<br>is also that they spelled "wohl temperirt". <br>A debate on this issue has been on this list in the past however, which<br>I don't want to restart.

It<br>mostly came from the nut being much higher than the frets as it often is on<br>guitars by Spanish makers.  For most other guitars I'm personally familiar<br>with, two millimeters would be too much.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 9 Mar 1997 05:51 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10064; Sun, 9 Mar 1997 05:51:04 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09856<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id UAA02913; Sat, 8 Mar 1997 20:49:38 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 8 Mar 1997 20:49:38 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703082345_MC2-124D-A3AA@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
