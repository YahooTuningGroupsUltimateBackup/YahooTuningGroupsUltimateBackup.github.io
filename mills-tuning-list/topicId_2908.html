Performers  should not  be expected to be able to<br>play with  ALL other camps.  The cost of individual expressions would suffer<br>from this, no?<br>       It is good to have different camps, but when they all begin playing<br>together,  the tuning gets averaged down in an entropic "sift",  until we end<br>up at one ET or the other. ( at least it looks like that is what has happened<br>in the last 4000 years)..<br>    This is not to say that the whole world uses 12 TET, I know better.  But<br>this is the tuning from which we  are attempting to depart, and there just<br>doesn't seem to be a huge train running back to BALI, or slack-key hawaii, (or<br>even to the studios on country row), etc.  so,  yes, we do have a question as<br>to our destination as well as how to get there.<br>       The steel is my favorite instrument, but I ain't waiting for Buddy<br>Emmons to have a network show from Lincoln Center, (He should, you oughta hear<br>him play Bach on that thing, mind-blowing!)<br>     My own approach is to reestablish some of the sense of tonality we have<br>lost.  I am doing this though retuning,(historically) for Beethoven, figuring<br>to force  listeners to enjoy new tunings via the use of familiar music.  It is<br>flank artillery in the assault on ET, but well defended and at times, quite<br>camoflauged.  I am scoring some hits with the CD so far................<br><br>>Will the fragmentation of opinion among tuning pioneers inhibit a >popular<br>movement beyond 12TET, so that alternate tunings remain >the province of<br>academics and isolated pockets of experimentation?<br><br>    No,  I hope not.  The longer ET remains entrenched, the more beaten down<br>it will become.  Music is dynamic, and grows.  The rigid 12ET system does not,<br>and will eventually become one of many.<br>     We "tuning pioneers", (which is all of us on this least, plus others),<br>aren't really fragmented,  we are just all carrying different tools in the war<br>on 12TET.  We are, from one perspective, completely united, defined by our<br>enemy, and enjoying the grunt work immensely.<br>Best regards, Season's greetings to all<br>Ed Foote<br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn.<br>("The Book Of Five Rings" has been very helpful in dealing with some of the<br>contention that arises when one must question others tunings .)<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed) <br>Subject:  Why septimal harmony works<br>PostedDate:  25-12-97 14:27:21<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  25-12-97 14:25:07-25-12-97 14:25:08,25-12-97 14:24:37-25-12-97 14:24:37<br>DeliveredDate:  25-12-97 14:24:37<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256578.0049B35F; Thu, 25 Dec 1997 14:26:56 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA25088; Thu, 25 Dec 1997 14:27:21 +0100<br>Date: Thu, 25 Dec 1997 14:27:21 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA25525<br>Received: (qmail 20232 invoked from network); 25 Dec 1997 05:27:11 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 25 Dec 1997 05:27:11 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.692809@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
