This piece represents an early attempt to unify<br>spectral and tonal principles. For this, Stockhausen used a tempered scale<br>with a step size of pow(5, 1/25).<br><br>Partch Harp for harp and microtonal synthesizer by Manfred Stahnke.<br>Manfred Stahnke, professor of composition at the Hamburg School of Music,<br>uses  a tempered scale with pow(1.9560685, 1/12) for the synthesizer that<br>approximates just 5/4 and just 7/4. Lacking the interval of the octave,<br>this scale is characterized by a constant "tonal shift." The harp in turn<br>has stable octaves and just major thirds and minor sevenths as well.<br><br>Coming Together by Frederic Rzewski was originally scored for ensemble with<br>narrator and varied instruments that pick notes in an improvisatory fashion<br>from a pentatonic sequence of notes. In our version for keyboard and<br>interactive electronics, the sequence is performed by the keyboard player<br>while the computer--following the Rzewski score--simulates the actions of<br>the improvising instrumentalists.<br><br>The performers are:<br>Georg Hajdu, electronics<br>Jennifer Hymer, keyboard<br>Annette Kleine-Rademacher, mezzo-soprano<br>Christiane Steffens, harp<br>Bettina Stucky, narration<br><br>More information on WireWorks will soon be available at<br>http://www.uni-muenster.de/Musikhochschule/Dozenten/Hajdu/WireWorks.html<br><br>Send questions to: hajdu@uni-muenster.de<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 12 Oct 1996 01:56 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14900; Sat, 12 Oct 1996 01:58:02 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14902<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id QAA09869; Fri, 11 Oct 1996 16:57:58 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 11 Oct 1996 16:57:58 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.95.961007114541.21376C-100000@freenet3.afn.org><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3764 href="#3764">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/1996 5:53:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>      So, HOW CAN PITCH BEND BE USED EFFECTIVELY FOR MICROTUNING?<br>> ANSWER: Use a program to enter the appropriate Pitch Bend message BEFORE<br>> the note.

You'll bend the pitch of the trailing end of the <br>> previous note in that scenario.<br><br>This seems an opportunity for a clever algorithm to minimise that<br>effect. It will need as many MIDI channels as the user can spend for<br>each voice. It could select used channels on a least recently used<br>basis except where it can take advantage of occurrences of notes that<br>are multiples of 100 cents different from some previous note in which<br>case it can reuse a channel without changing the pitch bend value.<br>The algorithm could also trade off between selecting the channel that<br>would need the smallest pitch bend change from the previous note and<br>taking the channel which has the lowest volume. It would need to<br>know the voice parameters for that of course. It might also fiddle<br>with the moments of note-off messages if a decaying tone would<br>otherwise be audibly detuned. <br>Has anyone done something like this?<br>The unproblematic case is if one has only one voice and a fixed octave<br>based scale of 16 tones or less, the pitch bends can be set for each<br>channel at the beginning. <br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 15 Oct 1996 17:30 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05514; Tue, 15 Oct 1996 17:32:28 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01596<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA26080; Tue, 15 Oct 1996 08:32:25 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 15 Oct 1996 08:32:25 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.95.961015112628.10820E-100000@freenet3.afn.org><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3922 href="#3922">ðŸ”—</a>bf250@freenet.carleton.ca (John Sankey)</h3><span>11/4/1996 3:58:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Denny Genovese wrote "Sliding tones in the attack of notes <br>indicate that pitch Bend is being sent AFTER the note message".<br><br>That is not true, on many computer-based soundcard systems at <br>least. On my PC(386)+SoundBlaster system, a pitch-bend must be <br>timed about 10 ms in advance of the start of the note, or a <br>slide can be heard in the note attack. A soon as I started to <br>post recordings on the net, I found that a lot of other <br>computer systems and cards show effects similar to mine. I <br>also note that real instruments have decays after the end of <br>notes, and a pitch-bend command will slide them too.<br><br>That's why I ended up restricting my pitch-bends to the <br>beginning of a piece then waiting 1/4 s before the start of <br>note on's. Otherwise, you would have to determine the decay <br>time of the worst- case note-off plus the pitch-bend actuation <br>time, assign notes only to channels that had been quiet at <br>least that long, and insert the pitch-bend to be sent at least <br>the actuation time prior to note-on. Can be done of course, <br>but it would take a lot more programming than my method does.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 5 Nov 1996 01:16 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00569; Mon, 4 Nov 1996 05:58:41 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00567<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id UAA15912; Sun, 3 Nov 1996 20:58:39 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 3 Nov 1996 20:58:39 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9611032353.A22068-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
