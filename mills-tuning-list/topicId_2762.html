The 7:5 is obscured by<br>>the fifth and fourth. There is a slightly stronger case for the 7:4, but<br>>note that the first partial of the lower tone beats with the fundamental<br>>of the upper tone (8:7).=20<br>><br>>The 7:4 forms dissonant intervals with the consonances of the senario,<br>>whereas 8:5 does not (at least not with 6:5 & 4:3).=20<br><br>This is all Greek to me.  All of the septimal intervals are used in<br>Barbershop singing, and I've got some Barbershop that sounds like glass.<br>Exposure to it has been known to cause paradigm shifts.<br><br>>Your phrase "vanishing of the syntonic comma" is unfortunate. This comma<br>>does vanish in the 22-tone equal, but at a value (218 cents) that leads<br>>to excruciatingly dissonant 'major thirds' (436 cents)<br><br>This third is only 1 cent off the 9/7, which is only dissonant if you use it<br>like, or expect to hear a 5/4.  Speaking of which, the 7th 22TET degree<br>offers a 5/4 far better than 12 or 19 tone.  Only 4 cents off.<br><br>>minor thirds (273 cents)<br><br>The 7/6 is the 7th superparticular, one of the most consonant intervals<br>known to man.

But even if one remains<br>>within the same key, many intervals within the tonal fabric become<br>>dissonant so long as fifths of 709 cents are preserved.<br><br>We're talking about equal temperament?<br><br>>To those who treasure each new whining, commatic dissonance like the<br>goose's >golden egg, and hate consonance with a passion, this temperament is<br>indeed a<br>>gift from the gods.=20<br><br>The gods aren't cool enough to have invented dissonance<br><br>>The major semitone (164 cents) and minor semitone (55 cents) are=20<br>>utterly divergent from western habits, though the former is melodically<br>>usable.=20<br><br>But the other isn't melodically usable?<br><br>>Another and simpler way of expressing the non-cyclic character of the<br>>22-tone equal is to observe that the three consonant cycles (those of<br>>the fifth, major third and minor third with their inversions) are<br>>incommensurable. What this really entails is often overlooked. Some<br>>theorists simply look at the 327- 382- & 709-cent intervals of 22-tone<br>>equal, and conclude that this temperament has good representations of<br>>the consonances. In doing this, they forget that as soon as one<br>>modulates (or proceeds by any number of melodic phrases that involve the<br>>simultaneous use of the 5- and 3- limits) one obtains highly dissonant<br>>thirds, so long as the fifths are held consonant. This is doubtless<br>>obvious to many theorists, but not to all. Mandelbaum, for example, a<br>>person of no inconsiderable theoretical attainments, fell into this<br>>trap.<br><br>I don't understand.<br><br>>I do however categorically deny that any singers whatever (allowance<br>>made for the occasional alien with 31-tone equal ears)<br>>can reliably reproduce intervals narrower than 55-60 cents in melody.<br><br>Narower from what?<br><br>Carl<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  sejic@nersp.nerdc.ufl.edu (World Harmony Project Inc.) <br>Subject:  HammerStrings<br>PostedDate:  13-12-97 01:36:43<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  13-12-97 01:34:46-13-12-97 01:34:47,13-12-97 01:34:30-13-12-97 01:34:31<br>DeliveredDate:  13-12-97 01:34:31<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656C.00032CBC; Sat, 13 Dec 1997 01:36:36 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14304; Sat, 13 Dec 1997 01:36:43 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 13 Dec 1997 01:36:43 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14305<br>Received: (qmail 1137 invoked from network); 12 Dec 1997 16:36:38 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 12 Dec 1997 16:36:38 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199712130035.TAA95398@ufl.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
