This allows users to assemble tuning <br>  dumps for unsupported instruments themselves, with the new hexadecimal<br>  output of the SEND command. If anyone will have successfully done this, <br>  please let me know.<br>- More command files are included to do scale manipulations.<br><br>And some bugs were fixed, most notably the system-exclusive MIDI files<br>will now play correctly with the MS-Windows player.<br>Two backward-incompatible changes were made to the command language, to<br>REDUCE and COPY/PITCH.<br><br>The amount of source code has increased by 10% which may not seem much, but<br>it's already quite a large program.

I have seen references to Yamaha using a different octave, can<br>> anyone clear this up? <br>> I find that 'A' is not a pretty note to start a scale on. Could we use<br>C=512cps?<br><br>   A=440 is the A directly below the center line of the treble staff.  <br><br>   Several folks have recommended the (roughly 1/6-tone) lower C=512 tuning.<br>One such effort I recall was spearheaded about 8 years ago by by Lyndon LaRouche<br>and a fairly illustrious crew of opera stars.  I don't know what ever came of<br>that, but they attempted to get the Italian Parliament to legislate that<br>absolute pitch reference.  <br><br>   Most people don't find a lot of concern over absolute pitch though, and a lot<br>of people who develop sensitivity to absolute pitch end up regretting it.  When<br>orchestras retune themselves to other references (e.g., the Vienna<br>Philharmonic's favorite A=448 (God only knows what possessed ol' Herbie to pull<br>a stunt like that!)), it drives them bandanas!  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 27 Jul 1996 07:07 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA13337; Fri, 26 Jul 1996 22:07:36 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 26 Jul 1996 22:07:36 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960727010746_443081960@emout09.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
