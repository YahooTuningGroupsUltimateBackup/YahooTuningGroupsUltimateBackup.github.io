Even with identical timbres, you don't have<br>> to hear the phase shifting for the sound to be changed.  I usually<br>> set a 1 or 2 cent detuning so that it doesn't interfere with the<br>> harmony.<br>><br> > You may want to stop the tuning getting _too_ accurate so that<br>> the phasing becomes audible.  To aim the beats between 0.4 and 0.5<br>> cents you need about 20 millicent precision.  Higher precision<br>> means the beats can be set in tune with the tempo or harmony.<br>> That complicates the tuning process, of course.  Fast, accurate<br>> pitch bends may be required.<br>> <br>Kurzweil K2000/K2500 programs have a "FineHz" tuning parameter that lets<br>you detune each layer by +-6 Hz in 0.10 Hz increments, in addition to the<br>normal cents pitch adjustment.<br>> <br>> What are the practical problems with implementing this precision<br>> on a synth?  I'm assuming the errors creep in when you convert<br>> from a cents value to a frequency ratio.  This looks like the<br>> simplest algorithm that works:<br>> <br>> if (n<0)<br>>  r = 1+ n*5.8454e-4<br>> else<br>>  r = 1+ n*5.707e-4<br>> endif<br>> <br>> Where n is the tuning in cents relative to 12-equal, and -50 <= n<br>> <= 50.  I'm assuming the ratios for 12-equal will be in a lookup<br>> table.  Multiply the relevant one by r.<br>> <br>> The worst intervals using my algorithm are 0.25 cents out.<br>> Maybe this is why we're only given 1 cent steps at the moment.  A<br>> larger lookup table with third-tone ratios should give enough<br>> accuracy for 0.1 cent steps.<br>> <br>Synths frequency resolution is ultimately limited by hardware, which is<br>specified in Hertz rather than cents due to the nature of the phase<br>accumulator used in all wavetable/DSP synths and samplers.  A lookup table<br>is used by the software that converts cents to Hertz (actually the phase<br>increment), either one master octave or the whole keyboard.  This table<br>might be stored in the synth manufacturer's custom integrated circuits or<br>in their software code ROM.  Due to the speed requirements and low math<br>capabilities of the main microprocessors it is unlikely that an algorithm<br>would be used.<br><br>John Loffink<br>jloffink@pdq.net</div>
