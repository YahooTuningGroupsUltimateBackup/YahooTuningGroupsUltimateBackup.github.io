These<br>>would make fret application possible for those of us with no woodworking<br>>tools.<br><br>   I know only that, when Tom Stone's "Novatone" went under, Mark Rankin<br>said that they had a small outstanding debt to the company that custom-made<br>that wire for them.  They were holding the extrusion die they used to form<br>it hostage, so to speak.  I suppose it's fair to guess that Mark ended up<br>paying the debt to that company and bought the die, but I don't know that<br>for certain.<br>-------------------------------------------<br><br>Gary and other Friends :<br><br>I would like to know what Novatone means.<br>On the other side it seems that the fretboards made by Mark Ranking have<br>the frets  glued on the interchangeable fretboards.<br>Does anybody know the Patent Number and date of presentation of the Thomas<br>Stone's on interchangeable fretboard, or other patents ?<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Eduardo</div><h3><a id=8011 href="#8011">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.

Partch includes them in his 5-limit<br>>chapter in "Genesis".  Where does this "9-limit" talk come from?  9<br>isn't a<br>>prime number.<br><br>It comes from Partch himself, who had two uses for the word limit. The<br>9-limit means a musical style where ratios of odd numbers less than or<br>equal to 9 function as consonances.<br><br>>Both 9:8 and 10:9 are used in the standard E9th pedal steel.  Typically<br>the<br>>F# is tuned to 9:8 and lowered to 10:9 with the pedal that raises the B<br>>(3:2) to C# (5:3).  I've always thought of it as a 5-limit system.<br>There's<br>>nothing here to really challenge the ear.<br><br>We're talking about 9:8 and 10:9 as harmonic simulaneities. Normally a<br>major second is considered dissonant.<br><br>I had no idea that the standard pedal steel guitar had pedals that<br>lowered pitches by a comma.</div>
