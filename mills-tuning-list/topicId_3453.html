What do folks out there consider as a useable lower limit in<br>>frequency?  IOW, "How low do you go?" :-).  <br>>Personally, I find the "D" below bass "E", (roughly 37HZ?) to be<br>>rock-solid, the "C" below that to be just on the limit of what I<br>>perceive as a distinct *musical* tone, and the "B" below that (typical<br>>of most 5 string basses) to provide a nice rumble when it's supporting<br>>something an octave up, but lacking something as a musical note on its<br>>own.  [That's why my 5 stringers both have high Cs ;-)] By the time I get<br>>to the low "A" on a piano, it's pretty much a growl that happens to have <br>>some semblence of pitch to it.<br>>...<br>>Aspiring bassist wants to know...<br><br>Your comments remind me of a trick we do on my mom's piano.  We would take<br>advantage of the fact that you couldn't tell what note the lowest key on the<br>piano was. To make it sound like it can go lower than it really can, we'd<br>throw in the lowest key (the low A) with another low note.  So a descending<br>scale would go:<br>          C<br>         B<br>        A<br>        A     G<br>        A    F<br>        A   E<br>        A  D<br>        A C<br><br>So "Mission Impossible" would go:<br>        A  D<br>        A  D<br>        A    F<br>        A     G<br>        A  D<br>        A  D<br>        A C<br>        A C#<br><br>An actual "A" would not make as much sense with some of the above intervals,<br>but the "growl" that came out seemed to go along with any other note.<br><br>And all these years I thought it was just a problem with<br>my mom's crappy piano...<br><br>--Mark<br>+------------------------------------------------------+<br>| Mark Nowitzky                                        |<br>| email:  nowitzky@alum.mit.edu                        |<br>| www:    http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky          |<br>|         "If you haven't visited Mark Nowitzky's home |<br>|         page recently, you haven't missed much..."   |<br>+------------------------------------------------------+</div>
