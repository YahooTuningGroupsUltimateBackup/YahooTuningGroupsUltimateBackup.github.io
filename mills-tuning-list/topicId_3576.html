Paul<br>>was using them before me, definitely extended them to the<br>>7-limit first, and drew them in ASCII first.  He also named<br>>them "triangular".  As I say on my website (and have said<br>>before on this list) _I_ would have called them hexagonal,<br>>like I was taught in Condensed Matter Physics.<br><br>>I don't know how much, if anything, is original to Paul.<br>>He can speak for himself on that.<br><br>My 7-limit lattice is of course a face-centered cubic lattice, distinct<br>from the hexagonal lattice which packs space just as efficiently but is<br>less symmetrical. I came up with the idea on my own, and while at first<br>it perplexed John Chalmers, he later found it to be quite similar to<br>what Erv Wilson had done (exactly the same, in fact, except that Wilson<br>may (or may not) have simply seen the lattice as existing in two<br>dimensions, while I definitely see the two-dimensional representation as<br>being a projection of the three-dimensional one). In fact, my triangular<br>lattices show Wilson's CPS scales as the most symmetrical arrangements<br>of tones, while cubic lattices show Euler genera as more symmetrical.<br><br>>PRIME VS ODD LIMIT<br>>------------------<br><br>>The most paradoxical chord from an odd limit perspective I<br>>find is 4:6:9.  I think of it as extended 3-limit, because<br>>it's the fifths that give it it's character.  It is also<br>>highly octave specific.  It sounds more consonant<br>>(concordant) than a major triad in root position, but<br>>transpose it to 8:9:12 and it's clearly more dissonant.<br><br>Well, I don't know if it really beats a major triad, but otherwise, I<br>quite agree. Here's the interesting thing. When I worked out a model for<br>harmonic entropy, which should also describe critical band roughness if<br>the partials decrease in amplitude in some specific fashion, I derived<br>that to a good approximation, the complexity of a just ratio is directly<br>related to its DENOMINATOR. Later, imposing octave equivalence made me<br>change this to ODD LIMIT, but I admit that it's possible that octave<br>equivalence does not really come in to the "objective" dissonance of an<br>interval.<br><br>Now the chord 4:6:9 has three intervals: 3:2, 3:2, and 9:4. The highest<br>denominator is 4. The chord 4:5:6 has a 3:2, a 5:4, and a 6:5. The<br>highest denominator is 5. So judging from the intervals alone, you<br>appear to be right that the 4:6:9 is more consonant. However, I think<br>the chord as a whole has something that the intervals alone don't<br>explain, as evidenced by the differing levels of consonance in otonal<br>and utonal chords. On the whole-chord basis, which has proved<br>impenetrable to the type of analysis that led me to the denominator rule<br>for intervals, I think the major triad would win.<br><br>The chord 8:9:12 has the intervals 3:2, 4:3, and 9:8. The highest<br>denominator is 8 -- pretty dissonant!<br><br>>There may be ways the ear relates to prime factors.  Different<br>>overtones will be reinforced, and the difference tone pattern<br>>may change.<br><br>Can you give a concrete example?<br><br>>The good intervals in equal temperaments don't usually<br>>constitute anything like an odd limit.  It's generally more<br>>efficient to say how well different primes are approximated.<br><br>This may not work if consistency doesn't hold.<br><br>>For exactness, state the signed errors, and you can work<br>>other intervals out from that.<br><br>Isn't that what Carl Lumma said? But no, you guys are wrong, and that's<br>the whole reason for the consistency concept. Wendy Carlos, Yunik and<br>Swift, and others also seem to have missed out on the importance of<br>consistency.<br><br>>Incidentally, it seems to me that the concept of level-n<br>>consistency is closely related to the recently defined<br>>radius of the scale.  If you want to use all the notes in<br>>a radius 2 scale, it helps if it's level-2 consistent as well.<br><br>I don't think it helps all that much. I think Paul Hahn would agree with<br>you, though.<br><br>>LUCYTUNING<br>>----------<br><br>>Gary Morrison wrote:<br><br>>> The semitruth:  LucyTuning definitely can stack up more fifths above a<br>tonic<br>>>    before approximately closing the circle than either quarter-comma or<br>third-<br>>>    comma meantone.  Third-comma meantone comes "close enough" at 19 fifths,<br>>>    and quarter-comma at 31 fifths.  LucyTuning doesn't get there until<br>about<br>>>    88 fifths.  But this is only a semitruth, because taken in absolutes,<br>the<br>>>    circle of fifths never closes in ANY typical meantone tuning.<br><br>>The most irrational meantone in this respect is Kornerup's<br>>phi based tuning.  Is that right?<br><br>I think so. There are more "irrational" tunings with one generator, but<br>they cannot be considered meantones.<br><br>>I think of it as the<br>>standard melodic meantone.<br><br>I've thought about that too, but I don't know. It is awfully close to<br>the harmonically optimal meantones in my paper.<br><br>>GUITAR TUNING<br>>-------------<br><br>>Incidentally, having different notes on different strings is<br>>a _good_ thing.  It means you get more chords than you would<br>>otherwise.<br><br>Huh? It definitely means fewer positions in which to play a given chord.</div>
