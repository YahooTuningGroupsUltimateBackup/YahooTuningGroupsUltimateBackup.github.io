In a given meantone tuning, there is only one<br>>size of augmented fourth, and one size of diminished fifth. Enharmonic<br>>equivalents (in the 12-tone sense) cannot be used in meantone temperament.<br>><br>>}Of course, music is an art, and there are many different things in musical<br>>}context that contribute to the feeling of, what shall we call it, the<br>>}resolution tendency or naturalness of resolution. However, I do believe<br>>}that one of these criteria in music of this period is that the shortest<br>>}path to resolution tends to be the most "natural" -- thus the importance of<br>>}the leading tone and its sharpening in minor keys.<br>><br>>So I take it you don't like the leading tone in meantone temperament, and for<br>>some reason it's even worse in minor keys?<br>><br>>}By the way, I talked to someone the other day who argued for equal<br>>}temperament because of the importance of the ambiguities possible in such<br>>}chords (the favorite Romantic trick of interpreting a dominant seventh as a<br>>}German augmented sixth or vice-versa). The ability to reinterpret such<br>>}chord structures multiple ways, he felt, was at the heart of our tonal<br>>}system.

You should inform your friend of Handel's meantone organ with 16<br>>tones to the octave, and that tonal thinking arose in a meantone, not ET,<br>>environment. Had Huygens had a bit more influence over musicians, Romantic<br>>composers would have been working in 31-tone equal temperament, and other<br>>sorts of "puns" would have arisen than the ones your friend is accustomed to.<br>><br>>}I explained, recalling the thread here some time ago on the possibility of<br>>}musical puns in just intonation, that such reinterpretations were not<br>>}impossible in JI, especially if the number of tones in the tuning system<br>>}were greater than twelve.<br>><br>>I'm not sure what you mean by this, but after Daniel Wolf posted an expanded<br>>definition of "pun" to include some JI situations, Paul Hahn (if I recall<br>>correctly) gave a good argument for why the term "pun" <br>><br>> Finally, though, we failed to convince each other<br>>to cross over what was ultimately a difference is aesthetic preference.<br>>Perhaps he felt a greater attachment to the tonal-egalitarian traditions of<br>>late romantic chromaticism, atonality, and serialism than do I.<br>><br>>Bill<br>><br>>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>>^ 301 E.

I'm a 2nd year BSC Musical Instrument  <br>>> Technology student at London Guildhall University and I am starting a <br>>> project in which the aim is to retune a MIDI keyboard to a <br>>> tuning other than equal temperament and to then create a MIDI file of a <br>>> composition written in this tuning.<br>>> <br>>> The tuning I would most like to use is a Klezmer tuning. However, I have <br>>> had difficulty finding such a tuning written down. I would therefore be <br>>> very grateful if someone could send me details of a Klezmer tuning and a <br>>> composition written using it (I was told of this address by my teacher <br>>> Tony Salinas).<br>>> <br>>> During my research into this subject (in the very few books that I have <br>>> found which mention Klezmer) I have started to get the feeling that maybe <br>>> Klezmer tuning is very close to equal temperament. I'm sure taht someone <br>>> will know. If this is the case I would really appreciate if somebody <br>>> could send me deatils of another Jewish tuning (such as a Greek, <br>>> Iranian, Yemeni, Landino, Turkish etc tuning)  which is noticeably<br>>>different <br>>> from equal temperaemet.<br>>> <br>>> If someone does manage to help me I will more than be happy to send them a <br>>> copy of my MIDI file when my project is complete.

Here they are categorized by general<br>>topic matter:<br>><br>>Transposition, Pseudokeys and Pseudokey Signatures:<br>>- "Repeat after me the upward circle of fifths"<br>>- "I'll list a note, and you tell me the notes one and two fifths<br>>  above it."<br>>- "Repeat after me the pseudokey signatures of the various sharp-<br>>  based pseudokeys"<br>>- "I'll list a pseudokey and you tell me the pseudokey signature."<br>>- The analogous above four exercises for the downward circle of<br>>  fifths and flat-based pseudokey signatures.<br>>- "Tell me the pseudokey signatures and then, one-by-one, the notes<br>>  of the ascending pseudodiatonic scales."<br>>- Preview of singing 7:4 ratios (because 88CET pseudodiatonic scales<br>>  repeat in 7:4s).  Listening exercise, then singing (with correct<br>>  note name).<br>>- "Sing along with the following pseudodiatonic scales."<br>><br>>Interval-Hearing:<br>>- "Minor wholetones."  Listening, then singing.<br>>- Subminor thirds:  Pairs of naturals that are a subminor third<br>>  apart (once you memorize the naturals, it's easy to extrapolate<br>>  the sharps and flats).<br>>- Subminor thirds:  Listening, then singing them, ascending then<br>>  descending, with correct note name.<br>>- Supramajor thirds:  Usage in pseudodiatonic scale.  Key indepen-<br>>  dent (by scale-step number), then by naturals.  First repeating<br>>  them as stated on tape, then quizzing.<br>>- Supramajor thirds:  Listening, then singing them, ascending then<br>>  descending, with correct note name.<br>>- Neutral thirds:  Same as done with supramajor thirds.<br>>- Operating within a pseudokey framework:  "[an A sounds] This is<br>>  scale step 1. [tone changes to C]  This interval is [pause for<br>>  answer] subminor, so this is step [pause for answer] 3."  This<br>>  is repeated for other thirds within pseudokey framework,<br>>  occasionally injecting a note that does not fit within the<br>>  pseudokey.<br>>- A brief stint with perfect fifths - a sing-along.<br>><br>>A Quick Break from Interval-Hearing:<br>>- 7 general rules stated for memorization, and then a quiz about them.<br>><br>>Interval-Hearing Continued:<br>>- Tritones:  Same exercises as done above with supramajor thirds.<br>>- Three exercises in distinguishing supramajor thirds, tritones and<br>>  minor sixths.  (This is one of my weird, nonsensical hang-ups:<br>>  somehow I sometimes get these three intervals confused.)<br>>  - Listen to supramajor thirds.<br>>  - Listen to some minor sixths.<br>>  - Play various supramajor thirds, tritones, and minor sixths, and<br>>    I am to identify them.  Occasionally inject a major sixth or<br>>    off-fourth interval.<br>><br>><list of exercises concluded next posting><br>><br>>------------------------------<br>><br>>End of TUNING Digest 1370<br>>*************************</div><h3><a id=7337 href="#7337">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>3/31/1998 7:18:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>> During my research into this subject (in the very few books that I have<br>>> found which mention Klezmer) I have started to get the feeling that maybe<br>>> Klezmer tuning is very close to equal temperament.
