The latest version  <br>supports midi in, so you can play tunings from a midi keyboard. If  <br>your version doesn't do that and you wish to, let me know. Also the  <br>newer version is FAT so it will run on Intel-NeXTStep as well as NeXT  <br>hardware. <br><br><br>If you need more help, let me know.<br><br>Bill Parod<br><br><br><br><br>Overview<br><br>This application provides a means of exploring  arbitrary tuning  <br>systems using standard representations (pitch, musical interval,  <br>cents, frequency, and ratio), as well as exploiting theoretical  <br>systems such as Just Intonation and N-tone equal temperament.  The  <br>application organizes these features into two main window styles and  <br>a few auxiliary panels. The two window styles:  Keyboard and Matrix,  <br>contain Keys that may be tuned and played with the mouse or MIDI  <br>keyboard.  A Tuning Panel provides controls that are used to tune,  <br>play, compare, or change the representation of selected keys.<br><br>The user may also play standard NeXT and MIDI score files.  These  <br>scores may be retuned from tuning information in Keyboard or Matrix  <br>Windows.<br><br>Keyboard Windows<br><br>Keyboard windows contain an arbitrary number of marimba style keys.   <br>Keys are sounded by clicking with the mouse.  Multiple keys may be  <br>selected at one time.  This is useful for listening to chords, or  <br>examining relationships within a subset of a tuning. <br><br><br>Keys are moved within or between Keyboards with the standard cut,  <br>copy, and paste mechanisms. Each Key may be tuned and presented in a  <br>variety of representation styles: <br><br><br>	Pitch<br>	Cents Relative to a Reference Key<br>	Cents Relative to the Previous Key<br>	Hertz<br>	Ratio Relative to a Reference Key<br>	Ratio Relative to the Previous Key<br>	Interval from Reference Key<br>	Interval from Previous Key<br>	MIDI Key Number<br>	User Label (arbitrary names, i.e Do, Re, Mi)<br><br>Matrix Windows <br><br><br>There are two types of Matrices available: Transpositional and  <br>Extended Just. Each presents a palette of ratios to be used in the  <br>formation of new Keyboards, although representation is not restricted  <br>to ratios. Any of the above tuning representations may be used. <br><br><br>A Transposition matrix is formed by selecting two keyboards as axes,  <br>and creating a matrix consisting of each keyboard transposed by each  <br>step of the other.<br><br>An Extended Just Matrix also provides a system of ratios. Each axis  <br>represents powers of a specified ratio, reduced and brought to within  <br>an octave of the origin (1/1),  which is centered in the matrix.  <br><br>	<br>Tuning a Keyboard or Matrix<br><br>The Tuning Panel is the mechanism used to tune a key or change its  <br>representation.  Controls in the Tuning Panel are applied to the last  <br>key played. The desired representation or tuning style for individual  <br>Keys or an entire Keyboard/Matrix are chosen with the Tuning Panel.   <br><br><br>Tuning a Score<br><br>Once a tuning is described, it may be used to affect the performance  <br>of a score.  Re-tuning a score is accomplished by installing a  <br>Keyboard's tuning as the default tuning system for Musickit  <br>performance. A score may be heard with a variety of tunings by  <br>installing those from different Keyboards.  <br><br>	<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 6 Feb 1997 02:03 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA26799; Thu, 6 Feb 1997 02:03:19 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA26872<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id RAA14558; Wed, 5 Feb 1997 17:01:07 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 5 Feb 1997 17:01:07 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v03007800af200b2f69aa@[130.132.159.40]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
