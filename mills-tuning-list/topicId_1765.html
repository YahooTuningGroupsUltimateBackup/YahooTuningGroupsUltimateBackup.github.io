And also in 17TET, 19TET and<br>31TET as well.<br><br>   But even if they are tuned exactly the same as they are in 12TET or<br>24TET, the two notes are functionally different.  C# is nominally the<br>leading tone in the key of D, and Db ... well, Db could be a number of<br>formulations, like the seventh of a dominant seventh in the key of Ab, or<br>the root of a Neapolitan in C.  <br><br>   Certainly those keys are not extremely closely related, so the reasons<br>why C# and Db should be identical (or bear any particular relationship to<br>one another), are fairly complex.  A tritone substitution, however, can get<br>you from D to Ab in a flash, so that's probably the most direct<br>relationship between the two.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 9 Mar 1997 05:50 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10048; Sun, 9 Mar 1997 05:50:36 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09860<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id UAA02860; Sat, 8 Mar 1997 20:49:09 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 8 Mar 1997 20:49:09 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703082345_MC2-124D-A3A9@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
