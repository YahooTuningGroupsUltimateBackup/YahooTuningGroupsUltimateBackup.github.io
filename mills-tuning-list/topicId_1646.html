How silly!<br><br>I like  this, Gary:<br><br>>   I've always taken partials to mean:<br>>* "Partials" to mean frequency components of a sound whether or not they<br>>are<br>>  harmonically related.<br>>* "Overtones" to mean essentially the same as partials, but implying<br>>  frequency components above the perceived pitch of the tone as a whole.<br>>* "Harmonics" to mean partials that are in fact harmonically related.<br><br>But Lucy says:<br><br>>Let's call the sounds we hear when we touch the string lightly,,<br>>(which Matt calls "complex tones"):<br>> "ghosttones" (for the sake of clarity).<br><br>No!  Let's call them "Flageolet tones" like the rest of the world (except<br>France, who might think that you're talking about a bean).<br><br>>For an "ideal string" everything Just Intonation enthusiasts<br>>claim may be totally true.<br>><br>>I feel that the "ideal string" is a purely intellectual<br>>mechanism, which may have contributed to some of the paradoxes,<br>>which I have encountered in the "harmonics only at integer<br>>frequency ratios" logic.<br>>I am talking about the REAL (gets rusty from your sweat) string.<br>Since when is music a purely intellectual mechanism?<br><br>You're right that music is not purely intellectual, but it is therefore<br>foolish to propose a non-harmonic basis for your "pure-tuning" since<br>strings will differ among themselves, and certainly all instruments will be<br>wildly different from the others in your orchestra.<br><br>On another note...<br>	Forget the new millenium!
