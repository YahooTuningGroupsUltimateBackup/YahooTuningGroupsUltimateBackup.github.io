Here they are categorized by general<br>topic matter:<br><br>Transposition, Pseudokeys and Pseudokey Signatures:<br>- "Repeat after me the upward circle of fifths"<br>- "I'll list a note, and you tell me the notes one and two fifths<br>  above it."<br>- "Repeat after me the pseudokey signatures of the various sharp-<br>  based pseudokeys"<br>- "I'll list a pseudokey and you tell me the pseudokey signature."<br>- The analogous above four exercises for the downward circle of<br>  fifths and flat-based pseudokey signatures.<br>- "Tell me the pseudokey signatures and then, one-by-one, the notes<br>  of the ascending pseudodiatonic scales."<br>- Preview of singing 7:4 ratios (because 88CET pseudodiatonic scales<br>  repeat in 7:4s).  Listening exercise, then singing (with correct<br>  note name).<br>- "Sing along with the following pseudodiatonic scales."<br><br>Interval-Hearing:<br>- "Minor wholetones."  Listening, then singing.<br>- Subminor thirds:  Pairs of naturals that are a subminor third<br>  apart (once you memorize the naturals, it's easy to extrapolate<br>  the sharps and flats).<br>- Subminor thirds:  Listening, then singing them, ascending then<br>  descending, with correct note name.<br>- Supramajor thirds:  Usage in pseudodiatonic scale.  Key indepen-<br>  dent (by scale-step number), then by naturals.  First repeating<br>  them as stated on tape, then quizzing.<br>- Supramajor thirds:  Listening, then singing them, ascending then<br>  descending, with correct note name.<br>- Neutral thirds:  Same as done with supramajor thirds.<br>- Operating within a pseudokey framework:  "[an A sounds] This is<br>  scale step 1. [tone changes to C]  This interval is [pause for<br>  answer] subminor, so this is step [pause for answer] 3."  This<br>  is repeated for other thirds within pseudokey framework,<br>  occasionally injecting a note that does not fit within the<br>  pseudokey.<br>- A brief stint with perfect fifths - a sing-along.<br><br>A Quick Break from Interval-Hearing:<br>- 7 general rules stated for memorization, and then a quiz about them.<br><br>Interval-Hearing Continued:<br>- Tritones:  Same exercises as done above with supramajor thirds.<br>- Three exercises in distinguishing supramajor thirds, tritones and<br>  minor sixths.  (This is one of my weird, nonsensical hang-ups:<br>  somehow I sometimes get these three intervals confused.)<br>  - Listen to supramajor thirds.<br>  - Listen to some minor sixths.<br>  - Play various supramajor thirds, tritones, and minor sixths, and<br>    I am to identify them.  Occasionally inject a major sixth or<br>    off-fourth interval.<br><br><list of exercises concluded next posting></div>
