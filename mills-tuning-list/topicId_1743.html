These error functions <br>may be squared, summed, differentiated and set equal to zero as Paul <br>described. <br><br>Analogous functions may be written for positive systems where X<br>is greater than 700 cents: (F-X), (T+8*X-5*oct), and (S+14*X-9*oct). <br><br>Finally, the terms may be weighted inversely as the magnitude of<br>their primes. Thus the (F-X) term may be divided by 3, the Major<br>Third term by 5, etc. after squaring.<br><br>Negative Systems:<br><br>1/4-comma Meantone, 5/4 Just696.5784 <br><br>LST35696.8947 <br><br>LST37696.9328 <br><br>LST57 696.8406 <br><br>LST357 696.8843 <br><br>Just 7/4 NEG696.8826<br><br>Weighted LST35  697.0857<br><br>Weighted LST37  696.9982 <br><br>Weighted LST57  696.8269 <br><br>Weighted LST357 696.9229 <br><br>LucyTuning 695.4930<br><br>Wilson's Meta-Meantone 695.6304 <br><br>Wilson's Meta-1/5-Comma Meantone 697.0676<br><br>3 1/3-Comma, 6/5 Just 694.7862 <br><br>3op5, 1/5-Comma, 15/8 Just 697.6537 <br><br>Positive Systems:<br><br>Pythagorean , 3/2 Just 701.9550  <br> <br>6/5 Just, 1/9-SKHISMA, 3 Sabat-Garibaldi 701.7379  <br> <br>15/8 Just, 1/7-SKHISMA, 3op5 701.6759<br> <br>5/4 Just, 1/8-SKHISMA, Helmholtzian 701.7108 <br> <br>7/4 Just 702.2267 <br> <br>LST35 701.71454 <br> <br>LST357 702.0992<br> <br>The unweighted negative Lst Square systems and those yielding certain<br>ratios appeared in Xenharmonikon 2, 1974 along with a number of<br>other tunings at the 11 limit not shown here.<br> <br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 28 Feb 1997 00:06 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA32330; Fri, 28 Feb 1997 00:06:15 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA32447<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id PAA11720; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 15:04:20 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 27 Feb 1997 15:04:20 -0800<br>Message-Id: <970227170944_1382852835@emout19.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
