Does it really support the new MIDI<br>>Tuning Standard? Erv can easily hear a 2 cent interval and finds the <br>>current 1024 and 728 tone/octave M(pitch resolutions far too coarse <br>>for his work.<br>> <br>>For my own information, is the new MIDI Tuning Standard really <br>>196,608 tones (1/(3x2^16)) per octave?<br><br>The MR certainly supports MTS, both tuning dump and note change.  MTS does<br>specify a 21-bit tuning code, which I think comes out to the number above.<br>However, the fine print states that synth manufacturers don't have to live<br>up to that in their hardware- in fact most interpolating oscillator chips<br>can't resolve more than 2048 divisions of the octave.  Physical modelling<br>and other DSP-oriented techniques may do better.  The ASR-10 has a<br>resolution of 728 tones/octave and the MR-Rack doubles that with 1024.  <br><br>For JI on current hardware what's really required are techniques such as<br>Marion McCoskey's, in which interpolation parameters are combined with<br>sample loop lengths to get beatless, essentially infinite resolution.  MTS<br>doesn't really tell you what ratio a given frequency is supposed to be- any<br>ideas out there on an extention?  Maybe the frequency triplet could be<br>interpreted as octave, numerator, denominator?<br><br>>From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com><br>>Subject: Amusing Quote<br>>   I can't recall which, but one of the generals of the American Civil War<br>>readily admited that he was utterly and completely tonedeaf.  He was quoted as<br>>saying that he recognized only two tunes:  One of them was Yankee Doodle, and<br>>the other, he said, was not.  <br>>   Sorry, I'm off the subject, but I thought that quote amusing.  I've met<br>a few<br>>people like that!  <br><br>The members of the Residents also claim to be tone deaf.  Make of this what<br>you will- it may have influenced their (what I consider to be) very<br>interesting music!<br><br>Steve Curtin<br>Ensoniq Corp<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 29 Feb 1996 18:47 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA03807; Thu, 29 Feb 1996 09:47:08 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 29 Feb 1996 09:47:08 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199602291745.CAA14668@inetnif.niftyserve.or.jp><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
