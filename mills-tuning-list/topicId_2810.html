It is possible to be<br>atrociously mechanical and boring in 19-tone equal, and inspired in<br>12-tone equal. I do _not_ believe it is possible to be inspired in 13-<br>or 20-tone equal; the lack of even the shadow of any possible musical<br>order is too great. Other systems such as 24- or even 22- or 29-tone<br>equal, fall somewhere in between. They are poor systems, and have but a<br>fraction of the usable resources of the 19-tone equal (29- and 22-tone<br>equal are much poorer in resources even than 12-tone equal), yet a (very<br>ill-advised) genius might get something out of them. He would be the<br>first, greatest, last and only member of his school. The Indian<br>instrumentalists have waged a losing battle - nowadays almost totally<br>lost - on behalf of a close approximation to 22-tone equal for more than<br>2000 years, so Paul Ehrlich is not without precedent in his fondness for<br>this system. This is as far as the most charitable informed person can<br>go in the way of an open mind. To go further is merely to pave the way<br>for an instinctive retreat into the 12-tone equal, which is where the<br>efforts of the Western microtonalists have hitherto led.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Just Interval Progressions<br>PostedDate:  17-12-97 01:53:11<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  17-12-97 01:51:09-17-12-97 01:51:09,17-12-97 01:50:48-17-12-97 01:50:48<br>DeliveredDate:  17-12-97 01:50:48<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256570.0004AC4C; Wed, 17 Dec 1997 01:52:58 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17487; Wed, 17 Dec 1997 01:53:11 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 17 Dec 1997 01:53:11 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA17478<br>Received: (qmail 13482 invoked from network); 16 Dec 1997 16:53:05 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 16 Dec 1997 16:53:05 -0800<br>Message-Id: <349784F8.17E7@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
