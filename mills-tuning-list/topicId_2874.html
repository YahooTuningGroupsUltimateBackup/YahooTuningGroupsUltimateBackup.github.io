In his own genera, he<br>uses all of these intervals plus an interval of about 75 cents, the<br>hemiolic chromatic diesis.<br><br>Since we have several actual fragments of music written in the<br>enharmonic genus with quarter-tones, I think it is clear that they<br>were used in real Greek melodies and there is suggestive evidence from<br>Winnington-Ingram's analysis of the Spondeion scale that the 3/4<br>interval was also used. The interval 12/11 occurs in Ptolemy's scales<br>as well and may represent the practice of 2nd Century CE Alexandria.<br><br>There is some question as to how large the 1/4-tone diesis was.<br>It is thought that in the late 5th century BCE, the limma in the<br>original limmatal-ditonal enharmonic trichord was split into two<br>microtones of roughly 45 cents, though the ancient writers do not give<br>the exact measures. The earliest actual enharmonic tuning we have<br>is Archytas's  (390 BCE) and his  enharmonic tetrachord consists of an<br>approximate 1/3-tone, a 1/4-tone and a major third. The 28/27 first<br>interval is thought to have been  chosen in order to make a 7/6 with<br>the note a 9/8 below the first note of the tetrachord (hyperhypate,<br>mese). The archaic enharmonic Dorian harmonia of Aristeides<br>Kointilianos has  this note and it is used prominently in the<br>Orestes fragment. Bacchios calls this interval an ekbole or<br>eklysis and it apparently occurred in the chromatic genus as well.<br><br>Although the enharmonic genus fell into disuse in the 3rd century,<br>the theorists continued to describe enharmonic tunings with either<br>nearly equal quarter-tones such as Eratosthenes's 40/39 x 39/38 x<br>19/15, which is acoustically almost identical to the earlier<br>Pythagorean tuning (and close to Aristoxenos's theoretical 50 + 50<br>+ 400 cents), and Didymos's 32/31 x 31/30 x 5/4 or very unequal<br>microtones such as Ptolemy's 46/45 x 24/23 x 5/4.<br><br>What one sees is a gradual widening of the enharmonic diesis from a<br>very narrow quarter-tone though a third-tone and a 3/8-tone to a<br>semitone. While the Greek form of the chromatic genus eventually died<br>out as well, Hellenistic (and Roman) music was diatonic with some<br>chromaticism, sometimes of the modern Near Eastern type using<br>tetrachords of the form 1/2 3/2 1/2 (Winnington-Ingram).<br><br>I don't deny, though, that the 1/3 is a valid musical interval.<br>Greek Orthodox liturgical music uses intervals close to third<br>tones in some scales according to some authorities.<br><br>I feel you are somewhat misinformed about the popularity of Harry<br>Partch's music. I once heard a new listener come up to HP after<br>a concert  and tell him that she had never heard real music before.<br>A national magazine once described his music as the only new music<br>that listeners really like. While no type of "experimental" music is<br>overwhelmingly popular with the general public, Partch's recordings<br>continue to sell well and his music continues to inspire composers,<br>theorists, and instrument builders. I would hazard that a significant<br>part of this List became interested in non-12 tone music because<br>of Harry Partch's music.<br><br>--John<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Steven Rezsutek <rezsutek@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov><br>Subject:  Steel is Cool<br>PostedDate:  22-12-97 15:40:01<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  22-12-97 15:37:51-22-12-97 15:37:52,22-12-97 15:37:24-22-12-97 15:37:25<br>DeliveredDate:  22-12-97 15:37:25<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256575.00505C47; Mon, 22 Dec 1997 15:39:41 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA23710; Mon, 22 Dec 1997 15:40:01 +0100<br>Date: Mon, 22 Dec 1997 15:40:01 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22875<br>Received: (qmail 10312 invoked from network); 22 Dec 1997 06:39:58 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 22 Dec 1997 06:39:58 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199712221439.JAA19836@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
