One respondent said that in<br>baroque repertoire it's really not the upper note, but the more dissonant<br>note.  Three people also mentioned that it depends on the note before it<br>but slightly disagreed on what the dependency is.<br><br>   Three respondents also suggested that it depends on the country, or I'd<br>think more likely the "school" (e.g., German-English vs. Italian vs.<br>French-Russian).<br><br>   So in short, like the Harvard folks said, it's an involved topic.<br><br>   With regard to jazz, I can't seem to conjure up any jazz piece with a<br>trill in it;  can any of you?  By that I mean a trill used in the classical<br>sense:  an ornament as a form of melodic accent, such as at a phrase ending.<br>That as opposed to, for lack of a better phrase, a stand-alone "effect".  <br>Then again, I mostly do classical and Baroque, so it probably wouldn't <br>surprise me if there are some.</div><h3><a id=8753 href="#8753">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.

This<br>happens when trying to do a major second trill with an open string and<br>the note on its second string. On a guitar with light strings and low<br>action, the player will not be able to achieve a well-articulated<br>pull-off from the upper note without bending it considerably.</div><h3><a id=8759 href="#8759">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.
