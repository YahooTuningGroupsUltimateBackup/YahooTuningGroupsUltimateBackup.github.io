Didn't<br>> the word come out of early 20th-century experiments with 24TET, 96TET,<br>> and other tunings that were derived by subdividing 12TET?  Its meaning<br>> seems clear in that context.<br><br> Yes. Many years ago, when I went to the fonts which I was able to get to, I<br>was surprised about the intention of the word "microtone". Carrillo simply<br>divided the "tone" in "parts" (4, 8, 16, 32) and he didn't make a<br>substancial relation with harmonics.<br>More yet, Carrillo denied the 53 (I have got a 1938 article of him) although<br>Novaro claimed for it, as I do.<br><br>Some years before Carrillo, Ellis promoted the "Cents" (Ordinal number for<br>any interval of the 1200 that there are in the 1200 root of 2 scale) as a<br>way to yardstick the intervals. He mesures any interval with a proposed<br>smallest one.<br><br>I began my studies on the numbers for intonation in the'70's and I<br>rediscovered the skhisma that I coined as "Musical Atom".<br>Well, I am a chemist and such a name has its deep origins in my mind.<br>In those times I had the hope that this microtone would divide exactly the<br>intervals. Really it only divide exactly the Pith. comma (12.0 Musical<br>Atoms) and 81/80 (11.0). The fanny thing is that Siemen Terpstra (Holand),<br>whom I didn't know, last year has reported to me that in the '70's he also<br>claims for the expression "Musical Atom" instead of Skhisma. He also worked<br>on 53 and had a 53 electric slide guitar made.<br>He also claims that the use of our Musical Atom is a Harmonic-related<br>microtone to yardstick the intervals and in this sence this is better than<br>Ellis proposal.<br><br>I chose (for the 3 and 5 options) 1/9 of a musical atom as the better<br>microtone to minimize the fifth. At that time I didn't know Helmholtz nor<br>Ellis. Helmholtz hierarchisizes the 5/4 using the 1/8 of a skhisma and I use<br>1/9 of the musical atom for 5/3 due to the simple reason that 5/3 is better<br>than 5/4.<br><br><br><br>Eduardo<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>      Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi            e-mail : esabat@adinet.com.uy<br>Home: Simon Bolivar 1260       Office FAX-Phone : 598 2 900353<br>      11300 Montevideo               Home Phone : 598 2 780952<br>      Uruguay</div>
