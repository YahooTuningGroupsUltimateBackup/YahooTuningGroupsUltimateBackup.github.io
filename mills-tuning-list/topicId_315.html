It is well discussed that his tablature <br>notation makes reading a score tedious, but it is not so well discussed <br>that the scores themselves are relatively hard to get.<br><br>I am told that the stop and go process of home-style transcriptions of <br>Partch's music into Ben Johnston's notation has amassed to encompass <br>almost the entire repertoire, but the contributors to this project are <br>scattered and not coordinated.<br><br>If you have transcribed or arranged any of Partch's music for his own <br>instruments or others, I would appreciate <br>your help by letting me know which pieces you have done, how it is <br>notated, and for which instruments it is (if not for the originals).  I <br>can then compile and distribute a list, which will simply allow people to <br>contact others as potential sources for copies.<br><br>Adam B.
