So, here it is again.<br><br>Re Kraehenbuehl and Schmidt: K & B  proposed a 12 out of 22 as the next=20<br>step in Western music and the 4:5:6:7 chord as the basic consonance.=20<br>Their procedure was to interpolate new notes into the larger intervals<br>of the older tuning. By this means, which they attribute to Prosdocimus<br>of Bellemandis, the pentatonic became the diatonic, the diatonic the<br>chromatic, etc.<br><br>See: Kraehenbuehl, David and Christopher Schmidt. "On the Development=20<br>of Musical Systems," =CAJournal of Music Theory: vol. 6 no. 1,<br>Spring 1962. pp. 32-65.<br><br>Alas, I've never seen the Ogolovets article.<br><br>BTW, Yasser lived and worked in Shanghai after leaving Russia during=20<br>the Revolution. I recommend his "Medieval Quartal Harmony: A Plea<br>for Restoration" (1938). It also appeared as a three part article in=20<br>the Musical Quarterly vol 23 (170-197) April 1937, (336-366) July, '37=20<br>and vol 24 (351-385) July 1938. He wrote about Chinese and Siberian music=<br>=20<br>(he spent some time in Siberia on his way to China). In NYC he became<br>very well-known as an organist and authority on Jewish music, which<br>he felt was largely pentatonic and should be harmonized with quartal<br>chords. I think ethnocentric is a somewhat oversimplified judgement,<br>though perhaps true to some extent. He seemed to feel that Thai music<br>in particular, was limited by its 7-tet intonation and that going<br>to 14 was no more of an advance than going to 24 would be for us.<br><br>BTW, Yasser did hear a piano in 19 and gave a lecture-demo with it.<br>I am unclear from what Yasser himself told me and/or from the description=<br>=20<br>in the annotated bibliography compiled by Albert Weisser exactly whether<br>this was two pianos in 19 or one "specially preprared" piano in 19.=20<br>Weisser states it was the latter. It was done in 1935 at "Steinway and<br>Sons in their New York studios." The talk was called "Supra-Diatonicsm<br>in Live Sound." This should satisfy critics who think that Yasser never<br>heard 19-tet. However, this experiment came 3 years after his book<br>was published and his theory was in its mature form. Yasser admitted<br>that it was hard to hear the 12+7 scale "as something inconstesibly<br>clear and convincing." (The quotes are from the bibliography and are<br>Yasser's words with or without minor paraphrasis.)=20<br><br>Re Hexachord: I've often wondered about the hexachord myself. Some=20<br>tunings of Wilson's hexany (i.e., the 1.3.5.9) approximate the hexachord,=<br>=20<br>but in general, I've found it difficult to generate new scales based=20<br>on it. Lou Harrison has composed with hexatonic scales.<br><br>Refield's scale: This scale has 3 minor triads on the 1/1, 4/3 and 3/2<br>and two major.Its modes are inversions of the Ptolemaic ones. I wasn't<br>proposing it as a tuning of the major scale, but pointing out that<br>Ptolemy's Intense Diatonic generates only half of the major-minor system.<br>For a more complete discussion of the chordal genesis of the modal<br>system, see Ellis's additions to Helmholtz. I think this is pretty much<br>theoretical post-hoc musicology, but it is interesting and suggested to<br>me at least, a way of harmonically generating scales.<br><br>Personally, I think the tritriadic genesis of the major and minor<br>scales to be post-hoc theorizing, but the fact that it is possible and<br>largely agrees with musical usage, is further evidence for the<br>"fitness" of the major and minor modes for tonal music. The challenge<br>is to find as convincing analogues and homologues for xenharmonic music.<br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 24 Nov 1996 17:21 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05871; Sun, 24 Nov 1996 17:23:22 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06088<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA19693; Sun, 24 Nov 1996 08:23:19 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 24 Nov 1996 08:23:19 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.961124080011.10035D-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4147 href="#4147">ðŸ”—</a>bil@ccrma.Stanford.EDU (Bill Schottstaedt)</h3><span>11/25/1996 10:29:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I started trying to respond to Brian's condemnation of<br>algorithmic composition, but the more I type, the more<br>I delete.  I don't think there's any great need to<br>pounce on composers for using words in a general way --<br>why not try to understand what problems they're dealing<br>with, rather than shouting about Science?  For example,<br>in my own case, I got interested in algorithmic composition<br>because it gave me a way to break out of a personal rut --<br>a freer form of improvisation if you will, and it was<br>for ten years a time of complete exhileration.  I would<br>run 50 or 100 algorithmic "takes" (mostly just tweaking<br>random number seeds), extract the stuff that caught my<br>ear, and goof around with that until a finished piece<br>of music emerged.  99% of the "work" was done by the<br>computer.  I wrote the algorithms and chose the output<br>I liked, so I call myself the composer.  The other source<br>of ideas was a similar kind of goofing around with <br><br>sounds (synthesized or recorded); in either case, there<br>was a conscious effort to make mistakes -- that is,<br>the most fruitful compositional paths, in my case,<br>were opened up when I just blindly charged into something<br>without having any idea what I was doing.  After the fact,<br>I could make a sensible narrative to explain why that<br>path was a World-Historical Necessity.  So, I think Brian's<br>attacks are counter-productive, assuming any composer<br>is listening -- my advice is, pay no attention to the<br>experts!  Who cares what "experimental" means, or whether<br>the means were "valid" or whether an unaided human could have<br>done the same thing given 10 lifetimes?  In composition,<br>it's the result that count.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 25 Nov 1996 20:42 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07329; Mon, 25 Nov 1996 20:43:55 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07401<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA07698; Mon, 25 Nov 1996 11:43:47 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 25 Nov 1996 11:43:47 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3299F63B.66F4@media.mit.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
