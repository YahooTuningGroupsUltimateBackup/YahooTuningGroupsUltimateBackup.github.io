I'd have to paint myself a 19 tone fretboard - that<br>> sounds like fun, actually.  Tuning the strings, pedals and knee levers would<br>> be a snap with my Korg tuner.<br><br>I'm afraid I'm very ignorant about the pedal steel. However, here are<br>the 19-tone equal fret lengths for a guitar with a scale length of 25<br>inches. These frets give a stretched octave of 1202.7 cents, which is<br>what I recommend for the best harmony. These figures do not include the<br>necessary compensation (necessary on guitars at any rate) which would<br>_decrease_ these values by something on the order of 0.07 inches (more<br>for the bass strings, less for the treble). I give only the first 19<br>frets, since the little-used higher frets would perhaps be too close<br>together to play easily, and are, as I understand, less used in any<br>event. However, I'm not a guitar player, so someone else on the list who<br>has actually built a guitar or other stringed instrument will probably<br>be a better source of info. However, I can comment on fret placement and<br>compensation, if you have questions.<br><br>Fret number from nut		Fret distance from nut in inches<br>1							0.90<br>2							1.76<br>3							2.60<br>4							3.40<br>5 (minor third)				4.18<br>6 (major third)				4.92<br>7							5.65<br>8 (fourth)					6.34<br>9							7.01<br>10							7.66<br>11 (fifth)					8.28<br>12							8.88<br>13 (minor sixth)			9.46<br>14 (major sixth)			10.02<br>15							10.55<br>16							11.07<br>17							11.57<br>18							12.05<br>19 (octave)					12.52<br><br>I apologize to those to whom what follows is elementary. Here is how to<br>find fret lengths in any temperament you may desire:<br>1. Convert from the cents of the interval you're interested in, to the<br>equivalent power of 10, that is to say to the logarithm (this is what a<br>logarithm is, a power of 10; for example the log of 100 is 2, because we<br>must raise 10 to the second power, i. e. 10 squared, to get 100)<br>2. Raise 10 to this power to get the decimal ratio of the cent interval<br>3. Divide total string length (or scale length, i.e. the length of<br>string from nut to bridge) by this decimal ratio; this will give you the<br>part of the string that will sound the desired interval, i.e. that will<br>sound the note above the note of the open string. I wish I could give a<br>diagram here...<br>4. Finally, to find the distance from the nut, subtract the distance<br>from the bridge from the total length of the string from nut to bridge<br><br>For example, to find the fret sounding the pitch 696.3 cents above the<br>note sounded by an open string of length 25 inches:<br>1.   696.3/(1200/log(2))     (divide 1200 by the log of 2, then take the<br>result and divide 1200 by that result)     = .174672654984<br>2.   10^.174672654984     (raise 10 to the .174672654984 power)   =<br>1.49510830872<br>3.    25 inches/1.49510830872    (divide the scale length 25 inches by<br>the result)<br>    =16.7211966212 inches from the bridge<br>4.  25 inches - 16.7211966212 inches = 8.27880337882 inches from nut,<br>which we can round to 8.28 inches, as in the above table<br><br>These are not difficult calculations, and anyone with a pocket<br>calculator can perform them.<br><br>This does _not_ take into account compensation however, which typically<br>requires that the scale length be lengthened by 1 to 5 millimeters<br>(according to Fletcher & Rossing: Physics of Musical Instruments, p.<br>228). The bass strings particularly require to be lengthened, hence the<br>angled bridge concept. Electric basses are said to require even more<br>compensation. If this compensation is not made, fretted notes will be<br>sharper than open ones. Perhaps I should do a post on compensation, and<br>see if someone with more experience than I have (I'm not a guitar player<br>or maker) has some more thoughts on the subject. But there are some<br>makers, I am told, including even some professional guitar-makers, who<br>do not properly compensate, so their instruments do not give terribly<br>accurate results. Some of the compensation techniques are patented, I<br>believe.<br><br>The log of 2 refers to the definition of the cent, and is not to be<br>changed merely because we have stretched the octave.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Szende not Szasz<br>PostedDate:  18-12-97 01:54:49<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  18-12-97 01:52:44-18-12-97 01:52:44,18-12-97 01:52:21-18-12-97 01:52:22<br>DeliveredDate:  18-12-97 01:52:22<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256571.0004D1BA; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 01:54:34 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18266; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 01:54:49 +0100<br>Date: Thu, 18 Dec 1997 01:54:49 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18545<br>Received: (qmail 812 invoked from network); 17 Dec 1997 16:54:46 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 17 Dec 1997 16:54:46 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3498D678.3D51@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
