The context and<br>tone of voice in those statements suggests that doing so would make them<br>feel vain, like doing so implies that they're giving the impression of<br>immortalizing themselves.<br><br>   I certainly don't frequently listen to my own music, but when I do from<br>time to time, I often do find it enjoyable.  But not - unless I'm deluding<br>myself somehow - from the perspective of vanity.  Instead its from the<br>perspective of reveling in the joys of a completed effort.  Usually these<br>are efforts that I enjoyed doing, so I relive, in essence, "the good<br>times".  Perhaps it's kind of like looking at vacation photos.<br><br>   Anybody others of you have that sort of feeling from listening to your<br>own music, or perhaps any other thoughts on that topic?<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com><br>Subject:  TUNING digest 1244<br>PostedDate:  25-11-97 11:04:06<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  25-11-97 11:02:39-25-11-97 11:02:39,25-11-97 11:02:41-25-11-97 11:02:41<br>DeliveredDate:  25-11-97 11:02:41<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125655A.00372862; Tue, 25 Nov 1997 11:02:28 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00574; Tue, 25 Nov 1997 11:04:06 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 25 Nov 1997 11:04:06 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00570<br>Received: (qmail 8420 invoked from network); 23 Nov 1997 08:23:37 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 23 Nov 1997 08:23:37 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199711231120_MC2-2943-DF5A@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
