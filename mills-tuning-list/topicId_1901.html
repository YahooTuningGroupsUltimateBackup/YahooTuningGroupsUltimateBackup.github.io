I apologize if, since I didn't save the<br>message, I am misquoting him, but he said something to the effect that,<br>"certainly if you're interested in a music of the spheres, pi is a natural<br>basis for the tuning of that music".  <br><br>   Charles, there's a term for that:  "Fuzzy thinking".  You're saying that<br>if music has something to do with spheres, spheres are related to the<br>number pi, then since LucyTuning has something to do with pi, clearly music<br>of the spheres implies the use of LucyTuning.<br><br>   That's conclusion is meaningless unless the relationship between pi and<br>spheres is the same as, or a clear consquence of, the relationship between<br>pi and LucyTuning.  If those two relationships bear no resemblance to one<br>another, then the mere fact that they both use the number pi is<br>uninteresting.  <br><br>   Are you equally prepared to suggest that LucyTuning must be rendered on<br>computers because LucyTuning's octaves bear power-of-two frequency<br>relationships to one another, and computers use a power-of-two place-value<br>(i.e., binary) number system?  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 26 Mar 1997 14:58 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18070; Wed, 26 Mar 1997 14:58:30 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18081<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id FAA27093; Wed, 26 Mar 1997 05:52:20 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 26 Mar 1997 05:52:20 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703260816_MC2-134D-AB36@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5202 href="#5202">ðŸ”—</a>Brian Belet &#x3C;BBELET@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/1997 9:42:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Wed, 26 Mar 1997 08:47:52 -0800 Manuel Op de Coul said:<br>>From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com><br>>Manuel wrote,<br>>>I find "odd-limit" an unsatisfactory term.
