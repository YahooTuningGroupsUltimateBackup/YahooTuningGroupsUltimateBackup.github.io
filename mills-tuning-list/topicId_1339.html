        <a href="/mills-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Experimental Music: Varese; Cage and Microtonality</h1><h3><a id=4262 href="#4262">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;106232.3266@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/1996 9:06:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>In fact for nearly every occasion that Varese publicly rejected the term, I<br>can find another source (particularly in his correspondance with funding<br>sources or presenters) where Varese uses the term without complaint. As to<br>pretentiousness, Varese's use of pseudo-scientific terminology is unmatched<br>(Integrales, Hyperprism, Ionisation, Density...). And the quote that Randy<br>Winchester gives merely shows how Varese transfered the experimentation to<br>the listener without removing it from the musical situation altogether.<br><br>Surprisingly not out of date - with regard to this topic - is the first<br>chapter of Michael Nyman's 1974 book _Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond_<br>(Schirmer, due for a second edition next year), which is a 26 page attempt<br>to define the term. Nyman is extremely careful not to identify the term in<br>scientific terms, but in terms of Cage's musical division of labor into<br>composing/performing/listening. Also useful are the notebooks of George<br>Brecht, published in a reproduction of his manuscripts perhaps five years<br>ago in Cologne, which include his notes from Cage's class at the New School<br>for Social Research. Cage's introductory lectures to this course are a real<br>model of how one might still profitably organize a composition seminar,<br>beginning with a discussion of acoustical parameters and their musical<br>(culturally defined) organization.  <br><br>In the context of this forum it is worth pointing out some connections<br>between Cage and the microtonal community. It was Cage, for example, who<br>wrote a letter to Schoenberg on behalf of Ivor Darreg, and who introduced<br>Darreg to the quarter-tone composer (and sometime Partch patroness) Mildred<br>Couper (this is someone deserving of research!); further, Cage, more than<br>once wrote letters or gave references in support of Partchï¿½s work, despite<br>Partchï¿½s public denouncements of Cage. In Cageï¿½s own music, microtonality<br>is not a central factor until his very last works, but (off the top of my<br>head - and ignoring works where noise is the chief factor)) _Atlas<br>Eclipticalis_, much of the _Song Books_, the violin version of _Cheap<br>Imitation_, and the scores derived from Thoreau drawings (eg _Renga_) are<br>explicitly microtonal. HPSCHD - co-composed with Hiller - is a multiple<br>division extravaganza. The last series of pieces, the **Number** pieces,<br>includes several with microtonal notations, indicating up to seven levels<br>of differentiation from 12tet pitches. That Cage did not look at this<br>material _systematically_  (i.e. as 96tet, for example) is another topic<br>altogether.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 08:15 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA19501; Wed, 4 Dec 1996 14:15:35 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA21038<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id FAA24057; Wed, 4 Dec 1996 05:15:32 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 4 Dec 1996 05:15:32 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612041315.PAA26237@info.forthnet.gr><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
