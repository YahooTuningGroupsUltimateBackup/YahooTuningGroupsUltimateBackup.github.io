The nodal point at<br>the reed end of a typical wind pipe is inherently much more elastic in<br>nature though.

I make my samples in CPS, not<br>> cents<br>> so if one is starting with a base freq of 440 then multiplying by 3/2,<br>> 5/4...27/16....3645/2048...etc., the amount of decimal places obviously<br>> varies. <br>> <br>> Ultimately, you have to use your ears. If you hear beating/phasing between<br>> a<br>> given pair of frequencies, then something's off. <br>> <br>Could you give me a rough figure in terms of Hertz/CPS or even beats per<br>minute/hour/day/year/millenium?  :-)  I realize the issue with beating, but<br>not everyone doing just intonation feels you need 100% beatless harmonies,<br>especially if one is doing band/orchestral type music.  This question is<br>open to all list members using synthesizers/samplers:  how much pitch<br>resolution does your own music need?<br><br>>  To answer your second question, yes, I am talking - at least in my case -<br>> about sustained tones. But I suppose that it goes, for me, beyond what one<br>> can<br>> get "away with" regarding tuning. It is true that tuning errors are more<br>> obvious in "slower" music, but isn't that the crux of the issue? Play ANY<br>> music fast enough and I suppose the errors become negligible. 12et was,<br>> and<br>> is, consider close enough to JI for most people. I presume the the main<br>> reason<br>> for this forum is to explore the alternatives to the alternatives<br>> regarding<br>> pitch and to not accept what is given as gospel whether tuning systems or<br>> hardware. Perhaps I was a bit contentious in my original post, but I was<br>> hoping to find out how others feel about this particular issue, and more<br>> importantly, if and how anyone is, in fact, going beyond what the<br>> synthesizer<br>> manufacturers are saying is good enough.  <br>> <br>Synthesizer manufacturers say 1 cent resolution is good enough because:<br>1.  They don't understand the concepts of just intonation very well and...<br>2.  No one has ever quantified what tuning resolution is good enough.  I've<br>heard many times that 1 cent resolution is poor, but I've never heard in<br>terms of cents or Hertz what _was sufficient.  If .003 Hz is what it takes<br>to make someone happy, then I suggest a system like Kyma, as mass market<br>manufacturers are unlikely to implement so fine a resolution.  However, if<br>0.1 or 0.05 Hz is good enough for microtonalists and current technology is<br>0.5 Hz resolution, then synthesizer manufacturers may be willing to improve<br>their systems to that extent and we have something to work with.<br><br>> From: Paul Hahn <Paul-Hahn@library.wustl.edu><br>> <br>> > If this is the case then why are there so many complaints about<br>> synthesizer<br>> > 1 cent tuning accuracy when acoustic musicians can't do any better?<br>> <br>> Because pianos, organs, and harpsichords can do _much_ better.<br>> <br>What is the best resolution one can expect, either in terms of cents or<br>Hertz?<br><br>> From: mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)<br>> <br>> >If this is the case then why are there so many complaints about<br>> synthesizer<br>> >1 cent tuning accuracy when acoustic musicians can't do any better?<br>> <br>>    Well, we're clearly asking for more than you can realistically expect<br>> of<br>> a human performer (on an indefinite-pitched instrument that is).

Therefore, the result of the analysis will be that the<br>frequencies are slightly altered, usually both upwards and downwards<br>simultaneously, so that interference can simulate the changes in<br>amplitude. (Try it!) However, as the ear can only resolve one pitch<br>within each critical bandwidth (and there are nerve-firing periodicities<br>which supplement the cochlear mechanisms), it will indeed be able to<br>interpret the signal as having harmonic partials of changing amplitudes.<br>I'm not saying that one interpretation or the other is more correct; the<br>problem of describing a waveform as a sum of frequencies each of whose<br>amplitude changes over time has many equally valid solutions. I'm saying<br>that the solution relevant for how we hear the tones and how dissonance<br>might arise with other tones is, in most cases, one where the partials<br>are harmonic and of changing amplitude.

Even without the rest of the instrument to<br>dictate where the fundamental will resonate with a minimum of input<br>energy, the mouthpieces of these instruments can be used to create a<br>musical tone with harmonic overtones (albeit highly variable overall<br>pitch). The timbre of instruments, as I'm sure you know, is highly<br>dependent on the ability of the instrument to resonate at harmonic<br>overtones of a given resonance. This is becuase the lips/reed are highly<br>non-linear, creating a host of harmonic overtones along with the<br>sinusoudal fundamental that a simple Bernoulli model would predict. Now<br>the extent of this non-linearity is dependent on the physical<br>characteristics of the reed/lips, which can be constantly altered by the<br>player, even if he/she is not meaning to do so. Hence the amplitude of<br>the partials can vary, sometimes wildly, rendering the waveform<br>aperiodic.

Even valve horns rarely play the<br>>fundamental for this reason.<br>>                  Graham Breed<br><br>This is another case of confusing the modes of resonance with the<br>spectrum of an actual tone. The former is not a harmonic series but<br>depends on the shape of the instrument. Good brass makers sacrifice the<br>first resonance so that the others can come close to a harmonic series.<br>Still, the lowest resonances are typically dozens of cents off a<br>harmonic series. But the tone itself contains exactly harmonic partials.<br>If you don't believe me, read Dave HIll's recent post, where he found<br>that brass partials are a fraction of a cent off of harmonic, which is<br>far less than the dozen cent type errors in the lowest modes of<br>resonance. Even if you don't believe that Dave Hill's methodology led to<br>the errors of a fraction of a cent, clearly the modes of resonance and<br>the spectrum of a played tone are clearly two different things.<br><br>The reason the "fundamental," or more precisely the lowest resonant<br>mode, isn't used by horn players is that none of its harmonic overtones<br>coincide with resonances of the instrument. Hence mode-locking can't<br>occur, and a steady tone can't be produced, let alone one with a nice<br>timbre. A different, quiet "fundamental" can, however, be played by a<br>skilled lipper, which is of the "subharmonic" variety: The harmonic<br>overtones are engaging the resonances of the instrument, keeping the<br>lips vibrating in a steady pattern, while the fundamental is far from<br>the lowest resonance and is only weakly amplified at best.</div><h3><a id=7578 href="#7578">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.

The people advocating<br>really exact JI really need to think about this:<br><br>For an interval in perfect just intontation, whatever phase difference<br>was present at the beginning of the sound would persist for the duration<br>of the sound. Let's say two instruments are producing tones, both of<br>which have an equally loud partial at 1000Hz. For someone standing in a<br>particular location with respect to the two instruments, there is some<br>delay time between the beginning times of the two instruments for which<br>the 1000Hz components will interefere constructively, resulting in four<br>times the energy at that frequency than what one instrument alone would<br>produce. For a delay time just 1/2000 of a second longer, you get<br>destructive interference, or no energy at that frequency. Obviously no<br>human instrumentalist can control their onset time to within 1/2000 of a<br>second relative to the onset time of another instrument. So you end up<br>with a random number between zero and four to describe the energy of the<br>1000Hz component -- probably not the musical effect you were looking<br>for. Even an individual performer playing both instruments can't do it<br>-- try tuning two synth keys to the same note and notice how repeatedly<br>playing both keys "simultaneously" leads to random fluctuations in the<br>loudness.<br><br>Now if the onset times are controlled really accurately by MIDI, and<br>let's say a 90-degree phase shift is chosen so that the energy at 1000Hz<br>is twice that from one instrument, then you're doing okay, right? But<br>for someone standing in a different location in the room, though, the<br>differece in the path lengths from the two instruments, and thus the<br>phase, will be different. There are nodes of destructive interference<br>and antinodes of constructive interference in the room no matter what<br>the original phase shift was. So some members of the audience may be<br>receiving no energy at 1000Hz, while others may be receiving four times<br>what they would from one instrument. Again, probably not the effect you<br>were looking for.<br><br>If both instruments are electronic, and their signals are mixed into one<br>speaker, there will be no spatial nodes or antinodes. So finally you can<br>control the musical effect. But other than monophonic electronic<br>MIDI-sequenced music, perfect JI can lead to big problems. In the real<br>world, thankfully, acoustic instruments are slightly out-of-tune with<br>each other, so that whatever the onset delay and whatever the position<br>in the room, one gets a signal that frequencies common to both tones<br>have an average energy twice that of one instrument. There will not be<br>noticeable, let alone startling, differences in the musical effect<br>depending on minute variations in the onset delay or position in the<br>room.<br><br>></div><h3><a id=7599 href="#7599">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.

This is another probably<br>undesirable musical effect. Add more tones to the chord and the<br>potential for cancellations increases. Thus I must conclude that under<br>no circumstances is exact JI desirable, unless all tones are played<br>through one loudspeaker and one exerts full control of the phases of all<br>partials of all tones so as to eliminate anomalous interference. (Tones<br>sound quite similar, but not exactly the same, when the relative phases<br>of the partials are messed with; the characteristic "brassiness" of<br>brass instruments is due in some part to the sharp spikes in the<br>waveform which Gary mentioned.)</div>
