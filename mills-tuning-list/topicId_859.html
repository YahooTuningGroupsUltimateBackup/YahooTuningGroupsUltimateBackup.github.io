IW composed with traditional<br>instruments. The most "unusual" instruments are Ondes Martenot or Balalaika (opus 27).<br>He has learned to play Balalaika when he was in Russia, with a gardener, beside the "watch"<br>of his mother (That's what he said in his memories- unpublished). IW have leaved St Petersbourg<br>the 9 march 1920 with his family.<br>In his work, he used violin (with 1/3, 1/4, 1/6, 1/8 ton - e.g. Opus 6), cello (with 1/3, 1/4,<br>and 1/6 tone - e.g. Opus 7), pianos (with 1/4, 1/3, 1/6 and 1/12 tone - many many opus),<br>string quartet (with 1/4 tones), Ondes Martenot and a piece for Adriaan Fokker 's organ <br>in 31-tet).<br>In 1920, IW wanted to build a piano in 1/4-tones. He went to the Pleyel factory in Paris.<br>They decided to build a piano with "transmission pneumatique". In 1921, IW received this <br>piano. But he was not satisfied. He want a "real piano" in 1/4 tone (He said "real" piano <br>in his memories). He asked Straube factory to build for him a Moelledorf's harmonium and<br>decided to go to Germany. In Germany, (where he stay from 25 january 1922 to 10 february)<br>he met W. Moellendorf, R. Stein, A. Haba and J. Mager. They discussed how to make a 1/4-tone<br>piano. IW returned in Germany and stayed a long time (26 July 1922- 4 april 1923). He met <br>Grotian-Steinweg factory and August Foerster factory. The Grotian-Steinweg factory was <br>ready to build a new instrument but they and IW was not agree on how to make it. <br>So, when IW came <br>back in France on April 1923, no instrument were planed. Alois Haba, who leaved in Germany,<br>met Gehrard F"orster, and decided to build a 1/4-tone piano with 3 manuals as IW highly<br>recommanded it. In 1924, Alois Haba had his new instrument. Latter, in 1927, IW asked <br>Foerster to build a 1/4-tone piano. In 1929 the piano arrived to Paris. (It is now in<br>the Museum at La Vilette, Cite des Sciences et de la Musique, Paris).<br>IW had made many experiments on his piano but in 1936 he thought that it was better to<br>tune two pianos (one normally, the second a 1/4 tone higher) to produce quarter tones<br>three pianos (one normally, a piano a 1/3 tone higher, another piano a 1/3 tone lower) to<br>produce 1/3 tone, and so on... for 1/6 and 1/12 tones. At that time, he revised all his scores<br>and writed again his scores for n-pianos. He thought that it was more easily to have a<br>specific tuning on a traditionnal piano than to move a 1/4-tone piano (which need to be tuned<br>again).<br><br>After 1936, IW never think of new instruments in 1/n - tones. In his writings, he said that<br>the problem of instruments factory will be solved by a new concept the "instrument mecanique".<br>He writed music for the instruments of his friends. <br>Some piece for the Julian Carrillo pianos (opus 44 and 48) and  a piece for the Adriaan <br>Fokker's organ in 1959 (opus 42).<br>Julian Carrillo (1875-1965) had made 15 "pianos metamorfoseadores" : One in 1/3-tone, another <br>in 1/4-tone, another in 1/5-tone,etc... a last one in 1/16-tone.<br>These pianos are a traditionnal pianos but some strings are changed in order <br>to be able to have a tuning in 1/3, 1/4, ... 1/16 tone. In 1/16, you<br>have only one octave tune in 1/16-tone. The pianos have been build by the Sauter Compagny <br>and was exposed in Paris in 1955 and in Bruxelles (Belgian) at the Exposition Universelle<br>in 1958. You could see this pianos in Mexico. JC had given the 1/3-tone piano and the <br>1/16-tone piano to Jean-Etienne Marie. They are at the Cite des Sciences. Martine Joste<br>and Sylvaine Billier played on this pianos.<br><br><br>At the opposite, Alois Haba dreamed of a new orchestra with new 1/n-tones instruments. <br>In 1924, AH asked the Kohlert factory to build for him three clarinet in 1/4-tones on a <br>design of Richard Stein. <br>He used clarinet in 1/4-tone in <br>	opus 24 : Suite # 1, for 1/4-tone clarinet and piano, 1925<br>	opus 35 : Die Mutter Opera, 1929-1930<br>	opus 55 : Suite, for 1/4-tone clarinet, 1943<br>AH also contacted Friedrich A. Heckel Factory (at Dresde) and asked them to build 2 trompets<br>in 1/4-tone with chromatic valves.<br>He used this trompett in :<br>	opus 56 : Suite, pour trompette et trombone, 1943<br>AH has also asked for a 1/4-tone guitar. He used it in : <br>	opus 51 : Kinderstimmingen, 8 compositions for voice and guitar, 1938-1942<br>	opus 53 : Poesie des Lebens, 12 lieder for soprano and guitar, 1943<br>	opus 54 : Suite for guitar, 1943<br>	opus 63 : Suite for guitar, 1946<br>In 1939, Foerster had build a 1/6-tone harmonium. He had write his opus 37 before to have this<br>instrument :<br>	opus 37 : Sechs Kompositionen, for 1/6-tone harmonium, 1929-1930.<br>Also, AH used traditionnal instruments (violin, alto, cello and contrebasse) to produce<br>micro-intervals. In particular, the opus 98 String quartet # 16 was written for 1/5-tone<br>in 1967. (AH had written no other piece in 30-tet).<br><br>The AH Instruments are at Prague. You could see some pictures in the Sigrun Schneider 's book.<br><br>--franck<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 15:38 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA31612; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 15:39:59 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA31476<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id GAA29370; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 06:39:56 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 9 Sep 1996 06:39:56 -0700<br>Message-Id: <009A81ECE1F78100.2123@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
