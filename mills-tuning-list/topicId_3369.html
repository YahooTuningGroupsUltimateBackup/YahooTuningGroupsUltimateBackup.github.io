That is 19.5 frets per octave, with a fifth of<br>696.5 cents, so near enough 1/4 comma meantone.  I used mandolin<br>wire for the whole neck and it does just about work.  Maybe a few<br>filed down guitar frets near the nut would have been better.<br><br>It's a lot easier to play for not having a full 31 note scale.<br>I'm glad I ignored that suggestion.  I can play A major with the<br>normal fingering.  It works!  There are also a few 7:9:11 chords<br>which sound good with distortion.<br><br>One problem with the fretting pattern is that I can't play the<br>septimal version of the "Hendrix chord" in Purple Haze.  I have<br>tried tuning the strings down to give both versions proposed. The<br>sound is more like a normal chord, but less like the CD. It does<br>need distortion to sound right, BTW.  Also, Foxy Lady doesn't<br>include a chord like this according to my book.  All the notes are<br>used within a measure, but not at the same time.  This my be a<br>guitar player's chord, but an interpretation from the harmonic<br>series is irrelevant.<br><br><br>                    Graham Breed<br>      gbreed@cix.co.uk        www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/</div>
