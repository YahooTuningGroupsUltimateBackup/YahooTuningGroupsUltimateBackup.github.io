Gilson)</h3><span>1/16/1996 10:02:48 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I was away from home for 2 1/2 weeks and then had to spend a lot of time<br>going through a mountain of accumulated e-mail, so it's only now that I am<br>able to remark about this list, which appeared Dec. 29. I think that it, <br>perhaps expanded to include any more anyone can come up with, is something<br>I've eagerly hoped to see. But a question arises.<br><br>Many of the scales he described are actually defined by just intervals, or as I<br>would prefer to say (since the term "just intonation" frequently means a<br>specific 5-limit scale) rational frequency ratios. I know that Indian and Greek<br>scales are. <br><br>So, since all of Manuel's modes are selections from ET scales, my question is<br>how precisely the given ET scale had to match the interval. While for example<br>an interval of 7/12 of an octave (700 cents or 583.333... moc) is a pretty<br>good fit to a Pythagorean fifth (~702 cents or ~585 moc) we know that an<br>interval of 1/3 of an octave (400 cents or 333.333... moc) is not nearly as<br>good a fit to a just third (~386 cents or ~322 moc). Yet both are often<br>considered as equivalent to the given ratios.<br><br>Obviously they don't match exactly. I know I can't hear a difference of 5 moc,<br>but I am sure I could hear a difference of 20 moc. So it is imoortant to<br>know how close his ET modes are to the named scales.<br><br>                                              Bruce R.
