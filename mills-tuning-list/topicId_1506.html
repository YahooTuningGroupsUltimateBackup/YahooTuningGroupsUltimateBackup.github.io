Unfortunately, I couldn't find an email or<br>postal address for more information on him or his music, much of<br>which has been created in collaboration with Karin Mo"ller.<br> <br>Berg appears to be somewhat of a mystic and is associated with <br>the  Anthroposophy movement of Rudolf Steiner, best known in the<br>States, at least, for their private Waldorf Schools. If anyone knows <br>anything further about Berg and his music, please post it to the <br>Tuning List. <br><br>While Schlesinger's harmoniai may not really have much to do with <br>ancient Greek music, they are fascinating in their own right.<br>The diatonic forms are essentially Utonality (subharmonic) heptads<br>through prime number 13 (including 9), though the hypo modes tend<br>to substitute 15 for 14 (7). The harmoniai are distinguished <br>primarily by the choice of tonic and are modes of each other. <br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 6 Jan 1997 09:09 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02465; Mon, 6 Jan 1997 09:12:53 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02463<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id AAA07879; Mon, 6 Jan 1997 00:12:42 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 6 Jan 1997 00:12:42 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701060312_MC2-E48-44F5@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
