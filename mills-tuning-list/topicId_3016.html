Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/1998 1:34:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I thank Carl for the review, and I will try to respond to some of his<br>contentions.<br>><br>>}What is this Special Way?  Krumhansl, quoted by Mr. Erlich, seems to be<br>>}touching on it: "If chord construction is determined in some principled way<br>>}by scale structure, then this further serves to maintain the tonal<br>>}framework for encoding pitch information."<br>><br>>"Special Way?" You are a Yes fan, you must be a Genesis fan too :)<br>><br>>}Most western classical music happens to work in this Special Way, and the<br>>}thing it uses to do it is the diatonic scale.  Mr. Erlich's goal, if I'm<br>>}not mistaken, is to find a new scale suitable for use in this Special Way.<br>><br>>}To recap so far, I am using "Special Way" to mean a way of explaining<br>>}beauty in music from how melody and harmony are related, a construct<br>>}heretobefore unknown to music theory, at least at the level Mr. Erlich<br>>}takes it.<br>><br>>Wow, I strongly disagree. Virtually every music theorist who does not care<br>>about tuning issues understands harmony in terms of the diatonic scale and<br>>tonal functions. "Functional harmony" -- ring a bell? Unfortunately,<br>>virtually every alternative-tuning theorist does not so understand harmony.<br>>This is unfortunate. It seems that "music theory" is divided into two<br>>schools, and Carl is perhaps only familiar with the alternative-tuning<br>>school. There is much of value in the other school, Carl.<br>><br>>} In his paper, it is called "Generalizing diatonicity".  I<br>>}suggest this is an unfortunate term, as it implies the diatonic scale,<br>>}which is exactly what he wants to replace, kind of how "octave" isn't a<br>>}good way to say "2/1", since it implies 12-tone...<br>><br>>Actually, octave implies a heptatonic scale, not necessarily in 12-tone. But<br>>I don't think I invented the term "diatonicity."<br>><br>}He then defines a set of scales as candidates for representing the<br>7-limit.<br> }These scales are assumed to be root of 2 equal-step tunings, with only<br>one<br>}pitch per 7-limit approximation.<br>><br>>}The one pitch per approximation thing is necessary for the Special Way to<br>>}work, as far as I can tell.  I can't quite tell you how, but I have a gut<br>>}feeling it is, and since the Special Way is what we're after, I won't argue<br>>}it.  Besides, it keeps the size of the pitch set manageable.<br>><br>>I couldn't very well consider every possible tuning system in the paper.<br>>Keeping the pitch set manageable is an important goal. Modulation flexibility<br>>is as well; although I don't mention it in the paper, I assume readers are<br>>familiar with this feature of ETs. However, I leave it to you to prove to<br>>yourself that your gut feeling is correct, or if it is not, and there is a<br>>non-equal-step tuning that satisfies all the properties I list, then we<br>>should know about it!<br>><br>>}The root of 2 part is understandable, considering that we need strong low<br>>}identies for our 7's to work.  This seems contradictory to the rule that<br>>}the higher identities are more sensitive to mistuning, since there are more<br>>}low-numbered fractions near them.<br>><br>>I don't see any contradiction.<br>><br>>}Indeed it is, and perhaps it is a<br>>}counterbalance to this principle.  The paper offers only that "octave<br>>}equivalence seems pervasive" and that it is "universally perceived, even by<br>>}some animals".<br>><br>>That's the key. I did not have room in the paper to consider tempering the<br>>octave, but as you know, I have no objections to doing so.<br>><br>>}The matter of mistuning is far from clear, even touching back on our old<br>>}bone about unknowingly passing low-numbered ratios when measuring cent<br>>}detuning of an interval.  Paul's paper addresses this by making the<br>>}standard deviation in log-frequency detuning inversely proportional to the<br>>}limit of the interval.<br>><br>>That is not correct. I do offer this as an alternative model, but the first<br>>model, in which the standard deviation is constant for all intervals, is the<br>>one which yield the candidate tunings:<br>><br>>}So the list of scales comes down to 22, 26, 27, and 31 tone equal<br>>temperament.<br>><br>>Can you suggest a way to make the paper less confusing on this point?<br>><br>>}..in what would be letter "d", Mr. Erlich makes use of a term I do not<br>>}understand: "characteristic dissonance".  He defines it to be any dissonant<br>>}interval that shares the same number of scale steps as a consonant<br>>}interval.  Shadings of dissonance aside, what kind of scale steps we<br>>}talkin'?  The example of the diminished 5th is given, but why it should be<br>>}considered a type of 5th, or why the P5 should not be considered a 7th is<br>>}not made clear.<br>><br>>Are you serious? Count scale steps. Anyone in a traditional theory class<br>>could answer this blinfolded; perhaps I presumed too much of the traditional<br>>theory background when writing this paper.<br>><br>>By the way, all the numbering and lettering in my paper is screwed up, thanks<br>>to Microsoft.<br>><br>>}So has the paper provided a good definition of the Special Way?  Yes.  Has<br>>}it succeeded in convincing me that the Special Way is still good, and that<br>>}the 22TET decatonic scale is a fresh vehicle for it?  Without a doubt.<br>>}What it hasn't provided is a name for the Special Way.  Maybe "tonality" is<br>>}best, but I didn't use it because it has so many other meanings.<br>><br>>In alternate-tuning land, yes. In traditional theory land, it has a very<br>>specific meaning. Traditional theorists usually think that extending<br>>consonance to the 7-limit means throwing out tonality. I make a case that a<br>>7-limit system of tonality exists.<br>><br>>}Serialism is certainly devoid of the Special Way -- and no doubt there is<br>>}good serialism to be done -- but it is also lacks consonance.<br>><br>>Hmmm. Serialism, and much 12-tone theory, _does_ make a big deal about using<br>>the same pitch sets for melody and harmony. I think 11TET would work much<br>>better for dissonant serialism than 12TET, since 11TET is the most effective<br>>tuning for random dissonance, and 11TET is a subset of 22TET.<br>><br>>}Far out avant garde music is certainly lacking of Special Way, if not other<br>>}things.<br>><br>>And I do love far-out avant garde music like Henry Cow, when I'm in the mood<br>>for it. I love Phish when they go far out, and I think 22TET can take you a<br>>lot farther out than 12TET. But sometimes you just want to listen to<br>>something that "takes you home".<br>><br>>}Indian chamber music and Bagpipe music are good examples, but they stay<br>>}inside one tonality, the fundamental of which is played on a drone.  I love<br>>}them both, and they are extremely consonant, but this is not going to<br>>}satisfy hardcore Special Way fans.<br>><br>>I will admit that the closer you are to JI, as long as major and minor whole<br>>tones are not too different, the better for these styles.<br>><br>>You did not address the rest of my paper, such as my demonstration that 22TET<br>>is virtually the best tuning for the decatonic scales. It may seem circular<br>>since I found the scales in 22TET, but one might have hoped for a better way<br>>of tuning them, which (perhaps unfortunately) does not exist.<br>><br>>Modulatory effects only possible in JI -- can you give a specific example?<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Subject:  new microtonal freeware<br>PostedDate:  09-01-98 00:28:35<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  09-01-98 00:28:09-09-01-98 00:28:11,09-01-98 00:28:05-09-01-98 00:28:05<br>DeliveredDate:  09-01-98 00:28:05<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256586.0080E8DB; Fri, 9 Jan 1998 00:28:31 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA31737; Fri, 9 Jan 1998 00:28:35 +0100<br>Date: Fri, 9 Jan 1998 00:28:35 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA31685<br>Received: (qmail 16842 invoked from network); 8 Jan 1998 15:28:32 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 8 Jan 1998 15:28:32 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.980108161900.23868A-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6991 href="#6991">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Fred Kohler&#x22; &#x3C;Fred_Kohler@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/1998 8:37:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Sorry a thousand apologies about sending a copy of digest 1293 in my last<br>post.
