Could this be the same<br>> thing, Ivor's term for consistency?<br><br>It seems to me what Ivor was getting at was probably the fact that 12<br>has many factors, which allows one to create what theorists call "scales<br>of limited transposition".  E.g. 3 1 3 1 3 1 has only four different<br>transpositions, because transposed by 4 steps it's unchanged.  (You can<br>create such a scale because 4 is a divisor of 12.)  OTOH, in 19TET it's<br>impossible to create such scales, because 19 is prime.<br><br>--pH <manynote@library.wustl.edu> http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote <*><br>    O<br>   /\        "Well, so far, every time I break he runs out.<br>  -\-\-- o    But he's gotta slip up sometime . . .
