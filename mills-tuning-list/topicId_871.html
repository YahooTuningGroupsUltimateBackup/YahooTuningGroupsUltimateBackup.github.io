Frog Peak will produce a CD<br>compilation of these pieces.<br><br>to receive the source material<br>via the internet: A 66 second (about 6 MB) mono, 16-bit, AIFF soundfile may<br>be downloaded from the web at the following sites:<br><br>        http://online.anu.edu.au/ITA/ACAT/tjk/FrogPeak.aiff     (Australia,<br>thanks to Tim Kreger)<br><br>on DAT: Send a DAT tape (15 minute tapes are fine!) to Larry Polansky at<br>(before December 1, 1996) Music Dept., LaTrobe University, Bundoora,<br>Victoria, Australia 3182, or (after December 1, 1996) to Frog Peak Music.<br>Please write "Frog Peak Collaborations," your name and address on the blank<br>DAT, and include return postage.<br><br>Please copy this soundfile and invitation freely to other websites, hard<br>disks and digital media.<br><br>to submit finished pieces<br>Send DAT tapes of (approximately) 1 minute pieces using only this source<br>material to Frog Peak Music.

Please send the complete title of your<br>piece, your correct name and address, and any notes on the piece in<br>electronic format accompanying the DAT (Macintosh preferred).<br><br>We will try to put as many pieces on the CD as we can.

(, a predicate)), an economy of virtual knowns,<br>interrupts the idea of proof (those names of actions and events) that does<br>a shy redundancy, a wave. Looks like a subject, but. I mean, is<br>is-an-emergent-property-of-any-system-the-increasing-probability-of-asking-a<br>-right-question a question (a parasite that adapts) or no, a science of<br>quantity, a legal? And the additions? A function. Of represents.<br>Information after all is that failure of description, an immune system a la<br>consciousnessed, a parody (a typical number (probability is a product of<br>real numbers), a base maybe parity in bags) that dags as some inductive<br>random, a negative it, sit. Like a tautology is a square of the propensity<br>to explain any point-function as (random is just like absence) a factor (D)<br>of phantom flickers, a sort of they-type time (it disappoints (dusts)<br>description) of non-linear possibilities, an avvy quit. Shit. The<br>pragmatics of ignorance - something (decorative) you do on my time (my<br>reduction is smaller than your reduction coz I is a large number) - an<br>abstract that, an example of itself, a me-too no-risk of refers picks up a<br>difference on a stick (difference, the first good) and licks (self-evident<br>(a judgement is a perfect rule)): dear sames, a limbo (game) replica in<br>drag, as names (deduction is the administration of violence (credit is the<br>history (interest) of words without history)): claims it (the altruist) I's<br>about. Conspires. In (surrogate) two's.
