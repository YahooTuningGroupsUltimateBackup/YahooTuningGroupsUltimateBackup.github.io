I first<br>became interested in microtones in 1991 after Perspectives of New Music<br>published its Microtonality Today forum. Since that time I have been<br>gathering information on the various approaches to the use of extended<br>tonality in modern composition. What struck me right off was the magnitude<br>of disparate data AND the seeming absence of a "plain-English" compendium<br>of recent experiments. So, I took a step toward the organization of this<br>"chaos" with a doctoral dissertation that sought to review the theories of<br>Harry Partch, Ben Johnston, Easley Blackwood, and Josef Yasser and to<br>explain their approaches in a detailed, systematic and easy-to-comprehend<br>way.  This document is a step in the right direction but really only<br>summarizes a small portion of the work that has been done toward the<br>expansion of tonality.<br><br>What is needed is a "Harmonielehre," of sorts, that summarizes the most<br>successful experiments with the most compositionally viable intervals (a<br>concept started, but not completed, by Blackwood's Microtonal Etudes, and<br>not unlike Gary Morrison's approach in this forum on the use of 9:7). All<br>this is aimed at reducing the daunting investment of time and energy now<br>required of the composer who wishes to incorporate the systematic use of<br>microtones into their compositional procedure.<br><br>This is important because the common-denominator toward the acceptance of<br>microtones into the modern compositional milieu is familiarity. The more an<br>interval is heard in a musical context, the more likely it is to establish<br>an aesthetic identity leading to the assumption of a musically<br>communicative function. In other words, if more musicians can use<br>microtones, more microtones will be used by musicians. And they will be<br>used for more than simply novel harmonic and melodic gestures, but in a<br>contextually specific and hierarchically mandated way.<br><br>So, as I see it, in order to break us from this chicken-and-the-egg cycle,<br>we must present information in a manner that defines  unknown variables in<br>relation to known variables, and, building on this relationship, is focused<br>on the development of aesthetic criteria for the systematic application of<br>new musical identities. In so doing, we just might fill the "one theory per<br>composer" rut that blocks the path to popular understanding and acceptance<br>of the notion of the expansion of tonality.<br><br>Just my two cents worth. Any thoughts, advice or criticism is greatly<br>appreciated.<br><br>Matt Puzan, D.M.A.<br>puzan@mail.pe.net<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 21 Jan 1996 01:00 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id QAA27703; Sat, 20 Jan 1996 16:00:54 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 20 Jan 1996 16:00:54 -0800<br>Message-Id: <960120234425_71670.2576_HHB63-9@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
