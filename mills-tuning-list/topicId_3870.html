If the ear<br>were really very sensitive to wave shape, one would hear the sound of a<br>piano or guitar or plucked bass string as continually changing in<br>timbre; the inharmonic partials can be interpreted as harmonic ones<br>whose phases are drifting relative to one another. Perhaps in some<br>subtle sense the timbre of these instruments does continually change,<br>and perhaps that's why these are my favorite instruments to play, but<br>the difference between these sounds and resynthesized versions with<br>exactly harmonic partials (with _any_ relative phases) is subtle enough<br>so that one can say the the amplitudes of the Fourier decomposition are<br>primary, and the shape of the wave secondary, in describing the timbre<br>of the wave. In fact, it is my understanding that the BBE<br>sound-enhancing hardware works by applying different phase shifts to all<br>frequencies, so as to eliminate peaks in the total waveform that at loud<br>volumes could cause distortion in amplifiers, speakers, and the human<br>ear, while preserving the amplitudes of all components. If the shape of<br>the wave were very important to musical effect, this procedure could<br>hardly be called sound-enhancing!<br><br>I just picked up a copy of the 1997 edition of Manfred R. Schroeder's<br>_Number Theory in Science and Communication_ -- another tour-de-force by<br>him for those who like mathematics but dislike formal proofs -- and the<br>introduction to chapter 28 asks the question, "For a given amplitude<br>spectrum (_magnitudes_ of Fourier transform coefficients), how does one<br>choose the _phase angles_ of the Fourier coefficients in order to<br>achieve the smallest range of magnitudes in the corresponding inverse<br>Fourier transform [i.e. in the resynthesized wave - PE]?" Although he<br>does not mention BBE, he is addressing essentially the same issue (and<br>uses Galois sequences to do it).<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1487<br>*************************</div>
