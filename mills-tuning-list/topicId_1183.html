Just tuning of course <br>would require vastly more keys, assuming it could be considered a <br>satisfactory tuning (which I don't happen to believe).<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 18 Nov 1996 18:07 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA16383; Mon, 18 Nov 1996 18:08:20 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA16546<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA02356; Mon, 18 Nov 1996 09:08:16 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 18 Nov 1996 09:08:16 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01510100aeb5d26df409@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
