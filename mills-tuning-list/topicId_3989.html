Erv Wilson devised a good notation system<br>for the diamond that I will post as soon as possible. As Wolf has a<br>great understanding of Partchs works, I feel that it isn't as easy as he<br>makes it sound to transcribe these works . On looking at Castor and<br>Pollux much of the Kithara parts are completely outside the diamond with<br>the I or sub I being the only tones in the 43 tone scale. With these<br>instruments Harmonic and subharmonic hexads exist on any of the 43 tone<br>scale. There is also the problem of the notated note compared to the<br>perceived note as with the cloud chamber bowls. Those that have worked<br>with any timbre with strong inharmonic partials are amazed with the<br>changes of sounds in different environments( figure-ground phenomenon)<br>and Partch ear was always his guide. These are just two problems.<br>    Personally I feel the publishing of these scores besides offer a<br>great insight into the extraordinary ear of Harry Partch will also<br>result  in an slew of bastardized performances. This has already been<br>the case! (no names). The performance of these works on anything besides<br>the original instruments ( or replicas) falls into this category. There<br>is also the context in which these works are presented. To present these<br>works alongside the sloppy intoned clusters of the likes of Ligeti ( who<br>recently thought to throw in a few octarooni  as a tribute to Partch) is<br>like reading Sandanista Poetry at a republican  convention. Partch drew<br>a line in the sand and the avant-garde attempt to "assimilate" of him<br>reminds me of China's method of conquering the mongol hordes (Disney is<br>falling for this one as we speak!).<br>    So much is determined by beginnings (Take western doctors, who will<br>always be part grave robbers!) Just as in this case, there will  be the<br>dreamers that remain, there will<br>be  the bitterness that remains. We should be hesitant to write off this<br>bitterness  in some pseudo Freudian explanation. Like depression, our<br>society is uncomfortable with such emotions. Look at all the varied<br>forms of chemical or electrical lobotomy at hand to avoid any such<br>"reflections. Yet it is this very soil out of which new growth takes<br>place, in Partchs case, unique beauty (the first time I've seen that<br>word here!).<br>I digress to return. There is a tendency to see music as an<br>"evolutionary" process where  music has  gradually evolved (logically)<br>out of the previous. But could we not as easily explain logically Bach<br>following Mozart as an increase of complexity for instance. Beside that<br>point, many seem to think that mirotonality will evolve  gradually out<br>of the present mainstream. Partch took instead a quantum leap perhaps<br>knowing that western music like its religions have grown by "schisms" of<br>abrupt change. It is perhaps of this necessity of a true change that<br>caused his spirit (and bitterness) of non compromise. He understood the<br>strength of his enemy (and they were and still are his enemy) and he<br>struck as hard as he could. Show no quarter!!!!<br>The childless blob of  the sterile avant garde hybrids are now after<br>Partch! What they could not defeat with artistic worth they try by<br>dilution, "bestowing recognition", association, and assimilation. Its an<br>old trick, like the Academy Awards hurriedly giving Fellini an<br>"honorary" award before his death. Don't accept these horses from troy<br>blocking our way in and out of Gate 5.

The fifths<br>C-G-D-A-E and B-F# are each tempered 1/5 Pythagorean comma, and all<br>other fifths are just.  (The same fifths are tempered in Kirnberger III,<br>only by different amounts.)  I'm skeptical about the beat rates being<br>special in any perceptible way, however.  The idea that the temperament<br>was encoded in JSB's seal (another of Kellner's claims) also seems<br>dubious to me, although my reading of Kellner is sketchy--most of what I<br>know is secondhand.  I'd like to know more, though--it may be he has<br>better supporting arguments than I know of.
