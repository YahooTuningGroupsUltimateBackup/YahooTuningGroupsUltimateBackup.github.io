This may be a guitar<br>> player's chord, but an interpretation from the<br>> harmonic series is irrelevant.<br> <br>A result of the debate between Paul Erlich and I (and<br>others on the Tuning List) over this chord is that<br>I've written a piece based on it.<br><br>It explores lots of different rational interpretations<br>of this chord, guided by the concept that conceivably<br>(although with much difficulty) a guitarist could<br>play the chord in 12-eq as:<br><br>2^0 : 2^(16/12) : 2^(22/12) : 2^(27/12)<br><br>then apply bending to the strings independently<br>to arrive at one of the various just-intonation<br>interpretations.<br><br>I've sequenced it on my computer to acheive<br>accurate intonation, and if it _can_ be played<br>on guitar, I suppose it would qualify as a <br>virtuosic exercise in finger independence<br>and ear training.<br><br>Anyway, the version of the chord with the<br>proportions 6 : 15 : 21 : 28 (ratios of<br>1/1 : 5/2 : 7/2 : 7/3 -- the analysis which<br>Erlich argued would be more appropriate,<br>if it _had_ to be analyzed as ratios) sounds<br>much more like what Hendrix actually<br>played on the album, for the reason stated<br>by Erlich that the 12-eq perfect 4th between<br>the top two notes is very close to the strong<br>ratio 4/3.<br><br>However, the interpretation as 4: 10 : 14 : 19<br>(which I originally stated, and which started the<br>debate) is still the one I like most, especially<br>with the bending.  It has a bluesy, funky sound<br>that I think is beautiful.<br><br>So, as Erlich insisted, what Hendrix played<br>in this chord was really basically 12-eq (although<br>Hendrix  _did_  use a lot of microtonal pitches in<br>his solos), but exploring rational interpretations<br>of ordinary 12-eq chords is, to me, like<br>roaming around in a vast new sonic<br>playground, and any rational interpretation<br>can be fitted to some segment of the harmonic<br>series.  What makes a harmonic-segment<br>analysis relevant to me is that the proportions<br>all relate to each other thru a numerary nexus,<br>thus showing a different kind of relationship<br>that that which can be perceived by using<br>absolute ratio measurements.<br><br>   Joseph L.
