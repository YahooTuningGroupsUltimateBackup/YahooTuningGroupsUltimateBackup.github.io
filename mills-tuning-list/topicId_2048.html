This<br>>  is easier than all that multiplying of fractions you need to work<br>>  with JI -- unless you use ratio space axes.  My point is that<br>>  there's no reason why you can't do all your work in a logarithmic<br>>  scale, and then an ET is the simplest scale to define.  Most of<br>>  the work in microtonality now is done with electronic synthesis<br>>  rather than dividiing up strings.<br><br>I see now that we're on slightly different tracks - the classic situation of<br>two sides that are both right if you consider that they're facing different<br>directions!  I believe that you're talking about the application of a tuning<br>to an instrument, which is decidedly easier with ET, and, some would say, the<br>primary reason that ET was chosen for Western music in the first place.  I'm<br>still stuck on the abstract, theoretical questions.  Like, which ideal tuning<br>goal, if even it could be applied, is most likely to yield melodies and<br>harmonies to which the human body and soul should most readily resonate.<br> It's a sticky question, I know, and maybe founded partly on misconceptions<br>hidden in the depths of my cosmology.  I'm open to that, and open to<br>criticisms on that basis.  So far, it seems to me to be a worthy pursuit.<br> More on this in the next posting.<br><br>>JI comes from the harmonic series, which is a<br>>quantization of linear frequency space.<br><br>Lost ya there.  Doesn't "quantization" denote equal divisions?  E.g., in what<br>sense are the two spaces in 1:1, 9:8, 5:4 equal, or based on equal divisions<br>of linear frequeny space, whatever that means?  Strange as it might seem,<br>after years of picturing frequency space logarithmically, I can't get myself<br>to visualize it linearally - it doesn't seem to make any sense that way.<br><br>David J.
