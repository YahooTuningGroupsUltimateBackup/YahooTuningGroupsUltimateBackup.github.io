How close is close?  <br><br>Does anyone know how these discrepencies affect sympathetic strings?<br><br>Also, looking at good Sitars, I noticed that the sympathetic strings each<br>have their own nut exactly beneath the fret that sounds the note they<br>amplify.  The sympathetic string's bridge is right beneath the main bridge.<br>It seems to me that these SHOULD be the nodal points for that note on the<br>instrument.  I can't imagine the air conducting the sound from one string to<br>the other.  Hundreds of years of design can't be that far wrong.

As a simple experiment, sing into a string <br>> on a guitar, and you can easily set the string to vibrating <br>> (sympathetically) with your voice. <br><br>   In that particular case I'm almost certain that would gets the guitar<br>string to vibrate is the sound waves from your voice vibrating the<br>soundboard, which vibrates the strings.  FAR less, I believe you'll find is<br>a result of the air directly exciting the strings themselves.  <br><br>   Try it with a solid-body guitar on headphones and I'd be surprised if<br>you hear much.  (I've never tried it myself, so I may be surprised as<br>well.)<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 5 Jan 1997 23:19 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02078; Sun, 5 Jan 1997 23:22:36 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02076<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id OAA26527; Sun, 5 Jan 1997 14:22:33 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 5 Jan 1997 14:22:33 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009ADEE6FA1D2760.0639@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
