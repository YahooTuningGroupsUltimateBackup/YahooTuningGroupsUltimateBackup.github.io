Starr says he expects that the units will be available in<br>the Spring for about $3500.<br><br>I suggested to Starr that he include a transparent envelope over the keys<br>like on the Clavette, and he replied that I should talk to Erv Wilson about<br>this, since he's doing it for him.<br><br>I guess Erv is not on this e-mail list, so I'll try to phone him after the noliday weekend. Is his Summer '95 Xenharmonic Directory information valid? If not,<br>could Someone in contact with him send me his current address & phone?<br><br>In all likelihood, I will not continue with my plans to build my <br>"SuperClavette" if Wilson's plan is GO.<br><br>However, many musicians might not be ready to shell out $3500, perhaps<br>even many of you on this list. <br><br>So, please answer me this by direct e-mail:<br><br>Would you personally be interested in a non-velocity sensitive keyboard<br>with 124 keys which would transmit hard-wired MIDI note numbers? If you'd<br>be willing to buy this 'stripped-down' Clavette, what would be the upper<br>limit of what you'd be willing to pay?<br><br>If I get enough responses, I will contact my engineer associates and see if<br>such a thing could be sold out there.<br><br>Personally, I'd rather just get myself a StarrLabs Uath-72 and save myself the<br>trouble of instrument-building, but I would like to see a few more people<br>in the world playing on MIDI generalized keyboards.<br><br>StarrLabs is at http://www.catalog.com/starrlab/<br><br>I'm looking forward to your direct replies.<br><br>Harold Fortuin<br>hfortuin@delphi.com<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 28 Nov 1996 20:34 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11029; Thu, 28 Nov 1996 20:36:16 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11106<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA06455; Thu, 28 Nov 1996 11:36:14 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 28 Nov 1996 11:36:14 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961128193320_74353.1735_HHG57-1@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
