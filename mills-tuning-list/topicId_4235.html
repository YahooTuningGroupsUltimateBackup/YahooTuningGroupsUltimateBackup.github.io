It's already been there for a<br>while (albeit unfinished) for those in the know.<br><br>I've felt for some time that this is one of my<br>most original and important papers.  Apparently<br>everyone else who's discussed Marchetto assumed<br>an equal division of the whole tone into 5 or 9<br>smaller parts (see, for example, Margo Schulter's<br>recent posting here).<br><br>This didn't make sense to me.  A theorist in the<br>early 1300s would have divided intervals arithmetically<br>on a monochord, which gives unequal ratio divisions.<br>This was the point of departure for my analysis.<br><br>These ideas appeared in print originally in a chapter<br>on Marchetto that was in the 1997 draft of my book.<br>(a real collector's item by now -- I think Kyle Gann<br>has the only remaining copy in its original form).<br><br>Well, today John Chalmers tipped me off that the<br>issue of MTO (Music Theory Online) that just got<br>posted today has an article about...<br>you guessed it.  Jay Rahn gives a reading of<br>Marchetto's theory that's pretty much identical<br>to mine.  Incredible timing.<br><br>So, even though there's more to be added to mine,<br>here are both URLs for your reading enjoyment.<br><br>My paper:<br><br>http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/marchet.htm<br><br>The MTO article:<br><br>http://smt.ucsb.edu/cgi-bin/check-browser.pl?rahn+98.4.6<br><br>- Joe Monzo<br>  monz@juno.com<br>  http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html<br><br>___________________________________________________________________<br>You don't need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html<br>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</div><h3><a id=8895 href="#8895">ðŸ”—</a>monz@juno.com</h3><span>11/21/1998 12:47:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Jeff Collins wrote:<br><br>> I am new to this list and have been doing a bit of<br>> lurking around, but today i read a post from Joe Monzo<br>> who mentioned the Subharmonic scale.

I would really appreciate it.<br><br>First, welcome to the List.<br><br>I've decided it would be more fruitful to send this<br>to the List than to you personally.  Perhaps others<br>have comments.<br><br>The "subharmonic scale" can be characterized as a<br>utonal progression, in Partch's terms.  It is the<br>exact inverse of the "harmonic series" of overtones<br>above a fundamental.  In the case of subharmonics,<br>the "fundamental" is the highest note in the series,<br>with the subharmonics in reciprocal integer ratios<br>below it.<br><br>The proportions as we used in our improv were as follows,<br>with pitch progressing from the top down, and with<br>the equivalent "bottom-up" standard terms given for<br>the notes which form the "minor triad":<br><br>1/3  "fundamental"<br>1/4  "5th"<br>1/5  "minor 3rd"<br>1/6  "root"<br>1/7  <br>1/8  "5th"<br>1/9<br>1/10  "minor 3rd"<br>1/11<br>1/12  "root"<br>1/13<br>1/14<br>1/15<br>1/16  "5th"<br>1/17<br>1/18<br>1/19<br>1/20  "minor 3rd"<br>1/21<br>1/22<br>1/23<br>1/24  "root"<br>1/25<br>1/26<br><br>Note that we normally skip the 1/1 and 1/2 as they<br>just produce higher octaves of the top 1/3.  Intervals<br>between notes become progressively smaller as you<br>go down the scale.<br><br>The top note, 1/3, was around 3200 Hz.  Notes below<br>1/16 are progressively smaller "semitones" -- the<br>keyboard tuning went much further than this, but<br>notes near the bottom were quite low in pitch and<br>sounded more like rumbles than clear subharmonics.<br><br>- Joe Monzo<br>  monz@juno.com<br>  http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html<br><br>___________________________________________________________________<br>You don't need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html<br>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</div>
