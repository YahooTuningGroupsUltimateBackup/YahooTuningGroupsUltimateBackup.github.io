Notation for 19 and 31 tET is really<br>simple.<br><br>If you use the Large (L) and small (s) interval patterns.<br><br>One octave is 5 large plus 2 small = 5L+2s<br><br>In 19 equal Large interval (L) is 3/19ths of an octave<br>and small interval (s) is 2/19ths.<br>Therefore 5 Large (*3)= 15/19ths plus 2 small (*2) = 4/19ths = One<br>Octave.<br><br>In 31 equal Large interval is 5/31sts of an octave and small interval is<br>3/31sts.<br>Therefore 5 Large (*5)= 25/31sts plus 2 small (*3) = 6/31sts = One<br>Octave.<br><br>So just like LucyTuning, you can now use conventional notation to<br>describe your music, except that as ET's are circular (instead of<br>spiral),<br>and therefore in 19tET Fb and E#: and Cb and B# will play the same note.<br><br>So in 19tET, the available notes will be:<br>C C# Db D D# Eb E (Fb/E#) F F# Gb G G# Ab A A# Bb B (Cb/B#)<br>and in 31tET, the available notes will be:<br><br>C Dbb C# Db Cx D Ebb D# Eb Dx E Fb E# F Gbb F# Gb Fx<br>G Abb G# Ab Gx A Bbb A# Bb Ax B Cb B#<br>I suggest that you use A4 = 440 Hz as your reference pitch.<br>For more info. see one of our websites<br>http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy<br>http://www.wonderlandinorbit.com/projects/lullaby<br>or http://www.harmonics.com<br>(which is under development)<br><br>They have lotsa<br>LucyTuning info. including free downloadable sample loops.<br><br>lucy@hour.com<br>P.S.  I have examined many of the new notation systems, and have come to<br>the conclusion that the best suggestions to date come from Anne and Bill<br>Collins.<br>Bill is the ASCAP writer of "Without You".<br>They solve many of the<br>shortcomings of conventional notation by using close and wide line spacing<br>on the staves, plus lotsa other "neat" ideas, which enable their system to<br>be "music" rather than instrument biased fingering systems like<br>klavier(sp?).<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  lucy@ilhawaii.net<br>Subject:  http://www.newscientist.com/ns/970809/features.html<br>PostedDate:  08-08-97 04:10:09<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  08-08-97 04:10:12-08-08-97 04:10:12,08-08-97 04:08:41-08-08-97 04:08:42<br>DeliveredDate:  08-08-97 04:08:42<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564ED.000BE8BD; Fri, 8 Aug 1997 04:10:04 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05854; Fri, 8 Aug 1997 04:10:09 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 8 Aug 1997 04:10:09 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05842<br>Received: (qmail 27353 invoked from network); 8 Aug 1997 02:10:01 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 8 Aug 1997 02:10:01 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.BSI.3.91.970807160317.7428A-100000@lehua.ilhawaii.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
