The particular tuning used, however, is probably the least   <br>>>>noticeable of these.  How many people can tell the difference between   <br>>>>12TET and 5-limit JI in a string quartet played with the usual vibrato?<br><br>     I don't know if I can agree with this.    I have never heard a string<br>quartet play in 12 TET. They often say that is what they are doing, but they<br>always fall into a more tonally centered Pythagorean as they play.  Who is<br>going to accept a constant 14 cent wide major3rd everwhere, in all keys, in a<br>string quartet?   If a quartet played in true equal, I don't think the<br>audience would be talking about phrasing when the curtain dropped.  <br>      <br>G.C. again;<br>>In many cases, the most difficult of these considerations for a   <br>>historically informed performer to determine is which tuning the composer   <br>>intended.<br> <br>     I think it is easier to decide on  a musically proper temperament for<br>Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, etal.  than it is to find agreement on phrasing.<br> There are a limited number of temperaments that would have had been<br>available.  Most of them have been written down, debated, buttressed and<br>supported,etc, and since the common forms were near universally shared, with<br>listening, one can usually find the temperament point in the historical line<br>that provides a rendition of a piece that works best, ( from a standpoint of<br>tonality levels). In comparison,  phrasing is poorly described by the written<br>note or word,  it is so  controlled by the human emotion at the time of<br>performance, that written guides are no guarantee of us hearing what the old<br>guys had in mind.  ( OH if somebody could take a small DAT back two hundred<br>years!!)  <br> <br><br>>       But those students you mention are not accepting 12TET -   <br>>they're only accepting that there are 12 notes in an octave, *roughly*   <br>evenly distributed in pitch.  How many of them even know what 12TET is?   <br>> To most of them, "tuning" is a verb, not a noun, and "temperament" is a   <br>>psychological term.<br><br>      Well,  we all have to do our parts if we want to turn this around.  It<br>is changing, I know from the piano technicians list,  that there are many<br>more people promoting choice in tuning today than there was 25 years ago when<br>I began tuning professionally. <br>      I recently completed teaching a course here at Vanderbilt on<br>Intonation, keyboards, and Temperaments, and I had the time to take students<br>from the basic theory of string behavior and overtones, ( with a side order<br>of inharmonicity, they all had tuning hammers!) to the workings of intervals,<br>and basic construction of temperaments. <br>       They responded rather quickly to exposure to pure thirds on the<br>keyboard,  a comment made when the first ET major 3rd went to pure was, "<br>Wow,  that Sounds like Mozart!  It proved to be a "vector" course, in that it<br>helped them grasp much more from a wide variety of courses they were already<br>in.  ( some of the music theory faculty mentioned that they were starting to<br>recognize which students had been in my course by the questions that they<br>were getting from them!.  this is good)<br>      I propose that students, ( like the majority of 20th century<br>listeners), want to hear something other than 12ET,  as it really has been a<br>scientific detour heading for an entropic dead-end. It is an important<br>temperament, but it is not the realized ideal that 18th and 19th century<br>theorists argued,   rather, it has gone from  being a necessary handhold to<br>an artistic snag that we have been hung up on long enough.  When tonal music<br>is played on an atonal tuning,  the color is gone from the picture, the juice<br>is nearly out of the grape, the emotional click track is locked  , the.....<br>ouch! ( metaphors will snap if stretched too far.....)   ah well, talk is<br>cheap, but a good CD will set you back $15.  <br><br>     We just finished the "Beethoven in the Temperaments-Historical tunings<br>on the Modern Concert Grand" CD project here.   Things went well, the dampers<br>were sanded and softened, ( yes, I "voice" dampers for  recording work!), the<br>hammers were in great shape ( to get hammers to "peak", just when you want to<br>record the piano is not always easy to do), and the artist, Enid Katahn was,<br>as we say in Nashville, "totally in the pocket".<br>    We have four big sonatas on the Steinway D tuned in two different well<br>temperaments.  We used the Kirnberger III, ( aka the Prinz to the Jorgensen<br>crowd), for those killer 1/4 comma early keys.  That is a good tuning for the<br>Pathetique,  and the first four chords take you about as far out into the<br>"churn" as you can imagine.  The Op.14 no.1 does a really nice job of showing<br>how Emaj can be used to create an uptempo piece of music.  In fact, the<br>artist chose this one, because it had never been interesting until she played<br>it in a well temperament,  then she felt it was a new piece!<br>     We used the Young ( 1799) for the Moonlight and the Waldstein,  as these<br>pieces felt too harsh in the stronger temperament.......... And that brings<br>me to what I really wanted to talk about:<br><br>   This tuning list seems to be attractive to those of us that are<br>investigating alternatives to the status quo of 12TET,  ( How I do miss<br>McLaren's jousting!!).  Sometimes, sitting here in the warm cyber-glow of the<br>pot-bellied Macintosh, it feels like we are on a temperament crusade.<br>  Amongst ourselves, we find  good reason to lament the public's  seeming<br>indifference to supporting the microtonalist universe. I myself have to just<br>sorta cast off and drift when I hear a lot of "alternative tuning", but I<br>like it because it doesn't "scare" me, though, I wish I had the time to<br>understand what H'stick calls the "math monsters".   It has been pointed out<br>before that micronoodling, and mindless sound in abstruse tunings is<br>counterproductive to the Temperament Crusades.  I suppose, but really can't<br>say. <br>     I can say that there are ways to improve your chances of converting some<br>poor, in-the-dark, 12TET junkie  with a carefully thought out pitch, and<br>there are ways to introduce a listener to alternatives that will turn them<br>off, ( I mean,  I learned in high school that one should get past the first<br>introduction before asking if the cheerleader and her sister wanted to " go<br>get nekkid and drink some beer").  This is equal to hitting somebody first<br>with Beethoven on a meantone tuning.  It will not usually impress anybody,<br>and once turned off by "different tuning" many stay turned off.   <br><br>      There is an adjustment needed for ears accustomed to only 12ET.  The<br>first exposure to key color is often a shock, and the feeling that "something<br>is amiss"  should be expected.  It is on second hearing that the alien nature<br>of tonal contrast is gone, and the composers emotional circuitry really<br>starts to kick in.  <br>      I made this point last year, but since I am sitting here, scandously<br>spending bandwidths and weekends,   I will say it again;<br><br>     If we are to expect students, or anyone else, to leave the security of<br>the familiar, such as 12 TET,  it is easier if we take them first to familiar<br>music played on the unfamiliar tunings, ( as we are going to try in Beethoven<br>in the Temperaments),  than it is to get them to accept new music on new<br>tunings simultaneously..  <br>    <br>  Once a listener hears Beethoven's ( or Bach's)  use of highly tempered<br>intervals contrasted to pure, they are more comfortable with the idea for a<br>wide variety of musical tunings. Hopefully, the temperaments of tomorrow will<br>come from minds that have some historical perspective on what this 12 TET<br>actually sounds like.  You really can't explain to a fish that it is wet,<br>until you take it out of the water. The difference between knowing only one<br>temperament and knowing two, is greater than the difference between knowing<br>two and knowing twenty.  <br>       Since taking that first step away from a supposedly  "secure"  place<br>is difficult for many musicians, ( especially those that have invested their<br>lives in ET), it behooves all of us to be aware of the special needs of the<br>neophyte, and perhaps not give them the strongest medicine first when<br>introducing the tonic of tonality   ( was that a musical pun, or what?)<br><br>     And I gotta say, this list has about the best signal to noise ratio of<br>any I am on.  Thanks to everybody for that.  <br><br>   <br>Regards, <br>Ed Foote <br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn. <br><br>     <br> <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 9 Jun 1997 10:14 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29197; Mon, 9 Jun 1997 10:14:56 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 9 Jun 1997 10:14:56 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29211<br>Received: (qmail 25445 invoked from network); 7 Jun 1997 15:17:11 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 7 Jun 1997 15:17:11 -0000<br>Message-Id: <15234934552999@cybersim.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
