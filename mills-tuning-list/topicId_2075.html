I must thank <br>the late Larry Hanson for the financial support which made this possible, <br>and John Starrett for a great job on the instrument itself. Between <br>Starrett and myself we now have: 34 tone electric guitar/bass, 34 <br>acoustic guitar/bass, 19 tone electric and acoustic guitar/bass, 31 tone <br>electric, and a fretless guitar as well. Upcoming projects are a 31 <br>acoustic guitar/bass, and a fretless acoustic. I believe Paul Erlich now <br>has his 22 tone guitar, so I would be interested to see what he comes up <br>with...again, Hanson needs much thanks, because he believed enough in his <br>dreams to make them a reality...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 20 May 1997 10:41 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05885; Tue, 20 May 1997 10:41:42 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 20 May 1997 10:41:42 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05878<br>Received: (qmail 10429 invoked from network); 20 May 1997 08:41:38 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 20 May 1997 08:41:38 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199705200428_MC2-16F0-C3F2@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
