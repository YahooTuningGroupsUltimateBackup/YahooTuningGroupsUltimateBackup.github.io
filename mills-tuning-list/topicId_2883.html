See<br>>}if you can find a consonant third, four fifths above the tonic. If you<br>>}cannot (and you cannot) your arguments fall to the ground. I repeat =<br>that<br>>}when I was a beginner, I made the same mistake you are making.=20<br>><br>>which proves that you don't have an inkling of what my "arguments" are,<br>>although I have evidently presented them with enough clarity so that =<br>Graham<br>>Breed, Paul Hahn, and Steven Rezsutek have understood them.<br>><br>>}1. Fokker's method is as I have stated. Read the references for<br>>}yourself. If you do not have access to Fokker's original texts, use<br>>}Mandelbaum.<br>><br>>I have not been able to gain access to Mandelbaum's writings, or to the<br>>particular ones of Fokker in question. Believe me I have tried to read =<br>every<br>>shred of tuning-related literature, including the Yale, Harvard, NYU, =<br>and NY<br>>Public libraries, partly in an attempt to see if anyone had discovered =<br>the<br>>decatonic scales before me. Surprisingly, no one has, as far as I know.<br>>However, since the issue is mathematical, not historical, we need not =<br>appeal<br>>to the literature. If Fokker was using a convenient approximation to<br>>illustrate a point, so be it, but we can still do better. I have other<br>>disagreements with Fokker, such as his use of square rather than =<br>triangular<br>>lattices, as well as his use of 31-equal to represent ratios of odd =<br>numbers<br>>(such as 13) that are not consistently expressed by the tuning.<br>>=20<br>>}2. Fokker could have used _no_ method to achieve equal weighting of<br>>}deviations of the consonances.<br>><br>>Excuse me, but did you not say in the above that you were treating the<br>>consonances as equally important, and therefore taking an average of =<br>the<br>>figures?<br>><br>>}The most _basic_ principle of<br>>}temperament, which is taught to all _beginners_ in this discipline, is<br>>}that there can be _no_ temperament which compromises the consonances<br>>}equally.<br>><br>>Of course, one cannot make all the errors equal, but one can make them<br>>equally important in determining a temperament.<br>><br>>}This arises from the mathematics of the case. _Learn_<br>>}mathematics before you make such statements, which again, only show =<br>your<br>>}ignorance.<br>><br>>}Now that I have administered the bitter pill, let me add a large<br>>}tablespoon of sugar. You are quite bright. You were led into this =<br>faulty<br>>}conclusion by assuming that the consonances are independent, and so,<br>>}vary independently when tempered. I use non-mathematical language here<br>>}deliberately. But in fact the consonances consist of three pairs, 5:4 =<br>&<br>>}8:5, 6:5 & 5:3, and 3:2 & 4:3, each of which pair varies as if it were =<br>a<br>>}single interval, so far as temperaments are concerned. Therefore, to<br>>}seek some system which shall weight deviations from the consonances<br>>}equally, even in the case in which the octave is itself tempered, is =<br>the<br>>}classic pons asinorum of temperament, for no such system can exist.<br>><br>>Again, _you_ were the one who attempted to weight the deviations =<br>equally,<br>>which is a perfectly fine thing to attempt to do. I simply pointed out =<br>that<br>>you did not do so correctly. If you wish, I will go through the math =<br>and show<br>>that you did not find the optimal octave for your initial example. Your =<br>error<br>>propagates through your other refinements and the fact that we arrive =<br>at a<br>>similar value for the optimal 19-tone octave (1202.7 cents) is either =<br>sheer<br>>coincidence or evidence that both of us were listening.<br>><br>>}Finally, let me observe that the value of 1202.7 cents for the octave,<br>>}while apparently very precise, and possibly indicative that one person<br>>}may have copied the other without acknowledgement,<br>><br>>That is so absurd as to be laughable. I calculated that number for the =<br>first<br>>time just before I posted it, and I clearly indicated its derivation, =<br>which<br>>again is quite different than yours.=20<br>><br>>}> > Gregg Gibson is posting such a lot of highly opinionated material,<br>>}> > it is difficult not to join in the argument.<br>>bil said:<br>>}> Or wish my mailer had a filter function -- such a flood of junk.<br>><br>>}For those who have been eager to attack me as uncivil, I give this as =<br>an<br>>}example of true incivility. It is not uncivil to say a tuning is =<br>without<br>>}value.<br>><br>>Imagine telling an oboist that the oboe is a worthless instrument. If =<br>that<br>>were a civil thing to say, you wouldn't need to protect yourself from =<br>an<br>>incoming double reed. To describe yourslef as "meekly humble" only =<br>shows that<br>>you are hiding behind the impersonal screen of the Internet while =<br>firing off<br>>your insulting material. Evidently you find my tone objectionable as =<br>well --<br>>I'd be happy to just discuss tuning and not make personal remarks, if =<br>only<br>>you'd attempt to understand, rather than dismiss as beneath your<br>>consideration, the counterarguments that I and others offer.<br>><br>>}As I have abundantly shown in previous posts, this temperament (and<br>>}analogous ones such as 29- 41- & 53-tone equal,) is impossible for the<br>>}diatonic, as well as for the chromatic modes (see the four chromatic<br>>}modal genera or scales I have contributed; these include several of =<br>the<br>>}forms of the 'minor' of the West) which obviously require thirds and<br>>}sixths vis-=E0-vis the tonic, it being granted that the fifth and/or<br>>}fourth must also be present.=20<br>><br>>On the contrary, you have not shown anything, while I have shown that =<br>three<br>>of your four "chromatic" genera are indeed adequately represented in<br>>non-meantone temperaments.<br>><br>>}The case of the enharmonic is less clear-cut, and requires more =<br>detailed<br>>}consideration. For after all, one might ask, surely the divers<br>>}enharmonic modes have fewer thirds or sixths vis-=E0-vis the tonic, =<br>and so<br>>}the inconsistency between the fifth cycle and those of the thirds =<br>would<br>>}appear to be less troublesome; in certain enharmonic modes it might<br>>}never arise at all.=20<br>><br>>That's right -- just as it never arises in three of your four =<br>"chromatic"<br>>genera.<br>><br>>}For example, take one form of the enharmonic:<br>>}C  C#  Db  F  G  G#  Ab  C  (not the 22-tone equal notation)<br>>}or in 22-tone equal:<br>>}0  55  109  491  709  764  818  1200<br>><br>>}There is a consonant major third between Db & F, and another between =<br>Ab<br>>}& C, and a consonant minor third between F & Ab.=20<br>><br>>}In reality, of course, the notation of the 22-tone differs from the<br>>}above notation:<br>>}C  Db  B#  F  G  Ab  Fx  C<br>>}which BTW is not a mere artefact of notation, but on the contrary<br>>}explains very succinctly the utterly non-diatonic and non-chromatic<br>>}nature of this system,<br>><br>>Which is why I would use a decatonic rather than heptatonic notation =<br>for<br>>22-equal.<br>><br>>}The effect of this particular Greek enharmonic mode - the most famous =<br>of<br>>}them as I recollect - is in 22-tone not wholly dissimilar to its =<br>effect<br>>}in 19-tone equal, except that the latter is much more singable because<br>>}of the wider 63.3 cent interval.<br>><br>>But which is closer to the ancient Greek tuning of this mode?<br>><br>>}Other enharmonic modes in 22-tone equal such as:<br>>}C  D  D#  F  G  G#  Ab  C    (not 22-tone equal notation)<br>>}0  218  273  491  709  764  818  1200<br>>}have problems however. Here D-F is dissonant, and this would tend to<br>>}disagregate the already weak tonality of the enharmonic. If D is =<br>lowered<br>>}to make D-F consonant, D-G becomes dissonant. This is similar to the<br>>}break in the fifths that besets just intonation itself. This is not a<br>>}trivial matter; it is very noticeable to the ear.<br>><br>>Does this mode have any practical or theoretical importance?<br>><br>>}The difference of 9 cents between<br>>}54.5 and 63.3 cents is very important, because it occurs near the<br>>}melodic threshold or limen of perception.<br>><br>>So if you go down 54 cents, and then up 63 cents, you've gone down an<br>>imperceptible interval, and then up a perceptible interval, so you're =<br>up a<br>>perceptible interval. Therefore, 9 cents is a perceptible melodic =<br>interval by<br>>your logic. You see why we don't think your limen makes much sense? =<br>Context<br>>and training are far more important for what can or cannot be =<br>distinguished<br>>in melody than any precise cents value.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
