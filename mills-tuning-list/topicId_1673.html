However, Rudolf has been busy with other things in recent years<br>and hasn't issued much material, also due to some expenses involved. <br><br>The good news is that he will soon resume publication, probably within the<br>next year in all three series. I have been his assistant editor since<br>1988: that is my chief connection with Diapason Press. I encourage list<br>members to become acquainted with the series, perhaps by visiting a<br>library which has some (I know, this is impossible for many people), and<br>supporting them with purchases, either directly or indirectly via a<br>library. There is truly valuable material available here. <br><br>Because there is no web site for Diapason yet (one is planned), I will<br>list what's been published if enough people are interested. (But I have<br>only a week to do this, because I will be going away for a bit.) Further<br>information on prices, etc., could come later from various sources.<br>American and other foreign distribution is planned. <br><br>The more material Rudolf sells, the more he can print. Meanwhile, rest <br>assured that I receive no monetary benefit from any of this. The only <br>"benefit" to me is more work, which in this cause I will gladly take on <br>when I can.<br><br>I spent a pleasant few days with Rudolf two weeks ago in which he<br>explained his plans to me. I think they are very much worth supporting.<br>Any opinions out there? <br><br>     <br>Dr. Paul Rapoport               e-mail:	rapoport@mcmaster.ca<br>SADM (Music)	                   tel: (+1) 905 529 7070, ext. 2 4217<br>McMaster University                fax: (+1) 905 527 6793<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 16 Feb 1997 05:12 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07614; Sun, 16 Feb 1997 05:12:06 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07607<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id UAA09982; Sat, 15 Feb 1997 20:10:29 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 20:10:29 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.464664@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4806 href="#4806">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MorriSonics@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/1997 7:08:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> No, harmonics from physical sources such as flutes and oboes and<br>> bells are not integrally separated.

For very long, thin strings they come close, but normally the<br>higher partials are slightly sharper than the harmonic ratios. This is<br>due (mainly) to the finite bending stiffness of the string at the ends.<br>This is particularly noticeable in small pianos. In such pianos the<br>'octaves' are usually tuned a little sharp so that the first overtone<br>of one string does not beat with the string that is (approximately) one<br>octave higher. People say that the effect is smaller on grand pianos,<br>because the strings are much longer, but I have never done any<br>experiments. On the few harpsichords I have looked at, the overtones<br>were very close to being harmonic.<br><br>Bowed strings are quite different. The stick-slip action of the bow is<br>usually (very close to) periodic, and as Fourier's theorem tells you,<br>the components of a periodic function are harmonic. One can take a very<br>inharmonic string (e.g. attach a small weight to it) and then bow it<br>carefully and produce a spectrum whose components are as harmonic as<br>you can measure.<br><br>In wind instruments, the reed, the player's lips or the air-jet take<br>the role of the bow and produce a periodic function. So in steady state<br>the components of these instruments are harmonic, even though the<br>resonances of the instrument may not be. Ask a beginning flute player<br>to play two notes an octave apart, and you'll be surprised at the<br>interval that results. But look at or listen to the components of the<br>lower note, and you'll find that they are as harmonic as you can<br>measure.<br><br>Note the point about steady state: only a periodic wave that is of<br>infinite duration has exactly periodic components. In practice, most<br>string and wind instruments only play notes for say 10s or so, so you<br>cannot measure the frequencies more accurately than 0-.1 Hz. And<br>usually the players will add some vibrato as well. So, as in every<br>other branch of science, you can never say that the results accord<br>exactly with the theory, because you can never make measurements with<br>infinite accuracy.<br><br>But, to the accuracy of your ears, or of a spectrum analyser running<br>over a few seconds, the components of a steadily bowed string or<br>steadily blown wind instrument are harmonic.<br><br>Plucked strings are not harmonic, and noticeably so in  many cases such<br>as pianos. Percussion instruments (you mention bells) have components<br>that depart even further from harmonic ratios.<br><br>Joe Wolfe, Physics, UNSW, Sydney<br><br>------------end crosspost from alt.sci.physics.acoustics----------<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 17 Feb 1997 00:52 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08138; Mon, 17 Feb 1997 00:52:08 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08131<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id PAA17349; Sun, 16 Feb 1997 15:50:10 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 16 Feb 1997 15:50:10 -0800<br>Message-Id: <33079B04.2A64@ix.netcom.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4814 href="#4814">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MorriSonics@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/1997 8:52:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> Plucked strings are not harmonic, and noticeably so in  many cases such<br>> as pianos. Percussion instruments (you mention bells) have components<br>> that depart even further from harmonic ratios.<br><br>   Uhmmm...  Well, that may perhaps be true of SOME plucked strings, maybe<br>perhaps violin or viola pizzicato.  But I don't think the same can be said<br>for many, and possibly the majority, of plucked strings, including 'cello<br>and bass viol pizzicato and guitar.  <br><br>   I say that because I personally have decomposed and then additively<br>resynthesized those tones with partials forced to be strictly harmonic. <br>What ever would posess me to do that?  Because for a long time that's all<br>my program would do (analyze down to the nearest strict harmonic).  I had a<br>regular test suite of about two hundred woodwind, brass, orchestral and<br>plucked-string, bell, piano, pipe organ, wood-bar, and metal-bar<br>instruments, and timpani.  I ran those sounds through the program<br>frequently as I developed it.<br><br>   It's very easy to hear that, in being forced to strict harmonics, the<br>strings (excluding the high register of the piano), woodwinds, and brass<br>suffered only slightly, whereas the characters of the those percussion<br>instruments, were vastly altered.  <br><br>   The enormity of the difference for the strings (including the plucked<br>strings), woodwinds and brasses I would characterize as slightly greater<br>than the sort of thing that distinguishes a bad guitar (for example) from a<br>good guitar.  <br><br>   Another way to characterize the difference is that the unaltered and<br>pure-harmonic tones were nearly indistinguishable from each other on the<br>Mac's built-in speaker, although the strictly harmonic timbres had a<br>crusty, buzzy, robotic quality when played back over big speakers in<br>44.1KHz 16-bit stereo.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 17 Feb 1997 08:17 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08286; Mon, 17 Feb 1997 08:17:35 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08280<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id XAA01368; Sun, 16 Feb 1997 23:15:22 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 16 Feb 1997 23:15:22 -0800<br>Message-Id: <33080319.630F@ix.netcom.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
