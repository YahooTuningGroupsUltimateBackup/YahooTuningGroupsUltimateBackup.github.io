These would, though, require tedious calculation on a<br>> case-by-case basis.  It would be an interesting exercise to determine <br>> if the Partch scale is sufficiently self-similar to use this technique.)<br><br>The answer is yes. One can easily determine this with Scala. Do<br>   load partch_43<br>   show transpose<br>It shows how many notes are different for each transposition. Look at<br>the second amount which shows how many are different regardless of<br>degree order. If we take Brian's upper limit of 17 notes per channel<br>then we are looking for a transposition with about 43-17& notes<br>different. Candidates are 7 and 12 with 25 and 14 with 27. Let's take<br>7 (10/9). Then we do <br>   copy 0 1<br>   key 7<br>   intersect 1<br>   show/line<br>and we get this scale<br> 81/80 21/20 16/15 11/10 9/8 6/5 9/7 4/3 27/20 7/5 3/2 8/5 18/11 27/16 12/7<br> 16/9 9/5 2/1<br>Midi channel 1 then gets a pitch bend of 10/9 182.4 cents.<br>With some more manipulation we determine which pitches still have to<br>be done: <br> 33/32 12/11 8/7 14/11 21/16 11/8 16/11 32/21 11/7 7/4 11/6 64/33<br>That's only twelve, with one note per channel there would be enough<br>channels left. Some can be grouped together like the ones with 11 in<br>the numerator, another group with 11 in the denominator, etc. But how<br>to get a minimum amount of channels in general could indeed be <br>somewhat tedious. If you settle for a smaller range than that of the<br>piano it can be less.<br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 20 Dec 1996 15:59 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14672; Fri, 20 Dec 1996 16:02:16 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14665<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id HAA20657; Fri, 20 Dec 1996 07:02:13 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 20 Dec 1996 07:02:13 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612200959_MC1-D78-53D@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
