In my own work,<br>I do indeed use a  calculator with a ln/exp key and I recommend that<br>everybody else do too for accurate calculations of cents. However, if one <br>is ever stuck with only a four-function device, usefully accurate<br>approximations to cents are still relatively easy to compute. I find this <br>fact quite remarkable and very non-intuitive, so I decided to share it <br>with the List. <br> <br>I found the approximation for ln[(x-e)/(x+e)] in Rektorys's "Survey of <br>Applicable Mathematics." Without this background, Ellis's procedure is<br>very mysterious and thus easy to ignore in favor of logs. BTW, has <br>anyone looked up Ellis's and Sauveur's papers on this topic?<br> <br>Of course, if one is using JI, then simply memorizing the cent values of <br>a small set of key intervals such as 3/2, 5/4, 7/4, 11/8, 13/8, etc.  <br>would be sufficient. <br> <br>--John<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 18 Mar 1996 18:00 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA14053; Mon, 18 Mar 1996 08:59:56 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 18 Mar 1996 08:59:56 -0800<br>Message-Id: <9603181654.AA27877@ravel.theo-physik.uni-kiel.de><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
