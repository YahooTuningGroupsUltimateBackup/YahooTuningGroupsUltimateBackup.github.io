I'd be happy to continue discussing those issues<br>if you are so inclined. But I'd like to understand this question:<br><br>>Now, does anyone know of a 2-D approximation (linear<br>>temperament) that covers 22tet?  Approximating the<br>>enharmonic diesis (7 0 -3)H and syntonic comma (-4 4 -1)H<br>>to be equal doesn't work.  If it did, it would cover 12, 22,<br>>34 and 46tet.  It is, incidentally, significant that these<br>>are all even numbers.<br><br>I would appreciate some clarification here, as I'm not sure what this<br>question means. However, I'll take a stab at it. In the ancient Hindu<br>sruti system, the syntonic comma (-4 4 -1) is reckoned as one sruti,<br>while the interval 2048/2025 (is that a diaskhisma?) is zero srutis.<br>That last interval is (11 -4 -2)H, I believe. Does that "work" (and does<br>this help to explain why 22 was usually chosen as the total number of<br>srutis)?<br><br>I like to see 22tet in 3-D. Take the 7:5 and 10:7 to be equal, and<br>temper the fifths upwards by about 1/4 septimal comma so that four of<br>them make close to a just 9:7. Voila, 22tet.<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Denis.Atadan@mvs.udel.edu<br>Subject:  Tape Swap Participants<br>PostedDate:  19-08-97 22:49:22<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  19-08-97 22:49:27-19-08-97 22:49:28,19-08-97 22:47:25-19-08-97 22:47:25<br>DeliveredDate:  19-08-97 22:47:25<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564F8.00726213; Tue, 19 Aug 1997 22:49:22 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02115; Tue, 19 Aug 1997 22:49:22 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 19 Aug 1997 22:49:22 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02110<br>Received: (qmail 27839 invoked from network); 19 Aug 1997 20:49:11 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 19 Aug 1997 20:49:11 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199708192004.QAA05119@copland.udel.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
