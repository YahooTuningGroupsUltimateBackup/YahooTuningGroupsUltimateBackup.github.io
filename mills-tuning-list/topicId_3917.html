I think<br>> the King Crimson album "Thrakattak" has some of that stuff too. <br><br>You got to see P2?  Lucky you -- I doubt any of these Projeckt shows will<br>be coming to Minneapolis...<br><br>I have wondered about Adrian Belew's disc The Guitar as Orchestra -- it is<br>all MIDI guitar stuff too.  Much of it sounds wildly non-12et, but I wonder<br>if there is any system to it at all, or just random bending in all<br>directions.<br><br><br>>What I<br>> would love to hear is Fripp & Co. strap on some microtonal axes and try<br>> writing some genuine prog-metal riffs with purer as well as smaller<br>> intervals -- Fripp is always pushing the boundaries of tonality, so it<br>> seems like a logical step . . . <br><br>I have daydreamed about these possibilities as well.  Even more, I would<br>love to hear the League of Crafty Guitarists playing refretted acoustics.<br><br>>I can report that power chords (open<br>> fifths with distorition) on the 22-tone guitar sound great despite being<br>> 7 cents [sharp], and any three-or-more-note subset of a "dominant ninth"<br>> chord (0 7 13 18 26 in 22-tET) sounds really good with distortion, much<br>> more reminiscent of Jon Catler's JI guitar than of standard 12-tone . .<br><br>FYI-  I will report more when completed, but... I now have collected all my<br>supplies and will be refretting my Stratocaster to 22ET in the near future.<br> New parenthood status is (rightfully) monopolizing most of our time at<br>home, but one of these Saturday afternoons I'll get a few hours free to<br>hack away.<br><br>How are you tuning the strings on your 22ET guitar?<br><br>kp</div>
