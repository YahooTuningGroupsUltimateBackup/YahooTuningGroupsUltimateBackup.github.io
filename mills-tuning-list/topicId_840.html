I won't respond to all of <br>Brian's points, because most of them either clarify the matter or allow <br>the reader to choose how to proceed.<br><br>Much of this may be about different ways to structure and use ETs. I <br>think really that you may use many of them differently. Clearly the <br>closer you want to derive from Pythagorean principles, the closer the <br>notation may resemble the traditional one. But it is certainly true that <br>using only sharps and flats in 19 may mislead people who are used to 12 <br>and are unable to make the switch. I have seen it happen so often that I <br>wonder if it ever *doesn't* happen with untutored performers.<br><br>On the other hand, presenting most performers with a radically different <br>notation carries obvious problems of its own. There seems no "solution" <br>here independent of many other variables and contexts.<br><br>I am indeed interested in "wild" notations which capture unique aspects <br>of tunings. I don't happen to have invented any, but I've certainly read <br>through a fair number. There's still time...<br><br>Brian's claim that "when faced with anything other than an<br>ultra-conservative completely common-practice-period notation, Paul's<br>interest appears to drop drastically" is odd. His recollection of our one<br>meeting in 1992 certainly isn't mine. I have spent a lot of time teaching<br>fairly far-out music with bizarre notations or no notation in music<br>history surveys and seminars for nearly 20 years. Recall the discussions<br>about John cage...Again, if anyone cares, please don't take pars pro toto.<br>If you have read my articles written mostly about notations derived from<br>the common practice period, don't assume that that's all I accept. Of <br>course few have read them as carefully as Brian, but that's a different <br>point.<br><br>I am intrigued by turning the "essentially no one attends live concerts" <br>point into a question of ratios. Of course far more people listen to <br>recordings and the like, but that answers a different question. It's <br>rather like saying that essentially no one lives in New York because <br>there are several billion Chinese on the other side of the planet!<br><br>Blackwood does more than create music in Pythagorean frameworks. Several<br>of his pieces derive modes of various kinds which don't relate to Pyth.<br>thinking any more than Messiaen's modes do. <br><br>And that is probably enough. Except to say that Brian's carefully thought <br>out and written ideas are a pleasure to read. For me, anyhow.<br><br>==========================      =================================<br>Dr. Paul Rapoport               e-mail:	rapoport@mcmaster.ca<br>SADM (Music)	                   tel: (+1) 905 529 7070, ext. 2 4217<br>McMaster University                fax: (+1) 905 527 6793<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 6 Sep 1996 06:09 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA23573; Fri, 6 Sep 1996 06:10:55 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA23469<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA10031; Thu, 5 Sep 1996 21:10:53 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 5 Sep 1996 21:10:53 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960906040828_71670.2576_HHB45-5@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
