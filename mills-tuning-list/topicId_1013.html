However, I have been unable<br>to find any errors in my values for tempered fifths. I have taken<br>each of my fifths and computed the beat rates for the P5,P4, TM,<br>Tm, SxM and Sxm and my values are equal when they should be and<br>Manuel's are not for the cases I've had time to examine. <br><br>I presume the problem lies in our algorithms as the errors are for the<br>most part in the 4th and higher significant figures. I used a commercial <br>Math package (circa 1987) and the Newton-Raphson method to solve the <br>4th and higher order polynomial equations for the values of the <br>temperers. These equations were based on Rasch's formulae, but I checked <br>the beat <br>rates with my own formulae based on the lowest common partials. So,<br>I'm puzzled. <br><br><br>--John <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 19 Oct 1996 01:06 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03093; Sat, 19 Oct 1996 01:08:41 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03176<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id QAA20952; Fri, 18 Oct 1996 16:08:38 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 18 Oct 1996 16:08:38 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.961018155042.1210B-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3812 href="#3812">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/1996 3:05:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I just received a brochure and program from Sonja A.
