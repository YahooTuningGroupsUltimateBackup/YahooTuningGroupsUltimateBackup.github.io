Genius, no-genius -- doesn't<br>matter: just go on to the next tune...<br><br>Even having played in the Ensemble for years, it still surprised even me how<br>much people at the concerts *did* like the Partch works -- I actually always<br>expected more listeners to be at least uncomfortable.  Didn't happen, and I<br>can't say that with most of the contemporary stuff I've played.  Though it<br>may not happen for you, I will say that a key factor has to be a live<br>performance.  Seems like after that people can return to recordings more easily.<br><br>No matter, though.  There's more good music out there (some yet to be<br>written/played/improvised) than you or I will have time to hear.  BTW, is<br>Muddy Waters OK in your book? <g><br><br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br>*--------------------------------------------------------------------*<br>   Jonathan M.
