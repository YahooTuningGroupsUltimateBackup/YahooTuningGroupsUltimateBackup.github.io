He is the foremost tuning<br>theorist at work in the U.S. and probably<br>the world, and he has pushed ji scale<br>construction significantly beyond Partch's<br>crucial insight of the tonality diamond<br>(an insight first gleaned by Augusto Novaro<br>in 1927, true--but Partch carried out the<br>full implications of the diamond, which Novaro<br>never did, to my knowledge.  Partch built<br>instruments and compositions embodying the<br>diamond.  Novaro did not).<br>Tenney's and Johnston's main claim to fame is <br>that they supposedly introduced the idea of ratio<br>space into ji music; but since Adriaan Fokker<br>actually introduced 3-D ratio space in his book <br>"Just Intonation and the Combination of Harmonic<br>Diatonic Melodic Blocks," The Hague: Martinus<br>Nijhoff, 1949 and specifically presented a ratio-<br>sapce lattice in his 1951 article "31 Tone<br>Temperament," Tenney and Johnston in fact<br>contributed relatively little to post-Partch<br>JI *theory.* (Their *musical* accomplishments <br>are an entirely different matter, of course.)<br>Erv Wilson took the idea behind the tonality<br>diamond--a 2-dimensional permutational<br>method of generating ji arrays which was<br>self-limiting and self-coherent--and he<br>extended the idea into n dimensions.  Wilson<br>CPSs are N-dimenional permutational methods<br>of generating ji arrays.  Like the tonality<br>diamond method, Wilson CPSs produce ji arrays <br>which  inherently limit  the number of scale<br>pitches (thus solving one of just intonation's<br>greatest potential problems....where do you<br>stop when building a ji scale?) and produced<br>a rich emergent order (in Partch's case, <br>utonalities and otonalities and the possibility<br>of taking N-limit chords in two different<br>senses; in Erv's CPS case many different types<br>of "x"-tonalities with the possibility of<br>taking N-limit chords in many different senses,<br>depending on whether the CPS is stellated,<br>whether its facets are inverted, etc., etc.).<br>For an article which bears on post-Partch<br>theoretical extensions of ji, see <br>"Changing the Metaphor: Ratios  in the<br>Music of Partch, Tenney and Johnston" by<br>Bob Gilmore in Vol. 39, Nos. 1&2 of <br>Perspectives of New Music, 1995.<br>In terms of instrument-building, yes, Gary<br>Morrison is exactly right that Cris Forster is<br>probably the finest ji instrument builder<br>alive and likely an even better instrument<br>builder than Partch ever was.  Alas, like Partch,<br>Forster is hard to get along with.  Unlike<br>Partch, he has done his utmost to make sure that<br>no one gets to hear his remarkable instruments.<br>In terms of performance, Johnny Reinhard and<br>Jonathan Szanto and Dean Drummond and the<br>rest of the people making Partchian music are<br>Partch's heirs.  No doubt this includes myself<br>and Jonathan Glasier, inasmuch as we performed<br>in Partch 43-tone monophonic fabric in our<br>most recent Sonic Arts Gallery concert but one.<br>--<br>In Topic 1 of Digest 821 Paul Erlich wrote that<br>when it occurs in the context of a 4:5:6:7 chord<br>the seventh is consonant, while if it occurs<br>in a diatonic scale with six consonant triads,<br>it is dissonant.<br>Paul's statement builds on Kami Rousseau's<br>query as to what to make of the seventh.<br>This is an old old old old old controversy,<br>and methinks we shan't solve it here. <br>For an interesting theoretical discussion of<br>seven ratios & various 7-commas for aug 6ths,<br>see "The Number Seven In the Theory of<br>Intonation," Eric Regener, Journal of Music<br>Theory, Vol. 19, 1975, pp. 140-153.<br>The best discussion of 7 ratios re: the history<br>of music remains Martin Vogel's 1955 German-<br>language PhD thesis "Zahl Sieben in der Spekul-<br>ativen Musiktheorie."  Hard to get hold of and<br>harder to plow through, alas.<br>Lippius and Zarlino militantly contended<br>that the just seventh was a consonance,<br>while Prosdocimus and Tinctoris contended<br>with equal vehemence that it was a dissonance.<br>We don't know what Aristoxenos or the<br>Pythaogrean thought, but we can guess:<br>since the 7:4 could not be found in the sacred<br>tetraktys, the Pythagoreans would have classed<br>it as a dissonance, while Artistoxenos with<br>full confidence in his ears might well have<br>classed the just seventh as a consonance.<br>The controversy continued into the 18th<br>century.  Helmholtz contended 7/4 it was<br>a consonance, while Riemann and<br>Schenker treated it as a dissonance.<br>There is a precedent for such theoretical<br>confusion over how to classify a musical<br>interval.  The fourth was classified in<br>Boethius' day as "an imperfect perfect<br>consonance."  <br>The just seventh would appear to fall<br>into the same category: depending on<br>context, it can function as either a<br>consonance or a dissonance.  For example,<br>the bare 7/6 by itself is often heard as<br>a dissonance in lower registers; as the<br>just 7th of a 4:5:6:7 chord whose root<br>is above about 1500 Hz, the seventh is<br>usually heard as a very smooth consonance.<br>There is a psychoacoustic reason for this<br>which might prove of interest:<br>The interval between the 6th and 7th<br>members of the harmonic series falls just<br>barely within the width of the critical<br>band above 500 Hz.  This means that at<br>low fundametal frequencies the 7/6 will<br>be heard as dissonant because most of<br>the harmonic partials of the harmonic<br>series timbres will interfere within <br>the critical band, and many of them will<br>interfere within 1/4 of the critical<br>band, producing sensory dissonance <br>according to Plomp & Levelt's & Kameoka<br>& Kuriyagawa's definition.<br>However, if the fundamental is above 1500<br>Hz, then the harmonics of a timbre which<br>sits at an interval of 7:4 above 2000 Hz very<br>quickly exceed the range of audibility.  If <br>the fundamental of a 4:5:6:7 chord is 2000 Hz,<br>then the fundamental of the timbre which<br>plays at a 7:4 to 2000 Hz is 3500 Hz.  If the<br>limit of pitch discrimination is 17 khz (mine is),<br>and the limit of audibility 19 khz (mine is), then<br>all harmonics above the 5th of the timbre <br>which sits a 7:4 above the fundamental of the<br>4:5:6:7 chord will beat supersonically.  That is,<br>the component sine waves will be above the<br>range of audibility and thus their beats will<br>be a matter of little concern since the sine<br>waves themselves are too high to be heard.<br>(Beats are periodic fluctuations in the loudness<br>of periodic signals.  If a sine wave above the<br>range of audibility varies periodically in<br>loudness, it is a matter of little concern,<br>since regardless how loud or soft the sine<br>wave, it cannot be heard.)<br>This explains from a psychoacoustic standpoint<br>the long-standing controversy over the just 7th.<br>When played in a high register, the 7:4 exhibits<br>sensory consonance.  When played in a low<br>register, the 7:4 exhibit sensory dissonance.<br>The just seventh interval is therefore unique<br>in that its consonance depends crucially on <br>the range in which it is played. (Other intervals<br>can be made into sensory consonances if<br>played at very high frequencies, but<br>the 7:6 is unique in that its width nearly <br>matches that of the critical band.  Thus it<br>is uniquely sensitive to the exact position<br>in the frequency spectrum at which it is<br>played.)<br>The question of the musical consonance<br>(and of the musical concordance) of the just<br>seventh is an entirely different question,<br>and one about which there has been at least<br>as much controversy.<br>Alas, to date no one has yet come up with a<br>convincing theory of basing tunings on just<br>sevenths. It simply takes too many of them<br>to produce small intervals with sensory<br>consonance, and thus 7-commas and 7-ratio<br>scale pitches tend to have enormous numerators<br>and denominators...destroying the theoretic<br>advantages of tuning the 7-ratio just.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 17:37 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04317; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 17:38:53 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04352<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA11477; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 08:38:50 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 11 Nov 1996 08:38:50 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.961111082428.2158J-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
