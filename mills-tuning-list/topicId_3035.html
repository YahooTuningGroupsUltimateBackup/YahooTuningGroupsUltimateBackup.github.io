Or am being very thick?<br>>[Loffink, John]  I agree.  1) and 4) seem to be at odds with one another.<br>>Graham, on 3), do you need to transpose by octaves to get the full playable<br>>range of more-than-12 note octaves, or do you need microtonal transpositions?<br>> Most synths should already be capable of the former.<br>><br>>General question: How essential is it to differentiate between<br>>sampler and synth 'wish lists'?<br>>[Loffink, John]  This is not necessary at all.  The limitation is the<br>>software code inside each unit and the manufacturer's unwillingnesss to<br>>expend the effort to implement microtuning.<br>><br>>>I guess I'm confused whether you want more "Partials" to accomplish<br>>>microtonal scales or better sampling.<br>><br>>I want 1) more partials and 2) a way of dealing with them so that a<br>>patch ('instrument') can be set up easily.  For example, suppose<br>>you've got a set of 36 samples, one for each (12-ET) note of a three<br>>octave range (say, of bowed violin strokes). And you want to 'build a<br>>violin' in 22-ET (or something) over 3 octaves.  Imagine this: select<br>>range of samples (Sample Number 0-35); select range of partials<br>>(Keygroups)  0-65 (3 octaves in 22-ET); select source tuning type<br>>(12-ET); select destination tuning type (22-ET); select preferred<br>>deviation (ie., whether sampler chooses nearest sample to map from<br>>above or below desired destination frequency range - preferably from<br>>above, so destination is not 'mickey mouse' );   press GO.  Sampler<br>>creates 66 partials, maps samples 0-35 to said 66 partials, and<br>>retunes accordingly.  Impossible?<br>><br>>[Loffink, John]  You want to map 12TET sample sets to nTET sample sets.  Of<br>>course what you suggest is not impossible.  My point is that it is not<br>>necessary to do this by using more "Partials" (I hate Roland's usage of that<br>>term, which is why I always put it in quotes) or zones if the instrument<br>>supports microtuning tables.  The microtuning table, if implemented properly,<br>>will do the mapping for you, automatically, without all the recompilation and<br>>excessive memory usage.  Granted, you will not have precise control at a less<br>>than semitone level of how the samples are mapped, but is this really<br>>necessary?  You will get "mickey mouse" effects no matter where your base<br>>sample was recorded at, this is the effect of shifting the formant (fixed<br>>resonant) frequencies of the sample.<br>><br>>Increasing the number of "Partials" will not solve your problem, because<br>>you'll have a new one -- the sampler's internal RAM will not have enough<br>>storage to handle the increase.  Program parameters are most likely to be<br>>stored in 64K to 512K local RAM inside the unit, not your 32M to 128M sample<br>>RAM.  If you now ask manufacturers to increase the local RAM just for<br>>microtonal support, I can tell you that none of them will do it because that<br>>increases the price of the hardware.<br>><br>>I'm sorry if this is getting too technical again, but you can't really<br>>understand the ramifications of your requests without a little understanding<br>>on how today's synthesizers and samplers work.  My points are 1) for<br>>microtonal scales to be implemented in mass produced instruments it must be<br>>economically realistic for the manufacturers to do so, and 2) for microtonal<br>>scales to be used by non-specialists it must be as easy as possible for them<br>>to be changed.  You can't accomplish either of these by defining microtonal<br>>scales at the "Partial" or zone level.<br>><br>John Loffink<br>john.loffink@compaq.com<br>><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Subject:  b5th ratios<br>PostedDate:  12-01-98 21:33:55<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  12-01-98 21:34:20-12-01-98 21:34:21,12-01-98 21:34:10-12-01-98 21:34:10<br>DeliveredDate:  12-01-98 21:34:10<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125658A.0071009F; Mon, 12 Jan 1998 21:34:46 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18058; Mon, 12 Jan 1998 21:34:56 +0100<br>Received: from yalta.NL.net by ns (smtpxd); id XA18021<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu ([144.91.3.20]:14418 "HELO ella.mills.edu" ident: "TIMEDOUT") by <br>yalta.NL.net with SMTP id <5147-2135>; Mon, 12 Jan 1998 21:33:55 +0100<br>Received: (qmail 22708 invoked from network); 12 Jan 1998 12:32:02 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 12 Jan 1998 12:32:02 -0800<br>Message-Id: <34BA85A5.74B9@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=7023 href="#7023">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.
