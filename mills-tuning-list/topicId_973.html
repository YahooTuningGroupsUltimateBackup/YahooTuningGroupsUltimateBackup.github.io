The _experiment_ tested how the tastes<br>of Carlsberg Lager and Carlsberg Elephant beer were affected by sound:<br>_Certain tones produced no effect on the tastes of the beers, but when the<br>relationship occurred, i.e., when the tone was at the particular pitch<br>cited (650 Hz for the Elephant beer, 10-15 Hz for the lager), the beer<br>tasted distinctly better._<br><br>Lawrence Wechsler (in _Seeing is Forgetting The Name of the Thing One<br>Sees_) states the result slightly differently:<br><br>_...they were able to confirm that Carlsberg Elephant Beer tastes best when<br>drunk within the aural context of a particular tone (650 Hz) and that<br>varying that pitch only slightly renders the brew almost undrinkable._<br><br>I look forward to hearing of any further confirmations of this experimental<br>data. The Carlsberg brewery assures me that there have been no substantial<br>changes in their product since 1968.<br><br>Daniel Wolf/Material Press/Frankfurt<br><br>http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/DJWOLF_MATERIAL/mphome.htm <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 6 Oct 1996 17:30 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA23028; Sun, 6 Oct 1996 16:31:29 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22290<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA05619; Sun, 6 Oct 1996 08:31:21 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 6 Oct 1996 08:31:21 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199610061529.LAA16621@copland.udel.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3733 href="#3733">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/1996 11:02:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> Actually i believe that the Kurzweil k2000 and the new k2500 have the <br>> ability to have each individual key tuned to whatever pitch you need. [...] <br>> it is however a tedious process to retune the kurzweil. <br><br>   According to a friend who has a K2500, the process of tuning it completely<br>arbitrarily comes down to assigning a separate (I don't know the Kurzweil<br>terminology, be the Ensoniq term is "wavesample") to every single key on the<br>keyboard, and individually tuning each wavesample to the desired pitch.  That as<br>opposed to allowing each wavesample span across several keys as usual, and<br>having a pitch table adjust the pitches, as you can do on Ensoniq machines and a<br>mere handful of others.  <br><br>   I understand though that somebody markets a program to help K2x00 users in<br>performing this sort of retuning process.  I believe it runs on the Mac.  <br><br>   Now I'm not suggesting by any means that the K2x00 is a bad instrument.  It's<br>a very powerful machine, but it's apparently not optimized for unusual tunings.<br><br><br>   As I've mentioned before though, I do have a gripe about the Ensoniq scheme:<br>Which wavesample it plays is based upon key number alone, instead of the pitch<br>that the pitch table defines the key to.  (This, I believe at least, is not true<br>of their "synth" line, but only their sampler line.)  So, if you load up a<br>tuning table that makes an octave span across a significantly larger number of<br>keys than 12, the lower keys sound squeeky and the upper keys sound groggy.  You<br>have to redistribute the split-points between wavesamples for some tunings.<br>(But that is still a lot easier than on the K2x00, and in many cases you don't<br>have to do it at all.)<br><br>   There is of course a potential problem with having tuning tables<br>automatically move the wavesample split points, which is that it can wreak havoc<br>with "mapped" instruments like drum sounds for example.  The answer of course is<br>to make that an option, or far better still, to allow the user to define regions<br>of the keyboard to which you independently apply the effects of the pitch table.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 6 Oct 1996 20:26 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA24221; Sun, 6 Oct 1996 19:27:54 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA24283<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA06523; Sun, 6 Oct 1996 11:27:49 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 6 Oct 1996 11:27:49 -0700<br>Message-Id: <9610061125.ZM14279@frollo><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
