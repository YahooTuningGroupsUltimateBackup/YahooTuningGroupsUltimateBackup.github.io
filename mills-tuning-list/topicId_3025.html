You have 31/16, and, by implication<br>its inversion 32/31, but 33/32 is only 1 cent off, and is already present<br>in the distance between the 4/3 and the 11/8 (or 3/2 and 16/11). Likewise<br>40/33, while a couple of cents further off than 23/19 that you use, also<br>uses this interval down from the 5/4. A 25/22 (11/10 down from 5/4) is just<br>2 cents worse than your 17/15. While the 600 cent interval is always a<br>problem in low limit JIs, 99/70 (7/6 down from 33/20), though not exactly a<br>pretty ratio, nails it. Here are my suggestions in your format, with<br>inversions filled in:<br><br>> 1- 55   33/32 (1)<br>> 2- 109  16/15 (3)<br>> 3- 164  11/10 (1)<br>> 4- 218  25/22 (3)<br>> 5- 273  7/6   (6)<br>> 6- 327  40/33 (6)<br>> 7- 382  5/4   (4)<br>> 8- 436  9/7   (1)<br>> 9- 491  4/3   (7)<br>>10- 545  11/8  (6)<br>>11- 600  99/70 (0)<br>>12- 655  16/11 (6)<br>>13- 709  3/2   (7)<br>>14- 764  14/9  (1)<br>>15- 818  8/5   (4)<br>>16- 873  33/20 (6)<br>>17- 927  12/7  (6)<br>>18- 982  44/25 (3)<br>>19- 1036 20/11 (1)<br>>20- 1091 15/8  (3)<br>>21- 1145 64/33 (0)<br>>22- 1200 2/1   (0)<br><br>I understand that you may be using different criteria for your<br>approximations, so I just offer these as another possible interpretation<br>and look forward to your paper.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.

Vanishing<br>septimal commas is a difficult trick to pull off.<br><br>The octave is the best interval to define a harmonic scale around.<br>Once you've done that, the octave should be very accurate.<br>Although you should think about the octaves, it would be annoying<br>if "the same" chords in different registers were out of tune with<br>each other.<br><br>I tend to think that low primes should be tuned best.  The more<br>complex harmony you use, though, the more accuracy is required<br>for _all_ intervals.<br><br>Carl Lumma wrote:<br><br>> It just stands to reason that there are all kinds<br>> of effects, probably most of them un-discovered, based on the "anomalies"<br>> of JI.<br><br>Remember that there are a lot of temperaments out there!  Most of<br>what you can do in JI should work schismically, as all the commas<br>are there.<br><br>> 1) Conventional theory is full of holes.  The tritone is spelled as an<br>> augmented forth in certain contexts, and as a diminished fifth in others,<br>> but it's the same pitch.  All the enharmonics should be thrown out in 12.<br><br>No, the tritone is not always the same pitch.  It can be 7/5, 10/7,<br>25/18 or 36/25. The first two do not arise in a diatonic context.<br>So, 25/18 is an augmented fourth and 36/25 a diminished fifth.  The<br>difference between them, 63 cents, is not negligible.  12-equal<br>enharmonies are irrelevant as diatonic scales work in all<br>meantones, and the notation reflects this.<br><br>When Paul Erlich says "scale steps" he obviously means the 7 note<br>diatonic scale.
