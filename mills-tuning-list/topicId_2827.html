In my opinion, he is possibly the most innovative rock guitarist at<br>this time (that I have personally heard). His technique is jaw dropping,<br>his ideas are unique, and his compositions are quite original and modern.<br>Contact Dan at Box 701, Rutland Ma. 01543, and get a copy of his<br>tape.<br><br>    Bob Lee...I have always thought pedal steel was a great axe...I have<br>played a lot of country over the years, and have ran into a lot of pedal<br>steel players. It is, indeed, a great micro instrument (have you ever<br>heard Buzz Evans?). I have been playing 19 tone eq for over 8 years, and<br>would be happy to chat about it with you. Post me personally if you<br>wish. I also have recorded an original country style piece in 19, which I<br>will send you if you post me your address...be in touch.<br><br>    Also, if you're looking for that last minute xmas gift, why not try<br>one of my 2 CD's, "The Gate," featuring music in 12 and 19 tone tunings<br>(electric blues rock), or "Acoustic Stick," acoustic music in 19 and 34<br>tone eq temps...Box 150271, Lakewood, Colorado 80215...$10, plus $2<br>postage...also, a belated thanks to Gary Morrison, who unselfishly helped<br>me out with a last minute grant to finish the "Acoustic Stick"<br>project...a true microhero...Hstick<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Melodic Limen and Definition of Pitch Classes<br>PostedDate:  18-12-97 05:43:58<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  18-12-97 05:41:58-18-12-97 05:41:59,18-12-97 05:41:36-18-12-97 05:41:37<br>DeliveredDate:  18-12-97 05:41:37<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256571.0019CCD9; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 05:43:44 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18515; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 05:43:58 +0100<br>Date: Thu, 18 Dec 1997 05:43:58 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18665<br>Received: (qmail 18127 invoked from network); 17 Dec 1997 20:43:54 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 17 Dec 1997 20:43:54 -0800<br>Message-Id: <34990CA1.5926@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
