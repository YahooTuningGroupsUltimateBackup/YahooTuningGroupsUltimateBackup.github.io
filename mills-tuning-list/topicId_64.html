I certainly<br>agree that, even if it were a boring topic, psychoacoustics can provide valuable<br>insights for people like us.  I never would have imagined myself writing<br>anything to detract from that premise.  <br><br>   But uh...  I guess here I am.  <br><br>   I recall a conversation I once had with a LaRouchie (and I'm not for a<br>bananasecond implying that Brian is a LaRouchie!), who was trying to convince me<br>that hearing was "a complex electromagnetic process".  She cited as evidence,<br>that individual air molecules in a soundwave move far greater distances than the<br>surface of the ear drums they excite.  I just had a heck of a time trying to<br>convince her that everything about the transmission of sound to the ear drum can<br>be accounted for quite well by macroscopic measures like air pressure.  <br><br>   So although applying quantum mechanics to explain the motions of galaxies may<br>be useful in locating and proving a superunified field theory, we need to be<br>cautious about getting too bogged down in the microscopic details of<br>neurophysiology for practical matters such as composition.  <br><br>   Ultimately all that matters is, "how does it sound".  And I think it's only a<br>slight oversimplification to say that what sounds like "X" to the composer,<br>within reasonable limits, will sound "X" to an audience.  At some level of<br>detail you have to ask yourself whether knowing the exact neurophysiological<br>reasons WHY it sounds like "X" really matters all that much.  <br><br>   I'm certainly not disputing that there are compositionally valuable insights<br>to be gained from mathematically modeling sound perception.  Bill Sethares'<br>timbre mapping concepts strike me as an excellent example of this.  Still,<br>sometimes forests are more meaningful than the vein structures of the individual<br>leaves of the individual trees.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 3 Oct 1995 14:12 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id FAA28422; Tue, 3 Oct 1995 05:11:50 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 3 Oct 1995 05:11:50 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199510030943.GAA25024@chasque.apc.org><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
