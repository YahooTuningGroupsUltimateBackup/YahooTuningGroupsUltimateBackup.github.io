The<br>most important thing I left out was that local maxima and minima have<br>limited relevance unless your music uses continuous sweeps of the<br>interval spectrum. I have always held this as a (very mild) criticism of<br>some of Sethares's arguments. It only takes a tiny change in the<br>harmonic entropy function (say, a change of 1 in N) to convert a local<br>maximum into a local minimum or vice versa. The value of the function<br>need change only very little at any given interval, but the just ratios<br>will tend to be near these local extrema. The values of the function are<br>more important, however these are dependent on whether the allowed<br>fractions in the analysis are defined to have numerator less than N,<br>denominator less than N, num. + den. < 2N, etc. The choice of one of<br>these rules is a difficult one, but the local extrema, I think, should<br>be independent of this choice, which is why I only reported those. <br><br>>My immediate medievalist reaction: shouldn't 16:9 be listed here as a<br>>basic ratio at 996 cents? Somehow my Pythagorean predilections find it<br>>curious that this interval should be treated mainly as a point of<br>>maximum ambiguity between the 5-prime and 7-prime standards, rather<br>>than a 3-prime standard in its own right.<br><br>As you may recall, I don't believe in prime standards for consonance,<br>only odd standards. This analysis did not allow for any octave<br>equivalence efffects, so evens are just as good ass odds and integer<br>standards reign. 16 is a very high integer.<br><br>>Also, this interval seems<br>>very basic to me since it is derived from two pure 4:3 fourths.<br><br>I agree that it can be so derived in a musical context. However,<br>presented on its own, the ear has NO WAY of analysing the 16:9 into two<br>4:3s. This kind of "derivation" has no _acoustical_ relevance to the<br>interval on its own. Try tuning two strings a minor seventh apart and<br>see what ratios you are drawn to.<br><br>>I'm curious if this result for 16:9 might say anything about the<br>>Pythagorean m7 (which often gets used prominently in 13th-14th century<br>>music, and which I tend to agree with some medieval theorists has a<br>>certain degree of "compatibility" or even "concord")<br><br>In medieval times how sure could you be that your m7 wasn't a 7:4 or a<br>9:5, unless it was built up from two 4:3s, in which case my previous<br>caveat applies? Anyway, these three minor seventh differ relatively<br>little in the value of the entropy function.</div>
