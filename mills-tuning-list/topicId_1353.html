The fact is, the name was chosen because of a<br>perceived resemblance of certain intervals to the howling of wolves. As<br>wolves' calls do have a distinctive steady beating, and are often<br>dichordal, this is not an unreasonable metaphor.  Any qualitative judgement<br>about this sound is a function of time and place, and we are now - given<br>our modern, urbanized reverence for animals - free to admire both sounds,<br>and recognize certain similarities, much as listeners in the past<br>apparently found both sounds disagreeable, while recognizing similarities.<br>Your regular ( -s) ending for a synechdoche form is without precent<br>grammatically and unnecessary, because the term _Wolf_ was used initially<br>as an unaccompanied noun, and not in the adjective-noun combinations (_wolf<br>interval_, _wolf tone_) found later (my earliest example is nineteenth<br>century - but Jonathan Walker may know an earlier source). As I indicated<br>before, the _wolf_ is a metaphor, and a metaphor must retain the declension<br>of the borrowed term. <br><br>Furthermore, English has so few surviving Germanic plural endings that it<br>certainly adds to the surface variety of our language to be able to use one<br>when we can!<br><br>Letï¿½s get back to tuning...<br><br>Dr Daniel Wolf, Frankfurt  <br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Topic No. 7<br><br>Date: Tue, 10 Dec 1996 15:40:11 -0500<br>From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com><br>To: "INTERNET:tuning@eartha.m" <tuning><br>Subject: Ornaments and Intonation<br>Message-ID: <199612101540_MC1-CE2-BDC2@compuserve.com><br><br>In passing, Jonathan Walker mentioned a feature often attributed to<br>European music, the use of ornamentation (from vibrato/_Bebung_ to trills,<br>etc.) as a means of obscuring intonational problems.<br><br>Since the tradition of performer-supplied ornamentation is not continuous<br>(having been broken by the tendency of composers to notate in ever more<br>detail - and the expectation that novelty in a new composition involved<br>departure from tradition, including traditional ornaments), I am interested<br>in learning how this use of ornamentation is attested to in the theoretical<br>literature.<br><br>I ask because my experience of continuous ornamental traditions,<br>particularly that of South Indian classical music, has exactly the opposite<br>use of ornaments: in the Karnatic tradition, the ornaments (_gamakas_) are<br>essential to getting the intonation right, not to obscuring bad intonation.<br>In the exercises one practices in order to lear a raga, simple scales are<br>not used, but rather ornamented melodic types that are typical of the raga<br>in question.<br><br>For example, the raga closest to Major is sung not S R G M P D N s and down<br>again but rather ascending (every four _notes_ is a single beat):<br><br>S - - -   R S R S   G - - -     P G P -    P - - -    P s D -   s N s N   <br>s - - -<br><br>and descending:<br><br>s - - -   s N s N  bN DbN D   P - - -    M G M G    M - - -    R S R S   S<br>- - -<br><br>When sung with a   Sa= 1/1  Pa= 3/2 drone, the intonation<br><br>Sa 1/1<br>Ri 9/8<br>Ga 5/4<br>Ma 4/3 (Descending only)<br>Pa 3/2<br>Da  Ascending 5/3 (but only following a high Sa)  Descending 27/16<br>bNi 7/4 (Descending only, and only as gamaka for Da)<br>Ni  15/8<br><br>is quite easy to learn.<br><br>(I learned most of the above from T.
