At present I am limiting myself to equal<br>temprament scales.<br><br>It seems to me that there are three parameters to specify the scale,<br>and two (or one) to specify frequency required.  At present my<br>operator take as arguments<br><br>  1. The number of equal divisions	(eg 12 -- sorry 19)<br>  2. The interval to be divided		(eg 2 for octave, 3 for 12th)<br>  3. A base frequency <br><br>My question is about the base frequency.  At present I am toying with<br>either making this "octave" zero, which suggests in the system I use<br>(where octave 8 contains middle C) make is 1.021975, or alternatively<br>decreeing that octave 8 is the reference point, and so 8.0 is always<br>261.62561 (or there abouts).  <br><br>My first question is what have a failed to realise?  Is the reference<br>freguency really obvious and i have failed to understand?<br><br>My second question is how useful is the large interval other than 2<br>and 3?  I have this feeling that a two octave repeating scheme could<br>be interesting?  <br><br>I am using the selection in the format oct.pitch which assumes 100ET<br>or less.  Does anyone (apart from me) ever think about 100ET?<br><br>Any advice appreciated.  <br><br>==John ff<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 3 Dec 1996 01:54 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA27963; Tue, 3 Dec 1996 01:56:02 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA27923<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id QAA16966; Mon, 2 Dec 1996 16:55:59 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 2 Dec 1996 16:55:59 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961203005410_71670.2576_HHB60-1@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
