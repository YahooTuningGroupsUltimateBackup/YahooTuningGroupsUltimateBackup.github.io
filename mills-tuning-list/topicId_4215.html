I guess 11/9 is often harder<br>>to hear than some other ratios of 11, and I was too eager to provide a<br>>simple mathematical description of what I heard. I should trash all of<br>>page 20 (in the .pdf version) of my paper, as well as two columns of<br>>table 5. Although it's too late for Xenharmonikon, perhaps if Carl Lumma<br>>reppears we can revise the .pdf version accordingly. Aaargh!!!<br><br>I'm back.  I should be able to help.  I should also be able to help Grady<br>with pdfing the Wilson material.  Results may be slow, however.  I suggest<br>Paul and Kraig mail me off the list to discuss.<br><br>In the meantime, I'll post an open question.  I have just purchased a PC<br>(Intel) and have not yet decided on a soundcard.  So: If you could have any<br>soundcard, which would it be, and why?  I think I would prefer a PCI card<br>to an ISA one, but I'm flexible.  I would also prefer to have one card do<br>both MIDI and digital audio, but I'd be willing to get seperates if there<br>was a good reason.  Lastly, I'll want something that works well with Scala.<br> Let's pretend cost is no object for now.<br><br>At first I thought about the Turtle Beach Montego, but after reading<br>Manuel's post I said, "No Way!".  It seems the only other board to offer<br>Soundblaster compatibility is the Soundblaster Live, but I swore I'd never<br>buy another Creative product.  But is the Live actually a decent card?<br>Does anybody have one?<br><br>Carl</div>
