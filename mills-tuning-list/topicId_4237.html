It seems the only other board to offer<br>>Soundblaster compatibility is the Soundblaster Live, but I swore I'd never<br>>buy another Creative product.  But is the Live actually a decent card?<br>>Does anybody have one?<br><br>I'm not saying that this one shouldn't be bought perse. The number of<br>soundcards with drivers that support the Midi Tuning Standard is very<br>limited. There are also hardware features to consider.<br>But the Turtle Beach Midi file player that came with the card also plays my<br>pitchbended files incorrectly. That's not a drama since there are plenty of<br>other Midi file players. Although the user interface looks nice. So don't<br>use<br>it with Midi files made with Scala.<br>The drivers for the Montego card were written by the company that made the<br>audio<br>chip, Aureal. I wrote them an e-mail twice to ask for tuning support but<br>there<br>was no answer.<br><br>You can even have real-time synthesis by the CPU. I have just downloaded<br>Yamaha's S-YXG50 player. It needs MMX. Go to http://www.yamaha-xg.com/ and<br>follow the links to MIDPLUG and S-YXG50.<br>This also doesn't support the Midi Tuning Standard alas, but you can use<br>12-tone tunings with -64/+63 cents deviation from equal tempered in steps<br>of<br>1 cent. It's compatible with other Yamaha XG and Roland GS synthesizers.<br>Moreover it has 16 parts with each a different tuning table so you can use<br>16 instruments all with different 12-tone tuning, or 8 with different<br>24-tone<br>tuning, etc. So it's to be preferred over the pitchbend approach.<br>I'm looking into providing support in Scala for this synthesizer type.<br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl</div>
