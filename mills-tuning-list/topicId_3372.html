Was he trying to<br>> connect the equal tempered system to the pure intervals<br>> you would associate with just intonation?  And would<br>> Partch's response be - that's nice, but why don't we just<br>> start off with the pure ratios? <br><br>Monzo:<br>Basically, yes to all of the above, sort of.  You've got a pretty<br>good grasp of the general ideas.<br><br>The main point is that Schoenberg knew of the limitations<br>of the 12-eq scale (in the sense that most of us on the<br>Tuning List feel it is limited) and decided, mostly for<br>reasons of practicality on instruments and in notation,<br>that it suited his needs.<br><br>(By the way, he invented an interesting new notation<br>designed specifically for the 12-eq scale.   See the<br>article "A New Twelve-Tone Notation" [1924], reprinted<br>in "Style and Idea", p. 354-362, with some examples<br>from "Pierrot Lunaire" in the notation.)<br><br>Partch insisted that practicality was not a good enough<br>reason to sacrifice the subtlety and "acoustical truth"<br>of just-intonation, and so he built a whole ensemble<br>of his own instruments which were accurately tuned<br>according to his 43-note-per-octave 11-Limit<br> just-intonation system.  (See Partch's book<br>"Genesis of a Music", 2nd ed. [1974].)<br><br>I will re-quote what I feel is the most relevant part of<br>Schoenberg's letter to Yasser (quoted more completely<br>by Daniel Wolf in Tuning Digest 1386):<br><br>Schoenberg:<br>> ''I have presented the little tabulation of overtones<br>> not in a scientific fashion, not as a theory, but solely<br>> as a handy assertion that...even the chromatic<br>> scale appears to be justified through circumstances of<br>> a natural character.<br> <br>> ...indeed whenever I have had occasion to take up intonation<br>> with string players, I have always insisted on its _tempered_<br>> form...  To be musical, then, means to have an ear in the<br>> sense of music and not in the sense of nature. A musical<br>> ear must have assimilated the tempered scale. And a<br>> singer who produces natural pitches is unmusical..."<br><br>Monzo:<br>Schoenberg thought of the study and use of just intervals<br>as belonging to science, while art (composition) should<br>utilize the "defective",  but infinitely more practical, tempered<br>scale, perhaps basing at least some of its technique upon<br>the  _implied_  just ratios.  Wolf very succinctly summed<br>up the whole subject with two sentences (especially the<br>second):<br><br>Wolf:<br>> Need I remind anyone of Partch's anguished plea for the<br>> 'truth of just intonation'? Schï¿½nberg here is not rejecting<br>> such a "truth" in itself but rather the compositional<br>> utility of such.<br><br><br>   Joseph L.

Its been my experience that even the simplest of pitch arrays<br>can be frustratingly arbitrary on any of the above named instruments. Of<br>course, this would clearly be the case on the Casios and Yamahas which all had<br>resolutions larger than one cent, but what finally opened my eyes was my<br>initial experience with the k2000 which has a fine tuning resolution of one<br>cent. The Kurzweil had less pure intervals available than the others! Upon<br>reflection I realized that due to the larger than one cent tuning res. of the<br>Casios (CZ - 1.667 ct res./VZ - 1.5625 ct res.) & the Yamahas (1.171875 ct<br>res.), at least once in a while one could stumble upon a relationship that<br>came somewhat close to a purely tuned inverval. On the other hand, the K2000,<br>with its 1200 parts per octave was in essence a type of "equal temperament"<br>with no possiblity of even accidentally coming close to the decimals needed<br>for seriously just tunings. <br><br>Since this experience  (in 1992) I had the realization that the only way to<br>achieve pure ratio derived tunings on a digital synth was to make my own<br>samples at the desired frequencies and import them into my K2000. Perhaps some<br>acceptable fudging can be done with the above instruments if one is composing<br>percussive/pianistic types of music, but make no mistake - one is still only<br>approximating just intonation when using ANY commercial hardware synth's<br>tuning table.<br><br>David First<br><br><br>> >> >(K2500):  nTET and nCET scales can be<br>> >> >created at the program level by adjusting a few parameters<br>> >>    Perhaps you can provide some insight for Bill Meadows here:<br>> >Achieving nTET and nCET scales of any degree on K2000/K2500s is explained<br>> >in detail at my web site:<br>> t</div><h3><a id=7517 href="#7517">ðŸ”—</a>csz@wco.com (Carter Scholz)</h3><span>4/20/1998 10:19:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Steven Sauve writes:<br>==============<br>Greetings...I'm a rookie here, and my first interest is finding Alt<br>Scales for the Yamaha TX802...i've checked the Mills FTP site, but it<br>seems fairly void of anything...are there others out there?...<br><br><br>thanks,<br><br>steven in toronto<br>===============<br><br>If you have a Macintosh, you can download JICalc from the Mills FTP site<br>(ftp://mills.edu/ccm/tuning/software/mac/jicalc443.sea.hqx).
