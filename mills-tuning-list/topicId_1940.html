This is the ALTERNATIVE tuning mailing<br>>list, meaning non-12tET. The fact that Beck is an "alternative" artist<br>>should not help his case either.<br><br>   That's another annoying little terminological problem.  I personally<br>think that "alternate" and "alternative" is too small a linguistic<br>distinction to expect people to learn and make in normal speech.  I<br>therefore using "microtones", "xenharmonics", "unusual tunings", or (in<br>some cases) "nontraditional tunings".<br><br>   That latter term, however, I apply to a smaller group of tunings than<br>"xenharmonics" or "unusual tunings" for example.  To me at least, 5-limit<br>diatonic JI, and most typical usages of meantone are traditional but<br>unusual tunings.  They are traditional in that they have a historical<br>underpinning, and also in that they are capable of (only) diatonic melody<br>and well-known 5-limit harmonies.  The are unusual though in that those<br>melodic and harmonic possibilities sound different from 12TET.<br><br>   "Nontraditional" tunings to me are those that provide nondiatonic<br>melody, or nontraditional (e.g., 11-limit) harmonies.  These are clearly<br>unusual as well.<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 12 Apr 1997 17:23 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04083; Sat, 12 Apr 1997 17:23:09 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04081<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id IAA22572; Sat, 12 Apr 1997 08:21:37 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 12 Apr 1997 08:21:37 -0700<br>Message-Id: <009B2AED3A1DD21F.082A@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
