Using Kameoka & Kuriagawa, for<br>>example, there is no sense in which 27/16 will be more consonant that<br>>5/3 for any listener.<br><br>Certainly, the interval 5/3 sounds sweeter than 27/16, when each is sounded<br>in isolation.  I seem to have omitted a necessary part of the context -<br>sorry.  I was referring, not to the tuning of intervals themselves, but to<br>the tuning of JI scale members, used for tonal music.  If you built a minor<br>triad on the second scale member, and it was tuned to 9/8, the chord would<br>obviously be more consonant with a 27/16-sixth-scale-member<br>fifth-of-the-chord than a 5/3 one.<br><br>To restate, then, if all of the members of your scale are made up of ratios<br>involving 3^x, and possibly other primes and their powers, but not 5^x, then<br>a single note on the 6th of the scale, tuned to 5/3 or any ratio involving 5,<br>would sound out of place.  It could be used, though, as an intersection, a<br>corner around which to turn into a passage involving more scale members using<br>5^x in their ratios.  I've experienced this.  I'ts like the first time in a<br>piece that has been 5-limit (prime) up to that point, that you use a true 7/4<br>- zow!  But if you continue to use more ratios involving 7, it looses its<br>shock value and comes to sound quite pleasant.  I doubt that a 9/5 or 16/9 in<br>the same situation, if all 9s had been avoided up to that point, would come<br>as such a shock, even though 9>7.  I believe that that is because 9 _is_ 3 3s<br>- it contains 3s, for all rational purposes.  I have yet to see a convincing<br>example of the use of a ratio involving 9 where it did not function and sound<br>like it was part of the prime dimension based on 3.<br><br>David<br><br><br><br>$AdditionalHeaders:  Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id C12564DA.000712A8; Sun, 20 Jul 1997 03:17:15 +0200</div><h3><a id=5872 href="#5872">ðŸ”—</a> mr88cet@texas.net</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> In 12tET, there are 2 patterns available : hW hW hW hW and Wh Wh Wh Wh.
