Here's an example:<br><br>> One traditional means of deriving just intervals is of course to simply<br>> embark upon a series of perfect fifths:<br>..<br>> But does a singer ever sing this many successive fifths (or fourths)?<br>> Evidently not. In highly modulated music such a chain might occur, but<br>..<br>> The system is therefore without practical relation to music, and is one<br>> of those theoretical delusions which so plague and confuse musicians.<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that the point of using<br>scales based around just fifths is that they're peculiarly<br>easy to tune.  Even with my poor, untutored ear, I can recognise<br>a just fifth when I hear one.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Polychroni Moniodis <UPB_MONIODIS@ONLINE.EMICH.EDU><br>Subject:  Re: 19 and melodic lemons<br>PostedDate:  19-12-97 19:00:03<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  19-12-97 18:57:53-19-12-97 18:57:54,19-12-97 18:57:30-19-12-97 18:57:30<br>DeliveredDate:  19-12-97 18:57:30<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256572.0062AE0B; Fri, 19 Dec 1997 18:59:47 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA19407; Fri, 19 Dec 1997 19:00:03 +0100<br>Date: Fri, 19 Dec 1997 19:00:03 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA19387<br>Received: (qmail 11585 invoked from network); 19 Dec 1997 09:50:42 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 19 Dec 1997 09:50:42 -0800<br>Message-Id: <01IRBNSEF9C88X0KL0@ONLINE.EMICH.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
