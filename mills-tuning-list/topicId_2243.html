Once again, the 22-tone guitar is with<br>me for the long haul -- my little bits of 22-tone magic so far, some<br>conforming to my theories, others not, are really just the infancy of<br>something new, and I don't want to take any shortcuts in the learning<br>process. Sure, I've jammed on some 22-tone blues, etc., but that's not<br>what it's all about for me. Right now, I'm too busy with conventionally<br>tuned music and musicians to do what I will someday need to do -- shut<br>myself away from the diatonic outside world and really explore musical<br>space unhindered. I just turned 25 yesterday, and I guess it's keeping<br>me happy for now to keep surfing the 12-tone wave I'm riding -- there's<br>nothing like sharing a common musical language with musicians all over<br>the Western world (or what amounts to the same thing, Cambridge). I'm<br>not going to rush anything, and when the time is right, the 22-tone<br>>stuff will come together . . .<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 14 Jul 1997 23:13 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14079; Mon, 14 Jul 1997 23:14:25 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 14 Jul 1997 23:14:25 +0200<br>Message-Id: <9707142114.AA14079@ns.ezh.nl><br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13994<br>Received: (qmail 11248 invoked from network); 14 Jul 1997 19:51:43 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 14 Jul 1997 19:51:43 -0000<br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5857 href="#5857">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.
