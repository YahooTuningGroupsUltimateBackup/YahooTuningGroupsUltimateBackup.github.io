Without looking, stop the sweep where you<br>> hear 3-ness. Do the same for 7-ness,...<br> <br>As I stated in a post a few weeks ago, I think you're missing<br>the point here, Paul.  I agree with you totally here: to my<br>ears, it's difficult if not _impossible_ to isolate _exact_ <br>prime qualities in a _dyad_.  But add some more notes, and it<br>becomes fairly easy to compare the qualities heard in comparing<br>various intervals.<br><br>To my ears, fairly subtle pitch shadings can be distinguished<br>in a complex harmonic environment, and the only thing to which<br>I can attribute this ability to distinguish, is prime<br>factorization.  I agree with what most subscribers have said<br>(and you have said that you can agree with this too), that in<br>a _very general_ sense, humanity has historically<br>expanded its familiarity with prime qualities in music in an<br>evolving manner, certainly beginning with prime-base 2, then<br>continuing with 3, much later 5, and more recently 7 and higher<br>primes.  But these prime qualities don't mean much if you're<br>talking about a harmonic context of less than 3 notes.<br><br>It seems that, again in a general sense, people's aural<br>sensibilities reach a point where they're ready to embrace<br>the particular quality exhibited by a "new" prime.  Recognizing<br>the unique quality of 2 gives us a scale of octaves -- not<br>very useful musically.  Stacking powers of 3 gives a scale<br>of 12 obviously different notes, and if continued, new notes<br>which are only a small distance (a "Pythagorean Comma" or<br>23.46 cents) away from those 12.  Of course, since 9=3^2, this<br>3-Limit scale gives exact harmonic 9-identities.<br><br>Prime-base 5 became accepted as a harmonic interval because<br>it gave a new sound to the musical interval of a "3rd", a<br>sound which was "sweeter", "softer", "more mellow", but at<br>any rate very different, from the sound of the 81/64 or<br>3-Limit "3rd".  In expanding pitch resources, rather than<br>create new scales by stacking powers of 5, a few powers of 5<br>were used as bases from which were created other new scales<br>by stacking powers of 3.<br><br>At this point in history (today), I don't think anyone will dispute<br>that 7 is implied very strongly in most new tonal music in our<br>culture.  This is because of a similar process of prime-base<br>7 giving a harmonic "minor 7th" which is much more consonant,<br>in contexts where the minor 7th is used in tbe manner of a<br>consonance (as in the blues).  Certainly, there is still a<br>place, even in contemporary music, for 3- and 5-limit minor 7ths<br>and minor 3rds, but just as certainly, 7/4 and the "septimal minor<br>3rd" 7/6 have been enthusiastically accepted.<br><br>Harry Partch put 11 out there, Jon Catler's using 13, Ben Johnston<br>has gone as far as 31, Ezra Sims implies up to 37, and La Monte<br>Young's current Dream House goes up to 283, but alas, all this<br>music is so little known...<br><br>I'm coming to think more and more that this prime-factor<br>interplay is most expressive when it clashes against 12-Eq<br>accompaniment.  Perhaps this is why I'm so attracted to<br>certain blues performers.<br><br>Robert Palmer, in his book "Deep Blues", characterizes the<br>"deep blues" of the title as that blues style deriving from the<br>(Mississippi) "Delta" (the area south of Memphis).  Palmer<br>emphasizes again and again throughout the book that one of the<br>primary ingredients that sets this style apart from other blues<br>styles is its best performers's (Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters,<br>Otis Rush) subtle use of microtonality in the high bottleneck<br>guitar lines and especially in the vocals.<br><br>What's important to remember is that the rest of this music,<br>meaning the strummed guitar notes, the bass lines, and piano if<br>present, would be in 12-Eq (or something very close, depending on<br>how well-tuned the instruments were).  This clash also figures<br>importantly in the style of Hendrix, and of course, is at the<br>bottom of the dispute to Schoenberg's claims of the 12-Eq scale's<br>implied ratios.<br><br>I'm beginning to have a lot more respect for Johnny Reinhard's<br>concept of "polymicrotonality", partly for this reason (and partly<br>because Reinhard's own compositions exploit the idea so<br>effectively, regardless of what Anthony Tommasini thinks).<br><br>The point, as far as a response to Erlich, is that _complexity_<br>of harmonic resources gives lots of intervals, odd numbers, and<br>primes to compare, and I think that as the harmonic resources<br>become more complex, we rely more and more on prime factorization<br>to delineate the differences,  to "put together what goes<br>together".<br><br>(I'd really like to see more feedback about microtonality in<br>the blues.)<br><br>   Joseph L.
