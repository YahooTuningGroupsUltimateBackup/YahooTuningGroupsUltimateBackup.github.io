Last night I programmed Cakewalk to play this melody (a step<br>line to line is 10 cents, and the chart is to be read left to right, piano<br>roll style)<br><br>   -   -   -       -       -  --<br>  -       -   --  -    -  -<br> -   --  -   -   -    -  -   -<br>-   -   -   -   -   --  -   -<br><br>The difference in each four note phrase was easily heard. Here is a<br>melody interleaved with several variations in which each difference of 10<br>cents is obvious.<br><br>A couple of points I argue against--<br><br>>1.Musicians do not write for exceptionally acute listeners, but for the<br>>masses.<br>I certainly don't write for the masses. Others may, but it strikes me as<br>a huge waste of time.<br><br>>2. 22-tone equal involves its failure to close the<br>>cycle of fifths. I am aware that some will say to themselves - so what?<br>"So what?", I said to myself. You were right about that.<br><br>>3. But a musical system that does not close the cycle of fifths has at a<br>>stroke isolated itself from 99% of the music not merely of the western<br>>19th century, but from virtually the whole of the western tradition, and<br>>from many other musical traditions as well.<br>And...?<br><br>>4. The septimal limit is more interesting. But it is dissonant...<br>Dissonant? Even the 7/4?<br><br>>5. Your reference to individuals being trained to reliably distinguish<br>>melodic intervals as close as 10 cents is the most fantastic piece of<br>>information I have ever been privileged to encounter.<br>There is nothing fantastic about this. In a laboratory setting this sort<br>of resolution is not extraordinary (try the above tablature experiment<br>yourself). Training is the key. Now, to recognize a 10 cent difference in<br>a live performance without training, of course you are right. Remember,<br>the people on this list are not Joe Average, and they are trained (or<br>train themselves) to make these sorts of distinctions.<br><br>Greg, keep it up. I love the controversy you generate.<br><br>John Starrett<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
