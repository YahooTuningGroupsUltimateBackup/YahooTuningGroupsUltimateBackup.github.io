Lest someone be discouraged from<br>exploring 41-TET, I offer a simple-minded solution that requires 4 MIDI<br>channels, no channel-clogging messages, and a single tuning table <br>(even a 12/octave table will do).  It can be generalized to any ET.<br><br>Tune the table to the following degrees of the 41-TET scale: 1, 5, 9, <br>13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41 -- that is, every fourth degree, for <br>an equal note spacing of 117.06 cents.  Set the synth's global <br>pitch-bend range to one semitone.  Send MIDI channel 2 an initial <br>pitch bend equal to 29.26 cents; bend channel 3 by 58.53 cents; and <br>bend channel 4 by 87.80 cents.  You now have degrees 1, 5, 9... playable <br>on channel 1, degrees 2, 6, 10... on channel 2, degrees 3, 7, 11... on <br>channel 3 and so forth.<br><br>You still have to assign notes to the proper channel, which may be<br>a non-trivial task depending on the composition, but at least you can <br>get the pitches without inserting a lot of messages -- just one <br>pitch bend at the start of each track.<br><br>This doesn't invalidate Brian's point.  The technique works <br>only with ETs, and it eats up n MIDI channels per timbre (where <br>nï¿½grees/12).  So if you're trying to realize an octet in Partch-43, <br>you would run up against the very real problems Brian describes.  <br>Still, I thought I should pass the tehcnique on, simple as it is, <br>in case it wasn't obvious to some readers of the list.<br><br>(It occurs to me that some just scales. e.g. tetrachordal types, might <br>have internal congruences and repetitions that could exploit such fixed <br>channel offsets.  These would, though, require tedious calculation on a<br>case-by-case basis.  It would be an interesting exercise to determine <br>if the Partch scale is sufficiently self-similar to use this technique.)<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 20 Dec 1996 02:38 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10966; Fri, 20 Dec 1996 02:40:51 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10964<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id RAA08398; Thu, 19 Dec 1996 17:40:48 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 19 Dec 1996 17:40:48 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.961219165835.15664B-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
