Even a triad <br>can be a dissonance when the prevailing harmonic texture is dyadic, as in <br>Medieval music which is based on the "perfect" consonances. I was trying to <br>use naive, conservatory definitions of consonance and dissonance to keep the <br>discussion brief. In jazz, the seventh chord is consonant, especially in the <br>mixolydian mode, where the "dominant" seventh is the tonic. Resolutions are <br>easy to create, but finding appropriate ones within a coherent pitch system <br>is more difficult and very important. Too many different pitches without <br>simple relationships and within too short a period of time, and music <br>becomes unlistenable to my ears. Unless we're talking about sliding pitches <br>motivically used or something like that.<br><br>You wrote,<br><br>>   Now understand that I don't doubt for a moment that tuning the seventh<br>>sharper produces a MORE satisfying resolution. But 7:4 provides a <br>completely<br>satisfying resolution to my ears, and many others'.<br><br>The first sentence here seems to contradict everything else you're saying. <br>Do you want to modify this statement?<br><br><br>Ed: I'm not sure what you're disagreeing with, but I'll guess. I'll grant <br>you that in barbershop singing, all chords are tuned as justly as possible. <br>I will also grant you that a skillful vocal quartet can reduce the perceived <br>difference between a 16/9 and a 7/4 by sliding, subtly shifting the 1/1, <br>etc. The difference between a 10/9 and a 9/8 may be imperceptible <br>melodically (one does not notice that two D's are used in the progression <br>C-F-Dm-G-C), but the difference between 16/9 and 7/4 (in the progression <br>C-F-G7-C) is noticeable and requires other means to cover it up. To my ears, <br>anyway. Try playing Mozart with dominant sevenths tuned 4:5:6:7, and you'll <br>get some angry scowls from the audience.<br><br><br>Pat: More recent studies than Helmholtz have found that although violinists <br>prefer sharpened major thirds and major sixths, which was thought to be due <br>to a preference towards Pythagorean intonation, they also prefer sharpened <br>minor thirds, fouths, and fifths, so the preference seems to be towards <br>larger intervals in general. All of these studies, by the way, are concerned <br>with these intervals in a melodic, not harmonic, context.<br><br><br>Brian: Your assertion that 99+% of psychoacoustic research supports the <br>conclusion that the fifth perceived as most pure is larger than 702 cents, <br>is ridiculous, unless you meant to add, "in a melodic context." <br>Harmonically, there is nothing which distinguishes a 709 cent fifth (with <br>which I am very familiar) from a 702 cent fifth, except that the latter does <br>not beat. If the lack of beating is not a criteria for "purity," then I <br>can't imagine what is.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 3 Sep 1996 21:56 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17406; Tue, 3 Sep 1996 21:57:34 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11088<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA03363; Tue, 3 Sep 1996 12:57:32 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 3 Sep 1996 12:57:32 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199609031954.NAA24914@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
