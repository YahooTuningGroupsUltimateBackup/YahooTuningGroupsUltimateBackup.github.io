Scores and<br>everthang....] *and* its aesthetic and historical contexts. It's quite a<br>short read, and - at the very least - the explication of the overall<br>architecture of Cage's early percussion works is worth the price of<br>admission alone. I think it should provide you with a good idea of the<br>range of Cage's compositional output over the course of his career, as<br>well. I'd sure like to see a volume of as high a quality on Mr. Partch....<br><br>An interesting aside: he alludes to it a bit in the introduction to the<br>book, but James *certainly* didn't start his musical career as a<br>fan of Cage's work - if anything, quite the reverse. What changed his<br>view was a serious look at the work itself, and the experience of meeting<br>and getting to know Cage. I think that at least some of the insight gained<br>helps to make this an interesting book, and I commend it to your<br>attention.<br><br>With regards,<br>Gregory<br><br>_<br>I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,<br>paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only<br>maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it.

Contrary to the Jon Szanto position regarding the substitution of a<br>sythesizer for the chromelodeon.  Mr. Szanto, I move for you to strike<br>from the record (e.g. your web site) this unfair statement.  The web<br>site reads: "If Mr.Reinhard has used a syth, then he has either<br>ignored or simply not comprehended a Partch truism..."<br><br>Partch writes in February to Lauriston Marshall (on p. 190 of the Gilmore<br>book) "I shall use the Chromelodeon very little from now on; its<br>musicality doesn't satisfy me, though it is indispensible from the<br>standpoint of theory..."the need either for an electronic tone or a reed <br>made out of some alloy less susceptible to temperature changes than<br>brass."<br><br>On April 6 Partch and Marshall won a Guggenheim Award for "studies toward<br>the development of an electronic instrument with electronic tone and<br>manual keyboard."
