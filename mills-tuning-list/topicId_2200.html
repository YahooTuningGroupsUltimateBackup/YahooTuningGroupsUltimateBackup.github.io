I<br>drew up a few of these scales on paper but haven't yet listened to them.<br> Using a lower limit of 5 and an upper limit of 7 looks very strange on<br>paper!<br><br>BTW, I like a concept that Graham Breed introduced me to: harmonic<br>dimensionality using prime limits.  As I understand it, using all octaves<br>(like P. D. Q. Bach's Don Octave) would be 1-dimensional, Pythagorean scales<br>(3-limit in practice) would be 2-dimensional, 5-limit would be 3-dimensional.<br> So a lower limit of 3 with an upper limit of 5 would insure that every<br>member of the scale except the tonic itself would have a 3-dimensional<br>relationship to the tonic; and I think it might insure that every interval<br>created with the scale members would also be 3-dimensional (with respect to<br>the tonic; 2-D standing alone, right?).<br><br>Any comments?<br><br>David J.

For your information, it<br>>is the tuning that has the largest wandering tonic, 80 cents.<br><br>   Any equal-temperament in the group that I call "fibonacci+3" will do that.<br><br>   By fibonacci, what I'm referring to is J. Yasser's fibonacci-like<br>sequence of tunings (5 7 12 19 31 50 81...).  (By fibonacci-like I mean<br>that the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two.)  12<br>and up in this sequence have meaningful representations of major scales,<br>with a single size of whole-step and a single size of half-step in the<br>usual W W H W W W H setup.<br><br>   Those sizes of whole- and half-steps follow the REAL fibonacci sequence<br>(1 1 2 3 5 8...).  So, 7TET has a whole-step size of 1 and a half-step size<br>also of 1, thus it takes the first two positions in the sequence.  12TET<br>takes the second two positions:  2 steps for whole, and 1 for half.  19TET<br>takes the 2 and 3 positions, 31 takes the 5 and 3 positions, and so forth.<br><br><br>   Now, there is a parallel series that mimics the syntonic comma<br>difference in the Ptolemaic major-scale tuning, by increasing the size of<br>three of the whole tones by one chromatic degree.  That takes on the<br>pattern lW sW H lW sW lW H (lW large whole tone, sW small whole tone),<br>that pattern being dictated by where Ptolemaic tuning has 9:8 vs 10:9 whole<br>tones.<br><br>   That parallel "fibonacci+3" series then is (10), 15, 22, 34, 53...<br>These tunings, since they all have two different sizes of whole-step, can<br>simulate the syntonic comma error that gives rise to this particular<br>wandering-tonic effect.  With 22 the effect is very striking, since the<br>pitch change is big, whereas with 53, the effect is more of a hauting one.<br><br>   With 15 it ought to prove even more striking to say the least, because,<br>as Kami pointed out, the amount by which it wanders is HEEEEYUUUUGE!<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 6 Jul 1997 08:13 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05582; Sun, 6 Jul 1997 08:13:42 +0200<br>Date: Sun, 6 Jul 1997 08:13:42 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05592<br>Received: (qmail 2319 invoked from network); 6 Jul 1997 06:11:47 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 6 Jul 1997 06:11:47 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541105afe4983ac85d@[207.207.2.20]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
