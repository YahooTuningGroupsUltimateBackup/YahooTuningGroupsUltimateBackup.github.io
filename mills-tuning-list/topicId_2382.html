However,<br>as in the West, many of these writers seem to be writing from the<br>perspective of theorists rather than practicing musicians, thus may be<br>reflecting numerological ideals rather than musical realities. Modern<br>musicians such as Nazir Jairazbhoy are, of course, exceptions, and I would<br>certainly recommend his book to this list, which has a significant chapter<br>on tuning.<br><br>Of course most Indian musicians, as Ali Akbar Khan points out, have no need<br>of standardization. Instruments like the sitar have movable frets, and the<br>sarod, sarangi, violin, (and voice) of course, have no frets. Only with the<br>harmonium did the disease of 12TET standardization enter the subcontinent,<br>and most purists hate it. Nevertheless, it is intriguing to try to discover<br>either empirically or directly from practicing musicians what their tuning<br>ideals are. Such information, which may vary from musician to musician, can<br>still tell us a lot about the music.<br><br>>   On a related subject, and this is surely not a "scientific" study, I<br>>have noticed in my dealings this last year with folks who play music from<br>>other cultures, with non western tunings, that they seem to know very<br>>little about the subject of tuning, period...it seems to be more<br>>intuitive than anything else.<br><br>As someone else pointed out, this is hardly different from the West.<br>However, I would caution against jumping to the conclusion that if<br>musicians are unaware of a theory of ratios or how to count beats then they<br>are not knowledgable about tuning. I have talked with a few professional<br>Indonesian tuners who have a very sophisticated ear and who can speak very<br>knowledgably about different tunings and their effects, but if you were to<br>ask them about ratios or beats they wouldn't have any idea what you were<br>talking about. They may speak of tuning by the "rasa" ("feel") of the<br>sound, but I wouldn't assume such "intuition" (if that's what it is) was<br>incompatible with systematization or sophistication.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
