A <br>>fretted string is effectively an open string with shorter <br>>length. One can place frets at arbitrary positions and <br>>produce equally strong sounds. Please explain the <br>>sequence of ghosttones which occur in a series of fourths <br>>and fifths.<br> <br>The reason that I listed the fretting positions is that these fret<br>positions give you the positions at which you will find the <br>flageolet tones. (By touching the string lightly above the fret,<br>without depressing it.)<br>Use the fret positions as a guide. <br> <br>>> "Ghosttones" can be found at frets close in the cycle <br>>> of fourths and fifths.<br>>> i.e. Through fifths   E, B, F#, C#, G#, etc.<br>>>      Through fourths  D, G, C, F, Bb, Eb etc.<br> <br>I am assuming that you are calling the open string A<br>(i.e. guitar fifth for example).<br>This is the way in which I had compiled the spreadsheet for <br>the fretting. The note names that I used refer to positions <br>on this same string.<br>Obviously you could tune any string to any note, call the open<br>A, and the principle and fret positions would still be valid.<br>If 650 mm [usual guitar "scale" (the term usually used by UK<br>guitar makers)] is inconvenient for your violin or monochord;<br>send me the nut to bridge distance and I'll send the amended <br>spreadsheet output for any length you like.<br> <br> <br> <br>>What are the frequencies of these ghosttones (rather<br>>than the frequencies of the fretted tones at the same <br>>locations (which is what your charts show))?<br> <br>They are usually related to the pitch found at the corresponding <br>fret when it is played.  (as a fifth and an octave above) or <br>close on the chain of fourths and fifths.<br> <br>I need to get a LucyTuned guitar and find the notenames and <br>pitches for you. Or you could try it, test what you get and tell us. <br>I'll get to it this week. (We're away from home without LucyTuned <br>guitar, at present.)<br> <br> <br>>When you say "at fret...B" do you mean only a single<br>>fret or all the frets which produce B's? <br> <br>I was initially referring to the fret in the first octave<br>i.e. II fret on your 'A' string.<br> <br>      >> The volume is lower the further you move away from A.<br> <br>On the spiral of fourths and fifths.<br>As far as I recall (retest needed) on 'A' string.<br>Loudest is at octave (midpoint of string); <br>and octave above (2nd octave fret); 3/4 of distance nut to bridge:<br>next at first octave E fret (approx. 1/3 of distance nut to bridge)<br>etc. etc.<br>I shall give fret numbers and positions as soon as I have had a<br>chance to check this.<br> <br> <br>>I'm plucking my violin as I write this. I notice that <br>>the strongest ghosttone is the one I get when I touch<br>>the string near the middle. Does your sequence include<br>>this ghosttone?<br> <br>That is the first octave (see comment above)<br> <br>>Are you saying that there are no ghosttones at places<br>>other than these fret positions?<br> <br>For clearly heard ones, yes, that seems to be the case.<br>except beyond the end of the fretboard. (Ocatves etc.)<br> <br>>Are you sure that the volumes of the ghosttones in your<br>>series are in the same order as the series (in other<br>>words that no ghosttone is louder than one earlier <br>>in the series)?<br> <br>Within an octave that seems to be the case.<br>Applying this in higher octaves, produces quieter ghosttones.<br>If someone has a high quality tuner, and a way to measure amplitude,<br>we could test this, with a "constant" pluck.<br>Also by tuning an adjacent string to the "expected" result, and<br>watching for sympathetic vibrations.<br>One way that I have tried this is by placing a tiny piece of paper <br>on the "sympathetic" string, and watching it for the "ghosttone/fret" <br><br>positions which cause the paper to jump off the string..<br> <br>>Are you saying that the volume of a ghosttone some<br>>number of fretted-fifths along the series is as <br>>loud as the volume of a ghosttone the same number <br>>of fretted-fourths along the series (for instance <br>>ghosttone at fret for C# as loud as ghosttone at <br>>fret for F)?<br> <br>I need to test for the answer to this question.<br>My problem with this experiment will be to measure volume, <br>and allow for frequency differences (hence the decision is <br>listener subjective at this time).<br>Perhaps we could arrange some sort of adjustable "mechanical finger"<br>to do the light touching, and test it with high quality equipment.<br> <br>lucy&jk (house-sitting for 24 hours in Hilo).<br> <br> <br> <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 20 Feb 1997 01:14 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12028; Thu, 20 Feb 1997 01:14:52 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12025<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id QAA08746; Wed, 19 Feb 1997 16:13:05 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 19 Feb 1997 16:13:05 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.07.9702191837.A24468-c100000@login><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
