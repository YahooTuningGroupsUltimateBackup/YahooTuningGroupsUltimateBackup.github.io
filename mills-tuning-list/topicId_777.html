The <br>first was my father's off-handed comment that he wondered what 7th root of 2 <br>musical scales would sound like and explained the "small whole number ratio" <br>rationale of JI.  Between his slide rule, my tape recorder, and my school's <br>sine wave generator, I completed a rough school project on 7tet.<br><br>The second, when I was maybe 12 years old, came when my mother's copy of <br>Switched On Bach coughed up a second 7" single from Columbia Records with <br>samples of other avante-garde releases.<br>There were several selections (6, as I recall) but only three made an <br>impression:<br>1)Terry Riley's Rainbow In Curved Air, an accident of fate that changed my <br>musical life -- Riley though not a rigid JI theorist does use just tunings <br>on almost all of his work the past few decades,.<br>2) Steve Reich's Violon Phase, which when I sought out and found various <br>Reich albums also introduced me to tape work like Come Out and It's Gonna <br>Rain and, obliquely, the ideas of psychoacoustics<br>3) Harry Partch.<br><br>Only with Harry Partch did I get a sense that this was something I really <br>was supposed to appreciate, intellectually, but I just couldn't find a way <br>to understand and integrate his approach into my own music-making.  Harry's <br>piece made an impression but I've never really gotten used to it.<br><br>As an adult I've re-listened to Partch and acquired two albums which rarely <br>leave their album covers.  For me, he's one of those artists whose corpus <br>has a meaning that far exceeds the sum of the individual pieces.  Li Po was <br>wonderful when I saw it live at The Knitting Factory but it was because it <br>was part of the Harry legend.  If I'd run across Li Po on the radio, I might <br>well have continued searching the dial.<br><br>It seems from reading this TUNING list that a newbie with an interest in <br>Partch today has to do a fair amount of research to pull together enough <br>obscure or out-of-print recordings, interviews, personal reminisces, and so <br>on to get a picture of the man and his music -- and live performances with <br>correct instruments are rare.  I hope Partch can become more "quickly" <br>accessible (which is different than more "easily" accessible) through a new <br>wave of Partch recordings and documentation.  Maybe I'll give Harry another <br>try.<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Topic No. 6<br><br>Date:     Fri, 23 Aug 1996 18:44 +0200<br>From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)<br>To: tuning<br>Subject: Scala command script example<br>Message-ID: <009A74AB8C311EA0.30B9@vbv40.ezh.nl><br><br>In this post I shall give a short lesson of how to create a Scala command<br>file that calculates a scale as a function of some parameters.<br><br>Bela Bartok has devised an axis-system of notes.

Please note that the discussion on<br>Partch he refers to is on that newsgroup not related to what's going on here.<br>Toodle pip!<br>Brian Lee<br>*****************<br><br>It's great to see all this discussion about Harry Patch!  CRI has kept his<br>music available for more than twenty years.  He's a back bone of our<br>catalogue not to mention the experimental tradition in American music.<br><br>When we reissued on CD The Bewitched, we made a flyer offering both our<br>Patch CDs plus three books by our about Partch and the video of The<br>Dreamer That Remains.  If you e-mail CRI, we can send you this flyer by<br>standard U.S. mail.  Of the three books offered (an annotated catalogue of<br>his works, Genesis of a Music, and Bitter Music), Genesis is out of print<br>when last we checked, but the other titles can be obtained still through<br>CRI.  <br><br>AND, we have plans to reissue the majority of Patch's remaining Gate 5<br>recordings on CD.  Gate 5 was Patch's own label wherein he recorded the<br>majority of his major works.  Our two CDs of recordings are drawn from<br>Gate 5 material.  Lots still remains -- many recordings not heard in<br>years.  I spent a weekend last spring with Danlee Mitchell, Patch's heir,<br>in San Diego reviewing the material.   That's all I'll say for now... It's<br>going to be a lot of work to get this done (two or three new CDs) with<br>proper notes and librettos, etc.  So, my guess is winter/spring of next<br>year will be the time to look for a major new Patch series on CRI.<br><br>Joseph Dalton<br>Managing Director<br><br>COMPOSERS RECORDINGS, INC.<br>73 Spring Street, Suite 506<br>New York, NY  10012-5800<br>phone 212.941.9673<br>fax 212.941.9704<br>e-mail:  CRInyc@aol.com</div>
