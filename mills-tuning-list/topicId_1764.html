Each time I tuned, I tried to find appropriate<br>little personalities for each key. E and A were usually brilliant,<br>and G and E-flat were usually sweet; but it was a game pursued<br>for fun, and it was different every time.<br><br>I think it is simply true that the well temperaments are<br>attractive variations on ET, and they are indeed improvements<br>upon ET.<br><br>The French, of course, are bureaucrats by nature; but in practice<br>a well temperament is better even for serialism than a blank<br>ET. It is true that one might want to retune keyboards in serial<br>pieces from section to section, or even phrase to phrase, but<br>that is no insurmountable problem with electronic instruments.<br><br>Best,<br><br>Will<br><br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 11:35 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02738; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 11:34:59 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02712<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id CAA05635; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 02:33:15 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 3 Mar 1997 02:33:15 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.91.970303022618.25007B-100000@si.UCSC.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4956 href="#4956">ðŸ”—</a>kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk (Jonathan Walker)</h3><span>3/3/1997 4:02:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Will Grant wrote:<br>> <br>> I don't know the reference here, but I know from personal<br>> experience that C# and Db can be quite different.<br><br>WHAT!<br><br>> It would<br>> be, of course, impossible to tune them both on the same piano<br>> at the same time, but that doesn't make them equivalent,<br>> except within the artificialities of ET.<br><br>HUH?<br><br>Either:<br><br>1. C# and Db are distinct pitches, as on a split-keyed instrument <br>intended for meantone tunings, or else <br><br>2. the distinction is purely notational, as on any 12-per octave <br>keyboard, whether tuned to 12TET or to a well-tempered scheme. In this <br>case, the distinction can either be<br><br>2a.  functional (e.g. a C#, and not a Db, as the leading note to D <br>major or minor) <br><br>2b. or  arbitrary (e.g. Bach's choice of Eb minor for the eighth <br>Prelude and Fugue of Book I, but D# minor for the eighth Prelude and <br>Fugue of Book II). Such arbitrary choices can be made on the basis of <br>various equally arbitrary associations, such as sharps brilliance <br>and flats mellowness etc., but they have no physical basis <br>whatsoever (do I really need to say this?) and such associations will <br>in any case vary from listener to listener.<br><br>> ergo, the distinction between C# and Db makes sense<br>> _only_ in well temperament. But of course, you can't<br>> set two different temperaments at once, at least not<br>> on a piano.<br><br>No! As I said above, the distinction only makes sense on instruments <br>which allow for more than 12 pitch-classes per octave.<br><br>Well-temperaments were given their name to distinguish them from other <br>temperaments -- namely the meantone family -- which did not allow the <br>playing of all keys, or limitless modulation on a 12-per-octave <br>keyboard. On a well-tempered instrument, there is no acoustical <br>difference between the keys of Db and C# (whatever different <br>associations the different notation might evoke for Will Grant); on a <br>meantone instrument, the issue is more complicated: taking the lower <br>rank of keys to be C, D, E, F, G, A, B, then if there is only one <br>upper rank key between C and D, it is of course not arbitrary whether <br>that key is C# or Db, but a matter of intervallic relations between <br>this key and those of the lower rank (it was always in practice C#, <br>simply because this was needed much more often, as a ficta <br>leading-note). However, to have two acoustically distinct scales of C# <br>and Db on a meantone keyboard would require no less than 19 keys per <br>octave (and still more if you wanted to play any pieces in these <br>keys). <br><br>Anyone who holds that C# major and Db major can be distinguished, on <br>grounds that are neither acoustic, nor associational has fallen prey <br>to terminal mystificatory impulses. If Will Grant is happy to accept <br>the associational explanation, I have no argument. Otherwise ... <br>(there's no arguing over mystical beliefs.)<br><br>-- <br>Jonathan Walker<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 13:04 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02796; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 13:04:36 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02804<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id EAA19368; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 04:02:51 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 3 Mar 1997 04:02:51 -0800<br>Message-Id: <331ABE94.602B@cavehill.dnet.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4958 href="#4958">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/1997 4:06:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Mon, 3 Mar 1997, Will Grant wrote:<br>> I don't know the reference here, but I know from personal<br>> experience that C# and Db can be quite different.<br><br>>From discussing the matter with people who could apparently hear the<br>difference, my guess is that they infer the key in the nebulous region<br>of C#/Db, G#/Ab, D#/Eb from the harmonic context: if you modulate into<br>it from the flat direction, it's a sharp key, and vice versa.<br><br>--pH (manynote@library.wustl.edu or http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote)<br>       O<br>      /\             "Do you like to gamble, Eddie?<br>     -\-\-- o         Gamble money on pool games?"<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 13:11 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02864; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 13:11:35 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02833<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id EAA19476; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 04:09:49 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 3 Mar 1997 04:09:49 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.970303061242.18729C-100000@library><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
