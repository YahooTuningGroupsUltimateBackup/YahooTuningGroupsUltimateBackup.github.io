I now have the barbershop tuning forum discussions properly <br>formatted on my web page. I have had a little more time to read these, <br>and there is some really interesting material (moving tonal centers for <br>one) in there. Again, I repeat my offer to forward these forums as email <br>to anyone who requests them.<br>	Has anyone written non-"standard repetoir"ish xenmusic for <br>barbershop quartet? I would think there must be some "out there" <br>quartets that would jump at the chance to try something really radical.<br><br>John Starrett<br>www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 30 Jan 1997 16:08 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA19844; Thu, 30 Jan 1997 16:08:07 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA19896<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id HAA04169; Thu, 30 Jan 1997 07:06:44 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 30 Jan 1997 07:06:44 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.07.9701291903.A24167-8100000@login><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4708 href="#4708">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/1997 5:29:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> I<br>> personnally am dubious about readding frets since this would eventually<br>be<br>> another obstacle like 12TET.<br><br>   Ah, but it can be an all-new obstacle.  <br><br><br>Ghostbusters II sez:<br>Dana:  I don't want to see you putting those same old cheap moves on me.<br>Venkman:  Oh no, I've got all new cheap moves now.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 1 Feb 1997 02:40 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA21667; Sat, 1 Feb 1997 02:40:07 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA21758<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id PAA06950; Fri, 31 Jan 1997 15:39:34 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 31 Jan 1997 15:39:34 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.94.970131182631.201B-100000@mercury.cis.yale.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
