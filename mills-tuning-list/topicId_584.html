"The octave: Percept or concept." Psychology of<br>>Music, 1983, v11 (n1):3-18.<br>><br>>"Abstract: Investigated octave generalization in 90 4-9 yr olds by means<br>>of responses to matching tasks based on judgments of similarity. In E<br>>PI, 54 Subjects, presented with 5 tone bars differing in pitch within an<br>>octave range, were asked to match a 6th bar to 1 of the 5 bars. Results<br>>indicate a significant tendency for tonal similarity to be judged as<br>>proximity of pitch. In Exp II, the probability of judgment on the basis<br>>of pitch proximity was reduced by providing an array in which the 5<br>>tones were clustered together in pitch. In Exp III, 36 Subjects were<br>>asked to arrange 2 sets of 5 tone bars each so that the arrays were<br>>similar. Although a few Subjects completed the task, no significant<br>>ability<br>>to solve this octave transportation task was found. It is concluded that<br>>a concept of "octaveness" is developed experientially and is not of<br>>perceptual origin.<br><br>It sounds to me like all this proves is that the experimenters could not<br>explain to children what they meant by "similarity." Certainly there are a<br>lot of different dimensions along which sounds can be judged as similar or<br>dissimilar. These experimenters did not prove that octave generalization<br>was not among those dimensions, as they claimed to have, but only that if<br>given a vague direction, children will choose another criterion of<br>"similarity."<br><br>When my two-year-old first matched pitch, he did it by singing a clear<br>octave above a pitch I sang. I can't say whether this "concept of<br>'octaveness'" was of "experiential or perceptual origin," but it is clear<br>to me that children (and not just my own) judge octave-transposed melodies<br>as equivalent long before their fourth birthday. Otherwise would they only<br>be able to learn songs from their mothers?<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
