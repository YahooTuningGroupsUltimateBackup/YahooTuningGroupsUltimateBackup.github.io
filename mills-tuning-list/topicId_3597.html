I know of at least one example where<br>serialism is most emphatically NOT atonal (and it's<br>not Bach either).<br><br>In his 6th Quartet [late 1970s], Johnston forged an<br>amazing synthesis of serialism and just-intonation.<br><br>He splits his row in half (hexachordal division was<br>explored a bit by Schoenberg in his last compositions:<br>see "A Study of Hexachord Levels in Schoenberg's<br>Violin Fantasy" by David Lewin, in  _Perspectives on<br>Schoenberg and Stravinsky_, p 78 - 92), and makes<br>each hexachord a 6-note JI chord, with identities<br>1 thru 11 (ï¿½ la Partch), arranges these tonal<br>hexachords so that one of them always has the six<br>12-eq pitch-classes that are missing in the other<br>(thus completing a 12-tone row),  then combines<br>hexachordal serial processes (with inversions,<br>retrogrades, and all the usual serial apparatus) with<br>the tonal structures produced by his extended JI.<br><br>This piece is an astounding intellectual acheivment,<br>and most incredibly of all, thru all the numerical<br>methodology, it still sounds great and packs a real<br>emotional punch!<br><br>Those interested in a detailed analysis are referred<br>to "A Harmonic and Serial Analysis of Ben Johnston's<br>String Quartet No. 6", by Steven Elster, in  _Perspectives<br>of New Music_, vol 29 #2 [Summer 1991], p 138-165.<br><br>There was an LP recording of it -- don't have any details,<br>but it's definitely worth seeking out.  Try a large city or<br>university library -- I've found a good deal of Johnston's<br>stuff there.<br> <br>Johnston's work is the most intellectually-stimulating<br>I've found in JI, and yet, sadly, it goes largely unrecognized.<br>(He's finally gotten a computer, and I'm trying to convince<br>him to get on this list.  His input would be most enlightening.)<br><br>    Joseph L.
