Wow, I thought I was the only one! (I did see a few in<br>Experimental Musical Instruments once). Considering the amount of<br>electric Arabic pop music I hear these days, I suspect there are a lot<br>more 24-tet guitars than 22-tet. Actually, I did inspire a guy (Steven<br>Rezsutek) on this list to refret his guitar to 22-tet, after he<br>independently came up with a lot of the same ideas as I did.<br><br>Let's say you're trying to play a 4:5:6:7 chord. In cents this is 0 386<br>702 969. In 24-tet, you'd start with 0 400 700. If you used 1000 (as in<br>12-tet) for the top note, your 7:6 would be 33 cents out-of-tune. If you<br>used 950, your 7:5 would be 33 cents out-of-tune. Both are pretty bad.<br>In 22-tet, using 0 382 709 982 has a maximum error of 17 cents (in the<br>7:5). That's about the same as the maximum error of a triad in 12-tet<br>(16 cents). Not too bad! (The same goes for 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4).<br><br>Another reason I like 22-tet is certain scales it contains. The<br>pentatonic scale is a nice source for 3-limit harmony and is OK in 7-tet<br>but almost perfect in 12-tet. The meantone diatonic scale is a nice<br>source for 5-limit harmony and is OK in 12-tet but better in 19, 31, or<br>50-tet. I discovered/invented some nice scales for 7-limit harmony and<br>their optimal tuning is very close to a subset of 22-tet.<br><br>Carl Lumma wrote,<br><br>>If we can agree that there is a difference between re-tuning music made for<br>>100 cent equal, as powerful a model and good-sounding a tuning as it is, and<br>>playing music made for 7+ limit Just Intonation, however embellished,<br><br>I agree! That's why I'm more interested in 22-tet than 19, 31, or<br>50-tet.<br><br>>then<br>>maybe we can be free to appreciate the excellent musicianship that thrives<br>>in every idiom the world over.<br><br>Whoops!

So, Peter Blasser, you're in good company.

The idea is useful only for<br>ETs with enough notes to offer accurate approximations (e.g., the fact<br>that 5-tet is 9-limit consistent is not particularly meaningful) but few<br>enough notes so that for any just interval, only one tempered interval<br>is an acceptable approximation of it (e.g., 35-tet has two acceptable<br>approximations of the 3:2, so restricting all chords to contain the<br>better of the two is not really fair).<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  clumma@nni.com<br>Subject:  Misc<br>PostedDate:  26-09-97 23:15:34<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  26-09-97 23:15:14-26-09-97 23:15:15,26-09-97 23:14:17-26-09-97 23:14:17<br>DeliveredDate:  26-09-97 23:14:17<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C125651E.0074BDD1; Fri, 26 Sep 1997 23:15:07 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA32292; Fri, 26 Sep 1997 23:15:34 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 26 Sep 1997 23:15:34 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA32311<br>Received: (qmail 10259 invoked from network); 26 Sep 1997 14:15:31 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 26 Sep 1997 14:15:31 -0700<br>Message-Id: <19970926211725312.AAA410@NIETZSCHE><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6171 href="#6171">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>9/27/1997 9:20:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>After testing 22tet and 24tet on a spreadsheet application, I must ask why<br>>22tet is better at imitating 11 limit ratios.<br><br>   I personally think that 11-limit ratios would not be the reason.
