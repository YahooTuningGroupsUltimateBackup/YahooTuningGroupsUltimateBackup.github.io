Rick<br>has been composing electronic music since the early 1970s, and this CD<br>includes some of his best electronic compositions of the past 20 years. The<br>selection of special interest to this forum is "Angel's Flight," which was<br>realized in 1976 I believe using an early sequencer to control a Moog model<br>12 synthesizer. He tuned to the Moog to what he called "pi-monics," where<br>the 2:1 octave was replaced by a ratio of pi (3.1416):1. It consists of<br>layers of sparkling sine wave arpeggios, effectively evoking the swirling<br>stars around the cosmic ladder section of Dante's Paradisio, the<br>inspiration for this piece, and it is somewhat reminiscent of early<br>minimalism.<br><br>The other pieces on the CD are in 12-TET and are quite varied in mood and<br>style. The title piece, Mesita Dreams, is a lovely kind of drone-music<br>evocation of the mesas of northern New Mexico. He told me that the beats<br>caused by the interference between the prominently resonated harmonics and<br>12-TET used to bother him, but now he likes them. Currently the only place<br>that I know of that you can get this CD is through the composer:<br><br>Frederick Lesemann<br>2342 Panorama Dr.<br>La Crescenta CA 91214<br><br>At his last concert he was charging $20 plus tax. I don't know if that's<br>the standard price or what his charge for postage and handling is, so you<br>better contact him.<br><br>Second, if you're interested in really great microtonal polyrhythms, check<br>out Gongs and Vocal Music from Sumatra, #12 on Smithsonian/Folkways, in<br>particular the first four tracks of Talempong music from the Minangkabau<br>people of southwest Sumatra. I was intrigued with this lively music (and<br>this culture, and their food!) when I was there, but I heard too little of<br>it. Now, happily, there is a good quality recording of it, with examples<br>from four different ensembles and tunings. They use mainly gongs and<br>horizontal kettle-gongs, similar to those in neighboring Java. However,<br>their tuning system features two very small successive steps in the scale<br>that I have not heard elsewhere in Indonesia. I haven't measured them, but<br>on one of the tracks I estimate that both steps are in the neighborhood of<br>70 cents or less.<br><br>The rest of the CD is good, and the gong ensembles naturally use<br>non-Western tuning, though the polyrhythms of the Talempong are to me<br>especially engaging. The last track is more of a popular genre and as such<br>uses Western diatonicism. All of the recordings are by Philip Yampolsky.<br>This release is available at many CD stores.

But limits are good.  Limits<br>stimulate rather than stiffle creativity.  If you have unlimited<br>flexibility to solve a compositional problem, then the solution will be<br>arbitrarily easy to devise, and that's boring.  When you operate within<br>limits, you have to devise clever and exciting solutions to compositional<br>tasks, which is much more interesting.
