Ivor was not much of a <br>technician, in the sense that his music wasn't that hard to physically <br>play; yet, he was a deep and feeling man, and his best works are <br>beautiful and meaningful; they really touch me. Blackwood is a world <br>class pianist and composer, capable of playing extremely difficult works <br>such as Ives' Concord Sonata; his compositions on "Microtonal" are surely <br>well crafted and technically complex. Yet, I find myself listening to <br>Ivor's "Detweleveulate" more often; I have no reason other than I like <br>the feeling more. And, on the subject of Blackwood's 15 tone guitar <br>etude; the sharp 5ths really bug me, especially because the piece itself <br>is reflective of music ("Baroque") where the 5ths were much closer to <br>pure. In fact, I've always wondered why Blackwood chose such a form for <br>the 15 octave tuning; nothing wrong with 15, but it seems to be fighting <br>the very style it's composed in. I talked with Blackwood on the phone <br>once, and he said that he thought 15 would be good for rock music, and I <br>agree. Rock thrives on dissonance (some styles do, anyway), and I can <br>really see his point. At any rate, all this is so personal and subjective <br>that it's hard to see a right or wrong, just feelings and <br>choices...Hstick</div>
