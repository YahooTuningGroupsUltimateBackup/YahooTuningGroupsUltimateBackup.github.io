The two incomplete French<br>>}>>augmented sixth chords (Bb E G# and Eb A C#) also have a unique resonance.<br>>}>>Huygens, in advocating meantone tempermant, pointed out (back in the 17th<br>>}>>century, I believe) that these latter chords are used in compositions and<br>>in<br>>}>>meantone are tuned very nearly 1/7:1/5:1/4. This may have been the first<br>>}>>attempt to use the number 7 in explaining musical practice.<br>><br>>Bill Alves wrote,<br>><br>>}I haven't read Huygens (apart from what Barbour says about him), but this<br>>}seems a curious justification. Given that the minor seventh of the dominant<br>>}seventh chord resolves inward and the augmented sixth of the German<br>>}augmented sixth chord resolves outward, wouldn't one expect that, ideally,<br>>}the augmented sixth to be a larger interval than the minor seventh? (If,<br>>}indeed, one considers the seventh harmonic to be in need of resolution at<br>>}all.)<br>><br>I'm not sure why one would expect that. Is there some size of minor<br>seventh that, to you, is a dividing line, such that a slightly smaller<br>one resolves inward, while a slightly larger one resolves outward? Try<br>answering this question:<br><br>"Given that the diminished fifth resolves inward and the augmented<br>fourth resolves outward, wouldn't one expect that, ideally, the<br>augmented fourth to be a larger interval than the diminished fifth?"<br><br>If you answer that in the affirmative, then we just have to be content<br>saying that meantone temperament does not have all the properties of an<br>"ideal" tuning. If you answer in the negative, then tell me why you<br>think this case is different from that of the minor seventh/augmented<br>sixth.<br><br>I do think that, since in many cases the melodic interval of resolution<br>is a diatonic semitone, for example in the resolution of a tritone, the<br>resolution of the augmented sixth will sound particularly convincing if<br>that same diatonic semitone is used in both voices. In meantone<br>temperament, the diatonic semitone happens to be larger than the<br>chromatic semitone.<br><br>I also think that resolution has much more to do with position within a<br>scale (in particular, a tonal mode) than with absolute interval size.<br>WIthout a scalar context, I don't think intervals have any particular<br>>tendency to resolve one way or the other.</div>
