My 88CET-tuning notation system uses<br>traditional notation symbols, although the pitches don't correspond to what<br>they would in traditional tuning.<br><br>   Well, my notation system is another big topic in itself, but what<br>matters for this discussion is that, in this notation system, the pitches<br>that correspond to my 88CET guitar's practical pitch range aren't terribly<br>practical for any traditional clef.  And since this is a nonoctave-based<br>tuning system, doing what in traditional tunings would be called an octave<br>transposition, like the real guitar does, is kind of risky.<br><br>   That practical range works out to the A on the third ledger line below<br>the bass staff up to the F on the top line of the treble staff.  Notes<br>above that F are feasible, but not terribly common.  As you can see, it's<br>also not centered nicely for a full grand staff.<br><br>   So, I'm toying with kind of an offshoot of the ol' Baroque-era movable<br>clef approach, or perhaps kind of a hybrid of that with a grand staff.<br><br>   Here's the evolution of thought as it ran through my head:  Of any of<br>the traditional clefs, that range of notes centers best on the tenor clef:<br>The low A works out to be five ledger lines below the tenor staff, and the<br>high F works out to four ledger lines above the staff.  But even still,<br>four and five ledger lines is a little cumbersome, especially since it can<br>play higher than that F.  So I then said, I can cut that down to three and<br>four ledger lines by employing a seven-line staff - one additional<br>non-ledger line below and above the usual bottom and top lines of the tenor<br>clef.  That makes keeping track of ledger lines a little bit more<br>tractable.<br><br>   Then I thought, you know, I'd almost bet money that it would be easy to<br>lose your place on a seven-line staff.  It would probably be easy to<br>confuse for example, the A on middle (fourth down) line with the C on the<br>third line down.  That distinction will probably be a rather unfortunate<br>additional complication when you're trying to also trying to monitor your<br>tone, that your fingers are right behind the frets, remember where the beat<br>is, which fingers (left and right!) you're going to play the next note, and<br>all that in three part harmony in eighths and sixteenths at 100bpm!<br>They'll probably both look like "notes buried somewhere in the middle of<br>this big, fat staff"!<br><br>   So what popped into mind was, as a navigational aid, how about removing<br>the center (A) line?  The result would look something like this (in this<br>dreadful ASCII-text graphics world!):<br><br>                                      -O-  Highest typical note<br>                                      ---<br>                                      ---<br>                            ++-^---------------------<br>                            ++o-/--------------------<br>                            ||<>-------"-------------  1st (D)<br>                            ++o \     -O-              2nd (A)<br>                            ++-v---------------------<br>                            -----------O-------------  3rd (D)<br>                            -------------------------<br>                                      -"-  Open 4th string (A)<br>                                      ---<br>                                      -"-  Open 5th string (D)<br>                                      -O-  Open 6th string (A)<br><br>   So what you have is kind of like two three-line staves in a<br>grand-staff-line structure, all built around the C clef.  That except that<br>the two staves would have no more space between them than that left by<br>removing the center line, rather than the usual greatly enlarged space<br>between treble and bass staves.<br><br>   Anybody have any thoughts on that, in terms of playability, for example?<br>Or how about thoughts on extending that one line farther in each<br>direction?<br><br>                                      -O-  Highest typical note<br>                                      ---<br>                            -------------------------<br>                            ++-^---------------------<br>                            ++o-/--------------------<br>                            ||<>-------"-------------  1st (D)<br>                            ++o \     -O-              2nd (A)<br>                            ++-v---------------------<br>                            -----------O-------------  3rd (D)<br>                            -------------------------<br>                            -----------"-------------  4th (A)<br>                                      ---<br>                                      -"-  Open 5th string (D)<br>                                      -O-  Open 6th string (A)<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Tuning-List Tape<br>PostedDate:  06-12-97 06:32:49<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  06-12-97 06:31:07-06-12-97 06:31:07,06-12-97 06:30:57-06-12-97 06:30:58<br>DeliveredDate:  06-12-97 06:30:58<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256565.001E4BE8; Sat, 6 Dec 1997 06:30:55 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07798; Sat, 6 Dec 1997 06:32:49 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 6 Dec 1997 06:32:49 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07801<br>Received: (qmail 12767 invoked from network); 5 Dec 1997 21:32:45 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 5 Dec 1997 21:32:45 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541100b0ae3dcfba89@[207.207.2.43]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
