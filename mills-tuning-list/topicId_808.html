This synthesizer (combination<br>of hardware and very sophisticated object-<br>oriented software running on a host computer)<br>*does* allow the user to do real-time granular<br>synthesis, totally flexible FM, AM and digital<br>additive synthesis.<br>Kyma is unique because it's software-controlled.<br>The instrument has MIDI IN and MIDI OUT ports <br>as well as A/D INs and D/A OUTs. The system is<br>capable of responding either to MIDI messages or<br>to acoustic sounds, and it can modify both of 'em<br>in astonishing ways in real time.<br>Several years ago, Kyma used 10 MHz Motorola<br>56001 DSP chips--you could add up to 8 boards<br>to increase the parallel processing power of the<br>system.  In effect, this meant you could get more<br>sounds at once, or a single more complex sound<br>in real time.<br>Since then, Carla Scaletti and Kurt Hebel have<br>systematically upgraded the Kyma until it now<br>features 8 56001 DSP chips operating at 66 MHz.<br>This makes the system significantly more powerful<br>than the ridiculously overpriced  $15,000 Ircam Signal<br>Processsing Workstation, or ISPW (most of us<br>always thought ISPW stood for "Insanely Sick <br>Plutocratic Wank-off.")<br>At less than a third of a price of the outdated<br>and obsolete ISPW, the Kyma system doesn't <br>require an exotic UNIX workstation to run the<br>system software--an up-to-date Mac (with<br>NuBus slot) or PC will do.  Moreover, Carla<br>Scaletti is constantly updating the software<br>and adding new capabilities...  The current<br>release of KYMA includes phase vocoder<br>resynthesis *in real time* (given a prior non-<br>real-time LEMUR analysis file as input),<br>cellular automata algorithmic composition,<br>real-time "morphing" between resynthesized<br>timbres, and much much more.<br>Because the system is completely under<br>software control, tuning is totally flexible.<br>Any kind of microtonal scale can be defined<br>and played in real-time or as an event-list.<br>The system's expensive, but nothing else comes<br>close to Kyma's capabilties, especially for<br>the computer-music microtonalist.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 31 Aug 1996 06:41 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10513; Sat, 31 Aug 1996 06:43:02 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10535<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA21831; Fri, 30 Aug 1996 21:42:59 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 30 Aug 1996 21:42:59 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199608310442.WAA02277@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3509 href="#3509">ðŸ”—</a>Pat Missin &#x3C;patm@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/1996 7:56:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>My thoughts on this subject, for what they are worth...<br><br>>Haverstick here...I want to make an observation inspired by McLaren's<br>>post regarding the studies undertaken to see what sort of tunings folks<br>>prefer....<br><br>Well, as someone who repairs and retunes harmonica for a variety of people<br>(from beginners to professionals), the overwhelming majority prefer JI. In<br>fact, there have been numerous times when someone has bought an brand-new<br>off-the-shelf harp of the equal-tuned variety and brought to me to "fix",<br>because it's "out of tune"! However, the same people then get very confused<br>when they play with a pianist and their 7/4 sounds way out, compared to the<br>piano's 1000c.<br><br>>...again, in a practical, nuts<br>>and bolts musical situation, eq temps are the only possible choice for<br>>many various styles of music...Hstick<br>><br>><br><br>I guess I feel I shouldn't agree with this, but can't help it. Much as I<br>prefer (and come to prefer more and more) the richness of my JI harps, in a<br>jamming situation, my first choice of instrument is a 12TET harp in the<br>appropriate key. Having said this, I wonder how often I (or anyone else with<br>an instrument capable of variable intonation) actually play in ET?<br>Typically, my blues playing features a lot of neutral thirds and slightly<br>flatted fifths.<br><br>My copy of "Sensations Of Tone" is out on loan at them moment, but I seem to<br>remember that Helmholtz found tendencies towards Pythagorean intonation<br>amomgst violinists - are there any other studies in this field?<br><br><br>Pat Missin  -  patm@globalnet.co.uk<br><br>"...my music's a lot better than it sounds!"

I<br>Just (harhar) wanted to make sure that everybody bears that in the backs of<br>their minds.  <br><br>   A lot of the reason why Wendy Carlos gets impressive results with extended JI<br>is that she has a well-defined means of making an indefinite (not to be confused<br>with "infinite") number of tones per octave.
