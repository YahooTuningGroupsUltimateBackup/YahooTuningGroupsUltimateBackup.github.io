What's your opinion on the question posed a few days ago<br>>about blue thirds as 7/6s (extra-flat) vs. 11/9s (semi-flat)?<br><br>There's a strong tradition for the 11/9 in country music.  Listen to Luther<br>Perkins' guitar parts with Johnny Cash, for example, or some of Ernest<br>Tubbs' vocals.  I use it a lot in that context, and I even wrote a song once<br>that built a major triad on top of it.  Of course, there's no 11/9 pedal on<br>the guitar, but it's an easy note to line up by sight because it's so close<br>to the quarter tone.<br><br>I don't recall ever using the 7/6 deliberately.  I'm sure I've hit in from<br>time to time in the heat of blues improvisation, but it seems to me that it<br>would have to resolve fairly quickly.  It's not a note that I'd let stand<br>for very long.<br><br>    -b0b-   http://www.b0b.com/infoedu/just_e9.html</div>
