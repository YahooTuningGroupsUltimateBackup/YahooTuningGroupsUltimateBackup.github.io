This scale in its non-abbreviated form (Mayumi R.<br>leaves out several notes and adds a couple of others, if I recall<br>correctly) includes only pitches with a numerary nexus of 13.  This<br>scale might be better described as the 13-Plane Scale, since all of its<br>tones are found on the "13-plane" of a multi-dimensional lattice<br>containing ratios of all primes less than 13, inclusive.<br><br><br>The 13-Plane Scale is easily divided into two subsets.  The first<br>always has 13 in its numerator, and its pitches are:<br><br>ratio	1/1 (13/13)	13/12	13/11	13/10	13/9	13/8	13/7<br><br>cents	0		139	289	454	637	841	1072<br><br><br>The second always contains 13 in its denominator, and is the inversion<br>of the previous subset.<br><br>ratio	1/1 (13/13)	14/13	16/13	18/13	20/13	22/13	24/13<br><br>cents	0		128	359	563	746	811	1061<br><br><br>My question: is this simply another way to find CPS pitches?  Am I<br>completely misguided about these two concepts?<br><br><br>Yours,<br><br>Adam</fontfamily><br><br>_________________<br><br>Adam B.

I like your tape and<br>> appreciate your good guitar skills, but to condemn music as being lousy<br>> because it doesn't "groove" or doesn't fit your _opinion_ of what "good"<br>> music is closed-minded and, if I may speak freely, a very limiting attitude<br>> which is mostly shaped by commercialism and arrogance.<br><br>   I suspect that that's a misinterpretation of Neil's appeal.  In particular, I<br>don't see that he's advocating any particular style of music over any other.<br>Here's what I think he's pointing out, and I believe quite accurately and<br>appropriately:  Technical, improvisational, and compositional skill of the sort<br>that comes only with untold hours and hours of practice, has a VERY big effect<br>upon the excitement of the music that comes of it.  <br><br>   And that, I believe quite firmly, is true of ALMOST every style of music.  <br><br>   As I think I mentioned, I've taken up the saxophone recently, with my nominal<br>goal being to improve my WX-11-based MIDI sequencing skills.  There can be no<br>doubt that the skills I lost over several years of composing and theorizing<br>instead of performing, have taken a really serious (although not fatal) toll on<br>the quality of my music.  And I see that it has on other xenharmonikers' music<br>as well.  For example:<br>1.  I have to perform a passage for the sequencer, often twelve or more <br>    times before I get it right.  The result, when the sequencer glues <br>    together all of the pieces, is too mechanistic, because by about the fifth <br>    take, all of the sponteneity and vivaciousness in the performance is gone.<br>2.  Lacking technical capability on an instrument, makes it very difficult to<br>    conjure up music on the instrument (in those cases where you compose at<br>    the instrument that is).  The results very often sound contrived or<br>    haphazard.  <br>3.  Lack of really solid background in ear-training in a new tuning makes it <br>    very difficult to reliably devise instrumental parts to a larger work, like<br>    devising accompaniment parts to fill in harmony, or accurately notating <br>    melodies conjured up in your head.  This is clearly important even in <br>    traditional tunings as well of course, but it's even more difficult to hunt<br>    for food in an alien landscape than in your own back yard.  (Xenharmonic<br>    Ear Training is one area where I am probably better off than average, but<br>    that's largely because the average, or at least the standard, is not <br>    nearly high enough.  Or that's my opinion anyway.)<br><br>   Now I say that virtuosity is valuable to "almost" every style of music,<br>because I suppose that if you actually WANT to express a feeling of rigidity and<br>clumsiness, then I guess you would actually benefit from lack of virtuosity.<br>But rigidity and clumsiness are certainly a very limited realm of expression.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 17:07 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01970; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 17:09:06 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01973<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA21438; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 08:09:02 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 6 Dec 1996 08:09:02 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.961206074650.34865A-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
