What I'm thinking of<br>> is the feeling that one has each time he hears a piece<br>> of music in the same mode.  ...in just intonation...you<br>> have the possibility of labelling your material in an<br>> abstract way with these [integer ratio] numbers, and<br>> in a true way which really represents them, and...also<br>> ...when you play any two or more of these frequencies<br>> together, they produce a composite waveform that is<br>> periodic; if it's periodic, it means that it is a<br>> structure which can be recognized, repeated, and stored,<br>> and then brought out of storage, used again -- listened<br>> to.  It's the basic principle for any system of<br>> information, or any system of language, because it<br>> depends on the fact that you can repeat things, and<br>> that's what the system of just intonation provides.<br><br>> ...When I hear the same interval in just intonation,<br>> it evokes in me a same feeling.  When I hear intervals<br>> in equal temperament, it's like they *remind* me of the<br>> truth, whereas when I hear intervals in just intonation,<br>> it's as though I'm *hearing* the truth.<br><br>This issue is available thru Sonic Arts.

Not to<br>suggest that it's synonymous with beauty, but just that it's an experiential<br>quality that depends on far too many considerations to be quantified.<br><br>   Or let me rephrase that in terms similar with Bill Sethares' book:  There<br>are physical and perceptual qualities of sound and music.  Logarithmic<br>amplitude is a physical quality, and volume (loudness) is a perceptual one. <br>Logarithmic frequency is a physical quality, and pitch is a perceptual one.<br><br>   You'll probably find a good 25-30 or so mathematically-formulable and<br>physically-measurable phenomena that will be called "consonance," or something<br>like that.  But don't confuse it with actual consonance, because that's a<br>perceptual quality, not a physical one.</div>
