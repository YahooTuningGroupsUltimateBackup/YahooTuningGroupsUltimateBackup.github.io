What is the difference between 16/9 and<br>9/5? (I you tell me that the difference is a comma, I will have to kill you.<br>What I want to know is when to use the two different intervals.)<br><br>I haven't dealt with 16/9, but I'm a great believer in 7/4, 7/5, 7/6, and<br>their consonant, or at least relatively consonant, nature.<br><br>I really enjoy contrasting the 9/5 and 7/4 in seventh chords (tetrads)<br>built on the same root. In 12-ET, these two intervals are represented by<br>the 10th chromatic pitch, and our ears bend the pitch to best fit the<br>harmonic context. <br><br>As proof of my previous sentence, and to silence any sceptics about the<br>importance of 7/4:<br><br>--create a pure 4:5:6:7 chord on your synth<br>--create a 4:5:6 triad, but add a 9/5 on top (9/5 * 4/4)<br>--create a 10:12:15:18 chord on the same root as each of the previous chords<br><br>After you are convinced thatchord #1 is smoother than chord #2, play<br>chord #1 and #3 one after another, and enjoy the perfectly consonant<br>harmonies with their thoroughly microtonal soprano line.<br><br>In ET contexts, 22 provides a good 7/4 (better than 19), and 27 and 31<br>are each progressively better yet.<br><br>Another ear-shock: 22 also has a very good 11/8. Try playing a<br>4:5:6:7:9:11 chord in 22, and you'll see what I mean. We all know that<br>in 12, we must omit the major third of this chord (5/4), but notice<br>how smooth this chord is with good 7/4 and 11/8 approximations!<br><br>--Harold<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 28 Aug 1996 17:25 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03239; Wed, 28 Aug 1996 17:27:05 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03254<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA00419; Wed, 28 Aug 1996 08:27:02 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 28 Aug 1996 08:27:02 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199608281525.IAA00324@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3490 href="#3490">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/1996 6:03:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I would think that it would be fairly easy to cut the tubes that valve tubes,<br>and easy to lengthen them (since you have a slide anyway).  <br><br>   I would imagine that you'd want to think about having a larger number of<br>valves as well.  You might, for example, want to have separate second valves for<br>1/19 down and 2/19 down (second valve is half-step down, right?  Sorry, I'm more<br>of a woodwinder).  <br><br>   Four methods of managing this sort of thing pop into mind:<br>1.  A second second-finger valve next to the existing one (i.e., closer vs. <br>    farther from the palm of the hand, not closer vs. farther from the other <br>    valves).  That's probably not a good idea from the perspective of changing<br>    fingerings in that it would be very difficult to switch from one valve on<br>    the same finger to the other.  <br>2.  Increasing the tuning differences of alternate fingerings (e.g., making <br>    first and second play 4/19 down and third play 5/19), and not necessarily<br>    increasing the number of valves.<br>3.  Add a second set of left-hand valves for similar 1/19-separated pitch <br>    relationships.  Obviously this wouldn't work too great for the horn.  <br>4.  Give the valves two or more levels (e.g., press second valve down until you<br>    bottom-out onto the relaxed setting of a second spring to go down 1/19, and<br>    then depress that second spring down 2/19).  Or if the springs can be made<br>    light enough, it may be possible to make a valve that can be pulled up or<br>    pushed down.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 29 Aug 1996 16:29 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06153; Thu, 29 Aug 1996 16:30:27 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06231<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA00580; Thu, 29 Aug 1996 07:30:26 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 29 Aug 1996 07:30:26 -0700<br>Message-Id: <009A794F8F40B1C0.092C@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
