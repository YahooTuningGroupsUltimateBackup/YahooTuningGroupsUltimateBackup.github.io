I have a guitar that has 24 frets to <br>the octave and one that has 16 frets to the octave, so<br>they're untempered. They sound like divine <br>dissonance from Venus. And I'm working on a <br>new triple-neck that has a six-string, a fretless <br>and a 12-string. It has three individual outputs <br>for three different amps. I'm writing material where <br>I'll be using all three necks at the same time.<br><br><br>I then sent it through the The Altavista Language Transmorgrafier: <br><br>http://www.archive.org/%7Eart/babelphone.html<br><br>And came up with a couple of different translations:<br><br><br>VAI: I made some things kooky which implied to divide the fretboard.<br>I have a guitar which A 24 hoops with the octave and one which have<br>16 hoops with the octave, thus they are not soaked. They resemble<br>divine dissonance of dome. And I work with a new triple-neck which<br>has a six-chain of characters, a fretless and with a 12-string. It<br>has three various outputs for three different amps. I am material of<br>writing where I will use each of the three necks at the same time.<br><br>VAI: I made some things kooky that implied to divide fretboard. I<br>have a guitar that the hoops of A 24 with eighth and one that they<br>have 16 hoops with eighth, therefore they do not soak themselves.<br>They are resembled come divine dissonance of. And work with a new<br>triple-neck that a six-linking of characters has, fretless and with<br>12-string. It has three several exits for three diverse amperes. I<br>am material of the writing where I will use each one of the three<br>necks in the same time.<br><br>VAI: I formed some things kooky, those suggest, in order to divide<br>fretboard. I have a Guitarre, which the tapes of A 24 do not soak<br>themselves with eighth and one, which they have 16 tapes with<br>eighth, therefore them. They are resembled to come divine Dissonance<br>of. And work with a new three-fold beginning, which has six six<br>linking the characters, fretless and with 12-string. It has three<br>some outputs for three different ampere. I am material of the<br>writing, in which I use each of the three beginnings in the same<br>time.<br><br>VAI: I have formed some things kooky, those I suggest, in order to<br>divide the fretboard. I have a Guitarre, than the tapes of To 24 not<br>inzuppareano same they in eighth and one, than 16 tapes with eighth,<br>therefore they. They are been similar in order coming dissonance<br>divine of. And job with a new triple beginning, that it has six six<br>to connect the characters, fretless and with 12-string. It has three<br>some escapes for three to ampï¿½re different. They are material of the<br>writing, in which use everyone of the three inizii at the same time.<br><br>-- <br>* D a v i d        B e a r d s l e y<br>*           xouoxnoREMOVE-THIS@virtulink.com<br>*<br>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br>*<br>* http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</div><h3><a id=7685 href="#7685">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/1998 7:41:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Wed, 6 May 1998, Mark Nowitzky wrote:<br>> >VAI: I've done some kooky things that involved dividing <br>> >up the fretboard.
