A pun will be heard when the ear requires<br>some reorientation, that is when the membership in the collection has been<br>altered in some way.<br><br>Think of it this way: the collection consists of those (usually) closely<br>related pitches accessable during a given time span in some music. A<br>temporal pun occurs when a single pitch from an initial collection is now<br>heard in terms of new collection. Expressed in of just intonation, _any_<br>such pun will envolve collections upon the same lattice, and puns can be<br>composed at _any_ distance on the lattice.<br><br>It is true that when the collection is ignored the function I describe is<br>identical for common tones in a tonic-dominant pair and for a more exotic<br>interval pair, the function alone is insufficient to make a pun. A pun must<br>be supported by some musical form of ''syntax'' that supports both<br>interpretations, or it will not be heard as a pun. For that reason, it has<br>to be framed in terms of distinct operative collections of pitches. I<br>assume that I needn't note that the effectiveness of an intonational pun<br>depends upon the identity of this function with that founds in familiar<br>modulations or chord changes; the difference is not strictly one of degree<br>- i.e. distance on the lattice - but of context.    <br><br>This might be positively contrasted with a pitch-saturated music like<br>Princetonian serialism, where 12 tone aggregates are the basic collections.<br>In such a music, the lack of content distinctiveness among collections<br>leads to a situation where all the puns fall flat. (Although intervallic<br>diversity may create very different lines - or lynes, as they would have it<br>- in the end all of them map onto the same set of pitches).    <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 12 May 1997 00:28 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA09393; Mon, 12 May 1997 00:28:29 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 12 May 1997 00:28:29 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09407<br>Received: (qmail 7740 invoked from network); 11 May 1997 22:28:19 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 11 May 1997 22:28:19 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.93.970512081159.20777A-100000@extro.ucc.su.OZ.AU><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
