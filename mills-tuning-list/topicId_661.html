Here's a group of people who are jealously <br>guarding Partch's instruments, so that no one else may play them, but if <br>anyone tries to play Partch's music anyway, they get branded as criminals by <br>this same group. Something's disastrously wrong here.<br><br>Bach did not approve of the pianos that existed in his time, but think how <br>valuable his music has been for centuries of piano-based composers! It is a <br>remarkable disservice to the future of xenharmonic music to keep Partch's <br>work so narrowly confined.<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 26 Jul 1996 03:41 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id SAA20541; Thu, 25 Jul 1996 18:41:28 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 25 Jul 1996 18:41:28 -0700<br>Message-Id: <memo.380561@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
