The text implies that lattice diagrams should<br>be there, but I don't have them.  One should look like this:<br><br>          9<br>         / \<br>        /   \<br>8---------4---------0<br> \    /  / \  \    / \<br>  \  6--/---\--2  /   \<br>   \   /  9---------5  \<br>    \ /    \  \ /  /    \<br>     1------\--7--/------3<br>             \   /<br>              \ /<br>               2<br><br>The numbers show decatonic steps, hence there are 10 of them(!)<br>This is the following mode:<br><br>0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0<br>  2  2  2  3  2  2  2  3  2  2  =22<br><br>It doesn't seem to be any of the named scales, but no matter.<br>If you bring 6-9-2-4 and 9-2-5-7 together, you get this:<br><br><br>          9---------5<br>         / \       /<br>        /   \  7  /<br>8---------4---------0<br> \    /  / \  \ /  / \<br>  \  6--/---\--2  /   \<br>   \   /  9  \   /  5  \<br>    \ /       \ /       \<br>     1---------7---------3<br><br>This has some advantages with 5- or 15-limit harmony, but not<br>really the strict 7-limit decatonic tonality.  I could pretend<br>this is the 3 comma tuning I was thinking of, but actually I lost<br>the bit of paper I originally worked it out on, and misremembered<br>the number of commas I got.  I decided to post anyway, because I<br>wanted to start a discussion on this.<br><br>For the pentachordal modes, I reckon tuning to 53-equal is an<br>option.  I think the 50/49 is only one step, and so comma sized.<br>Crucially, 1/53 is smaller than half 1/22, so there's no ambiguity.<br>The 7-limit chords are tuned significantly better than in 22-equal,<br>so there is an advantage to offset the presence of the commas.<br><br>My point about tuning tritones isn't quite covered in Paul's paper.<br>To quote: "Since any perfect 6th10 in the scale is likely to<br>represent 7:5 and 10:7 equally often, the interval achieves its<br>greatest accuracy at exactly 600 cents."  No, at least 1 of the 4<br>tritones in a pentachordal scale has only one interpretation.  My<br>point is that, as at least two have to be ambiguous, these worst<br>intervals in 22-equal can't be improved by any tempering.  A well<br>temperament may improve the average tuning, though, and I haven't<br>looked at this properly yet.<br><br>The symmetrical modes require a lot more commas, and so there's<br>no point in using more than the 10 notes unless you really know<br>what you're doing.<br><br><br>These 3-dimensional lattices are definitely fcc, aren't they?<br>I thought they were hexagonal close packing before, but I was<br>wrong.  There is a difference.<br><br>In abstract terms, the point of fcc is that, along with hcp, it<br>has the highest possible packing fraction for spheres.  That's why<br>it's so common in crystals.  The musical relevance of the<br>dodecahedra (which are apparently rhombic) is as follows.  Consider<br>one point on a lattice.  That point is directly connected to 12<br>other points.  These correspond to the 12 faces of the<br>dodecahedron.  The lattice looks the same from each point and so<br>is regular.  Furthermore, the 12 points correspond to the 12<br>7-limit intervals within an octave:<br><br>                       5/3-------5/4<br>                       / \       / \<br>                      /   \10/7 /   \<br>   O   O             / 7/6 \   / 7/4 \<br>     |              /       \ /       \<br>   \___/          4/3-------1/1-------3/2<br>                    \       / \       /<br>                     \ 8/7 /   \12/7 /<br>                      \   / 7/5 \   /<br>                       \ /       \ /<br>                       8/5-------6/5<br><br>And there's probably a name for that structure, maybe 7-limit<br>tonality diamond.<br><br>I am of the opinion that these lattices are the best way of<br>representing 7-limit octave invariant scales most of the time.<br>When you bring the octaves into it, it makes more sense to use<br>hypercubes.  Or, at least, matrices with a rectangular distance<br>function.  I, for one, have difficulty in visualising four<br>dimensions.<br><br>In case people are getting deluged with all this theory, I'll<br>highlight the point that these lattices are very useful for<br>constructing 7-limit scales, and taking chords from them.  There,<br>I've done it.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
