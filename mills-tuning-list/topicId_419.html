Its innovative features and<br>careful<br>design, result of 6 years of research and development, provide developers with<br>a powerful and efficient toolbox for developing professional Midi applications.<br><br>MidiShare is based on a client/server model. It is composed of four main<br>components : an event manager, a time manager, a task manager and a<br>communication manager. The event manager provides an uniform way to process<br>and store midi events. The time manager and the task manager control the<br>real-time behavior of applications. The communication manager is in charge<br>of both inter-applications and midi communications.<br><br>The system can be delivered for Apple Macintosh or Atari computers and now<br>PC under Windows 3.x and Windows 95.<br><br>MidiShare  version 1.54 for Windows is delivered as a 16 Bit Dll, support<br>up to 64<br>client applications, and 256 Midi ports. Interfaces are available for C,C++<br>and Common Lisp.<br><br>                        - TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS -<br><br>MidiShare offers several advantages to developers in terms of code efficiency,<br>portability and easiness of developing sophisticated real time Midi<br>applications. It avoids many complexities and limitations of other Midi<br>operating systems.<br><br>Communications are based on high level events instead of packets of midi<br>bytes. These events are easier and faster to process than packets of Midi<br>bytes. For example large system exclusive messages never need to be splitted<br>into multiple packets. They are sent, received and processed as a whole like<br>any other Midi events. Events are not limited to strict Midi messages.<br>MidiShare offers full support for Midi File 1.0 events and future versions<br>will provide additional events for multimedia.<br><br>The communication manager allows multi-ports configurations (up to 256 physical<br>ports) to be easily handled. All MidiShare events are stamped with a full Midi<br>device address defined by a physical port number and a Midi channel. Client<br>applications just need one input point and one output point to communicate with<br>all the Midi devices (up to 4096 devices). Connections between applications are<br>easier for users. Application code is simpler and the full device address of an<br>event is never lost during inter-application communications.<br><br>MidiShare includes its own dynamic memory manager, specially designed for<br>real-time operations at interrupt level. This provides applications with a<br>convenient and efficient way for storing, copying and deleting Midi events<br>without using the host memory manager. All MidiShare internal buffers and<br>queues are dynamically sized avoiding overflow problems encountered in<br>other systems.<br><br>Several mechanisms are proposed to control the real time behavior of Midi<br>applications. The time manager offers 1ms resolution and supports accurate<br>SMPTE synchronization in a transparent way.  Application functions called<br>alarms  can be installed to deal with incoming events in real time at<br>interrupt level.<br><br>The heart of MidiShare is a real time scheduler. It allows events to be sent<br>in the future as well as delayed function calls (functions to be called in<br>the future). Delayed function call is a very fast and powerful mechanism for<br>complex multi-tasking applications when multiple computing need to be done<br>in parallel. A proprietary scheduling algorithm ensures a very low constant<br>time scheduling costs per event, even when the scheduler is heavily loaded.<br><br><br>MidiShare is a freeware software. It has been developed at GRAME.
