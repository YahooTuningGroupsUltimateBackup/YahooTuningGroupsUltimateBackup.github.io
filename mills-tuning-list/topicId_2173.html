I find Partch's treatment of the subject to be<br>somewhat muddy.  He definitely refers to a 9 limit, therefore, he<br>does not limit his limits to prime numbers.<br><br>I did a few minutes of research to find out what he really was<br>trying to say, and was referred to "identity" which was defined<br>in terms of "correlatives" and "pole of tonality", but I didn't<br>find a definition for "pole of tonality", or "correlatives".<br><br>I know that some of you out there probably have gone much deeper<br>into his work, and understand to some degree what he really may<br>have meant by all this, but I wonder at the utility of taking the<br>very simple concept of "prime limit" and confusing it with some<br>other, much more elaborate concept.  Perhaps Partch's concept,<br>whatever it was, could have been better expressed in other terms<br>than "limit".  My understanding is that the term was pretty well<br>defined to be something else when he did his work.<br><br>I find the concept of "prime limit" to be very useful, but I am<br>not convinced of the utility of Partch's concept of limit for my<br>view of diatonic harmony.<br><br>For me, the whole "lattice" approach is much less useful than<br>Aliquot Parts and Least Common Multiple for analyzing scales,<br>chords, and intervals.<br><br>Marion<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 28 Jun 1997 19:11 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18913; Sat, 28 Jun 1997 19:11:45 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 28 Jun 1997 19:11:45 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14412<br>Received: (qmail 4393 invoked from network); 28 Jun 1997 17:11:32 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 28 Jun 1997 17:11:32 -0000<br>Message-Id: <17181797810146@cybersim.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
