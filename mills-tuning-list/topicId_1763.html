Likewise, in the early <br>18th century, well-temperament would not have been adopted as a <br>keyboard norm if meantone temperaments answered all the needs of <br>musicians and composers at this time. No tuning is superior <br>simpliciter, but only superior (if at all) in relation to a specified <br>musical repertoire.<br><br>> ... in practice<br>> a well temperament is better even for serialism than a blank<br>> ET. It is true that one might want to retune keyboards in serial<br>> pieces from section to section, or even phrase to phrase, but<br>> that is no insurmountable problem with electronic instruments.<br><br>How so? What advantages could any well-temperament possibly offer for <br>serial music? Well-temperaments took the form they did because in the <br>period 1700-50 "white-notes" keys predominated, and modulations were <br>mainly local and not very far reaching, but the exceptions were <br>frequent enough for some compromise to be desirable (a compromise not <br>available within meantone systems, even given a couple of split keys). <br>Thus C major receives good (i.e. 5/4 or close) major thirds, while F# <br>major has to make do with near Pythagorean major thirds. <br>Well-temperaments were thus designed entirely to cope best with the <br>characteristics of the music of this period. Serial music shares none <br>of these characteristics; playing it on a well-tempered keyboard is no <br>doubt harmless fun, but to make claims that it _ought_ to be played <br>thus seem quite baseless.<br><br>-- <br>Jonathan Walker<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 13:08 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02827; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 13:08:03 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02852<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id EAA19419; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 04:06:21 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 3 Mar 1997 04:06:21 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.970303060646.18729B-100000@library><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4960 href="#4960">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/1997 4:19:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Mon, 3 Mar 1997, Jonathan Walker wrote:<br>> How so?
