Wait a minute?  Where did this come from?<br><br>I don't know where it came from, but it's true. Even Mathieu admits that<br>a 12-tone chromatic scale is melodically smoother in 12tET than in an<br>unequal tuning.<br><br>>This brings up the subject of the two schools of Equal Temperament.  On the<br>>left we have those who want to approximate Just Intonation.  Erlich and<br>>Hahn are of this school.  They want a tuning be consistent and fairly<br>>accurate at a given limit before considering it usable at any higher limit.<br><br>Note that in my paper, as clarified by you (Carl Lumma), I do not care<br>about the 5-limit accuracy of 22tET, only that its 7-limit accuracy be<br>at least as great as the 5-limit accuracy of 12tET. Also, I am<br>interested in scales that fulfill some but not all of the properties of<br>diatonicity as outlined in my paper, such as Blackwood's 10-note scale<br>in 15tET and a couple of 14-note scales in 26tET.<br><br>>On the right we have those who insist that any ET is usable and "good".<br>>Students of this school include Ivor Darreg and Easley Blackwood.<br><br>Actually, Easley Blackwood thinks that 12tET is much more usable and<br>"good" than any other tuning. See the interview in PNM. The funny thing<br>is that Blackwood's microtonal music is generally much better than<br>Darreg's.<br><br>>the best 11/9 will be off by the absolute value of the sums of<br>>the errors of the 11/8 and 9/8, consistency or no<br><br>If you mean the best 11/8 and the best 9/8, then that might not be true,<br>although consistency will guarantee that it's true. If you don't mean<br>the best 11/8 and the best 9/8, then what do you mean?<br><br>>On the other hand, 25<br>>isn't consistent past the five limit, and it has horrible fifths, but its<br>>strong 3's and 7's make it great for the 7-limit, as Paul Rapaport proved<br>>in his "Study in Fives".<br><br>Did you mean horrible thirds or strong 5s?</div><h3><a id=7823 href="#7823">ðŸ”—</a>Rick Sanford &#x3C;76122.2237@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/1998 8:22:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Topic No. 10<br><br>Hello:<br><br>There's no such thing as atonal serialism. <br>Reading shabby translations of Sch*nberg will not help<br>one understand serialism. <br>One must approach Babbitt and the time-point system to<br>have a grasp of serialism. <br><br>>Do you make a distinction between serialism and<br>>atonal serialism?

Tonal harmony, as used during the so-called<br>"common practice" period 1600-1900, developed mainly out of<br>the fixing of pitches as absolute values (especially in notation),<br>the recognition of 5-limit ratios as consonances, and the intuitive<br>realization that because ratios have two terms, they are<br>related to other ratios in two different ways (Partch's<br>"Basic Monophonic Concept #2": "every ratio of a Monophonic<br>system is at least a dual identity"; "Genesis", p. 88), giving<br>rise to the major/ minor system.<br><br>In fact, assuming a tuning in 5-limit JI (or a meantone<br>which approximates 5-ratios well), the tritone could be one<br>of four ratios, all of which, while much less dissonant than<br>the Pythagorean tritones:<br>3^6		729/512		6.12	aug 4th<br>3^-6		1024/729	5.88	dim 5th<br>were pretty much at, if not beyond, the limit of what could<br>be considered consonant:<br>3^2 * 5^-2	36/25	6.31	dim 5th<br>3^-2 * 5^-1	64/45	6.10	dim 5th<br>3^2 * 5^1	45/32	5.90	aug 4th<br>3^-2 * 5^2	25/18	5.69	aug 4th<br><br>The 64/45 would normally be considered the tritone which appears<br>in the 5-limit Dominant 7th chord of 36:45:54:64.  4:5:6:7 is the<br>same as 36:45:54:63.<br>---------------------------------------------------------<br>> [Monzo:]<br>>> (I'd really like to see more feedback about microtonality in<br>>> the blues.)<br><br>> [Erlich:]<br>> I think this is a great topic, but I don't think ratios of large<br>numbers<br>> have much to do with it. I do think that many blues performers do<br>> distinguish between 6/5 and 7/6, however, as well as approaching a<br>> pentatonic scale in 7tET.<br><br>I'm certain that some blues vocalists distinguish between 6/5 and<br>7/6, and in Robert Johnson's vocals, I've heard a "sharp 9th" which<br>sounds to me like it starts as a 7/6 then slides upward to a 19/16 -<br>exactly the pitches we debated in the "Hendrix Chord", so my ears<br>are especially sensitive to this distinction.  Johnson in particular<br>exhibits<br>such minute pitch discrimination in his vocals that I'm sure his "odd<br>limit"<br>is _well_  above 7 or 9.<br>======================================<br>Mark Nowitzky wrote:<br><br>> P.S.:  Bassoons, on a sustained low note, also sometimes<br>> sound to me like some sort of electrical problem.<br><br>You should hear some of the sounds Johnny Reinhard<br>gets out of his axe!
