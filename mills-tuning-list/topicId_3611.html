Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/1998 12:19:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>I was intriguedt upon re-reading this:<br><br>[Paul Erlich:]<br>>> Harmonically speaking, an interval is never more<br>>> likely to be interpreted as a higher-odd-limit, lower-prime-limit<br>>> ratio than a higher-prime-limit, lower odd-limit ratio,<br>>> holding the approximation error constant.<br> <br>[Monzo:]<br>>Doesn't this support my theory that primes have<br>>unique properties that allow them to be easily<br>>identified?  It seems strange coming from you,<br>>since you say you disagree with this theory.<br><br>No, it doesn't support your theory at all.<br><br>>As an example, say we're examining an "augmented 5th"<br>>or "minor 6th" of 807 cents.  This is exactly midway<br>>(in cents) between the proportions 26:16 (= 13:8)<br>>and 25:16.  Are you saying that the interval would be<br>>recognized as 13 (= 13^1) rather than as 25 (= 5^2),<br>>because 13 is a higher prime than 5, but a lower odd<br>>number than 25?<br><br>I would say that this interval is more likely to be heard as 13/8 than<br>25/16 because 13 is a lower odd number than 25. Of course, there are<br>other ratios that this interval is even more likely to be heard as. I<br>brought in the point about primes simply to point out that simple prime<br>factors _don't_ count for much acoustically, and that ratios like 64:45,<br>despite their low prime factors, are never really the just "target" for<br>a harmonic interval.<br><br>>That's what it sounds like you're saying to me, and it<br>>seems contradictory to everything you've written on<br>>the subject so far.<br><br>If you really think so, then I must suppose you have really failed to<br>understand my views. No offense, but my honest opinion is that, rather<br>than trying to penetrate a theory or style of music and see it as a<br>logically or aesthetically consistent whole, you focus on whatever<br>elements fit into your point of view, whether you're talking about<br>Schoenberg, Robert Johnson, or me.</div>
