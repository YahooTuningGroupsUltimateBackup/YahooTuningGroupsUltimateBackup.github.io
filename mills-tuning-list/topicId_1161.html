He's kidding, isn't he?  This can't be real, can it??<br><br>Well, enough have weighed in.  Many have been quick and merciful in pointing<br>out the obvious.  As for me, I figure anyone who pans any life system as big<br>as the WWW (not to mention the entire net) after only four hours of<br>amateurish searching must need a wheelbarrow to transport their gonads.<br><br>So Brian says:<br>>[B] somebody named Harry Partch did something in connection with<br>>microtonality, but he's obviously not worth bothering with because no<br>>info is available about him<br><br>Not to mention the British Harry Partch Society web site (which has a page<br>of microtonal resources), it makes me wonder what brought the visitors to<br>Corporeal Meadows for the last 10 weeks - dumb luck?  No, the keywords <META<br>NAME="keywords"> for the gateway page are (in order):<br><br>   Partch corporeal just intonation microtonal<br><br>and this site has been submitted to as many submittal places and search<br>engines as I can find.  Of course some take a while to add to their indices,<br>but I can't help that.  I'll be here for a while and meantime, something is<br>obviously working.  Brian is obviously not.  <br><br>He slams all but Manuel for not including [...many things...], and lo and<br>behold, some of those 'things' are right there on the Meadows; kind of<br>insulting.  Finally, since designing the site is *not* an occupation, but a<br>service I am providing out of the goodness of my heart (and pocketbook),<br>well, you'll see...<br><br>But I smile when I see:<br>>    If you have a web site or ftp site for microtonal music, please <br>>add it to the Virtual Library at <br>>http://www.w3.org/pub/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html<br><br>John Starrett showing just how to get things happening, in three little<br>lines.  Wonderful contribution!  I agree when John says:<br><br>>Finally, I like Brian (never met him). I like passionate people.  They are <br>>interesting, but sometimes a pain in the ass. When one of them  explodes <br>>all over his friends, neighbors and enemies alike, one expects  that is <br>>for a good reason, and one expects changes will then occur.  Since Brian <br>>has thrown down the gauntlet in his own court, and with such  force, I <br>>expect nothing short of perfection, and soon. <br><br>With that in mind, and the following:<br><br>>Brian McLaren will be in the San Diego area for the next several months...<br><br>I just can't pass up and opportunity like this.  Please note that the Sonic<br>Arts Gallery is not just in my neck of the woods, but mere *blocks* from my<br>house, I haven't seen Jonathan Glasier in a long time (overdue), and I am<br>feeling frisky.  I'm not gigging on Dec. 7th, so I hope to make it to the<br>concert.<br><br>Yes, I am going to meet Brian McLaren, and find out what's up.  To<br>paraphrase David Brinkley, I may not be able to be objective but I can try<br>to be fair.  I'll be sure and let you know exactly when the Brian McLaren<br>Home Page / Microtonality Central is on the WWW; I can post my *own* email <g>.<br><br>Am I nuts or what?  Must be the single malt talking...<br><br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br>*--------------------------------------------------------------------*<br>   Jonathan M.
