I depart to spend the Thanksgiving holidays with my<br>parents and return to a veritable geyser of gainsaying from Mr.<br>McLaren; It would appear that a fair number of the rest of you have<br>dealt in an interesting and straightforward way with the vituperative<br>vortex/Philippic plume, so I'll merely mention that Brian has about<br>as nuanced a grasp of the notions of sociolinguistics as he's brought<br>to bear previously in the notion of Canonicity. There is, thankfully,<br>*no* single fulminatory being who is free to use his/her copy of the<br>lexicon as something with which to beat others; definitions of all sorts<br>are constantly negotiated - meanings drift and change according to all<br>sorts of contexts and even among members of the communities who<br>would generally agree on a given meaning. Some of the ongoing and<br>exceedlingly interesting discussions here on notions of terminology<br>and strategies for naming and notation are, in fact, examples of that<br>very thing in action. Most, if not all, of the sociolinguists with whom<br>I am socially acquainted (they can be a fun lot. One of my wife's students<br>is looking at the way that Dutch acquired the reflexive verb by looking<br>at letters, diaries and municipal records in the City of Haarlem's<br>population. As a side effect, Jen regales us with tales of the seige of<br>Haarlem as recorded by the common folk in addition to the more "hard"<br>research side of it) seem to view that kind of drift and fuzziness *not*<br>as evidence of some dreadful inexactitude which must be cleansed to<br>assure conceptual purity, but as the kind of sparks thrown off the<br>great Catherine Wheel of social construction - be it art, or music, or<br>new ways of telling fish stories. As the estimable Mr. Lyon has pointed<br>out so succinctly, one of the reasons that John Cage remains a central<br>figure in the musical and aesthetic practice of this century is that he<br>provides some singular examples of the ways that one can puah and<br>tease the "certainties" of definition to reveal new ways of thinking or<br>working, or to reveal previously unrecognized modalities which<br>situate themselves in what seems to be "common" practice. Indeed,<br>one might suggest that some of us might hope to see ourselves as<br>being engaged in a similar kind of work - and I, for one, remain<br>convinced that the most productive way to engage in that dialogue<br>involves the belief that the best aesthetic situation is one in which<br>*no one* [not even me :-) ] has the last word. With every outburst<br>of the sort I've seen from him recently, I grow more convinced that<br>some part of the poverty of Brian's delusional edifice is that he seems<br>only to understand music as some kind of zero-sum game; it's the<br>only explanation I can come up with for his seeming desire to replace<br>one sort of orthodoxy he despises with his own. To quote Pete Townsend,<br>"Meet the new boss/same as the old boss." I think it's sad.<br><br>And who on earth taught him to define "algorithmic composition" in<br>the way that he does? Sure wasn't Bill Schottstaedt. It *sure* wasn't<br>anyone I ever sat at the feet of....<br><br>With regards,<br>Gregory Taylor<br><br>_<br>I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,<br>paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only<br>maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it.
