If you're working with 1200-cent octaves with 12 <br>division, you can do one octave and the Proteus will duplicate it; <br>otherwise, you're stuck with doing all of them. Of course, in Vision <br>it's up to you to keep track of what, say, "D#3" _really_ is (I use MAX, <br>so they're all just numbers to me).<br><br>The disadvantage is that (for what I assume are floating-point limits or <br>some such -- any ideas out there?) once you type in, say, 98, it <br>recalculates to, maybe, 97.8682. (as I said, it may not be critical <br>enough for your purposes.) The recalculation seems to stay within LND, <br>though, and my poor shell-shocked ears think my stuff sounds ok (tho' <br>there's a reason I'm doing this stuff with computers instead of string <br>instruments).<br><br>I have a question about the Proteus itself (and the use of samples of <br>conventional instruments in general) in tunings other than those they <br>were designed for; aren't the resonating parts of the instruments <br>designed to "sweeten" partials (by, for example, shaving miniscule <br>amounts of wood from the inside of the body) which may not be present if <br>the fundamental has been retuned (or more to the point here, are we <br>hearing partials we wouldn't be if we were playing a _real_ instrument <br>in that tuning)? (Sorry if the question seems naive (or incomprehensibly <br>phrased) -- I just have to wonder how accurate my experience of these <br>tunings is...) <br><br>-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- / -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- / -- -- -- -- -- /<br> /                               /                 /<br>   /     /   Notions of freedom are tied up with drink<br>  /                                                 Malcolm Lowry<br> /                      /          /         <br> /           Jim Flannery            /          newgrange@sfo.com<br>/            Newgrange Media<br>-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- / -- -- -- -- -- / -- ---- -- -- -- -- -- /<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 3 Mar 1996 13:47 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id EAA06817; Sun, 3 Mar 1996 04:46:49 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 3 Mar 1996 04:46:49 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199603031244.HAA15239@freenet3.carleton.ca><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
