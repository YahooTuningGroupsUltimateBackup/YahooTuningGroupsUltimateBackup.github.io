Any thoughts are surely <br>>>appreciated....thanks...Hstick<br><br>Neil: - I was waiting for John's succinct response myself, but I'll <br>throw in that tetras operate as three-interval sets below an initial<br>tone.  Then began being joined as pairs, with a 'diazeuksis' separating, <br>ending up with octave closure.  That's how I think of tetrachords.<br>John's articles and book are much more informed.  Joscelyn Godwin<br>also expresses their origins and simplicity very well in "harmonies<br>of heaven and earth"</div>
