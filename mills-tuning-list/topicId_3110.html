It's<br>basically whatever manufacturers have decided to implement.  95% of MIDI<br>instruments implement 8 bit pitch bend controllers and more recent ones<br>may be 10 bit.  The only full 14 bit controller is the Moog MIDI<br>Theremin.<br><br>How reception is implemented would likewise be manufacturer and<br>instrument specific.  Conceivably members of the same instrument family<br>(like all Sound Canvas products) could vary in implementation, though<br>this is unlikely since operating code and hardware is usually recycled<br>from generation to generation.  Even though the Sound Canvas does not<br>quantize pitch bend reception to 8 bits it is possible that other<br>instruments do.<br><br>What you have uncovered is the underlying pitch resolution or pitch<br>quantization of the instrument, whether adjusted by pitch bend or any<br>other controller, envelope, LFO, etc.  Manufacturers (except Symbolic<br>Sound and Justonic) never publish these specs, and very few people have<br>investigated them.  Generally the pitch resolution is in the 0.50 to<br>1.56 cent range for wavetable/sampler type instruments and is limited by<br>hardware.  It would be interesting to see if the newer DSP based<br>physical modeling synthesizers have better pitch resolution, though most<br>of these do not support tuning tables.<br><br>The change in timbre you hear is probably due to the sample<br>interpolation scheme used by the Sound Canvas hardware.<br><br>John Loffink<br>john.loffink@compaq.com<br><br>><br>>     Does anyone know of an authoritative definition of pitch bend<br>>resolution?  I used to think it was obvious.  I used to think that if<br>>a sound module had a pitch bend resolution of, say, 8 bits, that meant<br>>that whenever it received a 14-bit pitch bend signal it used only the<br>>leading 8 bits and ignored the remaining 6.  But then I did some<br>>experimentation and discovered that this is far from the case.<br>>--------------------------- (snip)<br>>     The absolute error in pitch introduced by resolution coarseness<br>>stays constant.  For the Sound Canvas the pitch always changes in<br>>minimal increments of 1.56 cents.  This can be calculated e.g. from<br>>the first line of the above table (200 cents divided by 2 to 7th<br>>power), but the same result is obtained if it is calculated from any<br>>other line.  Hence, regardless of the range setting, 1.56 cents is<br>>always the maximum tuning error the Sound Canvas introduces into a<br>>played interval due to problems of resolution.  The average error over<br>>many played intervals could be expected to be about half that.<br>><br>>     --Bill Cooper<br>>       U. of Calif., Berkeley<br>><br>><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Subject:  forum CD<br>PostedDate:  04-02-98 20:03:05<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  04-02-98 20:02:03-04-02-98 20:02:04,04-02-98 20:00:38-04-02-98 20:00:38<br>DeliveredDate:  04-02-98 20:00:38<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C12565A1.00688D0C; Wed, 4 Feb 1998 20:01:58 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08020; Wed, 4 Feb 1998 20:03:05 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 4 Feb 1998 20:03:05 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08023<br>Received: (qmail 12468 invoked from network); 4 Feb 1998 11:02:17 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 4 Feb 1998 11:02:17 -0800<br>Message-Id: <34D8C26A.723C@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
