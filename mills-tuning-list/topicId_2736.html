I am indeed serious. Of<br>>course anyone can distinguish between tones as little as 5-10 cents<br>>apart in successive hearings. But if one substitutes one such tone for<br>>the other in a given melody, not one person in a thousand will identify<br>>that _melody_ as different.<br><br>The same is true if I change tones by 100 cents. In other words, if I put<br>"Happy Birthday" into a minor key, people will still recognize it as "Happy<br>Birthday," albeit with a rather different sound. The same is true for much<br>smaller intervals. The psychological mechanisms for recognizing melodies<br>depends on a lot more than the absolute sizes of successive intervals.<br>Anyway, I do not choose tuning systems to make sure that a melody is<br>perceived as different if I choose a slightly altered set of intervals.<br><br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
