I have the record<br>companies permission to give ordering information to my 'net contacts first,<br>and then distribution should be through Allegro, so for those that want one,<br>the first place to get it  will be told here the list here, then hopefully,<br>anywhere.    <br>     All the recording is done, the 4,880 words of liner notes are completed,<br>(I have posted them on the Classica list, but don't know if Tuning wants that<br>much basic stuff posted,  there IS a strong streak of McClaren that installed<br>itself in the philosophy of where all these notes came from.......)<br><br>>In early-music concerts, it is customary to identify in the program notes   <br>>the keyboard instruments that are used (who built them, where, and when).   <br>       Ours would read: Steinway D, built by S&S,  New York, 1980. <br><br>>Perhaps it would help the "temperament crusade" to identify the   <br>>temperaments as well (and not just for the keyboards, come to think of   <br>>it).  It would encourage the audience to think about them and listen for   <br>>the differences.<br><br>       Dang right!  I been talking about Mr. Prinz etal. so much,  that most<br>of my temperament customers, ( and a varied lot they are!), pretty much have<br>a level of max dissonance and a chronological placement associated with<br><br>several temperaments.  Some of the really savvy ones have been able to<br>discuss the relative increase "curve" in key colors between two.  ( Well,<br> the difference between a Werckmiester and a Young, I know isn't too<br>dramatic,  but we are getting there)<br> <br>> Is it just coincidence that the more prevalent   <br>>12TET has become the more string players and singers have used vibrato?<br><br>     I don't "know"  what was done before, so am unable to draw much of a<br>comparison. I think they are using much vibrato now because they are torn<br>between  the ET note , and a note that just musically screams to be used,  (<br>how's that for a technical description of schizoid intonation?)<br>     <br> >In concerts that have pieces both for strings alone and for strings with   <br>>piano, I have never heard the audience talking about the temperament(s)   <br>>used.  I don't think most of them listen closely enough (or know what to   <br>>listen for) to tell the difference.  <br>     The response I have gotten from the performers leads me to think that<br>the effects of leaving ET are strong, but not directly apparent to the<br>audience.  This is based on the reaction I have been getting from, (among<br>others) vocalists.  They say that once the alien nature of well temperament<br>dissipates, ( usually one accompanied song is all that is required to melt<br>the ice, if you don't push them....) they find that it is much easier to hit<br>pitches, they are no longer forced to put notes in what seem to be<br>"artificial places",  and they find a real security with that tonal center.  <br>       With that security, phrasing and inflection take less effort. There is<br>freedom to be creative that comes from this sort of security. I can liken it<br>to what happens when you get the suspension just perfect on a good<br>motorcycle,  all of a sudden, you can drive it anywhere on the track,   able<br>to change lines when you want or need to. The "zone" gets more of a neural<br>address.  (Hmmm,  might be getting a little too far out) <br>    One other telling moment came when we( my artist/conspirator and I),<br> used the Young temperament for Beethoven's  third concerto, ( without<br>telling anyone).  The dean of the school found me later and said that he had<br>never heard a piano sound so good in front of the symphony like that, That it<br>stood out like never before.  There were numerous comments about how<br>incredibly tense the artist was able to make the middle section seem .  It<br>appears to have  had an effect, but it is a deeper effect than  words do<br>justice.  I think the piano temperaments might be more of a subliminal thing,<br>but I don't use that word out there in customer-land;  it scares'em,<br> makes'em  think of UFOs and stuff.  <br> <br>>But you do seem to agree that even the performers don't realize they're   <br>>not playing in 12TET.<br>    Sadly, yes.  I have heard incredible musicians tell me that they prefer<br> ET  because that is what they have played with for so long that they play in<br>ET.  Then they go right out there and play perfect thirds and fifths and<br>everything else, ( if they can).  It takes more than tact to be able to tell<br>a musician that they are not listening.  If handled carelessly, it can often<br>mark the low point of a conversation. <br><br>>I agree that it is not difficult to determine a musically appropriate   <br>>temperament, but "works best" and "intended" are quite different things. <br><br>    Yes,  I agree, but Perhaps for different reasons? ,i.e.  What was<br>"intended" is, by now,  a "debated-to-death" point.  Most of the research has<br>been done.  All the choices have been pretty well identified;" take your<br>pick"?  None of us were there, so we accept this huge circumstantial body of<br>lore.  I can't argue with that, what else is there?<br>     "Works Best" is another thing entirely.  We can do stuff with that!  To<br>investigate what "works best" doesn't depend on balancing the weight of<br>documents or "learned opinions",  but rather, listening to temperaments,<br>getting ones ears attuned to contrasts.  The neophyte's reactions are as<br>valid as the old pro, when given a tonal palette to listen to. <br>      Once some temperament recognition takes place,  12TET suddenly becomes<br>an identifiable sound of its own, rather than a gray, seamless backdrop.<br> There is a threshold there, that I think it beneficial to push as many<br>people  across as possible. I hope some of them may then wander into the<br>realm of microtonality, which is where tomorrow's temperament is going to<br>come from.  It could happen!!<br>     These choices give us room to make musical judgements, it gives us<br>something to debate.  When people listen to different tunings,  they can have<br>a meeting of the minds over a real thing;  if somebody asks what dissonance<br>is, you can show them.  They can instantly know what the other accepts.<br>    The only way to carry the field in an "intention" discussion is to gather<br>more evidence to your side.  The way to prove a point in a "Works Best"<br>debate is to listen, in real time.  There is the possibility that there will<br>be two winners, as both may profit and advance by the experience.  <br>      The quality of temperament's effects on music is an ineffable quality.<br> It is communication that occurs along the emotional circuitry, not the<br>intellectual,  and that is a real problem in selling the point via the<br>written medium.   We are not inclined to be "emotional" with music these<br>days, and if we are,  we often describe how in intellectual ways.  I think<br>that is a shame, but it can be fixed.     <br>      Since I can use a tuning hammer,  and have a lot of pianos around me,<br> I am able to make some changes in people's attitudes that talking just would<br>not do.  It amazed me how quickly people could have their sense of tonality<br>awaken.  At least with familiar music. Thus,  the CD.  <br>      I have been on this list, fascinated by these synth. tuning constructs<br>that the "math monsters" are able to banter on about, and intriqued by the<br>guitar stuff on refrets, as well as the avante-garde direction.  I don't know<br>where another group of people like this can be found. ( though I do miss the<br>female's perspective, seems  it is mostly us guys out here in the harmonic<br>woodshed).   I can see how the public, ( that timid heard),  is a hard sell<br>for something so esoteric as the 19-tone guitar, or as radical as  26 13/45<br>wombat-comma supertone-tuning.  <br>      I really hope to see the day that current music comes from many<br>different temperaments.  It is one reason I am so happy to keep a country<br>recording studio here in a Young well temperament.  The guys at this place<br>have now "discovered" how good a harmonium sounds,  and the hurdy-gurdy has<br>been wielded in the tracks like it was on home base.  <br>     <br> >Just to mention a couple examples, what temperament did Bach intend for   <br>>the WTC,  and what did John Bull intend for his Hexachord Fantasia?<br> John Bull would be better discussed by those who know more than I.  <br>      It seems reasonable that Bach wanted a "Harmonic Toolbox",  (my term<br>for a good well temperament).  Who knows which one? However,  the difference<br>between a Werckmiester and and a Young is not as great as the difference<br>between 12TET and either of them. <br>     It appears that the WTC I gains improvement with the slightest WT, and<br>gets  progressively better all the way back to Werckmiester's roughest!  I<br>know of at least one tuner that chases the genre back into meantone<br>territory, but that starts making me think of Jimi Hendrix at times.   Even<br>with all the tempering I wallow around in,  my ears are still developing,  it<br>could happen to anybody. <br><br>Thanks for the note and excuse the bandwidth I may be sloshing into<br>undesiring mailboxes.....  <br>  <br>Ed Foote, <br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn<br>( out of town and touch for the next week, but still getting the digest , I<br>hate to be gone when the thread runs deep, but alas, the beach and Daddy-hood<br>call)<br> <br>    <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 20 Jun 1997 19:02 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01517; Fri, 7 Feb 1997 01:00:44 +0100<br>Date: Fri, 7 Feb 1997 01:00:44 +0100<br>From: <tuning@eartha.mills.edu><br>Message-Id: <9702070000.AA01517@ns.ezh.nl><br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00357<br>Apparently-To: <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl><br><br>Received: (qmail 24401 invoked from network); 20 Jun 1997 16:55:47 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v02130500afd065bd2fde@[128.32.122.22]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
