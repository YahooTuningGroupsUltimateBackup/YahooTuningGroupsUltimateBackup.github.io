After reading the things he s<br>ent to me....I began to feel like asking more about it. But, instead of sendin<br>g an extra duty to him....If it could be a suitable subject over here...I want<br> to try sending maybe FAQ kind of Question to this m-list. My question goes as<br> follows...<br>  <br>  So the 88CET music would be a multi-tonal system? If I'm not making mistake,<br> it sounds like as if each half-tones becoming 88cents. If so...can it be said<br> that each note can become a root just by the choice of it's attendants? Ah! T<br>hat was what the 100cents for each half-tone was trying to make possible...but<br> couldn't really do. 88CET can make it more natural, right?<br>  I came up to this kind of idea...what about it? If the 7:4 means a lot to ma<br>ke the hole things sound natural in it's vicnity, can't it also become a struc<br>tural backbone for the scale the music use for it's melody? What happens if we<br> picked up the NEXT note just by choosing the one that has 7:4 frequency...I m<br>ean instead of choosing the fifth. Can we meet the fifth somewhere? I'm really<br> just asking because I don't have the answer. Why I'm making this kind of irre<br>sponsible noise is because that I thought t<br>he whole thing sounds something similar to the fractal-graphics....outlook str<br>ucture having a similarity to the inner structure....if that could be the othe<br>r aspect of 88CET...to me...I seems more interesting than the natural harmony <br>it actually can make....<br>  Well, JUST A NOIZE from my strange dream.<br><br>BUYO-BUYO-IGOR=Masaaki Tsuji>>>cxl03253@niftyserve.or.jp<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 24 Feb 1996 18:58 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA12495; Sat, 24 Feb 1996 09:57:48 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 24 Feb 1996 09:57:48 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.91.960224113926.7040A-100000@gigue.peabody.jhu.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
