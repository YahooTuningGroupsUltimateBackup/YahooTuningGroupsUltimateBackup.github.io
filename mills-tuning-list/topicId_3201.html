The movie was filmed in<br>1924, directed by F. W. Murnau, and stars Emil Jannings as a hotel<br>porter. <br><br>Influenced by German expressionist art and film styles of the period, it<br>is remarkable in that it eschews the use of printed language in<br>title-boards (with two unavoidable exceptions), relying, to carry the<br>story along, on what many of us modern-day viewers reacted to as<br>overacting. In keeping with its emphasis on non-verbal visuals, the film<br>also features many extraordinary and innovative camera shots, angles,<br>and effects: among the most notable are the opening shot, taken from<br>inside a descending glass elevator and looking out on the hotel lobby;<br>one shot done out in the street where the entire hotel building hovers<br>over Jannings as though about to fall on him (portraying his highly<br>emotionally-charged state of mind at the time); and one where a <br>neighbor's face appears grotesquely stretched and distorted as <br>seen through Jannings' hung-over eyes. <br><br>In brief, the movie portrays Jannings as an old man who <br>exudes dignity and respect in his<br>job as a doorman at the Hotel Atlantic. He parades proudly <br>through his neighborhood in his extravagant uniform each <br>vening after work. In a side story, his daughter gets married,<br>and this happy occasion provides both the rationale for a very <br>well-executed (and funny)drunken scene, and a poignant <br>contrast to the dismal events about to come. Jannings'<br>character has become too old and tired to carry the heavy <br>baggage of the hotel's guests, so eventually he gets demoted <br>to men's washroom attendant (the notice he reads is the<br>first title board used in the film). This is a staggering <br>blow to him, and he hides it from everyone he knows, <br>until his wife makes a surprise visit <br>to bring him goodies at his job, and<br>finds out, unbeknownst to him. After his wife discovers <br>that he's a washroom attendant, he<br>comes home. His new son-in-law answers the door because <br>his wife and daughter are too ashamed of him. Soon gossip <br>spreads the news through his whole community, and he is<br>ridiculed by all, family included. It seems there is <br>nothing left for the old man to do but<br>waste away the rest of his life, when suddenly the <br>director surprises us with an ironic and<br>hilarious twist near the end (announced by the <br>second title board). Thus, the main players<br>reap the fate sown by their respective good or bad karma. <br><br>     Drummond's music is written for an ensemble <br>consisting of two instruments of his own<br>invention, a few conventional ones, and several of Harry Partch's. The<br>Drummond instruments are tuned to a 31-tone just-intonation scale,<br>and are the Zoomoozophone, a marimba-like mallet instrument made of<br>aluminum tubes and producing a soft, hollow sound, and the<br>Juststrokerods, made of solid aluminum rods and producing a clear<br>violin-like tone. The Partch instruments (tuned to the 43-tone<br>just-intonation scale described in his "Genesis of a Music") required in<br>this piece are the Bass Marimba, Bloboy, Boo, Chromelodeon,<br>Diamond Marimba, both Harmonic Canons, Kithara, and Spoils of War.<br>The standard instruments called for in the score are flute (one player<br>on<br>regular and alto), trumpet, and cello. The notes played on these three<br>instruments had to be microtonally adjusted by the players. In addition,<br>there was a Yahama DX-7 synthesizer (retuned with the help of the Grey<br>Matter E! Board installed), hi-hat, suspended cymbal, and several other<br>percussion instruments. <br><br>The score evocatively reflects the contrasting moods of the <br>film, particularly the drastic shift from the depths of the <br>Porter's humiliation and despair to the happiness and humor <br>of the final scene; in fact, the music was so well-fitted to <br>this scene that I quite forgot about it as I watched the <br>screen -- I consider this to be the best compliment a film <br>score can receive. <br><br>In several places, Drummond's score provides a realistic <br>sound for one that appears prominently on screen: in one <br>scene the Porter blows a whistle, represented by the flute; in<br>another, the trumpet in the orchestra gives the sound for a <br>man blowing on a trumpet in the courtyard while the Porter <br>gets drunk and watches from the apartment above -- the<br>microtonal inflections exquisitely reflected the inebriated <br>state of Jannings' character. And in the lively scenes <br>filmed in the street in front of the hotel and in the hotel <br>lobby, Drummond's music is appropriately effervescent. Here <br>and there a few "leitmotifs" can also be recognized, and all <br>of this is bathed in the glowing sound resulting from Drummond's<br>brilliant orchestration of this unique ensemble. It was also <br>very refreshing to hear Partch's instruments giving off music <br>sounding not even remotely like his. <br><br>Two things I was very glad to witness post-performance: <br>audience members were not prevented from wandering around <br>and examining the instruments visually, and no-one from<br>the audience abused the privilege by trying to touch anything. <br>Drummond and the other performers also remained accessible <br>for questions and conversation for a long time after<br>the show, which was most welcome. <br><br>The movie runs well over an hour, and except for the silent <br>opening and closing titles (I thought that was kind of unusual), <br>the music runs continuously from the opening shot to<br>the end, and should be considered a major piece of Drummond's. <br>This deserves to be released on video. <br><br>Joe Monzo <br>3/15/1998 <br>monz@uscom.com<br>telephone 1 215 849 6723 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>-- <br>*   .
