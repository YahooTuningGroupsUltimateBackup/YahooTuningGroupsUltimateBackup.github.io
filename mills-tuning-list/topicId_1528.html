As a result (or<br>perhaps ignoring that advice) the latest version of Csoudn (3.44) has<br>two new opcodes aimed at tunings other than 12ET, which has been built<br>in from the beginning.<br>  The first opcode is aimed at even divisions of the octave, and is a<br>simple extension of the current notation.  The other opcode gves equal<br>divisions of any interval -- clearly a 12th is a good candidate but so<br>would irrational repeats like 3.14159 (well actually a rational<br>approximation).  There are provisions for setting ones own reference<br>frequency. <br>  As an alternative both opcodes can be used with a table of values<br>rather than equal divisions, so 'exotic' scales could be coded fairly<br>easily.<br><br>As was pointed out the just-intonation folk are already provided for<br>by division.<br><br>ohn ffitch<br><br>(Documentation in ftp.maths.bath.ac.uk:pub/dream/Version3_44.Notes<br> PC/Windows code in ftp.maths.bath.ac.uk:pub/dream/csound_win.zip <br> PC/DOS code in ftp.maths.bath.ac.uk:pub/dream/csound_new.zip <br> SGI code in ftp.maths.bath.ac.uk:pub/dream/SGI/csound<br> Sources in csound_src.zip of Csound.tar.gz)<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 10 Jan 1997 16:01 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18481; Fri, 10 Jan 1997 16:04:42 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18492<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id HAA09004; Fri, 10 Jan 1997 07:04:30 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 10 Jan 1997 07:04:30 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701101000_MC2-E7C-6022@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4581 href="#4581">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;David Worrall&#x22; &#x3C;drw@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/1997 6:42:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Jan 9,  8:42pm, Adam Silverman wrote:<br>> Subject: building an mbira<br>> This is a question for all of you master-craftspersons out there.
