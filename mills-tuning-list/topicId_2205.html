Presumably, it will be<br>accompanied by the resurrected digest just to fill up all our<br>mail boxes.<br><br>All the numbers we'll be meeting today will be odd, so I won't say<br>so every time.  Numbers with more than one prime factor have a<br>special significance, so I'll call them "rhubarb numbers" for want<br>of knowing a better term.<br><br>For an n-limit chord, first choose a number m.  Either n or m, or<br>both, must be composite. m<n.  n and m  must not share a common<br>factor.  Providing neither n nor m are rhubarb, a saturated n-limit<br>chord can be constructed form all the divisors of n*m except n*m<br>and 1. This chord will be symmetrical: it's own utonal analog.<br><br>Examples are the two 9-limit symmetric chords already found.<br>Also, the 11-limit s-chord 33:11:9:3, the 25-limit s-chord<br>75:45:25:15:9:5:3 and the 35-limit s-chord<br>105:63:45:35:21:15:9:7:5:3.<br><br>When mj is rhubarb, we have a problem.  The intervals n*i/j and<br>n*j/i will be beyond the n-limit.  The same problem occurs when<br>nj is rhubarb unless i>m and j>m, so that i*m<n and j*m<n.<br>This problem complicates matters, but is not insoluble as I<br>shall demonstrate with the example n, m<br><br>[Or that's what I though when I orginally posted.  Squares of<br>primes are not a problem because n*i/i1.  However, with<br>mi*i, n*i*i/ii/1 will exceed the n-limit.  In practice,<br>treat 3*3*3', 3*3*3*3ï¿½ and 5*5*55 as rhubarb.]<br><br>This gives us the chord 35:21:15:7:5:3.  The intervals 35/3 and<br>21/5 are >15-limit.  Therefore [21 or 5] and [35 or 3] must be<br>removed.  If 35 and 21 are removed, we have a 15-limit otonality.<br>Removing 5 and 3 gives its utonal analog.  The choice is then<br>removing [21 and 3] or [35 and 5].  The resulting chords 15-limit<br>s-chords 35:15:7:5 and 21:15:7:3 are then otonal/utonal analogs.<br><br>I think otonal/utonal pairs will arise whenever the rhubarb<br>problem occurs.  I haven't looked at any cases where n and m are<br>both rhubarb.  The first of these is n5, m3.  Doubly rhubarb<br>numbers can safely be ignored until someone starts writing 105-<br>limit music.<br><br>That should be all you need to know.<br><br>                         Graham<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 6 Jul 1997 12:37 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05627; Sun, 6 Jul 1997 12:37:38 +0200<br>Date: Sun, 6 Jul 1997 12:37:38 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05634<br>Received: (qmail 6446 invoked from network); 6 Jul 1997 10:37:17 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 6 Jul 1997 10:37:17 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.BSI.3.91.970706002734.18644A-100000@lehua.ilhawaii.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5772 href="#5772">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/1997 6:07:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Lucy wrote:<br><br>'' Assuming that he is correct (I have no reason to doubt him on this), and the fashion moved from meantone into well temperaments, and eventually 12tET, I wonder why meantone tunings were abandoned.''<br><br>My post clearly did not say this, but rather that the well temperaments<br>were an abandoned cul-de-sac within a generally meantone era, and that the<br>repertoire associated with the well temperaments had certain attributes<br>that were not taken up by the immediately following generations of<br>composers, who were apparently satisfied with the tonal resources of<br>meantone (whether or not they actually used meantone is another question!).<br>From my posting, I wanted to suggest that 12tet was not an historicallyconsequent development out of the well temperaments, but rather a later<br>development directly out of meantone, and reflecting different musical<br>priorities than those which gave rise to the well temperaments.  Lucy also writes:<br><br>''The difficulty of quickly retuning meantones would have severely<br>restricted the harmonic possibilities, yet well temperaments immediately offered keyboard players both tuning and intervallic novelties, in different keys.''<br><br>Which is not quite right. Tuning meantone and Werckmeister III or<br>Kirnberger III involve setting _exactly_ the same tempered series, and then<br>tuning series of just intervals - in meantone, a series of 5/4 thirds, inthe well temperaments, a series of 3/2 fifths. Therefore there is no<br>question of the speed of retuning here. Without retuning, the well<br>temperaments offer 12 usable key signatures, but if the target is<br>''intervallic novelties'' then using more than then the 6 ''in tune''<br>signatures in meantone will certainly greater novelty of the sort.
