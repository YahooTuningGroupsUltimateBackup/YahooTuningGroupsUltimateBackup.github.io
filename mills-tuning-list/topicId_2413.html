And it's right over there.  No, a little to the left, by the sofa...<br><br>I'm gratified to have gotten some attention for a while.<br><br>For years I was always at a loss to answer the question "What kind of music<br>do you play/compose?" It is NOT pop, nor is it classical, nor is it truly<br>that of any existing style, American or otherwise, not even the one called<br>"New Music". But it does have elements in common with many different styles<br>around the world. What I have always tried to do is get to the very basic<br>elements of music and creatively expand upon those principles to produce<br>something that transcends styles. The result is that it sounds familiar to<br>almost everyone, but yet it sounds different, too.<br>        Norman Henry once told me that I play "Exotic Music". I liked the<br>Sound of that, so we are the "Exotic Music Ensemble".<br><br>For those who have not heard us, we use 17 limit extended Just Intonation in<br>a matrix of nine Harmonic Series scales (1-32) and as many subharmonic<br>series scales (1-24). We also use lots of odd time signatures and<br>polyrhythms in our counterpoint. Most of our instruments are homemade<br>(inspired by Partch). And yes, we take stylistic elements from all over the<br>world. we also like to blur the distinctions between classical, pop, folk<br>and jazz idiums. We work with dancers whenever possible.<br><br>Check out our web page!<br><br><br><br>Best wishes,<br><br>Denny Genovese<br>Director<br><br>Southeast Just Intonation Center            sejic@afn.org<br>World Harmony Project Inc.<br>PO Box 15464                                http://www.afn.org/~sejic<br>Gainesville, FL 32604  USA<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk<br>Subject:  Re: Software setup<br>PostedDate:  20-09-97 16:43:50<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  20-09-97 16:43:39-20-09-97 16:43:40,20-09-97 16:42:50-20-09-97 16:42:50<br>DeliveredDate:  20-09-97 16:42:50<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256518.0050E3BF; Sat, 20 Sep 1997 16:43:31 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01893; Sat, 20 Sep 1997 16:43:50 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 20 Sep 1997 16:43:50 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01891<br>Received: (qmail 29766 invoked from network); 20 Sep 1997 14:43:42 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 20 Sep 1997 14:43:42 -0000<br>Message-Id: <memo.558452@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
