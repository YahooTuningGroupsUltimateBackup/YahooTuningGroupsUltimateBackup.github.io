Pretend you can't tune your instruments<br>properly.  That's what Captain Beefheart did.<br><br>Actually, pentatonic "blues scales" were covered on the list<br>not long ago.<br><br>Roni Size has got a TX81Z, you know.<br><br>> ,sample<br>> CD-ROMs (not multi-samples,but actual performances,ala those George <br>> Clinton collections),etc.We'll all be in trouble.I'd hate to hear a <br>> Partch/Darreg/etc. sample on Will Smith's latest "Cashing in on <br>> M.I.B.&ID4" ditty<br><br>There are a load of tunes that already use "ethnic" samples.  I'll<br>bet a lot of them way off 12-equal.<br><br>> ,or aimless arpeggio-type patterns driving some dance music craze<br><br>Plus ca change...<br><br><br><br>>    As something of an aside to this discussion, I have long thought that<br>> movie music is be a great avenue for microtonal composers to get their<br>> ideas to the proverbial masses.<br><br>If any producers out there would like me to score their movies, get in<br>touch.<br><br>What, no takers?  Darn ...<br><br>Seriously, movies have such a huge budget you can't expect too much<br>experimentation, especially as the people who hold the purse strings<br>aren't going to be big musos.  Now, if an established film composer<br>were to go microtonal, then we'd be in business.  If the audience<br>don't realise they're listening to microtonal music, they might<br>accidentally like it!</div>
