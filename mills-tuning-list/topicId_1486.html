I would define the limit as the largest odd <br>number that occurs in ratios that are considered consonant. I differ with <br>many JI advocates in that I do not think dissonances should be represented <br>as ratios -- in 5-limit diatonic music, a major second is a major second <br>whether you call it 9/8 or 10/9. (Not to deny that one could create a <br>9-limit diatonic style in which these would be two distinct consonances -- <br>this is hinted at by the use of chords such as C-D-E-G as consonances; i.e., <br>8:9:10:12.)<br><br>Harry Partch falls into my camp in this debate; please read Genesis of a <br>Music if you haven't already.<br><br>The simplest equal temperament that clearly distinguishes all 9-limit <br>intervals is 41-equal. In 41-equal, Glen Peterson's scale is<br><br>0 ? ? 6 7 8 9 11 13 15 17 20 21 24 26 28 30 32 33 34 35 ? ? 41<br><br>or steps of<br><br>(6) 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 1 3 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 (6)<br><br>A feature that sticks out here is 3-1-3, so I'd probably want to repeat that <br>at the 3/2 above, which turns out to be the 2/1. Transposing down to the <br>1/1, or 0, we add 0, 3, 4, and 7, giving us<br><br>0 3 4 6 7 8 9 11 13 15 17 20 21 24 26 28 30 32 33 34 35 ? ? 41<br><br>But now the 3-1-3 at the bottom is a 3-1-2-1. Putting this pattern back in <br>the original position of the 3-1-3 (by adding note 23 and taking liberties <br>with the original question), this becomes<br><br>0 3 4 6 7 8 9 11 13 15 17 20 21 23 24 26 28 30 32 33 34 35 ? ? 41<br><br>or steps of<br><br>3 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 (6)<br><br>I'd probably split up the (6) into (2+2+2), and then add the notes 10 and 31 <br>for symmetry:<br><br>0 3 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 13 15 17 20 23 24 26 28 30 31 32 33 34 35 37 39 41<br><br>or steps of<br><br>3 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2.<br><br>So I have added 7 notes instead of 4. I would not attach ratios to these <br>notes; although they form dissonances with the 1/1, they may form various <br>consonances with the other notes -- one of the beauties of temperament!<br><br>You can see this scale as based on a "tetrachord" of<br><br>1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 1 2 1<br><br>with the extra "whole tone" filled in as<br><br>2 2 2 1.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 3 Jan 1997 22:30 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00660; Fri, 3 Jan 1997 22:33:28 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00658<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA00444; Fri, 3 Jan 1997 13:33:25 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 3 Jan 1997 13:33:25 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.970103161313.9197T-100000@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
