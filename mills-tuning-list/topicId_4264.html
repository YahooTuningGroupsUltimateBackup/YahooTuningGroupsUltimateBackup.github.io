However, I once had the opportunity to play a Challis<br>> clavichord (such a work of art you cannot imagine), and I could see getting<br>> 7's on it.  I would be very interested in hearing your 11-limit clavichord,<br>> and I'd be happy to pay the cost of sending a tape with some samples on it<br>> to hear the results.

Of course they are<br>> well known for putting a hitch pin on each string...  and for their<br>> inferior sound...<br>><br>> It's far from clear what your strobe tuner was measuring.  I own the latest<br>> and highest-end Peterson model made, and my ear rarely agrees with the<br>> wheel.  I have no problem whatsoever tuning a Steinway to 9-limit JI by<br>> ear, to a level of accuracy measurable only (maybe) by a Sanderson<br>> Accu-tuner (I've never used one myself, but they do produce very nice<br>> tunings).<br>><br>> >But I don't know how to even start arguing with someone who claims the<br>> >difference between Equal temperament and meantone is hardly noticeable on<br>> >a clavichord. Are you, sir, deaf?<br>><br>> Don't get me wrong, I love the clavichord.  It is an instrument of great<br>> sensitivity.  But it is based on a bad idea: trying to start and stop a<br>> string at the same place.  If the string didn't stretch, you wouldn't hear<br>> anything at all.<br>><br>> I can hear the difference between meantone and 12tET on my clavichord, but<br>> the people I play the clavichord for cannot.  They can, however, hear the<br>> difference between these two tunings on my modern piano.<br>><br>> Carl<br>><br>> ------------------------------<br>><br>> Topic No. 2<br>><br>> Date: Sat, 05 Dec 1998 20:51:26 -0800<br>> From: Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com><br>> To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>> Subject: Misc<br>> Message-ID: <19981206015031796.AAA437@nietzsche><br>><br>> >Like Partch, he realized such Harmonic Constructs were not scales and<br>> added >first the 6 pitches of the 9 limit plus the 21/20 and the 16/15 and<br>> their >inversions which he<br>><br>> No, but like Partch, I recognize that the harmonic and subharmonic series<br>> segments contained within the diamond are scales (as you use the term).<br>><br>> >Is it too silly to expect that such a work will be realised in 7-limit JI<br>> by >operatically trained singers given their irresistible inclination for<br>> >vibrato?<br>><br>> It is silly to expect opera singers to perform any music with harmonic<br>> accuracy.

The word microtonal definitely needs to be on the<br>> > front jacket.<br>><br>>    Ah, Good point.  Then again, I suppose it might be worth asking whether the<br>> term "microtonal" means much to the proverbial "average Joe" either.<br>><br>>    I think that "The Experience" is catchy though.<br>><br>> > Full color is not that expensive.

In those days anyway, that came to about $1000 more<br>> than you estimated.  It wouldn't surprise me of they've gone down since then<br>> though.<br>><br>> ------------------------------<br>><br>> End of TUNING Digest 1604<br>> *************************</div><h3><a id=8928 href="#8928">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl</h3><span>12/7/1998 4:05:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I don't know which mail program you are using, but I use the mail window of<br>Netscape Communicator.
