Silverman&#x22; &#x3C;Adam.B.Silverman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/1996 7:34:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>John Pusey asked about us informing the list about new Partch CDs, and I <br>realized that nobody (as far as I can remember) has reviewed the Partch <br>"Enclosure #2" CD set.  For those of you who do not know, this is a <br>collection of Partch tunes, mainly culled from old recordings which have <br>been previously unavailable commercially.<br><br>I will not review this, but with fear of putting my foot in my mouth, I <br>feel compelled to voice a complaint.  Amidst the wonderful pieces which I <br>had never previously heard, such as "Dark Brother" and "Settings from <br>Finnegan's Wake", is an amateur reading of "Bitter <br>Music".  The booklet notes disclaim "There is some debate as to whether <br>"Bitter Music" should still exist, let alone be heard in public".  My <br>complaint is not about whether the manuscript should have been destroyed <br>(I cherish my book), but I think that we should all be concerned with <br>setting only QUALITY performances of his music before the public.  <br>Perhaps it was ego-serving to include such a performance in a CD of <br>"historical" performances.  I think that I should not have been included <br>in CDs at all. Buy the book, find a piano that you haven't retuned yet, <br>and play it yourself for maximum benefit.<br><br>My suggestion, if you have not yet heard the disc, is to order one <br>immediately, and put all four CDs in yout player.  Use the program button <br>to select all of the tracks EXCEPT for "Bitter Music", and while you're <br>at it, "Harry's Wake".  Although I never met Partch, I like to remember <br>him without the cognac.<br><br>New Partch CDs are not all bitter music, though--Ted Mook and Stephen Kalm <br>released an excellent CD of "Li Po" this year!  Truly a living and <br>intonationally sensitive performance.<br><br>Adam<br><br>Received: from sun4nl.NL.net [193.78.240.1] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 9 Mar 1996 21:45 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by sun4nl.NL.net with SMTP<br>	id AA27820 (5.65b/CWI-3.3); Sat, 9 Mar 1996 21:41:12 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA08045; Sat, 9 Mar 1996 11:52:58 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 9 Mar 1996 11:52:58 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199603091948.EAA25668@inetnif.niftyserve.or.jp><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
