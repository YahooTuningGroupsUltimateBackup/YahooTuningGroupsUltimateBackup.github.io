If<br>>}anything, because chromatic modes have but four (at most), not six<br>>}degrees (as in the diatonic modes) on which consonant triads are<br>>}erigible, chromatic modes in 22-tone equal would be even more<br>>}disorganized than diatonic ones. For enharmonic modes the matter is less<br>>}clear-cut, I concede.<br>><br>>OK folks, switch to a constant-width font -- it's ASCII diagram time!<br>><br>>We will represent the 3:2 ratio ("perfect fifths") by lines running left to<br>>right.<br>>We will represent the 5:4 ratio ("major thirds") by lines running from lower<br>>left to upper right.<br>>We will represent the 6:5 ratio ("minor thirds") by lines running from upper<br>>left to lower right.<br>><br>>Consonant triads will therefore be represented by isosceles triangles. Major<br>>triads have the base of the triangle on the bottom; minor triads have the<br>>base on top.<br>><br>>First of all, let's look at the diatonic scale -- the white keys on a piano.<br>>It has six consonant triads:<br>><br>><br>>D---------A---------E---------B<br>> \       / \       / \       / \<br>>  \     /   \     /   \     /   \<br>>   \   /     \   /     \   /     \<br>>    \ /       \ /       \ /       \<br>>     F---------C---------G---------D<br>><br>>Notice that "D" occurs twice.<br>><br>>In 19-equal, the 3:2 is 11 steps, the 5:4 is 6 steps, and the 6:5 is 5 steps.<br>>Setting the leftmost D=0, the diatonic scale is then<br>><br>>0---------11--------3---------14<br>> \       / \       / \       / \<br>>  \     /   \     /   \     /   \<br>>   \   /     \   /     \   /     \<br>>    \ /       \ /       \ /       \<br>>     5---------16--------8---------0<br>><br>>Both instances of "D" are represented by "0." The diatonic scale "works" in<br>>19-equal.<br>><br>>In 22-equal, the 3:2 is 13 steps, the 5:4 is 7 steps, and the 6:5 is 6 steps.<br>>Again setting the leftmost D=0, the diatonic scale becomes<br>><br>>0---------13--------4---------17<br>> \       / \       / \       / \<br>>  \     /   \     /   \     /   \<br>>   \   /     \   /     \   /     \<br>>    \ /       \ /       \ /       \<br>>     6---------19--------10--------1<br>><br>>"D" is now represented by both "0" and "1". As most classical composers made<br>>use of the fact that "D" or its equivalent in keys other that C major is one<br>>and only one pitch, 22-equal is unusable for most classical music. Other<br>>tunings unusable for most classical music are 15, 27, 34, 41, 53TET, and JI<br>>-- these are the tunings where the syntonic comma (representing 81:80) does<br>>not vanish, causing two different "D"s to arise at a very small interval from<br>>one another. Tunings that are usable at least for the early stuff are 12, 19,<br>>26, 31, 43, 50, and 55TET, as well as meantone tunings such as Kornerup's<br>>Golden Tuning, LucyTuning, 1/4-comma meantone, 2/7-comma meantone, 3/14-comma<br>>meantone, etc.<br>><br>>Now let's look at Gregg Gibson's four "new" scales. They each contain four<br>>consonant triads:<br>><br>>D melodic minor ascending:<br>><br>>     C#<br>>    / \<br>>   /   \<br>>  /     \<br>> /       \<br>>A---------E---------B<br>>           \       / \<br>>            \     /   \<br>>             \   /     \<br>>              \ /       \<br>>               G---------D---------A<br>>                          \       /<br>>                           \     /<br>>                            \   /<br>>                             \ /<br>>                              F<br>><br>>This scale has the same step sizes as the diatonic scale. Gregg has made a<br>>big deal about 12-equal not really representing the "chromatic" scales<br>>adequately, since the minor third is conflated with the augmented second in<br>>12-equal. This scale has no augmented second or any other non-diatonic steps,<br>>so I presume the term "chromatic" applies to the other three:<br>><br>>A harmonic minor:<br>><br>>                         G#<br>>                        / \<br>>                       /   \<br>>                      /     \<br>>                     /       \<br>>D---------A---------E---------B<br>> \       / \       /<br>>  \     /   \     /<br>>   \   /     \   /<br>>    \ /       \ /<br>>     F---------C<br>><br>><br>>C harmonic major:<br>><br>>               E---------B<br>>              / \       / \<br>>             /   \     /   \<br>>            /     \   /     \<br>>           /       \ /       \<br>>F---------C---------G---------D<br>> \       /<br>>  \     /<br>>   \   /<br>>    \ /<br>>     Ab<br>><br>>E major Gypsy:<br>><br>>                    G#--------D#<br>>                   / \       /<br>>                  /   \     /<br>>                 /     \   /<br>>                /       \ /<br>>     A---------E---------B<br>>    / \       /<br>>   /   \     /<br>>  /     \   /<br>> /       \ /<br>>F---------C<br>><br>>The reader is encouraged to work out these diagrams in 19- and 22-equal. Note<br>>that in these last three scales, there are no notes that appear twice in the<br>>diagram, and thus no potential for the scales not to "work" in any tuning<br>>that has good 5-limit approximations, including 22-equal. The harmonic major<br>>and harmonic minor scales have four step sizes in 22-equal but three in 12-<br>>and 19-equal; if any tuning is avoiding "conflations" within these scales it<br>>is 22-equal, though I prefer the greater uniformity of step sizes in 12- and<br>>19-equal. For the last of these scales, the number of different step sizes is<br>>the same in all three tunings (12, 19, 22) so it is really, really hard to<br>>claim that it "works" in some but not all of these tunings.<br>><br>>My interest in 22-equal has nothing to do with these scales. I use these<br>>scales all the time in 12-equal (the last one is great for surf music) and<br>>see no great advantage to justify the expense of moving to 19-equal (though<br>>I'd be the first to pick up a 19-tone guitar, keyboard, and bass if they were<br>>commercially available). In fact, two of my favorite scales do not work in<br>>19-equal at all:<br>><br>>C augmented (six consonant triads):<br>><br>>               G#--------D#<br>>              / \       /<br>>             /   \     /<br>>            /     \   /<br>>           /       \ /<br>>          E---------B<br>>         / \       /<br>>        /   \     /<br>>       /     \   /<br>>      /       \ /<br>>     C---------G<br>>    / \       /<br>>   /   \     /<br>>  /     \   /<br>> /       \ /<br>>Ab--------Eb<br>><br>>This is like the diatonic scale turned on its side. In 12-equal Ab and G# are<br>>the same and Eb and D# are the same. In almost any other tuning, this scale<br>>doesn't work; you get eight instead of six tones and some really small<br>>intervals. 27-equal is a rare counterexample, but 27-equal does not support<br>>the diatonic scale.<br>><br>>C diminished (eight consonant triads):<br>><br>>F#--------C#<br>> \       / \<br>>  \     /   \<br>>   \   /     \<br>>    \ /       \<br>>     A---------E<br>>      \       / \<br>>       \     /   \<br>>        \   /     \<br>>         \ /       \<br>>          C---------G<br>>           \       / \<br>>            \     /   \<br>>             \   /     \<br>>              \ /       \<br>>               Eb--------Bb<br>>                \       / \<br>>                 \     /   \<br>>                  \   /     \<br>>                   \ /       \<br>>                    Gb--------Db<br>><br>>This scale doesn't work unless F#=Gb and C#=Db, i.e., in almost any tuning<br>>other than 12-equal. 28-equal is a rare counterexample which doesn't,<br>>however, support the diatonic scale.<br>><br>>So far all the scales discussed are well-represented in 12-equal. No other<br>>tuning can represent them all, expect maybe one with a vast number of notes.<br>>However, my interest was to see if one could expand consonant harmony to<br>>include the 7-limit (Partch seemed confident that at least the 11-limit could<br>>possess some measure of consonance) while maintaining a diatonic-like<br>>structure. This entails throwing out the diatonic scale and all concepts<br>>associated with it, such as classifying the consonances as "major thirds",<br>>"perfect fifths", etc. -- the 3:2 is now a "perfect seventh" and the 5:4 and<br>>6:5 are major and minor "fourths."<br>><br>>To add the 7-limit to these diagrams, a note in the center of a major triad<br>>will signify a 7 added to the 4:5:6 major triad to yield a 4:5:6:7 otonal<br>>tetrad, and a note in the center of a minor triad will signify a 1/7 added to<br>>the 1/6:1/5:1/4 minor triad to yield a 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 utonal tetrad. In<br>>22-equal, the 7:4 is 18 steps, the 7:5 is 11 steps, and the 7:6 is 5 steps.<br>>Here are the two decatonic scales in 22-equal:<br>><br>>Symmetrical decatonic scale (8 consonant tetrads):<br>><br>>     13--------4---------17<br>>    / \       / \       /<br>>   /   \  8  /   \  21 /<br>>  /  2---------15--------6<br>> /  / \  \ /  / \  \ /  /<br>>6--/---\--19-/---\--10 /<br>>  /  13 \   /  4  \   /<br>> /       \ /       \ /<br>>17--------8---------21<br>><br>><br>>Pentachordal decatonic scale (6 consonant tetrads):<br>><br>>          2<br>>         / \<br>>        /   \<br>>0---------13--------4<br>> \    /  / \  \    / \<br>>  \  17-/---\--8  /   \<br>>   \   /  2---------15 \<br>>    \ /    \  \ /  /    \<br>>     6------\--19-/------10<br>>             \   /<br>>              \ /<br>>               8<br>><br>>These scales have 10 tones and 2 step sizes, and many, many important<br>>properties in common with the diatonic scale (see my paper). In most any<br>>other tuning with good 7-limit approximations, such as 27-, 31-equal, and JI,<br>>there will be more than 10 tones and more than 2 step sizes, including some<br>>really small steps. These steps represent what are known in JI as the<br>>septimal sixth-tone (49:48) and, in the case of the symmetrical decatonic<br>>scale, the septimal comma (64:63). That these intervals vanish in 22-equal is<br>>as essential for the functioning of the decatonic scales as the vanishing of<br>>the syntonic comma is for the functioning of the diatonic scale.<br>><br>>In 26-equal the septimal comma does not vanish but the septimal sixth-tone<br>>does. So the pentachordal decatonic scale does have 10 tones:<br>><br>>          2<br>>         / \<br>>        /   \<br>>0---------15--------4<br>> \    /  / \  \    / \<br>>  \  20-/---\--9  /   \<br>>   \   /  2---------17 \<br>>    \ /    \  \ /  /    \<br>>     7------\--22-/------11<br>>             \   /<br>>              \ /<br>>               9<br>><br>>However, there are three step sizes instead of two. Besides making it<br>>melodically awkward, this fact makes modulation difficult. An interval which<br>>is a "second" in one key can become a "third" in a neigboring key (3:2 away)<br>>-- which is disturbing when one considers that the "thirds" are supposed to<br>>represent consonances: a major "third" is 7:6, and a minor "third" is 8:7.<br>>The scalar grammar falls apart. So even for the pentachordal decatonic scale,<br>>both the septimal sixth-tone and the septimal comma must vanish. For neither<br>>of the decatonic scales must the syntonic comma vanish, however.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
