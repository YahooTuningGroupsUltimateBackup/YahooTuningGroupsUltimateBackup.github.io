Recordings I've made using black gospel choir<br>members support that idea, IMHO.  Oddly, many blues and black gospel singers<br>seem to prefer ratios (if indeed rational analysis is appropriate) adding 11s<br>and 13s, or even higher-primes, to a Pythagorean series, than those adding 5s<br>or even 7s.<br><br>In solo guitar work, as Neil Haverstick pointed out, the pitch is often in a<br>state of flux, and if/when it settles on steady pitches, it's usually on<br>different pitches at different places in a piece.  The particular pitch might<br>to have more to do with contrast than with achieving a consonant resonances.<br>Or as Daniel Wolf put it:<br><br>>the choice of melodic blues notes may reflect some<br>>qualitative assesment of the dissonance to the underlying harmony<br><br>In choral singing on the other hand, there is a tendency to use a set of<br>different 3rds and 6ths simultaneously, making a texture that seems to defy<br>objective analysis, though it reminds me of Mandelbrot and Julia set graphs<br>somehow.  It may be that chaos theory could provide a more accurate picture of<br>the situation.  We're certainly not talking about out-of-tune singing here -<br>it's an intentional, and far more pleasing, effect than that of a simply bad<br>choir.  That's not to say that they are conscious of whatever mathematical<br>principles are underlying what they're doing.<br><br>Speculation aside, I agree that blues intervals should be defined as neutral,<br>not sub-minor.<br><br>David J.
