I have played blues guitar for 30 years, and at this <br>stage, I do not believe that it is possible to pin down the "blue" notes <br>to a specific pitch. Just check out Albert King playing "Look Out" (Live <br>at the Fillmore), and listen how many different ways he bends the same <br>few notes...it is an awesome performance. It is quite correct to say that <br>there is a big range of possibilities as to where to bend a note; I teach <br>my students to do it by feel, because it is impossible to notate on <br>paper. To make things even more nebulous, there are no groundrules as to <br>when to bend a note, as well as how much to bend it...sometimes, a sax or <br>guitar will deliberately miss a note by a slight amount (usually flat), <br>for the "cry" it attains. Every blues/jazz musician is automatically an <br>arranger/composer, as well as a player...and improvisation is the name of <br>the game...it's a fascinating subject...Hstick</div><h3><a id=8462 href="#8462">ðŸ”—</a>Dr_Orient &#x3C;jma9183@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/9/1998 7:56:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> Topic No. 2<br>><br>> Date: Sun, 06 Sep 1998 08:46:23 -0500<br>> From: Gary Morrison <mr88cet@texas.net><br>> To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>> Subject: Re: Experimental 19-tone keyboard<br>> Message-ID: <35F2922A.6548B175@texas.net><br>><br>> > I have nearly completed my custom MIDI keyboard ( final year electronic project<br>> > at university ).<br>><br>>    Neat!

Although if you want to<br>> maintain A=440Hz as an absolute-pitch standard, then perhaps it might make sense<br>> to make that be the common note.<br>><br><br>It is my understanding that General MIDI starts at C-1 being labeled MIDI Note number 0, extending to G9<br>being labeled MIDI Note number 127 (Note: the 88-key range of a piano keyboard, by these criteria,<br>extends from A0{an octave and a sixth above C-1} to C8, with C4 corresponding to Middle C). MIDI Note<br>numbers may be extended higher than 127, but I have not encountered examples of them being extended on<br>the low end.

Most just<br>intonationalists are probably talking about the use of 7/4 sevenths<br>harmonically, creating a stable harmonic background. What happens<br>melodically over this background, however, varies tremendously among<br>singers or players, often reflecting instrumental restrictions.
