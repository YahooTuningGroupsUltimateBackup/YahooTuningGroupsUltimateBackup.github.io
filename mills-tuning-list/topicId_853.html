Chailley, published in<br>1958 in a book called _Acoustique Musicale_.<br><br>****<br>	We know that the calculations of the Pythagorean monochord don't go<br>beyond the 3rd harmonic. [...] If the 5th harmonic was introduced by<br>Ramis de Pareja in the 15th century, and spreaded by Zarlino in the 16th<br>century, it was only as a justification of an interval and a mode, not<br>by real consonance.<br><br>	The transition from one motion to the other is the result of Sauveur's<br>work, transposed by Rameau in the field of musical perception. Rameau<br>observed 7 and listened to it, but he refused to identify it with the<br>minor 7th of the 7+ chord because of it is out of tune. That's why he<br>analysed the 7+ chord as a dissonance, as the adjunction of another 6/5<br>to the natural 4:5:6 chord. The consequences of this postulate in<br>musical history is the pseudo-rule of the stacked thirds and its<br>derivates, until Schonberg. [...] The instinctive assimilation of 7/4 as<br>the minor seventh of the 7+ chord would not be different of the other<br>assimilations observed in history, including the 3rd of the minor chord,<br>of which the justification is historical, not physical.<br><br>	The 7+ chord should be defined as being consonant, starting at a<br>certain historical moment in the musical development. The 9+ chords and<br>harmonic 11ths should also be accepted.<br>****<br><br>As you can see by this article, Rameau is the one who refused to use the<br>7th harmonic and proposed 9/5, locking musical theory into 5-limit.<br>Maybe his influence is to blame for the current state of music.<br><br>-Kami<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 8 Sep 1996 02:24 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA27495; Sun, 8 Sep 1996 02:26:21 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA27672<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id RAA00150; Sat, 7 Sep 1996 17:26:18 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 7 Sep 1996 17:26:18 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960908002405_71670.2576_HHB37-3@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
