But I have to confess that I was<br>certainly not carried by Schenkerian spirit when I did my scale<br>constructions. The reason is simple: I didn't know about his work. I was<br>simply led by the idea that a harmonic scale results from the attempt to fill<br>the framework of a large consonant interval (for instance the octave)<br>with a chosen triad (for instance the Major) and its sub-intervals. The<br>smallest intervals created in this process are then used to fill the<br>voids and achieve approximate equidistance. This infill has practicality<br>for musical use as its reason. Alright, that sounds rather mechanistic, but<br>doesn't already the choice of the triad introduce tonality into this<br>process?<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 10 Dec 1996 23:11 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA21628; Tue, 10 Dec 1996 23:13:14 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA21669<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id OAA29976; Tue, 10 Dec 1996 14:13:11 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 10 Dec 1996 14:13:11 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.961210133910.13162A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4308 href="#4308">ðŸ”—</a>Gordon Collins &#x3C;gcollins@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/12/1996 6:11:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Dear me, dear me.  I've been lurking on this list for a few weeks,<br>waiting to get a feel for it, but I must rise up now in defense of<br>mathematics.  Yo, Brian!  Get yourself a good book on Number Theory.<br>Hardy & Wright is a good choice.  (Yes, that's *Number* Theory, not<br>*Group* Theory.  The integers modulo N do form a group under addition,<br>but that is not relevant to your post.  Issues of compositeness and<br>relative primality are pure Number Theory.)
