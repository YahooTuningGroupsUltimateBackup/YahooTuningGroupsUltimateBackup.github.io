M. Salinas mentioned "I'm a bit mad <br>about the little access there there is to `microtonality'<br>or tunings in the educational system."  Despite Greg <br>Taylor's hallucinogenic claims to the contrary, a pervasive<br>mindset exists in higher education which universally<br>discourages the exploration of non-12 non-Pythagorean<br>intonations.  (I say "usually" because remarkable and<br>praiseworthy academics like William Alves, William<br>Schottstaedt, Brian Belet, Allen Strange, Larry<br>Polansky and a few others consistently fight the<br>hand that bleeds them by teaching music via an<br>overtly non-12 approach.  In this regard Lou Harrison<br>is the supreme exemplar.  Alas, teachers of Harrison's<br>caliber and insight are all too rare in music departments<br>throughout academia.)<br>Because of this pervasive "always 12, only 12, forever<br>12, in the beginning was the word and the word was<br>12, and 12 moved upon the face of the waters and said<br>`Let there be 12'" attitude in academia, there has been<br>very little specifically xenharmonic investigation<br>and even less of it has been published in the yakademic<br>music theory journals.<br>As a result there is in the late 1990s as enormous<br>a disjuncture between what composers are actually<br>*doing* in the real world and music theory as<br>it is *taught* and *published* (12-TET only) as there<br>was in the late 15th century.  <br>Back then, even 50-100 years after the introduction<br>of the just 5/4 by Walter of Odington and the amazement<br>created by English choirs using his theories as<br>they toured the continent, even in the 1450s the  music <br>theorists wrote *only* in Pythagorean terms.  Examine<br>music texts of the late 14th and early 15th century,<br>and you will discover *no* reference to our modern<br>5/4 just major third.  Instead, the 81/64 third is<br>still derived by Pythagorean calculations and is<br>then considered to be "detuned" to obtain the 5/4. <br>This is a completely bizarre way of deriving the<br>5/4 third, but it makes sense if you remember that<br>everyone in the 15th century was totally<br>marinated and immersed in the rigid mindset of <br>Pythagoreanism. They were so brainwashed that <br>for most music theorists it was all but impossible <br>to make the break *out* of Pythagorean paradigms to<br>5-limit and its resulting rich musical implications.<br>In just the same way, nowadays music theorists<br>are so immersed and marinated in the rigid mindset <br>of 12-TET that it is all but impossible for most of<br>them to make the break to something other than<br>subdivisions of 12  so beloved of James Wood<br>and other continental European microtonalists.<br>The infinite realm of non-octave scales, non-just<br>non-equal-tempered scales, and high-limit extended<br>just intonation seems as unthinkable to the doyens<br>of contemporary 12-TET music theory today as<br>12-TET would have seemed to the doyens  of<br>Pythagorean music theory in the late 1300s<br>and early 1400s.<br>However, the lesson of history is that intonation<br>constantly changes.  Thus 12-TET is not permanent,<br>and is in fact in flux as we speak (though current<br>academics and curricula *refuse* to recognize this). <br>History shows us that technology drives intonation;<br>the reason for Pythagorean intonation from 600 A.D.<br>through the 1380s is that the organs of that period<br>(and yes, Frankish kings had great organs constructed,<br>they were common as early as 900 A.D.) did not use <br>modern secondary bellows.  As a result the air pressure<br>through the pipes varied drastically, and thus the<br>pitch of the notes rose and fell in a hideous clamor<br>as the organ was pumped and as more or fewer<br>notes were played by hauling out the huge blocks<br>of lumber which sealed the airflow of each organ<br>pipe.<br>Once you realize that teams of bellows pumpers<br>had to tread up and down in exact time to the music<br>on vast rooms full of organ bellows while teams<br>of organ "players" yanked out and slammed back<br>the immense wooden tenons that controlled each<br>pipe, you instantly understand why only Pythagorean<br>intonation would be acceptable and why strictly<br>regular metre was an absolute necessity in playing<br>music on such terrifying contraptions.  <br>Regular metre, since the organ players could not<br>risk getting out of step with the rhythmic pumping<br>of those who tread the bellows; and Pythagorean<br>intonation because as the pitches rose and fell<br>by whole semitones, subtler tunings with smaller<br>intervals than the diatessaron and diapente would<br>have fallen within the critical band as their<br>tuning varied wildly, producing a massive blast of<br>dissonances so unbearable as to make even the<br>most hard-core industrial music fan cringe.<br>Indeed, the popularity of the Pythagorean major<br>third of 407.8-some cents becomes instantly<br>comperhensible when you realize that on such an <br>early organ an 81/64 would have started at 407.8 cents<br>and dropped *through* 386 cents *down* even<br>*below* the just 5/4 as the bellows feeding<br>the pipe deflated completely (thus lowering<br>the air pressure through the pipe).<br>In exactly the same way, interest in radically <br>non-12 tunings is exploding nowadays because<br>of the recent advent of digital cheap retunable<br>synthesizers.  <br>Technology drives tuning.  It's that simple.  <br>J.A.M. Salinas' complaint that "I just finished<br>a degree on music composition in the UK, which<br>is meant to be very experimental and avant garde...<br>and nothing was mentioned about any other tuning<br>system different than the 12-TET" is a familiar<br>one.<br>I've encountered this complaint many many times<br>from many many people.  It's nothing new.  The<br>yakademics have their heads stuck in the sand,<br>and they refuse to wake up and look around and<br>recognize the fact that music is changing.  <br>Fortunately, this tuning forum provides the solution.<br>Anyone interested in a wide variety of information<br>about non-12 tunigs should contact John Chalmers<br>and give him your snail mail address.  I will send<br>you enormous amounts of information not biased<br>in any particular way--articles on nj net tunings,<br>non-12 equal temperaments, ji and various <br>ethnic and meantone european tunings covering<br>a period of more than 100 years by authors of<br>every conceivable viewpoint.   A number of<br>folks on the tuning forum have already asked<br>for and received such xeroxes; they've all been<br>shocked at the depth and breadth of material<br>which has been published on microtonality but<br>which is systematically ignored in the 12-TET musical<br>establishment because of the pervasive 12-only<br>mindset and the profound ignorance of the <br>yakademics.<br>In short, anyone who wants information need<br>only ask.  You will be astonished at how much<br>has been published about microtonality over<br>the last 100 years--it does not accord at all<br>well with the false and restricted and artificially<br>limited picture of modern music painted in the<br>typical grad school "avant garde" music course.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 21 Nov 1996 17:52 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02638; Thu, 21 Nov 1996 17:53:35 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02473<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA29991; Thu, 21 Nov 1996 08:53:33 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 21 Nov 1996 08:53:33 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199611211652.IAA29938@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
