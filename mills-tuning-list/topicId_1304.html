Specifically, Brian<br>pointed out Babbitt's rejection of the overtone series<br>as a musical determinant. However he did not fully explain<br>Babbitt's motivation for doing so. The reason is clear,<br>Babbitt is arguing for an extremely contextual approach to<br>interval syntax, and he is moreover interested in carrying<br>forward Arnold Schoenberg's "emancipation of dissonance", or<br>more specifically, the emancipation of dissonance from normative<br>rules which require that a dissonance behave according to<br>tonal function, namely that it must resolve to a consonance. <br>Babbitt takes the extreme position that the function of intervals<br>is always contextually defined, and therefore he must reject<br>the overtone series which implies an a priori hierarchy of interval<br>importance. This rejection is debatable as Mclaren has shown.<br>An interesting point in Babbitt's rejection of the overtone<br>series as musical determinant is his argument that the<br>perfect fourth comes earlier in the series than thirds, and yet<br>the fourth is treated as a dissonance in tonal music. Mclaren<br>claims this is circular reasoning: the fourth is a dissonance<br>because our theory says it is. <br><br>If we accept Mclaren's view on the fourth, we must accept that<br>it is a consonance relative to thirds by virtue of its relative<br>ratio simplicity. But this really does limit our pleasure if we<br>propose to look at some actual tonal music. By categorically<br>rejecting the fourth as a dissonance, we can no longer hear<br>4-3 suspensions in tonal function, especially in their<br>voice-leading function in the I(6/4) chord, often a moment of great<br>tension in classical works.<br><br>I think we are better served by making a distinction between<br>contextual dissonance based on tonal (or other) function, and what I'll<br>call Hindemith-Mclaren dissonance, based on the intervallic and<br>overtone complexity of a given simultaneity. We really can have<br>both; it doesn't have to be "my way or no way".<br><br>If we flip to the last four bars of the first movement of<br>JS Bach's Italian Concerto,we are presented with a big fat I(6/4) chord <br>on the downbeat. Question: do you hear this simultaneity as<br>a consonance or a dissonance? I can only speak for myself;<br>I hear it as a flaming dissonance which Bach briefly savors<br>by abruptly slowing the rhythm after 12 bars of steady 16th notes. <br>proceeding to the next bar, I hear a partial but hesitant<br>resolution, before a final confident drive to the tonic in the<br>last two bars. If we take a closer look at the downbeat of the<br>second of these four bars we see (and hear) something strange:<br>owing to a double suspension the downbeat simultaneity consists<br>of pitches C-D-E-F: a diatonic cluster. From the Hindemith-Mclaren<br>perspective (and any other I can think of), this simultaneity is<br>considerably more dissonant than the triad on the downbeat of<br>the previous bar. Yet I hear it as a resolution, a relative consonance.<br><br>In examining the two bars from a functional viewpoint,<br>I hear the harmonic sequence I(6/4)-V(5/3)-(something a bit<br>weird but basically) vi with a counterpuntal two voice outline<br>F-E-F/C-C-D, or 4-3-3. This is basically an elegant working out<br>of a deceptive cadence, driven by the contextual dissonance of<br>the 4th in the I(6/4) chord. But there is also a delicious<br>ambiguity between the contextual dissonance and the Hindemith-Mclaren<br>dissonance of the two downbeats which we cannot fully appreciate if<br>we insist on maintaining either Babbitt's total contextuality approach<br>or Mclaren's overtone simplicity approach to the exclusion of the other.<br><br>We have already seen how Babbitt reacts to an idea which challenges<br>his somewhat closed musical world view: denial. How does Mclaren<br>respond to a similar challenge? <br><br>It is clear that one of the premises of Mclaren as an advocate for<br>Xenharmonic music is that the primary relationship for evaluating and<br>creating music is the set of ratios between pitch elements. This<br>conception of music would be challenged by a music which incorporated<br>considerable noise elements such that it is no longer practical to<br>infer organization based on pitch ratios. This is precisely the<br>case with the percussion and other music by John Cage. In fact, the<br>prepared piano is a powerful, subversive attack on the notion of<br>interval. We have the keyboard laid out for us, predictably measuring<br>equal intervals and superimposing the structure of the diatonic<br>scale with the distribution of white and black keys. And yet, what<br>happens when we start to play the piano which Cage has prepared?<br>Sometimes we get a tone. Sometimes we get a noise. The amplitudes<br>are unpredictable. Sometimes a higher key on the piano makes a lower<br>sounding pitch. Many of the spectra are inharmonic, highlighting the<br>piano's membership in the percussion family. In short, the prepared<br>piano is an intervention and a prank which forces us to revisit<br>every assumption we may have about composing or playing music on a<br>keyboard. That Cage uses this new instrument masterfully in the<br>Three Dances for Two Prepared Pianos is a musical bonus.<br><br>We have already seen how Mclaren reacts to Cage and his work, and<br>therefore I conclude that despite Mclaren's attack on Babbitt,<br>they both share one important quality: they are both musical bigots.<br>My online Webster defines a bigot as:<br>one obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his own opinions and prejudices.<br><br>As I have said before, we don't need to take a reductive either/or<br>approach, especially in the arts. We can accept music which is<br>based on Xenharmonic principles without rejecting music which is<br>clearly not, appreciating each in its own context.<br><br>It turns out that in the recording and computer age, many composers<br>have created excellent works which are based on other organization<br>principles than pitch ratio: Christopher Penrose, Maggie Payne,<br>Bill Schottstaedt, Robert Constable, Paul Reller, Eric Lyon, Francois Bayle,<br>Francis Dhomont, Paul Lansky, The Beatles with Revolution #9 and I Am the <br>Walrus, Industrial music by Skinny Puppy, Laibach, Jim Thirwell,<br>Nurse With Wound. And let's not forget the Japanese noise artists<br>who are completely about noise organization: Merzbow, Hijokaidan,<br>CCCC, The Incapacitants, Violent Onsen Geisha and many many other<br>artists.<br><br>So let's just relax a bit and enjoy the situation as we<br>march forward into the next millennium with increasing<br>musical diversity, and if we try hard enough, <br>perhaps even a tolerance clause.<br><br>Eric Lyon<br>eric@iamas.ac.jp<br>http://www.iamas.ac.jp/~eric<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 2 Dec 1996 05:07 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13668; Mon, 2 Dec 1996 05:09:20 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13980<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id UAA04877; Sun, 1 Dec 1996 20:09:17 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 1 Dec 1996 20:09:17 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.961201210315.59162A-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
