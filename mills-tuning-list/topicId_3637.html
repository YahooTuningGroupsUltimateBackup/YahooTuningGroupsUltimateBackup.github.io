Microtonal are the intervals smaller<br>than a half step and every year the festival<br>spotlights microtonal music from around the<br>world. In contrast to recent years, most of this<br>years pieces were in just intonation - intervals of<br>whole number ratios. <br><br>Atom Turning In The Heart Of The Sun by Sasha<br>Bogdanowitch was a half hour epic journey.<br>Sasha sang in an expressive invented language,<br>danced across and around the musicians while<br>he illustrated his tale. In a 20 tone 7 limit tuning in<br>various instrumental combinations the musicians<br>provided a backdrop for his performance.<br>Extensively studies in eastern musical traditions<br>like gamelan and North Indian singing as well as<br>Western composition show as influences in the<br>work. I'm *just* a sucker for the instrumentation<br>and this is the one piece that totally knocked me<br>out this year. <br><br>      Sasha Bogdonowitch - voice<br>      Elizabeth Panzer - harps<br>      John Schneider - just intonation guitar<br>      Judith Hershman - just intonation marimba<br>      Andrew Bolotowsky - flute<br>      Jennifer Devore - cello<br>      Johnny Reinhard - conductor<br><br>Virgil Moorfield's (Slight Return) tread the same<br>territory as his Tzadik release "The Temperature<br>in Hell is Over Three Thousand Degrees". Using a<br>48 tone equal temperament tuning in a<br>"coloristic" way, he still attacks the keyboard like<br>the drummer he is. The band was in attack mode<br>too: Cellist David Eggar and violinist Tom Chiu<br>aggressively bowed their instruments, guitarist<br>Steven Antonelli played lines full of large interval<br>jumps. At one point, Eggar picked up a bass<br>guitar and after a burst of dissonance, proceeded<br>to bow the instrument with an ebow and tune the<br>strings down. By the end of the work, the whole<br>band was bending notes, unwinding strings,<br>sliding all over the place. Before performing the<br>piece with his ensemble, the composer informed<br>us that although the he was going to explore a<br>psychoacoustic phenomenon called Just<br>Noticeable Difference, the piece was really<br>inspired by a beetle that flew into his ear once. <br><br>      Virgil Moorfield Ensemble:<br>      Tom Chiu - violin<br>      David Eggar - cello<br>      Evans Wohlforth - guitar<br>      Tim Otto - baritone saxophone<br>      Virgil Moorfield - synthesizer<br><br>John Schneider played Lou Harrison's Suite #2<br>for Guitar. Each of the five movements required a<br>different tuning. Schneider handled this with two<br>guitars, one with interchangeable fingerboards.<br>Suite #2 for Guitar is related to the Suite #2 on<br>the Just West Coast cd - Threnody and Waltz for<br>Evelyn are the common movements. As always,<br>Harrison's music is a joy to hear, much of his<br>music is lush and beautiful and stylistically is<br>influenced by both European and Asian music.<br>Schneider, of course, did extreme justice to the<br>music. <br><br>Schneider also performed his arrangement of<br>Fratres by Arvo Pï¿½rt, was rearranged for viola,<br>guitar and cello in just intonation. With the trio<br>spread out a bit - the cello drone was a few feet<br>back , the musicans arranged in a diamond - the<br>chapel bounced back a lot of the pitch creating a<br>shimmering cloud of meditation. <br><br>      Anastasia Solberg - viola<br>      John Schneider - just intonation guitar<br>      Jennifer Devore - cello<br><br>Rumanian composer Violeta Dinescu's Din<br>Cinpoiu was performed on viola by Anastasia<br>Solberg. Spikey post-classical modern music.<br>Quarter tones. Yipes! <br><br>Like last years Odysseus Cello Concerto by<br>AFMM's Johnny Reinhard, Adam and Eve is a<br>new kind of theatre. Musicans act out the parts<br>and improvise polymicrotonaly all over the chapel.<br>Of note:<br><br>      While Paul Savior dramatically intoned the<br>      part of God into a microphone and guitar<br>      amp, ji guitarist Jon Catler picked a couple<br>      of chords for the opening section that<br>      made the hair on my arms stand up.<br>      Combine the sum and difference tones<br>      with St. Pauls ambience - there's more<br>      then a few seconds of reverb there, the<br>      resonance of the room probably added a<br>      few extra notes - and the result is a dense<br>      consonant chord. The effect was so<br>      stunning that some listener's later<br>      complained that the guitar was too loud. A<br>      tiny amp with the volume set to three:<br>      Lightweights! That was God talking, what<br>      did you expect??? <br><br>      Michiyo Suzuki was the perfect snake:<br>      crouching down, pointing her clarinet up,<br>      then down, standing up, wearing flowing<br>      legato clothing. <br><br>      Christina Coppola, who danced in last<br>      year's Odysseus as a Siren, returned as<br>      Eve. Her performance was equally<br>      expressive this year.<br><br>      Tree of Knowledge David Eggar, cello<br>      wore a mask while abusing his cello and<br>      Forbidden Fruit Ron Kosak, english horn,<br>      skronked some serious harmonics. <br><br>      Joshua Pierce produced rain by playing<br>      the inside of the piano. The inside of the<br>      piano is always fun and the AFMM director<br>      sez that 12tet is microtonal! <br><br>      Tom Chui and Matt Maneri, violins talked<br>      back and forth as cats. Even as a cat<br>      fight! <br><br>      A double role was filled by Skip La Plante:<br>      as Giant Sloth on double bass and<br>      Anteater, using a long tube as a bass<br>      didjeridu, pointing the instrument towards<br>      the floor, the sky, even the stereo mikes<br>      recording the entire event. <br><br>      Johnny Reinhard as Adam, the dancing<br>      bassoonist. I realise that there aren't too<br>      many bassonists that dance at all. In high<br>      school, I played bassoon for a few months<br>      before the end and there was a guy trying<br>      to get me to play in marching band! JR<br>      danced his way into history with his light<br>      footed performance and new works like<br>      this should be performed more often.<br>      Pretty funny too! <br><br>      Of course Reinhard's solo was mind<br>      blowing too. Dyads and triads on the<br>      bassoon. Everybody should do that kind of<br>      stuff on their horn.<br><br>      Eve - Christina Coppola: dancer,<br>      choreography<br>      Adam - Johnny Reinhard: bassoon<br>      God - Paul Savior: actor, Jon Catler:<br>      electric just intonation guitar<br>      Tree of Knowledge - David Eggar: cello<br>      Snake - Michiyo Suzuki: clarinet<br>      Forbiden Fuit - Ron Kozak: English horn<br>      Fate - Frank Malloy, Orlando Colon: djimbe<br>      Antelope and Sound - Don Conreaux:<br>      shofar, gong<br>      Wart Hog, Kudu - Tom Horgan:<br>      contrabass racket, bass sordon<br>      Birds - Andrew Bolotowsky: lutes<br>      Cats - Tom Chiu, Matt Maneri: violins<br>      Whale, Deer - Steven Antonelli: slide<br>      guitar, mandolin<br>      Giant Sloth, Anteater - Skip La Plante:<br>      double bass, bass didjeridu<br>      Rain - Joshua Pierce: piano<br>      Punctuation - Virgil Moorfield: percussion<br>      Set - Carol Lopresto and Orlando<br>      Brugnola<br><br>Picks:<br>Atom Turning In The Heart Of The Sun - Sasha<br>Bogdanowitch<br>Slight Return - Virgil Moorefield<br>Suite #2 for Guitar - Lou Harrison<br>Adam and Eve - Johnny Reinhard<br><br>db <br>5/21/98<br><br><br>day two<br><br>Gong Elegy (author unknown) was performed by<br>Mysterious Tremendum Sacred Tone Ensemble with Don<br>Conreaux as gong master of ceremonies. A rather<br>beautiful mysterious affair, very much like a ritual. A pair of<br>monks glide in playing their instruments, a veiled woman<br>sits playing singing bowls, a man in white appears from<br>behind the altar and shouts while Conreaux in black and<br>sunglasses swinging the gong around. <br><br>      Mysterious Tremendum Sacred Tone Ensemble<br>      Don Conreaux - gong, conch shell and horn<br>      Randee Ragin - Tibetan singing bowls, ting sha and<br>      voice<br>      Johnny Reinhard - bassoon<br>      David Smith - vocals<br>      Linda Wetherill - flutes, microtonal rods, voice<br>      Andrew Salcius - cello, voice<br>      Graham Hubbel - didjeridoo, conch shell,<br>      shakuhachi flute, harmonica, voice<br>      Doron Yomtov - didjeridoo, conch shell, ney, bells,<br>      voice<br><br>Rebecca Pechefsky struggled through four of J.S. Bach's<br>Preludes and Fugues from the Well Tempered Clavier in<br>Werkmeister III. The performance was so tentative at first,<br>Pechefsky seemed to either have a case of stage fright or<br>she was sight reading the pieces. Towards the end as she<br>gained confidence, the harpsichord started to slip out of<br>tune. <br><br>James Tenney"s Spectrum II for wind quintet was a gem.<br>Full of long droning tones, pieces like this are perfect for<br>the resonant St. Pauls Chapel. The chapel must have a<br>decay of 10 or 15 seconds making Spectum II even more<br>lush then it already is. <br><br>Some people remarked later that the the piece "didn't<br>grab them", "wasn't as good as his other works" or even<br>that they flat out didn't like the piece. Nay folks, I thought<br>the piece was beautiful. Very much in the relm of Morton<br>Feldman or La Monte Young. The work used an 11 tone<br>19 limit harmonic just intonation tuning. <br><br>ratio 1/1 17/16 9/8 19/16 5/4 21/16 11/8 3/2 25/16 13/8 7/4<br>cents  0   105  202  298  386  471   551 702  773   841 969<br><br>      Andrew Bolotowsky - flute<br>      Ron Kozak - English horn<br>      Michiyo Suzuki - bass clarinet<br>      Johnny Reinhard - bassoon<br>      Greg Evans - French horn<br><br>After years of hearing bad 1/4 tone music, neo-classical<br>Cozenage by Howard Rovics was quite a relief. I<br>particularly liked the up tempo last movement. <br><br>Andrew Bolotowsky - flute<br>Johnny Reinhard - bassoon<br>Judith Hershman - marimba<br>Howard Rovics - synthesizer<br><br>Johnny Reinhard intoned Harry Partch's December 1942<br>with John Schneider playing his adapted guitar. It's always<br>a joy to hear Partch performed, but I miss hearing his<br>voice. I look forward to hearing Schneider's forthcoming<br>recording of the piece. <br><br>Jon Catler's Sleeping Beauty started with him playing slide<br>on a guitar "prepared" with a bridge in the middle of the<br>neck. He'd play the play behind this bridge and the<br>vibrations of strings on the other side of the bridge would<br>be amplified by the pickups. In another section, while the<br>rest of the ensemble droned, Catler played arpeggios<br>while he stood on a wah wah pedal. Not the<br>wacka-wacka of Eric Clapton on White Room but a way of<br>focusing the chord. In other sections, melodies more<br>closely resembled the melodic material found on the<br>Birdhouse tape and the Catler Bros. cd "Crash Landing".<br>The acoustic instruments really should have been<br>amplified: Catler and ensemble turned in a fine<br>performance that was warped by the acoustics of the<br>chapel. <br><br><br>      Jon Catler - electric just intonation guitar<br>      Johnny Reinhard - bassoon<br>      Young-Ling Chan - bassoon<br>      Skip LaPlante - canon/dulcimer<br><br>Picks:<br>Gong Elegy (author unknown)- Mysterious Tremendum<br>Sacred Tone Ensemble<br>Spectrum II - James Tenny<br>December 1942 - Harry Partch<br>Sleeping Beauty - Jon Catler<br><br>Information about the American Festival of Microtonal<br>Music: http://www.echonyc.com/~jhhl/AFMM/ <br><br>db <br>5/25/98<br><br><br>This and other reviews of new music can be found at url:<br><br>http://www.virtulink.com/immp/jux/j_index.htm<br><br><br><br>* D a v i d        B e a r d s l e y<br>*           xouoxnoREMOVE-THIS@virtulink.com<br>*<br>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br>*<br>* http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm<br><br><br><br><br>-- <br>* D a v i d        B e a r d s l e y<br>*           xouoxnoREMOVE-THIS@virtulink.com<br>*<br>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br>*<br>* http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</div>
