I <br>have a question or two for you.<br><br>First, do any of you have any ideas on how to notate scales that divide <br>the octave into more or less than 12 steps?  The standard 5-line system <br>doesn't really do it for me.  <br><br>Second, being new to this tuning thing, are there any books that will <br>explain the concepts?  <br><br>any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.  <br><br>:)<br>Thanks, <br>Chris<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 19 Oct 1996 00:53 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03148; Sat, 19 Oct 1996 00:55:13 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03145<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id PAA20018; Fri, 18 Oct 1996 15:55:10 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 18 Oct 1996 15:55:10 -0700<br>Message-Id: <25961018225452/0005695065PK3EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3794 href="#3794">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/20/1996 10:09:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> schismatic temperaments should refer <br>> only to those with fifths larger than 700 cents. Otherwise, the diatonic <br>> thirds are purer than the schismatic thirds, and the tuning is better <br>> characterized as a meantone temperament<br><br>   That strikes me as a curious comment considering that third-, quarter-,<br>fifth-, and sixth-comma meantone all have fifths smaller than 700c.  <br><br><br><br>> It doesn't seem useful to characterize a tuning as a tempering of the <br>> pythagorean comma unless the tuning in question is an equal temperament.<br><br>   I'm inclined to agree.  I suspect that Manuel used that either as a just a<br>convenient point of comparison.  Or perhaps he used it from the more<br>well-temperamentish perspective of being able to sum the temperings of fifths<br>around the circle (12 total) and arrive at -1.  That of course only works when<br>you temper things in terms of the pythagorean comma rather than syntonic.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 20 Oct 1996 19:08 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04291; Sun, 20 Oct 1996 19:10:38 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04296<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id KAA05601; Sun, 20 Oct 1996 10:10:35 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 20 Oct 1996 10:10:35 -0700<br>Message-Id: <961020170425_71670.2576_HHB70-4@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
