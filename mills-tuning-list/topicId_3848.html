Some express very strong opinions in favor<br>of<br>MT, some express very strong opinions in favor of EQT, and some indicate<br>that<br>they find very little difference in sound between the differently tuned<br>versions.  The majority of those whom I've tested have felt that the<br>difference which the tuning system makes to the sound of a performance is<br>appreciable.  Many have expressed surprise, even astonishment, that a<br>factor<br>such as tuning system could make such a difference to the sound of music<br>performed on a piano.  I have found indications of consistently different<br>percentage breakdowns for different subgroups among those whom I^Rve<br>tested.<br>Among some subgroups, majorities preferred some MT versions.<br><br>	I suspect that the 30 MT, 40 EQT, 30 equal preference breakdown is<br>specific to the group I've tested and that different breakdowns would be<br>found for different populations.  Also, most of those whom I^Rve tested had<br>never heard music performed on a piano in 1/4 MT temperament before, or in<br>anything other than EQT.  I believe that with increased exposure, greater<br>percentages, I<br>believe well over 50%, would prefer the sound of 1/4 MT music for<br>arrangements<br>which could be performed in that tuning.<br><br>	I believe that despite all uncertainties, it is safe to say that<br>surprisingly wide differences between individuals with respect to their<br>reactions to the sound of piano music in 1/4 MT will be found.  I think<br>most of us find the idea that something which sounds pleasing and<br>harmonious to us sounds unpleasant and distorted to someone next to us<br>hearing the same thing to be disturbing and counterintuitive.  Still, these<br>differences keep turning up in many different situations.<br><br>	I once tested a total of about 30 individuals with contrasting<br>phrases,<br>one in an artificial tuning half way between EQT and JI and the other in an<br>artificial tuning quote OVERTEMPERED unquote 50% beyond EQT.  In this case,<br>80% of those tested preferred the tuning half way between EQT and JI, 10%<br>indicated equal preference, and 10% indicated preference for the<br>overtempered<br>versions.  Many said that the overtempered phrases sounded really<br>irritating -<br>made them angry.  The balance for EQT vs the novel 1/4 MT was much more<br>even.</div>
