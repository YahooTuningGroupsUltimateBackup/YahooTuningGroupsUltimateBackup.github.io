The only<br>exception might be that "visually" at least what I saw was pretty<br>equidistant.  The odds that the Neanderthal had worked out an "equal<br>temperament" are larger than the New York Lottery on a high yield night,<br>though.<br><br>Spoofs on April 1st must be more earnestly looked for, I'm afraid.  New<br>York's Channel 1 on cable started its news segment with Mayor Guiliani<br>taking Janet Reno's spot in D.C.  It was rendered professionally and<br>seemed quite believeable...until he said "April's Fools!"<br><br>An example that got my craw (and still disappoints me) was an early Ear<br>Magazine article purporting to divine the tuning used by Benjamin Franklin<br>in his sole string quartet.  Even aside from the question of authorship of<br>the string quartet (no longer thought to be Ben Franklin's in<br>musicological circles), this was a non-April's Fools day article that<br>pretended 5-limit just intonation for the piece.  <br><br>Sadly, I believed this "article," surrounded by a legacy of valuable Ear<br>articles.  I caught up with the admitted perpetrater at<br>a La Monte Young concert that we were both performing in.  <br><br>La Monte later told me afterward he felt bad that he had taught the<br>just intonation principles to the "funster" in composition lessons.  The<br>ideas were lifted and used fancifully under a false name to claim a<br>false discovery.  Perhaps if he had written his spoof on a clear April<br>1st I would be more accepting of his deception.<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@idt.net<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 13 Apr 1997 18:31 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00734; Sun, 13 Apr 1997 18:31:00 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00732<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id JAA17460; Sun, 13 Apr 1997 09:26:34 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 13 Apr 1997 09:26:34 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01541101af766d832c22@[207.207.2.3]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5299 href="#5299">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/14/1997 2:13:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Harold Fortuin wrote:<br><br>''European list members: for those of you with an interest in freely atonal<br>music, please seek out the music of Ruggles. It's some of the best of its<br>kind, and I<br>think it's not well-known across the Atlantic.''<br><br>I think that many list members might be surprised to learn that twentieth<br>century American music is probably better represented in European<br>concert/radio programs than in programs in America. What is most<br>interesting, however, is that it is works of the American experimental<br>tradition that get played, not of the ''Academic'' varieties. I would guess<br>that both Ruggles and Crawford-Seeger are better known (i.e. included in<br>High School-level music courses; concert programs; broadcasts) here than in<br>the U.S.. In Germany, at least, the rehearsal system is advantageous in<br>that the performers are usually paid for adequate preparation time and the<br>ensembles  usually have a core membership that guarantees some continuity<br>not found in American freelance groups.<br><br>The musical highlights of my time in Frankfurt have all been performances<br>of American music: two different performances of Ives Fourth Symphony<br>(Peter Eo''tvo''s is a brilliant Ives conductor), all of the orchestral<br>works of Morton Feldman, the Cage _Europeras_, and the festival intended<br>for Cage's eightieth birthday. Curiously, I have heard more live music here<br>by La Monte Young (two premieres) and Alvin Lucier (solo concert, premier<br>of his (microtonal) string quartet, installations) than I managed to hear<br>while studying with both in five years living near NYC.<br><br>Curiously, when the U.S. Information Agency sponsors concert tours, they<br>are usually limited to the academic set (Carter, Babbitt, Harbison et al);<br>the performances are typically under-rehearsed and have made little impact<br>on the musical life here. <br><br>A look at a standard reference work in German, Ulrich Dibelius's _Moderne<br>Musik II_, will show that the following Americans receive more than passing<br>mention: Brown, Cage, Feldman, Glass, Nancarrow, Reich, Riley, Chr. Wolff,<br>Young. It is interesting to see that Arnold Dreyblatt and Harry Partch<br>receive as much attention as Carter or Babbit.<br><br>I have often said that I had to come to Europe to become an American<br>composer - and this is mostly because I had to come to Europe to hear<br>American music!  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 14 Apr 1997 13:00 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01388; Mon, 14 Apr 1997 13:00:01 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01386<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id DAA16300; Mon, 14 Apr 1997 03:57:25 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 14 Apr 1997 03:57:25 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.970414002003.213378B-100000@quake.garlic.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
