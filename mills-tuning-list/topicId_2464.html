There<br>is work done by Jamshed J. Barucha who uses a connectionist model<br>which for example can also detect when the key is ambiguous. Other<br>work in this regard did H. John Maxwell. He proposed a set of 55 rules<br>to answer the two questions: Which vertical sonorities are chords? and<br>What is the key?<br>I presume these methods can be used as input to a dynamic intonation<br>algorithm, but to my knowledge this hasn't been done yet. Judgeing<br>from these papers however it looks quite difficult to capture the<br>abstract state called key in a set of fixed methods. Though Maxwell<br>has come rather close.<br>Perhaps there are advantages if dynamic intonation methods would also<br>try to identify cadences instead of focusing on how to get chords in<br>tune, for other music than chorales or so.<br><br>References<br>Barucha, Jamshed J. _MUSACT: A connectionist model of musical<br>harmony_.
