I think I was wrong that<br>Unisyn will do what you need with the FB-01. <br>But MAX is not expensive (certainly old version 2.5<br>which will accomodate some on-the fly pitchbend like<br>you're proposing) and is useful for many other<br>composing needs.<br><br>It'd help to know what the whole system (including<br>guitar-midi and Finale(?) is meant to do.  I know what<br>it's like being *short on cash* - which is why I myself never<br>got into Finale!<br><br>What comes to mind is the guitar controller running a <br>MIDI device through MAX.  Could sound fun.  You might find<br>a KORG 05R/W cheap - plus they're very small.  Nice<br>sampled sounds, guitar, harp, etc.<br><br>If you simply need to hear some Xen tunings then I'd look<br>into a software-only product, Like the old MusicWorks<br>that did 8-bit additive and such.  How does that $15 program<br>of Chadabe's called "M" do?  Anybody?<br><br>Cheers<br>Rick S.</div>
