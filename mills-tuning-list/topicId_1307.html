Haverstick)</h3><span>12/1/1996 10:34:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Haverstick here...this post has been brewing for a while...let me say<br>that it is not inspired by anything I've read here at all, but may <br>overlap in places with some things others have said. The deal is this;<br>I am a musician first, theorist second, and my approach to other tunings<br>is from a very practical viewpoint: I want to make some music that kicks<br>ass, and has some substance to it...the MUSIC is first, the theory of<br>the tuning system follows. Thus, my dilemma...over the last 7 years,<br>I have heard a lot of music in non 12 tunings, but much of it, I hate<br>to say, is NOT happening by my standards of what a baaad musician is,<br>or should be...in other words, microdoodling. Basically, a lot of<br>what I have heard sounds like theorists who are demonstrating their<br>theories on musical instruments, rather than musicians letting her<br>rip...the dreaded word "academic" seems appropriate here. The sad<br>part, though, is that much of the non 12 music I have heard I will<br>not play for anyone...I am concerned that this sort of dry doodling<br>will do more to drive folks away from "microtonality" than it will<br>to draw them in...now, since I have a mission in life to help end<br>the reign of 12 eq as the dominant tuning, this is very frustrating<br>to me...I WANT to hear my fellow microdudes playing their asses off,<br>but this seems to be rare in the field, with some notable exceptions,<br>of course.<br>In fact, just recently, a fellow microtonalist (who IS killer) told<br>me that he would not play, for his own friends, a CD he appeared on<br>as sideman for a wellknown microtonal composer because it sucked..<br>I agreed wholeheartedly with this assessment, since I think this CD<br>is awful...yet, the gentleman in question is revered in some circles<br>as a major talent...I think it's a case of the Emperor's new clothes<br>again...look, I came up in a hard school, and was blessed to meet<br>and be taught by some genius who could cut you to shreds and leave<br>you bleeding on the floor...but, you DID profit by it if you got the<br>message and went home and practiced...and I did just that, and got<br>my chops way up (and I still practice). Yes, there are many genius<br>level personalities in the tuning firld, but there is a big gap<br>between the level of the theories and the level of expertise on the<br>actual playing field.<br>There are a couple of areas here that are at fault...1. there seems<br>to be a very low level of just plain technical skills when it comes<br>to actually playing an instrument...I actually think my7 year old<br>daughter's noodlings on her 12 tone mini keyboard are as interesting<br>as a lot of the stuff I've heard by the microdoodlists...guys, just<br>cause one plays in a cool tuning doesn't mean it's gonna hold water<br>unless you can play your axe...sorry, and I do not mean to insult<br>anyone here...2...I've also noticed a terrible lack of synthesizer<br>programming skills as well...cheesy tones and patches seem to be the<br>norm in the microdoodling realm...a lack of imaginationseems to be the problem here. and 3. a real serious lack of compo-<br>sitional skills as well. By this< i mean that in a lot of the pieces<br>I hear, there seems to be a basic idea presented, which is often<br>not bad, but then it goes nowhere, other than a few minutes of sort<br>of, well, doodling around, and then out...I'm left saying, "go on, develop those ideas!"   Oops, my service is going to cut me off...I will <br>post more later...but, here's the remedy to microdoodling: PRACTICE<br>YOUR AXES, AND LEARN TO PLAY WELL, AND THEN YOUR IDEAS WILL HAVE MORE<br>SUBSTANCE...make the music as powerful as your theories, and then we<br>can take over the world...thanks...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 2 Dec 1996 07:56 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14279; Mon, 2 Dec 1996 07:58:34 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13301<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id WAA05838; Sun, 1 Dec 1996 22:58:31 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 1 Dec 1996 22:58:31 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612020655.XAA24326@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
