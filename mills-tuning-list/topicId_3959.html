Kirnberger's Tuning: the Lambert-Marpurg Developments<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Interestingly, Kirnberger shared his concept with the eminent<br>mathematician Leonhard Euler. Johann Heinrich Lambert further<br>developed and published it in 1774 in the _Memoires de l'academie<br>royale des sciences et belle lettres_ (Berlin), pp. 64ff.[2]<br><br>In turn, the notable musician and tuning theorist Friedrich Wilhelm<br>Marpurg reported Lambert's method and later translated this theorist's<br>essay into German, adding a commentary praising its accuracy.[3] Here<br>there may have been a bit of irony, since Kirnberger was generally<br>opposed to 12-tet while Marpurg favored it:<br><br>              Marpurg praised Lambert's method and pointed out<br>              that its deviations from exact equal temperament<br>              never exceed .00001. Another advantage of this<br>              method is that it does not require a monochord.<br>              Marpurg, who supported equal temperament and was<br>              violently opposed to Kirnberger's views on<br>              temperament as well as on harmony, was only too<br>              eager to point out that this feature of Lambert's<br>              method invalidated one of Kirnberger's objections<br>              to equal temperament.[4]<br><br>In other words, while it had previously seemed necessary (using<br>18th-century keyboard tuning technology) to tune 12-tet by reference<br>to a standard monochord or other instrument lending itself to a<br>geometric rule or the like for defining the 100-cent intervals, the<br>Kirnberger-Lambert-Marpurg approach in theory called only for the<br>tuning by ear of pure fifths and thirds to generate each 16384:10935<br>fifth (or 10935:8192 fourth) of the scale.<br><br>As Barbour notes in his classic history -- in a portion with which,<br>unfortunately, I was less familiar at the time of my first post --<br>Marpurg "believed that the tuning of the just intervals used in [this<br>method]  could be made more quickly and accurately than the estimation<br>by ear of the tempering needed for the fourth or fifth."[5]<br><br>However, Owen Jorgensen observes in his thorough 1991 account of the<br>same tuning that quite apart from the large number of pure intervals<br>that would need to be tuned, small errors would tend to accumulate<br>that could make accurately closing the circle of fifths quite<br>problematic[6]. While Barbour and Jorgensen are known at times to<br>differ in their viewpoints, the latter in this case seems to agree<br>also with the former's observation that in addition to issues of<br>accuracy in practice, there is also "the labor of tuning eight pure<br>intervals in order to have only one tempered interval!"[7]<br><br>--------------------------------<br>2. Farey's (Re)discovery of 1807<br>--------------------------------<br><br>Both Barbour and Jorgensen additionally document how this tuning was<br>apparently _re_-"discovered independently" in England by a certain<br>John Farey, who on 21 June 1807 chronicled his discovery that a chain<br>of "five just fourths minus two just fifths minus one just major third<br>create a fifth that is almost identical to an equal temperament<br>fifth. Today, this type of fifth is known as a `schisma fifth,' and it<br>has a ratio of 16384 to 10935."[8]<br><br>As Jorgensen notes, Farey described this method as "new" because "he<br>thought he had discovered it" -- although, as we know, Kirnberger,<br>Lambert, and Marpurg actually had precedence.[9] <br><br>Having myself stumbled upon this possibly "new" concept -- although as<br>noted in my original post, I knew that the schisma fifth had been<br>documented, and was uncertain at that time only as to whether a<br>complete quasi-12-tet scale had been published -- I can testify to the<br>excitement that Farey might also have experienced.<br><br><br>----------------------------------------<br>3. Helmholtz-Ellis and the Schisma Fifth<br>----------------------------------------<br><br>Paul Erlich has mentioned the names of Hermann L. F. Helmholtz and his<br>translator Alexander J. Ellis as documenters of this tuning, and they<br>do indeed document the schisma fifth and its very close approximation<br>to a 12-tet fifth, Ellis giving the difference as 0.001280 cents.[10]<br>While I'm not sure that either would be too anxious to take credit for<br>promoting a tuning using just intervals to approximate 12-tet <grin>,<br>this measurement of what I playfully referred to in my post as the<br>"scintilla of Artusi" is certainly worthy of recognition.<br><br>Additionally, the schisma fifth or fourth does actually appear in a<br>Ellis tuning for the harmonium designed as a practical realization of<br>the "Helmholtzian temperament" based theoretically on obtaining pure<br>major thirds by flattening each fifth by 1/8 of a schisma. However,<br>since Ellis finds such a small temperament impossible to tune<br>accurately by ear, it appears to me that a whole schisma is therefore<br>dumped on one fifth at certain points in the chain so that a small<br>number of fifths or fourths are "700 cents down or 500, in place of<br>702 and 498 as all the others."[11]<br><br>This procedure might be treated as a pre-digital equivalent of<br>nanotemperament, the problem here being not the tuning limitations of<br>a digital synthesizer but the limited discriminations possible for the<br>human ear. In either case, rounding off a few intervals further from<br>just than might otherwise be necessarily helps to minimize the<br>inaccuracies of the tuning as a whole.<br><br><br>----------------------------------------------<br>4. A small difference -- not necessarily "new" <br>----------------------------------------------<br><br>One rather trivial difference between what I've seen _so far_ of<br>Kirnberger-Lambert-Marpurg or Farey lines of quasi-12-tet just tuning<br>and my proposal is that the former seem to generate a 10935:8196<br>schisma fourth by combining seven pure fifths and a pure major third,<br>i.e. a Pythagorean apotome of 2187:2048 (about 113.69 cents) and a<br>pure 5:4 (about 386.31 cents), or almost exactly 500 cents in all.<br><br>Maybe because of my fascination with the schisma major third of<br>8192:6561 (about 384.36 cents) and its role in early 15th-century<br>keyboard music, I approached the problem as one of building a schisma<br>fifth from this familiar interval plus an appropriate type of minor<br>third. An m3 at a pure 6:5 (about 315.64 cents) neatly fills this<br>role, and provides another (and longer) road to the same "12-tet by<br>just intonation" destination as the apotome-plus-pure-M3 solution.<br><br>In fact, from an even marginally "practical" point of view, the<br>well-documented Kirnberger and Farey approach generates each schisma<br>fourth with only seven pure fifths plus a pure M3, as opposed to the<br>_eight_ pure fifths plus a pure m3 required for the approach described<br>in my post.<br><br>However, I would be anything but surprised to see this minor variant<br>on Kirnberger's scheme also documented in the published literature,<br>possibly, like the basic scheme itself, early and often. <br><br><br>                             -----<br>                             Notes<br>                             -----<br><br>1. Helpful modern sources of documentation include a note in an<br>English translation by David Beach and Jurgen Thym of Kirnberger's<br>treatise _The Art of Strict Musical Composition_ (New Haven and<br>London: Yale University Press, 1982), p. 20 n. h; J. Murray Barbour's<br>classic _Tuning and Temperament: A Historical Survey_ (East Lansing:<br>Michigan State College Press (1953), pp. 64-65; and Owen Jorgensen's<br>Jorgensen, Owen H.., 1991. _Tuning: Containing The Perfection of<br>Eighteenth-Century Temperament, The Lost Art of Nineteeth-Century<br>Temperament, and the Science of Equal Temperament, Complete with<br>Instructions for Aural and Electronic Tuning_ (East Lansing: Michigan<br>State University Press, 1991), pp. 312-313.<br><br>2. Barbour, op. cit., pp. 64-65; Beach and Thym, eds. and trs.,<br>op. cit., p. 20 n. h; Jorgensen, op. cit., p. 312.<br><br>3. Barbour, ibid.; Beach and Thym, ibid. One primary source I have<br>found on microcard (similar to microfiche) is Marpurg's translation of<br>Lambert and commentary in his _Historisch-kritisch Beytrage zur<br>Aufnahme der Musik_, vol. 5. part 6 (Berlin, 1778), pp. 417-450.<br><br>4. Beach and Thym, ibid.<br><br>5. Barbour, see n. 1, p. 65.<br><br>6. Jorgensen, see n. 1, p. 312. Unfortunately, while I was familiar<br>when posting my original article with a brief description of the<br>"schisma fifth" in the glossary of Jorgensen's earlier _Tuning the<br>Historical Temperaments by Ear_ (Marquette: Northern Michigan<br>University Press, 1977), I was not aware of his full account of the<br>Kirnberger and Farey "quasi-12-tet" in this latter work. The heading<br>is "Tuning Equal Temperament by Using Just Intonation Techniques in<br>1807," referring to the date of Farey's account.<br><br>7. Jorgensen (1991), ibid., p. 312; Barbour, see n. 1, p. 65.<br>Jorgensen remarks on "the degree of perfection" required in<br>tuning so many pure intervals makes it "more difficult" than "modern<br>tempering methods" for obtaining 12-tet, although "[u]sually, just<br>intonation is considered easier for amateurs." Barbour focuses more<br>specifically on the traditional view that tuning a pure major third is<br>a difficult task. "If this be true, a type of tuning in which the<br>essential feature is a pure major third could not be very<br>accurate..."<br><br>7. Barbour, ibid.<br><br>8. Jorgensen, see n. 1, p. 312, the source of the quote; and also<br>Barber, ibid., who notes that Farey's version was communicated across<br>the Atlantic, appearing in "Dr. Rees's _New Cyclopedia_" (1st American<br>edition, Vol. 14, Part 1, article on "Equal Temperament"), in which<br>"we are shown how Farey's method `differs only in an insensible<br>degree' from correct equal temperament."<br><br>9. Jorgensen, ibid.<br><br>10. Hermann L. F. Helmholtz, with translation, notes, and Appendices<br>by Alexander J. Ellis, _On the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological<br>Basis for the Theory of Music_, 6th ed. (New York: Peter Smith, 1948),<br>p. 316, n. at *. Helmholtz having noted that difference between a<br>perfect fifth and what is now known as a schisma fifth is "about the<br>same as that between a perfect and an equally tempered fifth," Ellis<br>offers a more precise calculation in order to show "the extreme<br>closeness of the result..." He takes a schisma of 32805:32768 as<br>1.953721 cents, and the narrowing of a 12-tet fifth as 1.955001 cents:<br>"Difference .001280 cents. Human ears, however much assisted by human<br>contrivances, could never hear the difference." Ibid., p. 432 at<br>"Art. 10," Ellis again emphasizes the virtual identity of these two<br>intervals: "The Skhisma will therefore be considered as the twelfth<br>part of a Pythagorean Comma, and also as the error of an equal Fifth."<br>Jorgensen, ibid., observes that "the ear cannot distinguish between<br>just intonation quasi-equal temperament and equal temperament."<br><br>11. Helmholtz and Ellis, ibid., pp. 316-317, last note beginning at<br>bottom of 316. In the table included in this note, schisma fourths of<br>virtually 500 cents are found in moving from the bottom of column I to<br>the top of II; and likewise with columns II and III; IV and V; and V<br>and VI. Kirnberger also originally arrived at the schisma fourth or<br>fifth "in the process of developing his own temperament" (i.e. an<br>unequal well-temperament), Beach and Thym, see n. 1, 20 n. h;<br>Jorgensen, see n. 1, p. 312, refers to the account elsewhere in his<br>book of this Kirnberger well- temperament demonstrating how "the<br>schisma fifth G-flat D-flat" arises from a chain of seven pure fifths<br>and fourths plus a pure major third.<br><br>Most respectfully,<br><br>Margo Schulter<br>mschulter@value.net</div>
