I'm going to look into this some more and see what<br>I can find.<br><br>The thing that triggered this thought were Darreg's comments and the stuff<br>I've seen while lurking on this list. It seems that the combinations and<br>permutations of musical scales/temperments is virtually infinite. So why<br>wouldn't we all have "one of our own"? And maybe find one that "resonated"<br>most closely with our"personal" temperment (pun intended) be the one we<br>prefer?<br><br>Interesting implications (maybe) for learning/therapy/musical ecstacy?<br><br>I think a good case can be made for possible infinite numbers of<br>scales/temperments. I'm wondering if a naive individual (if you could find<br>one) would (or could) come up with sound fragments that made up a "scale".<br><br>I like your idea of how to try to isolate this, as well as your ideas about<br>early influences having a bearing on preference. The idea of preference<br>might turn ou to be a chicken and egg thing if what I'm thinking (about<br>"personal" temperments) holds water.<br><br>Sanford Forte<br>Interactive Development Systems<br>Palo Alto,CA</div>
