Among other things, the placement<br>of the diminished fifth (_tritone_ ought to be saved for the pythagorean<br>729/512, on analogy with the ditone) allows for counterpoint with greaterfreedom for inverting voices, which becomes essential in tonal<br>counterpoint, canon, and fugue. However,  _melodically_ these modes<br>function perfectly well when the melodic rules for the more traditional<br>modes are followed (that is - Major as combination of mixolydian and lydian<br>and minor as a combination dorian, phrygian and lydian). In fact, I thinka<br>good case could be made for hearing early works in Major or minor as a kind<br>of rapid _raga malaka_ where changes of harmony allow local melodic<br>fragments to shift from one modal melodic type to another.<br><br>Although the study of musical intonation provides fertile ground for<br>hearing these things flexibly, all too often the result is the opposite. I<br>heard a lecture a decade or so ago by a famous African American composer<br>and theorist who wanted to analyse _all music_ in terms of the lydian mode<br>because it was the one where the the tonic coincided with the lowest termin a series of fifths. I pointed out that this was fine as a model for<br>composition - and many fine compositions were made using his model - but<br>could not be applied analytically to all music. In simple voice leading,<br>the diminished fifth of the lydian mode would always resolve to the<br>dominant and the Bach example he used simply didn't do this. The good<br>professor responded: ''And that's where Bach went wrong...''

''<br><br>This is not so. Rather: I hear particular patterns of harmonization as a<br>consequence of melodic modes. As Bill Alves says, Major and minor are modes<br>of the common diatonic collection just as well as any others. Their<br>historical prominence in the common practice era - as opposed to the<br>prominence of other modes in other eras - is attributable to the particular<br>suitability of the intervallic arrangement to harmonizations which can<br>project the first degree of the major scale as a tonic over the duration of<br>a piece. This is a fairly Schekerian statement, but as I noted in earlierpostings, I am also quite open to simultaneous interpretations of a work<br>where local melodic behavior is suggestive of other modes - a ''Raga<br>Malaka'' interpretation. Please note that my definition here is based upon<br>major to allow for the characteristic ambiguity of the minor, which pivots<br>between its own distinctive modal identity and one based upon the parallel<br>major scale with chromatic modifications.   The difficulty represented by this misunderstanding is similar to the<br>problem that mid-Rennaisance theorists in had dealing with the definitionof modes when not all voices in a polyphonic setting started or ended on<br>the final of the mode. Just because the thickened texture allowed for<br>chords with more pitches, doesn't mean that a piece whose bass is in d<br>dorian will have an alto in f lydian when the alto starts and ends on f. A<br>close study of that alto voice will probably reveal motion that is<br>uncharacteristic of a lydian melody. Counterpoint did indeed change the<br>modes, but the distinctiveness of the modes was determinative in how<br>actually counterpoint functioned.<br><br>In the common practice era, the rise of Major and minor corresponded<br>generally with the substitution of transposition for modulation (in the<br>sense of changing the melodic mode) as a means of generating tonal variety<br>over the duration of a piece, with the melodic contrast between minor andMajor leading to two distinct ways of coloring harmonic progressions thatwere functionally identical. This was accompanied by a general change in<br>the texture, towards a more homophonic arrangement of the voices, or rather<br>one in which the inner voices were decidedly subservient to the outer. The<br>striking cross relationships in Bach chorale harmonizations are one example<br>of this. The net result is that although the material resources of these<br>modes at the local level of a piece were not substantially different fromthose of earlier musics, the experience was quite distinct.<br><br>What, however, does this have directly do with tuning? I am afraid that the<br>more I ponder the music of the common practice era, the closer I come to<br>concluding that ''tonal music'' was composed with increasing disregard for<br>precise tuning. And the increasingly indistinct tuning was used to<br>represent or imply an increasingly broad harmonic language with unlimitedtransposition. Twelve tone and serial musics may even be worse off; a good<br>friend of mine recalls visting the studios of many composers in the fifties<br>- Boulez, Stockhausen, Nono among them - and all of them had out-of-tune<br>pianos. The first broadcast of the complete _Lulu_ featured intermissionswith George Perle playing analytical examples on an instrument where almost<br>every pitch had vibrato due to mistuned strings. In contrast, older musicis terribly sensitive to tuning. Simply playing dorian as d to d' on a just<br>major C scale won't work due to the comma shy fifth d - a; in pythagoreanthe opposite is often the case due to the ditone above the tonic,<br>resolution to which is demanded by the diminished fifth b - f. (A<br>discussion of the benefits and disadvantages of out-of-tuneness might be<br>worthwhile for this list...).<br><br>As to the general question of the survival of other modes in the tonal era:<br>Sibelius's _Seventh_, or any of Debussy's lydian works should be sufficient<br>- if late - counter-examples to the thesis that modal writing just stopped.<br><br>I wish to acknowlege that Harry Powers - author of the New Grove article on<br>''Mode and Melodic Type'' - greatly influenced my thinking on these issues<br>during his guest professorship at my graduate school. My definition of key<br>does differ from his but does so by going to a fairly radical reduction (a<br>group of seven consecutive members from a chain of fifths, with chromaticsubstitutions in the minor borrowed from the parallel Major). I find thisdefinition will be true for a wider repertoire than that defined in Groveand also one that is closer to the practices of notating and keyboarding,which are certainly signs and symptoms of the conceptual framework<br>underlying the system.

Well, I have the definite impression that most list contributors<br>>consider them to be fundamentally different.<br>><br>As would I, but I never claimed that pythagorean and 12TET were<br>"variations" of the same tuning system. I think that subsets of both can<br>reasonably represent diatonic modes.<br><br>>The point is, those augmented sixth chord arcana are more important *to<br>>understanding the music* than are the details of the tuning.<br><br>I think that all depends on the music. I think the value of tuning<br>knowledge for the understanding of music is greatly underrated in general.<br>(As Lou Harrison says: You haven't heard a piece until you've heard it in<br>the tuning that the composer intended or expected.) An intimate knowledge<br>of augmented sixth chords is likewise pretty useless in the understanding<br>of Partch, Indian music, or medieval music (even in the Renaissance and<br>Baroque augmented sixth chords are not that important).<br><br>My snide reference was meant to be a jab at conventional college "music<br>theory" curricula, which are really common-practice harmony courses --<br>courses that thus concentrate nearly exclusively on one dimension of one<br>type of music. To those students who unquestionably accept 12TET as the<br>words of the Prophet, an understanding of tuning systems is, I think, just<br>as valuable as how to resolve a Neapolitan sixth chord, if not more so.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
