Ivor was indeed pressed for time. But thanks to his work, (and <br>the internet) we<br>are now able to communicate with each other about a multitude of <br>subjects, in as much detail as we choose. Each post from each person <br>contributes to the whole from which each of us may glean whatever may be <br>of value to us. Though I have been primarily interested in higher <br>harmonics in the past, and now in an expanded version of Partch's <br>tonality diamond, I find the discourse on other systems to be <br>stimulating. The whole of knowledge is a better resource than any <br>militant subset (at least for me). Specialized systems like 88cet might <br>never be documented <br>at all if it weren't for Garys enthusiasm. Marions exploration of the <br>subharmonic series is profound. Even though Charles Lucie's ideas are <br>hard to accept as the perfect system, I find his perspective fascinating. <br>Now, Brian is challenging everything that comes before him, and <br>presenting evidence for his objections. We all win! <br>	Ivor was one of the most open minded people I ever met. He was <br>allways in favor of exploration. He encouraged work in any new field, and <br>applauded all developments, no matter how unusual they were. In his <br>kinder moments, he even acknowledged 12 tet as useful for certain purposes.<br>I guess I'm rambling. But my point is: I'm glad to be in a position to <br>communicate directly with such a diverse group of astute colleagues, and <br>to have access to so much valuable information. <br>	For those of you who think that I'm not being militant enough on the <br>side of just intonation, I would like to point out something that Easly <br>Blackwood once said: "There is no such thing as just intonation. All you <br>can do is approximate a ratio by some standard of precision. It all <br>depends on the tolorance that you are willing to accept". I think that the <br>same thing could be said about equal temperaments, as well. This all <br>comes to a head with David Canright's early work in which he showed that <br>any equal tempered scale could be described as an array of just ratios <br>when sufficiently high numbers are accepted in the ratios. <br>	I find limits on just intonation components to be useful for <br>compositional purposes as well as necessary for instrument construction, <br>but I cannot imagine why I would ever say "No music should be made using <br>intervals beyond the x limit". Unless I was concerned about the <br>playability of that music by someone other than it's creator. But even <br>that should not stop anyone from exploring the interest in their heart. <br>	Go, Xenharmonikers!<br><br>Denny Genovese<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 18 Oct 1995 18:26 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA13964; Wed, 18 Oct 1995 09:26:13 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 18 Oct 1995 09:26:13 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199510181624.JAA13795@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2174 href="#2174">ðŸ”—</a>Joshua Brandon Holden &#x3C;holden@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/20/1995 7:41:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>"John H.
