The site includes an<br>overview and ordering information, as well as links to other pages:<br>tables of contents, author index, subject index (forthcoming, maybe),<br>title index, and errata (forthcoming as soon as folks send me some).<br>Johnny tells me that Pitch will soon be available through the British<br>Harry Partch Society.  When that becomes a reality, I will update the<br>web site accordingly.<br><br>Pitch is a publication of the AFMM.  I am not affiliated with Pitch or<br>the AFMM in any way.  I am providing these web pages as a service to the<br>xenharmonic community.<br><br>John<br><br>---<br>John G.

The intervals<br>>available at any note are the same as those from any other note in the<br>>scale. ... Since every<br>>note can play every role as the context shifts, then the uniform availability<br>>of intervals at each note is required. So modulation pushes one to equal<br>>temperament.<br><br>   Or it could push you to dynamically-retuned just intonation.  That was<br>not even close to possible as little as two decades ago, but it's becoming<br>a reality as we speak.<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 5 May 1997 06:19 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04648; Mon, 5 May 1997 06:19:31 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04676<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id VAA22407; Sun, 4 May 1997 21:17:51 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 4 May 1997 21:17:51 -0700<br>Message-Id: <336D62BA.2501@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
