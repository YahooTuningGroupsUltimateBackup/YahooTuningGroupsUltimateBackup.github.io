I personally enjoy discussing all sorts of phenomenon, <br>and have found the forum lately to be quite lively and interesting. <br>People have been sharing their innermost thoughts and feelings about <br>life, and there's nothing more significant than that. Music is perhaps <br>the most "mystical" of arts, and to only discuss it in mathematical terms <br>is extremely boring...the math is cool, but it ain't the same thing as <br>DOING it. I wonder, as Morrison did a while back, how many folks on the <br>forum are real musicians, and how many are theorists...<br><br>Just as Brian Belet would prefer to see an end to the "mystical" thread, <br>I myself would like to see more on this forum about real music, as <br>opposed to math and theories...although I do have the highest respect for <br>the monsters of theory, to be sure, and have learned a lot from studying <br>them. Music transcends any form of logic, and for that I am <br>grateful...let the discussions continue...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 27 Mar 1997 23:00 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA19900; Thu, 27 Mar 1997 23:00:44 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA19885<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id NAA08112; Thu, 27 Mar 1997 13:59:12 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 27 Mar 1997 13:59:12 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B1E8ABF2F64BB.8F69@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
