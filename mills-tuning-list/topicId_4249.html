At its simplest, it is that we can know far more<br>about sounds than would be expected given the limitations of the cochlear=<br><br>system. First, much as taste is a complex of taste, scent, texture and<br>image, we have meaningful input to hearing from other senses, particularl=<br>y<br>the sense of touch. Both Beethoven and La Monte Young suffered catastroph=<br>ic<br>hearing losses, and the sense of touch in many ways compensated for this<br>loss, perhaps even augmenting it in ways that lead to unexpected<br>experiments. Harry Partch wanted the sounds of his Marimba Eroica to be<br>experienced through the whole body, not just by the ears. A large Javanes=<br>e<br>gong will be similarly experienced. The recent works of Young and Lucier<br>(and my own installations, if I may) demonstrate that the physical<br>locations of standing waves can be a powerful perceptive force for<br>relationship which appear to beyond the limits of audible discrimination.=<br><br>Particularly in the case of Young's ecstatic big band piece, I find it<br>impossible to decide whether this kind of perception is going on at a<br>precognitive or a cognitive level.  =<br><br><br>Which brings me to my second point: While Mr. Lumma locates what he calls=<br><br>'acoustic pleasure' in the cochlear system, I tend instead to go with tho=<br>se<br>who say that the central organ of pleasure is the brain. Although, as the=<br><br>example of Young's big band piece shows, it may be difficult to<br>discriminate exactly where the pleasure is located, it does demonstrate<br>that a kind of listening is going on which is beyond the design limitatio=<br>ns<br>which evolution left in our ears. When Mr. Erlich says "I prefer to build=<br><br>cognition upon, rather than reject, the biases of the psychological<br>system", I believe that he is confusing the cochlear apparatus with<br>psychology and introducing a division between cognition and psychology th=<br>at<br>is not clear.  =<br><br><br>Which brings me to a third point: Because of these demonstrable ways of<br>breaking through limitations, the fact that listening is highly sensitize=<br>d<br>by experience and training, and my own aesthetic interest that intonation=<br><br>can be a resource for doing more than enhancing traditional tonal pattern=<br>s,<br>I am lead always to be extremely skeptical when encountering black and<br>white or precisely quantified statements about musical intervals. For<br>example, when Mr. Lumma says:<br><br><any sensitivity to mistuning in melody (making comma<br><adjustments) must be at least an order of magnitude rougher than the<br><acoustic pleasure tolerance of 1-4 cents<br><br>I am more than a bit thrown back. If you have any short term pitch memory=<br>,<br>you can train yourself to listen for melodic commas and they become glari=<br>ng<br>features in a performance. The quantification of 'acoustic pleasure<br>tolerance' here, on the other hand, begs for qualification -- in what<br>registers?, with what durations?, with what instruments? etc..<br><br>Some small items: My response to both Babbitt and Balzano was not to<br>compositions of either (Balzano does not compose himself) but rather to<br>their musicianship. Babbitt has probably the best pitch memory I have eve=<br>r<br>encountered and Balzano is a close second. At a presentation in Santa Cru=<br>z<br>in the early eighties, Balzano was whistling little tunes in 20tet that h=<br>e<br>had learned after listening to a mass of random tones. When Mr. Erlich<br>wrote: "but it must have taken them some compositional ingenuity to avoid=<br><br>the tonal implications of simple intervals in order to make these other<br>features reign", I agree entirely, and indeed, throughout most of his<br>career Babbitt has avoided the appearance of tonal passages in his<br>surfaces, although his late works play with tonal relationships in ways<br>which project (as they say in Princeton) the underlying intervallic<br>structures. I don't dispute that Babbitt's music is unlikely ever to find=<br> a<br>wide audience, or that even a large part of the tiny audience that does<br>listen to the music is able to parse these features, but saturation of th=<br>e<br>music by these structures leads to a overall coherence that is more widel=<br>y<br>appreciable. (It's not my line of work, exactly, but I imagine that<br>Babbitt-like projection techniques could be usefully applied in CPS<br>environments.<br><br>Mr. Erlich wrote:<br><br><On the other hand, meantone is audibly superior to 12tET for 5-limit<br><diatonic music, and the important group property of transposability can<br><be recovered for meantone in 19 or 31tET. Musicians chose 12tET over 19<br><or 31tET only for convenience. Therefore, for Balzano or Clough to<br><ascribe features of tonal practice (ones that date back to the meantone<br><era) to properties of 12 which are not shared by 31, amounts to a sort<br><of revisionism that I object to.<br><br>The history of tunings is vague in many regards, and one of them is to<br>which degree musicians have been actively envolved in 'choosing' their<br>intonation, another is whether compositional innovation took place before=<br> a<br>tuning was invented or vice versa. While the simplest five-limit tonal<br>progressions in the central keys will sound better in meantone than in<br>12tet, tonal music that takes advantage of symmetry relations in 12tet --=<br><br>e.g. augmented, diminished, whole-tone, and  augmented sixth relations --=<br><br>is probably better off in 12tet than mapped to a meantone, although a 12<br>member meantone substitute -- as a MOS -- will share many group propertie=<br>s.<br>(This is striking when one compares the ornamented, _melodic_, and<br>preseumably meantone chromaticism of Haydn and Mozart, which the harmonic=<br><br>chromaticism of later generations.) I will have to read Clough more close=<br>ly<br>to defend him, but knowing Balzano's in more detail, I suspect that these=<br><br>properties could be considered to be as true for 12tet as for a 12-tone M=<br>OS<br>subset of 19 or 31.    =<br><br>Mr. Erlich and I will have to remain in disagreement about 22tet. Althoug=<br>h<br>I find out structure very useful for keyboarding instruments in JI (my<br>first tubulong, in 1977, had a 22-tone 5 limit tuning and was expandable =<br>to<br>29 tones with a 7 limit and 41 tones with an 11 limit; I also spent sever=<br>al<br>months in the seventies playing around with one of Ivor Darreg's 22tet<br>quitars), I find the representations of fifths and thirds in 22tet just t=<br>oo<br>rough to use with any sustained instruments or synthesis. I suppose that<br>this is just a case where we end up on opposite sides from our usual<br>arguments.<br><br>Finally, it is difficult to add to Ms. Schulter's posting except that Not=<br>re<br>Dame polyphony which she discusses might also be characterized as not<br>having been designed to be heard as independent melodies but rather as a<br>massed sonority, in which nearly every vertical combination of tones may =<br>be<br>used excepting at cadences. This is extremely close to the Javanese notio=<br>n<br>of  _seleh_(target pitches), which are played by the entire ensemble in<br>unison or with keyboard-distance fifths or octave and in between which<br>nearly every combination of tones is possible provided that the individua=<br>l<br>lines lead melodically to _seleh_. The effect is of a music that is<br>constantly moving between shadowy and clear sonorities, much as figures o=<br>n<br>the shadow puppet screan suddenly appear in focus.   =<br><br><br>         =<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1589<br>*************************</div>
