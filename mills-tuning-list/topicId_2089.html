He then went on to say that the (syntonic) comma is <br>inaudible and proceeded to ignore the difference in the rest of his <br>Treatise.  Later (if I recall correctly) he advocated ET without, presumably, <br>any effect on his theories.  It is clear that the ratios themselves were <br>merely an explanation for the origin of consonance and dissonance.<br><br>Modern players don't play in 12TET *per se*, they play *in tune* with each <br>other.  Most of the time that results in 12TET because a piano is being <br>used.
