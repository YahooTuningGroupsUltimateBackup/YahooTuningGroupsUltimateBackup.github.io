The 5th of the chord had to be raised<br>>slightly from ET so as to be a perfect 2:3 ratio--a really PERFECT 5th<br>with<br>>no temperament at all.  But if that same note served as the major 3rd of<br>>the chord, it had to be lowered so as to be a perfect 4:5 ratio.  Sure,<br>>it's a totally different approach and a very different sound from what<br>>we've all been trained in, but LORDY is it a pure, velvety sound.<br><br>>Try this:  sing that perfect 5th and then hold it while another singer<br>lays<br>>in the major third and slowly varies it over the acceptable range for the<br>>pitch.  You'll hear it when the beats disappear and every interval locks<br>in<br>>with every difference tone, and that will happen when the third is MUCH<br>>lower than you are used to.  <br><br>I'm familiar with all the arithmetic involved in figuring out different<br>temperaments, and I also know what sounds good to me.  But I have no<br>convenient way of relating the two!  <br><br>I basically want to do John's singing experiment on a<br>computer/synthesizer combination.  That is, I would like to produce a<br>tone at (say) 400 Hz; produce an approximate 5th, play with it until it<br>locks in (and see the number 600 appear on the monitor); add in the third<br>(and see it lock in at exactly 500); etc.  <br><br>What do I need?  I have a Power Macintosh with microphone; Finale; a<br>not-great synthesizer keyboard (I don't have make or model with me).  Is<br>there any useful software or hardware that will do this without breaking<br>the bank?  (Note:  suggesting that I buy a harpsichord and hire a<br>full-time tuner to be at my beck and call doesn't count as useful.)<br><br>I would be grateful for suggestions.<br>Neal Plotkin        nplotkin@umich.edu        (313)747-4088<br>University of Michigan Law School<br>313 Hutchins Hall<br>Ann Arbor MI 48109-1215<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 22 Sep 1995 05:47 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id UAA05793; Thu, 21 Sep 1995 20:47:16 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 21 Sep 1995 20:47:16 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9509212355.A29629-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
