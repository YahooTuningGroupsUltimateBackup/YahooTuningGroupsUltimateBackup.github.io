(By the<br>way, he's from Goa, which is a former Portugese colony in India, wherein most<br>everybody speaks a somewhat earlier form of Portugese than that spoken in<br>Portugal.  That presumably also explains why his name ends in "s" rather than<br>the Spanish spelling with "z".)<br><br>   Anyway, he's new to xenharmonics, and is interested in thoughts on<br>synthesizers and PC software for xenharmonic work.  He's currently thinking<br>about an Ensoniq TS-12 with Finale.  <br><br>   He's making a move soon, so if you folks have any insights or advice you'd<br>like to give him, drop him a letter (he doesn't have E-mail yet).  For example,<br>I'll warn him away from Finale.<br><br>   His address is:      Joel Rodrigues<br>                        c/o Queens;  Opp. P.W.D.<br>                        Fatorda, Salcette<br>                        Goa 403602<br>                        India<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 27 Nov 1995 05:31 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id TAA21282; Sun, 26 Nov 1995 19:31:39 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 26 Nov 1995 19:31:39 -0800<br>Message-Id: <951127032543_71670.2576_HHB47-2@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
