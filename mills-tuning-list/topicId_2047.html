Doesn't "quantization" denote equal divisions?  E.g., in what<br>> sense are the two spaces in 1:1, 9:8, 5:4 equal, or based on equal divisions<br>> of linear frequeny space, whatever that means?  Strange as it might seem,<br>> after years of picturing frequency space logarithmically, I can't get myself<br>> to visualize it linearally - it doesn't seem to make any sense that way.<br>> <br>> <br>David,<br><br>My limited understanding of the harmonic overtone series includes the idea<br>that the pitches of the series develop from a "perfectly" vibrating body; <br>a string or column of air, etc.  The fundamental is the frequency of the<br>full length of the body, the 2nd harmonic vibrates with 1 node and is<br>twice the frequency, 2/1; the 3rd partial has 2 nodes and is 3 times the<br>frequency, often expressed as 3/2, sounding 5th above the 2nd harmonic,<br>etc.  This "perfect" body vibrates in equal divisions, these divisions<br>vibrating in frequencies which define the harmonic series.  The intervals<br>between the pitches gets gradually smaller and I suppose ultimately any<br>and all intervals can be defined.  Mathematically the relationship of the<br>frequencies is logarithmic, but the pitches are very linear in their<br>creation.  It is interesting to me that 12tet has in many ways limited our<br>understanding of musical expression.  I play with several orchestras here<br>in Reno with some very talented musicians and every time I play the 7th<br>partial on my horn in warming up someone will look up wondering why I am<br>playing out of tune!<br><br>Bruce Kanzelmeyer<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 17 May 1997 03:01 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04394; Sat, 17 May 1997 03:01:52 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 17 May 1997 03:01:52 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04395<br>Received: (qmail 6226 invoked from network); 17 May 1997 01:01:48 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 17 May 1997 01:01:48 -0000<br>Message-Id: <970516205942_54573426@emout11.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
