That's of some interest to this forum, because<br>> members of this forum are directly affected.<br><br>And that was just the beginning.<br><br>I was a member of the Harry Partch Ensemble from 1971 to 1987, and worked with<br>Harry for the last few years of his life.  I have played and performed on nearly<br>all of the Partch instrument, and have performed the majority of the Partch<br>repertoire.  It was, and remains, a distinct privilege and joy; it is also a<br>responsiblity I feel towards Harry.  You could say, as Mr. McLaren did, that I am<br>directly affected.<br><br>I will be posting to this mailing list some responses and opinions regarding the<br>present and future possibilities for the exposure and performance of the music and<br>works of Harry Partch.  I state here at the outset: my expertise is in his<br>instruments, his works and his temperament - I am *not* an expert in the rather<br>daunting field of intonations (all of them, in all the flavors I have seen<br>represented here).  I wanted that out up front.  I do, however, have considerable<br>interest in the discussions of the other issues, and I believe I have the<br>'background' to offer another (hopefully) informed view of the proceedings.  I will <br>strive, as I have seen a number of others do (quite admirably) to maintain a high <br>degree of civility and clearly state opinions as such, and not confuse them with <br>facts.  I won't mince words.  I won't make personal attacks.  I will strive for a <br>clear signal at all times.<br><br>I have been encouraged by a couple of the members privately that my thoughts would<br>be welcome in this forum, and it is in this light that I look forward to adding to<br>the corpus of knowledge herein contained.  I don't know how quick my first post<br>will be, but there *are* some issues that need to be addressed in a rather timely<br>fashion; I will endeavor to get it together pronto.  In advance of that, and at any<br>time, I welcome correspondence from any of you, if I may be of help.<br><br>And just so that I have it straight, this is all about music, isn't it?<br><br>Yours in harmony,<br>Jon<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 17 Jul 1996 14:10 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id FAA00357; Wed, 17 Jul 1996 05:10:22 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 17 Jul 1996 05:10:22 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9607170846.A24404-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
