Very natural, too. Makes me<br>think of the discussions on this forum concerning who's a great com-<br>poser, and who is just an establishment darling...how rare it is to<br>hear folks on eartha ever mention Miles Davis, Coltrane, Ellington,<br>Mingus, Monk, Parker, Gillespie and many others as great composers;<br>yet, they were among the most important musicians of our, or any other,<br>time...interesting. Also, while we were rehearsing, my daughter put<br>party hats from her recent 7th bday on our heads...as we tackled<br>Auntie Wendy's tune "Beauty in the Beast, I couldn't help but think<br>that this was a great comment on our approach to the whole tuning<br>thing...Hstick<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 20 Jul 1996 15:26 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id GAA20669; Sat, 20 Jul 1996 06:26:08 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 20 Jul 1996 06:26:08 -0700<br>Message-Id: <009A59D825794BE4.1504@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3299 href="#3299">ðŸ”—</a>pbrewis@cix.compulink.co.uk (Peter Brewis)</h3><span>7/23/1996 1:46:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>In-Reply-To: <009A59D825794BE4.1504@ezh.nl><br>Manuel Op de Coul wrote:<br><br>> There's the famous anecdote that someone from the East was at a<br>> concert of Western classical music, and when he was asked how he liked<br>> it he said he especially liked the first part.

I can't think what's wrong. Is the _name_ of the directory <br>significant? Do I need a PATH statement in my AUTOEXEC.BAT?

I even downloaded the <br>whole zip file again.<br><br>> Another possibility, but I think an unlikely one, that you have <br>> insufficient memory.<br><br>I'm confident it's not that. I'm not running Windows, or anything much, <br>at the same time as Scala.<br><br>> You can also check if the other datafiles were seen by doing<br>> MODE/ALL, this should give all the mode names, CALC 8/7, this should<br>> say "septimal whole tone" at the last line, and SHOW SYNTH should <br>> present the names in synth.par.<br><br>All these work perfectly. In fact I think _everything_  is working except <br>for Help. And my printer. If my printer was working I could print out the <br>help file :-(<br><br>> The new version 1.1 is coming very soon now.<br><br>Maybe I should wait for that!
