From a practical standpoint, whatever I<br>> should produce as proof, in terms of instruments, experiments, data etc.<br>> I have too strong a vested interest in "proving" that Harrison was<br>> correct. Hence whatever further experiments, I should set up, few would<br>> believe me.<br><br>You say people wouldn't believe you (you assume) because you <br>have a vested interest in having your model be accepted, so <br>you are excused from posting your model. It's interesting <br>that this logic doesn't also prevent you from posting claims <br>that you have a model. <br><br>> We come down to the problem of all "scientific" hypothesis logic,<br>> that a<br>> "Law" is only valid, until someone comes up with a better "Law".<br><br>Actually it is theories, not laws, which compete.<br><br>> In this case the prevailing "Law" is a mapping of harmonics based on<br>> exact integer frequency ratios, <br><br>I keep seeing posts and cross posts which explain that the partials <br>of real plucked or hammered strings are not exactly harmonic. I don't <br>see anyone arguing what you call "prevailing law". I think this is<br>what's called a "strawman"--when you state an opposing argument <br>noone actually holds, hoping that by then destroying that<br>argument you can indirectly prove your own argument. Unfortunately<br>it doesn't prove anything.<br><br>> and the proposed hypothesis is a mapping<br>> based on pi, as very clearly described by Harrison and at our<br>> websites.<br><br>None of the web sites which links you've posted have any<br>description of the mapping of partials. All your web sites <br>describe (and not very clearly) is that one can build an <br>extensible tuning system on 2 irrational intervals, neither <br>of which is pi. I suspect that there are an indefinite number <br>of such tuning systems using pairs of irrational intervals, <br>all of which would produce beating sonorities.<br><br>> As I have yet to afford a full equipped acoustic lab, (neither in UK<br>> or here in Hawaii), the comparisons are difficult to make except on <br>> an experiential level.<br><br>If you want to speak musically, and say you like the sound<br>of your scale, I have no objection at all, and I encourage<br>you. I too like the sound of the beating in the lullaby examples.<br><br>It's one thing to work with materials artistically to get a <br>pleasing result, it's another to investigate the physics<br>of acoustic bodies, the theoretical structures of tuning <br>systems, and the psychoacoustics of human perception. <br><br>I have no vested interest in any particular model; I'm <br>curious about all of them--that's why I read this list. <br>If you do indeed have a model, I suggest that this <br>particular forum is the _ideal_ place to discuss it--if <br>you would only begin to do so. <br><br>Matt Nathan<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 17 Feb 1997 05:27 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08222; Mon, 17 Feb 1997 05:27:32 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08214<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id UAA26714; Sun, 16 Feb 1997 20:25:51 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 16 Feb 1997 20:25:51 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199702170348.TAA26462@sunatg1><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
