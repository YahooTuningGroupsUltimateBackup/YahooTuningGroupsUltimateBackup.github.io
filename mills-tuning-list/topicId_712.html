Here's the implicit derivation of your strict mathematical <br>definition: the syntonic comma is (3:2)^4/(5:4) (ignoring octaves); <br>therefore the best syntonic comma is 4 times the best perfect fifth minus <br>the best major third, mod the number of notes per octave. Another, just as <br>musically relevant and just as mathematically strict, definition would be: <br>the syntonic comma is (3:2)^3/(5:3) (again ignoring octaves); therefore the <br>best syntonic comma is 3 times the best perfect fifth minus the best major <br>sixth, mod the number of notes per octave. If the two definitions lead to a <br>conflict, I see no reason one should take precedence. Therefore, in such <br>cases, there is no "best" syntonic comma.<br><br>>The method . . . . also allows for an improvement in Blackwood's notations <br>in a few cases.<br><br>I'd be interested in hearing more about this.<br><br>>There is no more inherent reason to expect the m3 and M3 to "behave<br>>properly" than there is for cycles of P5 or for the M3 and P5 together.<br><br>To behave properly is to behave as in just intonation. In just intonation, <br>cycles of P5 don't close or form just M3s, so there is no inherent reason to <br>expect equal temperaments to behave this way. In just intonation, a M3 plus <br>a m3 is a P5, so this is a reasonable expectation of any equal temperament <br>in which we hope to use 5-limit harmony. If this expectation is not <br>fulfilled, don't use 5-limit symbols to notate that equal temperament. Or if <br>you do, at least don't call them "best."<br><br>>Some tunings, like 25 and marginally like 17, may have two minor thirds.<br>>Tunings with large numbers of units in the octave may have several of<br>>everything. I don't find this a fault of notation in general or of my<br>>proposal.<br><br>Neither do I. In fact, I think your method achieves the goals of being both <br>"general" and "standard." Using new symbols for various alterations is fine, <br>but naming them after various commas is useful only when the relevant <br>structural characteristics of the tuning mirror those of just intonation. <br>Otherwise it is just misleading. You didn't address my point about <br>fractional alterations, which seem just as necessary, and often at least as <br>meaningful, as the "commas," and my request to clarify your criticism of <br>Herf's and Sims' notations. What wrong with using lots of fractional <br>alterations, whose ordering is intuitive, combined with an understanding of <br>how they represent the syntonic comma, septimal comma, etc., as opposed to <br>using combinations of 12-based commas, with possibly bizarre orderings, <br>combined with an understanding of how these commas may fail to fulfill their <br>acoustical functions?<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 9 Aug 1996 08:23 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06757; Fri, 9 Aug 1996 08:23:59 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06642<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id NAA10222; Thu, 8 Aug 1996 13:15:17 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 8 Aug 1996 13:15:17 -0700<br>Message-Id: <34960808153743/0005695065PK5EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
