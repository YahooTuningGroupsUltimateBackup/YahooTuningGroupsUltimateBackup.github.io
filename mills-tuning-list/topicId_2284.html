In my opinion, McClain is one of the most<br>stimulating and original thinkers in his field. (He may also be the =only=<br>thinker in his field.)<br><br>=The Pythagorean Plato= is probably much easier to understand if read after<br>his first book, =The Myth of Invariance=, in which he sets forth many of<br>the principles and theories that are later elaborated and applied to Plato.<br>Much of his work rests on certain axioms or assumptions about the nature of<br>early scientific thought, both conceptual and practical, that must be<br>grokked before the whole edifice can stand on its own. Some folks reject<br>the assumptions; I find them intriguing and full of rich consequences.<br><br>An important influence, almost a prolegemena to McClain's work, is<br>=Hamlet's Mill: an Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and<br>its Transmission through Myth= by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von<br>Dechend (1969; Godine pb 1977; other reprints available).<br><br>McClain's articles on Chinese and Sumerian/Babylonian scale theory (not yet<br>published in book form) expand significantly on his ideas, and if anything<br>make them more convincing and clear. If there is interest, I would be<br>willing to compile a bibliography of his work, though if someone out there<br>already has one, please post it to the list.<br><br>McClain is retired and elderly (78), sharp as a whip and a complete<br>gentleman of the old school. Open to discussion and debate, he welcomes<br>serious correspondence; I do not believe he has access to e-mail. His<br>address is:<br><br>Dr. Ernest G. McClain<br>Box 192<br>Belmont, VT  05730</div>
