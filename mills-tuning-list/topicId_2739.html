I'm not much of a<br>theorist in practice, so I won't make my argument along<br>cyclic-group-theor-set-ical or meta-chromato-substi-modulational<br>grounds, but rather a more simplistic artsy-feely-philosophical<br>approach.<br><br>IMHO, something can only be described as "useless" when there is an<br>express or implied "use" to which one wishes to put it, and it isn't<br>suitable for the intended purpose.  That doesn't mean there aren't<br>*other* purposes for which it may be perfect! Harry Partch made<br>musical instruments out of so much material that was discarded as<br>"useless".<br><br>If doing the traditional heptatonic-diatonic, tried-and-true type of<br>harmonic progressions in 22 "hurts", don't do that.  I, for one, no<br>longer accept that paradigm as the be-all and end-all, and I'm<br>sometimes suprised that for all the effort expended on this list to<br>break one mold, an equal amount of effort seems to be expended<br>clinging to another.  Along those lines I've had the power [if you<br>will] of 22tet, and the constructs that seem, or should I say *sound*<br>natural to it, [at least to my ears] demonstrate themselves only too<br>well to me.<br><br>The first instance was shortly after I had initially tuned up 22 on my<br>synth and discovered a very pleasing 10 tone melodic scale [which led<br>to my contacting Paul Erlich and learning of his theories], and much<br>more recently when analyzing a chord progress I had found while<br>noodling around on my 22 tone guitar proved it to fit (again) Pauls<br>theories -- I had "rediscovered" Pauls decatonic minor modes, just by<br>following my ear.  To me, any tuning which can effect me to such a<br>degree that "following my ear" leads to something like that is far<br>from useless.<br><br>I had made the trek up a number of the small ETs, from 17 to 19 to 22,<br>and I have to admit that I plain didn't like 17 (but I've heard<br>effective music made in it!), and while 19 didn't offer me anything<br>that resonated with my minds ear, I've heard some *very* effective<br>music made in 19.  That doesn't make them "useless", only "not what I<br>was looking for".<br><br>22, as it happens *does* offer what I've been looking for, and I'm<br>forever grateful for the likes of Ivor Darreg, Brian McLaren, and<br>eveyone on this list for providing alternative viewpoints, and the<br>encouragement to explore -- I'd have probably given up long ago had I<br>listened to the sources I had in my pre-list days, sources that<br>described oh so many tunings as "useless" because they didn't fit the<br>"7 tone I-IV-V" mold.<br><br>If I've learned one thing from this list, it's that there is no single<br>"best" tuning, but rather as many "best" tunings as there are emotions<br>and pieces of music to express them.  To me, the only "useless" tuning<br>is one which has not been put to use.  If nothing else, 22 is keeping<br>me interested in music, and that's pretty good use for *any* tuning,<br>IMO.<br><br>Tune on,<br><br>Steve<br><br>PS. I know that email sometimes lacks critical cues, so I want to<br>state outright that I intend nothing personal in the above, it's just<br>my opinion on the subject.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves) <br>Subject:  Re: More on the 19-tone Equal Temperament<br>PostedDate:  09-12-97 18:29:44<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  09-12-97 18:27:52-09-12-97 18:27:53,09-12-97 18:27:39-09-12-97 18:27:39<br>DeliveredDate:  09-12-97 18:27:39<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256568.005FECCF; Tue, 9 Dec 1997 18:27:45 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10662; Tue, 9 Dec 1997 18:29:44 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 9 Dec 1997 18:29:44 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10660<br>Received: (qmail 4881 invoked from network); 9 Dec 1997 09:29:40 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 9 Dec 1997 09:29:40 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01510100b0b2befa68b8@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
