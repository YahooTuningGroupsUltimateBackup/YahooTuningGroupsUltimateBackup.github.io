If you can <br>read German, there may be a lot more; check out the most recent bibliography <br>at the Tuning ftp site (ftp://ella.mills.edu/pub/ccm/tuning/papers) for all <br>of these. Hey, is Tartini in that bibliography? His is perhaps the earliest <br>attempt at incorporating 7-limit harmony into music.<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 23 Jul 1996 21:30 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA12176; Tue, 23 Jul 1996 12:30:03 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 23 Jul 1996 12:30:03 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960723122316.10757A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
