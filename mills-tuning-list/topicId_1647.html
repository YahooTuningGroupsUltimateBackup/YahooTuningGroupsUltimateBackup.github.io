I disagree, and I agree. In nature, there are no physical <br>objects that vibrate with a pure harmonic series of partials above the <br>fundamental. The harmonic series is a construct of our mathematical <br>minds, modeling a phenomenon first observed with our nonlinear hearing <br>mechanism, and later with lab instruments. The harmonic series is an <br>idea, just as is the beatlessness of simultaneously sounding simple <br>tones.<br>	Making a scale from a pitch set of harmonic partials divided down <br>into the octave is no more natural than making a scale from a pitch set <br>whose elements are related by small number ratios. They are both <br>constructs of the mind, and in my view perfectly natural things (we are <br>not in the world, we are the world). 	<br>	We may have, hardwired into the structure of our brains, an innate <br>musical understanding of the harmonic series, but we may be hardwired <br>for understanding small number ratios as well. For that matter, we may <br>be hardwired for mathematical understanding of all that we can understand <br>mathematically, and that may spill over into musical understanding, even <br>of tempered and non-octave scales. <br>	In short, I don't think we are in any position to say what is <br>natural to our musical understanding and what is not. Further <br>psychoacoustic research may shed some light on what musical <br>structures are more primal, but I haven't seen anything convincing <br>yet. I'll bet Brian Mclaren has an opinion on this.<br><br>John Starrett<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 10 Feb 1997 12:43 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00941; Mon, 10 Feb 1997 12:43:36 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00939<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id DAA13714; Mon, 10 Feb 1997 03:41:34 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 10 Feb 1997 03:41:34 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.970210113850.7948A-100000@kali><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4762 href="#4762">ðŸ”—</a>bil@ccrma.Stanford.EDU (Bill Schottstaedt)</h3><span>2/10/1997 5:49:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>M.L.West's Ancient Greek Music (Oxford Univ Press, if I remember right).<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 10 Feb 1997 20:03 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01474; Mon, 10 Feb 1997 20:03:46 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01472<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id LAA04016; Mon, 10 Feb 1997 11:00:50 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 10 Feb 1997 11:00:50 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199702101854.KAA03469@ella.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
