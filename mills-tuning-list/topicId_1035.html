The Haverstick boys did a diverse set of 19 qnd 34 tone<br>music, covering jazz, reggae, country satire, and out there rock/<br>fusion. A small (about 40) but hearty bunch of folks saw some killer<br>music, I'd say...the press certainly didn't cover it as well as last<br>year, but the Rocky Mt. News writer (Marc Shulgold, God bless him)<br>wrote a good piece on the Catlers. I'm already looking to next year...<br><br>John Chalmers mentioned the gig in El Paso...I will be playing 34<br>tone acoustic, and solo 19 tone space music...call Sonya Wayne<br>at 915-591-3105 for more info...<br> <br>and boy, this list is sort of dull lately...too much polite math<br>talk...we need a good controversy to get things rolling...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 23 Oct 1996 16:41 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10305; Wed, 23 Oct 1996 16:43:02 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10345<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id HAA00661; Wed, 23 Oct 1996 07:42:59 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 23 Oct 1996 07:42:59 -0700<br>Message-Id: <961023104014_1314203587@emout16.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3819 href="#3819">ðŸ”—</a>Johnny Reinhard &#x3C;reinhard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/1996 3:42:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>If one is writing music down prescriptively (e.g. for another musician to <br>play from), it is important that the player fully understand the tuning.<br><br>At some point reference must be made to cents (@ 1200 cents per octave).  <br><br>Using straight forward quartersharp and quarterflat in addition to <br>traditional notation, and by indicating finer pitch differentiation by <br>numbers above noteheads.

Vocalists can navigate these basic deviations from a 12-tone <br>ET grid with assurance because there is always represented the "exact" <br>note in theory.  <br><br>When working with microtonal scales in diversity, a notation that applies <br>to all notations makes great sense for its value.  1200 cents is surely <br>a fair threshold to the numbers necessary.
