In particular, the major third is such a <br>dreadful<br>>dissonance that it must be resolved outward to fourths.  That then makes it <br>a<br>>good candidate for quartal and quintal harmony (Ivor didn't say that<br>>specifically though).  So it's not necessarily a case of putting any kind <br>of<br>>harmony behind a 17TET melody sounding "YUCK!", but triadic harmony in<br>>particular.<br><br>Very true! Or you could resolve the major third outward to a fifth, as was <br>done by Medieval polyphonists working in Pythagorean tuning.<br><br>>> I just happened to note that theorists who derive the diatonic scale from <br><br>>> three triads are perpetrating a historico-geographic fallacy.<br><br>>Is that the topic of your up-coming Xenharmonikon paper?  It sounds<br>>interesting, since that's one of two ways that come to mind immediately as <br>the<br>>basis for the construction of the traditional major scale.  The other of<br>>course<br>>is tetrachord.  Since there are big dissimilarities between the scales<br>>constructed by those means, and since the scale itself came about before<br>>triadic<br>>harmony, I can imagine that there is fertile ground for a paper there.<br><br>I just added this to my paper as an aside, but it is a good reflection of <br>the philosophy of the paper in general. Of course the major mode was not one <br>of the favorite modes of the diatonic scale until triadic harmony had been <br>in use for some time -- the tritone resolves to the tonic triad only in the <br>major and minor modes. My paper is an attempt to find a set of pitches <br>which, like the diatonic scale, stands up on a melodic basis alone, but <br>leads as naturally to 7-limit harmony and 7-limit tonality, as the diatonic <br>scale leads to 5-limit harmony and tonality, and (if you believe Yasser was <br>on the right track) as the pentatonic scale leads to 3-limit harmony and <br>tonality. The attempt succeeds even though I look no farther than the first <br>34 equal temperaments (the solution is found in 22-equal).<br><br>This brings me to recount the events of this weekend. Johnny Reinhard, <br>Richard Kassell, Adam Silverman, and I met in Manhattan on Saturday for a <br>Chinese-Latin lunch. Much enlightening discussion ensued. I spent much of <br>the rest of the day with Johnny. His wife is a world-class microtonalist in <br>her own right; we brought in her defective Kurzweil K2000 only to find out <br>that the model is no longer in production -- it has been superseded by, if I <br>recall correctly, the VX-24, which has additional expansion ports or <br>something. Anyway, Johnny practically drowned me in bliss with his <br>collection of music and written materials. Our dinner discussion over sushi <br>found him confirming my view that the melodic properties of the diatonic <br>scale are best reflected by Pythagorean intonation, its harmonic properties <br>by just intonation, and the integration of the two by temperament (this <br>could mean meantone temperament, not necessarily 12-equal). He associates <br>these aspects with the left-brain, right-brain, and whole-brain functions, <br>respectively. (I may have reversed the first two.)<br><br>Gary: I believe you are right in pointing to the tetrachord as the basis of <br>the diatonic scale. The reason this favors Pythagorean tuning is that only <br>in this tuning does each and every octave species contain two identical <br>tetrachords. (The chromatic and enharmonic tetrachords, of course, fail to <br>produce a scale with this property). The pentatonic scale and my new scale <br>have this property as well. It is worth pointing out, however, that many <br>theorists have instead found the basis in a property one might call "maximal <br>evenness," or spacing two unequally-sized steps as uniformly as possible <br>around the octave. Although this can lead to the diatonic and pentatonic <br>scales if 12-tet is presumed (another historical fallacy), it leads to a <br>scale in 22-tet that is slightly different from the one that is constructed <br>according to "tetrachords." Both scales are so interesting harmonically that <br>I have allowed for either derivation in my paper. I do think the <br>"tetrachordal" one is superior melodically, though.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 19 Nov 1996 01:16 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13899; Tue, 19 Nov 1996 01:18:10 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13916<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id QAA08735; Mon, 18 Nov 1996 16:18:08 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 18 Nov 1996 16:18:08 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199611190015.TAA23161@freenet5.carleton.ca><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
