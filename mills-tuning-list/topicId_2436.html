I'm not any<br>kind of musician. But I really loved the book, because it built a bridge<br>between my own thinking and more conventional musical ideas.<br><br>Before I read Blackwood I had tried taking a couple of Bach harmonized<br>chorales and figuring out how they should be played in j.t., I think 5-limit<br>is the right term. Basically the problem is just to figure out which of a set<br>of nearby pitches to use for each note, the pitches differing by the 80/81<br>comma. Being a musical ignoramus I'm sure I made tons of errors. But the<br>exercise really opened up for me the structure of the Bach pieces, or<br>seemed to anyway. I found, though, that the pieces seemed to turn on a kind<br>of musical pun, to take advantage of the blurring of harmonic distinctions<br>provided by temperament.<br><br>As I read Blackwood, the point is not so much that e.t. or any temperament is<br>so much better than j.t. in any universal or absolute sense, but that<br>mainstream European musical practise at least in the 18th & 19th Centuries<br>was really structured around temperament, and you can't just slide j.t. into<br>the classics and make them better. A different kind of music based on<br>j.t. might be better in some sense, but the structure of composition is<br>strongly connected to tuning, so you can't change one without some adjustment<br>in the other.<br><br>Jim<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  clumma@nni.com<br>Subject:  Barbershop and Equal-Step Tuning<br>PostedDate:  25-09-97 21:31:24<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  25-09-97 21:31:11-25-09-97 21:31:12,25-09-97 21:30:15-25-09-97 21:30:16<br>DeliveredDate:  25-09-97 21:30:16<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C125651D.006B350D; Thu, 25 Sep 1997 21:30:59 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA31095; Thu, 25 Sep 1997 21:31:24 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 25 Sep 1997 21:31:24 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA31090<br>Received: (qmail 23892 invoked from network); 25 Sep 1997 12:31:21 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 25 Sep 1997 12:31:21 -0700<br>Message-Id: <19970925193227218.AAB352@NIETZSCHE><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6158 href="#6158">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/1997 12:52:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Thu, 25 Sep 1997, Carl Lumma wrote:<br>> >Peter, if you are interested I could dredge up some of the messages from<br>> >the last time we discussed this.
