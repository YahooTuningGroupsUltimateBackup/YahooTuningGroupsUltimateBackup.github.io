In my case, I seem to<br>react to a piece or performance in one (or both, preferably) of two ways:<br>either it strikes me in a very visceral, possibly physical, context, or it<br>finds a way to please my mind, be it the construct of the music, effects,<br>masterful compositional technique.  That music of many styles (and yes,<br>many intonations) can have this effect is not surprising to most of us.  <br><br>My reflective side appreciates the subtle text settings and sinewy use of<br>the scale in Partch's "The Street" or "The Rose" (Eleven Intrusions), and<br>also finds (still) delight and emotional fulfillment in Elgar's "Enigma<br>Variations".  My more earthbound side continues to bounce to the big fun of<br>"Exordium" from Partch's "Delusion of the Fury", and has a great time<br>listening to the raw insistence of a former drum student, who now happens<br>to be in a little band called Soundgarden (last week: live in SD, standing<br>on stage 15 feet away from him - now *that's* corporeality!).  When the two<br>sides collide and become one experience, it pretty much transcends<br>explanation.<br><br>This little digression was a prelude to my thoughts on attending a concert<br>of the Southern California Microtonal Group last week here in San Diego,<br>with the performers being Jonathan Glasier, Brian McLaren, Jeff Stayton and<br>Bill Wesley.  I have known Jon for quite a while, though we don't cross<br>paths often; he and I played together in the Partch Ensemble back in the<br>'70's.  Outside of offering support to a community I am at least partially<br>involved, I was curious to see just what kind of music would bring Brian<br>into the public eye.  So many words had I read, so many opinions pondered,<br>I just had to see/hear for myself what was what.  I felt fortunate to sit<br>with Dr. John (Chalmers), as his regal demeanor would help balance my usual<br>adolescent enthusiasm.  I sincerely hoped to be delighted, and to have one<br>side or the other stimulated; I never expect to get both at once.  I didn't<br>expect to get neither.<br><br>Not so much a concert as a non-lectured exhibition, the group, in varying<br>combinations (only once more than a duo) proceeded to perform 14<br>improvisations (omitting two from the program).  They ranged from pieces<br>described as 'free intonation' (being largely done on non-tuned 'sound<br>sculptures') to pieces in JI (23, 43), 17TET, 23TET, 19TET, and variants on<br>the harmonic series.  Various keyboards and original instruments, in<br>addition to altered guitars and found objects, were used.  The individual<br>'pieces' varied from about 5 minutes to, I don't know, 15-20 minutes; it<br>became hard to tell.  The overall effect ranged from the mildly curious and<br>pleasant to mind-numbingly boring.<br><br>This isn't easy to say, and of course it's just one human's opinion.  That<br>by the end of intermission more than half of the less-than-capacity crowd<br>(about 40 people at it's peak) had left does speak to the lack of something<br>to grab on to.  I got worried when Dr. John got up, but he was just getting<br>a better view of Bill's Nail Violin (a neat instrument!).  In general, if<br>these pieces were in the category of 'directed improvisation' (a basic<br>scheme or plot to follow, with some freedom, I imagine) then it was not<br>apparent, save for a few reiterated motives or melodicles.  Almost entirely<br>absent from the works was any sense of harmony: most all players played in<br>single line melodic fashion, or block 'chord' (an admittedly awkward term<br>to use with some of the more unique instruments) style, with all voices<br>moving in parallel.  I had truly hoped to hear some of the intricate and<br>subtle harmonic wonderments of the many intonations paraded before us.  It<br>ended up not unlike wandering though a forest of Gary Kvistad's just-tuned<br>Woodstock Chimes.<br><br>One of the key tenets of improvisation (save for chaotic or chance<br>improvisation) would seem to be that the players actually *listen* to each<br>other, and possibly *react* to each other.  Outside of Jon Glasier's<br>soulful guitar and vocal work, most of the playing could very well have<br>been these same people at home, alone in their rooms.  Frequently, one<br>would look over to another to (my guess) see if he was finished yet, or if<br>it would go on for a while longer.  Close to zero communication.  At one<br>point Brian did a solo piece, which involved coaxing sounds from a machined<br>piece of aluminum alloy suspended from a cord, accompanied by a DAT of a<br>CSound sound file.  No flow, no interaction, no marvelous concordances (or<br>discords) - just someone meditatively whonking and stroking a big hunk of<br>metal, accompanied by a gradually evolving sound-field.  A thought: John<br>Cage might have been proud.<br><br>Brian told me later that he had better performances of these pieces on<br>tape, from earlier sessions; it is hard to imagine that it would make much<br>difference.  There was very little contrast from piece to piece, in spite<br>of changes in scales and instrumentation (again, Glasier's influence seemed<br>to have the most effect, and Wesley did have his moments on his instruments<br>- though they went on far too long).  There was nothing, certainly to a<br>listener *new* to alternate tunings, that would point the ear in a<br>direction of "Yes, *that* sounds attractive (or powerful, or...).  No, they<br>just were more piles of smaller and larger intervals, wafting about in a<br>non-existent breeze.  Had there been either fully realized melodies that<br>could have only bloomed in a particular scale, or (more that I hoped for) a<br>rendering of some of the harmonic avenues completely unavailable in 12TET,<br>the evening would have been memorable and positive.  I left disheartened,<br>at least in that respect.<br><br>And as for building an audience (or even appealing to the few that care<br>about these matters), it won't ever happen by sheer ratios alone: there was<br>virtually no dynamic range expressed (even though I know the instruments<br>were capable of it), no *real physical* playing (much of the action carried<br>all the excitement of a data entry clerk typing away), pretty much none of<br>*all the other things* that go into making a musical experience musical<br>(what a value judgement...); and yet, you didn't get the idea that it was<br>about a meditative, constant place.  It could have been an off night, there<br>might have been details we don't know about; so many things.  None of this<br>review is said in spite, and I think the performers were sincere in their<br>efforts.<br><br>I am an eternal optimist (just _one_ reason I stayed to the end), and I<br>won't say that Brian McLaren (or the others) can't or hasn't come up with<br>some music that might change the course of temperament and/or Western<br>music.  I know that a few people on the list seemed curious as to just what<br>his involvement in music was like.  Coming from a person like Brian, who is<br>so free with his opinions on other's performances and compositional ideals,<br>and so ardent in his beliefs as to how things should be, it was a fair bit<br>of a surprise to find so little substance.  It was stunning to hear him say<br>(maybe in jest?), referring to the harmonic-series pieces, that "there<br>weren't any wrong notes".  That thought, coupled with his use of an<br>arpeggiator to mechanically noodle through an homage to Augusto Novarro's<br>23-tone just scale, did me in.  I had looked forward to the concert,<br>half-expecting to be blown away; after all, the proof is in the pudding.<br>Oh well...<br><br>Then, to add insult to malaise, I have to spend this week accompanying<br>Robert Goulet in "Man of La Mancha" (mortgage payments, you know...); the<br>cast is apparently using some variant of 57TET.  I can't trust my ears -<br>maybe Chalmers will help me out on this one.
