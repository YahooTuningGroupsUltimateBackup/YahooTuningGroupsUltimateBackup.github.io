(A good<br>introduction to contemporary Turkish music - albeit more cultural than<br>theoretical - is Martin Stokes' _The Arabesque Debate_, Oxford 1992).<br>However, the exact value of a _koma_ varies from theorist to theorist, and<br>it is more than likely that we are dealing with something akin to<br>Aristonexian units, or a more precise sruti-like unit. The centuries long<br>debate within the Byzantine theoretical tradition has largely been over<br>what is the most appropriate equal division to describe a practice that has<br>not been - until the advent of the latest technical resources - equally<br>divided. <br><br>I realize that that a large faction of the tuning community maintains that<br>the Aristoxenian units are/were units of an equal temperament. I am more<br>comfortable - and find Aristoxenus, as well as Sruti theorists, or writers<br>on Byzantine, Turkish, or Arabic musics easier and more useful to read -<br>when these units are viewed conceptually, as smallest bits of meaningful<br>pitch differences, with exact rational values left undetermined. It is<br>striking to me that, almost universally, musicians in these traditions who<br>are also familiar with methods for the accurate measurement of pitches and<br>intervals refrain from making such measurements, or find them of little<br>value in analysing their music making. (I have come to think of Aristoxenus<br>as the first cognitive scientist).<br><br>Since we spend a lot of time discussing exactitudes of pitch and interval,<br>it may be useful to discuss what we can learn about musical tunings without<br>reference to exact magnitudes. Certainly intonational tolerance is one<br>aspect of this discussion, but I am also interested in what may be called a<br>'topological' analysis of pitch materials, of properties that are unaltered<br>by elastic deformations.<br><br>Best wishes for the holidays -<br><br>Daniel Wolf<br>Frankfurt   <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 25 Dec 1996 00:39 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02681; Wed, 25 Dec 1996 00:41:50 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02680<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id PAA05238; Tue, 24 Dec 1996 15:41:42 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 24 Dec 1996 15:41:42 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01510100aee613ff964c@[206.244.42.126]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
