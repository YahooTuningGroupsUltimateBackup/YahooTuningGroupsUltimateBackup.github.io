In fact, the 0 372 720 cent triad sounded initially almost <br>like jump to a minor triad if it came immediately after the 0 400 <br>720 one. <br><br>The 5/4 third sounds pretty poor with the sharp fifth, however.<br><br>The 395 cent third I derived sounds about quite a bit like the 400 <br>cent one, but a 408 cent Pythagorean third (with 720 cents) is <br>noticeably harsher.<br><br>The 0 348 720 cent minor triad sounds rather neutral to me.<br><br>Of all the triads I tried, I liked the 395 and 400 cent thirds<br>the best with the 720 cent fifth. Needless to say the 1/1 5/4 3/2 <br>was the most consonant.<br><br>As for your more complex psychoacoustic model, what meantone-like<br>tuning(s) does it generate? The resulting equations, with and without<br>the Major Sixth/minor third term, are messier than I have time to<br>deal with tonight even with an equation solving program.<br><br>As for "expressive unisons," they can be very poignant. I believe<br>Wyschnegradsky made considerable use of them.<br><br><br><br>To change the subject, those of us in the LA area should not forget <br>MicroFest West Saturday night at Pierce College. I'm planning on <br>coming up from San Diego to meet Erv Wilson, Marcus Hobbs, Stephen <br>James Taylor, Bill Alves etc. In addition to Neil Haverstick and Rod <br>Poole, John Schneider told me Kraig Grady will perform. The LA TImes <br>reviewer wrote in last Sunday's paper that some of Lou Harrison's music <br>will be played. <br><br>Don't miss this one...<br><br>--John<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 8 Mar 1997 14:13 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA09559; Sat, 8 Mar 1997 14:13:25 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09563<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id FAA04377; Sat, 8 Mar 1997 05:11:16 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 8 Mar 1997 05:11:16 -0800<br>Message-Id: <33364620.670632332@kcbbs.gen.nz><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
