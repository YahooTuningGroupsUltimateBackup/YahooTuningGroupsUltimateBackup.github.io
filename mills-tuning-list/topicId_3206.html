Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/1998 12:57:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>}I also give Hendrix the credit for bringing the 19-identity (the "sharp<br>}9th" of the chord, i.e., the "minor 3rd" played an octave above the<br>}"major 3rd" in a "dominant 7th chord") definitely and securely into the<br>}harmonic language of rock -- an excellent example is the main riff at<br>the<br>}beginning of  "Foxey Lady" on "Are You Experienced" (vintage 1967).<br><br>As a rock guitarist who is both an avid Hendrix buff and a constant<br>investigator of tuning possibilities, I must dispute this claim. If the<br>bottom three notes of the chord (well known to guitarists as "The Jimi<br>Hendrix Chord") are tuned 1/1:5/4:7/4, and a sharp 9th is added above<br>the chord, the most consonant (and most appropriate on distorted guitar)<br>tuning for the sharp 9th is 7/3. Try it yourself if you don't believe<br>me. The 4/3 between the 7th and sharp 9th is very solid, while a 19:14<br>in the same position is too complex a ratio and just sounds out-of-tune.<br><br>The way the chord is played on guitar, the two lowest notes are played<br>with the two strongest fingers, which a good player (like Jimi) will use<br>to apply bending and/or vibrato. This will bring the chord from 12-equal<br>to something approaching just intonation.<br><br>Not all chords are best analysed as portions of the harmonic series!</div>
