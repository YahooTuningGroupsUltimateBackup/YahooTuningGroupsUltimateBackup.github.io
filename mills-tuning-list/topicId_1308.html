It's important to say that this commentary is<br>not meant to hurt or offend...hopefully, it's seen how I intend it,<br>as a call to action on the part of those who wish to see this move-<br>ment spread and become successful. My feeling is this...if you want<br>to bridge the gap between music theorist and musician, than more<br>attention needs to be given to the physical/creative demands of<br>actually putting one's ideas across in the real world...there's a<br>lot of great 12 tone musicians out there, and very few great non<br>12 players...I think this is fact, and I hate to say it. One of<br>the qualities of a great artist, I feel, is the capacity to absorb<br>constructive criticism and profit from it...I know my teachers were<br>very tough on me, and gave no quarter...I personally prefer that<br>way of learning. Well, I think it's time for us microtonal folks<br>to make a strong atatement to the world at large that we have a valid<br>thing going here that is worthy of serious attention...unfortunately,<br>I don't think we have a lot of musical firepower at this point to<br>get the job done. So, again, I suggest a simple solution: practice<br>and study, and get those choppos up to the level of the best 12 tone<br>players, so we CAN be taken seriously...theory is wonderful, but<br>MUSIC is the goal, for me, at least, and I WANT to hear my fellow<br>microdudes doing some scary stuff...alas, as I said, a lot of the<br>music in the field is only fit, I think, for demonstrating theories<br>of tunings, and will not impress folks who could give a poot about<br>anything but the final result, which, again, is music...<br>I recall seeing my teacher, George Keith, at a jazz jam one night,<br>and he did one of the greatest solos I've ever heard...in Kansas City,<br>Ed Toler used to make me shit on a regular basis...Buzz Evans about<br>blew me off the stage once at a country bar, and my friend Bobby<br>Hornbuckle here in Denver is a scary bluesman, one of the best I've<br>heard...I used to practice 8-12 hours a day to get it going, and<br>I don't think that is a bad idea for anyone, especially for those<br>who may think that they are doing something cool by doodling on a<br>non 12 scale for a few moments and thinking they are making a pro-<br>found statement...I am not impressed by this school of music, and<br>as I said, I can't even play a lot of this stuff for people because<br>it isn't happening...and believe me, my teachers were a lot more<br>blunt than this when they were trying to help me develop as a player.<br>I hope to hear non 12 music which makes my hairs stand up...come<br>on, guys...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 2 Dec 1996 11:00 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14248; Mon, 2 Dec 1996 11:02:14 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13043<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id CAA06260; Mon, 2 Dec 1996 02:02:12 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 2 Dec 1996 02:02:12 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961202100050_71670.2576_HHB27-3@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4236 href="#4236">ðŸ”—</a>Judith.Parkinson@anu.edu.au (Judith Parkinson)</h3><span>12/3/1996 3:51:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I am a woman! I'm mostly concerned with  working  with  children as a<br>Kodaly  trained music educator, and having  written a thesis on the<br>pedagogy of just intonation in choral music, work a lot in very subtle ways<br>with intonation exercises with children from 3 years old, with singing<br>games based on pure intonation of falling minor thirds (easiest to sing<br>purely at that age) and with my older children in a special music program<br>at a primary school where the children have daily music classes, building<br>triads in ways that allow them to hear the overtones and tune to each<br>other. All very practical, although I have interest in the philosophical<br>domain as well (part of my thesis was a history of ideas about tuning) I<br>don't contribute a lot these days, as I am also training as a<br>psychotherapist and researching new psychologicala domains and very<br>busy!!!!<br>One thing I am not, is a composer, and also not so interested in the<br>instrumental as the vocal domain of music making.<br>>From a woman...<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 5 Dec 1996 23:12 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00347; Thu, 5 Dec 1996 23:13:57 +0100<br>Received: from sun4nl.NL.net by ns (smtpxd); id XA00345<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by sun4nl.NL.net (5.65b/NLnet-3.4)<br>	id AA29469; Thu, 5 Dec 1996 23:13:53 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id OAA05952; Thu, 5 Dec 1996 14:12:30 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 5 Dec 1996 14:12:30 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v03007801aeccf6861124@[130.132.159.35]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
