By what are we bound in the interpretation of another <br>>microtonalist's music?<br>[...snip...]<br>>It seems to me that a sensitive arrangement of Partch for string quartet <br>>is entirely appropriate, as long as the tonality is respected.<br><br>Question is: should I respond on the list or to John personally? It was<br>nigh well one year ago, on July 12, 1996, when O Absent One (Brian McLaren)<br>first broached the subject. It got me into the fray, and really (*really*),<br>matters Partchian have been churning ever since!<br><br>It may be very old hat at this point; OTOH, there might be new members<br>since then that aren't aware of some of the, if not 'educated', then<br>'experienced' voices in this matter. I've had just brief correspondences<br>with John Starret, who is a great resource online, and we can work<br>off-list, I'm sure.<br><br>If you want to see the original go-around, they were one of the first<br>pieces of ... content on Corporeal Meadows, still ensconced at:<br><br>  http://www.adnc.com/web/jszanto/jrnl_0.html<br><br>I'll let one or two cycles of the digest go around (hmmm...cycles) before<br>coming in again. Bye!<br><br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br><br>P.S.<br>>Hell, John Schneider plays <br>>Partch on his guitar and doesn't get slapped around (as far as I know).<br><br>As an aside, I have spoken with John Schneider at length about this,<br>including disagreements. That said, there is a world of, a galaxy of, a<br>mighty universe of difference between someone recreating an instrument the<br>work was composed for to perform it as intended, and someone transcribing<br>it for not only an unintended but *unwanted* ensemble.

However, there is still a<br>> unique relationship if you consider that the lower one will cross the zero<br>>  point only at points at which the higher one is also crossing _and <br>> completing<br>>  an even number of cycles_.  It turns out that odd-number multiples cross<br>in<br>>  mid-cycle where the lower one crosses, and even ones cross at completed<br>>  cycles.<br><br>Ack!  I did it again!  Sometimes I feel like Andy Griffith: "Barn, can you<br>believe that I can fit this gre't big foot - all of it - in my mouth?!"<br><br>Actually, any number which is [a power of two greater than one] of any whole<br>number (x*2^y, where x any whole number, and y is any whole number > 1 --<br>12, for example) will fit my definition (I think).  There seems to be no<br>especially unique relationship for powers of two.  I see now that I was<br>originally visualizing waveforms with the following series of relationships:<br>1/1, 2/1, 3/2, 4/2, 5/4 ... - in other words, I was assuming octave<br>invariance in my attempt to prove octave invariance - bad reasoning all<br>through.  Sorry, everyone.  Ah, the power of a false assumption!  Having<br>discovered that, I was still clinging desparately to Marion's observation:<br><br>>On octave invariance, it has just occurred to me that, in LCM<br>>terms, the octave has a property that no other ratio shares. <br>>That is two notes that differ only by octaves can be mixed<br>>without making the length of the resulting "interference" pattern<br>>longer than the waveform of the lowest note.<br><br>But wouldn't that be true of x:1 where x any whole number, not just powers<br>of two?  So it appears to be an argument for otonal ratio invariance, of<br>which octave invariance is merely the simplest example.  Am I on the right<br>track yet?<br><br>Well, maybe psycho-physical evidence will prove to be a good arrow in our<br>quiver, Paul E.<br><br>David J.
