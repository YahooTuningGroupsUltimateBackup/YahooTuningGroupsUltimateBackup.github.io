It is certainly harder to hear an   <br>interval *as an interval* as opposed to hearing two notes when there is   <br>warbling going on.  The first time I heard vocal ensembles without it was   <br>breathtaking.  Of course, no keyboard was involved there, so they *could*   <br>sing pure intervals.<br><br><br>>     The response I have gotten from the performers leads me to think   <br>that<br>>the effects of leaving ET are strong, but not directly apparent to the<br>>audience.  This is based on the reaction I have been getting from,   <br>(among<br>>others) vocalists.  They say that once the alien nature of well   <br>temperament<br>>dissipates, [...] they find that it is much easier to hit<br>>pitches, they are no longer forced to put notes in what seem to be<br>>"artificial places",  and they find a real security with that tonal   <br>center.<br>>       With that security, phrasing and inflection take less effort.   <br>There is<br>>freedom to be creative that comes from this sort of security.<br><br>.. and to use intonation as an expressive device as well?<br><br><br>>One other telling moment came when we( my artist/conspirator and I),<br>>used the Young temperament for Beethoven's  third concerto, ( without<br>>telling anyone).  The dean of the school found me later and said that he   <br>had<br>>never heard a piano sound so good in front of the symphony like that,   <br>That it<br>>stood out like never before.  There were numerous comments about how<br>>incredibly tense the artist was able to make the middle section seem .   <br> It<br>>appears to have  had an effect, but it is a deeper effect than  words do<br>>justice.  I think the piano temperaments might be more of a subliminal   <br>thing,<br>>but I don't use that word out there in customer-land;  it scares'em,<br>>makes'em  think of UFOs and stuff.<br><br>Not subliminal, I think, but audiences don't know why things sound   <br>different.  Like your dean, they are fully aware that the middle section   <br>is more tense, they just don't notice that the thirds and fifths are   <br>different and that's why.  Maybe it's really better *not* to reveal the   <br>secret - more accolades for the performer this way!<br><br>   <br><br>>What was "intended" is, by now,  a "debated-to-death" point.<br><br>Yes indeed.  My question about the Bach and Bull (hmm... sounds like the   <br>name of a pub...) was largely rhetorical.  Both have been discussed on   <br>the harpsichord list, and the Bach was fought over on this one a year or   <br>two ago.  We tend to take a fairly rigid attitude to tuning today.   <br> Personally, I think composers back then were more flexible, treating it   <br>more as a performers option, within certain bounds, like ornamentation.   <br> After all, their descriptions were not precise: "Narrow the fifths by as   <br>much as ye ear will permit."  How helpful!<br><br><br>>      Since I can use a tuning hammer,  and have a lot of pianos around   <br>me,<br>> I am able to make some changes in people's attitudes that talking just   <br>would<br>>not do.  It amazed me how quickly people could have their sense of   <br>tonality<br>>awaken.  At least with familiar music. Thus,  the CD.<br><br>Keep up the good work!<br><br>   <br><br>>It appears that the WTC I gains improvement with the slightest WT, and<br>>gets  progressively better all the way back to Werckmiester's roughest!   <br> I<br>>know of at least one tuner that chases the genre back into meantone<br>>territory, but that starts making me think of Jimi Hendrix at times.<br><br>The Mean-Tempered Clavier!!
