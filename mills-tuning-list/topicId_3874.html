But, a small glitch...the disc containing liner <br>notes from Sethares and Loffink did not work, so we could not get them on <br>Marty's computer...guys, if you would send your liners directly to Marty <br>Lambuth at  visims@aol.com, we're ready to finish the project and get it <br>to the CD manufacturer...thanks for your patience, and again, this disc <br>is unique and satisfying...<br>    Also, Jim Ratts is finishing the master DAT over the weekend...Jim  <br>has a very interesting project available, called "Those Fabulous '60's;" <br>it's a cassette which takes you on a musical trip through the <br>music/politics of the 1960's with snippets of hundreds of songs and <br>sounds, including the voice of Richard Nixon in some very embarrasing <br>moments. It loosely reminds me of the Firesign Theater in it's skewed <br>humor. It took Jim about 200 hours of tape editing to assemble this <br>project, and it's one of my favorite tapes to listen to. It's yours for <br>the cost of a blank cassette and postage...if you're interested, contact <br>Jim at   sratts@compuserve.com  It received a great review in the Gavin <br>report recently, and is a real hoot...there it is, hope to have the CD <br>out soon...Hstick<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1490<br>*************************</div><h3><a id=8299 href="#8299">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.

I noted two places<br>where there was a striking "out-of-tune" sensation: the E over the<br>B-minor chord, and the B over the A-major chord. Note that there is one<br>other place where the "wolf" B-E occurs in the piece: the E over the<br>G-major chord. However, this didn't strike me as that dissonant, so I<br>left it out, though I was aware that it contained the wolf. This G-B-D-E<br>sonority is almost identical to the one that Margo and Dave have been<br>discussing, making me wish I had pointed it out earlier instead of just<br>implying it by omission from the list of horrible clashes in the JI<br>version of the piece. Anyway, I'm just registering my agreement that the<br>sonority is not that horrible and has a certain character that could be<br>musically useful.<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1492<br>*************************</div>
