Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/1997 1:21:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Actually, CPSs with no factor of 1 arise naturally in the construction<br>of Euler genera from CPS building blocks. For example, the Euler genus<br>3.5.7 can be constructed from the CPSs 1)4[1,3,5,7], 2)4[1,3,5,7], and<br>3)4[1,3,5,7]. The intersection of the first two is the CPS 1)3[3,5,7],<br>and the intersection of the last two is 2)3[3,5,7]. So CPSs without a<br>factor of 1 are "where you put the glue" when constructing Euler genera.<br>In the triangular lattice, the CPSs are symmetrical structures, while<br>the Euler genera are skewed parallelopipeds. In fact, according to the<br>triangular lattice philosophy, there are many other structures just as<br>simple as Euler genera. For example, if you use 1)3 [1,3,5] and 2)3<br>[1,3,5] as the connecting faces for the first three CPS mentioned above,<br>you get such a structure. (The individual CPSs will, in general, have to<br>be transposed with respect to the raw multiplication results; the fact<br>that you don't have to transpose them in the construction of the Euler<br>genus is a mere mathematical curiosity.) More interesting is what<br>happens when you use all possible connecting faces of a given CPS; at<br>least in some cases, this results in what Erv Wilson called a<br>"stellation." Or using all possible 1)n or (n-1))n CPSs connected to a<br>given point; that results in a Partch diamond if the n factors are<br>consecutive odd numbers starting with 1. . .<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 11 Jul 1997 10:22 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA26474; Fri, 11 Jul 1997 10:22:40 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 11 Jul 1997 10:22:40 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA26442<br>Received: (qmail 14868 invoked from network); 10 Jul 1997 21:22:35 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 10 Jul 1997 21:22:35 -0000<br>Message-Id: <970710171820_-2080181448@emout19.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5814 href="#5814">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/1997 5:13:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>David Finnamore wrote:<br><br>''But I think it's a different kind of dimensionality, if you will, from<br>the<br>prime type.

If you are making a pre-compositional theory, then<br>you<br>will probably want to locate and organize aspects of the materials that you<br>intend<br>to project structurally, so as to make these aspects them audible throughthe way<br>that you articulate them. If you are making a theory for interpreting (asa<br>listener<br>or a performer) an existing work, then the theory should explain how the<br>surface<br>articulations reflect physical characteristics of the materials. Both of<br>these kinds<br>of theories are based upon the assumption that the way musical materials<br>are<br>articulated is essential to their interpretation.<br><br>On the other hand, if your intention is to make a claim for the<br>psychophysical status<br>of your materials, you are initially freed from accounting for such<br>personal or cultural<br>constructions as described above, but the completion of a psychophysical<br>approach<br>depends upon eventually being able to address these concerns. In my<br>experience, existing psychophysical theories are either weak or culturally local.<br>(There are some minor innate behavior mechanisms associated with sounds - my favorite<br>example is the<br>taste of Carlsberg Beer while listening to particular sine wave frequencies<br>- but the<br>culturally aquired patterns seem to be overriding; see, for example,<br>Gilbert Rouget _Music and Trance_).<br><br>Let's look at some real examples: (1) I compose a piece consisting only of chromatically planed (parallel)<br>Major ninth<br>chords without fifths in just intonation. If the orchestration is such that<br>a listener can hear the<br>individual voices of these chords, then 9 is being articulated<br>independently of 3. Since<br>9 is here relatively prime, how could 9 be here distinguished a 'real'<br>prime?<br><br>(2) I write a chorale in triads that goes I - IV - V - I. There is a 9:8<br>relationship<br>between IV and V chords, but this is usually weakly articulated and the Vof V (3^2)<br>relationship is heard as more important. (3) I compose a sound installation consisting of standing sine waves using<br>only prime<br>multiples of a given fundamental and 9 times that fundamental. Depending<br>upon where<br>I am in the room, I will hear the 9 as either an independent entity or inconnection with 3.<br><br>(4) Using a TX81Z (with a resolution of 1.56 cent deviations from 12tet),I<br>perform<br>a melody based upon random walks over a lattice with two dimensions: 3s and<br>9s. The<br>best approximation of 9 does not coincide with the best approximation of<br>3^2. For all practical purposes, 3 and 9, in this temperament, are<br>relatively prime.<br><br>(5) A composition is played one day on a gamelan tuned to a 7 pitches outof 9TET, on<br>the next to a Lou Harrison-style just intonation pelog, on the next to a<br>Wilson<br>style linear series in just intonation, and finally on a real<br>unsystematically-tuned Javanese instrument. To what degree is the composition intonation-transparent?  Itis interesting to hear how certain structures survive radically differentmappings intact as well as to hear what features are projected differently<br>under alternative intonations.
