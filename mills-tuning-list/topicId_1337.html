I know of three main<br>possibilities:<br>1.  Suspend them unchanged into the next chord, risking the possibility that<br>    they'll be wolf tones.  I believe that's what Denny Genovese usually does.<br>2.  Shift their pitch when the competing note sounds.  That's Dave Hill's, and<br>    apparently Justonic's approach.  <br>3.  Let the tonic wander.  That's the approach I find most interesting, <br>    although I can imagine value in all of the three of them used judiciously.<br><br>   It would be neat if they'd allow all three as an algorithmic-composition-like<br>harmonization parameter.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 04:15 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA20504; Wed, 4 Dec 1996 17:41:10 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA21192<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA29639; Wed, 4 Dec 1996 08:41:08 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 4 Dec 1996 08:41:08 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.961122094607.17857D-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4275 href="#4275">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph  Downing &#x3C;jdowning@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/1996 11:20:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Thu, 5 Dec 1996, Daniel Wolf wrote:<br>> <br>> By the way: In Just Intonation, how do you avoid a wolf in a progression<br>> like the following: I V I  vi ii V I?  I think you have to choose between a<br>> wolf and a comma slip, and I generally prefer the former.<br><br>What I did in my _Downing I_ tuning is to tune the Ds above middle C to G<br>(G/D = 2/3) while the Ds below middle C are tuned a 6/5 minor third below<br>F.

I find that, at least for<br>me, harmonic tuning is much more important than melodic tuning, so this<br>does not bother me.  I find that ANYONE notices harmonic tuning, while the<br>inconsistency of the two pitches used melodically is only noticeable to<br>those (including me) who are listening more carefully.  <br><br>This is, obviously, a compromise, but one that I am willing to live with,<br>and I prefer this solution above "averaging" the two pitches.<br><br>Your mileage may vary.<br><br>Joe Downing in Syracuse<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 20:54 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02281; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 20:56:37 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02232<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA01212; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 11:56:34 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 6 Dec 1996 11:56:34 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95.961206144904.10550G-100000@gamera.syr.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
