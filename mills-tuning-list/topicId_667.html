Here's part of the quote:  "A<br>subject, when presented with a arelatively small interval of--let us say--0.12<br>of a semitone, at first may hear a very slight indefinite difference between the<br>two tones, or even no difference at all.  But when the same interval is repeated<br>a great many times with the subject deliberately focussing his attention on the<br>task of discerning a clear-cut interval, there will almost invariably be<br>reported an apparent enlargement of the objectively constant interval."  <br><br>   I can relate to this effect myself, along with a few other really strange<br>interval-size change effects from repeated listening.  Probably the strangest<br>one to me is when I practice singing 7:6 vs 6:5 sub/minor thirds.  When I<br>practice those intervals only continuously for 5 minutes or so, I often find<br>that when I quickly expand outward to sing 5:4s and 3:2s, the 5:4 sound like<br>perfect fourths, and the 3:2s seem like octaves!  Anybody else ever experienced<br>anything like that?  It's really a weird feeling.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 27 Jul 1996 06:25 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA11732; Fri, 26 Jul 1996 21:25:14 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 26 Jul 1996 21:25:14 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960727042242_71670.2576_HHB66-15@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
