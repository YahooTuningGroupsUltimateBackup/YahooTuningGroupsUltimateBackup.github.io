It has been autostarting on my Microtonal Music Page for about<br>a month, and it IS NOT KEN'S WORK, but rather my screwup that people have<br>been hearing. I apologize to Ken and any list members who had to listen<br>to it.<br><br>        On the question of fretted versus fretless basses for microtonal<br>music, for just intonation fretless is great, as you can tune to the beats<br>in real time. For equal tempered music the fretted bass is certainly<br>easier to start with, as the intervals take some getting used to. A<br>lined fretless is ideal if one has the resources to have a different<br>instrument for each tuning. At the first Microstock Microtonal Music<br>Concert I heard a cello played very well in 19tet, so with a great ear a<br>lined instrument is not necessary (although I am not giving up my lines).<br><br>John Starrett<br>http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</div>
