It is<br>>>standard in physics (and justified by calculus) to approximate any local<br>>>minimum with a parabola. Therefore, near a just ratio, the change in<br>>>dissonance is proportional to the squared detuning.<br><br>Does this mean that you're going to go over to squared detuning?  Are you<br>sure we should be squaring logorithmic measures of detuning?<br><br>Parabolas aside, my original warning regarding cent-detuning was that you<br>can bump into other low-number ratios without knowing it.  We got into this<br>19/16 thing because I said that 16 cents flat of a 6/5 we have old 300, and<br>18 cents flat we have 19/16.  By cents-detuning, the 19/16 is worse than the<br>300 cent interval.  By cents detuning squared it'd still be worse.<br><br>Even if you don't agree there's a difference between 300 and 19/16, it<br>doesn't make the 19/16 worse than the 300.  But there must be more-better<br>examples.  Maybe: the 12TET minor 7th is 18 cents flat of a 9/5, and 22<br>cents south of the 9/5 we have 16/9.<br><br>|-----------------------------------------|<br>| Carl Lumma                              |<br>| http://users.nni.com/source_of_goodness |<br>|-----------------------------------------|<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com><br>Subject:  Misc 2<br>PostedDate:  04-11-97 18:16:48<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  04-11-97 18:15:43-04-11-97 18:15:44,04-11-97 17:16:07-04-11-97 17:16:08<br>DeliveredDate:  04-11-97 17:16:08<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256545.005ED042; Tue, 4 Nov 1997 18:15:37 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02374; Tue, 4 Nov 1997 18:16:48 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 4 Nov 1997 18:16:48 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02372<br>Received: (qmail 2033 invoked from network); 4 Nov 1997 09:16:44 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 4 Nov 1997 09:16:44 -0800<br>Message-Id: <19971104171940500.AAA335@NIETZSCHE><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
