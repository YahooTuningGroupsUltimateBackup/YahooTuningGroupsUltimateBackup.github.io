I don't have an academic background<br>in matters of tunings, although I do have a B.Mus., so I will no doubt need<br>alot of correction for a while until I learn the jargon.  Everyone please<br>feel free to correct my terminology, let me know when I could have used a<br>term that would have been clearer or more concise, or simply ask me to<br>clarify my point.  I appreciate it.<br><br>By "Phrygian," I meant only that it is similar to the so-called Phrygian<br>church mode in its intervalic relationships.  The step from tonic to the<br>second note of the scale is roughly a half step, and otherwise it is close to<br>harmonic minor in 12t-ET.  Since the particular ratios I chose all happen to<br>be quite close to 12t-ET, it sounds really alot like what we think of as<br>modern music composed in Phrygian church mode under most circumstances when<br>1:1 is taken as the root of the scale.  Of course, church mode usage itself<br>differed somewhat from that, which complicates the issue.<br><br>Oddly, I didn't choose that set of ratios because they were close to 12t-ET.<br> In fact, I was a little disappointed to note it.  I had combed through<br>dozens of different methods for organizing ratios of prime numbers over<br>powers of two, and chose the ratio for each member of the scale on the basis<br>of frequency of appearance in the various lists.<br><br>Despite its closeness to 12t-ET tuning, when using it to play melodies with a<br>ringing sound like harp or vibes, where the notes of the melody can overlap<br>and resonate together, the effect is strikingly different (to me) to the same<br>thing played with 12t-ET.<br><br>Further, John Chalmers says:<br><br>>I'd come across the tetrachord of your scale before and have it in<br>>my book (Divisions of the Tetrachord). Of course, I would call<br>>it the Dorian mode, rather than Phrygian as the names got mixed<br>>up sometime around the time of Boethius or even later with Glareanus.<br>>I've also tried the version 19/18 x 9/8 x 64/57, which generates<br>>what one might call the enneadecimal major, 1/1 9/8 24/19 4/3 3/2<br>>32/19 38/19 2/1 (the retrograde of this tetrachord, 64/57 x 9/8 x<br>>19/18, generates the enneadecimal minor, 1/1 9/8 19/16 4/3 3/2<br>>64/57 57/32 2/1).<br><br>Very enlightening stuff.  He would be more qualified than I to fill us in on<br>the usage of church mode terminology in connection with JI, and evidently<br>covers that topic in his book.<br><br>David J.
