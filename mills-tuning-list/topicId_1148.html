His work centers around a <br>pressure and position sensitive membrane that reads the finger position <br>on the "fingerboard" and translates position to pitch (which of course is <br>software assignable to anything MIDI can handle). Finger pressure can <br>then be translated into any controller stream desired. Brad can be <br>contacted at bbusley@carbon.cudenver.edu. Be warned, he's quite busy and <br>a little email negligent. <br><br>	I have designed, but not implemented, a generalized keyboard as<br>follows:   <br><br>A position and pressure sensitive membrane is connected via software to <br><br>1) Display a pitch area screen on the computer, which can then be divided <br>into pitch regions either with finger pressure tracing out the regions or <br>with a mouse on the screen or other means.<br><br>2) Assign pitch (or pitches) to the regions.<br><br>3) Act as a "keyboard" in accordance with software rules definable by the <br>user.<br><br>	A keyboard of this type can of course use pressure as well as <br>position WITHIN a pitch region to modify pitches in any manner acceptable <br>to MIDI. One could, for instance, have side to side position within the<br>pitch region bend the pitch, up and down motion in the region change timbre<br>and finger pressure control the amplitude. Time, demand and money are all <br>that is keeping a generalized keyboard of this sort from the market. The <br>technology exists and the programming for something like this is not <br>exceptionally difficult.<br>	I am posting a schematic of this keyboard on my web page the 15th <br>of this month. Let me know what you think of the idea.<br>	My web page is http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret.
