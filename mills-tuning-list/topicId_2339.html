It's the initial exposure<br>that usually takes them by surprise, but the reaction here has been very<br>positive, and many people who are not even that heavily into music are<br>intrigued. I ran into a guy in the mountains the other day, and he said<br>"you're the guy with the logarithmic guitar"...I meet folks all over town<br>who have heard of what we're doing, and who are amused and curious. Keep<br>it up, Ed...and see if you can get Brent Mason interested...Hstick<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net<br>Subject:  Re: Semitones etc.<br>PostedDate:  22-08-97 11:01:44<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  22-08-97 11:01:44-22-08-97 11:01:45,22-08-97 10:59:38-22-08-97 10:59:39<br>DeliveredDate:  22-08-97 10:59:39<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564FB.003197EB; Fri, 22 Aug 1997 11:01:41 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA19098; Fri, 22 Aug 1997 11:01:44 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 22 Aug 1997 11:01:44 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA19103<br>Received: (qmail 22393 invoked from network); 22 Aug 1997 09:01:32 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 22 Aug 1997 09:01:32 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541100b02259182f01@[207.207.3.86]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
