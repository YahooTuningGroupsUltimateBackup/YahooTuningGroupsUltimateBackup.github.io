Each system (and we are assuming here<br>that Tagore is referencing Indian and Western "classical" or "courtly"<br>or "art" music--take your pick of favorite term) works with its own sets<br>of rules, and when you hear a raga, you are pretty sure it's a raga, and<br>when you hear a symphony, you know it's a symphony.  One might argue<br>that each symphony (a guy like Stamitz wrote hundreds of them) are<br>simply "frozen ragas"--each symphony was a realization based on a system<br>of rules, just like each raga is, with a different set of rules.  One<br>might also argue that in the development of the symphony from ... the<br>late Baroque to the late Romantic, there was more change--and therefore<br>more freedom--than in the last 300 years of raga practice.  Yet this<br>remains to be proven, either way.<br><br>>EINSTEIN: In Europe, music has come too far away from popular art and<br>popular feeling and has become something like a<br>secret art with conventions and traditions of its own.<br><br>Well, that probably better describes the Indian raga and courtly music<br>than Western music, at least in the past 100 years, when Western music<br>is taught all over the place (no more "secret art") and Indian<br>traditions have been jealously guarded in the guild-like "gharana"<br>system.<br><br>I need not go further with this, but I sure am curious if this is a real<br>dialogue, or a fictional creation.
