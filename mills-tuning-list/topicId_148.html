It includes Music by Ben Johnston<br>, Brian Ferneyhough, Joji Yuasa, John Fonville, and Salvatore Martirano. <br>With Virginia Gaburo, piano and Anne LaBerge, flute. $12.00.<br><br>The Johnston is Twelve Partials for Flute and Microtonal Piano. <br>The tuning is the 16th to the 30th partials of C (excluding 23, 25 and 29). <br>FerneyhoughUs piccolo work Superscritio uses a few quarter tones, <br>as does YuasaUs Bass flute work. Both are extraordinary pieces. <br>My Music for Sarah is very xenharmonic but all of the tunings are <br>derived from the fluteUs harmonics and altered fingerings. <br>One movement explores the interactions of harmonics between <br>the voice and the stopped tube which can easily go to the 13th partial.<br> In another movement the head joint is removed and the flute is <br>played much like a shakuhachi. The shorted tube has a semitone of <br>about 130 cents. My flute duets Mong Songs are very xenharmonic.<br> One movement is based on a 19 note per octave scale.<br><br>John Fonville<br>814 Oakbranch Drive<br>Encinitas, CA 92024<br>email: jwf@muttley.ucsd.edu<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 4 Nov 1995 21:26 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA24823; Sat, 4 Nov 1995 11:26:52 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 4 Nov 1995 11:26:52 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199511041925.AA16587@net4you.co.at><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
