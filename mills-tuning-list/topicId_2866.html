But to either way he's thinking right=<br> now:<br><br>Why, oh why can't tuning be a resource to the musician, like dynamics?  Ivor<br>had pioneered this idea so long ago.  I am sorry to find it hasn't been<br>taken further since.<br><br>>In reaction to this, we now suffer (a few of us) from the opposite error<br>>to having a closed mind, which is to cherish a mind so flaccidly open<br>>that one denies all universal principles, or the possibility of such<br>>principles. To make (for once) a sweeping statement, such an attitude is<br>>abhorrent to art, and would have been viewed with horror and disdain by<br>>every Great Western (or Eastern) Composer who has ever lived.<br><br>Behold, he can channel dead spirits!  While your at it, let us in on how<br>Mozart would feel about Eggo waffles.<br><br>Your understanding of art is quite infantile.  Music is organized sound.<br>This sound organized in such a way that it can communicate a message.  The<br>message is rhythm, built into whatever structure is there.<br><br>A morse code button has only two sounds: on and off.  But it can make music.<br>Add a third sound, and multiple rhythms can now exist simultaneously, on<br>different levels, in the relationships between the sounds.  A good drum<br>offers a wider selection.  In the western orchestra, rhythms are built on an<br>amazing large lattice of intervals taken from the 5-limit.<br><br>The only guiding principle needed in tuning is one that can keep the<br>intervals distinct.  Because of the nature of the sounds made by most<br>instruments, and because of the nature of the ear (which has evolved to pick<br>apart such sounds), the most powerful guiding principle is the harmonic<br>series -- Just Intonation.<br><br>There is another effect, which is considered muchly in Indian music, and<br>that is the physical effect of intervals.  How does the body react?  This is<br>a different consideration than the one I address in the above paragraph.<br>While I don't care to think about it like I do the above issue, identifying<br>liver lines and such, I can certainly feel it, and can confirm that there's<br>really "something to it".<br><br>Despite the excellent work done on consistency, etc, our understanding of<br>how the interval structures of equal temperaments compares to those of Just<br>Intonation is primitive.  If you are trying to further this understanding,<br>you have been unsucessful.<br><br>Your efforts in this matter are based the already established 5-limit school<br>of thought, and some ideas about "melody".  Melody is a complicated thing.<br>There's part that stays the same despite changes to notes in it within plus<br>or minus 50 cents.  There's a different part that stays despite changes p or<br>m 30 cents.  There's a part that notices differences within 1 cent.  Then,<br>as Bill Alves said in the beginning...<br><br>>The same is true if I change tones by 100 cents. In other words, if I put<br>>"Happy Birthday" into a minor key, people will still recognize it as "Happy<br>>Birthday," albeit with a rather different sound. The same is true for much<br>>smaller intervals. The psychological mechanisms for recognizing melodies<br>>depends on a lot more than the absolute sizes of successive intervals.<br>>Anyway, I do not choose tuning systems to make sure that a melody is<br>>perceived as different if I choose a slightly altered set of intervals.<br><br>..there's the part that's just rhythm (that's traditional rhythm, only a<br>part of the rhythm I mention above).<br><br>Even if you had something useful to say about the 60-cent-indifferent part,<br>you haven't done it.  Within this part, you'd have to be specific about how<br>many of the notes could stand a change to say something useful.  The effect<br>of changing one note by 30 cents and that of changing every-other note by 30<br>cents is quite different.  You'd no doubt have to weight by duration, not to<br>mention meter (we all know how the notes of downbeats are different from<br>others).  Both of these weightings would be very difficult to work out, it<br>would probably take several very good math and music gurus over a year to<br>work out something even reasonably good.<br><br>>Each musical artist would then have to reinvent his own musical language<br>from >scratch.=20<br><br>Not from scratch, but speed the day!  Imagine guys getting together to jam<br>and setting up a tuning first!  When knowledge of tuning can be made<br>commonplace, musicians will be real badasses.<br><br>>This is as if each poet had to invent his own language.<br><br>Maybe the day will come when poets are cool enough to do this.  Even now<br>they beat us, having several hundred languages to choose from.<br><br>>We should then perhaps have strange new poetries =97 most of them<br>pathetically >valueless and inept, a few of them perhaps (within a narrow<br>sphere) exquisitely >beautiful. But the latter class of languages and<br>poetries would be precisely >those that most closely imitate some one (or<br>several) of the 'natural' >languages and known cultures.<br><br>In the context of what I say above, they would only be valueless if the<br>message is valueless.  This is what seperates bad artists from good artists.<br>The good artist puts his message into everything he can, however much or<br>little of it a given medium can hold, and in whatever way it can hold it.<br>The bad artist has no message, and so even the most powerful medium holds<br>nothing.<br><br>>On the list, I believe someone =97 by no means devoid of understanding =97<br>>said that "Gibson's preference for mean-tone temperaments is<br>>well-established" as if there are any others worth discussing (for<br>>long). Well, there is just intonation and Pythagoreanism, but they are<br>>not temperaments. There are 22- 29- 41- & 53-tone equal, but I do hope<br>>that by now I have explained why these 'temperaments' are valueless, for<br>>they cast out the consonant thirds from their tonal fabric as soon as<br>>one tries to preserve the consonant fifths.<br><br>If 5/4 is your consonant third, as you claim, then 22TET has better thirds<br>than 19TET.  Your problem is you insist that a third be four fifths above<br>the tonic.<br><br>>Some may imagine that =97 falling into that habit of the human mind which<br>>causes us to become passionately attached to whatever we much use,<br><br>I don't imagine, I know.  That nasty habit!  This is how behavior works, you<br>dolt!  Why do you think I said "listen to Bach until you like it"?<br><br>>Finally, I wish to state again that the masses, although seemingly<br>>ignorant of and indifferent to tuning questions, are, like it or not,<br>>our masters.<br><br>Your view is disgusting.  Those who listen are the audience.  If the masses<br>listen, the masses are the audience.  There is no master in the equation.<br><br>Likes and dislikes are products of behavior.  If you play joe shmo a Cd of<br>Honeggar, the chances of him liking it are about half as good as if he saw<br>the same work performed live.  To make music to fit somebody's likes or<br>dislikes is a neat trick, one which I can do rather well.  But to change<br>somebody's likes or dislikes, that is art.  To bring somebody something they<br>hadn't thought of.  To rock their world.<br><br>Carl<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Jonathan M.
