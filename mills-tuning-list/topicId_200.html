J.R. Pierce constructed it from four <br>3:5:7 triads as I explained in my post and mapped these notes into the <br>13th root of 3/1 ET gamut. The melodic pattern is 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 <br>degrees, a mode of the MOS whose generator is 3 degrees. <br> <br>The ratios generated by Pierce's derivation are one of several possible <br>just intonations for his set of 9 tones and by extension of the entire<br>set of 13 notes. Bohlen gives the following JI interpretation of the <br>entire 13-tone scale: 1/1 27/25 25/21 9/7 7/5 75/49 5/3 9/5 49/25 15/7 <br>7/3 63/25 25/9 3/1. <br> <br>Bohlen used a method based on the 1/1 5/3 7/3 triad and combination <br>tones to derive this  tuning for the 13 tone scale and selected two <br>subscales from the entire set.  His delta (from dur, major) scale <br>(2 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 ) is a mode of Pierce's tempered form and has the <br>ratios 1/1 25/21 9/7 75/49 5/3 9/5 15/7 7/3 25/9 3/1. The gamma (minor?)<br>scale is not a mode of the above scale nor even an MOS, though it has <br>9 tones as well. Its successive intervals are  1 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 and its <br>JI form is 1/1 27/25 9/7 7/5 5/3 9/5 49/25 7/3 25/9 3/1. <br> <br>In addition to these 9-tone scales, Bohlen also mentions a 12-tone<br>scale repeating at the 3/1. It is generated from the 1/1 7/4 5/2<br>triad. In ratios, it is 1/1 11/10 6/5 30/23 10/7 11/7 7/4 21/11 21/10 <br>23/10 5/2 11/4 3/1. From the 1/1 3/2 5/2, he derives a 7 tone per<br>octave, 11 tone per 3/1, scale: 1/1 10/9 6/5 4/3 3/2 5/3 9/5 2/1 9/4<br>5/2 27/10 3/1. These are obviously related to quite different just <br>intonations for the 13th root of 3 scale.<br> <br>An 8-tone set derived from the 1/1 7/5 9/5 chord is also described <br>by Bohlen, but dismissed as a curiosity.It has the ratios 1/1 10/9 6/5 <br>9/7 7/5 14/9 5/3 9/5 2/1 and repeats at the octave.<br> <br>To be honest, I do not understand how these scales are<br>derived from the basic chords.<br> <br>Bohlen also proposes a logarithmic system of 1300 "hekts" to <br>the 3/1 analogous to the cycle of 1200 cents to the 2/1. To<br>calculate hekts, multiply the log of the interval by 1300 and<br>divide by the log of 3.  One assumes that hekt means a hundredth <br>of a scale step and derives from the Greek hekaton (100) and the <br>metric prefix hecto-.<br> <br>The refs:<br> <br>H.
