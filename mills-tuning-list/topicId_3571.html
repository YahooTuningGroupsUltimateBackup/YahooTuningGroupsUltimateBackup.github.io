I've read about them for many years, and all of a<br>> sudden I realized that I don't know the fundamental reason behind <br>> their origin. Any thoughts are surely appreciated....thanks...<br>> Hstick<br><br>There are two main reasons that scholars have accepted for the<br>emergence of music theory in a system of tetrachords:<br><br>1)  Tetrachords provide the smallest _diatonic_  interval-structure<br>    that repeats.  In other words, in a diatonic scale, that is,<br>    one with steps of the sizes "tone" and "semitone", the interval<br>    structure of the four notes within a "perfect 4th" will contain<br>    one "semitone" and the rest are "whole tones".  This is the<br>    smallest diatonic unit that provides a "semitone", and thus the<br>    unique smaller step which identifies the structure.  In genera<br>    other than the diatonic, the tetrachord still encompassed the<br>    main identifying interval, be it a 6/5 in the chromatic, a<br>    5/4 in the enharmonic, or some other ratio of a "3rd".<br><br>2)  Ancient Greek was a tonal language, where the _pitch_  of a       <br>vowel affected its meaning (like modern Chinese).  It is<br>    assumed that during poetic speech, the "melody" of the phrase<br>    covered approximately the range of a "4th", thus this became<br>    the important unit to the Greeks.<br> <br>   Joseph L.
