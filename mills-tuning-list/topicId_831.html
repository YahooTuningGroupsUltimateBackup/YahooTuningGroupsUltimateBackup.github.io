While I don't really program<br>much of *anything* with any regularity (given the range<br>of what's possible, one tries for some balance), it would<br>actually be nice to have some wider range of non12TET to<br>choose from [not that there's not chance for improvement,<br>as I'm just realizing as I type this (visions of segues and all<br>that). You might get somewhat of an idea by heading over to<br>browse at<br><br>http://www.msn.fullfeed.com/~gtaylor/RTQE.html<br><br>which will show you a year's worth of playlists. Why, that<br>naughty person who patiently attempts to disabuse Brian of<br>his Cageian delusions Eric Lyon (whose recent disc of<br>electroacoustic music "Red Velvet" positively *shreds*, by<br>the way) appeared only last week! If all goes well, I think that<br>our mutual cyberacquaintance Bill Sethares may well be paying<br>us an extended visit and playing his music after the Fall fund<br>drive. So, join your pals Mr. Polansky and Stevie Curtin and<br>Ted Mook and Bill Sethares and send me some stuff to corrupt<br>my audience with! Of course, you may wind up segued with<br>(gasp) Petie Boulez or (shudder) DJ Spooky [or do you say,<br>Basquiat?], but hey. The only music that I don't play on the<br>air is my own. If you're interested, let's take it to email<br>(gtaylor@msn.fullfeed.com works better than this address).<br><br>With regards,<br>Gregory Taylor<br><br>_<br>I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,<br>paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only<br>maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it.
