The fact that <br>Yamaha actually paid to patent a keyboard implementation indicates that <br>they take the possibility a little seriously. They may well try to <br>patent other instruments in a variety of tunings, and there is <br>nothing to prevent them from doing so but a good prior art search. I <br>am not being a Chicken Little when I say that when a large corporation <br>patents a well known idea, someone may be in for trouble. You may recall <br>that a number of years ago, Ned Steinberger prevented a number of competing <br>manufacturers from marketing micrometer style tuners, even though there <br>was plenty of prior art to prove that he did not invent the idea (see the <br>guitar in Thomas Jefferson's Monticello home).<br><br>John Starrett<br>http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</div><h3><a id=8669 href="#8669">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/1998 5:03:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Dave Keenan wrote:<br><br>> Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer.
