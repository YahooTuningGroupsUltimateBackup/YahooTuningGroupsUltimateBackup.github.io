Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/1998 10:07:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I spend some time looking at this monumental book yesterday, and it is<br>quite good. I feel certain that the majority of list members will find<br>that it strikes many chords with thier own musical understanding, in a<br>way that has never been succesfully verbalized before. There seems to be<br>a big hole, namely meantone temperament. But for the most part, the book<br>is beautiful and honest. The author believes, as I do, that under normal<br>musical conditions the ear does not recognize harmonic relationships<br>based on partials beyond the 13th.</div><h3><a id=7430 href="#7430">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph  Downing &#x3C;jdowning@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/1998 10:40:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Thu, 9 Apr 1998, Paul H.
