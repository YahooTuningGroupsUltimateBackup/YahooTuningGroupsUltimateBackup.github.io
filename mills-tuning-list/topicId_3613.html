As recently discussed on the list, brass timbres are harmonic.<br>Therefore, the usual tunings discussed here, i.e., just intonation,<br>meantone temperaments, various equal temperaments that approximate just<br>intonation, etc., are your candidates for the alternative tunings best<br>suited for brass timbres. I do think brass ensembles tend to adjust the<br>tuning of their chords towards just intonation even more than string or<br>vocal ensembles, since the dissonance of out-of-tune intervals is<br>intensified by the brass instruments' loud partials.</div>
