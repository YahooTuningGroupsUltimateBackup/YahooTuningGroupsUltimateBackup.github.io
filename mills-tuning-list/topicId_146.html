And the<br>   author pointed out that in the Chinese musical system there was no<br>   need for it.<br><br>   (If someone knows more recent scholarship on this, I'd be interested<br>   to hear of it.)<br><br>   Back in Hong Kong briefly (after trying mostly in vain to log on from<br>   Xi`an, China where I am teaching this semester), I was interested to<br>   see the above reference to China in the equal temperament discussion.<br>   Following is a note from my article, "The Harpsichord and Clavichord<br>   in China during the Ming and Qing Dynasties," in the Westfield Center<br>   for Early Keyboard Studies Newsletter (Oct. 1994):<br><br>      In Chinese musical philosophy, tuning, and even individual pitches,<br>      held both acoustic and abstract meaning, as well as  the power to<br>      transmit physical and spiritual qualities (qi). This helps to<br>      explain Kangxi`s interest in  tuning the harpsichords; tuned<br>      instruments signified an orderly empire. There was great<br>      interest in tuning systems; Zhu Zaiyu was the first to describe equal<br>      temperament in China in 1584 (see Kenneth Robinson, A Critical Study of<br>      Chu Tsai-yu`s  Contribution to the Theory of Equal Temperament in<br>      Chinese Music  (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1980).<br><br>   So it was not so different from the west, where tuning was both a<br>   philosophical as well as practical endeavor. Since Matteo Ricci<br>   brought the first clavichord to China around 1600, the proximity of<br>   these dates open up the possibility that western keyboard instruments<br>   in China during the western baroque period might at some point have<br>   been tuned to equal temperament. On this subject, an American<br>   colleague also teaching here (Prof. Gene Cho, HK Baptist University)<br>   is researching the connection between Matteo Ricci and this Chinese<br>   equal temperament, theorizing that he might have communicated the<br>   Chinese idea back to Europe.<br><br>   Joyce Lindorff<br><br>------- Exerpt from hpschd-l ends --------------------------------<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 4 Nov 1995 07:43 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA13086; Fri, 3 Nov 1995 21:43:36 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 3 Nov 1995 21:43:36 -0800<br>Message-Id: <951104054015_71670.2576_HHB22-1@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2249 href="#2249">ðŸ”—</a>masa@gold.interlog.com (marc sabat)</h3><span>11/3/1995 10:33:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>pi and e are transcendental numbers, and they're also fun...<br><br>(especially since with a bit of trickery you can derive that<br>e raised to the power i*pi is equal to -1)<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 4 Nov 1995 19:17 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA21917; Sat, 4 Nov 1995 09:17:44 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 4 Nov 1995 09:17:44 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9511041228.A2322-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2261 href="#2261">ðŸ”—</a>bf250@freenet.carleton.ca (John Sankey)</h3><span>11/5/1995 2:48:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com asks<br>"   What the bloody hell is a transcendental number?!
