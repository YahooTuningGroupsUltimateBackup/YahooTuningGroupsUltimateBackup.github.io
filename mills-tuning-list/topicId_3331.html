They were actually on the scene about <br>1967, and made two albums (both of which I still have on vinyl); they <br>have now reformed, and have two new CD's out. Simeon is the leader, and <br>he plays with a drummer. Simeon originally played this strange handmade <br>rig of oscillators and such, which he built himself...last nite, he had <br>the homemade stuff, augmented by keyboard synths to get samples and <br>such. He plays killer oscillator solos over very intense grooves, but <br>what's so great is that his solos are way outside the 12 tone system; it <br>sounds like a very intuitive sense of melody and pitch, and it somehow <br>works and sounds very natural. I kept thinking that Hendrix would <br>approve, because it was very heavy in a rock sense, yet totally original <br>and heartfelt, without any sense of trying to be commercial. Simeon is <br>way into this, and they are a very interesting group. I think their <br>website is www.silverapples.com...check them out if you like whacked out <br>rock.<br>    As far as microtonal film soundtracks, "Forbidden Planet" is a top <br>masterpiece, and again it's really unique and uncontrived. The Barrons <br>(Bebe and Louis) built circuitry for each character in the movie, and <br>were interested in sort of random effects; Louis said he wanted his <br>circuits to do things at random; he liked being surprised. I've never <br>heard anything quite like it. The Musician's Union made some noise <br>because they were not sure if it was "music," so in the credits the music <br>is called electronic tonalities. It is one of those ageless pieces; it <br>doesn't sound any different now than it did then, it doesn't sound like <br>part of it's "time"...Hstick</div><h3><a id=7447 href="#7447">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>4/14/1998 1:53:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>My opinion is based upon using Ensoniq samplers since 1989.  If you want to<br>>do a moderate amount of modulation in just intonation, 4 switchable scales<br>>are not enough.<br><br>   That's true.  But then again Ensoniq instruments respond to SysEx codes<br>too, noting the caveat you mentioned.

In many ways, I personally would prefer a<br>single global intonation.  I normally save different copies of the<br>otherwise same instrument separately, which is indeed annoying.<br><br>   Still, with individual pitch tables for individual instruments I can<br>simulate a global intonation table, but with a global intonation I can't<br>simulate individual instrument pitch tables.

It's FM timbres make a good counterpoint to today's<br>wavetable synthesis.  The Yamaha TX802 has been out of production for quite<br>some time, but you can pick up used units fairly easily for $300-$400.  You<br>need a memory cartridge to do the 64 tuning tables, however, so make sure it<br>comes with one as those are difficult to find these days.<br><br>K2000/K2500 octave-based intonation tables allow retuning over the entire<br>MIDI range for each note.  Even the tonic can be retuned, which is why it<br>makes modulation in just intonation so easy.  nTET and nCET scales can be<br>created at the program level by adjusting a few parameters, and are<br>unlimited in step size.  Resolution is 1 cent or better if done correctly<br>(see my web site).<br><br>> From: sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu (William Sethares)<br>> <br>> >The other problem is that the Ensoniq pitch table sysex codes were <br>> never fixed through 3 generations of samplers (EPS, EPS-16 Plus and <br>> ASR-10). <br>> <br>> This is somewhat misleading. It is possible to store the Ensoniq <br>> tuning tables in your computer. I know since I wrote a program <br>> several years ago to do just this. (Unfortunately, it was on an Atari <br>> computer, so it will be of limited usefullness to most). Thus - the <br>> problem is not with the "Ensoniq pitch table sysex codes", but rather <br>> that the authors of the software did not bother to implement the <br>> Ensoniq pitch tables. As far as I know, though, you cannot update <br>> them except by sending a whole pitch table, that is, you cnnot retune <br>> "one note" at a time. <br>> <br>You are correct.  I was mistaken on the Ensoniq SysEx codes -- chalk it up<br>to faulty memory.  Only the individual note SysEx codes (realtime updates)<br>are broken, not the pitch table SysEx dump.  In fact, 5-6 years ago I worked<br>on a patch editing template for EPS and EPS-16 Plus Pitch Tables for Sound<br>Quest's "MIDIQuest" generic MIDI patch editor, available for most computer<br>platforms.  It shows all the pitch adjustments at once.  But it updates the<br>table by dumping the entire thing, rather than just changing each parameter.<br>As I recall it only worked on the first pitch table, but I could probably<br>fix that if anyone is interested in it.  I also had working instrument and<br>layer templates.  The wavesample template was never completed due to several<br>obstacles, the worst being that wavesample "all" editing SysEx did not work.<br>These SysEx problems were eventually acknowledged by Ensoniq, after much<br>arm-twisting on my part. <br><br>> From: Xou Oxno <xouoxno@virtulink.com><br>> <br>> I own a 05R/W. 12 note scales, +/- 99 cents range per note. <br>> One user tuning. I'm 99% sure the whole family has those specs. <br>> I know the Trinity does. I think the X5DR has twice as many voices - 64.<br>> <br>Older Korg equipment has the +-50 cents limitation.  I'm not sure where the<br>cutoff date/line is.  I'm dependent on user feedback to keep the Microtonal<br>Synthesis Web Site up to date since I cannot possibly get access to all<br>those instruments.<br><br>	From: "Andrew L. Kaye" <androsky@fast.net><br><br>	I'm actually looking for a module that is<br>	not limited to 12-note scales.  Thanks, Andrew Kaye<br><br>In that case I recommend Ensoniq's MR Rack or ASR-X, Korg's Trinity series<br>or an Emu module.  If price is an issue then used Yamaha FM synthesizers and<br>Ensoniq samplers can usually be found for less than $600, but then you give<br>up the internal effects buses of the current units.<br><br>> From: mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)<br>> <br>>    I don't claim to have used much SysEx stuff to my Ensoniq gear, but I<br>> seem to recall that it implements a "virtual keypad" interface, meaning<br>> that SysEx messages simulate fingers hitting keys of the keypad.  If so,<br>> then in concept I would think that you could retune some note by virtual<br>> keystrokes, then extrapolate (duplicate in all octaves, or whatever<br>> interval) it.<br>> <br>The EPS SysEx virtual keypad interface had problems that kept it from being<br>useful.  As I recall I tried to use it to select pitch tables to get past<br>the 4 pitch table selection limit, and it kept switching back to the<br>instrument parameter page instead of the layer page that I needed to access.<br><br>John Loffink<br>jloffink@pdq.net</div><h3><a id=7489 href="#7489">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>4/18/1998 5:13:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>You're forgetting the 4 pitch table selection limit.<br><br>   There are ways around that of course.

Of<br>> course, this would clearly be the case on the Casios and Yamahas which all<br>> had<br>> resolutions larger than one cent, but what finally opened my eyes was my<br>> initial experience with the k2000 which has a fine tuning resolution of<br>> one<br>> cent. The Kurzweil had less pure intervals available than the others! Upon<br>> reflection I realized that due to the larger than one cent tuning res. of<br>> the<br>> Casios (CZ - 1.667 ct res./VZ - 1.5625 ct res.) & the Yamahas (1.171875 ct<br>> res.), at least once in a while one could stumble upon a relationship that<br>> came somewhat close to a purely tuned inverval. On the other hand, the<br>> K2000,<br>> with its 1200 parts per octave was in essence a type of "equal<br>> temperament"<br>> with no possiblity of even accidentally coming close to the decimals<br>> needed<br>> for seriously just tunings. <br>> <br>> Since this experience  (in 1992) I had the realization that the only way<br>> to<br>> achieve pure ratio derived tunings on a digital synth was to make my own<br>> samples at the desired frequencies and import them into my K2000. Perhaps<br>> some<br>> acceptable fudging can be done with the above instruments if one is<br>> composing<br>> percussive/pianistic types of music, but make no mistake - one is still<br>> only<br>> approximating just intonation when using ANY commercial hardware synth's<br>> tuning table.<br>> <br>So what is the minimum pitch resolution that is acceptable?
