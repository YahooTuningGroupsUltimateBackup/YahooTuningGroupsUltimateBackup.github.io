Is there some mathematical reason that such numbers as 768, 864,<br>1024, 1152 and 1280 have poor consistency?  (I took these numbers, by the<br>way, from the video modes my computer's video card supports, but they are<br>typical of the kinds of numbers that come up time and again in connection<br>with digital circuitry.)<br><br>Is there a number that is mostly powers of 2 that would qualify as having<br>high consistency that would make the synth manufacturers happy?<br><br>Just my 2 bits worth,<br>Fred.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------<br> Fred Kohler, #7-240 Burnside Rd E, Victoria, BC, Canada<br> phone:(250)388-7918  email:Fred_Kohler@bc.sympatico.ca<br>---------------------------------------------------------</div>
