He pushed a 19th <br>century viewpoint as far as it could go in explaining the world. He espoused <br>a "principle of reality" that he thought would govern any physical theory. <br>After Einstein's death, John Bell showed that quantum mechanics contradicts <br>Einstein's principle of reality, and countless experiments have settled the <br>question in favor of quantum mechanics. The two most important attempts at <br>reconciling realism with physics have been Bohm's theory and the many-worlds <br>interpretation. These theories leave dicussions of an ether far behind.<br><br>Quantum field theory, aside from general relativity the most accurate <br>scientific theory known, explains forces in terms of exchanges of particles <br>and fields in terms of virtual particles continually coming into and out of <br>existence. In some cases, such as the strong nuclear force, the intermediary <br>particles themselves are subject to the very forces they mediate, making <br>mathematical understanding very difficult; computer simulations are <br>currently the best way of understanding the strong nuclear force. The <br>concept of an ether is again left far behind, even in the most "realist" <br>ways of discussing the subject matter such as Feynman's.<br><br>Any attempt at a new physical theory must deal with all these issues and <br>explain the phenomena better and more accurately than existing theories. <br>Although there is nothing wrong with speculation and imagination, especially <br>for musical inspiration, a critique of modern physical theory cannot begin <br>without a solid understanding of what we have learned in the last century. <br>Ray Tomes' discussions are guided by a distinctly 19th century understanding <br>(I could provide ample evidence but don't want to start a thread here). This <br>view of the world is eminently comfortable and is held by nearly every <br>student of physics at one time or another. Upon learning of the discoveries <br>of modern physics, the student is almost invariably overtaken by feelings of <br>shock and disbelief, and attempts to distort the evidence to fit the <br>classical understanding. This was the reaction of most of the scientific <br>community, including Einstein, in the first few decades of this century.<br><br>Physics and mathematics have made such tremendous advances in this century <br>that the understanding of our political and moral leaders, artistic and <br>literary figures, and most intellectuals have at best only begun to scratch <br>the surface of what has been learned. Mostly there is misinformation, and <br>not a few "scientists" and "science educators" are badly misinformed and <br>propagate the misinformation. The quality of education has not kept pace <br>with the advances in physics and mathematics, so most of us are left far <br>behind. Feeling frustrated at this situation, many rebel; rather than <br>studying physics so that they can construct better theories, the <br>reactionaries spout very respectable-sounding 19th century dogma and claim <br>that the establishment took a wrong turn in this century.<br><br>It is an unhappy situation to have acquired such a firm and comprehensive <br>understanding of the world and then have the rug pulled out from under your <br>feet. Scientists considered the field of physics to be nearing a close at <br>the end of the 19th century. But soon a few holes in the dam began to <br>appear, and not long after the whole structure came toppling down. From the <br>bricks that remained, Planck's radiation equation, the Lorentz <br>transformations, etc., a new structure was erected that was bizarre by all <br>accounts but beautiful nonetheless. The work done remains incomprehensible <br>to anyone who has not dedicated all their intellectual resources to the <br>subject for years at a time. The motivations for such dedication have <br>dwindled tremendously as the short-term value of pure science is <br>overshadowed by that of applied science, and the social respectability one <br>obtains by dealing in increasingly abstract disciplines is near the bottom <br>of the ladder. As a result, there are fewer and fewer capable teachers of <br>physics and the ignorance of the public increases.<br><br>So for now, back to music.<br><br> -Paul E.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 14 Mar 1997 20:13 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17904; Fri, 14 Mar 1997 20:13:10 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA17900<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id LAA25538; Fri, 14 Mar 1997 11:11:18 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 14 Mar 1997 11:11:18 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01510101af4ed989048a@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5094 href="#5094">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/1997 2:06:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Fri, 14 Mar 1997, Atlas Eclipticalis wrote:<br>>    What is the acoustical basis for this chord / unique sonority?<br>>[the French 6th]<br><br>Well, personally I interpret it as the combination of two 4:5:7 triads,<br>one inverted.

A parallel<br>development of theory and pedagogy in the two areas led to the odd state of<br>affairs where we now have separate "harmony" and "counterpoint" classes.<br><br>Certainly the augmented sixth chords developed through linear processes, as<br>did sevenths, but the fact that they have an effect on the listener as<br>sonorities as well cannot be denied. (Schoenberg took this reasoning even<br>further, saying, "Non-harmonic tones form chords, hence they are not<br>non-harmonic; the musical phenomena they help to create are harmonies, as<br>is everything that sounds simultaneously.")<br><br>There are plenty of possible "interim" chords formed by voice leadings, but<br>only certain ones found a common place in common-practice theory. It seems<br>to me that the use of the German augmented sixth as a pivot chord,<br>equalling the dominant seventh in another key shows that, for the<br>classical/romantic composers who used this technique at least, the German<br>augmented sixth was no less a "passing" sonority than a dominant seventh.<br><br>I have always scratched my head over those who claim that, because Bach<br>used polyphony more commonly and prominently than Beethoven, he was a more<br>"linear" composer. It suggests that Beethoven didn't care about voice<br>leading or Bach about harmony, which is ridiculous. All of Bach's<br>counterpoint results in beautiful triadic harmony, and Beethoven was just<br>as careful as his predecessor about parallel fifths and proper resolutions<br>and so on. In this style of music, harmony and counterpoint are part of the<br>same fabric.<br><br>Now, I'm not trying to put all of these arguments into the mouth of Dr.<br>Belet, but he brought up an interesting topic that is important for tuning<br>and composition as well. I sympathize with his impatience with traditional<br>"music systems" instruction and its often one-dimensional perspective.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.

Our<br><>traditional "music theory" courses (I prefer to call them "music systems"<br><>courses, for they examine past, well-established practices, and really<br><>do not address 'theory' at all) get too carried away with Harmony as the<br><>primary structure, while linear melodic connections are actually the most<br><>important area of construction.<br><br><That's interesting. I think our traditional "counterpoint" courses get too<br><carried away with linear melodic connections as the primary structure,<br><ignoring harmony. Seriously, I think that one of traditional music<br>theory's<br><biggest mistakes is to teach that, for European music from at least the<br><16th to 19th centuries, it is possible to separate the "linear" from the<br><"vertical" and judge their relative "importance" separately.''<br><br>I think that this is a critical example of how the paper trail of theory<br>has diverged from practice - and how the theory can feed back upon music<br>making in a creative misreading (not unlike the literary hermeneutics of<br>Bloom). From Monteverdi's largely textural division into two practices, and<br>the solid tradition of counterpoint taught before figured bass, developed<br>the notion that counterpoint and harmony are independent domains - two<br>separate courses of study fitting tightly into semester schedules at large<br>Universities. To be fair, the best teachers and theorists (from Schenker<br>and Schoenberg to Boulanger) never made things out to be so black and<br>white, but their attempts to integrate vertical and horizontal viewpoints<br>rarely survived the journey to the heartlands, and by the mid-1950s, modal<br>counterpoint was seldom taught at all. A Schenker-inspired countermovement<br>would move again in the counter-direction, but like the set-theory-based<br>''new math'' of the 1960's, my impression is that it has been largely<br>taught in a mechanical way (with the goal of producing identical<br>'schenkergrams') by teachers not completely comfortable with the<br>theoretical rationale. I have heard that some schools are now moving in an<br>algorithmic direction. (Actually, the MacHose text that my Junior High band<br>director gave me used a statistical approach that could be considered a<br>prototype of certain trends in this direction). <br><br>The most interesting thing is that all of these swings in theoretical<br>orientation have made real marks on the way that people do make music, both<br>composing and performing. Ivor Darreg, to take just one curious example<br>from the microtonal community, learned from his teacher to assemble a<br>thematic catalog and to outline as many potential harmonizations as<br>possible. Had his teacher worked from a more contrapuntal basis, I imagine<br>that Ivor's music would have had a very different character.  Partch's<br>impulse to harmonize on the basis of chords built on ''stacked thirds'' -<br>as well as the systemic use of inversion - can be heard as a token of a<br>particular theoretical orientation.<br><br>To bring the thread back, Milne criticized my position on the 4-5-6-7<br>tuning of the dominant by arguing that harmonies with ninths and elevenths<br>voided my argument. However, I think that the repertoires in which such<br>extended harmonies are present are already well beyond the tonic-dominant<br>dynamic, and I am extremely hesitant to speculate about the intonational<br>content of such repertoires (M. Vogel's book on the ''Tristan'' chord<br>should be cited in this context). The question is, is 4-5-6-7 an<br>_acceptable_ (note that I have not said ''authentic'') tuning for the<br>dominant  in a repertoire - say Viennese classical music - where this<br>dynamic is well established?  While practically out of the question for<br>keyboard instruments, for strings, I find it acceptable - and in some<br>cases, desirable.<br><br>The augmented sixth chord's approximation of 4-5-6-7 in meantone deserves<br>further comment. As someone has pointed out, this chord was heard in<br>passing in choral music (which may or may not have been accompanied) and<br>only with frequency as a sustained chord in repertoire where ET was<br>established (at least as an ideal). So the question remains, why was this<br>wonderful chord not used more often in meantone keyboard music? I think<br>this is an excellent example of how our prejudice towards ''harmony'' - our<br>bias via training to hearing the vertical consonance - makes us relatively<br>deaf to the contextual, melodic ''dissonance'' caused by the proximate use<br>of tones from relatively distant scalar collections. This is, for me, a<br>wonderful example of how context can make an in-tune chord sound<br>''dissonant''.     <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 18 Mar 1997 18:24 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04833; Tue, 18 Mar 1997 18:24:28 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04823<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id JAA11210; Tue, 18 Mar 1997 09:22:43 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 18 Mar 1997 09:22:43 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703181713.JAA24473@sunatg3><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
