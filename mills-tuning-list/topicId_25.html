John Pusey once<br>asked about this sort of question.  <br><br>   88CET's nonoctave orientation poses a few logistical problems that we<br>wouldn't normally think of from our experience with octave-based tunings.  <br><br><br>Tuning Instruments to Each Other<br><br>   One curious complication comes in tuning nonoctave instruments to one<br>another.  The complication is that you have to find an exact common pitch<br>instead of an entire pitch-class to which to tune them.  To illustrate this<br>complication, think about the usual orchestral tuning procedure, wherein the<br>principal oboe plays an 440Hz A, and the other instruments successively join in<br>tuning to that pitch or octave equivalents to it.  Since there are no octaves in<br>a nonoctave tuning, a 'cello would have to tune to exactly an 440Hz A, which<br>does not correspond to an open-string, as would be preferable.<br><br>   But this complication is not as big a deal as it might sound if the nonoctave<br>tuning has a very accurate approximation to some other easily recognizable<br>interval.  Such a procedure for 88CET would be somewhat more complex, but<br>certainly not impractical.  Instruments could tune in pitch-range groups by<br>unison, 7:6 subminor third, 3:2 perfect fifth, 7:4 subminor seventh, 5:2 major<br>tenth, or 8:1 triple-octave below something like an 440Hz A.  (In the<br>triple-octave case, they would have to "aim low" by 8 cents.)  <br><br>   Ideally some sort of electronic tuner would be used for such a thing, but<br>since no tuner that I know of will easily read out 88CET pitches, such a<br>procedure becomes more practical than it might immediately seem.  Allowing each<br>individual player in a large ensemble to see a tuner's display is certainly not<br>without its complications either!  <br><br>   A similar concern comes up in tuning the "wavesamples" within a single<br>sampling synthesizer sound.  (Ensoniq uses the word "wavesample" for a digitally<br>recorded sound assigned to a short segment of consecutive keys on the keyboard.)<br>I have usually found tuning wavesamples to each other by matching 7:4s, 3:2s,<br>and such, more practical than using a tuner.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 23 Sep 1995 10:24 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id BAA27941; Sat, 23 Sep 1995 01:24:41 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 23 Sep 1995 01:24:41 -0700<br>Message-Id: <950923081920_71670.2576_HHB23-6@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
