There is semitruth and falsehood behind that<br>assertion:<br><br>The semitruth:  LucyTuning definitely can stack up more fifths above a tonic<br>   before approximately closing the circle than either quarter-comma or third-<br>   comma meantone.  Third-comma meantone comes "close enough" at 19 fifths,<br>   and quarter-comma at 31 fifths.  LucyTuning doesn't get there until about<br>   88 fifths.  But this is only a semitruth, because taken in absolutes, the<br>   circle of fifths never closes in ANY typical meantone tuning.<br>Falsehood #1:  Lucy claims that his property is because LucyTuning's fifth<br>   size is based upon pi, pi being irrational.  Pi has nothing to do with this.<br>   The frequency multiplier for quarter- and third-comma meantone's fifths are<br>   no more or no less irrational than for LucyTuning's fifth.  They are all<br>   defined as 3/2 divided by a root of 81:64, and roots of 81:64 (or at least<br>   the roots used in meantone calculations) are irrational.<br>Falsehood #2:  LucyTuning in no way invalidates the meaningfulness of integer<br>   ratios.  Lucy would be extremely hard-pressed to find anybody in the field<br>   of unusual tunings that will agree with him that the only reason why 3:2<br>   is significant to our ears is that it's an approximation to one LucyTuned<br>   fifth, rather than the reverse.  Speaking of ratios, the ratio of people<br>   who believe the standard JI-based model to those who believe Lucy's model<br>   is probably on the order of 100:1.<br>Falsehood #3:  This "new paradigm for mapping harmony" (how many fifths above<br>   or below a tonic you are) is clumsy at best for emulating other tunings.<br>   Without a doubt, there certainly are cases where it makes sense to think of<br>   pitches in terms of how many fifths apart they are, but there are vastly<br>   more cases where it doesn't.  For example:  Suppose we're looking for a<br>   LucyTuned approximation of a 9:7 within 2 cents.  Those two pitches would<br>   have to be 325 LucyTuned fifths apart.  Certainly it's flagrantly obvious<br>   that to say that two pitches are a 9:7 ratio apart is vastly more intuitively<br>   meaningful than saying that they are 325 fifths apart!</div>
