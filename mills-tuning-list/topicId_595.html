Thus it's important to be<br>clear on whether they are musically useful<br>or not.<br>We have seen why experiments on inharmonic<br>tones gave deceptive results prior to the 1970s.<br>Before the wide availability of computers,<br>it was not practical for most auditory researchers<br>to generate inharmonic tones digitally.  Thus,<br>most early experiments with inharmonic tones<br>were done with analog circuits.  These circuits<br>offered early researchers almost no control at<br>all over the fine structure of the inharmonic tones<br>thus produced.  In particular, researchers couldn't specify<br>detailed amplitude or frequency envelopes for each<br>inharmonic partial, nor did early researchers have even<br>crude control over the exact frequencies of the<br>inharmonic partials used.  <br>Typically,  FM or AM techniques were used to<br>generate inharmonic timbres.  These methods<br>generated large sets of audibly unrelated and<br>individually uncontrollable partials from an input <br>periodic waveform.  Prior to the use of computers,<br>there was thus no scale-like relationship twixt<br>adjacent inharmonic partials, as is found (say)<br>in an inharmonic tone produced by setting each<br>partial to the closest value in 19-tone equal<br>temperament.<br>By the 1980s the notion that inharmonic sounds<br>necessarily failed to fuse into a single percept, or<br>necessarily exhibited a fundamental pitch <br>unrelated to the pitches of the partials, had<br>been disproven.  Geary, for example, points<br>out that "This paper examines the hypothesis<br>that pairs of strongly inharmonic sounds can<br>also cause the perception of a kind of consonance<br>if the two have frequency components in common,<br>and dissonance if components at each make<br>near misses. This hypothesis is verified by<br>experiments in which subjects were asked<br>to choose which of two inharmonic sound<br>pairs seemed more consonant. The data show<br>significant agreement with predictions based <br>ont he missing and matching of spectral<br>components." [Geary, J. M., "Consonance and <br>dissonance of pairs of inharmonic sounds,"<br>J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 67, No. 5, May 1980,<br>pg. 1785]<br>Geary goes on to conclude: "Clearly, it cannot<br>be claimed that the perceptions are exactly<br>the same, since inharmonic and harmonic<br>tones themselves sound different to the ear.<br>However, the experiments do establish a<br>similarity between the consonance-dissonance<br>phenomenon in harmonic and inharmonic sounds.<br>Most of the subjects had prior familiarity with<br>the conventional meanings of the words consonant<br>and dissonant (especially the latter) and <br>conventional harmonic intervals were played and<br>identified for each subjec before the experiment.<br>Consequently one would expect the subjects'<br>judgments to be made according to the conventional<br>sensations of consonance and dissonance. The<br>similarity of perceptions in the harmonic and<br>inharmonic cases is further established by the<br>high scores of people with substantial musical<br>experience. (..) That such people chose the <br>predicted dyads in spite of their conventionally<br>dissonant relationships between their <br>fundamentals, and rejected other dyads with<br>conventionally consonant fundamental<br>relationships, is strong confirmation of<br>the hypothesis of this paper." [op. cit., pg. 1788]<br>Geary further mentions that "the concept of<br>inharmonic consonance and dissonance raises<br>intriguing possibilities for experimentation<br>in electronic and computer music. Consonance<br>and dissonance are responsible for much of <br>the structure of conventional music, such as<br>that in scales, chords, and harmonic practice.<br>If this structure is due to the configuration<br>of spectral components of harmonic sounds,<br>then it might be possible to alter such <br>structure by electornically relocating the<br>spectral components to  inharmonic positions.<br>New intervals, scales, and chords might be<br>possible, as well as timbres unobtainable<br>with harmonic spectra." [op cit., pg. 1789]<br>By the mid-1980s, with many computer-generated<br> inharmonic progressions in many different<br>compositions as audible examples, it had<br>become clear that inharmonic tones could<br>and did exhibit consonance, dissonance,<br>modes and cadences akin to those found<br>in harmonic-series-based compositions.<br>Examples include James Dashow's compositions<br>--take your pick: Whispers Out Of Time,<br>Sequence Symbols, etc.,; Risset's compositions,<br>against take your pick: Mutations II, Inharmonique,<br>Songes, etc.  Jonathan Harvey's Mortuos Plango<br>Vivos Voco, and so on and so on.<br>Slaymaker, in 1970, described some perceptual &<br>musical characteristics of harmony and melody<br>which uses inharmonic tunings and inharmonic<br>timbres: "Not all musical instruments [use<br>harmonic series timbres], however. The cast<br>bell carillon and tubular chimes, for example,<br>have tones that are not made up of harmonics.<br>Many of the intervals traditionally defined<br>as consonant sound quite dissonant on these<br>instruments; therefore, true chords are <br>seldom played on either of them, and chimes<br>are usually used in the orchestra only for<br>special effects. Conversely--a situation<br>seldom realized--some of the intervals<br>that have been classed as dissonant can<br>sound quite smooth on these inharmonic<br>instruments. Consonant sounds can also<br>be produced from synthetic tones having<br>partials that are spaced by  a constant<br>ratio, as long as the partials appearing<br>in a chord are not spaced closer than<br>the critical bandwidth of the ear." <br>[Slaymaker, F. H., "Chords From Tones<br>Having Stretched Partials," J. Acoust.<br>Soc. Am., Vol. 47, No. 6, 1970, pg. 1569]<br>Slaymaker goes on to describe the effect<br>of increasing timbral inharmonicity while<br>playing a traditional chord sequence:<br>"The impression of traditional predictability<br>still persisted, though the tone quality<br>gradually became more chime-like and the<br>intervals of the scale became more noticeably<br>different from the familiar tempered scale;<br>i.e., the sequence began to sound 'out-of-<br>tune.' The change in the S value from 1.083333<br>to 1.261839 resulted in a completely <br>different impression for the chord sequence,<br>compared to tfe impression for the values of<br>S nearer unity.  All of the traditional<br>predictability was gone.  The chords sounded<br>smooth and nondissonant but strange and <br>somewhat eerie. The effect was so different<br>from the tempered scale that there was no<br>tendency to judge in-tuneness and out-of-<br>tuneness.  It seemed like a peek into a new and<br>unfamiliar musical world, in which none of the<br>old rules applied and the new ones, if any, were<br>yet undiscovered." [ op. cit., pg. 1569]<br>With the advent of William Sethares' landmark<br>paper "Local consonance and the relationship<br>between timbre and scale," J. Acoust. Soc. Am.,<br>Vol. 94, No. 3, 1993, pp. 218-1228, those<br>rules became clear.<br>Demonstrations like Slaymaker's sounded <br>"out-of-tune" as the inharmonicity of the<br>timbres increased, because the chord<br>progressions were based on traditional<br>Western musical intervals...which are <br>themselves closely related to low members<br>of the harmonic series.<br>If instead the chord progressions of inharmonic<br>tones are based on an *inharmonic series* (and<br>not simply a set of arbitrarily stretched<br>members of the harmnic series, but rather<br>a coherent self-contained inharmonic series-<br>viz., the vibrational modes of the free-free<br>metal bar, or of the free metal tube) then<br>the inharmonic chord progressions will<br>produce a sense of finality and cadence.<br>This is also the reason why Mathews and<br>Pierce reported that extreme values of<br>partial stretch resulted in a destruction of<br>the finality of the cadences--Mathews and<br>Pierce were also using cadences whose triadic<br>root movements were based on<br>*harmonic-series-related* intervals.<br>However, I have used the commercial resynthesis<br>package FdSoft to analyze and resynthesize<br>sampled sounds.  Although this package is<br>greatly inferior to the LEMUR Fourier analysis/<br>resynthesis software available for the Macintosh<br>(which I cannot run since I have only a Mac Plus),<br>FdSoft does analyze and resynthesize some<br>timbres relatively well.  For instance, solo <br>brass instruments, strong (not whispered)<br>vocal timbres, and some solo woodwinds and<br>double reed instruments retain their identity<br>well upon Fourier analysis/resynthesis without<br>modification.  <br>Using FdSoft, I have determined that most timbres<br>retain their identity well when resynthesized with<br>slightly inharmonic partials--for example, setting<br>the partials of a resynthesized trumpet or trombone<br>or clarinet or english horn note to the closest<br>values available in 41-TET produces an inharmonic<br>sound which is virtually unchanged perceptually<br>from the original sampled sound, yet exhibits <br>subtly increased sensory consonance when used<br>in 41-TET triads.<br>Warping the partial frequencies by larger values<br>(for instance, setting them to the nearest <br>approximations available in 11-TET or 13-TET)<br>produces a slight perceptual distortion of the<br>trumpet or trombone or clarinet or english horn<br>note upon resynthesis...  The effect is somewhat<br>similar to very slight ring modulation.  These<br>timbres, however, exhibit greatly increased<br>sensory consonance upon resynthesis.<br>Pushing this method to its uttermost extreme,<br>I have determined that some sounds even retain<br>their identity well upon radical timbre-mapping.<br>For example, a trombone note retains its identity<br>very well even when mapped into the closest<br>partials of the free-free metal bar scale (with<br>all partials not close to members of the metal<br>bar scale deleted).  The resulting timbre sounds<br>slightly denatured and empty because large numbers<br>of partials have been deleted, but the sound is<br>still recognizably a trombone--but, weirdly,<br>it sounds like a trombone crossed with a chime.<br>The effect is very strnage--as though you could<br>somehow put a mouthpiece on a metal bar and<br>instead of striking the bar, produce sound<br>by blowing through the mouthpiece. (A perceptual<br>paradox I've also  heard in the Yamaha series<br>of physical modelling synthesizers, which allow<br>you to "put a mouthpiece" on a bowed string<br>instrument and "blow" instead of bow a violin<br>or cello or viola.)<br>Most sounds do not retain their iden<br>	  well<br>when their component partials are mapped into<br>such a radical non-just non-equal-tempered scale,<br>but *all* such resynthesized sounds retain the<br>sense of spectral fusion--no doubt because all<br>the original auditory cues are still present: <br>synchronous fluctuations of amplitude envelope in <br>each partial, the slight trajectory in frequency for<br>each partial, the initial identical "blip" of the attack <br>of all the partials, the overall synchrony of <br>the partial envelopes and the ensemble effect<br>produced by their synchronized decay, etc.<br>My experiments in this area, however, pale<br>before William Sethares' investigations.<br>William Sethares has produced many musical<br>examples using inharmonic timbres and<br>inharmonic tunings.  The tunings sound<br>convincing, consonance and dissonant are<br>present, and cadences exist--yet they are<br>unlike those present in harmonic-series-<br>based music.<br>With typical clarity, Sethares points out<br>that "One subtlety that arises when <br>dealing with nonharmonic partials is<br>that it is important for the partials to<br>fuse, to be perceived holistically as<br>a single entity rather than as a collection<br>of oddly placed sine waves. Fusing is<br>greatly helped by commonalities in the<br>partials: similar pitch vibrato, similar<br>amplitude fluctuations, similar onset<br>times and similar envelopes." [Sethares,<br>W., "Local Consonance and the Relationship<br>between Timbre and Scale," J. Acoust. Soc.<br>Am., Vol. 94, No3., Sept. 1993, pg. 1227]<br>William Sethares' music is the most <br>convincing example yet of the falsity of<br>Erlich's contention.  From now on,  people,<br>please read the literature before making<br>these kind of claims.  Please get the facts<br>straight, and do the reserach.  Let<br>us hear no more of verifiably false claims that <br>inharmonic timbres cannot spectrally<br>fuse, or that they necessarily produce <br>(via virtual pitch) unrelated and bizarre <br>fundamental pitches: anyone who doubts that<br>inharmonic timbres can be used to<br>produce convincing and entirely<br>musical cadences & harmonies<br>need only  e-mail William Sethares<br>and ask for a copy of his demonstration<br>tapes.
