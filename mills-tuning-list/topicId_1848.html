Actually, I <br>was hoping someone would write a general review of the concert, but I'll<br>do it as I think the List should contain more than just discussions <br>of theory, though I'm one of the prime offenders in this regard.<br><br>As it happened, I drove up to LA last Saturday to meet with Erv Wilson, <br>Marcus Hobbs, and Stephen J. Taylor at Marcus's home for a pre-concert <br>demo of their recent work implementing Erv's theories in Kyma. Bill Alves <br>also joined us there and we all enjoyed a Thai dinner before proceeding<br>to Pierce College.<br><br>The program began with three pieces by Lou Harrison -- "Avalokiteshvara"<br>(from La Kora Sutro?), "Waltz,"  and "Sonata in Ishartum" (a Bablylonian<br>diatonic mode in "Pythagorean" tuning, equivalent to the the Greek <br>Dorian as I recall). Harrison's music is always a treat to hear and the <br>"Just Strings" ensemble  of Schneider (just guitar), Susan Allen<br>(retuned harps), and Gene Sterling (pitched and unpitched percussion)<br>did not dissapoint. Sasha Bogdanowitsch joined the ensemble for the<br>next set, three movements from his "Atom turning in the Sun of Eternity."<br>Of these pieces, I especially enjoyed "Peace Yearning," in Archytas's<br>7-limit enharmonic in which Sasha accompanied the ensemble with his voice.<br>I forgot to ask him about the text, alas.<br><br>Just Strings then performed Harry Partch's "Letter from Hobo Pablo," <br>in the orginal version for plucked strings. John played adapted guitar<br>and intoned the text while Susan and Gene simulated the Kithara part<br>on a harp and three restrung and retuned guitars. While I missed Harry's<br>somewhat gritty and ethoxylated voice, John did the vocal part very well. <br>The guitars amazingly captured the Kithara sound; when I shut my eyes, I <br>could easily visualize myself hearing the Kithara itself. I found this <br>to be an interesting experiment and a truly corporeal experience.<br><br>George Zelenz and Louis Johnson performed  "Moment Condensate," a <br>suite of four pieces on a orchestra comprising a large array of <br>justly tuned metal tubes (Tubulongs), a rack of hanging metal slabs <br>and several smaller instruments. Of the movements, my favorite was <br>"The World is not mystical, THAT the  world is, is the mystical" (sic).<br>I'd like to hear more of George's music; despite a few phone conversations<br>in the past, this was my first meeting with him.<br><br>Rod Poole performed "The unfathomable loneliness of the Light year man"<br>on a guitar fretted to a just intonationof 17-tones. This was a wonderful<br>piece and Rod is a superb performer. It was a pity that due to a schedule<br>change, we did not get to hear him play bowed guitar as well.<br><br>Carter Scholz's piece "Rhythmicon" wasinspired by Henry Cowell's <br>mechanical instrument. The performance  was realized by John Schneider on <br>justly tuned guitars and presented from tape. It was a fascinating <br>experience as various melodies organized themselves out of rhythmic <br>processes based on the first <br>17 members of the harmonic series.<br><br>The first half ended with a stunning performance of "Micronesia" by Neil <br>Haverstick on 19-tone electric guitar. Haverstick is demon guitarist and<br>seems completely at home in the 19 and 34-tone equal temperaments. He<br>was accompanied by Gene Sterling of "Just Strings" on a drum set.<br><br>After af intermission, we were treated to Yoko Ayaya on the Koto <br>and a performance of Midare, a 17th century piece by Yatsuhashi Kengyo.<br>This piece made use of the major third-minor second pentatonic scale,<br>of which the Greek enharmonic is a variant. <br><br>Kraig Grady then performed one of his "Anaphoria Island" pieces on a <br>group of tuned aluminum slabs suspended over large, tall wooden <br>resonators. Kraig wore a wonderfully weird mask with a long, curved<br>snout  while he performed virtuosically on this instrument. The slabs<br>were tuned to JI, a bass subset of the eikosany + 2 scale that he<br>uses in much of his music.<br><br>Neil astonished us again with a solo performance on the 34-tone guitar. <br>Neil also gave a moving tribute to Larry Hanson, who is hospitalized and  <br>could not attend the performance. Hanson is responsible for constructing <br>the 34-tone guitar and making it available. Hanson also collaborates <br>with Erv Wilson.<br><br>The concert closed with Terry Riley's "In Just C" by the whole ensemble.<br>Needless to say, this was an unusual and eclectic mix of timbres and<br>forces, but it worked. I might also add that it was a temporally <br>abbreviated performance due in part to the late hour.<br><br>Afterwards, we and most of the performers repaired to a nearby restaurant <br>for conversation and food until about 2 AM. It was a great evening and <br>John Schneider deserves our congratulations and appreciation for putting <br>together such a successful program of microtonal music. Let us hope it <br>becomes an annual event.<br><br><br>To change the subject, I think Paul Erlich has eloquently presented <br>the case for contemporary physics, making my planned discussion <br>unnecessary. I might add that if one wants to study the use modern<br>physics makes of vibration in QM and cosmology, consider supersymmetric<br>superstring theory where fundamental particles appear as vibratory<br>modes of "strings" in a hyperspace of up to 26 dimensions. I will<br>end with the statement that sounds in air are not analogous to <br>gravitational or EM waves in a hypothetical "ether" (QM vacuum?" Sound<br>consists of macroscopic longitudinal waves in an elastic medium. <br>Gravitational and EM radiation are transverse waves whose physics<br>and mathematical description are entirely different. <br><br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 15 Mar 1997 22:54 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA25330; Sat, 15 Mar 1997 22:54:47 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA25329<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id NAA12284; Sat, 15 Mar 1997 13:52:27 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 15 Mar 1997 13:52:27 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703151650_MC2-12A6-99E3@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
