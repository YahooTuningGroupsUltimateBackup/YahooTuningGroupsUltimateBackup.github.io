Well, that works.  Thing is, "sensitivity to mistuning"<br>> can mean so many things.  I'm just now seeing how<br>> you're using it here, and I can't say that it is in any way<br>> incorrect.<br><br>> There is a type of "sensitivity to mistuning" that does not<br>> obey the inverse to odd limit rule.  For this type of<br>> sensitivity, it seems that the 3/2 is much more sensitive<br>> than the 7/4.  Further, it seems to matter to this type of<br>> sensitivity wether an interval is mis-tuned sharp or flat.<br><br>I think we're touching on something quite important here. <br>It seems to me that these two different types of mistuning<br>sensitivity may relate directly to thinking in terms of equal<br>temperament or ratios. (This is possibly incorrect, though.)<br><br>The fact that a 3/2 is simultaneous more and less sensitive<br>to mistuning also seems to have something to do with<br>the fact that, because 3 is the next-strongest prime quality<br>after the octave (2), it can be both absorbed into the strength<br>of 2, in which case mistuning is not much of a problem, or<br>can stand out as a powerful new identity, in which case<br>mistuning will be very obvious.<br><br>I have said before that a basis of my theories is that we<br>will always try to "break down" any complex situation<br>into its most easily understood components.  If periodic<br>frequency vibrations can be understood in terms of<br>how they divide into 2s and 3s, this is a very easy<br>comparison for our brains to make, thus even a small<br>deviation will stand out very noticeably.  The case is<br>much more complex for, say,  an accurately-tuned 7/4. <br>It would not be as easy to notice a deviation from a<br>ratio with 7 as a factor, simply because 7 is a much<br>more complex comparison to make than 2, 3, or even 5,<br>and each higher prime is correspondingly more complex.<br><br>   Joseph L.
