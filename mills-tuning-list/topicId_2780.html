One takes a given pitch, calls it the<br>tonic, then fixes the six intervals that are consonant with it, 3:2 4:3<br>5:4 5:3 6:5 & 8:5 both ascending and descending (not really necessary,<br>because three of these are inversions of the other three, but this makes<br>the process clearer, and nearer to the viewpoint of a singer). To find<br>the tonal dissonances one ascends and descends by the same six consonant<br>intervals from the pitches consonant with the tonic. This gives 3/2 x<br>3/2 = 9/4 (or 9/8), 3/2 x 4/3, 3/2 x 5/4, etc which yields 12 additional<br>pitches, called tonal dissonances. One can then use each of these 12<br>pitches as new points of departure, proceeding from each via the six<br>consonances, to find 18 atonal dissonances. And so on ad infinitum.<br><br>This manner of constructing just intonation is open to the important<br>objection that it may well be possible to relate a dissonance more<br>closely to the tonic via fifths than via minor thirds, say. So an atonal<br>dissonance such as 27:16 or 45:32 (the latter often used in the just<br>diatonic scale!) might be considered more closely related to the tonic<br>than a tonal dissonance such as 36:25.<br><br>On the other hand, two factors militate against such an objection.<br>First, fifths often give rise to dissonances quite near to consonances<br>(e.g. 27:16 or 81:64) and such dissonances are not likely to acquire any<br>very stable melodic existence at all, for they are susceptible to being<br>drawn into the orbit of adjacent consonances, and drained of any<br>possible melodic individuality. Second, we are not really dealing with<br>the fifth versus the minor sixth, say, but with the three consonant<br>cycles: fifth/fourth, major third/minor sixth and minor third/major<br>sixth, and each of these cycles is more or less equally important to<br>harmony.<br><br>If one accepts the three septimal intervals 7:4 7:5 & 7:6 as consonant,<br>just intonation becomes immeasurably more complex. But the additional<br>values are melodically identical with those defined via the six<br>traditional consonances of the senario. Futhermore, the septimal<br>intervals have only the most tenuous mathematical or acoustic<br>relationship with the intervals of the senario. And inasmuch as no<br>informed person doubts that the six consonances of the senario are ,<br>even if not the only consonances, at the least much more consonant _as a<br>system_ than the septimal intervals _as a system_, whether one defines<br>the septimals as weak consonances (as some do) or as weak dissonances<br>(as I and many others do) is largely irrelevant to just intonation qua<br>theoretical basis for temperament.<br><br>It need scarcely be observed that this or any other just intonation is<br>_not_ fit for practical use in music; it is the indispensable basis for<br>tuning theory, but requires to be tempered before it can be used in<br>actual music.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Quick Note on Tape-Swap Orders<br>PostedDate:  14-12-97 20:39:12<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  14-12-97 20:37:18-14-12-97 20:37:18,14-12-97 20:36:59-14-12-97 20:36:59<br>DeliveredDate:  14-12-97 20:36:59<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656D.006BC49C; Sun, 14 Dec 1997 20:39:03 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA15056; Sun, 14 Dec 1997 20:39:12 +0100<br>Date: Sun, 14 Dec 1997 20:39:12 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA15055<br>Received: (qmail 29566 invoked from network); 14 Dec 1997 11:39:08 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 14 Dec 1997 11:39:08 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541101b0ba2027ca2d@DialupEudora><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
