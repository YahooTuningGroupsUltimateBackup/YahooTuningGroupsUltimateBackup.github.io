I mean, this all gets back to why 12/eq came about in the <br>first place...purely tuned scales are, for all practical purposes, very<br>limited in their applications...as soon as you want to move a lot of chords<br>around, it's all over for just intonation. Thus, jazz, "classical", most<br>"pop" music, and many other styles around the world cannot use JI, no<br>matter what people prefer...if you prefer JI over eq (and, of course,<br>which eq are we talking about), you ain't gonna be hearing it in bluegrass<br>any time soon, or just about any other music except modal based stuff.<br>Sure, Wendy does it on her synths, but that's a lot of complex gear <br>which is inaccessible to most musicians...again, in a practical, nuts<br>and bolts musical situation, eq temps are the only possible choice for<br>many various styles of music...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 31 Aug 1996 14:13 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10521; Sat, 31 Aug 1996 14:14:27 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10781<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id FAA25452; Sat, 31 Aug 1996 05:14:26 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 31 Aug 1996 05:14:26 -0700<br>Message-Id: <009A7ACE4EAC3000.0E37@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
