Suppose I<br>took two 12TET scales separated by 80/81. Then one would have both nice<br>sounding thirds and a wide open modulation horizon.<br><br>One idea I had for a keyboard setup was to use the left hand on one 12TET and<br>the right hand on the other. Then to play a simple diatonic scale one might<br>have a pattern like RRLRRLLR.<br><br>Equal tempered scales have the property that each note has the same set of<br>intervals available. With other scales, notes will fall into some set of<br>classes based on what precise intervals are available. Most non-ET scales<br>repeat on an octave cycle, so a typical 12 note per octave scale would have<br>12 distinct classes of notes.<br><br>The scale I propose above would have 24 notes per octave, but break into just<br>two classes.<br><br>Conventional ET is not the only system with interval symmetry. One can have<br>multiple generating intervals instead of just one. For example if one takes<br>the set of pitches (2**n)(3**m) then every note has the same intervals<br>available.<br><br>If I understand how the "k-limit" term is used, it might be useful to make a<br>finer distinction. Suppose I take a set of notes (2**n)(3**m)(5**p) where n<br>and m are unbounded but p is constrained to be 0 or 1. My understanding is<br>that this scale would be called 5-limit. The scale where p is also allowed<br>unbounded values would also be 5-limit. Perhaps the case of unbounded<br>exponents is not of sufficient interest to merit a new term?<br><br>Jim   <br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.

In other words, you mean the non-vanishing of<br>>the syntonic comma.<br>><br>>> I am aware that some will say to themselves - so what?<br>>>But a musical system that does not close the cycle of fifths has at a<br>>>stroke isolated itself from 99% of the music not merely of the western<br>>>19th century, but from virtually the whole of the western tradition,<br>><br>>If we substitute "the non-vanishing of the syntonic comma" for "non-closing<br>>of the cycle of fifths" above, you are correct. However, 19th century<br>>composers such as Schubert rely on other properties of 12-tone tuning, such<br>>as the "closing of the cycle of major thirds" (really the vanishing of the<br>>diesis) that make 19-tone unusable for this music.<br>><br>>>and<br>>>from many other musical traditions as well.<br>><br>>Care to give an example?<br>><br>>>Such musical systems, like<br>>>just intonation, are mere curiosities, and are far more impoverished in<br>>>usable, aurally distinct resources even than the 12-tone equal.<br>><br>>You are calling Turkish, Hindu, and many other musics "impoverished."

In this case, I simply mean that<br>the fact I use such temperaments means that I must approve of them.<br>The justifications I give may not be my real reasons, but it is<br>beyond doubt that such reasons exist.<br><br>The two temperaments I use most often -- and therefore the ones I<br>must value most highly -- are 31 equal and a schismic fourth mapping.<br>31 equal needs no introduction, of course.  I use a 12 note mapping<br>-to a conventional keyboard, usually with Ab rather than G#.  I<br>sometimes use other meantone temperaments with the same mapping.<br>I am fully aware of the simplifications that result with meantone.<br>I prefer 31 equal because of its good septimal approximations.<br>Actually, the second scale (after 12 equal) I ever tuned up is a<br>subset of 19 equal.  It is a good way of cutting your meantone<br>teeth, because of the high contrast between different semitones.<br><br>Now, to the schismic fourth.  I outlined this on the list before.<br>To summarise, it uses schismic temperament (a major third is<br>associated with -8 rather than +4 fifths) with 12 steps to a fourth.<br>This is consistent with 29 equal.  The actual tuning I use is near<br>enough Pythagorean.  This mapping is harder to use than the<br>meantone one, but the advantage is in purer intervals and more<br>melodic sublety.  The more I use it, the more I get to like it.<br>Although the harmonies are good, I haven't worked out any chord<br>sequences yet, other than approximations of standard diatonic ones,<br>which require comma shifts.<br><br>Being able to use such small intervals means you can add an<br>emotional edge not usually possible on a fixed pitch instrument.<br>And, when you want a pure interval, it's really ease to find.<br>If I want, I can get a mistuned affect by hitting the "wrong"<br>keys.<br><br>Originally, I was tuned to 53 equal.  As well as the relatively poor<br>septimal approximations, I didn't like the commas being so small.<br>They have a sort of distressing sound as a result of being barely<br>audible, and can't function melodically.  Switching to 41 equal<br>solved both problems.  After some theoretical work, though, I found<br>the better approximation.  The commas are smaller -- slightly larger<br>than Pythagorean -- but just large enough to be audible.<br><br>I'm also starting to play with 22 equal, now that I've got a<br>symmetrical keyboard.  I have previously used Paul Erlich's 22 note<br>mapping with 46 equal.  I gave up on this because I decided the<br>schismic mapping works better, although it has even more notes.<br><br>I have made some use of 7 and 5 equal, extended just intonations,<br>and various "ethnic" tunings.<br><br><br>If acoustic instruments are to be liberated from 12 equal, I<br>suggest they be designed to play in the widest possible variety<br>of tunings, rather than simply adopting a new temperament.  The<br>choice of tuning is as personal as orchestration and would, in an<br>ideal world, be available to all composers.<br><br>I can't see it's at all reasonable to expect the world in general to<br>switch to 19 equal.  It may work for wind instruments, as a template<br>from which to bend to 7-limit harmony, but it is too extreme for<br>people to accept it otherwise.  By "extreme" I mean relative to 12<br>equal which has a special place as all other temperaments are, in a<br>sense derived from it.  12 equal is a meantone, schismic and<br>diaschismic scale.  As Gregg observed, other scales tend to be<br>melodically confounded with 12 pitch classes.  Orchestral instruments<br>incompatible with the repertoire of -- like it or not -- 12 biased<br>music aren't going to catch on.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Steven Rezsutek <rezsutek@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov><br>Subject:  Re: 19tet vs. meantone?<br>PostedDate:  17-12-97 20:57:18<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  17-12-97 20:55:13-17-12-97 20:55:13,17-12-97 20:54:51-17-12-97 20:54:52<br>DeliveredDate:  17-12-97 20:54:52<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256570.006D6B06; Wed, 17 Dec 1997 20:57:04 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18337; Wed, 17 Dec 1997 20:57:18 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 17 Dec 1997 20:57:18 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18340<br>Received: (qmail 11078 invoked from network); 17 Dec 1997 11:57:17 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 17 Dec 1997 11:57:17 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199712171956.OAA10629@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
