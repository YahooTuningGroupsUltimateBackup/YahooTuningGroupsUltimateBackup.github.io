He plays<br>with Johnny R. in the AFMM festivities and has his own groups. Now he also<br>has his own record label, to whit he says:<br><br>"Thought you'd like to know we have a website up now for our microtonal<br>music label, FreeNote Records. The address is:<br>	<br>	http://home.earthlink.net/~freenote/<br><br>Take care - JC"<br><br>You can all get there yourselves; unless I am sadly mistaken, our own David<br>Beardsley is moonlighting as an HTML jockey - I think he did their site.<br><br>Also, I noticed a few posts about Justonics products; I just happened to<br>pick up a July '97 Keyboard mag today (for WWW-related audio articles) and<br>there is a two page review of Justionic Pitch Pallette. I realize their web<br>site probably has a lot of the info, but here's another take on it (I won't<br>be reading it til tonight myself!).<br><br>Finally, I'll be posting a new bit of stuff on the Corporeal Meadows site<br>later today (God / RAM willing...), partly 'fetish' materials but also some<br>current news about recording and reading matter availability. Stop by and<br>look for the Current News...<br><br>Stay consonant, all!<br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br>*--------------------------------------------------------------------*<br>   Jonathan M.
