In short my idea is that the<br>intervals in the Baka scale constantly adapt to each other according to the<br>musical context, in such a way that musically pertinent *differential<br>notes* ("virtual bass lines") are created.<br><br>I want to thank the people who took the time to write to me. BTW I was<br>really amazed by Mr McLaren's post, one week later, describing a new<br>composition by his friend Larry Polanski which, if I understand well, seems<br>to put my theory in practice :-)<br><br>However the main question in my message remained unanswered :<br><br>Don't *all* tuning systems, at least those related to polyphonic musical<br>traditions, actually consist of tones constantly adjusting against each<br>other according to the musical context so that they produce musically<br>pertinent sonic artifacts at a given moment ? Can a scale be anything else<br>than a rough description, a *static* hence necessarily misleading<br>approximation of a reality made of interactive, *dynamic* microtonal shifts<br>?<br><br>I have the feeling that, more than the ET, the comparatively recent<br>tendency to attribute a *prescriptive* and not anymore *descriptive*<br>function to musical notation is reponsible for denying the existence of<br>sonic artifacts such as differential notes (why write something that anyway<br>appears without anybody playing it ?) but also for having people believe<br>there are actually only two different basic intervals (half and whole tone)<br>and only 12 different notes in the octaves.<br><br>The concept of measure is another example of map taken for the territory. A<br>few centuries ago orchestra conductors would count not "one, two, three,<br>four" but "one, one, one, one" ("tactus"). Orchestras got bigger, bigger<br>orchestras needed more obvious points of reference not to drift<br>rythmically, so these unities became grouped by 3, 4 etc. This<br>unequivoquial division of time leaded to the flagrant rythmic<br>underdevelopment of western music compared to west african music for<br>example. And so a convention adopted for practical rather than musical<br>reasons had a durable influence on the way we understand music. No ?<br><br>I would appreciate very much any comments about my simplistic views from<br>you honorable crowd of theorists, scholars, mathematicians whose<br>literature, I confess, often flies way above my self-taught musician's<br>head.<br><br><br>Vincent Kenis<br><br>     @< @<br>        -<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 23 Dec 1995 17:01 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA14354; Sat, 23 Dec 1995 08:01:07 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 23 Dec 1995 08:01:07 -0800<br>Message-Id: <0099B4E0862C6A76.579E@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
