Joe Monzo said <br><br>>Although earlier in this Tuning Digest, Brian Lee discredited the actual<br>>relevance Danielou's ratios have to Indian musical performance, I have<br>>accepted the idea, which as far as I know was first propogated by<br>>Danielou<br>>and subsequently by Ben Johnston, Scott Makeig and others, that each<br>>prime number is a unique dimension in terms of both aural and affective<br>>quality.<br>><br><br>I am not a practising Indian Classical Musician (although I love the music)<br>and when I said that the Indian Classical Musicians don't go along with<br>Danielou's 5 limit ratio theory, all I was doing was reporting what the<br>musicians themselves had said. There are ratio analyses of ICM which give<br>prime limits up to 31 and if anyone's interested I'll be happy to dig out<br>the references.<br><br>Secondly, I have no argument with the idea of the quality of prime numbers.<br>Danielou's writing was the thing that got me into thinking in those terms.<br>What I cannot go along with however in Danielou's work is that anything<br>over prime 5 takes you into potentially dangerous areas metaphysically.<br>There are many musical cultures which tune to higher prime limits than five. <br><br>I hope this makes my position clearer.<br><br>Brian Lee</div>
