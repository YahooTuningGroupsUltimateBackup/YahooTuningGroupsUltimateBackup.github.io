A long-neglected masterwork by<br>a great American composer will soon be heard<br>in New York.<br>Good work, Johnny!<br>--mclaren<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 24 Jun 1996 10:30 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id BAA10951; Mon, 24 Jun 1996 01:30:09 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 24 Jun 1996 01:30:09 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199606240829.BAA10841@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
