I wouldn't equate him with <br>Thumbs Charlie or Albert King (who really knew how to bend a <br>note, seriously). I'd put Harry on the same level as, say, Charlie Parker<br>or Jimi Hendrix. A true innovator. Isn't he THE first western composer<br>in recent times to use just intonation? Way cool.<br><br>Whatever......................................................<br><br>Check out the British Harry Partch Society web page for the <br>latest (July) issue. (just thought I'd mention that)<br><br>Which reminds me, what ever happened to 1/1? I paid<br>them for a membership renewal a year ago and got one newsletter<br>when I was promised three. Isn't that mail fraud? (Yes!)<br><br>Our (IMMP) web pages should be ready soon. The most recent<br>tape is the 1995 Trenton Avant Garde Festival Electro-Acoustic <br>compilation. Along with five insane tape pieces and a virtual<br>minimalist sort of chamber ensemble, is my JI synth <br>piece "Science Friction". <br><br>It uses a tuning from the lower, but not too low harmonic series. <br>As soon as I get covers and more tapes, I'll post something <br>about how to get the tape for purchase or trade.<br><br>      *      *      ..    *    ... .*    D a v i d   B e a r d s l e y<br>dmb5561719@aol.com        .     .      . *         .   .   ...      <br>              I M M P   &    B i i n k!    m  u  s  i  c  *        ..<br>E m a i l      for a catalog of strange beautiful m u s i c ... .<br>     . ..         .*..            . .. .           ..* .     .    ..   . *. .<br>                           not a store, but an independent label.<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 28 Aug 1996 01:19 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01816; Wed, 28 Aug 1996 01:20:19 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01855<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id QAA18604; Tue, 27 Aug 1996 16:20:18 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 27 Aug 1996 16:20:18 -0700<br>Message-Id: <20960827231702/0005695065PK3EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
