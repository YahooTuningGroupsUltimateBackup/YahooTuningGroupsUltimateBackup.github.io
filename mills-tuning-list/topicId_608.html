Balzano's group theoretic<br> micrtonal ideas<br>---<br>The talented Australian composer Paul Turner<br>recently wrote me a letter in which he described<br>some provocative ideas about microtonality.<br>Paul's ideas were based on group theory.  Because<br>different equal temperaments exhibit different<br>cyclic rotational properties, Paul pointed out that<br>a number of different tunings which appear outwardly<br>dissimilar share underlying structural properties.<br>This idea is particularly interesting because Paul<br>appears to have arrived at it independently.<br>Gerald G. Balzano also came up with similar ideas<br>about 15 years ago.  His best-known paper is<br>his Computer Music Journal article "The Group<br>Theoretic Structure of 12-fold and Microtonal<br>Tunings."<br>Balzano's CMJ paper is interesting insofar as it<br>distills a number of properties which Balzano<br>sees as definitive of the major mode in Western<br>music.  He then goes on to show that tunings<br>of the form (N)*(N+1) satisfy this criterion.<br>Thus for  N = 3 Balzano's theory gives a<br>12-TET scale; for N = 4 Balzano's theory gives<br>a 20-TET scale; and for N = 5 Balzano derives<br>a 30-TET scale. <br>He was able to show that all three scales <br>exhibit similar melodic properties.<br>This is an interesting idea because it <br>proceeds solely from a consideration of<br>the melodic properties of the scales in<br>question.  To my knowledge, the only only<br>microtonal theorists who have put forth<br>theories of microtona scales based solely<br>on the melodic properties of the tunings<br>in question are R. Vermeulen,  Max Meyer<br>and Boomsliter & Creel.<br>The advantage of such a theory is that it<br>reveals similarities between tunings which<br>would otherwise appear to have nothing in<br>common.  The disadvantage of such a theory<br>is that--because it's solely concerned with<br>the melodic properties of scales--the harmonic<br>properties of the scales thus generated tend<br>to be unpredictable.<br>In the case of the 20-TET and 30-TET scales,<br>neither one has fifths particularly close to<br>the value of the third member of the harmonic<br>series.  This is neither "good" nor "bad," of<br>course, but it is certainly *different* from<br>12-TET...which has a perfect fifth which<br>falls within 1/600 of an octave of the third<br>member of the harmonic series.<br>Thus, while the 20- and 30-TET systems <br>will likely sound similar melodically to<br>12, they will sound harmonically very<br>different. <br>Paul Turner also recently sent me a number<br>of piano pieces in 5, 7, 8 and 9 tones per<br>octave.  <br>Why is it that the most interesting music<br>being done today always seems to arrive<br>in the mail on someone's cassette?<br>Maybe someone can explain this to me.  <br>Whenever I buy a CD of the "latest" so-called<br>"serious" contemporary music done in New<br>York or Boston or some other high-powered<br>place, the music usually sounds okay--it's<br>generally performed with verve and gusto,<br>and the acoustics are very nice.<br>But the *really* interesting new music seems<br>to come out of nowhere, from people I've<br>scarcely heard of, on cassettes.<br>There must be a good reason for this. Perhaps<br>gobs of hard cash can't substitute for musical<br>talent...?<br>Nahhhhhh!  This America.  Gobs of hard cash<br>can substitute for *anything.* <br>As Bill Wesley remarked when I asked why<br>the French and Germans and Japanese had<br>bullet trains when we in the U.S.A. didn't:<br>"This is America.  We've got bullets, we<br>don't need trains."<br>--mclaren<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 17 Jul 1996 20:42 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA10266; Wed, 17 Jul 1996 11:42:05 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 17 Jul 1996 11:42:05 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01510100ae12e0049bc0@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
