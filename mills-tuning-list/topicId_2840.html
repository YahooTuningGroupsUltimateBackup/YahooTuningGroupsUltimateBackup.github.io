The 19-tone equal much better suits the -<br>scanty and inconclusive - evidence. But 19-tone equal has no netural<br>third, which is well-attested for Arab instruments.<br><br>It is a problem. I do not even read Arabic, so I am conscious of my<br>amateur status in this respect. Nevertheless, determined to outrage<br>someone or other, I trudge on. The Arabs seem to be as confused as<br>anyone regarding the intonation of their singers.<br><br>The modern Arab theorists have done their utmost to impose the 24-tone<br>equal for instrumental music. But Arab singers cheerfully (if that is<br>the right word) go their own way, and certainly do not regularly,<br>deliberately use intervals as close as 50 cents. Also, this music is<br>full of glissandi, and musical temperament is of little relevance to<br>that kind of ornament.<br><br>So perhaps their system, rather like Western Rock music, amounts to a<br>mixed system, with instruments and singers on a very different melodic<br>wavelength. Rock musicians seem to find a way to live with this, though<br>they certainly do not do so _deliberately_, as a conscious device of<br>art, and it is preposterous to assert that this is a great advantage to<br>them. It is also possible that Arab singers actually can use the more<br>conjunct intervals of the 24-tone equal, excluding the 50-cent interval.<br>But this would exclude the enharmonic...<br><br>Insofar as one wishes to preserve enharmonic melodies without<br>eliminating the consonant thirds, there can be no choice except the<br>19-tone equal. It is true that the circa 150-cent interval, reasonably<br>well-attested for Arab melody - though under what degree of instrumental<br>tyranny or tutelage I know not - is not present in enneadecaphony. This<br>however is the _only_ interval outside the 19-tone system that has much<br>chance of being accurately singable; the neutral third is too dissonant,<br>atonal and disjunct to avoid confusing it with the minor third (which it<br>resembles in artistic effect more than the major third). But the circa<br>150-cent interval is quite conjunct and also happens to fall almost<br>exactly between the melodic centers of 16:15 & 10:9, so, as I have<br>noticed in my brief treatment of 31-tone equal, it does seem possible<br>that a singer could learn to definitely ascribe a definite, independent<br>melodic significance to this one interval, even though there is a<br>_great_ deal of overlap between this interval and the diatonic semitone<br>below and the minor tone above. Here then is a limited example where<br>singers _may_ be able to partly escape the powerful forces leading them<br>to the melodic division of the octave into 1/3 tones and the 19-tone<br>equal.<br><br>I think I have mentioned that this interval of about 150 cents occurs in<br>the 31-tone equal, where it corresponds to a 4/5 tone. Note however that<br>this interval is perfectly unadapted to harmony, which the modern Arabs<br>and Indians often seek to imitate. My own personal opinion is that Arab<br>(and Indian) vocal melodies are far, far more likely to be exactly<br>recognizable in the 19-tone equal than in the 17- 22- or 24-tone<br>divisions, in despite of the troublesome matter of the 150-cent<br>interval.<br><br>I would never claim that all singers throughout the world necessarily<br>sing in 19-tone equal (such a claim almost carries its own refutation)<br>but only that they necessarily _tend_ toward this system unless<br>deliberately, rigorously trained to use different pitch classes for<br>melody. Even then, I doubt that singers can be trained to sing arbitrary<br>intervals in consonant or disjunct dissonant melody. Such arbitrary<br>intervals are confined to the realm of the conjunct dissonances, that is<br>to say, to the intervals narrower than 6:5.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Brian B." <BBELET@SJSUVM1.sjsu.edu><br>Subject:  Re: Steel guitarists' tuning names<br>PostedDate:  18-12-97 18:49:19<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  18-12-97 18:47:10-18-12-97 18:47:11,18-12-97 18:46:48-18-12-97 18:46:48<br>DeliveredDate:  18-12-97 18:46:48<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256571.0061B2D2; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 18:49:04 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01498; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 18:49:19 +0100<br>Date: Thu, 18 Dec 1997 18:49:19 +0100<br>Message-Id: <9712181749.AA01498@ns.ezh.nl><br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00347<br>Received: (qmail 2645 invoked from network); 18 Dec 1997 09:49:14 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 18 Dec 1997 09:49:14 -0800<br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=7765 href="#7765">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/12/1998 6:52:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Tue, 12 May 1998, Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi wrote:<br>> A friend of mine asked for an orchestration book written in the last 20 years.<br><br>One that I like is Samuel Adler's, which is in its second edition and I<br>think is from '89 or so.<br><br>--pH <manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu> http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote<br>    O<br>   /\        "Churchill?
