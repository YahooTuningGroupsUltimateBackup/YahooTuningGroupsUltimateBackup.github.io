One of the main<br>goals of Sethares' 88CET-optimized partial mappings is to create a pseudo-octave<br>with a pitch-duplicating sensation kind of like the real octave's.  That 14-step<br>pseudo-octave works great for doubling on these mapped timbres.  On<br>approximately harmonic timbres however, this and the other false perfect<br>consonances don't work at all for doubling.  The rest of this posting addresses<br>doubling in reference to the usual unmapped timbres.  <br> <br>   Can the octave-doubling principle be extended to tunings that don't even have<br>an octave, by doubling by an interval other than an octave?  Brian McLaren, who<br>has worked with a variety of nonoctave tunings, believes that whatever your<br>cycle-interval may be can produce a doubling effect.  He reports, for example,<br>that doubling notes in 3:1 perfect twelfths in Pierce-Bohlen tuning works just<br>great.  <br><br>   What exactly the cycle interval is in 88CET, or in Carlos' alpha and beta<br>tunings for that matter, is not immediately apparent.  The step size for these<br>tunings, unlike Pierce-Bohlen, are not based on making any particular interval<br>exactly just.  They are instead based upon making several target intervals as<br>accurate as possible.  <br><br>   To my way of thinking, for a tone added to a chord to be thought of as a<br>double, that tone should not have much effect on the underlying character of the<br>entire chord.  If it changes the character of the chord, then it clearly has a<br>significant function in the new chord, so it doesn't make sense to think of it<br>as a functionally equivalent double of a another chord tone.  <br><br>   The idea of nonoctave doubling then has meaning provided that: <br>1.  The interval by which you double a note is more "bland" than the intervals <br>    in the chord itself.  Consider for example the traditional 4:5:6 close-<br>    voiced, root-position, major triad.  Doubling the root an octave higher <br>    does not significantly change the underlying character of the resultant <br>    chord from its undoubled form.  The octave added into that chord is <br>    comparatively bland; doesn't attract our ears' attention like the thirds.  <br>    On the other hand, if we were to instead to try to double its root a 7:4 <br>    ratio higher, the underlying character of the chord does significantly <br>    change.  It becomes a dominant seventh chord.  The subminor seventh <br>    attracts attention as much as the thirds in the chord, if not more.  <br>2.  No other resultant interval is more interesting than the intervals in the <br>    undoubled chord.  Using the above example of doubling the root of 4:5:6 <br>    major triad up an octave, the resultant chord has the ratio 4:5:6:8.  That <br>    clearly creates the interval of an octave between the root and its double <br>    (4:8), but it also creates a perfect fourth (6:8), and a minor sixth (5:8).<br>    The underlying character of the chord does not change also because those <br>    intervals are no more attention-getting than the major and minor thirds <br>    already in the undoubled chord.  Obviously you would get a very different <br>    sensation if you were to start with a 3:4:5 second-inversion triad, and <br>    attempt to double the bass up a perfect fifth.  Although the interval of <br>    doubling, the fifth, is bland in comparison with the other intervals in the<br>    original chord, this also produces a 9:8 major second, which is clearly <br>    anything but bland, so it definitely attracts attention away from the <br>    constituents of the original chord.  It changes the chord's underlying <br>    character.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 16 Sep 1995 20:23 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA26065; Sat, 16 Sep 1995 11:23:55 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 16 Sep 1995 11:23:55 -0700<br>Message-Id: <950916182135_71670.2576_HHB42-7@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2010 href="#2010">ðŸ”—</a>71670.2576@compuserve.com</h3><span>9/17/1995 12:05:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Thanks for correcting me on that.<br><br>   Oh, by the way, here's a side-note for you clarinet fans:  I picked up a<br>recording some of you might be interested in.  A little known fact is that<br>Mozart's Clarinet Concerto and the Quintets were written for an instrument<br>somewhat different from the modern Bb/A soprano.  That instrument could perhaps<br>be described as a hybrid of the usual soprano with a basset horn.  (The basset<br>horn is kind of like the modern alto clarinet except that it's in F instead of<br>Eb, and - much more importantly - its bore diameter is essentially the same as<br>that of the soprano.)  <br><br>   The instrument that Mozart wrote these works for was essentially a soprano<br>clarinet with its low end range extended down something like a major third or<br>perhaps a P4 (it's hard to tell from the pictures).  I already had a CD of the<br>quintets done on an original instruments' implementation of this instrument<br>(AMON RA CD-SAR-17), but I hadn't heard the Concerto performed this way.  I<br>don't have the CD with me, so I can't locate the numbers and such, but it's<br>performed by David Shifron as I recall.  <br><br>   The performance of the Concerto was pretty good, and was interesting because<br>of the spots where the usual score goes up an octave to accomodate the smaller<br>range of the modern instrument - he doesn't do that here.  But the performance<br>of the quintets isn't as impressive on my opinion.  There are places where the<br>expressivity is kind of lacking, and I got the frequent sense that the quartet<br>was trying to slow Shifron down and the reverse.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 17 Sep 1995 23:42 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id OAA16329; Sun, 17 Sep 1995 14:41:59 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 17 Sep 1995 14:41:59 -0700<br>Message-Id: <950917213339_76400.1435_HHL46-1@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2011 href="#2011">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Edwin M.
