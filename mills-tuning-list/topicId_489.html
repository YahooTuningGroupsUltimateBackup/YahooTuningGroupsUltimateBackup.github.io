My <br>brother (CDR expert) estimates more conservatively at about 10 years with <br>the current media and sloppy handling. <br>	There are a couple of good CDR drives going for $700 and the <br>media price has dropped to $6 per disk. Within a couple of months <br>Phillips, Sony and Yamaha drives will all be available for about $700 <br>(Bob says stay away from the JVC unit). CDR is not as permanent as CD <br>with real pits and lands, but a disk with a 10 year lifetime is more than <br>adequate for distribution to reviewers and radio stations as a promo <br>tool. <br>	Brother Bob is going to loan me a Pinnacle CDR unit so that I may <br>learn to record CDR myself, and I will keep the forum updated on my <br>progress in the nerdly art.<br>John Starrett<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 16 Jun 1996 01:09 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id QAA04249; Sat, 15 Jun 1996 16:09:00 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 15 Jun 1996 16:09:00 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v015101019b1893b9598b@[205.218.46.34]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
