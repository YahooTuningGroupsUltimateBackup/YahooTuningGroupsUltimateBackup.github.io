Nice site!<br>>But as I was running through the list of microtone "pioneers" I didn't<br>>find Haba listed.<br><br>I assume Steve was speaking of my page<br>www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html<br>I am not familiar with Haba, and all the categories on that page are<br>incomplete either due to ignorance or sloth (both in this case). I<br>welcome any suggestions for additions, improvements or corrections. I<br>have been told by a number of people that my page is a useful resource,<br>so I hope the knowledgeable folks on this list will write to me<br>jstarret@math.cudenver.edu<br>if they have any suggestions to improve it.<br>Apologies go out to Paul Erlich, whose article I have still not got<br>around to formatting properly.<br><br><br>Gregg Gibson said:<br>>those who choose to wage the war to make 7:4 consonant I advise to do<br>>some reading, thinking, and listening; even if they manage the feat, they<br>>will find themselves involved in the thankless task of attempting to erect a<br>>system of tonal relations outside the senario, and based on very weak<br>>consonance at best<br>I say, what does reading have to do with it? I laughed out loud. 7/4 is a<br>marvelous consonnance! Gregg, listen to some motorized machinery or other<br>musical source where the harmonic series is plainly heard, then try to<br>cast out that 7/4.<br><br>And furthermore--<br>>The 19-tone equal temperament is the only closed, fully cyclic system<br>>toward which just intonation, in its practically audible aspect, tends;<br>>it is therefore the only correct system.<br>To which I respond:<br>The 12-tone equal temperament is the only closed, fully cyclic system<br>toward which just intonation, in its practically audible aspect, tends;<br>it is therefore the only correct system.<br><br>And, by the way<br>>Having now given sufficient information to, at the least, propel the<br>>open-minded to a close examination of the 19-tone equal temperament,<br>>having also perhaps discouraged a few frivolous triflers from disgracing<br>>the 19-tone equal temperament by any use of it,<br> I have examined 19tet, and found that every interval but the octave is<br>dissonant, with furious beating and bleating, and yet you seek to stretch<br>the octave, ruining the only consonance the tuning has to offer.<br><br>Gregg, my jesting is all in good humor, but I can back up my assertions by<br>the same methods you use to back up yours. I know you have some valid<br>points, but it seems your mind is made up about every one of your conclusions.<br>This sometimes happens when a person works in isolation, or when one's<br>immediate peers have little or no knowledge of the subject in which one<br>is expert. You seem to be well read, and you have a nice formal writing<br>style, albeit a little confrontatory. I urge you not to ruin your professional<br>life by treating your peers like a confederacy of dunces.<br><br><br>John Starrett<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com><br>Subject:  Greek tetrachords in 19<br>PostedDate:  24-12-97 23:24:26<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  24-12-97 23:22:10-24-12-97 23:22:11,24-12-97 23:21:40-24-12-97 23:21:41<br>DeliveredDate:  24-12-97 23:21:41<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256577.007ADFF1; Wed, 24 Dec 1997 23:24:03 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA25341; Wed, 24 Dec 1997 23:24:26 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 24 Dec 1997 23:24:26 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA25268<br>Received: (qmail 2726 invoked from network); 24 Dec 1997 14:24:23 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 24 Dec 1997 14:24:23 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.96.971224142201.3291D-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
