But many disagree.  Partch's chapter in<br>> Genesis of a Music is really great about this point (the one<br>> with the letter from Fox-Strangeways).  Boy that chapter<br>> is really a thrill!<br><br>> Basically, what I got from this chapter is that modulation is<br>> best defined simply as switching the 1/1, and that common<br>> tones, while playing, of all things, perhaps the most important<br>> role in the use of modulation, are not necessary in its definition<br>> or execution.  And perhaps, that a theory of modulation may<br>> be constructed where tones separated by a comma can still be<br>> considered "common"!<br><br>I've written about this same passage in my book.  Partch describes<br>three ways of modulating, assuming two chords which possess<br>a "common tone":<br><br>1)  Making the "common tone" consonant with the first chord and<br>     dissonant with the second.<br><br>2)  Making the "common tone" dissonant with the first chord and<br>     consonant with the second.<br><br>3)  Making the "common tone" actually two different tones which<br>     are close by in frequency (differing by said "comma") and<br>     which are each consonant with their respective chords.<br><br>His conclusion, with which I agree, is that all three methods can<br>be used to effect a modulation in just-intonation, giving a richness<br>and subtlety of expression which is  _utterly non-existent_  when<br>utilizing the 12-Eq scale to present the same musical passage.<br><br>I have some interesting observations of my own in this regard,<br>involving not full-fledged modulation, but rather short-term<br>tonicization:<br><br>1)  I have tried sequencing Mozart's 40th Symphony in several<br>    different versions, using ratios that were 5-limit, 7-Limit and<br>    19-Limit.  5-Limit sounded best, 7- and 19- were both OK, but<br>    when tonicization was effected by a common-tone related by<br>    7, it didn't sound right.  It sounded  to me like the tonality veered<br>    off into a weird key that was microtonally "off".  This argued<br>    against the applicability of 7 in Mozart's music.<br> <br>2)  In my own "Incidental music to 'Invisible Haircut'", I use<br>tonicizations<br>   which have 19 as a factor in the common-tone.  This piece has<br>   a jazz/ blues flavor, and I find that the 19-limit tonicizations work<br>   well (they certainly provide a richness that the bland 12-Eq version<br>   lacks completely).  This may, however, be because 19/16 is so<br>   close to the 12-equal "minor 3rd" that the _interval of modulation_<br>   is not so strange to my ears.  I'll grant that it's possible that, had<br>I<br>   used it in the tonicization, 7 may have sounded just as strange in<br>   this piece as in Mozart.<br><br>3)  I sequenced some of Satie's "Sarabande No. 1" in just-intonation,<br>    and found that tonicizations involving 7 sounded "off" here too,<br>    tending to corroborate what I said in #2.<br><br>My original point was that no matter how well any equal temperament<br>represents whatever ratios, there's no substitute for the richness<br>and subtlety of expression which is possible when using ratios<br>themselves.  Numbers can be compared in all sorts of different<br>patterns and combinations, and when these numbers represent<br>_easy-to-hear_  musical relationships, the variety of musical<br>relationships is correspondingly expansive.  I'll grant that equal<br>temperaments are easy to hear in melodic terms, but, aside from<br>the ratios they imply well or badly, they don't have much<br>significance from a  _harmonic_  standpoint.<br><br>Part of the problem I have with 12-Eq serial music is that I just<br>can't hear many of the supposed relationships in the music that<br>have been pointed out by theorists.  I will admit the possibility that<br>things that are happening in music that are numerically related<br>but are not consciously audible may still have some kind of effect<br>on our nervous system, but at our present state of theoretical<br>knowledge, I think it's best if we deal in terms of what can<br>demonstrably be _heard_.<br><br>I think a large part of the reason Schoenberg stuck with the<br>12-Eq scale was because he realized intuitively that within the<br>vastly expanded resources of his implied 13-Limit, were he to<br>work in just-intonation, the number-play involved could quickly<br>become a bottomless pit from which his musical inspiration would<br>never again emerge into the light of day.  Then again, I also<br>think he wanted to make use of the ambiguities made possible<br>by a comparison of so many close ratios on the one hand and<br>their nearby 12-Eq equivalents on the other.<br><br>My whole idea of primes having distinct qualities is useful<br>compositionally when, for example,  using a precisely-tuned<br>81/64 "Pythagorean major 3rd" or 9/7 "septimal major 3rd"<br>instead of the usual 5/4 "just major 3rd", or when sliding<br>around between them, as good blues singers do, to create<br>a specific effect that 5/4 just doesn't give.<br><br>I refuse to accept an equal-temperament because it makes<br>modulation "easy" or (excuse me while I laugh) "possible".<br>Part of the reason JI composers use JI is because, within<br>a restricted JI scale, modulation to a new key brings a<br>whole new set of intervallic relationships into play, giving<br>each key its own distinct "flavor", far more pronounced<br>in their differences than anything a well-temperament can<br>do.<br><br>The only reasons I can see for accepting any equal-temperament<br>is that it is easier to play on most instruments, and, as I stated<br>in another post to this issue, the study of the interplay between<br>JI and ET in the same piece is becoming more and more interesting<br>to me.<br><br>   Joseph L.
