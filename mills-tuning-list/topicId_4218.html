There are other reports of first reactions to European music ranging<br>from indifference to a feeling that the music was impoverished because of<br>its simple rhythms, unornamented melodies, lack of percussion, etc.<br><br>Certainly European harmony has not taken over all of the traditional music<br>of the world (thank goodness!). Popular music may seem like a<br>counterexample, but I think that it's more of an example of a mass-marketed<br>Western style that has had indigenous features glossed over it, rather than<br>European harmony added to a traditional form. Of course there are some<br>examples of the latter, but probably just as many examples of non-Western<br>influence on Western music -- clearly not on the scale that one would<br>imagine if indeed harmony was something that everyone would "gladly<br>incorporate into their music when they have once experienced it."<br><br>Medieval polyphony was something perfectly suited to the aesthetics of<br>gothic church music, so it is little wonder that contemporary writers<br>praised it, just as later writers praised the symphony orchestra, Bach's<br>counterpoint, Mozart's melodies, or Beethoven's emotionalism. Yet I would<br>hardly conclude that other cultures if exposed to Bach, Mozart, or<br>Beethoven would gladly don their styles. One might also point out that the<br>Medieval music refered to in those accounts certainly did not have "full<br>chordal harmony" as we think of it.<br><br>My interpretation of that arrogant 19th-century missionary's account is<br>that the indigenous people were excited to hear familiar melodies in a<br>novel context, just as the Europeans must have been astonished to hear<br>Dutch marches played by Javanese prajuritan ensembles or a Chinese<br>orchestra playing "God Save the Queen."<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
