I'll be <br>the first to admit that my microtonal tutorial is shallow and slipshod.<br>David Doty's excellent book "The Just Intonation Primer" is a model of <br>clarity of exposition. I would love to link to it instead of offering my <br>crude efforts. Does an abbreviated version exist on the web to which I <br>could link?<br><br>I have searched the web for microtonal sound files and have found slim <br>pickings. I am sure I am not alone in the belief that we need to bring <br>the sounds of alternate tuning systems to the people, and the web seems <br>to me custom made for this purpose. I have a few microtonal sound samples <br>and some just interval sine wave samples on my home page. Does anyone <br>have any ideas on the best ways to make our ideas heard on the web?<br><br>I went to Tower Records yesterday and spent $65 on microtonal CDs. I felt <br>like I got about $20 worth of music, not because the music was bad, but <br>because the music I bought was mostly  "new age", a style of which I am<br>not particularly fond (but, as Jerry Seinfeld would say "...not that <br>there's anything wrong with it"). Tower Records has a completely separate<br>room for world music. Wouldn't it be nice if they <br>had at least a bin for "microtonal" music, calssified minimally by <br>style? The Catler Brothers are quite different from Harry Partch, and <br>neither is "new age".<br>   <br>I also was frustrated by the lack of exterior liner notes on the CDs. <br>Many that I knew were microtonal had no indication of that on the <br>outside of the package, and I wonder how many others I missed because of <br>this. Maybe we could have an icon for "microtonaliy" that we could include <br>in the cover art. Although those in the know can find good dicographies <br>on the web and order from the Microtonal Music Source, we need to have <br>this stuff available where everyone can find it. <br><br>I know Neil Haverstick does music in the schools programs through the <br>Denver Musician's Union. Are we all doing what we can to bring our music <br>to young ears, and in a way that will be engaging and encouraging to <br>young musicians? I'd love to hear what others in this forum do along <br>these lines, as I can use all the new ideas I can get.<br><br>Finally, there is probably a core set of microtonal masterpieces on <br>which many subscribers will agree. It would be helpful to know what <br>these works are in order to intelligently direct the neophyte (and <br>seasoned neophytes like myself) to some  appropriate introductory pieces.<br>Nothing will hurt our cause (ouch! 60s) more than to extoll the virtues of <br>xenharmonia to a fresh ear, only to have the possible convert turned off by a <br>silly recording of microdoodling. I think Brian listed his top 20 <br>masterpieces a couple of months agoin response to a Haverstick post...any <br>other nominations?<br><br>Sorry for the length of the post, but I think we should consider some <br>of these things.<br><br>John Starrett (www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret)    <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 17 Nov 1996 20:46 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA15006; Sun, 17 Nov 1996 20:48:12 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14791<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA19079; Sun, 17 Nov 1996 11:48:09 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 17 Nov 1996 11:48:09 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.961117113332.10099B-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
