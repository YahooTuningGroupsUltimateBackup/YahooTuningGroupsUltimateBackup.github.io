I think so,<br>in an admittedly general sense.  Listening to composer and Musicworks<br>editor Gayle Young's string quartet on a Musicworks CD crystalized for<br>me what all the music has had in common.<br><br>Perhaps it is ultimately the influence of composer James Tenney (formerly<br>of the U.S. Southwest) that bring just intonation aesthetics to the fore.<br>Jim Tenney worked with both Partch and Varese and has imbued younger<br>Torontoans with an appreciation for just intervals, while encouraging each<br>to compose in their own voice.  To his credit, Jim came to the concert and<br>to the demonstration the following day, now with his daughter.  At that<br>time he presented me with a score to his just intonation wind quintet<br>"Spectrum 2" and with a CD of his just intonation piano quartet.<br><br>John Gzowski comes to music from a jazz/rock tradition and I had the<br>opportunity to rock out with his rock band on my last night in the city.<br>Guitar led John to  19ET and finally to elaborate chamber works in both<br>31-ET and JI for a "2 by 4" (which made its debut at the concert, and<br>sings electrically in rich low harmonic sounds, but with a bounce).  I<br>found his music well thought out and deeply philosophical, and allowing<br>ample room for improvisational instincts.  <br><br>John was joined by Garnet Willis who vocalized, percussed, and let<br>loose his "Clusterflux" which is an artifically intelligent<br>magnet/electric standalone that I jammed with on bassoon. It responded to<br>my tiny glisses like a person.  It is also Tenney influeced, as well as<br>Lucier influenced.  He also wrote an exciting piece for English violinst<br>Becky van der Post and himself at a piano retuned to a subset of 31ET.<br><br>Adapted violist (a real beaut, probably better sounding than Harry's) Marc<br>Sabat played with full command and sensitivity in the 6 Li Po that I<br>intoned.  His solo was for an electronic violin which droned and shook off<br>colors of pitch.  In addition he played in all the larger chamber works<br>written by John Gzowski and it was indeed a pleasure to be with so many<br>literate microtonalists that could play richly and with excitement.<br>Margaret Gay at the cello gushed harmonics and the inimitable Rick Sacks<br>sparkled throughout the evening with a myriad of percussion variegation.<br><br>>From these, and other musical interactions, I get this<br>glacial sense with Toronto's microtonal music, as if microtones had a<br>sense of esteem that preseumesa sure footing in presentation.  While there <br>is little melodic musicle flexing or even rhythmic alternations, there is<br>a serenity in the production and a confidence in the employment of the<br>materials.  There is almost a gamelan effect regardless of the person<br>involved.  This seems all<br>the more so after hearing Andrew Timar's Toronto Gamelan group -- The<br>Evergreen club -- ironically busier than most other gamelan groups I have<br>heard.<br><br>Toronto's music is much more supported by the Federal Government in Ottawa<br>thanI had imagined.  Additionally, it is quite a beautiful thing that the<br>Northern hemisphere's pre-eminent New Music publication - Musicworks -<br>presents CDs with each issue, encourages microtonalisms, and is open to<br>outside creative forces.
