As with John Starrett, Neil has been very excited about it, and I'll<br>definitely chime in on that excitement too.  I think it turned out quite<br>nicely indeed!  If there are any disappointments to voice, they're very<br>minor ones at worst.<br><br>   I'll see about coming up with a review of it later (actually, I'll<br>encourage somebody who didn't contribute to review it first).  But here are<br>the strongest impressions the CD leaves me with:<br>1.  After all the theorizing we do on this list, it sure is great to hear<br>    some actual music coming from us!<br>2.  This CD presents a very wide variety of styles, from pop, to<br>    middle-eastern, to Renaissancey, to spacey, to abstract.<br>3.  It also has a wide variety of tunings, 19TET being the most<br>    common, but various forms of Just Intonation being a close<br>    second.<br>4.  It also has a wide gamut of ... how do I phrase this? ...<br>    flagrancy of microtonality.  Some used microtonality to provide<br>    a distinctive coloring, and others used it to produce a completely<br>    alien musical experience.  I suspect that Stephen James Taylor's<br>    contribution is the most flagrantly microtonal (as my boss would<br>    say, "yeeehah!"), but a couple others were very close behind<br>    him.<br><br>   In addition to once again thanking Neil for his efforts in putting this<br>together, I'd also like to thank and congratulate the contributors:<br>Stephen James Taylor, Warren Burt, John Starrett, Bill Sethares, Neil<br>Haverstick, John Loffink, Richard Sanford, Denny Genovese, Ernie Crews,<br>Bill Alves, Carter Scholz, and ... (hmmm, is it proper to congratulate<br>yourself?).<br><br>   And I'd also like to thank the list-masters at Mills College for putting<br>us all together!<br><br>   So, I'll go ahead and break the ice:  $10 a copy, including postage.<br>I'm at 13036 Staton Drive; Austin, TX 78727-4513; USA.  Please send only US<br>funds, no credit cards, and all that rot.<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1547<br>*************************</div>
