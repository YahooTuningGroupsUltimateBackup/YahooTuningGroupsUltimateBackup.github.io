I sometimes<br>wonder in a case like this: is the argument not compelling, or am I a poor<br>communicator (since I don't feel that writing is my forte)?  Elitism?  I<br>think many of us have different definitions for that word.  And as for "I<br>feel it's safe to say": I am living proof, over the last few weeks, that it<br>is rarely *safe* to say.  Anyone remember Sir Larry Olivier in "Marathon<br>Man" asking Dustin Hoffman: "Is it safe?".<br><br>=====<br><br>- Enrique - Great analysis; you managed to whittle down to some of the<br>essences. I would only make these brief responses...<br><br>1) Optimally, yes.<br>2) Yes, by induction.<br>3)<br>a) I don't think I have talked much about recordings. I believe they serve<br>as documentation, therefore if they document a dilution of Partch (read:<br>transcription), then they document that dilution; if they document a valid<br>performance, then they do just that, but are a poor substitute for a live<br>performance.<br>b) Yes.<br>c) Certainly.<br>d) In league with a).<br>e) I haven't ruled this out, have I?  When I win the next California Lotto,<br>I will personally fund as many duplicate Ensembles as I can.<br>4. Key phrase you use: "as the composer intended", which to me is of<br>paramount importance. A true sense?  Probably, with recordings and videos<br>giving but a taste of the total picture.<br>5. The $64,000 question...  I just *know* that somewhere, someone is<br>thinking that I am the Dr. Kevorkian of Partchiana.  In my youth, I espoused<br>a truly non-committal view of this.  I am pondering alternatives, though<br>none have cropped up just yet (see Lotto reference).<br>6. What about the fumes? Partch repair-persons getting high on the job,<br>having kids with 7 arms (makes playing those wicked Chromelodeon parts<br>easier...) -- where will it all end?  (Is the 'plastics' another reference<br>to Dustin Hoffman, in "The Graduate"?)<br><br>Thanks for making me feel totally inadequate, posting in from CCRMA <g>!<br><br>=====<br><br>- Bruce - Interesting thoughts on the recordings/transcriptions idea.  The<br>kicker was your last "won't solve the corporeality problem"; that does it<br>for me.  I would like to see the entire body of work represented in<br>documentary form (i.e. recording, video, etc.) in terms of preservation.  It<br>would certainly allow knowledgable listeners the choice - "Ain't nothing<br>like the real thing, baby...".  (Man, we have *got* to get Sony to<br>re-release the 2 Columbia albums)  Thanks for your thoughts on visiting the<br>instruments at SDSU.  This was the atmosphere that most anyone felt during<br>their time out here in San Diego <s>.  And what synth version of "Yankee"?<br><br>=====<br><br>Thanks, all.  Education, online...<br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br>*--------------------------------------------------------------------*<br>   Jonathan M.

This very<br>entertaining and informative flame-war between Jon and Johnny is starting to<br>crowd out discussions of the subject in general.  Certainly Harry himself<br>would say that he's not the first person who ever did tuning, merely<br>following a very ancient and venerable tradition.<br><br>He's certainly not the last either.  This almost religious concern about<br>what Harry might or might not have wanted is fine for people wanting to<br>reproduce and sustain the body of work created by this amazing person.<br>However, what about living people making Just and N-ET music?   What about<br>current tuning theory and musical applications of same?  Who is Partch's<br>heir?   I guess in a sense we are.  I'd be curious to hear about where<br>Partch's theories have been taken and if any extensions have been made to<br>them, or any new music has been made using them.  Other Music is one group<br>that comes to mind.  Newband is another.</div><h3><a id=3471 href="#3471">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/1996 10:16:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I would think that Chris Forster would be one of several good candidates for<br>an heir to Partch's traditions.  Although his work is perhaps not all that<br>famous, Chris built upon Partch's ideas in terms of sounds (both with regard to<br>tuning and not), and their visual impact as well.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 27 Aug 1996 10:28 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA31974; Tue, 27 Aug 1996 10:29:55 +0200<br>Received: from sun4nl.NL.net by ns (smtpxd); id XA31916<br>Received: from [144.91.3.20] by sun4nl.NL.net with SMTP<br>	id AA14816 (5.65b/CWI-3.3); Mon, 26 Aug 1996 18:26:12 +0200<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA27828; Mon, 26 Aug 1996 09:25:39 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 26 Aug 1996 09:25:39 -0700<br>Message-Id: <60960826162206/0005695065PK5EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
