In so doing they fail to<br>understand that in music one crack in the dike is enough to flood the<br>village fifty feet deep beneath our old enemy, the sea.<br><br>For as soon as our unfortunate too-perfectly-skilled singer (or<br>instrumentalist) reaches that movable tone (and this quite apart from<br>any question of modulation or musical style), all hell breaks loose.<br>Entirely new notes are needed, and then still more, which do not fit<br>into the old tonal fabric. This is not the momentary tension of<br>modulation, but the creaking sound of the ocean liner before it splits<br>in two. That a handful of presumptuous people aggressively declare that<br>they love this sound, and are able to make great masterpieces with it,<br>is as may be ? but so far they have made no masterpieces, but only<br>curiosities wholly irrelevant to music as an art.<br><br>All these difficulties were completely and intimately known to the<br>musicians and theorists of 400 years ago. It was also known long before<br>to musicians, but the theorists, in the grip of their worship of one<br>particular Greek school of theory, the Pythagorean, preferred to pretend<br>no difficulty existed. Quite strained arguments have been made to the<br>effect that the ancients universally defined even the thirds as<br>dissonant - hence the hopeful attempts of a long series of Western<br>theorists to gradually extend the number of consonances to include the<br>septimals. But this is definitely true only for the Pythagorean<br>tradition, not for Greek musical theory as a whole, whose conclusions<br>are largely lost to us. Pythagorean intonation is simply a variety of<br>just intonation in which the fifth/fourth cycle is alone used, resulting<br>in difficulties just as excruciating as those of the true just<br>intonation, although of a different kind. To pretend that a singer can<br>accurately produce an interval four or five perfect fifths above the<br>tonic is nonsense; this is a commatic disjunct dissonance, and not<br>accurately singable.<br><br>These matters are widely known ? they are also widely ignored or denied<br>or imperfectly known. The ignorant very typically imagine that We Clever<br>Moderns have invented a new music in which all the Stupid Old Ideas of<br>the dead past don't matter. Every generation thinks like this ? and<br>every generation is wrong. The poor, itinerant singers ? many of them<br>great geniuses of a kind that are largely absent from our academies ? to<br>whom our people deliberately go listen, know little of temperament. But<br>their profession prevents them from falling into the excesses of the<br>just intonationists, who imagine that some clever new mathematics will<br>somehow find a way to eliminate the necessity of tempering, or permit us<br>to use with success some temperament even more self-inconsistent than<br>just intonation itself. But the best mathematical minds in Europe once<br>busied themselves very largely ? I almost said 'primarily' ? with<br>escaping from temperament, and never found a way. Popular singers are<br>also preserved from the extravagances of the academics who cultivate<br>such monstrosities as 22- 29- or 41-tone equal, which merely reproduce<br>the worst deformities of just intonation, with very few of its benefits.<br><br>The irony is that just intonation itself is considerably poorer in<br>usable melodic resources than the 19-tone equal, of which matter I omit<br>to treat again here.<br><br>Now an important consequence of the observation that a singer who uses<br>absolutely pure intervals involves himself in fearsome practical<br>difficulties, is that singers do indeed temper intervals. But how?<br><br>I have presented evidence to suggest that the seven consonances and<br>twelve tonal dissonances form a tonal fabric to which 19-tone equal<br>temperament corresponds far more closely than any other intonational<br>system. The 19-tone equal intervals are with _no_ exceptions very close<br>to the 19 melodic pitch classes into which just intonation tends to<br>resolve. I am not alone in this opinion.<br><br>This by the way, is _not_ a circular argument, which I anticipate<br>someone will suspect it to be ? and should so suspect as a matter of<br>normal skepticism. The 19 just intervals were not invented or chosen<br>arbitrarily in order to favor the 19-tone equal; they follow ineluctably<br>from the consonances, and from the nature of singers' ability to sing<br>dissonances vis-?-vis the tonic. I was dumbfounded when I first noticed<br>this correspondance; I expected that 31-tone equal would offer a better<br>correspondance; but this is not the case. 31-tone equal corresponds<br>better to the atonal dissonances, but much less well to the tonal ones.<br><br>Another possible source of circularity in my arguments might be supposed<br>to be the choice of melodic limen of circa 60 cents, which is quite near<br>the 19-tone equal tuning degree. But in fact a melodic limen as narrow<br>as circa 50 cents or as wide as circa 70 cents, still results in much<br>the same melodic pitch classes when applied to the 19 just intervals.<br><br>Finally, it is to be noted that even if onesuppose the atonal<br>dissonances to be perceptibly part of the tonal fabric, which I doubt,<br>they are melodically confused with the tonal dissonances, and more<br>objectionably yet, with the consonances.<br><br>I have also remarked that all microtonal systems other than 19-tone<br>equal tend to reduce to about 12 melodic pitch classes in the octave.<br>This may well help to explain why the 12-tone equal, which was known for<br>centuries by our ancestors, but nearly always rejected by them with the<br>most sovereign contempt, has achieved such a peculiar destiny. It is<br>that intonational system toward which ignorance and error converge; it<br>is that system which a random choice of tuning, in violation of the<br>canons of just intonation and the human voice, and therefore in<br>violation of the musical understanding, must finally produce.<br><br>Error is manifold, truth one. This is not a statement that arises from<br>religio-dogmatical habits of thought, but from science, which usually<br>supplies many incorrect conclusions, but only one correct answer, or<br>group of answers.<br><br>The 19-tone equal temperament is the only closed, fully cyclic system<br>toward which just intonation, in its practically audible aspect, tends;<br>it is therefore the only correct system.<br><br>Having now given sufficient information to, at the least, propel the<br>open-minded to a close examination of the 19-tone equal temperament,<br>having also perhaps discouraged a few frivolous triflers from disgracing<br>the 19-tone equal temperament by any use of it, and finally, having<br>communicated my discovery of the octave stretch (which noticeably<br>improves the harmony of this temperament,) I shall abate very<br>considerably the frequency of my postings, not wishing to interfere with<br>the learned debates of others, and unwilling to devote too much of my<br>time, which is to me very precious, to correcting vulgar errors or<br>trivial disapprobations.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Robert C Valentine <bval@iil.intel.com><br>Subject:  Re: 19, 22, 29, etc...<br>PostedDate:  24-12-97 08:29:11<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  24-12-97 08:27:02-24-12-97 08:27:02,24-12-97 08:26:32-24-12-97 08:26:32<br>DeliveredDate:  24-12-97 08:26:32<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256577.0028E9AC; Wed, 24 Dec 1997 08:28:49 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA24941; Wed, 24 Dec 1997 08:29:11 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 24 Dec 1997 08:29:11 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA24802<br>Received: (qmail 5224 invoked from network); 23 Dec 1997 23:29:09 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 23 Dec 1997 23:29:09 -0800<br>Message-Id: <9712240725.AA85822@ilx170.iil.intel.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
