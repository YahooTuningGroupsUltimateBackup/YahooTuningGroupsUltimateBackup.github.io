On a standard C<br>instument, the draw chord is G9th and when you play that F as part of the C<br>major scale, most ears seem to percieve it as "out of tune". Moving to the<br>key of Dm makes matters even worse. In G, the 7/4 is not so bad melodically,<br>but in blues playing, there is a tendency to sharpen flat seventh, so the<br>7/4, whilst not sounding quite so "out of tune", can still sound a little<br>uninteresting. I have tried using a seventh of 9/5 and it can dramatically<br>enhance the bluesiness, but sounds rough as hell as part of the 7th chord<br>(however, on the minor tuned harp as part of a m9th chord, 9/5 sounds very<br>strong indeed). My usual compromise (and a compromise it most definitely is)<br>is to use 16/9 or (horror of horrors!) 1000c. Just out of interest, does<br>anyone out there know which seventh is used on a melodeon (diatonic accordion)?<br><br>.and come to think of it, what about the 57th and 29th harmonics? Or maybe<br>even the 59th - this might make a very bluesy seventh?<br><br><br>Pat Missin  -  patm@globalnet.co.uk<br><br>"...my music's a lot better than it sounds!"
