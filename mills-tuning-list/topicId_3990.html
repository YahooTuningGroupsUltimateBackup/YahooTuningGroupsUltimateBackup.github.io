That since, as I mentioned, the first few claims of most patents are<br>admittedly undefendable, and included just to define terminology for the<br>claims they really do expect to be able to use.<br><br>   For example, their first few claims might claim the idea of a keyboard<br>(obviously undefendable, but included to define terms), the next few a<br>Bosanquet keyboard (also undefendable), and the last one or two to define a<br>particular electronic or mechanical mechanism (probably defendable, the idea<br>they really wanted to "protect", and probably not a really big deal for us).<br><br>   Of course I haven't seen the patent yet, so perhaps that's nothing like<br>the situation.<br><br>   Unfortunately, I doubt if there's much we can do about a patent already<br>issued, except to "invite" Yamaha to sue you over it.  As far as I know<br>anyway, once the PTO issues a patent, only the courts can throw it out.  Or<br>has it not been issued yet?<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1528<br>*************************</div>
