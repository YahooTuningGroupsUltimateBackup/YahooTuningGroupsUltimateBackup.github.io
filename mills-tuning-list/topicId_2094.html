The recent works of Alvin Lucier for various combinations of<br>voices, instruments, and oscillators are good examples. If you have any<br>doubt about the viability of beats being heard in a musical context, thenLucier's _In Memoriam, Jon Higgins_ for clarinet and oscillator should<br>definitely be heard. I am particularly fond of his _Navigations for<br>Strings_, where a four note cell within the space of a minor third is<br>gradually - via microtonal deviations notated in cents - diminished to a<br>unison, and although the attacks of the individual stringed instruments are<br>steady, the beating rate makes a gracious ritardando over some sixteen<br>minutes. Many on the list are probably familiar with Jim Tenney's _Critical<br>Band_, which begins with tones related as harmonics within the critical<br>band - thus producing beats - and broadens outside of the band to represent<br>lower harmonic ratios. In contrast to the Lucier, the acoustical beats are<br>gradually drowned out by the pulse of the players' attacks.<br><br>It is quite possible that beats between ''mistuned'' unisons are used in<br>Balinese music more as an aspect of musical rhythm and timbre rather thanas pitch. Some gamelan (especially gender wayang) have such steady beating<br>patterns throughout the instrumentation that the beats could practically be<br>used as a metronome.<br><br>An interesting use of difference tones may be found in Richard Maxfield'slandmark tape piece _Night Music_, which is composed entirely of difference<br>tones between an oscillator and the erase head of the recorder. The old<br>Stockhausen and David Tudor favorite, ring modulation, yields both sum and<br>difference tones. (I am not a Stockhausen enthusiast by any means, but his<br>use of ring modulation in _Mantra_ creates tonal relationship which are<br>quite easy for a listener to comprehend). La Monte Young's _Two Systems..._<br>describes a theory of harmonic controls based entirely upon avoiding<br>particular constellations of sums or differences. Walter Zimmermann has awonderful piece for two clarinets which play loud dyads with first order<br>difference tones derived from Franconian folk dances.<br><br>I think that the successful incorporation of beats and combinations tonesinto music like this illustrates well how by subtly changing the context in<br>which music is presented, non-traditional materials can be perceptably<br>integrated into a work of music. I am convinced that we know almost nothing<br>about the limits of our perceptual faculties and new forms of conditioning,<br>new ways of presentation and new technologies can extend those faculties<br>dramatically. This is the fundamental reason why I am always ready to<br>challenge compositional or analytical theories derived from psychophysical<br>research which is based upon narrow, culturally defined conditions.
