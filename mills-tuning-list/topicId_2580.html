As Fourier showed, any periodic<br>motion can be expressed as a sum of sine and cosine components at<br>frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental. Of course,<br>the note would have to last an infinitely long time for this to work,<br>since the sine and cosine functions are defined from minus infinity to<br>infinity. But for the purpose of distinguishing between harmonic and<br>inharmonic sounds, it is useful (necessary, in fact, for an unambiguous<br>analysis) to treat the sounds as lasting an infinitely long time.<br><br>Another popular misconception is that brass instruments are inharmonic<br>because its resonant frequencies are not a perfect overtone series. It<br>is true that the sound produced by slapping the mouthpiece of a brass<br>instrument is slighly inharmonic. But normally, the player's lips are<br>the driving mechanism and the instrument merely determines which<br>components of the lip vibration are amplified more and which are<br>amplified less. The lips vibrate due to the Bernoulli effect, so given a<br>constant tension and airflow, their motion will be exactly periodic, and<br>thus the overtones will form a perfect harmonic series.<br><br>You can't always believe what the "Physics for Dummies" books tell you;<br>in fact, it was only shortly before receiving my B.S. in Physics from<br>Yale that many of my own misconceptions about acoustics were dispelled.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
