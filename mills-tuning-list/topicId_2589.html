(A<br>simple approximation to this is given below).<br><br>(2) Given two sounds F and G, one with partials at frequencies f1, f2,<br>f3, f4, etc and the other with partials at frequencies g1, g2, g3, g4,<br>etc. Define the sensory dissonance between F and G to be the sum of<br>all the dissonances between all the sine wave partials, weighted by<br>the relative amplitudes of the partials.<br><br>Suppose two sine waves are at frequencies f and g. The data<br>gathered by Plomp and Levelt can be parameterized as the<br>difference between two exponentials<br><br>                      exp(-a |f-g|) - exp(-b |f-g|)<br><br>where a and b are constants.
