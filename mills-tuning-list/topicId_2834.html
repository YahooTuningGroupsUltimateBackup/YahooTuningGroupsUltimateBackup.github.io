This is as far as the most charitable informed person can go in<br>> the way of an open mind."<br><br>Paul Rapaport said:<br>> Most of us are fairly polite in this forum, so I will continue in that<br>> manner. Some people should seriously admit that their presumptions are<br>> nothing more than that. It is (to put it mildly) perverse to imply that<br>> one system invalidates all others. This may of course come from the<br>> equally damaging view that accepting any other system invalidates one's<br>> own. At least the writer shows impeccable logic on this one point.<br>><br>> One of the many poor results of such behaviour is that we tend to write<br>> off everything said by such people as nonsense. In the present case that<br>> would be unfortunate indeed.<br>><br>> With few exceptions, this is not the way this forum has advanced over the<br>> several years of its existence, for good reason.<br>><br>> Having stirred up the pot in this manner, I will now put the lid back on,<br>> turn down the heat, and leave the room.<br><br>This is nonsense. The gentleman to whom I was addressing the remark to<br>which you take exception, has adopted an insolent tone from start to<br>finish, in which tone I have never replied to him (until now), even<br>under the most direct provocation, for he does seem to know enough to<br>contribute something. It is no insult to anyone to say a particular<br>system is of little value to music. If this tuning list is nothing more<br>than a mutual admiration society for various kinds of musico-academic<br>hangers-on, designed to rope in the unwary to the idle joys of any one<br>of a number of very dubious tuning systems, it is a fraud, and the<br>progress to which you refer, nothing more than an aimless, desultory<br>meandering.<br><br>I thank you for your kind remarks concerning my posts. I hope that I<br>have provided people with a few new ideas of interest. My other<br>responsibilities will soon greatly curtail my posts, I fear, so these<br>few individuals who find themselves mortally offended by every other<br>thing I say, will soon be left to nurse their 20-tone equal babies in<br>peace.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Reply to Paul Ehrlich<br>PostedDate:  18-12-97 15:35:37<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  18-12-97 15:33:26-18-12-97 15:33:27,18-12-97 15:33:03-18-12-97 15:33:04<br>DeliveredDate:  18-12-97 15:33:04<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256571.004FF704; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 15:35:22 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA26401; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 15:35:37 +0100<br>Date: Thu, 18 Dec 1997 15:35:37 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA26391<br>Received: (qmail 17262 invoked from network); 18 Dec 1997 06:35:33 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 18 Dec 1997 06:35:33 -0800<br>Message-Id: <34999678.1F1D@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6721 href="#6721">ðŸ”—</a>Johnny Reinhard &#x3C;reinhard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/1997 10:12:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Re Joel Mandelbaum: we just premiered his _Ten Studies in 31-tone<br>Temperament, Variations on a Textural Theme by A.D.
