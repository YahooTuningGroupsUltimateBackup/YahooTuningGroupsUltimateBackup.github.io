The 'flat' seventh really puts the chord its "cool" or<br>"relaxed" context.<br>Playing a 16/9 on top of a jazz chord just kills the feeling. But, some jazz<br>uses 5-limit 7th chords, and classical music uses it all the time (almost by<br>definition.)<br><br>        The 16/9 in the classical seventh chords (1 5/4 3/2 16/9 or sometimes<br>3/4 16/9 2/1 ) gives a very serious, or conventional, feel to the music.<br>This afternoon, I realised how much this conventional effect, this expected<br>effect is important.<br><br>        I was playing the last stranza of the aida march in the key of F<br>major. Here it is in GWBasic notation with the chords on top : (is there a<br>better name for this kind of notation?) I separated in bars, the first one<br>starting on the second beat. <br><br>Tempo : approx 60bpm for the quarternote<br><br>        Cm              F7              G7                      C<br>    G   G.G8    >C.C8   EbD     C<A     GA12G12F12      ED      C1<br><br>        The Eb in the first F7 bar is the climax of the phrase. I was using<br>a new trumpet today, a Jerome Callet Soloist. I hadn't tested the intonation<br>of the horn before playing. When I played the high Eb, using the 5th<br>harmonic and 2nd valve pressed, (theorically 5/4 of C, minus 100cents) when<br>I played this, the trumpet played the 7/4 of F!!!! Believe me, a note 36/35<br>lower then the classical 16/9 sound REALLY WEIRD!!!!!! The note was a full<br>quartertone off! I will be traumatised for a few days. This note sounded<br>really wrong.<br><br>I would like to have everyone's feedback:<br>What is your opinion on sevenths? What is the difference between 16/9 and<br>9/5? (I you tell me that the difference is a comma, I will have to kill you.<br>What I want to know is when to use the two different intervals.)<br><br>-Kami<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 25 Aug 1996 07:15 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA31415; Sun, 25 Aug 1996 07:16:21 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA31361<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA17888; Sat, 24 Aug 1996 22:16:20 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 24 Aug 1996 22:16:20 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960825051025_71670.2576_HHB48-11@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3483 href="#3483">ðŸ”—</a>PAULE &#x3C;ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/1996 3:53:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Kami asked,<br><br>>What is the difference between 16/9 and<br>>9/5? (I you tell me that the difference is a comma, I will have to kill <br>you.<br>>What I want to know is when to use the two different intervals.)<br><br>16/9 is a pythagorean minor seventh, and is a good choice for pythagorean <br>chords like<br>C Eb F Bb or C F G Bb, or a classical sounding dominant seventh chord (C E G <br>Bb). 9/5 is better for a minor seventh chord (C Eb G Bb). Two <br>consonant-sounding half-diminished seventh chords are 4/7 2/3 4/5 1/1 (can <br>be the II chord in minor) and 5/4 3/2 7/4 9/4 (can be the VII chord in <br>major), where the second chord has a 9/5 minor seventh.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 29 Aug 1996 01:24 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04178; Thu, 29 Aug 1996 01:25:22 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04072<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id QAA17540; Wed, 28 Aug 1996 16:25:20 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 28 Aug 1996 16:25:20 -0700<br>Message-Id: <84960828232348/0005695065PK3EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
