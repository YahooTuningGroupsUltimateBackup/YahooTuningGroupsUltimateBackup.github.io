He told Reinhard that his recent performance of Ive's Universe<br>Symphony "blew my shorts off". In a related story, Fender Guitars held a<br>press conference, and their spokesman John "Bo" Nerr said that they were<br>forced to end production of 12 tone eq guitars "ever since Neil Haverstick hit it so big with that 19 tone<br>crap"...at least 15,000 orders had been taken for guitars in non 12/eq<br>tunings. And, it has recently been discovered that Martian musicians<br>had a scale with 153,123 notes to the octave. Supposedly, Martian<br>musicians claim that the scale was "brought by the Old Ones".<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 9 Jun 1996 07:38 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA27623; Sat, 8 Jun 1996 22:38:40 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 8 Jun 1996 22:38:40 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960609013759_322629587@emout13.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
