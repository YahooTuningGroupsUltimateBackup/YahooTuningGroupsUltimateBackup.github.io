Consider the following intervals:<br><br>(etc.)<br><br>Erlich is right that you are not going to pick the 'threeness' out of .1<br>cents stops between a moving and a fixed sine wave. 'Threeness' is going =<br>to<br>have to be heard contextually, that is, an 81/64 will be heard as a 3/2<br>above a pitch understood, again contextually, to be 27/16 above a known<br>tonic.<br><br>I happen to find it easier to hear the 'nineness' in an 81/64. Against a<br>drone, I sing up a 9/8 major second and then singing either a 10/9 or 9/8=<br><br>above this tone is quite easy.<br><br>Following the long duration work of La Monte Young and my own installatio=<br>ns<br>with massive clusters of pitches related in frequency as pries, I am<br>increasingly convinced that perception of higher-prime relationships is<br>possible but that (a) the conditions of presentation must differ<br>qualitatively and quantitatively from conventional concert music<br>situations, and (b) the physiologically means of perception is either a<br>radical extension of the standard listening mechanism or an altogether<br>alternative mechanism, perhaps spatial.<br><br>One example. An installation that I made for the Kunsthalle Zug, in<br>Switzerland, used ratios involving prime numbers below 1024 in clusters o=<br>f<br>up to 20 tones. As insurance against a failure by my Rayna synthesizer, I=<br><br>made several DAT recordings at different sampling rates, all of which had=<br><br>increased beating when compared with the original. To get around this, I<br>retuned the original to the 'key' of the DAT sampling rate, and the<br>excessive beating disappeared. Although the sampling rate of the DAT was =<br>-<br>according to all standard theory - adequate to perception, all of the sta=<br>ff<br>members of the Kunsthalle could immediately discriminate between the<br>original Rayna version and the DAT sampling. Clearly, although we were no=<br>t<br>dealing with a traditional music-functional distinction - as found betwee=<br>n<br>ratios of 3 and 5 - the distinctions between these higher prime identitie=<br>s<br>were articulated in the installation.  =<br><br><br><br><br><br> =</div><h3><a id=8832 href="#8832">ðŸ”—</a>siforte@ix.netcom.com (Sanford Forte)</h3><span>11/16/1998 8:40:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>For you Mac users.<br><br>Check out www.metasynth.com (and then follow links to U&I Software for<br>someinteresting news about powerful tuning enhancements to this already vry<br>cool software package.<br><br>I'm in no way connected to either company, but this software is really<br>quite nice.<br><br><br><br><br>Sanford Forte<br>Interactive Development Systems<br>Palo Alto, CA<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1584<br>*************************</div>
