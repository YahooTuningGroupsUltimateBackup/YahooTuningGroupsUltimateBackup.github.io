Here's the abstract:<br><br>***************************<br><br><br>Perception-Based Audio Processing<br><br>At the intersection of signal processing, music, and psychology lies<br>perception-based audio processing, which investigates the<br>relationships between the structure of sounds, the structure of music,<br>and the underlying biological/perceptual aspects of the human<br>auditory system.<br><br>The talk begins by showing how to build a device that can measure<br>the "sensory" consonance and/or dissonance of a sound in its musical<br>context. As shown in my recent book "Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum,<br>Scale", such a "dissonance meter" has implications in music theory, in<br>synthesizer design, in the construction of musical scales and tunings,<br>and in the design of musical instruments.<br><br>Two issues are discussed in detail:<br>  (a) Given a sound, what is the scale in which it can be played<br>most consonantly?<br>  (b) Given a scale, how can sounds be constructed which will appear<br>most consonant in that scale?<br><br>Sound examples and musical excerpts are presented throughout,<br>and both the strengths and limitations of the method are discussed.</div>
