Increasing the number of 'partials' has<br>>no effect on the used sample RAM on the Roland or AKAI systems.<br>><br>>Patrick, it's obvious you don't understand the difference between internal<br>>program storage RAM and sample RAM.  In fact, your following comments pretty<br>>much proved what I said was right, that program parameters for "Partials" are<br>>not stored in sample RAM on Roland samplers.  Sample RAM is used to store the<br>>raw samples.  Program RAM is used to store loop points, tuning offsets,<br>>velocity response, filter parameters, tuning tables, MIDI parameters, etc.<br>>For a synthesizer, the builtin samples are stored in ROM (Read Only Memory),<br>>the builtin program parameters are probably stored in the microprocessor code<br>>ROM, and the user programs (no samples) are stored in battery backed RAM.<br>><br>>More 'partials' does not mean more RAM;  on the Roland<br>>(at least) only samples take up sample RAM.<br>><br>>See my response above.<br>><br>John Loffink<br>john.loffink@compaq.com<br><br>><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
