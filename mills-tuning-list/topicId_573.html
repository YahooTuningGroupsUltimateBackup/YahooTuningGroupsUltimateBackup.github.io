Do they generally use<br>>the dominant 7th as V7 of the key, as opposed to jazz harmony which uses<br>>it as a sound color that can occur almost anywhere, functionally?<br><br>The Barbershop style is jazz.  It uses both otonal and utonal (tho mostly<br>otonal) 4-5-6-7 chords functionally.  These chords, along with chords like<br>the 12-14-18-21, form the basic consonances of this music.  They are built<br>on every beat of the music, just like major and minor triads are built on<br>every beat of a Bach chorale.<br><br>The V7 chord is usually tuned with the harmonic seventh, as opposed to the<br>16/9 or 9/5 sevenths.  But the music modulates widely (it is composed in<br>12TET, with all the effects of that tuning assumed) and lots of things<br>happen throughout the 5 and 7 limits.<br><br>By far the best example I have found of this music is Nitelife's Basin<br>Street Blues album, available at...<br><br>http://www.harmonize.com/nightlife/record02.htm<br><br><br>>The point is, given this interpretation the distance to the 4:5:6:7 is<br>>36/35, which is the septimal comma plus the syntonic comma or nearly 49<br>>cents, a significantly larger interval to swallow as a comma--though<br>>still not as big as the 648/625 I mentioned in a previous message.<br><br>Because the ear is orders of magnitude more sensitive to tuning<br>harmonically than it is to tuning melodically, huge commas can effectively<br>be swallowed by a capella quartets.<br><br>*Note.  By "sensitive to tuning", above, I mean the preference for one<br>interval over another.  How accurate can you tune a *given interval*<br>melodically vs. harmonically.  I do not mean pitch discrimination -- can<br>you tell the difference between these two tones? -- which seems to be<br>roughly the same in either case.<br><br>Carl</div>
