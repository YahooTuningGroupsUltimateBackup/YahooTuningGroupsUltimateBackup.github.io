Bach's temperament.  However, knowing Kirnberger, he<br>> would have LEPT at the chance to publically humiliate Marpurg, were<br>> Marpurg's original statement about J.S. Bach's temperament false (this<br>> would follow the pattern of their famous vituperations).  He didn't.  It is<br>> inconceivable that Kirnberger was unaware of the passage in question.<br>> That is why we can probably trust that the quote represents correct<br>> information.  This is also the reason that you should not dismiss evidence<br>> in Marpurg so quickly...<br><br>So you'd rather trust Marpurg's slanted interpretation of Kirnberger's<br>statements, even though he makes a whopping big theoretical error in it?<br>Hmmph.<br><br>The following two quotes are from _A History of Key Characteristics in<br>the Eighteenth and Early Nineteenth Centuries_, by Rita Steblin (UMI<br>Research Press, 1983), already cited once in this thread.<br><br>p.91:<br>: It is known that Marpurg's attack caused Kirnberger much bitter<br>: anguish: he poured out his vexation in a series of letters to Forkel<br>: from 1779-80.  . . . although Kirnberger did not publish a<br>: counterattack himself, he did include a defense written by the<br>: important mathematician and military officer at the Berlin court,<br>: Georg Friedrich Tempelhof (1737-1807).<br><br>p.92:<br>: Marpurg, the avowed disciple of Rameau, had drawn clear battle lines<br>: between his theories in support of equal temperament and those of<br>: Kirnberger.  Since the latter had declared that his primary intention in<br>: _Die Kunst_ was to transmit the theoretical principles of J.S. Bach,<br>: Marpurg's cruelest blow was the accusation that Kirnberger was not<br>: faithful to Bach--not faithful because, as Marpurg contended, Bach had<br>: actually taught Kirnberger to tune in equal temperament.  Marpurg then<br>: appealed to Bach's sons to substantiate him in his claim, but this ruse<br>: backfired, and Kirnberger was able to end _Die Kunst_ with the following<br>: passage taken from a letter that C.P.E. Bach had sent him:<br>: <br>:      The conduct of Herr Marpurg against you is abominable. . . . You<br>:      may proclaim that my fundamental principles and those of my late<br>:      father are anti-Rameau.<br>: <br>: In this manner Kirnberger managed to get in a final blow.  Although it<br>: is not clear whether this quotation applies specifically to unequal<br>: temperament and key characteristics, there is no reason to believe that<br>: this topic--so important in Kirnberger's writing--should be excluded<br>: from the anti-Rameauist principles espoused by the Bachs.<br><br>--pH (manynote@library.wustl.edu or http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote)<br>       O<br>      /\             "Do you like to gamble, Eddie?<br>     -\-\-- o         Gamble money on pool games?"<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 26 Sep 1995 07:31 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA01350; Mon, 25 Sep 1995 22:30:55 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 25 Sep 1995 22:30:55 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.950926002642.719B-100000@library><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
