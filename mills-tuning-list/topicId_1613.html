This portion of my meantone explanation had some incomplete<br>edits in it.  Just in case it confused anybody:  <br><br>> That combined with the fact that the total error between the third<br>> of I (the mediant) and the third of V (the leading tone) is smaller that <br>> way.  In the quarter-comma meantone case, the mediant's error is 0 and<br>the<br>> leading tone's is 1/4 comma, a total error of 1/4 comma, whereas in<br>fifth-<br>> comma meantone the mediant's is 1/5 comma, and the leading tone's is 0, a<br><br>> total of 1/5 comma.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 2 Feb 1997 18:41 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22671; Sun, 2 Feb 1997 18:41:44 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22558<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id JAA06093; Sun, 2 Feb 1997 09:35:35 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 2 Feb 1997 09:35:35 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199702021224_MC2-10AB-B184@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
