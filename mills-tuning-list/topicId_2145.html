Whilehe must have had some difficulty keeping the string instruments exactly<br>in tune, he probably came as close as humanly possible. ''<br><br><br>It's clear that we're talking about two kinds of ''mistuned''. The first is<br>simply that Partch's instruments did  go out of tune relative to how he<br>wanted them - the idiophones and strings are weather sensitive, and he<br>didn't like to retune during intermission, so pitch would drift during a<br>concert. Some of the recordings give especially bitter examples of this.<br>What Adam was referring to, however, was Partch's use of pitches that were,<br>by his own terms, non-harmonic. One example frequently used by Partch areclusters on the chromelodeon, which could be analysed theoretically as<br>harmonics of incredibly low fundamentals, but were certainly not analysedin this way by Partch and are unlikely to be heard by in this way by anyone<br>else. (The use of the ''octave'' coupler on the chromelodeon should be<br>mentioned as well). Another example is the use of ''alternative'' playingtechniques yielding pitches which Partch did not bother to analyse. My<br>favorite examples are the playing of harmonic canons from the wrong side of<br>the bridge (in Windsong/Daphne) and playing slide string instruments withthe slide placed diagonally accoss the strings. Then there are instruments<br>- like the cloud chamber bowls - whose pitch is a more subjective matter.Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 17 Jun 1997 09:39 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00829; Tue, 17 Jun 1997 09:39:27 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 17 Jun 1997 09:39:27 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00825<br>Received: (qmail 21871 invoked from network); 16 Jun 1997 09:15:07 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 16 Jun 1997 09:15:07 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199706160513_MC2-188E-C12C@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
