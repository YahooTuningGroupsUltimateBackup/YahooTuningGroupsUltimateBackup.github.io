David<br>Doty noticed that it reset the viewable page instead of incrementing the<br>pitch table number.  What it does is reset the page before the up-arrow is<br>recieved, so that you're now looking at layer 2!  I then tried a "put<br>parameter" command to the pitch table parameter, but the OS blocks changing<br>this particular parameter, so this doesn't work either.<br><br>The only way to change this parameter which will really work and let you<br>change to any of the 8 possible pitch tables is with a "put layer" command,<br>which is possible at the beginnings of sections but ugly while you're<br>playing music.  The other trouble with "put layer" is that it requires<br>handshaking, in which you send a header, the ASR sends an "OK" message and<br>then you send the data.  This probably won't work if you're typing in sysex<br>from a sequencer.<br><br>It looks like the only way to switch pitch tables on the fly is to use the<br>patch select controllers, which only allows you access to four different<br>layers, or to use patch select between different instruments.  You could<br>have eight instruments in sets of two, so that patch number 1 selects tables<br>1-4 and patch number 2 selects 5-8.  This would give you at least four<br>tracks of different sounds.  All of these solutions are a kludge and I admit<br>this was a design oversight.  We're still the only sampler on the market<br>that lets you tune all 128 keys with non-octave tunings.<br><br>regards,<br><br>Steve Curtin<br>Ensoniq Corp<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 13 Oct 1995 15:57 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id GAA00102; Fri, 13 Oct 1995 06:57:23 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 13 Oct 1995 06:57:23 -0700<br>Message-Id: <00997D0CF68692E6.4E5F@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
