I thought I knew a little<br>about tuning and it turns out I know VERY little.<br><br>I'd like some pointers to web sites, books, articles, etc. that<br>might get me up to speed on the nomenclature you're using here<br>as well as the basic premises of JI, experimental tunings, etc.<br><br>My interests in tuning are currently recreational. I'm a reed<br>player by training (clarinets, saxes, flutes) and a self-taught<br>keyboardist with a collection of synths to play with. I've done<br>quite a bit of conventional composing and arranging and up to<br>now have relied on scalar "modes" to convey various "flavors".<br>I'm also an engineer with a very inquisitive mind.<br><br>My exposure to micro-tonal music is limited to some work by<br>Wendy Carlos (on a Synclavier?) - I don't even recall the name<br>of the piece. If you could direct me to some representative<br>recordings, I'd be very grateful.<br><br>Thanks in advance,<br><br>Kevin Bowman</div>
