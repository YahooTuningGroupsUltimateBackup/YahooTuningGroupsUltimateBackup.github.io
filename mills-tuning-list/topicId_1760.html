Haverstick) wrote:<br><br>>Haverstick here...when Ray Tomes says the Universe is oscillating<br>>as a giant musical instrument, that must be what the Book Of The Hopi<br>>means when it says "The Universe quivered in tune;" what the Indians<br>>(East) mean by the OM vibration; what the Bible means when it says<br>>"The Word was God." I am, unfortunately, not much on math, but I do<br>>believe it is possible to unlock some of the secrets of this Universal<br>>instrument by intuitive means, by "ear," so to speak, by trying to<br>>"tune in" to the absolutely zillions and zillions of vibrations that<br>>form this rather large instrument that we live in. I'm glad other folks<br>>are interested in this same phenomenon...Hstick<br><br>The bible has both "in the beginning was the word" and also "let there<br>be light".  If the substance of the universe, the aether, is taken as a<br>medium then the speed of sound in the aether is what we know as light<br>The aether is very high tensile stuff).  So these two statements are in<br>agreement.<br><br>It is true as Neil says that ancient knowledge and religions are all<br>similar in describing the universe.  Pythagoras (who is, I suppose, the<br>patron saint of tuning) of course also described things in greater depth<br>in the same way.  While we may see the ancient knowledge as poetic<br>rather than scientific, my research has turned out to be mainly<br>rediscovery as I have realised that lots of the stuff has been known<br>before.  Even the numbers that I get for the strongest harmonics, ...<br>144, 288, 1440, 2880, 8640, 17280, 34560 ... are to be found in ancient<br>religious documents, often with a few extra noughts on.  The bible has<br>144,000 and the Vedic literature is full of these numbers.<br>The only thing is that people have forgotten what they mean.<br><br>The three most important harmonic relationships are those involving 2, 3<br>and 5.  When we include one, two or three of these we can view the most<br>important ratios as follows...<br><br>A. We know 2 as the octave and it is so important that we call different<br>notes at a ratio of 2 by the same name.<br><br>B. According to the harmonics theory, the primes 2 and 3 like to occur<br>with a relative commonness (I avoid frequency as ambiguous) of 2.38 to 1<br>and so this is most nearly approximated by the numbers 12 and 24 which<br>have 2 or 3 "2"s present for 1 "3".  Again, 288 has a near correct<br>proportion.  Therefore these ratios should be important in both time and<br>space.<br><br>C. When 5 is also added the ideal proportion happens most nearly for <br>2^8 * 3^3 * 5^1 or 34560 although 2880 is also important.  These results<br>are all 100% mathematical and based soley on that tiny basic program I<br>posted.<br><br>If we look at the universe what do we find?  Starting from the largest<br>scale, the observable universe is about 10 billion light years in<br>radius.  Division of this by 34560 repeatedly gives us the following<br>values for distances ...<br><br>Table of ratios of 34560 from the Observable Universe<br><br>N	10^28 cm    	Feature 	Common Units<br>   / 34560^N<br><br>0	1*10^28 cm  	Universe	10^10 light years<br>1	2.9*10^23 cm	Galaxies	3*10^5 light years<br>2	8.8*10^18 cm	Stars		8.9 light years<br>3	2.4*10^14 cm	Planets		16 a. u.<br>4	7.0*10^9 cm 	Moons		70,000 km<br>5	2.0*10^5 cm 	X?			2 km<br>6	5.9 cm      	Y?			5.9 cm<br>7	1.7*10^-4 cm	Cells		1.7 microns	<br>8	4.9*10^-9 cm	Atoms		0.49 Angstrom<br>9	1.4*10^-13 cm	Nucleons	1.4 fm<br>10	4.0*10^-18 cm   Quarks<br><br>What we find is that the observed structures do match the scales<br>predicted.  We see the universe as galaxies, stars, planets... and atoms<br>and particles.  The predicted values for the atom and nucleon are quite<br>accurate as the observed Bohr radius is 0.53 angstrom and the observed<br>nucleon radius is 1.3 fm.  The X and Y scales are not so noticable.<br>However there are some anomolous phenomena at these scales (or slightly<br>smaller, about 1.7 km/1 mile and 5 cm/2 inches).<br><br>Quark size has not yet been established but is less than 10^-17 cm and<br>so they are almost to the next level that I predict.<br><br>Also, within each level there are expected to be multiple sublevels at<br>ratios of mostly 12 or 24 but sometimes 20 or 28.  This is also<br>observed.  Above galaxies we have the weker level of galactic clusters<br>and small irregular galaxies are found at distances of 1/12 of the large<br>spirals (these are the small hangers on to the andromeda galaxy and out<br>own magellanic clouds that look so nice in our southern skies).<br><br>Again, planets come in two sizes and distance scales.  The gas giants<br>are at distances which are ~28 times greater than the terrestrial type<br>planets from the sun.  The distances of the outer planets are very<br>nearly in the proportion 1:2:4:6:8 and so includes quite a few ratios of<br>2 as well.<br><br>There are further examples also.<br><br>-- Ray Tomes -- rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz -- Harmonics Theory --<br>http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 4 Mar 1997 08:08 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03785; Tue, 4 Mar 1997 08:08:58 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03762<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id XAA28938; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 23:07:27 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 3 Mar 1997 23:07:27 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.43230@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5020 href="#5020">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MorriSonics@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/1997 8:50:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>-------------------- Begin Original Message --------------------<br><br>Message text written by INTERNET:tuning@ella.mills.edu<br><br>" If the substance of the universe, the aether, is taken as a<br>medium then the speed of sound in the aether is what we know as light<br>The aether is very high tensile stuff).
