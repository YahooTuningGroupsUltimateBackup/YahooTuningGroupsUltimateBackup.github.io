This  may be because of sample looping (could<br>>  someone explain this, please?), phase shifting vibrato or a bug in<br>>  my program.<br><br>It's hard to say without hearing it myself, but my best guess is that the<br>problem is distortion being made more audible by the greater purity of the JI<br>chord waveform.  The purer (more nearly periodic) a waveform is, the higher<br>quality the reproduction gear must be to handle it without audible artifacts.<br> This is especially true in the digital audio realm, where the problem may be<br>related to poor software programming or low-quality Digital-to-Analog<br>converters (most likely clock jitter, a complicated and expensive subject).<br> Nevertheless, the problem could be occuring in one of the amplifiers,<br>speakers, poor connections between them or any combination thereof.  Any<br>non-linearity in the system will cause overtones, some of which may be<br>non-harmonic.  The more purely harmonic the source audio is, the more the<br>non-harmonic overtones will stand out.<br><br>In addition, JI chords tend to be higher amplitude (by both peak and RMS<br>measurements) than others because the peaks of the individual note waveforms<br>line up periodically and sum together.  Digital or analog distortion could be<br>caused this way, or both.  If you can lower the volume of the individual<br>notes early enough in the process, particularly within the program itself,<br>you may be able to solve the problem.<br><br>Sample looping as the problem would be a long shot if all major chords sound<br>better with one tuning than another.  I'll send you a personal note on that<br>since it leaves the realm of the tuning list a little too much.<br><br>David J.
