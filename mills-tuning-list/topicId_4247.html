There is first the matter of what, in fact were the <br>true feelings of those indians.  Bill Alvez took the <br>view, which I still share, that their reaction was positive.  <br>On the other hand Neil Haverstick suggested that <br>the missionary had mistaken their loud drumming for an <br>enthusiastic response while actually they had not <br>liked the sound of his piano playing and were drumming so <br>loudly not out of musical inspiration whetted by <br>the missionary's work, but rather to drown out sounds which <br>they were finding most disagreeable and didn't want to hear.  <br>Judith Conrad, who wrote what seemed to be a somewhat <br>detailed account, indicated that it was her <br>assumption that the indians were trying to drown out the <br>awful sound of the missionary's piano playing. <br><br>	My post was a pure speculation as I had not known anything <br>of the missionary's account before reading <br>her post.  It could be that there are other indications in the <br>book of the missionary's insensitivity to how <br>others were reacting, etc. which would support the <br>interpretation that the indians really didn't appreciate <br>the missionary's efforts. <br><br>	Judith wrote: "He would have the native singers sing him <br>their favorite songs, and then he would figure out how to <br>'harmonise them properly'".  It would seem to me that this <br>process would have required some time <br>and effort on the part both of the singers and of the <br>missionary.  Thinking about it, I would imagine that <br>the missionary and the singers would have spent some time <br>together and that the missionary would have tried <br>out his arrangements of their songs with the singers who <br>were instructing him in how the songs went.  Is it not <br>possible that the conflicts which lay ahead had not yet grown <br>to the point where they would have marred their <br>spirit of cooperation?  I could imagine the missionary's hosts <br>seeming to be more enthusiastic about their <br>mutual efforts than they actually were, and the missionary <br>coming away with such an impression, but their <br>trying to drown out sounds which they detested seems very <br>unlikely to me, although from this distance it's <br>difficult to be sure. <br><br>	But supposing the harmonizing of their traditional songs <br>actually was something which most of them <br>really found delightful?  It seems to me that this is possible.  <br>Played on a piano in harmony, their songs would <br>in one way remain the very familiar songs which they had <br>liked so much, and yet there would be something radically <br>new about them inasmuch as they were harmonized.  This is <br>the way I believe I might react.  <br><br>	Craig Grady had written: "...This music is gone for the most <br>part or greatly corrupted by 12 et etc." <br>I believe it's probable that the missionary's piano was tuned <br>to mean tone temperament.  I have to say that I <br>believe music played on such a piano would have had a far <br>greater and more positive impact on people hearing <br>it for the first time than would "the same" music played on a <br>piano tuned to equal temperament.  Many will disagree.  We <br>can't know full details regarding the reactions of people who <br>lived long ago, but research into <br>the matter can be done.  Personally, when I started hearing <br>music on a piano in mean tone temperament and just <br>intonation after having heard virtually nothing but equal <br>tempered piano all my life, I thought it was something <br>wonderful.  Just hearing that kind of a piano made me feel <br>like getting up and starting to sing and dance.  I found it hard <br>to believe that a piano, of all musical instruments, could <br>sound so beautiful.  I have found quite a few who react <br>similarly to the way I do.  Many do not.  But I am not the only <br>one who feels that this piano sounds pretty terrific, and <br>maybe quite a few of those with whom the missionary worked <br>did, too.</div>
