The application of computer-based systems has<br>increased their scope by permitting precise explorations and<br>investigations of time-based procedures.  It could be said that the<br>serial nature of computer technology has emphasised the linear nature<br>of time, and simultaneously allowed us to destroy our traditional<br>time-based perceptions of sound events.  Recording and manipulating<br>sound material permits electroacoustic composers to take sound material<br>'out of time', to implement time distortions and to re-present sound<br>events; to be creative with our traditional perceptions of time.<br><br>This theme will allow authors to discuss any aspect of time as it<br>relates to their work.  This could include papers relating to the<br>processing of pre-recorded sound in the time domain, engineering<br>approaches to the time domain, the perception of time, time domain<br>representations and scores, sound recording/editing techniques or<br>aspects of sound synthesis related to time.  Authors might also<br>consider wider ranging topics such as the derivation of musical<br>form/structure, how composers allocate their time while composing (with<br>or without technology), or any other topics which arise from<br>considering sound and silence in the time domain.<br><br>TIMETABLE FOR SUBMISSIONS<br><br>Articles and other material for the editors' consideration should be<br>submitted by:<br><br>        January 8th, 1996.<br><br>If submitted in hard copy, three copies should be posted to:<br><br>        The Editors,<br>        Organised Sound,<br>        c/o Department of Music,<br>        University of York,<br>        Heslington,<br>        YORK<br>        YO1 5DD<br>        UK<br><br>EMail submissions are encouraged, and should be mailed to:<br><br>        os@cage.york.ac.uk<br><br>Full details of submission requirements can be requested from the<br>Editors.<br><br>GENERAL AIMS OF ORGANISED SOUND.<br><br>This journal is intended for student, amateur and professional<br>musicians, musicologists, engineers and members of the public<br>interested in the application of computers to music. It features papers<br>relating to any musical activity using computers, and any engineering<br>activity that has a demonstrable musical aim. Other audio arts, such as<br>multi-media works or sound sculptures are included. It also provides a<br>focus for engineers who are involved in the development of musical<br>tools. Approximately 60% of the article content for each issue will<br>be related to a named theme.<br><br>The editors have formulated the following broad aims:<br><br>        To provide a platform for musical and related technological<br>        discussion;<br>        To further the dialogue between engineers and<br>        musicians;<br>        To provide tutorial texts for students of computer<br>        music;<br>        To disseminate musical material through the production<br>        of a compact disk related to articles contained in the journal<br>        (one per annum);<br>        To encourage musical uses of multi-media;<br>        To encourage (young) specialists in the field to publish and share<br>        the results of their work.<br><br>FUTURE ISSUES<br><br>Volume 1, Number 3: ALGORITHMIC COMPOSITION<br><br>Co-Editors: Ross Kirk, Leigh Landy, Tony Myatt, Richard Orton.<br>Corresponding Editors:<br>        Lelio Camilleri, Daniel Oppenheim, Miller Puckette, Barry<br>        Truax, David Worrall<br>International Advisory Board:<br>        Marc Battier, Francois Bayle, Peter Castine, Alcedo Coenen,<br>        Francis Dhomont, Simon Emmerson, Rajmil Fischman, Takayuki Rai,<br>        Jean-Claude Risset, Francis Rumsey, John Rimmer, Conrado Silva,<br>        Christiane Ten-Hoopen, Daniel Teruggi, Jukka Tiensuu, Trevor<br>        Wishart, Scott Wyatt, Iannis Xenakis.<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 23 Oct 1995 16:55 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA11251; Mon, 23 Oct 1995 07:54:49 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 23 Oct 1995 07:54:49 -0700<br>Message-Id:  <9510230753.aa14976@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
