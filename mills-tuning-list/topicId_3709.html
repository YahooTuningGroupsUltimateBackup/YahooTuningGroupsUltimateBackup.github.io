Is there a <br>>single accepted definitive reference which defines the 'disappearance <br>>of a comma'? (Helmholtz?)  These are things I missed in my education.<br><br>With regard to the syntonic comma and some of the "better" ETs, you<br>probably can get quite a lot from references like Helmholtz. Otherwise,<br>I must humbly suggest that my consistency stuff is key. This has been<br>covered on the list before, contact me and I'll try to dig up the<br>relevant TDs. The syntonic comma is traditionally defined both as the<br>difference between a Pythagorean minor third and a just minor third, and<br>as the difference between a Pythagorean major third and a just major<br>third. When using the closest approximations to the consonant intervals<br>(one constructs the Pythagorean intervals from chains of perfect fifths)<br>in an ET not consistent within the 5-limit, these definitions may not<br>agree, so the comma itself, and the question of its disappearance, may<br>not be well-defined. Similarly, commas constructed from n-limit<br>intervals are uniquely defined in all tunings consistent within the<br>n-limit. Given consistency, the determination of the size of a comma in<br>an ET is fairly trivial.<br><br>In meantone tuning, the syntonic comma disappears by definition. That<br>is, even though it may be possible to find a better perfect fifth above<br>C than G, by extending the meantone tuning to 100 or so notes per<br>octave, and using such a perfect fifth to define a non-vanishing<br>syntonic comma, that's not really a kosher use of meantone. Other<br>non-closed tuning systems may also have "canonical" representations for<br>the consonances, and one should use these, not some distant<br>improvements, to define the commas. Going back to meantone, one can make<br>a case for defining the canonical 7/4 as the augmented sixth, and all<br>septimal commas can be determined from there. But that is already in<br>conflict with the interpretation of the dominant seventh chord as some<br>form of 4:5:6:7. Going to higher primes (odd composites don't lead to<br>any new commas) in meantone tuning or other non-closed systems is really<br>questionable unless those systems were designed with those primes in<br>mind.</div><h3><a id=8023 href="#8023">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/1998 1:30:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Tue, 9 Jun 1998, Paul H.
