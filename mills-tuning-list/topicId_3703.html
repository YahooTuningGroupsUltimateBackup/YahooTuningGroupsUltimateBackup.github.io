When Novatone<br>cratered, Mark Rankin took over some of the remnants of the company and<br>started selling interchangeable fretboards more or less as kits.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Gary, thanks for your answer.<br><br>Eduardo</div><h3><a id=8025 href="#8025">🔗</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>6/9/1998 6:47:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Sounds like you're describing my only synthsizer, the Ensoniq VFX-SD.<br><br>   Ah.

I<br>>think I know quite a few important Microtonalist here who are off line.<br>>Can everyonbe please send a short preferance vote in a timely fashion!<br><br>I think that a "vote" is premature. The question is not just what city is<br>the nicest/most convenient, but what facilities, funding, concert spaces,<br>accomodations, equipment, etc. are available (unless people prefer to have<br>just a short, more informal, get-together). I would be happy to go to San<br>Diego (it's close, less work for me!).<br><br>However, I would suggest that whoever would like to host such a conference<br>draw up a proposal, as I am in the process of doing, answering the<br>questions above. How long would it last? How many concerts? What facilities<br>are available? Most importantly, roughly how much would it cost and who<br>would pay? When a clearer picture emerges as to what the conference would<br>be like in each location, then people will have something more to express a<br>preference about.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
