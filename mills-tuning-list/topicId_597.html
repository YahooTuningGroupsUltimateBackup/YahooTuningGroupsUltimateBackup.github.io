I used my excel <br>spreadsheet and just typed =lcm( and then selected <br>some cells with the mouse.  The spreadsheet did the <br>rest.  It's quite convenient for doing JI music <br>calculations.  It does gcd too.<br><br>I confess, I suspected something would cancel out, <br>but I didn't have the time to go into it just then and <br>simplify.  Thanks for saving me the trouble.<br><br>I do think this representation makes the concept <br>clearer, but without more feedback I won't know.<br><br>I intend to write a chord sorting program based on <br>this principle when I can find the time, and do some <br>compositions, but free time is in mighty short supply <br>for me just now.<br><br>Marion<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 17 Jul 1996 08:16 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id XAA27155; Tue, 16 Jul 1996 23:16:36 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 16 Jul 1996 23:16:36 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01510101ae11d29e4c81@[205.218.46.35]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
