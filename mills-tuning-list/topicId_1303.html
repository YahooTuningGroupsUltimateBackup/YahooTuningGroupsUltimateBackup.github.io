Johnny Reinhard told me that he was encouraging  lurkers <br>to  decloak. Curiosity got the better of me and I quickly rejoined. I'll <br>introduce myself and I'll try to state why I like this forum.<br><br>	I'm a composer/pianist and Professor of Music at a college very <br>near to New York City. I teach theory and composition on both undergrad <br>and graduate levels, some music one for the non-musician, piano, MIDI <br>studio skills and all kinds of electives when they come around. All of <br>my composing has been in 12-ET but quite diverse, both tonal and atonal. <br>It was Stefan Wolpe who challenged me 35 years ago to question <br>everything and to be wary of conventions, especially those of standard <br>notation. Early on I loved to extend the sounds of the piano with <br>inside-of-the-piano exploits and keyboard manipulations that would <br>elicit  harmonic resonance.<br><br>	 In 1967 I began a three year stint at the Columbia-Princeton <br>electronic Music Center while living on Manhattan's upper West side. I <br>am indebted to Mario Davidovsky  and others for some insightful <br>training. Here, in this presynthesizer studio where most compositions <br>were created with 3 or 4 stereo reel-to-reel tape recorders, hand <br>splicing tape like it was movie film, pitch would drift as the vacuum <br>tubes warmed up and precise time synchronization was all but impossible <br>to achieve. And so I created a number of spacey things, developing a <br>taste for elusive pitch and floating musical sound shapes that were <br>disassociated from meter. <br><br>	I also had my first hands-on experience with computer music <br>around this time. There were no video monitors yet. It was punch carding <br>in the basement of the Columbia U computer building, waiting for your <br>stack to run upstairs, and if successful (a rare event) the digital tape <br>they'd hand you  would have to be sent to Westchester (some 40 miles <br>away) to be converted into analog, a two or three day delay. I decided <br>to drop out for a decade or so after one semester of this. It was the <br>hardest imaginable way to make music. I did learn o appreciate those  <br>hardy souls who did the pioneering and made it work. In that decade <br>before the PC, in addition to lots of 12-ET composing I did some writing <br>for percussion ensemble, a lot of free improv related to the study of <br>music therapy and several summers of vocal improv along the lines of the <br>Harmonic Choir. All of these musical experiences expanded my sense of <br>sonic resources. <br><br>	The rest is "modern times". Early in the '80's I embraced the PC <br>starting with Radio Shack's Color Computer and IBM's PC Junior and <br>became reasonably adept at the practical technologies that are around, <br>namely desktop publishing, MIDI and high quality home studio recording. <br>A short course with Johnny Reinhard some seven years ago quickly turned <br>me onto this world of the xenharmonic. Soon thereafter I took a semester <br>in the physics of sound at a nearby university and a lot of the math <br>that surrounds acoustics and sound engineering started to make sense. <br><br>	And so I hang around this forum to enjoy the poetry of <br>engineering ( sometimes, understanding something),  the world view that <br>permeates xenharmonic thinking; recommendations in regard to CD's, <br>software and books and what feels like a glimpse into what Johnny calls <br>"the beginning of the future." <br>	<br>	Visit my home page if you'd like to get better acquainted.  <br>There's nothing xenharmonic there yet but I'm working on it.<br><br>			Howard Rovics<br>			rovics@nai.net<br>	http://w3.nai.net/~rovics.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 2 Dec 1996 05:03 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13583; Mon, 2 Dec 1996 05:05:44 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13271<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id UAA04694; Sun, 1 Dec 1996 20:05:40 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 1 Dec 1996 20:05:40 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612020403.NAA01656@judy.sfc.keio.ac.jp><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4221 href="#4221">ðŸ”—</a>alves@osiris.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)</h3><span>12/2/1996 5:37:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>If we flip to the last four bars of the first movement of<br>>JS Bach's Italian Concerto,we are presented with a big fat I(6/4) chord<br>>on the downbeat.

I can only speak for myself;<br>>I hear it as a flaming dissonance which Bach briefly savors<br>>by abruptly slowing the rhythm after 12 bars of steady 16th notes.<br><br>I'm afraid that I do not hear it as a dissonance. There are several<br>historical reasons why the fourth was treated as a dissonance, but I think<br>one is that the systems of common-practice counterpoint used "dissonance"<br>interchangeably with "tension." Certainly this is not the case, and<br>something Babbitt I think fails to represent accurately in his zeal to<br>expose the arbitrary nature of common-practice counterpoint rules.<br><br>Can you have tension in tonal music without dissonance? Clearly so.<br>Dunstable and some other early 15th century composers wrote very beautiful<br>music with few or no dissonances, yet the music seems to me to have tension<br>and release about it.<br><br>Because the fifth of the chord is on the bottom, the 6/4 chord is not as<br>stable as the 5/3. Some theorists say this is because the 3rd harmonic of<br>the lowest note forms a dissonance with the other two notes of the triad.<br>There may be something to that, but of course Bach never thought of it that<br>way. It is easier to think of it as 6/4 "resolving" to 5/3, the same way<br>5/4 would resolve to 5/3.<br><br>In the second example, commonly a suspension, the fourth is not the<br>dissonance -- the dissonance is the second between the upper two voices.<br>However, because of the historical preoccupation with judging intervals<br>always in reference to the lowest sounding voice, it was simpler to call<br>the fourth a dissonance.<br><br>There is always a certain amount of arbitrariness in any musical system.<br>That's why it's art. However, music also has a basis in how we hear and the<br>physics of sound. Certainly some people, such as Hindemith, have oversold<br>this side of art in their misguided desire to make their style appear more<br>in keeping with "natural laws" and less artificial. (Brian has, on<br>occasion, and unfairly, I think, accused a wide range of JI composers of<br>this very error.)<br><br>Musical styles are created as a way of manipulating the physics and<br>perception of sound towards artistic ends. Babbitt's arguments against the<br>artificiality of the tonal system is ultimately pointless, I think, not to<br>mention the pot calling the kettle black.<br><br>Brian's vitriolic attack on Babbitt (besides beating a dead horse, as<br>someone else has pointed out), goes too far in his search for hyperbole. To<br>indict the man's musical education and knowledge in such strong terms<br>requires much more evidence than his lack of explicit differentiation<br>between sensory and musical perception of consonance and dissonance.<br><br>Perhaps it is because Brian sees Babbitt as one of the high priests of<br>academic music theory, which I don't think is really accurate anymore.<br>Certainly there are those people still around who enjoy nothing more than<br>pushing around numbers in sets ("Babbittry" was Greg Taylor's colorful<br>term), but, generally speaking, the heyday of that sort of thing is long<br>gone.<br><br>I will not deny that the popularity of this kind of theory among academics<br>was out of proportion with its historical importance, probably because of<br>the appeal of such a complex yet readily quantifiable type of analysis. Nor<br>will I try to claim that tuning issues are well-represented in the academic<br>press. However, Brian's own welcome bibliographies should serve as evidence<br>that there is no conscious Babbitt-led conspiracy against these issues.<br><br>On a related note: though I don't share many of John Cage's philosophical<br>viewpoints, I don't think it's fair to call him a charlatan. A charlatan is<br>someone with pretensions, someone who misrepresents what they are doing.<br>John Cage was upfront about exactly what he did and did not do. If you did<br>not want to call him a composer or what he did music, that was fine with<br>him.<br><br>And to see Cage as a high priest of academia is even further removed from<br>reality than in the case of Babbitt. I think that many academics did not<br>accept Cage for a long time. The reasons are obvious: How do you evaluate<br>chance music? How can you construct an objective theory about it? In that<br>sense, Cage was about as un-academic as they come, and I for one am<br>grateful for his breaking down some of the preconceptions and prejudices in<br>academia and the arts in general.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.

In this case<br>I think Bill's description of it in the 4-3 suspension as a non-dissonance<br>is in conflict with the traditional contrapuntal labelling<br>(of course not all suspensions contain dissonance, eg 6-5s), but<br>is consistent with the more specialized, sonority-local use<br>of "dissonance" described above which seems to be more commonly<br>adopted in discussions of consonance and dissonance with<br>respect to tuning systems. The issue of "correctness" is of course<br>much less important than bringing us to closer understanding of<br>musical phenomena and Bill's remarks certainly add clarity and<br>perspective to both the specific Bach example and the more general<br>issue of treatment of fourths in tonal music.<br><br>In that spirit, let me introduce one more way of viewing the fourth -<br>Heinrich Schenker's, which as I recall from "The Will of the Tone",<br>is based on an abstract view of the triad as the foundation of<br>both linear and harmonic motion. Schenker interprets the<br>overtone series as a "hint" to the artist who takes the triad<br>and discards the rest of the inconvenient (to his theory) overtones. <br>The triad and the facility to move in tonal space as defined<br>by the triad becomes the composer's "a priori". I can't recall<br>the example Schenker gives for tonal space, but the opening<br>melody for Bach's Brandenburg #3 is an excellent example:<br>despite neighboring notes everywhere, it is evident that the<br>melody is unambiguously outlining a tonic triad. <br><br>>From Schenker's point of view, a fourth might be heard as dissonant <br>owing to its melodic status as a passing tone in the interval<br>sequence 5-4-3, since the reference tonal space is 5-3, i.e. the<br>upper half of the triad outlined over the bass. It's difficult to discuss<br>hierarchies of tone without being tempted to say that some notes<br>are more "important" than others, which is subtly different from<br>saying that some notes have more structural weight, or different<br>syntactic function. So rather than call the fourth in the above<br>context "dissonant" it is perhaps better to call it<br>"unstable" in the same way that a sentence like<br>"I walked my ..." is unstable at the point I broke it off.<br><br>>Because the fifth of the chord is on the bottom, the 6/4 chord is not as<br>>stable as the 5/3. Some theorists say this is because the 3rd harmonic of<br>>the lowest note forms a dissonance with the other two notes of the triad.<br>>There may be something to that, but of course Bach never thought of it that<br>>way. It is easier to think of it as 6/4 "resolving" to 5/3, the same way<br>>5/4 would resolve to 5/3.<br><br>Agreed. I would add to this that in a tonal context, the I(6/4) chord takes on<br>considerable tension, since it does not in fact function as a I chord<br>at all (despite contain containing precisely the full set of pitches from the<br>tonic chord). Instead the driving feature of this chord is its bass note, degree V,<br>and the chord functions as a precursor to V. Therefore through purely syntactic function,<br>the chord, despite being consonant takes on a double instability: it is<br>a stand-in for the dominant - a tonally unstable region, but made even more unstable<br>by the fact that the dominant has not yet arrived but is imminent.<br><br>This to me is a beginning of an explanation as to how two sonorities,<br>one clearly more inherently dissonant than the other, can have their inherent dissonant<br>properties overridden by other contextual features of the music, such that the<br>less dissonant sonority takes on a high degree of tension in the music, and the<br>considerably more dissonant sonority takes on a less tense position.<br><br>As Bill concisely states:<br><br>>Musical styles are created as a way of manipulating the physics and<br>>perception of sound towards artistic ends.<br><br><br>It occurs to me that technical discussions of compositional deployment<br>of contrapuntal principles push the bandwidth boundaries of email groups.<br>Perhaps for that reason we haven't seen too many such discussions, although<br>I recall a few enlightening posts on the interaction between tunings and<br>voice leading by Gary Morrison quite awhile ago.
