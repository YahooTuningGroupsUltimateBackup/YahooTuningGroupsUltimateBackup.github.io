This is a long post, folks, but I promise you a very<br>strange twist if you stick it out...<br><br>[Soderberg:]<br>> >So to<br>> >malign 12tET (so I assume) is to malign its effects on the ear, not its<br>> >12-space compositional-theoretic properties, which are quite potent<br>> >regardless of how you tune it.

Stephen, I couldn't disagree with<br>> this position more, but I have only the highest respect for your<br>> intellectual rigor, and I appreciate the respect you've shown to mine.<br>> As a starting point for some discussion, perhaps you could tell us how<br>> far you'd go in defending the phrase "regardless of how you tune it" in<br>> the first sentence above. I infer that some would require a Rothenberg<br>> proper 12-tone scale; how about you, Stephen?<br><br>	After re-reading my post after Paul's comment, I can answer his<br>question "how far you'd go in defending the phrase 'regardless of how you<br>tune it'" quite easily: not far at all.  I have to admit that it came off<br>sounding like I don't believe that tuning "matters" at all, and this is<br>certainly not true.  My position would have been better served if I would<br>have approached it from this angle: once you choose a tuning -- ANY tuning<br>-- what then?  You're in a new universe -- are the "rules" the same here<br>or are they different?  What does "counterpoint" mean here?  How do you<br>want to define a "chord" and what does this definition imply about<br>voice-leading?  What's "consonant"? "dissonant"? "tonal"? "atonal"?  Does<br>this universe offer more "degrees of compositional freedom" or less?  Are<br>there formations, structures, transformations here that can't be found<br>elsewhere, and, if so, how can you take advantage of them?  Etc. etc.  In<br>7-scale diatonic (the language of the "Western canon"), these are all<br>non-questions unless you want to sound like Bach or Bacharach, and I sense<br>(with the possible exception of those legitimately interested in<br>historical tunings) most on the list are headed in clearly different<br>directions.  <br><br>	What I'm trying to get across (and this is a follow up to my "why<br>triads?" question) might best be seen through an example.  So let me use<br>Paul's 10-scale (specifically, the non-ME "standard pentachordal major,"<br>SPM).  The reason for this choice as an example is that Paul has offered<br>one of the best attempts I've seen to confront _publicly_ many of the<br>above questions in a decatonic environment.  And as Paul and a few others<br>seem to have concluded, triads are not _necessarily_ the best or most<br>logical choice for basic sonorities in synthetic mega-scales for a number<br>of good reasons.<br><br>	While I will be pointing out what might be termed some<br>"difficulties" with Paul's SPM, the analysis to follow is NOT meant to<br>"dis" this scale which has many interesting properties pointed out in<br>Paul's article.  Looking on scale theory as a kind of "abstract geometry"<br>compels me to hold that, first, no scale (like no geometry) is "wrong,"<br>though it might be (compositionally) misused or misapplied, and second,<br>scales (like geometries) can be related to one another via their invariant<br>properties. This is not to say that the non-invariants of a given<br>scale/tuning are unimportant (which is what my previous post may have<br>implied); to the contrary, non-invariants give a specific scale its<br>characteristic "flavor."  Thus, among 7-scales, the usual vanilla diatonic<br>major and the paprika Hungarian minor share some important invariant<br>properties, but no one is likely to confuse their non-invariant<br>properties.<br><br>	The SPM is based on the interval string <2232223222>.  While it is<br>not maximally even, it is nevertheless symmetric, an important defining<br>quality in chord formation.  So the SPM is: (0,2,4,7,9,11,13,16,18,20). To<br>define/generate tetrachords, Paul uses the string <3322> -- again,<br>symmetric but not ME -- which is to say that we are to form a chord by<br>taking (generic) notes 1,4,7,9.  The result is the following set of 10<br>basic tetrachords (to the left of the vertical line):<br><br>	scale<br>	step    tetra      string quality       tetra    name<br><br>	I     0  7 13 18   <7654> Maj       |  0 3 6 8   0x<br>	II    2  9 16 20   <7744> Aug       |  1 4 7 9   1x<br>	III   4 11 18  0   <7744> Aug       |  2 5 8 0   2x<br>	IV    7 13 20  2   <6745> Min       |  3 6 9 1   3x<br>	V     9 16  0  4   <7645> Ma-mi     |  4 7 0 2   4x<br>	VI   11 18  2  7   <7654> Maj       |  5 8 1 3   5x<br>	VII  13 20  4  9   <7654> Maj       |  6 9 2 4   6x<br>	VIII 16  0  7 11   <6745> Min       |  7 0 3 5   7x<br>	IX   18  2  9 13   <6745> Min       |  8 1 4 6   8x<br>	X    20  4 11 16   <6754> Mi-ma     |  9 2 5 7   9x<br><br>	Now let's "reduce" the SPM to a chromatic 10-scale (call it 10X<br>for reference) whose string is <1111111111> (this is pretty much the same<br>as naming the diatonic scale steps):<br><br>	0  2  4  7  9 11 13 16 18 20<br>	|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |<br>	V  V  V  V  V  V  V  V  V  V<br>	0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9<br><br>	Using the same chord-defining string as before, <3322>, we can<br>generate 10 chords in 10X, each of which corresponds 1-to-1 to a chord in<br>SPM (see above to the right of the vertical line -- each 10X chord is<br>"named" for reference.)  Since each 10X chord is based on the same string,<br><3322>, there is no way (other than relative scale position) to<br>distinguish and group them as there is with the chords in SPM.  Thus there<br>is no invariance between these two "systems" WITH RESPECT TO chord<br>"quality" -- and thus, since SPM and 10X are two ways to partition the<br>octave (two distinct tunings), tuning matters for specific chord quality<br>(but matters less, as we shall see, for _patterns_ of chord qualities).<br><br>	Now, Paul gives some very logical functional names to SPM chords<br>based on the identification of Q (3:2) with 13 chromatic steps.  We will<br>isolate here what he identifies as the tonic (I), the subdominant (V), and<br>the dominant (VII).  It's at this point that we can begin to see some very<br>important differences between 10-scales and 7-scales.  First, unlike<br>7-scales with <223> chords, 10-scales with <3322> chords only have one<br>triple of chords that covers the scale.  In the SPM scale, a triple of<br>_consecutive_ tetras will form a cover, but note that, although we might<br>expect it of a quasi-diatonic system, the union of the tonic, dominant,<br>and subdominant that Paul identifies is _not_ a cover of the scale.  In<br>fact, consecutive triples are the only sets which can form a cover for<br>SPM, and furthermore, due to "scale covariance" (described in my MTO<br>article), this characteristic is shared by _any_ 10-scale system based on<br><3322> chords.  This can be checked with the simple 10X system given<br>above, or by listing a random 10-string such as <1714539926> and listing<br>its <3322> chords.  So the T-D-SD relationship doesn't provide "key<br>coherence" as we might expect.<br><br>	A second characteristic of all 10-scale/<3322> systems is that,<br>unlike 7-scale/<223>&<2221> systems and others, they aren't saturated with<br>what Eytan Agmon calls "efficient linear transformations."  In the usual<br>diatonic, for example, any triad can be linked to any other triad by<br>either a unison or a scale-step move.  In SPM/<3322> there are two<br>fundamental progressions that don't connect smoothly: those whose roots<br>are 4 and 6 scale steps apart, respectively, e.g.:<br><br>	 I           V     I         VII<br><br>	18--------->16    18-------->20<br>	13-->(11)--> 9    13-------->13<br>	 7---------> 4     7--------> 9<br>	 0---------> 0     0-->(2)--> 4<br><br>whereas, for example, I-VI describes a typical ELT (smooth voice-leading):<br><br>	 I     VI<br><br>	18---->18<br>	13---->11<br>	 7----> 7<br>	 0----> 2<br><br>Once again, this is true of all 10-scale/<3322> systems due to scale<br>covariance.<br><br>	Another interesting property that scale covariance carries through<br>all 10-scale/<3322> systems is the common-tone pattern.  Starting with any<br>chord in the list above, chord pairs n scale steps apart will have x tones<br>in common:<br><br>	n:   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9<br>	x:   4 0 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 0<br><br>	Finally, the pattern of chord qualities is invariant for 10-scale<br>systems based on a scale string <xxyxxxyxxx> (where x ne y are any<br>integers) and generic string <3322> as above.  To illustrate, let Maj = a,<br>Min= a', Ma-mi = b, Mi-ma = b', and Aug = c; then the quality pattern will<br>always be some rotation of: a c c a' b a a a' a' b' (a skew-symmetric<br>pattern generated by the interaction of the scale and generic strings).<br><br>	The bottom line is, while scale tuning "matters" in many ways (not<br>the least of which is vertical & horizontal quality/modality, imparting a<br>defining "flavor" to a system), once you have chosen a scale, the real<br>work is just beginning since most scales offer multiple "geometric"<br>possibilities.  Let's now see what happens if we use a triad as a basic<br>chord in SPM.<br><br>	If we keep the demand for a 3:2 basis for a majority of chords (a<br>possibly psychologically reasonable but not logically necessary<br>condition), one plausible triad list uses the ME generic string <334><br>which in effect simply deletes the top note of Paul's tetras yielding<br>triads:<br><br>	I     0  7 13   Maj<br>	II    2  9 16   Aug<br>	III   4 11 18   Aug<br>	IV    7 13 20   Min<br>	V     9 16  0   Maj<br>	VI   11 18  2   Maj<br>	VII  13 20  4   Maj<br>	VIII 16  0  7   Min<br>	IX   18  2  9   Min<br>	X    20  4 11   Min<br><br>This reduces the 5 tetrachord qualities to 3 trichord qualities: <769><br>(Maj), <679> (Min), and <778> (Aug).<br><br>	First, this tells us something interesting about minimal covers<br>because it focuses attention on triads of identical quality.  We noted<br>above that the only cover (with the usual criterion for a triple of<br>chords) for tetras here was three consecutive tetras and therefore the<br>"tonic" could not participate with the "dominant" and "subdominant" to<br>form a cover. But the above list suggests that the cover principle works<br>differently in this scale's universe.  Three consecutive triads won't<br>cover the scale, but four consecutive triads will.  AND, by altering the<br>cover principle in this way, we find other, more interesting covers which<br>tend to alter the way we might envision the T-D relationship.  If we<br>collect all the Maj chords (I,V,VI,VII), say, we disclose a second minimal<br>cover which can be expanded to any four chords in that (root)<br>relationship.  Furthermore, while ELT (smooth voice leading) is fairly<br>depleted in this (triadic) interpretation, it is in full force for<br>quadruples of chords in a cover: the progression I-V-VI-VII-I is<br>ELT-saturated.  All of this suggests the interesting possibility that, in<br>this universe, there are _three_ "dominant" functions -- "dominant" (VII),<br>"subdominant" (V), and an auxiliary(?) "spanning dominant" (VI) since<br>I-VII and I-V are naturals for voice-leading, but you can't easily lead V<br>to VII without VI.<br><br>	This then brings us back to the status of Paul's original tetra<br>selection.  There are several ways to include triads here.  The obvious<br>way is to declare the triad to be the scale's basic sonority.  This would<br>then turn Paul's tetra into a "seventh" chord, and, while things would<br>look somewhat strange, the building blocks would pretty much resemble our<br>inhereted notions of chords.<br><br>	A second interpretation holds, I think, much more promise -- and<br>beside, it's more radical.  Here's where I jump off the high-dive and hope<br>there's water in the pool when I reach bottom.  First, a preliminary<br>exercise.  Take any typical 4-part harmonization of a hymn.  Play the<br>soprano & alto lines up an octave and the tenor & bass parts down an<br>octave.  Concentrate on hearing it, not as 4 lines and not as a succession<br>of chords, but as 2 lines, each of which consists of 2 lines.<br><br>	One of the questions I asked near the beginning concerned<br>"counterpoint" in megascale systems.  Let's assume that the tetra<br>described above is the basic harmonic sonority in our system analogous to<br>the triad in common practice theory (CPT).  In CPT there's a hierarchy,<br><br>	pitch (unad)<br>	interval (doad)<br>	triad<br>	(7th chord)<br><br>along with well-defined notions of consonance and dissonance, which taken<br>together help shape the "rules" of CPT counterpoint.  Replacing the CPT<br>triad with the SPM tetrachord, we now posit the following hierarchy:<br><br>	pitch (unad)<br>	interval (doad)<br>	hyperinterval (triad)<br>	tetrachord<br>	("7th chord")<br><br>	Ignoring the 7-th chord to keep the illustration simple, focus on<br>the new structure, the triadic "hyperinterval" (HI).  Define a consonant<br>HI as the intervallic complex formed by any three pitches in a (consonant)<br>tetrachord (just as, ahistorically, we can define a consonant interval<br>backward as formed by any two pitches in a consonant triad).  Call this<br>set of 3 pitches a "hypertone" (HT).  We now have the basis for a<br>generalization of traditional counterpoint which might be called<br>"counterset."  Hypothetically, traditional counterpoint (in any historical<br>version) should turn out to be a category of counterset.<br><br>	What are the "rules" of counterset?  I haven't the foggiest idea.<br>The reason is that their definition, in my opinion, must hinge on<br>compositional praxis (if anyone decides to play with this idea -- and I<br>won't hold my breath). But a random "2-part" exercise (with no<br>"dissonance" allowed) might look like:<br><br>Counterset:   { 7 13 18}  { 9 16  4}  {11  2  7}  {13 20  4}  { 0  7 13}<br><br>CF:-)         { 0  7 18}  { 9 16  0}  {11 18  2}  {20  4  9}  { 0  7 18}<br><br>                  (I)         (V)        (VI)        (VII)        (I)<br><br>Set notation for HTs is retained to emphasize that the elements of any HT<br>can appear compositionally in any order.  Cantus firmus and Counterset<br>lines can be distinguished by tessitura, instrumentation, rhythm,<br>repetition, leaps, etc.  Any HT can appear as a simultaneity or an<br>arpeggiation.  At times the "lines" may not be aurally distinguishable at<br>all.  Dissonance at the HI level can be introduced by passing or other<br>non-chord HTs -- e.g., in VI above replace {11 2 7} with a HT belonging to<br>another chord, such as {20 4 11} from chord X (the totality, {2 4 11 18<br>20}, is not a consonant "chord" since it contains a foreign HT).<br><br>	In the preparatory exercise above, the 4-part chorale setting was<br>re-interpreted (in our new language) as a 2-part hypertonal setting.  If<br>the original tessitura is now reinstated, the hypertonal interpretation of<br>the setting, while not "incorrect," appears absurd -- it collapses into a<br>mere paper theory. In other words, there is generally not much use for<br>hypertonal theory in traditional musics, EVEN THOUGH they may be<br>considered as "first-order" hypertonal... you just can't hear it, nor<br>should you be able to, nor should you want to (IMHO). But when we get into<br>megascales, CPT can't handle the increase in volume -- of the individual<br>notes and of the new relationships that begin to appear (I know I'm into<br>opinion-mongering here).  So the next thing to appear is (as above) a<br>second-order hypertonal set of structures.  I've seen it occur time and<br>again, not just with Paul's scales.  And each time, these second-order<br>(and higher) structures bring with them a semblance of a very new (and<br>strange) type of order.<br><br>	(Two other lower-order hypertonal systems can also be posited --<br>chord clusters and tone rows, but I won't muddy the waters with those<br>right now (especially the latter which would lead to a deconstruction<br>that denies the existence of "atonality"))<br><br>	Returning to the original point, then, does tuning matter?  Yes,<br>but as I've been trying to demonstrate, megascales tend to gravitate into<br>"bundles" of megascales which are defined by the invariants shared by the<br>bundle.  And one of the most universal invariants appears to me to be<br>hypertonal ordering... the "laws" of counterpoint don't really change in<br>other universes, they just get really weird.  And this leads to the final<br>question which, for now, has to remain open: Can we hear it?  (Any<br>composers out there like to take on the challenge?)<br><br><br>Steve Soderberg</div>
