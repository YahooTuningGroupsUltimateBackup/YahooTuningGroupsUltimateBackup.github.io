Anyway, in addition to<br>the two items you mentioned, I'd like to add two more<br><br>1)  The ability to use several different tuning tables at once, perhaps as<br>many as 16 but at least 4, with table assignment on a per-MIDI-channel basis.<br><br>2)  Sample assignment (in the case of sample-based synthesis) by nearest-to-<br>sampled-pitch rather than by note number.  This is the most sever problem with<br>using Proteuses for tunings that don't map 12-tones-per-octave.  For example,<br>31-tET on a Proteus causes the lower tones to be pitch-shifted way above their<br>sampled pitch, and higher tones to be shifted way below their sampled pitch,<br>making most sounds totally unusable for most musical purposes - they just<br>sound too bad for anything but getting a rough idea of what the tunings sound<br>like.  There.  I've ranted.</div>
