First of all, the frets were tied on so that<br>their position is likely to have shifted. Second, the frets were made of<br>natural materials (especially gut) so that they tend to decay over time.<br>Third, as all players of fretted instruments know, the position of the fret<br>is only one factor in the pitch produced. Most players can adjust the pitch<br>considerably with their fretting fingers.<br><br>Lindley's book on Lutes, Viols, and Temperaments (has someone got the<br>reference handy?) gives some ideas about how a set of frets can be subtlyset so as not to yield the same ratio on each string.

Could you tell us more about how you define "limit"?<br>><br>>Limit can refer either to a standard of consonance or the design of a just<br>>tuning system. In the latter usage, a prime number characterizes the largest<br>>prime number occuring as a factor in any of the just ratios. When referring<br>>to a standard of consonance, it usually refers to the largest ODD factor in<br>>all the ratios considered consonant. Partch usually used it in this way, as<br>>he subscribed to a fairly strong form of octave equivalence. As it happens,<br>>Partch's music can be called 11-limit using both definitions. I was using the<br>>standard of consonance definition in this chart. I have already posted on<br>>consistency, otonal limit, utonal limit, and saturated chords; unfortunately<br>>I don't think an archive exists for the last two years of the digest.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET><br>Subject:  Re: My Friends the Aliens<br>PostedDate:  19-12-97 19:12:31<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  19-12-97 19:10:23-19-12-97 19:10:23,19-12-97 19:09:59-19-12-97 19:10:00<br>DeliveredDate:  19-12-97 19:10:00<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256572.0063D22B; Fri, 19 Dec 1997 19:12:15 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA19893; Fri, 19 Dec 1997 19:12:31 +0100<br>Date: Fri, 19 Dec 1997 19:12:31 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA19849<br>Received: (qmail 12624 invoked from network); 19 Dec 1997 09:54:02 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 19 Dec 1997 09:54:02 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.95.971219093630.8394A-100000@u1.farm.idt.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
