The brochure for the MRs<br>sates " 1 RAM location for receiving a Pitch Table..." ,I thought this <br>meant that each MIDI channel/<br>"instrument' could have a different tuning.Also,Is there any way to <br>switch tunings on an individual channel during performance,perhaps via <br>real-time sys-ex ?<br><br><br>I've been crunching some numbers,and it looks as though Yamahas like the <br>FB-01,TX-81Z,etc. can get to within 0.1 to 0.2 Hz of pure just intervals <br>(the TX-802 seems even better at mostly within 0.1Hz). Can anyone confirm <br>? Also,would this resolution be good enough for "educational" purposes ?<br><br><br>-Drew<br><br>"Oh you wouldn't know them Darling, they're respectable."<br>Myrna Loy in 'After the Thin Man'</div>
