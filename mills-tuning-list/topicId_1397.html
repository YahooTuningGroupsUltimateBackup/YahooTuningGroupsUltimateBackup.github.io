Inasmuch as Stockhausen was also published in<br>_Source_, I assume that he was familiar with the contents. (2) Stockhausen<br>student Johannes Fritsch published an article on Partchï¿½s Harmony in _The<br>Feedback Papers_.  (3) Former Partch percussionist Michael Ranta was (and<br>is) resident in Koeln, and worked together with Stockhausen, at least in<br>procuring Asian Percussion instruments.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 18 Dec 1996 15:27 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01613; Wed, 18 Dec 1996 15:29:45 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01611<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id GAA08210; Wed, 18 Dec 1996 06:29:41 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 18 Dec 1996 06:29:41 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009AD07FF6BAC3E0.D38F@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
