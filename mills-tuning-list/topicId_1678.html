Euclid's<br>name is often associated with that technique. & of course Goedel's.<br><br>So with music. Certainly there are lots of musical systems, including<br>alternative tuning systems. We can compare these, discover relationships of<br>mutual support or conflict, etc. And we can also try to dig or distill to<br>find some foundation or essence, some secure truth from which we can infer<br>the truth value of the many musical propositions we entertain. <br><br>Somehow it seems that when folks go foundation hunting, they often bag quite<br>a variety of game. Variety is not altogether bad in fruit, but it's death to<br>roots. The effort to resolve conflicts instead intensifies the conflicts.  <br><br>If science cannot resolve a conflict, is the matter worth pursuing? If we say<br>"no", then don't we discard the most important treasures of humanity? If we<br>say "yes", do we thereby enlist in new rounds of religious warfare?<br><br>Stephen Toulmin's COSMOPOLIS: THE HIDDEN AGENDA OF MODERNITY nicely argues<br>that science grew out of the bitter religious conflicts that arose during the<br>16th & 17th Centuries. Toulmin describes some of the devastation of the 30<br>years war, 1618-1648. I was eating lunch with a Polish friend the other day,<br>who recalled that the Polish population declined from 10 million to 6 million<br>during just a few years of that conflict. I've heard that some regions of<br>Central Europe suffered 70% mortality during that war. <br><br>So science was more or less an agreement to focus on issues that could be<br>resolved by recourse to objective observation, logic, etc. To remove other<br>issues from the political sphere. To decriminalize (religious) heresy.<br><br>I've just started looking at ECOLOGIES OF KNOWLEDGE: WORK AND POLITICS IN<br>SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, ed. by Susan L. Star. A sentence:<br><br>  The sociology of art has been concerned with the question of whether some<br>  things aren't *really* just beautiful (in a timeless or transcendental<br>  fashion).<br><br>There's a note on this sentence to Howard Becker, no specific work. But in<br>the bibliography his ART WORLDS is listed, so that might have some relevance<br>to the matter.<br><br>This issue is perhaps the fundamental problem of our time, so its scope is<br>far vaster than music and tuning. But music and tuning might actually capture<br>the issue in a nutshell. Mathematics meets aesthetics, face to face. <br><br>Out of the muck grows and blossoms the most beautiful flower!<br><br>Jim<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 17 Feb 1997 05:54 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08234; Mon, 17 Feb 1997 05:54:20 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08227<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id UAA27479; Sun, 16 Feb 1997 20:52:42 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 16 Feb 1997 20:52:42 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199702162350_MC2-115B-A62A@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4820 href="#4820">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MorriSonics@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/1997 7:55:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Replying to Charles Lucy:<br><br>> It seems that by taking steps of fourths and fifths, from a given pitch,<br>> all "harmonics" (ghosttones?) can be mapped in a continuous series.<br>> The interval between the fourth and the fifth is exactly [1200/(2*pi)> 190.9858 cents] . This interval Harrison called the "larger" interval.<br>> I have used the term "Large"(L).<br><br>   Can you show us any specific evidence that this maps to partials of any<br>pitch from any instrument instrument more accurately than integer<br>multiples?  Or is the closeness of the mapping not your main point?  <br><br><br><br>> It seems that notes, which are closer on the spiral of fifths and <br>> fourths are more consonant than those which are a greater number of<br>> steps apart..<br><br>   Are you sure that "consonant" is the best choice of words here?  Would<br>you for example view a major second (two fifths apart) as more consonant<br>than a major sixth (three fifths apart)?  <br><br>   "Consonant" is probably a good term in one sense but not another:  Since<br>consonance REALLY means closeness to resolution to the tonic in a tonal<br>system (despite its common but technically incorrect usage as more or less<br>the opposite of "discordant"), closeness on the circle of fifths (spiral or<br>whatever) is a pretty good measure of closeness to the tonic in a tonal<br>system.  But it's probably not a very good measure of consonance in thee<br>sense of discord (for the reason I suggested above).  Discord is another<br>way in which a harmony can sound farther from resolution.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 18 Feb 1997 06:38 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10224; Tue, 18 Feb 1997 06:38:51 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10221<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id VAA27152; Mon, 17 Feb 1997 21:37:15 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 17 Feb 1997 21:37:15 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.91.970217211847.25495A-100000@si.UCSC.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
