[I had been lamenting the current state<br>of "LSI injection molded no user modifiable parts inside" that<br>modern electronics have become.]<br><br>While I was looking at Pauls keyboard mapping for 22, the engineers<br>urge ["Where's my Leatherman?"] hit, and off came the cover of my<br>"bargain" keyboard.  Within 20 minutes, I was out of the door to pick<br>up another kbd as a source of more "keys" at the conveiniently running<br>sale.<br><br>At this point I'm about half way through rebuilding the keyboard<br>as a 22TET controller.  I pretty much took Paul literally, and<br>left the 'E's out, although the actual arrangement of the keys<br>is a bit different, as necessitated by the injection molded parts,<br>and the odd spacing of the cutouts in the white keys.  The net<br>result is a repeating pattern of  5 black/6 white, and a gap the<br>size of a black key every "octave" (two groups).  Pretty slick,<br>I thought.<br><br>I'll probably finish the assembly this evening while the cheesecake<br>is in the oven, and then all that remains it to redo the tuning<br>table on my ClassicKeys and I'll be off and running (or stumbling,<br>in my case :)<br><br>The whole point is that it *can* be done (still), and while buying<br>2 keyboards probably isn't how those of you with classy instruments<br>would want to go (perhaps get a service manual and order the extra<br>keys), it worked fine for me, and I now have a couple of circuit<br>boards that convert switch closure to MIDI to use in another<br>project in the future.<br><br>Steve<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Steven Rezsutek <rezsutek@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov><br>Subject:  Minor addendum to "Bucking the system"<br>PostedDate:  10-11-97 20:20:20<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  10-11-97 20:19:09-10-11-97 20:19:10,10-11-97 19:19:27-10-11-97 19:19:27<br>DeliveredDate:  10-11-97 19:19:27<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125654B.006A1CB7; Mon, 10 Nov 1997 20:19:01 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08291; Mon, 10 Nov 1997 20:20:20 +0100<br>Date: Mon, 10 Nov 1997 20:20:20 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08270<br>Received: (qmail 11567 invoked from network); 10 Nov 1997 11:20:16 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 10 Nov 1997 11:20:16 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199711101918.OAA25808@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
