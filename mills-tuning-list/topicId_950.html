Real<br>>instrumental sounds deviate significantly from a ideal series.<br><br>These deviations are small compared with the resolution of the central pitch <br>processor (~1%). Actually, the central pitch processor works best when the <br>relationships are slightly stretched, but this is a small effect.<br><br>>Does your<br>>processor make tolerance decisions at both the individual instrument<br>>(pitch) and the instrumental ensemble (chord) levels?<br><br>Yes, absolutely. A chord consisting of several "inharmonic series" could be <br>analysed in this way. For a chord consisting of harmonic or near-harmonic <br>series, the partials add no conflicting information as to the root should <br>be. However, the partials can aid in making this judgment, especially if the <br>chord tone fundamentals are rather low in pitch.<br><br>>It was for precisely<br>>this complication that I made my initial assumptions of a sine wave<br>>orchestra.<br><br>Do you agree now that this assumption is incompatible with your treatment of <br>subharmonic chords?<br><br>>(2) Are amplitude and phase differences among the partials ignored?<br><br>Yes, but phase differences do not affect the central pitch processor. <br>Amplitude differences may, but as long as the fundamentals are similar in <br>amplitude and have similar overtone structures, the ratio-interpretation <br>should be correct.<br><br>>(3) Would it be terribly difficult to couple your root-finding function<br>>with some harmonic distance function in order to address chord<br>>progressions?<br><br>I don't see why it would be difficult. However, the character of chord <br>progressions seems to me far more subjective and culturally influenced, or <br>at least far more difficult to model, than the perception of virtual pitch. <br>Although certainly general statements can be made, such as compounds of <br>simple harmonics are more important for chord progressions, while higher <br>harmonics are more important for chord construction.<br><br>>(4) The limits on amplitude and durational aspects limit the algorithm to a<br>>part of the worlds music; would you define this more precisely? In<br>>general, I find this to be the most difficult part of your work (and of<br>>other research along these lines) in that you have reified aspects<br>>particular to a small musical repertoire as psychoacoustical facts.<br><br>My theory is only intended to predict the perception of chords under <br>circumstances of long duration and equal amplitude -- the ideal <br>circumstances for perceiving complex ratios. In other circumstances, the <br>parameter that controls the precision of the central pitch processor's input <br>signals can be adjusted to reflect less precision, and the results will show <br>a preference for simpler relationships.<br><br><br>Some comments:<br><br>>>(1) Naturally, if a triad is tuned 5:6:7, the fundmental frequency of the<br>>>series on 1 is reinforced;<br><br>>what happens, when it is tuned /7:/6:/5, or in a temperament where the<br>>approximation of 7 is poor?<br><br>Then one has an essentially rootless sound, since no simple interpretation <br>in terms of harmonics gets much certainty. For example, in 22-tet, the a <br>pitch resolution of 1% leads to 0 6 11 being heard as 7:6:5 with a relative <br>certainty of 38.5, while 0 5 11 has no such certain interpretation; the most <br>likely interperetation is as 24:20:17 with a relative certainty of 8.70. <br>(This is using the version of the algorithm that treats all inversions and <br>extensions as equivalent).<br><br>> If I recall correctly, Boomsliter and Creel<br>>demonstrated that in harmonic contexts both trained and untrained subjects<br>>had a preference for the real interval of 225/128 over 7/4, thus showing<br>>that a lower position within a harmonic series was not necessarily<br>>preferable to some other, more complex relationship.<br><br>They were probably just targeting a slighlty stretched 7/4. Terhardt <br>addresses some possible explanations for this preference for stretching.<br><br>Might I suggest that their results were also far from unbiased.<br><br>>(2) My musical experience suggests, however, that diminished, augmented,<br>>and other intervallically symmetrical pitch complexes function in tonal<br>>music as ambiguous - neither major nor minor - structures. For this reason,<br>>I introduced the _neutral_ characterization for pitch spacings that are<br>>neither harmonic nor subharmonic.<br><br>This may often be useful.<br><br>>(3) 54:64:81 is a chord that I am able to identify immediately in<br>>relationship to a previously known tonic of 2^n. I recognize it in both<br>>terms of harmonic distance from 2^n, from the size of the melodic intervals<br>>which I have learned to distinguish (thus at least part of my recognition<br>>is cultural), and from beating.<br><br>Yes, but most people have not learned to distinguish these things.<br><br>>Moreover, my recognition of this chord cues<br>>me in on the entire field of relationships including this chord and the<br>>chord proceeding it. It is this field that seems to determine musically<br>>dynamic characteristics: chord _progression_; tonicity; _resolution_;<br>>surprise, etc..<br><br>Don't let me dissuade you from trying to formulate a wide-ranging theory of <br>JI compostition. Sounds good to me.<br><br>>(4) The melodic difference between 9/8 and 10/9 is too real to be dismissed<br>>as something "handled on paper". Even if the listener doesnt get the<br>>melodic difference immediately (something heard all the time in good string<br>>playing or unaccompanied vocal music), eventually the comma difference will<br>>either manifest itself in a _bad_ fifth, which is immediately _heard_ as<br>>such, or a _return_ to a tonic that has missed its mark by a comma  (the<br>>ear is much faster at picking this up than the eye anyways).<br><br>Not necessarily. There are other possibilities:<br><br>(1) An apparently held tone was actually adjusted by a comma during a non-p5 <br>chord change.<br>(2) Tempering.<br><br>>(5) Which interpretation does this support? Your own analysis of the minor<br>>triad prefers a subharmonic description. You can not have it both ways. For<br>>this reason, I find it sufficent to base my spacing description upon<br>>fundamental frequencies and a single calculated fundamental or guiding<br>>tone.<br><br>Please re-read what I have said. The tonicity algorithm form only a part of <br>the considerations of consonance and tuning. The other part is roughness, <br>which I feel has been dealt with adequately in the research.<br><br>>(6) The harmonic and subharmonic series are two transfinite series with<br>>different memberships; the second may be constructed from the first, but a<br>>one to one mapping of the second onto the first is not possible.<br><br>Sure it's possible. n->1/n.<br><br>>This is<br>>however, coincidental to my point, that we process subharmonic structures<br>>less well than harmonic due to conceptual and computational difficulties.<br>>Example: it is much easier to compare three objects with one object than it<br>>is to compare one object with thirds of an object.<br><br>This analogy is metaphysical and of limited value compared with an <br>understnding of the virtual pitch phenomenon. Who's to say that the "object" <br>is frequency and not period or string length.<br><br>>(7) Prof. Hennix has worked specifically with musical issues; most closely<br>>with the late John Myhill and with La Monte Young. (Her closest purely<br>>mathematical collaborations were with Myhill and with A.S. Yesinin-Volpin.)<br>>She may represent a different school of mathematical foundations from your<br>>own, but her work is anything but drivel; indeed intuitionist proof demands<br>>are the most rigorous.<br><br>I am sympathetic with an intuitionist philosophy of mathematics. However, <br>the one subject to which I have devoted more study that microtonality is the <br>foundations of quantum mechanics. The mathematics of quantum mechanics is <br>eminently classical, though its metaphysics and epistemology are most <br>certainly not. So assuming that mathmatics goes funny at the very small due <br>to quantum effects would be viciously circular. Besides, if quantum effects <br>were associated with musical tones, it would be with those of high pitch; <br>low-pitch tones are low-energy-per-quantum waves and therefore behave <br>classically.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 30 Sep 1996 20:12 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06754; Mon, 30 Sep 1996 19:12:17 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07149<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA08079; Mon, 30 Sep 1996 11:12:15 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 30 Sep 1996 11:12:15 -0700<br>Message-Id: <81960930180818/0005695065PK3EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
