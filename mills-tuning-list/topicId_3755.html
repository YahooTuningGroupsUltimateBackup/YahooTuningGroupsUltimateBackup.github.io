Someone please correct me if I've <br>> got something  wrong.<br><br>Drew, as I say, I'm not sure if I understood you correctly, but some <br>samplers (eg., Roland S770 series, Akai S1000 series) keep sample <br>looping parameters in ROM.  On the Roland, for example, up to 512 <br>samples (ie, the total number of samples that can be loaded at one <br>time) can be looped any which way you like and it will make no <br>difference at all to the amount of RAM that is available.  I'm sorry, <br>I can't tell you if this is the same on the EMU units, but I suspect <br>that, on these, as you say, looping may eat into RAM.  <br><br>This is all I was referring to, not questions of detuning.<br><br>Patrick O-L</div>
