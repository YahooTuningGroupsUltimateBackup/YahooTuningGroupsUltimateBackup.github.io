There are "spectral" composers such as Grisey, Risset, and Murail who <br>round out overtone relationships to the nearest quartertone and eighthtone.<br>But the concept of a 5/4 just third is completely absent from both <br>practice _and_ theory.<br><br>Good friends - quite well known musicians all - finally got through to me <br>that they have never understood me on previous occassions.<br><br>That said, several composers have now begun breaking down the whole tone <br>into 16th tones (called 16ths music) following the influence of <br>Carrillo (incl. Alain Bancquart, Pascale Criton, Fernand Vandenbogaerde).<br><br>Alain Bancquart has prepared a piano room at the Paris <br>Conservatoire (newly built building) which contains to beautiful grands a <br>quartertone apart, the original 16th tone piano upright made by Carrillo <br>(formerly in Nice, France), a third tone piano, and a "mirror" tuned <br>quartertone piano which integrates quartertones in the order 3/4 tones, <br>1/4 tone, etc.  <br><br>Publisher/Composer Gad Barnea (Editions Europeenes) is leading the way to JT <br>as we know it but it is pioneering work.  Iannis Xenakis brings in more of the <br>sound spectrum than others, as does his former student Pascal Dusapin, <br>and the Varese premiere has ignited a whole new focus <br>on "The Liberation of Sound" (the name of Varese's monograph which is <br>most exemplified by my performance of the Graphs and Time conducting the <br>Ensemble 2e2m.  The 8-member ensemble members had never improvised before <br>(except for the horn, tuba, and percussion).  Its director Paul Mefano - <br>also a composer using quartertones and glissandi <br>regularly - favors large works with microtones galore, but up till now, <br>only those of 1/4 and  1/8 tones.  The concert at the Pompidou Center <br>Great Hall included microtonalists Doinia Rotaru of Romania and Drake <br>Mabry the oboist/composer, all within the strictures of exact 1/4's 1/8/s <br>and glissandi.<br><br>Now I understand why Le Monde dismissed performances of Harry Partch <br>without the original percussion instruments performed by the AFMM years <br>ago in Nice, which they never actually attended: it is only through the <br>"sound sculpture" instruments that Partch was reduceable to music.  For <br>France, Partch's monophonic fabric in its precision of relationships is <br>not constituted in music theory.  For them there are 9 commas in an equal <br>tempered whole tone and nothing more.  Ideas anyone on improving the JI <br>climate?<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@styx.ios.com<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 1 Feb 1996 15:12 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id GAA25699; Thu, 1 Feb 1996 06:12:19 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 1 Feb 1996 06:12:19 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199602011410.JAA28816@freenet3.carleton.ca><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
