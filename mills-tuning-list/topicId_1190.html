Can we come up<br>>with key layouts that make sense on a nearly-square format?<br><br>>I have thought of another type of controller than a keyboard (it would<br>>probably be too difficult to describe in words) but it does have one<br>>problem in common with this sort of thing: It would be kinda tough to make<br>>velocity sensitivity detectable.<br><br>Letterboxed and Flat screen monitors are already available and I understand<br>that flexible monitors are a possibility. I suspect that software or laser<br>detectors might solve the velocity question.<br><br>During the past year Moore's Law ( ie. processor speed doubling every 18<br>months) was trashed as processor speed doubled in approx. 6 months and it<br>seems probable that  Exponential PowerPC chips @ 533Mhz will be available<br>in Mid 1997. Exponential claims that this chip design is scaleable<br>to...26Ghz!!!<br><br>Let us not be to ethnocentric.
