Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com><br><br>Let those of us who don't understand Partch's work not accuse him of<br>muddy thinking!!! As for priority, I seriously doubt the claim that the<br>prime-limit concept predated Partch's work; in fact, it is often merely<br>the result of misunderstanding Partch.<br><br>I think we have at least four schools of thought here; add in the<br>question of dualism and there are eight philosophies about the<br>mathematical characterization of chords. All these, by the way, leave<br>aside the issues of temperament and octave equivalence, so so will I for<br>now.<br><br>Let us sidestep the issue of odd vs. prime limits for now, and consider<br>another dichotomy within the context of 5-limit lattices. There are<br>those who subscribe to a rectangular matrix/ROHS/LCM/Tenney harmonic<br>distance idea.  According to any of these philosophies, 15:1 is "the<br>same" as 5:3, i.e., a major seventh is just as dissonant/complex as a<br>major sixth. (Note that this conclusion is independent of the odd/prime<br>question; it is important to keep that question from entering the<br>present dichotomy.) In the rectangular matrix point of view, both<br>intervals involve moving one unit along the 3-axis and one unit along<br>the 5-axis. The relevant ROHS is this a 1X1 rectangle. The LCM of both<br>intervals is 15.<br><br>Since I think the major sixth is as basic a consonance as the major<br>third (for many reasons including some recently discussed experiments on<br>tuning major triads), I prefer a triangular lattice. Here 5:3 has an<br>axis unto itself, so the lattice is filled with triangles, which<br>represent major or minor triads depending on their orienetation. Now 5:3<br>is just one step, while 15:1 is two. Considering that actual occurences<br>where a 15:1 is emphasized in music are typically in the form 15:5:1 or<br>15:3:1 (or 15:5:3:1), while 5:3 is happy all by itself, the triangular<br>lattice seems more appropriate. In fact, the major seventh in equal<br>temperament is 11 times closer to 17:9 than to 15:8; the reason that<br>doesn't matter is that the individual steps in the triangular lattice<br>are indeed well-represented in equal temperament, and 15:8 is merely a<br>by-product of linking consonant intervals. 15:8 heard alone is indeed a<br>dissonance and so its exact tuning is not crucial.<br><br>Finally, note that the smallest triangles in the rectangular lattice are<br>the major triad, the minor triad, the 15:5:1, and the 15:3:1. Are these<br>equivalent in consonance? I think it is far easier to believe that the<br>major and minor triads are more consonant that the other two, and the<br>triangular lattice expresses this by the more compact geometric<br>representation of the major and minor triads.<br><br>Now, sticking to the 5-limit, we can address the odd vs. prime issue.<br>Clearly, _any_ two points in the lattice, no matter how distant, form a<br>5-limit interval, if the prime definition is used. If the limit is<br>supposed to be related to dissonance/complexity, that should mean that<br>any two points on the lattice form a more consonant interval than an<br>8:7. But this is absurd. In fact, I would consider 9:8 slighlty more<br>dissonant than 8:7, if heard in isolation. The Partch theory calls the<br>former a 9-limit interval, correctly expressing its more complex nature.<br>The claim that 27:16, heard in isolation, has a certain 3-limit quality<br>to it, is nonsense to me, and is probably nothing more than a result of<br>familiarity with the effects of Pythagorean tuning, and of listening to<br>chords like 27:9:3:1. Relative primality is all that matters to the ear;<br>absolute primality of the terms in a ratio can have no conceivable<br>importance to the auditory phenomenon, and 27:16 differs materially from<br>23:16 or 29:16 only in the simpler ratios they approximate (i.e., we are<br>essentially getting into issues of temperament).<br><br>It's hard to try to discuss these issues seperately since they are all<br>>so intertwined . . .<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 1 Jul 1997 12:16 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00391; Tue, 1 Jul 1997 12:16:22 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 1 Jul 1997 12:16:22 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00389<br>Received: (qmail 4850 invoked from network); 1 Jul 1997 10:15:26 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 1 Jul 1997 10:15:26 -0000<br>Message-Id: <009B69A0B034BCFE.99DA@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5752 href="#5752">ðŸ”—</a>gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)</h3><span>7/5/1997 6:03:38 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Paul Erlich said:<br>>Graham, I am puzzled by your statement that these two four note chords<br>>are complete chords of a nature which would seem to require them to be<br>>six-note chords.
