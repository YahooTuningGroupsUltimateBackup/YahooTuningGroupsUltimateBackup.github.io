I<br>listened to Sun Ra's music for a year (on the advice of a friend) before I<br>"got" it. Some music is mostly valuable in its contribution to the<br>intellect.<br><br>Personally I find Ornette Colman and Partch to be mostly music that appeals<br>to musicians, good theorists but not something listened to often. This is<br>why I'm a big fan of Miles Davis. His music was intellectual and swinging<br>and those qualities together are where it's at. I don't mean that Coleman<br>or Partch are not important. Sun Ra said he never heard any music he didn't<br>enjoy, but Duke Ellington said "It don't mean a thing if it don't swing."<br>Some jazz guy said "To play jazz you have to learn the theory and develop<br>the chops and then forget them."<br><br>My epiphany came listening to the Mahavishnu Orchestra. The emotional<br>experience was so overwhelming it was life changing. It is why I am here,<br>hoping that this tuning thing will be the nest for the epiphanies of the<br>future.<br><br>A last quote (for Gary): Someone once asked a young Duke Ellington what<br>kind of music he was playing. Ellington replied "Its juss music man, juss<br>music." Juss became jass or jazz.<br><br>Doren<br>hyperpoodle@sisna.com<br>Los Angeles Mvsevm of the Modern Poodle<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 5 Jun 1996 21:23 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA10698; Wed, 5 Jun 1996 12:23:22 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 5 Jun 1996 12:23:22 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960605122029.13462F-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
