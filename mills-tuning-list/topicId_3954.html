Interestingly, you've split the 1:1-to-9:8 and 3:2-to-27:16 in this<br>example 15:14 first, whereas the others are split 21:20 first (going from low<br>to high pitch).  That would put some like intervals next to each other (eg.,<br>the two adjacent 21:20s on either side of the 9:8). Is there a historical<br>and/or logical reason for doing it that way?  One "problem" with it is that it<br>would yeild intervals involving 7^2 in some modes, and those are pretty<br>difficult for the ear to digest IMHO (21^2:20^2 = 7^2*3^2:5*2^2).  I've been<br>splitting all of them one direction in any given tuning; that keeps all<br>diatonic intervals in all modes down to one 7 apiece.  Here's an example; left<br>column is the intervals between each member of the tuning, middle column is<br>the intervals from 1:1, right colum is cents:<br><br>1:1		1:1			0.00<br>21:20		21:20		84.47<br>15:14		9:8			203.91<br>21:20		189:160	288.38<br>15:14		81:64		407.82<br>256:243	4:3			498.05<br>21:20		7:5			582.51<br>15:14		3:2			701.96<br>21:20		63:40		786.42<br>15:14		27:16		905.87<br>21:20		567:320	990.33<br>15:14		243:128	1109.78<br>256:243	2:1			1200.00<br><br>Its sister tuning would swap all the septimal intervals in the left column.  I<br>also have generated versions in which the 256:243s are a m3 and a m2 apart<br>instead of the usual P4, as above.<br><br>>The idea of leaving the Pythagorean whole-tones (9:8) and diatonic<br>>semitones at e-f and b-c' (256:243) unaltered, but changing the<br>>divisions of the whole-tones into semitones, occurs in some medieval<br>>and Renaissance sources.<br><br>Ah, wonderful. I'm delighted to know that there's an actual connection to<br>"early" music theory.<br><br>>However, these schemes tend either to minimize the contrast between<br>>the usual Pythagorean diatonic and chromatic semitones [snip]<br>>In contrast, your scheme slightly accentuates the difference between<br>>the diatonic and chromatic semitones, respectively 21:20 (about 84.5<br>>cents) and 15:14 (about 119.4 cents).<br><br>Yes, deeper colors are what I'm after.  Please forgive this elementary<br>question: What makes one diatonic and the other chromatic?<br><br>>Apart from adding a bit of extra<br>>contrast, this tuning has the advantage of not drastically<br>>compromising the fifths Bb-F and B-F#'[snip]<br>>...The actual compromise of 5.76 cents or<br>>so, a bit less than 1/4 Pythagorean comma, should be much less<br>>disadvantageous.<br><br>Good point.  That would be an advantage in a static tuning.  Since my music is<br>fantastical rather than historical, I allow myself to shift the tuning center<br>as needed to get pure fifths, and to get seconds and thirds with colors<br>appropriate to the mood of the piece.  Now if only I can find a real Celtic<br>harp player who's willing to retune for every piece! :-)<br><br>Thanks, Margo!  You've done an excellent job analyzing the idea behind my<br>"new" tunings, and given me some more insight into their appropriateness and<br>usefulness.<br><br>Since you seem interested in these ideas, here's a related 11-limit tuning<br>concept that uses all 4 primes:  Take a cycle of 3:2s (4 or so) and split them<br>each into 7:6 and 9:7; then split each 7:6 into 11:10 and 35:33, and each 9:7<br>into 8:7 and 9:8; then octave-reduce.
