Today, I would like to take the stronger position that<br>while MDL does have the *appearence* of a well defined psycho-<br>acoustic term, the idea is actually quite ambiguous.<br><br>To bring this into focus, consider the following two experiments:<br><br>Experiment (1): C D E D C<br><br>Experment (2):  C C C D C<br><br>Suppose first that these notes are given their normal 12-tet<br>meanings. We can explore the MDL in experiment (1) by minutely<br>adjusting the frequencies of the tones. As the extensive previous<br>discussion on this list suggests, very small changes in pitch do not<br>cause a different melody to be perceived, while large changes will<br>cause a different melody to be heard. While the exact values needed<br>to change the melody will undoubtedly differ depending on which<br>note is changed, who is listening, the timbre of the tones, etc., a value<br>of 1/3 tone for a MDL does indeed seems reasonable.<br><br>[Digression: Say the E note is slowly flattened. The melody with E at<br>200 cents above D is surely heard as the same as the melody with E<br>199 cents above D, is the same as the melody 198 cents above D, etc.,<br>and thus there is a continuum of minute changes, each of which is<br>judged the same. Yet at the extreme they are judged different. This<br>suggests one interesting kind of "modulation" that is possible in<br>tunings that have very fine pitch gradations... the "same" melody can<br>be "repeated" over and over, yet at the end of the repeats it is a<br>"different" melody. Has anyone explored this compositional idea?]<br><br>Now consider experiment (2). Say that the D note is 10 cents above<br>the C note. Such a 10 cent difference is clearly audible (no extreme<br>"hypersensitivity" is required - all we're talking about here is the<br>ability to perceive that the pitches are different), and the melody is<br><br>X X X up X<br><br>But if the D note was 10 cents *below* the C (if you excuse the<br>notation), then the melody is<br><br>X X X down X<br><br>which is indeed a very different melody!  Of course, if the D were<br>perceptibly the same as C, the melody would be<br><br>X X X X X<br><br>which is different yet again. This highlights the idea that the<br>*contour* of a melody is aurally far more significant than the details<br>of the pitches. The reason the MDL appears large in experiment (1) is<br>because the contour of the melody does not change, but the MDL<br>appears very small in experiment (2) because the contour does<br>change. Thus the MDL is very different depending on the musical<br>context (in this case the contour of the melody) in which it is<br>investigated. Surely, one should not wish to choose a tuning system<br>based on only a small subset of possible melodic contexts.<br><br>Bill Sethares<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Arabs and the 17-tone equal<br>PostedDate:  18-12-97 17:45:18<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  18-12-97 17:43:13-18-12-97 17:43:13,18-12-97 17:42:50-18-12-97 17:42:50<br>DeliveredDate:  18-12-97 17:42:50<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256571.005BD6A9; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 17:45:03 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA31707; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 17:45:18 +0100<br>Date: Thu, 18 Dec 1997 17:45:18 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA31710<br>Received: (qmail 27729 invoked from network); 18 Dec 1997 08:45:14 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 18 Dec 1997 08:45:14 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3499B564.7C02@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
