My apparently false impression that most of the chords are dominant<br>sevenths is based upon a radio interview I heard several years ago with the head<br>of a barbershop quartet.  He described one part as always singing the seventh in<br>a chord.  I presumably misheard him, or misunderstood him.  Whatever...<br><br>   But anyway, my main point, that whether 4:5:6:7 is consonant or dissonant<br>depends on context, I think is valid.  <br><br>   I suppose that that also partly depends on whether one uses the textbook<br>definition of dissonance (a chord demands a certain resolution), or the more<br>common but technically incorrect meaning, that being as a substitute for<br>"discord".  But perhaps that's mostly just a bunch of silly nitpicking.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 10:16 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29707; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 10:17:55 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29483<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id BAA26514; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 01:17:52 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 9 Sep 1996 01:17:52 -0700<br>Message-Id: <01I99FDUHV6Q8YDXP6@delphi.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3579 href="#3579">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/9/1996 9:52:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Harold Fortunin suggests:<br>> Do NOT substitute the 7:4 over V for the diatonic scale degree 4--for melodic<br>> purposes, use 4:3, and for dominant seventh chords, use 7:4 over V. This<br>> practice will not bother anyone who makes use of the dominant seventh chord in<br>> the minor scale.<br><br>   As with your other suggestions, this strikes me as definitely reasonable.<br>This of course raises some interesting wandering-tonic questions in the case of<br>common (i.e., held) scale degree 4 between IV and V7 in a typical I-IV-V7-I<br>progression.  Retaining scale degree 4 as a common tone in that progression, if<br>I recall correctly off the cuff, causes the ending tonic to be 36:35 above the<br>beginning tonic.  <br><br>   On a related side note, in a recent e-mail conversation with Bill Sethares,<br>he told me about the work he's done with generalizing his tuning-timbre<br>interaction discoveries to include dynamically-changing tuning.  Or to state it<br>another way, he's devised algorithms for generalizing the dynamic JI task to<br>other tuning-timbre combinations.  That strikes me as having very exciting<br>possibilities, but I'd probably better not say much more just in case Bill wants<br>to keep it quiet until he publishes his results.  <br><br>   But anyway, in that conversation, I noticed a difference in attitude toward<br>wandering tonics.  He viewed them, in essence, as a problem to be dealt with.<br>By no means do I view that as an inappropriate opinion, but my opinion is<br>exactly the reverse;  I think that wandering tonics have a very fascinating<br>musical effect.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 18:58 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA32254; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 19:00:26 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA32317<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id KAA06299; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 10:00:24 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 9 Sep 1996 10:00:24 -0700<br>Message-Id: <73960909165837/0005695065PK4EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
