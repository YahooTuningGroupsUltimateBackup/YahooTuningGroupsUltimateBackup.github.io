Does anybody<br>know which tunings were used for Organs between 1680-1760 in france? I have<br>read that the most prevalent was mean-tone, but does anyone know what sort<br>of mean-tone system was used, (quarter-comma etc.)? Lastly, what sort of<br>modulatory compromises would the composer needed to have made?<br><br>many thanks<br><br><br>Stephen Baysted<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 19 May 1997 18:36 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05473; Mon, 19 May 1997 18:36:51 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 19 May 1997 18:36:51 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05466<br>Received: (qmail 22847 invoked from network); 19 May 1997 16:36:47 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 19 May 1997 16:36:47 -0000<br>Message-Id: <970519122929_1458209577@emout15.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
