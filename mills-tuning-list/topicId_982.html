Anyway, a Swingle Singers <br>recording of Ben Johnston's music was mentioned. Apparantly Ben approved of <br>their intonation. Anyone know how I can get a hold of a copy of this? I was <br>brainwashed as a kid into loving the Swingle Singers. Speaking of them, and <br>off the subject of tuning, who did the first jazzy interpretations of Bach? <br>The Modern Jazz Quartet? Jazzy Bach was a trick that every prog-rock band <br>had know, listen to Jethro Tull, Yes, etc., but only Focus took it a step <br>further and wrote their own jazzy neo-Baroque suites. Score one more for the <br>Dutch for musical creativity!<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 7 Oct 1996 18:49 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04331; Mon, 7 Oct 1996 17:51:14 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04336<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA07016; Mon, 7 Oct 1996 09:51:10 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 7 Oct 1996 09:51:10 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9610071200.A24257-0100000@email.ir.miami.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
