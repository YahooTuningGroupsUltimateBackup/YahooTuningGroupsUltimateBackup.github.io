I downloaded Roland's Virtual Sound Canvass and <br>>      was impressed with it.<br>>      <br>>      I'm learning this west African instrument called the balafon (type of<br>> <br>>      marimba). My teacher is a master balafonist from Guinea. I've been <br>>      introducing him to MIDI technology as a tool he can used to test out <br>>      some of his arrangements/compositions. He really loves it.<br>>      <br>>      As you might have guessed tuning is a problem. He can't play his <br>>      instrument with his MIDI arrangements, since the balafon tuning can't<br>> <br>>      be adjusted. <br>>           <br>>      It seems like the Pitch Palette microtuning software from Justonic is<br>> <br>>      what I need, since it can retune the Virtual Sound Canvass to the <br>>      tuning of the balafon. Can this be done?<br>>      <br>> <br>I've used Pitch Palette and it would make retuning easier, but it's main<br>application is in realtime pitch table changes and modulations.  It might be<br>overkill for what you're trying to do.  The Synth Help page at my web site<br>has a page on GS/Sound Canvas MIDI tuning codes generously contributed by<br>Ben Tubb.  I also have a link to the Roland GS MIDI System Exclusive<br>specification.  My web site is at:  http://freeweb.pdq.net/jloffink .  You<br>should be able to create a short MIDI message that you could embed into any<br>sequencer program to retune the Virtual Sound Canvas.<br><br>John Loffink<br>jloffink@pdq.net</div>
