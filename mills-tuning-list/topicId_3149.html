His<br>theoretical and notational concepts are very similar to my own, which I<br>call JustMusic (TM).<br><br>One of the fundamental ideas in Mathieu's conception is that  we don't<br>have to search too hard to find where the simpler ratios are in the<br>pitch-continuum -- we can learn to sing them fairly easily  because they<br>resonate in our body cavities and in the objects around us, giving a<br>quite direct experience of the unique power and sound of each of them as<br>we sing them.<br> <br>I've bought a copy of the book and have perused it, but haven't had the<br>time for a proper reading, as I am working to finish writing my own. <br>Much of his notational philosophy is indeed very similar to mine.<br><br>=======================================<br>Re: Topic No. 2, "prime limits"<br><br>As you may read below, my tuning theories are founded upon the idea that<br>each prime number given or implied in a musical ratio (compared to some<br>reference) lends a unique and distinctive aspect to the sound of that<br>ratio.<br><br>Just as quantum physics has discovered that there is an uncertainty<br>principle involved in trying to describe what happens to sub-atomic<br>particles, after boiling ratios down to their irreducible components,<br>what is left is the series of prime numbers -- a series the ordering and<br>pattern of which no one has yet been able to discover.  I believe it is<br>quite possible that the prime series exhibits the same kind of randomness<br>as sub-atomic physics, thus all of our human ordering and patterning of<br>musical sounds is based on a given property which is random.  If there is<br>any weight to this idea, it may be worth exploring further -- it ties in<br>with Ancient Greek and Medieval European ideas about the "Music of the<br>Cosmos".  I think it presents some interesting philosophical questions.<br><br>==========================================<br>Re: Topic No. 2, "a standard notational which can capture any tuning..."<br><br>This has been the whole focus behind the development of my theory. <br>Unfortunately, I haven't found a way to reconcile the differences between<br>just-intonation and temperament.  However, I have narrowed it to those<br>two types of  "accidental".  Within each of these two broad families,<br>each respective notation can represent any given tuning in a clear,<br>simple manner, from one given unique reference point.  This makes it<br>possible to level any number of different intonational philosophies to<br>the same analytical playing field.<br><br>I base both of my notational systems on the standard line-space/ letter<br>name/ sharp-flat European notation -- thus, trained musicians have no<br>difficulty finding the 12-equal (or perhaps more correctly, the<br>Pythagorean) note which falls closest to the desired frequency.<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>For any equal temperament, this is supplemented by a root sign with the<br>appropriate roots and exponents of 2. For meantone, a combination of<br>roots and ratios is used.  I'm limited to representing it in email<br>because it's difficult to show roots and powers, but as an example (just<br>replace the verbal description of the expression with mathematical<br>symbols):<br><br>Middle-C in 12-equal is:<br>     the 12th root of 2 to the 0 power = 1, the unity.<br><br>E above Middle-C in 12-equal is:<br>     the 12th root of 2 to the 4 power (= 400 cents = the 4th semitone<br>above C)<br><br>E above Middle-C in 1/4 comma Meantone is:<br>     th 4/4 root (= 1 or identity root) of 5/4, which equals 5/4 itself<br><br>A above Middle-C in 1/4 comma Meantone is:<br>     the 4/3 root of 5/2<br><br>D above Middle-C (i.e., the "mean tone") in 1/4 comma Meantone is:<br>     the 4/2 root (= square root) of 5/2<br><br>G above Middle-C in 1/4 comma Meantone is:<br>     the 4/1 root (= 4th root) of 5<br><br>Middle-C in 1/4 comma Meantone is:<br>     the 4/0 root of 5 -- an impossiblity, which equals no root, which<br>equals 1, the unity.<br><br>------------------------------------<br><br>For just-intonation, the accidental consists of the series of prime<br>nubmers above 2 used as bases, with positive, zero, or negative exponents<br>for each prime.  The idea is similar to Ben Johnston's notational<br>philosophy, but my reference scale is not the mixed diatonic using ratios<br>of 3 AND 5, but rather the 3-limit scale only.<br><br>In actual musical notation, it is least clumsly to eliminate all primes<br>which have a zero exponent as they are equal to 1 and do not affect the<br>product of the multiplication, and also to eliminate prime-base 3, as the<br>letter-name and sharp-flat aspect of the notation already represents the<br>3-Limit or Pythagorean scale.  <br><br>Thus, as examples:<br><br> - the G a 3/2 above Middle-C is written:  G 3^1 (3 to the 1st power)<br><br> - the E  a 5/4 above Middle-C is written: E 5^1 (5 to the 1st power)<br><br> - the Eb a 7/6 above Middle-C is written:  Eb 3^ -1  7^1 (3 to the minus<br>1, 7 to the first)<br><br>-  the B# which has the monstrous ratio of 2025/1024 above Middle-C, and<br>which is the tritone of the tritone, is in JustMusic simply written:  B# <br>3^4  5^2<br><br><br>In mathematical calculations, it is easiest to assume the series of prime<br>bases 3, 5, 7, 11... as a given, and notate only the exponents -- this<br>time including the zero exponents as place-holders.  Interval<br>calculations can be done by simple Matrix Addition, rather than<br>complicated multiplications of fractions.<br><br>Also, by factoring out the powers of 2 as being unnecessary for the<br>purpose of determing pitch-CLASS, the ratios are made much simpler, and<br>the important prime components are more clearly exposed.  Including the<br>powers of 2 gives an absolute frequency precisely.  (Notating Partch's<br>music this way makes it a lot easier to analyze)<br><br>In my JustMusic system, powers of 2 may be represented in either of two<br>ways:<br><br>- 2 to the 0 power may equal 1 Hz, with each ascending "octave" of C<br>being the next higher power of 2.  The notes audible to humans fall in<br>the approximate range of 2 to the 4th power (= 16 Hz) to a couple of<br>semitones above 2 to the 14th power (approximately 20,000 Hz).<br><br>- alternatively, 2 to the 0 power may represent "Middle-C", with the four<br>audible octaves below it being 2 to the -1, -2, -3, and -4 powers<br>respectively, and the octaves above middle C being the corresponding<br>positive exponents of 2.  I find this method to be conceptually more<br>viable.<br><br>In addition to working on completing my book, I have just submitted an<br>intial article for publication.  If anyone would like me to send a copy<br>via regular mail,  let me know, and send a check for $3 to cover my<br>reproduction and mailing costs.  Also, I'd like to enlist the help of<br>those capable to design a web site.  Anyone interested in corresponding<br>may feel free to email or call anytime.<br><br>[By the way, Ezra Sim's notation is a 72-equal system, but his harmonic<br>basis is implied 37-limit (sometimes higher) just-intonation.  As far as<br>notational systems go, his is clear and concise (simpler than mine), the<br>step-size is only 16 and 3/4 cents, and the 72-equal degrees fall mighty<br>close to all of the ratios he is representing.  Johnny Reinhard uses a<br>multiplicity of notational concepts, because he is a "polymicrotonalist",<br>using a wide variety of both just and equal tunings, frequently in the<br>same piece.]<br><br>   Joseph L.
