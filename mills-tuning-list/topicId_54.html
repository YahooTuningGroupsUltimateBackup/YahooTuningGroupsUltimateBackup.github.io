Their other offerings sound as if<br>they would be of interest to members of the TUNING List so I have<br>appended a drastically shortened and edited notice below. Email<br>eMUSIC for prices and more information.<br> <br><The Cage discography is the first of our subject catalogs.  In the next few<br><months, you can expect to see catalogs on microtonal music, pioneers of<br><electronic music, words and music, transformed sounds, improvisation, and<br><more.<br> <br><You'll also see a variety of special catalogs from time to time.  Coming<br><soon: a Larry Austin birthday tribute, with the entire CDCM catalog at sale<br><prices; a group of special publisher offers; and "Discs Warren Burt has Known<br><and Loved."<br> <br> For information on how to order CDs, Email to:  eMusc@aol.com<br>Fax to:  (518) 434-0308, Telephone to:  (518) 434-4110<br>Hard mail and carrier pigeon to:  eMUSIC, 116 North Lake Avenue, Albany NY<br>12206, USA<br> <br> <br><Joel Chadabe<br><President<br><eMUSIC is a trademark of Electronic Music Foundation, Inc.<br><Electronic Music Foundation<br><116 North Lake Avenue<br><Albany NY 12206 USA<br> <br> <br>--John<br> <br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 30 Sep 1995 05:30 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id UAA07589; Fri, 29 Sep 1995 20:30:16 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 29 Sep 1995 20:30:16 -0700<br>Message-Id: <01HVV6YCI85U8Y7G52@delphi.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
