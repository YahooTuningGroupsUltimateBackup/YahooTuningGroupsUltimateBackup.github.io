Sonic Bloom is a 30 min. algorithmic piece for synth, I<br>use a Roland guitar synth as a controller and various digital delays to<br>sustain the notes. While SB is based on a<br>seven note scale of 1/1, 9/8, 7/6, 11/8, 3/2, 13/8, 7/4 - the work also<br>has a lot to do with the synth patch I devised, a grand piano with<br>the attack rolled off. What was originally a quiet piece with pauses<br>and space when I conceived it in Fall '97, Sonic Bloom turned into a<br>thunderous wall of rumbling piano in the week of rehearsals before<br>the premiere.<br><br>Festival attendance was down from previous years, my guess is<br>that festival organizers just couldn't get it together this year.<br><br>Virgil Moorefield's 48tet free improv. band played out in the park,<br>I just barely caught the end of his set.<br><br><br>--<br>* D a v i d        B e a r d s l e y<br>*           xouoxno@virtulink.com<br>*<br>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br>*<br>* http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</div>
