There is also a look at why<br>we have eq temperaments in the first place. I want to emphasize that<br>this is definitely for folks who are just getting involved with alter-<br>nate tunings...it is a "street" musician's look at the subject, and has<br>some basic, and very necessary, information...there's no complex equa-<br>tions, it's easy to read, and even has a few fingering charts for<br>guitarists (but the book is for any instrumentalist).<br>I'm selling it for $10:00...you can email me, or write Box 150271,<br>Lakewood, Colo. 80215 (303-477-3268)...<br>Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 28 Sep 1996 11:31 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00370; Sat, 28 Sep 1996 11:31:17 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12402<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id CAA18088; Sat, 28 Sep 1996 02:31:15 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 28 Sep 1996 02:31:15 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199609280530_MC1-9EA-5993@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
