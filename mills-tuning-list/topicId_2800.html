However,  if the 19-tone octave is stretched by 2-3 cents, its<br>>} fifths become quite as good as those of the 31-tone.<br>><br>>My calculations indicate that 2-3 cents is indeed the optimal amount of<br>>stretching for the 19-tone octave in order to maximize the overall consonance<br>>of intervals which are approximations of ratios using numbers no higher than<br>>6 (including the octave and double octave). This stretching results in what<br>>can be called 18.96TET. The consonance, relative to JI, of 19TET is 94.53%,<br>>while that of 18.96TET is 96.87%. However, 31TET is better at 97.30%, and<br>>30.98TET (31-tone octave streched by just under a cent) is still better at<br>>97.48%.<br>><br>>By way of comparison, I get 85.07% for 12TET, and 86.70% for 12.02TET<br>>(12-tone octave reduced by 2 cents). It appears that the ear prefers<br>>stretched octaves as an equivalence interval anyway, especially for tones<br>>with weak harmonic content, or piano tones where the harmonics are slighly<br>>stretched, so adjusting the octave to increase consonance seems more viable<br>>in cases such as 19TET, where the octave needs to be increased, than 12TET,<br>>where the octave needs to be decreased.<br>><br>>22TET gets a 92.21% score, and 22.01TET a 92.24% score, by this measure.<br>>However, increasing the highest number allowed in the ratios from 6 to 8, we<br>>get the following scores:<br>><br>>12.00TET -- 54.48%<br>>12.06TET -- 61.56%<br>>19.00TET -- 79.28%<br>>18.94TET -- 83.84%<br>>22.00TET -- 87.68%<br>>22.03TET -- 88.77%<br>>31.00TET -- 98.037%<br>>30.99TET -- 98.043%<br>><br>>(15 and 27 could also fit in this sequence of increasing consonance).<br>><br>>The above assumes that the ear assesses intervals with a resolution of 1%.<br>>Changing this assumption does not change the rank-order of the results; only<br>>the absolute consonance levels depend on this assumption.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
