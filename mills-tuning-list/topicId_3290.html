The partials are of course in small integer<br>> ratios to one another, so one could think of this as very rudimentary<br>> JI.<br>> <br>	[Loffink, John]  I would not call this microtonal.  It is just the<br>common filter sweep used by all "space music" artists.  The partials are<br>harmonic, but the chords that underly them never are.  Robert Rich and<br>Michael Stearns are the only ones doing space music with real microtonal<br>intervals.   All the others are most definitely confined within normal 12TET<br>composition, even though just intonation would be most appropriate for this<br>music, in my opinion.</div>
