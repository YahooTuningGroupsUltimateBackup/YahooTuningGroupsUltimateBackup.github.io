Such a dog unit!<br><br>All this talk about FB01's... I don't really know anything about them, but<br>I've been told that they're a little more than "dog unit"s.  Retuning is<br>apparently much more effective with pitch bends than with Sysex messages.<br>Here's what Jules Siegel once told me...<br><br>>>4 FB01s ... The FBs have a quirk which allows you to have multiple<br>>>voices with different pitchbends on a single channel ... All it is, is<br>>>that once the note-off comes, the fb01 ignores further bend msgs for<br>>>that note.  So a  new note can be started after a different bend is<br>>>sent.  You need to use a patch with a long decay, and not be in<br>>>monophonic mode.  The multiple notes can come so fast that they don't<br>>>even sound like the arpeggios that they actually are.  Note that<br>>>sending a different patch immediately chops off all sounding notes on<br>>>the channel. You can send a series of midi volume events if you need to<br>>>stop the notes more gracefully, and the voice decay would make them<br>>>sound for too long.<br><br>Carl</div>
