Individual neurons can fire up to 1000 time/sec.<br>The volley theory says that groups of neurons cooperate in response to<br>higher frequencies( for example, to<br>represent 2000 Hz, 2 neurons could fire at 1000 Hz each, 180 degrees out<br>of phase with each other) Such cooperation has been shown up to about 4000<br>Hz.<br><br>2. In general, there are two ways in which sounds are differentiated by<br>the ear.<br><br>a. Place theory:  The basilar membrane is shaped like a very long<br>triangle.  Each region resonates at a different frequency.  Consequently,<br>the place on the basilar membrane that gets most excited in response to<br>any incoming sound wave provides information about the frequency.<br><br>b.Frequency theory:  Individual neurons fire at the rate of the incoming<br>sound.(Or groups, as per the volley theory.)<br><br>The place theory does not hold below about 500 Hz, and the frequency<br>theory does not hold above about 4000Hz.  Between 500 and 4000 hz, both<br>mechanisms play a role.<br><br>3.  Some kind of higher processing occurs which enables the brain to infer<br>a fundamental from a set of sufficiently defined harmonics.</div>
