That obviously depends on the piece in question.<br>Although many would answer "Just Intonation" to this question, there are<br>many examples where JI is not ideal. The 6/9 chord is one recently<br>discussed example; another is the chord 0 9 13 18 in 22tET, where the<br>ambiguity between the 3-limit and 7-limit is much like that of the<br>3-limit and 5-limit in the former chord. But let us leave these<br>ambiguous harmonies aside for the moment.<br><br>Wandering tonics are another typical example used against JI renditions<br>of many common-practice pieces. However, one can keep each individual<br>chord in JI while distributing the comma over all the melodic intervals<br>-- essentially, tune the melodic sequence roots in meantone temperament<br>and the chord over each root in JI. Since the just noticeable difference<br>for melody is much greater than that for harmony, this is clearly a<br>better-sounding (though difficult to perform) solution than straight<br>meantone. The truly optimal solution (if "badness" is quadratic in<br>tuning error, and harmonic tuning errors are weighted several times more<br>than melodic ones) would be to shade the JI chords ever-so-slightly<br>toward meantone, so as to reduce the melodic shifts further while<br>introducing a negligible amount of roughness into the chords.<br><br>In general, melodies operate within certain pitch sets and auxiliaries<br>to these sets. Again, the allowable mistuning for these melodic pitch<br>sets is greater than that for chords. One can envision a computer<br>program which then optimizes the tuning of a piece by minimizing some<br>overall "badness" function of these mistunings.<br><br>Even the ambiguous chords above can be handled in such a scheme; each<br>consonant harmonic interval is associated with one and only one just<br>ratio, and an overall error function is minimized. For example, in the<br>6/9 chord, there are four perfect fifths, two minor thirds, and one<br>major third, each of which should approach simple 5-limit ratios. If we<br>weight all 7 errors equally, and find the least-squared-error solution,<br>one constructs the chord using perfect fifths of 696.3 cents. If one<br>weights the errors in proportion to the odd limit, one constructs the<br>chord using perfect fifths of 695.9 cents. If one weights the errors in<br>inverse proportion to the odd limit, one constructs the chord using<br>perfect fifths of 697.2 cents. In the other chord, there are three 3/2s,<br>two 7/4s, and one 7/6. The optimal perfect fifths: Equal-weighting --<br>711.5 cents; Odd-Limit-weighting -- 712.8 cents;<br>Inverse-Odd-Limit-weighting -- 707.7 cents. In any case, the melodic<br>context will typically cause all the pitches to be altered slightly, but<br>probably not very much, since melodic tuning errors are less important<br>than harmonic ones.<br><br>(A word on those weighting schemes -- the Odd-Limit-weighting concerns<br>the ability of the intervals to evoke certain simple ratios rather than<br>more complex ones, while the Inverse-Odd-Limit-weighting may better<br>represent the overall level of consonance. Where both factors are<br>considered important, Equal-weighting may be a good compromise.</div>
