But since music and tuning may work in<br>subtle ways, it might be worth while to look at how subtle causes can have<br>non-subtle effects.<br><br>One example of this is in the sensitivity to outside forces of systems near a<br>critical point. The classic example is a magnet, which can be modeled as a<br>huge matrix of little spins. At high temperature the little spins bounce all<br>over, and the huge matrix ends up without any large scale average. At low<br>temperature neighboring spins better follow their tendency to line up with<br>their neighbors, and the whole matrix ends up with a magnetic direction. Of<br>course this direction could wind up in any direction. This is called symmetry<br>breaking. Somehow the matrix "picks" a direction to point in. <br><br>Now, right at the transition, the matrix is picking which way to point. Right<br>there, the matrix becomes "infinitely" sensitive to external forces. Here's<br>a place where an arbitrarily small force can have a large effect.<br><br>I don't mean to say that astrology has any validity, but I think it's<br>worthwhile to get the arguments straight. For example, could the position of<br>mars at one's time of birth have any effect? <br><br>Well, we could view the whole social and biological system on earth as being<br>like a bit matrix of "spins". This system might be, in some ways, at a<br>critical point. Books like Kaufmann's AT HOME IN THE UNIVERSE show how<br>biological systems might work to keep themselves right at the fertile<br>critical point. Life is where the action is! So the entire ecological system<br>could be extremely sensitive to external forces. It's easy to see diurnal<br>rhythms in biological systems, but of course the sun's influence is hardly<br>microscopic. But note that what time of day a person is born matters not just<br>because of the risk of infantile sunburn. The whole mood in the delivery room<br>would be different at 3AM vs. 3PM. And then one's first hours of discovery of<br>the world would be met with either an ascending or a descending level of<br>activity. <br><br>Similarly, the moon we know causes tides. And the tides get bigger and<br>smaller on a (semi-) monthly cycle. The effect on an individual is not only<br>the direct gravitational effect. Perhaps the local fishing village changes<br>its rhythym of activity to follow the tides. One might then be born into a<br>time of more or less activity, or more or less food. <br><br>I really like Bruno Latour's vision of science in his book SCIENCE IN<br>ACTION. He talks about the two faces of science. One face is open and<br>curious, always willing to take a fresh look, always willing to revisit and<br>retest every hypothesis. The other face is the established authority with its<br>great store of accumulated knowledge and experience. Perhaps the fertility of<br>science comes from the interplay between these two aspects. <br><br>Jim<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 18 Mar 1997 20:02 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04926; Tue, 18 Mar 1997 20:02:31 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04922<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id KAA19431; Tue, 18 Mar 1997 10:56:36 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 18 Mar 1997 10:56:36 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703181853.KAA19224@ella.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
