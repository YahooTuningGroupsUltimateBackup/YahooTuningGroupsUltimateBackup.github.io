Indeed the linear series 1 2 3 4 5 6 (7) 8 9 10<br>can be fully formed in the JI scale [(7) needs a special blues flat].<br><br>This is something from my WWW site which investigates the steps between<br>notes which are also of course the beats...<br><br>Harmonics & Beats are better with Just Intonation. <br><br>One of the really nice things about the just intonation scale is that<br>the beats between notes are in the scale, whereas for 12T equitempered<br>tuning they miss by quite a lot. I am using "beats" here a bit loosely<br>because sometimes these beats are in the range of frequencies of notes,<br>not the wa-wa-wa sound we associate with beats. <br><br>First the equitempered scale to show why it doesn't work in this way:<br><br>note      do      re      mi      fa      so      la      ti      do<br>Freq.   1.0000  1.1225  1.2599  1.3348  1.4983  1.6818  1.8877  2.0000<br>Beats       0.1225  0.1374  0.0749  0.1625  0.1835  0.2049  0.1123<br>Beats*8     0.980   1.099   1.198*  1.300   1.468   1.639   1.797*<br>[* means Beats*16]<br>The reason for *8 or *16 is to move the note up 3 or 4 octaves to see<br>where it falls in the scale.<br><br>In this case the beats are not generally in tune with the key. When<br>beats are considered for notes that are 2 or more apart in the scale the<br>situation is even worse.  The same will apply to 19TET etc.<br><br>Now the just intonation scale <br><br>note      do      re      mi      fa      so      la      ti      do<br>Freq.   1.0000  1.1250  1.2500  1.3333  1.5000  1.6667  1.8750  2.0000<br>Beats       0.1250  0.1250  0.0833  0.1667  0.1667  0.2083  0.1250<br>Beats*8     1.000   1.000   1.333*  1.333   1.333   1.667   1.000<br>Note          do      do      fa      fa      fa      la      do<br><br>In this case all the beats are perfectly in tune with the scale itself.<br>When notes 2 or more apart are considered then the situation is still<br>very good. This is more easily expressed by using the ratios of<br>frequencies as shown below: <br><br>note      do  re  mi  fa  so  la  ti  do  re  mi  fa  so  la  ti    <br>Ratio     24  27  30  32  36  40  45  48  54  60  64  72  80  90<br>Beats-1      3   3   2   4   4   5   3   6   6   4   8   8  10<br>Beats-2        6   5   6   8   9   8   9  12  10  12  16  18<br>Beats-3          8   9  10  13  12  14  15  16  18  20  26<br>Beats-4           12  13  15  16  18  20  19  24  26  30<br>Beats-5             16  18  18  22  24  24  27  32  36<br>Beats-6               21  21  24  28  28  32  35  42<br>Beats-7                 24  27  30  32  36  40  45<br><br>What is shown is the relative beat frequency between notes, for example<br>in the "Beats-3" line the 10 is the beats (or difference) between mi=30<br>and la=40. The figures are always up the diagonals to the top line. <br><br>Now what is noticeable is that in most cases the beats are actually<br>perfectly in the scale as follows: <br><br>note      do  re  mi  fa  so  la  ti  do  re  mi  fa  so  la  ti    <br>Beats-1     do  do  fa  fa  fa  la  do ...<br>Beats-2       do  la  do  fa  so  fa  so ...<br>Beats-3         fa  so  la  do# do  mib mi ...<br>Beats-4           do  do# mi  fa  so  la  so# ...<br>Beats-5             fa  so  so  la# do  do  re ...<br>Beats-6               tib tib do  mib mib fa  sob ...<br><br>Where the ... means that the cycle repeats for the next octave. All the<br>notes are perfectly in the key except the ones labelled: do# mib sob so#<br>la# tib. These all fall in the places where there are black notes and<br>the "b" (flat) ones are correct in my view as to what the flat<br>frequencies should be. The "#" (sharp) ones are unusual ratios but then<br>again there is no real meaning to these notes in the key. <br><br>They do have the unusual ratios including 11, 13 and 19. Some of these<br>are produced by the cases like fa-ti (careful how you pronounce that one<br>:-) which is a dreadful chord anyway, and others by the cases like re-la<br>which is our old friend D-A when in C, that is 27-40, which wants to be<br>2-3.<br><br>I would suggest that it would be possible to make some tempered tunings<br>which are not too far from equitempered tunings, but which have beats<br>that are reasonably well in tune.  Has anyone ever investigated this?<br>It might be a fruitful exercise.<br><br>-- Ray Tomes -- rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz -- Harmonics Theory --<br>     http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 22 May 1997 10:20 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07520; Thu, 22 May 1997 10:20:03 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 22 May 1997 10:20:03 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07521<br>Received: (qmail 1223 invoked from network); 22 May 1997 08:19:54 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 22 May 1997 08:19:54 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199705220418_MC2-1712-DDD1@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
