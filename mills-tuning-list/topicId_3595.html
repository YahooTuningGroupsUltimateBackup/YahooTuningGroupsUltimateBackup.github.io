His first instrument<br>was the violin, then as he found other violinists<br>with whom to play, he switched to viola, then<br>finally, to fill out a quartet, to the cello.<br><br>The majority of his earliest *surviving* compositions<br>are piano pieces and songs with piano accompaniment,<br>but he stated himself that *his first pieces, for several<br>years, were composed for his small string ensembles*.<br>I think this is a *very* important factor in his development,<br>as the strings are fretless and allow any pitch to be<br>found.<br><br>Schoenberg stated in "Harmonielehre" that he was basing<br>his "method" on the "possibly uncertain overtone theory"<br>because it agreed well with what he had been able to<br>observe in listening to the great German masterworks.<br>He was, beyond any doubt, a believer in rational pitch<br>relationships.  It is also important to note that he actually<br>did ponder the use of microtonal scales.<br><br>Since TD 1379, when Johnny Reinhard mentioned<br>Schoenberg, I posted a TON of stuff along these lines,<br>and much more detailed, particularly in 1381, 1386,<br>1388, and 1390.  In between, the thread was carried<br>mainly by Reinhard, Paul Erlich, and one important<br>post from Daniel Wolf.<br><br>   Joseph L.
