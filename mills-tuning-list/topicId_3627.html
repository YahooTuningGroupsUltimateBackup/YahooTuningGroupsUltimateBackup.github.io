No doubt, you're all<br>wanting to know what other wildly inccurate assertions I was going<br>to make, so here they are:<br><br>I think these instructions come from Schoenberg, although he<br>wouldn't have described the result as atonality.  The first two<br>clearly imply a avoidance of 7-limit harmony.  5-limit _intervals_<br>are still used.  A 12-note scale is assumed, of course.  Two notes<br>an enharmonic diesis apart are "the same" note.  Applying these<br>rules in 19-eq would give entirely different results, as it's<br>easier to avoid keys without using all 19 notes.  Did Schoenberg<br>ever consider this?<br><br>You can still write some 7-limit chords.  However, there is no<br>bias _towards_ them, like with triads in tonality.  Dominant<br>sevenths are a special case as they strongly define a key centre.<br><br>The Webern Op. 5 is atonal.  There is a bit of repetition, which<br>goes against some definitions of atonality.<br><br>Serialism is generally used to mean composition based on a series<br>of notes/tones.  Specifically, it refers to Schoenberg's method of<br>composition using 12 tones related only to each other.  Here, a<br>whole piece is based on a row containing each of the notes in<br>12-equal exactly once.  That enshrines some of instruction (4)<br>above but says nothing about the other three.  It requires 12<br>nominally equal pitch classes, but does not require them to be<br>tempered.  However, a fixed non-equal scale will not do as the<br>inequality of intervals leads to an inequality of notes.<br><br>According to the CD booklet:<br><br>"The Berg Violin Concerto is said to be the first fully serial<br>concerto, though it has many tonal twists to it.  The soloist<br>announces the series, a succession of rising thirds, topped by<br>a tritone: G, Bb, F#, A, C, E, G#, B, C#, Eb, F."<br><br>I think Wozzeck includes some serial writing, particularly for the<br>doctor, who is a caricature of Schoenberg.  The piece as a whole is<br>atonal.<br><br>Webern's Symphony Op.21 is a good example of atonal serialism.<br><br>Boulez and co. developed something called "total serialism" where<br>factors beyond pitch class, such as rhythm and dynamics, are<br>specified in a serial manner.  Webern's Concerto Op. 24 was taken<br>as the model for total serialism.  Interestingly, I always assumed<br>this piece was the inspiration behind Minimalism before I discovered<br>the real history.  There are a whole load of books I've read where<br>"serialism" is used to refer to Schoenberg's method, although<br>"twelve tone" is also used.  I don't accept that this isn't true<br>serialism.  You can usually tell from the context which sense is<br>intended.</div>
