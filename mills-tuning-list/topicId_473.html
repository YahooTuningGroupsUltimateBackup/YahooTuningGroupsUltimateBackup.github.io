The concert opened with <br>a duet for 'cello and synthesizer in 15-tet by Brian McLaren<br>and Jonathan Glasier. Brian played a chordal accompaniment to<br>Glasiers melodies. The second piece was for synths in Ensoniq's <br>"Arabic 1" tuning. What is this tuning? Nobody seems to know exactly.<br>but whateve it is, it sounded great.  <br><br>The third selection was an ambitious tuned percussion study employing <br>Erv Wilson's aluminum bar "Hebdomekontany" array (the 4)8 [1 3 5 7 9 11 <br>13 15] degenerate 70-any with extra notes added to bring the number back <br>up to 70 pitches per octave. I believe this is the instrument shown at <br>the Hollywood Bowl Museum show several years ago and formerly housed <br>at John Gibbon's Bell Garden, now sadly burnt down. It has been remounted <br>by Glasier recently. Accompanying the hebdomekontany were the Quadulator <br>(Wesley's  new tuned tongue instrument), which I have mentioned <br>elsewhere, <br>cymbals and synth. A visiting musician  from Sedona, AZ named Leonardo <br>collaborated  on the construction of the Q  and played  the cymbals in <br>this piece. <br><br>Bill Wesley was featured in the next set. The first was a a virtuoso<br>performance on the "Rhythm Machine," a large array of infrasonically <br>tuned, weighted metal tongues which rattle against fixed posts. This <br>instrument has a wonderful clattering, chattering, rattling sound in <br>Bill's hands. It is tuned in 4ths and octaves, but most of the<br>pitches are unaudiblly low and generate sounds by striking posts. It<br>was accompanied by Brian on synth and Glasier on a hand beaten drum.<br><br>Bill next performed on his "Nail Violin," an set of large and small<br>nails sticking out a resonator box. It is played by stroking the nail <br>heads  with  rosin-coated fingers. The sound is somewhat reminiscent of <br>the glass harmonica and ranged from flute-like tones to rather breathy<br>and raspy, string-like timbres. Glasier accompanied Bill on a synth in <br>19-tet, using a variety of other timbres.<br><br>The next piece was 17-tet duet for guitar and synthesizer, the latter<br>ably played by Elizabeth Glasier. I may be wrong, but I think this is<br>her first appearance in SAG concerts.<br><br>Wesley returned to perform on his "Array Guitar," nine strings stretched<br>over a board with high frets metal frets. It is played by "hammering on," <br>like the Stick, but the loose strings and high frets allow for wide pitch <br>bending. The sound might be likened to "blues sitar."  BIll also played <br>his "Array Slide," an out-sized slide guitar type of instrument and<br>demonstrated one of his multioctave polyphonic Kalimbas (Mbiras).<br><br>The final piece was the premier of Brian's "Microconcerto for Megalyra<br>and Synthesizer," in 19-tet. The solo passages were played live by Brian <br>on Ivor Darreg's Megalyra (another slide guitar type of instrument)<br>while a computer and synth provided the orchestra. I found the orchestral<br>parts remininiscent of some of Brian's earlier 19-tone music, but he<br>says there was no conscious quotation. It is a very nice piece which I<br>am looking forward to hearing again soon on tape.<br><br>Ralph David Hill was in the audience. Some of you may recall his tapes <br>on Just Intonation that are distributed by the JIN. He lives in San Diego <br>now and has just gotten new and more powerful hardware for synthesis.<br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 10 Jun 1996 21:59 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA25031; Mon, 10 Jun 1996 12:59:11 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 10 Jun 1996 12:59:11 -0700<br>Message-Id: <03960610195430/0005695065PK1EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3052 href="#3052">ðŸ”—</a>PAULE &#x3C;ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/1996 10:42:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>John Maxwell Hobbs wrote:<br><br>>That's probably<br>>what you're hearing that's not subject to the attack and release<br><br>Nah, the tones I heard were higher than the fundamentals of the notes <br>LaMonte was playing, so they couldn't have been difference tones.
