As shown in my recent book "Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum,<br>Scale", such a "dissonance meter'' has implications in music theory, in<br>synthesizer design, in the construction of musical scales and tunings,<br>and in the design of musical instruments.<br><br>The talk then examines some of the signal processing problems that<br>arise when trying to manipulate sounds so as to remain faithful to<br>psychoacoustic principles. These involve complex (and sometimes ill-<br>posed) optimization problems, as well as (nonlinear and/or time<br>varying) algorithms designed to decrease (or increase!) the<br>dissonance of a sound. In particular, we discuss various "spectral<br>mapping" algorithms that try to move the partials of a sound without<br>changing its "character".<br><br>Sound examples are present throughout.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Xou Oxno <xouoxno@virtulink.com><br>Subject:  Newband & the Last Laugh<br>PostedDate:  16-02-98 19:25:17<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  16-02-98 19:24:23-16-02-98 19:24:24,16-02-98 19:22:15-16-02-98 19:22:15<br>DeliveredDate:  16-02-98 19:22:15<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C12565AD.006517D7; Mon, 16 Feb 1998 19:24:12 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04232; Mon, 16 Feb 1998 19:25:17 +0100<br>Date: Mon, 16 Feb 1998 19:25:17 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04225<br>Received: (qmail 1288 invoked from network); 16 Feb 1998 10:24:19 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 16 Feb 1998 10:24:19 -0800<br>Message-Id: <34E8ADFC.3DD6@virtulink.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
