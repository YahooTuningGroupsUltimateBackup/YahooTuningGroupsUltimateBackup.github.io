If planck constant states<br>>that energy states can exist only in discrete steps does this apply to<br>>Frequency generated by a single physical system. In other words is a<br>>glissando not a glissando but minute little steps whole number multiples<br>>of a vibration detated by Planck Constant.If so, what is the octive<br>>equivalent of this fundamental?!<br><br>My physics is a bit rusty, but quantum mechanics doesn't work this way. Some<br>systems have nice discrete energy levels, other systems have continuous levels,<br>other systems have a combination of the two. Seems like it's when a system has<br>some kind of boundary that the discrete levels arise. This is just like a<br>conventional oscillating system like a string. An infinitely long string would<br>not have an overtone series, it could vibrate at any frequency. Put ends on<br>the string, now you have a discrete set of modes of oscillation.<br><br>The bounds don't have to be so fixed though. A simple oscillator like a mass<br>and a spring, that's the classic example of a system with discrete energy<br>levels, all nice and evenly spaced just like an overtone series. The hydrogen<br>atom is another classic. It has a bunch of unevenly spaced discrete levels for<br>the states where the electon is in a bound orbit, and then a whole continuous<br>range of levels where the electron is wandering around unbound.<br><br>My first introduction to quantum mechanics was from a book my high school<br>chemistry teacher (Mr. St. John, really a great inspiration in my life) loaned<br>me. It had a bunch of pictures that made the analogy between quantum systems<br>and classical oscillating systems like drum heads. I think your basic<br>intuition, that the discrete levels of quantum systems have some connection to<br>music, is correct. Of course the devil is in the details!<br><br>Jim<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com><br>Subject:  Top Ten<br>PostedDate:  29-12-97 18:26:07<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  29-12-97 18:23:46-29-12-97 18:23:47,29-12-97 18:23:11-29-12-97 18:23:12<br>DeliveredDate:  29-12-97 18:23:12<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125657C.005F8D70; Mon, 29 Dec 1997 18:25:37 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA26747; Mon, 29 Dec 1997 18:26:07 +0100<br>Date: Mon, 29 Dec 1997 18:26:07 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA26135<br>Received: (qmail 24533 invoked from network); 29 Dec 1997 09:26:03 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 29 Dec 1997 09:26:03 -0800<br>Message-Id: <19971229172634031.AAA220@ascend558.nni.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
