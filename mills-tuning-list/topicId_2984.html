In the spirit of a new year, it would be<br>> nice to hear from all of you what microtonal instruments you own and<br>> play, and how you obtained/modified these instruments.<br><br>---------I've got two fixed pitch instruments-----------<br><br>1) 6 foot grand piano (will soon be tuned Justly, but is now in 12)<br><br>2) Cosmolyra (built from scratch for about $100 under the guidance of Denny<br>Genovese at the Southeast Just Intonation Center)...<br> a) Two-sided electric slide guitar after Ivor's Hobnailed Newell Post<br> b) May be stood on end, on the floor, and played on either side<br> c) May be put on side, on a table, and flipped to get at either side<br> d) 33" of pine 2 x 6 (body) plus 1.5" (stands) is 34.5" total length<br> e) String length 26", Harmonic 4 is the 12-tone F# below A=110<br> f) 13 strings on side one, tuned to harmonics 4-16<br> g) 15 strings on side two, tuned in three groups...<br>                6 in a otonal hexad<br>                6 in a utonal hexad<br>                3 in unison on harmonic 16 (chorus effect for melody)<br><br> h) Body is marked on each side with 2 octaves of each of the following...<br>        otonal: 1/1    9/8   5/4  11/8  3/2  13/8  7/4  15/8  2/1<br>        utonal: 1/1  12/11  6/5  4/3    3/2      12/7         2/1<br><br> i) Use of piano tuning pins in red oak and custom steel tail (with holes to<br>catch gromets on strings) allows high degree of tuning accuracy and stability.<br><br>I built the Cosmolyra mainly for ear-training purposes.  I have found that<br>it can also be used with good effect as a solo instrument, as a great thing<br>to sing along with, and even as a good instrument for ensemble work (a<br>recent jam with 12-tone electric guitar shows promise).  I may get around to<br>publishing full specs and even music for it (maybe in 1/1)...<br><br>---------I have five free pitch instruments------------<br><br>1) 1976 Bach Stradivarius Bb trumpet w/72 bell in silver<br>2) 1995 Yamaha Professional Heavy Wall Bb trumpet in silver<br>3) My voice<br>4) My whistling<br>5) Mollenhauer soprano recorder (wood)<br><br>Carl<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed) <br>Subject:  instruments<br>PostedDate:  04-01-98 19:17:18<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  04-01-98 19:14:45-04-01-98 19:14:46,04-01-98 19:14:04-04-01-98 19:14:04<br>DeliveredDate:  04-01-98 19:14:04<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256582.006439BE; Sun, 4 Jan 1998 19:16:40 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA30707; Sun, 4 Jan 1998 19:17:18 +0100<br>Date: Sun, 4 Jan 1998 19:17:18 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA30678<br>Received: (qmail 10012 invoked from network); 4 Jan 1998 10:17:14 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 4 Jan 1998 10:17:14 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.876758@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
