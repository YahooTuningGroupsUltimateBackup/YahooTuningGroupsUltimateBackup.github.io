Here are the<br>intervals that seem the most effective in that regard.  <br><br>   Bearing that first consideration in mind, I have found three 88CET intervals,<br>from least to greatest change in the character of a chord, to be useful for<br>doubling:<br>1.  The triple-octave (41 88c steps).  <br>2.  The perfect fifth (8 88c steps).  <br>3.  The major tenth (18 88c steps).  <br>These are probably the best candidate intervals to try adding to a chord, if you<br>want to increase its richness, but not significantly change its character.  They<br>definitely could change the character of the chord depending on the intervals<br>you start with and the intervals you end up with, but they are certainly bland<br>compared with many of 88CET's most useful chord-building intervals, supramajor<br>or neutral thirds for example.  <br><br>   I have found that doubling in one or more perfect fifths below the lowest<br>chord-tone usually produces powerful chords of similar character with the<br>original chord.  That is true provided that, in doing so, you don't create any<br>of those "taboo" false perfect consonances (octaves, twelfths, or double<br>octaves).  <br><br>   While on the subject of doubling in unusual intervals, it's probably worth<br>pointing out that 88CET can provide some very unusual and intriguing composite<br>timbres from doubling entire melody lines up or down by these intervals.  For<br>example, a violin melody doubled on a flute a 7:4 higher seems to have a<br>synergistic sound beyond a mere timbral mixture as with doubling in unisons,<br>octaves, or fifths to a lesser degree.  Some of these composites sound more like<br>alien synthesizer sounds, even if the constituent instrument simulations are a<br>quite realistic.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 19 Sep 1995 11:42 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id CAA22302; Tue, 19 Sep 1995 02:42:25 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 19 Sep 1995 02:42:25 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01510101ac84407d1cf6@[194.128.81.130]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
