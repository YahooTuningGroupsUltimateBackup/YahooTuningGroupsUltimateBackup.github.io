That topic makes a valuable and appropriate<br>conclusion to this series.<br><br>   First, when you're using these CDs, don't operate under the false<br>assumption that you can get away with just thinking to yourself the<br>answers, especially when the correct answer is sung.  Thought is inherently<br>fleeting enough that you can convince yourself that you thought up the<br>correct answer when you really didn't.<br><br>   Also (I aluded to this earlier):  The more frequently you play any one<br>part of the CDs, the less effective it will be.  You'll start remembering<br>the answers.  So you're best off playing through these CDs more or less<br>cover to cover, so that a longer time elapses before you go back to a given<br>section.  Or you can play them randomly so that it's harder to anticipate<br>what's coming up.  If you find that you can't proceed much further without<br>more practice on a particular topic, then move on to another topic, or stop<br>that CD for a while to practice that skill by some other means.  I've<br>frequently even stopped long enough to make a special-purpose ear-training<br>tape to get over that sort of sticky point!<br><br>   A while back I mentioned ear-training maintenance.  These CDs are really<br>fantastic as a refresher course, or a ten-minute-a-day up-keep routine.<br><br>   And once again, use these CDs for the freedom that their auditory-only<br>character lends them to.  There are often better ear-training methodologies<br>in cases where you have the opportunity to use your hands and eyes too.<br>But as I suggested earlier, they're great while you're stuck in traffic on<br>your way to work (if you have a CD player in your car that is!).<br><br>   But that is not to suggest that you can't enhance the techniques I'm<br>describing here with visual aids.  Or take that idea one step farther:  I<br>sometimes think of these CDs as like a deck of audio flash cards.  Heck, go<br>ahead and make yourself a deck or two of real flash cards!  They make a lot<br>of sense, for example, for identifying pitch relationships visually on a<br>staff, rather than by note names as you're limited to on a CD.</div><h3><a id=7358 href="#7358">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>4/4/1998 6:17:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>I am a grad student doing a paper on the history of alternate tuning<br>>systems and how we composers are using some of them today....but I need<br>>citeable references.<br><br>   Manuel Op de Coul has a discography ... somewhere.  Is that on a web<br>page perhaps, Manuel?<br><br>   As for written mater, most of us could cite our favorite books, but here<br>are some that address tuning history among other topics:  John Chalmers'<br>"Divisions of the Tetrachord", Hermann Helmholz's "On the Sensations of<br>Tone", J. Murray Barbour's "Tuning and Temperament", J.P. Rameau's<br>"Treatise on Harmony".<br><br>   Also, Brian McLaren wrote a "Short History of Microtonality" (the title<br>something like that anyway).  That might be a good overview, with<br>references for further exploration.  I confess that I haven't read it<br>entirely, and I did read of it I liked, but it was quite a while back.<br>Brian can be reached via snail-mail at 2462 S.E. Micah Place;  Coravallis,<br>OR  97333-1966;  USA.  There are rumors going around that he has a phone<br>now though...</div>
