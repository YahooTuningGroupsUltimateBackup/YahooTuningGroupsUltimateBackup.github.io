I have most often<br>>seen it used to mean "circular temperament"<snip> Circular temperament, as I<br>understand it, is<br>>any temperament where the sharps and flats are the same inside 12 >fifths<br>Werckmeister, Kirnberger, Young, etc.<br><br>     Hmmm, I am not sure I understand the "same inside 12 fifths definition",<br>could I ask for more clarification???<br>    I would vote to use Well Temperament  to describe the irregular,<br>circulating, non-restrictive tunings that seemed to have begun with<br>Werckmiester, and found perfection in the Young.   This is a little looser<br>definition that what I think Carl has described.<br>     Jorgensen writes: " they are unrestricticve, circulating temperaments<br>allowing modulation thorugh all the keys without encountering wolf intervals".<br>I think that a good definition of well temperament should include the lack of<br>wolves, However, how shall we define wolf?  anything more than a comma?<br>Ronnie Milsap,  (who had his other tuner come retune his piano the day after I<br>introduced him to Mr Young), started calling "wolf" at about 18 cents in the<br>maj3rd...........<br>     Also,  Jorgensen writes " the varying sizes of major thirds are placed in<br>strict order, whereby they change regularly in patterns from smallest to<br>largest and back to smallest while modulating through a series of fourths or<br>fifths around the circle. The form of tonality in these irregular temperaments<br>is , therefore,  regular. "<br>     This is an important distinction.  Many musicians think the irregular<br>temperaments just scattered differing levels of dissonance around, willy-<br>nilly, and you never know what a key might sound like.  In fact, virtually all<br>of the writings about tunings in the Well Tempered era, ( which I am taking to<br>be 1700-1850) seem to refer to this form, and it is logical to assume that<br>composers were using the same basic set of resources in tunings.<br>      How do I see it?  Meantone forces  black and white decisions on<br>enharmonic choices, the Well Temperaments  demand a predictable palette of<br>tempering gradations, ( which I call a "Harmonic Toolbox"),.  and 12 TET<br>doesn't let you make any choices at all.......<br>Regards,<br>Ed Foote<br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Re: Bach again<br>PostedDate:  05-12-97 15:57:58<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  05-12-97 15:56:09-05-12-97 15:56:10,05-12-97 15:56:01-05-12-97 15:56:02<br>DeliveredDate:  05-12-97 15:56:02<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256564.00520A17; Fri, 5 Dec 1997 15:56:05 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07174; Fri, 5 Dec 1997 15:57:58 +0100<br>Date: Fri, 5 Dec 1997 15:57:58 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07171<br>Received: (qmail 3669 invoked from network); 5 Dec 1997 06:57:55 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 5 Dec 1997 06:57:55 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541100b0ad40512dd7@[207.207.2.73]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6541 href="#6541">ðŸ”—</a>Polychroni Moniodis &#x3C;UPB_MONIODIS@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/1997 10:10:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On  5 Dec 97 at 12:06, Polychroni Moniodis wrote:<br><br>> Just a quick glance at the few intervals presented found errors:<br>><br>> p. 19:   54/49 should be 50/49<br><br>The 54/49 (= 168 c.) is correct; guess I let my disappointment get<br>the best of me.<br><br><br>Polychroni Moniodis  <br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
