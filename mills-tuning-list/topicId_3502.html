The encyclopedia contains a full article on the<br>pianoforte, and the description is consistent with that of a piano tuned to a<br>mean tone temperament.  Contrasting the piano with the guitar, the author<br>writes: "The guitar is capable, in a small space, of the most heart-touching<br>expression; but then its tone is not fit to be heard from afar, even in a<br>theatre or concert room; besides, ITS STYLE OF HARMONY (in the best of hands)<br>is not (ital.) comme il faut, or perfectly according to severe counterpoint;<br>nor, strange as the assertion may seem, can it admit of alteration without<br>injuring the genius of the instrument.  This is plain from a comparison of<br>Huerta's performance with that of the accomplished and scientific Sor." I.e. -<br>the guitar is (without adjustments not widely known of in 1854) constrained to<br>be in equal temperament, but the piano is not subject to that limitation.<br><br>I found nothing about tuning practices under entries for tuning, temperament,<br>etc., in that encyclopedia, but I found an entry under BEARING NOTES which<br>reads as follows: <br><br>	"In the tuning of keyed instruments, harps, etc., bearing notes signify those<br>notes between which the most erroneous or highly tempered fifth is situate, on<br>which also the <ital. wolf> is said to be thrown.  Many tuners begin at C, and<br>tune upwards through the progression of fifths, C, G, D, A, E, B, Gb, Db, and<br>Ab, and then stop and begin again at C, the octave above the former note, and<br>tune downwards, through the fifths F, Bb, and Eb, and thus the resulting fifth<br>Ab, Eb, produces <ital. bearing notes>; owing to each fifth having been made<br>more or less flat than the system of twelve notes will bear, the <ital. least<br>sum> of all their errors or temperaments being the <ital. Diaschisma>.  Some<br>tuners are in the habit of throwing their <ital. wolf> into the fifth Ab, Db,<br>and others into that of Db, Gb, which last, as being nearest to the middle of<br>the whole progression of fifths, seems its most appropriate place for general<br>use."<br><br>The entry for DIASCHISMA reads:<br><br>DIASCHISMA. (From the Greek) An interval in the ancient music, forming the<br>half of a minor semitone.<br><br>The entry for SEMITONE reads:<br><br>SEMITONE.  Half a tone;  the smallest of all the intervals admitted in modern<br>music.  There are two species of semitone; the major and the minor.  The<br>semitone major is produced by rising a degree, as from G natural to A flat;<br>the semitone minor, by passing from a natural note to its sharp.<br><br>	As the just intonation minor semitone is about 72 cents, this would make a<br>diaschisma about 36 cents, which is about the size of the wolf in quarter<br>comma mean tone temperament.  I would infer from this entry that, as late as<br>1854 in the United States, mean tone temperaments, including quarter comma<br>were the ones in most widespread use for the piano and other keyboard<br>instruments.<br><br>	Regarding Silbermann, it is my understanding that he is associated with a<br>"Silbermann temperament" which is essentially identical with sixth comma mean<br>tone temperament, which is about halfway between quarter comma mean tone<br>temperament (with just 5/4 thirds) and equal temperament with thirds sharp<br>from just by 13.7 cents.  (the 1/6 comma MT third is sharp by about 7.2<br>cents).<br><br>	I had my piano tuned first to sixth comma mean tone temperament last summer.<br>Putting it into that tuning caused its sound to be dramatically different than<br>the sound it had in equal temperament - more gently harmonious and strikingly<br>resonant - just a "different animal", hardly the same kind of musical<br>instrument as a piano in equal temperament.  More recently I have been playing<br>a rented piano in quarter comma mean tone temperament.  The sound of the<br>different piano in this latter tuning is again very different from the sound<br>either of equal temperament or sixth comma mean tone temperament - to my ears<br>a very beautiful sound - and to a number of others it was an amazing surprise<br>to hear a piano sounding as it does in mean tone temperament.  Although I have<br>been working with just intonation music synthesis for nearly 20 years, I<br>myself was amazed to hear the sound of a piano in mean tone temperament and I<br>still have not gotten over this "discovery".<br><br>	If I were to compare the sounds of the sixth comma mean tone piano and the<br>quarter comma mean tone piano, I'd say they both sound very beautiful and they<br>sound very different, one from another.  I would think there was plenty of<br>room for pianos tuned both in 1/6 comma and quarter comma.</div><h3><a id=7776 href="#7776">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>5/13/1998 1:59:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Call me ignorant, but I have no idea what you guys are talking about.
