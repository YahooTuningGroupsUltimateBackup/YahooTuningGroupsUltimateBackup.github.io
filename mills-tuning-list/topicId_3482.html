I heard a brief solo on one <br>of their records, and the tonality fit the hard rock sound very well. He <br>did an interview for GuitarPlayer and talked about trying to get Fender <br>guitars to produce a "quarter stepper" guitar, as he called it. He also <br>mentioned that some Norwegian folk music touched on quarter tones. I know <br>he also did a collaboration with the great Norwegian guitarist Terje <br>Rypdal, but I've never heard it...I don't think it was <br>microtonal...Hstick</div>
