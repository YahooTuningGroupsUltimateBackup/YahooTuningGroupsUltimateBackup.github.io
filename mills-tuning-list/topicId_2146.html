As Partch progressed through life, he became more inclined to<br>>write dissonant, "mistuned" music which is based on his "Monophonic Scale,"<br>>but is not necessarily in what would be purists would consider to be Just<br>>Intonation.   <br><br>It's a matter of opinion whether Partch wrote "mistuned" music.  While<br>he must have had some difficulty keeping the string instruments exactly<br>in tune, he probably came as close as humanly possible.  I don't agree<br>that the intervals Partch used later in his life were "dissonant" either.  <br>The intervals continue to be "strange" for many people, but Partch himself<br>considered them consonances, as indeed they are on at least some <br>instruments, for example those with harmonic partials, such as flutes, <br>and my Woodstock Gamelan, a tubulong percussion instrument.  I also tuned<br>my Chinese guzheng in a pentatonic scale of 1/1, 8/7, 9/7, 10/7 and 12/7<br>and it sounds very consonant when it is freshly tuned, but it is difficult<br>to get the strings to hold the tuning for long.<br><br>Best, <br><br>Lydia Ayers<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 17 Jun 1997 09:06 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00520; Tue, 17 Jun 1997 09:06:22 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 17 Jun 1997 09:06:22 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00518<br>Received: (qmail 11058 invoked from network); 16 Jun 1997 21:35:50 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 16 Jun 1997 21:35:50 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01510101afcafd354bca@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
