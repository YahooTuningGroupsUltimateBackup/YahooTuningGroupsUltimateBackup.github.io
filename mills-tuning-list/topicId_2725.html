Then several ideas occurred (which I'm sure<br>are not new, but I haven't seen them).  Why not use a darker line (instead<br>of the space) -- or colored one(s).  If you have one red line, say, that's<br>always a given reference pitch/finger/fret, why not let it move freely to<br>keep the ledger lines above & below to a minimum?  (Sort of like when a<br>cellist is asked to shift from bass cleff to tenor in the middle of a<br>measure in traditional notation.)  It should be easier to train the brain<br>to follow the position of the ref line than to find a pitch on an extended<br>staff. ... on the other hand, that's easy for ME to say since I don't have<br>to do it.  And come to think of it, even if it doesn't work, maybe it'll<br>be the next wave in abstract art (:*)>-=<  Steve Soderberg<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Re: La Musique Arabe<br>PostedDate:  07-12-97 02:04:35<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  07-12-97 02:02:43-07-12-97 02:02:44,07-12-97 02:02:33-07-12-97 02:02:33<br>DeliveredDate:  07-12-97 02:02:33<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256566.0005BCD1; Sun, 7 Dec 1997 02:02:40 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08381; Sun, 7 Dec 1997 02:04:35 +0100<br>Date: Sun, 7 Dec 1997 02:04:35 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08369<br>Received: (qmail 29255 invoked from network); 6 Dec 1997 17:04:30 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 6 Dec 1997 17:04:30 -0800<br>Message-Id: <348A581C.3032@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6550 href="#6550">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>12/7/1997 2:01:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>In my experience the human ear<br>>cannot reliably distinguish intervals closer than those of the 19-tone<br>>equal, so the endless debates about minute distinctions between musical<br>>ratios, or about equal temperaments with more than 19 tones in the<br>>octave,  seem to me rather beside the point.<br><br>   Wow.  I personally have never noticed anything to even close to that.<br><br>   But perhaps that depends in what sense you're asking people to<br>"distinguish" those intervals.  For example, I have no doubt that almost<br>anybody with even casual musical training could distinguish a chromatic<br>scale in ... oh, say 31TET ... from a glissando.<br><br>   Perhaps that's too elementary of a distinguishing task though.  But even<br>among some more subtle tasks, like noticing 19TET's flat M3 and P5, and<br>comparing that to 31's right-on M3 and slightly flat P5, or to 12TET's<br>way-sharp M3 and almost exact P5, I have found that there are many musical<br>settings where those factors are audible.<br><br>   I certainly do agree that there are many musical settings where the<br>notes are just simply wizzing by too fast to hear those aspects of a tuning<br>as such.  If that's the sort of distinction exercise you're talking about,<br>then I'd agree with your conclusion up to a point anyway.<br><br>   But there certainly are many other ways in which the nature of the<br>tuning in which a composition is played can become apparent even if the<br>notes are screaming by too fast to carefully evaluate the tuning of each<br>one individually.  For example, even a very fast melody, provided that it<br>is at least somwhat scalar, played in a tuning that has a comparatively<br>flat leading tone (like 19TET or 31TET), is easy to hear as having that<br>characteristic.<br><br>   So, I guess I'd have to hear more about the nature of the limitation<br>you've noticed before I can comment on it in greater detail.<br><br>   By the way, the fact that 22TET is not "cyclic" (I presume by that you<br>mean specifically that its major scale and its modes are not cyclic), opens<br>up some intriguing musical possibilities, like seemingly impossible<br>modulations.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Re: Problems in Notation<br>PostedDate:  07-12-97 11:02:02<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  07-12-97 11:00:08-07-12-97 11:00:09,07-12-97 10:59:58-07-12-97 10:59:59<br>DeliveredDate:  07-12-97 10:59:59<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256566.0036F0E1; Sun, 7 Dec 1997 11:00:06 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08326; Sun, 7 Dec 1997 11:02:02 +0100<br>Date: Sun, 7 Dec 1997 11:02:02 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08512<br>Received: (qmail 23982 invoked from network); 7 Dec 1997 02:01:39 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 7 Dec 1997 02:01:39 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541104b0af85a5b335@[207.207.2.60]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
