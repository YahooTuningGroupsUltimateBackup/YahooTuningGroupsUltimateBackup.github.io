I must thank<br>>the late Larry Hanson for the financial support which made this possible,<br>>and John Starrett for a great job on the instrument itself. Between<br>>Starrett and myself we now have: 34 tone electric guitar/bass, 34<br>>acoustic guitar/bass, 19 tone electric and acoustic guitar/bass, 31 tone<br>>electric, and a fretless guitar as well. Upcoming projects are a 31<br>>acoustic guitar/bass, and a fretless acoustic. I believe Paul Erlich now<br>>has his 22 tone guitar, so I would be interested to see what he comes up<br>>with...again, Hanson needs much thanks, because he believed enough in his<br>>dreams to make them a reality...Hstick<br><br>Congratulations, Neil! That's exciting news.<br><br>Are these acoustic basses uprights with frets or do they resemble acoustic <br>guitars?<br><br>John Starrett has refretted my 7-string guitar neck to 22-equal and sent it<br>to me. Once I receive it, some work will still need to be done on the <br>guitar. Then I intend to study and practice very hard. Although this means <br>being a hermit for a long period of time, I am confident that it will pay <br>off -- the music is already coming together on the keyboard, but I can't do<br>very much when I can barely span a "fifth" with one hand. The last ten <br>years of teaching myself 12-tone guitar have been very fruitful in that I <br>can comfortably improvise in a wide variety of diatonic idioms, plus blues <br>and the occasional octatonic stuff. As good as people seem to think I am, <br>the world is already saturated with great 12-tone guitar players; who <br>really needs one more? Hopefully I can carry over some of my aural and <br>technical skills to this new instrument. But it will take some time to <br>unlearn diatonic thinking, and to forge an improvisatory style that is <br>musical without being derivative. Maybe after ten more years I'll be onto <br>something!<br><br> -Paul E.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 22 May 1997 19:27 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07868; Thu, 22 May 1997 19:27:47 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 22 May 1997 19:27:47 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07864<br>Received: (qmail 12008 invoked from network); 22 May 1997 17:27:42 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 22 May 1997 17:27:42 -0000<br>Message-Id: <memo.749298@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
