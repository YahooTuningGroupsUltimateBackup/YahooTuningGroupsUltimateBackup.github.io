I caught Newband performing<br>Dean Drummond's score for the silent film "The Last Laugh"<br>by F.W. Murnau in the Wintergarden at the World Financial Center.<br>I already heard this once in March. Joe Monzo<br>reviewed that show on my Juxtaposition Ezine site (follow links below).<br>Last time I was busy watching the film, this time I could concentrate on<br>the<br>music. For me, to date this is probably Dean's most interesting work.<br>The score really captures the polar opposites of despair and joy in the<br>film.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>After that was done I buzzed over to the Knitting Factory to<br>catch Elodie Lauten with a band that contained a few AFMM<br>regulars. Here's the bit from the Knit site:<br><br>>Elodie Lauten<br>><br>>Performed every seven years, Initiation, from the Soundless<br>>Sound Matrix brings seven performers to interact with an<br>>electronic ambience based on the harmonic vibration of silence.<br>>Mary Hurlbut - soprano; Meredith Borden - coloratura soprano;<br>>Andrew Bolotowsky - flute; Jon Catler-microtonal electric<br>>guitar; Johnny Reinhard-bassoon; Juliann Klopotic - violin;<br>>Elodie Lauten - synthesizers.<br><br>I got there a bit late but they were still working on<br>the sound check, the sound man plugging things in with<br>the board volume turned up - treating us to some really<br>nice loud pops. There were problems with the mix, the cd<br>backing track was a bit too loud. I could go on a bit here,<br>but on to the music...<br><br>Bells and cymbals and big fundamental drones over which<br>the band played. On one of the pieces, some classic<br>repetitious minimalism against which the band also played.<br>Some of this was performed by Elodie, some was on a<br>cd player plugged into the board. Everyone got some<br>solo space, the obvious being Meredith Borden, Johnny<br>Reinhard and Juliann Klopotic letting loose with some<br>great solos.<br><br>Microtonal? Yes but I have no idea what kind of tuning<br>was used. Still, even though there were technical difficulties,<br>I got *it*. A big beautiful drone (most of the time)<br>with sections of group improvisation.<br><br>Elodie Lauten on the WWW:<br>http://www.echonyc.com/~jhhl/Lauten/<br><br><br>--<br>* D a v i d        B e a r d s l e y<br>*           xouoxno@virtulink.com<br>*<br>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br>*<br>* http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</div>
