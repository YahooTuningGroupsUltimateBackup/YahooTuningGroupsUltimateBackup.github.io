They are virtually identical to the ratios I've seen propounded<br>>by S. Ramanathan and countless others. Can you tell us what the Indian<br>>Cultural Centre says?<br>><br><br>I'm afraid my information from the Indian Cultural Centre is only anecdotal<br>and anyway I'm sure they as a body do not have an official line on tuning.<br>As far as I know in the Indian Classical tradition, tuning like technique<br>and style is passed on from master to student and there will be differences<br>between various sub-traditions. Some players may tune according to a five<br>limit system similar to the one explained by Danielou and the other sources<br>that Paul Erlich mentions. Others may do otherwise. Anyway there is often a<br>difference between what musicians actually do and what the tuning theorist<br>says they should be doing. <br><br>In "The Grammar of South Indian Music" by C. Subrahmanya Ayyar (Madras<br>1976), the author gives a sruti system (22 note chromatic scale from which<br>ragas are extracted) which includes 7/6, 7/5 and 7/4, going beyond the 5<br>limit that Danielou would like to impose. <br><br>I would be interested to hear of other books that give ratio analyses of<br>the tunings used in Indian Classical Music. <br>Brian Lee<br> <br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1559<br>*************************</div>
