When <br>I improvised a melody over a drone bass, trying to emphasize the notes that <br>would theoretically be consonant, I found that 33 steps above the bass <br>sounded like a resolution while 39 steps above the bass did not. So much for <br>the theory of tritave equivalence! Clearly there is a lot more equivalence <br>in 16:1 than in 17:1 or 15:1 or 27:1 -- octave equivalence is a real and <br>unavoidable phenomenon. My hypothesis is that our virtual pitch sensations <br>are quite indistinct as to octave register, even though our pure tone <br>sensations (e.g., formant perception, vowel recognition) may be quite <br>specific in this regard. The best approximations of the 88CET scale to the <br>octave are only slightly farther out than those normally used in gamelan <br>music, so perhaps even your generic inharmonic timbre would allow you to <br>hear some octave equivalence there. But certainly the tolerability of <br>out-of-tune, especially of stretched, multiple octaves increases with the <br>size of the interval -- Yasser showed that a rapid atonal passage played in <br>a lower register of the piano and doubled in a high register sounded the <br>same to his subjects when the upper part was played a semitone higher.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 9 Aug 1996 15:09 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA09875; Fri, 9 Aug 1996 15:09:11 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09873<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id GAA24396; Fri, 9 Aug 1996 06:09:08 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 9 Aug 1996 06:09:08 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199608091306.JAA01605@cerberus2.Ensoniq.Com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
