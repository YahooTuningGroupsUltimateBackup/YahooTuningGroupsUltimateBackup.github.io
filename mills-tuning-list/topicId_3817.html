The second and central part of this 597 page _Habilitation_<br>concerns the acoustics and measurements of idiophones, and treats the<br>problematic relationship between complex timbres and equidistant tunings =<br>in<br>African and Southeastasian idiophones. The third part treats the data of<br>the second part in terms of the relationship between psychoacoustic and<br>comparative-systematic musicology.<br><br>The essay on (primarily pitch) perception is quite up-to-date, and list<br>readers into psychoacoustics who can hack the German should enjoy it. The=<br><br>second part - which is more in my line of work - contains a few errors in=<br><br>ethnographic data, and makes a more fundamental error in measuring museum=<br><br>gamelan instruments without - surprisingly - considering their functional=<br><br>ensemble roles and ignoring the fact that gamlean repertoire is also sung=<br><br>or played on instruments with integer-related harmonic spectra. The<br>measurements, however, are very interesting, and illustrate spectra widel=<br>y<br>deviating from the best models. There is also some suggestive data here<br>about subharmonic components in the spectra of struck idiophones.<br><br>While I am too unfamiliar with the music of the African instruments<br>Schneider presents, the conclusion I raise from the Southeastasian data i=<br>s<br>that although the divergence from from simple harmonic spectra is probabl=<br>y<br>one reason that intervals between perceived fundamentals are able to vary=<br><br>greatly from the simplest ratios, the variation in the divergence (both<br>from instrument to instrument and among the bars or gongs of a single<br>instrument) is so great that it would be extremely unlikely that the<br>tunings are directly related to the timbral structures. There is very<br>likely, however, a lower-level perceptual mechanism at work in which<br>timbres are grouped together in rather broad classes of spectra and<br>envelopes. The streaming of a complex ensemble of idiophones into<br>musical-functional roles (e.g. distinguishing a gender from a saron from =<br>a<br>bonang from a kenong) would then be constructed through this mechanism.<br><br>           =</div>
