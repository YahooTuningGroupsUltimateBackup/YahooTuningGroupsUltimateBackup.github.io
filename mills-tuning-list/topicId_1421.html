Hainline&#x22; &#x3C;hainline@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/1996 9:18:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>John,<br><br>Regarding the 'seven-toned scale of sound' described by Gurdjieff in his<br>writing--this is quite difficult reading--perhaps out of context will make<br>very little sense.  But with careful reading there is perhaps enough<br>information to begin work on Gurdjieff 's ideas.  There is nothing<br>concrete in these writings to exactly describe a scale which could be<br>defined by cents or ratios but the impetus to seek a deeper understand of<br>cosmic knowledge through music is provided-- more than noodling around<br>with sound, music is or could be the study of cosmic law.  I will have to<br>break down the quote into several posts as the reference is rather long. <br>This is from Gurdjieff's, "Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson", E. P.<br>Dutton & Co., 1964. (pp 847-870) <br><br>"And as regards the 'seven-toned scale of sound' which had reached them<br>from the ancient Chinese beings, then you must be informed about this as<br>detailedly as possible, because first of all, thanks to this information,<br>you will better understand about the<br> laws of vibrations in which all the peculiarities of the sacred<br>Heptaparaparshinokh can be constated and cognized; and secondly, because,<br>among those things intentionally reproduced by those same three-brained<br>beings of yours, who have taken your fancy, for daily use in their general<br>existence, I brought home from there also one 'sound-producing instrument'<br>named there 'piano' on which the vibration-engendering 'strings' were<br>placed which could be arranged just as on the Dzendvokh, that is the<br>second spe cial part of the famous experimental apparatus Alla-attapan,<br>which was created by the great twin brothers and on which, when we return<br>on to our dear Karatas, I shall be able to explain to you by<br>demonstration, what is called, the 'successiveness-of-the-p<br>rocesses-of-the-mutual-blending-of-vibrations.' Thanks to these practical<br>explanations of mine you will more easily be able to represent to yourself<br>and approximately to cognize just how and in which successiveness in our<br>great Megalocosmos the process o f the Most Great Trogoautoegocrat<br>proceeds and in which way the large and small cosmic concentrations arise. <br><br>"Relating about how such a fragment of 'practical result' from the ancient<br>true knowledge survived and automatically reached down to your<br>contemporary favorites, I shall first elucidate to you with more accuracy<br>about this same definite law of vibrations<br> which was first formulated by the great brothers as the<br>'seven-gravity-center-vibrations-of-sound.'<br><br>"I have already said that in the beginning, while that totality of true<br>information or that fragment of 'genuine knowledge' was handed down from<br>the beings of one generation to the beings of subsequent generations only<br>through the genuine initiates there,<br> it not only underwent a change in the entirety of the exact sense put<br>into it, but it even began, thanks to other genuine learned beings among<br>their followers of subsequent generations, to be 'detailized' and became<br>accessible then to the perception of e ven ordinary three-brained<br>terrestrial beings. <br><br>"Among these followers a century and a half after the sacred Rascooarno of<br>the saint-brothers, there was a certain genuine learned being,<br>King-Too-Toz by name, who, on the basis of the principles of the<br>construction of the middle part of the apparatus All a-attapan named<br>Dzendvokh, propounded a very detailed theory under the name 'evolution and<br>involution of vibrations,' and for the confirmation of this theory of his<br>made a special elucidatory apparatus which he called 'Lav-Merz-Nokh' and<br>which, by the way , later became widely known among almost all the learned<br>beings of our Great Megalocosmos. <br><br>"The said apparatus Lav-Merz-Nokh, like the middle part of the<br>Alla-attapan, consisted of a very strong frame with a great many strings<br>stretched on it made from the intestines and tail-hairs of various<br>quadruped beings there.  One end of each string was fixed to one edge of<br>this frame, and the other to pegs inserted into another edge. <br><br>"These pegs were inserted in such a way that they could be freely turned<br>in their what are called 'peg holes' and the strings fixed on to them<br>could at will be tightened or loosened as much as was necessary for the<br>required number of vibrations. <br><br>"Of the great number of strings on the Lav-Merz-Nokh, forty-nine were<br>colored white and the totality of vibrations, that is to say, the definite<br>sound obtained from the vibrations of each one of them was called a whole<br>'center-of-gravity-of-the-octave,' w hich definite sound corresponded to<br>that which your favorites now call a 'whole note.'<br><br>"Each seven strings of these 'gravity-center-sounds' or whole notes were<br>then and are still called an 'octave.'<br><br>"In this way there were stretched on the apparatus Lav-Merz-Nokh seven<br>octaves of whole notes the totality of the general consonance of which<br>gave what is called the 'sacred Hanziano,' that is, just what the two<br>great brothers suspected and which happened<br> almost exactly to coincide with what, as I already said, they then named<br>'Nirioonossian-World-Sound.'<br><br>"Each such an octave of strings on the Lav-Merz-Nokh gave that totality of<br>vibrations which according to the calculations of the great twin-brothers<br>correspond to the totality of the vibrations of all those cosmic<br>substances which, issuing from seven sepa rate independent sources,<br>compose one of the seven-centers-of-gravity of the 'fundamental<br>common-cosmic Ansapalnian-octave.'<br><br>"Each white string on the Lav-Merz-Nokh was tuned separately by the<br>Chinese learned being King-Too-Toz in such a way that it gave that average<br>number of vibrations which according to the calculations of the great<br>brothers ought also to be in substances wh ich are one of the<br>seven-centers-of-gravity of the given whole totality of substances, which<br>in turn is one of the seven centers of gravity of the fundamental cosmic<br>octave of substances. <br><br>"On the Lav-Merz-Nokh, each octave as well as each whole note of the<br>octave had names of their own.  And, namely, the highest octave of the<br>strings was called 'Arachiaplnish,'<br><br>          The second highest    'Erkrordiapan'<br>          The third highest     'Erordiapan'<br>          The fourth highest    'Chorortdipan'<br>          The fifth highest     'Piandjiapan'<br>          The sixth highest     'Vetserordiapan'<br>          The seventh highest   'Okhterordiapan'<br><br>"And the 'gravity-center-strings' themselves were painted white and were<br>called the same in all octaves, but with the addition of the name of the<br>given octave itself.  And, namely, these whole notes were called thus: <br><br>          The first highest  'Adashtanas'<br>          The second highest 'Evotanas'<br>          The third highest  'Govorktanis'<br>          The fourth highest 'Maikitanis'<br>          The fifth highest  'Midotanis'<br>          The sixth highest  'Lookotanis'<br>          The seventh highest'Sonitanis'<br><br>"The contemporary beings of the Earth now call these same whole notes:<br>'do,' 'si,' 'la,' 'sol,' 'fa,' 'mi,' 're.'<br><br>"By the way, my boy, in order that the greatness of these two saints,<br>brothers, should be still more evident to you, I draw your attention to<br>the fact that the calculations made by them and the qualitativeness<br>established by these calculations of what is called the<br>'vivifyingness-of-the-vibrations' of sound which corresponded according to<br>their suppositions with the vivifyingness of cosmic sources of substances,<br>appeared to coincide almost exactly with reality. <br><br>"This merit of theirs was all the greater, because as terrestrial beings<br>they had no true information about this and were able to make correct<br>suppositions and almost accurate calculations of many objective cosmic<br>truths exclusively only thanks to their o wn conscious labors and<br>intentional sufferings. <br><br>"Further, on this Lav-Merz-Nokh in each octave between these white strings<br>or whole notes, this learned being King-Too-Toz strung in certain places<br>five further strings, but this time painted black. <br><br>"These black strings however he named 'Demisakhsakhsa,' which according to<br>the terminology of the beings of the Earth corresponded to what they call<br>'half notes,' and these 'half-note strings' on the Lav-Merz-Nokh were not<br>strung between those whole notes<br> between which, according to the indications of the saints Choon-Kil-Tez<br>and Coon-Tro-Pel, there is according to the sacred Heptaparaparshinookh no<br>possibility of the independence of the evolution and involution of the<br>vibrations of sound, and these place s they were the first to call 'gaps.'<br>And in the given places of the octave where these gaps ought to be, this<br>learned being King-Too-Toz strung special strings between the whole notes<br>made of the tail-hairs of beings called there 'horse.'<br><br>"These hair strings gave vibrations which were not always the same and<br>King-Too-Toz named these vibrations 'chaotic.'<br><br>"The number of the vibrations obtained from these hair strings depended<br>not on the stretching of them, as in the case of the other strings, but on<br>other causes; chiefly on three causes ensuing from surrounding cosmic<br>results,namely: on the action of the v ibrations dispersed around them<br>obtained from other strings of the Lav-Merz-Nokh; on the state of what is<br>called the 'temperature of the atmosphere' at the given moment; and on the<br>radiations of the beings present nearby without distinction of brain syste<br>m. <br><br>"On this Lav-Merz-Nokh between these white, black, and hair strings there<br>were also strung in each octave fourteen strings also from 'twisted<br>intestines,' which were painted red and called 'Keesookesschoor,' and if<br>contemporary beings of the Earth were to<br> use these strings they would call them 'quarter notes.'<br><br>"In addition to this, all those 'quarter note strings' which were<br>stretched on either side of the hair strings were fitted in such a way<br>that the vibrations issuing from them could at any moment be changed as<br>desired by means of tightening or loosening th ese strings and thus the<br>vibrations they produced could be regulated and by ear blended with the<br>frequently changing vibrations obtained from the hair strings. <br><br>"And this was so done because thanks to the frequently changing vibrations<br>of the hair strings, the qualitativeness of which, I already said,<br>depending on the temperature of the atmosphere, on the radiations of the<br>beings present nearby, and on many other<br> causes, the vibrations of there 'red strings' acquired such a property<br>that if they did not blend with the vibrations of the hair strings the<br>vibrations issuing from them would act on the beings present very<br>'cacophonically-harmfully,' even to their poss ible total destruction. <br><br>"With the frequent changing however of the stretching of the red strings<br>and with the blending of their vibrations with the general vibrations<br>issuing from the Lav-Merz-Nokh, their harmlessness was obtained, that is<br>to say, owing to this, the general vibr ations issuing from the<br>Lav-Merz-Nokh became for the beings who heard them what is called<br>'Harmoniously flowing' and not harmfully acting. <br><br>"And so, my boy, this apparatus, Lav-Merz-Nokh, and also the detailed<br>theory of this ancient conscientious learned being King-Too-Toz suffered<br>the same fate as the incomparable apparatus Alla-attaoan and the whole<br>totality of true information cognized by the brothers. <br><br>"Owing to the continuing and even increasing formation in the sense of<br>quantity of certain of your favorites of the mentioned new type with the<br>said inherency of cunning wiseacring, all this totality of information was<br>from that time on altered and its ge nuine sense and significance<br>gradually forgotten. <br><br>...if there is interest I will continue in another post. <br><br>Bruce Kanzelmeyer<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP;
