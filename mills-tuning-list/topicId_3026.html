You are a Yes fan, you must be a Genesis fan too :)<br><br>Actually, I haven't really heard much Genesis.  Since the 70's were before<br>my time, I kinda miss the flow of stuff.  I got the YES and ELP down, tho...<br><br>>>Wow, I strongly disagree. Virtually every music theorist who does not care<br>>>about tuning issues understands harmony in terms of the diatonic scale and<br>>>tonal functions. "Functional harmony" -- ring a bell? Unfortunately,<br>>>virtually every alternative-tuning theorist does not so understand harmony.<br>>>This is unfortunate. It seems that "music theory" is divided into two<br>>>schools, and Carl is perhaps only familiar with the alternative-tuning<br>>>school. There is much of value in the other school, Carl.<br><br>I guess what I meant is, the idea of generalizing the rules for use outside<br>of the diatonic scale is new.  I had one semester of High School and three<br>semesters of Conservatory music theory, and one semester of Conservatory<br>composition.  The composition class was all about wacky stuff, since the<br>prof was into wacky stuff.  In the theory classes, we did learn the rules<br>of functional harmony, and maybe there is an analog for most criteria in<br>your "generalized" functional harmony...<br><br>>>}The root of 2 part is understandable, considering that we need strong low<br>>>}identies for our 7's to work.  This seems contradictory to the rule that<br>>>}the higher identities are more sensitive to mistuning, since there are more<br>>>}low-numbered fractions near them.<br>>><br>>>I don't see any contradiction.<br><br>There are apparently two ideas at work here...<br><br>A) That higher limit intervals are more sensistive to mis-tuning "since<br>they are more apt to be confused with other intervals".<br><br>B) What I call Tonality, and what Partch calls "Observation One".  An<br>effect created by the harmonic series, such that the number of pitches a<br>given pitch will harmonize with is inversely proportional to the odd limit<br>of the given pitch.<br><br>Idea "A" seems to suggest that we temper the octave the most, the fifth the<br>next most, and so on up.  But we can't do this without wrecking tonality,<br>since the low identities provide that, as explained in idea "B".<br><br>Both A and B are really one idea, in that they're both caused by the way<br>superparticular fractions get closer to eachother, so there's no<br>"contradiction", true.  But when tempering, it presents a trade-off<br>situation, one which can't be well-addressed by just making the de-tuning<br>inversely proportional to limit.<br><br>>>}Paul's paper addresses this by making the standard deviation in<br>log->>}frequency detuning inversely proportional to the limit of >>}the<br>interval.<br>>><br>>>That is not correct. I do offer this as an alternative model, but the first<br>>>model, in which the standard deviation is constant for all intervals, is the<br>>>one which yield the candidate tunings:<br><br>I don't have the charts!  But it says that the candidate tunings are the<br>same, except that 22 & 26 are no longer better than 12 at the 5-limit.<br>Nowhere do you say your candidates must be better than 12 at the 5-limit.<br><br>>>}So the list of scales comes down to 22, 26, 27, and 31 tone equal<br>>>temperament.<br>>><br>>>Can you suggest a way to make the paper less confusing on this point?<br><br>On the point of what scales are in the candidate list?<br><br>>>}The example of the diminished 5th is given, but why it should be<br>>>}considered a type of 5th, or why the P5 should not be considered a<br>>>}7th is not made clear.<br>>><br>>>Are you serious? Count scale steps. Anyone in a traditional theory class<br>>>could answer this blinfolded; perhaps I presumed too much of the traditional<br>>>theory background when writing this paper.<br><br>1) Conventional theory is full of holes.  The tritone is spelled as an<br>augmented forth in certain contexts, and as a diminished fifth in others,<br>but it's the same pitch.  All the enharmonics should be thrown out in 12.<br>But that's just my opinion.  Why you consider it a type of fifth in your<br>example was, in any case, not clear to me.<br><br>2) The smallest step in 12 is the semitone.  Counting semitones, the<br>tritone and P5 do not share the same number of steps.  Thus, the tritone is<br>not a characteristic dissonance of the 5th in semitones.  So what kind of<br>step did you mean?  I would expect a definition of "step" that would be<br>good for all the temperaments the paper was looking at.<br><br>Funny enough, I actually understand what you were trying to do with these<br>characteristic dissonances in your criteria, but the lack of a robust<br>definition from the beginning really hurt me.<br><br>>>By the way, all the numbering and lettering in my paper is screwed up,<br>thanks<br>>>to Microsoft.<br><br>I noticed that.  But why is it Microsoft's fault?  Did you used some<br>automatic numbering scheme?  I hate that trend in software nowadays!  It's<br>not already so easy that you can't do it yourself?<br><br>>>I think 11TET would work much better for dissonant serialism than<br>>>12TET, since 11TET is the most effective tuning for random >>dissonance,<br>and 11TET is a subset of 22TET.<br><br>You just had to get that in :~)<br><br>>>}Far out avant garde music is certainly lacking of Special Way, if >>}not<br>other things.<br>>><br>>>And I do love far-out avant garde music like Henry Cow, when I'm in the<br>mood for it. I love Phish when they go far out...<br><br>I actually had written that there's a time and a place for far out stuff,<br>but I deleted it for style considerations.  Do you mean Henry Cowell?  I<br>got a great Cd with Set of Five, Four Combinations for Three Instruments,<br>Hymn and Fuguing Tune #9, and Trio in Nine Short Movements.  Great stuff.<br>And Junta!<br><br>>>I think 22TET can take you a lot farther out than 12TET.<br><br>Some of the far out music being done at Conservatories nowadays (like what<br>the prof of my composition class and his graduate students were doing)<br>really doesn't tune at all...<br><br>>>You did not address the rest of my paper, such as my demonstration that<br>22TET<br>>>is virtually the best tuning for the decatonic scales. It may seem circular<br>>>since I found the scales in 22TET, but one might have hoped for a better way<br>>>of tuning them, which (perhaps unfortunately) does not exist.<br><br>When I looked at the clock, I knew it was time to send.<br><br>>>Modulatory effects only possible in JI -- can you give a specific example?<br><br>I'm not the best person to ask, since the only JI I've done is on the<br>Cosmolyra (everything in root position) and on an conventional organ tuned<br>justly (only one key).  It just stands to reason that there are all kinds<br>of effects, probably most of them un-discovered, based on the "anomalies"<br>of JI.<br><br>The Ben Johnston thing does come to mind, this quote of his appearing in<br>one of your ancient posts...<br><br>"I asked myself, suppose in writing some of the really very intense slow<br>movements that he did, Beethoven had not had the tempered scale to work<br>with, but had instead just intonation, what might that music have been?<br>Then I tried to write that piece, as an exercise for myself. It's actually<br>part of a piece--I liked it well enough that I put it into a piece. But at<br>first of course it's just to find out. The richness is one thing, the<br>flexibility is another. The typical Beethoven progression, for example will<br>cause you to drop by a microtonal amount every time the progression repeats<br>itself. What I did was to work it out that the pitch would drop, gradually,<br>until the whole thing drops almost a half step, and then I force it to come<br>back up by working out progressions that would make it do that. That is, of<br>course, quite different from what Beethoven was dealing with."<br><br>I've not heard the results of his efforts.<br><br>Probably the greatest expert on modulation in JI who ever lived was Partch,<br>and I'm sure I've heard effects not possible in temperament in Rotate the<br>Body and Delusion.<br><br>Bill Alves has said...<br><br>>Functionally, it may make sense to Paul to interpret the 22TET intervals as<br>>he has done above. However, I definitely hear the 10 step interval as being<br>>much more like an 11/8 (551 cents) than a 27/20. The 11/8 can have a<br>>beautiful blue-note quality, which I myself have exploited on occassion.<br>>The 19 step interval is almost dead-on a 20/11 (1035 cents), whose<br>>inversion, by the way, is a 5/4 down from the 11/8.<br><br>Here I publish an analysis of 22TET from a larger work of mine, still in<br>progress.  It lists low-numbered rational approximations of 22TET<br>intervals, all within 7 cents deviation or better.  The number of steps is<br>listed on the left, with the cents between that step and the tonic, rounded<br>to the nearest whole cent, appearing to the right....<br><br> 1- 55<br> 2- 109<br> 3- 164 11/10 (1)<br> 4- 218 17/15 (1)<br> 5- 273 7/6 (6)<br> 6- 327 23/19 (4)<br> 7- 382 5/4 (4)<br> 8- 436 9/7 (1)<br> 9- 491<br>10- 545 11/8 (6)<br>11- 600 31/22 (6)<br>12- 655<br>13- 709 3/2 (7)<br>14- 764<br>15- 818<br>16- 873<br>17- 927<br>18- 982<br>19- 1036<br>20- 1091 15/8 (3)<br>21- 1145 31/16 (0)<br>22- 1200<br><br>..Even more to the right appear the rational approximations, with<br>intervals listed only once (as otonality or utonality), so as to reveal the<br>structure of the scale, if there is any.  The cent deviations are in () to<br>the most right, and are of course the same for the inversions.  I used my<br>own judgement for balancing cent deviation, prime limit, and odd limit when<br>picking the rational approximations.<br><br>Bill Alves assertion that the 11/10 is a 5/4 down from the 11/8 is<br>confirmed by, and consistently represented in the above scheme.<br><br>Please Note: How the intervals are heard depends on context!!!  I'm just<br>throwing in my analysis here because sometimes a particular context seems<br>to be assumed when giving rational approximations for the 22TET intervals...<br><br>Carl<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Prent Rodgers <prodgers@us.ibm.com><br>Subject:  MIDI/Audio wish list<br>PostedDate:  09-01-98 20:36:03<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  09-01-98 20:35:37-09-01-98 20:35:38,09-01-98 20:35:30-09-01-98 20:35:30<br>DeliveredDate:  09-01-98 20:35:30<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256587.006B9E9C; Fri, 9 Jan 1998 20:35:58 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17601; Fri, 9 Jan 1998 20:36:03 +0100<br>Date: Fri, 9 Jan 1998 20:36:03 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA17551<br>Received: (qmail 14386 invoked from network); 9 Jan 1998 11:35:52 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 9 Jan 1998 11:35:52 -0800<br>Message-Id: <5030050002886855000002L552*@MHS><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=7024 href="#7024">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.

If the decatonic approximation to the 3/2 is much less<br>than 707 cents, the decatonic approximation to the 7/4 becomes too<br>out-of-tune.

Playing the same melody on opposite<br>ends of a piano simultaneously, you can get away with a semitone<br>transposition without much disturbing the "sameness" or "in-tune-ness"<br>(Yasser gives a melody to use for this, and I didn't believe it until I<br>tried it!)<br>><br>>}I tend to think that low primes should be tuned best.  The more<br>>}complex harmony you use, though, the more accuracy is required<br>>}for _all_ intervals.<br>><br>>I agree with this in a certain sense. However, perhaps returning a bit to<br>>some of our earlier discussions, there is a sense in which harmony can become<br>>more complex without imposing any additional requirements on tuning. For<br>>example, consider a major 7th chord, 8:10:12:15. One might be tempted to<br>>choose a tuning for this chord, or evalute the quality of approximation of<br>>this chord in various tunings, by considering all its intervals, including<br>>15:8. That would not be correct. 15:8 is a _resultant_ interval in this<br>>chord, arising from the "stacking" or "linking" of consonant intervals. That<br>>these consonant intervals are well-represented is enough to ensure that the<br>>chord will have a pleasing quality. The 15:8 itself need not be tuned close<br>>to its just value; this interval is dissonant and simply lends a roughness to<br>>the chord that is independent of its exact tuning; this roughness is<br>>tolerated because there are so many (5) consonant intervals in the chord.<br>><br>>For example, in 12TET the major seventh is much, much closer to a 17:9 than<br>>to a 15:8. 17:9 is not much more complex a ratio than 15:8, so that it seems<br>>certain that the "17:9-ness" of the 12-equal major seventh is much greater<br>>than its "15:8-ness". And yet the major seventh chord "works" just fine in<br>>12-equal. That is because the 5 consonant intervals in the chord are<br>>well-represented in 12-equal.<br><br>For another example, take 26TET. Here the major seventh is nowhere near<br>15:8 -- in fact it nails 24:13, halfway between 13:7 and 11:6. Both<br>these intervals would be much more important in describing how the 26TET<br>major 7th is heard than 15:8. And yet, since the consonances are still<br>OK, the major seventh chord sounds smooth, perhaps smoother than in<br>12TET. This is mainly because the roughness between the 2nd harmonic of<br>the root and the fundamental of the major 7th is lessened as the major<br>7th gets smaller.<br><br>This is one of my arguments against using anything beyond level-1<br>odd-limit considerations in evaluating temperaments. Also this hints at<br>why I don't think it can be relevant whether a tuning nails 25:18.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Ortgies.Ibo@t-online.de (Ortgies Ibo) <br>Subject:  My homepage (Weckman/Stellwagen/tunings and temperaments<br>PostedDate:  13-01-98 23:10:41<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  13-01-98 23:10:08-13-01-98 23:10:09,13-01-98 23:09:56-13-01-98 23:09:56<br>DeliveredDate:  13-01-98 23:09:56<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125658B.0079C44D; Tue, 13 Jan 1998 23:10:30 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08536; Tue, 13 Jan 1998 23:10:41 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 13 Jan 1998 23:10:41 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09740<br>Received: (qmail 22536 invoked from network); 13 Jan 1998 14:10:38 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 13 Jan 1998 14:10:38 -0800<br>Message-Id: <34BBEEEA.5250@T-Online.de><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
