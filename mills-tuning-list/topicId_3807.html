The basilar membrane is a ribbon-like piece of flabby tissue <br>>that flaps around when pressure (sound) waves hit it. Thousands of <br>>little hairs mounted on the basilar membrane then vibrate and send <br>>messages to the brain, which encode (at least partly) the frequency <br>>of the impinging pressure wave. Any given single sine wave excites a <br>>small region on the membrane, and the distance in frequency at <br>>which two such regions overlap is called the critical band - it varies <br>>in frequency and is undoubtedly related to (but not the sole <br>>explanation for) the frequency resolving powers of the ear.<br><br>Bill Sethares wrote this a long time ago.  His Cd, XENTONALITY, is really<br>cool, BTW.<br><br>My question is: Does anybody know how the basilar membrane works?  I<br>thought that a given spot on it was sensitive to a particular frequency,<br>and that these spots were arranged in order of decending frequency along<br>its length.  Now what stumps me is how a given frequency only vibrates an<br>isolated part of the membrane.<br><br>Carl<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1460<br>*************************</div>
