The<br>theorists of the past used mathematics only very charily, but language<br>copiously. In some cases this may have been due to mathematical<br>ignorance; no doubt it was. But in other cases it seems to have been<br>highly deliberate. It was felt that mathematics, if applied before one's<br>_assumptions_ had been presented with the utmost clarity, could lead<br>only to mistaken conclusions.<br><br>Modern theorists on the other hand, painfully trained in mathematical<br>habits of thought, but little accustomed to think profoundly in<br>language, and often under the vague impression that to state anything<br>mathematically is to gain public respect, very often pass over their<br>musical assumptions with an apologetic air, then turn to the most<br>involved calculations with an audible sigh of relief.<br><br>>From such persons using such a method, musical truth is most unlikely to<br>emerge. For it is in the assumptions which should be made, and not in<br>the mathematical methods, which are, in comparison, trivial, that the<br>true difficulties arise.<br><br>None of this is to disparage mathematics or abate its just claims;<br>mathematical truths compare in beauty to the highest conceptions of art,<br>and without mathematics there can be no sure foundation for musical<br>speculation at all. Used with circumspection, this science can stimulate<br>and condense thought in a very wonderful manner.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Paul Hahn <Paul-Hahn@library.wustl.edu><br>Subject:  Re: Paul E[h]rlich (sic)<br>PostedDate:  23-12-97 21:29:59<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  23-12-97 21:27:51-23-12-97 21:27:52,23-12-97 21:27:22-23-12-97 21:27:23<br>DeliveredDate:  23-12-97 21:27:23<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256576.007065C4; Tue, 23 Dec 1997 21:29:37 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA24610; Tue, 23 Dec 1997 21:29:59 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 23 Dec 1997 21:29:59 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA24638<br>Received: (qmail 29387 invoked from network); 23 Dec 1997 12:29:56 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 23 Dec 1997 12:29:56 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95q.971223141343.13040A-100000@library.wustl.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
