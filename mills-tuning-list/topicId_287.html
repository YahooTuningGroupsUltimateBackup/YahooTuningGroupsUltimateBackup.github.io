This ensemble is 23 <br>years in operation and focuses on microtonal performances and recordings.<br>They have available CDs of Giacinto Scelsi, Alain Bancquart, and Ivan <br>Wyschnegradsky, among others (mostly quartertonal).<br><br>The Varese work in this discussion was composed in 1957 as an <br>"experiment" by the composer who had been frustrated by his attempts to <br>have orchestral musicians simulate the glissando of the siren.  In the <br>attempt to attract Jazz musicians like Charlie Mingus, Teo Macero, Paul <br>Motion, Earle Brown, and others, an 8-part 16 measure chart was created <br>which I orchestrate and devise a from of about 8 minutes. <br><br>There have already been 3 performances of this work (named by Teo Macero <br>for obvious reasons, and where the original hangs).  Due to "new music" <br>performance expertise, performers can now do things that Varese could not <br>imagine.  For more on Varese's ideas on microtonality read: "The <br>Liberation of Sound" in *Perspectives on American Composers* edited by <br>Benjamin Boretz and Edward T. Cone (W.W. Norton & Co., NY, pp.25-33).<br><br>Sound contiuum is a powerful force.  Here it is used sans explicit <br>"shaped" intervals and the effect on the listener - even with different <br>instrumentation choices each time - has been of Bebop/New Music fusion.<br>The New York Times wrote of an AFMM performance that the Varese work had<br>"oddly joyful dissonances."<br><br>Does anyone out there have any ideas of people for me to meet in Paris <br>between Jan. 21-31?  The concert is Jan. 28th at 8 pm at the Pompidou Centre.<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@styx.ios.com<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 17 Jan 1996 19:44 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id KAA24892; Wed, 17 Jan 1996 10:44:49 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 17 Jan 1996 10:44:49 -0800<br>Message-Id: <9601171842.AA03302@abacus.bates.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
