While<br>the larger part of the article will deal with theory and music from the<br>late 14th to the late 16th centuries, I intend to include a fairly brief<br>final section on modern developments in extended just intonation. The<br>proposed word-count for the entire article is 1500 (to be agreed), but I<br>might ask for another 500; still, this is brief, so I can't mention<br>everything I'd like to (Partch, Tenney and Johnston will receive a<br>mention).<br><br>The deadline for the completed article is 15 November this year. I'm<br>making this request only so that no-one need complain afterwards that<br>I've left out something they think is of great importance. I can also<br>send an advance copy (whenever it's ready -- probably September) to<br>anyone who would like to make further suggestions.<br><br>Perhaps more important than this, I'd ask those of you who regularly use<br>Grove to take a look at any articles of relevance to the concerns of<br>this list: if you think any of them urgently need revising or replacing<br>please offer your suggestions. Grove is the first resort for so many<br>people, both within and outside academia, and for tuning topics, they<br>may well never look further. If you want to recommend yourself, or<br>someone else as author/reviser of an entry, I could make initial<br>enquiries by telephone with one of the editors (which is cheaper for me<br>than for those of you in the States). Remember that 15 November 1997 is<br>the general deadline, so it's not worth embarking on this process if you<br>don't think completion of anything authoratative is possible at such<br>short notice.<br><br>This message is purely a list matter -- I don't represent Grove, nor did<br>they suggest any of this. If you want to contact them directly about<br>revising or writing an entry, you needn't mention this message, because<br>they won't know anything about it.<br><br>Jonathan Walker<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  sejic@nersp.nerdc.ufl.edu<br>Subject:  Re: JI and Microtonal Glossary<br>PostedDate:  01-08-97 05:07:11<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  01-08-97 09:17:20-01-08-97 09:17:21,01-08-97 09:16:02-01-08-97 09:16:03<br>DeliveredDate:  01-08-97 09:16:03<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564E6.002804C7; Fri, 1 Aug 1997 09:17:07 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA31950; Fri, 1 Aug 1997 05:07:11 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 1 Aug 1997 05:07:11 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA31936<br>Received: (qmail 11741 invoked from network); 1 Aug 1997 03:05:40 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 1 Aug 1997 03:05:40 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199708010302.XAA18817@primary-name.ufl.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
