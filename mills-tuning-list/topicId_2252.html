In it he said.<br><br>>I thought we had decided that our "differences of opinion" were<br>>simply an error on your part. You were claiming that the LCM of<br>>a chord was proportional to the pattern length of the chord. I<br>>pointed out that this was only true under certain wild<br>>assumptions about the relative register of the chords. For<br>>example, the major triad (4:5:6) and the minor triad (10:12:15)<br>>both have an LCM of 60. For both chords, the pattern length of<br>>the chord as a whole is that of the frequency represented by the<br>>number 1. So in order to give both chords the same wavelength,<br>>you have to play the minor triad an octave plus a major third<br>>higher than the major triad. If you play them in the same<br>>register, the wavelength of the minor triad is 10/4 = 2.5 times<br>>longer than that of the major triad.<br><br>It's true that I was confused about this for awhile, actually,<br>quite a long while, and I would again like to thank you, Paul,<br>for bringing my error to my attention.  The pattern length of<br>chords is proportional to the LCM of their PERIODS, not the LCM<br>of their frequencies.  I discovered this when I was designing<br>frequency divider JI instruments in the mid 60's, but when I<br>wrote my sequencer for FM synthesis, which is frequency rather<br>than period oriented, I lost track of the distinction.  The<br>oversight was masked by the fact that chords with small lcms of<br>frequencies also tend to have small lcms of periods, since they<br>are all made up of the same set of prime factors.<br><br>Below is an ascii illustration of the periods of the triads<br>mentioned by Paul.  Those who are put off by long lists of<br>numbers would be well advised to skip the rest of this post.<br><br> 1  1 1 1    1  1  1<br> 2  2 2 2    2  2  2<br> 3  3 3 3    3  3  3<br> 4  1 4 4    4  4  4<br> 5  2 1 5    5  5  5<br> 6  3 2 1    6  6  6<br> 7  1 3 2    7  7  7<br> 8  2 4 3    8  8  8<br> 9  3 1 4    9  9  9<br>10  1 2 5   10 10 10<br>11  2 3 1    1 11 11<br>12  3 4 2    2 12 12<br>13  1 1 3    3  1 13<br>14  2 2 4    4  2 14<br>15  3 3 5    5  3 15<br>16  1 4 1    6  4  1<br>17  2 1 2    7  5  2<br>18  3 2 3    8  6  3<br>19  1 3 4    9  7  4<br>20  2 4 5   10  8  5<br>21  3 1 1    1  9  6<br>22  1 2 2    2 10  7<br>23  2 3 3    3 11  8<br>24  3 4 4    4 12  9<br>25  1 1 5    5  1 10<br>26  2 2 1    6  2 11<br>27  3 3 2    7  3 12<br>28  1 4 3    8  4 13<br>29  2 1 4    9  5 14<br>30  3 2 5   10  6 15<br>31  1 3 1    1  7  1<br>32  2 4 2    2  8  2<br>33  3 1 3    3  9  3<br>34  1 2 4    4 10  4<br>35  2 3 5    5 11  5<br>36  3 4 1    6 12  6<br>37  1 1 2    7  1  7<br>38  2 2 3    8  2  8<br>39  3 3 4    9  3  9<br>40  1 4 5   10  4 10<br>41  2 1 1    1  5 11<br>42  3 2 2    2  6 12<br>43  1 3 3    3  7 13<br>44  2 4 4    4  8 14<br>45  3 1 5    5  9 15<br>46  1 2 1    6 10  1<br>47  2 3 2    7 11  2<br>48  3 4 3    8 12  3<br>49  1 1 4    9  1  4<br>50  2 2 5   10  2  5<br>51  3 3 1    1  3  6<br>52  1 4 2    2  4  7<br>53  2 1 3    3  5  8<br>54  3 2 4    4  6  9<br>55  1 3 5    5  7 10<br>56  2 4 1    6  8 11<br>57  3 1 2    7  9 12<br>58  1 2 3    8 10 13<br>59  2 3 4    9 11 14<br>60  3 4 5   10 12 15<br><br>I think of the above diagram as a representation of a bunch of<br>frequency dividers hooked to a common frequency source.  As the<br>high-frequency source steps through its 60 states, the counters<br>step through 3, 4, 5 ... .etc states.<br><br>I thought we had this one straightened out.  As I remember it you<br>agreed with one of my tables of numbers, but maybe I'm not<br>remembering correctly.<br><br>The other issue, at least in my mind, was ratio invariance.  I<br>suppose it might have been better to use the term frequency<br>invariance.  To cover that one you need to go to the scale level.<br><br>Let's take an example 12-tone, 7-limit scale, which I believe is<br>the 12-tone, 7-limit scale with the smallest frequencies.<br><br>70 72 80 84 90 96 105 108 112 120 126 135<br><br>Here is that scales inversion, or the expression of the scale in<br>period form rather than frequency form.<br><br>224 240 252 270 280 288 315 336 360 378 420 432<br><br>This is the output of a program I wrote after my conversations<br>with Paul that takes the LCMs of the periods of a scale and<br>constructs a minimum set of chords without using the principle of<br>ratio/frequency invariance.<br><br>In other words, the same chord at a higher frequency has a<br>shorter period than one at a lower frequency, and thus comes up<br>first in the sort.<br><br>12 224<br>11 240<br>10 252<br> 9 270<br> 8 280<br> 7 288<br> 6 315<br> 5 336<br> 4 360<br> 3 378<br> 2 420<br> 1 432<br><br> 1- 5- 9 ;      1260   3   4   5<br> 3- 6-10 ;      1440   4   5   6<br> 1- 4-10 ;      1680   4   5   7<br> 1- 4- 7 ;      1680   4   5   6<br> 2- 5- 8 ;      1890   5   6   7<br> 4- 9-11 ;      2016   6   8   9<br> 0- 3-10 ;      2160   5   6   9<br><br>The numbers after the semicolons represent the periods of the<br>chords, not the LCMS adjusted for frequency.  Thus the two 4:5:7<br>chords are rated differently.  This is an interesting concept<br>even though it reversed the usual practice of rating similar<br>chords lower in the scale as more "fundamental" or "harmonious".<br><br>For example consider the many distinctions that are made in the<br>literature of the three major chords in the 7-tone Zarlino Scale.<br><br>I plan to do more work on this subject as soon as I can find the<br>time. I want to do a program that does period analysis on<br>frequency representations so that I can use it to generate chord<br>patterns for use with the my FM sequencer.  Also, I am still<br>working on my DSP music project.  That one uses period<br>representation throughout, but who knows when I'll get it done?<br>Too many fun things to do, and not enough time to do them in is<br>not really the worst problem to have.<br><br>Thanks again, Paul, for taking the time to analyze my work.  As<br>you find other problems, I would be very happy to hear about<br>them.<br><br>Marion<br><br><br><br>$AdditionalHeaders:  Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id C12564DA.000712CB; Sun, 20 Jul 1997 03:17:15 +0200</div>
