I think we should accept the broader definition <br>> of _wolf_that describes an effect or category of effects, rather than <br>> specific intervals, and when we intend a specific interval it would be <br>> best just to give the ratio itself.<br><br>I don't want to take the matter any further than this reply to Daniel, <br>before tedium sets in, but here, for what it's worth, is why I don't  <br>accept his appeal to what might seem, on the face of it, common sense. <br>Regular dictionaries are not normally adequate for technical terms that <br>require some theoretical background knowledge, and discussion in any <br>field beyond the most rudimentary level would be rendered impossible if <br>some participant were to insist that common dictionary definitions were <br>the proper basis for the use of technical terms. Even specialist <br>dictionaries such as Grove can't always be relied upon: anyone wanting <br>basic information about just intonation from Mark Lindley's entry will <br>gain a strange and most inadequate conception (the article is almost <br>entirely about JI keyboards -- try it, if you haven't already).<br><br>The second musical definition of wolf, concerning the acoustic <br>properties of violin etc. bodies, is also well established and quite <br>distinct -- it ought not to be taken as a sign of how hopelessly vague <br>"wolf" under another definition has become, any more than it should be <br>thought to render wolf qua *canis lupus* ambiguous.<br><br>The account Webster's gives for the first definition is not only too <br>vague by my reckoning, but is even misleading; here it is again: <br><br>> "a dissonance in some chords on organs, pianos, <br>> or other instruments with fixed tones tuned by unequal temperament"<br><br>This fails badly:<br>1. Wolves are also formed in non-tempered tunings, both Pythagorean and <br>just (I suspect the dictionary compiler thought all tunings are <br>temperaments).<br>2. Worst of all, wolves are _not_ a feature of the entire range of <br>well-tempered systems, which are all unequal -- in fact, as I said in <br>the previous message, well-tempered systems were devised _for the very <br>purpose of removing the wolf_.<br><br>My point, in the previous message, was that the use of "wolf" for a <br>40/27 collapsed the two problems of a JI 5-limit keyboard into one. The <br>diminished-sixth problem is shared with keyboards that use a <br>Pythagorean, meantone or meantone related, or other non-well-tempered <br>irregular system. The problem of the 40/27 (and other intervals that are <br>a syntonic comma flat or sharp for the same reason) is unique to 5-limit <br>keyboards. As a keyboard tuning for late 15th and 16th century music (as <br>Zarlino intended it), it is of no use; the discovery of the reasons for <br>this is perhaps the best route towards an appreciation of the virtues of <br>meantone for keyboard instruments.<br><br>In technical discussions, informed participants can only regulate <br>themselves, collectively; general purpose dictionaries cannot be <br>expected to serve as final arbiters. If we allow our terminology to <br>become ambiguous, or hopelessly vague, we have only ourselves to blame. <br>"Wolf" as in "wolf fifth" or "wolf fourth" is a useful term because it <br>covers the same phenomenon over a range of different keyboard <br>tunings/temperaments, and this means, as I said in the previous message <br>that it covers quite different intervals, e.g. the 3-limit wolf fifth a <br>Pythagorean comma flat of 3/2, and a 5-limit wolf of 192/125 41 cents <br>flat, with meantone-related temperaments falling between these extremes. <br>We even have the prospect of a wolf fifth which is closer to 3/2 than <br>the regular fifths of one temperament, namely, the 1/10-comma <br>temperament of the meantone family. The key to the concept, strictly <br>defined, is to avoid thinking in terms of enharmonic equivalence, and to <br>think of each note of the upper rank ("black" notes) as fulfilling one <br>of two functions, but never both; the correct spelling of the interval, <br>as G# to Eb etc., will always distinguish the wolf interval from the <br>normal interval in a given tuning, whatever size the wolf interval <br>happens to be. In the case of the 40/27 problem on a 5-limit keyboard, <br>the spelling is correctly D to A: this is not a problem of letter names <br>and sharp/flat chromas, but of plus/minus syntonic comma inflections.<br><br>Fragmenting this phenomenon by stating precisely (by ratio) which <br>intervals are concerned -- as Daniel suggests -- falls short of a <br>complete solution: there are theoretical and historical contexts (in  <br>15th to 18th century music) where a given piece could and would have <br>been rendered according to different tunings, and "wolf" is needed in <br>such contexts. Quite apart from being inappropriately precise in these <br>contexts, how many people could tell, at a glance, what 192/125, <br>262144/177147 and 128/5^(11/4) all have in common?<br><br>(Answer: The wolf fifths of the just, Pythagorean and 1/4-comma meantone <br>systems respectively, which lie 41 cents sharp, 23.5 cents flat and 35 <br>cents sharp of 3/2, but are each the diminished sixth within their <br>respective systems.)<br>-- <br>Jonathan Walker<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 7 Dec 1996 22:25 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05249; Sat, 7 Dec 1996 22:27:17 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09565<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA22719; Sat, 7 Dec 1996 13:27:14 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 7 Dec 1996 13:27:14 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612071625_MC1-CBE-2519@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
