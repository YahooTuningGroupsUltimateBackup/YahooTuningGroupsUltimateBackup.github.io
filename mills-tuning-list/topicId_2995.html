On the tape it's<br>> difficult to locate a particular composer and composition, which is espe-<br>> cially valuable on a contribution/collection work.<br><br>   Somebody who just now read that replied to me directly, concerned that I<br>was kinda insensitive to criticize Denis Atadan's work in producing the<br>Tuning-List Tape-Swap Tape - his work on the liner notes especially.<br><br>   Ziiiikes!  I certainly hope that nobody else got that utterly false<br>impression.  Let me assure all of you about two things:<br>1.  In saying that, I was only referring to the fact that on a CD you can seek<br>    a particular track by number, whereas on a cassette you obviously don't<br>    have that option.  I was not by any means suggesting that Denis did anything<br>    wrong with the liner notes.<br>2.  I am very pleased with and grateful for Denis' work on the Tuning-List tape.<br>    I think (and I know that many others feel the same) that it was a wonderful,<br>    pioneering effort.  I wouldn't be distributing the tape further if I didn't<br>    believe in it.<br><br>   So I'll say "thanks Denis for your efforts".  You did great!<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Re: instruments -- guitar tuning<br>PostedDate:  06-01-98 05:19:48<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  06-01-98 05:19:28-06-01-98 05:19:28,06-01-98 05:19:24-06-01-98 05:19:25<br>DeliveredDate:  06-01-98 05:19:25<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256584.0017BDA0; Tue, 6 Jan 1998 05:19:18 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA25759; Tue, 6 Jan 1998 05:19:48 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 6 Jan 1998 05:19:48 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA25772<br>Received: (qmail 1384 invoked from network); 5 Jan 1998 20:19:03 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 5 Jan 1998 20:19:03 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541111b0d709d6be92@[207.207.2.146]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6972 href="#6972">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;jloffink&#x22; &#x3C;jloffink@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/1998 10:07:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> As an  Appendix to the discussion paper I had the idea of including a<br>> list of features/improvements that would specifically benefit<br>> composers and others who use MIDI and digital audio for alternative<br>> tunings.<br>><br>> Anyhow, the gist of all this is : my wish list would include things<br>> like :<br>><br>> Tuning resolution minimum 1 cent, preferably less (any thoughts on<br>> this?); Number of Partials (Keygroups, Zones) limited by memory only,<br>> not hard coded into the architecture;  Include on-board absolute pitch<br>> meter (but would put the price up); Macro and template procedures for<br>> building unconventional `instruments';<br>><br>Tuning resolution of sample/wavetable based instruments better than 1 cent<br>is questionable since no manufacturer will tune their own samples to better<br>accuracy than this.

So is the argument circular?<br>Would better resolution therefore have a knock on effect?  Probably<br>not, since the library makers aren't interested in exact tuning.  The<br>question (as I see it) is -  is better resolution only needed for<br>very special purposes, or do a considerable proportion of members of<br>this list feel it would be valuable?

Please excuse my ignorance<br>of this stuff.<br><br>> Building tunings into "Partials", Keygroups or Zones is tedious and<br>> wasteful effort in my opinion.<br><br>Yes, it's extremely tedious - but my point is that it needn't be,<br>even on a sampler.  Hence the idea of creating on-board macros or<br>templates to speed up the process.  The reason why it's not a waste<br>of effort (for me) is that I'm creating simulations of acoustic<br>instruments.  The difference between what one can achieve in this<br>respect on a sampler and a synth is enormous (IMO) - but of course<br>not everybody is interested in simulation.<br><br>>Today's synthesizers support hundreds of<br>> patches/programs, doing it that way virtually hard codes the tuning into<br>> the sample set and increases your memory requirements exponentially.  I<br>> don't think there's much question that most users prefer separate tuning<br>> tables,<br><br>Agreed - so would I! And I don't think there's an immutable reason it<br>can't be done on a sampler! In fact the Roland does have something<br>which sort of works like this - but not well enough.  Since a sampler<br>is a kind of relational database, there shouldn't be any reason why,<br>(given 1998 processors et al) the relational mappings need not be<br>much more flexible and friendly.  So, (from my view at least, but I'd<br>be interested to know if others would like this too), it seems<br>worth arguing that updating the 'database architecture' would be a<br>great idea for making the best of the  sonic benefits of sampling<br>(for specific purposes).  But, maybe sampling technology will soon be<br>(successfully) surpassed - let's hope so.<br><br>>the issues are:<br><br>> Do you want octave based tables?<br>> Do you want keyboard based tables?

Supposing you wanted to map the sampler for a '22-ET string<br>>trio' (to use my previous example) - would it be easy?<br><br>   First of all, Ensoniq's "pitch tables" cover the full range of MIDI<br>key#s, each independent of the others.  Each key may have any arbitrary<br>pitch you'd like it to, irrelevant of the pitches you assign to any of the<br>other keys.  (Well, each key's pitch is arbitrary within available pitch<br>resolution of course.)  Each instrument may have as many as 8 pitch tables<br>(although selecting more than four rapidly is a bit tricky).<br><br>   To set up a repeating pattern of pitches, such as 12-Toned Ptolemaic JI<br>in C, you enter the pitches for the keys C4 through C5.  You would set, for<br>example, E4 14 cents flat of the 12TET reference.  (Actually, that's not<br>exactly true;  you specify pitches between 0 and 99 cents above whatever<br>12TET pitch reference lies directly below it, so you'd define the E4 key<br>top play an Eb4 86 cents sharp.)  Notice that you set the pitch of both of<br>the C4 and of the C5, the C5 being an octave higher than the C4.<br><br>   You then tell it to "extrapolate" the pitch table from C4 to C5.  That<br>causes it to duplicate the pattern of pitches between C4 and B4 upon the<br>pitch you chose for C5, and again on C6, C7, C3, C2, etc.<br><br>   In my 88CET tuning scheme, what looks visually on the keyboard to be an<br>octave, instead spans a 7:4 (88CET's very-close approximation that is).  So<br>in 88CET I set C4 and C5 to be 7:4 apart, and when I extrapolate the table,<br>I get something that repeats in 7:4s instead of octaves.<br><br>   Now, 22TET...  You have a very basic question to answer before you can<br>set it up.  What keyboard mapping do you want?  How do you want pitches in<br>the tuning to map to keys on the keyboard?  A common way is to map them<br>"linearly", each key 1/22nd of an octave apart, mismatching octave<br>boundaries in the tuning with those on the keyboard.  If that's the way you<br>want to map it, then set the pitches of the keys C4 through Bb5 to<br>successive 22nds of an octave, and extrapolate your table from C4 to Bb5.<br><br>   Many of Ensoniq's "synthesizer" series, like their VFX (and<br>unfortunately unlike their samplers), have an additional pitch-table<br>function called "interpolate", which creates equal divisions.  So, to tune<br>22TET on the VFX, you...<br>1.  Tune Bb5 to an octave above C4.<br>2.  Interpolate the tuning between C4 and Bb5.  This sets the 22 pitches between<br>    those two keys to successive 22nds of an octave apart.<br>3.  Extrapolate the tuning from C4 to Bb5.  This duplicates the 22TET tuning<br>    that "interpolate" created between C4 and Bb5 across the whole MIDI range.<br><br>   An alternative to mapping keys linearly is to break the tuning into<br>several 12-toned subsets that can be mapped on octave boundaries, and<br>switch off between them using the patch-select keys.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Re: MIDI/Audio wish list<br>PostedDate:  13-01-98 03:24:53<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  13-01-98 03:24:17-13-01-98 03:24:18,13-01-98 03:24:07-13-01-98 03:24:07<br>DeliveredDate:  13-01-98 03:24:07<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125658B.000D34AA; Tue, 13 Jan 1998 03:24:43 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA23219; Tue, 13 Jan 1998 03:24:53 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 13 Jan 1998 03:24:53 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA23293<br>Received: (qmail 23676 invoked from network); 12 Jan 1998 18:24:52 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 12 Jan 1998 18:24:52 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541105b0e02dc8ea40@[207.207.3.53]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=7017 href="#7017">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>1/12/1998 6:24:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Each instrument may have as many as 8 pitch tables<br>>(although selecting more than four rapidly is a bit tricky).<br><br>   I should have said "... although selecting between more than four ..."<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.

Increasing the number of 'partials' has<br>no effect on the used sample RAM on the Roland or AKAI systems. (It<br>does on the EMU, but, as I understand, so little that it is<br>negligible). On the Roland -  suppose there are 4 samples in memory,<br>of flute tones, Eb4, F#4, A4 and C5; and that they take up 2Mb.  You<br>then create a 'one octave 41-ET'  flute, by creating 41 'partials'<br>which map each of 3 samples to 10 divisions of the scale, and the 4th<br>sample to the remaining 11 divisions, such that you can now play this<br>scale over 3 and a bit standard-keyboard-octaves.  The mapping from<br>sample to 'partial' is one-many, and you've still only used 2Mb RAM.<br>On the Roland there is no limit to the degree of one-many-ness,<br>excepting the limits on samples and 'partials' (512 and 255<br>respectively).  (Actually this is not quite right - the relation is<br>many-many, except that the maximum number of samples that can be<br>associated with any one 'partial' is 4.)<br><br>For your interest, there is also a 'micro-key-follow'<br>tuning facility in the Roland S7XX series, whereby you can<br>'interpolate' (to use Gary's 'Ensoniq' terminology) a 'partial'<br>across the (any part of the) keyboard in 1/8ths of a semitone, 2/8 of<br>same, 3/8, 4/8 (quarter tones), 5/8,7/8, 8/8 (12-ET), 9/8, etc up to<br>16/8 of a semitone (whole tones).<br><br>> >I'm sorry if this is getting too technical again, but you can't really<br>> >understand the ramifications of your requests without a little understanding<br>> >on how today's synthesizers and samplers work.  My points are 1) for<br>> >microtonal scales to be implemented in mass produced instruments it must be<br>> >economically realistic for the manufacturers to do so, and 2) for microtonal<br>> >scales to be used by non-specialists it must be as easy as possible for them<br>> >to be changed.  You can't accomplish either of these by defining microtonal<br>> >scales at the "Partial" or zone level.<br><br>I agree entirely with the general points 1 and 2.  I'm unconvinced<br>however about the last sentence of this paragraph.  Samplers, if used<br>for anything approaching realism, will require significant amounts of<br>RAM whatever the 'partial'/zone architecture etc, at least until<br>some form of data compression of the 16 bit format is introduced (or<br>something). The fact that EMU have implemented 128Mb on the E4<br>seems to confirm this - they didn't build it for composers working<br>with ATS.  More 'partials' does not mean more RAM;  on the Roland<br>(at least) only samples take up sample RAM.<br><br>But I suspect you may have other (good) reasons for saying what you<br>do (?).<br><br>Gary Morrison wrote:<br><br>>    To set up a repeating pattern of pitches, such as 12-Toned Ptolemaic JI<br>> in C, you enter the pitches for the keys C4 through C5.  You would set, for<br>> example, E4 14 cents flat of the 12TET reference.  (Actually, that's not<br>> exactly true;  you specify pitches between 0 and 99 cents above whatever<br>> 12TET pitch reference lies directly below it, so you'd define the E4 key<br>> top play an Eb4 86 cents sharp.)  Notice that you set the pitch of both of<br>> the C4 and of the C5, the C5 being an octave higher than the C4.<br><br>Thanks, Gary.  I've seen this sort-of kind-of thing on various<br>synths. Can I ask a further question?  I understand what you have<br>described, that is if you want one single sound (either a synthesised<br>sound or a sample) mapped to this kind of 'key-table'.  But, on the<br>Ensoniq sampler, if you want to achieve some simulatory realism<br>do you have to laboriously map each sample to a point or points on<br>the key-table - or is that not something that can be done (or is nor<br>worth the trouble etc)?  (Please excuse me, I'm aware of being<br>very biased toward wanting realism.  I know that's not what everyone<br>wants - and it should not bias this discussion.  But it's what<br>interests me about these machines!)<br><br>>    Now, 22TET...  You have a very basic question to answer before you can<br>> set it up.  What keyboard mapping do you want?  How do you want pitches in<br>> the tuning to map to keys on the keyboard?  A common way is to map them<br>> "linearly", each key 1/22nd of an octave apart, mismatching octave<br>> boundaries in the tuning with those on the keyboard.  If that's the way you<br>> want to map it, then set the pitches of the keys C4 through Bb5 to<br>> successive 22nds of an octave, and extrapolate your table from C4 to Bb5.<br><br>In my work I've created simulations of many of the standard<br>orchestral instruments for every n-ET between 13 and 36, (and some<br>others above, especially 41) in each case creating a single<br>partial-sample relationship for each pitch (!).  Creating them is one<br>thing - learning to play them all is another!  In most cases the<br>keyboard mapping I've used is simply 'keyboard-chromatic', since I<br>get used to re-remembering where the octaves (and everything else)<br>are. Anything less than but near to a multiple of 12, I cheat a bit,<br>and ditch a key somewhere.<br><br>Patrick Ozzard-Low<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Subject:  Surman/b5 ratios<br>PostedDate:  15-01-98 00:34:56<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  15-01-98 00:34:22-15-01-98 00:34:22,15-01-98 00:34:09-15-01-98 00:34:09<br>DeliveredDate:  15-01-98 00:34:09<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125658C.00817A61; Thu, 15 Jan 1998 00:34:43 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02348; Thu, 15 Jan 1998 00:34:56 +0100<br>Date: Thu, 15 Jan 1998 00:34:56 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02386<br>Received: (qmail 17326 invoked from network); 14 Jan 1998 15:34:52 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 14 Jan 1998 15:34:52 -0800<br>Message-Id: <34BD5343.695@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
