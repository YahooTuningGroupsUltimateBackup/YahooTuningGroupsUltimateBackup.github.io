I think they are @ UCSC.  I think<br>they are also free.  I do not know if they are public, or what, but if<br>they are, I highly recommend going. The style of vocal music that he will<br>be teaching is all purely intoned.  If you haven't had exposure to it, it<br>is an excellent way to experience the qualities of such tuning when<br>performed with the human voice.  Terry is an excellent teacher, and even<br>if you don't have much interest in indian music, you will probably learn<br>some very fundamental things about music in general if you attend.<br><br>If I weren't finishing school right now I'd fly down to CA also.<br><br><br>passing the word, <br>Jesse Gay</div>
