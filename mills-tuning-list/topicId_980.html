Why? Simply remember that the cognitive domain,<br>>where the "similarity" operation is accomplished (for both octaves and<br>>"morenoctaves" --which are not just simply powers of 3 but psychological<br>>categories), must not be confused with the psychoacoustical domain --where<br>>squre waves live. This confusion of domains, to which unfortunately most<br>>researchers with a physical bacground are prone (including one of my thesis<br>>advisers, John Pierce) is the downfall of anyone trying to understand a<br>>*musical* phenomenon.<br><br>I think I agree very much with you here. We don't hear square waves in terms <br>of their individual components, we just hear the fundamental of each <br>(incomplete) harmonic series and associate a (hollow, buzzy) timbre with <br>them. Now did you find that other relationships, such as powers of 2.718, <br>could not evoke cognitive similarity?<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 10 Oct 1996 19:26 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05241; Thu, 10 Oct 1996 19:27:33 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05239<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id KAA07733; Thu, 10 Oct 1996 10:27:29 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 10 Oct 1996 10:27:29 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01540b02ae82e0c264b2@[128.176.20.73]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
