What makes all of the difference between the<br>> different instrumental timbres is the detailed differences within those<br>> spectra, and of course their attack-transient characteristics.<br><br>Dear Gary:Thank you very much for the graphics. I did indeed labor under the flute/sine<br>wave misconception, and I'm glad to be set straight. Your statement about the<br>differences in timbre being largely determined by the differences in spectra (and the<br>attack-transient characteristics) is spot-on.<br>All The Best,<br>Dr_Orient</div>
