I found his technique very original, but there is a more<br>straightforward method:<br><br>When creating or editing your sample root to key assignments in the <br>Keymap editor, you will note that you can offset the pitch of any MIDI<br>note number (actually, all but 0-11) by plus or minus 48 semitones, as well<br>as plus or minus any number of cents up to 100 (= 1 semitone). Using this <br>method, you can divide your octave, twelfth, or whichever favorite interval<br>ANY WAY YOU LIKE, provided that to-the-cent accuracy is good enough for you.<br><br>If the thought of calculating these offset values intimidates you, you <br>might like a copy of a K2000 tuning program I've written for the Mac.<br>It only outputs text files, and it doesn't yet assign the appropriate <br>sample root to your keys. However, it does calculate any just or equal<br>division of the octave, and presents its results as offsets to each<br>MIDI note no. <br><br>Regrettably, I haven't yet posted this on the web yet, but if enough of<br>you are interested, or if someone can volunteer a chunk of cyberspace, <br>I'll be happy to do so. In the meantime, send me a personal requesting it.<br><br><br>he program is stand-alone, and has an ugly command-line interface, but it <br>does the job.<br><br>Harold Fortuin<br>hfortuin@delphi.com<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 25 Dec 1995 22:05 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id NAA05312; Mon, 25 Dec 1995 13:05:05 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 25 Dec 1995 13:05:05 -0800<br>Message-Id: <01HZ8A6RNNHK9BVQOK@delphi.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
