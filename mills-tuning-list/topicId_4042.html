First how can this be meaused.<br>secound what is the suposed threshold of this perception of a "middle"<br>pitch. As someone who has been working with beats I don't hear it this<br>way at all.<br>    Also in regard to the history of microtonal music in xenharmonikon<br>XVII , there is the whole ethnocentric problem that everyone else in the<br>world has been exploring microtones all along. Isd it really relevant.<br>Wolf omissions are to be noted but why not include any and all<br>percussion music. Soon or later it becomes so inclusive that the term<br>microtonal becomes meaningless.<br>--<br>Kraig Grady<br>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br>http://www.anaphoria.com</div>
