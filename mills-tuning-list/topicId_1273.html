I don't consider myself a lurker so much as a learner.<br> <br>    I first knew something was up when, as a teenager tuning my guitar,  I<br>discovered that if I tuned the open strings' adjacent 5ths and 4th to my<br>liking that the high an low open E strings would beat like mad.  Something<br>wasn't adding up.  The search for why led me to learn a little music<br>theory, a little acoustic theory and the basis of 12-TET.  I wasn't aware<br>that anyone was attempting anything different until I stumbled across<br>Partch's 'Genesis of a Music' at the Vancouver Public Library.  It was an<br>awakening.  During the Seventies I built a few analog synth kits and tuned<br>some of the oscillators so that I could hear 7/4 et al.  I decided 'normal'<br>music was 'out of tune' and that JI was the only way to go.  After<br>designing some circuitry to convert analog synths to JI, I concluded that<br>it would be too difficult and expensive for me with my limited resources to<br>pursue with the technology of the time.  I simply gave up for awhile.<br><br>    Ten years later I wrote a program in Basic on my Amiga PC to input and<br>playback JI with the ratios based on 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 21, 25, 35, 49. Using<br>these as both numerators and denominators in a tonal array, Partch style, I<br>was able to play four part harmony using 256 point user defined waveforms<br>(both limits of Amiga Basic.) Again, due to the limits of my tools, and the<br>feeling that I was working in isolation, I lost interest.<br><br>    Several more years passed. In 1994 in a book called 'The Musicians<br>Guide to MIDI' by Christian Braut, I found out about the MIDI Tuning<br>Standard and the Just Intonation Network.  Reading 'The Just Intonation<br>Primer' by David Doty revealed that tunable synths had been around for a<br>several years already!  When, in 1995, I started exploring the internet,<br>one of the first things I checked out was the newly minted Just Intonation<br>Network web page. That page mentioned this forum, so here I am.<br><br>    Since coming here I have learned as much as I did in all those lonely<br>years before.  I have learned that JI isn't necessarily 'the only way to<br>go' and that there is a growing community of innovators pushing the<br>boundaries of tuning into areas I never dreamed of.<br>    I believe that, with ever-improving technology of music making and<br>world wide communication, that the theories and techniques discussed here<br>will increasingly move out of the province of academics and isolated<br>visionaries and into the mainstream.<br><br>    Thanks, and I hope I haven't taken too much of your time.<br>    ---Fred.<br>     <br>--------------------------------------------------------<br> Fred Kohler, #7-240 Burnside Rd E, Victoria, BC, Canada<br> phone:(250)388-7918  email:Fred_Kohler@bc.sympatico.ca<br>---------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 28 Nov 1996 22:16 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10725; Thu, 28 Nov 1996 22:18:30 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11097<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA07246; Thu, 28 Nov 1996 13:18:27 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 28 Nov 1996 13:18:27 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009AC1022A9145A0.5578@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
