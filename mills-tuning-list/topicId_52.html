I thought I had remembered<br>>reading a reference to flat fifths somewhere; one hour of going through my<br>>notes yielded nothing, however.  My apologies to yourself, Mr. Reinhard<br>>and members of this List for this flub.<br><br>Thank you; I accept your apology.<br><br>[snip]<br>>Sorry, my original quote should have read: "What Marpurg probably meant<br>>to say was that if all the major thirds where to be made [equally as] wide, a<br>>major third, wide by a syntonic comma, was not possible."  Marpurg,<br>>however, was still wrong.  The passage in question here is, admittedly,<br>>sloppy work on the part of Marpurg.  As anyone familiar with his work in<br>>temperament knows, this is not characteristic of Marpurg's work, where he<br>>is one of the most precise writers in18th-century Germany.<br><br>Gee--maybe it was someone else pretending to be him? :-)<br><br>[snip]<br>>I have spent many years reading the primary sources.  In writing my<br>>dissertation, I've read all of Marpurg, all of Kirnberger and everyone else<br>>that dealt with tuning and temperament in Germany.  Undoubtedly, I've<br>>missed some sources.  But not a lot, I trust.  Unlike today, when scientific<br>>writing tends to adhere to the "stylus dragneticus," 18th-century German<br>>scientific writing was very personal (there are exceptions) and one quickly<br>>becomes almost "personally" familiar with the writer.  One knows how they<br>>thought and gets a strong feeling as to what they would react like given a<br>>certain set of circumstances.  Spending so much time with them, I almost<br>>feel as if I knew these men, who died over 200 years ago.  If I make a<br>>conjecture, it is based on this intimacy and a body of evidence.  It is not<br>>incorrect jurisprudence to extrapolate postulates based on a given body of<br>>evidence and knowledge of the subject's past behavior.<br><br>Well, I have to admit I'm impressed by the amount of time and effort<br>you've spent on the subject.  Nevertheless, I assert that a subjective<br>impression based on vast experience is still a subjective impression.<br>Surely, drawing upon all that knowledge, you can point to some piece of<br>objective evidence that would convince a skeptic?<br><br>[snip]<br>>>The following two quotes are from _A History of Key Characteristics in<br>>>the Eighteenth and Early Nineteenth Centuries_, by Rita Steblin (UMI<br>>>Research Press, 1983), already cited once in this thread.<br>>><br>>>p.91:<br>>>: It is known that Marpurg's attack caused Kirnberger much bitter<br>>>: anguish: he poured out his vexation in a series of letters to Forkel<br>>>: from 1779-80.  . . . although Kirnberger did not publish a<br>>>: counterattack himself, he did include a defense written by the<br>>>: important mathematician and military officer at the Berlin court,<br>>>: Georg Friedrich Tempelhof (1737-1807).<br>><br>>Although I admire Ms. Steblin's writings, I believe that she is wrong here.<br>>Although Tempelhof may have begun the review in question, Kirnberger<br>>himself (trying to pull a 'Marpurg') must have finished it.  This is evident in<br>>the break of literary style (Tempelhof's and Kirnberger's litterary styles are<br>>completely dissimilar) and I would be very surprised indeed that if, upon<br>>meeting Kirnberger in the afterlife, he would tell me that Tempelhof wrote<br>>the whole thing...    ;)<br><br>If I may remind anyone who may still be reading this seemingly<br>interminable thread, this all came up because Mr. Frosztega asserted<br>that Kirnberger failed to rebut Marpurg's assertions because he knew<br>Marpurg was right.  Whether Kirnberger or Tempelhof wrote the essay in<br>question, while an interesting question, is not particularly germane;<br>the fact is, Kirnberger took vigorous action to defend his position.<br><br>(BTW, I'm an atheist.  I don't plan to wait around for an afterlife I<br>don't believe in to ask Kirnberger to resolve the issue. :-)<br><br>>>p.92:<br>>>: Marpurg, the avowed disciple of Rameau, had drawn clear battle lines<br>>>: between his theories in support of equal temperament and those of<br>>>: Kirnberger.  Since the latter had declared that his primary intention in<br>>>: _Die Kunst_ was to transmit the theoretical principles of J.S. Bach,<br>>>: Marpurg's cruelest blow was the accusation that Kirnberger was not<br>>>: faithful to Bach--not faithful because, as Marpurg contended, Bach had<br>>>: actually taught Kirnberger to tune in equal temperament.<br>><br>>Bzzzz.  Wrong again.  The quote to which Ms.Steblin refers (contained in<br>>the infamous 23er Abschnitt of Marpurg's _Versuch_ ) is not about<br>>whether Kirnberger was being faithful to Bach or not.  It was about<br>>Kirnberger's invocation of authority over empirical evidence.  Read the<br>>section yourself, then we can talk (_Versuch_ [1776], pp.182-219).<br><br>I'm probably going to have to concede this one, because my German,<br>sadly, is much worse that Mr. Frosztega's English, and I don't know when<br>I'd be able to spend the time to work through that much of it.<br><br>[snip]<br>>>: backfired, and Kirnberger was able to end _Die Kunst_ with the<br>>>following<br>>>: passage taken from a letter that C.P.E. Bach had sent him:<br>>>:<br>>>:      The conduct of Herr Marpurg against you is abominable. . . . You<br>>>:      may proclaim that my fundamental principles and those of my late<br>>>:      father are anti-Rameau.<br>>>:<br>>>: In this manner Kirnberger managed to get in a final blow.  Although it<br>>>: is not clear whether this quotation applies specifically to unequal<br>>>: temperament and key characteristics, there is no reason to believe that<br>>>: this topic--so important in Kirnberger's writing--should be excluded<br>>>: from the anti-Rameauist principles espoused by the Bachs.<br>><br>>Wow.  Ms. Steblin streches quite a bit in drawing this conclusion.<br><br>Perhaps, but it seems no greater a stretch than some that Rasch makes in<br>his article.<br><br>>My feeling is that the passage in question refers to Marpurg's _Versuch_ on<br>>the whole (remember that the second half of the _Versuch_  (90-some<br>>pages) has nothing to do with temperament but is a giant polemic on<br>>Kirnbergers harmonic theories as opposed to Rameau's (which Marpurg<br>>really didn't fully understand himself).<br><br>If it has nothing to do with temperament, then it really isn't going to<br>help with the question at hand, is it?<br><br>Okay, let me see where we stand here:<br><br> 1.  You admit you accidentally misrepresented the evidence Rasch<br>     offered in his article.<br><br> 2.  You admit Marpurg made an error (however uncharacteristic) in the<br>     passage Rasch quotes.<br><br> 3.  You assert that your great familiarity with the relevant literature<br>     qualifies you to speculate about the matter in question, but you<br>     have so far presented no concrete evidence to back up that<br>     speculation.<br><br> 4.  You then go off on several tangents, which as far as I can see<br>     (with one possible exception) have very little to do with what<br>     temperament Bach used.<br><br>Well, gosh, I'm convinced!  Can't understand why I didn't see it<br>before--of COURSE Bach used equal temperament!<br><br>(Sarcasm aside, really, Mr. Frosztega: if the evidence is really that<br>overwhelming, can't you present us with some of it?  What little you've<br>given us so far I find unimpressively weak.  Bach surely had input on<br>the construction of some organs; if any surviving ones are in ET and are<br>known to have been that way since Bach's time, that would be a good<br>sign.  Tuning instructions reliably attributed to him would also do.)<br><br>--pH (manynote@library.wustl.edu or http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote)<br>       O<br>      /\             "Do you like to gamble, Eddie?<br>     -\-\-- o         Gamble money on pool games?"<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 29 Sep 1995 13:12 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id EAA13134; Fri, 29 Sep 1995 04:11:49 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 29 Sep 1995 04:11:49 -0700<br>Message-Id: <009971F584C0AB39.29CF@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
