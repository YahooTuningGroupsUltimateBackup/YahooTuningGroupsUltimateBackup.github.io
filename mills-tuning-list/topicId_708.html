It just reminds me of the Gamelan<br>>Sekar Jaya performance I saw a month ago in Marin: at the end of the<br>>concert, the players cordially invited the entire audience to come down and<br>>bang on their gamelan instruments.  Only request was that you not step over<br>>them, out of respect for the spirit of the instruments.  -rick<br><br>>From my Gamelan days I remember doing this after a number of performances.<br>I hope Sekar Jaya didn't use the verb "bang" when describing what one does<br>with a Gamelan instrument.  We always had to watch people like a hawk to<br>make sure that they played the gong with the right end of the mallet to keep<br>it from being damaged for instance.  Gamelans lend themselves much better to<br>playing by inexperienced music makers than do Partch's instruments- we still<br>had to be careful and respectful of them.<br><br>I do tend to put Partch in his own category- I can't think of a single other<br>composer that built his own instruments, developed his own theory of music<br>(albiet from many pre-existing sources) and then wrote a body of fascinating<br>and compelling music using these instruments.  Unfortunately my only<br>exposure to his music is through records.  I still remember Skip LaPlante's<br>performance with his Kithara copy at an AFMM concert of a Partch piece a<br>couple of years ago- it's the closest thing to a performance I've seen.  <br><br><br>Steve Curtin<br>Ensoniq Corp<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 9 Aug 1996 18:55 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04836; Fri, 9 Aug 1996 18:55:33 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04837<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA07550; Fri, 9 Aug 1996 09:55:26 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 9 Aug 1996 09:55:26 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199608091651.AA04177@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
