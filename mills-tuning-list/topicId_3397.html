For most compositions, 1 beat<br>per hour will be good enough.  For such slow beating between tones<br>of 10kHz, you need about 10^7 steps to the octave, or 0.1 millicent<br>step size.  This is the highest precision that can have any real<br>meaning, and would be restricted to specialist equipment.<br><br>This is obviously beyond what any human could produce, because<br>you'd have to hold the pitch steady for half an hour to be sure<br>it's in tune.  The Midi Tuning Standard covers most realistic<br>tuning scenarios.  We should be lobbying for that to be implemented<br>fully.  If an instrument's designed specifically for JI, it makes<br>more sense to specify raw frequency ratios and forget cents.  It<br>may be possible to program a synth to adjust the phase to eliminate<br>beating.<br><br>The heading is JI, but I'll mention temperaments anyway. The<br>fifth in 19-equal is 5.3 cents flat of the 12-equal fifth.  This<br>means there are 5 different meantones that can be accurately<br>reproduced with cent steps.  It would be nicer to have 100 to<br>choose from, requiring 0.05 cent steps.  I reckon on 0.1 cent<br>steps distinguish all the important meantones.  That's all I need.<br><br>Enthusiasts for 5-limit JI who really think 53-equal is an<br>unacceptable compromise obviously need better than 0.15 cent steps.<br><br><br>Come on, does anyone have _quantitative_ data on the inharmonicity<br>of orchestra instruments?  The piano octave is about 2 cents<br>sharp, so presumably other instruments must be better than this.<br>By how much?<br><br>This is a good reason not to read Helmholtz/Ellis as an exclusive<br>source.  Inharmonicity hadn't been measured that accurately in<br>those days.<br><br>Naked reeds do produce near enough periodic vibrations.  That's<br>how mouth organs work, and other instruments as well.  Accordions<br>sound likely.  With clarinets and whatever, the pitch is selected<br>by the tube.  Where chipmunking occurs with wind samples, it's<br>probably because of the original reed spectrum.  I think the<br>sound source in flutes is truly unpitched, because it's all<br>turbulence.<br><br>Brass instruments really are aperiodic.  I read about this since<br>the last time it came up.  The worst tuned partials are the low<br>ones for a conical tube.  Even valve horns rarely play the<br>fundamental for this reason.<br><br><br>                    Graham Breed<br>      gbreed@cix.co.uk        www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/</div>
