(I've been getting into the soprano sax recently in<br>order to improve my skills in WX-11-based sequencing of microtonal music, and to<br>have fun of course.)  <br><br>   After a really nice dinner, he proposed that we play some saxophone quartets<br>with his wife and her sister.  I was not up to that since I've only played sax<br>for a couple months or so, and since many of my basic performance skills have<br>faded dreadfully after about six years of composing and theorizing instead of<br>performing!  <br><br>   So upon embarrassing myself over that, I hoped to impress them with a demo<br>tape on 88CET tuning.  In it I went over 88CET's unusual thirds and 7:4, using<br>my "Alternative Fuels" suite to let them get a feel for each.  It then went on<br>to show how you can, with effort, do traditional harmony in 88CET.  <br><br>   Well, the good news is that I redeemed myself.  (Well, I'm exaggerating;  the<br>quartets went OK.)  But the good part is that 88CET demo went off quite well.<br>They got exactly right impression.  Beyond just general comments of it being<br>"interesting" and such, here are two approximate quotes:<br><br>   "I was afraid that it would be unbearable to listen to, but it was <br>    actually quite enjoyable."<br>    <br>   "It's unusual, but there's a definite, alien logic to it.  It's not <br>    just haphazard."<br><br>   But perhaps more importantly, they asked a lot of meaty questions, like:<br><br>   "How do you notate this?"<br><br>   "Is it difficult to voice chords in a nonoctave framework?"<br><br>   "Have you considered writing this stuff for movie music?"<br><br>   "Are you pretty much limited to electronic instruments for this sort of <br>    tuning?"<br><br>   "How did you come up with a step size of 88 cents?"<br><br>   "Have you written in other tunings?"<br><br>   So there's another band (literally!) of musicians to greet xenharmonics<br>positively.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 1 Dec 1996 20:37 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13660; Sun, 1 Dec 1996 20:39:14 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13654<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA28631; Sun, 1 Dec 1996 11:39:12 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 1 Dec 1996 11:39:12 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961201193012_71670.2576_HHB45-11@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
