I'm<br>convinced that semiformal ear training is even more important to xenharmonic<br>composition and performance than in traditional, and unfortunately isn't pursued<br>in depth except by a comparative few.   <br><br>   But editorialism aside, ear training exercises often require you to sing a<br>note at a particular pitch.  If the intended pitch does not fit within your<br>vocal range, you will usually sing an octave equivalent of that pitch.  If you<br>do this in a nonoctave tuning you would be singing an entirely different note<br>that does not even necessarily lie within the tuning system!  As with the case<br>of tuning instruments to each other, this is one of those cases where we take<br>the existence of octaves for granted.  <br><br>   But it's important to realize that this is not necessarily a problem.  Even<br>in the usual octave-based environment, you can't legitimately change octaves<br>frequently and still claim to be singing what you're supposed to be singing. So,<br>if you perform an entire exercise at the same octave offset from the desired<br>pitches, you're probably going to learn just as much as if you could sing them<br>at the exactly correct pitch.  <br><br>   Also, in a case where you are practicing interval singing, such as if you are<br>asked to sing an "answer" pitch that is thus-and-so interval above a root note.<br>Rather than only singing the answer pitch, you can sing the root pitch as well<br>just to establish the octave offset, and sing the answer pitch at the same<br>offset.  <br><br>   The key point here is that, in short, it's just an exercise.  Still, without<br>a doubt, it is very desirable wherever possible to try to avoid substituting<br>octave equivalents in exercises, since it's clearly unacceptable in an actual<br>nonoctave performance or composition.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 27 Sep 1995 12:22 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id DAA29243; Wed, 27 Sep 1995 03:22:47 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 27 Sep 1995 03:22:47 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199509271016.LAA02408@musik.auc.dk><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2065 href="#2065">ðŸ”—</a>        John Sankey &#x3C;bf250@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/1995 6:45:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I referred explicitly to Werckmeister III and<br>d'Alembert/Rousseau, not to non-ET in general, in my comment<br>about the divide between theoretical and practical writers on<br>temperament. I reject Kirnberger too - I have yet to find a<br>significant body of baroque music for which any of his tunings<br>work better than the ones I mention. In fact, his tunings<br>usually get phrasing stress backwards to my ears. And,<br>1/4-comma mean tone was almost certainly softened by most<br>harpsichordists (virginalists? but NOT organists) from the<br>earliest times. And, I thought we were talking about J.S.Bach,<br>not three generations later (e.g. Czerny) - I have no<br>experience at all that late.<br><br>My impression (my notes do not record statistics such as this, I<br>was just a kid in a candy shop then!) came from the music<br>section of the library at Cambridge England when I studied<br>there for 2 years in the 60's. It is all too true that the<br>vast majority of writing on temperament is by dilatants and<br>theoreticians, not by accomplished musicians.<br><br>I believe Scarlatti tuned his harpsichords in the standard<br>French temperament of the time, and will post a summary of the<br>paper Bill Sethares & I have written on this once it has been<br>accepted for publication. Bill is the mathematician (and a<br>good one) - I use my ears.<br><br>If you can't hear the difference between ET and WIII for Bach,<br>relax and use ET.
