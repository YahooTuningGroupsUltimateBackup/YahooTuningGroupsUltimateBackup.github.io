I added the words, but I wasn't really<br>trying to write an automatic ranter.... But, it shouldn't be hard,<br>alas.<br><br>Re CET, TET, MET, etc: Bruce Gilson and a few other theorists <br>use millioctaves specifically to avoid the built-in pro-12 bias of <br>cents. Yasser used centitones (600 to the octave); some French<br>theorists Savarts (300/octave). The late composer Paul Beaver favored<br>"harmos," the cycle of 1728 (12 cubed in base-12) to the octave.<br><br>For special purposes, I think many these log measures might have their uses.<br>I've invented a few, not entirely seriously, though, and put them in<br>XH 15.<br><br>BTW, I recently received a copy of "The Micro-Tome," the newsletter of<br>the Boston Microtonal Society. This issue (November 1996) carries an<br>interview with Ezra Sims and an article about Ives's Universe Symphony.<br>For more information, write Boston Microtonal Society, 27 Valentine<br>Street, Boston, MA 02139.<br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 6 Feb 1997 21:21 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA28215; Thu, 6 Feb 1997 21:21:26 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA28220<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id MAA22880; Thu, 6 Feb 1997 12:19:43 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 6 Feb 1997 12:19:43 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.95.970206151457.70617H-100000@freenet2.afn.org><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4749 href="#4749">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MorriSonics@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/1997 9:22:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> the harmonic series, with it's infinite <br>> series of relationships, is a part of the Creation.
