If not, I <br>probably didn't mention it on the list anyway.<br><br>In any case. these are a couple of 19/Oct Sine-Modulated Equal-Temperament <br>(SM-19ET) scales that I worked out using a spreadsheet (MS Excel). The idea <br>was to try out many different combinations of sine frequency and amplitude <br>on the interval numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.), and use statistical analysis <br>techniques to evaluate how well the results match up with the theoretically <br>pure mathematical intervals (e.g. 3:2 for a fifth).<br><br>Standard 19/Oct ET is shown for comparison. The first SM-19ET scale is <br>arrived at by modulating the interval number with Freq=8 and Amp=0.122889; <br>the second uses Freq=12 and Amp=-0.195294179.<br><br>Could someone with the equipment (and the time!) try these out and let me <br>know how they sound? So far, they exist purely as numbers, and I'm dying to <br>know how they translate to Reality(TM). If they're worth anything, please <br>accept them as public domain and use them freely, with my best wishes <br>(although an album sleeve credit would be nice...)<br><br>Interval		Std 19/Oct	SineMod #1	SineMod #2<br>1		63.158		71.369		51.862<br>2		63.158		58.978		83.528<br>3		63.158		52.895		58.088<br>4		63.158		62.299		46.861<br>5		63.158		72.999		81.321<br>6		63.158		68.849		64.863<br>7		63.158		56.111		43.625<br>8		63.158		54.007		77.145<br>9		63.158		65.712		71.454<br>10		63.158		73.563		42.506<br>11		63.158		65.712		71.454<br>12		63.158		54.007		77.145<br>13		63.158		56.111		43.625<br>14		63.158		68.849		64.863<br>15		63.158		72.999		81.321<br>16		63.158		62.299		46.861<br>17		63.158		52.895		58.088<br>18		63.158		58.978		83.528<br>19		63.158		71.369		51.862<br>			<br>Total / Oct	1200		1200		1200<br><br>Merry Whatever...<br><br>Brian Thomson<br>London, UK<br>briant@computing.emap.co.uk<br><br>PS: I have a couple of spreadsheets that might be of use to "normal" <br>keyboard or stringed instrument players. You type a key (e.g C#) into one <br>cell, a chord or scale type (e.g. MIN7) into another, and the spreadsheet <br>calculates and displays the scale / chord on a keyboard or tunable & <br>customisable "fretboard", depending on the version. A few guys on the <br>Chapman Stick list have tried one version out, and the feedback has been <br>quite positive. I use them myself for 5-string bass and keyboards. I can <br>mail it to anybody in Excel or MS Works formats, possibly 1-2-3 v4+ as <br>well.<br><br>PPS: You can tell I enjoy playing with spreadsheets, can't you?
