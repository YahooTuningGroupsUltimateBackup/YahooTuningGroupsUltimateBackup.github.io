I<br>> don't know why they usually are only double-tiered on the left. I am<br>> also wondering if a fine-tuning mechanism could be devised, better<br>> than just wiggling the tongues back and forth while hoping for the<br>> best. <br><br>I use a little hammer to tick the tongues back and forth gently, it<br>works ok. I never finished the one I started to build, so I can't give<br>any building advice, but I have a "real" one from Zimbabwe.<br>I thought about replacing the bottlecaps with seashells, but couldn't<br>drill a hole in a shell so I gave that up.<br>The keys on the right hand side on my mbira are pretty close together,<br>and not flattened to such a great width that having two tiers is <br>necessary. I think that would make playing more difficult.<br>You will need a big gourd for it too of course, as a soundboard.<br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 10 Jan 1997 19:23 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA19494; Fri, 10 Jan 1997 19:26:23 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA19510<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id KAA14943; Fri, 10 Jan 1997 10:25:31 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 10 Jan 1997 10:25:31 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701101824.KAA14890@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
