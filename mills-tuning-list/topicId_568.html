I meant to send this to the list, not just to Paul.  <br><br>   Actually, listening again to the opening chord, I hear something a little<br>different.  The opening minor-third chord is about 3 seconds long before the<br>first melody note enters.  There is some sort of square, on/off change (no<br>intermediary values) that occurs about once a second during that time.  During<br>that first second-long period, I hear something that sounds to me like a classic<br>beat, but it vanishes after that first second-long period.  <br><br>   But anyway, check out Bill Sethares' analysis below.<br><br>   By the way, it sounds different depending upon where and at what angle I<br>place my head within the room.  That beat during the first second-long period<br>seems almost inaudible when I have my head between the two speakers, but is<br>clearly audible when I have my head turned 90 degrees so that both speakers are<br>toward my left ear.  <br><br>   For you folks doing sample looping, that's something I've found to be very<br>valuable:  Don't declare a loop to be clean without moving and tilting your head<br>relative to the monitor speakers.  Some flaws in some rooms can easily be<br>rendered inaudible when your head is at one angle or another.  <br><br><br>--------------- Forwarded Message ---------------<br><br>From: 	Gary Morrison, 71670,2576<br>To: 	PAULE, INTERNET:ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com<br>Date: 	10 Jul 1996 , 7:16 PM<br><br>RE: 	Darreg Disc Error: track 3 mislabelled<br><br>> Not only does that minor third sound wide from just, but it also beats just <br>> under 3 times per second. Gary, maybe you should listen to it on a different <br>> stereo system, this beating is not hard to hear. <br><br>   I definitely heard something changing at the low-mid frequency range, at<br>about the rate you mentioned, but it didn't sound like a beat to me.  I say<br>"didn't" because of some results Bill Sethares came up with.  <br><br>   He did a mathematical analysis of a certain passage, and the frequencies<br>present drew two conclusions I found surprising:<br>1.  Two pitch changes in a chromatic run were 48 cents and 52 cents.  It seems<br>    likely therefore that it's not in 17, 19, nor 22, but in quartertones.  <br>2.  The timbre, despite its brightness, consisted of only of two partials an <br>    octave apart.  I don't recall what he said were the relative weights.  <br><br>   As for the beat, I suppose that that change we both hear could be a beat<br>after all.  The tone was bright enough that I expected it would have major wads<br>and wads of high-harmonic content, in which case the beats would sound like<br>typical phaser/flanger effect from a Tomita album.  It would be a horrendous<br>comb-filter sweep - FAR less subtle than that fluctuation you pointed out.  <br><br>   But knowing that the tone is really just a couple of partials (and apparently<br>low ones), then yes, that probably is exactly what such a waveform's beat would<br>sound like.  <br><br><br><br>Received: from sun4nl.NL.net [193.78.240.12] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 11 Jul 1996 08:58 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by sun4nl.NL.net with SMTP<br>	id AA27748 (5.65b/CWI-3.3); Thu, 11 Jul 1996 08:57:20 +0200<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id XAA17236; Wed, 10 Jul 1996 23:55:03 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 10 Jul 1996 23:55:03 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01510101ae09ef8a38f5@[205.218.46.34]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
