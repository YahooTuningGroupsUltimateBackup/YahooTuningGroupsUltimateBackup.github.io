First, that there was a distinction (as there is in most music) <br>between theory and practice.  HP built the instruments to get <br>just-intervals, and then composed idiomatic patterns within the <br>Monophonic scale which often fit the hand better than the book.  Notably <br>is "The Letter" whose two chords (utonal/otonal flux) are related very <br>remotely (by 81/49, if memory serves me correctly).  Nonetheless, this is <br>a progression of great ingenuity.<br><br>Secondly, that it is not always pretty nor elegant.  Idealt with that <br>quite recently, and have since gained a new appreciation for his work.<br><br>Adam<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 9 Jun 1996 02:42 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id RAA23711; Sat, 8 Jun 1996 17:42:48 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 8 Jun 1996 17:42:48 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960609003840_71670.2576_HHB38-5@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
