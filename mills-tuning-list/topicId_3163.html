I had been informed that<br>this otherwise fine instrument was easy to program.  Are there any out<br>there who have used this instrument and might be able offer some<br>suggestions and advice?<br><br>As far as I can tell here is how the instrument operates:<br><br>Each pitch of the scale can be altered from Equal Temperament by increments<br>of 1/64, + or -.<br><br>There are two factory presets apart from EQ and two Arabian Scales.  They<br>give Meantone and Werkmeister.<br><br>Here's the set up for the Meantone:<br><br>Pitch   Alteration from EQ<br>C       0<br>C#      -15<br>D       -4<br>D#      +7<br>E       -9<br>F       +2<br>F#      -13<br>G       -2<br>G#      -17<br>A       -7<br>A#      4<br>B       -11<br><br>Any comments?<br><br>I intended to demonstrate the following further temperaments:<br>(# is the Chapter from Jorgensen's book 'Tuning')<br><br>41      J.J.

The only way I can get the notes to be remotely<br>>similar to what's on the keyboard is breaking the scale up into 8<br>>different pitch tables, then copying the instrument eight times, each<br>>with a different pitch table chosen.<br>>Does anyone know of any easier way to realize this?<br><br>   Uhmmm...  Why 8 pitch tables?  (Well, maybe that's not important.)<br><br>   You may be able to use the patch select buttons:  Set up four layers of<br>the same sound (using copy layer command, being sure to copy on parameters<br>and not data also), but give each a different pitch table, and then in the<br>Edit:Instrument page, edit the "00", "*0", "0*", and "**" layers.<br><br>   That will work if you don't have to hit pitches from two different pitch<br>tables at the same time.  If you do, then do you need all 128 notes?  If<br>not, you can do keyboard splits, and use the octave-range of the notes to<br>select different subset tunings.</div><h3><a id=7197 href="#7197">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>3/6/1998 5:23:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>the same sound (using copy layer command, being sure to copy on parameters<br>                                                              ^<br>                                                              |<br>   Oops, that should have read:                    "only"-----+</div><h3><a id=7206 href="#7206">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>3/7/1998 8:26:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Oh, by the way, you may also want to use by far the most common approach<br>to mapping microtones to electronic keyboards, which is simply to map each<br>of the 25 pitches, in succession to successive pitches on the keyboard,<br>mismatching octave boundaries on the 7+5 layout of the keyboard with octave<br>boundaries in the tuning.<br><br>   I personally find it utterly incomprehensible that anybody could play<br>such a construction!  But the apparent truth of the matter is that far more<br>microtonal keyboardists seem to do it that way than trying to split the<br>tuning up into switchable subset scales.  People who have done that include<br>Harry Partch (on his Chromelodeon), Ivor Darreg on his "Detwelvulate!" CD<br>(and elsewhere), Jonathan Glasier, Easley Blackwood, Bill Sethares<br>(although he frequently plays from guitar controllers), and Brian McLaren.<br><br>   I suppose it's worth noting, however, that Easley Blackwood and Harry<br>Partch translated the music performed that way in equivalent 12TET notation<br>before performing that music.  (By "translated to equivalent 12TET<br>notation", I mean rewriting the music to show the 12TET notes that<br>correspond to the same keys, but not the same pitches, as what will produce<br>the desired microtonal notes.)<br><br>   One notable figure who - apparently - uses groups of subset modes<br>instead is Wendy Carlos.</div>
