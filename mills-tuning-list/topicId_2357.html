We all know<br>>that."<br>>It looks like this is new to everyone, though, so here's an<br>>explanation that requires the minimum of background knowledge.<br><br>Actually, I have been using the principle you are describing in<br>FasTrak utilities for about three years, I believe.  It is quite<br>handy as you can do multiplies by adding and subtracting<br>exponents.  Also, it make the computation of LCMs and GCDs much<br>simpler.<br><br>I haven't tried to apply the principle to non-ji scales though.<br><br>Marion<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  salinas@lgu.ac.uk<br>Subject:  J Carrillo<br>PostedDate:  28-08-97 15:47:59<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  28-08-97 15:48:12-28-08-97 15:48:13,28-08-97 15:45:45-28-08-97 15:45:46<br>DeliveredDate:  28-08-97 15:45:46<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256501.004BCF05; Thu, 28 Aug 1997 15:48:01 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03936; Thu, 28 Aug 1997 15:47:59 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 28 Aug 1997 15:47:59 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03934<br>Received: (qmail 4857 invoked from network); 28 Aug 1997 13:47:54 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 28 Aug 1997 13:47:54 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.96.970828144139.26654D-100000@kali><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6029 href="#6029">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/1997 11:04:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Thu, 28 Aug 1997, TONY SALINAS wrote:<br>> I'm trying to get hold of a 'microfish' collection that<br>> it must be based at Indiana University.<br>><br>> They have Julian Carrillo's scores<br><br>Are you sure about this?
