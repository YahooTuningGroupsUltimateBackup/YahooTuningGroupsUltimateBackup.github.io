It was<br>particularly loud in the middle bass region, and only audible at the attack<br>phase of the note.  This short duration usually makes extraneous noises hard<br>to find. <br>      When I detuned a unison in that area, I did so that it would beat about<br>three times a second, and immediately heard the buzz in the soundboard, (later<br>found to be small washer), vibrate in sympathy and  emit its buzzes at the<br>same speed.  I take this to demonstrate variable amplitude in the physical<br>sense. <br>   The same thing happens in an airplane when the two engines of a twin get<br>out of synch.  I have seen drinks and ashtrays throb with the difference<br>pulse.  As a tuner it makes me want to go up front and start telling people in<br>uniform to do something about it............<br>Regards, <br>Ed Foote <br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn.</div><h3><a id=8566 href="#8566">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/1998 9:37:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> Nevertheless, I remain skeptical about adding sine waves of matching<br>> frequency to eliminate beats.

I must be misunderstanding something.  If you analyze the signal<br>using a process which decomposes it linearly, such as a Fourier<br>transform, no energy is detected at the beat frequency.  What is a<br>decrease from nothing?  I think this is what Gary Morrison was talking<br>about when he said (talking about bram's beat-canceling idea):<br><br>>    It certainly doesn't make sens viewed in the frequency domain.<br><br>--pH <manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu> http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote<br>    O<br>   /\        "Churchill?
