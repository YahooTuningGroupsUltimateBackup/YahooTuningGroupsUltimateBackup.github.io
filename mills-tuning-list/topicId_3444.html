I was<br>merely using that tabulation as an illustration of the<br>similarities between Ken Wauchope's observations about<br>perceptual limitations [Tuning Digest #1398], and mine<br>about musical usage and implications, of prime-limits<br>in music.<br><br>I specifically intended *not* to find which ratios were<br>best implied by the 12-eq notes, but rather exactly the<br>opposite, namely, how primes above our usual limit (that<br>is, above 5 or even 7) could be mapped to 12-eq notes.<br><br>I agree with Erlich that certain 12-eq chords in certain<br>contexts can imply ratios which fall under lower prime<br>limits and which exhibit both smaller-integer and lower-<br>prime internal relationships than the higher-prime ratios<br>I indicated.  I have always said that many different<br>rational interpretations of 12-eq notes are possible,<br>and Erlich provides good reasons for his choices.<br>>> I think 19 is much more admissible as a rational> implication of the<br>sharp 9th than 11 or 13 are> admissible as rational implications of<br>anything> in 12tET (despite what Schoenberg may have had> to<br>say).>Perhaps, as Erlich suggests,  11 and 13 are far enoughaway from<br>their closest 12-eq representations that itis not valid to assume that<br>they can be implied by *any*12-eq notes, and so they deserve to be<br>considered entirelyunique chord identites that can only be represented<br>innon-12-eq tunings.<br>> Let's analyze a few common jazz chords (which are<br>> normally played, of course, in 12tET):<br><br>Erlich correctly points out, with his first two examples,<br>that in the higher tones of complex chords there are<br>implications of other, simpler chords.  Let's take a closer<br>look:<br><br>> [Example] 1. 13flat9 (meaning: root, maj .3rd, min. 7th,<br>> min. 9th, maj. 13th; the perfect 5th is often omitted in jazz)<br>><br>> I think this chord derives its flavor from the major triad<br>> formed on the maj.13th with the min. 9th and maj. 3rd.<br>> This triad resonates clearly and forms a polyharmonic<br>> structure against the root. Tuning the triad 27:34:40<br>> would destroy this effect and render the chord pretty ugly<br>> (IMO). Hence in this case the maj. 13th should be 5/3<br>> and the min. 9th should be 25/12.<br><br>Here is my matrix graph illustrating all the notes described<br>by myself and Erlich.  Powers of 3 go left-to-right, powers<br>of 5 go front-to-back, and higher primes transpose this 3x5<br>matrix to different levels from top-to-bottom.  For each of<br>the notes used, I give the 12-eq description (qualified by<br>our names if necessary), the JustMusic prime-factor notation,<br>the ratio, and the Semitones (= cents/100).  3^1 and 3^2 are<br>only  placeholders.

If we fix the maj. 3rd at 5/4, then the<br>> aug. 11th should be 10/7, the min. 7th should be 25/14,<br>> and the min. 9th should be 15/7. Of course, the fact that<br>> the min. 7th is also close to 7/4 helps to reinforce the<br>> root along with the maj. 3rd. It is very common in jazz<br>> to have a maj. 3rd - min. 7th tritone imply two different<br>> roots, one with their traditional roles and one with their<br>> roles reversed. This requires a tuning, such as 12tET,<br>> where the 50:49 "septimal sixth-tone" vanishes.<br><br>In my matrix graph:<br><br>            Monzo -9<br>             17^1<br>            17/16<br>             1.05<br>               |<br>               |<br>            Monzo +11<br>              11^1<br>              11/8<br>              5.51<br>               |<br>               |<br>             Monzo m7<br>               7^1<br>               7/4<br>              9.69<br>               |<br>     maj. 3rd  |<br>       5^1     |<br>       5/4     |<br>       3.86    |<br>          \    |<br>           \   |<br>             root<br>              n^0<br>              1/1<br>             0.00<br> Erlich m7     |<br>5^2 * 7^-1     |<br>   25/14       |<br>   10.04       |<br>      \        |<br>       \       |             Erlich -9<br>    Erlich +11 |   __ --  3^1 * 5^1 * 7^-1<br>    5^1 * 7^-1 |--            15/14<br>       10/7    |               1.19<br>       6.17    |<br>          \    |<br>           \   |<br>            \  |<br>           (7^-1)<br><br> Analysis:<br>*********<br><br>12-eq	ratio	 s-t.	prop.

The 13th and<br>possibly even the 9th could also be interpreted as 5-limit.)<br><br>No argument from me here.  In fact, jazz harmony as it developed<br>thru be-bop and beyond could not have happened without accepting<br>*a priori* the 12-eq scale.  Charlie Parker specifically stated<br>that he realized how to perform what he had been hearing in his<br>head when he found that he could improvise melodies that were made<br>up of the higher partials of the tune's chord changes.  (That the<br>just harmonies could still be implied to some degree in the complex<br>and fast-changing 12-eq harmonic motion should probably be ascribed <br>to the fact that this music was generally played very fast.  That<br>the need for precison of intonation is in inverse proportion to the <br>tempo is a point that has been noted often before.)<br><br>This double implication (poly-tonality vs. higher partials)<br>was exactly the kind of ambiguity cited by Schoenberg: see<br>"Theory of Harmony", p 418, regarding an 11-note chord from<br>measures 382-383 of his "Erwartung".  He shows how part of this<br>complex chord can be explained as two different dominant-7th,<br>flat-9th chords a tritone apart, with the four upper tones<br>forming a diminished-7th quadrad which the two chords have<br>in common in 12-eq.  Analyzing them by assuming that the<br>12-eq 7ths represent the 7/4 of the chords gives exactly the<br>result observed by Erlich regarding the 50/49 "6th-tone".<br><br>The 12-eq scale's ability to represent all these different<br>implications *simultaneously* is exactly what Schoenberg desired to <br>exploit, and it presents the best case for his retention  of 12-eq, <br>as well as for its general acceptance throughout most of this<br>century.  Of course, the debates in this forum are precisely<br>about which ratios can be represented, and how well.<br><br>Joseph L.
