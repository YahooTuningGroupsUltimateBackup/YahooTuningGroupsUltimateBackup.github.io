The 5th<br>> harmonic is way sharp and it misses some really neat harmonics - 7, 11, and<br>13<br>> for example.  It does, however, provide a fairly EFFICIENT mapping to the<br>> harmonics it does match - matching the first 5 harmonics reasonably well on<br>as a<br>> coarse resolution as 100 cents, is in my view an impressive feat.<br><br>Thanks for replying.  I'm afraid I'm waaaaay back at Tuning 101.<br><br>Would you (or anybody on the list) mind elaborating scale construction base on<br>partial frequency formulas?  i.e., Given the really neat partial freq ratios<br>that mclaren described, how do I construct a scale from them?<br><br>I realize that we can do NonJust Equal Temperament, Just Non Equal Temperament<br>(what others are there?).  There also seems to be the option of octave<br>transposition.  For the harmonic series, and the cylindrical vibration mode<br>series, transposing partials somehow into an octave seems really important,<br>because the series increases too rapidly to construct a scale merely composed<br>of partials.<br><br>For 12TET, did someone merely lay out the harmonic series to some order, octave<br>transpose them, and then make a best fit to a 2^(n/12) scale (discarding<br>partials 7,11,13 in this case)?<br><br>Thanks a bujillion,<br><br>Marcus<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 17 Nov 1995 06:14 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id UAA02094; Thu, 16 Nov 1995 20:14:15 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 16 Nov 1995 20:14:15 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9511162357.A11601-0100000@email.ir.miami.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2330 href="#2330">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/1995 4:48:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> Thanks for the explanation of LCMs, but why is this important musically?<br><br>   I thought I mentioned that in the message before my last one on that topic,<br>but perhaps not.  <br><br>   Marion McCoskey views the LCM of the numbers in the extended ratio for a<br>chord as a good indicator of the harmonic complexity of the chord.  So the LCM<br>of 60 for either 4:5:6 major or 10:12:15 minor chords is a fairly low LCM,<br>implying that it's a fairly simple chord, harmonically speaking.  <br><br>   If you turn that into a septimal dominant seventh chord (4:5:6:7), the LCM<br>goes up by a factor of seven to 420, suggesting that it's a much more<br>harmonically complex - tense - chord.  If you tune the upper interval of that to<br>the usual 6:5 minor third instead, the LCM goes way up again 20:25:30:36 to 900,<br>again, correctly predicting that that chord has a yet more complex sonority.  <br><br>   Some people on the list have questioned whether LCM is the best choice of<br>harmonic complexity, which is after all, a somewhat subjective thing.  But I get<br>the impression that most listers accept it as a reasonable model.  <br><br>   Speaking for myself, it strikes me as reasonable, but I suspect that it might<br>be the numbers might be a little more appropriate if they were the log of the<br>LCM.  Using the common log for example, the 4:5:6 would have a complexity of<br>1.8, the 4:5:6:7 a complexity of 2.62, and the 20:25:30:36 dominant seventh<br>chord a harmonic complexity of 2.95.  That strikes me as a little more in<br>proportion to the complexity as I hear them.  Or perhaps even better would be<br>the square root: 7.75, 20.5, and 30 respectively.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 18 Nov 1995 03:23 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id RAA11674; Fri, 17 Nov 1995 17:23:26 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 17 Nov 1995 17:23:26 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199511180122.JAA18942@csnt1.cs.ust.hk><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
