What A spoke of are "parts" of tones and he defined the<br>tone as the difference between the consonances of the 4th and 5th.<br>A later writer, Cleonides, came up with the 30 parts to the 4th<br>system  we attribute to A -- an enharmonic of 3 + 3 + 24 parts, <br>a soft  chromatic of 4 + 4 + 22 parts, a hemiolic chromatic of 4.5 <br>+ 4.5 + 21 parts, an intense chromatic of 6 + 6 + 18 parts, a soft <br>diatonic of 6 + 9 + 15, and a diatonic of 6 + 12 + 12. A also<br>mentioned some other genera somewhat resembling Archytas's tunings,<br>but he felt that the ones above were best known and fit his<br>theoretical framework in which the first interval could never<br>be greater than 6 parts and the second interval larger than the third. <br><br>The main reason I think he did not really mean ET is that none of <br>the other Greek theorists interpreted his tunings that way. <br>Eratosthenes and Ptolemy understood A's parts as being parts of a <br>physical string of 120 units. The principal or Dorian mode of each<br>genus was divided into two tetrachords of 120 ....90 and 80....60 parts. <br>The string lengths of the upper tetrachords (most of E's own and <br>Ptolemy's interpretation of A's) had to be divided by 3/2 as there are <br>only 20 parts between 80 and 60.  I think this is pretty good evidence <br>that equally<br>tempered intervals were not being considered. <br><br>Finally, computing string lengths for ET's was well within the <br>capabilities of the Greek mathematicians. Archytas himself was known <br>for a 3-D construction (using more than a compass and straight edge) <br>for the cube root of 2 and the extraction of square roots was long known. <br>Hence computing string lengths to reasonable preceision for the 0 mod <br>12 ET's would have been easy, had the Greeks ever wanted to.<br><br>I think Aristoxenos was trying to rigorously describe the perceived<br>sizes of the intervals of the various genera without recourse to<br>ratios, string lengths or other extra-musical factors. In this<br>respect, he is our earlist psychoacoustician.<br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 7 Nov 1996 09:21 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02668; Thu, 7 Nov 1996 09:22:19 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02667<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id AAA21530; Thu, 7 Nov 1996 00:22:15 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 7 Nov 1996 00:22:15 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199611070320_MC1-B8B-8AD3@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
