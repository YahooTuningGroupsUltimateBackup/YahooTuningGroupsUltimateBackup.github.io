You can now enroll in a free service to have your<br>>publication (book or CD) listed and for sale online. They take a cut of the<br>>sales proceeds for the service.<br>><br>>http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/partners/direct/direct-application.html<br><br>I looked into this. One fact is that in order for Amazon to carry the<br>CD, it must have a UPC code (so they can track their inventory).<br>When I followed the UPC links, it looks like its easy to get a number,<br>but it costs about $350 to become a "manufacturer" (six digits) and<br>then you have access to five digits (10,000 different) individual product<br>numbers. <br><br>Since I am not currently planning to release 10,000 different CDs<br>(in the near term) it made me wonder if maybe there would be a way<br>to "go in on" a number with a few people, or to find someone who already<br>has a UPC number and would be willing to share/sell/rent a number or two.<br><br>Has anyone done this before?<br><br><br><br>Bill Sethares</div>
