If you <br>want to compose a piano sonata in,<br>say, 41 tone equal temperament, <br>this limits you to a 3 octave<br>range. Most composers would not<br>accept such a limitation.<br>As for using multitrack with SMPTE<br>sync to create a microtonal compostion<br>via multiple passes in the recording<br>studio, this is so harrowing and so<br>arduous and so difficult that no<br>microtonal composer has ever done<br>it. Thus it is so complex and so<br>tortuous that it is effectively<br>impossible.<br>Few MIDI synthesizers have multiple<br>pitch tables.  Only the EPS samplers,<br>the VFX and TS-10 synthesizers, and<br>the TX802 have more than one pitch table.<br>Of these, only the TS-10 and ASR-10<br>samplers are currently manufactured.<br>This leaves most microtonal composers<br>with no options.<br>--<br>In the real world, things are very<br>different from the realm of pure theory.<br>Let's take a hard cold example--let's<br>say you want to compose a piano sonata<br>in 41 tone equal temperament.<br>The best piano sample bank around is<br>the Akai Steinway D bank on Volume 1<br>of Akai's "Complete Piano" series. <br>Clearly, this is the piano sample<br>to use.<br>This bank takes up 32 megs of sample<br>RAM.<br>As we've seen, the maximum limit for<br>1 MIDI channel is 17 pitches per<br>octave.  To get 41 pitches per octave,<br>we need 3 different retuned sample<br>banks on 3 different MIDI channels,<br>requiring a minimum of 96 megabytes<br>of sample RAM.<br>No current sampler allows this much<br>RAM except for the astronomically<br>expensive Kurzweill K3000 sampler.<br>This sampler lets you add up to<br>128 megs of RAM and the sampler<br>itself costs about $4500.  With<br>128 megs of RAM, the cost rises above<br>$6000.  Since no microtonalist<br>has this kind of cash to spend merely<br>to produce a single composition, you're<br>pretty much out of luck.<br>The alternative is to use 8 Ensoniq<br>ASR-10 samplers, at an approximate<br>cost of $20,000.  Those of you who have<br>twenty thousand dollars to spend on<br>a single composition, raise your hands...<br>The other alternative is to use one<br>ASR-10 sampler and break up the <br>Akai piano sample into 8 different<br>blocks, then realize the entire<br>composition in fragments by writing <br>software to break up your MIDI file <br>of the composition into 8 different<br>MIDI channels and re-assemble the<br>whole composition one fragment<br>at a time via digital multitrack <br>with SMPTE sync, changing piano samples<br>between each take.<br>No microtonalist has yet accomplished<br>such an incredibly convoluted and<br>difficult feat; in the real world,<br>therefore, such an option does not<br>realistically exist.<br>--<br>If you want to use a sampler without<br>a pitch table--say, the Akai S-2000--<br>you're *really* up the creek.<br>In this case you can only break out of<br>12-tet by using a sample map to map<br>each sample to a different pitch and<br>each pitch to a separate key.<br>This requires that you use 127 different<br>samples...one for each MIDI note.<br>Since the Akai Steinway D piano bank<br>uses 1 sample for each whole note<br>(44 whole notes total in the bank)<br>with a total of 32 megs, you would need<br>32 megs * 127/44 92.36 megabytes of<br>sample RAM to get 127 MIDI microtonal notes.<br>If we're in 19-tone equal temperament,<br>127 MIDI notes still isn't very much:<br>that's only 127/19 6.68 octaves, less<br>than the range of a conventional grand<br>piano.  Yet the Akai series of samplers<br>permit only 32 megs per sampler.  This<br>means that you would either have to <br>buy 3 Akai samplers, or multitrack<br>the composition sync'd to SMPTE--as we've<br>seen, an impractical option so difficult<br>and so arduous as to be effectively<br>impossible.<br>--<br>What are the other alternatives?<br>Well, theoretically we could feed<br>the Akai piano bank samples into<br>a program like Alchemy or Sound<br>Forge and sample-rate-convert them<br>to take up less room. Downsampling<br>from 44.1 khz to 22.05 khz would<br>double the number of notes per <br>megabyte of sample. However, this <br>would degrade the audio quality of <br>the piano sound, and it would<br>also take up an impractical amount<br>of computer time.<br>How much time?<br>As Leibniz suggested, "Gentlemen,<br>let us calculate."<br>Say 5 minutes per 800 kilobyte piano <br>sample to convert from 44.1 khz to <br>22.05 khz--and the Akai piano sample <br>has 44 different multisamples, so this<br>is 220 minutes or 3 hours 10<br>minutes.  Add on file naming,<br>saving to disk, etc., and we<br>get roughly 4 hours of work.<br>Of course, this is only for<br>one intonation--41-tet. If we<br>want sample-rate-converted<br>smaller-size piano samples<br>re-mapped for every equal<br>temperament from 5 through<br>53 tones per octave, that <br>will take 192 hours of work,<br>or 8 days working non-stop<br>8 hours per day.  If we<br>work 4 hours per day (a more<br>realistic estimate--say, <br>after you come home from your<br>job) it would take 16 days<br>to finish that task.<br>This still gives you only 1<br>timbre--piano timbre, in 5<br>through 53 tones per octave.<br>For 64 different timbres (a<br>reasonable though modest<br>sound-pallette) you would need<br>to spend 1024 days, or 2.8<br>years working 4 hours per day,<br>7 days per week, 52 weeks per<br>year.<br>At this point we've slammed<br>head-on into the practical<br>limitations of the real<br>world.<br>--<br>The difference between the<br>theoretical ideal of microtonality<br>and the practical reality is vast.<br>It's as large as the differene<br>between the theoretically finite<br>possibility that a pot of water<br>will freeze when you put it over<br>a fire, and the practical reality<br>that this NEVER happens. In the <br>real world, the pot always boils...<br>ALWAYS. Without exception.<br>And so when various forum subscribers<br>clamor that my facts are incorrect<br>or my conclusions are wrong, it's<br>well to remember that they are fantasizing<br>about some ideal theoretical pie-in-the-<br>sky realm, and NOT talking about the real<br>world.<br>--<br>We can use the 17-pitch-per-<br>MIDI-channel limit to do some<br>other calculations which tell<br>us some revealing things about<br>synthesizers and MIDI.<br>72 pitches per octave seems like<br>a reasonable maximum for a<br>microtonal composer. Some<br>members of this forum (myself,<br>John Fitch with 100/oct, William<br>Schottstaedt with 144/oct) have<br>composed pieces of music using<br>much larger numbers of tones<br>per octave, but such compositions<br>remain rare exceptions.  Most microtonal<br>music uses 72 tones/octave<br>or less.<br>If we accept 72 pitches per octave<br>as a practical maximum, how many<br>MIDI channels are needed to<br>realize such a composition, given<br>the 127 MIDI note limitation?<br>The answer is 72/17 4.23,<br>or, rounding up, 5 MIDI channels.<br>Thus 5 MIDI channels represents<br>the minimum number that should<br>be available on a sampler.<br>We can use this result to tell<br>what the minimum amount of sample<br>RAM should be on a sampler so<br>as to allow us to compose with<br>up to 72 pitches per octave:<br>Given that most sample banks<br>now average about 32 megs of<br>RAM, we would need at least<br>5*32 megs of sample RAM.<br>So 160 megabytes is the minimum<br>amount of sample RAM which would<br>be useful on a sampler if you<br>want to compose microtonal music<br>with it.<br>Alas, no sampler allows this much<br>RAM.<br>The Enqoniq ASR-10 is limited<br>to 16 megs maximum, ditto the<br>Digidesign Sample Cell. The<br>Kurzweill 2000 allows 64 megs<br>maximum, while the Kurzweill<br>3000 allows 128 megs maximum.<br>Now we run into another limitation<br>of the real world: pitch tables,<br>and the lack thereof.<br>The Ensoniq ASR-10 is the only<br>sampler on the market which<br>currently has pitch tables. All<br>other samples are locked via hardware<br>into 12 pitches per octave--in<br>some samplers you can vary those<br>12 pitches, but you're still<br>restricted to 12.<br>At this point various forum<br>subscribers will predictably<br>claim that they can force 12/oct<br>samplers to do microtonal things<br>using some exotic combination of<br>hardware and software.<br>This is false.<br>While in an ideal world it is<br>theoretically possible to use some <br>exotic software systemm to tweak<br>an Akai or Kawai or Kurzweill or<br>Roland synthesizer/sampler so<br>that it produces microtonal music,<br>in the real world the cold hard<br>fact is that these exotic kludges<br>*do not* produce acceptable results.<br>Either pitch-bend messages/<br>sys-ex messages clog the MIDI<br>channels and turn chords into<br>arpeggios, or pitch-bends turn<br>every note-on into a twang (an<br>ugly sound, especially with<br>percussive timbres), or you get<br>only a few notes out of N at a<br>time.<br>Thus, in the real world, these<br>schemes don't work.  In the<br>real world, I need all 41 pitches<br>of 41-tet available at once.<br>I want to do 5 octaves of<br>41-tone per octave note<br>clusters. I want to do complex<br>chromatic polyphony at high<br>speed.  I want to run from the<br>highest pitch to the lowest<br>in chromatic progression while<br>harmonizing with 13th chords.<br>None of these strange sys-ex<br>or pitch-bend schemes will<br>permit this.<br>Thus, in the real world such<br>onerous kludges simply do not work.<br>They enforce such drastic<br>limitations on the composer<br>as to be unacceptable. Either<br>the composer must edit every<br>note to insert a sys-ex message<br>by hand, or the MIDI channels<br>get so choked with sys-ex info<br>that the synthesizer starts<br>missing notes, or you're limited<br>to a maximum of 16 notes/MIDI<br>channels at a time, or some other<br>crippling problem arises.<br>--<br>This points up the *enormous*<br>gap between practical and<br>theoretical implementations<br>of microtonality.<br>While pitch-bend and sys-ex<br>schemes are theoretically<br>possible, in the real world<br>they just don't work out.  <br>The hard cold brutal reality<br>of microtonal composition is<br>that it's so difficult and<br>so complex and so demanding<br>for us (the first generation of<br>microtonal composers using<br>MIDI instruments) to write<br>music outside of the 12 Sacred<br>Tones that if a scheme requires<br>a composer to spend more than<br>a day or two tweaking a synthesizer<br>to get non-12, we simply won't use<br>it.<br>The reason for this is the hardware<br>we're battling, as well as our own<br>mental software.  We were all taught<br>to compose in 12, and that programming<br>is very strong. Thus it's doubly hard<br>for us, as the first generation of xenharmonists<br>with instant access to ALL possible tunings,<br>to fight *both* our 12-tet programming AND<br>the current neolithic generation of <br>microtonal synth hardware.<br>Right now synthesizers are mostly hardware.<br>In the future, this will change drastically.<br>Soon synths will be mostly software, and this<br>will make it much *much* easier to compose<br>in real time in scales like Partch 43 or <br>41-tet.  In the meantime, however, we must<br>do the best with the hardware we've got.<br>Remember...MIDI is only 13 years old.<br>--<br>Amid this blizzard of numbers, it's important<br>to keep sight of our priorities--as this tuning <br>forum often does NOT.<br>Numbers and ratios and algorithms are<br>NOT what microtonal music is all about.<br>Words and equations and psychoacoustics<br>papers are NOT the ultimate destination of<br>xenharmonics.<br>Microtonality is about MUSIC.<br>As composers, we cannot afford to<br>get sidetracked into a tarpit of<br>endless sys-ex tables and synth<br>set-ups and individual note-edits.<br>More than a few hours of this prior<br>to a composition or performance is<br>impractical. In the real world,<br>a couple of days of this kind<br>of hassle at most is about the<br>limit of what the average xenharmonic<br>composer can stand per tuning.<br>What we need is pretty much something<br>like what an ordinary 12-tone composer<br>has: you sit down at the piano and you<br>play.  If 12-tone composers had to<br>spend 3 weeks busting hump with sample<br>editors and sys-ex tables and the rest<br>of that rigamarole before they could<br>even start to compose, there wouldn't<br>be much 12-tone music.<br>This is just the hard cold reality.<br>People who dwell in ivory towers or<br>who spend their lives as programmers<br>(not composers) of course don't<br>understand this.  But for the rest of<br>us, it's a very real fact.  When the<br>amount of work required to get a <br>synthesizer to do something microtonal<br>rises above some arduous level--say,<br>a couple of days of effort--we as composers<br>will say "The hell with it!" and move on.<br>This is why so little microtonal music<br>has been written for the FB-01. That<br>synth required that a separate sys-ex<br>tuning message be sent with each<br>note-on, and it was simply far far *FAR*<br>too much work.  Composers just gave<br>up and turned to other synthesizers that<br>had tuning tables.  Life's too short<br>to spend it beating your head against<br>intractable digital hardware.<br>--<br>This means that synthesizers and samplers<br>with pitch tables are the minimum <br>requirement for microtonality.  While<br>it is in an ideal world theoretically<br>possible to get synths which are locked into<br>12 pitches per octave to do something<br>microtonal, in the real world it's so<br>difficult and so complex and introduces so<br>many crippling limitations that in practical<br>terms it's impossible.  For microtonality,<br>you MUST have a synthesizer with a pitch table.<br>--<br>It's a matter of some interest to use<br>the 17 pitch per octave limit to calculate<br>how many MIDI notes *would* have been<br>required to let us get 72 pitches per<br>octave.  It turns out that the number<br>of MIDI notes we really needed in the<br>MIDI spec was X 72*88/12 528.<br>The assumptions here are, as usual,<br>that we won't need a single instrument<br>with a wider range than a grand piano<br>(88 notes) and that we must restrict<br>ourselves to a single MIDI channel.<br>It's heartbreaking to realize that if<br>only the original MIDI spec had used<br>10 bits for pitch instead of 7, we would<br>today be able to easily get 72 pitches<br>per octave without any trouble. In fact<br>with 1023 MIDI notes we'd be able to <br>get 7 octaves of 139 pitches per octave...<br>plenty for almost any practical<br>microtonal composition.<br>Just think of it--if the original MIDI<br>protocol had used 16 bits per MIDI byte<br>instead of 8 bits, we would have had<br>15 bits available for pitch. That would<br>have given us 32767 pitches, far more<br>than enough for any conceivable xenharmonic<br>tuning.  Our problems would have been<br>solved.<br>Alas, Wold's Law applies: Erling Wold once<br>said that all standards in the personal computer<br>industry are created by taking the cheesiest <br>sleaziest lowest-cost kludge that will<br>do the job at some grotesquely sub-minimal<br>level and etching it in adamantine diorite.<br>Once again, with MIDI, Wold's Law has<br>proven correct...if only MIDI had been<br>delayed until 16 bit processors and<br>16 bit bytes became the standard in<br>the desktop computer industry...!<br>(Sigh.)<br>--<br>At this point Johnny Reinhard and his<br>New York friends will predictably claim<br>that the answer is to eliminate MIDI<br>synthesizers and compose for pure<br>acoustic ensembles.  Of course, Johnny<br>and friends overlook the vitally<br>important fact that MIDI synths have<br>become *indispensable* in composing microtonal<br>music. A MIDI synth allows a composer<br>to *hear* those new microtonal harmonies <br>and microtonal melodies before committing<br>them to paper. This is absolutely necessary<br>because history shows that every microtonal<br>theorist who ever made a judgement about<br>a scale *without* hearing it wound up<br>being completely mistaken. The cold deaf<br>mute silent numbers NEVER tell you what a <br>tuning will *sound* like. Thus, J. Murray<br>Barbour dismissed 19-tet as "too insipid"<br>because of its "overly pure" minor thirds...<br>but in fact 19-tet is today one of the most<br>popular equal temperaments, due to its distinctive<br>and memorable and very aggressive "sound" or<br>"mood."  Fox-Strangways disdained Partch's 43<br>note just intonation because of the purported<br>"problem" with different notes having the same<br>name--but as anyone who's heard Partch's music<br>knows quite well, this is simply a non-problem.<br>As a triad moves from I to IV to V to I, different<br>notes with the same name play musical chairs<br>inside the chords. It works perfectly, sounds completely <br>straightforward. Again: 15-tet was pooh-poohed by <br>countless music theorists because of its 720-cent<br>fifths, but 15-tet turns out to have a vivid<br>and lovely "sound" or "mood"--as Easley Blackwood,<br>Ivor Darreg, and many others have proven conclusively <br>by composing superb music in the tuning.<br>And so on.<br>Thus, microtonal synthesizers are here to<br>stay.  It is not practical to roll the clock<br>back and banish them from the composer's<br>studio or the concert hall.<br>This makes the 127-note MIDI limit a<br>particularly huge probem.  MIDI syths<br>are everywhere--in fact they are largely<br>responsible for the formation of this<br>tuning forum--and this means that the<br>17-pitch-per-octave limit is something like<br>the speed of light...it is built into<br>microtonal synths at the hardware level,<br>and we must *all* deal with it. (The<br>only exceptions are those lucky few with<br>access to the Samson Box. Even the KYMA<br>system is limited to 127 MIDI notes.)<br>--<br>Efforts to expand the number of MIDI notes<br>have proven disastrously misguided.  The<br>recent ZIPI proposals by the Berkeley CNMAT group<br>headed by David Wessel suggested sending<br>pitch as an unsigned multi-byte float instead<br>of as an unsigned 7-bit int. This was an<br>astoundingly BAD idea because the great<br>virtue of MIDI note numbers is that they<br>are just that--numbers, not connected to<br>any particular pitch.  This leaves the<br>individual synthesizer free to interpret<br>the numbers and that means that a microtonal<br>composer has maximum flexibility.  Using<br>simple integers as MIDI numbers means<br>that a composer can very simply and easily<br>set up elaborate pitch tables merely by<br>filling up the linear array of midi note<br>numbers in any way desired. For example, a<br>microtonal composer can fill one pitch<br>table of a MIDI synth with a 5/oct pitch<br>table, another pitch table with 7/oct,<br>and yet a third with a 35/oct pitch table.<br>This allows a composer great freedom in<br>moving between tunings--all you need <br>do is switch MIDI channels.<br>Interpreting MIDI notes as simple integers<br>(which are really pointers to an array)<br>without reference to pitch makes possible<br>such exotic compositional strategies as<br>composing in (say) 13-tone equal temperament<br>melodically with just intonation vertical<br>harmonies for each note.<br>All you need to do is fill one pitch table<br>with 13-tet and two other pitch tables with<br>the same pitches transposed a 5/4 higher and<br>a 3/2 higher.<br>To regress and devolve by interpreting notes as pitch<br>rather than numbers is a giant step BACKWARDS<br>which makes many kinds of microtonal composition<br>much more complex than they ought to be. <br>But the worst aspect of CNMAT's ZIPI proposal<br>is that it puts the burden of setting pitch on<br>the shoulders of the controller manufacturers.<br>And we all know EXACTLY what will happen five<br>minutes after ZIPI becomes the official pitch<br>protocol for synthesizers: the controller <br>manufacturers would take one look at the<br>pitch protocol, say "To hell with this!" and<br>lock their controllers into strict 12-tet to<br>save time and money in manufacturing their<br>keyboards.<br>The end result?  <br>ZIPI would sound the death knell for <br>microtonality on digital synthesizers.<br>--<br>And so the situation looks bleak for microtonality<br>on synthesizers.  Those who want to explore<br>large numbers of tones per octave (> 17 pitches<br>per octave) are up against some cruel practical<br>limitations.  And now that Ensoniq has fired<br>its entire R&D staff, the future of microtonal<br>innovation on synthesizers is very much in question.<br>Instead of having more pitch tables on synths<br>(as we desperately need), we are likely to have<br>*fewer* in the future. <br>John Fitch's Extended Csound spec looks like it's<br>arriving just in time.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 19 Dec 1996 07:11 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04789; Thu, 19 Dec 1996 07:13:20 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04465<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id WAA09396; Wed, 18 Dec 1996 22:13:17 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 18 Dec 1996 22:13:17 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95.961218220448.17303A-100000@equinox><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
