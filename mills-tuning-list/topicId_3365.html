I'm telling you, a lot of people could be<br>> put off by the math involved in microtonality.Good <br>> thing I'm the persistant type !<br><br>1)<br>I'm working on a webpage to introduce my theory<br>and it will have a good deal of microtonal math.<br>(a couple more months, I hope...)<br><br>2)<br>Thought you might find this usefu:<br><br>The formula to calculate cents from any ratio.<br>The format I use here can be pasted directly into<br>an Excel spreadsheet; just replace RATIO with<br>the cell reference to the ratio:<br><br>=MOD((LOG(RATIO))*(1200/LOG(2)),1200)<br><br>For example, to find the cents of the "perfect 5th",<br>mod((log(3/2)*(1200/log(2)),1200).  This returns<br>702 cents.<br><br>The use of logarithms is necessary in converting<br>from just-intonation to equal-temperament because<br>equal-temperament is based on a just ratio<br>(normally the "octave" 2/1) which is divided equally.<br>When measured rationally, the frequencies  keep<br>increasing geometrically, so roots or logarithms<br>must be used to compute the tempered intervals.<br><br>The ratio of a tempered interval can be calculated<br>easily as follows:<br><br>=DIVISOR^(DEGREE/DIVISIONS)<br><br>For example:<br><br>The just "perfect 5th" is 3/2, which equals 1.5.<br><br>The 12-eq "perfect 5th" is the 7th degree<br>of a scale which is measured by dividing the "octave"<br>(with the ratio 2/1) into 12 equal parts, so its formula<br>is (2/1)^(7/12).  This returns 1.498307...<br><br>The 22-eq "perfect 5th" is the 13th degree of a scale<br>which also divides the "octave", this time in 22 equal<br>parts, so its formula is (2/1)^(13/22).  This returns<br>1.506196...<br><br>The 13th degee in the  "13th root of 3/2" scale<br>provides an exact "perfect 5th" because (3/2)^( 13/13)<br>returns 3/2 itself, or 1.5.<br><br>   Joseph L.

Any other suggestions ?<br><br>Helmholtz and Partch's "Genesis of a Music" were my main [and only]<br>references until very recently.  <br><br>I'm sure that there's tons of material out there, and those more<br>familiar with it will provide a bibliography, but based on what I<br>have, I'd suggest spending for a stack of Xenharmonicons [my personal<br>collection runs from #6 to the present].<br><br>As for "must haves", I'd definately recommend Doty's "The Just<br>Intonation Primer", available from the Just Intonation Network.<br><br>Steve</div>
