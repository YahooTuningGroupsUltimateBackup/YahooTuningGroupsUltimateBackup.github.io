Too much homogeneity.<br><br>   I think that that's an appropriate observation.  Harmonic fusion can<br>make melody lines harder to hear, and slight detuning can make notes easier<br>to pick out from the crowd.<br><br>   That is another example of one of Ivor Darreg's favorite points, that<br>melody and harmony are often at odds with each other.  What sounds smooth<br>and even melodically (e.g., an equal temperament) often sounds rough<br>harmonically.  And the reverse:  What sounds smooth and even harmonically,<br>(e.g., two different sizes of whole-step) can often sound rough<br>melodically.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 2 Jun 1997 07:31 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06576; Mon, 2 Jun 1997 07:31:34 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 2 Jun 1997 07:31:34 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06573<br>Received: (qmail 11943 invoked from network); 2 Jun 1997 05:31:24 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 2 Jun 1997 05:31:24 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.91.970601221557.7459A-100000@si.UCSC.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
