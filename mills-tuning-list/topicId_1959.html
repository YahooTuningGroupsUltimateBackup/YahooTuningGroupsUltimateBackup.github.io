In his maturity,<br>Krishnamurti denied he was a deity, but did set up a headquarters<br>in Ojai, California, a town in a valley near Santa Barbara, California.<br>Ojai (pronounced Oh-HI) seems to be inhabited primarily by occultists<br>and chiropractors, including my sister.<br><br>Besant, I might add, was an amazing person. She was a founder of<br>the Indian Congress Party, an early feminist, a friend of George<br>Bernard Shaw, etc.<br><br>According to a Theosophical book catalogue, a woman named Annie von<br>Lange introduced Steiner to JI. Brian Lee and I have been researching<br>the connections between Steiner's Anthroposophy movement and Kathleen<br>Schlesinger's friend and collaborator Elsie Hamilton. While we have<br>located some of Hamilton's scores (in KS's diatonic harmoniai),<br>we have not been able to find the ones mentioned and excerpted<br>in "The Greek Aulos."<br><br>--John<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 17 Apr 1997 22:01 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02564; Thu, 17 Apr 1997 22:01:14 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02562<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id MAA27702; Thu, 17 Apr 1997 12:59:36 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 17 Apr 1997 12:59:36 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01510101af7bc0b85236@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
