Since the entire wave does not move up and down with this curve, this<br>>can't<br>>be due to a subharmonic.  (Also, it was run through a subsonic filter before<br>>being drawn here, and this particular pitch is in the lowest register of<br>>the bass clarinet, so it subharmonics are inherently unlikely.)<br><br>It looks an awful lot like the true fundamental is an octave below the<br>period you have identified. Read Benade or Backus, one of whom discusses<br>how the true fundamental can indeed be a subharmonic of a resonant<br>frequency, a phenomenon found not only in wind and brass instruments but<br>also the human voice (e.g., Tuvan throat singing, Janis Joplin). Your<br>subsonic may have lessened that true fundamental, but it is still there.<br><br>>11. The troughs circled in green MAY reflect the peaks and troughs of a high<br>>harmonic walking through that particular slightly-lower-harmonic-dictated<br>>trough.  I'm not sure of that by any means though.<br><br>We both forgot to mention noise. All wind instrument timbres contain<br>significant amounts of noise, coming from the breath of the performer<br>while the reed is open. This noise will of course spoil any exact<br>periodicity that might otherwise be there. By the way, the instrument<br>will tend to amplify this noise at its resonant frequencies. Try playing<br>a wind instrument without the reed and you will still get a rough idea<br>of the pitches you're fingering from the way your breath-noise is<br>amplified.</div>
