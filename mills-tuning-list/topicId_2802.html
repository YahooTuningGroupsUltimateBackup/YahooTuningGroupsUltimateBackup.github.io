Yes, this<br>>}is of course possible, but the resulting modes conflate a number of<br>>}aurally distinct modes into single, neutral modes,<br>><br>>Care to provide an example of a 12-tone mode which conflates two or more<br>>19-tone modes?<br>><br>>}and lack much of the<br>>}distinct melodic character of the 19-tone versions.<br>><br>>}For an example of what I mean, take the most common form of the minor<br>>}scale (on C for convenience):<br>><br>>}C D Eb F G Ab B C<br>><br>>}This can be played in 12-tone equal, but loses much of its piquancy<br>>}thereby. This is partly because the highly characteristic augmented tone<br>>}Ab-B is confounded with the minor third.<br>><br>>True, but somehow even in 12-equal it never sounds like a minor third, always<br>>like a dissonant interval, in the context ofthis scale (except when a late<br>>Romantic composer is using the Ab minor chord). My high school music teacher<br>>played the harmonic minor scale, then the augmented second interval, and<br>>everyone in the class called the interval dissonant -- even though the very<br>>same interval, functioning as a minor third in another scale, was deemed<br>>consonant. Why is this so? Because tonal consonance is not merely an<br>>acoustical phenomenon -- it is also a function of musical grammar. The<br>>Western tonal grammar constructs consonant chords and intervals from<br>>alternate notes of the scale. Seconds, even augmented seconds, cannot<br>>function as harmonic consonances within this grammar.<br>><br>>}Historically, the 'minor scale'<br>>}derived much of its attractiveness from the use of the mesotonic, which<br>>}preserves the augmented tone close to the just values (there are<br>>}several).<br>><br>>I would argue that, if so, the most significant of these values is 7:6; the<br>>others are well beyond the 11-limit (I'm talking odd limit here) and<br>>therefore just intonantion is irrelevant. 19-equal conflates 7:6 with 8:7,<br>>and so if the augmented tone is to be heard as a particular ratio, 19-equal<br>>is a poor tuning for it. In 31-equal, however, the augmented tone is a very<br>>clear 7:6.<br>><br>>}I have elsewhere referred to the fact that this is one of the<br>>}few respects in which 31-tone equal is melodically quite distinct from<br>>}12-tone equal. But 19-tone equal is still more distinct.<br>><br>>Distinct from 12, yes; better -- well, the flexibility of interpreting the<br>>augmented tone as a minor third in late Romanic music is an advantage of<br>>12-tone that 19-tone does not posess, and the clear ratio-interpretation<br>>mentioned above is an advantage of 31.<br>><br>>}Again, to give a better idea of exactly why one cannot adequately play<br>>}chromatic modes in 12-tone equal, let me offer up Yasser's old (but very<br>>}good) analogy between 12-tone equal and 7-tone equal. One can reproduce<br>>}the seven diatonic modes in 7-tone equal, but they are merged into a<br>>}single, neutral mode, for 7-tone equal has no semitones. This is very<br>>}much what occurs when a chromatic mode such as C D Eb F G Ab B C is<br>>}played in 12-tone equal - it is largely sterilized of its unique modal<br>>}flavor, because the two species of semitones are confounded.<br>><br>>All the semitones in this mode are the same size in 19-equal: 2 degrees. And<br>>what modes are merged?<br>><br>>}Paul E[]rlich asserts that 22-tone equal is the only path to escape<br>>}diatonicism.<br>><br>>I only said it _may_ be the only path, and I explained why in a later post.<br>><br>>}but 22-tone<br>>}equal is not a temperament at all, but a mere tuning artefact that<br>>}reproduces the worst defects of just intonation.<br>><br>>But these "defects" (the non-vanishing of the syntonic comma) can only be<br>>seen as such in the context of diatonicism! Since we are speaking of escaping<br>>diatonicism, the relevant properties of a tuning system will be quite<br>>different.<br>><br>>}Not that I wish to<br>>}question the validity of the just ratios as standards for musical<br>>}thought.<br>>}[...]<br>>}the enharmonic genus, where harmony is not an important element. This<br>>}involves the use of 1/3 tones, which are never written in our music, but<br>>}which fill the living rock melos of our people. No theorist should ever<br>>}presume to discount the importance of what the musically untutored<br>>}produce from their own melodic inspiration. They stand in need of our<br>>}guidance, but we also of theirs.<br>><br>>Can you tell us what this genus looks like? Most of my favorite rock<br>>1/3-tones arise from the difference between a 7:6 and a whole tone; harmony<br>>is indeed an important element wherever such intervals arise. I suspect that<br>>22-equal, for instance, might even "work" for your enharmonic genus when its<br>>septimal basis is admitted. It certainly comes closer to the ancient Greek,<br>>quarter-tonal enharmonic genus, which by the way is yet another<br>>counter-example to your minimal melodic limen spec.<br>><br>>}The 19-tone equal temperament _alone_ can give access to either of these<br>>}two genera [the "chromatic" -- really modes of 3 Western and 1 non-western<br>>altered diatonic scales --<br>>}and the "enharmonic" -- yet to be fully described by Gregg]<br>><br>>We shall see. I have already mentioned that your 28 "chromatic" modes are<br>>well-represented in 22-equal.<br>><br>>}just as it alone gives adequate access to the diatonic<br>>}genus.<br>><br>>While 22-equal does not give adequate access to the diatonic genus, 19-tone<br>>is far from the only tuning that does. The vast majority of music that we<br>>hear today serves as proof that 12-equal is more than "adequate." 31-equal we<br>>have already been discussing, but there's one more in-between: 26-equal. Its<br>>harmonies are about as good as those in 12-equal, and the unusual structure<br>>of the scale (tones 4 units wide, semitones 3 units wide) is not that hard to<br>>get used to with the proper harmony. What's more, the tritone is distinct<br>>from the half-octave -- in C major, the B sounds like an 11th harmonic over<br>>an F major chord -- a clear, surprising, and unique effect. Combining two<br>>diatonic scales a half-octave apart leads to a 14-tone set where all the<br>>consonant triads in one diatonic scale have their septimal completion in the<br>>other diatonic scale. The point is that there are many avenues for exploring<br>>the diatonic genus, all with their advantages and disadvantages.<br>><br>>}This follows from the principle of the melodic limen, and from<br>>}the incredibly close harmonic congruence between just intonation and the<br>>}19-tone equal.  I have not leisure here to treat this in the depth that<br>>}it deserves, but would like to observe something that I do not believe<br>>}has ever been clearly noticed before. If the consonances of the senario<br>>}are each taken as new tonics, we arrive at 19 just intervals within the<br>>}octave:<br>><br>>}1:1 25:24 16:15 10:9 9:8 16:15 5:4 32:25 4:3 25:18 36:25 3:2 25:16 8:5<br>>}      5:3 16:9 9:5 15:8 48:25 2:1<br>><br>>}These are the intervals that singers can actually sound accurately<br>>}singing pure consonances, although there is some debate concerning the<br>>}ability to reliably distinguish between the commatically separated<br>>}species of tones. Of these, the 19-tone equal merges the minor and major<br>>}tones, and also the two species of minor seventh, and intercalates the<br>>}augmented tone/diminished third and the augmented sixth/diminished<br>>}seventh.<br>><br>>Thus the "incredibly close harmonic congruence" is not a congruence, or<br>>one-to-one mapping at all -- it is a mere numerical coincidence. By<br>>contradistinction, the many highly symmetrical just schemes that intend to<br>>represent the 22-sruti system of India do form a one-to-one mapping with<br>>22-equal; that is, all consonant intervals in both are represented by the<br>>same number of steps. Similarly, the 22-tone just septimal tuning used by Ben<br>>Johnston in his 4th string quartet is similarly congruent to 22-equal.<br>><br>><br>>Graham Breed wrote,<br>><br>>}I haven't investigated Paul Erlich's decatonic<br>>}modes enough to decide if they can be treated as 10 pitch classes.<br>>}I don't like the theory because it clings to the idea of diatonic<br>>}harmony -- that all notes used in harmony must belong to the same key.<br>>}I'd rather work out a chord sequence, and fit a melody to it.  Or,<br>>}define a melodic mode, write a tune in it, and harmonise it<br>>}chromatically.<br>><br>>You can't deny that most Western music derives much of its beauty and<br>>contrapuntal versatility from having both vertical and horizontal sonorities<br>>taken from the same pitch set. These pitch sets have characteristic dissonant<br>>intervals which allow a "tonic" to be defined and when the pitch set changes,<br>>so does the tonic. In this way non-diatonic notes can anticipate a change of<br>>tonality before that tonality also arrives.<br>><br>>Moreover, the pitch sets in question have a certain structure which allows<br>>consonance and dissonance, which alone at best are only relative acoustical<br>>qualities, to achieve absolute grammatical significance. The reality of this<br>>is proved by the paradox of the augmented second which I mention above. The<br>>same interval can be heard as a dissonance or a consonance depending on<br>>whether it functions as a second or a third in the scale.<br>><br>>My decatonic scales in 22-equal provide a way of extending Western<br>>compositional techniques so that 7-limit tetrads, both otonal ("major") and<br>>utonal ("minor") may function instead of 5-limit triads as the basic<br>>consonant harmonies. A dodecatonic, 9-limit system is also present in<br>>22-equal, but it is purely modal -- the conditions for a tonal style are not<br>>fulfilled. Additionally, the consonance of 9-limit utonal pentads is<br>>questionable under certain timbral and inversional circumstances, while that<br>>of 11-limit otonal hexads is quite clear, so the symmetry between major and<br>>minor seems to completely break down beyond the 7-limit.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Adam Silverman <adam.silverman@yale.edu><br>Subject:  Re: Partch thesis<br>PostedDate:  16-12-97 20:42:15<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  16-12-97 20:40:10-16-12-97 20:40:10,16-12-97 20:39:49-16-12-97 20:39:49<br>DeliveredDate:  16-12-97 20:39:49<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656F.006C0AFE; Tue, 16 Dec 1997 20:42:03 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17240; Tue, 16 Dec 1997 20:42:15 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 16 Dec 1997 20:42:15 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA17235<br>Received: (qmail 17121 invoked from network); 16 Dec 1997 11:42:02 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 16 Dec 1997 11:42:02 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.94.971216143613.28372A-100000@mars.its.yale.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6683 href="#6683">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Jonathan M.
