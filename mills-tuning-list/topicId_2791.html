God knows it's a huge place, also<br>very old, so the possibilities are interesting. I personally believe that<br>the traditional (before the white guys took over) tunings were closely<br>related to the natural overtone series...I think it highly unlikely that<br>they were playing in any sort of eq temp until recently. A sitar has<br>moveable frets...no need for that if you only use an eq temp. Sarods are<br>fretless, ideal for finding the pure notes/ratios. Just look at the cover<br>of various sitar albums, and you will notice that the frets are NOT<br>always equally spaced. Of course, Shankar and others have played with<br>Western orchestras and such...perhaps they adapt their sound to the<br>tempered scale.<br>    Also, several folks have said Danielou's book is questionable, but no<br>one has said why...why? What did he say that was incorrect, and what,<br>then, IS correct?
