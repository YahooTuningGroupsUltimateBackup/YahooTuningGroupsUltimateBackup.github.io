Such crude resolution results in beating<br>> "mish-mash" compared to what can be produced with guitars or other<br>> acoustically based instruments.<br><br>i use kyma to send a bulk tuning dump to the ensoniq mr rack.  does anybody<br>know the tuning  resolution of the rack?  (are you out there, steve curtain?)<br> it sounds pretty darn good, especially for music consisting of relatively fast<br>events (like, techno).<br><br>i don't like using pitch bend...the pitch bend affects all notes on that<br>channel, meaning that you can really only do monophonic stuff.  yuck.<br><br>the ensoniq is really smart about its tuning stuff.  for example, octave<br>transposition really doubles the frequency.  it does NOT simply add 12 to the<br>note number.  you can have any arbitrary ordering of pitches (they don't have<br>to be increasing).  the rack chooses the appropriate sample based on frequency,<br>not on notenumber.  you'd be amazed how many synths claim to support alternate<br>tunings, but yet do not provide these little details.<br><br>marcus<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  DMB5561719@aol.com<br>Subject:  Re: No pop music?<br>PostedDate:  17-09-97 00:52:20<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  17-09-97 00:52:15-17-09-97 00:52:15,17-09-97 00:51:31-17-09-97 00:51:31<br>DeliveredDate:  17-09-97 00:51:31<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256514.007D9E2A; Wed, 17 Sep 1997 00:52:04 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04070; Wed, 17 Sep 1997 00:52:20 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 17 Sep 1997 00:52:20 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04056<br>Received: (qmail 3002 invoked from network); 16 Sep 1997 22:34:46 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 16 Sep 1997 22:34:46 -0000<br>Message-Id: <970916182827_-398349566@emout09.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6101 href="#6101">ðŸ”—</a>DFinnamore@aol.com</h3><span>9/16/1997 4:07:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>In a message dated 97-09-16 07:43:10 EDT, you write:<br><br>> > just a lot easier to tune a synth than a piano or guitar.<br>><br>>  Easier?????? to what precision????<br><br>You're right, of course - a guitar fretted specifically for a given non-ET<br>tuning is not hard to tune to that tuning.  I should have said "re-tune"<br>rather than "tune."  I was thinking of the scenario of experimenting with and<br>writing in several different tunings using the same intruments.

They are good music if you like that style, but they<br>don't seem to especially highlight the tuning.  Not that that's a problem,<br>except that if one wants to hear what "tuned" pop music sounds like, he<br>should listen to a piece that really sounds or feels different than the same<br>piece would in 12-tET or what's the point?  But it was the only example I<br>could think of to point out to Peter at the moment.<br><br>Please don't take that as a criticism of Lucy Tuning.  I like it and plan to<br>use it some myself.  I applaud your success in extending Harrison's idea and<br>your efforts to promote the tuning.<br><br>Hey, Peter, now that I think of it, there is a Soundgarden song on<br>"Superunknown" called "The 4th of July."  I don't know what tuning it's in,<br>but it's not quite 12-tET!  It's a very modal, chant-like melody with guitars<br>tuned about 3-steps below normal and a lot of string bending.  Frightful<br>lyric but fascinating music.<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net<br>Subject:  Re: JI Pop?
