Finding continuities between ancient Sanskrit music<br>theory and current 'classical' musical practices on the subcontinent is a=<br><br>highly speculative task. Alone, the impact of Islamicate (Hodgson's<br>exacting term) music culture on northern practice and the introduction of=<br><br>drones in both north and south would be sufficient factors for viewing<br>present practice as essentially discontinuous with the ancient. Ancient<br>theory seems to be largely 'pythagorean' in that a system is contructed b=<br>y<br>repeated applications of the same interval division while modern practice=<br><br>is a more static, vertical or even proto-harmonic construction. Further,<br>the interpretation of the old texts is hampered by several undecidables,<br>among them the definition of a _sruti_: Is a _sruti_ an interval of fixed=<br><br>size or is it a conceptual unit akin to the units of Axistoxenus? The<br>record seems to indicate that the ancient writers were not in agreement,<br>applying the term in contradictory ways, and this must be determined on a=<br><br>case-by-case basis.<br><br>It is a conservative assumption that Karnatic (southern) and the related<br>Sri Lankan traditions have been more conservative than the Hindustani<br>(northern) traditions. Again, however, the essential presence of the dron=<br>e<br>in present practice represents a discontinuity from ancient practice. The=<br><br>modern theoretical work in this field which is best respected is P.<br>Sambamoorthy's five volume _South Indian Music_ (Indian Music Publishing<br>House, Madras 1960). The (US) dissertations of Harry Powers, T.Viswanatha=<br>n,<br>Jon Higgins, K.S. Subramanian, and David Reck are invaluable guides to<br>contemporary practice.<br><br>Brian Lee wrote:<br><br><Anyone who wants to hear some of this music I would suggest get hold of<br><anything you can by Dr. L. Subramaniam who plays ragas on the western<br><violin.<br><br>While the instrument he plays may or not be a western violin, the tuning<br>and technique of playing (held between the player's chest and right inste=<br>p)<br>are entirely Karnatic. For exactitude of intonation and the extreme beaut=<br>y<br>of the performances, I would reccomend the old Nonesuch LPs of vocalist<br>K.V. Naranyaswami and flutist/vocalist T. Viswanathan.<br>   =<br><br>The pitch vocabulary of south Indian music as actually practiced is much<br>smaller than that used in the north. The _72 melakarta scheme_ presents a=<br>ll<br>36 modes from the possible combinations of two tetrachords a fifth apart<br>with a natural 4th degree (MA) and all 36 combinations with a sharpened 4=<br>th<br>substituted. The tetrachords are described in terms equivalent to<br>semitones:<br><br>Sa   Ri      Ga   Ma<br><br>S Rb Gbb          M<br>S Rb      Gb      M<br>S Rb          G   M<br>S    R    Gb      M<br>S    R        G   M<br>S         R#  G   M<br><br>No precise intonational values are assigned to these. Attention to<br>iontonation is focused on the slow _raga alapana_ section of a piece. Fro=<br>m<br>T. Viswanathan and K.S. Subramanian, I learned that Ga should always be a=<br><br>5/4, Ma 4/3, #Ma 45/32, Pa 3/2. Ri was always a 9/8 in #Ma ragas. Dha was=<br><br>usually 27/16, but was lowered to 5/3 when part of an ornament (_gamaka_)=<br><br>from the upper Sa. Likewise, 7/4 bNi was sometimes possible as part of an=<br><br>ornamented Dha. The intonational description of individual ragas is not<br>independent of the _gamakas_ and, beyond the generalities described here,=<br><br>both _gamakas_ and intonation will vary greatly from musician to musician=<br><br>and from school to school.    =<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1564<br>*************************</div>
