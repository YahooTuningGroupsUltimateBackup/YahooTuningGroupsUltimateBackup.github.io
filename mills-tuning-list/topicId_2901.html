Explore new tuning possibilities actively.<br>       Some of us have lamented how many theorists and how few practical<br>       musicians there were in the field.  I think that what matters the most<br>       is activity.  As Neil H. has pointed out, there are some theorists out<br>       there (Erv Wilson for example) who come up with some very insightful<br>       ideas for composers and performers to turn into musical reality.<br>2.  Discuss them, and compare their qualities, and our experiences with them.<br>       Though most of us agree that there should be no one single standard<br>       tuning in the future, some ideas relating to new tunings are more<br>       powerful than others.  I for one have come up with a fair number of<br>       dumb ideas along with the good ones.  The only ways to find out which<br>       of them are hot and which are not, are discussion and experimentation.<br>3.  Specialize in what we have the most talent for.<br>       Many of us, and I'm certainly among them, are sometimes guilty of trying<br>       to do too many pieces of the pie.  There's probably only so much value<br>       in, for example, Erv Wilson working to become a gig-a-day performer.<br>       That would take a lot of time away from his idea-spinning talents.<br>       Conversely, although Neil Haverstick could conceptually put his guitar<br>       down for couple months to devise a new tuning theory, that would be at<br>       the regrettable loss of two-months-worth of pure microtonal-music magic!<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Re: TUNING digest 1278<br>PostedDate:  27-12-97 03:40:49<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  27-12-97 03:38:38-27-12-97 03:38:39,27-12-97 03:38:06-27-12-97 03:38:06<br>DeliveredDate:  27-12-97 03:38:06<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125657A.000E8179; Sat, 27 Dec 1997 03:40:22 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA26098; Sat, 27 Dec 1997 03:40:49 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 27 Dec 1997 03:40:49 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA26095<br>Received: (qmail 17927 invoked from network); 26 Dec 1997 18:40:24 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 26 Dec 1997 18:40:24 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541103b0c9bc6d77d0@[207.207.2.137]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
