I thought I was being too obtuse for anyone to get this <br>message, but it's true. As usual, the results of an ill-conceived <br>matho-musical concept, that of tritave equivalence in this case, are <br>musically very interesting even though they do not corroborate the original <br>premises of the theory. What I did in my post was take the theory completely <br>at face value, and work out its consequences within the framework of the <br>faulty premise. The music will have a lot of interesting features as a <br>result of the tritave structures, but near-octaves will take on the <br>character of equivalence and the effect will be, as Gary pointed out, that <br>of entirely new harmonies within each octave span.<br><br>>   So the almost universal perception and agreement on the idea of octave<br>>equivalence bodes well for nonoctave tunings, because it ensures that they<br>>provide more harmonic variety than octave-based tunings (for a given<br>>scale-step size).<br><br>Whether this means an increase in harmonic variety, I don't know, because <br>(octave) inversions and extensions are very valuable in organizing harmonies <br>into coherent progressions. Perhaps it's an increase in variety, but at the <br>expense of unity.<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 29 Jul 1996 20:13 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA00053; Mon, 29 Jul 1996 11:13:39 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 29 Jul 1996 11:13:39 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960729110731.5746A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
