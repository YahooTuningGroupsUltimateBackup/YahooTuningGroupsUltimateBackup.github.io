Thus, for Gary's twist <br>tie string, you could divide the string into three parts, (regular string <br>on left and right, twist tie version in middle) and use Kalotas' <br>method. <br><br>However, the inverse problem is far more interesting from a musical <br>perspective: define a desired set of partials, and find a string with <br>contour so as to generate the desired partials. Unfortunately, this <br>inverse problem is as yet unsolved. <br><br>On a slightly different topic, Glen said: I can't imagine the air <br>conducting the sound from one string to the other.<br><br>I believe that sympathetic strings do indeed work by transferring <br>the energy through the air. As a simple experiment, sing into a string <br>on a guitar, and you can easily set the string to vibrating <br>(sympathetically) with your voice. <br><br><br>-Bill Sethares<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 5 Jan 1997 22:07 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02024; Sun, 5 Jan 1997 22:10:52 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02022<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA25131; Sun, 5 Jan 1997 13:10:49 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 5 Jan 1997 13:10:49 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701051608_MC1-E34-DC2A@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
