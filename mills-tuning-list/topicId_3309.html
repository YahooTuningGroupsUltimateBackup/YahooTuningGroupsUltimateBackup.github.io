I had figured them<br>out once, because their arrangement into<br>dyads  follows a geometrical pattern<br>across the keys, but they were never<br>written down.<br><br>The dial tone is also some kind of just<br>major 3rd.<br><br>Also, when I called someone tonight,<br>the sound of their phone ringing in my<br>earpiece was a trill-like alternation of two<br>tones which formed exactly the 19/16 we've<br>been discussing in the Hendrix chord<br>-- I had just listened to a MIDI sequence<br>of it I made right before I made the phone<br>call, and not only were my ears particularly<br>sensitized to it, but it was also in the<br>same key (F#)!<br> <br>It seems that microtones are creeping into<br>all sorts of nooks and crannies of our lives!<br><br>   Joseph L.
