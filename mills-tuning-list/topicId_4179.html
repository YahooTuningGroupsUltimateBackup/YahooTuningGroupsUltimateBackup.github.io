In<br>the number world, primes have a special property, that does not<br>translate into the music world. This is the case with the ninth which<br>can be explained as the 3 of 3 but musically exist as an entity itself.<br>This is not how it treated in many cases, the disjunction of tetrachords<br>being one example. The same can be said about the 15 in my experience,<br>There is also a problem with the word limit because if we talked of 11<br>limit it could be thought of as not being allowed. the word "cap" is<br>less ambiguous--<br>Kraig Grady<br>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br>http://www.anaphoria.com</div><h3><a id=8795 href="#8795">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/11/1998 6:01:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Wed, 11 Nov 1998, Sanford Forte wrote:<br>>                                       It seems that the combinations and<br>> permutations of musical scales/temperments is virtually infinite. So why<br>> wouldn't we all have "one of our own"? And maybe find one that "resonated"<br>> most closely with our"personal" temperment (pun intended) be the one we<br>> prefer?<br><br>This reminds me of something I've read about some Native American<br>musical traditions, namely that when making, let's say, a flute, the<br>builder would simply make the holes where they fell most comfortably<br>under his fingers, then learn the idiosyncrasies of the resulting scale<br>and use them in the music made on that flute.  I think some African<br>musicians may do something similar when they use the natural resonant<br>pitches of discovered objects in percussion instruments.  The<br>ethnomusicological term used for this kind of stuff is "found pitch".<br><br>--pH <manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu> http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote<br>    O<br>   /\        "Do you like to gamble, Eddie?<br>  -\-\-- o    Gamble money on pool games?"<br><br>             NOTE: dehyphenate node to remove spamblock.          <*><br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1578<br>*************************</div>
