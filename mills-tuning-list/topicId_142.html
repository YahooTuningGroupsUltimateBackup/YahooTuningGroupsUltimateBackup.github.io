All of them quickly generate a lot of scales, but<br>>they are, for the greater part, scales that can not be accurately<br>>reproduced on contemporary instruments.  Also, these methods are<br>>mostly indifferent to the consonance of the scales they produce.<br><br>Sad but true.  The especially odd part is that oscillator chips have pretty<br>good resolution but making them represent ET scales cuts this down<br>significantly.  <br><br>For instance, The OTTO chip in the ASR-10 has an 11-bit fractional phase<br>accumulator.  This means that a sample from unity up to an octave can<br>resolve 2048 different intervals.  An octave above that this number doubles<br>for each octave, and each octave below this is halved.  <br><br>The tuning tables are represented as 7 bits between semitones, which is 1524<br>steps or .78 cents.  However, the exponential table used to convert linear<br>frequency isn't long enough, which is why you really only get 768 steps or<br>the 1.5 cent resolution measured by Carter Scholz a number of years ago. <br>(Thanks to Bill Mauchly for this info) <br><br>What's needed is some kind of 'ratio mode' which calculates this directly<br>and sets up integer ratios between different voices.  Don't look for this in<br>any sort of product from us any time soon, though.  If you have a Soundscape<br>card it is possible to hit the OTTO chip directly from the PC and put in<br>your own ratios.  Writing some Forth code to do this and implement Marion's<br>variable loop length tuning method has been on my project stack for a while.<br>The only big problem is that the Soundscape waveforms are in ROM, but you<br>could possibly find different waveforms of different lengths and match them up.<br><br>regards,<br><br>Steve Curtin<br>Ensoniq Corp<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 2 Nov 1995 18:38 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA28879; Thu, 2 Nov 1995 08:38:00 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 2 Nov 1995 08:38:00 -0800<br>Message-Id:  <9511020837.aa10239@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
