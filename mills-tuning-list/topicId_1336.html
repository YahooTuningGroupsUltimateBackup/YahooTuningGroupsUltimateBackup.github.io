I think you have to choose between a<br>> wolf and a comma slip, and I generally prefer the former.<br><br>   Orrrr...  Let the tonic wander.

You suggest three approaches: (1) no change, accept some mistuned<br>chords, (2) shift pitch, or (3) let the tonic wander. In answer to how does<br>Justonic deal with this issue: we allow all three. The Justonic approach is<br>to not dictate how a musician should deal with this, but rather to give as<br>many options as possible. With our system: (1) a KEY change modulates the<br>key tonal center. (2) a ROOT change identifies the tonal center within a<br>key<br>and always in relation to the key (that is, a second ROOT change does not<br>modulate from the notes of the current harmony, but from the original key<br>tonal center). (3) NO ROOT CHANGE means that all tones retain their ratio<br>value to the key tonic, and therefore may result in mistuned harmonies,<br>wolf<br>notes, etc. (4) A fourth option is a SCALE change which can also happen in<br>real time, and can result in any "note" being assigned any ratio (pitch) at<br>any time. <br>        Where we go from here is to extended scales, non-octave scales, or<br>anything a composer or musician wants to do. If musicians and composers can<br>articulate to us what they want to achieve, we will attempt to build it<br>into<br>the Justonic system. We absolutely do not believe instrument designers<br>should be in the business of dictating how music should be played. That's<br>why we got into this, to create instruments that actually served musicians<br>and placed all parameters at their fingertips. <br>        The Justonic Tone Palette additive synthesizer does the same with<br>timbre, giving musicians precision and flexibility with both pitch and<br>timbre. It's a long road, but that's our vision. We have Ling Lun,<br>Pythagoras, Zalzal, Zarlino, Mersenne, Helmholtz, and a long line of others<br>beind us (or above us) encouraging us forward. Please forward any ideas or<br>questions. Cheers.    <br><br>Rex Weyler<br>Justonic<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 12 Dec 1996 16:03 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00564; Thu, 12 Dec 1996 16:05:20 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00526<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id HAA20819; Thu, 12 Dec 1996 07:05:18 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 07:05:18 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612121000_MC1-D08-8847@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
