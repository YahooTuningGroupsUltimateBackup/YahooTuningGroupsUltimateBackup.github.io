You get nearly the same random<br>access ability as with CD, you can even set loops up,<br>and they're hard to beat for rugged, tiny good sounding<br>audio-on-the-go.<br><br>IMHO, they best all but the most fastidiously aligned<br>cassette machines, and the latest Sony home decks (JE-510)<br>are sub $300 now, and sound great.  I have the slightly<br>earlier JE-500, and find that the live recordings I've<br>done with it are better than those I've made with <br>dbx and metal cassettes on my Marantz PMD-430.<br><br>YMMV, of course.  <br><br>(Then again, neither sound as good to me as 10.5 inch reels of tape<br>@15ips but you won't see me with one of those on the subway,<br>either. ;-)<br><br>Steve</div><h3><a id=7305 href="#7305">ðŸ”—</a>wauchope@AIC.NRL.Navy.Mil</h3><span>3/27/1998 5:14:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>QuickTime 2.5 (built-in Macintosh software synthesizer) uses 9 bits of<br>pitch bend information over a +-2 semitone range, for a resolution of<br>1536 steps/octave.  I wouldn't be too sad...that's the same resolution<br>as the Ensoniq MR Rack tuning tables, giving a maximum error of about<br>0.4 cent and on average half that.<br> <br>I'm not a MAX user, but assuming that xbendouts are the same as MIDI<br>pitch bend messages (+-8192 = 14 bits), you can round off to the<br>nearest multiple of 32 for best results since I imagine QT just<br>truncates the higher bits.<br><br>QuickTime 3.0 is just out in beta release, with a better sounding and<br>more complete set of instruments (Roland GM and GS) than 2.5.  The<br>Just Intonation Calculator (JICalc) continues to work with QT3.0, but<br>seems to require a machine with more than 8MB of memory to stay<br>afloat.<br><br>P.S. On a related subject, I was surprised to discover that my Yamaha<br>SY99's pitch bend resolution is a measly 384/octave at the +-2<br>semitone range, increasing to 768/octave at +-1 semitone.  I had<br>assumed it would be the same as the tuning tables, which are the<br>standard Yamaha 1024/octave.  Just goes to show that experimentation<br>is a Good Thing.<br><br>Ken Wauchope<br><br>> Dear MAX-MICROTUNISTS on this list,<br><br>> Did I ask this before?<br>> I'm still using QT2.5 as the sound module for my MAX3.0.<br>> I love microtuning things so use a bunch of xbendout oriented things in<br>> my patch....but now wondering...if my QT is handling 14bit-bend-date<br>> correctly...my ear is not good enough to test this...ah..<br>> So sad if it's only handling it as the 7bit thing and ignoring the rest.</div>
