My error function<br>was thus 3*(F-X)^2 + 5*(TM-4*X+2*OCT)^2 + 5*(MS-3*X+0CT)^2.<br>(Fï¿½nts(3/2), TMï¿½nts(5/4), MScents(5/3), OCT1200)<br>Your weights are 9 25 25, the squares of these. I weighted<br>the derivatives, you the squared errors themselves. I'm not <br>sure which is more correct mathematically, but your unweighted<br>gives a slightly lower sum of sq'ed errors.<br><br>I thought our original question was optimising meantone-like<br>tunings. When one goes beyond the meantone range, other functions<br>must be used (8 fifths down for TM, 14 down for the Harmonic 7th,<br>8 d or 9up  for the TM for doubly positive systems).<br><br>Yes, I agree that JI triads are better than MT.<br><br>I agree that the 15/8 is much less important than the 6/5. In<br>fact if one sets the errors of the third and fifth equal,<br>one gets the 1/3 comma meantone, if opposite in sign, the 1/5<br>comma. In the first case the 6/5 is just, the second, the 15/8.<br>I have analysed the tunings in my post in terms of the abs values<br>of the errors. In which case the errors of the 5/3 and 15/8 may<br>or may not be equal in a given tuning. The sum of the  F and T<br>errors may or may not equal the errors in either the 5/3 or 15/8. <br>I could take the algebraic sum of the errors rather than the abs <br>value instead, I suppose.<br><br>Somewhat to my surprise, using the ABS function did not generate<br>any tunings different from the ones I got by the lst squares<br>technique or simply setting the errors equal or opposite. The<br>exact solution depended upon whether I minimized the abs(sum)<br>or sum of ABS (errors) as expected, but the results were still<br>tunings I already had.<br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 6 Mar 1997 22:26 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07942; Thu, 6 Mar 1997 22:26:42 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08006<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id NAA04439; Thu, 6 Mar 1997 13:24:52 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 6 Mar 1997 13:24:52 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B0E05094CC68A.6381@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5038 href="#5038">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>3/10/1997 9:57:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com><br><br>John Chalmers has derived some meantone tunings using the augmented sixth as <br>the approximation to the harmonic seventh.
