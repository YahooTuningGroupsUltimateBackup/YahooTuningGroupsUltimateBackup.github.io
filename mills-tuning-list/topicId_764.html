And, this is<br>> VERY subjective...I just don't like listening to his stuff because of<br>> the "vibe" inherent in his music...<br><br>I had to work out my own feelings on this subject, and came to some sort <br>of resolution.  HP's moods came from much deeper than the harmonies, but <br>must have had some sort of grave extramusical bitterness involved <br>(Extrabitter Music?  Bitter Extramusic?).  Actually, the person who <br>helped me deal with this the best was Dean Drummond, who hasn't been <br>given much credit around here for being the closest to HP's music, be it <br>on HC, string quartet or zoomoozophone.  He pointed out that the <br>crassness is a built-in factor, and is not meant to be attractive.  While <br>Harry's music is satirical to the LCD (see: "Exercises in Counterpoint <br>Tried in a Court of Ancient Ritual", or the "Do Not Loiter" section of <br>_Dreamer_), is must not be expected to lift the spirit like "Don't Worry, <br>Be Happy".  None of it does, with the possible exception of the Lewis <br>Carroll songs.  After abandoning the music for a while, I have come back <br>to it full-force, with a love and respect for its similarity to "Four <br>Saints In Three Acts"--unsubtle satire with tongue firmly in cheek.  My, <br>don't I take myself too seriously sometimes.<br><br>Yours,<br>Adam<br><br>P.S.: Did anyone notice that "Don't Worry, Be Happy" is good 5-limit JI?  <br>Maybe Toby Twining should cover it:)<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 20 Aug 1996 07:16 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06578; Tue, 20 Aug 1996 07:59:21 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06585<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA21682; Mon, 19 Aug 1996 22:59:18 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 19 Aug 1996 22:59:18 -0700<br>Message-Id: <2.2.32.19960820055744.0067526c@adnc.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
