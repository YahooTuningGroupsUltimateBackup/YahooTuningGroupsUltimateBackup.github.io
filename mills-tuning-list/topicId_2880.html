This is a matter of elementary knowledge.<br>>}Look in any elementary text on the subject.<br>><br>>No text I have seen, elementary or otherwise, has made this claim. Neil<br>>Haverstick is quite right (if I may interpret "chord changes" as "key<br>>changes") that equal temperament arises only in response to the need to<br>>modulate (change key) extensively. Two cultures make extensive use of<br>>modulation: the West and Thailand. The solutions they have arrived at are<br>>12-equal and 7-equal, respectively. Meantone temperament was the preferred<br>>system in the West before modulations became too extensive; Thailand may have<br>>been influenced by Chinese Pythagorean theories before modulation became a<br>>major feature of that music. The most widely accepted interpretations of the<br>>Indian 22-sruti system place no note more than a comma away from a 12-equal<br>>pitch. No wonder that Indian musicians, both North and South, have accepted<br>>12-equal far more readily than some 22-equal harmoniums, etc. that some<br>>ill-informed Westerners have provided them.<br>><br>>}Your definition of the syntonic comma is one definition, but it is<br>>}irrelevant to a discussion of precisely how the consonant cycles are to<br>>}be reconciled in an equal temperament.<br>><br>>Hmm. Your reconcilability criterion is that four fifths add up to a major<br>>third (octaves ignored). In other words, the difference between a major third<br>>and four fifths is zero. Using my definition of a syntonic comma, this<br>>translates to: the syntonic comma is zero. Far from irrelevant -- it is<br>>equivalent to the whole "discussion."<br>><br>>}Your assertion that you have never denied 22-tone equal to be unfit for<br>>}diatonicism comes strangely from someone who has proclaimed this system<br>>}the salvation of music, but perhaps you mean to preserve 12-tone equal<br>>}for diatonicism. I have heard this sort of thing before - it always<br>>}reduces to "something special for ME" and 12-tone equal for everybody<br>>}else.<br>><br>>If I didn't want it to be for everyone I would have patented a keyboard<br>>layout for the decatonic scale. The salvation of music -- hardly. I merely<br>>feel that, if the next generation of musicians is given a wide variety of<br>>tuning systems to play with, and only one of them succeeds in producing a<br>>wealth of music that is not diatonic or pentatonic but is tonal, or at least<br>>carries on in some sense the popular tradition in Western music of an<br>>interplay between melody and harmony, there is a chance that that tuning will<br>>be 22-equal.<br>><br>>}The modern Arab theorists have done their utmost to impose the 24-tone<br>>}equal for instrumental music. But Arab singers cheerfully (if that is<br>>}the right word) go their own way, and certainly do not regularly,<br>>}deliberately use intervals as close as 50 cents<br>><br>>No, but they use intervals close to 150 and 250 cents, the reason for<br>>24-equal. 31-equal, containing 155- and 348-cent intervals, will clearly be<br>>much more succesful for reproducing Arabic music than 19-equal, which has<br>>absolutely nothing in the way of neutral seconds or thirds.<br>><br>>}I think I have mentioned that this interval of about 150 cents occurs in<br>>}the 31-tone equal, where it corresponds to a 4/5 tone. Note however that<br>>}this interval is perfectly unadapted to harmony, which the modern Arabs<br>>}and Indians often seek to imitate.<br>><br>>In your opinion, then, whatever is unique about Arabic music is less<br>>important to Arabic musicians than Western features that they seek to<br>>imitate?<br>><br>>}My own personal opinion is that Arab<br>>}(and Indian) vocal melodies are far, far more likely to be exactly<br>>}recognizable in the 19-tone equal than in the 17- 22- or 24-tone<br>>}divisions, in despite of the troublesome matter of the 150-cent<br>>}interval.<br>><br>>Not only 24, but also 17, would be better for Arabic music than 19. Just take<br>>the step sizes of the various seven-tone scales in Arabic music in 24-equal,<br>>subtract 1 form the size of each step, and you have serviceable 17-equal<br>>approximations, including 141- and 353-cent intervals. I am not sure if the<br>>dissonant thirds of 17-equal would matter to the sound of the music or if<br>>consonant thirds are a concern only proper to certain other musical cultures.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Steven Rezsutek <rezsutek@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov><br>Subject:  The Intonational Preferences of Irish Setters<br>PostedDate:  22-12-97 23:58:46<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  22-12-97 23:56:38-22-12-97 23:56:38,22-12-97 23:56:10-22-12-97 23:56:10<br>DeliveredDate:  22-12-97 23:56:10<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256575.007E0556; Mon, 22 Dec 1997 23:58:25 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22896; Mon, 22 Dec 1997 23:58:46 +0100<br>Date: Mon, 22 Dec 1997 23:58:46 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA23988<br>Received: (qmail 24339 invoked from network); 22 Dec 1997 14:58:42 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 22 Dec 1997 14:58:42 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199712222256.RAA20388@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
