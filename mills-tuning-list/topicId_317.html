This is a practical<br>impossibility with wavetable synthesis, since manufacturers's<br>won't release the specs.<br><br>However the specs for FM synthesis as implemented in the Sound<br>Blaster are readily available.  The output frequency in<br>proportional to a number written into a tuning register, and this<br>number can be any integer up to 1024.<br><br>With this information, it is relatively simple to determine<br>whether a JI scale can be exactly represented on the Sound<br>Blaster.  You just have to convert the scale to a multi-level<br>fraction.  To do that, just find the least common multiple of the<br>numerators of the fractions that make up the scale.  If that<br>number is less than or equal to 1/2 the highest integer you can<br>user to program the hardware, then your scale can be exactly<br>represented.  Otherwise it can't.  That procedure will work for<br>most systems using frequency linear tuning.  The notable<br>exception to this is the Amiga, which uses wavelength linear<br>tuning.  In that case you need to find the LCM of the<br>denominators of the fractions of your scales.<br><br>What Manuel suggested in his post was letting the fundamental of<br>the scale vary in order to maximize the tuning accuracy for the<br>whole scale.  That is also the basis of the technique discussed<br>above.<br><br>It is also possible to use this technique to find best fits for<br>scales that cannot be represented exactly.  For example, let's<br>find a couple of them for Agricola's Monochord posted on this<br>forum some time ago by John Chalmer's.<br><br>Agricola's Monochord<br><br>LCM:   2^14*3^7*5<br><br> 12       17496         243/       128<br> 11       16384          16/         9  Grave Minor Seventh<br> 10       15552          27/        16  Pyth Major Sixth<br>  9       14580         405/       256<br>  8       13824           3/         2  Perfect Fifth<br>  7       12960          45/        32  Augmented Fourth<br>  6       12288           4/         3  Perfect Fourth<br>  5       11664          81/        64  Pyth Major Third<br>  4       10935        1215/      1024<br>  3       10368           9/         8  Major Tone<br>  2        9720         135/       128<br>  1        9216           1/         1  Unison<br><br>The fundamental, 9216, factors into:  9216 = 2^10*3^2<br><br>It's easy to see from this that if we want to have the<br>fundamental be one of the notes represented exactly, we are<br>limited to numbers with factors of 2 and 3.  18 and 24 provide<br>some pretty good approximations, as show below.<br><br>                        18       24<br><br>       b    17496      972      729<br>      a#    16384 910.2222 682.6666<br>       a    15552      864      648<br>      g#    14580      810    607.5<br>       g    13824      768      576<br>      f#    12960      720      540<br>       f    12288 682.6666      512<br>       e    11664      648      486<br>      d#    10935    607.5  455.625<br>       d    10368      576      432<br>      c#     9720      540      405<br>       c     9216      512      384<br><br>Since all scales can be represented as collections of rational<br>fractions to any desired degree of accuracy, this technique is<br>theoretically extensible to all scales, although fractions with<br>numerators having large prime factors make it rapidly more<br>difficult.<br><br>Marion<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 30 Jan 1996 08:02 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id XAA16527; Mon, 29 Jan 1996 23:02:31 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 29 Jan 1996 23:02:31 -0800<br>Message-Id: <960130064739_71670.2576_HHB45-8@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
