Thus, how is<br>it that you are able to decide that sine waves are "distinguished and<br>digestable" when described in harmonic context but suddenly not so when<br>renotated as subharmonic?<br><br>(2) Or do you define as subharmonic any complex without 2^n as the lowest<br>member?  A spacing theory would compare the notations to determine which<br>characterization is more likely (if neither is, then the neutral<br>characterization is chosen). Your algorithm - and I do wish to examine it<br>in detail - strikes me as a root direction theory (and more in the<br>Hindemith than in the Rameau direction). The lack of register specificity<br>in your algorithm would however seem to be problematic in light of all<br>experimental evidence (and in light of traditional musics and<br>instrumentation). Both Clarence  Barlow and James Tenney have profitably<br>included absolute frequency in their agorithms. <br><br>(3) You cite several psychoacoutistical certainties in support of your<br>algorithm, I am especially curious to learn of experimental results<br>supporting (a) "in a purely psychoacoustical sense, a chord played will<br>evoke certain interpretations in terms of the harmonic series"; this may be<br>what your algorithm tells me, and is a conjecture that I would like to<br>support, but I would like to find experimental evidence in this direction<br>(and I have encountered evidence to the contrary: see Boomsliter and Creel<br>on the 7th partial); (b) "the earï¿½s central pitch processor simply doesnï¿½t<br>go that far"; I am completely confused by this: what do you mean by<br>"central pitch processor", and how far, exactly does it go? The harmonic<br>progression I presented, and its Pythagorean interpretation are simply too<br>obiquitous to be dismissed in this way.<br><br>(4) The sequential procedure would be something like the following: given<br>the complex 500 Hz,<br>600 Hz 750 Hz, the first ratio interpreted would be the 3/2 fifth of<br>750/500, the initial interpretation would be 3/2 in a harmonic series over<br>fundamental 250Hz; however, not finding an intermediate tone between 2 and<br>3,  successive fifths in the series are scanned to find a similar complex,<br>examining each n(2,3) until an intermediate tone is located that matches<br>the complex. When, for example 10,12,15 over a fundamental of 50 Hz is<br>selected, then it is compared with its subharmonic notation /6,/5,/4. If<br>this characterization is more simple, then it is chosen. (Need I add the<br>fact that the difference tones of this complex are all within the spectrum<br>of 50 Hz? (The careful reader will note that I was cautious about the<br>register of this particular example)).<br><br>(5) All of the progressions that I described work - both acoustically, are<br>to found in existing repertoire, AND on paper. We (industrialized<br>westerners) have come, through historical reasons (largely inertia) to the<br>practice of using a single Pythagorean pitch notation to indicate a<br>diversity of wildly varying intonational environments. That certain tuning<br>systems, temperaments among them, may map onto harmonic series is probably<br>true, but it requires a definition of intervallic tolerance that seems to<br>me to be musically (i.e. culturally, and thus limited to particular times<br>and places) defined, and probably outside of the domain of psychoacoustics<br>proper: (a) tolerance may be a function of existing instrumental and<br>room-acoustic capacities; (b) tolerance may depend upon durational<br>conventions within a musical repertoire; (c) tolerance is a property of<br>warp-able analog recording and digital sampling rates; (d) La Monte Young<br>has demonstrated the perceptibility of ratios involving larger primes<br>through the use of extended duration sound environments).<br><br>(6) Your statement _the ear doesnï¿½t continue its harmonic series math from<br>one chord to the next_ is unsupported, and probably unsupportable. It is<br>certainly musically untenable, unless you mean that the mechanism for<br>relating pitches in diachronic sequences to one another is independent from<br>the synchronic mechanism. This is possible, but seems inefficient in light<br>of the evidence that so much of acoustical processing is done by sharing<br>facilities. If you intend a separate _Gestalt_-type mechanism for chords<br>and another mechanism for successions, what do you do about broken chords?<br><br>(7) I cannot resist a few more remarks on the subharmonic. First, although<br>for musical purposes we never need get past fairly small numbers, while<br>every harmonic complex  may be renotated as subharmonic and vice versa, due<br>to one of those nice paradoxes in the fundamentals of mathematics - and<br>beyond my ability to explain - the number of members in the harmonic series<br>is greater than that in the subharmonic series. Second, the _descent to the<br>infinitesimal_ represents to me a series of increasingly complex - indeed,<br>counterintuitive - calculations, hence my speculation about increased<br>mental activity. The ascription of quantum effects to the infinitesimal<br>comes from the intuitionist C. Hennix, resident mathematician at the<br>Institute for Psychoanalysis in Paris; Third, musical examples of the<br>subharmonic are readily available in the repertoire, cf Martin Vogelï¿½s book<br>on the _Tristan_ chord, or this little example from the Rondo K.494, m<br>164-165, where the left hand sustains for two measures the chord c4 d4 f4<br>ab4, which moves (does not resolve) to c4 f4 a4, i.e subharmonic seventh<br>chord from c moving to f major 6-4. Mozart uses this chord, here and<br>elsewhere, in a voice leading distinctive from his use of diminished and<br>dominant seventh chords. By my spacing characterization, the fourth c-f<br>would be too important to overlook, and the traditional (in American<br>practice) _half diminished_ description seems not very useful.  If this<br>were in just intonation, I would choose a subharmonic characterization /8<br>/7 /6 /5 over the harmonic 105 120 140 175.  I am curious to learn how<br>Pauls algorithm will interpret this chord (16 18 21 26? or 24 27 32 38?). <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 26 Sep 1996 17:13 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA32492; Thu, 26 Sep 1996 17:13:40 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA20847<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA12290; Thu, 26 Sep 1996 08:13:03 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 26 Sep 1996 08:13:03 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960926080434.4998A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
