If any of you tuners have suggestions in the form of a name<br>and some kind of address, would you be kind enough to email me with the<br>information? As some of you know, I am a moving target, on tour since t=0<br>and remaining so for the next generation, so email is practically the only<br>way to hit me. But, you could leave a message on my service, if there is no<br>other way. (212) 866-1889, but I will hate you in the morning.<br><br>Thanks, and all the best.<br><br>tm<br><br>PS> when you hear it, go gentle: I did the best I could....you guys are as<br>mean as snakes.<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 7 Nov 1995 19:56 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA18982; Tue, 7 Nov 1995 09:55:58 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 7 Nov 1995 09:55:58 -0800<br>Message-Id:  <9511070953.aa01891@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
