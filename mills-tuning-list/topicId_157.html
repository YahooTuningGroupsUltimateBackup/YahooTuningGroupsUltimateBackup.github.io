He said that western<br>art gradually turned from presentations of abstractions to explanations of<br>abstractions, until the explanation began to "proxy" for the experience<br>itself.  This is found in musical scores that are impossible to play, as well<br>as scores that verbally explain what to do.  The art isn't found so much in <br>the presentation as the idea.  I think this is fine, but as long as the art is<br>found in the idea, let's just keep it an idea and not bother with actually<br>playing the pieces (then Boulez's music could still be popular!)<br>	Since you mentioned Nancarrow, note how he wrote pieces that are <br>impossible to play, but used the player piano to realize those pieces.  His <br>music is meant to be HEARD.<br><br>> At least *we* euro-dudes can ALWAYS<br>> come up with bigger, better, more<br>> impressive *charts* of our compositions<br>> than any other musical culture on earth!<br>> (A typically priapic male obsession.  "Mine<br>> is bigger than yours..."  My compositional<br>> diagram, that is.  No wonder there are<br>> so few famous women composers.  Can anyone<br>> imagine a *woman* wasting 6 months of her<br>> life straight-edging a bunch of chicken-scratches<br>> that explain something everyone can already<br>> *hear*???)<br><br>	One of my many mottos about music is, If it doesn't SOUND interesting,<br>it isn't.<br><br>> So here's a helpful suggestion: when giving lectures or<br>> concerts, microtonalists should project an overhead<br>> transparency of the New York subway system and<br>> throw in some gibberish about "pitch class<br>> matrices" and "all-interval sets" and "maximally<br>> symmetric stochastic distributions."  <br>> --mclaren<br>	<br>	Yeah, I think I was at that lecture.  A Xenakis collaboration with <br>Cage (or maybe it was Andy Warhol).  <br>	Thanks for a very Entertaining and thoughtful posting.<br>						Morgan E.
