Any perspective from you 88CET experimenters (with<br>>near-harmonic timbres)?  Warren, John P., Paul F.?<br><br>I was not referring to 88CET, as I have never worked with this tuning. Nor <br>was I saying that the nearest available approximation to an octave would <br>automatically work like one. The point is that if a note comes close enough <br>to an octave or a multiple octave, it will sound equivalent, especially in <br>the case of harmonic partials. For example, an interval of 33 Pierce steps <br>exhibits equivalence, even though it is a very different pitch class in the <br>tritave scheme. Even when the even partials are removed, I believe the <br>virtual pitch sensation is not very octave-specific.<br><br>In the case of inharmonic partials, octave equivalence may play less of a <br>role, but still exists, and is less demanding as to intonation. Gamelan <br>music is a case in point: a recent post indicated that Javanese musicians <br>are well aware of the pure octave, probably through second-order beating, <br>but they prefer to detune it and find quite a wide range of acceptable <br>octave sizes.<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 31 Jul 1996 22:37 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id NAA01503; Wed, 31 Jul 1996 13:37:44 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 31 Jul 1996 13:37:44 -0700<br>Message-Id: <14960731202141/0005695065PK1EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3368 href="#3368">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/1996 9:54:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> The point is that if a note comes close enough <br>> to an octave or a multiple octave, it will sound equivalent, especially in <br>> the case of harmonic partials.

I haven't tried 33<br>Pierce-Bohlen steps for comparison.  <br><br>   I personally find that, despite classical theoretical premises,<br>octave-equivalence weakens with the more octaves you stack up.  The feeling, to<br>my ears at least, that two Cs three or four octaves apart are of the same pitch<br>class, is less compelling than two Cs a single octave apart.  <br><br>   That of course depends heavily on how the two notes are used.  Especially,<br>whether they're played together or in sequence, and how many notes appear<br>between them.  And of course it depends upon timbre.  <br><br>   Based upon that, I suspect that the (roughly) eighth-tone error of a<br>33-Pierce-Bohlen-step interval would be less ... uhmmm ... "damaging" for lack<br>of a better word ... to the four-octave sensation than that (roughly) same error<br>from 88CET's closest approximation to a single octave, because the four-octave<br>sensation is comparatively weak to start with.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 7 Aug 1996 20:52 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12453; Wed, 7 Aug 1996 20:51:17 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12563<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA15169; Wed, 7 Aug 1996 11:52:03 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 7 Aug 1996 11:52:03 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.960807112754.26350G-100000@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
