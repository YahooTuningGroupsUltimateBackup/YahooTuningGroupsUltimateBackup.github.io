They're limited to filtering<br>and<br>>mixing of the prerecorded timbres, while FM synthesis creates<br>harmonically<br>>rich spectra by frequency modulation of sine or more complex waves.<br><br>The Yamaha (the one at Yale's CSMT, Adam Silverman should be able to<br>tell us which one) did have FM capabilities. However, I didn't think of<br>that as "synthesis from scratch." Looking back at Gary's query, however,<br>I see that he would indeed qualify it.<br><br>>The sample playback side of the Yamaha does include a bunch of<br>>synthetic waveforms, but Gary was more interested in the FM synthesis<br>>side, which uses oscillators (sine wave and variants) as raw material<br>>for cooking up much more complex sounds.<br><br>Yamaha's synthetic waveforms are themselves FM-based, and can be used to<br>FM one another.</div>
