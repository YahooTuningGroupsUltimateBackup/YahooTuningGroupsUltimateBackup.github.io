''<br><br>While I do agree that western Art musics have gone to extremes in this<br>direction, I think that there are plenty of examples of cultures where the<br>''unsingable'' is a constituent part of instrumental music, or more<br>precisely, where instrumental realizations of song become ''unsingable''.<br>The most virtuosic Mbira music is one example. Chinese, Korean, and<br>Japanese court musics often fall into this category with marked differences<br>between the sung and instrumental versions of a work; the legal limitations<br>on music making (e.g. forbidding melodies from exceeding a seventh) at<br>certain points in their histories certainly turned melodies into<br>''unsingable''. There are also instrumental traditions which are<br>constructed on relatively abstract bases (Balophone playing based on<br>patterns, the Balinese ritual 7-tone orchestras whose melodies are<br>extracted mechanically from the vowels of  texts).<br><br>The question of ''unplayable'' musics, on the other hand, is much more<br>complicated.  Perhaps from San Diego, John, you might be better able to<br>disambiguate what the Ferneyhoughites have in mind when notating a rhythm<br>that is impossible to perform accurately - do they want the failed<br>performance (a kind of improvisation on the composer's notation), or is<br>there an ideal performance which is to be eventually achieved? I suspect<br>that the general disinterest by the complexity folk in computer<br>realizations (a significant difference from Babbitt, by the way) indicates<br>that they are more interested in failure...<br><br>Could you perhaps be more specific about what you mean by ''unnatural<br>intervals''? (I assume that it requires mature and consenting pitches).<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 24 Mar 1997 20:33 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13717; Mon, 24 Mar 1997 20:33:15 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13722<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id LAA17957; Mon, 24 Mar 1997 11:31:30 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 24 Mar 1997 11:31:30 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01510101af5c1167bd73@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5196 href="#5196">ðŸ”—</a>rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz (Ray Tomes)</h3><span>3/26/1997 3:37:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com> wrote:<br>>Frankly, just because something is old doesn't make it right. <br>>Astrology developed during Hellenistic times largely on the basis <br>>of earlier Babylonian astronomy and only makes sense if one believed <br>>that the planets are gods.
