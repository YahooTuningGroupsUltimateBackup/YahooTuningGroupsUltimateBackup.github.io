To read them yourself, go to <br><br>http://www.patents.ibm.com/fcgi-bin/patquery<br><br>the IBM patent server (a wonderful web site at which you can access all <br>patents after 1971 and many before, with powerful search engines.)<br><br>	The essence of Buzz's patents are these points: <br>1. Acoustic guitars do not have adjustable bridges, so,<br><br>    add an adjustable bridge to an acoustic guitar to compensate for the <br>stretching of strings due to fretting<br><br>2. The nut of acoustic guitars is traditionally cut so that fretting in <br>the first position produces greater tension than fretting in higher <br>positions, so,<br><br>    shorten the fingerboard at the nut end to compensate for this effect.<br><br>I must say, I am not impressed. Buzz may be well meaning and his method <br>may compensate for a too-high nut, but why not just cut the nut properly <br>in the first place? I realize that arguments can be made that some <br>repetoir may require allowance for greater string excursion for vigorous <br>strumming in the open position, but in general the nut should be cut so <br>that the distance from the first fret to the string is the same as that <br>from the second fret to the string when the first is fretted. If someone <br>can give me a valid reason why the nut should not be treated as the 0th <br>fret, I will eat a bug (I get to choose the bug and the method of <br>preparation). <br>	I have nothing against Buzz or innovation in tuning systems, and <br>no axe to grind, but unless he has made new discoveries not listed in his <br>latest patent (issued March 17, 1998) the hype and talk of meantone and <br>other temperaments in the ads and media is nonsense. Buzz's patents speak <br>only to an improvement in intonation of 12TET (although the rule of 18 is <br>specifically referred to in the patents, rather than 12th root of 2) as <br>realized on an acoustic guitar with a too-high nut and uncompensated bridge. <br><br>Your loveable old crank, <br><br>John Starrett <br>http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</div>
