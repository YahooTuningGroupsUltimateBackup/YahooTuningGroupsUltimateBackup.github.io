The problem seems to be <br>caused by tabs and carriage returns in text originally <br>written in Word and converted to ascii for upload.<br>(The =09 codes are tabs, the =20 CR's.)<br><br>The CR's are a bit of a problem as word-wrapping seems erratic<br>without them.<br><br>I have reformatted the tables and will send them to <br>anyone who requests them (or repost the message if there <br>is sufficient interest). I think John Loffink's post pretty much <br>covered the essentials, however.<br><br><br>--John</div><h3><a id=7429 href="#7429">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>4/10/1998 6:48:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Note that the tones were specifically designed to avoid harmonics.<br><br>   Ivor Darreg claimed that "DTMF" pitches coincided *fairly* well with 14TET.<br><br>   Also, there is a tone for each row and a tone for each column.  Each<br>button sounds two (ideally) sine waves, and one of the two tones is<br>identical for each button on the same row, or on the same column.<br><br>   Military phones have a fourth column, by way.</div>
