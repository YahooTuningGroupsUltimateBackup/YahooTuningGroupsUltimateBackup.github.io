I have always been interested in just<br>intonation (in high school, I would get together with friends just for<br>tuning sessions) and did study with Ben Johnston at Northwestern in the<br>mid 80s (Ben came up from Urbana two days a week for a couple of years<br>after he had retired, and before he moved east.)<br><br>I have written several works that show my fascination with the harmonic<br>series, especially partials 7 and 11. For example, My _Symphony for Winds<br>and Percussion_ (which has been played hundreds of times) ends with a<br>final chord of Eb, F, G, A (quarter flat), Bb, which is, of course,<br>partials 8 through 12.<br><br>More recently, I have turned my attentions to the piano, and have devised<br>a system of just intonation where the diatonic notes are derived from just<br>triads on C, F and G and Bb, Ab and Eb are all tuned to 'blue thirds'<br>(7:6 minor thirds) and F# and C# are tuned to the 11th partials of C and G<br>respectively.  (Actually, it's a little more complicated than this, since<br>I use the concept of a divided keyboard, and the sharps below middle C are<br>tuned differently, since higher partials down there seem less useful to<br>me.)<br><br>I also now teach intervals to my freshmen in just intonation.  I figure<br>that, since few of them are keyboardists, why should I teach them an<br>equal-tempered Major third (which sounds so bad) when they should really<br>be trying for 5/4 thirds.  They have responded positively, and I think<br>that the ensembles play more in tune for this training.<br><br>I also give them harmonic dictations in Just intonation, again, so that<br>they have real in-tune playing as a model.  I have to plan out my<br>dictations to avoid 'wolfs' (wolves? <G>), but it seems worth the effort.<br>Most students have expressed support for this.<br><br>I did have an interesting experience with this:  One student with a<br>'golden ear' made an error on his final exam (his only error all semester<br>on a dictation). I had played a just perfect fifth, and the two notes<br>blended so well that he could not distinguish them apart, and could only<br>guess what the interval might be (he guessed a P4th.)  (I wish that all<br>my students had problems like this!)<br><br>Enough!   I look forward to participating.<br><br>Joe Downing,<br>in Syracuse<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 5 Dec 1996 23:15 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14906; Wed, 4 Dec 1996 22:55:59 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA21296<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA04765; Wed, 4 Dec 1996 13:55:50 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 4 Dec 1996 13:55:50 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612042152.NAA04487@sunatg1><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
