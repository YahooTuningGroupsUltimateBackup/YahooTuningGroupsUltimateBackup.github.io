Their<br>product sounds very similar to the dynamic just intonation project I am<br>planning to embark upon.<br><br>Thanks for any info,<br><br>Ben Denckla<br><br>> he played a corporate propaganda tape by Justonic Tuning Inc.  I had<br>> spoken with Rex Weyler before, but I didn't have much feel for how<br>> serious a company they were.  It seems likely from the tape and from<br>> Erv Wilson's impressions, that they're very real and very determined to<br>> get their automatically justifying synthesizers out on the market.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 12 Nov 1996 22:28 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01792; Tue, 12 Nov 1996 22:29:07 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01775<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA08165; Tue, 12 Nov 1996 13:29:04 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 12 Nov 1996 13:29:04 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v02130500aeae8b4a38b2@[192.168.11.208]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
