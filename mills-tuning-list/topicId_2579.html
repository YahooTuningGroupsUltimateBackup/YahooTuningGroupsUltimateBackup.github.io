The issue is complicated but that is no reason to retreat to a<br>simpler, less useful definition. Your definition makes no sense, because<br>you'll never come up with an answer for irrational intervals. How do you<br>propose to "measure [the mistuning of an equal temperament] in cents<br>deviation _and_ consonance* deviation" when you can't define the<br>consonance of an irrational interval? Presumably, you want to use<br>rational approximations, but how do you decide whether to use 25/21,<br>44/37, 1785/1501, 10754/9043, or 19723/16585? You seem to like the<br>latter, but if you really go to that level of accuracy, you face a very<br>large danger that some of your so-called JI perfect fifths will turn out<br>to be closer to 30001/20001, in which case you'll have to call the<br>equal-tempered minor third more consonant that the just perfect fifth!<br><br><br>Actually, if you want to get into silly mathematical discussions, the<br>probability that two physical strings are tuned to a rational inteval is<br>zero, as Cantor showed that the cardinality of the reals is greater than<br>that of the rationals. The probability that the strings are tuned to an<br>n-tone-equal-tempered interval is also zero, since the algebraic numbers<br>have the same cardinality as the rationals (which have the same<br>cardinality as the integers).<br><br>The only definition I care about is one with a psychoacoustic<br>correlative. Otherwise we're not talking about music, we're talking<br>about abstract marks on a piece of paper or computer screen. My<br>calculation of beat rates was an attempt to show that the one<br>psychoacoustic correlate you did mention does not lead to a first-order<br>qualitative difference between 19/16 and 2^(1/4). Personally I think<br>19/16 in a high register has a peculiar stability due to its denominator<br>being octave-equivalent with the fundamental (the brain often fills in<br>the missing fundamental with a "virtual pitch" and any combination tones<br>will only be in agreement with the virtual pitch in the case of JI).<br><br>Oh, I finally saw that cream cheese commercial.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
