How much research has been done on this<br>subject<br>> matter? Is the impact of tuning and interval cultural? I have often<br>wondered,<br>> and still am wondering, what is the overall purpose of this list; that<br>is, is<br>> there anything socially functional about these endeavors or are they<br>just<br>> intellectual endeavors? I read of people doing performances using<br>non-standard<br>> tunings, and wondered what were the results they expected from the<br>audience.<br>> Besides for entertainment purposes music originally has been used as a <br>tool for<br>> focusing thought or creating synergy among a group of people with the<br>purpose of<br>> accomplishing or realizing something that can not be accomplished by<br>the<br>> individual.<br>><br>> I have a friend who is actually using the concepts of sound to as a<br>tool in drug<br>> treatment programs. He said to reprogram the mind one has to be in<br>complete<br>> control of the stimuli (the program) that enters the<br>> five senses.  Although his results are positive, the "established"<br>community<br>> suspect it since it conform to their models.<br>><br>> Sorry if I rambled but I'm rally am interested in how some of you are<br>making<br>> your understanding of this subject matter socially functional.

But I do feel that at least for the smallest<br>prime<br>numbers (say, up to 19 or possibly even only 13) and for the smallest<br>exponents of those primes (up to only 2 or 3), different feelings and<br>sounds are clearly perceptible and definable in relation to one another.<br><br>I believe that it is this idea of "prime quality", and also feelings<br>associated<br>with particular rhythmic and metrical structures, that allows "absolute<br>music" (that is, music without a text or program) to move us emotionally.<br><br><br>2)<br><br>The work we are doing at the new Sonic Arts Institute in San Diego<br>emphasizes improvising music in various non-12-equal scales<br>or with complete freedom of intonation, with the idea of letting go<br>of control of our individual egos, and allowing our ears and the<br>spirit and feeling of community which arises from our creating<br>music together to be our guide, and a willingness to go wherever<br>the music takes us.<br><br>In our short three weeks of existence, there have already been<br>some amazing voyages.  The title of Danielou's book might<br>almost be slogan for what we are experiencing.<br><br>Many people who have been attracted to our bi-weekly "Earth Chants"<br>have a particular interest in the healing powers of music or<br>sound.<br><br>Also, La Monte Young has studied much about the effects and<br>affects of many various primes (in the frequency ratios of the<br>tones in his drone-like sound installations) on the nervous<br>system.
