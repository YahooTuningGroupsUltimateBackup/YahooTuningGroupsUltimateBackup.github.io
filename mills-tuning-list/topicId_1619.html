Erv invented this <br>tuning  by solving for tempered values for the fifth and major third <br>in which the first order difference tones would be would be equal.<br>In this case, the triad is 1.0, 1.247265 and 1.4945302. By multiplying<br>these by 400 hz (for convenience), one gets the frequencies 400,<br>498.906 and 597.81207 hz (0 382.52175 and 695.63044 cents). The<br>first order difference tones between the major third and the tonic<br>and the fifth and the third are both 98.906 hz. Erv believes this<br>relationship gives this triad and its near approximations (such as<br>the Lucy-Harrison tuning) a degree of unity and consonance not shared <br>by other meantone-like tunings.<br><br>These difference tones are not submultiples of the tonic (400 hz),<br>as they would be in just intonation (400 500 600 hz, 0  386.3137 <br>and 701.955 cents). Nevertheless, Erv claims that when accurately<br>tuned the effect is perceptible, perhaps because the synchonous<br>beat rates lead to a greater sense of fusion.<br><br>While Erv used an iterative algorithm of his and Larry Hanson's own<br>devising, the MetaMeantone fifth may be computed in a more standard<br>manner. Let the tonic, mediant and dominant of the triad be 1.0 X and Y.<br>Therefore by the major third X(Y^4)/4 according to the usual relation<br>between "negative" fifths and major thirds (4 fifths up minus 2 octaves).<br>The difference town relation is X-1 Y-X (absolute pitch of the triad<br>is not important). Therefore X(Y+1)/2 and by setting this equal<br>to the first relation, one gets (Y+1)/2(Y^4)/4. This reduces to<br>Y^4-2*Y-2. At this point, I applied the Newton-Raphson method to<br>get 1.494530181 for the fifth. The major third may be obtained by<br>substituting back into the first equation.<br><br>Other "MetaTunings" may be found the same way by defining a triad in <br>terms of one cyclic interval and a difference tone relation.<br><br>There actually are two tunings in which the beat rates of the Major<br>Third and Perfect Fifth are equal. These are this tuning and 697.2784<br>cents as negative and positive beats sound the same (set the beats<br>equal or equal and opposite). The second tuning is also one in which<br>the 3 4 5 triad has equal difference tones.<br><br>To sume up, MetaMeantone sets the DT's of the P5-Tmaj and Tmaj-Tonic<br>equal and also the beat rate of the P5 and Tmaj.  697.2784 sets the DTs <br>of the 6Maj and P4-tonic (3 4 5 triad,1st inv. etc.) equal, and sets<br>the beats of the P5 equal to the Major Third (Tmaj). A third tuning,<br>696.2958 sets the beats of the P4(fourth) equal to the 6maj, but<br>the DT's are not equal for eithe the P4 and 6maj or P5 and Tmaj.<br>There is another tuning in which the P4 has the same beat rate as<br>the 6maj, but the fifth is a rather flat 692.1612 cents.The DT's<br>are unequal in this case. The conclusion is that setting the beat <br>rates of triadic intervals equal does not necessarily set the first <br>order difference tones equal as well.<br><br><br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 4 Feb 1997 03:57 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA23893; Tue, 4 Feb 1997 03:57:53 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA23912<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id SAA22812; Mon, 3 Feb 1997 18:56:18 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 3 Feb 1997 18:56:18 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.970203184459.15112A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
