I would define the limit as the largest odd<br>> number that occurs in ratios that are considered consonant. I differ with<br>> many JI advocates in that I do not think dissonances should be represented<br>> as ratios<br><br>Maybe I misunderstand your point, but how else would you represent them? <br>I notice you use ratios as you continue: <br><br>> -- in 5-limit diatonic music, a major second is a major second<br>> whether you call it 9/8 or 10/9. <br><br>You've just used ratios to distinguish two _different_ major seconds. I've<br>read these described as the large just major second and the small just<br>major second, and other names. These would be distinguished from the septimal <br>major second. These various and imprecise English-y names can be dispensed with <br>by the use of ratios.<br><br>> (Not to deny that one could create a<br>> 9-limit diatonic style in which these would be two distinct consonances --<br>> this is hinted at by the use of chords such as C-D-E-G as consonances; i.e.,<br>> 8:9:10:12.)<br><br>They are distinct consonances (or dissonances, depending on how you define the<br>consonance/dissonance threshold). Assuming this typical diatonic major scale, <br>C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1,<br>compare the chord C-D-E-G or 8:9:10:12, <br>with the chord G-A-B-D which is not 8:9:10:12.<br><br>In another example, assuming a pan-modal approach (drawing chords from multiple <br>diatonic modes on the same tonic), compare the D in the chord C-D-E-G 8:9:10:12 <br>with the D in the chord Bb-C-D-F 8:9:10:12, keeping C the same. These are two <br>different D's. The best way that I know of to distinguish them and at the same <br>time describe their ideal tuning is to use ratios. The first D is 9/8 in the key <br>of C, and the second is 10/9 in the key of C. <br><br>> The simplest equal temperament that clearly distinguishes all 9-limit<br>> intervals is 41-equal. <br><br>Each equal temperament may provide a maximum of one rational interval only.<br>41-equal contains no 9 limit intervals save 2/1. To say that it distinguishes <br>9/8 from 10/9 (and the rest of the 9-limit intervals) is to say that it contains <br>intervals which may be used to misrepresent these rational intervals by <br>approximation using a different number of 41-equal degrees for each. <br><br>By my hearing, most equal temperaments work in proportion to the extent that <br>they get close to rational intervals, thanks or curses to the ear's natural <br>attraction to rational intervals and its propensity for interpretting <br>random intervals as perversions of rational intervals--which leads me to think <br>it best use the rational intervals directly. The rest of the equal temperaments <br>work to the extent that they get away from rational intervals and give us a <br>way to hear which lets us break away from the tyranny of the gestalt of rational <br>intervals. Even this though is a reactionary way of hearing which bases itself <br>on the gestalt of the rational intervals as something to get away from.<br><br>If you are suggesting that we attach et-41 names to 9-limit intervals<br>for the sake of ease of handling and communication, while understanding<br>that the intervals are to be tuned justly, that's fine, until you want to <br>include other rational intervals. Then you run into the problem of finding <br>the next best ET whose names can be mapped over the intervals we require,<br>and renaming all the intervals we've already come to recognize using et-41<br>names. I think using ratios is the most explicit, and most extensible notation <br>available for handling rational intervals in discussions like this.<br><br>Matt Nathan<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 4 Jan 1997 09:39 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01028; Sat, 4 Jan 1997 09:41:58 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01026<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id AAA07048; Sat, 4 Jan 1997 00:41:55 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 4 Jan 1997 00:41:55 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701040339_MC1-E20-2A20@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4508 href="#4508">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;106232.3266@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/1997 12:41:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Matt Nathan wrote:<br><br>'' I think using ratios is the most explicit, and most extensible notation <br>available for handling rational intervals in discussions like this.''<br><br><br>To which I agree, but also recognize that it is often useful to mapped onto<br>ETs in order to design keyboards, notations, or to collect my pitches into<br>reasonable scales.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 4 Jan 1997 09:41 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01033; Sat, 4 Jan 1997 09:44:00 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01031<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id AAA07229; Sat, 4 Jan 1997 00:43:57 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 4 Jan 1997 00:43:57 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701040339_MC1-E20-2A21@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
