It's hard to<br>>describe, but here goes.  Let's say the individual bridges get closer to<br>>the, um, pegboard side.  The pitch goes up the scale.  But since the entire<br>>surface of the box is the sounding board, if you pluck the strings on the<br>>other side of the bridges you would get a descending series of notes.  Fine<br>>adjust both the bridge location and string tension and you can get both<br>>sides to fall within your scale of choice!<br><br>I have tried this on the only other instrument that I know of designed to<br>be played on both sides of a bridge -- the European double-bridged dulcimer<br>-- without success. There are at least two problems: first, the bridge<br>itself does not have a knife-sharp edge. However, more importantly, it is<br>impossible on the dulcimer to precisely equalize the tension on both sides<br>of the bridge. So, while it is a straight-forward matter to get a precise<br>tuning on one side, the other side will almost always be off, usually a<br>random amount up to a sixth of a tone or so -- not an insignificant<br>interval! The folk musicians I have heard play this instrument have the<br>same problem, but, unfortunately, most of them seemed oblivious to it. If<br>one has a movable bridge, one can make slight adjustments on the fly, I<br>suppose, especially if the string is tight and the bridge has little<br>friction.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
