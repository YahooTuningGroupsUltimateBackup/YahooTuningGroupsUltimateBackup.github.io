The 16s were not exaggerated.  (135:128?<br>What the heck kinda deal is that?, you may ask.  It was reached by taking the<br>perfect 5th, 3:2, of the F#.  See the Danielou site at<br>http://www.imaginet.fr/~jcloarec/danielou/ANGLAIS/index.html for an<br>enlightening explanation of a similar kind of approach.)<br><br>Someone out there may be able to tell us of a simpler method but here's how I<br>find the number of cents above the tonic for any JI ratio:<br><br>x log-base2(d/n), where n is the numerator of your JI ratio, d is the<br>denominator of same, x is the answer you seek.<br><br>In English - find the log-base2 of the inverse of the JI ratio.  Sure, just<br>get out my trusty slide-rule here, which everyone keeps by their keyboard...<br><br>I use a table in a Word Perfect for Windows doc to do the calculations for me<br>on each scale.  WP doesn't do log-base2, only base ten or natural logs, but I<br>found that multiplying any base10 log by 3986.313713865... will produce the<br>corresponding base 2 log.  Oh, goody.  So here is the line from my Formula<br>Bar for line 2 of the table, which calculates C# (or as I like to call it,<br>2b):<br><br>-3986.313713865*LOG(C2/B2)-100<br><br>B2 and C2 are the cells where the numerator and denominator, respectively,<br>are entered; on line 3 which calculates the D (I call it 2) the formula reads<br>B3 and C3, instead of B2 and C2, and subtracts 200 instead of 100, and so on<br>until the last line where you are calculating the B (I call it 7) by<br>substituting B12 and C12 and subtracting 1100.  (Line 1 contains the column<br>headings.)  Make sense?<br><br>Make an empty template like that in your word processor or spreadsheet and<br>you can use it to calculate the synth tuning tables for any JI scale you can<br>think of.  They are legion.  Put several sets of these columns side-by-side<br>in landscape mode to analyze a bunch of scales at once, and to hold several<br>related scales so you can print it out and keep it near your keyboards.  Toss<br>your slide-rule.<br><br>By the way, I've learned that using numbers instead of letters for<br>scale-degrees allows thinking in terms of various key-centers without having<br>to transpose your system in your head.  1  2b  2  3b  3  4  4#  5  6b  6  7b<br> 7 is the series I'm comfortable with for use with a 12-key-to-the-octave<br>keyboard using an octave-repeating scale.<br><br>A Q for those who work with non-repeating and/or non-octave scales - what<br>sort of nomenclature works there for identifying scale degrees?<br><br>> is there a JI tuning that is more<br>> theoretically *pure* or natural than others,...?<br><br>Gary M. answers:<br><br>> I don't think that any one just intonation<br>> tuning is necessarily more purely JI than any other.  But then again, that<br>> depends on what you mean by "pure".  As far as I can tell, "pure" has no<br>> specific definition in tuning theory<br><br>The way I look at it, there are many possible ways to arrange or develope JI<br>systems of tunings, so the question belongs the other way around - in what<br>system would any given scale be the purist JI tuning?  E.g., the Danielou<br>site I mentioned advocates a system based on 5-limit, limiting the<br>possibilities to ratios involving multiples of 2, 3, and 5.  Your original<br>question stemmed from using a system of dividing successive harmonic<br>overtones by powers of 2.  That's only a small taste of the possible systems.<br><br>Have fun.<br><br>David J.
