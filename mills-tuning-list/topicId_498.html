CD-R allows you to record your own CDs on a <br>desktop unit onto $6 discs. The recorders are currently available for <br>approximately $700 (in a couple of months all of the big names--Sony, <br>Phillips,... will be available for under $700). <br>	First let me clear up a couple of mistakes from my last post (I'm <br>a novice, so I get to make a few). I stated that my expert source (a CD <br>professional) said to avoid JVC units. He did not say that they were no <br>good, simply that in his opinion Sony seemed sturdier. Further, I stated <br>that CD-R had a conservative lifespan of 10 years, and that standard CDs <br>outlasted this. My other expert source strenuously <br>disagrees, stating that CD-R will outlast standard CD media, as the <br>aluminum is subject to oxidation from oxygen dissolved in the <br>polycarbonate, while the gold reflective surfaces of CD-R discs is not. <br>Further, she states, unless the CD-R disc is exposed to extremely bright <br>light (much brighter than sunlight) for long periods, say days or weeks, <br>the information will not likely degrade.<br>	Last night I installed the SCSI board and CDR unit in my machine, <br>a Gateway 2000 75MHz Pentium, and fired it up. The system could not <br>locate the CD-R drive, and the software supplied with the SCSI board had <br>a faulty #2 disk, so I couldn't run the diagnostic. Well, that's what you <br>get for using a DOS system. I will try to download some new software from <br>the net and get this thing up and running so I will have something a <br>little more heartening to relate next post.<br>	On a more upbeat note, Denver's Microstock festival is being <br>organized for the 19th of October, and we are presenting a day of <br>lectures and demonstrations on the 18th at the University of Colorado at <br>Denver on the Science of Sound and Music in conjunction with the <br>festival. Any microtonalists who will be in Denver October the 18th are <br>urged to contact me if they wish to present a 25 minute talk or demo.<br>John Starrett<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 18 Jun 1996 15:06 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id GAA10830; Tue, 18 Jun 1996 06:05:48 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 18 Jun 1996 06:05:48 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960618130235_71670.2576_HHB54-10@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3096 href="#3096">ðŸ”—</a>ribarbe@garlic.com (Atlas Eclipticalis)</h3><span>6/20/1996 2:48:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>said: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@CompuServe.COM><br>>Subject: Unusual Instrument Mail Order<br>><br>>   This is not tuning-related strictly speaking, but I suspect that many of you<br>>might find it interesting anyway.
