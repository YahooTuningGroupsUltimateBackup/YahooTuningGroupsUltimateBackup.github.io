At<br>>this listening, I actually liked the ET for the intro melody, and the JI<br>>for the chords.  Go figure.<br><br>As regards my MIDI files (at http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint),<br>although the results weren't what I was hoping for, I'm honored that the<br>music samples became a topic for your class!<br><br>At a bookstore earlier tonight, I ran across this big hard-cover book that<br>really got into the subject of tunings:  "Harmonic Experience", by W. A.<br>Mathieu.  Apparently it just came out this year.  I found some info on it on<br>the net at:<br><br>  http://www.vsuccess.com/unconservatory/urave/hexperience.html<br><br>I'll have to re-read a statement Mathieu made on page 67 of his book (after<br>I go back and buy the book).  The statement didn't sit well with me.  I<br>don't want to misquote it (so I will):  It was something about Helmholtz'<br>and Ellis' attempt to use just intonation to get better harmony than equal<br>temperament being proved impossible by Easley Blackwood in "The Structure of<br>Recognizable Diatonic Tunings".<br><br>Anyway, take care, and thanks again,<br><br>--Mark<br>+------------------------------------------------------+<br>| Mark Nowitzky                                        |<br>| email:  nowitzky@pacificnet.net                      |<br>| www:    http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky          |<br>|         "If you haven't visited Mark Nowitzky's home |<br>|         page recently, you haven't missed much..."   |<br>+------------------------------------------------------+<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  hajdu@uni-muenster.de<br>Subject:  Concert in Muenster, Germany<br>PostedDate:  25-09-97 17:11:10<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  25-09-97 17:10:56-25-09-97 17:10:57,25-09-97 17:10:01-25-09-97 17:10:01<br>DeliveredDate:  25-09-97 17:10:01<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C125651D.00536238; Thu, 25 Sep 1997 17:10:46 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA30841; Thu, 25 Sep 1997 17:11:10 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 25 Sep 1997 17:11:10 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA30850<br>Received: (qmail 29421 invoked from network); 25 Sep 1997 15:10:22 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 25 Sep 1997 15:10:22 -0000<br>Message-Id: <l03020900b04db505dfb6@[128.176.20.57]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
