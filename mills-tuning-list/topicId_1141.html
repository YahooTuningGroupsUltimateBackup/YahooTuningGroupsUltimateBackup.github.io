I don't know if there are serious plans to get<br>one in production or that they were just seeing how much response<br>there would be. The designers are <br><br>Siemen Terpstra<br>Nigtevechtseweg t/o 35A<br>3633 XV  Vreeland<br><br>Gert Vos<br>Nw Prinsengracht 98 IV<br>1018 VW  Amsterdam<br><br>Gjalt J. Wijmenga<br>Postbus 30<br>3633 ZT  Vreeland<br><br>If you want to be kept up to date about any developments of<br>multifunctional keyboards you can send your name and address to Gjalt.<br>And mention if you are interested in buying one if production should<br>become possible. They were also asking for which design people would<br>prefer, but I can't show them by way of a 3D holographic image in an<br>e-mail alas (yet). They must have spent weeks glueing little pieces of<br>cardboard together and the results looked pretty ingenious. All keys<br>have the same size by the way, and are hexagonal or rectangular. <br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 12 Nov 1996 10:47 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01086; Tue, 12 Nov 1996 10:47:47 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01084<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id BAA00298; Tue, 12 Nov 1996 01:47:42 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 12 Nov 1996 01:47:42 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199611120444_MC1-BE0-6346@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
