Perhaps the<br>greatest difference between the classic period sonata form and its baroque<br>binary form predecessors was the use of a development section.  Although<br>many beginning students think of the development as developing themes,<br>this, in fact, does not occur (in the sense of altering, expanding,<br>treating fugally, etc.) much in the classic period.  Instead, many<br>different keys are visited.  <br><br>I believe that the purpose of visiting the many different keys was partly<br>to 'feel out' the relative tension of the different keys.  To put it<br>simplistically, just as beginning musicians will play "Mary Had A Little<br>Lamb" in minor 'just to see how it sounds,' I believe that the development<br>section visited many different keys to see how they sounded, since they<br>did NOT sound the same.<br><br>Of course, this effect is totally lost on an equally tempered instrument.<br><br>Joe Downing,<br>Syracuse, NY<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 3 Jul 1997 23:13 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04427; Thu, 3 Jul 1997 23:13:48 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 3 Jul 1997 23:13:48 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04399<br>Received: (qmail 1214 invoked from network); 2 Jul 1997 22:01:41 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 2 Jul 1997 22:01:41 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.96.970702150407.29137C-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5747 href="#5747">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>7/4/1997 10:08:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>> <snip> The entire point of well temperaments is that they are<br>>> > about equally well in tune in all keys.<br>>...I believe that the<br>>development of sonata form in the classic period was directly related to<br>>the inequality (but acceptability) of the different keys.<br><br>   Again noting that I said, "about equally well in tune" and not<br>"identical sounding" in all keys, I'd say that that, and "inequality (but<br>acceptability) of different keys" are two different ways of saying the same<br>thing.<br><br>   The original premise of the question was that well temperaments get<br>farther out of tune as you venture farther from C Major.

In ANY of the frequently used well-tempered<br>systems, F major is the most in-tune key with C and G close seconds.  The<br>less used keys are much more out-of-tune, yet, as required by the<br>well-tempered philosophy, usable.<br><br>For a revealing exercise, look at cadences on F# major.  They nearly<br>always occur at some point where their very weakness has structural import<br>to the piece.  For example:<br><br>Prelude and Fugue in D, BWV532<br>The opening section is all in D major - fast scales - very light and<br>showy.<br>The second section of the prelude is somewhat whimsical and uses dotted<br>rhythms over a pedal F#.  It is usually played on a secondary manual (even<br>on equal-tempered performances) with a lighter registration.  This section<br>cadences on F# major.  Note that, because F# major is prettymuch on the<br>out-ofne side of the spectrum, the F# major chord is short - only an<br>eighth note long, and followed by a grand pause.  The section basically<br>'falls apart' on such a weak cadence.<br>The grand pause is followed by a two octave scale leading up to a HUGE<br>(usually full organ) chord on D Major - an incredibly bright key.  This is<br>followed by one of the most glorious Alla Breves in music - full of joy<br>and light.  Further analysis would show how very carefully Bach related<br>the keys of sections to the tension necessary.<br> <br>You could also look at the Toccata and Fugue in F - the one that begins<br>with a long canon between the hands overa sustained pedal note.  In the<br>Fugue, there are a number of deceptive cadences that bear analysis.  They<br>all proceed from very tame dominant chords (Ex. C Major) to outlandish,<br>very much more out-of-tune chords (such as Db third inversion).  This<br>makes the deception even more shocking.  <br><br>Bach used that same technique in many other pieces.  I remember two young<br>daughters (under age 10) listening to a performance of the G major "Piece<br>d'Orgue" which also has a glorious All Breve section which concludes with<br>a shocking deceptive cadence to o vii o7 of V.  Even though they had been<br>listening complacently, they both gasped audibly (to the performer's<br>delight and amusement)<br><br>Look at the Prelude in C major from Book One of WTC.  Listen to the chords<br>in any standard well-tempered system, and you will hear a rise in tension<br>over a long arc, then a release, than a larger rise which gives way to<br>final release.  (It was this piece that made a believer out of me.)<br><br>Bach was not alone in his use of the relative dissonance/consonance of<br>chords.  In the Burkhart anthology, look at the Scarlatti Sonata in E<br>Major.  It, too, has an internal cadence on F# major which is marked as a<br>short note followed by a grand pause.  he then proceeds to fanfares on<br>open fifths on F# (where we discover that it was the A# third that was<br>causing the out-of-tune F# triads - the fifths are VERY in-tune.)<br><br>Joe Downing,<br>in Syracuse<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 5 Jul 1997 08:27 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05283; Sat, 5 Jul 1997 08:28:05 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 5 Jul 1997 08:28:05 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05258<br>Received: (qmail 23961 invoked from network); 5 Jul 1997 06:28:02 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 5 Jul 1997 06:28:02 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199707050224_MC2-1A49-E3DB@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5757 href="#5757">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>7/5/1997 12:20:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>In ANY of the frequently used well-tempered<br>>systems, F major is the most in-tune key with C and G close seconds.

The<br>>less used keys are much more out-of-tune, yet, as required by the<br>>well-tempered philosophy, usable.<br><br>      This is not quite right, (IMHO), .  The Valotti temperament, following<br>the style of the Italians, does tune the F-A third as the purest third in the<br>temperament.  However,  if we look at a number of other well temperaments,<br>such as the Prinz, Young, D'Alembert, or G.F.Handel,   we find the C-E third<br>is the purest, (not always just, but usually very close). <br>   Since the  common denominator seems to be that additiional accidentals<br>bring  about about increases in the tempering of the root tonic thirds, how a<br>temperament allotted the comma was a lively topic of conversation in the 18th<br>century. Some, like the Young, begin with a slightly tempered C-E, and<br>progress in even steps all the way up to F#-A# and Gb-Bb.  This is a<br>beautiful temperament in its symmetry,plus the fact that the most highly<br>tempered thirds are exactly 1 syntonic comma wide.  This is the idealized<br>well temp. form,  according to Jorgensen. <br>      There are several temperaments by Stanhope that favor the C-E and G-B<br>equally, and  others, (Rousseau),  that favor the F-A and C-E as the closest<br>to pure polar keys,  so it seems that the C-E was the pivot point around<br>which the maximum purity was normally placed.  This makes sense as a legacy<br>of the meantone systems, as the most common meantone  systems are, I think,<br>directly aimed at producing the Just C-E first.  (A real meantone maven could<br>help us out here,  I tread thinner ice when I get to far before<br>Werckmiester). <br>      <br>      Even though the Prinz is probably my favorite,  the Young is the most<br>succesful temperament for initiating the heretofore unexposed12 tet masses<br>into key color recognition.  I find that some musicians are most impressed<br>with the added purity in the simpler keys, and others are struck by the edge<br>and brilliance that comes from the more highly tempered keys.  Some can't<br>tell the differerence, and others go nuts! A well known piano entertainer, (<br>he was entertainer of the year in the Country music world once before.......)<br>went for my explanation on the temperaments, and I tuned a very clean Young<br>on his Steinway.
