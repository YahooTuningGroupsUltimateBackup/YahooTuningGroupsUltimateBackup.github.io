Without a doubt, my<br>own experience has been that the most intriguing microtonal music uses<br>tunings built upon a fundamentally different paradigm from 12-tone.<br><br>   But again, that's certainly far from undebatable.</div><h3><a id=7379 href="#7379">ðŸ”—</a>Johnny Reinhard &#x3C;reinhard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/1998 8:22:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Mon, 6 Apr 1998, Gary Morrison wrote:<br><br>> the most intriguing microtonal music<br>> uses tunings built upon a fundamentally different paradigm from 12-tone.<br><br>I understand, I think, the excitement of working with a new constellation<br>of musical tones.  Getting away from conventional relationships in sound<br>is clearly exciting on many levels.  It's pioneering, it's mind expanding,<br>it's aesthetically thrilling, and it's increasingly popular.<br><br>However, to separate microtonal music from music proper is, I think, a<br>mistake.  12ET is only a cultural norm.  It is not divine by definition.<br>To overreact in the opposite direction of our cultural norm is not a<br>requirement to work with microtonal intervals.  There are all sorts of<br>useage allowable in music proper.  <br><br>Pigeonholing by systems seems myopic to me in view of the many different<br>tuning cultural norms available in the world.  The tabula rasa seems the<br>best canvas for musical sound, especially as it is being mapped in the<br>last decades of the 20th Century.<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>reinhard@idt.net</div>
