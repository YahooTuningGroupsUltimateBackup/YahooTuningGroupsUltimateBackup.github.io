Anyone here<br>> have an answer?<br>><br>> =============================================================<br>> Dear Friends,<br>> Hope all is harmoniously resonant with you down there in JI land. I am in<br>> need of some help and perhaps I have come to the right place. I recently<br>> purchased an MR Rack from Ensoniq and found out that the Unisyn software<br>> that comes with it does not work for tuning the one RAM slot user tuning. I<br>> understand now from Ensoniq that I need to get a shareware program that<br>> sends MIDI standard tuning changes over Sysex. The program may be called<br>> tuning wrench or MIDI wrench. Can you shed any light on this? Would like to<br>> hear from you, if so.<br>> Best wishes,<br>> Terry Riley<br>></div>
