I personally don't know much about the features<br>>> of either.<br>><br>>Can someone please give more information on these?<br><br>I've done some work with the Pitch Palette, what would you like to know?<br>It's a windows program that sends sysex re-tuning messages to compatible<br>synths, including ones by emu, ensoniq, and roland.  It has a ratio-based<br>scale editor, and a calculator utility for converting between fractions,<br>cents, and hertz.  It has a primitive sequencer that allows you to add scale<br>and key changes to midi files.<br><br>It even has a live performance mode that can make key changes automatically<br>if you stick to block chords in root position.  The Justonic people brag<br>about this feature, but it's really very limited.  Much better is to send<br>key changes from the lowest octave of your keyboard or from midi foot<br>pedals, which the Pitch Palette also supports.  I haven't done any work with<br>the live performance mode yet; so far I've used it only for midi sequencing.<br><br>My problem was, as seems to be the bugaboo of the tuning-table method, TIME.<br>The tuning dumps take too long.  Unless you're very very careful, and even<br>if you are, your music will stutter and bark at every key change.  At least,<br>this is the problem I had with the Proteus/2.<br><br>To avoid this, I used the roland Virtual Sound Canvas, a software synth that<br>comes bundled with the Pitch Palette.  Because it is "virtual", it can do<br>sysex retuning much more quickly.  It doesn't sound like the proteus, but I<br>never liked proteus sounds anyway.  To sample my work, and for more<br>information on the Justonic software, you can visit my music page at...<br><br>http://users.nni.com/source_of_goodness/ericarl.html<br><br>My teacher, Denny Genovese, has written an excellent DOS program called MMT.<br>It uses the pitch-bend method, cycling thru 8 midi channels for polyphony.<br>I believe that with 95% of synths, the pitch-bend method is much faster and<br>more flexible than the sysex method, if at the cost of maximum polyphony.<br>95% isn't really fair in this context, however, since a large number of<br>synths don't even support sysex microtuning.<br><br>>>    Assuming that that's what you're asking about, there has been a bit of<br>>> discussion about how to use pitch bend for microtonality.  The tricky part<br>>> clearly is how to synchronize it with note-ons under very legato playing.<br>>> Since the either the pitch-bend message must precede the note-on or the<br>>> reverse, you're going to have a "blurp" in pitch either at the attack of<br>>> the current note or at the release of the previous note.<br>><br>>MIDI transmits 3125 instructions per second.  A pitch bend is 3<br>>instructions.  To send 16 of these takes 3*16/3125*1000=15.36 ms,<br>>or twice as much if you include the note-ons as well.  Is this<br>>really a problem?<br><br>Not in my experience.  I have used MMT with two Yamaha TX81Z's, the Proteus,<br>and a Kawai K5m, and I have yet to hear a "blurp" from any style of playing<br>whatever.  MMT can't play midi files, but it does accept live midi data,<br>and, if one is bent on playing midi files, a second computer can be used.<br>Denny is looking to develope MMT further, and would appreciate any input in<br>that regard.<br><br>Before I close this message, I would like to make it clear that I am not an<br>advocate of the pitch-bend method.  Or of the tuning-table method.  Any<br>pitch-bend favoritism detected in this letter may be considered fair defense<br>against those who seem to pick on it without considering cons of sysex or<br>the work of artists like Denny and Jules Siegel, who use it to great effect.<br><br>What I do believe, quite frankly, is that both of these methods suck.  I<br>don't think that any of us really believe otherwise --  it's all too easy to<br>let which method is better and why obscure the fact that we're being handing<br>our hats when it comes to a microtuning solution for midi.  Now, I'm told<br>that the Symbolic Systems Kyma setup is just about as good as can be, but<br>I've never seen one.  Has anyone seen one?  Justonic is working on a synth<br>designed for microtuning called the "Tone Palette".  They claim it is<br>several orders of magnitude quicker and higher-res than anything else.<br>They've got a prototype, but are having problems getting to production.<br>Find out more in the bowels of their site at www.justonic.com.<br><br>Carl<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu<br>Subject:  Re: 1/1 article<br>PostedDate:  21-09-97 19:55:28<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  21-09-97 19:55:18-21-09-97 19:55:18,21-09-97 19:54:27-21-09-97 19:54:27<br>DeliveredDate:  21-09-97 19:54:27<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256519.00626EC3; Sun, 21 Sep 1997 19:55:08 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03199; Sun, 21 Sep 1997 19:55:28 +0200<br>Date: Sun, 21 Sep 1997 19:55:28 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03197<br>Received: (qmail 11638 invoked from network); 21 Sep 1997 17:55:15 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 21 Sep 1997 17:55:15 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01510101b04aa6f1fe4c@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
