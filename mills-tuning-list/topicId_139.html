Now I got hold of Kellner's original work<br>and found that his numbers are slightly different.<br><br>Deviation from Equal temperament:<br><br>       Kellner       wabi<br><br>A        0.0          0.0<br>B        4.3          4.189   <br>H       -0.7         -0.888        <br>C        8.2          8.099<br>Cis     -1.6         -1.676<br>D        2.8          2.830<br>Es       2.3          2.234  <br>E       -2.7         -2.843<br>F        6.2          6.144<br>Fis     -3.5         -3.631<br>G        5.5          5.470<br>As       0.4          0.279<br>A        0.0          0.0<br><br>The numbers differ more than 1/10 cent and I have to <br>recalculate them. Consider the possibility that I did<br>a mistake. Or it is due to rounding errors.<br><br>My impression is, that Kellner's work is not widely known.<br>Otherwise it could not happen that some people still think,<br>Bach was mean tuned. Absolutely impossible.<br>Some think, Bach was equal tuned. He might have known ET.<br>But could he possibly tune it in 15 minutes, as some say?<br>Can you? Can anybody? Bach's tuning can be laid quickly,<br>easily and very precisely. (Kellner's words).<br>ET came with the advent of the piano, and is suited for it,<br>which has less overtones than a harpsichord.<br><br>Anyway, the main arguments are of a quite different nature.<br>Bach was an eminent mathematician and numerologist. <br>Kellner is mathematician and physicist, built several<br>harpsichords on his own, received a patent on his Bach tuning,<br>and analyzed the codes in Bach's music. This had been done before,<br>but proving that the tuning scheme for the WTC is modeled into the<br>structure of the music, that's where the evidence comes from,<br>has to be credited to Mr. Kellner. <br><br>The most astonishing discovery, at least to me, is something<br>quite unexpected, unbelievable surprise:<br>Bach himself has coded his tuning scheme into his signet!<br>The seven pure fifths, the five tempered fifths, the <br>"three-unitarian" tempering are hidden in that graphical emblem.<br><br>Luckily, the small introductory booklet "Wie stimme ich selbst <br>mein Cembalo?" is available in three languages, German, English<br>and French. It costs about 30 $, give or take some. <br><br>Schriftenreihe Das Musikinstrument<br>Heft 19<br>Dritte, erweiterte Auflage<br>ISBN 3-923639-68-6<br>Verlag Erwin Bochinsky Gmbh&Co. KG<br>Frankfurt am Main<br>Germany<br><br>If we don't read contemporary publications, we are going <br>to miss a lot. Can you suggest some further reading on this topic?<br>Please post it, if it is rather new and modern.<br>As for me, there is no question how to play Bach and<br>especially the WTC. The Kellner Bach Tuning<br>may be inappropriate for other music, but it is worth a try.<br><br>My digital piano has 6 temperaments, but the new types have <br>microtuning capabilities. They can be programmed for any tuning.<br>Electronic tuners with microtuning are also available.<br>So, thanks to the Japanese, and Mr. Kellner et al, we can get the <br>original sound of Bach's music into our living rooms. <br>Midi files of the WTC are on midi archives in the Internet.<br>I like listening to midi music, because it is free of "interpretation",<br>which does not interest me.<br><br>Yours<br>Helmut Wabnig<br>wabi@net4you.co.at<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 2 Nov 1995 07:09 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA07196; Wed, 1 Nov 1995 21:09:49 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 1 Nov 1995 21:09:49 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199511020508.QAA14303@anugpo.anu.edu.au><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2236 href="#2236">ðŸ”—</a>Timothy Tikker and Julia Harlow &#x3C;tjt@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/1995 10:23:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Thu, 2 Nov 1995, Manuel Op de Coul wrote:<br><br>> One third, C-E is very close to pure.
