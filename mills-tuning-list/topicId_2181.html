Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com><br><br>Graham, I am puzzled by your statement that these two four note chords<br>are complete chords of a nature which would seem to require them to be<br>six-note chords. Somehow, you hid two notes under your sleeve. Therefore<br>I will reserve judgment on your analysis until you clarify.<br><br>The reason these chords (12:15:18:20 and 14:18:21:24, call them 3:5:9:15<br>and 3:7:9:21 by octave equivalence)) are so interesting is that they are<br>9-limit chords but are not subsets of either the 9-otonality or the<br>9-utonality. I'm not sure if this finding directly contradicts anything<br>Partch said, but it seems to differ from the usual Partchian thinking<br>that for any odd limit, the corresponding otonal and utonal chords are<br>the basic harmonic units.<br><br>What are we to make of them? I think the best approach is to follow a<br>suggestion made by Dan Wolf some time ago, which is to construct a<br>lattice where 9 has its own axis and 3*3 will appear in a different<br>place than 9. At first I did not like this idea because I thought every<br>note should appear in only one place in the lattice, and although I saw<br>the case where 3*3 and 9 might be represented differently in a<br>temperament, such a temperament would not be consistent within the<br>9-limit so I didn't see the point of trying to analyze it with a 9- (or<br>higher) limit lattice. But these chords have convinced me that even in<br>JI, there is a good reason to have 9 distinct from 3*3.<br><br>If all the factors allowed in a consonant ratio are prime, then the<br>triangular lattice with prime axes works nicely. The smallest line<br>segments are the consonant intervals. For the 5-limit, the saturated<br>consonant chords (major and minor triads) are represented by the<br>smallest triangles, and are the supersets of all entities where every<br>note is direcly connected to every other note. In the 7-limit, the<br>saturated consonant chords (7-o and 7-u) are represented by the smallest<br>tetrahedra (and Wilson hexanies are represented by the smallest<br>octahedra . . .). If we want to continue to the 9-limit, 9-o and 9-u and<br>their subsets certainly appear to be the only structures where every<br>note is connected to every other note, but that ignores the equality of<br>3*3 and 9.<br><br>Taking this equality into account, the most obvious consequence is a<br>consonant interval which appears as two different unit segments in the<br>lattice: 3:1 appears as both 3:1 and 9:3. There are two ways of<br>adjoining these segments so that the intervals cancel each other out.<br>Therefore there are two structures in the lattice which appear to be<br>dissonant triads but are in fact consonant dyads. Let us choose one of<br>these structures, namely 9:3:3*3; looking at the other, 9:9*3:3*3, will<br>simply lead to inverses of whatever we find using the first.<br><br>Now to take advantage of the structure we need to find a note that is<br>connected (by a unit segment) to 9 but not to 3*3, and another note that<br>is connected to 3*3 but not to 9. In order for the resulting chord to be<br>consonant, the notes must be consonant with each other as well as with<br>3. This seems like a tall order, but either (5, 5*3) or (7, 7*3) are<br>clearly found using the lattice. Thus we get the the two chords above.<br>We promised to look at the inverses, but these chords are their own<br>inverses, so nothing new is gained. Since 5 is not connected to 7*3 and<br>3 is not connected to 7*5, nothing with more than 4 notes will be<br>directly connected each to all others and exploit 3*3<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 1 Jul 1997 14:03 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04783; Tue, 1 Jul 1997 14:03:34 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 1 Jul 1997 14:03:34 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04784<br>Received: (qmail 9272 invoked from network); 1 Jul 1997 12:02:57 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 1 Jul 1997 12:02:57 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199707011213.IAA04860@ne02.northeast.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5726 href="#5726">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>7/1/1997 9:11:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>In my efforts to un-subscribe from THIS list, I have sent (without result)<br>>the following FOUR messages to listproc@eartha.mills.edu<br>>UNSUBSCRIBE<br>>UNSUBSCRIBE tuning<br>>UNSUBSCRIBE *<br>>UNSUBSCRIBE ALL<br><br>   Interesting...
