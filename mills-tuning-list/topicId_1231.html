I think that this was an extreme problem for<br>medieval music theory, applying Greek ideas - especially octave species -<br>to a repertoire (chant) with a basis in Jewish cantillation. The practical<br>instructions found in the treatises, particularly for singing with the aid<br>of hexachords, are more useful. As Paul Hahn points out, the hexachord is<br>the maximum Pythagorean structure without an augmented 4th/diminished 5th,<br>and as such, can be used to control the placement of this interval while<br>guiding decisions about ficta. Both chant and early polyphony are - for us<br>- uncomfortably inconsistant when interpreted in terms of tonicity, so that<br>the identification of a single octave species for a given piece is<br>difficult, and probably tells us little about the structure of the piece.<br>As scalar theorists, we too often forget that most music is vocal and<br>unaccompanied, so that a fixed scale is an unnecessary precondition to<br>composition or performance. That a melody composed from phrases lying with<br>the compass of a pythagorean hexachord, and whose hexachords interlock at<br>fourth and fifth intervals, will tend to produce a gamut with 7 tones is<br>logical, but the appearance of particular 7-tone scales must be kept in the<br>category of consequence and not cause. Moreover, the frequency of melodies<br>in the repertoire with fewer than seven tones - and the existence of<br>repertoire with more eight or more tones is a reminder that seven has no<br>particular monopoly. What is, however, clear is that 5 or 7 or 12 (...)<br>tones exhibit the _closing interval_ (in 7, the tritone, in 12 , the wolf)<br>feature of MOS scales. What may be interesting is to devise hexachord-like<br>solfegio systems for higher-number MOS*s, in which the closing interval is<br>avoided through transposition of the solfege unit.<br><br>I am curious to learn from Heinz Bohlen how his infill of the Major triad<br>differs from that of Heinrich Schenker.   <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 23 Nov 1996 05:09 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04876; Sat, 23 Nov 1996 05:11:11 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04859<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id UAA09117; Fri, 22 Nov 1996 20:11:08 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 22 Nov 1996 20:11:08 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961123040907_71670.2576_HHB27-10@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
