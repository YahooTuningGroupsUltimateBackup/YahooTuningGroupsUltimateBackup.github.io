When I have a spare moment (whatever one of those<br>is!), I'll try that suggestion for the diatonic harmonica.<br><br>Regarding my query about the chromatic, the meantone tunings I tried were<br>not just the regular 1/4 comma thing. I just tried any temperament that made<br>the major thirds a little smoother than 12TET. Some of the nicest thirds<br>were produced my tuning each octave slightly flatter than the last, but this<br>goes against my usual practise of stretching by a couple of cents per<br>octave. Made the top end of the instrument sound horribly flat, anyway.<br>Because the hca. produces strong differential tones, there are some<br>fundamental problems with the draw chord. If you tune the D-F interval<br>justly, it produces a Bb differential tone (and towards the top of the hca.<br>this tone is almost as strong as the normal tones of the reeds) which<br>clashes with the A and B in the draw chord. A Pythagorean m3rd solved that<br>problem, but then gave a horrible Pythag M3rd F-A When the chromatic is used<br>as a monophonic instrument, this is not a problem, but with chords and<br>doublestops (favoured by many traditional-style players)... well I'm sure<br>you've heard people squawking on an equal-tuned harp! I suppose my original<br>question boils down to "What's the best tuning for the minor sixth chord: 1,<br>m3, 5, 6?"<br><br>Many thanks for all the welcome messages. A lot of the list does go over my<br>head (at my current stage of learning, anyway), but much of it is both<br>fascinating and useful. I recently retuned a diatonic harp to the septimal<br>scale suggsted by Gary Morrison - got some very strange looks when I played<br>it at a local club, but certain things about it are worth further<br>investigation. <br><br>I didn't exacly expect the list to be flooded with hca players and<br>technicians, but I have to say that it makes an excellent tool for exploring<br>altered tunings (it was working on the harmonica that first caused me to hit<br>my local library and devour all their Helmholtz, Partch, etc.), having many<br>of the plus points of the harmonium and concertina (favoured by many<br>researchers), all at an affordable price. And like Neil Haverstick (digest<br>774) I find the blues (which comes so naturally to the hca, despite being<br>originally designed for polkas, etc.) to be an ideal medium for inflicting<br>altered tuning upon an unsuspecting public!<br><br>Finally, another quest - to say me a lot of counting on fingers and toes,<br>does anyone out there know of a program for converting ratios to cents?<br><br><br><br>Pat Missin.<br><br>"...my music's a lot better than it sounds!"
