Actually, I'm slightly rephrasing it here.  <br><br>   I absolutely agree with you that QC meantone is very clearly audible as<br>distinct from 12TET.  I found that it was more clearly recognizable than 12TET<br>as a byproduct of my assessment of whether LucyTuning had clearly audible<br>meaning to it.  <br><br>   But my point earlier was that there's different, and then there's DIFFERENT.<br><br><br>   Let's suppose that at 9AM tomorrow morning, a Baltimore radio station were to<br>play, say a short set of Bach Sinfonia, in quarter-comma meantone.  I suspect<br>that something on the order of a quarter of the listening audience (many of whom<br>are fighting traffic on the way to work) would hear it and notice that something<br>is curiously unusual about it.  <br><br>   Now let's suppose that, at that exact same time a Richmond radio station were<br>to play that same set of Sinfonia with all major thirds tuned down to 16:13, all<br>minor thirds at 7:6, minor sevenths tuned down to 7:4, and tritones tuned to<br>10:7.  I suspect that most of the Baltimore listeners won't hear the unusual<br>nature of the meantone performance over the gut-wrenching screams echoing from<br>50 miles away in Richmond!  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 5 Mar 1996 14:23 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id FAA09989; Tue, 5 Mar 1996 05:23:20 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 5 Mar 1996 05:23:20 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9603050809.A22024-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
