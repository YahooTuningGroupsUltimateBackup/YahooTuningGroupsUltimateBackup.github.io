It is mostly addressed to the folks mentioned in the message, but<br>I'll go ahead and send it to the entire list, since I don't think I have<br>each of you folks' Email addresses individually, and since the rest of you<br>will probably be interested to hear of the progress and availability of the<br>CD.<br><br>   Neil has sent CDs to Rick Sanford, Stephen James Taylor, and Carter<br>Scholz (actually, it turns out that they'll actually be shipped this<br>up-coming Monday).  He has received shipping costs from John Loffink and<br>Bill Alves, and he'll begin the process of painstankingly assembling the<br>suckers one by one for them this weekend.  (I suggested that he leave that<br>task to each of us contributors, but it seems that Neil's just too nice a<br>guy for that!)<br><br>   So CDs will very soon be available from those tuners!  So place your<br>orders with your favorite of these tuning-listers, or with Warren Burt,<br>Bill Sethares, Denny Genovese, Ernie Crews, or me.  Warren, Bill, Denny,<br>and Ernie will have their copies as soon as they send Neil the shipping<br>money, and Neil has a chance to assemble them.  (I have available now.)<br><br>   The CD turned out quite well, as you've heard Neil, John Starrett, and I<br>comment.</div>
