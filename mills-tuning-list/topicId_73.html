Ivor Darreg was always aware, and quite frankly<br>afraid, that he was pressed for time.  He always realized that he would die<br>before he could finish the work he wanted to accomplish in unusual musical<br>tunings.  <br><br>   He therefore shunned getting too carried away in the mechanics of notation<br>systems, the time required to write down music, formally researching chord<br>progressions, interpreting effects of these new constructs on typical notions of<br>counterpoint, and such endeavors.  He instead concentrated upon getting a quick<br>feel for a tuning, and then improvising in it to get the music out fast.<br><br>   I always admired Ivor's drive, and his ability to improvise wonderful music<br>with very little prior experimentation.  Still, there are also risks in pure<br>improvisation.  As Wendy Carlos pointed out in "Secrets of Synthesis", many<br>orchestrational devices that have exciting effects, are almost impossible to<br>improvise.  Also, even among highly skilled improvisationalists, improvised<br>music can often have very fuzzy meaning at the top level - where did we start<br>and where did we go over the course of the composition?  <br><br>   So when Marion points out to me the fact that I've posted a lot of theory and<br>ideas about 88CET here, he has (unwittingly of course) evoked Ivor's ghost to<br>remind me that preparation alone doesn't make music.  Of course, what's not<br>obvious in these postings is that I have in fact produced a fair amount of music<br>in 88CET thus far - about half a CD's worth.  So it's certainly not a case of<br>Ivor's "silent writing on paper".  <br><br>   What do you folks think about the relative importance of understanding,<br>systematizing, and experimenting with a tuning, compared to that of simply<br>diving in headlong and just seeing where improvisation takes you?  I've been<br>wrestling with that question a bit, and have concluded that it's pretty much the<br>trade-off we know it is:  Both are important, and the balance between the two is<br>finer-detailed than mere rules of thumb and maxims can get you.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 8 Oct 1995 22:54 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id NAA00043; Sun, 8 Oct 1995 13:54:33 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 8 Oct 1995 13:54:33 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199510082053.NAA17901@osiris.ac.hmc.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
