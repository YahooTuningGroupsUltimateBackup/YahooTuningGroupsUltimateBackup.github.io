My impression is that meantone tuning was being used on<br>organs all over Western Europe much later than it was being regularly<br>recommended for harpsichords. Silbermann tuned in meantone (in Germany) --<br>Ja. S. Bach made a joke out of it: every time he sat down at a Silbermann<br>organ he would play a piece in A-flat major, where the 'wolf' would howl<br>until Silbermann was driven from the church.<br><br>Judith Conrad, Clavichord Player (jconrad@sunspot.tiac.net)<br>Director of Fall River Fipple Fluters<br>Church Musician at First Congregational Church, Bristol, R.
