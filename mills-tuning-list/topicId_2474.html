Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com><br>>To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu (Tuning List)<br>>Subject: Comma Pop? I think not... and more!<br>>Message-ID: <3.0.2.32.19971005021214.006b327c@adnc.com><br>><br>>Tunisti,<br>><br>>In a recent exchange here, entitled "Pop In Microtones", I had a bit of a<br>>disagreement with Maestro J. Reinhard's somewhat enthusiastic overview of<br>>the world. Please be assured, as Johnny and I have 'taken it outside' more<br>>than once that it's all on a contextual level, with no (none!) enmity.<br>>Onward...<br>><br>>Perhaps the greatest mistake is the confusion between "microtonal music"<br>>and "music containing microtones". At least I believe this to be the crux<br>>of the problem. I would propose that a music *fundamentally* based on some<br>>sort of microtonal architecture, in any form, would constitute a piece of<br>>"microtonal music". This, therefore, excludes musics that *happen to have*<br>>microtones produced as a side effect, as an addition or coloration or<br>>ornamentation, or an accident. I believe this to be a very important<br>>distinction, and the one on which I base the premise that we are very, very<br>>far, indeed, from a world of microtonal pop music.<br>><br>>After all, if the second schema was the yardstick, then most every<br>>orchestral concert I've been involved in has been microtonal, at least in<br>>the general vicinity of the back stands of the second violins...<br>><br>>Johnny had a very telling remark, in response to some of my questions about<br>>globalization vs. Kenny G, and his ilk:<br>><br>> "The important thing here -- at least to me -- is that there is a<br>> soup of interval useage out there in the real world of music, and<br>> that includes pop."<br>><br>>Which only heightens the contrast between the two premises: is it<br>>microtonal music just because it has a few out-of-tune/in-tune notes? I<br>>don't believe it is.<br>><br>>So then Johnny, after a shotgun attempt at supplying information to back up<br>>his claims, tended to reinforce my main point, which was only to keep<br>>everyone from overheating with joy that the Microtonal Millenium had<br>>arrived! The facts still exist:<br>><br>>1. Whitney Houston is not a microtonal pop artist.<br>><br>>2. In spite of any analysis, Pink Floyd could not realistically by<br>>considered as composers/performers of microtonal pop -- because adjusting<br>>3rds just doesn't overcome the inheirently 12TET underpinnings of the other<br>>99% of the work.<br>><br>>3. Having microtonal (or microtonally sympathetic) personnel at *some* of<br>>the stations or print outlets does not constitute mainstream. For heaven's<br>>sake, NPR? Mainstream? In Jesse Helm's dreams...<br>><br>>The other rationalizations were also similarly weak. I didn't realize that<br>>the Grateful Dead listened to Ive's 4th before each concert for a year, but<br>>then I wouldn't ask Gerry Garcia to be my pharmacist based on his other<br>>interests at the time, either. Not to mention that anyone hoping to peg<br>>Aaron Copland as a microtonal composer (scattered experimentation<br>>notwithstanding) is on shaky ground indeed; like he was a great serialist,<br>>too, huh? Nope. Pretty traditional guy, by just about anyone's standards.<br>><br>>I hope no one took my thoughts on San Diego's microtonal 'scene' in a<br>>mean-spirited way, I just wanted to make clear that (since we are speaking<br>>of the present) that it is about as nowhere as most anywhere these days.<br>>Past history is just that, and no personal slights were intended. Believe<br>>me: there may be folks living here that know about it, but nobody doin' it.<br>><br>>HOWEVER, JR and I do have one potential common ground with rap. In its<br>>infancy, with a reliance solely on vocals and rhythm, there was a freedom<br>>from rigid harmelodic dogma that hadn't been seen in a great while. The<br>>setting of words that mean a great deal to ordinary people, set<br>>intervalicly (sp?) more closely to 'real' speech than any piano can<br>>produce, certainly warmed my heart -- and I'm sure Partch would love it<br>>too, harkening back to his earliest days of text settings in monophonic<br>>arrangements (though Harry would have abhorred the violence and brutality).<br>>Even though the scents of other musical styles are seeping back in, there<br>>seems to be *much* more fluidity, harmonically and melodically, in the<br>>vocals of these artists than most any other pop. Of course, that's all been<br>>co-opted as it became fodder for Sprite commercials, etc. Damn.<br>><br>>Well, anyhow, that's one evenings ruminations. I figure I'm quiet enough on<br>>the list that I can spew a little occasionally. I like to keep things in<br>>perspective, yep...<br>><br>>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>><br>>Hey, on a completely different note(s), if you haven't stopped by Corporeal<br>>Meadows recently, please do (see the .sig). In the last couple of months<br>>I've added a few new bits, including a reproduction of a brochure on<br>>Partch's instruments that he included with the Gate 5 recordings, only (on<br>>the web site) you can hear the instruments demonstrated.<br>><br>>Also, Philip Blackburn continues to bring out more material in the<br>>Innova/Enclosures project, and we're probably just weeks away from the<br>>first volumes of the CRI Partch Collection.<br>><br>>Besides, I never get any complaints about my site. I must have gotten<br>>*someone* pissed off here!  ;)<br>><br>>I'm going to bed now.
