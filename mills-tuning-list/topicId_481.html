Also how can I get a copy of Darreg's collection? I can't <br>get enough of my Blackwood CD, but variety would be nice! I'm looking <br>forward to the re-release of Beauty in the Beast.<br><br>P.S. After constant exposure to Blackwood's CD, I am left with the <br>impression that melodic acceptability is more important than harmonic <br>acceptability. The diatonic scales in 19 and 17 are equally acceptable to my <br>ears, though possessing very different characters. The level of harmonic <br>tension is very high in 17 and very low in 19 (except for dominant seventh <br>chords), but that does not seem to affect the melodic beauty. The diatonic <br>passages in his 15- and 22- note pieces have failed to capture my interest <br> -- they just sound out-of-tune, despite the good triads and dominant <br>sevenths. Blackwood himself comments on the unsettling effect of a <br>succession of two different-sized whole tones in his PNM article. Where the <br>purity of the 19-note triads comes naturally as a result of the scale, the <br>same quality in 22 has a slimy effect: the impression is that the individual <br>voices sacrifice their integrity in order to blend.  Additionally, the <br>dominant-to-tonic progression is unsettling in 22 -- perhaps this is because <br>the dominant seventh is so pure, it does not want to resolve (an analogous <br>situation would be a triad progressing to an open fifth in 19tet). I greatly <br>enjoy the 14-note piece, particularly the pentatonic scales based on 7tet, <br>which sound effective whether harmonized in consonant perfect fourths or in <br>dissonant neutral thirds. I even like the 16-note piece, where I think the <br>fact that the main scale has only two step-sizes is a big plus for <br>projecting the melody. However, I don't like the 21-note piece, which sounds <br>like a lousy performance of a lousy baroque suite. The unique modulational <br>possibilities of 21tet are intellectually interesting but do nothing for me <br>musically. I think pentatonic scales based on 7tet would be the way to go in <br>21tet, where chromatic passages would be based on groups of 3 notes.<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 13 Jun 1996 22:30 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id NAA25873; Thu, 13 Jun 1996 13:30:29 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 13 Jun 1996 13:30:29 -0700<br>Message-Id: <40960613202904/0005695065PK1EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
