Like - the Yam TG33 : nice unit, but<br>> I've never seen one other that the one we put in up at <br>> SUNY.<br>> <br>This is the kind of information that companies try to keep from their<br>competitors.  Julian Colbeck lists sales figures for most popular models in<br>the Keyfax Omnibus Edition.  The TG33 obviously did not make the grade. <br>Since the more common TX802 had sales of 5000 units, I'd expect 1000-2000<br>for the TG33.  I have seen TG33s for sale on the used market, so they're<br>out there. Generally modules sell less units than keyboards with the<br>exception of the Roland Sound Canvas series.<br><br>A better source for current information is Music and Sound Retailer, though<br>they don't give exact numbers.  The best selling series in recent history<br>has been the Roland XP-50 and its derivatives.  This can be an important<br>consideration when looking for an instrument that will be well supported<br>with third party sounds, editor/librarians, etc.<br><br>John Loffink<br>jloffink@pdq.net</div>
