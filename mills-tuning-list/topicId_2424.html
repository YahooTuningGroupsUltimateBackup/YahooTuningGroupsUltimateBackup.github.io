It has travelled with me from NJ to Texas, Berkeley, etc.<br>and Daniel Wolf edited and published issues 9-13. Some issues of<br>Darreg's Xenharmonic Bulletin were included in the early<br>issues of XH as were some other articles by him as well.<br><br>Interval was published by Jonathan Glasier in San Diego and<br>Ivor was on the board. Glasier now runs the Sonic Arts Gallery<br>with his wife Elizabeth, though reportedly, the space is now partly<br>devoted to antiques and objects other than musical instruments.<br><br>The Sonic Arts Gallery has also been a venue for microtonal performances,<br>though not recently due to the absence of Brian McLaren. While<br>microtones sometimes may be heard at the Center for World Music, UCSD,<br>the Spruce Street Forum, etc., the SG has been the only space dedicated<br>to contemporary microtonality in San Diego. Alas, it's not been very<br>active recently and the Partch Instruments have been moved from San<br>Diego State University (SDSU) to Purchase, NY.<br><br>As Jon mentioned, microtonal activities are at a pretty low ebb in<br>SD.<br><br>--John<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Fred_Kohler@bc.sympatico.ca<br>Subject:  Re: TUNING digest 1186<br>PostedDate:  23-09-97 18:59:50<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  23-09-97 18:59:30-23-09-97 18:59:31,23-09-97 18:58:37-23-09-97 18:58:37<br>DeliveredDate:  23-09-97 18:58:37<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C125651B.005D559E; Tue, 23 Sep 1997 18:59:27 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12471; Tue, 23 Sep 1997 18:59:50 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 23 Sep 1997 18:59:50 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12475<br>Received: (qmail 20112 invoked from network); 23 Sep 1997 16:59:33 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 23 Sep 1997 16:59:33 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199709231650.JAA00507@zorro.bctel.ca><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6148 href="#6148">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/1997 8:06:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>John: Got it, many thanks!<br><br>--John<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  jloffink@pdq.net<br>Subject:  Re: Kurzweil update rate, MIDI Tuning Dump Standard<br>PostedDate:  25-09-97 17:07:22<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  25-09-97 17:07:02-25-09-97 17:07:02,25-09-97 17:06:06-25-09-97 17:06:06<br>DeliveredDate:  25-09-97 17:06:06<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C125651D.005308DC; Thu, 25 Sep 1997 17:06:57 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA30790; Thu, 25 Sep 1997 17:07:22 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 25 Sep 1997 17:07:22 +0200<br>Message-Id: <9709251507.AA30790@ns.ezh.nl><br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA30835<br>Received: (qmail 28466 invoked from network); 25 Sep 1997 15:06:36 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 25 Sep 1997 15:06:36 -0000<br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
