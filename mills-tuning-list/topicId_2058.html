The craft of composition<br>>is deep and challenging, and is a subject that many folks have not done a<br>>whole lot with. Simplicity is fine, but simple music does not necessarily<br>>mean cliched or unimaginative. Again, that is my main complaint about a<br>>lot of "just" music...it sounds like the composer is more fascinated with<br>>the purity of the tuning, rather than the final result of the<br>>composition.<br><br>   <Applause>  Thank you, Neil!<br><br>   I've seen this in a lot of xenharmonic music as well.  I have also seen,<br>in my own writing as well as some others, the opposite when it comes to<br>simplicity:  A composition that's made complex by carefully preplanned<br>structuring or formal ideas that seem clever on paper, but don't prove to<br>be even audible (or just simply "don't work") when performed into real<br>music.<br><br>   I think that the most important task to start with in xenharmonic<br>composition is to figure out what general sorts of music a given tuning is<br>most appropriate for, and then write to that idiom.  If you don't do that,<br>then your audience will face two questions:<br>1.  Why doesn't this music sound right?<br>2.  What was the point in using an unusual tuning here?<br>If you match the tuning to the style, both of those problems are<br>automatically solved.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 18 May 1997 05:16 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04833; Sun, 18 May 1997 05:16:37 +0200<br>Date: Sun, 18 May 1997 05:16:37 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04826<br>Received: (qmail 858 invoked from network); 18 May 1997 03:16:33 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 18 May 1997 03:16:33 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541105afa3d233127d@[207.207.3.140]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
