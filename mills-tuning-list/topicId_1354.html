The fact is, the name was chosen because of a<br>perceived resemblance of certain intervals to the howling of wolves. As<br>wolves' calls do have a distinctive steady beating, and are often<br>dichordal, this is not an unreasonable metaphor.  Any qualitative judgement<br>about this sound is a function of time and place, and we are now - given<br>our modern, urbanized reverence for animals - free to admire both sounds,<br>and recognize certain similarities, much as listeners in the past<br>apparently found both sounds disagreeable, while recognizing similarities.<br>Your regular ( -s) ending for a synechdoche form is without precent<br>grammatically and unnecessary, because the term _Wolf_ was used initially<br>as an unaccompanied noun, and not in the adjective-noun combinations (_wolf<br>interval_, _wolf tone_) found later (my earliest example is nineteenth<br>century - but Jonathan Walker may know an earlier source). As I indicated<br>before, the _wolf_ is a metaphor, and a metaphor must retain the declension<br>of the borrowed term. <br><br>Furthermore, English has so few surviving Germanic plural endings that it<br>certainly adds to the surface variety of our language to be able to use one<br>when we can!<br><br>Letï¿½s get back to tuning...<br><br>Dr Daniel Wolf, Frankfurt  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 10 Dec 1996 21:43 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA21595; Tue, 10 Dec 1996 21:45:28 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA21566<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA28256; Tue, 10 Dec 1996 12:45:24 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 10 Dec 1996 12:45:24 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612101540_MC1-CE2-BDC2@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4300 href="#4300">ðŸ”—</a>alves@osiris.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)</h3><span>12/11/1996 10:11:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Dan Wolf brought up some issues in regard to the topic of ornaments and<br>intonation.

A quick trill would tend to obscure<br>them because the pitch's duration each time you heard it would be very<br>short and the other note in the trill would compete for the impression of<br>pitch. However, certain Indian gamaka are defined as much more broad<br>elaborations of the melody (as Dan demonstrated).<br><br>The portamento, so important in most Indian instrumental and vocal<br>traditions, often to me creates a tension that is only resolved when the<br>pitch reaches its target frequency.

A favorite example is in the big Organ<br>Prelude and Fugue in D.  In the Prelude, the second section (dotted<br>rhythms) there is a cadence on F# major which is notated as an eighth note<br>followed by a pause.  Immediately following is a sweep to a HUGE D major<br>triad (very bright in well-tempered systems!), followed by a glorious Alla<br>Breve.

A trill of any duration and sufficient speed will tend to create an<br>audible dyad (especially on the Harpsichord, whose damping mechanism is<br>rather slow: Ligeti's _Continuum_ uses such rapid playing to striking<br>effect and the tuning is quite transparent).<br><br>Billï¿½s remarks about portamento are, I think, more typical of Hindustani<br>music than Karnatic where a portamento of more than a fourth and more than<br>one beat in duration is extremely rare. Many list members may be familiar<br>with the exhuberant octave-or-more ascending portamenti used especially by<br>Muslim vocalists. (I am especially fond of long portamenti that overreach<br>the target pitch, then fall back to the target precisely with a strong<br>position in the tala). The ideas of Nazir Jairazbhoy about tempering raise<br>a really different and interesting conception of _temperament_ than is<br>usually encountered in this forum, that of deliberate deviations from just<br>intervals to put those intervals into a kind of audible relief. (Perhaps<br>deliberate **out of tuneness** would make an interesting discussion<br>topic!).  <br><br>In answer to a question posted off the list: The gamakas I indicated in my<br>posting are practiced at all speeds, from ca. one step 60 to two, four,<br>eight times as fast, where  the dyadic effect is quite pronounced. <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 11 Dec 1996 22:55 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA25920; Wed, 11 Dec 1996 22:57:18 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA26028<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA13407; Wed, 11 Dec 1996 13:57:14 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 11 Dec 1996 13:57:14 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612112155.NAA13350@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
