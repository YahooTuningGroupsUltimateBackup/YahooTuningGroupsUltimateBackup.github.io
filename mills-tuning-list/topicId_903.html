For 1<N<1.5, there is no guarantee that the approximating <br>intervals<br>>> will be consistent with one another.<br><br>>Yes, I noted that in my "erratum" followup message.  However, the<br>>algorithm I just posted in response to John Chalmers is correct.<br><br>Your new algorithm is not correct either -- at least it does not reproduce <br>my definition of consistency. In particular, no tuning can fail to be level <br>1 consistent according to your algorithm, and some tunings would be level 2 <br>consistent according to this algorithm that wouldn't be according to your <br>original definition. I will give the correct consistency algorithm if you <br>wish. John C., you are correct that "fractional consistency" is kind of <br>meaningless; I was using it in the sense of Paul H.'s original definition <br>with respect to the maximum error size.<br><br><br>>> 	     I don't think the concept of consistency has much to do with <br>whether a<br>>> particular JI interval is approximated well enough to be used as a <br>harmonic<br>>> consonance.<br><br>>I don't think that's exactly what I meant, or even what I said.<br><br>I was responding to your assertion that common-practice harmony did not find <br>7-tET sufficient. Clearly, 7-tET would not provide the desired harmonic <br>effect when used for common-practice harmony. I believe the reasons lie not <br>with higher-level consistency but with accuracy.<br><br>But the actual historical reasons for not adopting 7-tET lie not with <br>5-limit, but even earlier with 3-limit harmony, as practiced in Medieval <br>music. Although 7-tET may have a high level of consistency within the <br>3-limit, its accuracy in approximating 3-limit consonances is questionable. <br>Medieval musicians tuned fifths and fourths with enough accuracy that is was <br>clearly seen that the eighth note in a circle of fifths was different from <br>the first. Thus the process of chromatic alteration began that ultimately <br>led to 12-tET. In China, fifths and fourth were also the main harmonic <br>consonances, and China developed 12-tET before the West did. In Thailand, <br>however, the accuracy of the fifths and fourths was less important, since <br>their role was more melodic than harmonic and because most Thai instruments <br>do not have harmonic partials. Thus it is not surprising that Thailand did <br>develop 7-tET.<br><br>[bigsnip]<br>>> 	     What consistency offers is a supplement to considerations of how <br>good<br>>> the approximations to JI are. Essentially, composing with a consistent<br>>> tuning will be no more difficult than composing in JI, while in<br>inconsistent<br>>> tunings, complications may arise if one attempts to always use the best<br>>> approximations to JI intervals.<br><br><br>>Here's where we part company, I'm afraid.  I find level 1 consistency to<br>>be far too low a standard.  Very weird things can happen in level 1<br>>consistent tunings.  A simple example: 5TET is consistent at the<br>>5-limit.  A 16/15, represented as a 4/3 less a 5/4, becomes 2-2=0 steps,<br>>or a unison.  However, a 25/24, represented as a 5/4 less a 6/5, becomes<br>>2-1=1 step.  In other words, a larger interval becomes a unison while a<br>>smaller interval does not.  Maybe this doesn't bother you, but for me it<br>>causes cognitive dissonance.<br><br>Well, the idea of using 5-tET for 5-limit harmony bothers me. Didn't you <br>read my post? I explained why, even though 7-tET is consistent at the <br>5-limit, it is not a good tuning for 5-limit harmony. The same goes for <br>5-tET. If a tuning is both consistent and has good approximations to JI <br>however, then I will admit it, even if the second-order intervals do not <br>behave as in JI. I think 22-tET is marginally good enough for 9-limit <br>harmony, if the texture doen't get too thin, but observe:  64/63, an 8/7 <br>less a 9/8, is 4-4=0 steps, while 81/80, a 9/8 less a 10/9, is 4-3=1 step. <br>"In other words, a larger interval becomes a unison while a smaller interval <br>does not." This doesn't bother me in the slightest -- in fact I like it.<br><br>The ear does not have a pre-defined map of JI; it does, however, perceive <br>consonance, dissonance, and scale structures. Sometimes the most effective <br>scale structures for consonance differ significantly from JI, but I think <br>these differences can be just fine, even necessary, unless they violate <br>simple consistency.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 20 Sep 1996 21:51 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29365; Fri, 20 Sep 1996 21:53:15 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA31963<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA13137; Fri, 20 Sep 1996 12:53:13 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 20 Sep 1996 12:53:13 -0700<br>Message-Id: <55960920195155/0005695065PK2EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3652 href="#3652">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/1996 2:17:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Fri, 20 Sep 1996, PAULE wrote:<br>> Your new algorithm is not correct either -- at least it does not reproduce <br>> my definition of consistency.
