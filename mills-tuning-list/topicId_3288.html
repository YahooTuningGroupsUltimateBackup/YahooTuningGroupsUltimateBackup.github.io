This is exactly the kind of response I was hoping<br>for.  As I emphasized frequently in my posting, the guitar ain't<br>hardly my instrument.  <br><br>So your fret diagram would be:<br> <br><br> 0         1       2       3       4      5     6     7    8    9<br>E||--------|-------|-------|-------|------|-----|-----|----|----|e'<br>B||--------|-------|-------|-------|------|-----|-----|---x|----|g'<br>G||--------|-------|-------|-------|------|-----|----x|----|----|d'<br>D||--------|-------|-------|-------|------|----x|-----|----|----|g#<br>A||--------|-------|-------|-------|------|-----|----x|----|----|e<br>E||--------|-------|-------|-------|------|-----|-----|----|----|E<br><br><br><br>The fingering I used in my fretboard diagram came from books<br>I have about Jimi -- and you know how music books are --<br>it seems there's always room for "interpretation".<br><br>Also, I analyzed the chord in F#, not E, because <br>that's the key of "Foxey Lady".  Did he fret the chord as you<br>described, and use a capo on the second fret?  A friend of mine who <br>is rather well-informed about Jimi says that to his knowledge Jimi<br>never used a capo.  Did he tune the whole guitar up a whole step?<br>(That sounds like something Jimi might do); in which case, the<br>extreme tension of the strings would have a further bearing on<br>the timbre and the intonation of the chord.<br><br>>next, i couldn't be bothered to read the _entire_ correspondence <br>I know it was *really* long -- sorry about that, but there's quite<br>a bit of interesting stuff buried in there. <br><br>>with your friend,<br><br>We've never met, and all he's done so<br>far in email is argue with me.  But it's been very productive.<br><br>>but my first observation (i could be wrong) is that you both <br>>seem to be ignoring the idea that 12-tone equal temperament<br>>is its own distinct tuning system and<br>>that composers who work within it (even hendrix) are making music in<br>>that very system, not ostensibly in imitation of extended just<br>>intonation. in which case the relationships in said chord could be<br>>represented (theoretically, as none of us is ever in perfect e.t.):<br>>0/0/4/10/3/0--using the pitch-class set numbers.<br><br>You are perfectly correct here -- I originally  stated simply that<br>I give Jimi the credit for definitely establishing the 19th<br>harmonic as a valid chord identity in rock.  Of course both he and<br>Noel Redding were playing their notes on 12-equal instruments, and<br>I don't begin to assume that Jimi had these mathematical and<br>acoustical concepts in mind when he played -- but I *do* believe<br>(because I can hear it) that he had an extraordinary sensitivity to <br>fine nuances of pitch, and he had the technique to produce the <br>expressivity he conceived in his head or felt in his heart or gut <br>(or wherever his inspiration came from).<br><br>Also, I was only using one riff from one song as an<br>example of one particular harmonic concept -- this is not meant<br>to suggest that there was any extensive just-intonation theorizing<br>uderlying Jimi's output at large.<br><br>After listening to all of the different interpretations of this<br>chord which were suggested in our debate, the one which<br>I both like the most and which I feel sounds most like what<br>Jimi played, is also the one with the most logical argument<br>behind it, suggested by Paul: that Jimi "bent" the two lowest<br>fretted notes with the two strongest fingers, the "root" and<br>the "3rd", upward by about 31 and 17 cents respectively<br>and played the "7th"  and "sharp 9th" as 12-equal notes<br>with the two weaker fingers, giving the chord roughly his<br>interpretation of 6:15:21:28, but with the top pitch 2 cents<br>sharper than 7/6, and the "root" (and thus the whole chord) 31<br>cents sharper than the 12-equal bass part.  With even a small<br>amount of distortion in the guitar, the out-of-tuneness of the<br>bass sounds to me more like a "coloration" than like truly bad<br>intonation.<br>><br>>also, it is my experience that, on my stratocaster, played with heavy<br>>overdrive, using the bridge position pickup, i can only isolate up to<br>>about the 13th harmonic on the lowest string (usually tuned to an 'e', <br>>as<br>>a slacker string might give a different harmonic impression<br>>[inharmonicity?]), in which case your argument against the audibilty <br>>of<br>>the 19th partial would be valid.<br><br>It was Paul who argued *against* the audibility of 19 -- I had said<br>that in a chord tuned to 4:5:14, the 5 and the 14 would produce<br>a summation tone of 19, which may (or may not) be audible.  Let's<br>hear from you other guitarists out there!<br><br>-Monzo<br><br>>joe<br><br>>sorry, i missed the reference to foxy lady: my verison of the chord<br>comes<br>>from his more mainstream guitar hit, 'purple haze' which is in 'e'.<br>indeed<br>>you were right about the former, it is in f# and is played without capo<br>>or extreme scordatura (sp?).<br><br>><snip><br>-fc<br><br>Does that mean that my original fretboard diagram is correct?<br>Did Jimi play the low F# with his thumb over the top of the neck?<br>I'd like to replace the X's in my diagram with fret-hand fingerings.<br>Again, input from other guitarists would be appreciated.<br> <br>   Joseph L.
