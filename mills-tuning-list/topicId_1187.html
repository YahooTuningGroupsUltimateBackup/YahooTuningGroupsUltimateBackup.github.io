Commissioned exclusively<br>>for Kronos Quartet.<br>><br>>I have no idea what the piece sounds like (this is the West Coast Premiere<br>>of the work), but as someone who had the pleasure of seeing Kronos 7 times<br>>(including the entire "Salome Dances for Peace"), I heartedly recommend it.<br><br>A great opportunity for me to reminisce about this _great_ quartet!  It was<br>commissioned by Kronos, but of course not -exlusively- for them (Kronos'<br>standard exclusive-performance rights are three years).  I had the great<br>pleasure of attending rehearsals and a performance of this work, played by<br>the Klangforum Wien Quartet (part of a terrific new-music ensemble,<br>featuring a couple of former members of the Hagen Quartet), in a beautiful<br>and resonant church in early 1995.  The subtitle is "The Magic Chord x4,"<br>and is based on the "Dream Chords" from the "Well-Tuned Piano", played as<br>natural harmonics of open strings.  Very exact JI is required, and a Rayna<br>Synthesizer is provided with the part-rentals.<br><br>This was Young's first fully-notated work in about 20 years, and it is to<br>me (a classical-person at heart) his most beautiful work.  Fans of the<br>Dream House and such computer-driven installations will most likely rejoice<br>in the respiratory phrases of this work, while sacrificing very little<br>tuning precision.  A bonus effect, one not intended by La Monte, is the<br>subtle increase in harmonic beating as the 2-hour-plus work progresses,<br>simply due to the settling of strings and changing of temperature in the<br>cold church.<br><br>-Adam<br><br>_________________<br>Adam B.
