Chalmers said:<br>><br>>> (Allen, do you still have your notes from his UCSD<br>>>class?).<br><br>This reminds me of something I've been wondering for a while- does any music<br>school anywhere have a regular course on tuning and JI, maybe even with<br>tuning's compositional implications?  What I know I've picked up from<br>reading Partch and Chalmers and messing around with movable frets and JI<br>Calc.  It would be helpful to have a bibliography and syllabus if such a<br>course exists.  Larry Polansky once published outlines of a number of his<br>music courses- something like this for a course in tuning would be<br>especially helpful. I'm out in the 'working world' and so don't have time to<br>take a real course, but at least collecting the materials and going through<br>them would be a step in the right direction.<br><br>Steve Curtin<br>Ensoniq Corp<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 13 Nov 1995 19:30 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA26725; Mon, 13 Nov 1995 09:30:51 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 13 Nov 1995 09:30:51 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199511131729.JAA26540@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
