On to the matters at hand...<br>....................................................................<br><br>Regarding the possible ways to present the music and works of Harry Partch,<br>I would like to clear up some of the inaccuracies, implications and mistaken<br>priorities represented in the writings of Johnny Reinhard.  One reason I do<br>this is that by allusion Johnny might have readers believe that I do not<br>take these issues seriously, due to an apparent inability to separate<br>humorous delivery from dedicated content.  Not only have most readers<br>handled this quite well, one would assume that my own background in working<br>with Partch and the Ensemble would be evidence enough of a commitment to the<br>core.<br><br>What Johnny objects to, always and strenuously, is what he refers to as<br>an "ideology".  What I have sought to do, to guard against charges of<br>cultism, is to show how my views are rooted in, and directly stem from,<br>the beliefs that Partch himself chose to hold close.  On many occasions I<br>have alluded to Partch's writings, citing instances where he spoke<br>directly to a given subject.  All of this apparently for naught.  I don't<br>propose that I can, or could, read Partch's mind; he spoke to these<br>issues quite often enough to, at the very least, give weight to this<br>perspective.  It is still easy to hear some of these voices, had they<br>been active during Harry's lifetime, saying "Come on, old man, let us use<br>the instruments!  At least let us do transcriptions and spread the word!<br>We've got contacts!  We've got venues!  Why do you feel the need to hoard<br>all of that stuff?"<br><br>Of course, Partch did not consider such things, and, save for the last<br>few years of his life, he was probably too obscure to even encounter such<br>attitudes.  Yet, couldn't Harry have though of doing transcriptions?  To<br>allow for a wider audience, even to foster 'authorized' lesser versions,<br>so that people would be drawn to the real thing?  There would have been<br>no more important time than during his lifetime to see many ensembles<br>performing "Barstow".  It seems to have been neither considered nor<br>executed, for obvious (albeit philosophical) reasons.<br><br>It does not help 'the loyal opposition' one whit when they are standing<br>on factual quicksand.  Johnny said of the Philadelphia Revelation"<br>performance: "...the Partch instruments were practically hidden from view<br>behind the acting...".  If you weren't there, folks (and I *was*, standing<br>at the business end of both the Marimba Eroica and the Boo, kicking them<br>into action when the score called for it), the production took place in the<br>atrium (Great Hall) of the University of the Arts.  The set extended from<br>the main stage, centrally located and about 8 feet off of ground level,<br>to just about even with the third floor.  The instruments were placed on<br>either side of a rising flight of stairs on a series of risers, each<br>successively higher than the previous one by about 6 to 8 feet.  When<br>behind the Eroica I was almost at eye level with the second story.<br>Knowing this, it is completely *erroneous* to say that the instruments<br>were hidden behind the acting -- they couldn't have done it if they<br>tried.  It was rare that they were lit up like a prison break, but that<br>would be in keeping with the rather tragic nature of the piece (and<br>Partch's notes on the set: "...the instruments are distributed in the<br>shade below...".  This false reporting leads one to believe that if you<br>can't stand on solid ground in terms of supporting your propositions,<br>just make something up.  It also leads the reader astray.<br><br>Johnny is also critical, once again, of the non-Corporeal Lincoln Center<br>production: "Perhaps there were no other such *non-corporeal* performance<br>of Partch because Danlee Mitchell stopped directing Partch productions<br>soon after."  This slap at Harry's staunchest ally through the years<br>contains no logic whatsoever: of the 3 staged performances that I can<br>recall during 15 years of performance, *none* led to a preponderance of<br>non-corporeal presentations.  In fact, during Mitchell's stewardship<br>Partch's works attained a corporeal spirit never quite realized during<br>Partch's lifetime; there was a continual quest to find more, and more<br>effective,  ways to imbue the works with the "sound magic, visual beauty,<br>experience ritual" that Harry so distinctly, so uniquely sought.  For<br>someone to make suppositions as Johnny does evidences his disregard for<br>the facts of record, as if one event could be undeniably indicative of an<br>unstoppable trend.<br><br>"So why is the impression being made repeatedly that these concerts -<br>still unheard by Mr. Szanto - are counterfeits?"  Because they are, to<br>use Harry's words, "about the one-half truth of the one-fourth factor".<br>In a humorous tone, in an effort to make an analogy so wide as to be<br>unmistakable, I contrasted two evenings versions of a Partch Ensemble<br>performance with one by the Ensemble and one by a drum and bugle corp.<br>I thought that no one could have taken it as a serious comparison, but<br>the point remains that an artistic line will *always* have to be drawn,<br>beyond which limit the artifact of the artist ceases to contain the<br>essential qualities that make it so rare in the first place.  How *far*<br>from the original can you go before the new version becomes parody?  Each<br>artist himself can make that determination; Andy Warhol had his answer,<br>but not every 'canvas' is so readily applicable to 'copies'.  Harry was<br>certainly clear during his lifetime: he did not transcribe, or allow<br>transcriptions of, any of his music.  The evolutionary changes that<br>accompanied some of the works ("Barstow" would be a good example)<br>reflected a growth in both his physical ensemble of instruments and his<br>compositional palette.  They were not symptomatic of orchestrational<br>ambivalence.<br><br>And in a similar vein comes the ever-present question transcriptors ask:<br>"Why should Partch's work be treated any differently from other composer's?"<br>This question seems at the same time to beg both a voluminous response and a<br>simple one.  The former: no, not now...  The latter: show me another<br>composer that created his own intonational system, for the purpose of more<br>accurately setting human speech (primarily American English) in a musical<br>format, came up with an ensemble which was conceived, designed and built<br>over a 50 year period, all of preceding leading directly to, and along with,<br>an aesthetic based on the non-separation of performance disciplines (dancers<br>*more* than dancers, instrumentalists *more* than instrumentalists, etc.).<br>Then toss in their claim to be rooted in ancient principles.  Damned hard to<br>find one.  And I would be willing to bet that the same rigorous application<br>of correct performance practice would not be out of place for him/her, either.<br><br>Harry Partch was not *just another composer*, and he of necessity engenders<br>different rules.  You call it idealism; that makes it convenient to validate<br>technologically correct but pale imitations, bereft of the bone and sinew of<br>a human being pumping on a Chromelodeon (to cite one example).  I call it a<br>realistic assessment of what the person who created this madness had in mind<br>all along, like it or not.  And while he says that the alternate versions<br>being done today are "still unheard by Mr. Szanto", which in and of itself<br>is not terribly accurate (Johnny's transcriptions being the only one's I am<br>*aware* of that I haven't heard, at least on recordings), it begs the issue:<br>Harry Partch is something to be judged on more than what is "heard" -- Harry<br>Partch is an Attitude.<br><br>Johnny accuses me (or Danlee, I'm not sure who...) of harboring "behind the<br>scenes double standards" that he finds "objectionable".  That he took my<br>reference to the "blight" of a transcription at face value, in spite of<br>my comment about dealing with the issue "seriously" in an earlier post,<br>allows him to remind me (us?) "that even paranoids have enemies."  Sorry,<br>but this is out there so far I can't even take offense at it.  As to the<br>double-standards, I don't believe they were intended; more to the point,<br>efforts have been made to address them.  If you wish to read Danlee<br>Mitchell's statement regarding these performance issues, it is available; in<br>the statement Mitchell acknowledges earlier errors in allowing some of these<br>(constantly mentioned) transcriptions: "In other words - I should have known<br>better!"  So the task of where to draw the artistic 'line in the sand' is of<br>crucial importance, as we find out.  I've certainly gained<br>new insights during this debate, and now have to come to grips with *my*<br>earlier 'leniency', seeing as I seemed to have liked Ted Mook's "Li Po".<br>Live and learn: looks like *my* circle of acceptability might contract<br>even tighter.  But I'm just one voice...<br><br>So Johnny goes on, emitting little one-liners as if the subject matter<br>were as inconsequential as deciding what clothes to wear tomorrow.  He<br>makes some kind of arm-chair psychological analysis of Harry's<br>personality, throws around the term "morbid", speaks anthropomorphically<br>about the instruments -- all in service of... what?  He won't say; too<br>much trouble, either to you (the dear readers) or, privately, to me (the<br>idealist).<br><br>Well, we have reached one possible ending.  Naturally, Johnny is<br>unconvinced as to the validity of all this hoohaa; to accept these concepts<br>might mean a curtailing of his performance schedule.  I have no doubt that<br>he will continue to perform the pieces; it's a free country.  One wonders,<br>however, what to think about performers that skate so much on the surface of<br>a very deep and soulful repertoire (see, isn't it *obvious* how much this<br>MEANS to me?).  Do they really believe they are doing justice to Partch's<br>vision?  Have they really paused to understand some of the other aspects of<br>Partch's work, aside from getting those pesky vibrations out into the ether?<br>To me, the challenge of properly presenting the concept, the true work of<br>Partch in the days ahead lies in an understanding of just how different he<br>was, how fragile the corpus of his creativity.  And to make matters all the<br>more difficult, to do this so that it does not merely set up yet another<br>rigor-mortised tradition. This is the issue I have grappled with, and<br>continue to do so.  Let others make "a concert of music".<br><br>I don't imagine that I will be on any more Partch projects in a<br>performing sense, but my involvement hasn't ended there.  I wish I had<br>either the eloquence or the balls that Harry did while addressing these<br>concerns.  In the meantime, to avoid anyone having the mistaken<br>impression that I am in the fray for anything less than honorable<br>reasons, I close with some thoughts of Harry's contained in a manual he<br>wrote regarding maintenance and repair of the instruments:<br><br>   "The basic and essential need as of this moment is someone who <br>    can and will -- if necessary -- take my place (1) to see to it <br>    that the instruments are in good structural and playable condition;<br>    (2) to keep them in tune as well as this is humanly possible; and<br>    (3) to demand that they be played competently, and that the <br>    attitudes be right, even at the risk of arousing momentary <br>    hostility."<br><br>I wonder how long this "momentary" will last.  No matter -- as Johnny so<br>succinctly put it: "I guess the issues of performing Partch are not funny<br>to me."<br><br><br>Respectfully, consonantly,<br>Jon<br>*--------------------------------------------------------------------*<br>   Jonathan M.
