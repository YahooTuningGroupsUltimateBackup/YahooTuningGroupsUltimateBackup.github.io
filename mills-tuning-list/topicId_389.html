(By the way, it was 88CET tuning.)  Her comment has been very<br>useful to setting my future plans.  Brian M. enjoyed that piece (but not some of<br>my other 88CET compositions), so it seems to be partly a matter of how it's<br>perceived in context.  <br><br>   In particular, it seems to be a good illustration of the risks in undertaking<br>simulations of acoustic instruments electronically.  People expect pure<br>perfection or complete abstractness.  Anything between the two is distracting.  <br><br>   And it's pretty difficult to attain this kind of perfection.  The cheap<br>recorders she refered to were almost completely unprocessed digital samples of<br>real piccolos.  Sampling for this sort of usage is a risky business; it sets you<br>up against a far higher standard than purely electronic timbres ever had to<br>tackle.  <br><br>   Combining this line of inquiry with Bill's comment, it seems likely that<br>playing nontraditional tunings on imperfect traditional timbres makes the whole<br>thing sound like one big mistake to they layman.  They can accept it when one of<br>the two - tuning or timbre - is nontraditional (or irrelevant in the case of<br>abstract timbres), but not both.  <br><br>   Similarly, the particular piece I'm told that she was refering to was<br>intended as "fun".  It was intentionally simple in terms of rhythm, form,<br>instrumentation, counterpoint, duration, meter, tempo, and even harmony (other<br>than that its pitches come from a nontraditional fragment of the harmonic<br>series).  Combining that with a reasonably cute melody, how can anybody expect<br>it to be a profound musical statement?  Yet she and another reviewer thought of<br>it as a failed attempt at deep musical expression.  I think that that second<br>reviewer answered that question exactly:  Because real instrument timbres carry<br>a stigma of profoundness that electronic timbres don't.  <br><br>   Perhaps we can all learn from this.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 3 Mar 1996 08:54 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id XAA04296; Sat, 2 Mar 1996 23:54:07 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 2 Mar 1996 23:54:07 -0800<br>Message-Id: <31395069.401A@sfo.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2618 href="#2618">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Adam B.
