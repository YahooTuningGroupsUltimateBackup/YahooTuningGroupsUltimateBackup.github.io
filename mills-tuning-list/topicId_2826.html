This is<br>Pythagorean intonation.<br><br>But does a singer ever sing this many successive fifths (or fourths)?<br>Evidently not. In highly modulated music such a chain might occur, but<br>would be only an almost undiscernable trickle of tonality in the great<br>flood of tones more directly related to the tonic (new or old.)<br><br>The system is therefore without practical relation to music, and is one<br>of those theoretical delusions which so plague and confuse musicians.<br>But this cycle of fifths does nevertheless have an important r?le to<br>play in the derivation of systems which are fit for practical music.<br><br>If the cycle of fifths/fourths is used merely to ensure that each one of<br>the tones of a temperament has a consonant fifth above and below it, and<br>that the other consonances are likewise related to the fifths such that<br>consonant chords are present, and the maximum number of consonant<br>melodic intervals likewise present (this is the point I have earlier<br>made in connection with the harmonic and melodic deficiencies of the<br>22-tone equal) then the cycle of fifths/fourths is very useful - in the<br>context of temperament, not just intonation - to ensure that the cycle<br>of the fifth/fourth shall be harmonically and melodically congruent with<br>the cycles of the major third/minor sixth and minor third/major sixth.<br>That is to say, by congruent, I mean that every pitch of the temperament<br>has both consonant fifths and thirds above and below it. If even one<br>tone lacks this, then we have at a stroke severely restricted both<br>modulation, and also gravely weakened the melodic coherence of music,<br>which depends on a seamless fabric of consonances and dissonances<br>related by consonance. Within limits, music can survive a poor<br>temperament, as the 12-tone equal daily attests, but its variety and<br>expressivity will be found to be greatly constrained.<br><br>But if the cycle of fifths is used as a basis for just intonation, it<br>excludes the thirds and sixths from consonance, which is absurd. There<br>are two other consonant cycles besides the cycle of the fifths/fourths,<br>to which cycles I referred in the previous paragraph. The thirds and<br>sixths are more common in song than either fifth or fourth, so although<br>they are less consonant, they are but little less likely to be sung<br>accurately, the more so as the thirds are much narrower than the fifth<br>and fourth.<br><br>It follows that any just intonation which hopes to be of practical use<br>in describing what singers can sing, or what they find easiest to sing,<br>and in describing how closely a given dissonance is related to the<br>tonic, and hence how "tonal" that dissonance is, must include all three<br>consonant cycles in the calculation.<br><br>These principles follow from acoustics, and not primarily from art or<br>culture. Renaissance polyphony, Rock music, Western 'Classical' music,<br>Arab music, Indian music, etc all share, at least for singers, in these<br>principles. No singer accurately sings the 20th just fifth from the<br>tonic (unless by chance this corresponds to a consonant interval.)<br><br>As it turns out, even if one does give greater weight to the cycle of<br>the fifth/fourth, calling dissonances "tonal" that are related to the<br>tonic through _two_ successive fifths or fourths (and not one only) we<br>have only two additional tonal dissonances, both of them a mere comma<br>removed from consonances, and so perfectly irrelevant melodically, and<br>worthless for harmony. These are 32:27 (4/3 x 4/3 x 4/3) and 27:16 (3/2<br>x 3/2 x 3/2), and occur of course among the regular atonal dissonances<br>that I have enumerated.<br><br>These principles have nothing to do with any one temperament; they hold<br>true for all temperaments and systems; I certainly did not dream them up<br>to promote the 19-tone equal temperament, which however closely conforms<br>to the resulting intervals.<br><br>No matter how one may try to avoid it, no matter what argument one may<br>devise, it cannot be denied that the 19 degrees of the 19-tone equal<br>correspond remarkably well (though not of course perfectly) to the 7<br>consonances and 12 tonal dissonances. Of course, as I have just noted,<br>it is possible to discuss _at the margins_ in a manner of speaking. One<br>may discuss whether the septimals should be included as consonances, but<br>even were we so unwise as to take these intervals for consonant, we<br>would do nothing except set up a very limited exception to the general<br>tonality of music. The manner of deriving the tonal dissonances is also<br>debatable, though again, within the realms of reasonable debate, the<br>number of 12 tonal dissonances can be altered only slightly if at all.<br><br>This is not an arbitrary system, any more than the multiplication table<br>is arbitrary. The tonal dissonances are associated to the consonances<br>through 94 different consonant progressions, which form the fabric of<br>tonality which it is the business of temperament to knit yet more<br>strongly together. By this means dissonance acquires an inevitable,<br>highly memorable character that marvelously contributes to the<br>expressive power of music.<br><br>I believe I have posted the tonal progressions proper to one of the 19<br>intervals. I don't think this is the place to post them all, but here is<br>one more:<br><br>25/24 , 70.7 cents, the chromatic semitone:<br><br>5/4 x 5/3 , 5/4 x 5/6, 5/3 x 5/4, 5/3 x 5/8, 25/18 x 3/2, 25/18 x 3/4,<br> 25/16 x 4/3, 25/16 x 2/3<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Subject:  19 tone/20 tone<br>PostedDate:  18-12-97 03:48:00<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  18-12-97 03:45:54-18-12-97 03:45:54,18-12-97 03:45:31-18-12-97 03:45:32<br>DeliveredDate:  18-12-97 03:45:32<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256571.000F2EC3; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 03:47:46 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18430; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 03:48:00 +0100<br>Date: Thu, 18 Dec 1997 03:48:00 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18621<br>Received: (qmail 9585 invoked from network); 17 Dec 1997 18:46:50 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 17 Dec 1997 18:46:50 -0800<br>Message-Id: <34989783.57EC@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6732 href="#6732">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>12/19/1997 9:28:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>I want to say that guitarist<br>>Dan Stearns uses 20 eq, and creates music of great depth and power with<br>>it.
