That tuning has been imposed by transcribers with a 12 eq<br>bias, but the early blues was not played from scores.  The libral use of<br>pitch bends can easily be viewed as a method to compensate for instruments,<br>like guitar that were built to conform to 12 eq scales.  There is very<br>little pitch bending used in other early examples of music with African<br>roots that are either a cappella, or played on instruments such as<br>non-fretted string instruments or wind instruments that are more flexible<br>in their intonation.  This seem to indicate that the pitch bend was<br>initially used to correct the pitch, rather than used as a stylistic device. <br><br>-John<br><br><br><br><br>-------------------------------<br>John Maxwell Hobbs<br>jmax@artswire.org<br>http://www.artswire.org/~jmax<br><br>Web Phases - an interactive, web-based composition<br>http://www.artswire.org/~jmax/phaseframe.html</div><h3><a id=7407 href="#7407">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>4/8/1998 6:17:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>The creative process, in my experience, is highly unpredictable...<br>>Others still<br>>with a concept which in turn dictates form, then you construct themes,<br>>and so on in good...<br><br>   I too have found a wide variety of musical inspirations, and at least<br>one of my compositions that I can recall right off was largely inspired<br>right from the start from a formal idea.
