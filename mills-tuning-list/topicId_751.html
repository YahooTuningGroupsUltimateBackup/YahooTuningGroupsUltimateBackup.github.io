It would also be interested to know, how people that<br>>include tunings as part of their teachings introduce them (and subdivide<br>>them).<br><br>This is how I would structure a 15-week course on tunings, meeting twice a <br>week, with musical examples along the way. The course would be "hands on" <br>with monochords and scalatrons for all.<br><br>1. Introduce the octave as an acoustical phenomenon<br>2. Introduce the 3-limit consonances and Pythagorean tunings<br>3. Pythagorean tunings as applied to pentatonic scales: Chinese Music<br>4. 7-ET representations of pentatonic scales allowing modulational freedom: <br>Thai music<br>5. Pythagorean tunings as applied to the heptatonic scale: Organum<br>6. Discuss the pythagorean comma; introduce 12-ET representations of the <br>heptatonic scale<br>7. Non-just non-equal-tempered scales: African and much other music<br>8. Introduce the 5-limit consonances<br>9. Schismatic tuning of late middle ages and medieval Arabic tuning as <br>Pythagorean approximations to the 5-limit<br>10. Just intonation: Indian music (I've heard some santoor music where the <br>intonation is very clearly just 5-limit).<br>11. Discuss the syntonic comma; introduce meantone temperament: Renaissance <br>music<br>12. Equal-tempered versions of meantone -- 31, 19, is 12 good enough?<br>13. Circulating temperaments/well temperament: Bach and "key colors"<br>14. 12-TET becomes standard :( , Arabic music measured and played in <br>"quarter-tones"<br>15. Equal tempered versions of just intonation: 53, 34, maybe compare <br>22-equal with 22 sruti of Indian music to show how JI structures are <br>preserved<br>16. Atonality, set theory, Balzano and 20-TET and other numerological <br>constructs.<br>17. Introduce the 7-limit consonances<br>18. Augmented sixth chords as meantone approximations to the 7-limit<br>19. Introduce the 9- and 11-limit consonances in JI: Partch, Johnston, etc.<br>20. Equal-tempered representations of higher consonances: Huygens, Fokker, <br>and 31; Herf, Sims and 72, proposals of 41-tone and 171-tone equal <br>temperaments<br>21. Inharmonic timbres, tunings to go with them: Gamelan music, modern <br>explorations<br>22. Non-octave scales in history and modern non-octave tunings such as <br>Pierce's 13 per 3:1<br>23-30.
