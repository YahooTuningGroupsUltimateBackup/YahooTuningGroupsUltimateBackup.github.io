A month or two ago, when I presented him with an article I wrote about 53TET, he was not interested <br>and did not even bother reading it. But...<br><br>	On our way to a Thanksgiving gig in NH, I had him listen to Gary Morisson's 88CET demo tape.  Being a <br>jazz trombone player, he could appreciate the sound of the subminor thirds in the dominant seventh chord. <br>That's when it clicked.  He was surprised of hearing all these xenharmonic chord progressions, that were very <br>different from the regular ones, yet everything made sense. He found it refreshing and was happy to see that a <br>young musician like me was searching for the perfect pitch. He asked if he could copy the tape and offered me <br>private lessons, which is an honor for me, because he doesn't normally teach anymore.<br><br>	I believe that any serious musician, if well oriented on the subject of microtonality, will be <br>interested in knowing more about other tunings.<br><br>-Kami<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 1 Dec 1996 17:07 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13632; Sun, 1 Dec 1996 17:09:01 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13593<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA26809; Sun, 1 Dec 1996 08:08:57 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 1 Dec 1996 08:08:57 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.961201074049.21766A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
