I expected to find<br>>discussions mostly of just tuning issues on this list, but there seems to <br>be<br>>as much discussion of various ET scales.  This puzzles me.  We've been <br>stuck<br>>with a handful of pitch "islands," to use Brian Eno's term, for a few <br>hundred<br>>years now.  Finally, technology is giving us keyboards with virtually<br>>continuous pitch possibilities, allowing us to produce music that is more<br>>consistent with natural principles (acoustics, psycho-acoustics, etc.). <br> Why<br>>continue exploring various equal temperaments?  What is the value in it?<br>>Please understand, I'm not registering a complaint or leveling a criticism;<br>>I just don't know what the heck's the dang big deal with ETs.  Myself, I'm<br>>glad to be rid of the dern varmints.  But I'd be fascinated to see a good<br>>apology (justification) in favor of them.<br><br>>David J. Finnamore<br><br>Psycho-acoustics has told us that our ears have limited pitch resolution, <br>and that they develop short-term familiarity with a small set of specific <br>pitches and specific melodic intervals. In my opinion, the greater the <br>number of consonant harmonies you can make out of a small set of pitches and <br>melodic intervals, the better. In this regard non-just tunings definitely <br>win out over JI.<br><br>Examples:<br><br>1. A 7-note diatonic scale in JI has three melodic intervals and five <br>consonant triads. In meantone (or 12-, 19-, 31-, 50-tET), it has two melodic <br>intervals and six consonant triads.<br><br>2. Another example eluded to already is tritone substitution. It is useful <br>to have a half-octave, since it can represent 7:5 in some contexts and its <br>own inversion, 10:7, in others. Using common tones in a changing context is <br>an effective way to move to distant harmonies, but in JI, distant harmonies <br>will have at most one common tone. JI of course has no half-octave.<br><br>Another way of saying this is that Just Intonation has no "puns", or notes <br>taken in two different senses, and typical JI theory does not admit punning. <br>However, in creating intervals in JI, you will eventually come across some <br>very complicated ratios that are so close to simple ones that they will <br>function as consonances rather than dissonances. So the typical JI <br>small-integersnsonance / large-integersssonance approach falls flat on <br>its face. In ETs, as long as the ET is _consistent_ within the particular <br>harmonic limit you are trying to represent, _accurate_ enough to represent <br>it, and does not have notes too close to each other (34 is just barely OK in <br>this last respect), the dichotomy between consonance and dissonance is <br>unambiguous and you have all the benefits of extended harmony enjoyed by JI <br>of that harmonic limit (I speak of odd-, not prime-number, limits here).<br><br>Ultimately I have to agree that a continuous-pitch paradigm is most <br>desirable. However, individual musical ideas within such a paradigm are <br>likely to employ simple sets of fixed pitches, and some non-just tuning, <br>perhaps even an ET, might be the best way to work out harmonizations and <br>developments of a given idea. Combining all the ideas into a single <br>composition, however, may require us to demand completely flexible pitch. <br>Johnny Reinhard's compositions make this case even where simple-limit <br>harmonic considerations are not often dominant.<br><br>Here's my point of view: We have several hundred years of Western music in <br>12-tET, by, say, 100 great composers. Have the possibilities been exhausted? <br>Somewhat. Does the existing repertoire have enough diversity to provide a <br>lifetime of listening enjoyment of the most transcendent and sublime sort? <br>Many seem to feel that it does. Therefore, even a single new tuning system <br>should be enough for a composer to do a lifetime of work and, even if the <br>composer is of the first rank, the composer will not exhaust 1% of the <br>tuning's resources. Considering the range of expression contained in 12-tET <br>music, any single microtonal tuning will, by increasing pitch resources, <br>lead to an unimaginable new universe of moods and sensations. The technical <br>difficulty of mastering a single new tuning, even a new ET, in the current <br>educational environment, is plenty to expect of a composer whose main goal <br>is to express himself/herself in a new way.<br><br>David, Let's discuss more if you like this topic as much as I.<br><br> -Paul E.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 6 May 1997 01:44 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05404; Tue, 6 May 1997 01:44:26 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05367<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id QAA09991; Mon, 5 May 1997 16:42:31 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 5 May 1997 16:42:31 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.96.970505155324.13036A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
