One way is for<br>birthdays - we count years completed as discreet units (except as children<br>when we enthusiastically noted the half year completed as well). The other<br>way of counting applies to calendars. Days, months, and years are<br>identified in terms of periods of time, and any moment within each of these<br>periods recieves that identification. By your birthday-style counting,<br>today would be 31 May 1996 (as I write it is 1 June 1997) because these are<br>the last full day, month, and year completed. Would you even go further and<br>call this the first millenium - because we have not yet completed the<br>second? Your interval-counting example is a good one. The common pitch class<br>notation with numbers does use 0, however, as the value for unisons, so<br>that intervals in the system can be added without subtracting 1. 0 in this<br>case is exactly like that moment when years 1 BC and AD met - it has no<br>magnitude. The value 0 is not always meaningful for musical purposes, however.<br>Consider a harmonic series over the fundamental n. The series goes: (1n,<br>2n, 3n ...). In terms of frequency, 0n (Zero n) is undefined.<br>Unfortunately, one notation frequently used by practicing musicians<br>considers 2n to be the ''first flageolet'' - in effect, your birthday<br>notation - which leads to real confusion in reading scores where the actual<br>pitch is not notated.

It's perfectly fine, for example, to call<br>the 20th century the one all of whose years begin with 19.  Or for that<br>matter to call the first year "the year of the dog", or the year 82b<br>hexadecimal.<br><br><br><br><br>>Your interval-counting example is a good one.<br><br>   Thanks.<br><br><br><br><br>>The value 0 is not always meaningful for musical purposes, however.<br>>Consider a harmonic series over the fundamental n.
