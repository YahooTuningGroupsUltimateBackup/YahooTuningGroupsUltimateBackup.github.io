I won't reproduce the quote,<br>but suffice to say it doesn't convince _me_ that Sarngadeva was<br>using equal temperament.  This is all irrelevant to contemporary<br>music, of course.  I'll bet there are more recent theorists than<br>Sarngadeva who imply that 1/4 comma meantone is the basis of<br>European music.<br><br>Incidentally, I wasn't previously aware of the Levy article (book?)<br>either.  Could you give details?<br><br>> Innumerable other authorities, both traditional and modern, say much the<br>> same thing. It is true that other authorities give - very slightly -<br>> unequal scales (Ellis, for example), and one, the quite untrustworthy<br>> Westerner Danielou, constructs a highly unequal 22-tone<br>> pseudo-pythagorean system, apparently out of thin air.<br><br>B C Deva, in "The Music of India: A Scientific Study" gives an unequal,<br>just 22 note scale.  Having at least the pretence of scientific rigour,<br>he goes on to measure it against an instrument.  Alas, I didn't realise<br>I was going to get into an argument about this, so I didn't take proper<br>notes.  The measured scale is more than 8 cents out from the<br>theoretical one.  However, most of the commas are preserved at about 20<br>cents, so we certainly aren't talking about equal temperament.<br><br>This scale has a certain contemporary relevence.  I did come across it<br>on the Web.  Try hypatia.ucsc.edu:70/1/RELATED/Batish/Archives/Rago1<br><br>T V Subba Rao's "Studies in Indian Music", my primary (alright, only)<br>source on the South Indian tradition, explicitly states that the srutis<br>are not 22 or 24 equal.<br><br>> Ravi Shankar, as<br>> I recall, says he uses 22 pitches in the octave - I don't remember<br>> whether equal, nearly equal, or unequal.<br><br>Hariprasad Chaurasia says the same in this month's Wire.  The 22 note<br>scale is dead in North India, but it's ghost still haunts those who<br>refuse to admit of more than 12 notes to the octave :-)<br><br>> My own opinion, however, is that while the 22-tone equal does seem to<br>> enjoy some instrumental use in India, the evidence - very scanty,<br>> admittedly - supports 19-tone equal for Indian vocal music.<br><br>I'm more for 12 pitch classes, boring though that may be.<br><br>>> As there is no modulation in Indian music, 436-cents thirds<br>>> will never arise, even if you follow Gregg's highly suspect<br>>> argument.<br>><br>> Alas, the incommensurability of the thirds and fifths in 22-tone equal<br>> does not arise only when modulation is employed, which I have always<br>> been very careful to note. If, taking C as tonic, we tune by fifths of<br>> 709 cents, we have a G of 709 cents and a B of 1145 cents. These two<br>> intervals form a 'major third' of 436 cents. 22-tone equal melody is a<br>> tissue of such badly, indeed unrecognizably mistuned consonances.<br><br>It is true that there is no way of specifying a major scale with 7<br>notes from a non-meantone temperament such that all thirds and<br>fifths are in tune.  However, I don't see this is being such a big<br>problem.  Neither, presumably, did Bharata, whose gramas give the<br>following major scales:<br><br>Sa-grama 4 3 2 4 4 3 2<br>Ma-grama 4 3 2 4 3 4 2<br><br>Each scale contains a mistuned fifth, which Bharata did claim as<br>a dissonance.  Bharata's srutis are nominally equal, however I<br>still do not see why these scales could not be just.  The interval<br>of 8 srutis would then be a Pythagorean major third of 408 cents.<br>This scale sounds fine, melodically, to my ears.  In Ma-grama, only<br>one (minor) third is mistuned.<br><br>All of which is very interesting, but says nothing about the<br>subsequent millenium.  Subba Rao allowed for a note in a raga to have<br>more than one sruti interpretation, but I don' t have a reference to<br>hand.  Although he didn't give any examples of how a scale or phrase<br>should be tuned in terms of srutis, the implication is obviously that<br>mistuned consonances can be avoided.<br><br>> To<br>> pretend that Indian singers use major thirds of 436 cents is<br>> contradicted by all the studies I have seen. They may well use an<br>> interval between the major third and perfect fourth for purposes of<br>> ornament, but certainly not as the usual diatonic interval.<br><br>6 of the 17 Sa-Ga intervals measured by Jairazbhoy and Stone in<br>"Intonation in Present Day North Indian Classical Music" are larger<br>than 408 cents, although a 22 note scale is obviously not being used.<br>The largest third of 439 cents is >436.  This comes from the flautist<br>Pannalal Ghosh.  The largest vocal third is 405 cents from Gangoobai<br>Hangal.  None of this contradicts the spirit of what Gregg says.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed) <br>Subject:  19 equal and modal genera<br>PostedDate:  15-12-97 13:35:04<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  15-12-97 13:33:07-15-12-97 13:33:07,15-12-97 13:32:47-15-12-97 13:32:48<br>DeliveredDate:  15-12-97 13:32:48<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656E.0044EFA5; Mon, 15 Dec 1997 13:34:54 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA15801; Mon, 15 Dec 1997 13:35:04 +0100<br>Date: Mon, 15 Dec 1997 13:35:04 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA15578<br>Received: (qmail 1370 invoked from network); 15 Dec 1997 04:33:40 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 15 Dec 1997 04:33:40 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.396283@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
