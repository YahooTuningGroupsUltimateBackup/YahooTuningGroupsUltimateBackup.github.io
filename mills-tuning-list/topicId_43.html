I certainly don't claim to be<br>an expert on piano mechanisms, but whenever I've looked into a grand piano<br>anyway, I could swear that even the low A was a course of two strings.  <br><br>   Anyway, assuming that your memory is better than mine, then I'll give a very<br>nonspecific answer that the partials on real instruments are rarely precisely<br>harmonic.  Also you could well be hearing some comparatively quiet tones in<br>other vibrational modes, possibly tortional.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 28 Sep 1995 13:51 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id EAA16839; Thu, 28 Sep 1995 04:50:46 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 28 Sep 1995 04:50:46 -0700<br>Message-Id: <950928114211_71670.2576_HHB30-4@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
