But then I said <br>> that we cannot simply ignore one of his distinctions, namely between C# <br>> major and Db major; since this distinction cannot arise in any <br>> well-temperament, Beethoven's thinking must have been motivated, at <br>> least in part by less concrete considerations, such as the accumulated <br>> associations of certain keys with certain pieces, or the association of <br>> certain instruments with their most congenial keys, or relational <br>> associations depending on the difference between modulating in a <br>> flat-wards direction and in a sharp-wards direction.

Renaissance theorists were therefore primarily interested in <br>> the use that could be made of Aristoxenus to serve their purposes; the <br>> truth of their interpretation of Aristoxenus was only a secondary <br>> consideration.<br>> <br>> -- <br>> Jonathan Walker<br>> Queen's University Belfast<br>> mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>> http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br>> <br>> <br>> <br>> ------------------------------<br>> <br>> Topic No. 9<br>> <br>> Date: Mon, 10 Mar 1997 13:39:25 +0000<br>> From: kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk (Jonathan Walker)<br>> To: tuning<br>> Subject: Re: winding down on ET<br>> Message-ID: <33240F0D.27CE@cavehill.dnet.co.uk><br>> <br>> Ed Foote (A440A@aol.com) wrote:<br>> <br>> >      Hmmmm.

I suspect by <br>> now that you said all you can on this matter, and I thank you for this. <br>> <br>> My concern is simply that there is not so far any case which would <br>> withstand scrutiny as an academic paper; since your interests are <br>> practical rather than academic, you may not be worried by this. But it <br>> will prove a difficult task, since at present revisionists such as <br>> Rudolf Rasch, are (as Manuel Op de Coul reminded us) prepared even to <br>> say that Bach might indeed have intended the WTK for equal temperament, <br>> notwithstanding all that has been argued to the contrary. If respected <br>> academics are still prepared to place ET (as a keyboard tuning) back <br>> even as far as the 1720s, there is a great deal to be done before we can <br>> hope to establish the counter-thesis that ET didn't begin to emerge as a <br>> practical possibility (for keyboards) until at least a century later. <br>> Whatever the merits of Rasch's case, there is a very long way to go <br>> before the historical case for the prevalence of well-temperament into <br>> the 19th century has been established. There are two routes by which we <br>> can attack the consensual thesis that ET was well-nigh universal in <br>> Germany/Austria by 1800: one is to provide convincing documentary <br>> evidence to the contrary from contemporary sources (I've still seen <br>> nothing in this respect); the other is to shift the burden of proof onto <br>> those following the consensual thesis, by demonstrating that ET was so <br>> far beyond the capabilities of 18th-century tuners that its supposed <br>> establishment by 1800 is most improbable (you have said a couple of <br>> things which move in this direction). Does anyone know of more material, <br>> or can anyone suggest further arguments which would contribute to either <br>> of these possible lines of attack? <br>> <br>> > >Was Chopin (advocate of ET, as I've said before) less than<br>> > >a true musician?<br>> >       No, but Chopin was not composing music in the time of Mozart and<br>> > Beethoven, I assume he cut his teeth on a lot less meantone than <br>> > Beethoven, or Mozart.<br>> <br>> Meantone? Yes, probably 1/6-comma from good string players, and on some <br>> keyboards (it was Silbermann's choice), but I thought we were talking <br>> about well temperament. Was this a typo?<br>> <br>> In any case, would you agree then that for music which modulates freely, <br>> but which remains locally diatonic in most passages (as in Beethoven), <br>> well-temperaments are best, but where local chromaticism becomes more <br>> prevalent (as in later Chopin), then equal temperament is more <br>> satisfactory?<br>> <br>> > (For a real treat, listen to his Opus 28 <br>> > preludes performed on a DeMorgan temperament. It is a very different <br>> > music indeed,  and it could have happened!)<br>> <br>> Definitely a typo here (op. 39 Preludes "durch alle Tonarten"). The date <br>> of composition is thought to have been 1789 -- certainly a later Bonn <br>> work -- so the opus number, 39, is misleading in this respect. In this <br>> case, even if (contrary to your view) ET was prevalent by 1800, there is <br>> still a fairly high probability that in relatively provincial Bonn, well <br>> temperament would still have been much in evidence at this date. Tuning <br>> matters aside, I find it particularly interesting that the two preludes <br>> traverse the circuit of keys in different ways: the first reaches C# <br>> major by fifths, then manages to reverse all of this and more in a <br>> wonderful chromatic passage to arrive on a genuine Db major (genuine in <br>> the sense that it is not just a notational convenience), whereupon the <br>> fifths sequence resumes until the final (genuine) C major is reached. <br>> The second prelude, maintains the fifths sequence throughout, and passes <br>> through the cycle twice, so removing changes due to notational <br>> convenience, we pass from C major to A*# major. The first prelude even <br>> manages to maintain a high level of inventiveness, and deserves to be <br>> heard more often on the concert platform.<br>> <br>> -- <br>> Jonathan Walker<br>> Queen's University Belfast<br>> mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>> http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br>> <br>> <br>> <br>> ------------------------------<br>> <br>> Topic No. 10<br>> <br>> Date: Mon, 10 Mar 1997 11:26:20 -0600<br>> From: William Sethares <sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>> To: tuning<br>> Subject: mapping spectra<br>> Message-ID: <199703101726.AA06357@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>> <br>> <br>> A recent thread reads:<br>> <br>> " Each chemical element is uniquely identifiable in the <br>> electromagnetic spectrum by its special set of unique frequencies.  <br>> These frequency sets interact to produce more complexly unique <br>> cycle frequencies, which are unheard by human ear but which <br>> resonate just as do humanly hearable musical chords or dissonances."<br>> <br>> to which Gary M. replied...<br>> <br>>    Interesting...
