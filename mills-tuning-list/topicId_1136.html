I suppose to some degree<br>that depends on what you mean by "keyboard".  Are you refering to the raw,<br>internal keyboard mechanism (like those by FATAR or whoever) minus the internal<br>electronics and then building a custom electronic and case setup around both?<br>Or by "keyboard" do you mean a complete, off-the-shelf keyboard product, like<br>for example a couple of DX-7s (or whatever) stacked close atop one another?  <br><br>   If you mean the latter, then I see two problems to deal with:<br>1.  The top keyboard will still be quite a bit above the bottom one, to the <br>    point where it's not terribly practical to finger both at the same time.<br>    To a fair degree this applies to the individual mechanisms as well in a <br>    custom case.  The internal mechanisms aren't a whole lot narrower than<br>    finished products.  <br>2.  The top keyboard obscures the control buttons of the lower keyboard.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 14 Nov 1996 16:55 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08877; Thu, 14 Nov 1996 16:56:51 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08618<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id HAA05645; Thu, 14 Nov 1996 07:56:48 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 14 Nov 1996 07:56:48 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009AB5D4CB53C500.262D@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
