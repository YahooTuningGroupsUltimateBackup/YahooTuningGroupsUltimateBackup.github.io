Robert Rich tells me Romana has no plans to write new code for the<br>> PowerMac. If someone out there would like to take the time to write such<br>> code, it would be a simple matter to drop it into JICalc and the JI Ear<br>> Trainer. Any takers?<br><br>We've done plenty of Sound Manager code here, but I'm not quite sure<br>what is needed.  The above URL doesn't respond.

I think I could pick it up from <br>> there....thanks.<br> <br>In answer to Scott Purnham, and on the assumption that <br>others new to the list may have similar queries, I offer <br>here a brief explanation of ratios, JI and 12TET. Apologies <br>to the great majority of list subscribers for cluttering up <br>their mailboxes -- you can skip to the next message.<br><br><br>What are they? -- The ratios of the frequencies of two <br>pitches. 3/2 is a perfect fifth, 5/4 a just major third, <br>81/64 a Pythagorean major third, 81/80 the syntonic comma <br>(difference between 5/4 and 81/64). To decipher the ratios, <br>you must extract the prime factors in the numerator and <br>denominator: e.g.<br><br>		5/4 = 2^-2 * 5^1<br><br>		81/80 = 2^-2 * 3^4 * 5^-1<br><br>"*" is multiplication, "^" is an exponent superscript sign <br>(so 3^4 is three-to-the-power-of-four, i.e. 81). I don't <br>know just how rusty your maths might be, so I'll remind you <br>that the negative exponent x^-1 means 1/x, so 2^-2 is 1/4, <br>while 2^-2 * 5^1 is 5/4. The intervals in JI Ear Trainer are <br>all smaller than an octave, so the numerator of the ratios <br>will always be greater than the denominator, but less than <br>twice the denominator; i.e. the ratios fall between 1/1 <br>(unison) and 2/1 (the octave).<br><br>Since you will be familiar with the harmonic series, this <br>might be the most convenient point of entry. We are not <br>concerned here with absolute frequency, expressed in Hz, but <br>only with frequency relations. Define the fundamental as 1, <br>so the second harmonic, an octave higher has twice the <br>frequency, thus 2/1; the third harmonic, an octave and a <br>fifth higher, has three times the frequency, thus 3/1; the <br>fourth harmonic, two octaves higher is 4/1, i.e. (2^2)/1; <br>the fifth harmonic, two octaves and a (just) major third <br>higher is 5/1.<br><br>If a perfect fifth plus an octave is 3/1, how do you express <br>a perfect fifth alone in ratio terms?  Just as multiplying <br>the frequency by 2 raises a pitch by an octave, so division <br>by 2 lowers a pitch by an octave; thus 3/2 is 3/1 less an <br>octave -- a perfect fifth above the fundamental. How do you <br>express a (just) major third in ratio terms? Since 5/1 is a <br>major third plus two octaves, divide 5 by 4 -- that is, by <br>2^2 -- to bring it down to a major third above the <br>fundamental; 5/4 is therefore a major third. But I also <br>mentioned a Pythagorean major third above; how is this <br>derived? Multiplying a frequency by 3 is equivalent to <br>raising a pitch by an octave and a fifth; now, say your <br>fundamental is C, then 3 times the fundamental is a G, 3^2 <br>or 9 times is a D, 3^3 or 27 times is an A, and 3^4 or 81 <br>times is an E -- this is the 81st harmonic. In order to <br>bring this E within the octave above the fundamental, we'll <br>have to descend by six octaves, so we divide 81 by 2^6 or <br>64, hence the ratio 81/64 for the Pythagorean major third.<br><br>How is the 81/64 third related to the 5/4 third? To find <br>which is higher, express the two ratios in terms of a common <br>denominator: thus we have 81/64 to compare with 80/64 -- <br>this means that the Pythagorean third is higher. To express <br>the difference in ratio terms, divide 81/64 by 5/4; this is <br>equivalent to 81/64 * 4/5, which equals 81/80, i.e. the <br>syntonic comma I mentioned above. You can now manipulate the <br>ratios accordingly, without reference to the harmonic <br>series. Such ratios were in any case discussed by music <br>theorists long before the harmonic series and the frequency <br>of sound-waves were understood: the Chinese took the <br>relative lengths of bamboo pipes as their conceptual <br>starting-point, Pythagoras the relative weights of hammers, <br>and thereafter the divisions of a string became the most <br>common means of conceptualising ratios (the monochord of <br>mediaeval and Renaissance musicians was such a device -- it <br>was never intended for performance).<br><br>So far I've left "Pythagorean" and "just" undefined, but we <br>now have the means to rectify this. A Pythagorean interval <br>is expressible in terms of a ratio that includes only 2 and <br>3 (and their powers) in the numerator and denominator. A <br>just interval will have a ratio that also includes 5 (and <br>its powers) in the numerator and denominator. "Extended just <br>intonation" includes prime numbers higher than 5. Partch's <br>terminology is the most lucid for such purposes: Pythagorean <br>intervals are 3-limit intervals, just intervals are 5-limit, <br>while Partch used an 11-limit system. Note that each higher <br>number limit includes the previous limit, so the 3-limit <br>intervals form a proper subset of the 5-limit set; each <br>sytem is, theoretically speaking, an infinite set of <br>intervals (this doesn't conflict with the fact that one can <br>be a subset of another). A quick test of the knowledge so <br>far gained: express the major seventh in ratio terms, within <br>the 5-limit system. Just as we can construct such an <br>interval by adding a perfect fifth and a major third (in <br>this case, just), so we multiply 3/2 and 5/4, to obtain <br>15/8.<br><br>Finally, a word on the intervals of12-note equal temperament <br>(12TET); these are irrational proportions, so we will have <br>to abandon ratio terminology. The tuning system is <br>constructed upon that proportion which, when multiplied by <br>itself 12 times, equals 2. Thus we have to find an interval <br>above 1/1, the starting pitch, twelve of which will make up <br>an octave, i.e. 2/1. That interval is the twelfth root of 2 <br>above the 1/1 starting point, the starting frequency <br>multiplied by 2^(1/12) -- that is, two to the power of a <br>twelfth, or the twelfth root of two. Thus the equal tempered <br>semitone is the proportion (2^[1/12])/1. How is the 12TET <br>perfect fifth expressed in such terms? Since this fifth is <br>seven 12TET semitones above an initial pitch, we want the <br>seventh power of the twelfth root of 2, i.e. (2^[1/12])^7 = <br>2^(7/12). How can this be compared to the 3/2 perfect fifth? <br>Simply find the decimal value of each; you'll find the 3/2 <br>is very slightly higher. The 12TET system was adopted as a <br>tuning convenience in the late 18th/early 19th centuries in <br>Europe because it provided a good approximation of the <br>common 3-limit intervals, and a tolerable -- or at least <br>recognizable -- approximation of the 5-limit intervals. An <br>equivalent method for constructing 12TET is to find the <br>difference between 12 fifths and 7 octaves (the Pythagorean <br>comma), and remove the twelfth root of this difference from <br>each fifth; from this the "circle of fifths" is artificially <br>derived. Each 12TET fifth will therefore be 3/2 divided by <br>the twelfth root of the Pythagorean comma; I'll leave you to <br>prove for yourself that this is equivalent to 2^(7/12).<br><br>-- <br>Jonathan Walker<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 20 Sep 1996 12:20 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07871; Fri, 20 Sep 1996 12:21:58 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06325<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id DAA24800; Fri, 20 Sep 1996 03:21:55 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 20 Sep 1996 03:21:55 -0700<br>Message-Id: <009A8A7640C705C0.F61C@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
