LSI still had to be amplified. Two long<br>droning instrumentals from the CD Suspended Music (Periplum P0010 )<br>were performed, Epigraphs in the Time of AIDS by Pauline Oliveros and<br>TexasTravelTexture by Ellen Fullman.<br><br>The Long String Instrument is just that: 175 long wire strings played<br>in just intonation by Ellen Fullman, Jessica Lurie and Matthew Sperry.<br>As<br>they move along the instrument, they "bow" the strings with rosin<br>sticky hands. Numbered lines on the floor are reference marks for the<br>performers to play the strings. At times the LSI sounds a bit<br>like an accordion as well as bowed strings.<br><br>The Deep Listening Band has been around for a few years in different<br>combinations. Usually DLB are: Pauline Oliveros (accordion in just<br>intonation, conch, voice, electronics), Stuart Dempster (trombone,<br>didjeridu, conch, garden hose, voice, electronics) and now David<br>Gamper (overtone flutes, ocarina, electronics). They spent the concert<br>making little noises into the Expanded Instrument System, a local<br>area network of Macintosh computers and high end Lexicon DSP.<br><br>Stuart Dempster performed JDBBBDJ on a large brass didjeridu,<br>the audience was encouraged to sing along to the massive drone.<br><br>DJ Spooky managed to horn his way in to the program with<br>a *remix* of previously released DLB & Oliveros recordings<br>that he accompanied on an electric upright bass. Effectively<br>destroying whatever meditative mood that was established for the<br>evening, on the third night he actually performed this set with<br>the DLB.<br><br><br>My review of last Fridays Kronos Quartet concert can be found at:<br><br>http://www.virtulink.com/immp/jux/j_index.htm<br><br><br>--<br>* D a v i d        B e a r d s l e y<br>*           xouoxno@virtulink.com<br>*<br>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br>*<br>* http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</div>
