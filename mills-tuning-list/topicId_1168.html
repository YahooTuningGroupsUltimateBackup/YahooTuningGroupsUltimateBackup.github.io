I have<br>worked with him a fair amount since Ivor Darreg's death united some of our<br>efforts.  <br><br>   Here are my personal impressions of Brian with regard to how to read his<br>commentaries:<br>1.  Brian is definitely a bit cynical, but he's not USUALLY vindictive.  <br>2.  Brian often gets too closely focused in on one tiny aspect of a bigger, <br>    more complex topic, and will talk about that one topic in extreme words.<br>    And it's not always negative either, although unfortunately it often is.<br>    I have heard him do a similar "ranting" style, but in almost worshipful<br>    superlatives.  That is also why Brian can change from trashing out David<br>    Doty's views of tuning as a whole, to superlative praise of his book on<br>    JI in less than a month:  When he zooms down to the 100x-magnification<br>    question of whether the theory behind JI is infallible, a handful of <br>    seemingly minor flaws come out as horrible warts on that scale, and he'll<br>    procede to describe how ugly those warts look at 100-times magnification.<br>    And then he'll zoom at 100x magnification on the issue of how well Doty<br>    explains the ideas behind JI (regardless of whether they are flawlessly <br>    true or not), and raves in in superlatives about how clearly Doty <br>    explains the concepts.  <br>3.  He's very insightful despite the fact that his words read kind of like a<br>    TV image with the color-intensity knob turned up to about thirteen times <br>    as high as you would see with your eyes!  MOST of the time, although <br>    certainly FAR from invariably, his colorful language is INTENDED to amuse<br>    rather than torment.  Once I look beyond his prose lit up like flourescent<br>    colors under a blacklight, he often has a lot of very valuable insights.<br><br>   So what I'm saying is, if Brian's words get too colorful for you, try to play<br>them back on a black-and-white TV first before you conclude that he hates you.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 15 Nov 1996 11:04 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11385; Fri, 15 Nov 1996 11:05:45 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11467<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id CAA18356; Fri, 15 Nov 1996 02:05:42 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 15 Nov 1996 02:05:42 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961115100113_71670.2576_HHB42-5@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
