Here are the MIDI files."<br>"No, I mean SCORES.  Real SCORES."<br>"The MIDI files are the scores."<br>"No, I mean *SCORES*..."<br>And so on.<br>Years and years ago, it became clear to me that<br>[1] no one was going to perform my non-12 music,<br>which didn't matter in the slightest because<br>[2] it was *impossible* to perform my non-12 music<br>even if anyone wanted to (care to gather together<br>an orchestral ensemble capable of performing in<br>the 21st root of 17?  I'll wait while you hacksaw<br>the clarinets and blowtorch the trombones... Oh,<br>yes, we'll need a tempo track for every member of<br>the orchestra too...)<br>[3] Using a computer to store MIDI sequences allows<br>compositional techniques essentially impossible to<br>notate meaningfully in traditional western ways.<br>Example: You've got a 46 tone equal tempered scale<br>with a canon in which the follower uses notes 60%<br>f the leader and in which the second voice uses<br>notes 70% of the leader.  This is not just measure-by-<br>measure, mind you, but in fact tempos of 100% against<br>60% against 70%.  This is 56 tone #1 from <br>side 2, McLaren - Microtonal Music Vol. 2.  <br>There is no way to write this piece down using<br>conventional western notation without so distorting<br> the notation by tying notes across barlines and<br>using bizarre accidentals that the structure of the <br>piece would be completely and utterly obscured. <br>Thus, the notation for my compositions is: the<br>original MIDI files.<br>This is a radical stance.<br>It makes possible many compositional processes<br>impossibly difficult in traditional performance<br>situations--multiple simultaneous tempo streams<br>which change from one tempo to another...multiple<br>time signatures with enormous simultaneous<br>accelerando or decelerando...a precise control over<br>xenharmonic pitch unavilable with traditional human<br>performers.<br>This control comes at a price.  The resulting score<br>exists only as digital information on a computer<br>disk: in almost all cases, the score cannot be<br>usefully transcribed into standard notation.<br>This is viewed as a severe disadvantage by a<br>number of people who don't seem to realize that<br>notation imposes hidden constraints on the composer.<br>When you agree to work in standard notation, you<br>automatically agree to a huge number of contraints<br>on your composition--you agree that there are a<br>lot of things you simply won't do.  <br>Having no interest in making any such agreement,<br>it seems obvious to me that multiple simultaneous<br>time signatures, tempo streams, accelerandi/<br>decelerandi, multiple simultaneous tunings and<br>hocketing impossible in a real-world performance<br>are the absolute minimum any imaginative<br>composer would settle for.<br>Thus, my radical stance remains unchanged--the<br>score is the MIDI file.  There is no "real" score<br>other than the MIDI file.  The digital information<br>itself *IS* the score for the xenharmonic composition.<br>With the advent of computers, traditional music<br>notation is obsolete.  That's life. <br>Get over it.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 4 Sep 1996 18:53 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA19497; Wed, 4 Sep 1996 18:54:33 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA19505<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA04788; Wed, 4 Sep 1996 09:54:31 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 4 Sep 1996 09:54:31 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9609041244.A23917-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
