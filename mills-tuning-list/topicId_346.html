The<br>first side was in 88CET, and the second was in 12TET.  <br><br>   Lemme tellya, I was thoroughly impressed!  As with when Bill Sethares and<br>Warren Burt did 88CET compositions, I learned a LOT from hearing Paul's approach<br>to it.  Perhaps others will as well.  The best way I can describe it<br>stylistically doesn't do it justice, but I would say that it has qualites of<br>Wendy Carlos, Jean-Michel Jarre, and perhaps Laurie Anderson.  Of the three,<br>it's probably most like Jean-Michel Jarre, but like I said, that comparison<br>alone doesn't do it justice.  <br><br>   To me, it was probably especially interesting texturally and in terms of the<br>overall sound (mood) that the tuning gave it.  It was perhaps a little less<br>interesting melodically or formally.  But most of it has a marvelously catchy<br>and reasonably innovative underlying "beat".  <br><br>   Timbrally speaking, it mostly concentrates on electronic sounds.  I heard<br>what sounded to my ears to be sounds of analog, sampling, and a probably a bit<br>of FM synthesis.  The more distictive sounds to my ears were analog-sounding<br>(notably resonant filter sweeps and such).  <br><br>   Timbrally- and, to a slightly lesser degree, stylistically-speaking, there's<br>a fair amount of variety in this music.  But I especially the variety of<br>textures and beats in it.  <br><br>   I didn't hear much to complain about in it, and a lot to enjoy.  Probably the<br>only thing I would view as a little weak is the structure and form.  As any one<br>piece completes, it's sometimes a little difficult to think back about the<br>journey it put you on.  But, in my eyes, that's only a moderate concern at<br>worst, and not a concern at all at best.  <br><br>   Good work, Paul!  Perhaps you could be so kind as to post your address for<br>others who might want to hear it?  (And for me too, since I seem to have lost it<br>somehow!)  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 17 Feb 1996 05:38 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id UAA25236; Fri, 16 Feb 1996 20:37:57 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 16 Feb 1996 20:37:57 -0800<br>Message-Id: <960217043029_71670.2576_HHB74-11@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
