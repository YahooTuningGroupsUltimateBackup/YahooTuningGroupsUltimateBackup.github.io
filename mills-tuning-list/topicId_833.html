Now, as a diploma-carrying PhD and therefore,<br>target, of the latest broadside, I feel it opportune to respond.<br><br>The regurgitation of PNM articles from thirty or more years ago reflect<br>neither an understanding of the situation then nor the situation now. To<br>make E. Krenek an arbitrator of musical sense is rather far-fetched.<br>Neither he, his music, nor his theories gained a significant following -<br>with an audience or with academics - during his lifetime, and it is<br>reasonable to assume that this will not change in the future. <br> <br>McLaren fails to discriminate between very different conceptual foundations<br>of serial music, differences that his quoted source evidence clearly. The<br>confusion of American (e.g. Babbit) and European (Nono, Stockhausen,<br>Boulez) serialisms is simply an error: two entirely different projects were<br>at work. In the US, Babbitt, following late (American - and at the time<br>unknown in Europe) Schoenberg practices, attempted to make a music where a<br>certain structure was replicated throughout  a work, and used non-pitch<br>"parameters" to attempt to "project" this structure to the material as<br>clearly as possible. Babbitt has constantly revised his projection<br>techniques in a reasonable search for clearer solutions to a deep<br>perceptual problem. (Though I am by no means a "serialist", I find it very<br>easy to follow the most basic structural details in Babbittï¿½s music,<br>particularly aggregate formation - somewhat like harmonic rhythm in tonal<br>music, and hexachord content - which strikes my ears as something like the<br>Major-minor distinction in tonal music). If Mr McLaren had made a close<br>reading of the Backus review, he would surely have realized that Backus had<br>intended to write a polemic in support of PNM-style positivism and against<br>the "mystical" tendancies of Die Reihe.<br><br>On the other hand, the Europeans never had a single project identifiable as<br>"Darmstadt" (although I have used the term myself): the later works of<br>Stockhausen, Boulez, Nono have made the distinctions among the earlier<br>works much clearer. Stockhausen rapidly turned to more "informal"<br>arrangements, Boulez to performance practice, and Nono to politics,<br>concrete sounds, and late in his life, traditional tonal materials. (It is<br>worth noting that both Stockhausen and Nono made "microtonal" works,<br>Stockhausen quite formally, and Nono - quartertones - as a way of breaking<br>the musical surface). Further, the Darmstadt of 1964 that Milton Babbitt<br>attended was dominated by such "texturalists" as Kagel and Ligeti. The<br>European serialisms were never interested in Babbitonian details of set<br>structure and were always more concerned with overt - traditional - musical<br>effects. Europeans had faced the problem of a complete break in their<br>musical history due to the war, and the use of "negation" of traditional<br>musical sensibilities and appeal to "scientific" language were attempts to<br>regain some of the dignity that was lost during the war. Further, to<br>identify Cage, who visited once in the 1950ï¿½s and then was essentially<br>banned until 1990, with Darmstadt, is to make an historical error of<br>massive proportions.<br><br>If I am able to find any point of commonality among these very different<br>musicians, it is this, they have all demonstrated the ability to use<br>creative self-criticism to create new works, a kind of self-criticism<br>lacking in Mr McLarenï¿½s writings. I hope that Mr McLaren will eventually<br>develop a degree of tolerence for the musics and theories not of his own<br>culture or makings at least equivalent to the degree of tolerance he<br>expects from those paying to download his lengthly wordprocessings. This<br>tolerence might then precede any attempt on his part to criticize things he<br>does not yet fully understand.<br><br>Please accept that this message come from a patient reader, who, in the<br>past has tolerated a great deal of nonsense in the service of better<br>musical intonation (and even a lengthy period of proselytizing among the<br>non-12 community by a member of a notorious sect - thereï¿½s a real scam for<br>you), but I do have my limits, and they have been reached: this reader will<br>stop reading McLaren.<br><br>Daniel Wolf (PhD), Frankfurt<br><br>PS Allow me to add the fact that Iï¿½ve tolerated an awful lot of<br>improvisation under the guise of "premeditated" performances, to come to<br>understand that an essential feature of composition is erasure, something<br>not possible in improvisation, no matter how "premediated". I have no<br>problem with the idea of a midi file as notation, but I reserve the right<br>to criticize the contents of said file on compositional grounds,<br>particularly the lack of editing: life is too short to fill with such<br>unfinished work.     <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 5 Sep 1996 09:34 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA20545; Thu, 5 Sep 1996 09:35:40 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA20594<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id AAA02931; Thu, 5 Sep 1996 00:35:39 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 5 Sep 1996 00:35:39 -0700<br>Message-Id: <009A7E95B7EC8900.18B5@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
