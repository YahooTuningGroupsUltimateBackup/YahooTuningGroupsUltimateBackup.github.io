Whoever<br>said this aparrently did not do their homework, since I have found a Roland<br>Super JD module (if anyone is interested, write me and I'll go back to the<br>studio to check the model number) which allows any "part"--that's "voice"<br>to most of us--to be tuned in increments of +/- 64ths of a tempered<br>semitone.  This is in the form of an octave=repeating pitch-class tuning<br>table.  Also, some of their patches seems to have a background layer tuned<br>in quarter-tones (like their "telephone" sound-effect), so I'll bet that<br>extended scales can be done--I just don't know how.<br><br>It's not ideal, but is a great boon for people who like Roland sounds,<br>which are much slicker than those found on the Proteus.<br><br>Another methond of microtuning synths that has not been mentioned is to<br>build a scale note-by-note as a "drum kit."  I know that some Yamahas allow<br>both coarse and fine detuning on a note-by-note basis in their "drum kits,"<br>and perhaps other brands will permit this as well.<br><br>_________________<br>Adam B.
