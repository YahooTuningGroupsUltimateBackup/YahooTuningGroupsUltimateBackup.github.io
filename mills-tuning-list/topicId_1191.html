I can't speak for STEIM but I<br>know Sonology because I've worked there. The Institute of Sonology is<br>not an independent institute but a department of the Royal Conservatory.<br>Do you expect a state conservatory to become entrepreneurial? That's not<br>a matter of attitude. A school's task is education, using tax money for<br>unsure investments is not.
