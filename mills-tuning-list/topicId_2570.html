I almost improvised it, and when I analyzed it later, I was<br>>pretty amazed at how coherent it looked. It has nothing to do with what I<br>>originally chose 22 for, but sometimes the wrong reasons can lead to the<br>>right actions.<br>><br>      >He also may or may not wish to know that one of the first tunings<br>I'm going<br>>to map to my generalized keyboard (when I get it) will be 22 equal.<br><br>Great! What is this generalized keyboard you're getting? I had a hell of<br>a time stretching my hands to play that piece.<br>><br>>>>Today is my last day as a full-time employee of an investment company. I<br>>>>already spend almost all my free time playing music...<br>><br>>>So how is that working out?  Are you able to resist the temptation of<br>>>playing with your 12 tone friends enough to go home and be microtonal?<br>><br>>Not yet, but I have at least one friend who's getting good at 22-tone kbd.<br>><br>>>To paraphrase: If you've got two frequencies represented by a ratio in<br>>>lowest terms whose decimal value is between 1 and 2, then the period of the<br>>>composite waveform of these two frequencies is the product of the two<br>>>numbers in the ratio.  I believe this makes a more useful definition of<br>>>Consonance than any other I've ever heard.  If somebody's got one they think<br>>>I havn't heard, please share.<br>><br>>Of course. This definition doesn't even make sense if the frequencies are at<br>>an irrational interval, as in any equal temperament. Some good definitions of<br>>consonance are to be found in Journal of the Acoustical Society of America<br>>articles by Plomp and Levelt, Kameoka and Kuriagawa, and Terhardt.<br>><br>>>This definition is independent of what a person may or may not hear, and it<br>>>is independent of how they might like or dislike what they hear.  For those<br>>>of you who do not view these as assets, don't use this definition.<br>><br>>As a musican, I am ultimately concerned only with what people can actually<br>>hear. The rest is pure intellectualization (or mythology). Yes, it can _feel_<br>>like you can feel music with your whole body, or with an extended body the<br>>size of the universe, but once you shut off your ears the whole effect<br>>disappears (I'm baiting Neil).<br>><br>>>The ear has a limit of resolution, just like anything else.  That the one<br>>>example given by Mr. Erlich is beyond the ear's resolution does not mean<br>>>that this definition has no practical application.  Clorox is poison but<br>>>lots of folk find it useful to chlorinate their water.  I think the<br>>>practical usefulness of the definition is obvious.<br>><br>>I'm with you so far.<br>><br>>>While I can't hear the difference between a 3/2 and a 300001/200001, I can<br>>>hear the difference between a 19/16 and a [19723/16585.]<br>>>I'm listening to it<br>>>right now.  But I've been told that an error of 2 cents is not significant<br>>>when comparing tempered intervals to just ones.<br>><br>>Just because you can hear it doesn't mean it's an important musical<br>>difference. Let's talk about beating, since you brought it up. Let's assume<br>>the lower note is A440. Both 19/16 and 19723/16585 have significant beating<br>>between the 6th harmonic of the lower note and the 5th harmonic of the higher<br>>note. The rates of beating are 27.5 Hz and 23.744 Hz, respectively. Between<br>>the 13th harmonic of the lower note and the 11th harmonic of the higher note,<br>>the rates of beating are 27.5 Hz and 35.762 Hz, respectively. Finally, if the<br>>19th harmonic is actually audible, the rates of beating between the 19th<br>>harmonic of the lower note and the 16th of the upper note are 0 and 12.018<br>>Hz, respectively. This, alone in the cloud of beating of other harmonics, is<br>>the only significant difference.<br>><br>>But why use 19723/16585 to represent the fourth root of two? It's only an<br>>approximation! Had we used 44/37 instead, our beat rates would be 23.784,<br>>35.676, and 11.892. Is there any audible difference between 44/37 and<br>>19723/16585 and the fourth root of two? Does the relative<br>>complexity/existence of the ratios for these three intervals mean anything<br>>for how they sound?<br>><br>>>Working within the practical limits of human hearing, the perception of<br>>>subtle mis-tuning is very sensitive to the timbres used, the voicing of the<br>>>intervals, how high the identities are, and how they are used in combination<br>>>with other intervals.<br>><br>>And most of all, how long the sound lasts!<br>><br>>>If your timbres have a high degree of inharmonicity, you'll loose<br>>>resolution.  Don't use bowed strings for high resolution work.<br>><br>>Bowed strings are not inharmonic.<br>><br>>>If your<br>>>interval is down in the lowest octave of the piano, don't expect to hear a<br>>>10 cent difference.  You're much less likely to notice a 3/2 2 cents off<br>>>than a 11/7 mistuned by 2 cents.  You can't hear the difference between a<br>>>3/2 and 700 cents in a melody, but in an otherwise just triad, it sticks out<br>>>like a sore thumb.<br>><br>>>So my original point was:  When comparing an equal-step tuning to a just<br>>>tuning on a broad, theoretical level, define Consonance on a broad<br>>>theoretical level.<br>><br>>Such as: a few simple-integer ratios, plus a band of allowable mistuning<br>>around each of them? That's the type of thinking behind my posts, and to<br>>which you seemed to object so strongly. What are your arguments against it?<br>><br>>>My other original point was: Equal step tunings have nothing to apologize<br>>>for.  I don't view them as imitating just tunings.  They're a different<br>>>breed of cat.  The kind of music that makes sense in an equal temperament<br>>>doesn't make sense in JI and vice versa.  It's like apples and oranges.<br>><br>>And don't forget meantone (the pear?). But I think JI is simply an ideal<br>>tuning for harmonic consonance, and the harmonic consonance of any other<br>>tuning depends solely on how closely it approximates JI. For melodic (let<br>>alone modulatory or fingering) considerations, JI is not ideal.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "David Worrall" <drw@stimpy.anu.edu.au><br>Subject:  Re: more consonance and dissonance<br>PostedDate:  25-10-97 03:19:14<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  25-10-97 03:18:19-25-10-97 03:18:19,25-10-97 02:18:57-25-10-97 02:18:57<br>DeliveredDate:  25-10-97 02:18:57<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125653B.0007299D; Sat, 25 Oct 1997 03:18:14 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA26997; Sat, 25 Oct 1997 03:19:14 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 25 Oct 1997 03:19:14 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA26988<br>Received: (qmail 25560 invoked from network); 24 Oct 1997 18:19:10 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 24 Oct 1997 18:19:10 -0700<br>Message-Id: <9710251118.ZM20906@simba><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
