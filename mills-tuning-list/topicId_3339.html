I feel stupid, and there's no cancel-bot...<br><br>Re my previous fretting over frets:<br><br>I did a little experimentation when I got home and realised that<br>trying to make a fretboard with routerbits and rods and such is a big<br>step [can you say "understatement"?] up from the saw and hammer and<br>wire approach.  Talk about biting off more than I could have chewed!<br>Anyhow, bag that idea -- I'm sure some of you could pull it off, but<br>if it were within my grasp, I'd have built an instrument to put it on<br>by now.  Even then, I've no way of knowing whether a board made from<br>all those little precision-cut pieces glued together would even<br>be "worth it".   <br><br>See -- I wasn't kidding when I said I'd hit my limits, though I guess<br>I should add understanding the nature of my materials to that. Guess<br>I'll stay with the tried and true (though I'm still interested in<br>whether there's stainless fretwire out there).<br><br>Always open for ideas and suggestions of any kind, though.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Steve</div>
