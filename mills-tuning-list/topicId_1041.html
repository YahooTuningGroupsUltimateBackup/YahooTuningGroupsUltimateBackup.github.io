I've never heard anybody else use<br>>it, though I was glad when I discovered the Alternate Tuning mailing<br>>list had come up with the same idea in naming themselves.  Under that<br>>concept, 12-TET just becomes one valid alternative among an infinity of<br>>tonal possibilities.<br><br>Even though you invented the term to mean something and all, Id like to add<br>my 2 cents to a definition.  There is Tonality, and from that - atonality,<br>polytonality and bitonality etc.  These words with tonality in them<br>describe sorts of composition methods, tricks and hints etc.  Allotonality<br>might be the strange methods enabled by alternative tuning systems.<br>rick<br><br>---<br>   E am not especially clever,  just basically very average,  E merely try<br>   to maximise thee effectiveness of whatever gifts or abilities E have by<br>   focusing them towards what E want to happen.<br>                                                Genesis P-Orridge<br>finger for PGP pub key                          9 Jul 81   TGHQGB<br><br>pLUNDERaNDaSSIMILATEtHEhISTORYoFmUSIC       http://garlic.com/~ribarbe/vth<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 4 Nov 1996 23:26 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00440; Mon, 4 Nov 1996 23:27:48 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00438<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id OAA03043; Mon, 4 Nov 1996 14:27:45 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 4 Nov 1996 14:27:45 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9611041717.A5393-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
