I suspect that, over the next few <br>months, the NRC librarians will think I've never retired!<br><br>However, as I read your posts, you consider that the preference <br>of musicians for stretched intervals shows a failure of <br>psychoacoustic theory. I disagree.<br><br>"If music sounds dead, it isn't music" is a maxim that all <br>musicians keep forefront in mind. We don't want our sounds to <br>be dull=pure, so we deliberately skirt the edges of consonance <br>at stases, and go beyond them at regular intervals to give our <br>phrases shape. We are limited in our ability to do this with <br>simultaneous intervals when we want a tonality to our sound, <br>but even then can treat sequential intervals much more freely. <br>Is not masking theory consistent with higher pitches sounding <br>more prominent than lower, hence being preferable for this <br>purpose? And, acceptable pitch change, not just consonance, is <br>very dependent upon timbre and pitch as I hear it. The <br>considerable variations in interval stretching that you cite <br>may be more consistent than you believe.<br><br>I am certain that musical language speaks to very different <br>parts of our brain than consonance and tonality do, and it <br>seems to me that psychoacousticians knowingly focus on the <br>latter because it is obvious that the former is so much an <br>artefact of learned culture and less productive of <br>scientifically-describable results. Such a focus is not a <br>failure - "theories of everything" are illusions (or <br>delusions) even in high-energy physics, and ludicrous in the <br>context of the complexity of living things. After all, our <br>ears evolved to aid us in the complex job of survival, not so <br>we could enjoy music!<br><br>Musicians choose instruments, then audiences choose musicians. I <br>consider the widespread assumption that trained musicians must <br>be eliminated from psychoacoustic studies to be the opposite <br>of the truth if results are to be applicable to real-life <br>music. For example, musicians make bass sounds with far more <br>harmonics in timbre than they select for treble sounds. I <br>submit that a major reason for this is so that acceptable <br>changes in pitch produce equivalent dissonance across the <br>gamut of the instrument. Instruments that did not do this (and <br>there are many) have been selected out of the repertoire by <br>musicians' choice. This is a testable hypothesis (BTW, if this <br>hasn't already been studied and anyone is interested in <br>collaboration, email me) whereas the character of the desire <br>for such dissonance is probably a much more elusive quantity. <br>The preference of the musically naive for "boom boxes" stands <br>in notable contrast. This might turn out to be solely because <br>musicians concentrate on musical language more than on <br>consonance - we do seem to keep very different areas of the <br>brain active during listening than naive listeners.<br><br>And, when considering pitch in ensembles, don't forget the role <br>of competition. Everyone wants their sound to stand out from <br>others but still sound professional. The perennial jockeying <br>for leading pitch in ensembles arises from very different <br>brain centers than those studied by psychoacousticians!<br><br><br>--<br>John Sankey              bf250@freenet.carleton.ca<br>Music is Beauty, Beauty is Truth, Truth is Freedom<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 22 Oct 1995 16:43 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA28370; Sun, 22 Oct 1995 07:42:36 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 22 Oct 1995 07:42:36 -0700<br>Message-Id:  <9510220741.aa05395@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
