Basically it means that <br>the scale has no overlapping interval classes, i.e. that the largest <br>2nd is less than or equal to the smallest third for all melodic seconds <br>(intervals between adjacent tones) and melodic thirds (intervals between <br>every other tones), irrespective of their acoustical size  and similarly <br>for all scale interval classes.<br> <br>His other contribution to scale theory is his application of Group Theory <br>to scale generation. In analogy with the major mode in 12, Balzano created <br>a class of scales partitionable into chains of triads of the form 0 k 2k+1 <br>and 0 k+1 2k+1, where k and k+1 are the number of scale degrees in the <br>mediant and conjugate-mediant ("Thirds") and 2k+1 is the dominant of <br>the triads, following Riemann's and Lewin's terminology. The "chromatic" <br>sets C thus have k(k+1) or k^2 +k tones, the generators (G) of the <br>diatonic sets have 2k+1 tones  and the diatonic sets (D) have 2k+1 tones.<br>The K and k+1 are also the generators of groups of cardinality C. <br> <br>Hence for 12-tet, k = 3, k+1 = 4, 2k+1 = 7, k^2+k = 12. Balzano studied <br>the case where k = 4, 5, and 6 and mentioned k=8 briefly. These correspond <br>to equal temperaments of 20, 30, 42, and 72 tones (56 is presumably <br>included). The diatonic sets and their generators have 9, 11, 13, and 17 <br>tones respectively (15 for k = 7). <br> <br>There are several problems with this theory. The set of predicted scales <br>misses several harmonically much better tunings by 1 degree with the  exceptions of 12 and 72-tet (19, 31, 41, also 29 and 43 are better by most<br>criteria than 20, 30 and 42). Secondly, the triads are continually <br>shrinking as k gets larger, and the number of tones in the scale compared <br>to the number in the chromatic set also decreases. For example, in 72-tet, <br>only 17 of the 72 tones are in the scale, leaving the remaining 55 tones <br>as auxiliaries, alternates, or ornaments. The triads 0 8 17 and 0 9 17 are <br>essentially tone clusters of 0 133.3 283.3 and  0 150 283.3 cents. The <br>scale itself, consisting of 4 repeated blocks of  5 4 4 4 degrees and a <br>final interval of 4 degrees, is coherent (actually, strictly proper), <br>however. It is an MOS (as are all of Balzan's scales), though not a <br>"deep scale" (Winograd, Gamer, L= C/2 or C/2+1). <br> <br>One might modify the theory and increase the number of "thirds" in the <br>basic chords and harmonize with 7th chords, whole-tone scales, etc. <br>(as did Yasser in 19-tet). Another possibility is to lengthen the chain <br>of generators to produce larger MOS's. Eleven tones out of 20-tet is a<br> better analog of the major scale than are 9, which really belong in <br>16-tet, assuming a fifth-like generator. By 11 out of 30, one is already <br>into an essentially non-diatonic realm of scales.<br> <br>All in all, Balzano's is an extremely interesting theory, which should be <br>tried compositionally (I believe a visiting composer at UCSD did write a <br>piece using larger chords in 20-tet, but I've not heard it).<br> <br>--John<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 4 Mar 1996 00:47 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id PAA13018; Sun, 3 Mar 1996 15:46:54 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 3 Mar 1996 15:46:54 -0800<br>Message-Id: <9603031533198731@csst.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
