As it took me a while to sort this<br>out, I'll share my thoughts with the list.<br><br>First, the sruti scale I'm using is:<br><br>        s p r p s p r p s|p r p s|s p r p s p r p s<br><br>With s a limma, r a chromatic semitone and p a syntonic comma.

Setting a diaschisma=0 means s=r.<br><br>Most of the scales work as 5-limit harmony with the just version<br>of this scale.  In some cases the schismic and diaschismic<br>approximations both work.  The following scale doesn't make sense<br>to me:<br><br>3 2 4 3 2 4 4   Gandhaara Grama (Sarngadeva der. ma-grama)<br><br>I suggest that Pa should be flat by p rather than s, so that the<br>interval of 3 steps separating the tetrachords is a minor tone.<br>Either this uses a different version of the sruti scale, or it is<br>assumed that people will guess the correct tuning.  Or, my<br>interpretation is wrong.<br><br><br>This scale works as a diaschismic but not a schismic scale:<br><br>2 6 1 4 2 6 1   Raga Bhairav<br><br>I'm assuming the intervals of 6 steps should be just minor thirds,<br>but I have no proof of this.<br><br><br>I think the following scales imply schismic tuning:<br><br>1 4 6 2 1 7 1   Raga Todi<br>1 7 1 4 2 2 4 1 Raga Saurastra<br>1 4 7 1 1 6 2   Raga Varali<br><br>The intervals of 7 steps aren't right for diaschismic major thirds,<br>so I'm assuming they should be schismic minor thirds.  The upper<br>tetrachord of Varali suggests the same _diaschismic_ approximation<br>as in Bhairav above!  That's consistent with the sruti scale being<br>a kind of well temperament with no single interpretation.<br>Because the tonic is always sruti 0, you don't have to worry<br>about transpositional invariance, so this sort of thing is<br>allowed.  Then again, the 6 steps could denote a Pythagorean<br>minor third (5 -3)H.<br><br><br>There are also some that may have 7-prime-limit intervals.

This can't be a minor tone.<br>I suggest it should be the interval (-1 1 1 -1)H or 15/14.  It<br>can be better represented as either r+r+p or s+p.  The two are<br>identical in a schismic temperament, and the former is the<br>diaschismic equivalent of 2s+p.  One of the other 3's will be<br>(2 0 -2 1)H to compensate.  It's also possible that all the 3's<br>are supposed to be roughly equal intervals, and no 7-limit<br>interpretation is intended.<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net<br>Subject:  2-D FFTs<br>PostedDate:  06-09-97 01:15:48<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  06-09-97 01:15:55-06-09-97 01:15:56,06-09-97 01:15:28-06-09-97 01:15:28<br>DeliveredDate:  06-09-97 01:15:28<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256509.007FC8E7; Sat, 6 Sep 1997 01:15:45 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA15687; Sat, 6 Sep 1997 01:15:48 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 6 Sep 1997 01:15:48 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA15690<br>Received: (qmail 18551 invoked from network); 5 Sep 1997 23:15:38 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 5 Sep 1997 23:15:38 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541100b0354f9d3d9e@[207.207.3.113]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6054 href="#6054">ðŸ”—</a>apotome@freemail.nl</h3><span>9/5/1997 4:18:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Graham Breed wrote:<br>> The following scale doesn't make sense<br>> to me:<br>> 3 2 4 3 2 4 4   Gandhaara Grama (Sarngadeva der. ma-grama)<br><br>That's not so surprising.
