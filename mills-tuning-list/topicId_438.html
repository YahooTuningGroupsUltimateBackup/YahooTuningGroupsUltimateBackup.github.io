None, <br>appears to be the answer, apart from the musical inspiration of Hal Willner - during the development of the project, Willner says he constructed some sequences of Native American music and 'rhythms of the street and gangland.' <br>He then used this tape to construct a framework of Mingus compositions that had, he says, a 'similar feel.' "<br> <br>"Thumm then serendipitously exposed Willner to Partch's music and <br>instruments. Amazingly, Willner made the connection between Native <br>American and 'street and gangland' (read - hobo) music right away, and <br>began to want to incorporate the Partch instruments into the Mingus <br>work. Mingus had explored the ethnic and subcultural origins and <br>derivation of his music, so he had in that respect a similarity to Harry <br>Partch (I wouldn't want to overdo this)."<br> <br>"The music is by Mingus, not Partch, and not all our members will want <br>to venture into it, but the Partch instruments add considerably to the <br>atmosphere with their tonal presence, and sometimes feature strongly in <br>arrangements."<br> <br>"The musicians featured will surely bring the attention of the more <br>intrepid of their followers to the music of Harry Partch - featured <br>musicians include: Keith Richards, Charlie Watts of the Rolling Stones, <br>Elvis Costello, musician to the world, Bill Frisell of Material, Robbie<br> Robertson of the Band, Leonard Cohen, Dr John, screaming woman Diamanda <br>Galas, Don Alias, Bobby Previte, Bernard Fowler, Marc Ribot, ex-Void-Oid <br>Robert Quine, and, as they say, many more who are possibly as well known, <br>but not by me."<br> <br>"Not every 'famous' musician plays a Partch instrument - Charlie Watts <br>and Keith Richards don't, but for examples, Elvis Costello plays Harmonic<br> Canon, Marc Ribot Marimba Eroica."<br> <br>"Partch instruments featured on the album  are: Chromelodion II, Cone Gongs <br>(no indication that the Gourd Tree was used), Bass Marimba, Marimba Eroica,<br> Harmonic Canon, Cloud Chamber Bowls, Surrogate Kithara, Crychord, and <br>Diamond Marimba."<br> <br>"Danlee Mitchell and Dean Drummond are credited with special thanks, <br>implying the instruments were from Dean's collection with Danlee's overall <br>approval."<br> <br>"But the Partch instruments are not being used here merely to spice up <br>a jazz album, they do affect the intonation and harmonies, and they <br>contribute substantially to the atmosphere of the disc. I recommend investigating this disc - not maybe everyone's cup of musical tea, but <br>in many ways valuable - it is, so far as I know, the first project of <br>its kind to use Partch instruments; Partch is profiled highly. It <br>introduces (?) some interesting and adventurous musicians and their <br>audiences to Partch's work. If it is difficult to get this disc - and it <br>took us a while: we were informed it had been deleted, which isn't the <br>case - rather, it has been recently issued, and hasn't fully percolated <br>its' way through the catalogues - we can order it for you."<br> <br> <br>For more information on the BHPS, email  Roger Merrick at <br><100550.2266@compuserve.com>. There is also a WEB page, but I don't<br>have the URL.<br> <br>BTW, this should appear in Digest # 666? Does that mean that xenharmonic <br>music is satanic?

Perhaps I'm out to lunch, but it<br>>seems that the structure of the piece does not lend itself to this<br>>system. What kind of just system would allow one to use so many<br>>different chords freely?<br><br>I find it interesting that you feel that just intonation constrains the<br>number of chords. Certainly you would have as many different chords<br>available in a 19-tone just system. More actually. What just intonation<br>constrains is the ability to modulate (and have it sound the same). Perhaps<br>this is what you mean by using the chords "freely." In a just system the<br>same "chord" as defined by the notes in the system used relative to the<br>tonic would often sound different relative to different tonics. Thus if you<br>finger a "major chord" on the piano, it will not always be a 4:5:6 in just<br>intonation.<br><br>You may find this a weakness of JI. Because modulation was so important to<br>European composers in the four hundred years or so before this century,<br>many of them certainly thought it was a weakness. I, however, find it one<br>of JI's endearing strengths. Different keys have very different attributes<br>-- they each become a new "world of sound."<br><br>>When Lou Harrison says "Just intonation is the<br>>best intonation," for what sort of music is he referring to?<br><br>I suppose a flip answer would be "his music" or "music he likes." I think<br>he and a lot of other composers love the crystalline purity of just<br>intervals. I have talked to other JI composers who ask why composers who<br>use temperament systems go to such lengths to approximate just intervals<br>within their systems. Why not just use a just system to begin with? An<br>answer might be that you want the ability to modulate freely and have it<br>sound the same. And, of course, there are composers who are not interested<br>in just intervals to begin with. But, personally, I love the sounds of JI<br>and don't find it a constraint to my composition at all.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.

The two are exactly analogous if not exactly<br>identical:  Modulating a melody within a seven-steped diatonic scale without<br>adding the appropriate chromatics, changes major thirds into minor, producing<br>the familiar modal feeling change.  Similarly, starting with a justly tuned 12<br>(or whatever) toned scale, and modulating it to another tonal center without<br>adding additional pitches as needed, will change 5:4s into 81:64s for example.<br>It's a different sort of feeling change, in that we don't hear major-to-minor<br>shifts, but it's exactly identical in that we hear shifts between very different<br>sounding major thirds.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 22 Mar 1996 09:15 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id AAA29883; Fri, 22 Mar 1996 00:15:33 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 22 Mar 1996 00:15:33 -0800<br>Message-Id: <960322015934_174491721@emout09.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2689 href="#2689">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/23/1996 11:56:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Sorry folks.
