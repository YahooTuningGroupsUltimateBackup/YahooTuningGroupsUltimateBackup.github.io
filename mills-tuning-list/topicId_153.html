We're not thinking enough about the whole impact of our<br>music on various possible audiences.  And we're underestimating the enormity of<br>the task of putting out a CD.  <br><br>   Pythagoras' Ghost had a fair variety of timbres, tempi, and styles.  But more<br>generally, and of utmost importance, parts of it linger in my memory, and thus<br>make me want to hear the CD again.  (It was, however, on my opinion, weak on<br>memorable melodies and musical drama.)<br><br>   The other CD, however, was not a memorable performance.  About all I can<br>remember from it is the basic character of the two or three timbres on it.  It<br>sounded like somebody came up with a tuning, built an instrument to that tuning,<br>and then doodled around in front of a DAT deck for a couple of evenings.  I am<br>absolutely 100% sure that a whole lot more work than that went into it, but that<br>sort of behind-the-scenes stuff is not audible to the listener.  <br><br>   Nothing about it makes me want to "keep coming back".  What I could hear of<br>the tuning was perhaps interesting, but the timbres were pretty basic, there<br>were very few (if any) catchy melodies, no waves of increasing and decreasing<br>action, tension, or drama in the music, little variety of tempo or timbre,<br>almost nothing interesting in the stereo spectrum, and most of the tracks I<br>could stop in the middle with very little sense that that piece was incomplete.<br><br>   I believe this to be a big problem.  Our music doesn't need these things to<br>meet the definition of music, nor to qualify as good music.  That's not the<br>concern here.  The concern here is that it needs those things to get attention.<br>When I'm at home scanning across the spines of several hundred CDs in my<br>collection, why should I think to play that one when it has so few memorable<br>qualities?  Perhaps to refresh my memory as to why I haven't played it in two<br>years?  <br><br>   Why do I believe this to be a problem?  To some of you I'm sure that that's<br>obvious.  But others take a more ... "non-formalistic" I suppose ... attitude<br>toward music:  "This is ART, not TV evangelism", they'll say, or "this is<br>journey of exploration and experimentation - to find new musical resources; the<br>last place I want my music to end up is in some teenager's top-40 list", or even<br>"it's their CD; if people want to turn off my music in the middle of a track<br>that's their prerogative".  <br><br>   Well then let me ask you this then:  Why exactly did you pay about $2000 to<br>put it on CD if you didn't care whether people think it bears repeated<br>listening?  If these are experiments for personal enlightenment, then why bother<br>publishing them at all beyond cassette copies to a few other explorers with<br>similar interests?  And if you don't care whether people want to hear it over<br>and over, then why make them pay $15 or a CD?  <br><br>   Now don't anybody out there get me wrong on this:  I don't claim to have any<br>blockbuster CDs out, or that when my 88CET CD does come out, that people will<br>love it.  But I am confident of one thing:  At least MOST of that CD's<br>purchasers' will conclude that I at least TRIED - successfully or not - to make<br>it memorable.  Am I implying that this composer didn't work hard on that CD?<br>No.  Please!  Not for a moment!  My point is that giving your audience a<br>experience they'll treasure has more to do with what you set out to accomplish<br>than how hard you work at accomplishing it.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 5 Nov 1995 21:57 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA08930; Sun, 5 Nov 1995 11:57:52 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 5 Nov 1995 11:57:52 -0800<br>Message-Id: <951105195529_71670.2576_HHB31-5@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
