Is it conceiveable that a <br>more intuitive, "mystical" way of approaching the Universe will be what <br>we are confronted with? There's that old saw, "the Universe is not only <br>stranger than we can imagine; it'e stranger than we CAN imagine" (or <br>something like that). Meaning, there are places where our intellectual <br>minds cannot ever comprehend the happenings. I believe that is quite <br>possible, but that is not frightening to me...it seems quite reasonable.<br>Humans occupy a special place in the cosmos, but that doesn't mean we're <br>able to reduce all things to our sphere of understanding. In fact, if one <br>cares to explore other cultures, they often find "mystical" (sorry) ideas <br>and concepts, and folks doing things that defy any sort of "scientific" <br>understanding.<br>And that brings me to my reply to Paul Hahn about Sagan's death. In <br>Paul's original message (which I did not save), there seemed to be a sort <br>of condescension present, in the form of Sagan, which seemed to say, <br>"there, there, don't take that mystical crap too seriously;" in fact, I <br>do know Sagan represented a philosophy which I find ludicrous, namely <br>that there is no ultimate Creator, and those who believe so are a little, <br>shall we say, "old fashioned", or something to that effect. That's why I <br>mentioned his death; what could be more mystical, final, and absolutely <br>out of our control?<br>All of this relates to music, to me...I cannot separate music from any <br>other facet of life, including what we call "science." But, science just <br>shows, in mathematical or other terms, what is there in a fashion that <br>may or may not explain what's REALLY happening. Even one of the greatest <br>scientists of all time, Newton, was well aware of the limits of science, <br>and spent much time exploring other, more important, facets of what makes <br>the Universe tick. I myself have experienced many phenomena which are <br>well beyond the capacity of any "scientific" explanationm, and which, <br>unfortunately, many folks who consider science the be all and end all, <br>would probably not believe in, anyway. And my own experiences, personal <br>though they may be, are quite valid and illuminating as to the fact that <br>there are greater realities out there, which what we call the scientific <br>method would be quite helpless at explaining, or understanding....Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 15 Mar 1997 18:04 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA24004; Sat, 15 Mar 1997 18:04:49 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA23992<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id JAA03000; Sat, 15 Mar 1997 09:02:22 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 15 Mar 1997 09:02:22 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.95.970315115711.4420A-100000@u1.farm.idt.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
