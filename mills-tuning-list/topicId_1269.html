BUT, it would not be unreasonable to expect<br>> the Institute to allow me to sell the original version of the Clavette<br>> at perhaps 10% above cost, and then split the 10% with the Institute,<br>> since according to Dutch law they hold all patent rights to it. Such an<br>> arrangement would cost the Institute nothing. <br>> But no, despite ever-tighter budgets, such an arrangement holds no<br>> interest. Yes, I suppose the Institute would not get rich off of it, but<br>> even if they got a few hundred guilders they could buy something<br>> worthwhile for the studios. <br>> Maybe the disinterest has to do with the politics of receiving government<br>> subsidies. I suspect similar thinking is at work at STEIM.<br><br>No, receiving government funding does not prohibit other sources of<br>income for non-profit organisations.<br><br>And Brian writes:<br>> Harold Fortuin has already built one, but it's unclear whether his<br>> licensing agreement with STEIM will let him commercialize it, and it's<br>> even more unclear whether STEIM gives a damn about driving the cost<br>> down on the clavette and pumping these things out by the thousands.<br>> Probably not.  <br><br>Whether STEIM gives a damn may be unclear, but Brian seems very<br>optimistic about the market size for Harold's Clavette. <br>The matter is that the Clavette is based on the Sensorlab developed at<br>STEIM, so the Royal Conservatory wouldn't just be able to put it on<br>the market on its own, or grant Harold the rights even if it wished so. <br>Then STEIM has made it clear about a year ago that this foundation<br>doesn't have the financial means to make any products ripe for the<br>market. The Sensorlab would need to be enhanced, it cannot measure<br>velocity at the moment, the software needs improvement, and the<br>original developer has left a long time ago. Working with the<br>Sensorlab in its current form is therefore only feasible for people<br>doing a project at STEIM. So it would just mean an investment that<br>can't be done. Expecting that STEIM gives away its rights to Harold is<br>not feasible I suppose. <br>Anyway these are the reasons as I understand them. There must be<br>better technical solutions possible. Harold and anyone else who looks<br>for them deserves encouragement. <br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 28 Nov 1996 17:21 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10977; Thu, 28 Nov 1996 17:23:06 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10408<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA04278; Thu, 28 Nov 1996 08:23:02 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 28 Nov 1996 08:23:02 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.961128075622.17521A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
