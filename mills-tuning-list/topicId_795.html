A<br>trumpet that would play third tones. It would be perfect for playing<br>blues. (Yes, Neil Haverstick inspired me this idea.) Would it be<br>possible to take a<br>4-valve A/Bb piccolo horn and modify it like this:<br><br>	cents	cents<br>Valve # 12/oct  19/oct<br>1       200     126,32<br>2       100     63,15<br>3       300     189,47<br>4       500     252,63<br><br>(The big numbers are hundreths of a normal semitone)<br><br>Using this set of slides, the fingering would be similar to a regular<br>trumpet.<br><br>Is it possible to cut the valves' tubes to play these higher notes? (for<br>exemple, on the chart, the 3rd valve lowers the note by a major 2nd,<br>that is 189 cents.)<br><br>The practical difficulty comes in trying to make an even shorter 2nd<br>valve crook than a piccolo trumpet already has. As you know the 2nd<br>valve crook is already barely a<br>half circle. Maybe it would be possible to shorten the valve casings and<br>try to<br>get an alternative set of slides.<br><br>Also, it would be practical to  find an instrument with a larger casing<br>than a piccolo.  I have heard of flugel horns out there that have four<br>valves and would have large enough ports to work better for the project. <br><br>Can any one help me find an instrument suitable for this, and a good<br>technician to do the job? Is 19 a good choice, or should I go for 17, 22<br>or JI? Also, can anyone post the latest infos on ordering a microtonal<br>guitar (with fixed frets)? How do you calculate the frets' positions?<br><br>Regards, <br>        Kami<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 29 Aug 1996 00:50 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04164; Thu, 29 Aug 1996 00:51:49 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04076<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id PAA16568; Wed, 28 Aug 1996 15:51:47 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 28 Aug 1996 15:51:47 -0700<br>Message-Id: <71960828224917/0005695065PK2EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
