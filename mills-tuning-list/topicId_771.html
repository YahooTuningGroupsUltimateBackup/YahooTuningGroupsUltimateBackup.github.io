Partch's music is inseparable from its dramatic dimension; intonation,<br>lyrics, acting, the gestural playing on the instruments, and the very<br>instruments that Harry built are physical presence on the stage during a<br>live performance and form all an inseparable gesamtkunstwerk --a unique<br>artistic unity.<br>	2. Anything that breaks this unity, therefore, affects the<br>gesmtkunstwerkenheit --the total unity of a work's elements--- thereby<br>mutilating Partch's art.<br>	3. Preliminary list of possible mutilations to Partch's art:<br>		a) Recordings (because the physical proximity and the drama are missing).<br>		b) Musical performance only (because drama is missing)<br>		c) Dramatic live performances with non-Partch instruments (because you<br>got to see the thing itself and the gestures necessary to play on it are<br>part of the drama)<br>		d) Films and videos (because it's not a live performance where there is<br>physical proximity between the audience and the action)<br>		e) Dramatic live performances with exact replicas of Partch instruments<br>(because the instruments are unique)<br>	4. Only those who have control over the original instruments can stage an<br>artistically honest performance of the works as the composer intended, and<br>only those who attend their performances can get a true sense of Harry's<br>art.<br>	5. When the original instruments disintegrate, Partch's art will die<br>forever.<br>	6. Fortunately for the world, polymer technologies provide ever advancing<br>substances to fix the little cracks and splits in the instruments, so that<br>in every generation there will be at least a little number of privileged<br>people who will experience Partch's art for many generations to come.<br>	My conclusion is that plastics are the best thing that happened in the<br>world since the invention of the bed.<br>	Enrique Moreno  	<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 22 Aug 1996 22:53 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA27270; Thu, 22 Aug 1996 22:54:40 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA27334<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id NAA06313; Thu, 22 Aug 1996 13:54:33 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 22 Aug 1996 13:54:33 -0700<br>Message-Id: <s21c90e9.007@cesmtp.ccf.org><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
