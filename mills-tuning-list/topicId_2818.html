Joel Mandelbaum's dissertation is<br>very original, especially his combined error function for evaluating<br>temperaments in terms of the 5-limit consonances and particularly his<br>discovery and compositional use of QEIS scales (moments of symmetry<br>(well-formed scales) where the intervals sizes are 1 and 2 units of<br>the temperament).<br><br>The cited literature is also very complete, especially for its day<br>(1961). From it,  I learned of Novaro's, Brun's, and other researchers'<br>works. Other writers on 19 such as Ariel are still virtually<br>unknown to the xenharmonic community and would have completely so were<br>it not for Mandelbaum's pioneering work.<br><br>It is a shame that someone has not reprinted this book, though I<br>imagine it is still available through Xerox University Microfilms<br>in Ann Arbor, MI. I'd love to hear a performance of his pieces on<br>a synth rather than the two old pianos he was forced to use.<br><br>As for the ancient Greek use of 1/3 tones, they are found in<br>Aristoxenos's Soft Chromatic genus (chroma malakon). This tetrachord<br>has the ascending intervals 1/3 1/3 11/6 tones  (66.67 66.67<br>366.67 cents). It fits quite well into 19-tet as 1+1+6 degrees.<br>The other Aristoxenian tetrachord  found in 19-tet is the Intense<br>Diatonic as 2+3+3 (permuted as 3+3+2, 3+2+3 also).<br><br>There is also a non-canonical chromatic tetrachord 2+2+4, which<br>resembles the Byzantine and Islamic genera 16/15 x 15/14 x 7/6 and<br>14/13 x 13/12 x 8/7. This is the closest approximation possible in<br>19-tet to the Intense Chromatic 100 100 300 cents.<br><br>A just interval approximating 1/3 tone is found in Archytas's and<br>Plolemy's tetrachords as 28/27. Ptolemy gives 28/27 x 15/14 x 6/5<br>(Soft Chromatic) and both he and Archytas offer 28/27 x 8/7 x 9/8<br>(as Ptolemy's Soft Diatonic, A's Diatonic). Archytas's chromatic<br>28/27 x 243/224 x 32/27 is similar to Ptolemy's. In 19-tet<br>these tunings would be 1+2+5 and 1+4+3, the first being quite<br>good, the second recognizable.<br><br>However, there is no evidence that the Greeks used any kind of<br>equal temperament; the ascription of 12, 24, 36, 72...-tet to<br>Aristoxenos is a modern interpretation. If the Greeks had wanted<br>0 mod 12 ET's, they were more than capable of calculating them.<br>Extracting 19th roots would have been much more difficult, but they<br>could have probably managed by using the mesolabium or some numerical<br>procedure.<br><br><br>BTW, a transcription of the Costeley Chanson has been published<br>in 19-tet. Have you ever played and recorded it?<br><br><br>--John<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Andrew L.
