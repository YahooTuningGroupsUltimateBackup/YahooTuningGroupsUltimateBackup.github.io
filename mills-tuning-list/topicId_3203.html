Well, so that you can recreate my 88CET ear-training CDs.  That<br>would obviously be a bit too narrow-minded a goal!  It's more to use those<br>CDs as an example to illustrate the sorts of considerations you folks<br>should ponder if you'd like to make ear-training CDs for whatever tunings<br>you're interested in.<br><br>   And it's also to promote the idea of that sort of CD, and to encourage<br>active ear-training practice, as a vital task in the study of unusual<br>tunings.<br><br>   I haven't written up the text of the postings yet, so it'll probably be<br>a couple days before I start getting going on them.  But it definitely<br>won't be too long.</div>
