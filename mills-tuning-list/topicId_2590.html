(A<br>>simple approximation to this is given below).<br>><br>>(2) Given two sounds F and G, one with partials at frequencies f1, f2,<br>>f3, f4, etc and the other with partials at frequencies g1, g2, g3, g4,<br>>etc. Define the sensory dissonance between F and G to be the sum of<br>>all the dissonances between all the sine wave partials, weighted by<br>>the relative amplitudes of the partials.<br>><br>>Suppose two sine waves are at frequencies f and g. The data<br>>gathered by Plomp and Levelt can be parameterized as the<br>>difference between two exponentials<br>><br>>                      exp(-a |f-g|) - exp(-b |f-g|)<br>><br>>where a and b are constants.<br><br>Now we're talking!<br><br>>For details, see my paper in JASA, Sept  93.<br><br>Journal of Acoustic Science and Astrology?<br><br>>If you need a computer program that implements these<br>>calculations, I can mail you one.<br><br>By all means!  Intel version?<br><br>>Just a simple thought--consonance, having to do with the relationship<br>>between 2 or more pitches--when the intervals coincide with the harmonic<br>>overtone series, they are consonant--when they do not or one of them does<br>>not, they are not consonant, irregardless of how they "sound" to the ear.<br>>What "sounds" pleasant is, I believe, much more of a learned thing than<br>>seems to be generally acknowledged.  7/4 "sounds" perhaps a bit dissonant<br>>in the 12TET world, but I believe is extremely consonant when developed in<br>>the proper musical setting.<br><br>Right.
