Keep in mind that I'm still learning this stuff<br>so "usable" for me may mean "trivial" for some of you. ;-)<br><br>What I came up with -- and it's hardly earth shattering being<br>right out of Partch's diamonds -- were two tone clusters:<br><br>	Utonality:  7/9 - 1/1 - 7/6 - 7/5 - 7/4<br>	Otonality:  1/1 - 5/4 - 3/2 - 7/4 - 9/4<br><br>What stuck out, and I was inspired to look at it this way both by<br>something Paul Erlich wrote, and by seeing the changes in the<br>Helmholtz consonance graph under the influence of multiple drones<br>seperated by 3/2s, is that there are two tones which seem to be<br>structurally significant.  For lack of better terms, I'm referring to<br>them as "root" and "axis".  The "root" is the 1/1 in the Partchian<br>sense, and the axis is a tone that has a 3/2 above and below.  In the<br>Utonal, the root is 1/1 and the axis is 7/6, where in the Otonal the<br>root is 1/1 and the axis is 3/2.<br><br>As an isolated interval, I've for some time preferred the 7/6 to the<br>6/5 to give a "minor" feel, so this is intriguing to me.  I started to<br>play around with permutations, exchanging root and axis and such, and<br>on paper it looks like there might something to work with here.  It<br>also looks like one could think of it as a pair of 4:5:6 and 6:7:9<br>chords, or their utonal counterparts.  [Polytonality?]<br><br>I don't have any polyphonic instruments set up in JI at the moment,<br>though I'm hoping to put some rough 22tet stuff (so I can practice<br>other parts and refine it) to tape over the holidays, after which I'll<br>probably be more motivated to retune my synth (retuning it is a pain).<br>In the meantime, I tried the utonal chord on my 22tet guitar, playing<br>it "stick style", and found it to be quite pleasing, even in its<br>tempered form, though I haven't try doing anything with it yet (it was<br>getting late :)<br><br>Comments?  Advice?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Steve<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  jinetwk@dnai.com (Just Intonation Network) <br>Subject:  Re: TUNING digest 1272<br>PostedDate:  20-12-97 01:31:55<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  20-12-97 01:29:49-20-12-97 01:29:50,20-12-97 01:29:25-20-12-97 01:29:26<br>DeliveredDate:  20-12-97 01:29:26<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256573.0002DD82; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 01:31:38 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22378; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 01:31:55 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 20 Dec 1997 01:31:55 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22400<br>Received: (qmail 1627 invoked from network); 19 Dec 1997 16:31:51 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 19 Dec 1997 16:31:51 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199712200031.QAA29998@hopf.dnai.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
