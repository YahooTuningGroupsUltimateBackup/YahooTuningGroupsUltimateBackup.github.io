I think in part it comes down to what<br>you're looking at. I think that it would be improper for me to comment<br>on the general impression of what a piece in some unusual scale sounds<br>like, as I've never heard any full piece played in any temperaments other<br>than 12 or 7 (At least, I _assume_ the background music I hear in some Thai<br>restaurants is in 7-tET; I've been told that it is Thai traditional music,<br>and I've read that that is in 7-tET. But I haven't done a frequency scan<br>to make sure they weren't using Western instruments tuned to 12.)<br><br>But I've played scales generated on computers. And to my ear, Blackwood's<br>comment that a diatonic scale will sound "recognizable" if it follows the<br>standard pattern of 2 large intervals, one small, three large, and one small<br>seems correct. Now the only tempered scales that permit this are those<br>with 5x + 2y tones, with x > y > 0. This means 12, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, ...<br>and certainly both 19 and 22 qualify. And in fact, if I play a 19-tET scale,<br>with "whole steps" of 158 moc (I'm using moc consistently; if you need to<br>convert to cents to visualize, multiply by 1.2) and "half steps" of 105 moc<br>for my intervals, it sounds to my ear so much like a standard major scale<br>that I'd never spot the difference unless I heard them played together.<br>The fact that the "half step" is MUCH more than half the "whole step" is<br>not obvious to my ears. (In fact, in the most common sort of JI scale, the<br>"half steps" are 93 moc and the "whole steps" are a mixture of 152 and 170<br>moc. So the fact that the "whole step" is less than double the "half step"<br>does make it somewhat "JI-like." But the point is that ALL these scales,<br>12-tET, 5-limit JI, 19-tET, etc., permit the construction of major [and<br>minor] scales of the same pattern.) <br><br>Now having said this, we can note that a 4:5:6 major triad is characterized<br>by three intervals: 5/4 (322 moc), 6/5 (263 moc), and 3/2 (585 moc). And<br>these are represented in 12-tET by 333, 250, and 583 moc, while in 19-tET<br>they are 316, 263, and 579 moc. It is possible that some ears hearing the<br>CHORD may get a different impression because the two thirds are closer<br>to JI while the fifth is further from JI. I don't know. I can't program my<br>computer to play the chords and I don't have a keyboard I can retune.<br><br>But I think that melodically, from what I've said, assuming that most tunes<br>consist of sequences from the diatonic scale up or down for large portions<br>of their scope, 19, 12, or 22 will sound all about the same. (If you write<br>a complex piece with much modulation, this may not be so. But a popular<br>song, for example, played in 19 will not sound unusual to ANYONE's ear unless<br>they have far better absolute sense of pitch than I have.)<br><br>                                Bruce R.
