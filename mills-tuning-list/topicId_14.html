But as with any<br>foreign language, it becomes easier with practice...     :)<br><br>>You're also unquestionably correct about the prevalence of meantone in<br>>the period in question.  However, the very fact that Zarlino published<br>>his temperament should not be dismissed so lightly.<br><br>If I'm not mistaken, I believe that Zarlino himself later admits that it is<br>inferior to 1/4 linear...<br><br>> The persistence of such a temperament over that period of time, even if it<br>> was used by a small minority of performers or organ builders, says something<br>> to me.  Unfortunately, it says it in a foreign language, and I am still not<br>> quite clear on its communication.<br><br>If I understand you correctly, you're referring to 2/7 linear here.  I have<br>never seen any evidence to suggest that it was even *concidered* by theorists<br>beyond Zarlino.  There may be an honorable mention by Mersenne, but I'm not<br>sure.  Certainly not in Germany.  The person to ask would be Edmundo Hora.<br>If anyone reading this speaks to Edmundo regularly, please tell him to get<br>on the Net!<br><br>Aleksander Frosztega</div>
