"<br><br><br>-------------------- End Original Message --------------------<br><br>   Frankly I wouldn't buy that.  If the harmony makes clear that you're<br>playing a vi chord, then its third is the tonic.  That's built into the<br>definition of diatonic triads.  <br><br>   If the harmony is ambiguous enough to confuse a leading tone with a<br>tonic, then that would not fall within the realm of diatonic harmony.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 21 Feb 1997 06:23 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13360; Fri, 21 Feb 1997 06:23:44 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13362<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id VAA29314; Thu, 20 Feb 1997 21:22:02 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 20 Feb 1997 21:22:02 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199702210006_MC2-118C-A6BE@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
