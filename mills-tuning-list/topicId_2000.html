How would you compare it to OpCode's Max?<br>><br>>Well, the Grid graphical interface, which Rusty uses, is being developed<br>>right now (Max is ~10 years old, I think) in Java.<br>>1. It looks a lot nicer on the screen (and the upcoming version is especially<br>>dazzling)<br>>2. It runs on just about anything made today.<br>>3. It's (I think) a lot more flexible, since you can write unit generators<br>>yourself, popup control panels and all.<br>>4. It can run across networks, since it's in Java.<br>>5. Where Max supports (I think) just a few simple data types, like midi &c.,<br>>Rusty unit generators can exchange many very complex musical objects---<br>>in fact, most of my work is in writing a big, complicated oo library for<br>>music and music theory.  but it's only complicated for me!---what users see<br>>are just a lot of very natural classes with a lot of power behind them,<br>>e.g., scales that know how to tune themselves.<br>>you can check out Grid's homepage:<br>>http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/pub/Ian.taylor/Grid<br>>which even includes a link to Rusty's homepage.  Ian, Grid's author,<br>>could probably tell you more about the advantages Grid has over Max.<br>>In fact, I think he might be working on some midi and synthesis unit<br>>generators soon.<br>><br>>thanks for your interest!<br>>----------------------------------------------------------------michael<br>><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 3 May 1997 13:35 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12885; Sat, 3 May 1997 13:35:46 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03441<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id EAA24833; Sat, 3 May 1997 04:34:11 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 3 May 1997 04:34:11 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01541106af908a1d67e8@[207.207.3.154]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5388 href="#5388">ðŸ”—</a>UPB_MONIODIS@ONLINE.EMICH.EDU</h3><span>5/3/1997 8:02:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Speaking of _The Just Intonation Primer_, I am working my way through it<br>and commend it as a truly outstanding work.<br><br>I noted a couple of errata that may be of some use to new readers:<br><br>On page 27, column two, second paragraph, there is a series given which<br>reads:  2/1, 4/3, 8/5, 8/7, 16/11, 13/11, 32/17, 32/19.

San Francisco: The Just Intonation<br>Network, 1993.<br><br>http://www.dnai.com:80/~jinetwk/<br><br>Here's what the web site says about it:<br><br>Do you want to start making music in Just Intonation, but don't know where<br>to begin? Or do you just want to find out what all the talk is about? The<br>Just Intonation Primer will give you the information you need, in a<br>succinct and readable form. With 78 pages of text and over 50 charts and<br>diagrams, The Just Intonation Primer explains the essential concepts of<br>Just Intonation in terms that practicing composers and musicians will<br>understand.<br><br><br><br>Praise for The Just Intonation Primer:<br><br>       I highly recommend this book as a textbook for theory classes and as<br>an introduction to more detailed and idiosyncratic works on JI...<br>Independent composers frustrated by the limits of 12 [tone equal<br>temperament] should read this book...<br><br>John H. Chalmers, Jr. -- Xenharmonikï¿½n<br><br>       David Doty is the appropriate person to create such a work... he has<br>the requisite subject matter expertise in generous measure, and he has been<br>in a position to know what students of the subject want and need. The book<br>that results is a concise, practical, informative, and very affordable<br>text.<br><br>Bart Hopkin -- Experimental Musical Instruments<br><br>       ...Doty has emerged as one of the preeminent contemporary theorists<br>of JI, showing himself to be a gifted expositor as well as a careful and<br>imaginative thinker. Hence the Primer is likely to become the main text and<br>reference for American composers interested in the resources of JI.<br><br>Dudley Duncan -- Ars Musica Denver<br><br><br>Unlike many previous texts dealing with tuning theory and its applications,<br>The Just Intonation Primer is intended for readers with an elementary<br>knowledge of common-practice music theory and no training in higher<br>mathematics. Its object is to prepare the reader to begin practical work in<br>Just Intonation and to understand more advanced texts and articles.<br>Previously, the few books available on Just Intonation have been difficult<br>to obtain and more difficult to understand. The primer will make it easy<br>for any interested musician to understand the fundamentals of Just<br>Intonation and begin making real music.<br><br>Among the principal topics addressed in the primer are:<br><br>       What is Just Intonation?<br>       A brief history of tuning in Western music<br>       Acoustic and psychoacoustic background<br>       Basic definitions, conventions, and procedures<br>       Intervals, chords, fixed scales, and extended tonal space<br>       Practical Just Intonation with real instruments<br><br>About the Author:<br><br>David B. Doty is a composer, author, instrument builder, and synthesist,<br>and a leading authority on Just Intonation. He is a founding member of the<br>Just Intonation Network and has edited the network's journal, 1/1, since<br>its inception in 1984. He has worked exclusively in Just Intonation since<br>1975, composing primarily for American Gamelan and MIDI systems.<br><br>To Order The Just Intonation Primer<br><br>The Just Intonation Primer is available exclusively from the Just<br>Intonation Network.
