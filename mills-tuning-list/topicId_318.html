I realize that with a guitar with <br>standard frets it's not possible to obtain all pitches.<br>Rather  I'm trying for different possible open tunings based on <br>relationships in JI. <br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br>Erik Nauman<br>K-2 teacher<br>The Rice School/La Escuela Rice<br>Houston, TX<br>enauman@rice.houstonisd.k12.tx.us<br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 31 Jan 1996 07:21 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA27971; Tue, 30 Jan 1996 22:21:17 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 30 Jan 1996 22:21:17 -0800<br>Message-Id: <9601312310457494@csst.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2517 href="#2517">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/1996 9:57:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> One comment he made<br>> which I found fascinating was that there was no true equal temperament<br>> on piano before this century because the technology to tune EQ did not<br>> exist until then<br><br>   I suppose that depends on how "true" they want their equal-temperament to be.<br>Almost no implementation of equal-temperament or any other tuning can ever be<br>absolutely 100% exact.  <br><br>   Best I can tell, pianos have historically been tuned by techniques that owe<br>their heritage to the old harpsichord tuning techniques, to which they added<br>somewhat stretched octaves toward the upper range of the instrument.  Still, I<br>would say that, for purposes of practical music, pianos have been tuned to equal<br>temperament nearly since their conception.  <br><br>   But anyway, perhaps Jorgensen is refering to the increased use of electronic<br>tuners in recent times?  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 1 Feb 1996 14:49 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id FAA25043; Thu, 1 Feb 1996 05:49:30 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 1 Feb 1996 05:49:30 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9602010836.A2448-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
