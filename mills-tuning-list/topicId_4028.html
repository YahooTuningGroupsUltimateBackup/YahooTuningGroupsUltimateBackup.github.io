Journal of the Acoustic Society of America 94(3):  1218-1228<br>(Sept) and "Relating Timbre and Tuning" 1993. Experimental Musical<br>Instruments 9(2): 22-29 (Dec)  consonance can be obtained in virtually any<br>tuning if the overtone spectrum is properly designed (algorithm given). <br><br>Might it be possible to find these online? If not, could anyone suggest<br>libraries which might have them?<br><br>My guess, without knowing exactly what those papers say, is that they are<br>generally based on an algorithm for cancelling out the beats of any two<br>notes. I know the beats can be essentially calculated using continued<br>fractions, so I'm guessing there's a rather straightforward way of<br>calculating, given a*sin(x) + b*sin(y), a and b being volumes and x and y<br>being wavelengths, there's a rather straightforward way of calculating a<br>bunch of other sin functions which when added will cancel out all the<br>beats.<br><br>If my above guess is correct, I might (might) take on a project of writing<br>a utility which would play any random set of pure tones and do automatic<br>beat cancellation on them, which I think would be a very cool toy if<br>nobody's done it already, although there's some math I need to know <br>first ... <br><br>-Bram</div><h3><a id=8559 href="#8559">ðŸ”—</a>Johnny Reinhard &#x3C;reinhard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/1998 11:03:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>excuse me, Ed Sanders created a 31-TET instrument called the "microlyre."<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music	<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@idt.net<br>http://www.echonyc.com/~jhhl/AFMM<br><br>On Wed, 30 Sep 1998, Johnny Reinhard wrote:<br><br>> May 20 and May 27, 1999 -- both Thursdays -- are concert nights for the<br>> AFMM at St. Paul's Chapel, Columbia University, NYC.<br>> <br>> One hightlight (May 20) will be the premiere of "Thirsting For Peace in<br>> a Raging Century" for 2 voices and microlyre by Ed Sanders, leader of the<br>> Fugs.
