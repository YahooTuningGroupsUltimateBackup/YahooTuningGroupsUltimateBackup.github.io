Probably it would <br>> be to play the piece through N times, with a different <br>> velocity setting each time, playing only the notes in a <br>> certain class each time, then merging to a single block. Then, <br>> would it be easier to play by note number (note# 0-127, then <br>> 128-255 ...), or interlaced (note# mod N = 0,N-1)? Or, has <br>> someone a better idea?<br><br>Would it not be possible to distinguish each pitchbend-class by<br>channel number directly? Thus making N tracks in the sequencer, assign<br>a different channel number to each of them, play the piece through N<br>times, then merge the tracks to one block. That way the velocity value<br>won't have to be sacrificed and the program doesn't have to do much, namely<br>only putting the pitch bend commands at the beginning of the MIDI file.<br>Well I realise that this comes down to telling the program which note<br>represents which by hand.<br>Alternatively, using a keyboard with program-change buttons you could<br>press one before each note and let the program translate the program<br>change commands to channel numbers. That way you can enter everything<br>more conveniently all tracks at once, or track by track.<br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 5 Nov 1996 23:19 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04938; Tue, 5 Nov 1996 23:19:58 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04963<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id OAA00657; Tue, 5 Nov 1996 14:19:55 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 5 Nov 1996 14:19:55 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009AAEF7DF6F27C0.0681@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
