Are there any formulas for the dimensions of such <br>resonators or is trial and error the best we can do?<br><br>There are only a couple of different "shapes" for which<br>the equations have simple solutions. Kinsler and Fry's book looks<br>at the modes of rectagular cavities (a room is an example, albeit<br>one with larger dimensions than a typical musical instrument).<br>You could most likely also solve spherical cavities (and maybe <br>ellipsoidal?) in a similar manner, but you'd probaly need to do<br>some kind of iterative solution for more complex shapes.<br><br>There was also an article by Bart Hopkin a while ago in<br>Experimental Musical Instruments that discussed the placement of<br>tone holes in an ocarina. I don't have the article handy, but<br>there were several aspects including placement, width, and depth<br>of the tone holes that had significant impact on the pitch of the <br>resulting instrument. This was presented in a "rule of thumb" kind<br>of way. <br><br>Bill Sethares<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 28 Mar 1997 17:20 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA20601; Fri, 28 Mar 1997 17:20:06 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA20587<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id IAA25730; Fri, 28 Mar 1997 08:17:13 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 28 Mar 1997 08:17:13 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703281113_MC2-136A-9E70@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
