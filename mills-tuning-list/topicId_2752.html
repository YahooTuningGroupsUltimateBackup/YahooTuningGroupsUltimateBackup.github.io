For<br>example:<br><br>> I remember when I first became interested in more than 12 tones in the<br>> octave, I liked the _idea_ of as many tones within the octave as<br>> possible, and tended to consider 31 as the absolute minimum. But<br>> experience has taught me that the only viable alternative to the 12-tone<br>> equal is the 19 system.<br><br>19 notes, maybe.  But why do they have to be equally tempered?<br><br>> All tuning systems which are not mere noise, reduce approximately either<br>> to the 12-tone or the 19-tone equal, melodically considered. This<br>> follows inescapably from the principle of the melodic limen.<br><br>And what is the criterion for a tuning system _being_ mere noise?<br>That it doesn't reduce to 12 or 19 equal?  I still think melodically<br>in terms of 12 pitch classes, with diesis or comma inflections.  What<br>does this prove?<br><br>> 31-tone<br>> equal for example reduces melodically to the 12-tone equal (with a few<br>> exceptions where the augmented tone occurs, where it has rather a flavor<br>> of the 19-equal)<br><br>31 equal sounds nothing like either 12 or 19 equal.  Melodies in 12<br>or 19 pitch classes can, however, be played in 31 equal.<br><br>> Between C and D, for example the 31-tone equal has Dbb, C#, Db<br>> and Cx ascending. The first of these is melodically confounded with C,<br>> the second two are melodically confounded with each other, and the last<br>> is confounded with D.<br><br>So, the melody C-D-Dbb-Cx-Dbb-Cx-Dbb-D is the same as C-D-C-D-C-D-C-D?<br>You don't hear the interval Dbb-Cx as a semitone?<br><br>> The 31-tone equal is in fact a monstrously<br>> complex, inefficient way of returning us to our melodic starting-point<br>> of 12-tone equal. It is much smoother indeed, but melodically it is a<br>> dead-end.<br><br>Come on, 31 equal steps aren't _that_ complex.  If you agree that it's<br>smoother, why not use it for its harmony?  It's not that difficult to<br>convert 19 pitch classes into 19 notes from 31 equal.  Usually, a string<br>of 19 fifths will do, especially if you're working within the 5-limit.<br>One day, I'll get a computer to do it automatically.<br><br><br>> The 22-tone equal suffers from two grave defects however, either one of<br>> which would be sufficient to condemn it to the category of a curiosity.<br>> Its tuning degree is at the outermost limit of what can be reliably<br>> distinguished in melody.<br><br>This is a defect?  Think of the tricks you can perform!<br><br>> second defect of the 22-tone equal involves its failure to close the<br>> cycle of fifths. I am aware that some will say to themselves - so what?<br>> But a musical system that does not close the cycle of fifths has at a<br>> stroke isolated itself from 99% of the music not merely of the western<br>> 19th century, but from virtually the whole of the western tradition, and<br>> from many other musical traditions as well. Such musical systems, like<br>> just intonation, are mere curiosities, and are far more impoverished in<br>> usable, aurally distinct resources even than the 12-tone equal.<br><br>Yes, 22 equal certainly takes you outside of the Western tradition.<br>It all depends how hung up you are on Western classical music.  Are<br>you saying that all other music is a mere curiosity?  One of the<br>characteristic features of this Western tradition is that everything<br>has to be given a name, and everything without a name is considered<br>musically unimportant.  I assume be "aurally distinct resources" you<br>mean intervals that can be given a name, and that people can be trained<br>to recognise.<br><br>What exactly does "close the cycle of fifths" mean?  1/4 comma meantone<br>has an open cycle of fifths.  If 22 equal has a cycle of fifths, it<br>closes after 22 steps.  Do you mean, rather, that there is only one<br>size of perfect fifth?  This seems to raise the diatonic notation to<br>a principle that I do not consider valid.<br><br>A system of 22 pitch classes for 5-limit JI runs into trouble because<br>the intervals are so unequal.  So, there is an argument here for<br>equal temperament.  I haven't investigated Paul Erlich's decatonic<br>modes enough to decide if they can be treated as 10 pitch classes.<br>I don't like the theory because it clings to the idea of diatonic<br>harmony -- that all notes used in harmony must belong to the same key.<br>I'd rather work out a chord sequence, and fit a melody to it.  Or,<br>define a melodic mode, write a tune in it, and harmonise it<br>chromatically.<br><br>> Your refer to the 7 and 11 limits.  The latter is a mere fantasm of the<br>> just intonationists, and is not audible to the ear as anything other<br>> than dissonance. The septimal limit is more interesting. But it is<br>> dissonant, however this may trouble those who aspire to forever extend<br>> the boundaries of consonance, until someday I presume, we shall find<br>> everything consonant, and music need trouble itself no longer with any<br>> rules or constraints whatever... It will also no longer need to trouble<br>> itself with pleasing an audience, for it will have none. Actually<br>> however, the 19-tone equal is the _only_ temperament that gives the<br>> septimal intervals in such a form that they can be melodically<br>> distinguished from adjacent intervals. This is a consequence of the fact<br>> that in this system only are the septimal intervals far enough away from<br>> adjacent intervals to preserve their own unique melodic character.<br><br>If you're listening to septimal intervals in 19 equal, no wonder you<br>think they're dissonant!  I outlined a listening experiment on the<br>list before which confirmed the consonance of the 7-limit.  If you<br>disagree, can you give specific comments on it?<br><br>To state my own opinion, which is the only one I trust, a just 4:6:7<br>chord is more consonant than a major triad in 12 equal.  Extending<br>consonance to the 7-limit means just that -- no further.  You can't<br>disprove an argument by extending it to ridiculous extremes.<br><br>An example of a 31 equal mode with septimal harmony is Ab-A-C-C#-Eb-<br>F-F#-Ab.  The chord C#-F-Ab could be retuned Db-F-Ab, or left as it<br>is.  If the former, this mode is 7 from 12 pitch classes.  However,<br>it certainly sounds like a different mode in 12 equal.  In 19 equal,<br>it is recognisable, but has quite a mournful sound.  It does work<br>melodically in LucyTuning, but the harmonies are still way out.<br><br>To state that 19 equal is the only temperament to do anything is<br>clearly absurd.  Sharpen one note my a millicent, and nothing<br>important changes.  Perharps you discounting out of hand all the<br>meantone temperaments between 19 and 31 equal.  From this<br>distance, it's very difficult to tell.<br><br><br>Now, to some details:<br><br>> I agree also that the fifths major thirds of 31-tone equal are slightly<br>> but noticeably smoother and more pleasing than those of the 19-tone<br>> equal. However,  if the 19-tone octave is stretched by 2-3 cents, its<br>> fifths become quite as good as those of the 31-tone.<br><br>The biggest problem harmonically with 13 equal is that it's fifths<br>aren't very good.  Stretching the octave for 19 equal works because<br>both the 3rd and 5th overtones are approximated flat.  I'd still much<br>rather use 31 equal, with pure octaves and almost pure major thirds.<br><br>> 55-60 cents as the limen of intervallic perception is well-established<br>> in the literature. Pratt for example in his Meaning of Music, as I<br>> recall, found a value "just wider than a quarter-tone", and Seashore &<br>> Jenner found a value between 53 and 61 cents.<br>> Naturally no one should accept these results without making trial for<br>> himself. I find however that my own ears are fully in agreement with<br>> these results.<br><br>So there's no problem with the 54.54 cents of 22 equal, then?  I'll do<br>the experiment myself when I understand what the terms mean.  I reckon<br>one step of 41 equal is about the smallest interval that can be used<br>melodically, but I still tend to avoid it.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  A440A <A440A@aol.com><br>Subject:  Re:  TUNING digest 1263<br>PostedDate:  11-12-97 19:08:28<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  11-12-97 19:06:31-11-12-97 19:06:33,11-12-97 19:06:17-11-12-97 19:06:17<br>DeliveredDate:  11-12-97 19:06:17<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656A.0063777F; Thu, 11 Dec 1997 19:08:22 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12896; Thu, 11 Dec 1997 19:08:28 +0100<br>Date: Thu, 11 Dec 1997 19:08:28 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13087<br>Received: (qmail 26747 invoked from network); 11 Dec 1997 10:08:22 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 11 Dec 1997 10:08:22 -0800<br>Message-Id: <2cc0edf0.3490298f@aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6592 href="#6592">ðŸ”—</a>alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)</h3><span>12/11/1997 11:03:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> > (By the way, the seeming beat-spotlighting character of the long consonances<br>>>in slow movements is mostly an illusion: performers at that time would<br>>>improvise filler and ornaments in such occasions.)<br>>     On the keyboard sonatas?   I really don't agree there, as the development<br><br>I wasn't really talking about keyboard music, but if you want to get into<br>specifics, it would depend a great deal on the period, the style, the<br>composer, and so on. If, for example, I was faced with a very plain<br>keyboard sarabande from circa 1700, you bet I would improvise lots of<br>melodic filler. Bach himself tends to leave less room for this sort of<br>thing, as did most composers as you get into the late 18th century.<br>><br>>>In this context, the practical differences between temperaments like some<br>>>of Neidhardt's and Marpurg's and ET are angels dancing on the head of pin.<br>>      On this I must disagree strongly.  Modern day ears can easily hear the<br>>differences in a tuning that provides key character and ET ,which does not.<br><br>Perhaps I was not clear enough in my qualifications. I had in mind some<br>temperaments such as Neidhardt's and Marpurg's divisions of the ditonic<br>comma. Looking them up in Barbour (who at least comes in handy when<br>comparing things to 12TET), I see that Marpurg's 1/3 comma temperament is<br>out at most 6 cents from ET, with a mean deviation of 3 cents. Neidhardt's<br>1/4 comma is at most 4 cents away, and Marpurg's 1/6 comma has a mean<br>deviation of only .7 cents!<br><br>Now, would I be able to tell the difference between such temperaments and<br>ET on a synthesizer or a harpsichord tuned with electronic help?<br>Absolutely. Perhaps Ed thought that I was saying the opposite, which I am<br>not.<br><br>Would I be able to tell the difference between such temperaments if tuned<br>by ear counting beats of simultaneous intervals by a skilled tuner who took<br>his time? Again, yes, I think so.<br><br>Would I be able to tell the difference between such temperaments if tuned<br>by ear of successive intervals, not checking thirds, by a keyboard player<br>who had a half hour before a rehearsal. Hmm, in that situation I think the<br>margin for error Marpurg, Neidhardt, and ET will start to overlap.<br><br>But let's take a more extreme case, as you suggest, of pure versus ET<br>intervals. Certainly such differences were quite significant to practical<br>musicians of that time when tuning harpsichords. But the original question<br>was about the use of fretted strings in ensembles with harpsichords.<br><br>The question then becomes, do those differences create enough dissonance to<br>be objectionable? Since we have plenty of documentary evidence that lutes,<br>archlutes, theorbos, and viols often played with harpsichords -- especially<br>in the 17th century -- the answer has to be either "no" or that<br>harpsichords were tempered to be at least closer to the fretted strings.<br><br>My own feeling is that the objectionability depends on many factors,<br>including the size of the ensemble and the speed of the music. Certainly<br>lutes were often used in large ensembles, especially in France and Italy in<br>the seventeenth century, but I heard a fine performance the other night on<br>PBS of Purcell trio sonatas and songs accompanied by a harpsichord and an<br>archlute.
