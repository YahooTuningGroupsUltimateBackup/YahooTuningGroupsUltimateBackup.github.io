See<br>http://www.b0b.com/infoedu/just_e9.html .  The missing intervals are 8/5,<br>12/7 and 7/4.  The 8/5 is not totally absent however - good steel players<br>hit it by ear when they engage the first pedal (which raises 3/2 to 5/3)<br>half way.<br><br>That leaves the 12/7 and 7/4.  Can you form beatless harmonies with these<br>and other notes of the scale?  I'm having a hard time imaging their use,<br>maybe because I'm basically a 5-limit player.<br><br>    -b0b-</div>
