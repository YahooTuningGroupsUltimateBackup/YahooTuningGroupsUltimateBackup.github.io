Nor do I feel<br>> that improvisational skill leads to more creative musical expression.  In<br>> fact it much more readily falls into the realm of noodling than much of<br>> the so-called Western classical repertoire.<br><br>I let this sit for a while, but I find this positively repulsive.<br><br>(1) If you can hum what you're composing (a good sign that you're making <br>music rather than marks on a page), then humming spontaneously (even slowly, <br>and correcting errors) is improvisational skill. That may not be helpful to <br>the mastery of a particular instrument, but it sure leads to better <br>composition!<br><br>(2) Many masters of instruments cannot improvise to save their lives. Many <br>master improvisers create compositions in a realm very different from the <br>five-line staff -- details will change from performance to performance, <br>rhythms will transcend rational notation, the musical experience will <br>reflect the immediate conditions of the moment, communication between <br>audience and performer will occur -- in all, the music will have a structure <br>that has more in common with real-time human thought processes.<br><br>(3) Noodling on a staff is less musical than noodling on an instrument, and <br>noodling on an instrument qualifies as poor improvisation at best.<br><br>(4) I went to a very prestigious university. The senior composition class <br>was far beyond my qualifications to enroll in. The performance of final <br>compositions from this class SUCKED. There was not one note of music in the <br>whole thing -- I couldn't have IMPROVISED anything worse if I tried. <br>Meanwhile, rock groups were playing in basements, improvising away, and <br>sometimes reaching levels beyond pure entertainment. (I should note that a <br>performance of compositions from the graduate school of the same university <br>was far more musical and far more challenging -- however, the undergraduate <br>symphony orchestra positively DEMOLISHES the grad school orchestra!)<br><br>(5) The ultimate musical experience. Hmm. Aside from that once-in-a-lifetime <br>improvisation where it feels like your hands are controlled by a higher <br>power, this would have to include listening to Jimi, or Duke, or one of Bach <br>or Chopin's "frozen improvisations" (if only we could capture their actual <br>performances out of the vibrations in the air). I'll skip Wynton Marsalis' <br>jazz "compositions."<br><br>Blah blah. No one can say it better than Neil already did. Anyway, we need a <br>lot more composition AND improvisation before the 12-tone monarchy is <br>overthrown; each element of music-making needs the other to grow and <br>prosper. Denying that is denying microtonality's very viability.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 14 Jan 1997 00:16 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07902; Tue, 14 Jan 1997 00:19:18 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07895<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id PAA12366; Mon, 13 Jan 1997 15:19:10 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 13 Jan 1997 15:19:10 -0800<br>Message-Id: <55970113231655/0005695065PK1EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4598 href="#4598">ðŸ”—</a>Matt Nathan &#x3C;mattn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/1997 3:25:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>PAULE wrote:<br> <br>> Matt Nathan wrote in TUNING digest 951,<br>> <br>> >Punning is purposely using the wrong pitch.<br>> <br>> Let's say you had a 6th chord, I'm sure we'd both be happy to tune it<br>> <br>> 1/1 5/4 3/2 5/3.<br>> <br>> Okay, now add the 9th.

I don't really consider any of the JI approximations of this as <br>consonant. All of them contain relationships which tug at the ear. If I had<br>a nice 8:10:12, or even 8:9:10:12 going on, I probably wouldn't want to add <br>some version of a dissonant 6th, or if I did, it would be for a musical reason <br>which would automatically suggest which pitch would be correct, for instance,<br>if the A were left sustaining from a previous F chord as we moved to a C<br>"add 9" chord then it would make sense as 5/3 and the dissonance against the <br>9/8 D would highlight its function and meaning.<br><br>My question would be, "why try to use a structure which doesn't suggest itself<br>musically?". If it occurs because of the juxtaposition of melodic fragments,<br>then it would both be justified by and serve to highlight those melodies.

It was constructed from <br>melodic considerations only, which means that ratios beyond the 3-limit are <br>of negligible importance. Ascribing 5-limit ratios to the diatonic scale is <br>in most cases, as I have said before, a historico-geographic fallacy, and a <br>very Eurocentric one at that.<br><br>It must be said, though it partially supports Matt's viewpoint, that many <br>cultures (the West, India, Arabia) seem to have discovered the 5-limit <br>relations through their SCHISMATIC, not SYNTONIC, approximations. It seems <br>that Pythagorean tuning was extremely well developed long before any <br>theoretical understanding of the 5-limit came about.<br><br>So something resembling a just diatonic scale did arise in all of these <br>cultures. In Pythagorean tuning, this is D E Gb G A Cb Db D. But this scale <br>is already "corrupted" by harmonic considerations.<br><br>The paradigm of similar tetrachords seems to be important for melodic <br>comprehensibility. This in itself can lead to many scales as are found <br>throughout the world, including some non-octave-repeating middle eastern <br>scales. The diatonic scale simply takes this concept to its extreme, as <br>tetrachordality manifests itself in every octave species. This requires a <br>single size of whole step, though I must admit that the syntonic comma is <br>too small to make the 5-limit JI diatonic scale very disturbing melodically. <br>Increase the size of the syntonic comma while keeping excellent 5-limit <br>approximations (try going from 34-equal to 22-equal to 15-equal) and the <br>scale does sound melodically incorrect. Melodically, I much prefer the <br>"Pythagorean" diatonic scale in 22-equal, where the thirds are tuned 7:6 and <br>9:7, to the 5-limit diatonic scale in the same tuning.<br><br>Ptolemy's scales (much like his astronomical models) seem to have been <br>derived from geometrical and mystical, not scientific (the appropriate <br>science for music is psychoacoustics), considerations, so they don't count. <br>I must qualify this by saying that Ptolemy did specifically mention the <br>psychological desirability of the division of the major third into two equal <br>parts, but felt that since all musical intervals must be measured <br>rationally, this could only be satisfied approximately! In this sense, JI is <br>but the imperfect temperament and something meantone-like is the Platonic <br>ideal!<br><br>The assertion that melody is aesthetically prior to harmony is of course a <br>subjective one, but something I have learned the hard way. As a child I <br>taught myself keyboard harmony, and equated composition of and meaning in <br>music to the harmonic progressions. But unknowingly, I was already obeying <br>melodic considerations in voice leading, etc. I once composed a progression <br>on guitar which, I had no idea until I wrote it down, alternated between <br>chords diatonic to the key and highly chromatic ones.<br><br>The diatonic scale defines tonality, and shifts thereof, in Western music. <br>Harmonic usage is, I believe, governed by harmonic-series or <br>small-integer-ratio-type considerations, but the melodic aspects are at <br>least as important for the overall effect of the music. Deriving the <br>diatonic scale from the tonic, subdominant, and dominant triads is utterly <br>inaccurate, in my opinion. There are too many pieces in major that focus on <br>I-ii-I progressions, and pieces in minor (aeolian, to be more academic) that <br>focus on i-VII-i progressions, for this to be an accurate explanation, for <br>not even the tuning of the chords will be correctly specified by such an <br>explanation.<br><br>>(I read, I think in Helmoholtz,<br>>about the comparative difficulty of solfege students to<br>>stay in tune as a group when accompanied by the (et)<br>>church organ and ease when unaccompanied and allowed<br>>to sign in JI.)<br><br>If they were not harmonizing but singing in unison, I seriously doubt that <br>they gravitated towards a scale with unequal whole steps, though Helmholtz <br>was clearly biased in favor of believing that they did!<br><br>>Comma shift is probably a misnomer too (like "wandering tonic").<br>>I'd rather think of it not as a "shift" to a different version<br>>of the same pitch class, but a movement to a new pitch class.<br><br>I don't think such an analytic framework would hold up if applied to <br>common-practice Western music.

First, when does a culture NEED a<br>precisely defined, standardized tuning system? Several possible answers<br>occur to me (though there may be others): 1) when it is desirable for<br>several fixed-pitch instruments to play together (the definition of<br>"fixed-pitch" may be a gray area, I know), 2) when there are instruments<br>with frets or a single sounding body per pitch (even then they don't<br>necessarily have to be standardized), 3) when there is an important<br>numerological justification.<br><br>Many cultures don't meet any of these criteria. Even those for whom #3 is<br>important, such as India, China, Persia, and (sometimes) ancient Greece,<br>there's often no evidence that these mathematical constructs had any<br>relationship to practice. Lacking that evidence, the possibility arises<br>that so-called Pythagorean tuning was invented as a way of describing<br>musical systems already in practice. While it's possible to derive scales<br>purely mathematically, I am skeptical that most scales, including the<br>diatonic, were initiated this way.<br><br>Perhaps scales evolve intuitively, though that intuition may be based on<br>mathematical models that may not be verbalized by the musician. (Thus the<br>octave is virtually universal, but musicians may not be aware that its<br>significance derives from its closeness to 2:1). Overblown fifths, small<br>number ratios, Pythagorean cycles, tendency towards equal step sizes, these<br>are all possible models for an (originally) unspoken basis for the diatonic<br>scale. If that's the case, I don't think it's possible to say for sure<br>which is correct from a historical point of view.<br><br>When dealing with non-fixed-pitch instruments, we are in even more trouble.<br>The deviations from a theoretical standard tuning system of a melodic line<br>sung by a voice alone or played on a bamboo flute alone can easily approach<br>the syntonic comma. Oh, I know, some of this may just be bad musicianship,<br>but I still think it's very problematic to derive a precise tuning system<br>from such music. Indian sources, it's true, give elaborate tuning<br>instructions for the vina, but nearly all of them, back to the vedas,<br>ascribe primacy to the human voice.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
