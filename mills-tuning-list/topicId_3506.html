Brown, 'Frequency ratios of spectral components of musical <br>sounds', Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, Vol. 99, No. <br>2, 1996, pp. 1210-19.<br><br>The article places considerable emphasis on methodology and accuracy <br>of measurement.  Some quotes and comments:   <br><br>"A recently developed high resolution frequency tracker. has made it<br>possible to measure the ratios of the frequencies of the upper<br>harmonics of a sound with respect to its fundamental frequency with<br>high accuracy.  Calculations were carried out on digitised sounds<br>produced by a clarinet, alto flute, voice, piano, violin, viola and<br>cello." (p. 1210). <br><br>For the sustained instruments in this group the frequency ratios of<br>spectral components (in this study the number of harmonics <br>considered (or at least, included in the graphs provided) for each <br>instrumental sound varied from 5 to 25) were in what Brown calls <br>'exact' integer relationship - that is, as exact as the accuracy <br>which the measuring process itself allowed.  As I understand this, it <br>was shown that spectral components will normally deviate from an <br>ideal harmonic series by no more than about 2-3 cents, but that <br>relative to the accuracy of the calculation smaller deviations could <br>not be detected. <br><br>"Continuously driven instruments such as the bowed strings, winds, <br>and voice have phase-locked frequency components with frequencies in <br>the ratio of integers to within the currently achievable measurement <br>accuracy of about 0.2%.  Since frequency fluctuations greater than <br>the measurement accuracy are inherent in any sound produced by a <br>human performer [on such an instrument], improvement of the <br>measurements is unnecessary.' (ibid., p. 1218). <br><br>I can't pretend to understand the detail of the methodology <br>to explain it to you.  But would be particularly interested to hear <br>Dave Hill's and other's reactions to the methodology, should <br>they be familiar with the article.<br><br>Also, more important, - Dave,  have you published your own <br>results? Sorry if I missed this somehow.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Patrick O-L</div>
