(510) 235-7478<br>smalin@well.com.<br>It runs on Mac and can be found from a link on the LucyTuning homepage at<br>http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy.<br><br>Instead of making any further comments about JI, nowadays my interests are<br>more concerned with producing music and attempting to find an effective way<br>to generate greater tuning precision, using the MIDI tuning dump.<br><br>BTW We have also been looking at EMagic and putting LucyTunings into the<br>environments for that program. At present we are again running up against<br>the<br>1/64th of a semitone tuning resolution problem, as it uses pitchbend.<br><br>If anyone has found an effective way to get the MIDI tuning dump to<br>generate better playback pitch resolution, please let us all know.<br><br><br>lucy@hour.com<br>http;//www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy</div>
