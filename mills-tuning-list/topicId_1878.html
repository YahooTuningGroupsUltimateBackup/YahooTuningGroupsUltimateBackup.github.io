E.g. words that refer to flowing water, like "stream",<br>tend to sound a bit like flowing water. <br><br>Abram argues that this can be explained by the fact that over the millenia<br>languages have internal dynamics that cause them to evolve in complex ways,<br>but the actual physical sounds of things stay constant. So this steady<br>reference point will tend to sort of entrain the complex language system, to<br>bring it into some kind of resonance.<br><br>Similarly it doesn't seem too outlandish to argue that the pitch and rhythm<br>structures that naturally occur could entrain the complex social dynamics of<br>musical practise. The natural structures being fixed, over a very long time,<br>even if they can exert only a weak force, they will tend to draw musical<br>practise into some kind of alignment.  <br><br>Jim<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 21 Mar 1997 08:39 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07599; Fri, 21 Mar 1997 08:39:16 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07605<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id XAA01175; Thu, 20 Mar 1997 23:37:47 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 20 Mar 1997 23:37:47 -0800<br>Message-Id: <2.2.16.19970320233403.3f3f9380@pacificnet.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
