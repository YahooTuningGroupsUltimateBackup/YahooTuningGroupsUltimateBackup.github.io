Normally, you<br>> define a full octave and extrapolate that.<br><br>Excellent. Thanks.<br><br>Also, I'm basically in agreement with all your responses to my <br>comments on the wishlist.  Of course, as you'lI understand, I treat<br>the list as a place to spark ideas rather a place to define what goes<br>out to anyone off-list.        <br><br>> The idea is to keep this as simple as possible, thereby raising the<br>> probability that these ideas <br>>will  be implemented.<br><br>Yes.  At the same time its worth saying (here) what you really *do*<br>want - in case someone here thinks of a way of simplifying it and<br>making it more likely to happen.  <br><br>> > 3. I'm unclear how far the last line of your high-end  spec<br>> > addresses the question of adaptive tunings  ("real-time updates of<br>> > note pitches is selectable per note as instant pitch correction or<br>> > new note only").   Could this be made clearer/ elaborated upon? <br>> > An option to invoke built-in, user-configurable adaptivity should<br>> > indeed be a requirement - at least in an ideal high-end machine. <br>> > How best to provide *user configurability* for real-time<br>> > adaptivit(ies) is not my area - but others might like to suggest?<br>> <br>> I'm open to any ideas on this.  I got the idea from the Justonic<br>> folks.  I use new note only updates myself.  They were more inclined<br>> to real-time updates, giving as an example barbershop quartets where<br>> a pitch swoop wouldn't be out of place.  The MIDI Tuning standard<br>> also requests real-time updates.  Do we really need both types<br>> available simultaneously?<br><br>Pass.  Is Bill (Sethares) on the list these days? any feelings on<br>this?  Neither is something I use at all, currently, but the option <br>would be hugely advantageous, and I'm sure I would were it <br>convenient.  Two major problems are (a) defining the logic (b) <br>making that logic configurable. One thought: personally, I think I <br>would be more or less content if this could be implemented as a <br>convenient 'post-production' technique.  But people who are <br>interested in using these machines for live performance would <br>presumably want more than this?  <br><br>> > 5. Measurements in Cents and/or Hz and/or *Ratios*(?).  To the<br>> > What-Limit?<br>> <br>> Again, we need to keep things simple for the manufacturers. <br>> Measurements in cents is all we need to define any scale.<br><br>Personally, I'm perfectly happy with cents only.  The idea of having a<br>unit that tunes in terms of ratios is, I think, rather interesting. <br><br>> > As regards interface: <br>> <br>> It's a good idea to give something like this as an example, but<br>> phrase them as being options.<br><br>Yes indeed: my example was meant to be just a suggestion to bounce<br>around. <br><br>> It's important to break away the things that make<br>> microtuning convenient from those that make it possible.<br><br>As an ex database programmer I guess I thought the interface I <br>described very simple.  Maybe not for a synth/sampler?  But yes, I<br>agree.  <br><br>> I'd really like to see any possible simplifications to the wishlist.<br><br>That might be acheieved by aiming a wish-list at a particular <br>forthcoming model from a particular manufacturer - choosing one <br>option only (from your three) and saying what you think is both <br>realistic and as near to ideal as will not be considered crazy for<br>that particular model.  I guess the thing may be carved in stone by<br>the time one hears of new models (?) but it seems worth a try.  No?   <br><br>I have drafted a letters to Roland/Akai but not happy with it yet.  <br>By the way, how would you feel if I referred to your wishlist URL <br>in it?<br><br>Patrick O-L</div>
