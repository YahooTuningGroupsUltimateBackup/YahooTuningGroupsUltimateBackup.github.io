I am woefully unequipped to do this, so have<br>offered instead to perhaps locate a hall of similar size that is held in good<br>regard.  <br><br>     Where are the really good 500-600 seat recital halls in this country?<br> It is important that the hall be suitable for a music school, i.e.,  all<br>kinds of instruments and voice, plus piano.   <br><br>     I would appreciate any suggestions.  They may send me to look at some of<br>these,  so I would like to start with recommendations from those possessed of<br>the critical listening (thus the addresses on this mini-spam). The tuning<br>list can delve into such small increments of musical scale, surely that is a<br>group of people that really listen.  Likewise the piano tech crowd,  where do<br>all you professional ears think the really good sounding halls are?<br><br>Thanks, <br>Ed Foote <br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 17 Apr 1997 01:03 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01657; Thu, 17 Apr 1997 01:03:25 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01655<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id QAA28309; Wed, 16 Apr 1997 16:01:23 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 16 Apr 1997 16:01:23 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199704161759.KAA26181@ella.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
