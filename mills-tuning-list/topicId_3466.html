I don't have experimental data to hand, but I remember evidence that<br>>low frequencies are perceived in a different way to high ones, probably<br>>because of this.<br>      I have read that the potassium (or magnesium or something like them),<br>uptake requirements for a nerve cell to "reload" and fire again requires<br>enough time so that a single cell can only trigger 600  times a second.  This<br>has repercussions when you are trying to transmit a 4,000 Hz signal over the<br>the ol' brain.  I believe that the "volley theory" attempts to explain the<br>process by which multiple hairs share the task of transmitting an appropriate<br>signal.  <br> <br>>The usual mechanism suggested for high frequency perception is that each<br>>hair in the inner ear responds to vibrations of a particular frequency,<br>>plus their harmonics.  <br><br>     The harmonics would be registered in a different location along the Organ<br>of Corti, would they not?    I mean, your ear doesn't necessarily know that<br>they are harmonics, does it?  It is just a set of frequencies that are being<br>received.  <br> <br>>In the Mandelbrot set, though, there is a<br>>fairly large period 3 region.   <br><br>   I have been reading of the Mandelbrot sets for a long time, but there is no<br>one around to actually discuss this with,  so I have a question: How do you<br>pronounce this name?  is is Mandel Brot as in "rot" or Brot with a long "o"?<br>( excuse the small pocket of ignorance here, but I gotta know. ) <br>Regards, <br>Ed Foote <br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashaville, Tn.</div>
