Until this<br>>find it was commonly thought that the "art" was the province of Cro-magnon.<br>><br>>The photo of the instrument indicaters a 4-hole instrument with only the<br>>middle 2 in good shape.  The holes were apparently punched through a<br>>smaller cave bear's femur.  Though it is called a flute throughout the<br>>article, there is nothing left of what initiated the sound (e.g. single<br>>edge, shakuhachi, fipple, etc.)<br><br>The next question for those McMaster researchers to address was whether<br>Neanderthals had proper lips and diaphragms for good flute technique; also,<br>since it has four-holes, this find must certainly tell us that Neanderthals<br>had a mere three digits per hand.<br><br>Next comes the terrible question of how Neanderthals notated their pitches.<br><br>Another question: did ASCAP distribute royalties for Neanderthals' campfire<br>performances?<br><br>-Adam<br><br>_________________<br>Adam B.
