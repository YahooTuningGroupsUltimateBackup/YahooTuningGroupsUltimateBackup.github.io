It's limited<br>to twelve note scales (-63 to +64), 1200/768 (100cent/64) resolution.<br>The range and number of tweakable parameters is terrific, making it<br>possible to obtain very professional results. Comes with a built<br>in computer interface (Mac & PC). Also, a 5-octave keyboard (with one<br>split point), pitch-wheel, & decent sounding 12 Watt stereo speaker<br>system. <br><br>You do however have to use a computer to do any tweaking, and turn<br>off local control, run the keyboard through a MIDI thru (hardware or<br>software,<br>I use the little freeware "OMS thru" on my PowerMac) and back into the<br>PSR-530.<br>A bargain at the equivalent of $500.<br><br>>yamaha and roland synths both have sysex messages for<br>>scale tuning, which allows you to change the tuning of all<br>>tones in one pitch class (all c's, all c#'s ..) in increments of 1 cent.<br><br>Actually, I believe Yamaha has fudged the terminology in the <br>manual for the PSR-530. The MIDI Master tuning can in fact be  tuned<br>-100 cent to -100 cent. But for microtonal tuning ("Scale Tuning" in<br>Yamaha speak), they could potentially confuse users with little<br>microtonal technical knowledge, because this is what they say :<br><br>"...alows each individual note of the octave to be tuned over the <br>range from -64 to +64 cents in 1 -cent increments (1 cent = 1/100th<br>of a semitone)."<br><br>These are actually 64ths of a semitone, aren't they ?<br><br>>the sysex messages are vendor specific and therefore different.<br>Yup, from what I've seen, Roland GS sysex microtuning messages<br>consist of a single 22-byte message, while the Yamaha PSR's XG<br>apparently requires 12 seperate 9-byte messages (one for each note).<br>This is how I do it. I'm waiting for clarification on some things<br>from Yamaha.<br><br>>general midi has master channel tune in increments of<br>>100/8192 cents (much finer)<br>>so it is possible to tune each channel separately.<br>Thanks for mentioning this possibility, Erich, it completely escaped my <br>attention. Could someone clarify : There is a MIDI MULTIPART "Detune" <br>parameter. It says : "-12.8..+12.7[Hz]" . So, what is the size of the <br>increments ? And does anyone here know how to write the Sysex message ?<br>The manual gives two "High-Mid-Low" Addresses, and says :<br>"1st bit3..0-> bit7..4" & "2nd bit3..0-> bit3..0"<br><br>There is also the RPN Parameter : "Fine Tune", which says <br>"[00H,00H] - [40H,00H] - [7FH,7FH]", <br>"(-8192*100/8192) - 0 - (+8192*100/8192)"<br>Same questions, what size the increments, and how goes the Sysex ?<br>If it's 0 to 8192, then I can figure out the Hex.<br><br>Just using a keyboard with atleast one split point, it is possible to<br>fool around with many equal temperaments. I've been giving it a bit of<br>thought and it should handle equal temps of upto 24 notes per octave.<br>All it entails is transposing both left & right sides to the same<br>"octave" range,<br>then tuning the both parts to the odd numbered pitches of an ET, and<br>shifting<br>the channel master tune so the pitches on the right hand become the even<br>numbered pitches of the scale. <br><br>I guess some of you do this already. Anyway, it's safer than<br>impersonating Penn & Teller.It's more flexible than tuning<br>individual channels, since you retain more polyphony.<br><br>>since a midi keyboard (or any other midi instrument)<br>>will produce notes only on one channel, you need a tool for <br>>rechannelizing. there is a freeware program <br>>midicable which allows you to do exactly that.<br><br>Here we go again ! Is this a Power Mac application or Windows ? <br>If it's Windows, can someone point to a Power Mac thingy for<br>rechannelizing  ?<br><br>Ciao,<br>Drew</div><h3><a id=8406 href="#8406">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/1998 5:31:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> if  X , Y  are two tone frequencies,<br>> how to tune the  value  Z=sqrt(X*Y)  acousticaly<br><br>   I'm not completely certain what in particular you mean by "acoustically"<br>in this particular case, but I suppose it's worth pointing out that, to our<br>logarithmic tuning perception, a geometric mean sounds like an arithmetic<br>mean.<br><br>   So, if by "acoustically" you mean "by ear", you can tune that<br>intermediate pitch so that the melodic interval size from the 1:1 to the<br>pitch in question sounds the same as the interval from the pitch in<br>question to the 5:4.</div><h3><a id=8407 href="#8407">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/1998 7:40:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Mon, 24 Aug 1998, Jan Haluska wrote:<br>> if  X , Y  are two tone frequencies, <br>> how to tune the  value  Z=sqrt(X*Y)  acousticaly<br>> ( sqrt(X*Y)  denotes the geometrical mean of the tones  X  and  Y )? <br>> Demonstrate the method on   X = 1,   Y =   5/4 .<br><br>In the general case, this is a Hard Problem.
