George Miller<br>wrote about this in his classic, "The Magical Number 7 Plus or Minus 2," in<br>which<br>he states that limitations on human information handling capacity allows<br>only<br>5-9 categories in each perceptual dimension. Most scales have 5 or 7 tones,<br>a few have 6, 8 or 9. Except in Western music, the whole chromatic set, of<br>whatever size and tuning, is seldom presented in one melody or section of a<br>piece. <br><br>Historically, 7 tone scales almost certainly evolved from pentatonics. This<br>is quite clear both from the Sumero/Bablylonian names of the strings and<br>the expansion of the major-third/semitonal "Olympian" pentatonic to the<br>heptatonic enharmonic of Greek theory (and practice) by splitting the<br>semitone into two<br>microtones. There is some evidence that a hexatonic was an intermediate<br>stage in which the semitone was split in only 1 tetrachord.<br><br>Similarly in China, the basic scale was pentatonic and the two added tones<br>were called pien-tones (neighbor?).<br><br>As for 9-tone scales in 31-tet, David Rothenberg and Connie Chan studied<br>this one: 5 3 3 3 3 5 3 3 3, generated by a chain of 14 degrees of 31-tet.<br> This scale is an MOS, is strictly proper, has "stability" of 1.0 and<br>"efficiency" of .7407. It is non-diatonic and has relatively few <br>approximations to 7-limit harmonic intervals. <br><br>One might want to continue the series to 11 and 20 tones.<br><br>I think recreational numerology of the type pioneered by Martin Gardner and<br>his literary alter-ego, the late Dr. Irving Joshua Matrix (and his Eurasian<br>daughter, Iva Toshiyori) is great fun. Hooey, yes, but FUN hooey...<br><br><br>--John</div>
