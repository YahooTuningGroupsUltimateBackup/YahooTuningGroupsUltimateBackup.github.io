Of course, this<br>> is a rather subjective perception, and maybe <br>>there's no right answer, just gut intuitions...Hstick<br>><br><br>Strangely enough, I find that I can agree with the responses<br>to this from both Gary Morrison and Johnny Reinhard.<br>System-building in music certainly goes a long way<br>towards satisfying one's intellectual proclivities, but<br>then in good performances, there always seems to<br>be room for expressive inflection.<br><br>The ultimate (and to me, surprising)  outcome of<br>the Hendrix Chord debate, for me, was that the<br>most intriguing interpretation of the chord was<br>that it is a *hybrid* of 12-ET and 7- (and/or<br>19-) limit just intonation.  This is clearly microtonal,<br>and it's precisely those small microtonal nuances<br>that come from bending the lowest  two notes to<br>approximate just ratios, and from having the<br>highest note a 12-equal ratio, which give the<br>chord the unique sound it has.  It certainly<br>sounds much more interesting played this<br>way than in straight 12-equal (although not<br>necessarily as interesting or consonant as<br>in any of the straight just-intonation versions).<br><br>By and large, my feeling about calling<br>the blues microtonal is that there is very little<br>actual harmonic movement -- the 12-equal scale<br>gives what I think is a good approximation of<br>a "tonic" (I) with its close Pythagorean relatives (IV<br>and V) -- but lots of exploration of higher-prime<br>identities within that restricted chord movement.<br>Even though the 12-equal "7th"  is between<br>29 and 33 cents sharper than the 7th harmonic<br>in all three chords, every chord in the blues<br>*always* has it, and to me, this reinforces the<br>idea that the 12-equal "7th" is intended by<br>blues musicians to be interpreted as the 7th<br>harmonic.  This is even more the case when<br>a good perfomer like Jimi compensates by<br>bending up other notes in the chord to make<br>the "7th" fit better.<br><br>Certainly, the guitar is a 12-eq instrument, but,<br>as Neil says, "there's micronotes galore because<br>of the bending and stretching that constantly goes on"<br>in the blues (I emphasize the word "constantly").<br><br>And don't forget --  the vocals are an integral part<br>of standard blues, and we know there's no<br>12-equal restriction there!  A great blues singer<br>like Robert Johnson or Louis Armstrong sings<br>notes that are all over the place, and between<br>all the cracks.  And when the techical ability<br>on the instrument is there, as it is in both Johnson<br>and Hendrix on the guitar or Armstrong on the<br>trumpet, the instrumental notes will be all over<br>the place too, quite closely related to what the<br>voice is doing.<br><br>Throughout musical history, the measure of a<br>great instrumental performer's ability  has been<br>how good he/she is at making the instrument "sing",<br>"wail", or "talk".  Note the reference to vocal<br>performance!  We can't always use the<br>construction of the instrument as a yardstick<br>when we're talking about such talented<br>performers.<br><br>To me, the blues is clearly a microtonal music,<br>the question is, how systematic are the<br>*just-intonation* implications that are buried<br>there in those notes?  In my opinion, 7 and 19<br>are definitely there.  What about 11, 13, and 17?<br>(I'm pretty sure I hear Robert Johnson singing<br>some 11s)  What about 23 and still higher primes?<br> <br>   Joseph L.
