A few off-the-cuff comments:<br><br>>John Chalmers informs me that some folks<br>>object to the idea of matching inharmonic<br>>timbres to inharmonically-derived tunings.<br>>Apparently, your contention is that the<br>>inharmonic tone complexes tones will be heard<br>>as having a virtual pitch entirely different<br>>from that of their component inharmonic<br>>partials.  Paul Erlich seems typical in<br>>these respects.<br><br>I don't even know what that could mean, so it seems unlikely that I said it. <br>What, exactly, is "my theory" on this subject? Can you quote something I <br>said?<br><br>Many of Brian's supporting references do not support him at all. Terhardt's <br>two components of consonance, I presume, are 1) critical band <br>roughness/beating and 2) spectral fusion/virtual pitch formation. Brian's <br>supporting references explain consonance and dissonance relations of <br>inharmonic timbres in terms of the first component, but not the second. <br>Brian then tries to interpret the existence of these consonance and <br>dissonance relations as evidence that spectral fusion/virtual pitch <br>formation is playing a role. Looks like bad logic to me. In particular, <br>Parncutt's work rests firmly atop Terhardt's, far from being the final nail <br>in Terhardt's coffin.<br><br>Brian says that only be putting the right inharmonic pitches together can <br>you get a true "inharmonic series." Can you provide a reference that could <br>lead to a definition or mathematical criterion for such a thing? Presumably <br>it has to be based on iterated continued fractions or transcendental roots <br>of transcendental numbers or a physical model, otherwise it just won't sound <br>right?<br><br>Yes, there are cues other than pitch that can make partials "fuse" to some <br>degree. And yes, the first component of consonance will exert an ordering <br>influence on compositions using inharmonic timbres, and can be used as a <br>principle to derive scales for these timbres. I don't think I ever said <br>anything to contradict that. Then again, Brian has a way of reading whatever <br>he wants into what people say, be it Gregory Taylor or Richard Parncutt. I <br>sure hope his musical skills are better than his communicative skills!<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 18 Jul 1996 03:34 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id SAA27706; Wed, 17 Jul 1996 18:34:30 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 17 Jul 1996 18:34:30 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01540b13ae13415f3c76@[131.172.160.53]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
