As a sometime author myself, I would like to say that <br>space alone does does not  permit every paper to list every conceivably <br>relevant reference. What an author should do is to list the most <br>pertinent <br>references in the expectation that truly interested readers will pursue <br>topic and author threads themselves. Bibliographies are primarily <br>intended <br>to give credit to previous investigators and data to support the author's <br>conclusions or hypotheses, not to filibuster for the reader's own <br>concerns. <br>Unless the paper is a general review article, the bibliography does not <br>have to cover the entire field of xenharmonics, only those items specific <br>to the topic at hand.<br><br>Paul Rapoport and I agree that Brian's attacks verge on being slanderous, <br>but like many of Brian's other papers, they contain interesting and useful<br>material beneath the hyperbolic rhetoric. Brian has uncovered and <br>described <br>some useful references which might otherwise be overlooked by other <br>scholars, though some appear to me to be redundant and repetitive  (I've <br>read Viggo Brun's articles in several languages and have found that the <br>most important details of his version of the Euclidean algorithm are <br>expressed equivalently). <br> <br><br>Follow-up on Gamelan posts:<br><br>From:    Susilo Joko <susilo.joko@STONEBOW.OTAGO.AC.NZ><br>Subject: Re: Electroacoustic Composition from Gamelan<br><br>'mbat larasati in the gamelan as far as I know is for shadow puppet<br>performances for example; gamelan STSI Solo, TBS Solo, Semarangan (Ki.<br>Nartosabdo), Notodiningratan and almost pupeteer's gamelan.<br><br>Joko Susilo<br>29b Spencer St<br>Andersons Bay<br>Dunedin<br>New Zealand<br><br>Tel.
