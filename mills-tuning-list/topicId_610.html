This money could have been well spent <br>on new recordings of his complete works.<br><br>Last month at Merkin Hall in NYC I heard US Highball <br>as performed by Newband. A true high point in my <br>concert going life. I have only heard the murky recording <br>on Enclosure 2. It would be a real shame if a Kronos <br>version was released before a Newband version. Or if a<br>Newband version on the original instruments was never<br>released at all!<br><br>I enjoy the Kronos version of Barstow, but do we need <br>yet another version of Barstow or Two Studies (of which <br>Kronos have not released a recording)? <br><br><br><br>      *      *      ..    *    ... .*    D a v i d   B e a r d s l e y<br>dmb5561719@aol.com        .     .      . *         .   .   ...      <br>              I M M P   &    B i i n k!    m  u  s  i  c  *        ..<br>     . ..         .*..            . .. .           ..* .     .    ..   . *. .<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 17 Jul 1996 23:17 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id OAA17256; Wed, 17 Jul 1996 14:17:05 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 17 Jul 1996 14:17:05 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v02130500ae130673a1b4@[192.168.11.209]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
