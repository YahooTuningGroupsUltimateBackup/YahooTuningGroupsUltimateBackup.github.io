SITAR OR the Spice Girls?  Your ear can tell<br>the difference immediately but now science is catching up.  Researchers in<br>Korea have new evidence that cultural differences in music can be<br> identified numerically, using the machinery of chaos theory.  "Chaos" is the<br>emergence of wildly unpredictable behaviour from seemingly innocent<br> physics. It is an immediate feature of the world around us, cropping up in<br>quantum theory, astrophysics, and mathematical economics, as well as the<br>weather and even the timing of<br> a dripping tap.  Despite apparent randomness, chaos is actually a<br>well-ordered phenomenon.  It is caused by extreme sensitivity of a physical<br>system to its initial state, meaning that tiny differences become magnified<br>as the system evolves. Unpredictability arises because<br> we cannot measure the system accurately enough. This is why weather<br>forecasting is so hard.  Chaos is sifted from randomness in systems by using<br>what is called "a phase portrait" - a diagram showing how the system evolves<br>from its starting state.  scientists look for regions in the phase portrait<br>where the evolutionary from many initial states converge. These areas are<br>known as attractors. For a simple pendulum, the phase portrait is just a<br>graph if the<br> pendulum's position against its speed, and the attractor is a circle.  But<br>as complexity increases,<br> the shape of the attractor becomes more convoluted.  Chaotic systems have<br>fractal attractors. Fractals are disjointed shapes which have the same<br> appearance when viewed on many different length scales. their complex<br>structure creates the illusion of randomness. Fractal attractors are<br>classified by a number, the "dimension",<br> which increases the level of chaos in the system.  Scientists have started<br>to look for phase portraits of speech and singing. "There is a tradition of<br>looking for fractal structure in music over the last decade or so"  says Ian<br>Stewart of Warwick University, "in a sense trying to characterise the<br>'texture' quantitatively." While irregularities in<br> speech were thought to be produced by simple randomness, evidence soon<br>emerged that<br> they were,in fact, caused by chaos in the vocal system.  Now a team headed<br>by Myeong-Hwa Lee, of Seoul national University, has studied the Korean<br>traditional song Gwansananyungma, the western song La Mamma Morta, and the<br>pure<br> note "Si". Plotting the volume of the sound on a phase portrait, they<br>established the dimension of<br> the attractor that each song converged to. Like the simple pendulum, the<br>pure note "Si" has a<br> roughly circular attractor confirming its single frequency and indicating<br>non-chaotic behaviour.  La Mamma Morta, however , has a more complicated<br>attractor, with a mildly chaotic dimension of<br> 2.5, while Gwansananyungma has a highly chaotic fractal attractor of 4.4.<br>It shows that the Korean song is more complex than its western number, which<br>Lee et al attribute to<br> the Korean vocal system and singing technique. More importantly, it shows<br>that voice patterns and<br> music can be quantified numerically. "All of this work will of benefit to<br>speech coding and other<br> technological uses," adds Lee. He now hopes the results, soon to appear in<br>the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, will enable him to<br>construct a detailed mathematical model of speech.
