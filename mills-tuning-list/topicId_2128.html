Some may even wish to defend the importance of <br>musical tuning in this widely read and respected scientific journal. <br>(Hint ;-) Nudge, nudge!. . . . . )<br> <br>Unnatural Tunes<br> <br>I hope that Charles Lucy succeeds in his attempt to reconstruct John <br>Harrison's experiments in tuning (letters, 19 April, p55).  However two <br>different questions are involved. <br>An alternative basis for deriving musical intervals may be of great <br>acoustical and mathematical interest in itself.  But its musical <br>significance may be slight. <br>Music as it has developed over the last five centuries has become <br>an entirely artificial system with an elaborate logic of its own.  <br>This depends upon a hierarchy among pairs of related keys in which <br>each key is regarded as all the others as a starting point, it being <br>only the direction from it that matters.  To make this equality <br>physically possible, all intervals other than the octave are very <br>slightly "cooked". <br>For most of us, the difference between the "cooked" and the natural <br>version is so slight that it becomes lost in the idiosyncracies of <br>performance.  <br>I rather suspect that, whether one considers Harrison's or any other <br>alternative basis for tuning, the same may prove to be true.  <br> <br>James Iliff, Llandovery, Carmarthenshire.  <br> <br> <br> <br>lucy<br> <br>http://www.wonderlandinorbit.com/projects/lullaby<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 9 Jun 1997 11:03 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02454; Mon, 9 Jun 1997 11:03:13 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 9 Jun 1997 11:03:13 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02699<br>Received: (qmail 943 invoked from network); 9 Jun 1997 09:02:50 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 9 Jun 1997 09:02:50 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541100afc049591d30@[207.207.2.20]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5634 href="#5634">ðŸ”—</a>ikowsoleea@evolution.org (Ivanildo Kowsoleea)</h3><span>6/13/1997 7:17:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Dear Gary,<br><br>>it comes to how the tuning affects them.

No, the guitar <br>(at least classical) is NOT a definite-pitched instrument <br>for that matter. Especially in sustained chords we do <br>manipulate the individual pitches of the tones that make up <br>the chord as to make the sound more pleasant, of course <br>also to compensate for non-ideal strings that may be <br>slightly out of tune especially when playing high up the <br>neck.<br><br>However I do agree with you that the sustained chords make <br>the bigger impression on the audience which limits the <br>argument.

No, the guitar<br>>(at least classical) is NOT a definite-pitched instrument<br><br>   The guitar fits in the category I described here as<br>"much-more-definite-pitched".  The piano is a definite-pitched instrument.<br><br><br>   I have played classical guitar as well as bassoon, saxophone, and viola<br>in the past, so I certainly do understand what you're saying.  Classical<br>guitarists especially are easily annoyed by the general public's<br>misconception that guitarists can't vary the pitch, especially downward.<br><br>   Still, on a guitar the struggle is much more to make the pitch DEVIATE<br>from the ideal to which it's tuned, whereas on a woodwind, brass, or<br>orchestral string instrument, the struggle is to make the pitch MATCH the<br>ideal.  (Yes, I do realize that I'm oversimplifying there, but only<br>slightly.)<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 14 Jun 1997 18:31 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA23106; Sat, 14 Jun 1997 18:31:35 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 14 Jun 1997 18:31:35 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA23147<br>Received: (qmail 23928 invoked from network); 14 Jun 1997 16:29:45 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 14 Jun 1997 16:29:45 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541100afc8d0c95677@DialupEudora><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
