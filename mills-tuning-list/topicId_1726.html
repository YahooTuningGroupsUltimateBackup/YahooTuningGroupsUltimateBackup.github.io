Aristoxenos (circa 330) complained<br>that the incomposite ditone in the enharmonic genus was being narrowed, <br>a process called "sweetening" presumably from the 81/64 to the 5/4.<br>This sounds very much like Archytas's 28/27 x 36/35 x 5/4 <br>enharmonic tetrachord. However, in the diatonic genus, Archytas's tuning <br>was septimal,( 28/27 x 8/7 x9/8)  skipping 5 altogether, and Aristoxenos <br>admits that this is a well known tuning (as 1/3 + 1 1/6 + 1 tones). <br><br>Ptolemy, nearly 500 years later, implies that this is the most <br>common diatonic tetrachord, though the Pythagorean 3-limit one is <br>also in use. His own Syntonic Diatonic, 16/15 x 9/8 x 10/9 may be <br>contrasted with the earlier Didymos's 16/15 x 10/9 x 9/8 tuning. This <br>latter scale is rather non-harmonic in our sense. It, Pythagorean <br>(Ditone Diatonic)  and Archytas's diatonic (Ptolemy's Middle Soft <br>Diatonic, Tonic Diatonic, etc.)  all have many 32/27 and 81/64 thirds <br>(the major scale has only 1). This suggests to me a possible avoidance <br>of 5 limit thirds until Ptolemy's time. This is also true of his mixed<br>modes which have predominantly septimal and pythagorean intervals.<br><br>Traditionally, the development of 5 limit harmony is ascribed to <br>late medieval English singers (fa-bourdon,etc.). I don't know of any data <br>supporting 5 or 7 limit harmony in Greece though some late writers <br>describe 5 and 7 limit intervals as "paraphonies" to distinguish them <br>from consonances (symphonies) and dissonances (diaphonies). Paraphonies <br>include, however, the tritone as well as thirds and sixths.<br><br>Tritriadics: I would tend to agree that the derivation of the major and<br>natural minor modes in JI from three triads to be somewhat artificial, <br>despite Rameau and Ellis (i.e. his 56 tonal modes). However, it is still <br>useful conceptually, even if comma  tweaks be desired in the ii and <br>VII (in minor) chords or the whole scale mapped into some convenient ET. <br>The derivation is more plausible in Meantone, as these chords would<br>be acceptable. <br><br>Other "fixes" are possible: one might do as Blackwood recommended for <br>some ET's, just  avoid progressions with ii and VII. One might also make <br>use of the 117 tones of Ellis's "Duodenarium," the 56 skhismatically <br>related tones of his "unequally just" tuning or  53-tet.<br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 25 Feb 1997 23:07 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18952; Tue, 25 Feb 1997 23:07:21 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18911<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id OAA04179; Tue, 25 Feb 1997 14:05:25 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 25 Feb 1997 14:05:25 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199702251701_MC2-11BC-C28E@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
