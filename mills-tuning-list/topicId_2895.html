There is nothing profoundly wrong<br>with this, as a harmless hobby ? it indicates a much more sympathetic<br>nature than the typical musician or composer, who simply does as he is<br>told, with the materials somebody assigns to him from on high. But much<br>deeper issues are involved in temperament and tuning; I have tried to<br>delve into some of these, I think with considerable success. If this<br>makes me an obnoxious bore with delusions of grandeur, it is the penalty<br>to be paid for being really fascinated with the subject at hand, and<br>willing to take it seriously enough to give it serious thought.<br><br>Apparently my comments about the rather evident failings of modern<br>Western academic musicians have been interpreted by a few as the ravings<br>of an uncultured brute. There is definitely such an animal; there is<br>also such a thing as an academic poseur devoid of true knowledge or even<br>real interest in his subject, who delights in producing 'music' that he<br>himself knows to be one vast practical joke. I touch on these matters<br>only as they relate directly to tuning matters; I have no inclination to<br>examine all music here. To observe that we live in a very strange<br>musical culture, where elaborately-trained composers produce almost<br>nothing that the masses want to hear, whereas the masses _did_ want to<br>hear a Mozart or a Beethoven or a Tchaikovsky, is not meant to insult<br>anyone; it is to state a fact. The noted music critic Henry Pleasants<br>published several good books on this subject. Now the masses prefer rock<br>music. It should be a matter of personal survival for academic musicians<br>to inquire why. For ultimately, the cozy little academic world, with all<br>its fine people making real, precious contributions (one thinks of the<br>scholars who have revived Renaissance polyphony) depends on popular<br>confidence and respect for its existence.<br><br>A century ago the music of the social elite differed from popular music<br>only in being more elaborate, but now it differs fundamentally. Go into<br>a typical university music library. You will see tens of thousands of<br>titles, but no more than a few dozen that study why Western music has so<br>dramatically split into two essentially alien traditions. Tuning and<br>temperament have some small part in this, and it is fully justified to<br>examine such questions here, insofar as they relate to the choice of a<br>tuning. This developing musical civil war within our culture does<br>definitely relate to our intonational habits and choices.<br><br>Finally, I do hope that the mere length of my posts is not offensive. On<br>some of the musical lists I have read it is not uncommon to find a<br>professor going on for 30 closely-typed pages. I have done nothing like<br>this, keeping in mind the words Tuning 'Digest'.<br><br>When I meet a crank or a bore, I usually ignore the rubbish, and try to<br>learn something. Usually even the silliest people know at least<br>_something_ that I do not know, and would never have known on my own. At<br>the least they often provoke me to think ? as I have certainly done for<br>several of the people here who profess to dislike my conclusions the<br>most.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
