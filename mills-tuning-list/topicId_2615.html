In any<br>case, it's not "worse" than 300 cents.<br><br>>>But there must be more-better examples.  Maybe: the 12TET minor 7th is 18<br>>>cents flat of a 9/5, and 22 cents south of the 9/5 we have 16/9.<br>>><br>>>You lost me. What are you trying to say/ask?<br><br>After the aside on the nature of dissonance, I wanted to return to my<br>original point to get some sense of closure, and so I offered a new example:<br>16/9 is more consonant than 1000 cents despite it being farther (in cents)<br>from 9/5.<br><br>>Schroeder's "Number Theory in Science and Communication" has been<br>>mentioned recently in this forum, and I don't know if his more 'popular'<br>>styled "Chaos, Fractals, Power Laws' has been mentioned.
