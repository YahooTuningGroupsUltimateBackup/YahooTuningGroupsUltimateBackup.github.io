Of<br>course all temperaments are cyclic by definition, in the sense that<br>their fifths return to the same point, with the exception indeed of a<br>few such as 24- & 34-tone equal which consist of two non-communicating,<br>parallel series of fifths. When I say the fifths are non-cyclic, I mean<br>that, although the thirds and sixths are consonant so long as one does<br>not modulate or use certain melodic intervals, nevertheless they give<br>rise to such dissonant thirds and sixths that the cycle of modulation is<br>broken. And not only the cycle of modulation, but of many melodic<br>progressions as well.<br><br>Your phrase "vanishing of the syntonic comma" is unfortunate. This comma<br>does vanish in the 22-tone equal, but at a value (218 cents) that leads<br>to excruciatingly dissonant 'major thirds' (436 cents), minor thirds<br>(273 cents), major sixths (927 cents) and minor sixths (764 cents) as<br>soon as one modulates more than a few keys. But even if one remains<br>within the same key, many intervals within the tonal fabric become<br>dissonant so long as fifths of 709 cents are preserved. To those who<br>treasure each new whining, commatic dissonance like the goose's golden<br>egg, and hate consonance with a passion, this temperament is indeed a<br>gift from the gods.<br><br>The major semitone (164 cents) and minor semitone (55 cents) are<br>utterly divergent from western habits, though the former is melodically<br>usable.<br><br>Another and simpler way of expressing the non-cyclic character of the<br>22-tone equal is to observe that the three consonant cycles (those of<br>the fifth, major third and minor third with their inversions) are<br>incommensurable. What this really entails is often overlooked. Some<br>theorists simply look at the 327- 382- & 709-cent intervals of 22-tone<br>equal, and conclude that this temperament has good representations of<br>the consonances. In doing this, they forget that as soon as one<br>modulates (or proceeds by any number of melodic phrases that involve the<br>simultaneous use of the 5- and 3- limits) one obtains highly dissonant<br>thirds, so long as the fifths are held consonant. This is doubtless<br>obvious to many theorists, but not to all. Mandelbaum, for example, a<br>person of no inconsiderable theoretical attainments, fell into this<br>trap.<br><br>It is meaningless to call a temperament non-cyclic in the sense that one<br>calls the just or pythagorean intonations non-cyclic. When I say that a<br>temperament is non-cyclic I mean that the three consonant cycles do not<br>agree with each other, and that the cycle of fifths does not close in<br>such a way to permit cyclic modulation, or indeed any but the most<br>constrained melodic progressions. 17- 22- 29- 41- & 53-tone equal all<br>fall into this category.<br><br>Our age is accustomed to very cavalierly dismiss every shred of musical<br>theory left to us by our ancestors - or else to blindly worship the<br>past. An academic minority is eager to deny every principle that the<br>past held dear - while the popular majority tends rather to preserve<br>certain musical elements in simplified form, while accepting many<br>non-Western melodic elements. The same people who detest the very idea<br>of consonance, without quite knowing why, are very often the same people<br>who blindly worship Beethoven or Mozart. Those who are truly "freemen in<br>thought" are respectful of the past at the same time that they<br>searchingly question it.<br><br>Indian singers - see Levy: Intonation in North Indian Music - do not<br>seem to use the 22-tone equal at all. They certainly do not sing<br>436-cent major thirds, which occur repeatedly in the melodic texture of<br>22-tone equal, unless very flat fifths of 655 cents are employed. Of<br>course the centre of 22-tone equal in India is nowadays supposed to be<br>the South.<br><br>Tuning now to a different issue, you appear to assume that because the<br>historic Arab theorists - most of them more concerned to interpret<br>ancient Greek theory than the practice of their own musicians -<br>prescribe or record a tuning, all are Neanderthals who do not fall down<br>before this tuning in awe. I certainly do not hold Arabic music in<br>contempt. I have devoted much attention to the subject. Gamelan scales<br>by the way can be very satisfactorily reproduced in 19-tone equal.<br><br>I am aware of the cents in a (12-tone equal) tone. Difference of opinion<br>need not give rise to random unpleasantness. Certainly I mean no offence<br>to anyone in stating what I am convinced are facts.<br><br>I had much rather be called a 'popularist' than an elitist.<br><br>Your attempt to equate pitch variation in the articulation of spoken<br>words with musical melody deserves careful consideration. Why, however,<br>would anyone wish to replace (or confuse) melody, which is reproducible,<br>and which is ideally meant to _heighten _ the effect of language or<br>poetry, with the articulation of spoken language, which is<br>nonreproducible, and a wholly different art besides. There have been<br>attempts in this direction, not all of them flat failures. Popular<br>singers occasionally lapse into spoken language for effect. But if this<br>becomes usual it is in very bad taste.<br><br>I do not deny that non-Western traditions use intervals different from<br>those commonly used in the West. Thank God that they do!<br>I do however categorically deny that any singers whatever (allowance<br>made for the occasional alien with 31-tone equal ears)<br>can reliably reproduce intervals narrower than 55-60 cents in melody.<br>Those who imagine I am insulting non-Western musical traditions in<br>making an observation of fact, misinterpret my motives. I am a great<br>admirer of Indian music and culture, for example. In the actual world<br>these musical traditions are under assault by the overwhelmingly<br>dominant 12-tone equal temperament (instrumentally considered.)<br>Meanwhile, paradoxically enough, our own popular music - vocal rock<br>music - is busily assimilating as much non-Western melos as it can. But<br>it is _not_ assimilating vocal melodic intervals less than about 60<br>cents in width, for the excellent and quite matter-of-fact reason that<br>singers cannot deliberately reproduce or remember such intervals. It is<br>easy to say: "oh yes they can," and I have no objection if someone<br>wishes to attempt to prove the contrary. The evidence is very much<br>against this, however. There are not a few advocates of 12-tone equal<br>who have managed to convince themselves that the melodic limen is in the<br>region of an equal semitone, which I also deny.<br><br>There does seem to be an elitest attitude abroad that one demonstrates<br>one's own musical superiority by hearing - or asserting that one hears -<br>extraordinarily minute intervals as essential melodic changes. One is<br>reminded of the bright young student who 'proved' that Helmholtz had<br>preferred just intervals to 12-tone equal ones only because he suffered<br>from a disease of the inner ear, that made his aural faculty<br>preternaturally sensitive!<br>Or again, I am reminded of the Greek theorists made fun of by<br>Aristoxenos - very estimable persons, no doubt - who cared nothing for<br>living or practical music, but who occupied themselves with ceaseless<br>attempts to distinguish ever narrower intervals. Meanwhile, around them<br>even the enharmonic was abandoned, perhaps for want of any such firm<br>theoretical basis as the 19-tone equal might have provided them.<br><br>Music is primarily a creative, not an exhibitionist art.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  More on 22-tone equal<br>PostedDate:  12-12-97 07:00:58<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  12-12-97 06:59:06-12-12-97 06:59:07,12-12-97 06:58:51-12-12-97 06:58:51<br>DeliveredDate:  12-12-97 06:58:51<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656B.0020DC83; Fri, 12 Dec 1997 07:00:52 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13441; Fri, 12 Dec 1997 07:00:58 +0100<br>Date: Fri, 12 Dec 1997 07:00:58 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13447<br>Received: (qmail 8600 invoked from network); 11 Dec 1997 22:00:52 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 11 Dec 1997 22:00:52 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3491353D.D5B@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
