An electric guitar does not feedback through magnet loops, I have<br>done this with home made E-bow like things (electromagnetic bows) and the<br>sound is much different. What you hear is the speaker moving enough air to<br>move the body of the guitar, this then moves the strings. If the the strings<br>are stopped then you will hear squealing which is usually through the pickups<br>which, when older and not waxed, will act as poor microphones at the same<br>time as electromagnetic pickups. <br> A string will move sympathetically but usually it is the body it is attached<br>to which is designed to radiate sound, and therefore sensitive to sound<br>itself, which moves most.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 02:07 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02337; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 02:07:26 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02293<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id QAA15401; Sun, 2 Mar 1997 16:27:00 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 2 Mar 1997 16:27:00 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.995299@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
