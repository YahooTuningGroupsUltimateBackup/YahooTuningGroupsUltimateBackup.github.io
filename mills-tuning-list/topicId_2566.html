I have mentioned it to a<br>few people off list, and no-one's been fantastically excited,<br>but then no-one said they'd heard of it before either.  It's far<br>too obvious to be original, but I'll present it to the list<br>anyway...<br><br>If you aren't familiar with schismic temperaments, well, I can't<br>be bothered to explain them now.  The intervals can all be defined<br>in terms of an octave and a fifth.  At the moment I'm using a<br>just octave and a fifth of exactly 702 cents.  This scale is good<br>for 7-limit harmony (maximum error 5.5 cents for 7/5).<br><br>You could define the scale with any basis of 2 notes, though.<br>Here's an example:<br><br>        (rho) = (  8 -5)H'<br>        (pi)    (-19 12)<br><br>for the tuning above, rho=90 cents and pi=24 cents.<br><br>Now, you fit the scale to the keyboard as follows:<br><br>C     D         E      F         G     A         B      C<br> pi pi rho-pi pi rho-pi pi rho-pi pi pi rho-pi pi rho-pi<br><br>The letters A to G here, and for the whole of this post, refer<br>to keys and not notes.  The scale repeats over this fourth.<br>The keys are tuned as follows in cents:<br><br>              C     0000  0498  0996  1494  1992<br>              C#    0024  0522  1020  1518<br>              D     0048  0546  1044  1542<br>              Eb    0114  0612  1110  1608<br>              E     0138  0636  1134  1632<br>              F     0204  0702  1200  1698<br>              F#    0228  0726  1224  1722<br>              G     0294  0792  1290  1788<br>              GA    0318  0816  1314  1812<br>              A     0342  0840  1338  0836<br>              Bb    0408  0906  1404  1902<br>              B     0432  0930  1428  1926<br><br>I think these are right anyway: I don't usually use cents.  That<br>gives you a full 4 octave keyboard, which is enough for most of<br>us.  Most synths will allow you to tune up and down in octaves<br>so that you can choose the right register.<br><br><br>Now, there are 12 black notes to an octave in his mapping.  I<br>think of these as being the base scale, whith the white notes<br>as alterations.  If you worry about absolute pitch, set one<br>of the Bb keys to 440 Hz.  You could retune to a 17 note scale<br>on the white notes, but I prefer to hit black notes with these<br>extended mappings.<br><br>This has all the same diatonic logic as a 12 note meantone<br>octave.  I find it really liberating to be able to try out<br>comma shifts so easily.  Anyway, see what you think.<br><br>A fifth is 17, a major third 9 and a minor third 8 notes.<br>A triad formed from these intervals will be in tune provided<br>no more than one note is white.<br><br>7/6 covers 6 notes.  For this to be in tune, the lower note<br>must be either the C#, D, E, F#, A or B key.  You can work<br>out 7-limit chords from that.<br><br>Seriously folks, if you've got full keyboard tuning, try this<br>out.  It's the next best thing to a generalized keyboard.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  William Sethares <sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Subject:  13th root of 3<br>PostedDate:  23-10-97 22:22:38<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  23-10-97 22:21:50-23-10-97 22:21:50,23-10-97 21:22:29-23-10-97 21:22:30<br>DeliveredDate:  23-10-97 21:22:30<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256539.006FD8B3; Thu, 23 Oct 1997 22:21:39 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA25709; Thu, 23 Oct 1997 22:22:38 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 23 Oct 1997 22:22:38 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA25504<br>Received: (qmail 2541 invoked from network); 23 Oct 1997 13:22:34 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 23 Oct 1997 13:22:34 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199710232021.AA20171@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
