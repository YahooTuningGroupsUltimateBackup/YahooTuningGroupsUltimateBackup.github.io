I did not mean that he actually did modulate<br>the entire diamond.<br><br><br>>While there are a few places where reeds need to be changed on the<br>>Chromelodeon, they don't represent wholesale modulation of the diamond.<br><br>I know it.<br><br><br>>Erv Wilson tells a story about Partch playing fragments from _Water, Water_<br>>for him during the composition. Partch had come up with something that he=<br>><br>>couldn't analyse and asked Erv for his help. Erv pointed out that Partch<br>>was trying to modulate to the dominant, and when a tone wasn't available<br>>simply took the nearest pitch on the Chromelodeon!<br><br>That is a fantastic story!  I have enough love for stories about Partch or<br>Wilson, let alone a story involving them both!<br><br><br>>Partch's tonal practice can be heard as going through three major phases<br>>the first was characterized by the microtonality necessary to translate<br>>spoken intonation (Li Po settings, the Psalms, the Wayward), the principle<br>of >symmetrical inversion around the tonic and the six identity harmony led<br>to >the diamond which characterizes the second (peaking at Dark Brother and<br>>Even Wild Horses), and in the third, dominated by the percussion<br>>instruments, Partch made an extremely free use of his tonal resources, and<br>>his previous use of non-harmonic tones often dominates the music (Castor<br>>and Pollux and ...Petals... deserve special mention in this regard).<br><br>Hmm.  Interestin'<br><br><br>>Much of what Mr. Lumma may identify as 'modulation' may in fact be either<br>the >free practice of the later music or what Partch calls 'tonal flux' in<br>his >book.<br><br>Most certainly it is.  "Tonal flux" is a type of modulation in my book.<br><br><br>>The tonal flux examples in the book are, in fact, progressions<br>>that dominate his practice. The alternating triads 7/6-7/5-7/4 and<br>>8/7-10/7-12/7 are found, among other places, as the ostinato in The Letter<br>>and among the Choruses of Oedipus to separate strophes. Similarly, one<br>>Chorus in Oedipus alternates strophes based on the 11/8U-16/11O chordal<br>>pair.     <br><br>I am very impressed by your knowledge of Partch's work.  Are you familiar<br>with _Dreamer_ or _Delusion of the Fury_?<br><br><br>Carl</div>
