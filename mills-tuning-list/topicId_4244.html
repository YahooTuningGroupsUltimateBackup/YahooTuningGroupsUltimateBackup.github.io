Can somebody show a method for finding which tunings will support a<br>>>given rank-order matrix?  Preferably one that works on both just and<br>>>equal step scales?<br>><br>>What's a rank-order matrix?  Can it apply to meantone-type or Keenan-type<br>>scales as well?<br><br>A graphic method of determining propriety, no matter how many unique<br>interior intervals a scale has (Chalmers' formula only works for two) is to<br>construct its "interval matrix".  This is just its Lambdoma or Tonality<br>Diamond.<br><br>To make a "rank-order matrix", take this diamond and replace each<br>interval's logarithmic magnitude with a number ranking it's size relative<br>to all the other intervals in the diamond.  Thus, any subset of an equal<br>temperament that uses all the intervals in the temperament will have<br>identical interval and rank-order matrices.  Example: diatonic scale in 12tET.<br><br>This idea is that several scales, each having a different interval matrix,<br>may all be percieved as re-tunings of eachother if they share the same<br>rank-order matrix.  This works for meantone scales, so far as I can figure.<br> What's a Keenan-type scale?<br><br><br>>>2. Can a proper scale with one and only one ambiguous interval in each<br>>>mode exist?<br>><br>>I don't know what modes have to do with it, as all modes of a scale have<br>>the same intervals, but isn't the usual diatonic scale in 12-tone equal<br>>temperament an example?<br><br>Isn't it amazing how many definitions the word "interval" has?  Here, I<br>meant a (number of scale steps, acoustic magnitude) pair.  So no, the usual<br>diatonic is not an example; the tritone is not a type of fifth in the<br>natural minor.<br><br><br>>>3. What about a proper scale with one and only one ambiguous interval<br>>>in each interval (steps) class?<br>><br>>An ambiguity occurs between two intervals, therefore it is hard to know<br>>what you mean by "one ambiguous interval." How about C D E F# G# in<br>>12-tET?<br><br>Let's take a look at its "interval matrix"...<br> <br>      (C)  (D)  (E) (F#) (G#)<br>2nds   2    2    2    2   *4       <br>3rds  *4   *4   *4   *6   *6 <br>4ths  *6   *6   *8   *8   *8<br>5ths  *8   10   10   10   10<br><br>And rank-order matrix...<br><br>      (C)  (D)  (E) (F#) (G#)<br>2nds   1    1    1    1   *2       <br>3rds  *2   *2   *2   *3   *3 <br>4ths  *3   *3   *4   *4   *4<br>5ths  *4    5    5    5    5<br><br>Modes are the columns, interval classes the rows.  Ambiguous intervals are<br>marked by stars.  My questions are then: 1. Can a scale exist that has one<br>and only one star in each column?  2. Can a scale exist that has one and<br>only one star in each row?<br><br>Aside from being fun, I think these are useful questions.  For me,<br>ambiguous intervals are the common tones of a type of "melodic modulation".<br> You don't want too many or too few.  In fact, I think I care more about<br>ambiguous intervals than I do contradictory ones.<br><br>Carl</div>
