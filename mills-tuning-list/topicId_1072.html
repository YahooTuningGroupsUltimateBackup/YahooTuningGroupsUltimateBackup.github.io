This slow prelude to my comments follows a year of internet <br>experiences which seem to demonstrate a propensity for misunderstanding <br>in using the medium.<br><br>Perhaps it is the notation that is at fault, since it symbolizes intent.  <br>Maybe we will eventually communicate more fully in music. :)<br><br>That said, I think it's time to dig up an old enthmusicology chestnut:  <br>There are 2 kinds of notation - prescriptive and descriptive.  For <br>example, when a composer writes things for him- or herself that only he <br>or she fully comprehends, that is dscriptive (of the music).  To be <br>prescrptive is to notate for others to enact the music.  Ben's notation <br>leans to heavily back to descriptive based on past experiences with his <br>music.  No Ben was not happy with the "slow performance" of his Hockett <br>for bassoon and tuba.  The tubist could only go so fast with his <br>quartertone instrument making all the pitch adjustments, following an <br>incredible amount of study to calculate the pitches "perscribed."<br><br>Maybe this is where theory breaks away from practice.  Please give me the <br>information that the computer is privy too if it is performance you <br>want.  If you want me to translate from Hertz, then you are providing a <br>serious impediment before an eventual performance.<br><br>I like the idea of a Lingua Franc, especially since I have always <br>believed that all music is microtonal from a cross-cultural <br>perspective.  No, one should change the notation for Charles Ives, for <br>example, because Ives wanted flats "flatter" and sharps "sharper" (his own <br>directions fully corraborated by Kirckpatrick and in several palces by Ives).<br><br>However I have to change Carrillo's number notation to cents in order to <br>achieve performances (except for the 96-tone harp which does well in <br>int).  MicroMay '97 will feature a double choir work of Andrea Gabrieli <br>which I transcribed from neumes.  Is this permissible in order to achieve <br>performance?<br><br>Performances, if it is  deemed important for the future of microtonal <br>music (and just intonation composers never fail to include themselves as <br>"microtonalists" when a possible performance of their works is involved), <br>need every advantage to suceed.  Frankly, they are endangered in our <br>culture.  It has been most helpful that the word "microtonal" has been <br>adopted so readily in the past 5 years.  Similarly, it would be terrrific <br>if today and tomorrow's players could count on understanding how to read <br>and perform any and all tunings.  Cents makes the most sense.<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@ios.com<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 30 Oct 1996 18:00 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04370; Wed, 30 Oct 1996 18:01:23 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03063<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA17679; Wed, 30 Oct 1996 09:01:20 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 30 Oct 1996 09:01:20 -0800<br>Message-Id: <91961030170119/0005695065PK5EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
