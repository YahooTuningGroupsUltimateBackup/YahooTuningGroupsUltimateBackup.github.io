That book also<br>has some musical content and is not as terse (although Schroeder is<br>rarely terse).<br>        Also, I built a pair of his reflection phase gratings (supposed to<br>spread a wide band of audio frequencies evenly over about 180 degrees<br>when used as a sound baffle) as per the<br>equations in NTSC and did an informal test on a room full of high school and<br>college mathematics teachers. Most (over 70%, by my recollection) could hear<br>the difference between gratings and no gratings, and of those about 90%<br>(again, by recollection) preferred the sound with the gratings.<br><br><br>John Starrett<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Patrick Ozzard-Low" <patrick.ozzard-low.itex@norfolk.gov.uk><br>Subject:  Acoustic Instruments for the 21st Century<br>PostedDate:  06-11-97 13:39:53<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  06-11-97 13:38:50-06-11-97 13:38:51,06-11-97 12:39:13-06-11-97 12:39:14<br>DeliveredDate:  06-11-97 12:39:14<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256547.0045770C; Thu, 6 Nov 1997 13:38:44 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04724; Thu, 6 Nov 1997 13:39:53 +0100<br>Date: Thu, 6 Nov 1997 13:39:53 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04725<br>Received: (qmail 4128 invoked from network); 6 Nov 1997 04:39:36 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 6 Nov 1997 04:39:36 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199711061234.MAA12816@imail.norfolk.gov.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
