I listened to the DAT in several<br>recording studios here in Nashville, (places I have worked in and around for<br>years, big places!), and some country producers and musicians found their way<br>in to listen. It has been very interesting to hear the comments of Totally<br>12TET ears as they listen to a Kirnberger III on a 9' Steinway.<br>       So far, the reactions are split.  In regard to the Thirds, the<br>increased tempering above the key of Amaj seems to call attention to itself<br>in about half the listeners.  The increased consonance in the keys with less<br>key signature is noticed by slightly less than half, and get this...... a<br>number of "professionals" have not noticed a difference! <sigh><br>       There is still one studio here that is keeping the piano in<br>well-temperament, several songwriters have switched their home pianos over to<br>"weird-tuning", so the alternate tuning crusade is still on.<br>      Oddly enough, the vocalists have really taken to the changes; a comment<br>was, "the first time through, I was sorta off, because it sounded different,<br>but as soon as I relaxed, it was the most effortlessly I have sung in<br>years!".  I think I could probably drop a 1/4C meantone on them without<br>scattering the crowd.<br>       I am still operating on the thought that people will grow more<br>harmonically aware via the acceptance of anything other than 12TET.  That<br>first step off the familiar is important, and we are going to see if Ludwig<br>Van's stuff on a Well Tempered Steinway helps some of them over the hump.<br>       More later,  if it is not too much shameless self-promotion,  I will<br>be glad to notify the list when this CD is available.<br>Regards to all,<br>Ed Foote<br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn.<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu<br>Subject:  Re: tony conrad<br>PostedDate:  22-08-97 02:25:02<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  22-08-97 02:25:02-22-08-97 02:25:03,22-08-97 02:22:57-22-08-97 02:22:57<br>DeliveredDate:  22-08-97 02:22:57<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564FB.00024984; Fri, 22 Aug 1997 02:24:58 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18834; Fri, 22 Aug 1997 02:25:02 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 22 Aug 1997 02:25:02 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18825<br>Received: (qmail 29531 invoked from network); 21 Aug 1997 22:49:40 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 21 Aug 1997 22:49:40 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01510104b0220f4ac900@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
