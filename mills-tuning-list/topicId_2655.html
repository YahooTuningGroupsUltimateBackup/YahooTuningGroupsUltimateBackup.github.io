There is no such thing, and the<br>longer I explore tunings, the more I see that a tuning is good for what<br>it's good for...whatever that may be. I like 19, for example, because I<br>can expand on forms such as jazz and blues, and get many more interesting<br>chordal combinations than 12. But, 19 ain't gonna work so hot in one of<br>Reinhard's polymicrotonal string quartets. My personal way of seeing<br>tunings at this point (and don't take this too literally) is that they<br>are (sort of) modes of the harmonic series, just as dorian, phrygian,<br>etc. are modes of the diatonic scale...except that there is literally an<br>infinity of tunings, depending on how one combines the notes. To me, that<br>is a fascinating concept, and one which insures that those who wish to<br>study tunings will never become bored...Hstick<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Erik Nauman <ENauman@TrevorDaySchool.pvt.k12.ny.us><br>Subject:  RE: TUNING digest 1242<br>PostedDate:  20-11-97 00:16:38<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  20-11-97 00:15:18-20-11-97 00:15:19,20-11-97 00:15:26-20-11-97 00:15:27<br>DeliveredDate:  20-11-97 00:15:27<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256554.007FB9E7; Thu, 20 Nov 1997 00:15:06 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03380; Thu, 20 Nov 1997 00:16:38 +0100<br>Date: Thu, 20 Nov 1997 00:16:38 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03378<br>Received: (qmail 2771 invoked from network); 19 Nov 1997 15:16:35 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 19 Nov 1997 15:16:35 -0800<br>Message-Id: <c=US%a=_%p=Trevor_Day_Schoo%l=EX1-971119231246Z-3488@ex1.trevordayschool.pvt.k12.ny.us><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
