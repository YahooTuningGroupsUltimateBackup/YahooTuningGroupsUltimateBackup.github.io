That is because <br>the only intersections in the above CPSs are between CPS iand CPS i1, <br>namely,<br><br>CPS (j+1)/k (a(1),a(2), . . . ,a(k)),<br><br>whic are mere "borders" of dimension k-1.<br><br>Now it is customary to view these Euler-Fokker genera as cubes, hypercubes, <br>etc., but if we view the CPSs as regular polygons, polyhedra, etc. (by <br>making the axes at 60-degree angles from each other), we obtain fascinating <br>results about regular tilings of k-dimensional space, since obliquely <br>stretched cubes tile just as well as cubes!
