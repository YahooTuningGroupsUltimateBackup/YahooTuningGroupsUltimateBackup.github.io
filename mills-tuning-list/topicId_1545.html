These pitch sets<br>> are often very idiosyncratic and rarely contain any semblances of small<br>> integers beyond the 3-limit.<br><br>Yeah, I hear that too. Perhaps it is more a phenomenon of the melody and the<br>pitch set developing together rather than one generating or limiting the other.<br>Either way, I hear in my own imagination, music which is not limited by a<br>pitch set, but is more guided by intervalic connection, especially in <br>regards to chord progressions and continuous modulations. I also get the <br>sense that there's more to the expressive nature of melody than picking<br>from a set. Starting with just a wail, which is a glissando with a curvature<br>which evokes emotion, there's something going on there with regards to shape<br>and time which is transcendent of the idea of a "scale".<br><br>> >> ...I have written a (mostly) triadic piece where successive shifts of<br>> >> chromatic semitones, 36/35s, 49/48s, and a limma, adding up to a perfect<br>> >> fourth, have a certain melodic integrity, but only in 22-tet because all<br>> >> these intervals are represented by 55 cents!<br>> <br>> >I'm not sure quite what you mean, those 3 intervals don't add up to 4/3.<br>> >I'd like to hear your piece though. Is there any way I can?<br>> <br>> Which 3 intervals? I mentioned 4, <br><br>I see.<br><br>> and I did not specify the number of times<br>> each occurs, <br><br>Ah.<br><br>> except to say that the last occurs once. Well, numbering the<br>> four intervals in question from 1 to 4, they go like this: 1 2 3 2 1 4 2 3<br>> 2. That adds up to a 4/3. <br><br>Or to 22tet's approximation of 4/3.<br><br>> I play this piece so much that people are humming<br>> long sequences of successive 55-cent intervals, which tells me it's good<br>> enough to include on my first tape of 22-tone music (I'm still waiting for<br>> the guitar, though) despite its having nothing to do with my theories. So<br>> I'll keep it to myself for now.<br><br>Ok.<br><br>Matt Nathan<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 14 Jan 1997 13:35 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12091; Tue, 14 Jan 1997 13:38:20 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12152<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id EAA20868; Tue, 14 Jan 1997 04:38:14 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 14 Jan 1997 04:38:14 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701140736_MC2-EB6-F54D@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
