Unfortunately, I cannot send the "actual" notation by<br>> e-mail.  Suffice it to say that muddling over how to calibrate a pitch<br>> through a succession of mathematical processes is unneccessary.  Cents<br>> makes sense.<br><br>These cents approximations must be: 70 cents down -- a flat sign; 22 cents up <br>-- a plus sign. Since an Fb+ is rather out-of-the-way, I'll show one way to <br>arrive at an Ab+ instead, since all we're interested in is the combination of <br>signs which shift the pitch in different directions. Here's one path through <br>the 5-limit lattice from C to Ab+, letter-names on the left, corresponding <br>ratios on the right:<br><br>            Ab+   C+                  81/50    81/80<br>                  F+                           27/20<br>                  Bb    D                      9/5     9/8<br>                        G                              3/2<br>                        C                              1/1<br><br>So, for instance, the player might be required to ascend a fifth (3/2) from C <br>to G, then a minor third (6/5) from G to Bb; this process is then repeated, <br>leading from Bb to F+ and finally to Ab+. Fifth, minor third, fifth, minor <br>third -- nothing more complicated. Where's an Ab without a plus sign then, <br>and what would that mean?<br>               <br>                Ab      C                     8/5       1/1<br><br>The Ab without further inflections is the normal just minor sixth above the <br>C. An acquaintance with such lattices induces performers to think of the <br>different inflection signs as steps along different axes of the lattice and <br>not merely up or down a pitch continuum. Where are the conflicts then? <br>Nowhere, except in the eye of someone who takes pride in refusing to discover <br>how Ben Johnston's notation works. I'll assume that Johnny Reinhard is not <br>taking issue with the difficulty itself, but with what he sees as unnecessary <br>difficulty; but when a composer wishes that the performer should, as far as <br>possible, understand and hear the intervallic relationships in the <br>composition, then presenting the performer with cents deviations is no longer <br>an option (and deviations from what? -- who is able to intuit frequency <br>relationships based on 2^[1/12]?). Ben's notation is simply the one correct <br>notation for his own music; the application of this notational system outside <br>Ben's works can only be justified on the merits of individual cases. For <br>Partch, it is arguably successful, but there would be little point in <br>reworking, say, Xenakis's quarter-tones in any extended JI notation (in <br>general, building bridges between Ptolemaic and Aristoxenian territory is a <br>thankless, and usually pointless task).<br><br>Cents notation, in any case, erects an equal-tempered default, which is the <br>last thing any JI composer would wish to invoke. So is Ben Johnston's <br>notation the perfect language of tuning into which all systems can and should <br>be translated? Not in the least. Is it the best system for Ben Johnston's <br>music, with the potential for successful application in many other areas <br>because of its consistency and lucidity? Yes.<br><br>A parting comment on my own theoretical home ground: I've seen various <br>articles which purport to explain certain historic keyboard tunings; on <br>reading through them, I find that they never go beyond cents notation, which <br>cannot even begin to explain how the tunings were devised, which would <br>require a mixture of ratios and inflections by the roots of one or other <br>comma. The most cents notation can tell us in such circumstances is the <br>audible effect of the tuning, which is very well in itself, but empty of <br>explanatory content. Our lives would be very different today if the sciences <br>had remained on this level of incomprehending taxonomy.<br><br>(And by the way: yes, that message to Adam Silverman was not intended for the <br>list -- the first time I've made the classic e-mail list slip; on one list I <br>received a message from a subscriber to his sister, asking for her advice on <br>the proposal of marriage he was about to make. Mine was slightly less <br>embarrassing, but bad enough.)<br><br>-- <br>Jonathan Walker<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 28 Oct 1996 17:17 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05292; Mon, 28 Oct 1996 02:09:35 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07075<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id RAA12537; Sun, 27 Oct 1996 17:09:32 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 27 Oct 1996 17:09:32 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9610271940.A9804-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
