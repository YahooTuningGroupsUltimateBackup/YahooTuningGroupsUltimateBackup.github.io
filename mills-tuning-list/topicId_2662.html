But I've had some email correspondence<br>recently with Anne about playing the Kingma flute, which she now<br>uses.  Although, as she says, this instrument is not what one might<br>call a 24-ET instrument, it is specifically built, as a<br>'quarter-tone' flute, using Eva Kingma's key-on-key mechanism.  To my<br>knowledge this is the only specifically designed non-12-ET<br>commercially avaliable professional concert woodwind.  It is<br>certainly advertised by Osten-Brannen as the world's first 'fully<br>quarter-tone flute'.<br><br>Carl wrote:<br>> Certain people seem to be making the assumption that<br>> certain woodwind and brass instruments are designed to play in 12<br>> equal.  This is not the case.  (If they were, the designer's didn't<br>> do so hot).<br><br>Well, different manufacturers do different things.  Look for<br>example at O. Lee Gibson's book called 'Clarinet Acoustics' to see<br>the extent of these differences.  Two points on this are very<br>important. Firstly, as Johnny Reinhard rightly points out,  woodwind<br>and brasswind are instruments of semi-variable intonation. (ie., they<br>are not of fixed intonation, like the piano, nor are they without a<br>mechanism which encourages discrete steps, like the violin).<br>Woodwind performers instinctively adjust pitch as a matter of course,<br>in all music.  Secondly, manufacturers do go to some lengths the make<br>their instruments so that the scale is correct, and as near as<br>identical as possible on every instance of the same model.  What a<br>manufacturer considers 'correct' may vary very slightly.  But in<br>general, it seems that much effort is put into actually 'centering'<br>the resultant pitches which arise, by equalling out factors of breath<br>pressure in tests etc . And the 'model' is certainly 12-ET.  If this<br>were not the case, there would hardly be so much mathematical theory<br>for woodwind tone-hole design (even if, it won't necessarily give the<br>right results!!), nor computer programs for same.<br><br>Hstick wrote:<br>>     Also, I totally agree with Reinhard that if "microtonality" had been<br>> taught in our schools all along, it would be much more accepted now. I<br>> have found, in fact, that once you let people know that there even IS<br>> such a thing as other tunings, the rest isn't so hard.<br><br>I agree with this point entirely - although I didn't think it was the<br>point Johnny was making.  I thought he was saying that if<br>microtonality was taught properly, then musicians would be able to<br>play accurately in alternative tuning systems on conventional<br>instruments anyway, and therefore new instruments are unnecessary.<br>Did I misunderstand?<br><br>Patrick Ozzard-Low<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
