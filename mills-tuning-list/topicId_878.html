I was pointing out that a 4:5:6:7 dominant 7th<br>> >chord provides a completely effective authentic cadence, although a <br>9:5 or<br>> >16:9 seventh works better, all in all.<br>><br>> Yes, but the rest of your post argued that smaller stepwise motion produced<br>> a more effective cadence.<br><br>   Yeah, that's why I said "all in all".  I suspect that all factors <br>considered<br>across a variety of musical contexts, the comparative discord of the sharper<br>seventh will produce a stronger desire to resolve.  But I have witnessed <br>cases,<br>especially in choral-like settings, where the inevitability of that small<br>melodic motion more than offset the comparatively self-satisfied feeling of<br>4:5:6:7.<br><br>   However, when in a recent experiment I keep the seventh at 7:4, and raised<br>the 5:4 to 9:7, I found that the resulting chord was a FAR more effective<br>dissonance than either of those two possibilities, both because it is more<br>discordant than the 4:5:6 with a sharper seventh and because it now had two<br>small melodic movements to increase the sense of inevitability.<br><br>   I only experimented with that progression for about 20 minutes or so, with<br>only a handful of timbres and voice-leading possibilities (e.g., direct<br>simultaneous resolution compared to suspending one or the other tone).<br>(Well...<br>I guess retaining the 9:7 into the following chord wouldn't technically <br>be a<br>suspension since it resolves upward instead of downward, but whatever...)<br><br>   I encourage others to explore that chord resolution, by the way.  I found<br>that chord (1:1, 9:7, 3:2, 7:4) to be an positively deliciously<br>horrific-sounding chord for diatonic environments.  It'll get your audience's<br>attention; that's for sure!<br><br><br>From:   Gary Morrison, 71670,2576<br>To:     Tuning List, >INTERNET:tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Date:   10 Sep 1996 , 3:40 PM<br><br>RE:     RE: Re: Babies and tuning<br><br>> Some post just revealed (was it Gary?) that violinist who claim to play<br>> tempered in fact does not do anywhere close to tempered. So how come<br>> so many of you, and others still believe so much that violinist try to<br>> imitate the intonation of the accompanying instruments?<br><br>   If it was me, then I doubt if I said anything like "nowhere close".  <br>Despite<br>the small level of detail we discuss such matters on the tuning list, at the<br>level of practicalities of normal-speed music on indefinite-pitched<br>instruments, JI, 12TET, and meantone (for example) are really quite <br>similar.  They certainly are by all means very clearly distinguishible, <br>especially if held to strictly over entire phrases in the music, but <br>practical inidealities can easily blur those distinctions.<br><br>   Carl Seashore in the Psychology of Music (I think that book contained the<br>study I read - it's been a while) concluded that no simple mathematical <br>formula<br>could adequately predict how a singer or violinist (or a woodwind or brass<br>player for that matter) would choose pitches.  They choose notes based on <br>such<br>factors as:<br>- How the harmony sounds relative to the rest of the instruments playing at<br>  the time.<br>- How the melodic step from the previous note sounds.<br>- How they tuned other recent previous occurances of that same note.<br>- How an instrument-specific mechanism tends to bias the note.<br>- How their fingers feel on the neck (or whatever).<br>- How skilled they are.<br>- How much time they have to correct (if needed) the pitch.<br>- How much vibrato obscures the pitch.<br>- Experiences during practice sessions.<br>Most of these mechanisms can easily produce 10-cent variations from 12TET <br>or JI<br>ideals.  In most cases, the differences between the two tunings just <br>aren't a<br>whole lot bigger than that.<br><br><br>From:   Gary Morrison, 71670,2576<br>To:     Tuning List, >INTERNET:tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Date:   10 Sep 1996 , 3:40 PM<br><br>RE:     List<br><br>   FYI:  I'll be unable to answer E-mail for about the next week or so, <br>so I'm<br>temporarily unsubscribing from the tuning list for that time.  But I'll<br>definitely be back on line after about a week and a half or so.<br><br>   But in the meantime, if you have any messages in response to my inquiries,<br>or that you otherwise suspect that I'd be especially interested in, <br>please do me a favor and copy me (71670.2576@compuserve.com) on the <br>message.  No need to do so after the Monday 23 Sept.  I'll definitely be <br>back on line by then.<br><br>   Thanks y'all!<br><br><br><br>From:   Gary Morrison, 71670,2576<br>To:     Tuning List, >INTERNET:tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Date:   10 Sep 1996 , 3:40 PM<br><br><br>RE:     Survey Partial Results<br><br>   The survey answers are still trickling in, and I certainly encourage those<br>of you who haven't responded to keep 'em comin'.<br><br>   But anyway, among those who have responded, there is a definite bias <br>toward<br>musicianhood away from theoreticianhood.  A skeptic might criticize that <br>"bias"<br>is an especially appropriate word.  That in the sense that what spurred this<br>was Brian M's lament that he perceives that only a very few list <br>subscribers are musicians.  Since most of us probably viewed that lament <br>to have a mildly<br>disgusted tone, it's not impossible that musicians may have perceived <br>there to<br>be a greater need to refute that claim by responding more avidly than<br>theoreticians.  But I certainly don't know that for sure.<br><br>   I purposely phrased the survey questions with as much leeway for<br>interpretation as I could, to try to cut down on the pigeon-holing <br>effect.  I<br>suppose it's still worth noting that three of the 24 respondents (so far) <br>found<br>even that too restrictive.  Regarding the first question, one joked that <br>it was<br>kind of like asking whether you prefer eating or sleeping!<br><br>   I certainly understand and sympathize with that concern, but it's pretty<br>difficult to gather statistics on 20-word descriptions, each of which<br>approaches the topic differently.  You pretty much need concrete answers, <br>and to do that respondents have to quantize themselves one way or the <br>other.  And also, in interpreting the results, we you have to understand <br>that few respondents considered themselves purely one way or the other.<br><br>   But if anything, I'd say that the questions were too vague.  As you may<br>recall, I had to send out a qualifier to question #1 (about what "musician"<br>involves).  But I think it's worth noting one ... I think important ... point<br>of vagueness that, were I to start the survey over, I would want to <br>correct.  That is, in questions 2 and 3, how to interpret the phrase <br>"played live".<br><br>   I intended that to mean "for an audience".  I would then want to <br>narrow that<br>down even further to something like "for a paying audience", or "for an<br>audience of more than 5 people", or "for an audience at least two members <br>of which you'd never met before".  But I figured that every word I added <br>to the question after about 20 or so, would mean one less respondent not <br>wanting to wade through the legalistic verbage, so I did what I could to <br>keep the questions short.<br><br>   Similarly, I should definitely have put some sort of time limit on the <br>sorts<br>of activities that would qualify.  In the extreme case of both of these<br>concerns, one could respond something like this: "Well, let's see, when I <br>was 6<br>years old, I played Chopsticks, Mary Had a Little Lamb, and Old McDonald <br>in a<br>piano recital for my mother, and lord knows, even though I haven't played the<br>piano for 38 since then, I probably practiced for more than 15 minutes <br>for that<br>recital, so yeah, I've performed more than 15 minutes of live music!"  I<br>seriously doubt if an of the respondents actually answered "yes" in that sort<br>of context, but suffice it to say that the image I had in my mind was <br>something<br>more like the Reinhard/Haverstick/Catler sort of experience!<br><br>   But anyway, here are the results so far, and if you haven't responded, <br>then<br>please do:<br><br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Partial Survey Results:<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>1.  Do you consider yourself more of a theoretician or more of a musician?<br>    (I'll let each of you decide how to define those terms, except to say<br>    I'm refering to the sort of theory that involves such constructs as <br>digits<br>    to the right of the decimal point, and logarithms.  Musician should <br>involve<br>    some form of composition, performance, or improvisation.)<br><br>    Theoretician:  4<br><br>    Musician:      18<br><br>2.  Is the total play-time of music - in any tuning - that you've recorded,<br>    played live, or scored on paper, greater than 15 minutes?  Again, I'll<br>    let you use your own judgement for what to count as "music", except to<br>    stipulate that it be intended for artistic expression.  Freshman harmony<br>    exercises, for example, don't count.<br><br>    Yes:  21<br><br>    No:   3<br><br>3.  Is the total play-time of such music, specifically in unusual tunings,<br>    greater than 15 minutes?<br><br>    Yes:  16<br><br>    No:   8<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br>   I'll send out an update in a week or so.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 12 Sep 1996 22:58 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29221; Thu, 12 Sep 1996 23:00:18 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29274<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id OAA01737; Thu, 12 Sep 1996 14:00:10 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 12 Sep 1996 14:00:10 -0700<br>Message-Id: <009A8485E5102B80.0566@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
