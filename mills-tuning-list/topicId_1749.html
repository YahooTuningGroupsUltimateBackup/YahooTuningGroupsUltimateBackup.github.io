Let me ramble a bit first.<br><br>In 1977 I was using computers to make economic forecasts.  I found that<br>there were a number of reasonably regular cycles present in many of the<br>economic variables that I studied.  To refine the cycles observed I<br>wrote some programs to specifically search for cycles in the data.  The<br>result was a graph which showed how strongly a cycle was present in a<br>collection of 22 economic variables as a function of the period.  The<br>result was that periods of 4.45, 5.9, 7.15 and about 9 years were found.<br>Each cycle had effects on different variables in the economy.  These<br>cycles were used in the following years to make generally accurate<br>forecasts.<br><br>A little later I noticed that the four periods found were related in<br>that they were all very nearly exact fractions of 35.6 years.  If 35.6<br>years is divided by 8, 6, 5 and 4 the results are 4.45, 5.93, 7.12 and<br>8.9 years.<br><br>What was so special about 35.6 years?  I did not know the answer to that<br>question.  However I found that the long cycle had been discovered<br>before and was called the Kondratieff cycle after its Russian <br>discoverer.  Kondratieff said that it was 54 years long and in the<br>1920's predicted a major depression in the 1930's.  Of course he was<br>absolutely right, and we have just completed the next depression after<br>that one, although thankfully it was not as bad as the 1930's one.  I<br>also noticed that 108 years divided by 2 and 3 gave 54 and 36 years<br>respectively and so it seemed that 35.6 years was connected with the<br>Kondratieff cycle and was not some sort of special value.<br><br>As people interested in tuning you will no doubt immediately have<br>noticed something about these relationships.  They are all musical.  The<br>original 4 periods if converted to frequencies are in the proportions<br>4:5:6:8 and so are a major chord.  The relationship of 35.6 to ~54 years<br>is a major 5th.<br><br>Next I found that in weekly corn prices over a 44 year period there were<br>an even more complicated pattern of cycle periods and that these turned<br>out to exactly correspond to the frequencies of all the white notes in a<br>just intonation scale, plus a couple of flats.  These periods measured<br>in weeks were also in tune with the longer yearly cycles.<br><br>So to summarise, the New Zealand economy was playing a major chord on<br>its 22 "instruments" and in the case of corn prices it was as if someone<br>had sat on the corn keyboard!<br><br>I then found that there was a place called "The Foundation for the Study<br>of Cycles" and went there in the late 1980s.  To my surprise almost all<br>my discoveries had been made before by Edward Dewey and others.  He had<br>found from entirely different data to mine that commonly reported cycles<br>tended to be related to 17.75 years by proportions of 2 and 3.  So he<br>listed 35.5 years and 8.88, 5.92 and 4.44 years, all quite similar to my<br>figures.  This confirmed that my (re-)discoveries were correct and that<br>everything on earth and even in space was subject to the same rhythms.<br><br>Many astronomical periods also fit the pattern, e.g Jupiter's orbital<br>period is 11.86 years or ~35.6/3 and the moon's orbit varies over a<br>period of 8.85 years or ~35.6/4 years.<br><br>Eventually I formed a theory that explained these strange events and<br>made lots of predictions about the universe at large.  Anyway, the<br>universe has its own "tuning systems" and I will argue that it probably<br>knows best and that we are just immitating it or perhaps even "tuning<br>in" as some great composers have claimed.  Everything that I have<br>discovered indicates the latter.<br><br>More later.<br><br>-- Ray Tomes -- rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz -- Harmonics Theory --<br>http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 28 Feb 1997 14:11 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29471; Fri, 28 Feb 1997 14:11:03 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00246<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id FAA27572; Fri, 28 Feb 1997 05:07:42 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 28 Feb 1997 05:07:42 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.970228071015.2092A-100000@library><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
