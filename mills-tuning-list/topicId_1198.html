I think <br>Brian is referring to Hans Luedtke's two patents for keyboards with<br>hexagonal digitals, #2,061,364 of Nov. 17, 193 and # 2,003,894 <br>of June 4, 1935.<br><br>I am unaware of the Paris keyboard.<br><br>RE the diatonic scale: I think our emphasis is a bit misplaced. <br>As I understand European musical history,  Pythagorean tuning<br>and the rather artificial system of modes began to break down<br>during the Middle Ages as Musica Ficta tended to erase the <br>modal differences and the intonation softened towards just thirds<br>and sixths, at least in English music, according to Walter of<br>Odington. <br><br>This tweaking went on for several centuries and eventually in <br>the 18th century Rameau analysed the diatonic scale in terms of triads <br>and theory caught up with practice. However Barbour showed that tuners <br>in the 15th and 16th centuries, when  Pythagorean tuning was being <br>replaced by meantone, 12-TET and various irregular systems, devised <br>complete chromatic octaves (12 notes) not merely the seven diatonic <br>tones. Thus the diatonic scale was never viewed wholly in isolation <br>from its modes and transpositions. <br><br>No doubt by this time the diatonic scales were considered to be <br>constructed of triads as all the chromatic tones were harmonized<br>by triads, but most probably musicians thought in terms of five or <br>six chords, not just three primary ones, though a specialist on early <br>music could advise me here. I think it was Rameau's insight that the scale<br>could be construed as the union of just three primary triads rather<br>than 5 (including the conjugate ones on degrees 3 and 6) that led<br>to the myth that it was deliberately constructed with this<br>in mind. (I'm ignoring the supertonic triad deliberately.)<br><br>It seems to me to be a coincidence that Ptolemy's Intense Diatonic <br>in the Greek Lydian mode provides 4:5:6 triads on 1/1, 4/3 and 3/2.<br>There is little evidence that the Greeks were aware of this fact<br>and there were other diatonic tunings in favor without this property.<br>The tuning does NOT have a mode with 3 minor (10:12:15) triads on <br>these roots, however and neither does any other Greek tuning. It seems<br>therefore, that the major-minor system presupposes some sort of tuning<br>with acceptable thirds that ignores the syntonic comma. Meantone, ET<br>and various irregular systems do just this. <br><br>(Redfield's just scale does have this property as it consists of three<br>minor triads on 1/1, 4/3 and 3/2. Every mode of this scale contains a<br>note differing by a comma from a Ptolemaic mode. The generating tetrachord<br>is 10/9 x 9/8 x16/15 rather than the Greek 16/15 x 9/8 x 10/9. ) <br><br>I must say that I think Rameau's insight is very  valuable for <br>contemporary <br>scale builders. I generated a number of analogous scales using various<br>kinds of triads and mixtures in the 60's, but did very little with them <br>save play a few on Partch's chromelodeon until I spoke with Max Mathews <br>and saw David Lewin's article on Generalize Tonal Functions. As most<br>scale builders soon find out, it is no easy task to find a harmonically<br>generated scale with the melodic strength and logic of the diatonic<br>scale.<br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 20 Nov 1996 11:06 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18711; Wed, 20 Nov 1996 11:07:54 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA15279<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id CAA04116; Wed, 20 Nov 1996 02:07:50 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 02:07:50 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199611200504_MC1-C1D-A9BF@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
