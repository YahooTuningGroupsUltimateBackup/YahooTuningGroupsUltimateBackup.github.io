After giving it another look and listen, I think I owe Johnny an<br>apology.  It looks like he gave it more care and attention than I gave him<br>credit for.  The DX7 attack sounds nothing like a chromelodeon's but I<br>can't lay my dislike of the piece at that door.  If it's a case of<br>misrepresentation at all it looks like it's Harry misrepresenting his own<br>better efforts, if that makes any sense at all.  Sorry I went off<br>half-cocked.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 27 Aug 1996 18:27 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00844; Tue, 27 Aug 1996 18:28:34 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00968<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA12518; Tue, 27 Aug 1996 09:28:32 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 27 Aug 1996 09:28:32 -0700<br>Message-Id: <1.5.4b12.32.19950827161935.006841d0@interlinx.qc.ca><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
