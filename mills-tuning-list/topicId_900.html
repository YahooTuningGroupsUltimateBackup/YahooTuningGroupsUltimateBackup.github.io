Specifically, can one still use it<br>as a tuning editor cum scale archive?<br><br>Re Consistency: I may have missed part of this discussion, but I don't<br>quite grasph how fractional consistency can be defined on a closed,<br>cyclic, and equally-tempered tuning system. Or am I just humor-impaired<br>this AM (in general, perhaps,  as I'm sweltering in the Texas heat and<br>humidity preparing to become homeless <g> if and when my house sale<br>closes next week).<br><br>Although this may have been discussed previously, it seems to me that<br>higher-level consistency, fractional accuracy, and similar concerns<br>are most important. Because of the perceptual effects described in<br>George Miller's classic paper, "The Magical Number Seven Plus or Minus<br>Two...,"  one probably is going to have difficulties projecting complex<br>multidimensional, multi-toned static scales per se. Rather I think one <br>would partition such constructs into sub-scales, motifs, chordal sets, etc.<br>It is in modulating such objects and writing long chordal progressions that<br>higher order consistency becomes important. Fractional errors rather than <br>just absolute errors accumulate under such conditions and one may not <br>arrive <br>on the note(s) desired. Hence higher-order consistency and similar <br>properties <br>become very important descriptors in musically dynamic contexts and are<br>not just intellectual excercises.<br><br>Back in the late 60's when Erv Wilson and I did our study of ET's,<br>Erv had me generate a table of what we called "System Interval Equivalents,"<br>for each ET and a set of common intervals from the harmonic series. SIE's<br>were tables of the best JI approximation, the errors in cents and in <br>fractions of scale degrees. From this one could compute consistency, <br>articulation (which intervals had unique images and which were confused<br>or fused), etc. <br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 19 Sep 1996 18:30 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA19734; Thu, 19 Sep 1996 18:32:10 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA21013<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA00263; Thu, 19 Sep 1996 09:32:07 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 19 Sep 1996 09:32:07 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.960919111651.19166A-100000@library><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4204 href="#4204">ðŸ”—</a>William Sethares &#x3C;sethares@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/1996 11:05:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>While Brian McLaren is going on about yakademics,<br>just remember that in tuning digest #256, (Fri Dec 16, 1994)<br>Brian wrote:<br><br>In fact there are an amazing number of exceptionally<br>capable composers and theorists in academia.
