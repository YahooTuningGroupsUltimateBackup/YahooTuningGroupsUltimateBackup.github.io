That's partially<br>>because the existing musical terminology makes sense in 19et. Which<br><br> ..........................<br><br>Dear Paul Erlich :<br><br> I think you have used guitars fretted in different tunings, and I see you<br>have a great experience.<br><br> For twenty years I worked very hard with my Dinarra (read Deenarha). That's<br>a fretted 53 -1/9 skhisma-guitar. Ten acoustic and two electric ones have<br>been made until now. I have not use any other micro-guitar.<br><br> I am surprised because it seems that all around the world both Didier<br>Ashour and myself are the only persons in the list that promote the 53<br>guitar. I don't know if the Didier's instrument is fretted or slide.<br> Siemen Terpstra (Holand) (he is not yet in the list) has reported to me his<br>53 slide guitar.<br><br> Some days ago, somebody in the list said that in the 31 guitar the spaces<br>between the frets in the zone near the bridge were very closed but in<br>practice it functions. And I say, in the Dinarra the frets are much closed<br>and functions well.<br><br> A nephew of mine Johannes Stenger (15) study Dinarra from 11 and plays both<br>Jazz and European Classics very well. He has a gift.<br><br> And I ask : What are the reasons why 53 is not used as it should ?<br><br> I understand that 53 is the best theoretical proposition for 3 and 5 (90<br>per cent of the possibilities, just for 5/3-6/5 and tempered 1/9 ninth of a<br>Skhisma (about 0.2 cent) for 10/9-9/5 and 5/4-8/5). For the other harmonics<br>the tempering is not bigger than half a comma.<br> The sound of the acoustic Dinarra is very warm and much better than the<br>sound of the original guitar.<br><br>Eduardo<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>      Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi            e-mail : esabat@adinet.com.uy<br>Home: Simon Bolivar 1260       Office FAX-Phone : 598 2 900353<br>      11300 Montevideo               Home Phone : 598 2 780952<br>      Uruguay</div>
