Dunn)</h3><span>1/8/1996 5:48:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Hi,<br>	I have been developing a shareware program called Microtonal MIDI <br>Performance Instrument for Atari computers (I should be porting it to <br>the Mac soon). As part of the hypertext documentation I would like to <br>include some files from this archive's FTP site, namely mclaren's <br>microtonal bibliography and discography. Is this OK?<br><br>		WARNING- blatant plug follows<br><br>	Some of the features of MMPI are:<br>* designed for real-time performance<br>* full graphical interface<br>* can use either polyphonic aftertouch or pitch bend as the means of <br>pitch shifting<br>* when using pitch bend, a dynamic channel allocation algorithm is <br>used i.e. polyphony is not limited to monophonic lines but the number <br>of MIDI channels you give it<br>* uses tuning 'presets' that may be switched between using program <br>change messages<br>* can have two different tuning systems being used simultaneously<br>* 1-step generation of any ET scale (of course not limited to octaves)<br>* all files are standard ascii text (full description of file formats <br>is provided)<br>* tuning systems may be loaded as ratios, cents or frequencies, and <br>are extrapolated to either a) 128 notes, or b) the entire MIDI <br>frequency range).<br>* a C library is provided for microtonal algorithmic composition with <br>full access to the 'preset' data structure so it can be modified in <br>real-time<br>* ... :-)<br>	The shareware fee will be Australian $35 + postage with the <br>hypertext manual. <br><br>	A Aussie dollar is about 75 US cents or 47 UK pence.<br><br>	There is an old an buggy demo available at <br>ftp://micros.hensa.ac.uk/micros/atari/tos/q/q152/<br>	This is going to be updated soon (after I've finished the <br>hypertext + a few more changes).<br>	If you feel like digging out that old ST be warned that MMPI <br>requires a hi-res monitor.<br>	There are currently atari emulators that re-direct the ST's<br>internal MIDI port for both the Mac (MagiC Mac) and PC (Gemulator).<br>Both can be bought from Toad Computers http://www.toad.net<br>	MMPI _should_ work with both of these but it has not been tested.<br>	There is a demo version of MagiCMac that doesn't re-direct <br>MIDI at ftp://micros.hensa.ac.uk/micros/atari/tos/p/p144/<br>	There is also a freeware atari emulator for X-Windows <br>(including Linux) called STonX. This should be available from <br>ftp://micros.hensa.ac.uk/micros/atari/ (somewhere). I don't know it it <br>re-directs the ST's MIDI port though...<br><br>	If you would like to speed up the port donations of power Macs <br>or Pentium PCs are welcome :-)<br><br>	Please send suggestions/comments/info about compatability with <br>emulators to:<br>	<br>	Lorien Dunn<br>	ladins@ibm.net (email address only valid until 23rd February <br>1996)<br><br>	<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 9 Jan 1996 11:49 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id CAA24553; Tue, 9 Jan 1996 02:49:28 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 9 Jan 1996 02:49:28 -0800<br>Message-Id: <0099C210C8BD0D42.6A9E@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
