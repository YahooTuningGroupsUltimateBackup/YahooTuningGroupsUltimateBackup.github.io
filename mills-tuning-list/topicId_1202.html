If so, could you<br>please reply with your paper-mail address.  I'm preparing to send out a new XH<br>Alliance Directory by sending out a "send me your address corrections" postcard,<br>and yours bounced back due to an address change.  I was about to delete your<br>entry from the database.  (I'm not blaming you of course, Doug;  I'm way behind<br>on this.)<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 20 Nov 1996 16:05 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00719; Wed, 20 Nov 1996 16:07:14 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00717<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id HAA05185; Wed, 20 Nov 1996 07:07:11 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 07:07:11 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961120150035_71670.2576_HHB62-11@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
