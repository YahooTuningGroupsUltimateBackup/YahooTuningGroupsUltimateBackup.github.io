Suggested ratios are 100/63, 27/17 and 19/12. Barbour <br>also states that Johann  Faulhaber (1630) was the first <br>person to use  logs to calculate the 12th roots of 2. The first to <br>publish ET in Europe was Simon Stevin (1586).<br> <br>Barbour, J. Murray.  1951.

Sorry I don't have a better reference to this book.<br> <br>I may be wrong, but I had thought that the historical Mongolian scale <br>was diatonic and Chinese pentatonic with the pien-tones added later. BTW, Contemporary Mongolian music sounds like C&W (I'm not kidding, a troop <br>visited Berkeley in the late 1980's) and played a mixture of musics, <br>some diatonic, some pentatonic. The vocal style was largely male falsetto <br>with heavy tremolo rather than vibrato. <br> <br>--John<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 19 Oct 1995 10:28 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id BAA20769; Thu, 19 Oct 1995 01:27:53 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 19 Oct 1995 01:27:53 -0700<br>Message-Id: <951018222829_127336397@emout04.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
