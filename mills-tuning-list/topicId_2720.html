I must say that with regard to tuning, the book<br>was a great disappointment.  Only 6 pages, p. 17-22, were devoted to<br>this topict--the amount of material was scant, and the analysis,<br>anemic.<br><br>Just a quick glance at the few intervals presented found errors:<br><br>p. 19:   54/49 should be 50/49<br>p. 21:  19/9 should be 16/9<br>p. 21  253/243 should be 256/243<br>p. 21   32/22 should be 32/27<br><br>No explanation is given at the derivation of intervals such as<br>162/149 (p. 19) or how and why the ratios as 18/17 and 50/49 are<br>deployed.<br><br>One cannot even speak of a worthwhile historical analysis here at<br>all.  Conjecture compounds speculation.<br><br>I have yet to find a good treatment of Arabic tunings in English.  It<br>appears as though I may have to attempt wading through the<br>French six volume work of d'Erlanger, _La musique arabe_.  Which,<br>given that I have not studied French, leaves me divining from the<br>mathematics (which is d'Erlanger usually involves complex fractions,<br>i.e., 1+1/8 instead of 9/8) and reasoning out French words from Latin<br>roots.<br><br>If anyone knows of a decent treatment of this subject in English, in<br>particular with regard to Zalzal, Al-Farabi, and Safi ad-Din, it<br>would be most appreciated.<br><br>Regards all,<br><br>Polychroni Moniodis  <br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Polychroni Moniodis <UPB_MONIODIS@ONLINE.EMICH.EDU><br>Subject:  Re: Arabic Tunings<br>PostedDate:  05-12-97 19:10:49<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  05-12-97 19:09:08-05-12-97 19:09:09,05-12-97 19:08:59-05-12-97 19:08:59<br>DeliveredDate:  05-12-97 19:08:59<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256564.0063B1B0; Fri, 5 Dec 1997 19:08:55 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07309; Fri, 5 Dec 1997 19:10:49 +0100<br>Date: Fri, 5 Dec 1997 19:10:49 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07302<br>Received: (qmail 21477 invoked from network); 5 Dec 1997 10:10:45 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 5 Dec 1997 10:10:45 -0800<br>Message-Id: <01IQTDY0DJFC90SKZ1@ONLINE.EMICH.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
