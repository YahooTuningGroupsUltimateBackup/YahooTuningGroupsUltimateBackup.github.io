Must be because God so loves neutral thirds. And presumably, <br>for minor sixths, the lower note would decrease in pitch much more than the <br>upper note. So what would happen to an inverted augmented triad? Can God <br>create a stone so heavy that he cannot lift it? I think I'll go on counting <br>the angels on the head of a pin, thank you very much.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 21 Nov 1996 22:05 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02892; Thu, 21 Nov 1996 22:06:44 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02887<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA02635; Thu, 21 Nov 1996 13:06:42 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 21 Nov 1996 13:06:42 -0800<br>Message-Id: <90961121210309/0005695065PK4EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
