Ames&#x22; &#x3C;bmames@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/1997 11:42:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>There is in semiconductor theory a conceptual particle called a "hole" which<br>represents the absence of an electron in the lattice of the substrate.  It<br>has the same properties as an electron except opposite charge and direction.<br>Likewise, a particle called a "phonon" can be conceived.  It would have<br>properties derived from the medium in which the sound traveled; in air it<br>would essentially be a nitrogen molecule. Since the collisions between<br>molecules are not perfectly elastic, phonons would "tire out" and stop<br>moving as their energy dissipated.  They would not obey quantum laws which<br>in any event become insignificant in the large collections of particles<br>which is the domain of sound.<br><br>Just as semiconductor holes cannot travel beyond the boundary (juncture) of<br>the substrate, phonons would not be able to travel between media.  They<br>would instead transfer their energy to phonons in the other media at the<br>juncture. And, of course, phonons would not be able to cross empty space as<br>photons do.<br><br>Do phonons exist?  Yes, to the extent the concept is useful.<br><br>Is it a useful concept? This is uncertain.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Subject:  New Year<br>PostedDate:  01-01-98 18:19:25<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  01-01-98 18:17:05-01-01-98 18:17:06,01-01-98 18:16:27-01-01-98 18:16:27<br>DeliveredDate:  01-01-98 18:16:27<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125657F.005EEED6; Thu, 1 Jan 1998 18:18:51 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29168; Thu, 1 Jan 1998 18:19:25 +0100<br>Date: Thu, 1 Jan 1998 18:19:25 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA28955<br>Received: (qmail 23148 invoked from network); 1 Jan 1998 09:19:22 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 1 Jan 1998 09:19:22 -0800<br>Message-Id: <34ABD8BC.612A@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6897 href="#6897">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/1/1998 9:57:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Thu, 1 Jan 1998, Aline Surman wrote:<br>> ... the real New Year begins on the Equinox, which is 11 days earlier.<br><br>Just a small nit: I think you mean the Winter Solstice.
