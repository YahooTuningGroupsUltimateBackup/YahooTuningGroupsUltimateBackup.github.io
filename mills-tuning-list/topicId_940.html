This observation alone is not very useful, as there are <br>virtual pitches at _all_<br>	    the notes of the chord. The root is different in that the spectral <br>pitches in its harmonic<br>	    pitch pattern arise from more than one complex tone (note). In other <br>words, the root is<br>	    the implied fundamental of a group of pure tone components belonging to <br>different<br>	    complex tones.<br><br>For two notes in a harmonic relationship, whose frequency ratio in lowest <br>terms is given by p/q, with<br><br>	    p>=q		    	    	    	    	    	    	    	    	    (0)<br><br>the "fundamental frequency" is given by<br><br>	    f0=f(p)/p=f(q)/q	   	    	    	    	    	    	    	    (1)<br><br>Now according to any of the theories of complex pitch perception <br>(Goldstein[15], Terhardt[16], Wightmann[17], the relationship becomes <br>difficult to perceive for f0 very low (or, what will amount to the same <br>thing, for p and q very large); let us tentatively require<br><br>	    f0>=F	    	    	    	    	    	    	    	    	    	    (2)<br><br>F being the lower bound for any f0. We now find<br><br>	    F<=f(p)/p and F<=f(q)/q	 	    	    	    	    	    	    	    (3)<br><br>or<br><br>	    p<=f(p)/F and q<= f(q)/F		    	    	    	    	    	    (4)<br><br>If we are comparing intervals by fixing f(p) and varying f(q)[18], the <br>fractions will satisfy<br><br>	    p,q<=N	   	    	    	    	    	    	    	    	    	    (5)<br><br>where<br><br>	    N=f(p)/F	 	    	    	    	    	    	    	    	    (6)<br><br>Now we will assume that N is large compared with the p and q of fractions we <br>are actually trying to represent in our tuning. This is reasonable (I am <br>able to tune just intervals such as 17:13 by ear, though it could hardly be <br>considered a consonant interval); the question is to what extent these more <br>complex ratios disturb the representation of simpler ones. In fact, we will <br>let N approach infinity (by letting F go to zero), causing the particular <br>frequency at which f(p) is fixed to cease to have any bearing on the result, <br>so that we can judge intervals solely by their size and not by the register <br>in which they are played.<br>	    Given any N, the set of fractions satisfying (5) and (0), arranged in <br>ascending order, is called the Farey series of order N. For example, the <br>Farey series of order is<br><br>	    1/1,6/5,5/4,4/3,3/2,5/3,2/1,5/2,3/1,4/1,5/1,6/1	  	    	    	    	    (  <br>7)<br><br>This series has the property that any two consecutive fractions p(i)/q(i) <br>and p(j)/q(j) (j=i+1) satisfy[19]<br><br>	    p(j)q(i)-p(i)q(j)=1		    	    	    	    	    	    	    (8)<br><br>If the next fraction after p(j)/q(j) is denoted by p(k)/q(k) (k=j+1) we find<br><br>	    1=p(j)q(i)-p(i)q(j)=p(k)q(j)-p(j)q(k)<br><br>	    p(j)q(i)+p(j)q(k)=p(k)q(j)+p(i)q(j)<br><br>Say the interval one is trying to represent is p(j)/q(j); then p(j) is small <br>compared with N. Then<br><br>	    p(k)~p(i)~N	   	    	    	    	    	    	    	    	    (9)<br><br>because:<br>(a) membership in the Farey series requires that they be <= N; and<br>(b) All three fractions being similar in magnitude implies that (9) also <br>implies<br><br>	    q(k)~q(i)~Nq(j)/p(j)	    	    	    	    	    	    	    	    (9c)<br><br>therefore if p(j) were <= N-p(j), the fraction (p(i)+p(j))/(q(i)+q(j)), <br>which lies between p(i)/q(i) and p(j)/q(j), would also belong to the Farey <br>series of order N, contradicting the assumption that p(i)/q(i) and p(j)/q(j) <br>are consecutive. By (8) we know that<br><br>	    cp(j)=p(k)+p(i), cq(j)=q(i)+q(k)	  	    	    	    	    	    (10)<br><br>for some c, so<br><br>	    p(k)=cp(j)-p(i),q(i)=cq(j)-q(k)	   	    	    	    	    	    	    (11)<br><br>whence<br><br>	    q(k)=cq(j)-q(i)	    	    	    	    	    	    	    	    	    (12)<br><br>>From (11),<br><br>	    p(k)q(i) = <br>(c^2)p(j)q(j)-cp(i)q(j)-cp(j)q(k)+p(i)q(k)	  	    	    	    (13)<br><br>and using (12),<br><br>	    p(k)q(i)-p(i)q(k)=(c^2)p(j)q(j)-cp(i)q(j)-cp(j)(cq(j)-q(i))<br><br>	    p(k)q(i)-p(i)q(k)=-cp(i)q(j)+cp(j)q(i)<br><br>	    p(k)q(i)-p(i)q(k)=c		    	    	    	    	    	    	    (14)<br><br>by virtue of (7). Now (9) and (10) tell us that<br><br>	    c~2N/p(j)<br><br>so<br><br>	    p(k)q(i)-p(i)q(k)~2N/p(j)	    	    	    	    	    	    	    (15)<br><br>While N is still finite, there is a range of intervals f(1)/f(2) which could <br>be interpreted as p(j)/q(j). A natural set of bounds for this range is[20]<br><br>	    a(j)=(p(i)+p(j))/(q(i)+q(j))<f(1)/f(2)<(p(j)+p(k))/(q(j)+q(k))=b(j)	  	     <br>	    (16)<br><br>which unambiguously ascribes to any f(1)/f(2) one and only one fraction from <br>th e Farey series, namely p(j)/q(j). Now the width of this range on a <br>logarithmic scale, such as a scale of cents, is given by<br><br>	    W(j)=log(((p(i)+p(j))/(q(i)+q(j)))/((p(j)+p(k))/(q(j)+q(k))))=log(a(j)/  <br>b(j))	    (17)<br><br>Since in our case p(j),q(j) are relatively small,<br><br>	    W(j)=log(p(k)q(i)/p(i)q(k))<br><br>and since the range is small,<br><br>	    W(j)=p(k)q(i)/p(i)q(k)-1<br><br>or<br><br>	    W(j)=(p(k)q(i)-p(i)q(k))/p(i)q(k)<br><br>Substituting (15), (9), and (9c),<br><br>	    W(j)=(2N/p(j))/((N^2)q(j)/p(j))<br><br>or<br><br>	    W(j)=2/Nq(j)	  	    	    	    	    	    	    	    	    (18)<br><br>	    Now, if we want to take octave equivalence into account, we would like <br>all inversions and octave expansions of an interval to be equal in tonicity <br>to the individual interval. Denote the lowest-terms reduction of <br>(2^n)p(j)/q(j) by p(j,n)/q(j,n). L(j), the "limit" of p(j)/q(j), is the <br>greater of the largest odd factor of p(j) and the largest odd factor of <br>q(j). Obviously, L(j)=L(j,n). Since q(j,n) is often equal to, but never <br>greater than L(j),<br><br>	    W(L(j))=W(j,n)=2/NL(j)<=W(j)	 	    	    	    	    	    	    (19)<br><br>is a lower bound on the "width" of all ratios of the L(j) limit. Harry <br>Partch, using the word "identity" with the same meaning as our "limit," <br>states essentially the same thing in his "Observation One": what he calls <br>the "field of attraction"[21] is proportional to our W(L(j)) (or equal with <br>N~2.9).<br><br>To be continued next <br>week...................................................................<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 28 Sep 1996 07:30 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02397; Sat, 28 Sep 1996 07:30:30 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02843<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id WAA16751; Fri, 27 Sep 1996 22:30:28 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 27 Sep 1996 22:30:28 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199609280529.XAA25540@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
