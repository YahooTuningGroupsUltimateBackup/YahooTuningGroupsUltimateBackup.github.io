Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/1998 1:52:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>This is moderately lomg, but I believe it to be well worth reading if<br>you have any interest in alternative keyboard tunings.<br><br>>}There is good<br>>}solid controversy on the Pianotech list right now, concerning ET vs WT vs<br>>MT,<br>>}(nobody championing Pythagorean or Just, at the moment).<br>><br>>There are two other types of tuning for a 12-note keyboard that one should be<br>>aware of. I'm not sure what the contreversy or "championing" entails; if<br>>we're talking about music for which MT is even an option, that's a limited<br>>portion of the piano repertoire anyway. So I'm assuming this argument is more<br>>along the lines of interesting or favorite tunings.<br>><br>><br>>The first tuning I want to talk about was used on keyboard instruments in the<br>>late medieval period. Known as schismatic tuning, this was really nothing<br>>more than Pythagorean tuning, but instead of tuning 11 pure fifths from, say,<br>>Eb to G#, one would tune 11 pure fifths from, say, A to Cx (C double-sharp).<br>>Then, when one thinks one is playing in C major, one is actually starting on<br>>B#, and the following scale results:<br>><br>>0	204	384	498	702	882	1086	1200	(cents)<br>><br>>Compare this with one version of the major scale in just intonation:<br>><br>>1/1	9/8	5/4	4/3	3/2	5/3	15/8	2/1<br>>0	204	386	498	702	884	1088	1200<br>><br>>Clearly the correspondence is close. The scales that look like G major and F<br>>major resemble other versions of the just major scale. Late medieval<br>>composers wanted to take advantage of the consonant thirds and sixths that<br>>characterized the new art, but did not want to stray too far from Pythagorean<br>>principles. Clearly this was one way, though one which did not offer the full<br>>triadic possibilities, even in one key, that later tunings such as meantone<br>>and ET provided.<br>><br>><br>>The second tuning I want to talk about is, as far as I know, and invention of<br>>mine. As you may have guessed, it is a subset of 22-tone equal temperament.<br>>Rather that approach the subject as I do in my paper, I will introduce<br>>7-limit harmony in another way.<br>><br>>In MT, the two German augmented sixth chords (usually Bb D F G# and Eb G Bb<br>>C#) have a particularly concordant quality, resembling the seventh chords<br>>sometimes encountered in barbershop singing. The two incomplete French<br>>augmented sixth chords (Bb E G# and Eb A C#) also have a unique resonance.<br>>Huygens, in advocating meantone tempermant, pointed out (back in the 17th<br>>century, I believe) that these latter chords are used in compositions and in<br>>meantone are tuned very nearly 1/7:1/5:1/4. This may have been the first<br>>attempt to use the number 7 in explaining musical practice. The former chords<br>>are tuned very nearly 4:5:6:7. These are what Partch would call 7-limit<br>>otonal tetrads, while the latter chords are subsets of 7-limit utonal<br>>tetrads. The complete 7-limit utonal tetrads, in what I consider to be "root<br>>postion" (because of the perfect fifths) are C# E G# Bb and F# A C# Eb. In<br>>MT, the chords in question are tuned<br>><br>>0	386	697	965	(otonal)<br>><br>>0	310	697	931	(utonal)<br>><br>>Compare with just intonation:<br>><br>>1/1	5/4	3/2	7/4	(otonal)<br>>0	386	702	969<br>><br>>1/1	6/5	3/2	12/7	(utonal)<br>>0	316	702	933<br>><br>>Clearly the correspondence is quite close. However, with only two of each<br>>kind of tetrad available, there is not much 7-limit music one can make with<br>>MT on a piano keyboard.<br>><br>>One of the main findings of my paper is that 22-tone equal temperament is a<br>>good way to make small sets of pitches contain large numbers of tolerable<br>>7-limit tetrads. One example can be tuned on a piano as follows: The<br>>intervals E-F and B-C are both tuned to 1/22 octave; the others are tuned to<br>>2/22 octave. Now, using the traditional keyboard notation, the list of otonal<br>>tetrads is<br>><br>>Ab C Eb F#<br>>Eb G Bb C#<br>>D F# A C<br>>A C# E G<br>>E G# B D<br>><br>>and the list of utonal tetrads is<br>><br>>C# E G# Bb<br>>G# B C# Eb<br>>F Ab C D<br>>C Eb G A<br>>G Bb D E<br>><br>>Notice that if the "third" of the chord is a white key, the others are black,<br>>and vice versa. This makes it very easy to find these chords when playing<br>>around with this tuning.<br>><br>>How close is the correspondence to just intonation? These chords are tuned:<br>><br>>0	382	709	982	(otonal)<br>><br>>0	327	709	927	(utonal)<br>><br>>Compare with just intonation again:<br>><br>>1/1	5/4	3/2	7/4	(otonal)<br>>0	386	702	969<br>><br>>1/1	6/5	3/2	12/7	(utonal)<br>>0	316	702	933<br>><br>>Though not as good as meantone, clearly the approximation to just intonation<br>>is still good, and the payoff is a 2.5-fold increase in the number of tetrads<br>>to play with.<br>><br>>The integrity of the diatonic scale is destroyed by this tuning, but my paper<br>>suggests other scales that could take its place. These scales have 10 notes<br>>instead of 7, so with only 12 notes on the keyboard, only a few modulations<br>>will be possible before one needs more keys.<br>><br>>Incidentally, there is one historical tuning with 10 semitones of one size<br>>and 2 (E-F and B-C) of another. This is the tuning of Grammateus, where the<br>>white keys are in meantone, and the black keys divide the whole tones exactly<br>>in half.<br>><br>>I would love to hear people's impressions (or better yet, music) of these<br>>piano tunings.</div><h3><a id=7311 href="#7311">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>3/28/1998 2:09:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>As something of an aside to this discussion, I have long thought that<br>movie music is be a great avenue for microtonal composers to get their<br>ideas to the proverbial masses.</div>
