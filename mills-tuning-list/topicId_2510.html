A very wide open question, I<br>>realise.<br>> I'm in the initial stages of design for a precision,<br>>multi-temperament machine initially aimed at Pipe Organ enthusiasts,<br>>which could provide facilities for up to 100 temperaments.<br>>Being for organs, it is primarly for 12 tone systems, but there is no<br>>reason why this could not adapted to other uses.<br>><br>> Let me know what you think, or are these machines anathema ?<br>>Terry.<br><br>I used to have a marvelous portable tuner I used to build many<br>microtonal machines about 15 years ago. I can't remember the<br>manufacturer or model, but it was a small blue box with 12 tone<br>choices, and two dials to tune them either ten cents or one cent sharp<br>and flat (coarse and fine adjustment). It had a set of 12 or so LED's<br>that would rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise until the note was in<br>tune. It had another dial to select the octave. It went missing on a<br>road trip in '81.<br><br>What I liked about it was the rugged construction, which allowed me to<br>use it in the garage where I built instruments without worry over<br>spilling machine oil, solder, or ashes into the guts of the machine.<br>Today I use a laptop computer, but I am always worried about damage. I<br>haven't found a good tuning program for the PC, but it seems like it<br>should be possible to listen to the microphone input and report<br>frequency in real time. Today, I build a set of .wav files in CSound<br>and select from the desired pitch, then tune by sound. I really miss<br>the rotating LED's.<br><br>There are a number of products on the market today that provide<br>microtonal tuning support. I have looked at the Accutone model 250,<br>with preprogrammed scales, and a three light strobe for $400; Korg<br>model MT-1200 wihch  can be programmed to temperments of your choice<br>for $300; Peterson 5000, with 112 customer definable temperment files;<br>Precision Strobe Tuner PST2, with the rotating LED's that I found<br>useful before and programmable temperments, for $325. All of these<br>assume that you are tuning 12 tones to the octave, but let you alter<br>any of those 12 to any note. With a little fancy temperment switching,<br>you can tune any number of tones to the octave with little trouble.<br><br>Yours,<br><br>Prent Rodgers<br>Boise, ID 83706<br><br>Internet: prodgers@us.ibm.com<br>=<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl<br>Subject:  Another version of 12-tET<br>PostedDate:  10-10-97 19:53:56<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  10-10-97 19:53:27-10-10-97 19:53:27,10-10-97 19:53:56-10-10-97 19:53:56<br>DeliveredDate:  10-10-97 19:53:56<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125652C.006242AD; Fri, 10 Oct 1997 19:53:16 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13513; Fri, 10 Oct 1997 19:53:56 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 10 Oct 1997 19:53:56 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13500<br>Received: (qmail 3744 invoked from network); 10 Oct 1997 10:53:52 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 10 Oct 1997 10:53:52 -0700<br>Message-Id: <C125652C.0061B07D.00@notesrv2.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
