All of them quickly generate a lot of scales, but<br>they are, for the greater part, scales that can not be accurately<br>reproduced on contemporary instruments.  Also, these methods are<br>mostly indifferent to the consonance of the scales they produce.<br><br>I use three methods which produce scales that will actually play<br>on a given instrument, and which tend to select consonant scales.<br><br>One obvious ploy, is to design an algorithm that only considers<br>scales that can be represented on some target hardware.  My<br>lcm60, filscal, and fil5 utilities fall into this category. <br>lcm60 searches through all the 5 limit scales that can be played<br>on the sound blaster and picks out those with more than a given<br>number of lcm60 chords.  In order to do this in a reasonable<br>length of time, I had to resort to an exotic form of arithmetic,<br>adding and subtracting factors instead of multiplying and<br>dividing.  That is the reason I have only so far done this for 5-<br>limit scales.  Going to 7-limit would expand the search space and<br>make the programming more difficult.<br><br>The fill method, starts with some arbitrary number, or numbers,<br>and then searches through all the possible remaining notes, and<br>selects the one which has the smallest LCM's with the existing<br>notes.  This procedure is iteratively applied until the scale is<br>filled.  fil5 restricts possible choices to 5-limit candidates.<br><br>The lcmscal, and nulcm utilities select scales with lower LCMs. <br>While it is true that a scale with a low LCM may not necessarily<br>produce chords with a low LCM, there seems to be enough<br>correlation to make the method useful.<br><br>Marion<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 1 Nov 1995 18:33 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA07446; Wed, 1 Nov 1995 08:33:41 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 1 Nov 1995 08:33:41 -0800<br>Message-Id: <00998C10A2A9F048.0A2B@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2230 href="#2230">ðŸ”—</a>David.Worrall@anu.edu.au (David Worrall)</h3><span>11/1/1995 9:09:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Helmut Wabnig writes<br><br>>I like listening to midi music, because it is free of "interpretation",<br>>which does not interest me.<br>><br><br>Now there's an interesting idea!
