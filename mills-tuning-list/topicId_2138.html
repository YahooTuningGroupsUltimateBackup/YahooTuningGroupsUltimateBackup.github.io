My daughter was also <br>listening, and asked who it was. I told her, and asked what she thought <br>of it (I already knew, though). She said she didn't like it, that it <br>reminded her of two very frightening people who used to be in her life, <br>and that it sounded like music that they used to play. She asked if I <br>would turn it off, and I did...fact is, this music DID sound weird and <br>scary, and I can understand why it would frighten a little kid. And, this <br>is a little kid who has, indeed, heard a lot of music, and much of it <br>pretty out there.<br>    What is the point? Well, I guess it has something to do with the <br>message one is putting across in their art. This music sounded creepy to <br>me as well, and I cannot imagine ever playing it for anyone in the world, <br>at any time. I see absolutely no value in this music, no matter what <br>tuning system it is in...the sad thing, of course, is where is the person <br>coming from that wrote/performed it? I truly believe that this person is <br>reflecting their inner state, and that is too bad, indeed. By the way, <br>this is the 2nd time this scenario has occured lately...in the other <br>incident, I was at a friend's house, who is an avant garde sort of (12 <br>tone) keyboard player. I was playing yet another prominant <br>microtonalist's music, and was asked to take it off of the stereo because <br>this fellow couldn't take it...it made him feel very depressed. Again, I <br>had to agree...it was not music that I would play for anyone else.<br>    It's tricky...I certainly think music should express the full range <br>of human experience. On the other hand, music that reminds a little kid <br>of certain perverts (they are that) is not, to my way of thinking, a good <br>thing. Again, it makes me sad for the artist in question as well. I have <br>long felt that much micromusic focuses on too narrow a band of feelings, <br>sort of a cerebral, weird melange of bleeps, bloops, and noodling. I <br>still do. There is a sort of (hate to say it) unhuman, removed, detached <br>kind of music that I feel is totally invalid as meaningful art...this is <br>the stuff that my kid was responding to today (and, a piece that gives me <br>much the same feeling is Schoenberg's Violin Concerto...it's like being <br>in a padded cell with white walls and a lot of Prozac)...of course, as <br>they say, opinions are like assholes, everybody's got one...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 11 Jun 1997 07:38 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12464; Wed, 11 Jun 1997 07:37:59 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 11 Jun 1997 07:37:59 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12465<br>Received: (qmail 23086 invoked from network); 11 Jun 1997 05:37:52 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 11 Jun 1997 05:37:52 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.91.970610223400.27554A-100000@si.UCSC.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5636 href="#5636">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>6/14/1997 3:30:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>The ear is specialised tissue that evolved from touch.<br>>There is no reason to assume that we hear only with our ears.<br>>I think our brains are acutely sensitive to a myriad range<br>>of electromagnetic fields; some of us are aware of it,<br>>most are not.<br><br>   These are both probably true statements, but it's important to<br>understand that these are by no means well-understood concerns.<br>Speculation about such things has produced far more sensationalism than<br>useful insight.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 14 Jun 1997 12:32 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA30593; Sat, 14 Jun 1997 12:32:22 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 14 Jun 1997 12:32:22 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA30588<br>Received: (qmail 19535 invoked from network); 14 Jun 1997 10:30:21 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 14 Jun 1997 10:30:21 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541100afc7a83f3414@[207.207.3.147]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
