My reasons for this are several.  Anyway, 443<br>is still too low it should be 450.<br><br>1. In indian music the note "ni" is 450 Hz.  For the Indian music scale<br>see http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/in_music.gif<br><br>2. There often exists an electromagnetic standing wave around the earth<br>called the Schumann resonance.  It has one main frequency mode given by<br>the speed of light divided by the earth's circumference or 300,000km/s /<br>40,000 km or 7.5 Hz.  When the natural Just Intonation scale is<br>calculated with this as a base you get <br>ratio      24    27    30    32    36    40    45    48<br>*7.5 Hz   180   212.5 225   240   270   300   337.5 360<br>Which gives 225 Hz or 450 Hz exactly the same as the Indian music<br>frequency.<br><br>3. Before the standard A=440 was set the naturally chosen value was<br>heading for 450 (please correct me on this one).<br><br>4. The tempo of music, which may be seen as an extension of the key, is<br>found to favour a slightly faster or slightly higher A.  This also leads<br>me to an answer of 450.  I will do a seperate post about this another<br>time as it is another whole subject.<br><br>So I think that people naturally want to use notes that fit the<br>frequencies in 2 above which will be the key of F and other keys based<br>on that.  That is because our brains are affected by e/m fields in<br>general and the Schumann resonance in particular (this is well<br>established).  Any other option is against (our) nature.<br><br>-- Ray Tomes -- rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz -- Harmonics Theory --<br>http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 8 Mar 1997 15:08 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08833; Sat, 8 Mar 1997 15:08:33 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09597<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id GAA05124; Sat, 8 Mar 1997 06:06:49 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 8 Mar 1997 06:06:49 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703080903_MC2-1249-C500@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5025 href="#5025">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MorriSonics@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/1997 7:48:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>-------------------- Begin Original Message --------------------<br><br>Message text written by INTERNET:tuning@ella.mills.edu<br><br>" Anyway, 443<br>is still too low it should be 450.<br>2.

Also, experiments show when we are subjected<br>to ELF (extra low frequency) waves which are a little slower or faster<br>than the typical Schumann resonance frequency our reaction times are<br>either slowed or speeded up.  Also, strong natural 3 Hz ELF waves have<br>been shown to correlate strongly with accidents (confirming that our<br>reactions are too slow).
