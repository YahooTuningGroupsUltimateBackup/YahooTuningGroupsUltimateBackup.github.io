By playing through a _descending_ harmonic<br>>> series with two notes and keeping a "B" on top, we<br>>> can see that the difference tone line creates an<br>>> _ascending_ minor scale that corresponds exactly to the<br>>> Undertone Series created earlier from mirror-imaging.<br><br>> The wording here is unclear -- anyone know what Jon<br>> meant by "playing through a _descending_ harmonic series<br>> with two notes and keeping a "B" on top"? Judging from<br>> the results, he probably meant something like "playing<br>> through a series of superparticular ratios, with the upper<br>> note fixed at "B", and the lower note descending."<br><br>This is exactly what he meant.  I believe this passage<br>refers to the part we just heard last night in "Sleeping<br>Beauty" where Jon does this on his JI electric guitar.<br> <br>   Joseph L.
