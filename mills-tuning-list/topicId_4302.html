The main problem I have encountered<br>with tuning them is that grinding between the nodes causes a phase or<br>beating effect.  I want to tune the bars, but preserve their timbre.  I<br>have tried a few things which are detailed below.  Any ideas you have,<br>Rick, or any one else on the list, would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>These bars comprise 1961 bell instrument that attempts to mimic cast bell<br>carillons.  Characteristics of the bars:<br><br>1.  Each has two solenoid strikers.  One primarily emphasizes the<br>fundamental (placed at the end of the bar), the other the second harmonic<br>(place just inside the vibrational node).  This creates an overlap<br>ofoctaves between the adjacent octave racks of bars. (5 racks of bars)<br><br>2.  The bars are varying lengths from about 20 cm to about 56 cm.  4 mm<br>square at the end (3/16th")<br><br>3.   the bars each have 3 brass (or bronze?) collars firmly attached along<br>predictable but somewhat<br>inconsistent places between the vibrational nodes.  They follow a general<br>pattern but are not in exactly the same relative postion from bar to bar. <br>It is my theory that these collars are used to tune and/or supress the<br>inharmonic partials.   The Collars are larger on the longest bars 5/16th"<br>wide, 3/32" wide on the shorter bars<br>I have experimented a little with moving them and<br>have found doing so creates significant changes in the timbre of the bar. <br>I have also noted that moving one collar further from its original position<br>causes a "beating" effect -- the further from original, the faster the<br>beating.  This is not a very predicable, consistent effect.<br><br>4.  Tuning of the bar by grinding metal from between the<br>vibrational nodes lowers the fundamental frequency as expected.  It has the<br>unfortunate effect of causing a slight phasing of about 2 cycles/second,<br>and significant loss of the original timbre of the bar.<br>****What is the cause of this effect?****  This effect is somewhat<br>corrected by moveing the brass collars, but not perfectly. <br>Placing weight on the end of bar also lowers the frequency, but that also<br>causes a phase effect. <br>I am experimenting with various tuning methods to determine how tune<br>without causing a phase effect.  <br><br>5.  There are five octaves of bars.<br><br>6.  There is a notch cut away on either side of each bar at the vibrational<br>nodes (20% of the length of the bar) effectively making the bars thinner at<br>the nodes. About 1/16th" thick at the nodes.<br><br>7.  The bars are suspended with string.  On one end the suspension point is<br>close to the vibrational node.  On the other end, it is at bit further from<br>the node, and closer to the end of the bar.  The suspension points are<br>consistent, relative to the total length of each bar.  The longest bar is<br>56.6 cm. Each of the nodes are at 11.6 cm (20%).  The suspension point on<br>the "magnet" end is at 7.5 cm (13% of the total length).  The suspension<br>point on the "solenoid" end is at 10.6 cm (18%)<br><br>8.  Each bar has a small but strong magnet one end that pokes up thru a<br>coil of magnet wire.</div>
