I thought it <br>interesting that you pointed out that you did not yet fully hear the <br>equivalency that your theory attributes to "morenoctaves." Has your feeling <br>changed any?<br><br>P.S. I will not deny that there is some equivalency in a ratio of 3:1 <br>(though probably not higher powers of 3). Using square waves helps bring <br>this out. However, there is no denying that even an out-of-tune octave, even <br>with square waves, will be heard as more of an equivalence than 3:1.<br><br> -Paul<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 7 Oct 1996 18:04 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03970; Mon, 7 Oct 1996 17:05:23 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03961<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA03439; Mon, 7 Oct 1996 09:04:51 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 7 Oct 1996 09:04:51 -0700<br>Message-Id: <54961007152245/0005695065PK2EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
