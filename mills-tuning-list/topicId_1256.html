Yasser thought the consonant chord in 19-equal had to be <br>constructed as every other note in a 12-note scale in 22. The perfect fifth <br>in 19-tone equal is closer to its harmonic series value that the <br>approximations to the eleventh and thirteenth harmonics in Yasser's hexad. <br>Since the hexad did not include the twelfth harmonic of the same <br>fundamental, Yasser concluded that the "perfect fifth" would have to be <br>treated as a dissonance. Of course this is backwards, but necessary for <br>Yasser to preserve his numerological patterns. These patterns happen not to <br>be consistent with each other when the details of Yasser's proposed <br>"super-ultra-tonality" or 19-out-of-31 system are worked out.<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 26 Nov 1996 01:13 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07624; Tue, 26 Nov 1996 01:15:15 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07661<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id QAA14453; Mon, 25 Nov 1996 16:15:12 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 25 Nov 1996 16:15:12 -0800<br>Message-Id: <42961125222324/0005695065PK2EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
