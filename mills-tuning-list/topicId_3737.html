I agree very<br>definitely that accurate rendering of pitch can present some intriguing<br>differences in how harmonies are perceived.  Thus JI vs. 12TET vs. various<br>other temperaments.<br><br>   But I think it's also worth pointing out that, most real-world<br>instruments (keyboards being a very important exception) are a very<br>different story.  The vast majority of instruments are imprecise-pitch<br>instruments, meaning that their players have to constantly monitor their<br>pitch, often correcting flaws in the acoustic design of the instrument<br>itself.<br><br>   But the reality of the matter is that for most instruments, it's often<br>difficult to play normal-speed music with 5- to 10-cent accuracy much less<br>1-cent accuracy.  Not impossible, true, but difficult.  I often practice my<br>tenor saxophone with the tuning meter turned on constantly, and I'll look<br>down to see notes sometimes over a comma off the nominal 12TET pitch.<br>Granted, that error is probably what causes me to look down at the tuner.<br><br>   Or to present this in a more extreme light, I'm currently struggling<br>with some sort of really obnoxious tuning problem on my soprano saxophone.<br>Certain pitch ranges on the horn routinely come out (without correcting<br>them) nearly a quartertone off!  It's extremely difficult to correct the<br>pitch of an instrument that much, so even after correcting them, those<br>notes almost always end up much more than a comma off.  And this is<br>otherwise a high-quality instrument (Yamaha YSS-675, retailing for well<br>over $3000), and at least one historically very good repairman couldn't<br>find anything wrong with it!<br><br>   So my point is this:  I agree that there are intriguing subtleties for<br>sustained chords down in the 1-cent-resolution range.  But it's very<br>important to understand that people in general are used to VASTLY more<br>"slop" in pitch than that.  They don't routinely operate down in the<br>pitch-discrimination realm of single cents for normal-speed music.  I<br>therefore personally find more intrigue in tunings that produce entirely<br>different intervals (e.g., 9:7 instead of 5:4), or entirely different scale<br>structures (e.g., no meaningful approximation to a diatonic scale).<br><br>   To me personally, entirely new harmonic resources and melodic scale<br>structures are more interesting than one- to five-cent distinctions of the<br>temperament of a well-known scale structure.</div><h3><a id=8111 href="#8111">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/1998 10:12:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Sun, 14 Jun 1998, Paul H.

I assume Paul E. is talking about the<br>reinterpretation of the traditional dominant seventh chord as a 4:5:6:7<br>tetrad.  However, this would imply an interval of 16/9 between the root<br>and the seventh, like so:<br><br>		5/4<br><br>16/9  [4/3]  1/1   3/2<br><br>and I'm not sure why one would choose 16/9 when that makes that pitch<br>totally unrelated (within the 5-limit) to any of the other pitches in<br>the chord.  Well, I mean, obviously it's the distance between the 4/3<br>and the 3/2 (3/4) of the key, critical pitches if you're using the dom7<br>actually as a _dominant_ 7th.  But considered purely as an isolated<br>sonority, within the 5-limit I would tune it thus:<br><br>   5/4<br><br>1/1   3/2<br><br>	 9/5<br><br>(Arrgh!  This is why I prefer ETs.  In an ET in which the 81/80<br>vanishes, these two are the same and you don't have to worry about it.)<br><br>I'm not very familiar with the barbershop style.  Do they generally use<br>the dominant 7th as V7 of the key, as opposed to jazz harmony which uses<br>it as a sound color that can occur almost anywhere, functionally?<br><br>The point is, given this interpretation the distance to the 4:5:6:7 is<br>36/35, which is the septimal comma plus the syntonic comma or nearly 49<br>cents, a significantly larger interval to swallow as a comma--though<br>still not as big as the 648/625 I mentioned in a previous message.<br><br>> >Now, the reason I started looking at this is because I have been <br>> >trying to work out some ideas about consistency.

It's not a _direct_ relationship (complexity,<br>or "n-ary-ness" as Patrick and I have been calling it in private<br>correspondence, comes into it as well, plus some other stuff too), but<br>it is a close one.<br><br>> >(i) choose the n-ET and the m-limit to be considered; <br>> >(ii) list the intervals which belong to the primary m-limit; <br>> >(iii) find the primary m-limit interval which is least well<br>> >approximated by the chosen n- ET; <br>> >(iv) add this interval to itself until the deviation from its <br>> >intended equivalent is greater than (1200/2n) cents; call the number <br>> >of additions at this point t. <br>> >(v) then n-ET is level-(t-1) consistent at the m-limit.<br>> <br>> This certainly doesn't work for level 1 consistency. Is this the thing<br>> that happens to work for higher levels? If so, how are you defining<br>> "primary" and "number of additions"?<br><br>We went over this when I first posted my algorithm to the list--the<br>difficulty comes in how the roundoff error of, say, the 5/3 is<br>calculated.  Rather than calculate the size of the 5/3 in steps of the<br>ET and finding the roundoff error directly, one must calculate the<br>roundoff error of the 5/4 and the 3/2 separately, and then subtract<br>them.  Given that, the algorithm works for level 1 as well as higher<br>levels of consistency.  It was easier to see from the pseudocode I<br>posted months back.<br><br>--pH <manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu> http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote<br>    O<br>   /\        "Churchill?

The septimal comma in barbershop harmony -- the<br>typical progression is several dominant sevenths, each the dominant of<br>the next. If the roots are tuned Pythagorean, and the chords 4:5:6:7,<br>then the septimal comma arises between the seventh of one chord and the<br>root of the chord two chords later, which notes are the same pitch<br>class. In an even more typical IV-V7-I progression, the septimal comma<br>arises between the root of the first chord and the seventh of the second<br>chord. In such an instance, "hiding" the comma is particularly important<br>for maintaining the coherence of the pitch-class set, in this case the<br>major scale.<br><br>------ =_NextPart_000_01BD9AE9.BB275DFE<br>Content-Type: application/ms-tnef<br>Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64<br><br>eJ8+IjMSAQaQCAAEAAAAAAABAAEAAQeQBgAIAAAA5AQAAAAAAADoAAEIgAcAGAAAAElQTS5NaWNy<br>b3NvZnQgTWFpbC5Ob3RlADEIAQWAAwAOAAAAzgcGABIADgAwACoABABZAQEggAMADgAAAM4HBgAS<br>AA4AMAAxAAQAYAEBCYABACEAAAA5MzREQ0Q5MEJDMDZEMjExQUNEMjAwODA1RkJFM0MwNQA2BwEE<br>gAEAGwAAAFJFOiBDb21tYXMgYW5kIENvbnNpc3RlbmN5AFYJAQ2ABAACAAAAAgACAAEDkAYApAcA<br>AC4AAAADADYAAAAAAAMABIAIIAYAAAAAAMAAAAAAAABGAAAAAFKFAAC3DQAAHgAFgAggBgAAAAAA<br>wAAAAAAAAEYAAAAAVIUAAAEAAAAEAAAAOC4wAAMABoAIIAYAAAAAAMAAAAAAAABGAAAAAAGFAAAA<br>AAAACwAAgAggBgAAAAAAwAAAAAAAAEYAAAAAA4UAAAAAAAALAA+ACCAGAAAAAADAAAAAAAAARgAA<br>AAAOhQAAAAAAAAMAEIAIIAYAAAAAAMAAAAAAAABGAAAAABCFAAAAAAAAAwARgAggBgAAAAAAwAAA<br>AAAAAEYAAAAAEYUAAAAAAAADABSACCAGAAAAAADAAAAAAAAARgAAAAAYhQAAAAAAAB4AJIAIIAYA<br>AAAAAMAAAAAAAABGAAAAADaFAAABAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAeACWACCAGAAAAAADAAAAAAAAARgAAAAA3<br>hQAAAQAAAAEAAAAAAAAAHgAmgAggBgAAAAAAwAAAAAAAAEYAAAAAOIUAAAEAAAABAAAAAAAAAAIB<br>CRABAAAAkQIAAI0CAADMAwAATFpGdVvUlXoDAAoAcmNwZzEyNdIyAPszNgHoIAKkA+MJAgBjaArA<br>c2V0MDYgBxMCgH0KgAjIIDubCW8OMDUCgAqBdWMAUC0LA2MAQQtgbg4QMDNCMwumIFBhdQMgSLwu<br>LAqiCoQKgAhQbQDAMQQgdHlwDeAHQGx5hiAKwAQAZSBubwVAKQPwdGgLgCALgGRp0HZpZHUHQCAQ<br>0AWwkmQEIGJ1BUBvdgSQ7CBzA3AYwHMKsBlyGHAOIBgABZAYwG9mIG1qdQ3RLBkQaASQGMB2/xiB<br>CGAEIBDhBGADAAeRCsCnGMAFoACAdHIUUHQJgHYgA1IcAWcZwAnwHCF0ORDQLWMLYAQREREuIP5U<br>HUAhMQUwB3AaEheCG9KqYgrAYgSQcxpQcB4F+RhgLS0X0CGhF+UcIANgfwnBBBAdwBlxISIbARoR<br>ZD8DcAuAAHAFQCYCAjBoc/UdEGUA0GgkQyaHHJEkUuhuZXghYUko5ANgGPCZHpR0dSlAH5BQeRlA<br>7GFnBbAnsG4dEABwH5ADJFIaRTQ6NTo2Ov43HRAkUQOgJFIh3RiDGpH9ESB3CeEtpSczHIICICxF<br>3yvXKhIoxjEEL3BvGjYLYP0fcHIdEg3gJ+AY4R6FLbP+YRthIIMaMCDyKYEb8QOgDyciHLArcSSH<br>SVYtVvg3LUklCi1DLe8u/zHb/GZpEQAFQDEMMBk5VB7x9x+QGkM2Y3MUUCfgG7MfIHcAcBxgHRAi<br>GVAZsBVAIt8sFCJ0BCAKsSIAYxZQCsD7GFEHcHAJESbSAhAFwADA/wuAAZALgEERQVUdQkCBKMb/<br>II0dEBlhGUEEIBggGLEkUp0AwGoFsQTwB0BlLhTRFwFAFsMR0QBJsAAAAAMAJgAAAAAAAwAuAAAA<br>AAALAAIAAQAAAB4AcAABAAAAEwAAAFRVTklORyBkaWdlc3QgMTQ1MAAAAgFxAAEAAAAbAAAAAb2a<br>yJ3FbrIwFQYBEdKs0gCAX748BQAHoMOgAEAAOQCQ2km36Zq9AQMA8T8JBAAAHgAxQAEAAAAGAAAA<br>UEFVTEUAAAADABpAAAAAAB4AMEABAAAABgAAAFBBVUxFAAAAAwAZQAAAAAADAP0/5AQAAAMAgBD/<br>////AgFHAAEAAAAzAAAAYz1VUzthPSA7cD1BY2FkaWFuLUFzc2V0O2w9TUFSUy05ODA2MTgxODQ4<br>NDJaLTgwOTMAAAIB+T8BAAAASwAAAAAAAADcp0DIwEIQGrS5CAArL+GCAQAAAAAAAAAvTz1BQ0FE<br>SUFOLUFTU0VUL09VPUFBTS9DTj1SRUNJUElFTlRTL0NOPVBBVUxFAAAeAPg/AQAAAA8AAABQYXVs<br>IEguIEVybGljaAAAHgA4QAEAAAAGAAAAUEFVTEUAAAACAfs/AQAAAEsAAAAAAAAA3KdAyMBCEBq0<br>uQgAKy/hggEAAAAAAAAAL089QUNBRElBTi1BU1NFVC9PVT1BQU0vQ049UkVDSVBJRU5UUy9DTj1Q<br>QVVMRQAAHgD6PwEAAAAPAAAAUGF1bCBILiBFcmxpY2gAAB4AOUABAAAABgAAAFBBVUxFAAAAQAAH<br>MHJa2Nznmr0BQAAIMP5dJ7vpmr0BHgA9AAEAAAAFAAAAUkU6IAAAAAAeAB0OAQAAABcAAABDb21t<br>YXMgYW5kIENvbnNpc3RlbmN5AAAeADUQAQAAAC4AAAA8QkUxQkZEMDczOUQ4RDExMUFDQzgwMDgw<br>NUZCRTNDMDUxNDk1RTBATUFSUz4AAAALACkAAAAAAAsAIwAAAAAAAwAGENj1eE4DAAcQlAIAAAMA<br>EBAAAAAAAwAREAEAAAAeAAgQAQAAAGUAAABQQVVMSCxDT01NQVNUWVBJQ0FMTFlBUklTRU5PVFdJ<br>VEhJTklORElWSURVQUxDSE9SRFNCVVRPVkVSU09NRVNQQU5JTkFQSUVDRU9GTVVTSUMsV0hFUkVW<br>QVJJT1VTSEFSTU9OAAAAAAIBfwABAAAALgAAADxCRTFCRkQwNzM5RDhEMTExQUNDODAwODA1RkJF<br>M0MwNTE0OTVFMEBNQVJTPgAAACKf<br><br>------ =_NextPart_000_01BD9AE9.BB275DFE--</div>
