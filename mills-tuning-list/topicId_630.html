I did <br>have some quarter-tone pieces of mine performed years ago when I was at <br>the Royal College, and still shudder when I recall overhearing someone in <br>the audience ask his neighbour, 'Have they finished tuning up yet?' (As a <br>matter of fact _I_ wasn't sure whether they had or not.)<br><br>I'm tying to get to grips with Scala and I wondered if someone might be <br>able to tell me why, when I type 'help' it says, 'Help is available for <br>the following items:' That's all it says. There _are_ no following items. <br>I've also tried 'help append', 'help intersect' and so on. What am I <br>doing wrong? What a terrific piece of work Scala is, by the way.<br><br><br>Peter Brewis<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 20 Jul 1996 08:59 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id XAA19044; Fri, 19 Jul 1996 23:59:42 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 19 Jul 1996 23:59:42 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199607200658.AAA14652@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
