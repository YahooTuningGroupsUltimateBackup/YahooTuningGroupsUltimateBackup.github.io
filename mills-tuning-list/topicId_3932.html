Introduction<br>---------------<br><br>This paper grows out of two germinal articles in _Xenharmonikon_ 17:<br>Paul Erlich's far-ranging presentation on scale theory and 22-tone<br>equal temperament (22-tet) [1], and Brian McLaren's sweeping<br>chronicles of microtonalism in the 20th century [2].<br><br>Both articles, in different ways, raise the question of how one might<br>go about evaluating the harmonic possibilities of a given tuning<br>dividing the octave into n number of equal parts -- that is, an n-tone<br>equal temperament (n-tet).<br><br>While the term "harmonic" can mean many things to many people, I use<br>it here basically in the sense of the "vertical" dimension of music:<br>that is, the aspect of music concerned with sonorities of two or more<br>simultaneous tones, and progressions involving such sonorities.<br><br>Thus while both 13th-century and 18th-century Western European music<br>are harmonically oriented, they are "harmonic" in very different ways,<br>differing in their historical tunings, stable and unstable interval<br>categories, and directed cadences. Curiously, certain scales such as<br>53-tet can provide an excellent fit with _either_ harmonic system.<br><br>In evaluating the harmonic possibilities of n-tet's, we need ways of<br>mapping both the scales themselves and the harmonic systems they might<br>realize in whole or part. This paper represents one approach to this<br>multidimensional perspective.<br><br>Section 2 considers conceptual maps for n-tet scales themselves, while<br>Section 3 focuses on maps for some harmonic systems, and presents some<br>tentative observations about a few n-tet's including Erlich's<br>intriguing 22-tet. Section 4 proposes directions for further<br>analysis.<br><br>At the outset, I should offer a vital disclaimer: this paper focuses<br>mainly on Western European tunings and harmonic systems from around<br>1200 to the present, and thus presents at best a very partial and<br>biased sample of the musical possibilities. Other systems, for example<br>gamelan tunings approximating 5-tet or 7-tet, deserve equal<br>consideration, very possibly calling for a modification of the models<br>which follow. Being aware of the dangers of "universal" models of<br>language or music which prove to be more provincial than their authors<br>suspect, I would strongly caution that this paper is not exempt from<br>such dangers.<br><br><br>-------------------------------------------------------<br>2. Maps for scales: just intervals and meantone tunings<br>-------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In orienting ourselves to a given n-tet, there are at least two<br>familiar conceptual maps available. One approach is to compare the<br>intervals of an n-tet with those of a just intonation system based on<br>integer ratios, such as Pythagorean tuning or Zarlino's tuning for<br>vocal music. Another is to compare an n-tet with meantone systems<br>where all fifths (except possibly one) are tempered by the same<br>amount.<br><br>Both approaches have a long history. Using the just intonation<br>approach, for example, we can say that 53-tet offers excellent<br>approximations both for the true Pythagorean major third of 81:64 and<br>the Zarlinan major third of 5:4. Using the meantone approach, we can<br>say that 19-tet has a close kinship to 1/3-comma meantone, and 31-tet<br>to 1/4-comma meantone.[3]<br><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------<br>2.1. Intonational justice: limits, mixes, and curiosities  <br>---------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In describing just intonation systems, it is common to refer to the<br>most complex prime number used in generating the intervals of a given<br>system as its "n-limit."<br><br>Thus in a 3-limit or quintal just intonation system -- often known as<br>Pythagorean tuning -- all interval ratios are derived from multiples<br>of 2 and 3, with the pure fifth (3:2) as the generating interval. In a<br>5-limit system such as Zarlino's, the pure major third (5:4) also<br>becomes a generative ratio. In a 7-limit system, the septimal minor<br>seventh (7:4) also becomes literally and figuratively a "prime factor"<br>in defining the scale, and so on.<br><br>In doing "intonational justice" to these systems, it is very important<br>to recognize that the prime limit of a given system is not necessarily<br>the "limit" of intervals perceived by users of the tuning to be<br>"concordant" or musically valuable. This point is of crucial<br>importance to the analysis which follows, so illustrations may be<br>helpful.<br><br>Thus in the complex 3-limit system of Gothic polyphony, the major<br>third (81:64) and minor third (32:27) are ranked as relatively<br>concordant in theory, and in practice play a vital role as mildly<br>unstable intervals in various sonorities. The just 9-based intervals<br>of the major second (9:8), minor seventh (16:9), and major ninth<br>(9:4), although regarded as somewhat more tense, are also credited<br>with some "compatibility" or "concord," adding harmonic color and<br>action to the music. Around 1400, the even more complex schismatic<br>form of major third (8192:6561) plays a pivotal role in keyboard<br>tuning systems and compositions.<br><br>While the 5-limit just intonation of the Renaissance tends to<br>correlate with less subtly shaded theoretical schemes of concord and<br>discord, nevertheless authors such as Zarlino recognize the vital role<br>of intervals such as the major second (9:8 or 10:9), minor seventh<br>(9:5), and major seventh (15:8) in gracing a music based mainly on<br>5-limit consonances. Composers of the Manneristic epoch around 1600<br>such as Monteverdi and Gesualdo exploit such intervals more boldly, as<br>well as the diminished fifth (45:32) already endorsed by Zarlino as<br>pleasing when aptly resolved.<br><br>Much 20th-century music intended for 12-tet provides an even more<br>dramatic example, where stable sonorities involving mixtures of thirds<br>and minor sevenths may suggest a "7-limit" concept, although the<br>tuning system offers no close approximation of a 7:4 ratio.[4]<br><br>Further, with just intonation systems as with others, the very<br>_deviations_ of certain intervals from the simplest or "purest"<br>possible ratios can have a musical value all its own. For example, the<br>complexity of a 3-limit major third (81:64) nicely fits the Gothic<br>concept of "imperfect concord," while the analogous tension of a<br>5-limit minor seventh (9:5) adds an edge to Renaissance suspensions<br>and the bolder formations of a Monteverdi. A just appraisal should<br>strive to recognize such intervals as features, not as the "flaws"<br>they might well be in the context of a different system.<br><br>Having considered some complications of the "n-limit" concept itself,<br>we face the further complication that a given n-tet may approximate a<br>mixture of intervals from various n-limit systems, sometimes a<br>curiously selective one.<br><br>For example, 53-tet has excellent 3-limit, 5-limit, and 7-limit<br>approximations, so that it might be used for any style of harmony from<br>Gothic to 7-limit just.. While 12-tet also offers a very good 3-limit<br>approximation, it fits 5-limit intervals rather less accurately, and<br>7-limit intervals still less so.<br><br>Other scales, however, may offer a "mixed bag" of approximations not<br>so easily described. Thus 19-tet and 22-tet offer fair approximations<br>of 3-limit intervals (with the fifth in either case about 7 cents from<br>a just 3:2), but much closer approaches to just 5-limit intervals. In<br>17-tet, we have a good 3-limit approximation of 3:2 and 4:3, and also<br>major and minor thirds not too far from 9:7 and 7:6 respectively --<br>but no real equivalents for 5-limit intervals.<br><br>Even more intriguingly, 11-tet has no real equivalents for 3-limit<br>fifths or fourths, but reasonable approximations for the 5-limit minor<br>third (5:4) and major sixth (5:3), as well as the 7-limit or 9-limit<br>major third (9:7) and minor seventh (7:4).<br><br>Brian McLaren notes that in scales such as 13-tet, 18-tet, and 23-tet,<br>"the thirds are reasonably good but there is nothing like a perfect<br>fifth."[5] Such scales are in fact an opportunity to realize<br>traditional harmonic systems in new ways, or indeed to construct new<br>systems, an opportunity which, as McLaren urges, should not be missed.<br><br><br>--------------------------<br>2.2. The meantone spectrum<br>--------------------------<br><br>A different paradigm for mapping n-tet's is the meantone spectrum,<br>ranging in historical terms from Pythagorean tuning (0-comma meantone)<br>to around 1/3-comma of tempering. This spectrum may be expanded in<br>both directions to embrace regular tunings with fifths wider than a<br>just 3:2, or narrower than just by more than 1/3 syntonic comma.<br><br>Certain points on the meantone spectrum coincide with just tunings.<br>Thus Pythagorean tuning is both a just intonation system and a<br>meantone tuning, although not a meantone _temperament_. Curiously, the<br>5-limit just tuning with a fifth equal to 16384:10935 (precisely a<br>schisma narrower than 3:2) very closely approximates 1/11-comma<br>meantone and 12-tet. Other points offer just ratios for certain<br>intervals: thus 1/4-comma meantone has pure 5-limit major thirds (5:4)<br>and minor sixths (8:5), while 1/3-comma has pure minor thirds (6:5)<br>and major sixths (5:3).<br><br>At first blush, it might seem both intuitive and easy to place a range<br>of n-tet's on the meantone spectrum based on the size of fifth. Thus<br>19-tet is much like 1/3-comma temperament with its quite narrow fifths<br>and pure minor thirds, and 31-tet like 1/4-comma with its somewhat<br>more moderate tempering of the fifth and pure major thirds. Less<br>familiarly, for example, 91-tet approximates 1/7-comma meantone, with<br>somewhat restful thirds (vis-a-vis Pythagorean or 12-tet).<br><br>This kind of orientation based on fifth size can work even for certain<br>tunings beyond the historically familiar range. Thus 17-tet, with a<br>fifth of around 705.88 cents, seems to behave as we might expect,<br>serving as a kind of "ultra-Pythagorean" tuning with "superactive"<br>thirds and sixths urgently inviting resolution to stable 3-limit<br>intervals.[6] Even here, however, the novel element of the neutral<br>third cautions that new systems are more than stimulating variations<br>on old ones.<br><br>A reading of Erlich's insightful article, even if one has (like<br>myself) only begun to digest the riches there offered, neatly reveals<br>how misleading it can be to judge a tuning in this way on the basis of<br>its fifth size. In 22-tet, the fifth at 709.09 cents is more than 7.13<br>cents wide, yet the scale offers nice approximations of 5-limit thirds<br>and sixths, as well as the 7-limit and 9-limit intervals present in<br>11-tet (a subset).[7]<br><br>In short, the meantone model is a "map" which works fairly well for<br>some n-tet's, but not for others. In this area as in others, 22-tet is<br>a tuning with lots of musical and conceptual surprises to upset such<br>models (at least when applied overbroadly) in a delightful way.<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>3. Harmonic systems: trines, triads, tetrads, and beyond<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br><br>During the long interval of Western European composition from around<br>1200 to 1900, interestingly enough, harmonic systems were based on two<br>structures requiring a mininum of three voices: the medieval 3-limit<br>trine (string ratio 12:8:6, frequency ratio 2:3:4); and the<br>Renaissance to Romantic 5-limit triad (string ratio 15:12:10,<br>frequency ratio 4:5:6). Both threefold sonorities have inspired poetic<br>and even theological allegory.[8]<br><br>Since the time of Debussy, more complex sonorities have been accepted<br>as stable: for example, tetrads such as the "added sixth" (12:15:18:20<br>in one possible 5-limit tuning) and "minor seventh" (12:14:18:21 in a<br>9-limit tuning).<br><br>One obvious requisite of realizing a given harmonic system with a<br>given n-tet is that "reasonable" approximations of the intervals<br>involved in such stable structures be available. Thus 53-tet seems a<br>superb choice for either trinic or triadic harmony. While 12-tet<br>likewise would be a reasonable choice for either system, its almost<br>pure fifths but rather active thirds might make it more apt for trinic<br>than for triadic styles.<br><br>In contrast, 17-tet has good fifths and fourths for trinic sonorities,<br>but no intervals close enough to 5:4 or 6:5 to support a conventional<br>triadic system. With 11-tet, we have fair approximations for the<br>triadic concords of the minor third (6:5) and major sixth (5:3) -- but<br>no fifths or fourths of the kind required for either trinic or triadic<br>sonorities of a historical kind.[9]<br><br>With 22-tet, as Erlich rightly emphasizes, we have a set of intervals<br>which may not fit this or that specific integer ratio as well as some<br>other n-tet's, but which covers all bases, as it were, supporting a<br>very diverse range of trines, triads, and tetrads.[10]<br><br><br>-------------------------------------------------------<br>3.2. Broader views: quintal/quartal, tertian, and other<br>-------------------------------------------------------<br><br>To make our map of harmonic systems more inclusive, and thus more<br>accommodating to the special potentials of a variety of n-tet's, we<br>must note that the trinic-triadic-tetradic paradigm of composed<br>Western European and related music is only one possible approach.<br><br>More generally, we might view Gothic trinicism as one subset of<br>_quintal/quartal_ harmony where fifths and fourths serve as the most<br>euphonious simple intervals, and Renaissance-Romantic triadicism<br>likewise as a subset of _tertian_ harmony based on thirds and sixths<br>as the most favored intervals. A given n-tet might support some of<br>these intervals but not others, as in the case of 11-tet. We should<br>not ignore the tertian possibilities of this scale because it happens<br>not to have anything like a triadic fifth.<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>3.3. Instability, system, and expressiveness<br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Also, even in focusing on the historical trinic and triadic systems,<br>we should note the vital role of _unstable_ sonorities in defining the<br>qualities of a system. For example, in Gothic style, complex 3-limit<br>sonorities such as 4:6:9 or 9:12:16 may have a rather concordant<br>quality; in traditional 5-limit harmony, as Erlich notes [11], these<br>sonorites serve as "suspended" dissonances; and in 20th-century<br>quartal/quintal harmony they may form stable chords of the fifth and<br>fourth.<br><br>Similarly, in Gothic style, a combination of three superimposed thirds<br>(e.g. e-g-b-d') may resolve to a stable 3-limit sonority (e.g. f-c');<br>in triadic harmony, it may resolve to a 5-limit sonority; in 7-limit<br>harmony, it may serve as a stable tetrad.<br><br>Looking _only_ at the stable intervals of a given harmonic system, we<br>might overlook some crucial ways in which a "kindred" n-tet can alter<br>and distort the subtle "balance of power" between the intervals,<br>possibly in creative ways.<br><br>For example, while I have referred to 17-tet as a "neo-Gothic" tuning,<br>its distortions of the Gothic harmonic spectrum might well warrant, at<br>the least, an accent upon the _neo-_ portion of this description. In<br>theory and practice, Gothic music is premised on a tuning system where<br>major and minor thirds (81:64, 32:27) are somewhat more concordant<br>than bare major seconds and minor sevenths (9:8, 16:9) -- although<br>these intervals alike are often regarded as neither stable nor sharply<br>discordant.<br><br>In 17-tet, with its major thirds of around 423.53 cents, this order is<br>arguably reversed, altering the harmonic color of the system radically<br>although many of the standard trinic resolutions (e.g. those involving<br>M3-5 and M6-8 by stepwise contrary motion) remain quite practical. In<br>fact, these progressions may take on an extra quantum of force from<br>the increased level of harmonic tension and the "supernarrow"<br>70.59-cent leading tone; but we have moved into the realm of<br>Xeno-Gothic as opposed to Gothic style.[12]<br><br>If our purpose is a more or less faithful approximation of the actual<br>Gothic interval system, then Pythagorean just intonation would be<br>ideal, and 53-tet -- or, yes, 12-tet -- a wiser choice than 17-tet.<br><br>If our purpose is instead a _really_ novel distortion of the modified<br>Pythagorean system in vogue around 1400, with its prominent mixture of<br>regular and schismatic thirds and sixths, then Erlich's 22-tet has<br>some unique possibilities. While the fifth -- or "perfect seventh" in<br>Erlich's decatonic system -- is about 7.14 cents wide of 3:2, it is<br>closer to just than in 1/3-comma meantone or 19-tet, and might lend an<br>interesting flavor to stable trines.<br><br>The striking "neo-late-Gothic" feature of 22-tet is its drastically<br>contrasting versions of intervals I will here call in traditional<br>fashion thirds and sixths, although Erlich's decatonic nomenclature is<br>well worth studying and may give a better insight into the scale's<br>structure[13]:<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>    Late Gothic keyboard tuning                   22-tet<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>  interval       ratio      cents          steps   cents  approx<br>m3 (regular)     32:27     294.13            5    272.73   ~7:6      <br>m3 (schisma)  19683:16384  317.60            6    327.27   ~6:5<br><br>M3 (schisma)   8192:6561   384.36            7    381.82   ~5:4<br>M3 (regular)     81:64     407.82            8    436.36   ~9:7<br><br>m6 (regular)    128:81     792.18           14    763.64  ~14:9<br>m6 (schisma)   6561:4096   815.64           15    818.18   ~8:5<br><br>M6 (schisma)  32768:19683  882.40           16    872.73   ~5:3<br>M6 (regular)     27:16     905.87           17    936.95  ~12:7<br>_____________________________________________________________________<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In either system, we have contrasting pairs of more active and more<br>blending thirds and sixths -- but with the "active" forms much more<br>dramatically so in 22-tet, to say the least. One attraction of n-tet's<br>is their ability to transform the familiar into the new, and Erlich's<br>tuning does so in ways a musician might especially relish.<br><br><br>-----------------------------<br>4. Conclusions and directions<br>-----------------------------<br><br>The above analysis should not invalidate any of the historically<br>realized harmonic possibilities, nor the xenharmonic possibilities<br>already being realized in practice and theory. For example, McLaren's<br>engaging chronicles sum up one outlook on n-tet's:<br><br>       "Scales without fifths -- viz., 9, 11, or 13 tones per<br>        octave -- favor a fast-paced contrapuntal style with<br>        brisk percussive timbres, while scales with excellent<br>        fifths, like 31, 41, 53, or 118 tones per octave, favor<br>        a triadic homophonic style of composition."[14]<br><br>The concepts I have sketched might lead us to take this conventional<br>wisdom -- if one can use this term in such an experimental context --<br>and season it with some further questions. For example, does "triadic"<br>here mean specifically "5-limit" or "tertian," or might it have<br>Partch's wider sense of any three-tone combination (e.g. 1:3:9)? A<br>tuning such as 53-tet can nicely support trinic, triadic (in the<br>tertian sense), or tetradic harmony, and all these potentials merit<br>exploration.<br><br>Also, where would a tuning such as 17-tet fall in such a dichotomy? It<br>has an "excellent" fifth, closer to a just 3:2 than 31-tet, for<br>example -- but is hardly ideal for "triadic" harmony, at least in a<br>tertian sense. However, it might nicely support a "homophonic style<br>of composition" based on Xeno-Gothic progressions from unstable<br>7-limit or 9-limit sonorities for three or more voices to stable<br>3-limit sonorities -- and possibly "reverse suspensions" where a third<br>resolves to a fourth or a major second.[15]<br><br>Finally, although this may be a curious comment for one of Pythagorean<br>inclinations, I would like to join McLaren in questioning whether the<br>fifth need be treated as the only generative interval for scales or<br>harmonic systems.[16] If a tuning such as 11-tet or 13-tet happens not<br>to have any equivalent of 3:2, why not focus on the various 5-limit,<br>7-limit, 9-limit, and other intervals it _does_ approximate, and<br>develop a concept of harmonic style -- possibly in some cases<br>"homophonic" -- from there?<br><br>As McLaren shows in this and other portions of his history, timbre is<br>indeed a crucial factor. Personally, I have found that intervals near<br>9:7, for example, can take on a pleasant effect if given a certain<br>kind of "choirlike" voicing available on some synthesizers, lending<br>themselves to slower textures with resolutions to fifths in a<br>Gothic-like fashion.<br><br>Of course, one might add that "a fast-paced contrapuntal style" can<br>suit a wide variety of n-tet's, as it has often suited composers<br>of the Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque traditions based more or less<br>on the ideal of some kind of just intonation.<br><br>Both McLaren and Erlich have helped show the way to new realms of<br>theory and practice, while very fruitfully inviting more open<br>questions.<br><br><br>                                -----<br>                                Notes<br>                                -----<br><br>1. Paul Erlich, "Tuning, Tonality and Twenty-Two Tone Temperament,"<br>_Xenharmonikon_ 17 (Spring 1998), 12-40.<br><br>2. Brian McLaren, "A Brief History of Microtonality in the Twentieth<br>Century," _Xenharmonikon_ 17 (Spring 1998), 57-110.<br><br>3. Here it may be wise to explain that meantone tunings are commonly<br>described by specifying the fraction of a syntonic comma (81:80, about<br>21.51 cents) by which 11 of the 12 fifths of a familiar 12-tone<br>chromatic scale are tempered. Conventionally, it is assumed that this<br>tempering is in the _narrow_ direction. Thus in 1/4-comma meantone,<br>each fifth is narrowed by 1/4 syntonic comma or about 5.38 cents,<br>being reduced from a just 3:2 (about 701.955 cents) to around 697.58<br>cents. In the special case of 12-tet, the 12th fifth (traditionally<br>often g#-eb, for example) is tempered (in theory) by precisely the<br>same amount as the other 11, all being equal to 700 cents.<br><br>4. Not so surprisingly, given its affinities to Pythagorean tuning,<br>12-tet offers a better approximation of just intonation for sonorities<br>built in fourths or fifths (e.g. d-g-c' or d-a-e', calling ideally for<br>3:2, 4:3, 16:9, 9:4, etc.) than for sonorities built with 5-limit or<br>higher thirds; 20th-century harmony draws on both possibilities.<br><br>5. McLaren, see n. 2 above, at p. 87.<br><br>6. Of course, such expectations assume a familiarity with the Gothic<br>harmonic styles of the 13th and 14th centuries.<br><br>7. Erlich, see n. 1 above, explores the potentials of 22-tet vis-a-vis<br>other n-tet's at some length; see especially pp. 13-22.<br><br>8. Thus the trine (outer octave, lower fifth, upper fourth) for<br>Johannes de Grocheio (c. 1300), and likewise the triad for later<br>theorists such as Johannes Lippius, Johannes Kepler, and Andreas<br>Werckmeister, was a "perfect harmony" representing in music the<br>harmony of the Trinity. In traditional theories based on string<br>ratios, these two sonorities represent the harmonic divisions of the<br>octave (12:8:6) and fifth (15:12:10) respectively. From the<br>perspective of frequency ratios, each presents three adjacent tones in<br>the harmonic series (2:3:4, 4:5:6) beginning with a tone equal to 2^n<br>of the fundamental. <br><br>9. For McLaren's comments on other n-tet's presenting a similar<br>situation of "no fifths but good thirds," see n. 7 above. Systems with<br>fifths varying from a just 3:2 by as much as around 7 cents on the<br>narrow side (1/3-comma meantone, 19-tet) or the wide side (22-tet) can<br>clearly support a "triadic" style of harmony; some systems of unequal<br>well-temperament narrow certain fifths in a triadic context by as much<br>as 1/3 Pythagorean comma, or about 7.82 cents.<br><br>10. Erlich, see n. 1 above, at p. 25, offers a very handy table<br>showing the intervals of 22-tet and the many integer ratios nicely<br>approximated by the tuning.<br><br>11. Ibid., at pp. 12-13 and 26. <br><br>12. "Xeno-Gothic" can refer to a specific just tuning based on a chain<br>of 23 pure fifths generating a 24-note octave, or to a set of Gothic<br>and "Gothic-like" progressions supported by this scale, or to a<br>general attitude. A Xeno-Gothic tuning includes the medieval 12-note<br>chromatic Pythagorean scale as a subset, but additionally introduces<br>new forms of unstable intervals a Pythagorean comma wider or narrower<br>than usual. The "Xeno-" aspect may relate especially to such<br>intervals, which for example can form unstable combinations resembling<br>7-limit or 9-limit tetrads (e.g. ~12:14:18:21) resolving to stable<br>3-limit trinic harmonies. A scale such as 17-tet or 22-tet, which<br>includes both reasonable approximations of 3:2 and 4:3 and intervals<br>resembling 9:7, 12:7, or 7:4, for example, can therefore elicit a<br>"Xeno-Gothic" response: "Let's try having that near-9:7 expand to a<br>fifth, and that near-12:7 to an octave -- or having that near-7:4<br>contract to a fifth, etc."<br><br>13. Erlich, see n. 1 above, e.g. at p. 25, Table 1. This scheme is<br>indeed a radically different "map" for the intervals: thus 17 steps is<br>a "minor 9th" (about 927.3 cents), while 18 steps is a "major ninth"<br>(about 981.8 cents). Much of the surrounding analysis is breathtaking,<br>the musical equivalent of walking around in some higher-level<br>geometry. Interestingly, as discussed in recent Tuning List posts,<br>22-tet with its decatonic scale may invite some Jewish allegories,<br>adding another view to the metaphors discussed in n. 8 above.<br><br>14. McLaren, see n. 2 above, at p. 81. Here the author's emphasis is<br>on the realization that "_all_ equal temperaments are equally useful<br>for composing beautiful music" (emphasis in original).<br><br>15. Here I am warmly indebted to John Chalmers, Jr. and Gary Morrison<br>for many discussions about the possibilities of systems such as<br>17-tet, but of course any dubious conclusions expressed in this paper<br>are solely my responsibility.<br><br>16. McLaren, see n. 2 above, at pp. 86-87, specifically raises<br>questions about models of "diatonicism" presented in classic works of<br>Joseph Yasser and Easley Blackwood as the best basis for approaching<br>tunings such as 13-tet, 18-tet, and 23-tet -- and also many of the<br>5*n-tet's (e.g. 10-tet, 15-tet, etc.)  which violate Blackwood's<br>requirements for a "recognizable diatonic" tuning. It seems to me that<br>such questioning is in the best tradition of these two theorists.<br><br><br>Most respectfully,<br><br>Margo Schulter<br>mschulter@value.net</div><h3><a id=8405 href="#8405">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;John Loffink&#x22; &#x3C;jloffink@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/1998 8:45:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in><br><br>><br>>I'm happy to anounce I'm now the  owner<br>>of a Yamaha PSR-530, XG compatible keyboard.

I<br>just checked them out at MARS last weekend and have updated my web site.<br><br>>>yamaha and roland synths both have sysex messages for<br>>>scale tuning, which allows you to change the tuning of all<br>>>tones in one pitch class (all c's, all c#'s ..) in increments of 1 cent.<br>><br>>Actually, I believe Yamaha has fudged the terminology in the<br>>manual for the PSR-530. The MIDI Master tuning can in fact be  tuned<br>>-100 cent to -100 cent. But for microtonal tuning ("Scale Tuning" in<br>>Yamaha speak), they could potentially confuse users with little<br>>microtonal technical knowledge, because this is what they say :<br>><br>>"...alows each individual note of the octave to be tuned over the<br>>range from -64 to +64 cents in 1 -cent increments (1 cent = 1/100th<br>>of a semitone)."<br>><br>>These are actually 64ths of a semitone, aren't they ?<br><br><br>I think they actually are 1 cent increments, though possibly mapped to some<br>non-1 cent interval like 1200/768.<br><br>><br>>Just using a keyboard with atleast one split point, it is possible to<br>>fool around with many equal temperaments. I've been giving it a bit of<br>>thought and it should handle equal temps of upto 24 notes per octave.<br>>All it entails is transposing both left & right sides to the same<br>>"octave" range,<br>>then tuning the both parts to the odd numbered pitches of an ET, and<br>>shifting<br>>the channel master tune so the pitches on the right hand become the even<br>>numbered pitches of the scale.<br>><br><br>You could do quartertone scales this way, but not any other nTETs.<br><br>One more note, I checked out Emu's ESynth with the latest operating system,<br>EOS 3.20e, common to the EIV, e64, e6400 samplers.
