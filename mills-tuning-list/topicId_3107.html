I used to think it was obvious.  I used to think that if<br>a sound module had a pitch bend resolution of, say, 8 bits, that meant<br>that whenever it received a 14-bit pitch bend signal it used only the<br>leading 8 bits and ignored the remaining 6.  But then I did some<br>experimentation and discovered that this is far from the case.<br><br>     The experiment is straightforward and anybody can repeat it.  I<br>tested a couple of synths with similar results, but I'll describe here<br>only the results obtained with a lowly Roland Sound Canvas.  First I<br>created a little program (in Max) to make it easy to transmit one at a<br>time a series of 14-bit pitch bend signals increasing by increments of<br>one.  By repeatedly clicking the mouse I could send, say, the series<br>8192, 8193, 8194, . . . from the computer to the sound module.  Next I<br>set the Sound Canvas' pitch bend range to its maximum value of +/- 24<br>semitones.  Then I started a note playing in a sawtooth wave timbre,<br>chosen because it has lots of overtones.  By listening intently for<br>subtle overtone changes as I clicked away with the mouse, I could tell<br>when the shifts in pitch were taking place.  Why a minute change in<br>pitch should cause a discernable change in the overtone spectrum I<br>don't know, but it does.<br><br>     The pitch changes came frequently, about every 4 or 5 mouse<br>clicks.  To distinguish among that many different pitches, the Sound<br>Canvas must be extracting something over eleven bits of information<br>from the pitch bend numbers.  Not bad, I thought, for a unit that is<br>considered the MacDonald's hamburger of the synthesizer world.<br><br>     But wait.  The pitch changes occurred sometimes on an even<br>number, sometimes on an odd.  This was a surprise.  There is no way of<br>explaining it unless the sound module was somehow taking into account<br>even the very lowest-order bit of the pitch bend signal.  The usual<br>concept of pitch bend resolution, based on how many lower-order bits<br>are ignored, went out the window.  Even a Sound Canvas looks at all 14<br>bits!<br><br>     I repeated the experiment for other pitch bend ranges.  The<br>narrower the range, the more mouse clicks it took to get from one<br>pitch change to the next.  Pitch bend ranges that are powers of two<br>are special.  They produce uniformly spaced pitch changes.  For<br>example, for a range of +/- 16 semitones the pitch changes came<br>regularly at every 8th mouse click.  Here is a summary of how far<br>apart the pitch changes occurred in response to various range settings<br>that are powers of 2.  The theoretically implied number of high-order<br>bits needed is also given:<br><br>   ---------------------------------------------------<br>                    PB increments       Theoretical<br>    PB Range        between changes     bits required<br>   ===================================================<br>   +/-  1 semis    128                  7  bits<br>   +/-  2   "       64                  8   "<br>   +/-  4   "       32                  9   "<br>   +/-  8   "       16                 10   "<br>   +/- 16   "        8                 11   "</div>
