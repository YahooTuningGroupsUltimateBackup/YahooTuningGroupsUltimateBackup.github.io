I have recently <br>scoured the entire Harvard music library for every speculation and shred of <br>evidence on their tuning, for my paper on 22-tone temperament. I was pleased <br>to find some of my original speculations, such as the tempered tuning of the <br>sruti representing kakali-ni in sa-grama and antara-ga in ma-grama, to be <br>repeated by several authors and evidenced in the construction of ancient <br>instruments. I would be pleased to offer comments on your acquaintance's <br>paper. I did not respond originally because I figured someone would be more <br>of an expert in this area than I.<br><br>Paul Erlich<br>145 College Ave #2<br>Somerville, MA 02144<br><br>Now for the other issue:<br><br>>If only the 81:80 is a syntonic comma, then only the 3:2 is a (perfect)<br>>fifth. We don't restrict the latter that way; there's no reason I can see<br>>to restrict the former either. But of course it's necessary to specify<br>>whether you mean just (as in 81:80) or not. The context usually<br>>determines; in any ET, it's obvious.<br><br>NO, IT'S NOT OBVIOUS AT ALL! In any ET, we would agree that the perfect <br>fifth is the closest approximation to the 3:2. We would also agree that the <br>syntonic comma is NOT necessarily the closest approximation to the 81:80 -- <br>for example, in 22-tET the closest step size to an 81:80 is 0 steps, and yet <br>we would both call 1 step the syntonic comma. Why? Because the syntonic <br>comma is defined as interval obtained by tuning several successive CONSONANT <br>intervals. The two important definitions are as follows:<br><br>(1) Tune up three perfect fourths, down an octave, and down a minor third. <br>You are now a syntonic comma lower than where you began. In 22-tET, this is <br>1 step.<br><br>(2) Tune up four perfect fifths, down two octaves, and down a major third. <br>You are now a syntonic comma higher than where you began. In 22-tET, this is <br>1 step.<br><br>So the syntonic comma is 1 step in 22-tET, even though 0 steps would be <br>closer in size to the JI syntonic comma. This situation would never occur <br>for a basic consonace like the perfect fifth. Thus the "pseudo" terminology <br>is warranted.<br><br>Now there are tunings where (1) and (2) give different answers! For example, <br>in 21-tET, definition (1) gives a syntonic comma of 0 steps, while <br>definition (2) gives an syntonic comma of -1 (that's minus 1) steps. Another <br>example is 20-tET, where definition (1) gives a syntonic comma of 1 step, <br>while definition (2) gives a syntonic comma of 2 steps. So I would argue <br>that if an ET is not consistent within the 5-limit, the syntonic comma is <br>undefined in that tuning.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 30 Apr 1997 02:34 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00941; Wed, 30 Apr 1997 02:34:51 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00935<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id RAA13583; Tue, 29 Apr 1997 17:33:09 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 29 Apr 1997 17:33:09 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199704292150.RAA30852@phyleus.interlinx.qc.ca><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6276 href="#6276">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/1997 7:34:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Before inventing something that is already here, you may want to look at<br>>the Sanderson Accu-tuner or the Reyburn Cyber Tuner.  These are tuning<br>>specific machines, though the RCT uses a powerbook.  Unlimited temperament<br>>access, over 200 can be carried in the machine itself.  Allows all manner of<br>>partial selection, unlimited scaling curves, accuracy to .1 cent,<br>>etc...........<br><br>I found the Reyburn Cyber Tuner on the web, but I could not find the<br>Sanderson Accu-tuner.  Does anybody know where to get information on this?<br><br>>There are a number of products on the market today that provide<br>>microtonal tuning support. I have looked at the Accutone model 250,<br>>with preprogrammed scales, and a three light strobe for $400; Korg<br>>model MT-1200 wihch  can be programmed to temperments of your choice<br>>for $300; Peterson 5000, with 112 customer definable temperment files;<br>>Precision Strobe Tuner PST2, with the rotating LED's that I found<br>>useful before and programmable temperments, for $325. All of these<br>>assume that you are tuning 12 tones to the octave, but let you alter<br>>any of those 12 to any note. With a little fancy temperment switching,<br>>you can tune any number of tones to the octave with little trouble.<br><br>Am familiar with the Korg and Peterson, but have never seen teh Accutone or<br>Precision Strobe Tuner models.  Could anybody point me in the right direction?<br><br>As far as a wish list goes, the smaller, simpler, and lighter, the better.<br>Perhaps ideal would be a device without any scale template at all, just<br>entry for cents and some rotating LED's.  It is always nice to have<br>reference tones to compare the visual feedback to something you can hear.<br>In fact, it would be really cool just to have a hand-held, battery powered<br>device that only gave reference pitches (that is, had no listening<br>capability) at a given frequency in hertz.<br><br>The Violab Pitchman is such a tuner, and it can be purchased from Zuckermann<br>harpsichords at http://www.zuckermann.com/earlykeyboardnotes/pitchman.html/,<br>but it is stuck to one of several preset temperaments.  I have this tuner<br>and it is really cool.  I have corresponded with the guy who makes this<br>tuner about the idea of hertz entry, and he told me to buy a peice of lab<br>equipment from http://www.telulex.com/.  I looked into this, but eventually<br>decided that the Peterson 520 was better suited to my needs.  I have this<br>tuner and it is okay.  But, when it comes down to it, strobes have got to<br>suck.  And, big heavy boxes do not make me happy.<br><br>Carl<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Denis.Atadan@mvs.udel.edu<br>Subject:  John Starrett and Tape Swap Damage Control<br>PostedDate:  12-10-97 21:43:31<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  12-10-97 21:42:55-12-10-97 21:42:56,12-10-97 21:43:22-12-10-97 21:43:22<br>DeliveredDate:  12-10-97 21:43:22<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125652E.006C4ACA; Sun, 12 Oct 1997 21:42:50 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14335; Sun, 12 Oct 1997 21:43:31 +0200<br>Date: Sun, 12 Oct 1997 21:43:31 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14334<br>Received: (qmail 13464 invoked from network); 12 Oct 1997 12:43:27 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 12 Oct 1997 12:43:27 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199710121939.PAA10598@copland.udel.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
