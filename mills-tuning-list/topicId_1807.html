If we are in C and suppose C=256 Hz to make it<br>easy on the calculations, then we have more Cs at 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 etc<br>except that this is too low for hearing.  However 8, 4, 2, 1 Hz are<br>equivalent to tempos of 480, 240, 120 and 60 bpm.  So if a piece is<br>played in C at a tempo of 120 bpm then we can say that the tempo/rhythm<br>is IN TUNE with the key.<br><br>Because I have this idea that after every few octaves a fifth should be<br>thrown in, I consider that the frequency of the key note should be<br>either 2^n or 3*2^n times the tempo (when converted from bpm to Hz).<br>In either of these cases I would say that the composer got it right.<br><br>I had a look at a number of classical composers to see whether they did<br>this or not and found that the good composers generally did.  Some of<br>the not so good ones didn't.  Of course sometimes we are stuck with a<br>tempo in words and don't know the exact rate.<br><br>I had a look at a few modern composers.  I like Billy Joel and he writes<br>definite things like 124 bpm and leaves you with no doubt.  Well I<br>checked his pieces and they are in tune but there is a 2% to 2.5%<br>difference which would be removed if A=440 was changed to A=450.<br>So does anyone know whether he tunes his instruments to 450?  That would<br>explain things.  If not then I think that he is picking up the natural<br>earth frequencies and that A=450 is the natural rate.<br><br>If it can be accepted that having the tempo and key matching is a sign<br>of good music then it is also true that transpositions are not a good<br>practice.  If you transpose a piece up by a third then to keep the<br>balance you would need to play it 25% faster and it would sound like the<br>chipmunks!  Any chance of conveying (the right) emotions would be gone.<br><br>OK, so all shoot me down in flames again!<br><br>There is an article on WWW (link on my pages) about a similar idea.<br>That is, that chords slowed down become rhythm and that certain common<br>chords make common drum beats etc.  For example, a fifth becomes:<br><br>Low note   x     x     x     x     x<br>High note  *   *   *   *   *   *   *<br><br>Result     #   * x *   #   * x *   #<br><br>More complicated chords become more interesting beats.<br><br>-- Ray Tomes -- rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz -- Harmonics Theory --<br>http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 9 Mar 1997 16:49 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10262; Sun, 9 Mar 1997 16:49:50 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10252<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id HAA27150; Sun, 9 Mar 1997 07:47:34 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 9 Mar 1997 07:47:34 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703091045_MC2-124F-AF65@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5047 href="#5047">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/1997 12:15:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Andrew Milne wrote:<br><br>''If the 7th in a dominant 7th chord is tuned to 7/4, then it loses its<br>dissonance and instability. Indeed such a chord can function as a tonic<br>(as it does, quite exceptionally for the time, in Chopin's 22nd<br>Prelude).''<br><br>The category ''dissonance'' is, ultmately, contextual, and may not always<br>be the most useful arbitrator of musical functions. James Tenney's _A<br>History of Consonance and Dissonance_ is very useful in beginning to sort<br>out how variously such terms have been used. <br><br>The most striking characteristics of a dominant seventh chord within an<br>otherwise triadic environment are - for me - the density of the chord (a<br>triad contains three interval classes, a tetrad six)  and the appearance of<br>a new (even ''xenharmonic'') interval. These features are enhancements of<br>the dominant/tonic voice leading relationship: root movement by fifth, and<br>stepwise ''resolution'' in the remaining voices. The introduction of a<br>raised third in the minor dominant illustrates the classical emphasis on<br>acoustical contrast between the chords.  When a dominant seventh chord is<br>suspended for a classical cadenza, it suffers little when tuned as 4:5:6:7<br>and indeed, the stability of the chord enhances its contrast with the tonic<br>triad. On the other hand, the suspension of a 16/9 (or 9/5) as the seventh<br>introduces a tone dissonant to the rest of the chord, but not foreign to<br>the scale. <br><br>One often-raised objection to the septimal tuning is the narrow semitone<br>(21/20) voice leading from the seventh to the third of the tonic. I find<br>this line of argumentation more compelling, but the interval itself is not<br>difficult to sing - and if melodically ''strange'', it does maximize the<br>contrast function.<br><br>Readers might have some fun investigating the traditional rule of thumb for<br>the relative density of the chords in V7 - I cadences: In four voices, if<br>the voice leading is correct, then one of the two chords has to be<br>incomplete (that is with a doubled pc). (Why this should be so I will leave<br>as a kind of ''Puzzler'').<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 11 Mar 1997 10:48 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01762; Tue, 11 Mar 1997 10:48:26 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01760<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id BAA06874; Tue, 11 Mar 1997 01:46:33 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 11 Mar 1997 01:46:33 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.91.970311012614.1350B-100000@si.UCSC.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5082 href="#5082">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MorriSonics@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/1997 10:06:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>-------------------- Begin Original Message --------------------<br><br>Message text written by INTERNET:tuning@ella.mills.edu<br><br>"The category ''dissonance'' is, ultmately, contextual, and may not always<br>be the most useful arbitrator of musical functions.
