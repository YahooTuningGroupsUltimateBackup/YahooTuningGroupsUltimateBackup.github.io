A strict finitist might very well not accept arbitrary<br>transposition downward, while most will be satisfied that transposing thefundmental downward until octave multiples of all the desired tones fall<br>within a given range is unobjectionable, even if the fundmental becomes so<br>low as to be a completely theoretical entity.<br><br>It is interesting to look at examples of systems where the octave is not<br>the basic building block but rather the fifth or another interval.<br>Classical harmonics used conjunct tetrachords and pentachords as well as<br>the octave-filling disjunct tetrachords. Xenakis suggested reviving this<br>technique. One way of hearing the three javanese slendro pathet is as<br>conjunct pentatonic tetrachords (each with four tones encompassing an<br>approximate acoustical fifth). A lot of melodies from very different<br>repertoires might be usefully analysed in these terms, where formal unitsare defined by the range of a fifth.

The<br>point of using circles (spirals, whatever) of fifths to construct a tuning<br>is one of several means of lending consistency to a tuning system,<br>especially consistency across many keys.  The point that matters is that a<br>tuning like meantone that is based upon a stack of fifths will always have<br>a consistent-sized fifth, which makes where you start unimportant.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 12 Jun 1997 15:23 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08843; Thu, 12 Jun 1997 15:23:03 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 12 Jun 1997 15:23:03 +0200<br>Message-Id: <9706121323.AA08843@ns.ezh.nl><br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08838<br>Received: (qmail 159 invoked from network); 12 Jun 1997 13:22:51 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 12 Jun 1997 13:22:51 -0000<br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5637 href="#5637">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>6/14/1997 3:32:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>It is interesting to look at examples of systems where the octave is not<br>>the basic building block but rather the fifth or another interval.<br><br>   The 88CET system I keep droning on and on about is such a system, as is<br>Carlos' Alpha.  88CET has 8 steps per P5, and Alpha has 9 per P5.
