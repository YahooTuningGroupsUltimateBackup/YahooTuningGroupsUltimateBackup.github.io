I visited their site at<br>http://www.afn.org/~sejic and found these comments: "JUST INTONATION is<br>a musical term. It is the practice of tuning musical intervals by means<br>of whole-number ratios of frequencies. This allows the production of<br>chords and scales which are more resonant and have finer resolution than<br><br>those produced in the more common, equal tempered tuning system. This is<br><br>the natural tendency of singers, string players and any other musician<br>who is not bound by the confines of frets or keys that force the use of<br>non-just intervals. It is therefore the starting place from which all<br>indigenous musical traditions began." [Italics mine].  I am wondering<br>whether Denny or any other contributor to this list would be interested<br>in providing evidence for these last statements, as they apply to all<br>musicians in all societies at all times, from the beginning of human<br>(and animal?) history.
