Ptolemy provides us with a version of <br>the enharmonic tetrachord from five different theorists, including <br>himself (Bk.II, sect.14). Of the four who give ratio descriptions, <br>Archytas, Didymus and Ptolemy all agree on 5/4 for the large interval; <br>only Eratosthenes differs by giving 19/15 instead. This leaves only <br>Aristoxenus, who gives us a large interval of 24 parts (out of 30 for <br>the 4/3).<br><br>How are we to interpret Aristoxenus in ratio terms? If we call our <br>Aristoxenean measure "A", we can use the formula<br><br>                exp(Aln(4/3)/30)<br><br>and then find the first few convergents of the continued fraction <br>expression of the result. In the case of A 24, the third convergent <br>is 5/4 (the fourth is 34/27). If this is indeed Aristoxenus's <br>interval, then the remaining pyknon of 16/15 is divided equally into 3 <br>+3 parts. This would yield a tetrachord that is perceptually <br>indistinguishable from the enharmonic of Didymus, who is clearly <br>aiming for near-equal division of the pyknon (31/30 and 32/31 <br>descending), while Archytas and Ptolemy both choose to divide the <br>pyknon unequally. We have good reason then to identify the enharmonic <br>of Aristoxenus with that of Didymus.<br><br>What of Eratosthenes then? Let's take him seriously in his own right <br>for a moment, rather than as a mere misinterpreter of Aristoxenus. As <br>it happens, his ratio of 19/15 is in fact one cent closer to 24 <br>Aristoxenean units (if they are interpreted as a 30-fold equal <br>division of the 4/3). 24 parts is about 398 cents; 5/4 is about 12 <br>cents smaller, while 19/15 is about 11 cents higher. I have no idea <br>how Eratosthenes made his calculation, but clearly he didn't use <br>logarithms and convergents, nor could he extract the 30th root of 4/3. <br>Nevertheless, 19/15 would seem considerably harder to arrive at for <br>lyra and kithara players, and it never reappears except under <br>Eratosthenes' name. Given that three out of our four sources for the <br>enharmonic agree on 5/4, I would suggest that the balance is in favour <br>of this ratio, rather than 5/4.<br><br>The only further option is to take 81/64 -- the ditone -- as <br>Aristoxenus's intended interval. At this point, I'll confess that I've <br>been disingenuous in the above two paragraphs, since I don't believe <br>for a moment that Aristoxenus's 30 parts of a 4/3 allow anything like <br>such precision. The ditone is in fact Aristoxenus's own _stated_ <br>preference for the large interval of the enharmonic tetrachord, and he <br>laments that the trend in his time was in favour of a more intense <br>tuning, which "sweetened" the ditone (clearly the 5/4 of the other <br>theorists -- see El. Harm. 23, 12ff.). For what it's worth, then, how <br>close does the ditone come to the cents measurement of 24 parts of <br>(4/3)^(1/30) each? The improvement on 19/15 is only one cent more. <br>This should give us a good idea of the margins of vagueness and <br>precision within which we should Aristoxenus's figures. Archytas was a <br>near predecessor of Aristoxenus, or an older contemporary, and he, as <br>we have seen, was already content to give 5/4 as the width of the <br>large interval, so the trend was already well under way some time <br>before Aristoxenus wrote; we might even speculate that Aristoxenus was <br>stating his preference for a practice that had died out by the time he <br>wrote. Whatever the case may be, Barker argues persuasively that <br>neither Aristoxenus nor Archytas convinced themselves of the relative <br>sizes of ditone and 5/4 by means of the monochord (a method which <br>would hardly have claimed much of Aristoxenus's time!) nor by <br>listening alone, but rather by observation: they would have seen <br>players tune their string by fourths and fifths to arrive at the <br>ditone, after which they would have noticed the players tighten the <br>string until the "sweetness" of the interval between that string and <br>its higher neighbour satisfied them.<br><br>> Frankly, I'm somewhat suspicious of Ptolemy's enharmonic and <br>> chromatic genera as they have a rough 1:2 division of the pyknon <br>> (Barbera), even if  it meant that he had to reorder the intervals <br>> resulting from "katapyknosis" to obtain usable superparticular <br>> ratios. But, I do agree that the kithara and lyra tunings probably .<br>> represent practice<br><br>I don't see that there is any more reason to doubt Ptolemy's <br>pyknomatic tetrachordal divisions than there is to doubt his kithara <br>and lyra tunings. Of course players would not have been able to intuit <br>the sizes of Ptolemy's ratios within the pyknon, but nor would they <br>have been able to intuit the ratios of any of the other theorists <br>either. No, what leads me to believe that Ptolemy's enharmonic and <br>chromatic divisions were trustworthy as a description of contemporary <br>practice (though perhaps not earlier) is the peculiar and awkard <br>method he devises for calculating how the pyknon was to be divided. <br>This has nothing to do with the constraint of finding superparticular <br>ratios, since the tunings Ptolemy takes issue with -- the enharmonics <br>of Archytas, Eratosthenes and Didymus, and the chromatics of <br>Eratosthenes and Didymus -- all remain within these constraints (only <br>Archytas's chromatic contains an epimeric ratio). Rather, he has <br>devised the method to arrive at a result which gives a higher interval <br>that is noticeably larger than the lower, indeed, as John Chalmers <br>says, about twice as large as the lower interval. He criticises <br>Archytas for reversing the order of large and small in both enharmonic <br>and chromatic, and Didymus for the same offence in his chromatic. The <br>only plausible explanation would seem to be that Ptolemy heard such <br>divisions of the pyknon practised by players; his task, based on this <br>perception, was to find the method of generating superparticular <br>ratios that best reflected this perception.<br><br>-- <br>Jonathan Walker<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 28 Feb 1997 09:38 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA32745; Fri, 28 Feb 1997 09:38:49 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA32732<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id AAA11631; Fri, 28 Feb 1997 00:37:01 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 28 Feb 1997 00:37:01 -0800<br>Message-Id: <33209164.125761749@kcbbs.gen.nz><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4928 href="#4928">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/1997 5:07:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Ray: have you read "The Year of the Jackpot" by Heinlein?

The<br>pattern is characterised by many ratios of 2, lots of ratios of 3 and<br>lesser still of 5 and 7.  Although the other primes do appear as ratios<br>they do so very seldom.<br><br>Also, as we move up the harmonics scale we find that the key keeps<br>changing.  After every 2 or 3 ratios of 2 (2.38 on average) the key<br>shifts by a ratio of 3 and so that means that every about every 4<br>octaves (including the 2.38 and 1.585 from the 3) there is a shift to<br>the dominant.  At still larger intervals there is a key shift by a major<br>third.
