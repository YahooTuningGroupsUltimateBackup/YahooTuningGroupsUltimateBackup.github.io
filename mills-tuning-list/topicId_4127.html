In addition, in just<br>intonation, the "major third" formed by eight fourths is more<br>acoustically consonant than that formed by four fifths, since the former<br>is only 2 cents off a just 5:4 while the latter is 21.5 cents off.<br>However, musical context would still have to determine whether the<br>acoustical consonance could translate into musical consonance.<br><br>An obvious problem with Lucy's definition is that you can get<br>arbitrarily close to any interval if you are allowed an unlimited number<br>of fifths (whether these are just fifths, Lucy fifths, or any other<br>irrational fraction of an octave). So there will be very large numbers<br>of fifths which result in very consonant intervals. For example, 666<br>just fifths lead to a frequency ratio of 1.50007, or 702.03 cents. Even<br>musical context would not help to distinguish between this and 1 just<br>fifth, which is a frequency ratio of 1.5 or 701.96 cents. Lucy's own<br>tempered fifth is 695.49 cents, while 52 just fourths produce an<br>interval of 698.34 cents, and 89 Lucy fifths produce an interval of<br>698.87 cents, both clearly more consonant.</div>
