It's<br>> just a lot easier to tune a synth than a piano or guitar.<br><br>Easier?????? to what precision????<br>><br>> See Charles Lucy's site for a techo-ish band ostensibly using Harrison/Lucy<br>> tuning.  On the one hand, it sounds a little different than it would in<br>> 12-tET; on the other, I think it could have been written in 12-tET so it<br>> doesn't really seem to show the uniqueness of the tuning.  It's a start,<br>> though.<br><br>Thanks for your enthusiasm David.<br>In the morning, we shall be flying out from Hawaii to London to do just that<br>----- produce some more commercial music. I shall be working with James<br>Sanger (arc-angel), and again we should be using a combination of acoustic<br>and sampled/electronic audio to produce LucyTuned music.<br>Certainly some of the LucyTuned Lullabies may have been written in 12tET;<br>they are so "old" that who knows how their tunings originated. Sung?<br><br>Everything James writes (usually on guitar) is sure to be LucyTuned.<br>All his guitars are LucyFretted, and he has playing that way more<br>than ten years now. James is left-handed, and all his guitars have<br>had to be custom-built or modified.<br>Many of the sounds that we have used are produced acoustically or with<br>electric LT guitars and effects; the problem which we have constantly<br>encountered has been pitch resolution on pitch-changed samples.<br><br>It has sometimes been necessary to make seperate samples of each note to<br>improve the limitations of current technology.<br><br>(Suggestions for better tuning precision methods are welcomed)<br><br>Referring back to the posting about MIDI pitchbend, I have used pitchbend,<br>with one note per channel for many years, yet have never been satisfied<br>with only 64ths of a semitone. Such crude resolution results in beating<br>"mish-mash" compared to what can be produced with guitars or other<br>acoustically based instruments.<br><br>This is another call for tuning enthusiasts to "PLEASE NAG THE<br>MANUFACTURERS to implement the MIDI TUNING DUMP!!!!!! on new gear."<br><br>I have put some new gif diagrams (forgive my HTML) at:<br><br>http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy<br><br>This site also has links to WIO from Tokyo, and from there to arc-angel,<br>in UK, where you can hear some of James's older tracks [including bits of<br>his celebrated - "Spikey Message"].<br><br><br>lucy@hour.com<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net<br>Subject:  Re: Software setup<br>PostedDate:  15-09-97 16:00:30<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  15-09-97 16:00:20-15-09-97 16:00:21,15-09-97 15:59:38-15-09-97 15:59:39<br>DeliveredDate:  15-09-97 15:59:39<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256513.004CEE9E; Mon, 15 Sep 1997 16:00:18 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01726; Mon, 15 Sep 1997 16:00:30 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 15 Sep 1997 16:00:30 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01716<br>Received: (qmail 3694 invoked from network); 15 Sep 1997 14:00:21 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 15 Sep 1997 14:00:21 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541100b04339d96e4a@DialupEudora><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
