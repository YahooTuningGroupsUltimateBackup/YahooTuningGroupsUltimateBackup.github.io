Is this chord a modern invention?  It seems<br>>to me that such a thing is impossible in anything but equal temperament.<br>>I'm having a hard time getting acceptable diminished chords out of my E9<br>>pedal steel using the standard JI tuned pedals.  I know I could tune a pedal<br>>specifically for these chords, but that's really an awkward solution.<br>>Comments?<br><br>My thoughts are based on these two assumptions:<br><br>1) If you want to avoid "preparing" your instrument by altering it normal<br>tuning, you should stay with "5 limit" just intonation.  Your Nashville E9th<br>pedal steel tuning chart, at<br>http://www.wco.com/~quasar/articles/just_e9.html, uses 5-limit ratios, even<br>with the compensators.<br><br>2) The tuning of diminished chords depends on the subsequent chord.<br><br>For purpose of discussion, suppose you're basically in the key of E, so<br>you're heading for an E major chord.  Here's your E triad (4:5:6):<br>        E:      E (1/1)         G# (5/4)        B (3/4)<br><br>Here's a possibility for tuning a D# diminished triad (45:54:64=5:6:4*16/9):<br>        D#dim:  D# (15/8)       F# (9/8)        A (4/3)<br><br>You can get it by taking the top three notes of a B7 chord<br>(36:45:54:64)=(4:5:6:4*16/9):<br>        B7:     B (3/4)         D# (15/8)       F# (9/8)        A (4/3)<br><br>To replace a B7 with a C full diminished seventh, you could raise the B by a<br>"leading tone" ratio (16/15), arriving at this<br>(192:225:270:320)=(4*16/15:5:6:4*16/9):<br>        Cdim7:  C (4/5)         D# (15/8)       F# (9/8)        A (4/3)<br><br>But there's no C on your tuning chart.  Suppose you transpose the whole<br>thing up a fifth (to get F#7 with the F# raised to a G):<br>        Gdim7:  G (3/5=6/5)     A# (45/32)      C# (27/32)      E (1/1)<br><br>Now the C# (27/32) is not on the instrument.  The only C# on the chart is 5/6.<br><br>No matter where you transpose to, it turns out you'll always be missing one<br>of the four notes.  Here missing notes are shown in square brackets ([]),<br>and "FX" is "F double sharp":<br>        Cdim7: [C (4/5)]        D# (15/8)       F# (9/8)        A (4/3)<br>        Edim7:  E (1/1)        [FX (75/64)]     A# (45/32)      C# (5/6)<br>        Gdim7:  G (6/5)         A# (45/32)     [C# (27/32)]     E (1/1)<br><br>The rarest of the necessary intervals on the instrument is 75/64, as it<br>appears only at G (6/5) - A# (45/32).<br><br>Perhaps the best solution is to leave out one of the four notes, depending<br>on which ones are available at the time.  Or get an instrument with even<br>more strings and pedals - But it'll start looking like a harp!<br><br>Good luck!<br>--Mark<br>+------------------------------------------------------+<br>| Mark Nowitzky                                        |<br>| email:  nowitzky@pacificnet.net                      |<br>| www:    http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky          |<br>|         "If you haven't visited Mark Nowitzky's home |<br>|         page recently, you haven't missed much..."   |<br>+------------------------------------------------------+</div><h3><a id=7301 href="#7301">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>3/25/1998 1:54:48 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Yes, CDs<br>--------<br><br>   You might be asking, why CDs?  Why not just use plain, simple cassette<br>tapes?  Clearly audio-quality isn't the reason;  after all, it's mostly<br>just narration.  Why did I spent $50 to get each of three DAT masters<br>transferred to "one-off" CDs (more properly called "CDRs" - those green,<br>recordable jobbies)?  The answer is one very important word:<br><br>                              * CONTROL *<br><br>Just like working out in the gym, you need control over how you flex those<br>ear muscles!  As you know, CDs do track-seeking, and that lets you do very<br>important things like:<br><br>*  Jump immediately straight to, say, leap-destination  identification<br>   exercises, if that's what I need practice in at the moment.<br><br>*  With the press of a single button, immediately jump back to the<br>   beginning of a series of exercises, if after doing them all I'm<br>   concerned that I didn't really get them down well enough.<br><br>*  Jump past a section if it's just proving too easy (then again,<br>   next time it might turn out exactly the opposite!).<br><br>*  Put it on "shuffle" (random) play to cause me to switch off between<br>   skills less predictably.<br><br>   Let me also point out that typical cassette track-seek mechanisms won't<br>work for this.  They search for a few seconds of silence between a blocks<br>of a few minutes of mostly continuous sound.  These CDs consist almost<br>entirely gaps of silence.  A cassette track-search mechanism stops at every<br>one of those gaps of silence, rendering it useless.<br><br>   Believe me;  CDRs are almost ideal for personalized ear training practice!<br><br>   Also, CDR transfers are probably cheaper now.  Lord knows the technology<br>to do them certainly is!  In the three years since I did my 88CET<br>ear-training CDs, the cost of the equipment to do those CDR transfers<br>(using a PC) has dropped to about what just those three CDR transfers alone<br>cost me!</div>
