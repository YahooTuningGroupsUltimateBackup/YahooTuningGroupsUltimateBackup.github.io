I did<br>> have some quarter-tone pieces of mine performed years ago when I was at<br>> the Royal College, and still shudder when I recall overhearing someone in<br>> the audience ask his neighbour, 'Have they finished tuning up yet?' (As a<br>> matter of fact _I_ wasn't sure whether they had or not.)<br><br>hi there,<br><br>your experience sounds similar to mine!<br><br>i've been composing both in 12ET and 19TET for a while.  i always have to<br>go through a short adjustment period ( a few minutes) when i go from one to the<br>other.  today, i did a (non-rigorous) experiment where i took a 19TET piece,<br>and forced my office mate to listen to it for a few times.  at first, she shook<br>her head and said "this just sounds so out of tune to me", but after about 5 or<br>6 listens, she said "oh...hey...this is falling into place".  then, i had her<br>play her favorite CD (a 12TET piece), and she just "tripped".  it took her a<br>few listens to get back into 12TET mode.  at this point, my non-microtonalist<br>friend became convinced about how arbitrary tuning systems are.<br><br>i don't have a biliography for this.  ;-)<br><br>my opinion is that it will take a while for people to get into alternate<br>tunings on a global scale...the hardest part is to convince them to listen to<br>new pieces many times.  i'm pretty optimistic though.<br><br>marcus<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 22 Jul 1996 23:05 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id OAA22315; Mon, 22 Jul 1996 14:05:36 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 22 Jul 1996 14:05:36 -0700<br>Message-Id: <31F3EBB7.7541@adnc.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3294 href="#3294">ðŸ”—</a>alves@osiris.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)</h3><span>7/22/1996 2:31:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Jonathan M.

To this end, the AFMM presented Danlee Mitchell intoning Li Po <br>with Doug Laurent in 1984, as well as as the 2 Studies on Ancient Greek <br>Scales by Dean Drummond and Stefani Starin.  (If I'm disappointed by the <br>unfair playing field, it should be understandable to the fair minded.)<br><br>When I performed the 2 Studies for guitar and bassoon the New York Times <br>said:  "His "Two Studies on Ancient Greek Scales," played here by Mr. <br>Reinhard and Mr. Catler, occupied a beautifully colored, static, almost <br>incantatory world."  When I sent the tape to Mr. Mitchell, he wrote that <br>our performance was ghastly..."a mixture of elephants and giraffes at a <br>watering hole."  <br><br>> <br>> Oh.  Danlee was wrong to have ever agreed (if he did) to the synth.  I'll drive over <br>> and slap him this afternoon.<br>>  <br>> > Dean's regular performance of 2 Studies on Ancient <br>> > Greek Scales for zoomoozophone and flute, and its recording on CD - <br>> > contrary to Danlee and company - belies the fury that keeps Partch under <br>> > wraps, unless it is by the blessed few who worked with Partch directly.<br>> <br>> I also disagree with Dean using non-Partch instruments for the studies, but here is <br>> that little disclaimer: Harry *excepted* his little studies from the rigor that he <br>> imposed on his 'real' works; please see Partch's "These two ideas..." quote in my <br>> Part One reply.  You see, this isn't my idea, it's Harry's.  And while I wish Dean <br>> would do them with the real instruments (maybe he does now...), the fact of the <br>> matter is that these are JUST STUDIES, little pieces for Partch's investigation into <br>> tunings.  They aren't the masterworks.<br><br>The Partch music that the AFMM Ensemble performs is the material that <br>either had never been played before, or not in NYC for decades.  This <br>includes: "Ulysees Departs" in the original version with boobams, trumpet <br>and double bass, Version 2 of US Highball and Barstow, December 1942, Li <br>Po, Dark Brother, Yankee Doodle Fantasy.  Bach's 2 part works are <br>masterworks, why not Partch?<br><br>> > Non-corporeal performances by Mr. Mitchell at Lincoln Center flies in the <br>> > face of further criticisms.  <br>> <br>> True.  I can only think of one other instance where we did a non-corporeal <br>> performance of a piece, that being a concert version of "The Bewitched" in Cologne <br>> in 1981.  In both cases, they were extensions of full-scale staged productions of <br>> the work (Bewitched at Berlin New Music Festival, Revelation at American Music <br>> Theatre Festival); the Bewitched being a live-concert broadcast for West German (my, <br>> how times change...) Radio.  To single out one or two concerts out of the dozens I <br>> have known about seems, well...  But, the point is well taken: do not perform Partch <br>> non-corporeally.<br><br>Like any listener, I was reacting to my experiences.  I missed the <br>non-corporeal performance in Lincoln Center of Revelation, but I saw the <br>full production in Philadelphia.  The instruments were hidden behind the <br>action, they didn't move, and they were poorly amplified.  Dean Drummmond <br>has greatly improved the Partch experiences I have had since listening in <br>the NYC area, and gradually so as might be expected.<br> <br>> > And the value of the synthesizer (which was unavailable to Partch) in<br>> > performing "all the notes written" by the composer for his music adds an<br>> > improved dimension - if only the music was listened to, rather than talked<br>> > about.<br>> <br>> Partch's music is not to be simply listened to, but seen, felt and experienced.  <br>> Promoting anything less, except in a desire to 'document' a performance, is a <br>> cheapening of the work itself.  Go find another composer - there are lot's of them.<br><br>Exactly, I invite you to see, feel and experience our AFMM Ensemble <br>performances of Partch's music, perhaps when we tour through California <br>during the MIcrotonalLENNIUM.<br><br>> > territoriality and protectionism.

As before, Partch isn't just "a composer in this country".  Not better, but <br>> radically different, engendering a completely different set of circumstances, both <br>> when he lived and now.  Thanks for the compliment; now, maybe if Ted Mook can get <br>> Yo-Yo Ma, in spite of his "territoriality and protectionism", to release his <br>> Stradivarius cello for Ted's use, we can get a mondo-cool version of "Li Po".  <br>> Yo-Yo, that selfish SOB.  And it seems the Partch folks aren't the only group Johnny <br>> has had trouble with.  Remember, I don't know JR, but have offered to correspond <br>> with him.<br><br>Jon and I are corresponding separately.  I have great respect for his <br>playing skills having heard him in San Diego, though he didn't remember.  <br>Is Yo-Yo Ma a selfish SOB...I wouldn't know.  I hope there is no <br>inference here about "troublesomeness."  I mentioned difficulty with the <br>Ives Society because there is always difficulties, or almost always, with <br>the inheritors of composers - often in the form of socities (e.g. Varese, <br>Wyschnegradsky, Sandberg, Ives, etc.)  The difficutly I had with the Ives <br>Society was that they did not believe that anyone on the outside could <br>finish sections B and C of what turned out to be a 74 minute work.  <br>Thankfully, their resident musicolgoist found the score admirable and <br>there were no other difficulties.  Please don't read into my comments any <br>deeper than I've explained. <br><br>> I'll close with a final thought.  I am not here to say "You are a good person", "You <br>> are a bad person"; I am offering my thoughts, having performed the literature, <br>> worked with Harry Partch and spent a good deal of my life helping to spread the <br>> amazing World of HP and his creations.  It bothers me to see phrases such as<br>> <br>>   "a guitar "better" than Partch could hope for"<br><br>Jon Catler's 13-limit stratocaster is better than Parch could hope for.  <br>Please note that Partch discontinued useage of the guitar in his later <br>music.  Listen to Jon play US Highball version 2 and you feel the train, <br>as with Joshua Pierce performing on the synthesized chromolodeon.  <br>Partch's guitars were poor instruments.  No need to romanticize them.<br><br>>   "Drummond's hoarding of the instruments"<br><br>I asked to fix broken instruments, not to borrow a Stradivarious.  Dean <br>told me by telephone "You couldn't afford to rent them."<br><br><br>>   "monopoly on his instruments"<br><br>I think this is increasingly clear.<br><br><br>>   "territoriality and protectionism"<br><br>These terms apply to many who feel they hold something of value and want <br>to retain the power of its use.  It is a natural human tendency, if <br>unfortunate.<br>   <br>I think it necessary to speak out on this issue because it is in the <br>news, notably the British Harry Partch Newsletter.  Look to their review <br>of our Swiss radio broadcast in a coming issue.  I look to the British to <br>have a fair perspective.  Remember, in this country Charles Ives is still <br>an "amateur" and Harry Partch, well you know.<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>reinhard@styx.ios.com<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 23 Jul 1996 16:33 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA06460; Tue, 23 Jul 1996 07:33:04 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 23 Jul 1996 07:33:04 -0700<br>Message-Id: <31960723143013/0005695065PK3EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3342 href="#3342">ðŸ”—</a>jpff@maths.bath.ac.uk</h3><span>7/30/1996 3:59:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Message written at 29 Jul 1996 20:34:49 +0100<br>In-reply-to: <31F3EBB7.7541@adnc.com> (jszanto@adnc.com)<br><br>I think I am beginning to understand why I had never heard of Partch<br>until recently, and still never heard any of his music!<br>==John ff<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 30 Jul 1996 15:17 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id GAA24687; Tue, 30 Jul 1996 06:17:40 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 30 Jul 1996 06:17:40 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SV4.3.91.960730222807.17024A-100000@adelaide.DIALix.oz.au><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
