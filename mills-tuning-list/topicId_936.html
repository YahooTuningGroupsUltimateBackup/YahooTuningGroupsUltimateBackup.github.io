It will<br>be given by Guerino Mazzola, from the University of Zurich,<br>who is acknowledged as one of the worlds leading authorities<br>in this field.  Mazzola's book "The Geometry of Tones,"<br>(Birkhauser Press) was recognized immediately as a major advance<br>in our understanding of music. It is a complex argument<br>involving several theorems as well as analyses of works such<br>as Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata.<br><br>In addition, Mazzola has created powerful computer software<br>for analysis and performance of music - that is available<br>on the Internet.  Also, Mazzola's composition sequencer<br>software was recommended for commercial production by<br>Herbert von Karajan.<br><br>Besides being an advanced mathematician and computer<br>scientist, Mazzola is a frequently recorded jazz musician<br>with a discography of several albums and CD's.  He will<br>be visiting the United States this October to cut another CD.<br><br>The Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science and the Center for<br>Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science is sponsoring<br>a day-long course on Mathematical Music Theory from Mazzola.<br>Besides his lectures, Mazzola will demonstrate the remarkable<br>music composition and analysis software called RUBATO.<br>This is a great opportunity to meet and talk with this<br>remarkable person.<br><br>The course is free to all members of the public.<br><br><br>                GUERINO MAZZOLA<br><br>              Dept of Mathematics<br>              University of Zurich<br><br>TITLE:<br>Theory and Hypermedia for Big Science in Musicology<br><br>ABSTRACT:<br>Based on modern information technology, mathematics and semiotics,<br>SYSTEMATIC MUSICOLOGY has fundamentally changed. As a theoretical<br>basis of this change, mathematical music theory offers a precise<br>language and models to describe  musicological facts. It is based<br>on three factors (1) symmetry, (2) local-global gestalts and<br>(3) the Yoneda classification by "variation of perspectives".<br>Hypermedia implementation of the theory is an integral<br>part of these significant developments. It turns out that<br>the representation and control of music's inhomogeneous and<br>semantically open data, make music a prototypical research<br>subject asking for Big Science effort and funding in the Humanities.<br><br>We explain these developments by presenting the theory, and the<br>computer analysis and performance platform, RUBATO(R), that has been<br>developed at the Multimedia Lab of Zurich University. RUBATO consists<br>of (1) a framework software, (2) three modules for rhythmical, melodic,<br>and harmonic analysis, (3) one module for shaping performances, and<br>(4) one module for sight-reading, (5) five modules for creating<br>performances. RUBATO is not only  an powerful research tool,<br>its concepts and architectural constructs yield fundamental insight<br>into the rational bases of performance. We report, for example,<br>on the highly significant relations between RUBATO's analyses<br>of Schumann's Kinderszene Nr.7 "Traeumerei" and the timings of<br>famous pianists. Comparison of Argerich's and Horowitz' recordings<br>on the basis of RUBATO's genealogical performance model yield new<br>approaches to comparative criticism.<br><br>Our talk includes video and audio tapes/CD to illustate the software.<br><br><br>Time:  Saturday Oct 26th,<br>       10am-5pm with breaks to meet other attendees<br>       and exchange information on music composition,<br>       performance, music software, etc.<br><br>Location: Voorhees Hall, Room 105<br>          College Ave Campus, New Brunswick.<br>          Voorhees Hall is within easy walking distance<br>          from the New Brunswick Railway Station.<br>          It can also be easily reached from the main<br>          New Jersey freeways, such as the NJ Turnpike.<br>          TO RECEIVE A MAP AND TRAVEL INFORMATION,<br>          CONTACT TRISH BY EMAIL, PHONE OR FAX, AS BELOW:<br><br>Contact: Trish Anderson<br><br>         e-mail: trish@ruccs.rutgers.edu<br>         phone:  (908) 445-0635<br>         fax:    (908) 445-0634<br><br>Organizer:  Prof Michael Leyton<br>            e-mail: leyton@ruccs.rutgers.edu<br>            Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science<br><br><br>Speaker:    Guerino Mazzola<br>            e-mail: gbm@presto.pr.net.ch<br><br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 27 Sep 1996 09:50 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00057; Fri, 27 Sep 1996 09:50:35 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01165<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id AAA28247; Fri, 27 Sep 1996 00:50:32 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 27 Sep 1996 00:50:32 -0700<br>Message-Id: <9609270751.AA04558@arthaud.saclay.cea.fr><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
