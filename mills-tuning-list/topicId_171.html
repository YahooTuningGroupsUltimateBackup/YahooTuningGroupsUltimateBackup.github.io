It should be a good scale for piano <br>> music which sounds convincing yet distinctly xenharmonic.<br><br>Your scale is not that "wild" and only adds a couple of harmonics to a more <br>consonant resolution to 12ET.  Objectivity is lost on 12ET-fretted minds <br>that are the result of a lifetime of indoctrination.<br><br>> Of course it is nice to write for an ensemble, but when it comes to <br>> analyzing a tuning purely, a solo keyboard may be ideal. Adding <br>> instruments, especially ones without fixed-pitch,  would muddy up the sound <br>> and act as a "cover" for hearing the true relationships.  <br><br>If you have the conviction of hearing the exact intervals so can any <br>professional musician.  If your mind is "muddy" than clear it up.  The <br>piano and most electronic timbres are inharmonic, muddying up just <br>relationships.  And on the piano, what with the artificial node creating <br>a blank space due to the striking hammer, and the bad odds regarding 3 <br>wires under tremendous tension being exactly in tune...  From where I <br>stand keyboards are extremely limited regarding musical expression.  They <br>are only a short term fix, except in the hand of extremely talented <br>individuals.  There is no reason to believe - at least in theory - that a <br>non-keyboard musician that can hear intervals in their head before <br>playing them aloud makes an inferior microtonal statement.  And besides, <br>music is music and need not aim for "xenharmonic" shock value.<br><br>I also find <br>> that the more action is involved (varied instruments, harmonic motion, <br>> etc.), the less xenharmonic a piece sounds.  This is taken from comments <br>> of non-JI musicians who I have listen to it.<br><br>About 13 years ago I had the opportunity to ask advice about a similar <br>problem from the late Issic Asimov.  I had just performed on electric <br>bassoon with Jon Catler and The Microtones at The Other End in Greenwich <br>Village - the whole set in 31-tone ET.  6 ethnomusicolgist grad students <br>that were my colleagues at the time from Columbia University swore that <br>they couldn't hear any microtones in our playing.  (This did not give me <br>much faith in their ears.)<br><br>After a Barnard College lecture on the future, Mr. Asimov responded to my <br>frustration at my colleagues.  "Firstly, you are ahead of your time and <br>can't expect people to understand what you are doing.  And secondly, keep <br>calm about it and be patient with them for in time they will come around.<br><br> > A couple of questions:<br>> -Who is "Twinings"?
