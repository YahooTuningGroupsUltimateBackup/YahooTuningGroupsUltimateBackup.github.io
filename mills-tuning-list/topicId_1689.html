There is a difference. My comments are meaningless <br>with respect to a "relations between the fundamental and other members of <br>the harmonic series" viewpoint, but they do apply to a "small-integer-ratio" <br>viewpoint. So why your comment above (first quote above)?<br><br>By the way, the difference between the two viewpoints leads to two different <br>JI lattice constructions. The RBFAOMOHS view leads to rectangular lattices, <br>while the SIR viewpoint leads to triangular lattices. Exploring the <br>relationship between these views in 5-dimensional lattices led me to some <br>interesting discoveries about the tiling of 5-dimensional space with regular <br>hyperpolyhedra (which happen to be various Wilson CPSs from [1,3,5,7,11]).<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 24 Feb 1997 18:49 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17776; Mon, 24 Feb 1997 18:49:41 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA17772<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id JAA10291; Mon, 24 Feb 1997 09:47:37 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 24 Feb 1997 09:47:37 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B060B13FE003D.3465@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
