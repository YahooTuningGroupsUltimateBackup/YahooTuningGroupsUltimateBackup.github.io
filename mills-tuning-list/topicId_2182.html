You can equally well say that 1, 3 and 9 mix<br>without making the wavelength any longer but that putting a 2 in there<br>results in it being longer.  It is the mix of primes that does.<br><br>I think that the reason that a ratio of 2 is more fundamental than any<br>other is that 2 is a smaller number than any other (OK 1 is better!).<br>In my opinion the simplicity of a prime ratio is inversely proportional<br>to p*ln(p) where p is the prime.

The octave is relevant.<br><br>>Aliquot parts are simply a list of all the possible numbers that<br>>can be derived by multiplying subsets of the prime factors of a<br>>given number.
