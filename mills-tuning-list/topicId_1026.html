As it currently<br>stands, we still need to drop in the regulation FCC station IDs, which we'll<br>do in between the CDs which comprise the original Gramavision CD release.<br><br>It ought to be fun. With that broadcast as an opener, the follow-on program<br>of other music outside of 12TET will happen a couple of weeks later. Onward.<br><br>_<br>I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,<br>paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only<br>maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it.
