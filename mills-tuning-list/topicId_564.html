Of course, four of these intervals are 0 cents. So Partch most <br>likely did get the idea from Meyer, but he rotated it 90 degrees <br>counterclockwise.<br><br>Someone said in effect that Meyer's system of using numbers rather that <br>ratios limited him to a small subset of just scales. This is not the case. <br>Meyer explicitly ignores powers of 2, and multiplies all ratios by whatever <br>factor is necessary to leave only powers of two in the denominator. This is <br>no different from Brian McLaren's representation of Wilson CPS scales, where <br>Brian leaves only powers of 2 (which Meyer would ignore) in the <br>denominators. Any just scale can be represented in this way. Meyer may have <br>deceived himself in many matters, but his mathematics was sound.<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 10 Jul 1996 00:03 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id PAA17716; Tue, 9 Jul 1996 15:03:20 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 9 Jul 1996 15:03:20 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199607092202.PAA17623@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
