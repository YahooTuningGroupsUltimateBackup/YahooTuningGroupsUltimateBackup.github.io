I actually have some replies<br>owed, esp. to Neil, but the weekend was quite busy, um, as follows:<br><br>Since my Net service provider gave me 300k of web site space, I have decided<br>not to waste it.  Therefore, without further ado, please point your grand<br>WWW browser to:<br><br>   http://www.adnc.com/web/jszanto/welcome.html<br><br>..the home of Corporeal Meadows.  <br><br>The site itself is pretty self-explanatory.  I am not a professional Web<br>page designer; you won't find bells and whistles, and this is definitely an<br>after-hours thing.  But you *know* how much I care about Harry and his<br>stuff, so I will keep this in a growing, albeit slowly, state.<br><br>And hopefully this will be an easy place to contact me/us.  Let me know what<br>you think.  Anything on the site I already know about, so it's for<br>Partch-centric people, with gratitude for being interested in all Harry things.<br><br>What better thing to do, seeing as I am days away from turning 43???<br>I'll be back shortly with more direct answers to some of the substantial<br>questions posted in the last couple of days...I haven't forgotten!<br><br>See you on the Meadow...<br><br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br>*--------------------------------------------------*<br>    Jonathan M.
