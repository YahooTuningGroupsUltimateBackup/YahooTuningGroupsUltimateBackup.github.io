(Gilmore p. 191)<br>><br>>What do y'all think?  Should I be impeached?<br><br>No sir.  Partch would have been greatful for the DX7.  He who says<br>otherwise is a gentleman and... an academic.  According to the Gilmore bio,<br>Partch resented academia's treatment of his work, grouping him with Cage,<br>etc.  I resent it to.  For me Partch's message about primitive man is<br>important, and not so nearly as important as his contribution to tuning in<br>music.  Regular academics cannot handle either one of these things, and by<br>saying stuff like this, the Partch academics show they cannot handle them<br>either.<br><br>Perhaps Harry erred on the side of being too rash.  Perhaps I err in the<br>same way.  But at least this has the benefit of making people check things<br>out for themselves, whereas academia would have us all stuffy with trusting.<br><br>Carl</div>
