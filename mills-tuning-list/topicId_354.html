I really believe in Ivor's notion about "mood" >and<br>>temperament. Any thoughts?<br><br>        The keyboard tempering practises in use between 1700 and 1900,(dates<br>are automatic flame targets in this subject!), offer physical reasons for<br>different "moods" to emanate from different key signatures. <br>      What I am curious about is whether the differences between keys of,<br>say, an early Werkmiester, are greater than the differences between the Greek<br>modes.  <br>      Plato, I believe, had strong thoughts about the effect different modes<br>exerted on the developing mind, and in his Republic, I think, stated that<br>some modes should never be heard, lest the growing intellect be irrepairably<br>damaged. <br>     Any body listen to enough Greek Modes and Well Temperaments to make a<br>comparison???<br><br>Regards, <br>Ed Foote <br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville.<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 21 Feb 1996 16:59 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA26082; Wed, 21 Feb 1996 07:58:58 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 21 Feb 1996 07:58:58 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9602211031.A4246-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
