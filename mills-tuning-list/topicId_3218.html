The first ten<br>pitches in the scale given by de Coul give the correct fretting for the<br>lowest string, and the 11th note does appear on another string.  However,<br>his scale is only a subset of the complete fretting, which is given below<br>in an excerpt from my book (from the highest pitch down).<br><br>(I hope the ASCII text format doesn't garble it too much in everyone's<br>viewer)<br><br>On each line I give the Letter-name, my JustMusic notation (^ = exponent,<br>* = multiply), Ratio, Semitones (which are cents divided by 100), and<br>Fret

represented on three strings.<br><br>The ratios derived from this fretting utilize the prime numbers 3, 7, 11,<br>17, 31, and 211.  The strings are tuned (from the bottom up) 1/1 - 4/3 -<br>16/9 - 9/8 - 3/2 - 1/1.  The 1st, 3rd, 4th, 8th and 10th frets all<br>incorporate 11^1.  The 6th fret uses 17^-1, the 1st and 8th frets both<br>use 31^-1, and the 4th fret uses 211^-1.  Prime number 5 (giving the<br>standard just-intonation 3rds and 6ths) is notably absent.<br><br>Dowland wrote his pieces in tablature, as did most other composers of<br>lute music, so there was no question as to which ratio would be played<br>for a pitch where there was a choice available (for example, there are<br>three different D#/Eb's within a range of 28 cents in the middle octave).<br><br>The exact string measurements which produce this fretting are given by<br>Dowland in his son Robert's book "Varietie of Lute Lessons", published in<br>London in 1610.  They are also available in Appendix 2 of Diana Poulton's<br>"John Dowland -- His Life and Works" [University of California Press,<br>1972], page 458.  A drawing of the fretboard with cents values was<br>published on the cover of the first issue of Johnny Reinhard's journal<br>"Pitch, for the International Microtonalist" [Autumn 1986].<br><br>This fretting can be considered a temperament, and it is eminently<br>suitable for Elizabethan-era lute music.<br><br>Hoogewerf's playing of the Dowland pieces at last year's AFMM was<br>outstanding.  He performed  them on a guitar whose fretboard had six<br>grooves running the length of it, one under each string, with 24 (at<br>least, possibly more) slideable frets in each groove, each fret long<br>enough for just one string.  This guitar is capable of retuning to any<br>possible scale within the space limitations of the frets and fingers.<br> <br>   Joseph L.
