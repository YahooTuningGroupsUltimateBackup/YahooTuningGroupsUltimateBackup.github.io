I like to make things.  I make lots of<br>things, not only musical instruments.  I own only a few tools, but the work<br>is fun and imaginative.  These musical non 12 TET scales are<br>"unconventional" and so are my instruments.  I have some ceramic musical<br>instruments also.  Some work better than others and are not intended to be<br>played together with other instruments.  I made them as part of ceramics<br>classwork at a local university.  Have some fun, don't be too serious about<br>your music.  ALITA MORRISON</div>
