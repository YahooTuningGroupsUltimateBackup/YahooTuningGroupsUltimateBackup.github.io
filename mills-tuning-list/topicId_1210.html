If you mean<br>enharmonics, then certainly they were common centuries before then.<br>However, the use of different spellings for enharmonics does not mean that<br>the composer requires (or even desires) a different tuning for the two. I<br>still fail to see any revolution coming from the mass production of the<br>12-pitch-per-octave piano keyboard in the 19th century.<br><br>John Chalmers wrote a good summary of some of the main points of the<br>history of the tuning of the diatonic scale, and then:<br><br>>It seems to me to be a coincidence that Ptolemy's Intense Diatonic<br>>in the Greek Lydian mode provides 4:5:6 triads on 1/1, 4/3 and 3/2.<br>>There is little evidence that the Greeks were aware of this fact<br>>and there were other diatonic tunings in favor without this property.<br><br>I'm not sure I would go so far as to call it coincidence, though clearly<br>triads and a theory of harmony in general were unknown to the Greeks.<br>Instead I would point out that Ptolemy's love of superparticulars<br>intersected with the European love of the major triad (or, more generally,<br>sweet-sounding thirds). Thus they arrived at the same scale for different<br>reasons.<br><br>Daniel Wolf wrote:<br><br>>Before we confirm tetrachords as the source of the diatonic scale, it is<br>>worthwhile to look closer at hexachords, which, unlike tetrachords, are<br>>able to sort out which Pythagorean collection is in play - the one with<br>>beginning with B (Bb) or the one going up to H (B natural) - thus keeping<br>>the augmented fourths/diminished fifths under control, along with an<br>>intonationally excellent solfege.<br><br>What I have been getting at is that there is a big difference between an<br>interpretation of a musical construct to help fit practice and provide a<br>convenient conceptual background for composition, and the actual reasons<br>that the construct appeared in the first place. Like other musical<br>constructs, the diatonic scale was reinterpreted (and sometimes "tweaked"<br>to use John Chalmers' term) to fit changing musical aesthetics. Thus it<br>could be thought of as interlocking triads, hexachords, or whatever.<br>However, it would be putting the cart before the horse to claim that the<br>diatonic scale was invented as a result of these insights.<br><br>Well, I don't think we CAN find a "theoretical basis" for the diatonic<br>scale, as I believe its origins in Europe lie in the dim period of<br>intersection of "barbarian" and Roman cultures in the first centuries of<br>the Current Era. This is not to say that such "folk" musics do not have a<br>theoretical underpinning, but only that I don't think we can say what it<br>was at that time.<br><br>Medieval hexachordal theory is a problem. I've heard several unconvincing<br>arguments as to why Guido chose 6 for his theory. Your explanation sounds<br>interesting, but perhaps I'm not following it. Why couldn't heptachords<br>(i.e. octave species) accomplish the same thing? It would certainly have<br>helped many a music history student who scratched their heads over this<br>hexachordal "basis" for heptatonic scales.<br><br>At any rate, I think the important thing to remember is that Guido's was a<br>pedagogical method, not an attempt to provide a theoretical basis for the<br>existence of the scale. The use of hexachordal solfege in early vocal music<br>is fascinating. Perhaps their experience could help explain Guido's<br>reasoning.<br><br>Dan also wrote:<br><br>>(3) Taking Yasser=A5s age and era into account, I find it terribly unfair t=<br>o<br>>characterize him as ethnocentric. In fact, I defy anyone to tell me exactly<br>>what ethnicity was central to Yasser. (He was a Russian-born scholar of<br>>Jewish Music).<br><br>At the risk of sounding like an apologist for McLarenesque hyperbole, let<br>me say that I meant to criticize the ideas not the man, whom I understand<br>lived in a different time with different ideas. Perhaps I should have<br>dubbed "Eurocentric" his interpretation of the music of other cultures, and<br>Chinese music in particular, always in reference to an ideal of European<br>common-practice harmony. Thus he sees Chinese music as centuries less<br>advanced as European music, a viewpoint that I think is blind to the<br>differences of intent, the differences of aesthetics, and the true beauties<br>of that music.<br><br>>His Darwinian streak, is, however, fair game, but can<br>>someone suggest a more P.C. term than _evolution_ to describe transitions<br>>towards more complex tonal systems?<br>><br>I guess a theory of harmonic progression is more "complex" in 19TET in the<br>sense that there are more choices, but it does not follow that European<br>music is more complex than Chinese or that there is necessarily a<br>progression from one to the other. He's just looking at one theoretical<br>dimension (harmony/counterpoint) that happens to be very important in<br>certain European music and not in others. What would happen if I based my<br>analysis of music history on rhythmic complexity? Certainly Europe of the<br>same period would come off as a very "primitive" music culture.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
