Limits can often be desirable.  Other phraseologies<br>I've used:  <br>* It's hard to produce a music that really stretchs the limits if you don't<br><br>  afford yourself any limits in the first place.<br>* Walls limit your movement, but they also give you a place to hang<br>pictures.<br>* Doing clever things with limited resources impresses people.  It's hard<br>to <br>  pinpoint cleverness in an effort made on infinite resources.  <br>* It's certainly true that you need muscles to move, but even with the<br>  strongest muscles you won't get anywhere without a skeletal framework for<br>  those muscles to act upon.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 12 Jan 1997 18:28 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA32057; Sun, 12 Jan 1997 18:31:58 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA32058<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA18101; Sun, 12 Jan 1997 09:31:54 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 12 Jan 1997 09:31:54 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v03007800aefed523412b@[130.132.159.66]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
