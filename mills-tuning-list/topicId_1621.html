I wouldn't for a minute confuse it with any great theoretical<br>tuning setup (probably  just a 'weird' tuning patch), but considering the<br>fact that the rest of the commercial isn't really *wacko* or anything, it<br>*is* pretty amazing they got it past the usual up-tight ad execs.  Funny<br>stuff.  A hundred bucks to the first listee who reports back with the name<br>of the jingle-meister, paid directly out of the burdgeoning coffers of the<br>C.
