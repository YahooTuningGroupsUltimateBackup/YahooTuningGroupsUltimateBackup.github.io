Curiously, the device was invented by<br>Richard Bowden of country parody group Pinkard and Bowden.  He demonstrated it<br>this morning on The Johnboy and Billy Show (a syndicated morning show for<br>rednecks - don't ask <g>).  I plan to check it out at MARS music store next<br>week and will update you then if somebody doesn't beat me to the punch.  Cross<br>your calloused fingers!<br><br>David J.

Here I take<br>>the small 21:20 semitone as the counterpart of the usual limma<br>>(256:243, which occurs at e-f and b-c'), and accordingly place it at<br>>these locations. Note that "diatonic" semitones in this sense may be<br>>defined by the rule that a flat tends to descend, and a sharp to<br>>ascend.<br><br>If I'm not mistaken, that would only apply if c were assumed to be the<br>starting place of the tuning.  If any tone of the 12-tone tuning might be<br>chosen as the first tone of a scale then that could change which (absolute)<br>tones were considered which type, right?  Perhaps that's one place that my<br>approach deviates from the Gothic.  Still, the tuning you originally specified<br>has some real merit, and could never be achieved using my methods.<br><br>I really like the idea of the 17-tone tuning you proposed, which should allow<br>both approaches.  Though my keyboard's tuning table only handles 12 tones, I<br>might be able to visualize a fantasy harp with 17 strings to the octave and<br>compose for it under the assumption that no more than 12 tones would be used<br>in any given composition.<br><br>Thanks for fully answering my questions, and for yet another brilliant<br>analysis!<br><br>David J.
