He needed a chain so that it could be used to generate<br>ostinati that would be sustained through changes of metre, thereby<br>requiring as many members as there would be attacks in each member. The<br>series should also be quasi-random in that it maintained a equal<br>distribution throughout the measure. This meant that the first two terms<br>would each be distributed in the two halves of the available range, the<br>first three terms in each third of the range, the first four in each<br>fourth, etc.. Curiously, Barlowe needed a chain of eighteen members, but =<br>he<br>was unaware of contemporary research among Ramsey theorists who found tha=<br>t<br>the largest such chain could have only seventeen members. Not being able =<br>to<br>find a chain of more than twelve members at the time, Barlough was forced=<br><br>to utilize other means to determine metricity in his 'autobus' pieces.   =<br><br><br>The composer and mathematician David Feldman has posted a complete list o=<br>f<br>these chains, each term of which is notated as a range between two<br>fractional values. These are available at http://www.math.unh.edu/~dvf<br><br>Although Barhloch orginally intended these series for generating metrical=<br><br>attacks, anyone working with frequency ratios will soon recognize somethi=<br>ng<br>vaguely familiar - i.e. ratios well-distributed within an octave. Taking<br>one of the longer chains at random, and then assigning a freshman sum rat=<br>io<br>to each term, one can construct collections of pitches which grow in<br>surprising ways while maintaining their distribution within the octave. I=<br>n<br>particular, I have worked with a tuning parameter whose extreme values ar=<br>e<br>derived on one hand from the harmonic series and on the other hand from<br>such a chain. While all of the materials used are just, the resultant<br>collections are often tonally ambiguous, but that's okay since I remain -=<br>-<br>as always -- ambiguous about tonality.  =<br><br><br>Daniel Wolf =</div>
