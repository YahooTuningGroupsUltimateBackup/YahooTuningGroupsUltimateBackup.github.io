(This is deeply connected to<br>the whole ''pun'' phenomenon).<br><br>While each temperament does provide a unique range of distictive intervals,<br>the nature of their distinctiveness - as found in beating rates, difference<br>tones, etc. - has been a relatively neglected subject. While one can only<br>speculate about how such a subject will ultimately get integrated into a<br>''common'' musical practice and theory, my own guess is that just intervals<br>- not a given temperament - will remain the main point of reference and<br>that such distinctive intervals will continue to be primarily construed as<br>deviations from just intervals rather than members of a given temperament. <br><br>That said, ETs will continue to play a role in the design of keyboards and<br>notations - indeed wherever a finite set of placeholders will be efficient<br>for composition and performance.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 6 May 1997 21:59 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06034; Tue, 6 May 1997 21:59:22 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06125<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id MAA03847; Tue, 6 May 1997 12:57:22 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 6 May 1997 12:57:22 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95q.970506144025.23534A-100000@library.wustl.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
