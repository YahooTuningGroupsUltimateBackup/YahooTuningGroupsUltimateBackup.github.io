The accuracy of 36-equal within the 7-limit is actually slightly <br>greater than that of 22-equal (though 22-equal is consistent through the <br>11-limit).<br><br>>The intervals round has 36 sounds and based on the interval 19<br>>microtons.<br>>Therefor C major-0 key have intervals:0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17,<br>>19, 21, 23, 25,<br>> 27, 29, 31, 33, 34, (36).<br><br>which, we may recall, Tomasz has named<br><br>>C, Q, Z, D, K, R, E, L, F, M, T, G, N, U, A, O, V, B, W, c.<br><br>So the scale is generated by an interval of 633 cents, which represents 10/7 <br>in this system, starting on F or 15. Since three consecutive 633-cent <br>intervals mod the octave give a 700-cent interval, 19 notes from the cycle <br>of 633-cent intervals are needed to obtain a traditional diatonic scale (7 <br>notes plus 6*2 intermediate notes).<br><br>There are seven 4:5:6:7 chords in this scale, and seven 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 <br>chords as well. All six consonant triads of the diatonic scale have been <br>"septimalized," in other words, consonant tetrads that are built on these <br>triads exist in the scale.<br><br>Here is a little progression using Tomasz's letter names, M indicates a <br>4:5:6:7 chord (4 is the root), and m indicates a 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 chord (1/6 <br>is the root)<br><br>CM Om TM Em QM Vm GM CM<br><br>00-02-04-04-02-04-06-00<br><br>12-14-12-12-14-16-14-12<br><br>21-21-19-21-23-23-21-21<br><br>29-29-31-33-31-31-33-29<br><br><br>This is a clever system and definitely seems worth exploring by microtonal <br>composers. It seems unlikely, though, that one could maintain a sense of <br>"key" unless the diatonic notes are treated as the main notes and the other <br>notes used only for "septimalization" or for passing tones or chords.<br><br>Thanks to Tomasz Liese for his original contribution, and please reply if he <br>disagrees or has additional comments.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 26 Mar 1997 03:19 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17546; Wed, 26 Mar 1997 03:19:09 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA17387<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id SAA25579; Tue, 25 Mar 1997 18:17:37 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 25 Mar 1997 18:17:37 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703252110_MC2-1347-9C85@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
