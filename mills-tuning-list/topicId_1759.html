I would say Renaissance through<br>Middle <br>Baroque. Well-temperaments brought the 16:19:24 tuning into currency in the<br><br>Late Baroque period. Please don't make this into another black-and-white <br>issue, I'm trying to explain tendencies, not impose rules. Having played in<br><br>these tunings during the 20th century, I can't give experimental proof that<br><br>my own tendencies in this regard are similar to historical ones<br>indepentenly <br>of having grown up bombarded with classical music on the radio (which <br>included some authentically-tuned performances of Renaissance music). But I<br><br>feel them strongly.''<br><br>The problem is that the ''Renaissance to Middle Baroque'' - I assume you<br>intend a period between the last days of Pythagoreanism and the advent of<br>well temperaments - is a time period where different intonations were in<br>use simultaneously, depending largely upon instrumental resources and<br>whether voices were accompanied or not.  The reasonable rule of thumb has<br>been that fretted strings approximated equal temperament (Vincentino 1555),<br>keyboards used some form of  meantone, and  voices, unfretted strings and<br>winds either matched the temperament of continuo instruments or tended<br>towards just intervals.  To attribute a harmonic figure like the tonic<br>major ending to intonational practice is problematic in that the figure is<br>present in all instrumental repertoires, without regard to tuning. Even if<br>the figure were to have originated in a just or meantone environment<br>(approximating /6:/5:/4) - and its obiquity in the lute repertoire speaks<br>against this - the adoption into other tuning systems would have meant that<br>the figure was frequently heard without the psychoacoustic effect that you<br>claim. For this reason, I suspect that the figure became established as an<br>affect independent of its precise intonation - and one whose archaicizing<br>quality was already well established in the late meantone repertoire (hence<br>Rousseau's label identifying the figure with gothic Picardie).<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 2 Mar 1997 16:56 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01972; Sun, 2 Mar 1997 16:56:53 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01984<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id HAA29782; Sun, 2 Mar 1997 07:54:59 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 2 Mar 1997 07:54:59 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703021052_MC2-11F3-649D@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
