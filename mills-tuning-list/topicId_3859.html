For example, A440 produced by a tuning fork consists of<br>> vibrations having frequencies of mostly A440.

Are overtones different frequencies<br>> produced by different aspects of whatever materials are producing the sound?<br>> So if the sound is being created by simpler materials such as a tuning fork,<br>> the will be fewer other frequencies involved, whereas if the sound is created<br>> by a piano, the hammer and string are more complex materials and therefore<br>> have more frequencies or overtones? <br><br>It is not so much that rich tones are composed of a fundamental <br>frequency and its overtones as that they can be decomposed this way. <br>Sound is frequently visualized as a graph of air pressure vs time:<br>                                _____       _____       _____<br>    /|    /|    /|    /|       |     |     |     |     |     |<br>  /  |  /  |  /  |  /  |       |     |     |     |     |     |<br>/    |/    |/    |/    |  or   |     |_____|     |_____|     |<br><br>for instance. Joseph Fourier figured out how to add up cosine and sine <br>waves, which are mathematical representations of the the simplest kinds of <br>sounds, to obtain any type of periodic function whatsoever, such as the <br>ramp and square waves pictured above. <br>	Describing a complex waveform in terms of its decomposition into a <br>sum of sine and cosine waves whose frequencies are simple multiples of <br>the fundamental (such as A 440) is useful, but not necessary, for <br>describing a tone and understanding why a waveform looks and sounds as it <br>does. For instance, the first waveform pictured is similar to <br>that of a bowed instrument. The bow pulls the string until the rosin can <br>no longer hold it, and then the string quickly snaps free, travelling a <br>distance until it is recaptured by the rosined horsehair, to be pulled <br>again until it escapes, etc. The ramp up represents the string being <br>pulled by the bow, and the quick dropoff is where the string escapes and <br>quickly springs back. The motion of the string is transferred to the top <br>of the instrument, which moves in and out with the change in tension on <br>the string, transfering its motion to the air. The changes in air <br>pressure are graphed by the helpful scientist and pulled apart into <br>separate simpler (read smoother) graphs, which when added together give <br>back the original. The separate frequencies people talk about are not <br>really separate properties of the instrument (except in the case of <br>synthesizers that make complex sounds by adding together simple ones) but <br>rather a convenient mathematical way to analyze the complex vibrations of <br>musical instruments. <br>    This is a simplification for the sake of a short(?) answer to the <br>complex question you asked. Certainly something that vibrates in a <br>complex way produces a complex sound, but simple waveforms such as <br>triangle waves and square waves have complex representations in terms of <br>the number of higher harmonics that have to be added together to build <br>them from scratch. I am sure a number of others will respond to your <br>question, so I am signing off.<br><br>John Starrett<br>http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</div><h3><a id=8272 href="#8272">ðŸ”—</a>Drew Skyfyre &#x3C;steele@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/1998 3:57:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Greetings All,<br><br>This goes back to the microtonal flute thread from May.<br>Please forgive my ignorance about the details of the workings<br>of wind instruments.  I've just begun to seriously think about <br>microtonal wind instruments and have a few questions. <br><br>>From what I understand, many players achieve different tunings<br>by using various fingerings. From this list, I know this has been<br>done on flute and bassoon. To which other wind instruments has this<br>approach been applied ? And, what types of tunings are possible ?<br><br>The other approach is of course instruments that are physically <br>altered from their std. forms, to achieve non-std. pitches. Logic<br>would argue that there probably aren't many users of these instruments <br>around. Any thoughts/ comments ?<br><br>Is there a good source of info out there for someone wanting<br>to write parts for these instruments  ? Though ultimately it would <br>require personally working with the people who are to actually <br>perform the parts, to fine tune the writing to match their actual<br>physical abilities.
