In fact, let's get that out of the way: there is <br>nothing "pseudo" about this comma, it's just using the term for an equal <br>tempered phenomenon rather than a pure tuning situation. As long as the <br>difference is made clear, comma will suffice.<br>    Anyway, here's what happens in 34...first, if you take an E major <br>chord in 34, and then a G major, the B note will NOT be the same <br>note in both chords; they are different by 1 increment. This is a hoot, <br>and I don't agree with Morrison that this comma is either an error, or <br>something to be avoided; I am learning to embrace it, work with it...the <br>results are totally unique. It is a challenge, to be sure, but the vistas <br>are pretty exciting.<br>    Next, there are 2 separate circles of 5ths in 34, as well as 2 <br>different whole steps, one representing 10/9, and the other 9/8. The <br>major and minor 3rds are only about 2 cents from pure, the 5th is about 4 <br>cents sharp, and the ratios 49/48, 25/24, 17/16, 13/12, 20/17, and many <br>others are mighty close to pure. People have called it the just intonated <br>equal temp for good reasons, and I think it is a good direction to <br>pursue. I am composing on both electric and acoustic guitars with 34; <br>there's a lot going on with this system. Feel free to post me privately <br>if you have other comments.<br>    Also, there's a misunderstanding about Brian Carlson's post <br>concerning his guitars...one is 19 eq, and the other is 18 unequal; this <br>is the one that Rankin helped design. So, all you guys who were wondering <br>about the ratios, it's 18...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 28 Apr 1997 11:04 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA32303; Mon, 28 Apr 1997 11:04:55 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA32197<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id CAA08088; Mon, 28 Apr 1997 02:03:10 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 28 Apr 1997 02:03:10 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01541105af8995a19209@[207.207.2.40]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5358 href="#5358">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>4/28/1997 6:23:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>I joined the list last week, so I thought it's about time I introduced myself.<br>>...my thesis project is called Rusty.<br><br>   Rusty sounds interesting.
