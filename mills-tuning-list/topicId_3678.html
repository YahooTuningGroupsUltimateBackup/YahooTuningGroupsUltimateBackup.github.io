Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/1998 11:37:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I was playing around with a harmonica sound on my Ensoniq VFX-SD tuned<br>as close as possible to JI (the scale being the JI version of the<br>pentachordal decatonic scale of my paper, hence 12 notes per octave with<br>two 50:49 "commas"). Playing the chord 1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4, and dropping the<br>3/2 down to 7/5, I didn't hear much of an increase in dissonance. After<br>some confusion, I realized that the only potentially dissonant interval<br>in this chord is the 28:25 (196 cents) between 5/4 and 7/5. Now the<br>Ensoniq's tuning tables allow cents values for each note, and I had<br>approximated the other intervals in such a way that the 28:25 was<br>nominally represented by 199 cents. Since the true tuning resolution of<br>the Ensoniq VFX-SD is 512 notes per octave, this interval was probably<br>represented by 85/512 octave, or 199.2 cents. This is only 4.7 cents off<br>a just 9/8, which explains the relative consonance of the chord. It is a<br>near miss to a saturated 9-limit chord. A true 28/25 would be 7.7 cents<br>off a just 9/8, which would be quite a bit more dissonant.<br><br>The difference between 28/25 and 9/8 is 225/224, a fundamental<br>comma-like interval in Fokker's writings. So the magic chord 1/1 5/4 7/5<br>7/4 will be possible in any temperament where the 225/224 vanishes. The<br>simplest ET that sounds like 9-limit JI is 41tET, and the 225/224 does<br>vanish in 41. The chord is 0 13 20 33 in 41. In 72tET, which sounds like<br>11-limit JI, the 225/224 also vanishes. The chord is 0 23 35 58 in 72.</div>
