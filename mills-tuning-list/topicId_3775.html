On the Roland, for example, up to 512<br>>samples (ie, the total number of samples that can be loaded at one<br>>time) can be looped any which way you like and it will make no<br>>difference at all to the amount of RAM that is available.  I'm sorry,<br>>I can't tell you if this is the same on the EMU units, but I suspect<br>>that, on these, as you say, looping may eat into RAM.<br><br>Whoops, I say potato & you said tomato !  I wasn't refering to <br>looping eating into RAM. I was speaking (so to speak) without regard to<br> RAM usage.<br><br>What I was trying to say is don't bother using looping  just<br>to conserve RAM because of the tedium involved.Use looping for <br>sustain if you like, but doing it to conserve RAM ,for thousands of wee <br>samples....<br>Is there a doctor in the house !?<br><br>About the E-mu thingies, I was refering to their sample playback<br>synths, like the Proteus,etc. Not the samplers !<br><br><br>Later,<br>Drew</div>
