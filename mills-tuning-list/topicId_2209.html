It's one thing to point out the lack of chromaticism Mozart's<br>music with winds and perhaps organ, and quite another to extrapolate that<br>conservatism into a tuning preference on the piano. The use of unvalved<br>brass in the lower harmonics will naturally restrict key choices, for<br>example, your interesting data on occassional stopped horn pitches<br>notwithstanding.<br><br>If this supposed prevalance of meantone tuning is to be applied to the<br>piano, then how are we to account for Mozart's occassional, but no less<br>significant, excursions into chromaticism in solo piano works, such as the<br>famous C minor fantasy? There are other possibilities besides equal<br>temperament, including the various well temperaments and circulating<br>temperaments, but I can't see how such a piece could work in meantone, if<br>that's what you're proposing.<br><br>Now, I think it's possible that meantone continued to be used by some<br>tuners all the way into the 20th century. It's easy to tune, and most music<br>played by amateurs and provincial churches did not demand the use of many<br>keys and chromaticism. But I think it's equally likely that professionals<br>used a variety of circulating and well temperaments as well as equal<br>temperament at the same time.<br><br>It would be interesting to know when piano tuning became a profession<br>separate from that of the instrument builder and musician like it is today.<br>It's easy to imagine that the institutionalization of the occupation could<br>help lead to a standardization of equal temperament. Brian McLaren and Lou<br>Harrison have blamed this standardization on the industrialization of piano<br>manufacturing, but, while it's possible that would explain the factory<br>tuning, I don't see why it would explain why it was tuned that way<br>thereafter.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.

But Jorgensen (thanks<br>> for the name) and others point out that this technique was not known until<br>> late in the nineteenth century.  There are no early  references to<br>> counting beats per second, etc.  One of the feature of Meantone tunings<br>> (and well-tempered tunings are a sub-category of mean-tone) is that they<br>> depend upon finding the 'mean' pitch.  A common 18th century technique<br>> would have you tune several intervals purely, then advise: Tune D to Bb<br>> purely.  Now sharpen the D until Bb/D beats at the same rate as D/F#.<br>> Most anyone without too much experience can do this.  It takes a LOT of<br>> practice to hear 12TET thirds and fifths.<br><br>1.  A fair number of writers were advocating 12TET by the mid-1700s.<br>Most of them had plenty of experience tuning (and in some cases<br>building) keyboard instruments.  Why shouldn't some of them have had<br>sufficient practise to hear 12TET thirds and fifths?  (Someone once<br>posted a quote from Werckmeister to this list in which he describes<br>distributing the comma equally among all 12 fifths, then says that a<br>circulating temperament sufficed for a local church, but only ET was<br>suitable for a court.)  To be sure, having an exact scheme would make<br>things much easier, but I don't see why someone with a good ear couldn't<br>make a passable ET with enough fiddling.<br><br>2.  A big problem with Jorgensen (many think) is that he makes too much<br>of equal beating.  If you look at most surviving tuning instructions,<br>they're worded far too vaguely for one to confidently presume that they<br>actually refer to intervals beating _at the same rate_.  It's quite<br>plausible that the language merely refers to the fact that tempered<br>intervals beat, and that two intervals are tempered about the same<br>distance from just.  It doesn't take Helmholtz to figure out that<br>equally tempered intervals beat faster the higher they are in pitch.<br><br>--pH <manynote@library.wustl.edu> http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote <*><br>    O<br>   /\        "Foul?
