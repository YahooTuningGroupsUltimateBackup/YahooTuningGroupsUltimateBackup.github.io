After a little experimenting, I realized that all of<br>these notes were pretty useless below middle C, as they need to be<br>relatively high in a chord voicing to sound smooth.  So, then I went back<br>and tuned the black notes below middle C to more useful pitches.  That's<br>when I realized that I could also use different Ds above and below middle<br>C. <br><br>I decided to use the D that's a fifth above G for the notes above middle<br>C, and the D that's a third below F for the notes below middle C because<br>the D below middle C is more likely to serve as a root of a ii chord (and<br>its advantageous to have a low note for a root) while the D above G is<br>more likely to be voiced as an upper voice.<br><br>BTW, I will be doing a presentation for the local piano tuners guild in<br>March demonstrating this tuning and a couple of pieces.<br><br>I also use this tuning to demonstrate intervals to my sight singing<br>classes.  Even the non-major class yesterday could hear the difference<br>between the 8:9 and 9:10 major seconds.
