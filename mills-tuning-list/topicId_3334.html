It is possible to store the Ensoniq <br>tuning tables in your computer. I know since I wrote a program <br>several years ago to do just this. (Unfortunately, it was on an Atari <br>computer, so it will be of limited usefullness to most). Thus - the <br>problem is not with the "Ensoniq pitch table sysex codes", but rather <br>that the authors of the software did not bother to implement the <br>Ensoniq pitch tables. As far as I know, though, you cannot update <br>them except by sending a whole pitch table, that is, you cnnot retune <br>"one note" at a time. <br><br>Since most of my pieces are in non-12 based tunings, I have found <br>the Korg and Roland synths almost useless. The Yamaha's (like the <br>TX81Z), the Emu's (like the Proteus modules) and the Ensoniq <br>samplers are all roughly equally capable.<br><br>Bill Sethares</div>
