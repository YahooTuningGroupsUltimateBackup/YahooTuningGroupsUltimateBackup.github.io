The instrument was developed for the performance of live microtonal<br>music in a wide variety of termperaments. It includes a 122-key keyboard,<br>two 3-D vector pedals, and up to six foot switches. The presentaiton will<br>feature performances of works by several composers in a range of<br>non-standard equal and just tunings.

The Werckmeister III contains 4 sizes of major third,<br>>one of which is equivalent to 402 cents, one that is Pythagorean at 408<br>>cents,one at 396 cents, and the smallest one at 390 - all sharper than<br>>the just 386 cents.<br><br>Yes, you can argue it that way.  And yes, you are correct in saying that<br>both Wm III and ET have major thirds that are larger than just.  But the<br>quote in question still refers to equal temperament.  Why?  Because of the<br>context: Most ear-tuning instructions for Circular temperaments in 18th-<br>century Germany relied on setting the *fifths* in order to temper the scale.<br>I have never seen (I don't think) 18th-century German ear tuning<br>instruction that use fifths as a tempering device for Equal Temperament.<br>They all used rows of MAJOR THIRDS which were to be made wide!<br>(Sorge gave explicit instructions that each successive third should be<br>made somewhat *wider* than the last.)  Several rows of three successive<br>major thirds completed the temperament (the idea was to temper the<br>thirds wide to close the lesser diesis; several of these "third-rows" closed<br>the Ditonic Comma). On the issue of tuning, C.P.E. Bach even<br>recommends that his readers buy Barthold Fritz's _Zuverlaessige<br>Anweisung._, which gives instruction for EQUAL TEMPERAMENT.<br><br>Get over it.  Bach probably wrote (at least his harpsichord works) for Equal<br>Temperament or something darn close to it.  Not all the revisionism in the<br>world can alter the *evidence.*<br><br><br>>Further, Kirnberger himself gave directions for the tempered fifth whose<br>>ratio (10935:16384) is almost exactly 1/12 of a comma smaller than the<br>>pure fifth in several publications, including his *Von der Temperatur*.<br><br>Kirnberger never wrote a book called "Von der Temperatur."<br><br><br>>The method by which he arrived was to take seven pure fifths in<br>>succession plus one pure major third.  This gives the tempered fourth<br>>8192:10935, which is larger than the pure fourth by 1/12 of a comma, its<br>>inversion is the tempered fifth 10935:16384.<br><br>Yes, this is the F#-C# fifth in Kirnberger I though III.  However, it is not<br>tempered by 1/12 Pythagorean comma; it is tempered by the *schisma.*<br>Kirnberger was not the best mathematician in the world and Marpurg, in<br>fact, corrects Kirnberger's calculations in Marpurg's _Versuch._<br><br>>According to Kirnberger he showed this discovery to Leonhard Euler in<br>>1766 and remarked to him that this fifth could be used to determine all<br>>ratios of equal temperament, an idea subsequently developed by Johann<br>>Heinrich Lambert and published in the *Memoires de l'academie royale<br>>des sciences et belle lettres* (Berlin 1774) and used by Marpurg against<br>>Kirnberger.  (See p. 20 of the *Art of Strict Musical Composition* by<br>>Kirnberger, Yale University Press)<br><br>>There is great bitterness against Kirnberger, chief violinist and<br>>keyboardist at the court in Berlin by Marpurg, the Lottery King Of Berlin.<br><br>This is correct.  Though I believe that Kirnberger was employed by<br>Princess Amalie, the sister of Frederick, not Frederick himself, as you<br>*might* have been implying.  If you were not implying this, ignore the last<br>sentence.<br><br><br>>Clearly, this argument of fifths over thirds is an aesthetic battle of<br>>historic proportions.  Politics enters at every level and success is oft<br>>measured by clout.  What intrigues me most about Prof. Rasch's<br>>perspective is that the Netherlands has been a leader in performing<br>>"early music" in historic intonation and as its main musical intellectual<br>>in this area, Rasch bucked the trend.  Perhaps if he were in any one of<br>>the other countries that had been resistant to historic intonation<br>>systems, he might have headed the other way.<br><br>(1) Dutch HIP players continue to play in historical intonations (although,<br>frequently without regard to historical framework of period and region);<br><br>(2) I find it distressing that historical evidence continues to be ignored and<br>that the "temperament revisionists," standing on the shakiest of grounds<br>and often without being really read in the subject, continue to disseminate<br>disinformation that misleads people and results in performances of<br>dubious historical accuracy.<br><br><br>Aleksander Frosztega<br><Who hates equal temperament just as much as the next person but can't<br>ignore the evidence><br><br><br><br>-------------------------------------------------------<br>Aleksander Frosztega     "Odi summusos; proinde aperte<br>University of Utrecht     dice quid sit quod times."<br>The Netherlands<br>-------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 26 Sep 1995 13:52 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id EAA04531; Tue, 26 Sep 1995 04:51:59 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 26 Sep 1995 04:51:59 -0700<br>Message-Id: <950926053059_70461.10_IHD50-1@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
