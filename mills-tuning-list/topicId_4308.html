It's quite an undertaking; increased<br>thanks to Dave Madole for managing it for all that time!<br><br>Anyway, here's some common problems, and how to deal with them.<br><br>1)  Too many messages per day - I want just one, daily email:<br><br>For those of you who preferred receiving the list in one, daily "digest" (as<br>I do), you<br>need to switch your subscription to digest mode, by sending an empty email<br>to "tuning-digest@onelist.com".<br><br>It's too bad I wasn't able to capture everybody's "digest vs. non-digest"<br>preferences from the old system, 'cuz it seems to be a common problem.<br><br>2)  "When I try to switch to digest, or even mail to the list at all, I am<br>told that my email address is not subscribed.  And yet I receive tuning<br>email here.":<br><br>You may be known to the system by a different email address.  The difference<br>may be subtle, or there may be some sort of "email forwarding" going on.<br>Compare the return address you put on emails to the address ONElist is using<br>to send you mail.<br><br>3)  Do I have to have web access to use this thing now?<br><br>No.  I saw this problem coming.  That's why I included this extra<br>description in every message, after ONElist's web instructions:<br><br>  You do not need web access to participate.  You may subscribe through<br>  email.  Send an empty email to one of these addresses:<br>    tuning-subscribe@onelist.com - subscribe to the tuning list.<br>    tuning-unsubscribe@onelist.com - unsubscribe from the tuning list.<br>    tuning-digest@onelist.com - switch your subscription to digest mode.<br>    tuning-normal@onelist.com - switch your subscription to normal mode.<br><br>That's all for now.  Go back to talking about tuning.  (Maybe I'll join in<br>on that again too, once the smoke settles.)
