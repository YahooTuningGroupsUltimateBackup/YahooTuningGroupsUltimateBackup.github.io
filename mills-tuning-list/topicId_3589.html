Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/19/1998 7:59:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>The 5-limit diatonic scale has two step sizes -- or is it three? In just<br>intonation, it's three:<br><br>9/8 10/9 16/15 9/8 10/9 9/8 16/15<br><br>and Bill Alves might argue that this is just how the diatonic scale<br>should be, melodically or otherwise. However, compare the 5-limit<br>diatonic scale in 12-equal:<br><br>2 2 1 2 2 2 1<br>(2 step sizes)<br><br>with that in 22-equal<br><br>4 3 2 4 3 4 2<br>(3 step sizes).<br><br>The 12-equal version sounds better melodically, even though 22-equal has<br>consonant intervals closer to those of JI. I think this is because<br>having three different step sizes is awkward melodically (in this case),<br>and in JI the 9/8 and 10/9 are, as Ben Johnston would say, close enough<br>to sound like melodically equal steps.<br><br>Note that while the 5-limit led Ben Johnston to a 53-near-equal JI<br>scale, the 7-limit led him to a 22-near-equal JI scale (which I read<br>about in Perspectives of New Music). Anyone familiar with other<br>near-equal scales Johnston used?<br><br>Bill Alves' was my favorite piece on the tape swap, and I think its<br>strengths are rhythm and harmony. The harmonic basis for the melody was<br>strong enough that even the few awkward melodic passages can sound<br>somehow "right," though in a very exotic sort of way.</div>
