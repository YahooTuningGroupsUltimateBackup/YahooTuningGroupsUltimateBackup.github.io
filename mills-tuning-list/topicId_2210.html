Correct me if I'm wrong,<br>but I<br>know of no evidence that meantone was never actually used in any<br>appreciable abundance in the Classical Era or later.<br><br>-   -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - etc.<br><br>Greetings List<br>I would be interested to learn about the use of meantone in any Era.<br><br>Whatever tuning schemes were used, Equal Temperament "proved" better.<br> At any rate, that is what pianos are tuned to,and most all keyboards<br>today.  When ET was first used for tuning, (and I assume it was on<br>pianos other wise it would have been on harpsichrods, or even earlier<br>on organs) that is an interesting question. (My guess is after 1850) <br>We know that ET is based on the 12th root of 2.  <br>When that formula came into being and by whom I would like to know.<br>The other question is could Equal Temperament exist without knowledge<br>of the 12th root of 2 formula??  I think so, but that is for another<br>post.  <br>	Regarding the 12th root of 2, it doesn't mean much if you don't know<br>the frequency of the note.  When did it become possible to measure<br>the frequency of a musical pitch?  The frequency of pitch also allows<br>determination of harmonics.  Harmonics is what produces the beats (or<br>lack of) by which any instrument is tuned, especially when tuning by<br>intervals such as the fifth, fourth, third, octave and so on. But one<br>doens't need to know frequencies or math formulas to hear beats<br>resulting from tuned intervals. <br>	The schemes for tuning intervals on the keyboard is interesting,<br>however after tuning pure fifths it soon becomes  apparent that one<br>fifth will be "wild" (and consequently its fourth). (and only one<br>fifth which is interesting)  Because of  this one lone "wolf" we have<br>the conecpt of temperament. Keep in mind this is a phenomona of<br>keyboards of 12 semitones to the octaves.  Orchesterial and choral<br>performances don't seem to be encumbered by temperament. <br><br>Richard Moody piano tuner technician<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 7 Jul 1997 17:16 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06350; Mon, 7 Jul 1997 17:16:44 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 7 Jul 1997 17:16:44 +0200<br>Received: from [144.91.3.20] by ns (smtpxd); id XA06312<br>Received: (qmail 13821 invoked from network); 7 Jul 1997 15:07:09 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 7 Jul 1997 15:07:09 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199707071104_MC2-1A5F-9BF8@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5783 href="#5783">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.

There is no need to construct anything like<br>>a ROHS. If a certain note appears twice in the lattice, as will happen in the<br>>9-limit, use the closer one to evaluate the distance from any other note. Of<br>>course, the distance between two instances of the same note is zero.

I know that certain<br>applications of Euler-Fokker theory have assumed octave equivalence, for<br>example using the genera as scales for compositions (I recently pointed<br>out that in a triangular latice, there are many structures as compact or<br>more compact than the E-F genera).
