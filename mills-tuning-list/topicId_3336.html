I lent my copy of<br>>> Genesis to a friend, so I don't have the reference handy.<br><br>Continuing on p. 418 ["Genesis of a Music" 2nd ed., 1974], Partch says:<br><br>"...140.5 cents (13th [partial] of "F") and 51.3 cents (11th [partial] of<br>"G"),<br>separated by 99.2 cents, or virtually a whole "semitone", are presumed to<br>be the same tone, "Db"."<br><br>Partch's point is that the assignment of partials to 12-eq<br>representations by Schoenberg has a margin of error which nearly equals<br>the smallest interval in the 12-equal scale, so that the partials could<br>just as easily be represented by the next nearest 12-eq note as by the<br>one assigned by Schoenberg.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Further in the discussion, regarding over-/ undertones and dualism,<br>Erlich wrote:<br><br>>> ...It may have been Max Meyer who used the term "hallucination", <br>>> I apologize if I misattributed that word.<br><br>Meyer is indeed the one who called undertones "hallucinations".  As his<br>book has been long out of print and is hard to find even in libraries, I<br>give the relevant passage in full (from Meyer, "The Musician's<br>Arithmetic", p.88-90 -- the idiosyncratically frequent use of italics is<br>Meyer's):<br><br>-----------------------------------------------<br><br>"While the pretense of Rameau that his _dualistic_ theory of harmony<br>(major-minor) had a _scientific_ basis had been more or less _challenged_<br>by his contemporary, the _physicist_ D'Alembert, a later _physicist_, A.<br>von Oettingen ["Harmoniesystem in dualer Entwicklung", 1866], not only<br>_defended_ the logic of Rameau so far as mere dualism is in question, but<br>even _tried to strengthen the dualism_ by a new logical derivation of the<br>"symmetry" upon which the notion of dualism is based.<br><br>Let us at once point out, however, that the major-minor theory of<br>Oettingen is worse than Rameau's in this respect: that it fits even<br>fewer, indeed only an exceedingly small minority of, cases of musical<br>experience.<br><br>Reasoning from the fact that Rameau proposed 1-3-5 as the make-up of the<br>major chord with 1 as the chief tone, and 3-5-15 as the make-up of the<br>minor chord with 5 as the chief tone, Oettingen very unreasonably invites<br>the reader to _form the reciprocals of the latter three numbers_, that<br>is, 1/3, 1/5, 1/15.  Oettingen then gives these fractions a common<br>denominator, 15, and considers then only the numerators 5, 3 and 1 (in<br>5/15, 3/15 and 1/15); and he invites the reader to conclude that, because<br>1 thus sprang from 15 and because 1 was _the chief_ tone in the other<br>(major) case, therefore the chief tone of the minor chord 3-5-15 must be<br>the tone 15, _the father of the chief_ 1.  This would mean, for example,<br>that among the tones C-A-E heard the tone E would have to be the chief<br>tone.  Oettingen comes very near rewriting all the scores of all the<br>previously composed music in minor, for the purpose of correcting all the<br>"mistakes" made by the composers who were ignorant of his logical<br>discovery.  Musicians, of course, have not been willing to sacrifice<br>their quite different musical experiences to Oettingen's "logic".<br><br>Hugo Riemann ["Musikalische Syntaxis", 1877] alone among the musicians<br>was captivated by Oettingen's attempt at imposing the duality notion of<br>Rameau more strongly than ever upon musical thinkers, -- captivated to<br>such a degree that he even had hallucinations; for at one time he<br>asserted the existence of "undertones", corresponding to those<br>reciprocals mentioned in the previous paragraph, as the acoustical<br>counterpart of "overtones".  The major scale would then be governed by<br>overtones, the minor scale by undertones.  What a beautiful "symmetry"! <br>And not only a mysterious and speculative symmetry, but a truly<br>acoustical symmetry, strictly scientific!  Undertones versus overtones!<br><br>Unfortunately (for Riemann) acoustical science knows nothing of<br>undertones.  These hallucinatory tones would have to be mechanically<br>_multiplex_ tones in the same sense in which overtones are mechanically<br>_partial_ tones.  But this would require the imagination of a sort of<br>fourth dimension for space.  A volume of mass under tension can indeed<br>vibrate in parts of itself.  This is plain mechanics.  But how could it<br>vibrate in multiples of itself?  The multiples would have to lie in the<br>fourth, the invisible dimension.<br><br>>From all this nonsense we should learn this lesson:  We ought to abstain<br>altogether from mixing up acoustics (which is nothing but a branch of<br>mechanics) with musical theory (which concerns itself with reactions of<br>organisms equipped with nervous tissue), notwithstanding the fact that on<br>occasions a knowledge of acoustics can be very valuable to certain<br>friends and helpers of the musician, that is, to the builder of musical<br>instruments and to the physician treating larynx troubles."<br><br>-----------------------------------------------<br><br>Hopefully this last bit will provide more fodder for debate among tuning<br>folk.<br> <br>It should be observed that although Partch almost always agrees with<br>Meyer, and although he found room in "Genesis" to criticize Oettingen<br>without making particular note of the similarities of his own theories<br>with Oettingen [see p. 389], he does in fact utilize exactly Oettingen's<br>numerical method of building Utonalities.<br><br>Partch's criticism of Oettingen is only that Oettingen "held that unity<br>for the 'minor' triad was found in the first partial common to all three<br>tones.  This is of course the second 2/1 above the highest tone in the<br>triad: 3/2 in the traid 1/1 - 6/5 - 3/2...", and that "Oettingen failed<br>to consider difference tones of the minor...".  Otherwise, Partch placed<br>the same significance as Oettingen in the reciprocal proportions of the<br>"minor" chord, but without the acoustical allusions.<br><br>   Joseph L.
