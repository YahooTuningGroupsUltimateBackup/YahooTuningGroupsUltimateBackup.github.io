Can someone help?<br><br>The 12 tone equal temperament scale is derived from the overtone<br>series of a vibrating string.  Unfortunately for me, my only reference<br>on the derivation is Hindemith's Craft Of Musical Composition.  If any<br>of you have read his work, you'll all groan with me.  It's not helpful.<br>Apparently, this scale is generate by using 6 overtones, and then a few<br>approximations, which is where I get lost.  I'd be very interested in hearing<br>someone concisely construct the scale in this forum.<br><br>I think this will help me attempt to construct other scales from other<br>vibrational modes, i.e., a cylinder, a rod, a sphere, etc.  (a friend pointed<br>out that a cylinder would have two fundamentals...any comments on that?)<br><br>Thanks all.
