I found, though, that the pieces seemed to<br>turn on a kind of musical pun, to take advantage of the blurring of<br>harmonic distinctions provided by temperament.<br><br>As I read Blackwood, the point is not so much that e.t. or any<br>temperament is so much better than j.t. in any universal or absolute<br>sense, but that mainstream European musical practise at least in the<br>18th & 19th Centuries was really structured around temperament, and you<br>can't just slide j.t. into the classics and make them better. A<br>different kind of music based on j.t. might be better in some sense, but<br>the structure of composition is strongly connected to tuning, so you<br>can't change one without some adjustment in the other.<br>---<br><br>After 10 months or so of research on the subject, I have come to the<br>exact same conclusions as Mr. Kukula, and he has phrased them very<br>nicely above. For a different phrasing, though, I must once again<br>shamelessly plug my thesis, available in various forms (including HTML)<br>at<br><br>http://theremin.media.mit.edu/~bdenckla/thesis/main.html<br><br>I believe my thesis' tuning theory is an improvement upon Blackwood's,<br>although Blackwood's musical examples are very instructive and are the<br>real strength of his book.  On this particular subject, my thesis frames<br>these "puns" (a nice metaphor) as reliance on what I call A1_1<br>enharmony, which is analogous to d2 (diminished second) enharmony, i.e.<br>enharmony between notes like G# and Ab.<br><br>Ben<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com><br>Subject:  Re:deployment<br>PostedDate:  30-09-97 21:02:38<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  30-09-97 21:02:17-30-09-97 21:02:18,30-09-97 21:01:14-30-09-97 21:01:15<br>DeliveredDate:  30-09-97 21:01:15<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256522.006890AB; Tue, 30 Sep 1997 21:02:07 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02724; Tue, 30 Sep 1997 21:02:38 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 30 Sep 1997 21:02:38 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02733<br>Received: (qmail 27315 invoked from network); 30 Sep 1997 12:02:34 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 30 Sep 1997 12:02:34 -0700<br>Message-Id: <19970930190506296.AAA478@NIETZSCHE><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6253 href="#6253">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>10/9/1997 7:08:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>As I read Blackwood, the point is not so much that e.t. or any<br>>temperament is so much better than j.t.<br><br>   Strictly as a minor aside, it's probably wise to point out that "Just<br>Temperament" (which is what I presume you mean by "j.t.") is an oxymoron.<br>By definition Just Intonation is untempered.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Collins, Gordon" <CollinG@f3groups3.fsd.jhuapl.edu><br>Subject:  RE: What Is Microtonal Music?<br>PostedDate:  09-10-97 16:09:51<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  09-10-97 16:09:19-09-10-97 16:09:19,09-10-97 15:07:50-09-10-97 15:07:50<br>DeliveredDate:  09-10-97 15:07:50<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125652B.004DBF47; Thu, 9 Oct 1997 16:09:12 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12332; Thu, 9 Oct 1997 16:09:51 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 9 Oct 1997 16:09:51 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12344<br>Received: (qmail 2798 invoked from network); 9 Oct 1997 07:09:22 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 9 Oct 1997 07:09:22 -0700<br>Message-Id: <343C586E@fsdsmtpgw.fsd.jhuapl.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
