I have had it pointed out<br>to me that everything he composed for the keyboard stays in the six or seven<br>of the simplest keys, thus, a 1/6 comma meantone would provide the maximum<br>amount of consonance. <br>    However,   during the Beethoven temperament project,  I got a chance to<br>listen to a variety of temperaments used for a variety of music, and it seems<br>that on Mozart sounded better on a tuning such as the Kirnberger III than on<br>the modified meantone.  The meantone just was too plain lifeless.  <br>     Maybe it would be better to approach it from  the standpoint of "Anything<br>but ET!" <br>Regards, <br>Ed Foote<br>Precision Piano Works <br>Nashville, Tn.</div>
