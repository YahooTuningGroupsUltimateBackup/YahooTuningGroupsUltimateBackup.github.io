It just now seems to have started working though -<br>just as abruptly as it stopped.  Hmmm...<br><br>   But anyway, now that I can get to his page, I think I see more answers<br>to my questions than I realized previously.  First of all, I had forgotten<br>about the column in his tables that describe the types of tone generation<br>(sampling, FM, etc.) it supports.<br><br>   I'd like to verify something though:  If I understand your definitions<br>correctly, John, "keyboard scales" mean completely arbitrary tunings<br>key-for-key (within the resolution and range of the instrument), right?  I<br>think I must have misread that definition the last time I looked at your<br>web page.)<br><br>   This is a great web site, by the way.<br><br>   In any case though, I'm definitely interested in you folks' personal<br>recommendations in particular (i.e., not only which synthesizers have that<br>ability).</div><h3><a id=8015 href="#8015">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;jloffink&#x22; &#x3C;jloffink@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/1998 8:38:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>    Do any of you folks have recommendations for your favorite synthesizer<br>> capable of building sounds from scratch, and also having at least one<br>> user-specifiable completely arbitrary tuning table?<br>> <br>IMHO the best sounding of the new DSP type synthesizers is the Korg<br>Prophecy.  In many cases I think it sounds better than the old analog<br>synthesizers they're trying to emulate.  The Prophecy is monophonic, but<br>Korg now has the Z1 which is 12 note polyphonic, expandable to 18 notes,<br>and fairly expensive.  It has only one full keyboard tuning table, but you<br>can save global settings to a PCMCIA card.<br><br>The only other real alternative is Yamaha's discontinued SY77, TG77 or SY99<br>which featured their final and most powerful version of FM synthesis<br>coupled with resonant filters.  They had 2 global tables, floppy disk and<br>cartridge storage.  I haven't demoed these keyboards, though.<br><br>There isn't anything else that fits your criteria.  Yamaha's VL series are<br>mono or duophonic.  Kyma is more of a computer synthesis workstation than a<br>traditional synthesizer.<br><br>If realtime control is not an issue I recommend one of the many computer<br>synthesis programs that can generate files for your sampler.  I personally<br>use Synthia Pro on my Amiga to generate sounds that couldn't be done any<br>other way.<br><br>>    I'd like to verify something though:  If I understand your definitions<br>> correctly, John, "keyboard scales" mean completely arbitrary tunings<br>> key-for-key (within the resolution and range of the instrument), right? <br>I<br>> think I must have misread that definition the last time I looked at your<br>> web page.)<br>> <br>Right.<br><br>John Loffink<br>jloffink@pdq.net</div><h3><a id=8019 href="#8019">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.

I haven't demoed these keyboards, though.<br><br>I can vouch for the extreme versatility of the SY99, which I haven't<br>come close to fully exploring yet: 6-operator FM, 45 algorithms, 16 raw <br>waveforms, independent envelopes on each operator; two resonant filters<br>and good effects unit; also sample playback and the interesting option<br>of being able to use a sampled sound as an FM modulator.<br><br>The cheaper SY/TG77 are basically the same but with fewer effects and<br>no sample RAM, along with a few other differences.  Used instruments<br>turn up regularly, in fact an SY77 was just advertised yesterday on<br>rec.music.makers.synth, which is where I found my '99 a year or so ago.<br><br>--Ken W.</div><h3><a id=8026 href="#8026">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>6/9/1998 7:53:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Thanks a megabunch for the suggestions.<br><br>   Anybody know where I could find a TG77?
