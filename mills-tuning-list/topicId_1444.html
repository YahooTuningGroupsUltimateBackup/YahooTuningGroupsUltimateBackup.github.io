Many people through the years have<br>used the thesis for reference, especially for young composers.  We are finally<br>getting around to actually publishing this thing.<br><br>We have decided to add two new chapters: one on tuning (including scordatura<br>stuff) and intonation and a second on real-time DSP in performance.<br><br>If anyone has or can recommend tuning or DSP related works for any string<br>(violin/ vla/ vcl/cb) we would be very interested in hearing from you. We<br>have several interested publishers but have not yet committed to a contract-<br>anyone submitting a piece, whether it is used or not, will get a gratis<br>copy of this thing.<br><br>Please respond directly to us at strange@sjsuvm1.sjsu.edu.<br><br>thank you very much and have a great new year!<br><br>Allen and Patricia Strange<br><br>|                          Allen Strange                                |<br>|            http://www.music.sjsu.edu/Comp/strange.html                |<br>|_______________________________________________________________________|<br>| Electro-Acoustic Music     | International Computer Music Association |<br>|        Studios             |        2040 Polk St., Suite 330          |<br>| School of Music            |        San Francisco, CA 94109           |<br>| San Jose State University  |VOX + (408) 395-2538 Fax + (408) 395-2648 |<br>| 1 Washington Square        |      Email: icma@sjsuvm1.sjsu.edu        |<br>| San Jose, CA 95192-0095    |  URL http://coos.darmouth.edu/~icma      |<br>| Telephone +(408) 924-4646  |                                          |<br>| Fax +(408) 924-4773        |     We hope to see you at the ICMC97     |<br>| <strange@sjsuvm1.sjsu.edu> |         in Thessaloniki, Greece          |<br>|                            | http://alexandros.csd.auth.gr/~icmc97/   |<br>|                            |  email:icmc97@alexandros.csd.auth.gr     |<br>|<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 28 Dec 1996 20:16 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04172; Sat, 28 Dec 1996 20:18:55 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04154<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA04650; Sat, 28 Dec 1996 11:18:48 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 28 Dec 1996 11:18:48 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.961228115459.25614A-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4429 href="#4429">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/1996 11:34:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>T. Sage Harms (3215 Lyndale Avenue South;  Minneapolis, MN  55408;  USA)<br>wrote an article in Steel Guitar World magazine issue #12, concentrating<br>mostly upon pythagorean tuning on the steel guitar.  Perhaps that's a<br>start.  <br><br>   As for the status of Justonic Tuning's software products, I *think* that<br>it's not quite out yet, because they offered to let me beta-test it.  <br><br><br>   Please forgive me if I sound overpicky or whatever, but I think<br>personally that we ought to be cautious of substituting "pure" for "just". <br>If we already have a term for a concept, I think we'd be better off not add<br>synonyms to the terminology soup.  <br><br>   Or perhaps John S. was just using the word more as a generic adjective<br>rather than as a synonym for "just"?  <br><br>   In the El Paso gig, Neil H. pointed out that he likes "pure" over "just"<br>on the grounds that it's a better description of the concept.  Well, that<br>may be a matter of perspective.  <br><br>   "Pure" is reasonable from the perspective of "beatless" harmony, but<br>some might argue that just intonation is less "pure" from the perspective<br>of having varying melodic whole- and half-step sizes in a diatonic<br>framework.  Perhaps that's a short-sighted argument, but still I think that<br>terminology ought to be based as much as possible upon historical<br>precedent.  As far as I know there is no historical precedent for a<br>specific meaning for the word "pure" in tuning theory.  <br><br>   What does everybody else think?  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 30 Dec 1996 19:10 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05295; Mon, 30 Dec 1996 19:13:15 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05291<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id KAA22362; Mon, 30 Dec 1996 10:13:12 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 30 Dec 1996 10:13:12 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009ADA0CF2DBE100.EC3B@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
