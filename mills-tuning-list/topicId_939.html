I will post the derivation of my tonalness algorithm <br>seperately, as it is mathematically painful and will be difficult to notate <br>in ASCII.<br><br>A general remark: The central pitch processor is the mechanism by which we <br>perceive a set of harmonic partials as a single note -- the virtual pitch -- <br>with an associated timbre. Just about any instrument in the symphony <br>orchestra serves as a perfect example. Whether this process is inborn or <br>acquired, some claim prenatally, is a matter of debate. Its existence is <br>not.<br><br>>how is<br>>it that you are able to decide that sine waves are "distinguished and<br>>digestable" when described in harmonic context but suddenly not so when<br>>renotated as subharmonic?<br><br>A large or infinite harmonic series of sine waves will be interpreted by the <br>central pitch processor as a single complex tone, having a clear <br>fundamental. All combination tones of the sine waves will fall into this <br>same harmonic series, reinforcing the sensation. A large subharmonic series <br>will confuse the central pitch processor, as each pair of tones implies a <br>different fundamental. Often the perfect fifth will win out due to its <br>importance in defining the virtual pitch. The combination tones of the <br>subharmonic series will not conform to the subharmonic series; in the case <br>of an large subharmonic series, they will fill up nearly all of pitch space, <br>confusing the central pitch processor further and creating lots of <br>roughness.<br><br>>(2) Or do you define as subharmonic any complex without 2^n as the lowest<br>>member?<br><br>No. A subharmonic complex is one whose relative periods can be expressed <br>with smaller integers than the relative frequencies. Clearly there is no <br>distinction for two-note complexes.<br><br>>A spacing theory would compare the notations to determine which<br>>characterization is more likely (if neither is, then the neutral<br>>characterization is chosen).<br><br>Yes, I agree -- if roughness between harmonic partials comes into play. For <br>sine waves, the subharmonic representaion is irrelevant.<br><br>>Your algorithm - and I do wish to examine it<br>>in detail - strikes me as a root direction theory (and more in the<br>>Hindemith than in the Rameau direction).<br><br>Yes, I believe it partially is that. I have found that there are already <br>successful algorithms for computing the roughness (Plomp & Levelt) aspect of <br>consonance (K&K, for example). However, I did not come across any algorithms <br>that applied the root-finding function of the central pitch processor to <br>chords in a mathematically consistent way, and tonalness -- or clearness of <br>root perception -- is the other component of consonance. So I put such an <br>algorithm together, and it's a total idealization, but is intended to be a <br>good approximation as long as some partials fall within the optimal <br>frequency range for the central pitch processor. Given more psychoacoustical <br>data, such as how the resolution of the central pitch processor varies for a <br>given set of frequencies and amplitudes, the algorithm can be easily made <br>more flexible.<br><br>>(3) You cite several psychoacoutistical certainties in support of your<br>>algorithm, I am especially curious to learn of experimental results<br>>supporting (a) "in a purely psychoacoustical sense, a chord played will<br>>evoke certain interpretations in terms of the harmonic series"; this may be<br>>what your algorithm tells me, and is a conjecture that I would like to<br>>support, but I would like to find experimental evidence in this direction<br>>(and I have encountered evidence to the contrary: see Boomsliter and Creel<br>>on the 7th partial);<br><br>My musical experience certainly differs from this; for example, how do you <br>explain the fact that a 5:6:7 diminished triad evokes the missing root of <br>the dominant seventh chord, if not for the importance of the 7th partial? <br>Terhardt has done much work in this area as well.<br><br>>(b) "the ears central pitch processor simply doesnt<br>>go that far"; I am completely confused by this: what do you mean by<br>>"central pitch processor", and how far, exactly does it go? The harmonic<br>>progression I presented, and its Pythagorean interpretation are simply too<br>>obiquitous to be dismissed in this way.<br><br>You yourself stated that the fundamental of a harmonic relationship can't be <br>too low in pitch for the relationship to be perceived; even with that <br>simplistic a model, how can you expect 54:64:81 to be perceived as such, and <br>with what root?<br><br>>(4) The sequential procedure would be something like the following: given<br>>the complex 500 Hz,<br>>600 Hz 750 Hz, the first ratio interpreted would be the 3/2 fifth of<br>>750/500, the initial interpretation would be 3/2 in a harmonic series over<br>>fundamental 250Hz; however, not finding an intermediate tone between 2 and<br>>3,  successive fifths in the series are scanned to find a similar complex,<br>>examining each n(2,3) until an intermediate tone is located that matches<br>>the complex. When, for example 10,12,15 over a fundamental of 50 Hz is<br>>selected, then it is compared with its subharmonic notation /6,/5,/4. If<br>>this characterization is more simple, then it is chosen.<br><br>Once again, there is no psychacoustic mechanism by which subharmonic <br>relationships of sine waves can be heard!<br><br>>(Need I add the<br>>fact that the difference tones of this complex are all within the spectrum<br>>of 50 Hz?<br><br>And this supports which interpretation, pray tell?<br><br>>That certain tuning<br>>systems, temperaments among them, may map onto harmonic series is probably<br>>true, but it requires a definition of intervallic tolerance that seems to<br>>me to be musically (i.e. culturally, and thus limited to particular times<br>>and places) defined, and probably outside of the domain of psychoacoustics<br>>proper:<br><br>I disagree. The definitions of intervallic tolerance are nothing more and <br>nothing less than a charcterization of the psychoacoustic phenomena which <br>distinguish just intervals -- namely, consonance. This is subdivided into <br>roughness, whose tolerance has to do with critical bands and beating; and <br>tonalness, whose tolerance has to do with the precision with which frequency <br>information is transmitted to the central pitch processor. You are correct <br>that both aspects are not independent of amplitude and duration, but that <br>just means that an algorithm such as mine would ideally have to take these <br>things into account. In principle, it is still the right way of looking at <br>things.<br><br>>Your statement _the ear doesnt continue its harmonic series math from<br>>one chord to the next_ is unsupported, and probably unsupportable.<br><br>I did not mean for it to be taken in such a strong sense. Clearly there are <br>strong elements of commonality between one chord and the next when their <br>relationship is a simple one; the dominant-to-tonic progression is a case in <br>point. And clearly the central pitch processor can extract some information <br>on virtual pitch from non-simultaneous tones -- the virtual pitch mechanism <br>is not dependent on phenomena associated with exact simultaneity, such as <br>difference tones. But while the difference between a 9:8 and a 10:9 is easy <br>to perceive harmonically, when these intervals represent the melodic <br>intervals between the roots of non-adjacent chords in a progression, the <br>difference comes down to how the progressions are handled on paper.<br><br>>(7) I cannot resist a few more remarks on the subharmonic. First, although<br>>for musical purposes we never need get past fairly small numbers, while<br>>every harmonic complex  may be renotated as subharmonic and vice versa, due<br>>to one of those nice paradoxes in the fundamentals of mathematics - and<br>>beyond my ability to explain - the number of members in the harmonic series<br>>is greater than that in the subharmonic series.<br><br>What does this sentence mean? And I have a good knowledge of mathematics, <br>fundamental and otherwise -- what on earth are you talking about?<br><br>>Second, the _descent to the<br>>infinitesimal_ represents to me a series of increasingly complex - indeed,<br>>counterintuitive - calculations, hence my speculation about increased<br>>mental activity. The ascription of quantum effects to the infinitesimal<br>>comes from the intuitionist C. Hennix, resident mathematician at the<br>>Institute for Psychoanalysis in Paris;<br><br>Is this in a context relevant to music, or any other real-world <br>applications? I'll bet my hat it's pseudo-scientific drivel.<br><br>>Third, musical examples of the<br>>subharmonic are readily available in the repertoire, cf Martin Vogels book<br>>on the _Tristan_ chord, or this little example from the Rondo K.494, m<br>>164-165, where the left hand sustains for two measures the chord c4 d4 f4<br>>ab4, which moves (does not resolve) to c4 f4 a4, i.e subharmonic seventh<br>>chord from c moving to f major 6-4. Mozart uses this chord, here and<br>>elsewhere, in a voice leading distinctive from his use of diminished and<br>>dominant seventh chords. By my spacing characterization, the fourth c-f<br>>would be too important to overlook, and the traditional (in American<br>>practice) _half diminished_ description seems not very useful.  If this<br>>were in just intonation, I would choose a subharmonic characterization /8<br>>/7 /6 /5 over the harmonic 105 120 140 175.  I am curious to learn how<br>>Pauls algorithm will interpret this chord (16 18 21 26? or 24 27 32 38?).<br><br>I strongly agree that subharmonic characterizations can be useful in musical <br>practice and to the future development of music. But the essence of this <br>characterization lies in the partials, which acheive minimum roughness when <br>the fundamentals are arranged in _either_ a harmonic or a subharmonic <br>series. My algorithm deals not with roughness but with tonalness, and <br>ascribes no harmonic interpretation of c4 d4 f4 ab4 more than a negligible <br>amount of certainty. For a coarse enough frequency resolution, 9:10:12:14 <br>would win out, but still by a negligible amount. Both the 3:4 interpretation <br>of c4 f4 and the 5:8 interpretation of c4 ab4 will be more powerful; <br>therefore the chord will not be heard as a single harmonic complex.<br><br>Let me reiterate my view of the equal-tempered minor triad with harmonic <br>partials. I would tend to characterize it as a subharmonic complex, since <br>(a) the level of roughness is similar to that of a major triad, and thus a <br>near-local-minimum, due to the individual intervals being close to 3:2, 5:4, <br>and 6:5 and (b) several possible harmonic representations accodring to my <br>algorithm (10:12:15, 16:19:24) lead to essentially the same interpretation: <br>that of a perfect fifth with an added non-harmonic note. Since the exact <br>numbers in (a) are clearly more important than the exact numbers in (b), the <br>former should be included in an overarching representation, thus: <br>1/6:1/5:1/4. If a chord has favorable roughness characteristics but only <br>tolerable tonalness characteristics, it just might be a subharmonic complex.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 27 Sep 1996 22:39 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02198; Fri, 27 Sep 1996 22:39:33 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02799<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA00329; Fri, 27 Sep 1996 13:39:32 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 27 Sep 1996 13:39:32 -0700<br>Message-Id: <22960927203522/0005695065PK3EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3706 href="#3706">ðŸ”—</a>PAULE &#x3C;ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/1996 12:19:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>..................................continued from last week.<br><br>According to Golstein[22], the precision with which freqency information is <br>transmitted to the brain's central pitch processor is between 0.6% and 1.2% <br>within a certain optimal frequency range. Musical tones normally have <br>partials within this range, and since harmonic partials are integer <br>multiples of thier fundamentals, they will yield the same <br>ratio-interpretation for their fundamentals as would the fundamentals <br>transposed into this range. (This is why we did not worry about overtones in <br>the first place.) We can therefore model the tones with normal probability <br>distributions in log-frequency space; the standard deviation (let's call it <br>s) used can be between 0.6% and 1.2%, or greater to reflect various <br>non-ideal conditions. The use of log-frequency space corresponds most <br>closely with psychoacoustic research and musical practice.<br><br>Now the "width" in 17,<br><br>	    log(a(j))-log(b(j))<br><br>represents a section of log-freqeuncy space and thus a portion of the <br>distribution lies within this range. The exact amount of probability <br>contained withing this range is thus the certainty with which u=f(1)/f(2) is <br>interpreted as p(j)/q(j), and is proportional to<br><br>	    1/(s*sqrt(2pi))*integral(exp(-.5((x-log(u))/s)^2),dx)<br><br>in log-frequency space. Now the width in (19) vanishes for large N, but it <br>remains proportional to 1/L(j), so (replacing the integral by a product <br>since W is small compared to s) we define the certainty with which u is <br>intepreted as p(j)/q(j) as<br><br>	    C(u,p(j)/q(j))=1/(s*sqrt(2pi)L(j))*exp(-.5((log(p(j)/q(j))-log(u))/s)^2  <br>)	   (20)<br><br>(20) can be extended to chords of more than two notes as follows: A chord of <br>n notes contains n(n-1)/2 different intervals. But since the whole chord <br>must be related to a single fundamental, any individual interval might not <br>be in lowest terms, and the "limit" should now be the greatest of all the <br>odd factors of the numbers used to represent the chord. Denote this limit by <br>L(t); we therefore define<br><br>	    NC(L(j,t))=NC(L(j))L(j)/L(t)<br><br>We then have<br><br>	    C(chord)=product over all intervals(C(L(j,t))^(2/n))<br><br>where the exponent 2/n is the number of independent degrees of freedom in <br>tuning the chord, n-1, divided by the number of factors in the product, <br>n(n-1)/2. This is done becuse multiplying probabilities of n-1 independent <br>judgments is the probablity of the overall judgment; the exponent is thus a <br>correction for the fact that the number of intervals increases faster than <br>the number of notes. In other words, take the geometric mean certainty, and <br>multiply it by itself a number of times appropriate to the true number of <br>degrees of freesom. This effectively reduces the standard deviation s by a <br>fatcor 1/(sqrt(n-1)), as one would guess from general statistical <br>considerations.<br><br>As for finding the roots of chords, Parncutt states,[23]<br><br>	    The pitch pattern of a complex tone may be recognized even if parts of <br>the pattern are<br>	    missing, or extra elements are added. Similarly . . .the root of a <br>chord may be<br>	    perceived if notes corresponding to harmonics of the root are missing, <br>or if notes not<br>	    corresponding to harmonics are added. For example, the root of the C <br>major triad is<br>	    weakened, but not changed, if the note E (which corresponds to the <br>fifth harmonic of<br>	    C) is replaced by Eb (which doesn't correspond to any normally audible <br>harmonic of C);<br>	    the root (C) is maintained by the strong root implication of the fifth <br>C-G.<br><br>So a good guess would be that for a four-note chord, whichever of its two, <br>three, or four-note subgroups has an interpretation of the gretest C-value <br>is the subgroup that determines the root; the root itself is the note <br>interpreted as a power of 2, since it is then octave-equivalent to the <br>fundamental. If none of the notes of the chord are interpreted as a power of <br>two, the chord seems unstable, as the sensation of the fundamental is quite <br>secure.<br><br><br>[13] Adapted from van Eck, C.
