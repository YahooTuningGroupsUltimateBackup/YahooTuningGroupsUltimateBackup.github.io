Unlike the fretted<br>instruments, the piano can perform as well in one harmonic arrangement as<br>another.  <br>    If a JI piano means having keys that are not in the 7/5 arrangement, then<br>you have the costs of new keys, which in a retrofit job on a piano, such as a<br>"six-six" scheme, and can cost thousands of dollars.  If you need more keys to<br>the octave, I cannot begin to offer what the cost would be, but it is a<br>problem that has been attacked for hundreds of years.  <br>     The popularity of ET in Western music is due, (IMHO)  to the loss of<br>interest in tonality.  With renewed interest in tonality today, the<br>alternatives to ET are becoming more prevelant.  Computer-equipped keyboard<br>tuners, such as myself, now are having a lot easier time offering customers a<br>choice in temperament and the results are encouraging.  <br>Regards, <br>Ed Foote <br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn. <br>http://www.airtime.co.uk/forte/history/edfoote.html</div>
