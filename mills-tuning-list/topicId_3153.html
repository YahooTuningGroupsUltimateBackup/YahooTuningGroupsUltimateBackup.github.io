Most JI investigators find that<br>>}each odd or prime outlines a new, broad class of harmony.  I personally<br>>}think that there's a lot of truth in that idea, but that there are many<br>>}other factors that have to be considered, some with about equal weight.<br>><br>>Actually, the two definitions of limit are: 1. the largest prime number in<br>>the frequency ratios in the tuning; 2. the largest odd number in ratios that<br>>are considered consonant in the composition. Harry Partch never defined the<br>>term limit but used it mostly in the second sense. He did occasionally imply<br>>the first sense, which has come to dominate current discourse. When dealing<br>>with temperaments, the first definition has little relevance, while the<br>>second can have great relevance in the context of the ratios that the<br>>temperament needs to approximate well.</div>
