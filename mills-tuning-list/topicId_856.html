If it don't <br>resolve to I major it ain't bbshop.<br><br>>That is as opposed to a plagal cadence (for example) which in C major is FAC to CEG.  Or as opposed to (probably) the most common form of <br>deceptive cadence:  GBDF to ACE.<br><br>This would be The 11 oclk=IV7 to I major...the churchchord resolution...a <br>fine way to end a song. GBDF to ACE is resolving(?) to a 6th..frowned on <br>in bbshop.<br><br>>    Obviously you can transpose those progressions into whatever key you'd like. <br>>    That progression (the authentic cadence) is extremely common in Western music as a whole, but I seem to recall - again, perhaps <br>incorrectly - that virtually all chords in barbershop work are (dominant) <br>seventh chords.  In that case you would not technically have an authentic <br>cadence, since the tonic chord would be a seventh chord.  (That could be <br>used as a fragment of a chain of secondary dominants, but perhaps I ought <br>not get into that.)<br><br>Yeah, you ought to leave this alone since it doesn't seem that you've <br>ever heard bbshop harmony. 95% of bbshop chrds consist of 1: major <br>triads;2: 7ths;3: minor 7ths(flat 3rd)4: minor 7ths flat 5;5: and least, <br>minor triads. Good bbshop should contain at least 35% 7ths and less than <br>5% of diminished chrds=root,flat 3rd,flat 5th,flat 7th(6th).<br><br><br>Ed Dotson<br>ldotson@sprynet.com<br>73757.1062@compuserve.com<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 06:51 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA28941; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 06:52:31 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29010<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA22325; Sun, 8 Sep 1996 21:52:29 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 8 Sep 1996 21:52:29 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960909044939_71670.2576_HHB45-13@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
