I even like 12.  I am<br>>>always amazed at how good it sounds, and at how powerful it is...<br>><br>>Okay, so to you, 12-TET tunings are powerful (and this is cause for<br>>amazement, presumably because of the high integer ratios it employs)<br><br>I call it powerful because it gets a lot done with only 12 pitches.  There<br>is a difference between consonance and utility.  12et's intervals aren't<br>very consonant, but they do provide a huge musical framework for being only<br>12 (providing 144 of Partch's "senses").<br><br>>>Consonance is a factor of the size the number in an intervals ratio.<br>><br>>In a sense, yes, because the interval itself is a factor of the sizes of<br>>the numbers in the ratio.<br><br>What?<br><br>>But in another sense, no: the Random House Dictionary and the New Harvard<br>>Dictionary of Music agree that consonance is a factor of cultural<br>conventions >and the "mind of the beholder" (or the musical equivalent of that).<br><br>Here's your problem!  You are using the Random House Dictionary and New<br>Harvard Dictionary of Music as references.  Consonance is not a factor of<br>the mind, it is an acoustic phenomenon having to do with the superposition<br>of waveforms.  Make the perception of this phenomenon as subjective as you like.<br><br>>>An interval 16 cents flat of the sublime 6/5 has frequency ratio<br>>>19723/16585.  This, of course, is our quite dissonant 12et minor third.<br>><br>>So, 6/5 is sublime, and 19723/16585 is quite dissonant, yet powerful.<br><br>I did not call any interval in 12 equal powerful.  I called the tuning<br>powerful.  If you listen to the 300 cent third, you can hear it beat.  This<br>is dissonance.<br><br>>>An interval 18 cents flat of the 6/5 bears ratio 19/16.  It is a very<br>>>consonant minor third found in the duple 16-32 of the harmonic series...<br>><br>>And 19/16 is very consonant.<br><br>It seems this comment was designed to make fun of me, based on your<br>Random-House-school-of-Cognitive-Psychology definition of consonance.  If<br>consonance is so subjective, why don't you offer a description of the 19/16?<br>What's that?  You've never heard it?<br><br>>Colleagues of the tuning list, the evidence suggests that musical beauty<br>>is in the ear of the hearer.<br><br>All forms of beauty are subjective.  That this is so, I think, is beautiful.<br><br>>I see many claims that low integer ratios produce more "natural" and<br>"perfect" >harmonies, but little proof that people actually respond this way.<br><br>The fact that you've heard many claims seems to suggest that people respond<br>that way.  For more evidence, check out Arthur Benade's "Special<br>Relationships" study, written up in his book "The Fundamentals of Musical<br>Acoustics" and in Doty's excellent "Just Intonation Primer".<br><br>Or you could do your own study.  I've done demos with over 15 people and<br>have yet to find someone who doesn't prefer his subjective experience of<br>Just Intervals.<br><br>Or you might ask why a capella choirs sing in Just Intonation.  You can't<br>get any more direct a measure of how humans like their sound than how they<br>tend to use their voices in a group.<br><br>>This makes the tuning list sometimes read like some medieval treatise on<br>the >nature of God.  Why be amazed then, that the Devil incarnate, 12TET,<br>wields >such power?<br><br>I don't know who we've got on this thing, but I thought it was more than<br>numerologists.  There's nothing inherently good about the low integers.<br>Tuning to them only makes sense because they occur in the timbres of most<br>acoustic instruments.  If you have an instrument (like the Hammond Organ)<br>that produces tempered harmonics, then it would be a mistake to tune it in<br>Just Intonation (it's also impossible to re-tune tonewheel organs).<br><br>As for my use of "amazed", you've probably got me.  I'm actually amazed at<br>how such beautiful patterns can come out of almost any tuning, Just or not.<br>That's why I got into Xenharmonics.  Not because I was on a numerological<br>crusade, but because tuning can be one of the most powerful resources for<br>musicians.<br><br>Carl<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  James Kukula <kukula@synopsys.com><br>Subject:  MIDI file formats<br>PostedDate:  21-10-97 19:53:32<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  21-10-97 19:52:45-21-10-97 19:52:46,21-10-97 18:53:24-21-10-97 18:53:24<br>DeliveredDate:  21-10-97 18:53:24<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256537.0062332E; Tue, 21 Oct 1997 19:52:36 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA23110; Tue, 21 Oct 1997 19:53:32 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 21 Oct 1997 19:53:32 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA23124<br>Received: (qmail 6851 invoked from network); 21 Oct 1997 10:53:28 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 21 Oct 1997 10:53:28 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199710211747.KAA11860@sunatg3><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6322 href="#6322">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl</h3><span>10/22/1997 7:39:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Here is the MIDI filespec:<br>http://www.cs.ruu.nl/pub/MIDI/DOC/midifile<br><br>You can do several things:<br><br>- Write a program to write a midifile directly.<br>Then I would advice to look at the source code of existing programs for<br>examples. Here's one: http://www.cs.ruu.nl/pub/MIDI/PROGRAMS/mf2tsrc.zip<br>The next possibility will be easier.<br><br>- Write a program to write a text representation of a midifile that also<br>inserts pitchbend commands.<br>Then you can convert it to a midifile with T2MF (I don't know if<br>that's the same program that Kami mentioned; also in the Scala zip file).<br>The next possibility will also be easier.<br><br>- Write a program to write a text representation of a midifile without<br>inserting pitchbend commands.<br>Then convert it to a midifile with TXT2MF and subsequently convert the<br>midifile to a retuned midifile with Scala inserting the pitchbend<br>commands. Everything that Scala does, can also be done<br>noninteractively. You can run it from a .bat file and put the Scala<br>commands in the startup.cmd file. This also has the advantage that you<br>can use the same midifile for different tunings.<br><br>- Write a program to write a Scala sequence file. This may still be<br>slightly easier but it gives you less control over the result since<br>not all midi messages are supported. This is similar to Kami's<br>xen2txt utility.<br><br>- Write a program to write Csound files. Csound also works<br>noninteractively and gives you much more control over the sound,<br>better tuning precision and has none of the midi limitations.<br>It produces soundfiles, not midifiles. This however takes a lot of<br>computing time so you will have to be patient to hear the results.<br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
