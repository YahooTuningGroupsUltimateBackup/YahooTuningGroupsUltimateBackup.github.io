Reinhard and others</h1><h3><a id=3916 href="#3916">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;106232.3266@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/1996 12:45:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I am extremely sceptical about **whipping out the appropriate fingering**<br>and **sight reading** a score in just intonation. I just cannot imagine how<br>such an attitude towards rehearsal will bring out the qualitative aspects<br>of the intervals that I want to hear. To this end, I am willing to side<br>with Lou Harrison, who has argued that the _Allegro_ is the greatest<br>problem for just intonation (and probably only possible on instruments with<br>fixed pitch, tuned prior to the performance), as well as cite La Monte<br>Young, who observed that the accuracy of tuning is a function of the<br>sampling period, and was willing to go exclusively with extremely slow<br>tempi in order to assure more accuracy in intonation. And in practical<br>terms, a perfect fifth 3/2 is something I can really hear but 700 cents is<br>- without a metronome or watch in hand to count the beats - a real<br>abstraction. (I should note in this regard that Klarenz Barlow found it<br>necessary to use the 11/8 interval in order to tune quartertones with any<br>precision for his piano piece, _Chog^luotobuesishletmesi_). (I look forward<br>to seeing how that title passes through the internet).<br><br>Daniel Wolf<br>Daniel Wolf, Frankfurt  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 4 Nov 1996 22:16 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03963; Sun, 3 Nov 1996 19:03:04 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07102<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id KAA07856; Sun, 3 Nov 1996 10:03:01 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 3 Nov 1996 10:03:01 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961103175925_71670.2576_HHB64-9@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
