The importance of this<br>article should not be underestimated.<br>While some members of this tuning forum consider<br>Erv Wilson's CPS tunings "just another approach,"<br>the truth is that Wilson's CPS approach offers<br>a number of unique advantages found in only a<br>few other methods of generating and modulating<br>through just intonation scales.<br>Paul's article touches on some of these advantages<br>(order the back issue of MusicWorks 60 from Gayle<br>Young if you want more info) and uniquely offers<br>a number of excellent geometrical models that make<br>the tunings remarkably easy to visualize.  Even Erv<br>has not drawn his CPS ratio-space structures as<br>well as the photographs present them in Paul's<br>remarkable article.<br>Equally impressive is Paul's MusicWorks 43 article<br>"Some Temperaments are More Equal than Others--<br>and Decidedly More Temperamental."  This is the<br>best single article introduction to xenharmonic<br>equal temperaments, along with Ivor Darreg's<br>Xenharmonic Bulletin Number 5.   However, Paul's<br>article covers more ground and covers it with<br>extraordinary lucidity.  In particular, the<br>open-mindedness with which Paul approaches<br>different divisions of the octave is a splendid<br>change from the usual "good tuning/bad tuning"<br>categorization of Hall, Stoney, Yunik & Swift,<br>von Foerster, et al.<br>This article, along with the 1978 "Tempo" <br>article "Toward the Infinite Expansion of<br> Tonal Resources," is in my "beginner's packet"<br>of xeroxes that get sent out to everyone who<br>contacts me for more info about non-12<br>tunings.<br>However, Paul's most important contribution<br>to date is  "The Notation of Thirds and Fifths<br>In Equal Temperaments," in J. Mus. Theory,<br>1993, along with its companion article "The<br>Notation of Equal Temperaments" in Xenharmonikon<br>16, 1995.<br>These are really two halves of a single monumental<br>article which treats in superb detail not only the<br>notation, but also the melodic and harmonic properties,<br>of the entire range of equal temperaments.<br>Paul proves a number of important results:  for example,<br>that as long as the Pythagorean komma is positive,<br>the fifth in any scale can never be higher than<br>700 cents. He also investigates in remarkable<br>detail the progression of fifths for any p as<br>the number of tones per octave increases without<br>limit.<br>To my knowledge, no previous theorist has discussed<br>this issue in the detail and with the comprehensive<br>intelligence Paul Rapoport has shown in this article.<br>Paul also shows how and why the pythagorean komma<br>can take on values greater than 11.  This is a startling<br>idea in 12-TET, but can easily occur for large numbers<br>of tones per octave.<br>Paul also points out that Easley Blackwood's *music*<br>as opposed to his theories) "also suggests accepting<br>or even transcending these limits under some<br>conditions, despite the odd Pythagorean relationships<br>that result."  This is a superb example of Paul's prescient<br>recognition that music theory only goes so far.  Beyond<br>a certain point, the ears must stand as final arbiters.<br>As Ludwig Wittgenstein put it in the Tractatus Logico-<br>Philosophicus: ""My propositions serve as elucidations<br>in the following way: anyone who understands me<br>eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he<br>has used them--as steps--to climb up beyond them.<br>(He must, so to speak, throw away the latter after<br>he has climbed it.)" [Wittgenstein, L., "Tractatus<br>Logico-Philosphicus," 6.54, 1921]<br>But this is not the end of Rapoport's contributions <br>to music theory: it is only the beginning. <br>Paul describes not just one but several methods<br>of determining the divisions of the octave in which<br>the fifth is not recognizable.  This significantly<br>extends Blackwood's work. <br>Paul also points out that "Suppose we wish to <br>write music for the tuning having the lowest a<br>with a certain number of v's (thus the same <br>number of p's), for some basic p.  We cannot<br>easily determine which p's there will be in the<br>unknown a.  There are two methods for determining<br>the lowest a in accordance with what we have<br>developed so far."  He derives a set of formulas<br>which apply to various numbers of tones per octave,<br>all unprecedented (to the best of my knowledge). <br>Paul also constructs a numebr of fascinating<br>t<br>ever, to my knowledge, compiled by<br>previous theorists.  <br>Paul also defines fomulas which yield the <br>best t in a given division of the octave.  <br>A related question, the problem of determining <br>in general how many fifths there are in <br>a third (ignoring octaves) Paul tackles by<br>using Euler's theorem.  This again is an<br>orioginal result and extremely valuable.<br>To date no other articles have dealt with<br>the relationship between thirds and fifths<br>in equal temperaments to the extent and<br>withthe insight as Paul's two papers on the<br>subject.<br>Anyone who misguidedly imagines that my<br>critique of his bibliographies equates to<br>a criticism of Paul Rapoport's superb and<br>extremely insightful music theoretical<br>work is badly mistaken.<br>In fact, Paul Rapoport is one of the master<br>theorists of the equal temperaments.  Few<br>xenharmonists can claim to equal, and<br>none surpass, his signal achivements in this<br>area.<br>--mclaren<br>   <br><br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 17 Aug 1996 23:13 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14027; Sat, 17 Aug 1996 23:56:04 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14070<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id OAA11194; Sat, 17 Aug 1996 14:56:03 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 17 Aug 1996 14:56:03 -0700<br>Message-Id: <00AAD094.fc@nile.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
