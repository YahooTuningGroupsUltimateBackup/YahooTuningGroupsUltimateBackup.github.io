Some ancient<br>authors admit that there are intervals which somewhat resemble the<br>consonances of the 4th, 5th and Octave, but are different. These<br>intervals are the 3rds, 6ths and the tritone. The 7/6 may have<br>been an important interval in the enharmonic genus, at least at the<br>time of Archytas. While the Greeks had a form of heterophonic<br>accompaniment, I think it's fair to say that there is no good<br>evidence for triadic harmony or even texture in the ancient world.<br><br><br>The recent discussion on the classification of temperaments,<br>tunings and scales presupposes that 12-tet is the standard,<br>that the Fifth is the generator of the scale and that we are<br>interested in diatonic (7-tone) and chromatic (12-tone) scales.<br>If say 19-tet and the 12-tone MOS generated by 11 degrees were<br>the norm, the classification would be somewhat different. Similarly,<br>one might use a 5-tone subset of 7-tet (Colin Brown's) or a 5-tone<br>cycle (one of Wilson's patented keyboards). See his articles<br>in XH2 and XH3, and, of course Bosanquet's original work on the<br>general theory of the octave and the generalized keyboard.<br><br>In the Bosanquetian scheme, temperaments are defined as positive or<br>negative to various "orders" according to the number of degrees<br>separating B# from C (or in other words, is the Pythagorean comma<br>positive or negative and by how many degrees of the temperament?).<br>Bosanquet calls this parameter "r." The neutral system is 12-tet<br>where the fifth has 700 cents and the PC (DC) has 0 degrees (r=0).<br><br>Another parameter, the number of units separating C from C# defines the<br>system as "singulary," binary, ternary, etc. according to Wilson's<br>terminology. This parameter is equivalent to selecting the diatonic<br>scale as the basic scale in the temperament. For some reason, it<br>appears to have no accepted name as far as I can tell; one might call<br>it "s" from "Seven-Fifths' semitone."  (Seven-tet would be the<br>"zero-ary" system where C=C#.)<br><br>Relative to 19, the first positive series is 12, 31, 50; relative<br>to 5, it is 3, 8, 13; and relative to 7, 5, 12, 19. If for some<br>reason one took 13-tet, 8 degrees and the 8-tone MOS as the norm,<br>8, 21, 34 and 47 would be the first positive series and 5,18 and<br>31 the first negative. In each case, the role of the PC is taken<br>by a chain generators equal to the number of the neutral system<br>(19, 5,7, 13 etc.) and the<br><br>These two parameters are sufficient to classify all temperaments in a<br>2-D array from which one can deduce a usable notation and keyboard<br>variety. Thus, this theory is not entirely abstract.<br><br>--John<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com><br>Subject:  phonons, speculation<br>PostedDate:  31-12-97 22:14:45<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  31-12-97 22:12:24-31-12-97 22:12:25,31-12-97 22:11:47-31-12-97 22:11:49<br>DeliveredDate:  31-12-97 22:11:49<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125657E.00747AA2; Wed, 31 Dec 1997 22:14:12 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10086; Wed, 31 Dec 1997 22:14:45 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 31 Dec 1997 22:14:45 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10155<br>Received: (qmail 1811 invoked from network); 31 Dec 1997 13:14:36 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 31 Dec 1997 13:14:36 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.96.971231131352.8465A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
