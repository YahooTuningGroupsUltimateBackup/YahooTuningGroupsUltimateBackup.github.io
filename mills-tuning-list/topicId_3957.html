Very limited no. of parameters are accessible from there<br>though.<br><br>Last night I suddenly realised that each channel can be microtuned<br>differently!<br>Yup, ea. of the 16 channels can hold a different "scale tuning". I<br>checked.<br>So, though the method of shifting the pitch of one side of the keyboard<br>split works for a number of tunings, I don't have to do that, I can just<br>set up<br>a different tuning for each side.<br><br>Now:<br>Beware, beware, be very, very, ware of your synth's pitch bend and <br>RPN fine tune parameters. It would appear that manufacturers are pretty<br>nonchalant with their implementation of these parameters. <br>No using pretty spreadsheets to generate values.<br><br>Following my boo-boo mistaking the +/- 64 scale tuning for 64ths of a<br>semitone,<br>and then realising Yamaha had actually documented it correctly as <br>actual cents, I decided to check ALL pitch parameters using SysEx and<br>Hansruedi Baer's Digital Oscilloscope Version 2.1 . I recommend everyone<br>with<br>a Mac (PowerMac&68k) get it (& those without go look for one). It's<br>freeware ! <br>An Oscilloscope and Frequency meter rolled into one. Very nice. Not a<br>toy, but<br>simple enough for the Xenharmonic/Allotonic neophytes among us,<br> like yours truly.<br><br>I figured out the SysEx messages for all the Pitch related parameters in<br>the PSR-530,<br>there are a total of  8. And most seem to work as advertised in the<br>manual. <br>The multipart detune parameter is (-12.8..+12.7 [Hz]), and being Hz, it<br>works<br>logarithmically, i.e., when set to the max +12.7, all keys don't go up<br>12.7Hz, only<br>the B key does. The C key goes up @ 6.7Hz.  <br><br>Pitch bend, I checked with the range at 1-semitone and <br>found no clear pattern in the data values that caused each successive<br>pitch change.<br>Graham Breed mentioned he does this and<br>David Finnamore posted a note cautioning about it, you HAVE to check <br>the frequency of the bends against actual cent frequency equivalents.<br>The <br>pitch bend implementation in the PSR appears to be quite coarse. <br>The RPN channel Fine Tune parameter is very odd, completely ignoring<br>the LSB, and going from the equivalent of (-100  to +98 cents). <br>So, here again, it it means checking for the desired pitch.<br><br> And the SysEx (SYSTEM) Master Tune parameter (-102.4..+102.3Hz) doesn't<br>appear to yield any more accuracy than the MIDI Master Tune<br>(-100..+100cent)<br>parameter. I was trying to use it to get the pitch of the C key to 256Hz<br>which means <br>going down @ 37.63 Hz, but the best it gets to is @256.25Hz.<br><br>BTW, I adopted Joe Monzo's system of tuning the fundamental, and refer<br>to it as the <br>Monzo Fundamental, so if there isn't another name for it, and it's o.k.<br>with you,<br>Joseph..... We haven't heard a peep out of you lately, must be the road<br>trip, <br> you around or too busy burning asphalt ?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Drew</div><h3><a id=8440 href="#8440">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/1998 1:18:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Thu, 3 Sep 1998, it was written:<br>>I have nearly completed my custom MIDI keyboard ( final year electronic project<br>>at university ).

Equally tempered scales are examined<br>that have a larger number (19 or 31) of notes.
