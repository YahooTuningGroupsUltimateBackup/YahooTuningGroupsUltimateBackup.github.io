Tunings are a really good way to<br>inject freshness into the dated 12 eq syndrome...we do need, of course,<br>killer music in these new tunings, and meaningful compositions as well;<br>but, the time is here, and I think we forum folks can play a large part<br>in this change. There's a lot of genius on this site, a lot of good<br>theorist and performers as well. Again, I think the more festivals around<br>the world, the better; we're in our 3rd year with Microstock, we get good<br>press, and it's not too expensive to put on...some of you guys with good<br>day gigs ought to invest a few hundred bucks, and get some concerts<br>happening where you live...I'll come play cheap, and even try to help out<br>with the press work...may we all keep moving into new and uncharted<br>realms of music...Hstick<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  jszanto@adnc.com<br>Subject:  Re: pop in microtones<br>PostedDate:  22-09-97 10:18:24<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  22-09-97 10:18:13-22-09-97 10:18:13,22-09-97 10:17:21-22-09-97 10:17:22<br>DeliveredDate:  22-09-97 10:17:22<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C125651A.002D9A02; Mon, 22 Sep 1997 10:18:05 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03885; Mon, 22 Sep 1997 10:18:24 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 22 Sep 1997 10:18:24 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03883<br>Received: (qmail 16239 invoked from network); 22 Sep 1997 08:18:19 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 22 Sep 1997 08:18:19 -0000<br>Message-Id: <3.0.2.32.19970922011220.0069b1c0@adnc.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
