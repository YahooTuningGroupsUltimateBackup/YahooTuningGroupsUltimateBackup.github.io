I read John's post as using "just" and "pure" as exact<br>synonyms.  I then responded with my opinion that I can see no point in<br>adding "pure" into the vocabulary soup if the word "just" already has that<br>meaning.  <br><br>   Clearly though John did not in fact intend them as exact synonyms.  I'm<br>not sure if I follow the distinction he's suggesting between the two. <br>Something about diatonic frameworks in particular?  Can you give an example<br>of a kind of music, tuning, or instrument that you would describe as "just"<br>but not "pure", or the reverse?  How would you characterize a tuning based<br>on fragments of the harmonic series in those two terms (i.e., simple WNRs,<br>but not diatonic)?  <br><br>   Or perhaps it's not terribly important in the first place.  <br><br>   I'm starting to think it may be best to try to use "untempered", since:<br>1.  That word, or at least its opposite "tempered", has a specific<br>historical<br>    meaning.<br>2.  As we discovered several months ago, at least one authoritative<br>dictionary<br>    (New Harvard) has a strange notion of the meaning of the term "Just <br>    Intonation".  (It also uses the word "pure" without defining it, by the<br><br>    way.)<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 2 Jan 1997 00:11 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06495; Thu, 2 Jan 1997 00:13:54 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06500<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id PAA28574; Wed, 1 Jan 1997 15:13:23 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 1 Jan 1997 15:13:23 -0800<br>Message-Id: <32CA4259.59FB@ix.netcom.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
