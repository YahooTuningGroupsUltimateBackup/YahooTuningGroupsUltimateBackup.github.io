This<br>> is a perfectly useless definition. I know many computer music<br>> composers and not a single one works this way.<br><br>i've done a lot of "experimenting" with algorithmic composition (i like using<br>symbolic composer, as much as i wish it were interactive rather than a<br>compiler) and i find myself editing the resulting material "by hand" (or by<br>ear, rather).  that is, the output of the algorithm is not at all completely<br>satisfactory to me, so i interactively modify the results in my sequencer<br>according to my musical taste, rather than try to modify the algorithm to<br>produce the desired changes.  the exact deviation from the algorithm is hard to<br>characterize in terms of symbols, or the algorithm itself, but my ear<br>determines it quite nicely.  i get my surprises from the algorithm (i claim<br>that i couldn't have created these complex sequences on my own), yet i get to<br>put my individual stamp on the results.  i like working this way!<br><br>this is in line with how i work professionally, as a computer graphics dude.  i<br>write algorithms/shaders that achieve 99% of my goal, and hand-paint that last<br>1%.  i find that visually, people expect imperfections in the artwork, at all<br>scales--from the actual grain of the drawn line, to the animation itself.  the<br>exact amount of imperfection is hard to characterize in terms of symbols, but<br>my eye recognizes it quite nicely as i interactively modify the artwork.<br><br>marcus<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 1 Dec 1996 00:23 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12590; Sun, 1 Dec 1996 00:25:40 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12689<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id PAA23073; Sat, 30 Nov 1996 15:25:37 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 30 Nov 1996 15:25:37 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9611301853.A25510-0100000@sheppard><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
