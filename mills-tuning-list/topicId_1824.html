I imagine that the crystal output (slowed down) <br>is a bit like sitting on the keyboard and staying there so you need a <br>way to seperate the notes.<br><br>There are many ways that one can utilize spectra (such as that of<br>the morphine cyrstal) to generate sound. The two techniques that I <br>have explored are:<br><br>(1) using the spectrum to define a single "sound" -- in this approach I <br>generated about 2 seconds of sound by mapping the x-ray <br>frequencies into audio frequencies. This was then transferred to a <br>sampler, and played like any other sampled sound, in any desired <br>tuning.<br><br>(2) using the spectrum to define a "scale" -- in this case, each x-ray <br>frequency of the crystal is mapped to a separate key of the keyboard <br>(and of course, also mapped down into the audio range). Using a sine <br>wave sample then allows the "complete" sound to be played by <br>pressing all the keys simultaneously. <br><br>Thus, in both cases, I "composed" the pieces by improvising on the <br>keyboard. In the first case the crystal provides the basic "sound" <br>while in the second case it provides the "tuning". <br><br>Greg Taylor then said some nice things (blush) and continued...<br><br>Just out of curiousity, what other XRD stuff sounded interesting? <br>Can one generalize? I wouldn't mind trying to map an essential <br>oil like Melissa, which I could then collide with the Allman <br>Brothers tune of the same name....<br><br>Well, our original idea was to try and develop a kind of "auditory <br>crystallography" in which you might use the ear to hear patterns in <br>the x-ray diffraction data that the eye doesn't readily see. What we <br>ended up with was a way of generating some interesting sounds (and <br>scales, I suppose). The problem was that we were never really able <br>to convince ourselves that we could reliably distinguish the sounds of <br>various materials. Of course, every substance sounded somewhat <br>different, but the differences weren't something that was easy to <br>describe or remember. So, sorry Greg. We were never able to discern <br>any real patterns in how various materials sounded, nor were we <br>able to generalize enough to predict if something would sound <br>"interesting" (whatever that means) or not. Thus, it would be <br>impossible to predict if linguistic similarities (like your oil and an <br>Allman Brothers song) would be acoustically compatible. Nor even if <br>the sound of oil would be slick.<br><br>[The other, perhaps larger issue that still remains largely unexplored <br>is the issue of the effect of details of the mapping. I once started a <br>paper on this, but never finished].<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 12 Mar 1997 13:53 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03054; Wed, 12 Mar 1997 13:53:36 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03050<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id EAA03231; Wed, 12 Mar 1997 04:51:56 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 12 Mar 1997 04:51:56 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3326A70B.1AD2@cavehill.dnet.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
