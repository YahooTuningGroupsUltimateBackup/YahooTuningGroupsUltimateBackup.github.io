How does one explain the fact<br>that so many musicians who are less<br>"well tuned" than us will find 12-equal<br>"3rd"s to be consonant, for instance?<br>Most of us on this List wouldn't say<br>that, but lots of other listeners would.<br><br>Modern psychoacoustic research has found<br>many surprising results in connection with<br>proving or disproving old acoustical theories,<br>some of which have been very well-established<br>for a long time.  Much more work still needs<br>to be done, and much of what I read about<br>this modern work calls into question some<br>of my own theories, and leads me to take a<br>more humble stance, ` la Partch in his<br>section on "resolutions", that I'm stating<br>not facts or rules, but rather, just my own<br>observations and speculations.<br><br>I think this is an eminently good topic for<br>discussion in this list.  I've focussed on<br>studying historical tunings and theories,<br>and my own knowledge of modern research is<br>not as complete as I'd like it to be.  It<br>would be good to have some of the main avenues<br>of this research succintly described, so that<br>in this particular forum different approaches<br>in the research could be brought together and<br>elaborated.<br><br>- Joe Monzo<br>  monz@juno.com<br>  http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html<br><br>___________________________________________________________________<br>You don't need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html<br>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</div><h3><a id=8734 href="#8734">ðŸ”—</a>Drew Skyfyre &#x3C;steele@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/1998 11:25:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Sometime ago, I reported the following :<br><br>"Pitch bend, I checked with the range at 1-semitone and <br>found no clear pattern in the data values that caused each successive<br>pitch change.<br>etc"<br><br>Well, I just came upon this in Yamha's XG Guidebook (available on their<br>web site) :<br>"XG-compatible instruments follow all GM guidelines as described above,<br> and are also capable of receiving Polyphonic Key Pressure.<br>The shift curve used for pitch bend is defined as linear by cents, <br>ensuring pitch bend compatibility between XG instruments. <br>The XG Specification also states that Pitch bend can be used to affect<br>rhythm <br>channels as well as melody voices."<br><br>So, I'm somewhat annoyed/confused, since the anomaly means it is <br>not possible to enter precise pitch bend values into a sequencer without <br>using ye old frequency meter.<br><br>Then again, I suppose this to be a problem with just about any <br>commercial sample-playback device. Can anyone confirm my suspicion<br>that a synth that is actually a synth, synthesizing it's own waveforms<br>(i.e., FM, PM, Additive, etc.) is much more reliable at delivering <br>more stable/precise pitches.<br><br>Later,<br>Drew<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>"Out of the ash<br>I rise with my red hair<br>And I eat men like air."-Sylvia Plath<br><br>"Ricka-racka-firecracker,Sis-boom-bah,Bugs Bunny,Bugs Bunny,Rah Rah Rah<br>!<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
