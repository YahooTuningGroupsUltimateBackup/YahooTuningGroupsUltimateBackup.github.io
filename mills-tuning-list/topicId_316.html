Are there books or other resources out there explaining how <br>people have done this?<br>2. What tuning tool works best for determining the frequencies?<br>3. Where can I find lists or charts of various frequencies' <br>relationships to each other? such as Partch's diagram, which I <br>still can't quite understand.<br>If you can help with any of these, I'd appreciate it. <br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br>Erik Nauman<br>K-2 teacher<br>The Rice School/La Escuela Rice<br>Houston, TX<br>enauman@rice.houstonisd.k12.tx.us<br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 30 Jan 1996 06:24 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA12254; Mon, 29 Jan 1996 21:24:33 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 29 Jan 1996 21:24:33 -0800<br>Message-Id: <960130002500_130931570@emout07.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
