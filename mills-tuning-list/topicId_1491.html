"decidedly non-string-like", I'll say.  <br><br>   What happens is the odd-numbered partials, which have an antinode at<br>that point on the (open) string drop way down in pitch, but the even<br>partials, which have a node at that point on the string, don't change much<br>at all.<br><br>   You also find that the nodes of partials move toward the center of the<br>string.  By that I mean that the third-harmonic (although it's far from<br>harmonic now!) nodal point you normally get by lightly touching the string<br>over the seventh fret, moves quite a bit toward the octave fret. <br>Presumably it's seeking a point where all three of the loops have equal<br>mass (or probably more accurately, equal torque:  mass times distance from<br>the node).  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 4 Jan 1997 06:16 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00987; Sat, 4 Jan 1997 06:19:50 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00985<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id VAA04514; Fri, 3 Jan 1997 21:19:49 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 3 Jan 1997 21:19:49 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701040016_MC2-E3F-449A@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
