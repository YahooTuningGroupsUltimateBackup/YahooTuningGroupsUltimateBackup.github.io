I'm not sure what key <br><br>>or specific tuning system he was using, but the minor third that dominated<br>>the first 20 minutes of the 2:45 set seemed to be "flat" compared to 12tet. <br><br>> After another 20 minutes or so of densely packed notes, perhaps best<br>>described as frantic arpeggios, the bass joined in and some time later the<br>>guitar and drummer joined the flight.<br><br>Funny, I thought the keyboard sound was a very accurate emulation of an <br>acoustic piano. Maybe James was sitting in an acoustically unfortunate <br>location (I was in the rear alcove). The "Dorian" scale sounded to me like <br>1/1 9/8 7/6 4/3 3/2 5/3 7/4 2/1, with a flatted fifth of some sort thrown <br>in. However, I could be wrong because there was a distinctly out-of-tune <br>fifth in there somewhere (although maybe that was just the interval between <br>the 7/4 and the 8/3). The frantic arpeggios seemed to be a means of <br>projecting the pure, resonant coinciding overtones that resulted from the <br>pure tuning. I suppose the faster the arpeggios are, the less variation is <br>heard in the intensity of these overtones, as all the phase-cancellation and <br>reinforcement would average out, but I was surprised at how the overtones <br>did not seem to be subject to the attack or inevitable release (how many <br>notes can the Korg sustain at once? infinity?) of the notes. Anyone know how <br>LaMonte does it? I think I read that he claimed to have such a fine control <br>of timing that he could make a certain overtone resonate by repeatedly <br>striking a key ar keys just at the crest of its cycle. Is this really <br>humanly possible?<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 11 Jun 1996 06:31 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA14853; Mon, 10 Jun 1996 21:31:28 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 10 Jun 1996 21:31:28 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199606110429.WAA12654@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
