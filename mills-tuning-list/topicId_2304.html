(I wish we could have some sonic samples<br>available.)<br><br>I am new in the list, so I just suppose that there must have been<br>several<br>discussions here already on the musical merits of 13. In my personal<br>experience, all fractions between 13/7 and 13/12 are too difficult to<br>fine tune. This, by the way, is the criterion I use in assessing<br>intervals: if we can be guided by the beats in fine tuning the<br>intervals,<br>the interval is useful in music. The most promising among those<br>intervals is 13/9, 637 cents.<br><br>Now I have to mention that in 1988 I examined the fragments of Greek<br>music (those known then), interpreting the notation in a stable way<br>rather than the variable way that is currently used ("my" method<br>applies only to pieces written before the 2nd century AD). I checked<br>every melodic interval in order to identify its fraction (for intervals<br>larger than a tone). I found only two clear cases of intervals which<br>cannot easily be matched to ratios. Interestingly, it was exactly<br>the same interval (same signs), its size being about a fifth minus<br>a thirdtone, and in both cases set over the word "mortals". (The one<br>instance in the Hymn to Nemesis and the other in the First Delphic<br>Hymn.)<br><br>I have also seen Mersenne approve of a certain composer's setting<br>two falling minor thirds (= 5th - small semitone, unless the one<br>third is subminor) over the word "morir" {sp?}. (John Chalmers<br>tells me that both thirds are 6/5 here.) I am not sure whether I should<br>relate this with the two Greek examples.<br><br>George Kahrimanis      Queens, NY<br><br>______________________________________________________<br>Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk<br>Subject:  Re: notation<br>PostedDate:  11-08-97 20:44:32<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  11-08-97 20:44:34-11-08-97 20:44:35,11-08-97 20:43:00-11-08-97 20:43:00<br>DeliveredDate:  11-08-97 20:43:00<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564F0.0066F0E2; Mon, 11 Aug 1997 20:44:23 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08065; Mon, 11 Aug 1997 20:44:32 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 11 Aug 1997 20:44:32 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08045<br>Received: (qmail 20567 invoked from network); 11 Aug 1997 18:42:46 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 11 Aug 1997 18:42:46 -0000<br>Message-Id: <memo.248772@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
