        <a href="/mills-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Miscellaneous</h1><h3><a id=2653 href="#2653">ðŸ”—</a>non12@delta1.deltanet.com (John Chalmers)</h3><span>3/11/1996 7:33:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>(These messages seem to have vanished into an Internet black hole<br>as far the the Tuning Digest is concerned; my apologies to anyone <br>who might have received them already.)<br> <br>With Tim Perkis's permission, I've placed my JiCalc WRITEALL file<br>copy of his TuneUP scale compilation in the Mills fpt site. TuneUP <br>was originally written in a dialect of FORTH, but later Mac systems made <br>it run erratically. I added a few more tunings and made some minor <br>corrections when I put the scales into an early version of JiCalc (without <br>comments or Notes). I think many Tuning List readers will find this<br>set of scales interesting. As most of them have only 12-tones or fewer,<br>it will be especially useful for synths which limit non-12-tet tunings <br>to only 12 tones per octave. Most of the scales come from A. J. Ellis's<br>appendices to Helmholtz's "On the Sensations of Tone," Lou Harrison's <br>Music Primer (pentatonic scales), and J. Murray Barbour's "Tuning and Temperament" (Greek tetrachordal scales).<br> <br>Since this file is much shorter than my other JiCalc files, I left it<br>as an uncompressed and non-encoded ascii file. The files are called<br>JiCalc_TuneUP and TuneUP_README and are in the software mac directory<br>with the rest of the JiCalc material.<br> <br>BTW, Benjamin Denckla has also created a MAX version of this set of<br>scales with Tim's permission.<br> <br>Gary raised an interesting question about positive systems and stretched <br>octaves. Apparently, Bosanquet never considered the possibility that<br>the octave was not exact in his "General Theory of the Divsion of the <br>Octave," as he called this section of his book, "Temperament."<br>But, I see no reason why his concepts could not be extended to cover the <br>cases of stretched and contracted octaves as well. One could define a <br>positive fifth as one which generates an interval greater than zero cents <br>(a positive Pythagorean comma) when a chain of 12 such fifths is reduced <br>by 7 such octaves. The neutral fifth would then be defined as 7/12 of <br>the altered octave.<br> <br>Re Shepard Tones: With considerable difficulty, it is possible to<br>approximate them on orchestral instruments (there is at least one<br>extant composition which purports to do so, but I forget the <br>composer and its name). I am unaware of any successful attempts on<br>commercial synths, though it should be straightforward with Csound<br>once the proper envelopes and timbres (spectra consisting only of octave <br>and suboctave harmonics) are specified.<br> <br>Has anybody experimented with Phi-tonality, a timbre whose spectrum is <br>composed of powers and submultiples of the Golden Ratio (1.618034 approx) <br>and whose first order difference tones are coincident with other members <br>of the spectrum. See the article by Walter O'Connell in XH15, 1993 and <br>my "Notes and Comments 15," where I mention related work by David E. <br>Schroer and Lorne Temes (See also Brian McLaren's and Brink McGoogy's <br>papers). I think these timbres might be interesting if combined with <br>Shepard's envelopes (on each partial, of course).<br> <br>Re "Polyxenharmony," a coinage Ivor would have no doubt appreciated: <br>Augusto Novaro, a Mexican theorist, instrument designer, teacher and<br>composer, advocated using 12- and 15-tets together. One might claim <br>this is really a subset of 60 (the LCM). Owen Jorgensen proposed his 7+5 <br>tuning, in which the white keys are tuned to 7-tet and the black to 5-tet.<br>Because of the way the pitches are offset, this tuning is a subset of<br>70-, not 35-tet. Ivor Darreg recorded a guitar improvisation in 31- <br>and 41-tets by overdubbing a number of years ago.<br> <br>Brian McLaren and the SAG Xenharmonic Players (a fluid and informally <br>organized group, to be sure) have performed and recorded with mixtures <br>of commercial microtonal synth tunings and various ET's and JI's. <br>(Does anyone know the actual tunings in the TS-10 library?)<br>Examples from their recent collections "Toward Unknown Regions 1 and 2" <br>(aka "Webs of Audition 1 and 2") include Pythagorean against 7-limit JI, <br>Slendro & Pelog vs the 17.19.23.29 hexany, a Tibetan scale against 31-tet,<br>Carlos's Alpha and Beta together, the Greek Chromatic (in 12?) vs 35-tet <br>and several examples of (semi-) empirical pitch collections against <br>various ET's. <br> <br>I once heard a Cambodian musician play a banjo in 12 with an ensemble <br>in (nearly) equal-7 at an Indonesian restaurant in Oakland in the late <br>1980's. (I must admit the clash was more apparent to Larry Polansky than <br>to me).<br> <br>I am very interested in seeing what Vyshnegradskii wrote on the subject <br>of transferring from one tuning to another in the course of a piece. <br>Darreg wrote on this technique too and composed a multisectional<br>work in different ET's (Excursion into the Enharmonic), but I am unsure<br>if he ever used different tunings in the same section seriatim, not <br>simultaneously<br> <br>Anyway, if one wants to try "transfer" as  a type of variation, it <br>might be interesting to take a MOS (WF) scale and transform it by varying <br>the size of its generator. For example one could transform the major mode<br>from its 22-tet form (4 4 1 4 4 4 1), to its "unrecognizable" counterpart<br>1 1 4 1 1 1 4 in 13-tet by varying the size of the 5th or 4th. The<br>transformation could be continuous or discrete; in the latter case a<br>series of transfers from 12, 19, 7, 16, 9 would be propriety-preserving <br>as well as less drastic or vertiginous. The scale intervals are  <br>2 2 1 2 2 2 1, 3 3 2 3 3 3 2, 1 1 1 1 1 1 1,  2 2 3 2 2 2 3, and <br>1 1 2 1 1 1 2.<br> <br>Re Interval: One might be able to get back issues from Jonathan Glasier<br>at the Sonic Arts Gallery, 2961 Beech Street, San Diego, CA 92102<br>(619) 231-3673. I am looking into the possibility of the Glasier's<br>making Interval available through Frog Peak Music. <br> <br> <br>--John<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 11 Mar 1996 17:12 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA01077; Mon, 11 Mar 1996 08:12:11 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 11 Mar 1996 08:12:11 -0800<br>Message-Id: <0099F2F6265708E2.E10B@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
