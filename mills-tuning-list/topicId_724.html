Where did he find the<br>time to write all that, much less have 20 kids, teach, and hang out<br>at coffee shops? Well, it's obvious that he could improvise on a very<br>high level, than go back and jot down a close fascimile...endless var-<br>iations, at an incredible level of physical execution. My feeling is<br>that many of Bach's pieces would have sounded slightly different if<br>written, say, one day later...I don't think those Baroque (an "academic"<br>term) dudes was too picky about their pieces at times. They were skilled,<br>I believe, in a much more complete and integrated way than most musicians<br>are today. They were master improvisors, who could also read and write<br>music very fluently, and they were expected to be able to do many various<br>functions, from arranging to playing funerals...Bach was a freelancer,<br>who stayed alive by hustling all sorts of gigs, from the most Sacred<br>of cantatas to pop tunes in the coffee shops.<br><br>It's the improvising part, I suppose, that most attracts me, because<br>that's exactly the tradition I come out of, starting when I got into<br>blues in the late 1960's...blues and jazz and other American idioms<br>put a huge burden on a player to be a composer who comes up with their<br>OWN thing within the dictates of a style...thus, all blues players are<br>composers, in a sense...a jazz guy (or gal) is composing every time<br>they pick up their axe., but from an endless pool of riffs and rhythmic<br>patterns that are part of the basic language. Believe me, blues is a <br>very tough art form. I am only happy playing these days when I come up<br>with riffs that I have never played before.<br><br>Anyway, I think improvisation is a subject that has rarely been touched<br>on in this forum...so, it makes me wonder about Partch's compositional<br>style...how did he compose his works? Did he sit around messing with his<br>instruments and seeing what happened, or did he work things out in his<br>head first, and then write down those ideas? Did he write fast, slow,<br>did he make a lot of corrections, did he agonize over a few notes (as<br>Miles said Gil Evans would do), or did he think the idea had precedence<br>over a certain way of expressing that idea? In that regard, I read in<br>the liner notes to a Bach Lute album that Bach (or others in that period)<br>would sometimes write things that were idiomatically incorrect for the<br>Lute, but he knew that the lutenist would take care of it, and adapt it<br>for his own axe...they were expected to be able to do this...thus, a few<br>notes here and there were not the issue...the performer was now actually<br>INVOLVED in the compositional process in a way that is conspicuously<br>absent from many players of the European orchestral repertoire.<br><br>As I said, I learn a lot from the people on this forum, and the inter-<br>action makes me evaluate what I do in serious ways. I AM an improvisor,<br>and it is a natural language for me...my band works best when we impro-<br>vise, too. And I don't believe I've ever seen ant info on the inner<br>workings of old Harry's writing style...seems like it would be an inter-<br>esting subject. Also, there was a great article on Partch in the June<br>1990 issue of Keyboard mag...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 11 Aug 1996 16:36 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07281; Sun, 11 Aug 1996 16:36:21 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07273<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA07015; Sun, 11 Aug 1996 07:36:18 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 11 Aug 1996 07:36:18 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199608111339.OAA26810@gollum.globalnet.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
