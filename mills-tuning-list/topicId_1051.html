Please forgive me if this is covered in a FAQ I<br>>haven't read.<br>>How is 19TET music notated?<br><br>   19TET (19-tone-per-octave equal-temperament) is usually notated<br>traditionally with a chromatic scale reading C, C#, Db, D, D#, Eb, E,<br>E#/Fb, F, F#, Gb, G, G#, Ab, A, A#, Bb, B, B#/Cb, C, ...  So C-C# is 1/19<br>octave, as is C#-Db.  E# and Fb are the same note (enharmonic equivalents),<br>and sit between E and F in pitch.  And the situation is similar for B#/Cb.<br><br>   Also, Dbb is enharmonically equivalent with C# rather than C, and<br>similarly for other double-sharps and double flats.  That is because Dbb<br>must be the flat of Db, so it must bear the same relationship to Db as Db<br>bears to D (a chromatic rather than diatonic half-step).<br><br>   Once you use those pitches for the 19 notes of the octave, traditional<br>scale nomenclature applies, and you can play traditional music.  By that I<br>mean that the results sound fairly similar with what it would sound like in<br>12TET.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Re: Handel's organ<br>PostedDate:  15-12-97 16:00:10<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  15-12-97 15:58:10-15-12-97 15:58:11,15-12-97 15:57:51-15-12-97 15:57:52<br>DeliveredDate:  15-12-97 15:57:52<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656E.0052381C; Mon, 15 Dec 1997 15:59:59 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA15996; Mon, 15 Dec 1997 16:00:10 +0100<br>Date: Mon, 15 Dec 1997 16:00:10 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA15658<br>Received: (qmail 4630 invoked from network); 15 Dec 1997 06:58:44 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 15 Dec 1997 06:58:44 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541102b0ba752e93c8@[207.207.2.39]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
