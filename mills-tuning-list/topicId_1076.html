Sundberg and published by <br>the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, Stockholm in 1987. Although there are <br>articles about microtonality, the one in question is about 12-tet. I think <br>Carol Krumhansl contributed to this one. Major and minor keys are <br>characterized by a set of twelve "probe tone ratings," experimentally <br>derived ratings of how well each of the twelve tones fits into a particular <br>key. The minor and major "profiles" are transposed to assign to each of the <br>twenty-four keys a point in twelve-dimensional space. Using multidimensional <br>scaling, a useful statistical technique, the authors find that the <br>relationships between the keys can be well represented on the surface of a <br>torus, shown as a recangle where the top and bottom edges are assumed to <br>connect and the left and right edges connect as well. The pattern shows the <br>two circles of fifths (major and minor) as a series of diagonal lines (which <br>connect through the edges to form an unbroken chain), with parallel and <br>relative keys nearby to each other. A Bach piece is subject to the same <br>multidimensional scaling procedure (I'm not sure how it is subdivided, or <br>whether durations of notes count), and is shown to worm its way around a <br>small region of the rectangle-torus. The results agreed very well with a <br>traditional analysis of the piece.<br><br>The probe-tone profiles are psychologically derived, but Georg Hajdu "shows" <br>in Interface 22 that they may be related to the third or fourth octave of <br>the harmonic series, at least for the major scale. He dismisses the seventh <br>harmonic somehow; I think because it's too far from 12-tet to be important.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 30 Oct 1996 18:36 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02112; Wed, 30 Oct 1996 18:37:33 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04670<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA18922; Wed, 30 Oct 1996 09:37:31 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 30 Oct 1996 09:37:31 -0800<br>Message-Id: <23961030173432/0005695065PK4EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
