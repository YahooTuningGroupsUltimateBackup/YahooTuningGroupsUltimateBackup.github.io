Thus 6/5, 5/3, 16/15 and 15/8 would have<br>the same distance from 1/1 as you point out.  <br><br>As for "punning," one may map the relevant region of the tonal <br>lattice onto (or do I mean into?) some ET by using Fokker's <br>application of the cross and/or box products after choosing the <br>intervals (kommata) one wishes to set to zero. I  think  his papers <br>on "Periodicity Blocks" are in the Bibliography. <br><br>Whether one should use a pseudo-Cartesian (right angle) lattice<br>or a polygonal/polyhedral one is for me mostly a matter of taste.<br>At Paul E's earlier suggestion, I started plotting 7 and higher<br>limit scales on oblique, polygonal lattices (the simpler ones are<br>easily interpretable as polyhedrons in 3 space). I must admit that <br>I got  stunning graphics, though beyond about the 11-limit, I find <br>the rectilinear mode easier to interpret.<br> <br>However, I got fascinated by the patterns, so, I wrote a series of<br>Q&D Basic programs to plot scales (after factoring their ratios) on a <br>series of polygonal lattices of the type Erv Wilson has used. I stopped <br>at the centered-tridekagon and the 43-limit. I recommend this <br>approach to those of you with faster computers, more memory, and higher <br>resolution graphics than I have. <br><br>I might mention the Carter Scholz's latest version of JiCalc plots<br>scales on a 31-limit lattice (pseudo-Cartesian). It's downloadable<br>from Mills. Also, it plays each lattice point when the note <br>is clicked. <br><br>-John<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 17 Jan 1997 02:13 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12385; Thu, 16 Jan 1997 11:01:41 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12285<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id CAA22254; Thu, 16 Jan 1997 02:01:38 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 16 Jan 1997 02:01:38 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701160500_MC2-F50-FF96@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4654 href="#4654">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>1/21/1997 8:19:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>To Graham Breed (2nd attempt, sorry if it appears twice)<br><br>Helmholtz devotes a number of pages to Arabic and Persian scales in<br>"On the sensations of tone".<br>The scales you gave were catalogued by Safi al-Din (Bagdad, 13th century).<br>They are among the twelve main maqams that he described.<br>To answer your second question, yes they are from a reliable source.<br>A good one is<br>  Liberty Manik: Das arabische Tonsystem im Mittelalter.
