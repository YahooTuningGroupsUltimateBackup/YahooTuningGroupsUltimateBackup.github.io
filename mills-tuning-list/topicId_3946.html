I <br>would suggest that any of the participants in the project who want to <br>sell some, put a post on the forum, and let people know...it's almost <br>done, so we'll be keeping you posted...Hstick  PS I sell my CD's for $12, <br>which includes postage...</div><h3><a id=8424 href="#8424">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/1998 8:53:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Robert C Valentine wrote:<br><br>> I'm waiting for the line "and heres how to order". For those of us<br>> who are not on the CD, how can we go about purchasing a copy?<br><br>   The short version is that those who contributed recordings also<br>contributed money, and will get the CDs to sell, or whatever.  So,<br>concepually anyway, selling price and such will be up to the individual<br>contributors.<br><br>   Perhaps I'd only be guessing, but I suspect though that Neil will make a<br>suggestion for method of distribution and price and such, and most of the<br>contributors will follow that suggestion.<br><br>   To be honest though, I intend to donate a lot of my copies to university<br>and public audio libraries.</div>
