A major international city. Quite a<br>bit of microtonal activity there. For years, one of the major<br>organizations performing and promoting the performance of<br>all kinds of microtonality is the American Festival of<br>Microtonal Music. Founded by Johnny Reinhard and Jon<br>Catler in 1981, this years four day MicroMay '97 festival<br>opened on May 16 at NYU's Loewe Theater.<br><br>Johnny led the audience in a ripping version of John Cage's<br>0'00" (4'33 No. 2): solo to be performed in any way by<br>anyone, in this case we were asked to play the shortest<br>possible sound. Following was the first of many world<br>premieres, Frank Wigglesworth's Twin Songs for meantone<br>flute, written for flautist Andrew Bolotowsky. The middle<br>eastern tinged piece was in two movements.<br><br>Elodie Lauten's Discombobulations for soprano, electric<br>guitar, flute, synthesizer and tape was characteristic of the<br>composer's cyclic rhythms. The piece was in a combination<br>of Vallotti temperament and just intonation - 5 limit with a<br>touch of 7. (world premiere)<br><br>soprano - Meredeth Borden<br>electric ji guitar - Jon Catler<br>flute - Andrew Bolotowsky<br>synthesizer - Elodie Lauten<br>lyrics by Steven Hall<br><br>Leonardo for bassoon, cello and wrench guitar was<br>commissioned by AFMM . This composition by Edgar David<br>Grana included quartertones, multiphonics, extended<br>techniques and a guitar retuned with it's A string +1/8th tone,<br>the G string -1/8th tone. At one point Reinhard took his<br>bassoon apart and played the pieces. Ricci occasionally<br>fretted notes but mostly used the wrench as a slide. The<br>composition had a loose improvisatory feel. (world premiere)<br><br>bassoon - Johnny Reinhard<br>cello - David Eggar<br>wrench guitar - Vito Ricci<br><br>Birdhouse performed an extended version of Nightbird. Using<br>cluster chords, called "manyminor" by composer Jon Catler,<br>the duo explored the rich splendor of 13 limit just intonation.<br>Catler used his custom ji guitar with interchangeable<br>fingerboards (fretless and 49 tone ji) and Meredith Borden<br>sang like a bird. Music based on birdsongs is part of<br>Birdhouse's modus operandi. <br><br>This group has performed a bit around New York, recently<br>performing two dates at La Mama la Gallereia earlier this<br>month with Brad Catler, percussion and Andrew Bolotowsky,<br>flute. Their debut CD will be released this summer.<br><br>soprano - Meredeth Borden<br>electric ji guitar - Jon Catler<br><br>Joseph Gabriel Maneri's Sharafuddin b Yah Yah Maneri was<br>composed for flute in 72 equal temperament. Exotic and <br>very eastern, this composition was inspired by a 14th century<br>Sufi saint, teacher and high priest: a Makdum ul-Mulk.<br>Composer, saxophonist and clarinetist Maneri is Professor of<br>Music at the New England Conservatory where he teaches<br>microtonal music composition and theory. (NY premier)<br><br>flute - Andrew Bolotowsky<br><br>Arriving from Canada, composer Ganesh Anandan and<br>composer/Rainer Wiens were held up at the airport and<br>didn't make the concert. As a substitution, the audience was<br>treated to a tape of the group New Tokyo Berlin York, playing<br>Johnny Reinhard's Circle. This piece had an improvisatory<br>feel using percussion, didjeridu and bassoon.<br><br>custom percussion - Yoshiaki Ochi<br>didjeridu - Ulrich Krieger<br>bassoon - Johnny Reinhard<br><br>A rare world premier of Wendy Carlos's Afterlife featured the<br>AFMM chorus, violin, cello, fretless bass, conga, timpani and<br>tape. Using a combination of 12 and 15 tone equal<br>temperament the piece certainly gave us a taste of the scary<br>uncertainty of the Afterlife.<br><br>The piece will soon be released as part of Carlos's new CD,<br>Tales of Heaven and Hell.<br><br>American Festival of Microtonal Music Chorus:<br>Meredith Borden, Piera F. Paine, Mayumi Reinhard, Elizabeth<br>Lee, Brendan Glynn and Gabriel Mendlow<br>violin - Tom Chiu<br>cello - David Eggar<br>electric fretless bass guitar - Brad Catler<br>timpani and conga - Louis Winsberg<br><br>My picks: Nightbird and Afterlife.<br><br>Stay tuned for more...<br><br>see you all at the next 3 concerts of the festival<br>on May 21, 22 and 23?<br><br>D a v i d   B e a r d s l e y .. dmb5561719@aol.com <br>      *            ..    *    ... .*             ....     *......   .<br>            ..*    I M M P  &  B i i n k!   m  u  s  i  c<br>. ..    *             ..                 ..           * ..             <br>J u x t a p o s i t i o n Ezine    *          . ..        *<br> . .*.. .           .. .     .    .*.   . . .     . ..       ..<br>      http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm<br>  . ..         .*..            . .. .           ..*.     .    ..   . *. <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 18 May 1997 18:11 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04949; Sun, 18 May 1997 18:11:12 +0200<br>Date: Sun, 18 May 1997 18:11:12 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04952<br>Received: (qmail 26527 invoked from network); 18 May 1997 16:11:08 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 18 May 1997 16:11:08 -0000<br>Message-Id: <337F2DAA.79AD@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
