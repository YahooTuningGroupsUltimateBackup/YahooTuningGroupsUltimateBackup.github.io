However,<br>>> if I have modulated to the key of Gb7, I would notate a Gb7 enclosed in<br>>> parenthesis on the staff.<br>><br>>   Can you elucidate this a little more?  For example, what does the "key of<br>>Gb7" mean?  I presume that this is some particular mode built upon Gb and<br>>containing a 7:4 seventh?  How then would you specify this particular<br>>mode, and<br>>how would you switch to a 9:5 minor seventh?<br>><br><br>Let's change the example to a chord written F:Bb7:Eb7 (1/1, 21/16, 7/4)<br>	-The bass plays F, no problem.<br>	-The soprano sees Eb7, and plays Eb approximately a quartertone<br>flat, knowing to tune a "7" relationship because she has the "7"<br>diacritical.<br>	-The alto sees Bb7, but must tune a complex interval.  She sees the<br>"7", but doesn't know how to tune it since she is a bit lower than a 4/3<br>from the bass--no man's land.  Since she sees the cue (Eb7) written in her<br>part, she sees that the soprano pitch is a 4/3 above hers, and knows to<br>which pitch she should tune her simple relationship.<br><br>Another example: what if the bass moves from F (1/1) to GL+ (8/7), and then<br>the alto must play a 5/4 from this new fundamental?  She would see in her<br>part BL+ over a cue (GL+), and knows to hear a 5/4 in relation to the bass<br>rather than some kind of seventh.<br><br>A 9/5 minor seventh would come under my "easy to hear" interval<br>classifications.  Since nobody sees a "7" they know not to tune too far<br>away from their "home" chromatic scale.  If I wanted an F#+ (45/32) in the<br>chord C:F#+:G (1/1, 45/32. 3/2), I would give the alto an F#+ over a cue<br>(D).<br><br>Pardon my ambiguity, I hope that this is clearer.<br><br>-Adam<br><br>_________________<br>Adam B.
