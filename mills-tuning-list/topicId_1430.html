Well, the wheels started grinding and<br>I thought wouldn't it be great if midi was based on hz instead of it's<br>limiting protocol. Also, those dudes back about 200 years ago had it right<br>(if there's such a thing as right) when they rebuilt keyboards that had<br>more than 2 levels. Hell on any standard computer keyboard, one can use the<br>"zxcvbnm,./" level as a base and put small gradations going up diagonally<br>up to the "1234567890-level, not to mention octave transpositions<br>possible with the shift key. Is it possible to buy such a keyboard? Also, I<br>ran into the problem of not being able to play more than one note at a time<br>(bummer). Is it possible without MIDI and several channels? Just curious.<br><br>As an aside, I really think it's interesting how people in the microtuning<br>community are upset about Kronus doing Partchs works. It's funny how some<br>rare shining intellect comes along and tells the codifiers of knowledge<br>that they've gotton stuck in their reality system to the point where it is<br>almost like a straitjacket; and then after his death, people codify him. If<br>Kronus were all 7 years old, I'm positive that the "parents" (be they<br>"12TET is right for everyone" professors or caretakers of the Partch<br>legacy) would physically prevent those "upstart brats" from "vandalizing"<br>our religion. Partch made his own instruments because it was right for him,<br>he didn't want to create another entrenched system (he states this ethic<br>time and time again in his "Genesis.."). Sure he had certain ideas in mind<br>for the sound he wanted, but if someone can put a new spin on it using<br>shovels and drumsticks on an upside down porcelein toilet seat:  MORE POWER<br>TO YOU.  Partch constantly encouraged us to get off our "ahem" and make our<br>own music, our own instruments, our own scales, our own REALITY SYSTEMS.<br>Who really OWNS anything. I respect other people's work and don't plagurize<br>because I think life is full of so many infinite combinations of<br>expressions that it would be absurd to "steal" anothers ideas. I would feel<br>very pathetic if I had to copy the way I talk and walk from someone else.<br>At any rate, the universe is dynamic not static, all the sounds we hear<br>influence everything we do, a river can't be dammed up by sticks. Music is<br>part of that river. Why dam it up? Kronus will get thousands to hear music<br>they might never hear. And it's Kronus's interpretation, just like<br>everything in life is an interpretation. I think it's supremely BEAUTIFUL<br>that Partch's instruments will rot away in no time. I feel it is part of<br>his sense of humor in a sense for if his instruments would have been made<br>to be more permenant, then he would face the legacy of becoming another<br>dogmatic system.<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 25 Dec 1996 15:44 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02800; Wed, 25 Dec 1996 15:47:17 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02799<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id GAA08413; Wed, 25 Dec 1996 06:47:14 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 25 Dec 1996 06:47:14 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.95.961225093514.6059A-100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
