E = H nu applies to all energy quanta, whether<br>>in<br>>}>>the form of light, sound, or whatever. The quantum of light is the photon;<br>>}>>the quantum of sound is the phonon.<br>><br>>}   If by this you mean that sound is conveyed by phonons in the same sense<br>>}that light is conveyed by photons, then the more I think about it, the less<br>>}I buy it.<br>><br>>I'm not surprised. As a young one I read stacks of Scientific Americans from<br>>the '70s. Seeing articles about phonons led me to feel much as you do now.<br>>Although I did not specifically study phonons in quantum mechanics, I have<br>>learned the fundamentals well enough so that my skepticism has been abated.<br>>That is, the truly astonishing things about quantum mechanics reside at a<br>>much deeper level and force us to throw away our customary "pictures" of<br>>physical phenomena, which rely on philosophical assumptions such as<br>>Einstein's reality principle, which has been shown experimentally to be false<br>>(via Bell's theorem). If one finds a way of accepting the crazy axioms of<br>>quantum mechanics, or just takes them for granted, one can construct the most<br>>verifiably accurate physical theory known to mankind (general relativity has<br>>been verified slightly more accurately in some contexts).<br>><br>   }Now there's normally no realistic value in studying sound at the<br>}sub/atomic level, because everything about sound can be modeled many<br>orders<br>}of magnitude more simply at the macroscopic level of mechanics.  But<br>still,<br>}down at the level of fundamental forces, air-pressure is manifested by<br>}collisions of air molecules, and any form of collision is carried out<br>by<br>}repulsion between the electrons in the outer shells of those molecules.<br>}Electron repulsion is in turn carried out by photons.<br><br>Classically, two spherically symmetric neutral atoms would experience no<br>electrostatic forces even if separated by a very small distance.<br>Electron repulsion would be exactly balanced by attraction to the other<br>atom's nucleus. Quantum mechanically, this is not quite the case, and<br>you get the so-called Van der Walls forces which vary as the sixth or<br>twelfth power of the distance.<br><br>But it is the Pauli exclusion principle, not electrostatic or<br>electromagnetic interactions at all, which is responsible for collision<br>forces. Let's consider crystals, however, where it is not collisions<br>that transmit sound energy.<br>><br>>}So sound is, at this otherwise not very interesting sub/atomic level,<br>>}ultimately conveyed by photons.  The invention of a new particle, the<br>>}phonon, seems to be no more than a pointless complication that side-steps<br>>}well-accepted physical models for no apparent reason.<br>><br>>The concept of the phonon had proved very useful in the study of crystalline<br>>lattices and semiconductors. It does not side-step quantum mechanics (the<br>>most well-accepted model), and your classical way of viewing things is only<br>>valid at the macroscopic level, where it emerges as an approximation.<br>>Electron-phonon scattering is very real, just like electron-photon<br>>scattering, even though the photon is "only" a wave propogating through the<br>>electromagnetic field. Just as the equations of the electromagnetic field,<br>>describing how an electric field is produced by a changing magnetic field and<br>>vice versa, give rise to wave solutions, so do the equations of a crystal<br>>lattice, with bodies vibrating around their equilibrium positions and<br>>interacting with one another according to Van der Walls-type forces or, in<br>>the case of an ionic crystal, electrostatic repulsion and/or attraction.<br>>There are transverse as well as longitudinal wave solutions to these<br>>acoustical equations. The quantum-mechanical duality between energy waves and<br>>particles is universal. Even you are a wave, capable of interference,<br>>diffraction, and all -- it's just that your wavelength is so short that these<br>>effects are undetectable.<br>><br>   }When I think about the classic experiments for illustrating the<br>}particle-wave duality of light, it's difficult for me to see any way to<br>}apply them to sound.  I can't imagine any way for example, that you<br>could<br>}get a particle-like distribution from the famous "two-slit" experiment<br>if<br>}conducted with sound rather than light.  But presumably that just means<br>}that I'm conducting an unrevealing experiment.<br><br>Single quanta of sound are extremely difficult to isolate in the<br>laboratory. By the formula E=H nu, you can see that the energy of a<br>phonon is astronomically smaller than the energy of a photon, which is<br>already so small that light energy was thought to come in continuous<br>quantities until this century.<br><br>I think that's enough physics for this list.
