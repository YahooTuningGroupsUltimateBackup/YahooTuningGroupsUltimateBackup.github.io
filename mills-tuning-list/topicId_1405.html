Only the EPS samplers,<br>> the VFX and TS-10 synthesizers, and<br>> the TX802 have more than one pitch table.<br>> Of these, only the TS-10 and ASR-10<br>> samplers are currently manufactured.<br>> This leaves most microtonal composers<br>> with no options.<br><br>what about the ensoniq mr rack?  it has dozens of<br>preset pitch tables, as well as dozens of ram tables<br>for the user to download.  you can also adjust the<br>octave transposition per instrument, so if you don't<br>mind splitting your sequence up onto different channels,<br>you can cover the entire range.  the ensoniq  comes with<br>hundreds of sounds.  i bought a 24 Mb expansion card, so<br>now i have like 400 or 500 sounds.<br><br>but the high end microtonalist instrument is the kyma, which has a tuning<br>resolution of 0.026 hz (or was it 0.0026 hz?).  it doesn't have any<br>preset sounds like the ensoniq.  instead, you design your own sounds.<br>i'm currently exploring morphing from one wilson cps hexany (and<br>all of its "modes") to another in real time via controller data using<br>multi-dimensional tuning arrays and various interpolants.  if the kyma had as<br>many preset sounds as a typical synthesizer, i think it would be the<br>microtonalist synthesizer of choice, period.  and talk about a range!  i<br>alogorithmically run microtonal sine wave scales up and down the entire audible<br>spectrum which is just less than 11 octaves or so (2^52 hz  to "just" less<br>than 2^152678 hz).  check out the web page, and ask for<br>a demo tape: http://www.symbolicsound.com/<br><br>was this an old brian mclaren article?  i read a mclaren review of the kyma<br>a while ago, and can't believe that he would write all this rubbish without<br>excepting the kyma.<br><br>marcus<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 19 Dec 1996 20:49 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA09307; Thu, 19 Dec 1996 20:51:37 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09302<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA28946; Thu, 19 Dec 1996 11:51:35 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 19 Dec 1996 11:51:35 -0800<br>Message-Id: <9612191149.ZM1236@frollo><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
