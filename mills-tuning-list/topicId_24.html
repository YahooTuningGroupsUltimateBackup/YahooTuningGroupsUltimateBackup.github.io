Yes, once again<br>the season's ripe  for my mild little scribbles to stir <br>the hearts of various forum subscribers--not to mention<br>an undercurrent of lynch mob frenzy. <br>And best of all...now that the few, the rich, the tenured <br>have slithered back from their sabbaticals on the French<br>Riviera, there is once again a sizable audience on<br>hand. Yes, what with the dirt-poor grad students<br>fresh from their summer McJobs to another semester <br>of academic toil, and looking forward embarking on<br>post-doctoral careers as rent-a-cops, 7-11<br>cashiers, or (in the case of Fulbright Scholars and<br>phi beta kappa valdedictorians) Neiman Marcus<br>clerks...time once again to crank up the heat.<br>Over the past year or twain, certain behaviours<br>have shown up on this forum which  (as the<br>Japanese so memorably said of their war efforts<br>after the detonation of the 2nd atomic bomb over<br>Nagasaki) "have not necessarily led to a successful<br>conclusion." These dysfunctional behaviours are peculiar <br>to the internet...and may explain the high incidence of<br>"lurkers" among so many knowledgable and <br>distinguished subscribers.  Perhaps if the maladroit<br>behaviours were curtailed, some of the more<br>interesting (yet silent) subscribers would venture <br>a post or twain.<br>Among the most common  on-line malefactors<br>is the one I call the "nayjerk."  This is the testy<br>tyke who responds to any post with instant and<br>vituperative denial.  If you post "Water is wet," the<br>nayjerk will instantly shoot back: "Where did you get<br>that insane idea?  Of course water isn't wet, everyone<br>knows it isn't wet--that's the most bizarre thing I've<br>ever heard."  The signature of the nayjerk is a devout<br>refusal to post supporting references.  Press him (it's almost <br>always a him; women almost never act this badly) for <br>data or a reasoned argument and there's nary a response.  <br>Of course the  nayjerk is merely out to garner attention <br>for himself, never to add anything productive to the discussion.<br>There's been all too much of this sort of thing on this forum--<br>particularly from the small-whole-number contingent.<br>Perhaps a word to the wise will reduce this on-line <br>birdlime.<br>Another unsavory form of Internettiquetlessness  is the flame.  To<br>date this forum has proven mercifully all but free of the<br>scourge; alas, some months ago a flame war broke out between<br>David Doty and Charles Lucy.  <br>It was unproductive. <br>As a rule of thumb, whenever ad hominem attacks appear on a<br>forum like this one it's a sign that the subscriber would really<br>be more comfortable elsewhere--for example,<br>alt.rec.shotguns.bimbos.muscle-cars.<br>Of course "ad hominem" here refers to obloquy for the sake of<br>vituperation.  "X is a charlatan," "Y is an idiot," etc.  This ought<br>not to be mistaken for unvarnished critical judgments backed up by<br>evidence and clear reasoning: viz., "John Cage has no compositional<br>talent, as can easily be deduced from the fact that he consistently<br>ignores the implications of Miller's 1956 paper on the limits of <br>the channel capacity of human perceptual systems. If any evidence is <br>needed, merely listen to 5 minutes of `Music of Changes'--if you can <br>stand it." <br>You may despise such a judgment but it is backed up by<br>reasoning and gives concrete data.  Thus it is a legitimate<br>post.<br>By contrast, "Y is an idiot" fails the test because [1] it is not <br>a critique on someone's ideas or abilities, but rather <br>verbal bludgeoning; [2] there is no supporting evidence; [3] there<br>isn't even  a ghost of a reasoned argument.<br>Third and worst of all is the forum subscriber who responds to<br>a 1500-word post full of detailed references and elegant hypotheses<br>with "You misspelled "teh" in line 5.  In line 19, the comma should be<br>a semicolon.  In line 27 "metonymies as generative metaphor" should <br>have an `s' at the end of the sentence."<br>This sort of obsessive detail-mania is just about as futile<br>as any form of human endeavour short of hitting oneself on the<br>head with a ball peen hammer.  Exemplified on this forum by<br>the posts of Greg Taylor, this kind of nit-picking is <br>a thorough waste of everyone's time.  If you don't have anything<br>substantive to say, why obsess over minutiae?  Who cares if there <br>was a  period on line 29?<br>On a different topic:<br>Dave Madole has voiced concern about the length of my posts. <br>"Some people have to pay to get e-mail," he rightly points out.<br>However, enough people have told me that my posts are the<br>most interesting (sometimes "the only interesting") material<br>on the forum that I'm reluctant to abridge 'em.  For those<br>of you who object, try the following: receive the tuning forum<br>as a series of individual posts and write a clever bozo filter<br>which detects the title of the post and zaps it if [1] the<br>post is by John Chalmers but [2] it has no title.  John's own<br>posts all have titles but mine don't.  A clever kill file should<br>let you avoid receiving my posts at all if you don't want to,<br>while letting all of John's pass. <br>One final word:<br>Over the past year or twain, various folks have sent e-mail to<br>John Chalmers in my name.  Some of you were then puzzled (or<br>disappointed) at my lack of response.<br>You may want to think a few seconds about the implications<br>of the fact that I have no e-mail.  My appearance on this forum<br>is an exotic fluke, possible only because of John Chalmers' courtesy.<br>When you send me e-mail I have no way of responding because<br>(let's repeat it YET AGAIN) *I have no e-mail.*<br>Unless you send me your snail mail address, *I have no way of<br>contacting you.*  Thus folks like Miko, who are interested in<br>getting copies of my "Microtonal Music On CD" compilation<br>tapes, need to *send their snail mail addresses.*<br>It's worth mentioning, by the way, that some of the most<br>interesting and stimulating members of the microtonal<br>community *do not have e-mail.*<br>Kraig Grady, a superb JI composer and formidable theorist<br>in his own right, has no access to e-mail whatever.  Jonathan<br>Glasier, a seminal figure in both ji and equal tempered<br>live performance, has no access whatever to e-mail.<br>Erv Wilson, perhaps the foremost tuning theorist in the<br>U.S., has no access whatever to e-mail.  Tui St. George Tucker,<br>probably the best quartertone composer around, has no access<br>to e-mail whatever.  Ben Johnston is not on-line and <br>likely never will be.<br>In fact, one could almost posit that the less access the<br>person has to the internet, the more interesting sh/e will prove.<br>(The reverse postulate--that the *more* access someone<br>has to the internet, the *less* interesting hi/r posts--does<br>not bear thinking about, and is certainly unwarranted. Well...<br>almost certainly.)<br>Thus my situation is far from unusual.  It is fact only by<br>the slimmest of margins (and most circuitous of routes) that<br>my posts appear on this forum at all.  Folks like Marc Perlman<br>may want to bear this in mind & include a snail mail address<br>the next time they send me e-mail.<br>--mclaren<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 23 Sep 1995 10:21 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id BAA26673; Sat, 23 Sep 1995 01:21:50 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 23 Sep 1995 01:21:50 -0700<br>Message-Id: <950923081930_71670.2576_HHB23-8@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
