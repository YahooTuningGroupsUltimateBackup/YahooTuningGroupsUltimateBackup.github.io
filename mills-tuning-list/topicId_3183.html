Anyone know anything about this? Are they tunable? I was once<br>> given an 88-note  silent keyboard... <br><br>I have seen a number of these systems - including MIDI compatible <br>ones.  There is a company in Cambridge UK which specialises in such <br>transformations, and there certainly used to be various <br>do-it-yourself kits available.  I can't remember the names of them <br>now (there was one available some years ago called 'Crystal Keys') -  <br>but at some point when I have time I could find out easily enough.  <br>(By 'electronic innards' I'm assuming you mean sensors under the <br>piano keys which pick up note on/off,  velocity, and presumably some <br>thing to do with the sustain pedal - rather than player-piano type <br>innards?).  To damp the piano some very heavy felt or even felted <br>wire to catch the hammers will do, tho you wouldn't need it on the <br>silent keyboard.<br><br>> >Are they tunable?<br><br>As tunable as the MIDI device you play it through. <br><br>Patrick O-L</div>
