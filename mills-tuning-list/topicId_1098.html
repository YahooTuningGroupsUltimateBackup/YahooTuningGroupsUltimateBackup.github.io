It seems to work <br>on all computer cards and synths (at least 10,000 people have <br>downloaded my files to date, see <br>http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~bf250/harpsichord.html for links). <br>Since there are 15 channels in GM (one being the reserved <br>"drum" channel), that gives room for 3 enharmonics. When I <br>record a mean-tone piece, I play it ignoring enharmonics, then <br>go through by hand and decrement the velocity setting by one <br>for the notes that go in the 3 extra channels (there aren't <br>many, the arrow keys on my sequencer step through the notes, <br>so it only takes a single click of the mouse button to <br>decrement velocity by 1) so the program knows which ones they <br>are.<br><br>Of course, exactly the same technique can be used for <br>close-to-full microtuning by approximation with 15  12-tet <br>tunings - the only problem is, what is the most practical way <br>to tell the program what note is which when there are too many <br>notes to want to do it by hand as I do now? Probably it would <br>be to play the piece through N times, with a different <br>velocity setting each time, playing only the notes in a <br>certain class each time, then merging to a single block. Then, <br>would it be easier to play by note number (note# 0-127, then <br>128-255 ...), or interlaced (note# mod N = 0,N-1)? Or, has <br>someone a better idea?<br><br>If the list comes to any agreement on this, I am willing to <br>extend my program and make it available (freeware). I write in <br>ANSI BASIC with the sole extension required being binary file <br>I/O, so it should run on just about any computer anywhere. (I <br>use QuickBasic on a PC now.)<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 4 Nov 1996 21:16 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07716; Sat, 2 Nov 1996 11:04:46 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07641<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id CAA29643; Sat, 2 Nov 1996 02:04:43 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 2 Nov 1996 02:04:43 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961102100138_71670.2576_HHB42-3@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
