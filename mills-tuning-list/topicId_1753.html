I had already <br>skimmed the magazine in my quest for a new 12-tET guitar but didn't notice <br>that tidbit. It is interesting that Jon is labelled a "progressive jazz" <br>guitarist -- certainly "Crash Landing" may warrant the jazz label, while <br>"Jesus Got a Gun" is hard rock, "Cow People" is country pop, and the Forever <br>Bad Blues Band is none of the above (including "Bad" and "Blues"). What a <br>versatile guy!<br><br>I found it interesting that Jon was originally inspired by seeing Ivor <br>Darreg with a 22-tone guitar, but decided not to explore that tuning. I was <br>partially inspired by hearing Jon Catler to get my guitar refretted, but, <br>not knowing of the Darreg connection, I happened to chose 22-tET. Also, I <br>recently saw a whole bunch of 22-tET guitars in an old issue of Experimental <br>Musical Instruments, from which I was getting some tuning info for Manuel. I <br>guess there really is nothing new, but it would be a tragedy if these ideas <br>did not get explored afresh by each new generation.<br><br>I hope to be receiving my guitar neck shortly, and then I'll get to work <br>learning some of my 22-tET keyboard (those stretches have really been <br>hurting my hands) compositions on guitar. Also I plan on practicing lots of <br>exercises that will help me learn to improvise over a harmonic texture that <br>has 7-limit tetrads as basic units, which will include learning lots of <br>good-sounding voicings for these chords. I already have a well-developed <br>theory for a melodic structure from which this harmonic usage can be <br>derived, but I'm going to keep my ears open for any new possibilities that <br>strike me.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 1 Mar 1997 16:33 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01434; Sat, 1 Mar 1997 16:33:07 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01433<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id HAA13493; Sat, 1 Mar 1997 07:30:05 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 1 Mar 1997 07:30:05 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B09E5A8D94E8A.582E@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
