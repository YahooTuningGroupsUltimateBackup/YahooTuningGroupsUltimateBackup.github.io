I believe the <br>preponderance of this kind of numerology to hurt the case for alternative <br>tuning systems among the musical community.<br><br>a) The diatonic system is only a 5-limit system insofar as the consonant <br>harmonies approximate ratios of odd numbers 5 or less. Even calculating the <br>ratios of a purely diatonic progression such as I-IV-ii-V-I is a futile <br>exercise; in any meantone temperament, including 12-equal, the musical <br>reality obliterates all distinctions between varying quantifications of the <br>above progression, and is more beautiful than any of them to boot. To claim <br>(as many would) that the arithmetical construction is more valid than the <br>musical reality is to cease to have any relevance for the realm of music and <br>to engage in a meta-musical game reminiscent of the worst excesses of <br>serialism.<br><br>b) The fact is that certain chromatic alterations were chosen from a pool of <br>many possibilities that would satisfy the rules of melodic/contrapuntal <br>movement. The latter would dictate simply that two voices can be <br>chromatically altered in opposite directions if both resolve by step in the <br>direction of the alteration. But we don't have augmented thirds progressing <br>to perfect fifths, and instances of augmented seconds and augmented fourths <br>seem to be restricted to the case where at least one note is diatonic. The <br>augmented sixth distinguished itself from other possibilities for acoustical <br>reasons; namely, its proximity to a septimal ratio. If nothing else, <br>septimal ratios define a set of "not-too-dissonant" intervals outside the <br>5-limit system, and need not be taken as a foreign musical language.<br><br>I would suggest that people using the limit terminology review Partch's <br>original definition since the "prime" definition seems to lead to a lot of <br>confusion and unneeded complexity while the "odd" or Partch definition seems <br>more suited to musical practice and acoustical theory. The "prime" <br>definition is sometimes useful in describing a tuning system or the practice <br>of tuning itself, but musical reality as concerns the listener is better <br>understood in terms of the "odd" definition.<br><br> -Paul E.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 20 Mar 1997 01:30 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06537; Thu, 20 Mar 1997 01:30:16 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06538<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id QAA22767; Wed, 19 Mar 1997 16:28:14 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 19 Mar 1997 16:28:14 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B181E69F47816.705F@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
