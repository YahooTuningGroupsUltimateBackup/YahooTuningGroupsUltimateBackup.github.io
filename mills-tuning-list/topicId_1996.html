The second is that it is probably<br>the most basic of a handful of justifications (all puns intended) for an<br>OPEN system of tuning - one with an indefinite number of tones per octave's<br>span.<br><br>   The task of either accepting precise renderings of just ratios,<br>including the comma discrepancies it generates, or of tempering in terms of<br>that comma, is almost certainly the single-longest running thread in the<br>history of tuning.<br><br>   Now, we have a new concept that shows only one of those two vital<br>attributes - the difference between large and small whole tones, but<br>explicitly precludes an open system of tuning.  We are faced with a choice:<br>Do we generalize an existing term to where one of its two most important<br>attributes is rendered irrelevant, or at least secondary?  Or, do we derive<br>from the first term, a new term for the new concept?<br><br>   I think that Ivor Darreg's choice of "pseudo<X>" is at least a pretty<br>good term for something that has some, but not all, of the qualities of an<br>"<X>".  Perhaps a "quasi<X>" would be better?<br><br>   If you two really think that it's better to reuse an existing term ...<br>Well...  OK...  "Syntonic comma" certainly wouldn't be the first such term.<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 1 May 1997 04:06 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01549; Thu, 1 May 1997 04:06:13 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01576<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id TAA25649; Wed, 30 Apr 1997 19:04:37 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 30 Apr 1997 19:04:37 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01541108af8d61186a25@[207.207.2.133]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5381 href="#5381">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>5/3/1997 4:32:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>My problem is that I don't know at all the technology to work with that,<br>>so, please: how can I realize it?
