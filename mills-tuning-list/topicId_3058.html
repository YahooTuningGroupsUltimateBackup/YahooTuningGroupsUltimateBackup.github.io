Playing the same melody on opposite<br>> ends of a piano simultaneously, you can get away with a semitone<br>> transposition without much disturbing the "sameness" or "in-tune-ness"<br>> (Yasser gives a melody to use for this, and I didn't believe it until I<br>> tried it!)<br><br>Let's assume that the suitability of a temperament depends upon<br>the most poorly tuned interval in the relevant consonant limit.<br>If you take the Partch odd limit as the definition of consonance,<br>then all octave transpositions of the main intervals have to be<br>counted.  If the octave is not perfect, some equivalent intervals<br>will be tuned worse as a result.  So, the suitability of the<br>temperament diminishes.  If you've got the same pitch set in all<br>registers, it will be difficult to avoid the bad intervals.  A<br>small octave stretching may work to favour the most frequently<br>used intervals but, for this to be acceptable, it must have a<br>very small harmonic effect.<br><br>As an example, if you play two 4:5:6:8 chords an octave apart,<br>you get the intervals 3/1, 5/2, 8/3 and 16/5 coming out.  A<br>mistuning of the octave will become threefold apparent in two of<br>these intervals.  Harmony isn't really octave invariant, as I've<br>argued before, but all these intervals will occur between melody<br>and harmony.<br><br>How big is a piano keyboard?  One semitone at 8 octaves implies a<br>formal octave 100/8=12.5 cents sharp.  That's better than the<br>thirds in 12-equal.<br><br><br>Paul's example of the 8:10:12:15 chord is a good one.  Taking 15/8<br>as a dissonance, this chord will still work best the better the<br>fifths and thirds are tuned, so that their consonance is more<br>evident.  I think 15/8 has some degree of consonance, though, so<br>if this chord is to be used frequently this interval should be<br>considered, so that the difference tones are in tune.<br><br>While experimenting with this, I found that 8:10:15 sounds better<br>than 4:5:7, probably because of the fifth.  4:6:7 is preferable to<br>8:12:15, so 7-limit still rules!<br><br>If the presence of consonances can make up for a dissonance in<br>a chord, it follows that a strong consonance is important even<br>in the presence of other consonances.  So, octaves and fifths<br>should be considered first in choosing a temperament.  I think<br>12-equal works partly by 3-limit harmony plus poorly tuned thirds<br>functioning as weak dissonances.  Also, because memory corrects<br>the tuning of familiar chords.  You're still going to notice if<br>one interval is way out, though.  The worst tuned interval in a<br>chord is still the most important.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  CDRs and DVDs<br>PostedDate:  17-01-98 15:18:37<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  17-01-98 15:18:37-17-01-98 15:18:38,17-01-98 15:17:40-17-01-98 15:17:41<br>DeliveredDate:  17-01-98 15:17:41<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125658F.004E9A42; Sat, 17 Jan 1998 15:18:32 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA28007; Sat, 17 Jan 1998 15:18:37 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 17 Jan 1998 15:18:37 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA28050<br>Received: (qmail 4376 invoked from network); 17 Jan 1998 06:18:34 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 17 Jan 1998 06:18:34 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541100b0e612972c73@[207.207.2.148]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
