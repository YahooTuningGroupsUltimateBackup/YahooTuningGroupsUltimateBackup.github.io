In short, yes, I believe that they are exactly that<br>number of cents.  <br><br>   I recall that Carlos originally described Alpha as 4 steps per 6:5, and<br>Beta to be 8 steps per 4:3 in the liner notes to Beauty in the Beast and<br>elsewhere.  But later in a letter to the editor of Keyboard (or possibly<br>Electronic Musician;  I can't recall which) she stipulated that that was<br>really more of a characterization than a definition, and that the<br>definitions are 78CET and 64CET.  (She didn't use the "CET" terminology<br>though.)  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 6 Feb 1997 14:44 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA27873; Thu, 6 Feb 1997 14:44:21 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA27964<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id FAA26265; Thu, 6 Feb 1997 05:41:55 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 6 Feb 1997 05:41:55 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199702060838_MC2-10F7-80F2@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4735 href="#4735">ðŸ”—</a>Matt Nathan &#x3C;mattn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/1997 6:00:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Gary Morrison wrote:<br>> <br>>    Similarly with Matt Nathan's suggestion of "YET" for a tuning whose<br>> chromatic step size is an even number of Yamaha units (1024ths of an<br>> octave), I suppose one could also add "MET" for a tuning whose step size is<br>> an even number of millioctaves.<br>> <br>>    But that's probably a real dead end.<br><br>Now I'm prompted to come up with meanings for BET, GET, JET, LET, NET, <br>PET, SET, VET, and WET too. <heh><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 6 Feb 1997 15:25 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA28027; Thu, 6 Feb 1997 15:25:14 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA27958<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id GAA27551; Thu, 6 Feb 1997 06:23:26 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 6 Feb 1997 06:23:26 -0800<br>Message-Id: <32FA64A2.2FC4@teaser.fr><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
