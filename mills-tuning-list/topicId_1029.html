I'll have to give it a whirl when I get a chance.  <br><br>   The importance of xenharmonic ear-training, I think at least, has been all<br>too often overlooked.  Early on when I started getting into 88CET, I made a 3 CD<br>(CDR actually) set of ear-training, sight-singing, and nomenclature exercises.<br>(Perhaps in the case of 88CET it would better be described as "ear-straining,<br>sight-screaming, and misnomenclature!)  But they've been valuable when I'm<br>waiting around in traffic, on the treadmill in the mornings, or on trips to<br>visit my parents in Houston.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 22 Oct 1996 15:11 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02171; Tue, 22 Oct 1996 15:12:50 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02144<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id GAA11898; Tue, 22 Oct 1996 06:12:46 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 22 Oct 1996 06:12:46 -0700<br>Message-Id: <961022130919_101610.3043_JHP80-4@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3824 href="#3824">ðŸ”—</a>Pat Missin &#x3C;patm@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/24/1996 10:05:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Any chance of something like this for us poor PC users??<br><br><br>Pat Missin  -  patm@globalnet.co.uk<br><br>"...my music's a lot better than it sounds!"
