Here are some thoughts on recent postings (look out<br>now, he's naming names...):<br><br>**********<br>To Neil (Digest 792) --<br><br>At first I didn't want to respond, because you must be tired of the<br>harangue, and we don't seem to be on the same page. On the other hand, you<br>seem so fervent in your music-making desire, I can't give up totally.<br><br>The idea of free music makes me think of my days as a child in the 60's:<br>free love, free music, whatever.  That's your (our) idea, but not<br>everyone would share it.  And, even if you feel there isn't a chance that<br>at least *one* arrangement of your music could make you puke and want to<br>do violence (heard any of your tunes in an elevator, other composers<br>might not feel the same -- it is actually *possible* (real easy, come to<br>think of it) to completely disgrace a work with a heinous arrangement<br>(anybody remember "A Fifth of Beethoven"?).  You think I'm stretching?<br>Guess again...<br><br>As for 'legal' reasons for keeping some sort of control on performances,<br>the days of "immediate content access" are upon us with the Net, and the<br>dreaded term "intellectual property" is a subject WAY too deep to touch<br>here.  I will just say that for the last years of his life Harry Partch<br>lived almost solely on the income from the royalties from his recordings<br>and what little printed material was there (it was a *bare* existence, I<br>assure you).  So here's a guy who went to the wall for his art: if you<br>would freely distribute his work, you would have left him looking for<br>jobs at Burger King.  After his death, the ever dwindling money helped<br>finance tours, performances and upkeep on the instruments.  This music<br>would have been a whole lot less visible had there not been this minimal<br>sustenance that it created.  And I'm damn sure none of the money from<br>Kronos is going to Dean (for the instruments) or the Partch Foundation,<br>noooooo, I don't think so...<br><br>The others dealt with the elitist issue quite well; I'll just share with<br>you that during my time with the Left Coast version of the Ensemble, we<br>were looked *down* on more often than put on a platform.  Many critics<br>and academics (sorry guys!) felt we were too bohemian to produce quality<br>Partch performances.  They were wrong, of course <g>...<br><br>**********<br><br>Paul Rapoport's little message (Digest 793) had some nice thoughts.  I<br>especially liked the comments about music for the small group.  I have a<br>tough time, sometimes, with a lot of the contemporary classical musicians<br>(like when they are always doing the European post-serialists, etc.).<br>One of the percussionist I really admire as a player was telling me "You<br>know, we *realize* this is not for a large audience, and the mass<br>audience is not what we are trying to reach.  That takes a lot of<br>pressure off and lets us concentrate on the music at hand."  Interesting.<br>Harry's stuff fits in here, to some extent; it never ceases to be at<br>least curious to just about any audience, but I wouldn't ever try to<br>think of it as 'popular' music.<br><br>> I would argue that there is room for both popular and elite<br>> (unpopular?) art, there always has been, and there always will be.<br>> Without an artistic elite, important elements of culture cannot thrive,<br>> and without an educated elite, the major professions would collapse,<br>> and with it most of democratic society.<br><br>And I would add: without the popular, how would we go nightclubbin'?<br><br>**********<br><br>In the same digest, Gary Morrison has the right idea: let us all get on<br>with creating anew; our work is in the present.  Let's have the ideas<br>from the past (recent as it may be) serve as springboards for our own<br>muse.<br><br>> But beyond negligently letting them be forgotten, isn't it best just to<br>> let composers and their music, past and present, stand for nothing<br>> more, nor nothing less, than what they are?<br><br>Sounds good to me...<br><br>**********<br><br>Lastly, Brian Belet had a gem of a posting in Digest 794, with lot's of<br>info from Ben Johnston's perspective.  It was a great read for me, and I<br>think I'll put those thoughts in the next posting.  Thanks, Brian -- a<br>balanced diet for *all* of us (yours truly, too!)<br><br>Til next time,<br>Respectfully in 25/16,<br>Jon<br>|--------------------------------------------------|<br>|   Jonathan M.
