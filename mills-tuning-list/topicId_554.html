A new one is available <br>each year and they may be had at more complete record stores. I have <br>several, and some of the groups cultivate a vibratoless style that <br>emphasizes beatless 6th 7th and 9th chords. The material is corny, but <br>when they are "on a blend" the effect can be breathtaking.<br>	On a slightly different note, does anyone know how train horns <br>are tuned? My office is near the tracks, and I frequently hear beatless <br>chords from these train horns. Is there a little old German man in a <br>shed with an oscilloscope, or what?<br>John Starrett <br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 8 Jul 1996 17:50 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA20005; Mon, 8 Jul 1996 08:50:33 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 8 Jul 1996 08:50:33 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.960708094717.26383A-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
