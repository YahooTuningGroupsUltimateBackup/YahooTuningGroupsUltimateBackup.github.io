Vicentino wrote this madrigal as an<br>example of a composition that employs the three modes diatonic, chromatic<br>and enharmonic. The microintervals of the enharmonic mode are minor dieses.<br>I have rendered it in 5-limit just intonation with minor diesis of 128/125.<br>Thanks to Kami Rousseau for putting it in his website. Download<br>http://www.interlinx.qc.ca/~kami/music/madonna.mid or go to his music page<br>http://www.interlinx.qc.ca/~kami/ and follow the link "MIDI files". No<br>special equipment needed.<br><br>Manuel Op de Coul<br><br>... end of forwarded message...<br><br>My thoughts and analysis of Manuel's MIDI file:<br><br>This work by Vicentino sounds like an excellent example for testing out<br>tuning theories. When I first played it, it sounded like the third chord in<br>the piece was too sharp. But I wasn't sure, because I had some similar<br>surprises when I experimented with a Moussorgsky work. (Click here for<br>details on that experiment.)<br><br>Anyway, I took a "microscope" to the file to understand what was happening.<br>I found that the tuning was accomplished by using MIDI "pitch bends" on the<br>notes, to adjust them from equal temperament to just intonation. (I used the<br>same tuning method on the aforementioned Moussorgsky work.)<br><br>... a short digression into how pitch bending works...:<br><br>A MIDI pitch bend mimics the "pitch wheel" found on many electronic<br>keyboards. As an example, to get a "justly intoned" C Major chord, you'd<br>sharpen the G (via a positive pitch bend), and flatten the E (via a negative<br>pitch bend):<br><br>          C Major chord<br>  ------------------------------<br>  Equal tempered  Justly intoned<br>  --------------  --------------<br>       G+0             G+80<br>       E+0             E-561<br>       C+0             C+0<br><br>The notation used here is the note name, followed by the positive or<br>negative pitch bend value. The values are based on a semitone having 4096<br>pitch bend units.<br><br>... back to the Madonna MIDI file...:<br><br>So, I found that the first four chords were tuned as follows:<br><br>  Manuel's 5-limit just intonation rendering<br>  ------------------------------------------<br>      G minor  G Major  D Major  F Major<br>      -------  -------  -------  -------<br>      G+80     G+80     F#+1281  F+1602<br>      D+160    D+160    D+1842   C+1682<br>      Bb-160   B-481    A+1041   A+1041<br>      G+80     G+80     D+1842   F+1602<br><br>You can see from the above that the transition from the first chord to the<br>second is smooth, because most of the notes don't change (G+80 remains G+80,<br>and D+160 remains D+160). The only change is from Bb-160 to B-481.<br><br>But the third chord (D Major) is a different story. The D+160 becomes a much<br>sharper D+1842 (which explains the "sharpness" I heard when I first played<br>the file). But I wondered; is this how it "should" be?<br><br>... another digression, this time into 5-limit just intonation...:<br><br>A classic way to help visualize 5-limit just intonation is by placing the<br>notes in a two-dimensional table. This is the so-called Duodenarium, from<br>Ellis' translation of Helmholtz' On the Sensations of Tone. The notes are<br>arranged as follows:<br><br>     ascending Perfect Fifths are written over one another vertically<br>     ascending Major Thirds are written to the right horizontally<br><br>Theoretically, the Duodenarium can extend infinitely in the vertical and<br>horizontal directions. Using the "note + pitch bend" notation, the center of<br>the Duodenarium looks like this (with C+0 at the very center):<br><br>  Duodenarium with "note + pitch bend" notation</div>
