For example, 31tet does not uniquely articulate the <br>11-limit, since 11:10 and 12:11 are both represented by 4 steps. However, <br>31tet consistently represents the 11-limit, since given any 11-limit triad, <br>the sum of the best approximations to the inner intervals will be the best <br>approximation to the outer interval. In equal tunings with a small number of <br>notes, consistency is usually a less stringent criterion, while for large <br>numbers of notes, consistency will be the more stringent criterion. The <br>point of the consistency criterion is partially that consonance calculations <br>looking at all consonant intervals individually may not tell you anything <br>about consonant chords. Consistency with respect to triads, however, does <br>imply consistency with respect to tetrads, pentads, etc.<br><br>(By 11-limit triad I mean a triad made up of three just intervals, each of <br>which has a numerator and denominator not higher than 11 (aside from factors <br>of 2).)<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 17 Jun 1996 17:35 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA04811; Mon, 17 Jun 1996 08:35:45 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 17 Jun 1996 08:35:45 -0700<br>Message-Id: <9606171535.AA02874@arthaud.saclay.cea.fr><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
