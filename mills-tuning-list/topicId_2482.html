Reinhard wrote:<br><br><"Microtone" by itself may not have any utility.  It is vague and signifi=<br>es<br><insignificance by itself.  IMHO.<br><br>So, let us just substitute adjectival cognates of two terms that Reinhard=<br><br>considers equivalent and we end up with:<br><br>''The American Festival of Insignificant Music''<br><br>Surely, that is not what you intend! The substantive ''microtone'' is<br>indeed<br>useful for describing all intervals smaller than a semitone, and the<br>adjective<br>''microtonal'' aptly describes something that uses such intervals. For<br>example,<br>''the interval 16/9 differs from the septimal minor seventh (7/4) by a<br>microtone''; or ''Erickson's trumpet melody in _Kryl_ moves microtonally'=<br>'.<br><br>Reinhard continues:<br><br><A discipline of Microtonality, which I adhere to, would include the<br><commonality of all musics from the perspecitive of pitch and their<br><intervallic relationships.<br><br>If I parse this sentence correctly then Reinhard is using ''Microtonality=<br>''<br>to refer to all music using pitches. Since this would then probably<br>include by far the greater part of human music making, I am forced<br>to wonder why Mr. Reinhard sees any need at all to use the term.   =<br><br><br><It is to this end that Alexander J. Ellis<br><invented "cents" which divides the octave logarithmically into 1200<br><cents.  This is the "yardstick" to measure all music microtonally.<br><1200 is a convenient number at the very threshold of pitch<br><differentiation.  =<br><br><br><When the Harvard Dictionary of Music pulished its early 20th century<br><definition of a _microtone_ as "smaller" than a quartertone, it was<br><also describing _just intonation_ as mere theory with no evidence of<br><historical useage and as virtually impossible to negotiate in practice.<br><Both definitions needed to be updated.  If Egyptian music is considered<br><microtonal (which it has), and there is no interval smaller than a<br><semitone in the Maqam system, what does that say about the word microton=<br>e?<br><br><By Mr. Wolf's definition, and that of the early 20th Century Harvard<br><Dictionary of Music, Egyptian music is not microtonal. And the flute is =<br>a<br><woodwind made exclusively with metal.<br><br>No. By Mr. Reinhard's definition, Egyptian music (and I must wonder<br>what exactly he means here - modern Arabic popular music from Egypt?<br>Coptic Church Music? Muezzin calls?) would be ''microtonal'', and since,<br>according to his definition above ''microtonal'' equals ''insignificant''=<br>,<br>Mr.<br>Reinhard would call Egyptian music insignificant. I am unable to refer to=<br><br>the Harvard dictionary, but I find much music made in Egypt to be<br>significant,<br>and often significant precisely because the pitch content is both<br>interesting<br>and beautiful. And while I cannot recall melodic use of microtones (the<br>Muezzin calls aside; the faithfull would not consider this to be ''music'=<br>'<br>in<br>the first place!), I have often heard intervals used that differ from<br>diatonic<br>pythagorean intervals by microtones, thus the music can be heard as havin=<br>g<br>a microtonal dimension, and quite possibly one that goes back to the<br>chromatic and enharmonic genera of the ancient mediterranean. =<br><br><br>As to metal flutes, I cannot follow Reinhard's comment at all: perhaps he=<br><br>would like to hold me responsible for all of the errors in the Harvard<br>dictionary, a curious burden as (1) the book was written before my birth<br>and<br>(2) is named for an institution I have never even visited. For the record=<br>,<br>though, I played baroque flute some years ago, and the only metal on it<br>was on the single key; one of the flutists playing in my recent orchestra=<br><br>piece<br>used a beautiful modern instrument with an ebony body.   =<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Re: Tape Swap release<br>PostedDate:  07-10-97 16:01:57<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  07-10-97 16:01:41-07-10-97 16:01:42,07-10-97 15:00:15-07-10-97 15:00:15<br>DeliveredDate:  07-10-97 15:00:15<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256529.004D0A6C; Tue, 7 Oct 1997 16:01:29 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA09981; Tue, 7 Oct 1997 16:01:57 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 7 Oct 1997 16:01:57 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09974<br>Received: (qmail 721 invoked from network); 7 Oct 1997 07:01:47 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 7 Oct 1997 07:01:47 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01541100b05f875e7530@[207.207.3.4]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
