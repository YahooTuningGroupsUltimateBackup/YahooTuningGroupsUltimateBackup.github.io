The<br>equal and equal & opposite labels (which I now see as ill-chosen)<br>refer to the equations, not the intervals. I've not checked to see<br>whether the beating intervals themselves are each flatter or sharper <br>than their just values in each case.<br><br>While Paul Erlich's point about dividing the ditonic comma is <br>well-taken, historically linear and "irregular" temperaments were <br>constructed by dividing it as well as the syntonic comma. See<br>J. M. Barbour's "Tuning and Temperament."<br><br>The usual term for a regular cyclic tuning whose fifths are sharper<br>than 12-tet (700 cents) is "positive." Examples are Helmholtz's<br>1/8-th skhisma tuning with just major thirds and Sabat-Garibaldi's<br>1/9-th shkhisma tuning with just minor thirds. These are the positive<br>analogs of the 1/4 and 1/3 comma "negative" meantone tunings.<br><br>--John<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 19 Oct 1996 22:32 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03627; Sat, 19 Oct 1996 22:34:12 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03632<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA26064; Sat, 19 Oct 1996 13:34:10 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 19 Oct 1996 13:34:10 -0700<br>Message-Id: <961019203038_71670.2576_HHB65-3@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
