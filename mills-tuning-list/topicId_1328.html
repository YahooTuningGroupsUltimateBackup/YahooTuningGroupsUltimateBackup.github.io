Cage was quite familiar with the language of science, having edited<br>technical publication through the second war and very likely also through<br>his father, a respected engineer and inventor. Cage later accepted the term<br>with a limited definition clearly appropriate to his musical work, and<br>clearly distanced from scientific work. Mr. MacLaren, please learn to<br>_read_ before making criticisms without foundation in fact.<br><br>I have not made a study of the termï¿½s history, but I do recall several<br>mentions prior to Hiller. For example, the famous Paul Whiteman concert<br>where Gershwinï¿½s _Rhapsody in Blue_ was premiered was titled **An<br>Experiment in Modern Music**!<br><br>Letï¿½s get back to tuning... tonality anyone? <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 03:15 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22112; Thu, 5 Dec 1996 11:05:53 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA17230<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id CAA18191; Thu, 5 Dec 1996 02:05:50 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 5 Dec 1996 02:05:50 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961205100103_71670.2576_HHB21-11@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
