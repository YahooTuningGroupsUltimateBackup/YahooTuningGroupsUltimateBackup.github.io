Several of the 9-limit intervals look like secondaries<br>>instead of primaries when represented this way.  In 4 dimensions it<br>>would look like this:<br>><br>>                     5/3 --- 5/4<br>>                     / \10/7 / \<br>>    10/9            /   \   /   \         3/2 --- 9/8<br>>     / \           / 7/6 \ / 7/4 \          \ 9/7 /<br>>    /   \        4/3 --- 1/1 --- 3/2         \   /<br>>   /14/9 \         \ 8/7 / \12/7 /            \ /<br>>16/9 --- 4/3        \   /   \   /             9/5<br>>                     \ / 7/5 \ /<br>>                     8/5 --- 6/5<br><br>This pitch set is just the 9-limit Partch diamond, by the way. There are<br>better ways of visualizing 4- and higher dimensional lattices, though,<br>but you'll have to use your imagination since ASCII isn't up to the<br>task. John Chalmers sent me some lattice diagrams of pitch sets where<br>there are four axes representing the prime numbers 3, 5, 7, and 11. The<br>diagrams were developed by Erv Wilson. Essentially, these are<br>projections of 4-d space onto two dimensions along a very special<br>direction.<br><br>The 3-d diagrams above (which are also used by Wilson) show the basic<br>tetrad with three pitches around an equilateral triangle and the fourth<br>pitch in the center. The fact that its six intervals are represented by<br>lines in six different directions helps one construct fairly complex<br>structures without pitches overlapping in the two-dimensional<br>projection. However, three steps of 7/4 (343/256) will lead to a pitch<br>at the same 2-d location as one step of 3/2 and one step of 5/4 (15/8).<br>So certain structures, like Wilson's stellated hexany, are better<br>represented with slightly irregular triangles.<br><br>The 4-d diagrams show the basic pentad with the five pitches around an<br>equilateral pentagon. Its ten intervals are represented by lines in only<br>five different directions. Complex structures will have many overlapping<br>lines, and it will become difficult to see at a glance which pitches are<br>really connected and which just happen to coincide with a pre-existing<br>line. However, since the diagonal of an equilateral pentagon is the<br>golden ratio times the side, new pitches along a given line will always<br>divide the distance between existing pitches on that line in the golden<br>ratio. The golden ratio is of course the only ratio that has this<br>iterative property. So the magic of the pentagon ensures that one can<br>construct very complex lattices in 4-d without worrying about the<br>pitches overlapping in 2-d. If one doesn't want the lines to overlap,<br>one can use slightly irregular pentagons.<br><br>When John sent me the diagrams, I started drawing my own to determine<br>whether the 4-d CPS scales fit together to tile 4-d space. They do. I<br>had a very intersting e-mail exchange with John and/or the Tuning list<br>at that time. Unfortunately, my e-mail rcords from 3/96 to 6/96, which<br>includes that stuff, got deleted.<br><br>For 5-d, Wilson uses an equilateral pentagon with one pitch in the<br>center . . .</div>
