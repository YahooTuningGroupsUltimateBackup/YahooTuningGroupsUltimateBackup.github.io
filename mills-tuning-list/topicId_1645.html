Does the K2000<br>round to the nearest cent?<br>What was the name of Bill Parod's program, NeXT? Where can one download if<br>from. Will it work on a Macintosh? If not are there similar programs at<br>the Mills college FTP site that will?<br>Thanx<br>Dave<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 10 Feb 1997 01:33 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00657; Mon, 10 Feb 1997 01:33:10 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00655<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id QAA10248; Sun, 9 Feb 1997 16:31:22 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 9 Feb 1997 16:31:22 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v03007800af256a2d5ffb@[130.132.159.45]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4764 href="#4764">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MorriSonics@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/1997 5:49:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> Forget the new millenium!
