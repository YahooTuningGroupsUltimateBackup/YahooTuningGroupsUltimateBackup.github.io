Reinhard's somewhat enthusiastic overview of<br>the world. Please be assured, as Johnny and I have 'taken it outside' more<br>than once that it's all on a contextual level, with no (none!) enmity.<br>Onward...<br><br>Perhaps the greatest mistake is the confusion between "microtonal music"<br>and "music containing microtones". At least I believe this to be the crux<br>of the problem. I would propose that a music *fundamentally* based on some<br>sort of microtonal architecture, in any form, would constitute a piece of<br>"microtonal music". This, therefore, excludes musics that *happen to have*<br>microtones produced as a side effect, as an addition or coloration or<br>ornamentation, or an accident. I believe this to be a very important<br>distinction, and the one on which I base the premise that we are very, very<br>far, indeed, from a world of microtonal pop music.<br><br>After all, if the second schema was the yardstick, then most every<br>orchestral concert I've been involved in has been microtonal, at least in<br>the general vicinity of the back stands of the second violins...<br><br>Johnny had a very telling remark, in response to some of my questions about<br>globalization vs. Kenny G, and his ilk:<br><br>	"The important thing here -- at least to me -- is that there is a<br>	soup of interval useage out there in the real world of music, and<br>	that includes pop."<br><br>Which only heightens the contrast between the two premises: is it<br>microtonal music just because it has a few out-of-tune/in-tune notes? I<br>don't believe it is.<br><br>So then Johnny, after a shotgun attempt at supplying information to back up<br>his claims, tended to reinforce my main point, which was only to keep<br>everyone from overheating with joy that the Microtonal Millenium had<br>arrived! The facts still exist:<br><br>1. Whitney Houston is not a microtonal pop artist.<br><br>2. In spite of any analysis, Pink Floyd could not realistically by<br>considered as composers/performers of microtonal pop -- because adjusting<br>3rds just doesn't overcome the inheirently 12TET underpinnings of the other<br>99% of the work.<br><br>3. Having microtonal (or microtonally sympathetic) personnel at *some* of<br>the stations or print outlets does not constitute mainstream. For heaven's<br>sake, NPR? Mainstream? In Jesse Helm's dreams...<br><br>The other rationalizations were also similarly weak. I didn't realize that<br>the Grateful Dead listened to Ive's 4th before each concert for a year, but<br>then I wouldn't ask Gerry Garcia to be my pharmacist based on his other<br>interests at the time, either. Not to mention that anyone hoping to peg<br>Aaron Copland as a microtonal composer (scattered experimentation<br>notwithstanding) is on shaky ground indeed; like he was a great serialist,<br>too, huh? Nope. Pretty traditional guy, by just about anyone's standards.<br><br>I hope no one took my thoughts on San Diego's microtonal 'scene' in a<br>mean-spirited way, I just wanted to make clear that (since we are speaking<br>of the present) that it is about as nowhere as most anywhere these days.<br>Past history is just that, and no personal slights were intended. Believe<br>me: there may be folks living here that know about it, but nobody doin' it.<br><br>HOWEVER, JR and I do have one potential common ground with rap. In its<br>infancy, with a reliance solely on vocals and rhythm, there was a freedom<br>from rigid harmelodic dogma that hadn't been seen in a great while. The<br>setting of words that mean a great deal to ordinary people, set<br>intervalicly (sp?) more closely to 'real' speech than any piano can<br>produce, certainly warmed my heart -- and I'm sure Partch would love it<br>too, harkening back to his earliest days of text settings in monophonic<br>arrangements (though Harry would have abhorred the violence and brutality).<br>Even though the scents of other musical styles are seeping back in, there<br>seems to be *much* more fluidity, harmonically and melodically, in the<br>vocals of these artists than most any other pop. Of course, that's all been<br>co-opted as it became fodder for Sprite commercials, etc. Damn.<br><br>Well, anyhow, that's one evenings ruminations. I figure I'm quiet enough on<br>the list that I can spew a little occasionally. I like to keep things in<br>perspective, yep...<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Hey, on a completely different note(s), if you haven't stopped by Corporeal<br>Meadows recently, please do (see the .sig). In the last couple of months<br>I've added a few new bits, including a reproduction of a brochure on<br>Partch's instruments that he included with the Gate 5 recordings, only (on<br>the web site) you can hear the instruments demonstrated.<br><br>Also, Philip Blackburn continues to bring out more material in the<br>Innova/Enclosures project, and we're probably just weeks away from the<br>first volumes of the CRI Partch Collection.<br><br>Besides, I never get any complaints about my site. I must have gotten<br>*someone* pissed off here!  ;)<br><br>I'm going to bed now. Bye.<br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br>*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*<br> Jonathan M.
