Will you guys send me the ordering info?<br><br>>Bob Valentine wrote,<br>>}> > Regarding 19TET in particular, perhaps it is the last temperment which<br>>}> > preserves "sameness" of the "big" and "small" major seconds (9:8, 10:9).<br>><br>>To which Gary Morrison replied,<br>><br>>}>    Perhaps this isn't very important (or maybe it is), but this strikes me<br>>}> as a strange way to think of it.  The historical and probably<br>>}> psychoacoustic basis of Western tuning is Ptolemaic JI, which has two<br>>}> different sizes of whole step.  There is therefore no meaning to<br>>preserving<br>>}> an abstraction that represents those two intervals identically.  You can't<br>>}> preserve something ahistorical.<br>><br>>Gary, Bob didn't mean "last" and "preserve" in a historical sense, he meant<br>>it in a counting sense, going from 12TET up to higher and higher ETs. Of<br>>course he was not correct, as 31, 43, 50, and 55 demonstrate.<br>><br>>By the way, Gary is incorrect that modern Western musical practice is<br>>historically derived from Graeco-Roman practice, a point Johnny Reinhard has<br>>made before. I dispute the psychoacoustic connection as well. Ptolemy<br>>described many scales, and the reason moderns have for focusing on just one,<br>>when ascribed to Ptolemy, is a complete distortion of history. If anything,<br>>the West started with Pythagorean tuning, and progressed from there through<br>>schismatic to meantone and finally to 12TET (could've been 19 or 31 but for<br>>convenience and expense).<br>><br>>}The next line in my mail was, "but is this a good thing?", to which I<br>>}don't know the answer.<br>><br>>I tried to make the case that it is a good thing.<br>><br>>}It was since explained to me that "sameness of the big and small major<br>>}seconds" is another way of saying "meantone" and there is<br>>}a historic precedence suggesting that for Western, harmonically oriented<br>>}music, meantone will result in less (or no) "drift" vs. a non-meantone<br>>}tuning.<br>><br>>Meantone results in no drift. A C is a C is a C. Other tunings will drift, C<br>>will often end up around where B used to be. Ben Johnston, a JI composer, has<br>>used this fact in writing Beethoven-style passages, which he follows with<br>>other passages that cause the music to drift back up.<br>><br>>Also the equal sizes of whole step are easier to hear, to sing, and make<br>>modulation much easier. I don't buy that 9:8 and 10:9 are easier to sing as<br>>purely melodic steps than any mean-whole-tone. Johnny Reinhard will agree<br>>that the ability to accurately produce melodic intervals acoustically more<br>>complex than a perfect fourth is a function of rote learning.<br>><br>>}let<br>>}	P5 = number of tempered units per perfect fifth<br>>}	M3 = number of tempered units per major third<br>>}	T  = temperment, number of notes per octave<br>><br>>}If I was correct in my understanding, a succinct definition of<br>>}meantone is that<br>><br>>}	4 * P5 - M3 = T / 2.<br>><br>>T*2, not T/2. Otherwise you are correct.<br>><br>>}Is there a special word for tunings defined by<br>><br>>}	4 * P5 - M3 - 1 = T / 2?<br>><br>>If you mean T*2 instead of T/2, I believe the term "having a syntonic comma<br>>of one degree" is the most concise description out there. The only such<br>>tunings I find interesting are 15 and 22. JI is interesting as well, and 34,<br>>41, 46, and 53 are HASCOOD approximations to JI, which make them second-order<br>>interesting :) 27 is HASCOOD as well.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Re: PLANCK CONSTANT<br>PostedDate:  30-12-97 03:30:09<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  30-12-97 03:27:52-30-12-97 03:27:53,30-12-97 03:27:17-30-12-97 03:27:18<br>DeliveredDate:  30-12-97 03:27:18<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125657D.000D85DF; Tue, 30 Dec 1997 03:29:38 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA27361; Tue, 30 Dec 1997 03:30:09 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 30 Dec 1997 03:30:09 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA27532<br>Received: (qmail 24329 invoked from network); 29 Dec 1997 18:30:07 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 29 Dec 1997 18:30:07 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541102b0cda25a7eb1@[207.207.2.96]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
