How do you define information?  I think<br>it is an effect on Time.  I don't yet know what exactly this effect is, but<br>I have some ideas.  I don't yet know what these ideas mean for Time's<br>relativistic definition, but all this is off-topic, and I can't give away<br>all my secrets.<br><br>So, I must appologize for maybe writing too quick.  I had just come back<br>from work, and was in a bit of a state.  Later, I realized I didn't know of<br>a good way to explain this comment.  Nevertheless, I hold that it is<br>correct, if requirin' further explaination.  I will do my best.<br><br>Lots of stuff has been written on the nature of music.  In late 94, I<br>explained it in terms of my ideas about cognition.  Since then, I have found<br>only two cases where this idea was mentioned by someone other than me -- an<br>old Minsky essay, and the following...<br><br>Beethovan: Music.  What is it?  I don't understand it!  What does it do?<br><br>Schindler: It exhalts the soul?<br><br>Beethovan: B.S. It is the power of music to carry one directly into the<br>mental state of the composer.  What was I thinking when I wrote this?<br><br>Schindler: duh? [listening to something - Kreutzer sonata?]<br><br>Beethovan: A man is trying to reach his lover, but his carriage is stuck in<br>the mud.  She will only wait so long.  This is the sound of his aggitation!<br><br>..from the movie "Immortal Beloved", for all it was and was not.  I suppose<br>things like "the language of music" or "music tames the savage beast" fit<br>along these lines too, but these are expressions more than things people<br>think about.<br><br>So the idea is that music is a sort of "fake information".  The brain hears<br>it, and thinks it's learning.  But it doesn't know *what* it's learning->  I<br>believe that all information has a certain character that makes learning<br>possible (the old "Music of the Spheres", with appropriate name).  Music can<br>imitate this, offering a kind of generic data that the brain accepts,<br>generating appropriate reinforcements (emotions) just like you were learning<br>to drive or whatever.<br><br>So, while music is a form of communication, in that it can create a specific<br>mental state in the listener that was first in the mind of the composer (or<br>maybe out of nowhere, if certain conceptualist techniques are used- alg<br>comp, dice rolling, etc), specific data cannot as yet be transferred (that<br>is, things like wagon wheel, or mud) without words.  This aside, I hope I've<br>established that information is in there.<br><br>How is the information stored?  I believe it's all rhythm.  Pitch is just a<br>way to fit more rhythm in.  I believe all musical devices (including melody,<br>fugue, harmony, polyrhythms, etc) have a useful definition in this theory,<br>and I have classified all the musical devices I could think of.  There is<br>the matter of minor is "sad", and major is "happy", but I'm hoping to god<br>this is cultural.  A single sustained dyad might cause a reaction, but so<br>does looking at a bright red wall.  The study of which harmonies effect your<br>liver, or which colors heal your spleen really beg the question.<br><br>With all that out of the way, I can explain my post.  Say I'm an alien<br>concerned with sending some music to earth.  I want to impress the<br>Earthlings with how much "information" I can fit into a three minute song.<br>Would I send music tuned in 36 note/octave 7-limit, or in 72 equal?<br><br>Well, information is stored in the rhythm, and multiple rhythms are played<br>at once, kept discrete by their pitch.  If my ear sorted these rhythms by<br>tracking each individual pitch in the tuning, I'd use 72-tone, no contest.<br>I do have some kickass alien-powered absolute pitch, but my auditory<br>perception is just like the human auditory perception -> it sorts these<br>rhythms using relative pitch.<br><br>Well it must be obvious what I'm getting at.  The number of intervals<br>provided by the just tuning is far greater than those of the equal-step tuning.<br><br>Carl<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com><br>Subject:  Call me a "Zartist"<br>PostedDate:  12-12-97 23:35:56<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  12-12-97 23:34:00-12-12-97 23:34:01,12-12-97 23:33:44-12-12-97 23:33:44<br>DeliveredDate:  12-12-97 23:33:45<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656B.007BF3BF; Fri, 12 Dec 1997 23:35:49 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14184; Fri, 12 Dec 1997 23:35:56 +0100<br>Date: Fri, 12 Dec 1997 23:35:56 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14172<br>Received: (qmail 20233 invoked from network); 12 Dec 1997 14:35:52 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 12 Dec 1997 14:35:52 -0800<br>Message-Id: <19971212223658718.AAA489@NIETZSCHE><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6733 href="#6733">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>12/19/1997 9:29:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>>> So, the melody C-D-Dbb-Cx-Dbb-Cx-Dbb-D is the same as C-D-C-D-C-D-C-D?<br>>>Question: can you _sing_ this progression... accurately?
