I've done a little bit of investigation of them.<br><br>_____________________________________________________________<br><br> Generator by Native Instruments allows you to 'wire' together (connect)<br>onscreen modules in a very flexible and powerful way.  You can download a<br>demo version from the web page at www.native-instruments.de .  I contacted<br>Michael Kurz michael@native-instruments.de via email and he said that in a<br>future version he intends to add a Tuning Table module to allow the user to<br>set the tuning of the synth.  He said,<br><<Alternative tuning are something that I find very interesting, too.<br>However we have not got around to implementing it yet in Generator since<br>we have many other features planned which we have given higher priority<br>to.  We will definitely put in tuning tables in a future version of the<br>software, especially since someone (you) has now asked for it.>><br><br>  He will include a number of common tunings as presets as well.  Currently<br>you can create n-ET scales.<br>According to Michael,<br><<The values you send to a pitch (P) input on a module in Generator don't<br>have to be integers. So if you bear in mind that Generator uses units of<br>100-cent semitones, i.e. a value of 12 specifies an octave, you just<br>multiply any microtonal step value by an amount like 12/34 for a 34 tone<br>scale to get the Generator pitch value. In this case step 34 (the octave)<br>converts to 12 (an octave in Generator's units).  And it doesn't have to be<br>a scale with a pure octave either. Multiply by 12/15.385 to get Wendy<br>Carlos' alpha scale, for example.>><br><br>_____________________________________________________________<br><br>Reality by Seer systems, also very powerful, allows re-tuning at the patch<br>level.<br>Their web page is at www.seersystems.com .  They have some screen shots<br>there which can give you a pretty good idea what it can do.  The also have a<br>demo CD available.  According to Ted Henderson ted@seersystems.com ,<br><<Reality's microtonal capabilities are very extensive. Each patch can<br>divided into 128 zones and each zone can be indiviually tuned. We do not yet<br>support the MIDI Tuning Spec, but I'd be happy to show you how to create a<br>template that will make future work with alternate tunings "relatively easy<br>to use.">><br>_____________________________________________________________<br><br><br>These synthesizers have a number of advantages.  They both cost less than<br>$500, so if you already have the required hardware you're most of the way<br>there.  As you upgrade your computer your synthesizer gets better, able to<br>handle more complex patches and polyphony.  The capabilities are not frozen<br>by the hardware on the date of purchase;  upgrades can fundamentally<br>increase their power as time goes by installing new synthesis methods and<br>algorithms. Try that with your TX81Z!  These synths use floating point math<br>internally so they have very good accuracy.<br><br>If we make our tuning wishes known to these relatively new companies<br>hopefully we'll establish support for alternative tunings as fundamental to<br>how they operate.<br><br>Fred.<br>---------------------------------------------------------<br> Fred Kohler, #7-240 Burnside Rd E, Victoria, BC, Canada<br> phone:(250)388-7918  email:Fred_Kohler@bc.sympatico.ca<br>---------------------------------------------------------</div>
