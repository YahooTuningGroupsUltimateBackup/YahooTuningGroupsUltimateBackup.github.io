To leave the well-trodden tracks a<br>little bit behind us, lets design an 11-limit scale (thank you, Manuel Op de<br>Coul, for introducing me into these parameters) within a twelfth, based<br>on the tetrad 5/7/9/11. A short way into the attempt we encounter the<br>interval between two important members of the new scale, 7/5 and<br>15/11. They are only 45.56 Cent apart. If we do not want to destroy the<br>harmonic context, we have to use this interval as one of the building<br>blocks of the scale. Thus we end up with a 39JT version within the<br>twelfth, containing such nice intervals like 11/9, 9/7, 15/11, 7/5, 11/7, 5/3,<br>9/5, 15/7, and 11/5, but also a lot of 'ballast intervals" and a variety of 4<br>different steps between 42.11 and 66.74 Cent. The corresponding ET<br>with 39 steps of 48.77 Cent is not too bad, but the whole process is<br>cumbersome, and the result not very inviting to a practical application.<br><br>However, if we restrict ourselves to using a triad instead, then we can<br>be bold and even attempt a 13-limit scale within the twelfth, based on<br>5/9/13. Our basic building block in this case appears between 9/5 and<br>15/9, has 133.24 Cent and leads us with little effort to a 15JT scale<br>within the twelfth, having only two different steps, 114.5 Cent and<br>133.24 Cent, respectively. The "defect" of the scale's ET (with 126.80<br>Cent per step) is not larger than the one of the 39-step version above,<br>despite the much larger step distance, and this is really an inviting scale,<br>containing in its just version 15/13,13/9, 5/3, 9/5, 13/5 and, if we are not<br>too puristic, also 4/3 (325/243) and 9/4 (729/325).<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 20 Dec 1996 03:09 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA09396; Fri, 20 Dec 1996 03:12:02 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10828<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id SAA09292; Thu, 19 Dec 1996 18:11:59 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 19 Dec 1996 18:11:59 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612200208.VAA24966@copland.udel.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
