Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/1997 2:06:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Many of the JI enthusiasts neglect to mention that the language of<br>Common Practice (i.e., Western c. 1600-1900 plus Tin Pan Alley, etc.)<br>music requires the vanishing of the syntonic comma. Some form of<br>temperament (not necessarily equal despite Neil's claim, but any regular<br>or irregular meantone temperament) is therefore required for<br>performances of this music. If one wishes all the chords to be perfectly<br>pure, and one does not make constant slight adjustments to the pitch<br>level of common tones, one will find the pitch of the music wandering,<br>usually descending by several commas. But that does not mean JI music<br>cannot support chord changes. From the latest issue of The Microtome, an<br>interview with Ben Johnston:<br><br>"I asked myself, suppose in writing some of the really very intense slow<br>movements that he did, Beethoven had not had the tempered scale to work<br>with, but had instead just intonation, what might that music have been?<br>Then I tried to write that piece, as an exercise for myself. It's<br>actually part of a piece--I liked it well enough that I put it into a<br>piece. But at first of course it's just to find out. The richness is one<br>thing, the flexibility is another. The typical Beethoven progression,<br>for example will cause you to drop by a microtonal amount every time the<br>progression repeats itself. What I did was to work it out that the pitch<br>would drop, gradually, until the whole thing drops almost a half step,<br>and then I force it to come back up by working out progressions that<br>would make it do that. That is, of course, quite different from what<br>Beethoven was dealing with. He would have had to deal with that had he<br>been actually using just intonation with the kind of interests that he<br>had."<br><br>For guitarists, the set of pitches that Ben Johnston needed for this<br>example is quite forbidding, as is any interval less than a comma near<br>the middle of the fretboard. Equal temperaments make sense for guitar<br>music because only then is the same set of pitches available on all<br>strings, and because styles that make use of bending come to grief when<br>one encounters a dog-legged fret. Of course, a fretless guitar<br>alleviates all these problems, but even so one still has to contend with<br>the error of one syntonic comma in tuning the open strings of a guitar<br>to something resembling standard tuning. This will be a problem in any<br>tuning that is not a meantone tuning (12-, 19-, and 31-equal are<br>meantone tunings that happen to be finite). Neil H. has stated that the<br>interval between the G and B strings on his 34-tone guitar is one degree<br>of the tuning larger that the "best" major third, and Jon Catler's D and<br>G strings are one syntonic comma farther apart than a just perfect<br>fourth. My 22-tone guitar also has two adjacent strings separated by a<br>major third augmented by one degree; although this interval is only 1<br>cent off a just 9:7, it is too low (approx. Eb-G below middle C) to<br>sound consonant by itself.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com><br>Subject:  Re: TUNING digest 1254<br>PostedDate:  02-12-97 02:51:00<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  02-12-97 02:49:22-02-12-97 02:49:22,02-12-97 02:49:16-02-12-97 02:49:17<br>DeliveredDate:  02-12-97 02:49:17<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256561.0009FF2D; Tue, 2 Dec 1997 02:49:11 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03891; Tue, 2 Dec 1997 02:51:00 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 2 Dec 1997 02:51:00 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03889<br>Received: (qmail 23445 invoked from network); 1 Dec 1997 17:50:53 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 1 Dec 1997 17:50:53 -0800<br>Message-Id: <19971202015150281.AAA134@NIETZSCHE><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
