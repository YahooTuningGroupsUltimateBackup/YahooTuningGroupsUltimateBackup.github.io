It may<br>well be that one of his pieces is worth more than all my efforts<br>put together.<br><br>I do think I have the lead on quantity, however.  He puts his<br>output at about half a CD.  I suppose that is between 20 and 25<br>minutes.<br><br>I just did a census of my hard disk and counted 745 files with a<br>total playing time of about 45 hours.  Some of these are<br>duplicates, and some are definitely not worth listening to.  But<br>most are finished compositions, and some have even received<br>favorable review by esteemed members of this list.  Probably<br>somewhat more than half of them are my "improvisations", but the<br>rest are arrangements of other peoples compositions.<br><br>I used 145 different scales.<br><br>Am I losing something by committing to all this automation?  <br>Certainly.  But I am also gaining other things.  As they say in<br>the programming world, I can work at a higher level and let the<br>computer take care of the details.  I think it is like the<br>difference between writing novels with a quill pen and a word<br>processor.  Instead of a spell checker, I use a harmony checker.<br><br>But transcendental and irrational tunings can't be subjected to<br>this form of analysis unless they are first approximated in JI<br>terms.  I think it's simpler just to work within a JI framework<br>to start with.<br><br>Put in it's most fundamental terms, instrumental music is an<br>attempt to make machines sing.  In the realm of mechanical<br>musical instruments, Temperament was the easy way.  That was<br>then.  This is the electronic age.  Temperament is<br>computationally difficult, and Just Intonation is easy.<br><br>Marion<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 13 Oct 1995 15:26 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id GAA28807; Fri, 13 Oct 1995 06:26:28 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 13 Oct 1995 06:26:28 -0700<br>Message-Id: <E70ZVZGDAQX8*/R=UCVAX/R=A1/U=WATHENMJ/@MHS><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2131 href="#2131">ðŸ”—</a>COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>10/13/1995 6:57:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>The algorithm for calculating a root is actually not so difficult.<br>This calculates a square root:<br><br>    Answer := Of_Number;<br>    loop<br>       Delta := (Of_Number / Answer) - Answer;<br>       if abs Delta <= Answer * Epsilon then<br>          return Answer;<br>       end if;<br>       Answer := Answer + 0.5 * Delta;<br>    end loop;<br><br>Epsilon indicates the required precision and is the smallest number that<br>makes a difference.<br>I suppose that modifying this to do the twelfth root of 2 is easy.<br>It converges very rapidly so it's doable by hand.
