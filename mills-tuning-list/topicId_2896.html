Well, there is just intonation and Pythagoreanism, but they are<br>>}> not temperaments. There are 22- 29- 41- & 53-tone equal, but I do hope<br>>}> that by now I have explained why these 'temperaments' are valueless, for<br>>}> they cast out the consonant thirds from their tonal fabric as soon as<br>>}> one tries to preserve the consonant fifths. =20<br>><br>>}I really don't understand this statement "cast out the consonant thirds".<br>><br>>}	12TET  7  M4 =3D=3D  4 P5<br>>}	19TET  11 M4 =3D=3D  6 P5<br>>}	53TET  31 M4 =3D=3D 17 P5=20<br>><br>>}Is the "problem" that the 53TET (and others) has a choice of thirds to<br>>}use depending on context (in this run of 31 M4, we probably came close<br>>}to a variety of M4 that were diatonically correct to the original root,<br>>}if we built the equivalent of I, IV, V)?<br>><br>>I can't understand your notation. What is M4? Anyway, Gregg is referring to<br>>the fact that 22-, 29-, 41-, 53-equal and JI are not meantone temperaments.<br>>You're going to tie yourself (and the music) in knots if you try to use these<br>>tunings for traditional diatonic music. Modulations to nearby keys become<br>>extremely awkward, as do single-key chord progressions such as I-IV-ii-V-I<br>>and I-vi-ii-V-I.<br>><br>>}Of course, this choice gives you lots of VERY consonant thirds, and,=20<br>>}using them when it is important harmonically (to fix audible beating)<br>>}does not mean we really care whether we hit them exactly melodically<br>>}(since we already have determined that melody can be a lot sloppier<br>>}than harmony).<br>><br>>JI is perfect harmonically but contains melodic errors of a syntonic comma.<br>>(The other non-meantone temperaments mentioned are worse than JI in both<br>>respects). If one treats sustained tones as single pitches (not altering them<br>>by a comma mid-stream) these melodic errors can accumulate over the course of<br>>a piece, often landing the piece as much as ten commas below where it<br>>started. 1/4-comma meantone temperament is perfect melodically but contain<br>>harmonic errors of no more than 1/4 syntonic comma. These errors do not<br>>accumulate since consonant intervals of the same type do not combine to form<br>>other consonant intervals. So the relevant question is not whether melody can<br>>be a lot sloppier than harmony but whether melody can be four (locally) to<br>>forty (globally) times sloppier than harmony. I think the answer depends on<br>>the exact sizes of the errors and, of course, the musical context, but I<br>>think meantone wins in most cases. Of course, one can write piece<br>>specifically for JI which avoids most of its disturbing characteristics, but<br>>the vast majority of classical composers did not do this.<br>><br>>In a performance context one would have to deal with far fewer pitches in a<br>>meantone rendition. These practical benefits of meantone may have been the<br>>decisive factor in making meantone the most important tuning in the West from<br>>1500-1800.<br>><br>>31-equal is close to 1/4-comma meantone; 19-equal is virtually 1/3-comma<br>>meantone, having harmonic errors no larger than 1/3 comma.<br>><br>>}Ezra Simms is currently advocating 72TET (he approached it from a few<br>>}other directions) and has articles in Perspectives of New=20<br>>}Music (vol 29, their microtonal series) and Computer Music Journal<br>>}in recent years. As a REAL tuning system to advocate vs 12TET, this=20<br>>}one meets all the tests above.<br>><br>>I do like your argument (deleted). Ezra Sims, though, attributes some ratios<br>>to 72TET that it cannot express consistently. 72TET is only consistent<br>>through the 17-limit.<br>><br>>}Regarding 19TET in particular, perhaps it is the last temperment which<br>>}preserves "sameness" of the "big" and "small" major seconds (9:8, 10:9).<br>><br>>} 	major scale...<br>><br>>}	12TET :  2 2 1 2 2 2 1<br>>}	19TET :	 3 3 2 3 3 3 2<br>>}	22TET :  4 3 2 4 3 4 2<br>>}	29TET :	 5 4 3 5 4 5 3<br>>}	41TET :	 7 6 4 7 6 7 4<br>>}	53TET :	 9 8 5 9 8 9 5<br>><br>>}But... is that a good thing? Thanks a lot.<br>><br>>This sameness is what characterizes a meantone temperament, and as I have<br>>stated above, I think it is a good thing for diatonic music.

It is unfortunate that the best<br>>meantone scales that 72TET has to offer are the same as 12TET scales. This<br>>often prevents one from taking advantage of the superb 5:4 of 72TET in a<br>>diatonic context.<br>><br>>The "major scales" in 15- and 22-equal sound really out-of-tune melodically<br>>because of the two different sizes of major second. So even if the ii triad<br>>and modulation are avoided, these tunings will sound weird for diatonic<br>>music.<br>><br>>I have non-diatonic reasons for liking 22-equal. Blackwood has written about<br>>good reasons for liking 15- and 16-equal in Perspectives of New Music.<br>><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  More on Just Intonation 2<br>PostedDate:  23-12-97 23:44:53<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  23-12-97 23:42:40-23-12-97 23:42:40,23-12-97 23:42:11-23-12-97 23:42:11<br>DeliveredDate:  23-12-97 23:42:12<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256576.007CBFE8; Tue, 23 Dec 1997 23:44:32 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA24700; Tue, 23 Dec 1997 23:44:53 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 23 Dec 1997 23:44:53 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA24718<br>Received: (qmail 12496 invoked from network); 23 Dec 1997 14:44:50 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 23 Dec 1997 14:44:50 -0800<br>Message-Id: <34A0A105.3CED@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6806 href="#6806">ðŸ”—</a>gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)</h3><span>12/25/1997 5:29:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Gregg Gibson wrote:<br><br>> To pretend that a singer can<br>> accurately produce an interval four or five perfect fifths above the<br>> tonic is nonsense; this is a commatic disjunct dissonance, and not<br>> accurately singable.<br><br>There's an assumtion Gregg makes here that goes to the heart<br>of his argument, and I hope I won't be accused of carping by<br>pointing it out.  It is that temperament has something to do<br>with singing.  Certainly, singers temper intervals.<br>However, they do not require an explicit system to do so.<br><br>Actually, four fifths octave reduce to two major tones.  I<br>wouldn't be at all surprised if it were possible to sing them<br>both accurately.  9/8 functions as a melodic consonance, but<br>this is lost in 19 equal.  However, this is not worth arguing<br>about.  More to the point, I would not expect the average singer<br>to produce accurate intervals from an equal temperament.<br>It is not unreasonable, however, to expect a guitarist to<br>tune her five strings to five just fifths.  A temperament<br>that takes this into account does have advantages.<br><br>Now, to get to the heart of the matter.  What difference<br>does it make to a singer if I play a chord sequence on my<br>keyboard in schismic temperament, comma shifts and all?  I<br>wouldn't expect any variable pitch instrument to follow<br>instructions to more precision than 12 pitch classes.  If<br>the harmony makes sense, it shouldn't be too difficult to<br>sing in tune with it.  As the commas are well below the<br>melodic limen, they shouldn't cause any confusion.<br><br>> These matters are widely known ? they are also widely ignored or denied<br>> or imperfectly known. The ignorant very typically imagine that We Clever<br>> Moderns have invented a new music in which all the Stupid Old Ideas of<br>> the dead past don't matter.<br><br>Firstly, Gregg, there's a character there that comes out<br>as a filled in rectangle on my screen.  Can you try keeping<br>to strict ASCII?<br><br>Secondly, I consider myself to be post-modern.<br><br>Thirdly, the important point.  No musician before the 1950s<br>had a digital computer.  Theorists before this date, therefore,<br>did not need to consider the tuning of an instrument that can<br>produce a very large number of notes to a high degree of<br>precision, but that nevertheless requires each pitch to be<br>specified numerically.  You can bet singers in the 16th century<br>produced an enormous variety of intervals, but there was neither<br>a reason to write them all down, nor the ability to do so.<br>Despite all this, schismic temperament is at least implicit in<br>medieval Islamic theory, which is where I got the idea from.<br>So, there's nothing new there.<br><br>It is in no way arrogant to say that I have an instrument of<br>hitherto undreamt of resources.  I intend to use those resources<br>to the utmost of my abilities, in order to make up for it's<br>deficiencies relative to an acoustic instrument.  Part of that<br>means explicitly specifying intervals of less than 50 cents.<br>Also, using septimal harmony.<br><br>The advantages of using meantone (or mesotonic -- a better<br>word, but I'm not used to it) need not be stated, as anyone<br>who subscribes to this mailing list must be aware of them.  I<br>expect most people will tune fixed pitch instruments to such<br>a temperament, if they wish to play harmonic music, and they<br>will be missing very little.
