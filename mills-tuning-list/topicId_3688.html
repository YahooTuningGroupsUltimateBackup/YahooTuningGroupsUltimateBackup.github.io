When Novatone<br>cratered, Mark Rankin took over some of the remnants of the company and<br>started selling interchangeable fretboards more or less as kits.<br><br>   Best I've been able tell though, Mark doesn't try to make a living off<br>it.  It's more of a spare-time hobby that more or less breaks even.<br><br>   I see what appear to be two similar patent numbers on my fingerboards:<br>4132143 and 4132149.  I wouldn't be surprised if one of those two numbers<br>is just a misprint (or that I'm misreading it).</div>
