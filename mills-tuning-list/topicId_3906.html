For most of these concepts, I confess to being mathematically<br>challenged; I like the beauty of them, once I understand them, but such<br>understanding is a very new (and tenuous) thing for me. I thought<br>someone here might have explored such ideas, or be interested in<br>applying them. I've got an intuition they apply to tuning, but I am<br>definitely not articulate enough to say what any relationship might be.<br>Anyone have any thoughts or speculations?</div>
