        <a href="/mills-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>88CET #19:  Timbral Considerations</h1><h3><a id=2137 href="#2137">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/1995 8:41:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Orchestrational considerations are something of a mixed bag; some traditional<br>orchestrational notions apply equally well to 88CET, but others are better<br>rethought a bit.  Some need to be rethought for concrete, physical reasons, and<br>others need to change strictly for aesthetic reasons.  <br><br>   As for the aesthetic reasons, some timbres just aren't all that exciting in<br>88CET.  Classical guitar sounds I have found to be less interesting than<br>harpsichord for example.  That was sad to accept for me, having played classical<br>guitar for many years.  Piano sounds about as good in 88CET as in any tuning.<br>Even though I've used flute sounds successfully for variety in my 88CET<br>compositions, there are better instrument sounds to use for 88CET.  Clarinets<br>and brass instruments probably work best of all.  Saxophones and bowed strings<br>generally work fairly well too, although not as spectacularly well as brasses.  <br><br>   There is an amusing footnote to these instrument choices:  Some of the<br>instruments that sound best in 88CET cannot be constructed physically in 88CET<br>tuning.  Notably, winds use the lower-harmonic vibrational modes to extend their<br>range.  That is harmonics like single- and double-octaves and twelfths which lie<br>outside the 88CET system.  It's far more difficult to get a tube to "overblow"<br>in the seventh- and eleventh-harmonic modes.  On the other hand, I've given some<br>thought to the purely-cylindrical flute's tendency to overblow to a flat octave,<br>to create an 88CET flute as an instrument that play 13 steps per<br>quarter-tone-flat-octave.  <br><br>   In the realm of the concrete physical issues are organ timbres.  Does adding,<br>for example, a four-foot flute rank to an eight-foot diapason rank in a<br>nonoctave tuning produce a richer timbre, or just a false note (the octave) that<br>doesn't exist in the tuning system?  Best I can tell, the answer is more likely<br>that it'll sound like a false note not in the tuning.  With such strong<br>power-of-two harmonics, you almost invariably create those dreadful false<br>perfect consonances.  Instrument timbres with modest-to-normal levels of<br>octave-harmonics don't pose any such concerns though.  <br><br>   Of course the case of a timbre's partials creating harmonies not present in<br>the tuning system is certainly not unique to nonoctave tunings.  The seventh and<br>eleventh harmonics don't fit into the usual 12TET system, and the fifth harmonic<br>is not represented very accurately.  The big difference is that we're creating<br>false consonances with very basic, and thus frequently louder, harmonics than<br>before.  It is therefore a bigger concern in a non-octave tuning than in an<br>octave-based tuning, but is a concern in either.  This of course doesn't rule<br>out writing for individual ranks, but the lack of the free-form doubling damages<br>the organistic quality of the music.  <br><br>   In the vein of less basic physical concerns, certain instruments' overtone<br>structures seem to lend themselves to certain chords over others, as is the case<br>in most any tuning.  I haven't studied this topic extensively, but I have<br>noticed an especially strong example of this:  The 6:7:10 chord seems more<br>discordant than the 6:7:9 subminor triad on timbres with weak even harmonics,<br>whereas the reverse seems to be true on timbres where even harmonics are about<br>the same strength as odd.  I'm sure that there are many other examples of this<br>sort of phenomenon, and those wishing to investigate it may want to start with<br>this example.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 14 Oct 1995 08:35 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id XAA15368; Fri, 13 Oct 1995 23:35:19 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 13 Oct 1995 23:35:19 -0700<br>Message-Id: <951014063255_71670.2576_HHB5-8@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2143 href="#2143">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/1995 10:11:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>As John (C) briefly aluded here, graphical methods can place frets,<br>toneholes, lengths of bars, or most any other physical dimension to pretty<br>decent precision.  <br><br>   In the case of 12TET, once you precisely calculate whatever dimensions you're<br>interested in for the square root (tritone), the square root of that (minor<br>third), and the product of the two (minor sixth), you've got a 4TET scale.  You<br>can graph those points and "french curve" in the rest of the notes' dimensions<br>to pretty decent accuracy.  Certainly far greater accuracy than the "lipping"<br>range of a wind instrument.  <br><br>   Fixed pitch instruments like the bells mentioned here would have a little<br>error here and there, but not a whole lot more than you get from typical<br>well-temperament schemes.  (Now of course the "error" from ET in well<br>temperament schemes are intentional and desirable, but I'm sure you get my<br>point.)  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 15 Oct 1995 17:00 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA26733; Sun, 15 Oct 1995 07:59:42 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 15 Oct 1995 07:59:42 -0700<br>Message-Id:  <9510150758.aa10492@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
