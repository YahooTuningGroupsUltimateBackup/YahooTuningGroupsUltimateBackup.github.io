In Java, some teachers pay close attention =<br>to<br>intonation while other pay virtually no intention. I heard Ki Suhardi mak=<br>e<br>corrections of septimal comma size, striking his gender to play a pitch a=<br>nd<br>then singing slightly above or below the tone. In my rebab lessons with<br>him, Pak Hardi really had me focus on tuning. For example, I had to tune<br>the upper string to gender tone 6 but the lower string had to be a beatle=<br>ss<br>fifth below, which was close to the pelog gender's  pitch 2, but sharp of=<br><br>the gender's slendro 2 and this tuning was used by the rebab for both<br>slendro and pelog. In melodic passages, the problem of tuning consecutive=<br><br>slendro intervals (which vary from around a 9/8 to a 7/6) required<br>considerable attention. Except for playing the open strings together at<br>certain points, the lessons were conducted monophonically, without use of=<br><br>other instruments.<br><br>I think that the tuning of monophonic singing or playing should not be<br>dismissed as a theme for research. Many singers or players, even without<br>perfect pitch memory, can keep a reference pitch in memory over extended<br>periods with great accuracy. Room resonances often assist in this, and a<br>situation like the Javanese _palaran_, offers plenty of opportunity for<br>reinforcing reference pitches from which a singer or rebab player can<br>correct her intonation.<br><br>The studies of Boomsliter and Creel suggested some ways in which a solo<br>might proceed interval-by-interval in a just context, and my old favorite=<br>,<br>the _Handbook of Irish Music_ by Richard Henebry has some data, albeit<br>poorly organized, deeply suggestive of underlying just patterns. (The bes=<br>t<br>Sean-Nos (Irish solo singing) singers have rock solid pitch memory and ma=<br>ke<br>pitch discriminations between pitches where one would expect to find<br>syntonic comma shifts). I know that there are significant objections to<br>conclusive statements about vocal and unfixed-pitch instrumental intonati=<br>on<br>- largely argued from the position that vocal tones are too transient - b=<br>ut<br>I think that anyone studying performance practice close enough aquires<br>skill in identifying a subjective pitch center from which constructive<br>observations can be made.<br><br>Daniel Wolf<br>Frankfurt<br>    =<br><br><br> =</div>
