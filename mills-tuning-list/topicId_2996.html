It makes sense<br>that the two grow together.  In the paper I mention the value of<br>making electronic simulations of pieces using ATS, as an aid for<br>(acoustic) performers to learn a new piece.  Other purposes: checking<br>the ears,  creating the work itself (first and foremost I'm  a<br>composer); creating an electronic realisation of a microtonal score of<br>which there's no recording. There are quite a lot of problems with<br>simulation  -  especially the time it takes... in fact it's<br>interesting how difficult it is to do well.<br><br>However - I don't own a synth - I don't like them.  The unit I use is<br>a Roland S750 sampler, which I bought back in 1991. (_speaking of<br>which microtonal instruments do you have_ my main instrument is an<br>1890's Bechstein _but unfortunately it's not too keen on being<br>re-tuned _).<br><br>The Roland is a useful tool, but there are 3 major drawbacks.<br><br>1)  Limited RAM capacity  (18Mb). (The EMU E4 takes 128Mb, but the<br>Emulators don't tune in cents. I think they tune in 1/64th of a<br>semitone, which is unhelpful).<br><br>2)  There are only 255 partials (=`Keygroups' in AKAI-speak ; `Zones'<br>in EMU-talk). This means, for example, that if one wanted to create a<br>simulation of a string trio in 22-ET, and each instrument is given<br>the (very restricted) range of 3 octaves, that already takes up<br>(3*3*22) = 198 partials.  And that's just for, say, a single bowed<br>stroke, so there's not much left over for pizzicato_ let alone<br>simulating a chamber orchestra_ So there's multi-tracking_ There's<br>also the E4 again, which has 1000 zones (or is it unlimited ? But, as<br>I say,  the E4 tunes in 1/64ths_ and, there's the Kurzweil K2500_,<br>and Kyma...)<br><br>3)  But it takes for ever to build these patches- tailoring the<br>samples, naming the partials, assigning them to MIDI note numbers<br>etc. (I work with one sample per note, so a single violin patch may<br>take up to about 32 Mb).<br><br>And, after all this, the simulation is NOT music.  Its just a<br>simulation  - stiff, inexpressive, fairly lifeless_ (yes, there's<br>physical modelling, and its getting better_ slowly.)<br><br>Anyhow, the gist of all this is : my wish list would include things<br>like :<br><br>Tuning resolution minimum 1 cent, preferably less (any thoughts on<br>this?); Number of Partials (Keygroups, Zones) limited by memory only,<br>not hard coded into the architecture;  Include on-board absolute pitch<br>meter (but would put the price up); Macro and template procedures for<br>building unconventional `instruments';<br><br>AND -<br><br>A kind of `kit' mother keyboard with a large number of movable slots<br>into which a user configurable number and arrangement of keys of<br>different sizes and colours could be fitted_  And new types of control<br>for keys (taking the idea of `after touch' further_)<br><br>The discussion paper will be on the Net, and Emailed freely, but hard<br>copies will also be sent to about 200 major composers, acousticians,<br>instruments builders/manufacturers.  If anyone would like to include<br>any ideas in this Appendix please let me know.  I'm asking because, as<br>I say, I don't own a synth or a VL, and I'm not really a computer/MIDI<br>buff, so I'm sure some of you will have much better ideas than me.<br>But please don't make any suggestion so technical I won't understand<br>them! (If its OK with you, I would acknowledge the list rather than<br>individuals (?)).<br><br>Hope that's a good idea.  I'm still hopelessly busy, but will get<br>back to you as I can.<br><br>All best,<br><br>Patrick Ozzard-Low<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Patrick Ozzard-Low" <patrick.ozzard-low.itex@norfolk.gov.uk><br>Subject:  Favourite recordings<br>PostedDate:  06-01-98 14:49:55<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  06-01-98 14:49:32-06-01-98 14:49:32,06-01-98 14:49:28-06-01-98 14:49:29<br>DeliveredDate:  06-01-98 14:49:29<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256584.004BEF88; Tue, 6 Jan 1998 14:49:25 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29534; Tue, 6 Jan 1998 14:49:55 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 6 Jan 1998 14:49:55 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03816<br>Received: (qmail 429 invoked from network); 6 Jan 1998 05:49:48 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 6 Jan 1998 05:49:48 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199801061342.NAA11364@imail.norfolk.gov.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
