It stands for "Sandell Harmonic Archive." People for<br>   whom this dataset may be useful are Acousticians, Psychoacousticians,<br>   researchers in Music Percepion and Cognition, researchers in Digital<br>   Signal Processing, Music Theorists, and Musicologists.<br> <br>   Over 1300 different notes have been analysed. Complete chromatic runs<br>   from the standard playing range of essentially all the non-percussive<br>   instruments of the modern orchestra have been included; for example,<br>   individual analyses of 32 different oboe notes (the chromatic scale<br>   from the pitches a#3 to f6) are available.<br> <br>   A WWW front end for SHARC is available at:<br> <br>   http://www.parmly.luc.edu/sharc/<br> <br>This page contains links to explanations of what SHARC is, how the<br>database can be downloaded, as well as a number of graphic plots of<br>various aspects of the data.  Of special note is the ability to plot the<br>spectra for individual notes in various ways, and to hear syntheses of<br>the spectra over the web (if your computer is suitably set up for<br>audio).<br> <br>I have a Listserver, or distributed email list, set up to keep people<br>informed about changes I make to SHARC.  I am now also inviting all<br>timbre researchers to join to the list and use it as a forum for<br>general discussions of issues of musical timbre.  If postings<br>become suitably frequent, and the dialogues lively, I am open to the<br>idea of starting an independent listserv devoted to the topic.  But for<br>now, it will serve the dual purpose of being devoted to both SHARC and<br>timbre discussion in general.  The list currently has 50 members.  Please<br>join the list and tell us about your research interests in musical<br>timbre!<br> <br>You can actually join SHARCLIST through a web page!  (Many times less<br>painless than the usual way of joining by sending obscure commands<br>through email!)  Simple connect to<br>    http://www.parmly.luc.edu/lwgate/SHARCLIST/SHARCLIST.html<br>..and follow the instructions.  (Note:  your web browser has to support<br>"Forms".)<br> <br>Have fun!<br>- Greg Sandell<br> <br>(* SHARC is unrelated to the DSP chip of the same name. )<br>--<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 2 Mar 1996 14:51 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id FAA25161; Sat, 2 Mar 1996 05:51:19 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 2 Mar 1996 05:51:19 -0800<br>Message-Id: <0099EBD002FDC49C.D1C0@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
