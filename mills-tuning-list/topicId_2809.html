Even if the melodic limen were to be set<br>so low as 40-45 cents - which would absolutely astound me - this would<br>still favor 19-tone equal, as the 31-tone equal (tuning degree 39 cents)<br>would be still excluded from consideration. The 22-tone equal is<br>worthless, for the reasons I have given on the list. 24-tone equal is a<br>mere mirror of 12-tone equal, with no way to harmonically or melodically<br>integrate its two parallel cycles of fifths.<br><br>But as I have stated before, it is slightly easier to argue that the<br>true melodic limen is 60-65 cents than 50-55 cents. In actual<br>performance the hurry and excitement tend to reduce, not to increase the<br>aural acuity of the audience and performer. The real debate is not<br>between 19-tone advocates and those who advocate still more tones, but<br>between 19-toners (enneadecaphonists) and 12-toners (dodecaphonists,<br>pace the Schoenbergian alternate meaning). The 12-toners have so far had<br>much the better of the argument - almost wholly by default, because<br>19-tone has been scarcely considered, and that due to the habits of<br>musical instrument designers, not due to any more profound cause.<br><br>Instead of attending to real issues, microtonalists have busied<br>themselves with schemes for 31 or 50 tones in the octave (or other<br>systems even wilder,) which only makes ordinary musicians smile at the<br>lunacy of the professors. But one day 19-tone equal _will_ come into its<br>own. In that time 12-tone equal will be viewed as we today consider<br>Siamese 7-tone equal temperament - a curiosum of the past, and evidence<br>that mankind _is_ capable of expressing himself musically - to a limited<br>extent - with the most crippled, impoverished means. (Those whose<br>hypocritical hypersensibility leads them to conclude from this last<br>point that I am insulting the Siamese, I leave to their affected<br>outrage, much good may it do them.)<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Judging Effect of Temperaments<br>PostedDate:  17-12-97 01:18:06<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  17-12-97 01:16:02-17-12-97 01:16:03,17-12-97 01:15:41-17-12-97 01:15:42<br>DeliveredDate:  17-12-97 01:15:42<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256570.0001BAC5; Wed, 17 Dec 1997 01:17:53 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17474; Wed, 17 Dec 1997 01:18:06 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 17 Dec 1997 01:18:06 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA17477<br>Received: (qmail 9701 invoked from network); 16 Dec 1997 16:18:01 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 16 Dec 1997 16:18:01 -0800<br>Message-Id: <34977C94.5341@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6734 href="#6734">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>12/19/1997 9:29:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>One of the main difficulties in judging of the effect of temperaments in<br>>actual music is that so much depends on the inspiration of the composer,<br>>and the culture and nature of his audience.<br><br>   For whatever it's worth, although I disagree with Gregg on a number of<br>his comments, I certainly agree with him here!<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Reply to Kris Peck, in Hopes of Converting Him to the True Faith<br>PostedDate:  20-12-97 07:04:58<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  20-12-97 07:02:52-20-12-97 07:02:53,20-12-97 07:02:27-20-12-97 07:02:28<br>DeliveredDate:  20-12-97 07:02:28<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256573.002135F6; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 07:04:41 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22538; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 07:04:58 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 20 Dec 1997 07:04:58 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22502<br>Received: (qmail 14303 invoked from network); 19 Dec 1997 22:04:54 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 19 Dec 1997 22:04:54 -0800<br>Message-Id: <349BC23B.7BC7@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
