They may send me to look at<br>some of<br><br>>these,  so I would like to start with recommendations from those<br>possessed of<br><br>>the critical listening (thus the addresses on this mini-spam). The<br>tuning<br><br>>list can delve into such small increments of musical scale, surely that<br>is a<br><br>>group of people that really listen.<br><br><br>Good question -  especially since the good 'ol US-of-A isn't known for<br>great chamber music size halls. People on the East Coast would probably<br>have a better take on it. I did just recently, through a high-end audio<br>friend, see an article about the following:<br><br><br>"Concert and Opera Halls: How They Sound" by Leo L. Beranek, 1996: The<br>Acoustical Society of America, ISBN 1-56396-530-5<br><br>$49.95; at bookstores or call 800-809-2247<br><br><br>Chapter subjects include: Acoustics and Music; Seeking A Common Language<br>For Musicians And Acousticians; World Concert Halls Ranked According To<br>Acoustic Quality; etc. The author is no punk: Harvard Dr., awards from<br>many acoustics societies, supervised the acoustic design of the UN<br>General Assembly back in 1947, etc.<br><br><br>The current issue of BBC Music magazine has an interesting, if much more<br>superficial, article on concert halls, more on the large side...<br><br><br>Me? Hey, no comparison: Wigmore Hall in London. Just heard a<br>mixed-ensemble chamber music concert there in January - absolute heaven<br>for listening and a real treat for the performers to play there as well.<br>I doubt the school will pop for the marble walls, but the dimensions and<br>layout of the room can't be beat. C'mon Ed - get 'em to send you on a<br>junket across the pond!<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Later, Adam Silverman disturbed the electrons to form the following:<br><br><br>>From this I can only assume that Drummond is not familiar with<br><br>>the opera of Richard Strauss, the play of Oscar Wilde, the biblical<br>source,<br><br>>etc.  How embarrassing!<br><br><br>Very, if true. Assumptions are, eh, risky, no? <br><br><br>>Overall, the CD is worth buying for Elizabeth Brown's piece.  As for<br><br>>Newband's future, I hope that an effort will be made to better <br>acquaint<br><br>>composers with the tuning concepts inherent in JI instruments as well<br>as<br><br>>the playing techniques involved.  The work by LeBaron (as well as <br>Julia<br><br>>Wolfe's "Steam," not included here) exhibits a shallow relationship<br>with<br><br>>Partch's instruments; if Newband continues to commission new music <br>from<br><br>>established composers, this issue must be dealt with.  Once it is,<br>perhaps<br><br>>they will establish themselves as a good force in bringing Just<br>Intonation<br><br>>music to the common composer.<br><br><br>Agreed, on the success/non-success of the venture so far. I recall one<br>*very* dismal 'collaboration' in San Diego years ago, with the<br>instruments ending up being so much 'ear candy'. Ugh.<br><br><br>That said, I wouldn't hold my breath. I know for a fact, having been (to<br>a degree, naturally) a composer  myself that my attempts to harness the<br>possibilities of the Partch instrumental resources met with complete<br>non-wonderfulness. In spite of having played them for years, studied the<br>theory, played all of them - too deep to grasp at that point. But then<br>I'm not much of a composer, at least then; maybe now.  Nope, they're gone<br>in NY. Crap. Next time...<br><br><br>Besides, these instruments weren't envisioned, built, cared for, composed<br>for, performed on JUST so they'd be around for every Joe Young Composer<br>to come and take a swipe at them! Frankly, I find that such efforts<br>cheapen the heritage of those items. We sometimes lose our perspective<br>(oh hell, I probably never *had* one) on how they came about - people<br>just think the instruments are here for everyone to use to their own<br>purpose. "Sonata No. 1 for Harmonic Canon, Blo-boy and Trombone". I<br>certainly hope Dean handles this equitably, and reaches out beyond the NY<br>inner circle of comps (there must be many deserving JI aesthetes out<br>there) but I wouldn't want to be in his shoes. <br><br><br>My guess is that if it all works out, the "good force" will bring Just<br>Intonation music to the *exceptional* composer. Pedestrian efforts will<br>come up short. And maybe folks will view it (the Partch instrumentarium)<br>not as a "Bert's U-Rent Microtonal Instrument Barn", but as an<br>inspiration to do something original themselves. Then again, maybe not.<br><br><br><br>Ouch. I just fell off the soapbox.... . . .   .      .        .<br><br><br>Nice seeing you all again.

They played a Mozart piano sonata to students before an IQ test, and<br>>the average score went up 10 points or so.<br><br>   That one of the hardest problems in IQ testing of signing apes, like the<br>lowland gorilla Ko-Ko, is that it's hard to explain to them that their task<br>is to answer the questions as quickly and accurately as possible, so that<br>they'll get as high as score as they're capable.  Most of the time, they<br>just take it as another fun little game, and use it as another opportunity<br>to joke and play with the psychologist.<br><br>   It's not totally impossible that part of the reason why Mozart's music<br>could have this effect, is that it puts subjects into a mood appropriate<br>for IQ testing - calm and inquisitive in part.  Stockhausen, or in a<br>different way, Ted Nugent, might have a different effect.<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 22 Apr 1997 12:37 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA19325; Tue, 22 Apr 1997 12:37:15 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA19264<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id DAA06500; Tue, 22 Apr 1997 03:35:12 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 22 Apr 1997 03:35:12 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.970422110602.6029B-100000@kali><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
