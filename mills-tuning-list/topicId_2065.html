Sure, that is an issue, but once we have a <br>> tuning we like, can we COMPOSE something in it that is meaningful and <br>> profound?<br><br>Have you ever tried to get shot and couldn't?  If not, you can't imagine how<br>frustrating it is.<br><br>I agree with your point whole-heartedly.  It is, in very fact, at the root of<br>my pursuit of alternate tunings.<br><br>I'm working on the assumtion that a tuning which correlates to the way we and<br>our world are made would, *by virtue of that fact*, provide a more solid<br>foundation for more meaningful and profound compositions.  That would seem to<br>be a foregone conclusion, at least through the window of my world-view.  If<br>any of you disagrees with that assumption and can cite anything other than<br>purely circumstantial evidence against it, please shoot me down.  Please! :-)<br> Like Paul E. said last digest, "question everything."  It should provide<br>fertile ground for all sorts of interesting discussions pertinent to tunings.<br><br>Unfortunately, I haven't yet many compositions to play you as proof of my<br>theory, since I'm just beginning to explore it.  Well, O. K., I only have<br>one.  It's not very widely available yet.  It is track #6 "The Bullroarer" on<br>a CD called "Rings of Power, Volume One," which is instrumental music<br>inspired largely by Tolkein's books, and is intended for use by Game Masters<br>in role-playing to set the mood for various parts of the story-line.  "The<br>Bullroarer" is ostensibly Hobbit music - i.e., music that might have been<br>made by Hobbits themselves.  It sounds, not surprisingly, really a lot like<br>Rennaissance music might have sounded had it been composed by Scottish or<br>Irish folk musicians who had suddenly got a formal musical education -<br>except, of course, that it stays in tune throughout all chord changes.  Not<br>very remarkable on the surface, but fun, useful (if you do Middle-Earth<br>role-playing) and very good education for me!  The CD is available at an<br>increasing number of game supply stores in the US and Germany.  Each of the<br>other tracks on the CD use, to some extent, either Pythagorean or one of the<br>more recent historical tunings - nothing bold there.  But I'm working on it,<br>darn it!<br><br>If there were some way I could post the music itself to the list, I'd do it.<br> I tried to post it as a Real Audio file to the Globalshowcase site, but my<br>!@#$ AOL browser wouldn't cooperate with their system.  Someday, by golly...<br><br><br>David J.
