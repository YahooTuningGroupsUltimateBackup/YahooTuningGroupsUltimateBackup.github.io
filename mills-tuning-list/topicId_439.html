This piece has over 40 different chords, and is in no<br>key whatever, plus it's a monster to solo over (especially if you're<br>improvising). I sometimes feel "guilty" because I don't play in just<br>tuning (which I call pure tuning), but tell me...how could I play a<br>piece like "Mysteries" in pure tuning? Perhaps I'm out to lunch, but it<br>seems that the structure of the piece does not lend itself to this<br>system. What kind of just system would allow one to use so many<br>different chords freely?  When Lou Harrison says "Just intonation is the<br>best intonation," for what sort of music is he referring to? I really<br>like using tons of chords in some of my pieces...perhaps this is a<br>dilemma which other composers through the ages have found themselves in<br>regards to eq temps versus pure tunings. I don't always write modal<br>works, although I love that sort of music as well.<br>    Anyway, hoping to get some comments...Hstick<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 20 Mar 1996 21:15 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA25393; Wed, 20 Mar 1996 12:15:15 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 20 Mar 1996 12:15:15 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01510106ad76041eceb1@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2687 href="#2687">ðŸ”—</a>xen@tiac.net (J.
