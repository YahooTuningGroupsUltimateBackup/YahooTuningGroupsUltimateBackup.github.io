The article discusses something called "dynamic intonation"<br>on MIDI instruments. Perhaps some folks on the list will find this interesting.<br>What I found more interesting was a sidebar to the article by Scott Wilkinson<br>plugging the MIDI Tuning Standard. Even more interesting was another sidebar<br>(uncredited) which mentioned the Just Intonation Network and its web site<br>and also -- drum roll, please -- the Alternate Tuning Mailing List! Perhaps<br>this will generate some new subscribers to this list. Too bad we don't have<br>a FAQ handy for newcomers.<br><br>On a somewhat unrelated note (tone?), I happened across the lastest issue of<br>the journal Expermental Musical Instruments (vol 11, no. 2). Among other<br>articles, this issue includes one entitled "The Monochord" by Sasha<br>Bogdanowitsch which covers some history of the monochord, a few tips for<br>construction of a monochord, and some scale charts. This issue of EMI also<br>mentions their web site at http://www.thecombine.com/emi (mostly still under<br>construction it seems).<br><br>John<br>pusey@remqhi.enet.dec.com<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 30 Nov 1995 08:53 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA08416; Wed, 29 Nov 1995 22:52:59 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 29 Nov 1995 22:52:59 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01510100ace2f4a23f9b@[199.248.149.115]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2349 href="#2349">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/1995 9:38:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I would think that your best places to start in Just Intonation are David<br>Doty's book "The Just Intonation Primer", and R. David Hill's cassette<br>lecture/demo "Introduction to Nontraditional Harmony".  They are both available<br>from the Just Intonation Network's "Just Intonation Store".  <br><br>   According to the most recent flier I can find for them, they cost $8 for<br>Doty's book, and $20 for Hill's lecture/demo.  Also include 25% for postage.<br>Their address is 535 Stevenson Street;  San Francisco, CA 94103.  <br><br>   I confess that I haven't read Doty's book, but Hill's lecture/demo is just<br>faaaaantastic!  But I can't definitely say that I have heard no negative reports<br>about Doty's book, and at least three very positive ones.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 1 Dec 1995 08:51 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA27977; Thu, 30 Nov 1995 22:51:37 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 30 Nov 1995 22:51:37 -0800<br>Message-Id: <951201064831_71670.2576_HHB49-1@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2351 href="#2351">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/1995 4:22:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Oooop.
