The common<br>musical palette for duration is much more limited than than for pitch. But<br>the ratio of 2/1 is still the fundamental structure, with 3/2 not far behind.<br><br>One idea that follows from this - tempered rhythm! Instead of triplets being<br>exactly 3/2 speed, one could speed them up or slow them down a touch. This<br>would then permit rhythmic puns.<br><br>Rhythm has an extra dimension that pitch doesn't - phase. Two steady<br>pulses with the same speed can still differ, they can be offset from each<br>other in time. <br><br>Really, pitch and pace - pardon my dread ignorance of proper musical terms -<br>are not wholly separate. A steadily repeated click sets up a regular<br>pulse at say 3 beats per second. But speed it up to 24 beats per second and<br>it's a very deep pitch. Somehow as this pulse/pitch transition is traversed,<br>the sensitivity to phase or registration in time is lost. Perhaps that loss<br>of phase is just what the transition is about. <br><br>Adding phase makes the mathematical structure messier. Pitch intervals do <br>seem to form a group. Moving one interval after another is the same as moving<br>some third interval. With rhythm or pulse, there are two operations. One can<br>shift the pulse in time, or change the speed. <br><br>Shifting a pulse back and forth in time looks like a group structure -<br>there's a nice inverse. But changing speed is messier. It makes good sense to<br>double the speed of a pulse. But if I halve the speed, then there are two<br>ways to do this - I need to skip every other beat, but do I choose to skip<br>the even or odd beats? So the speed-up operation appears not to have a<br>well-defined inverse. <br><br>Jim<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 14 Dec 1996 21:34 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04277; Sat, 14 Dec 1996 21:36:24 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04276<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA29197; Sat, 14 Dec 1996 12:36:21 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 14 Dec 1996 12:36:21 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612141535_MC1-D16-AE95@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
