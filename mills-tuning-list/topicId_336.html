Contrapuntally,<br>you could present this somewhat like you would suspended fourth.  That would be<br>kind of like suspending the fourth on elastic string!  In other words, the<br>fourth would go down a little bit to 9:7 above the tonic in the suspended chord,<br>rather than stick at 4:3 like in a true suspension, then finally resolve to 5:4.<br>I found it more effective, however, to not move the bass up a fourth from<br>scale-degree five to one until sounding the final tonic triad.  <br><br>   Neither of these two subtly different progressions seems to heighten the need<br>to resolve as much as does a 9:7 injected into the leading-tone rise path, as<br>suggested in the previous tip.  That's probably because the suspension gives the<br>sense that the authentic cadence has - conceptually speaking - already taken<br>place, even though we still have a note left over.  <br><br>   Here's another intriguing and somewhat similar possibility.  I won't dedicate<br>a tip to it because I haven't studied it enough to get a clear feel for its<br>usefulness.  Consider quartal harmony, or in particular, the three-note chord<br>formed by two 4:3s stacked atop one another.  The top note in that chord is a<br>16:9 minor seventh above the root.  It's certainly possible to move that chord<br>to a dominant seventh (with omitted fifth) by dropping the middle note from 4:3<br>above the root to 5:4 above the root.  That however is a rather weak harmonic<br>movement, probably because the harmonic tension doesn't really change all that<br>much.  <br><br>   But what if we make that movement through the 9:7?  The tension certainly<br>goes up.  One probably contrapuntally interesting way to do that would be to<br>have root and seventh first move up by 28:27 to where the 4:3 above the root<br>becomes 9:7, and then move that middle note down the remaining 36:35 to form the<br>5:4 against the moved root.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 8 Feb 1996 22:08 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id NAA28164; Thu, 8 Feb 1996 13:08:18 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 8 Feb 1996 13:08:18 -0800<br>Message-Id: <960208210404_71670.2576_HHB78-4@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
