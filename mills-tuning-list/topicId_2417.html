A pitch bend is 3<br>>  instructions.  To send 16 of these takes 3*16/3125*1000=15.36 ms,<br>>  or twice as much if you include the note-ons as well.  Is this<br>>  really a problem?<br>><br>>  > i don't like using pitch bend...the pitch bend affects all notes on that<br>>  > channel, meaning that you can really only do monophonic stuff.  yuck.<br>><br>>  That depends on your software, of course.  With GM, you're<br>>  limited to 15 melodic notes per MIDI stream.  It's quite<br>>  possible to go beyond this, but I've never wanted to.<br><br>It's not really a matter of ips.  It's a problem for real-time playing under<br>most circumstances.  If one has an Opcode Studio 5 or something like it, it's<br>possible to set up a "patch" that will reassign any note number to any MIDI<br>channel/OUT in real time.  But for most of us that's not an option.  Not to<br>mention that spending 12 to 15 channels per timbre virtually prohibits even<br>moderately complex orchestrations without a staggering amount of MIDI gear.<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Mckyyy@aol.com<br>Subject:  FasTrak<br>PostedDate:  21-09-97 21:52:04<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  21-09-97 21:51:48-21-09-97 21:51:49,21-09-97 21:50:58-21-09-97 21:50:58<br>DeliveredDate:  21-09-97 21:50:58<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256519.006D1B32; Sun, 21 Sep 1997 21:51:43 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03283; Sun, 21 Sep 1997 21:52:04 +0200<br>Date: Sun, 21 Sep 1997 21:52:04 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03281<br>Received: (qmail 20011 invoked from network); 21 Sep 1997 19:48:01 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 21 Sep 1997 19:48:01 -0000<br>Message-Id: <970921133559_-928565629@emout14.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
