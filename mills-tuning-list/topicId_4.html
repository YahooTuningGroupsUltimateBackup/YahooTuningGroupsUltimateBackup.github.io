I came across Richards's dissertation quite by <br>chance and thought I'd bring it to everyone's attention, though I suspected<br>that you might already know of it or of him.<br>	 BTW, Richards is at Hamilton College in Clinton, NY and has <br>been very active publishing and performing. One of his colleagues <br>forwarded my post to him and he emailed me with some information about his<br>books on microtonal performance. Needless to say, I have invited him to <br>join the Tuning list. I also mentioned you and the AFMM series.<br> <br>--John<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 17 Sep 1995 10:35 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id BAA03677; Sun, 17 Sep 1995 01:35:22 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 17 Sep 1995 01:35:22 -0700<br>Message-Id: <00996880.BA24B200.77@ee.sharif.ac.ir><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2017 href="#2017">ðŸ”—</a>        Tom Parsons &#x3C;twp@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/1995 5:05:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>mcgeary thomas nelson <mcgeary@UX1.CSO.UIUC.EDU> wrote,<br><br>> I would strongly suggest an underrecognized and appreciated article by<br>> Rudolph Rasch, "Does 'Well-Tempered'Mean 'Equal Tempered'?" in "Bach,<br>> Handel, Scarlatti: Tercentenary Essays, ed. by Peter Williams.<br><br>Thanks; I just read it.
