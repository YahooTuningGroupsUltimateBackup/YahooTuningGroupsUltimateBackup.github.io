Thanks, Marion.  So for now I still maintain my<br>>conclusion that two pitches separated by the interval 2:1 are the same note<br>>in different registers.  That triad inversions sound different is the result<br>>of a different set of intervals within each inversion of the chord, and so<br>>does not seem to require throwing out the idea of octave equivalence.<br><br>Actually, David, I think Marion is making the same mistake as you, so it<br>may not be as obvious as I thought :-)<br><br>Taking the LCM as a function of two integers, there is nothing special<br>about 2, other than it being the smallest prime.  LCM(1,2) but<br>LCM(1,3)and LCM(1,15547)574.  There is something special about even<br>number multiples if you look at half-wavelength traces.<br><br>If you allow for the octave equivalence of intervals, all triadic<br>inversions contain the same intervals.  However, if you disallow octave<br>equivalence of intervals, and you define harmony in terms of intervals,<br>you must also reject the octave equivalence of harmony.  Inversional<br>invariance follows from octave invariance, unless you have a<br>privileged root to lift the otonal/utonal degeneracy.<br><br>That notes separated by an octave are the same note in different registers<br>is a truism.  That notes separated by an octave are more similar than<br>notes separated by other integer multiples is a psychoacoustic question<br>open to proof.  The experiments I know of are inconclusive on this.<br>Even if it were proved, however, it would not prove octave invariance of<br>harmony.  My own ears testify to the contrary.  You may need to contract<br>the octave dimension of harmonic space, but that doesn't mean it has to<br>be removed completely.<br><br>To specifically mention the ratio 15/1.  To my ears, this sounds like<br>two independent notes.  It doesn't have the roughness associated with<br>dissonance, so I would call it a consonance. 15/8, however, is<br>a dissonance as is 16/15.<br><br>In some cases, in order to represent a lattice on a two dimensional<br>page, the octave dimension is removed.  This is a good idea.  In<br>some cases, chords are simplified by pretending they lie within an<br>octave.  This is also a good idea in some circumstances.  Some rules<br>of harmony are also octave invariant.  This is fair enough, as no<br>quantitative system of harmony is good enough to distinguish all chords.<br>In many cases, notes are named within an octave, and extended beyond<br>it.  With most tempered systems, just octaves are retained.  This is<br>a very good idea under most circumstances.  However, none of this<br>implies that octave transpositions are harmonically negligible.  Many<br>people state this, and I believe it to be a result of sloppy thinking.<br>That is my manifesto, and I welcome comments on it.<br><br>On a slightly different thread, despite favouring the LCM, I am fully<br>aware of its faults.  Primarily, the major tetrad 4:5:6:8 and<br>the major 7th 8:10:12:15 both have an LCM of 120.  To my ears, and<br>those of tradition, they are not equally consonant.  To borrow a<br>phrase: the LCM is the worst measure of dissonance, except for all<br>the others.<br><br>                         Graham<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 5 Jul 1997 18:48 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05353; Sat, 5 Jul 1997 18:48:34 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 5 Jul 1997 18:48:34 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05384<br>Received: (qmail 8961 invoked from network); 5 Jul 1997 16:48:28 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 5 Jul 1997 16:48:28 -0000<br>Message-Id: <970705124520_-1527843658@emout11.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5764 href="#5764">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>7/5/1997 11:10:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>So far, all of the limits I have seen discussed have been _upper_ limits.<br>> Has anyone explored the idea of lower limits - say, a lower 3-limit, which<br>>would not allow a power-of-two to stand alone in a numerator or denominator?<br><br>   Oh yes!
