Even in the Young, the difference between F and F#<br>is too great to call equally well in tune.  This is a big difference. <br>       To my ears and history,  the point of well temperament was to provide<br>a suitable palette of tonal differences between the keys.  It is the<br>irregularity of these tunings that was an art form, as opposed to the<br>scientific procedures we have to use to create a 12TET.  <br><br> Also, <br>Manuel Op de Coul writes;<br>>A tuning is a well temperament when there is no wolf fifth and it can<br>>be played in all keys. One precise definition is that there may be no<br>>fifths larger than pure and no major thirds smaller than pure. <br><br>      I think a more precise definition would mention the increasing<br>tempering of the root tonic thirds with increases in the the key signature.<br> It is the contrast between various levels of tempering that was such a<br>strong topic during the period between Mozart and Chopin.  There is no<br>contrast in ET, so I would offer that we keep the words separate. <br><br>    I can only see confusion if we are to call ET another well-temperament.<br> The overwhelming use of "well-temperament" these days has been  to indicate<br>the irregular, circulating temperaments that arose between the meantone era<br>and the proliferation of ET,   which I peg at the mid 1800's, ( I know, there<br>is a lot of controversy to push that date earlier, or later,  but I don't see<br>enough supporting evidence to make me think it was really happening before<br>Chopin. <br><br>Regards, <br>Ed Foote<br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn.  <br>P.s.  "The Beethoven In The Temperaments"  CD is in the print stage,  and<br>should be ready September 1.  Once we have that out, these discussions on the<br>older temperaments can have something to key off of.  <br><br>    <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 2 Jul 1997 17:49 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA31262; Wed, 2 Jul 1997 17:49:51 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 2 Jul 1997 17:49:51 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA31275<br>Received: (qmail 9167 invoked from network); 2 Jul 1997 15:49:32 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 2 Jul 1997 15:49:32 -0000<br>Message-Id: <c%apï¿½adian-Asset%lRS-970702154017Z-1384@mars.acadian-asset.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
