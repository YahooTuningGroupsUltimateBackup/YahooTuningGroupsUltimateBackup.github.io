It would<br>appear that Bill Alves has already taken Brian to task for his habit of<br>being alternately obsequious and insulting to the academics here, so I<br>can perhaps leave the heavy lifting to others.<br><br>>Thus it's clear why Cage developed such a close<br>>relationship with the composers at Darmstadt:<br>>Stockhausen and Cage were attracted to one another<br>>as irresistably as two psychic surgeons at an AMA<br>>convention.  One whiff of the meaningless jargon<br>>spouted by Cage, and Darmstadt knew he was one<br>>of their own.<br><br>I think a more interesting comparison of the relationship between<br>John Cage and the European Modernist tradition would actually be<br>afforded by that horrible man Pierre Boulez : -). In addition to<br>dissing him, Brian could have shored up his delusional edifice by<br>linking Boulez to IRCAM and the Freemasons in the next paragraph.<br>Unsurprisingly, *that* rapprochement isn't precisely as Brian<br>describes (surprise, surprise) - and in Boulez' case, we've got a<br>record of it, which you can all take a look at for yourselves (thus<br>avoiding either Brian's biases or mine). I cannot imagine that<br>a similar split wouldn't have developed with KHS as well (although<br>Brian manages to try to convince us that the Stockhausen who wrote<br>Stimmung is the same KHS who gave us the beautiful Gesange der<br>Junglinge - another oversimplification. I'll merely commend this<br>volume to your attention, should you wish to inquire further into<br>a life of the mind without the patented Brianblinders. I quote:<br><br>The Boulez-Cage Correspondence<br>Edited by Jean-Jacques Nattiez (Cambridge University Press)<br><br>Between May 1949 and August 1954 the composers Pierre Boulez<br>and John Cage exchanged a series of remarkable letters which reflect<br>on their own music and the culture of the time. This correspondence,<br>together with other relevant documents, has been edited by Jean-Jacques<br>Nattiez and appears here for the first time completely in English. At the<br>time, Cage and Boulez were great friends and these amicable letters<br>reflect their differing ideas on the course new music should take.<br>Professor Nattiez has written a full introduction to this collection of<br>documents and the meticulous annotation of every letter makes this a<br>volume of extraordinary value for our understanding of the development<br>of both Cage and Boulez and the music of their time. 'The book's contrapuntal<br>portrayal of the widening chasm is quite fascinating. It is a necessary book;<br>an invaluable document of its time.'<br>-The Guardian<br><br>I invite the curious to form their own opinions.<br><br>With regards,<br>Gregory<br><br><br><br>_<br>I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,<br>paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only<br>maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it.
