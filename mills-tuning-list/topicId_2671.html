My<br>translation of the full text is in revision; a rough translation of a sma=<br>ll<br>part of the text was made for Larry Hansen some years ago and was publish=<br>ed<br>(a surprise to me) in an issue of Xenharmonikon (for what it is, the<br>translation is okay but the layout is lousy). =<br><br><br>Tanaka's graphing techniques develop those of Hauptmann and von Oettingen=<br>;<br>only Wilson's development of graphing techniques for additional dimension=<br>s<br>and Tenney's observations about the logarithmic distances illustrated by<br>graphs represent major music-theoretical advance s on work of the<br>nineteenth century, although it may be added that none of these technique=<br>s,<br>from a mathematical standpoint, are anything other than obvious.<br><br>I stand by my comments on Balzano's work. He gave a presentation in Santa=<br><br>Cruz in 1982 and said specifically that 20 was chosen because he was<br>working with group characteristics and 20 was a reasonably small number<br>with the same number of factors as 12. Indeed, it could be said that he w=<br>as<br>looking for an alternative tuning with which he might confirm some<br>hypotheses regarding 12. However, once he started work with 20, he became=<br><br>quite pleased with the tuning (Balzano has perfect pitch memory and rapid=<br>ly<br>had command over the set of 20).<br><br>My disparaging comments about Richter Herf and his _Ekmelische Musik_ are=<br> a<br>private aesthetic opinion. Austria's history is full of minor cultural<br>figures with minor followings. I'd rate him and his group as both smaller=<br><br>and considerably less important than Hauer and his group. Ezra Sims is a<br>rough contemporary, a clearer thinker and a far better composer, so let's=<br><br>let Ezra take the 72-tone chair. (If we want to argue on the basis of<br>priority, then Bosanquet gets all multiples of 12, followed by Carrillo).=<br><br><br>As to Partch's tuning on the harmonium: The voicing of a harmonium reed c=<br>an<br>retune individual partials; his tuning was close but not exact by any<br>means. (I am working at present with aluminum rods fixed at one end. An<br>ideal rod should yield three first partials in the ratios of 1 : 6.27 :<br>17.55; I have yet to meet such a rod, but have found that with a little<br>filing in the right places I can tune the partials close to 1 : 8 : 16  =<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
