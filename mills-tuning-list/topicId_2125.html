No CDs.  As far as I know, the recording has been completely<br>discontinued and  LaMonte Young doesn't even have extra copies for sale.<br>------------------------------------<br>>The interview [with Johnston] that I read appeared in William Duckworth's<br>>book "Talking Music, Conversations with John Cage, Philip Glass, Laurie<br>>Anderson, and >Five Generations of American Experimental Composers" (Schirmer Books, 199>5).<br><br>>..all the dissonant music of the twentieth century may well be very unhe>althy for us ... Not because it's dissonant. Not even because it's comple>x. But because it's irrationally dissonant. ... [we should] eliminate the> pollution. ... than just taking it for granted and ending up with a dama>ged world.<br><br>>My question is this. Do members of the Just Intonation community basicall>y agree or disagree, and to what degree, with Ben Johnson's opinion as >expressed in this interview?<br>><br>>I await any discussion.<br><br>The old adage "you are what you eat" seems to be pertinent here.  The<br>sounds that we surround ourselves with have strong affects on our moods,<br>and in the long-term must be considered to have "positive" or "negative"<br>influence.  Tuning cannot be considered to be the only musical attribute<br>that affects our development in this manner, and Johnston realizes this.<br>In his music he has tried many approaches (which vary in their degrees of<br>abstraction and modernism) to express an orderly sound-world.<br><br>I don't agree with Johnston's appraisal of rock music as being irrational.<br>It seems to me that rock is overly rigid and simple.  If I have any<br>complaint with rock in general, it is the machine-like rigidity of it; rock<br>jackhammers over our lives with gew moments of repose and a general<br>disregard for large-scale phrasing.  In my mind, this has a tiring and<br>confusing effect (when I pay attention--and a boring  effect when I don't).<br><br>Johnston doesn't deal with equal temperaments other than 12TET, and hasn't<br>composed in 12TET for years.  His comments shouldn't be taken to express<br>disdain for equal temperaments which approximate Just Intonation except<br>that scales are judged against the yardstick of the overtone series, and<br>the roughness created from acoustic beating in equal temperaments<br>translates into roughness in our lives.  Remember also the complexity is<br>not bad, it is "illogical complexity" that our minds do not follow.  Maybe<br>if we listened to a "healthy" music made up of logical tunings, timbres,<br>rhythms, etc., we would be a little more relaxed.  Then we can move onto<br>painting the walls earthtones...<br><br>Yours,<br>Adam<br><br>_________________<br>Adam B.

This piece and _Even Wild Horses_ are the most<br>diamond oriented of his scores. In fact the score copy of DB with which Iam familar includes an added notation of a harmonic analysis in terms of<br>the diamond (16/9O, 11/8U etc.). However, the score includes frequent<br>dissonances in the form of passing tones or suspensions, and the<br>introduction features microtonal passagework on the chromelodeon<br>deliberately designed to get particular rates of beating. Partch's<br>conception of dissonance was early on a broad one, and included everything<br>from clusters and beating to more traditional uses of non-harmonic pitches.<br>Interestingly, on the last point, Partch appeared to have a contextual<br>conception of what constituted ''non-harmonic'' or ''inharmonic''. For<br>example, the 15 identity might be used on a slide guitar uniformly but<br>Partch considered it ''inharmonic'' because it was not available throughout<br>his ensemble, and although most listeners would probably find it more<br>consonant than the 11 identity.
