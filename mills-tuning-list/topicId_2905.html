I've played<br>most of the over  the years and find many useful for building<br>novel scales.<br><br>I have some qualms about calling the genus 1 1 6 (C C# Db F,<br>0 1 2 8) enharmonic as it appears to me to be a blend of the<br>hemiolic chromatic and true enharmonic because of the deviations<br>of 19-tet's intervals from JI and the 0 mod 12 temperaments in which<br>Aristoxenos's tetrachords are conveniently expressed. I do not<br>think that just the mere presence of intervals of 1 degree of<br>19 justifies calling such tetrachords enharmonic. Nineteen-tet<br>has a fair approximation to the  Chromatic and Diatonic genera of<br>Archytas (and the corresponding genera  of Ptolemy), but both have<br>an interval of 1 degree.<br><br>I have presented much of the argument for this before, but I<br>repeat it at the end of this post in new guise for those who might<br>have missed it or want to read more about the topic.<br><br>As for Pythagorean tuning, I doubt singers were often required to<br>jump to tones 4 or 5 fifths removed from their current notes except<br>in the old enharmonic with its ditonal leaps or the archaic<br>harmoniai of Aristides Quintilianus. However, the voice was usually<br>supported by either the aulos or a plucked string instrument such<br>as the lyra or kithara. Melodies tended to be conjunct and quite narrow<br>in range, so I don't imagine the vocal demands were excessive. In<br>the absence of harmony, some intonational lattitude may have been<br>acccepted, though we know little of performance practice in Greek<br>music or the much earlier Sumero-Babylonian music which was similarly<br>tuned. The same is probably true for early medieval music in Europe.<br><br>--John<br><br>Enharmonic in 19-tet:<br><br>Whether the enharmonic is expressed in 19-tet depends somewhat<br>on one's definition of the enharmonic genus. Historically, it<br>began as a pentatonic scale in Pythagorean tuning and the important<br>intervals were not microtones, but the incomposite ditones<br>(408 cents, 81/64). Toward the end of the 5th century BCE, the<br>limmas at the bottom of each trichord were split to form two rather<br>small "quarter tones" and in the process enlarge the scale to seven<br>tones. In the 4th century, a process of "sweetening" took place<br>in which the ditone was shrunk (or softened) first to a 5/4 (Archytas,<br>390 BCE), then to various more or less neutral thirds, to end up<br>as a minor third, probably a 32/27 according to Aristoxenos (~330).<br>Aristoxenos was the son of a famous musician and probably knew what<br>he was talking about in terms of the general effect of the tunings then<br>in use.<br><br>The size of the pyknon, or dense region of two dieses at the bottom<br>of the tetrachord served to charactarize the genus or type of tetrachord.<br>In his system, thus, the enharmonic consisted of two 1/4 tones and<br>a ditone, the soft chromatic of two 1/3 tones and flat major third of<br>367 cents, the hemiolic chromatic of two 3/8 tones and neutral third<br>(350 cents), and finally the intense chromatic of two semitones and<br>a minor third (or trihemitone). Aristoxenos grudgingly admits that<br>there is an enharmonic genus with an "irrational" large lowest interval<br>and a chromatic with the pyknon divided in the proportion of 1:2<br>(Winnington-Ingram. It is clear that these are not the preferred<br>tunings in his day.<br><br>Now, the "enharmonic" in 19-tet is a hybrid between the true<br>enharmonic and the soft chromatic. Because of the sharp fourth<br>and the flattish major third of 19, the tetrachord 1 1 6 has the<br>1/3 tones of the hemiolic  chromatic, but a major third that is<br>intermediate between the incomposite 367 cent interval of the hemiolic<br>chromatic and the ditone of the enharmonic, though it is closer<br>to the former. This tuning somewhat resembles Archytas's enharmonic,<br>except that the middle interval is too large and the upper one too<br>small. Furthermore, the 1/3 tone of Archytas's genera was chosen to<br>make a 7/6 with the subtonic (Erickson, W-I, etc.), but the<br>corresponding interval of 4 degrees  in 19 is not as consonant.<br>Thus the 19-tet genus 1 1 6 is neither enharmonic or chromatic in sensu<br>stricto.<br><br>Melodically, however, it sounds quite enharmonic because of the major<br>third, though it lacks the clarity of Aristoxenos's Pythagorean<br>or pseudo-tempered tuning and the consonance of Archytas's ratios.<br><br>The best Greek chromatic tuning in 19-tet is the 1:2 genus,<br>which closely resembles Archytas's tuning, though he used the<br>32/27 instead of the 6/5 as the uppermost interval. The tetrachord<br>0 1 3 8 (1 2 5) also approximates Ptolemy's Intense chromatic. The more<br>Aristoxenian tuning with an evenly divided pyknon, 2 2 4, does not<br>closely resemble any ancient Greek tuning, though Byzantine and Islamic<br>writers give similar tetrachords in JI.<br><br>There is also the diatonic genus with the hemiolic chromatic diesis<br>of  Aristoxenos. In 19-tet it would be 1 4 3 degrees or 0 1 5 8. This<br>tetrachord approximates Archytas's diatonic.<br><br>Aristoxenos's soft diatonic genus, 0 100 250 500 cents is not<br>expressible in 19-tet, as 1 3 4 is not a good approximation.<br><br>Anyway, I do not think 19-tet is a very good temperament for playing<br>ancient Greek scales or music written in them unless the corpus is<br>restricted to just a few tetachords or specific 19-tet tetrachordal<br>music is composed. I would think the same would be true for any<br>music in which the fourth and fifth and their compounds are the<br>most prominent intervals and the same is true for other negative systems.<br>For such musics, 17 or some multiple of 12 would be my choice if<br>straight JI were not considered. <br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com><br>Subject:  Danielou's theories<br>PostedDate:  24-12-97 23:24:59<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  24-12-97 23:22:51-24-12-97 23:22:51,24-12-97 23:22:21-24-12-97 23:22:22<br>DeliveredDate:  24-12-97 23:22:22<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256577.007AECC2; Wed, 24 Dec 1997 23:24:36 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA25309; Wed, 24 Dec 1997 23:24:59 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 24 Dec 1997 23:24:59 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA25295<br>Received: (qmail 2840 invoked from network); 24 Dec 1997 14:24:42 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 24 Dec 1997 14:24:42 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.96.971224142308.3291E-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
