Note<br>that in my examples I used ratio notation. <br><br>> I'm certainly not suggesting by any means that that <br>> is the only valid or useful mindset from which to write <br>> music.  But it's far from useless just<br>> because it doesn't comprehend the idea of a comma.<br><br>It's useless for describing music which doesn't stick to 7 <br>pitches. I'm also trying to argue that much of what is called <br>diatonic music actually makes use of progressions which imply<br>more than 7 pitches, and if played on instruments which are<br>pitch-adjustable, including voice, the progressions can<br>naturally lead the ear of the performer to play these pitches.<br>In these cases, diatonic notation and thinking is worse than<br>useless; (IMO) it's harmful, because it gives a truncated<br>explanation of musical reality.<br><br>> The ideas of traditional harmony has value applied to certain <br>> microtonal systems - as much or as little value as it has in <br>> 12TET.  Traditional theory is based upon triadic harmony, but <br>> its most basic emphasis is functional harmony:<br>> * Leading tones want to go up,<br>> * Sevenths want to go down,<br>> * Dominant seventh chords want to resolve to tonic chords, etc.<br><br>I can agree heartily with a melodic-tendancy basis for <br>functional harmony, but there is still the sense of<br>tonality which is like the reference map that functional<br>harmony plays over. When you move into "romantic" <br>chromaticism as an extension of diatonic thought<br>with added deceptive resolutions, secondary dominants, <br>"distant" modulations, etc. it becomes even more important<br>to consider the real harmonic areas which these voice <br>leading tendancies are leading you into. I suggest that<br>12-tone chromatic tonal music implies more than 12 pitches<br>and that a chromatic analysis is just as incorrect and<br>harmful (by not telling the whole truth) as a diatonic <br>analysis is for much of supposedly diatonic music.<br><br>> Functional harmony is also the basis behind wandering tonics:  <br>> If you can convince an audience that some pitch is the leading <br>> tone, and you resolve it upward by half-step, then they'll <br>> believe that the pitch you land on is the tonic, even if it's <br>> not the tonic you started on.  Taken out of the framework of <br>> functional harmony, and of tonality, the idea of wandering <br>> tonics is no longer meaningful.<br><br>Let me recount one of my formative microtonal experiences: the<br>first 81/80 I heard. In the mid 70's, then-schoolmate Kraig Grady <br>introduced me to Erv Wilson and Erv played for me the following <br>sequence, 1/1 5/4 5/3 10/9 40/27 160/81, then he paused, and<br>followed it with 2/1. Believe me, when my ear heard the real<br>tonic it could tell THAT was home, no matter that my <br>diatonic-solfege-trained brain had analyzed "do mi la re so do". <br>The fact that the final melodic 81/80 movement was so small <br>and yet so clearly correct convinced me by-experience of the <br>reality of microtonal hearing.<br><br>What I'm trying to say is that even though you may write <br>music which you think leads your audience to a "wandered <br>tonic", if you follow it with the real tonic, they will <br>recognize it. This makes me think it better to call the <br>supposed "wandered tonic" by another name, to reflect the <br>ear's ability to differentiate, rather than reflecting <br>the false assumption at the base of a diatonic analysis. <br><br>> So it's certainly not unreasonable to think that the tonic <br>> could wander down to the original pitch of the leading tone, <br>> for example.  But if it does, it's still functionally the <br>> tonic, because that's how our ears will perceive it.<br><br>Maybe that example should be called a modulation rather<br>than a wandered tonic, or maybe it's all a matter of who's <br>listening. All I can really go by is my own ear.<br><br>Matt Nathan<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 24 Feb 1997 19:35 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18000; Mon, 24 Feb 1997 19:35:02 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18004<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id KAA14568; Mon, 24 Feb 1997 10:33:05 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 24 Feb 1997 10:33:05 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v02130500af378dc2c8aa@[192.168.11.203]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
