What happens when you cook up a dish with spices from around<br>the world, but tie it all together in an integrated synthesis of a<br>meal?  What happens when you extract musical essences from diverse<br>earthly cultures and then colonize a new world?<br><br>Acoustic Stick.<br><br>Don't get me wrong.  This isn't a "world music" album, with its<br>monotonous, throbbing beat and obligatory digeridoo.  Neil and company<br>obviously *understand* the musics that influence them, and what you<br>get is that understanding transformed through the hearts, minds and<br>hands of some great musicians, with some unique elements you won't<br>hear anywhere else.<br><br>When you first throw on the disc, your initial reaction may be [it<br>does say 19 and 34 tone guitars, after all] "What's so un...Oooh!<br>Wow!"  There's almost a steel-drum quality to the afro-cuban jazzy<br>first cut, and it's really catchy, with hints and glimpses of those<br>exotic plants in the garden.  And there's some really smoking, more<br>"straight" jazz, and some blues with a great twist, and even something<br>that will please the Julian Bream fans out there.<br><br>Of course it doesn't stop there.  As the tour continues, the landscape<br>changes, with Neil eventually leading you through the back gate to<br>explore the native flora of his wonderful world.  Play this album for<br>a group of friends, and I'd be suprised if there weren't at least one<br>person in the room playing air guitar along with Neil by the second<br>bar of Birdwalk!  I can't quite think of how to describe the other<br>pieces.  They evoke impressions of Pharoah Sanders meets Shankar in a<br>middle eastern cafe, but that doesn't begin to describe it.  You'll<br>just have to listen for yourself.<br><br>Of course, this being a tuning list, I have to have the obligatory<br>tuning related content. :-) Well, as far as the tunings themselves,<br>they are as integral to the music as the timbres of the instruments<br>themselves. There are no academic experiments here, and the effect<br>is one of a melding of two worlds, more than the colonization of<br>one by the other.<br><br>If you want to, you might be able to nail your feet to the floor to<br>keep them from tapping, tie your hands to the chair to stave off any<br>form of rhythmic air-instrumentation, don your best Mr. Spock<br>immitation and sit and count the number of notes -- if you _really_<br>want to.  Good luck trying.  The music is just too good, and I can't<br>imagine anyone not finding something that captures their mind and<br>moves their soul on this album.<br><br>If you like music, you need this album.  If you, or anyone you know,<br>is a guitar fanatic, you and they need this album.  Actually, I think<br>everyone needs this album.  If there's any fault at all to be found<br>with this album, it's that it's too short.  I played it for a bunch of<br>folks last night, and after it ended, the universal response was "Is<br>that all?  There's got to be more. Play it again."  I, for one,<br>anxiously await the "more".<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Steven Rezsutek <rezsutek@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov><br>Subject:  Re: 19, 22, 29, 41, 53 : 12 and multiples<br>PostedDate:  23-12-97 18:11:50<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  23-12-97 18:09:35-23-12-97 18:09:36,23-12-97 18:09:06-23-12-97 18:09:07<br>DeliveredDate:  23-12-97 18:09:07<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256576.005E41B1; Tue, 23 Dec 1997 18:11:28 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA24543; Tue, 23 Dec 1997 18:11:50 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 23 Dec 1997 18:11:50 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA21933<br>Received: (qmail 18930 invoked from network); 23 Dec 1997 09:11:44 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 23 Dec 1997 09:11:44 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199712231710.MAA21461@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
