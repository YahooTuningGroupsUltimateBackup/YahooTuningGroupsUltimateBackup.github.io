Steel-string acoustic, both kinda cheezy built from kits as<br>      part of a science fair project in my second year of high school.  Gosh,<br>      that must have been about 22 years ago.  This was my introduction to the<br>      field of unusual tunings.  At the time I didn't know that anybody else<br>      was doing much of anything beyond quartertones.  The bassist who played<br>      on my music examples then encountered Ivor Darreg's landmark Guitar<br>      Player magazine article, which contained his address, and thus began the<br>      big, 18-year string of letters!  Ivor introduced me to John Chalmers, who<br>      at the time was living in the same city (Houston).  The science angle of<br>      course was the physics of vibrating strings, as applied to this unusual<br>      application.   I also have a 10TET fingerboard for my interchangeable-<br>      fingerboard guitar.<br>   Flutes.  Undertaken also as a science-fair project, the following year.  The<br>      science angle was - analogously - a study of flute acoustics based upon<br>      Boehm's book on the topic along with some research of my own.  That<br>      project went all the way to the international level, which was held in<br>      the Anaheim stadium at which time I met Ivor Darreg, Erv Wilson, and Glen<br>      Prior for the first time.<br><br>14TET:<br>   Fingerboard for my interchangeable-fingerboard guitar (Takamine C132S).<br><br>19TET:<br>   Refretted guitar (I did the refretting), and a 19TET fingerboard for my<br>      interchangeable-fingerboard guitar.

This is what I use the<br>      most now.<br>   A variable-width pulse-wave, digital synthesizer based on a couple hundred<br>      or so TTL ICs (my design) and run by a single-board 6502-based micro-<br>      computer (Synertek SYM-1) running software of my design.  This would play<br>      most any tuning of up to 32 tones per octave, and was played from a con-<br>      troller that could probably best be characterized as kind of like an<br>      electronic version of a Chapman "stick" (although at the time I didn't<br>      know of the stick).  As you might have guessed, this was undertaken as<br>      another science-fair project.
