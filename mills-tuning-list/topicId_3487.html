All of the<br>brass waveforms I've looked at have been exceptionally periodic.<br><br>   And as Paul pointed out, by all accounts I'm aware of, the<br>aharmonicities in brasses, bowed strings, most woodwinds are at a minimum<br>extremely slight.  (That even includes the observations I mentioned early<br>on in this conversation that a more comprehensive review proved to be much<br>more rare than I realized.)<br><br>   Please understand that I don't have any specific experimental results to<br>substantiate the following conjectures:  It would not surprise me if the<br>rare cases of apparently systematic fluctuations in overtone structure I've<br>noticed could in fact actually be periodic amplitude fluctuations of<br>various harmonics attributable to unrelated vibratory systems.  Examples of<br>such an unrelated vibratory system might perhaps include mechanisms like:<br>1.  Slight, low-frequency vibrations in the looser parts of a wind-instrument<br>    embouchure (like perhaps cheeks, or possibly even vocal chords very slightly<br>    "flapping in the breeze" so to speak).<br>2.  Parasitic vibrational modes in strings, like longitudinal or tortional<br>    vibrations.<br>3.  Parasitic vibrations in other fragments of string in a stringed instrument,<br>    like the short string fragments between the bridge and tailpiece.<br>4.  Possibly (although these would have to be very quiet to say the least!)<br>    parasitic resonances in other parts of an instrument like the material of<br>    the walls of a wind instrument vibrating.<br>5.  Possibly bow hairs vibrating slightly (although that seems unlikely since<br>    they don't have much mass).  It is, however, very easy to see that the bow<br>    itself can bounce subtly, or sometimes even not-too-subtly.  That, however,<br>    generates mostly a volume wobble that seems to affect all harmonics about<br>    equally.</div>
