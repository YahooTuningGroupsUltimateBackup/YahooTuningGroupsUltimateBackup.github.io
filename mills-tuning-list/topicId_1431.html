I'm not suggesting Phrygian scales, of course, only that<br>Armenian culture has a sure footing in the Greek music frame.  Turkish<br>does apppear to be the resultant of 24 cycles of fifth (which I believe is<br>expressed by d'Erlanger).  However, Iranian is based on tetrachords and<br>has a distinct tuning modas operandi.  The Iranian dastgah seems more in<br>line structurally with Bulgarian music: it has an immutable 4th with 2<br>mutable inner notes.<br><br>An interesting aside, Turks read from sheet music, while Iranians use the<br>equivalent of a "fake book" called the Radif (which I have recently heard<br>is instrument specific).<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@ios.com<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 26 Dec 1996 07:17 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02621; Thu, 26 Dec 1996 07:20:14 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03110<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id WAA14914; Wed, 25 Dec 1996 22:20:11 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 25 Dec 1996 22:20:11 -0800<br>Message-Id: <851580325@csst.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
