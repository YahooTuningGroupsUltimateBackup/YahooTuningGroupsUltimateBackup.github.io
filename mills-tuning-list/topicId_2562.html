It is true<br>that being "in tune" is a mathematical phenomenon of frequencies matching<br>up perfectly...I agree that when we say eq temps approximate a pure<br>ratio, it doesn't correlate in a way because as soon as you are off of<br>the ratio, the new note is NOT the ratio, so it IS something else. Just<br>exactly what it means to have music that vibrates impurely is probably a<br>pretty poorly studied area, but I know that some folks think it can cause<br>great harm in various ways. I use eq tunings because I love chord<br>changes...I am under no illusions about what I do, and why. I also know<br>that music possesses a "magic," a quality that transcends logic and<br>intellect. Whether or not impure tunings twist or distort this magic, or<br>whether it works regardless of tuning systems, is an area that I'd like<br>to see more discussion on. Sound is a foundation of the fabric of the<br>Universe, and has a powerful effect... I feel there's a lot of mysterious<br>things about music, and tuning and frequencies are a very important part<br>of those mysteries. The effect that music has on people (and the overall<br>environment), separate from the issue of tunings, is also a quite valid<br>area for study...but, since it is not quite as "scientific" as<br>frequencies, it's a bit harder to get a handle on in any definitive<br>way...Hstick<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  TONY SALINAS <salinas@lgu.ac.uk><br>Subject:  Microtonal seminars<br>PostedDate:  23-10-97 16:21:06<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  23-10-97 16:20:21-23-10-97 16:20:22,23-10-97 15:21:01-23-10-97 15:21:01<br>DeliveredDate:  23-10-97 15:21:01<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256539.004EC05B; Thu, 23 Oct 1997 16:20:10 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA25264; Thu, 23 Oct 1997 16:21:06 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 23 Oct 1997 16:21:06 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA25262<br>Received: (qmail 10228 invoked from network); 23 Oct 1997 07:20:58 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 23 Oct 1997 07:20:58 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.971023151315.9177A-100000@kali><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6337 href="#6337">ðŸ”—</a>jpff@maths.bath.ac.uk</h3><span>10/24/1997 4:23:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Message written at 24 Oct 1997 09:33:23 +0100<br>In-reply-to: <Pine.SOL.3.91.971023151315.9177A-100000@kali> (TONY SALINAS)<br>References:  <Pine.SOL.3.91.971023151315.9177A-100000@kali><br><br>I may be in the same country as London, but I do not get there....<br>Tony, is there any chance of a short report after each of these events<br>for information -- say 1/2 page?<br>==John<br><br>> Microtonality Seminars in London<br>><br>> Dear Microtonalists,<br>><br>> The Music Technology Research Group of the London Guildhall University is<br>> pleased to announce the following seminars:<br>....<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  William Sethares <sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Subject:  more consonance and dissonance<br>PostedDate:  24-10-97 17:06:16<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  24-10-97 17:05:33-24-10-97 17:05:35,24-10-97 16:06:13-24-10-97 16:06:13<br>DeliveredDate:  24-10-97 16:06:13<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125653A.0052E72F; Fri, 24 Oct 1997 17:05:31 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA25498; Fri, 24 Oct 1997 17:06:16 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 24 Oct 1997 17:06:16 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA26472<br>Received: (qmail 18601 invoked from network); 24 Oct 1997 08:06:08 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 24 Oct 1997 08:06:08 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199710241503.AA16673@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
