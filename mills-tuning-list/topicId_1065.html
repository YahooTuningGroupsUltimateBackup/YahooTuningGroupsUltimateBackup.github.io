People on both the Gamelan and Tuning list have asked<br>various questions about this aspect of Erv's work. I can't as yet<br>say too much, but I'll try to fill in some background.<br><br>Erv sent me a letter last summer about the Padovan sequence and<br>indonesian tunings, but alas I filed it somewhere that I can't locate.<br>I assumed it was a preliminary personal communication and figured<br>that more info would be forthcoming. I'm sorry to admit that I didn't<br>take the time to digest it then and really can't tell you much about it.<br>Erv is in Mexico breeding plants until Nov 7, when he will be presenting <br>at Dr. Mommy's MicroFest in El Paso. I expect him back in LA about <br>the 11th of November and I will ask him for another copy of his letter <br>and permission to post it to the Gamelan and Tuning Lists.<br><br>Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of integers arranged<br>so that each entry is the sum of the two above (and to either side).<br>Historically, it appears to be of Chinese origin. By summing along <br>different diagonals, various numerical constants such as the <br>Golden Section (I.618034...) may be found. It is not surprising <br>that the Padovan series constant 1.324718..(aka Plastic Number) would <br>be among them. (The GS and the PN are the limits of the quotients of <br>successive terms of their respective series.)<br><br>While it's difficult to construct PT in ascii, I'll try.<br><br>				1<br><br>			1		1<br><br>		1		2		1<br><br>	1		3		3		1<br><br>1		4		6		4		1	<br><br>Each succeeding row starts and ends with 1 and consists of the sums<br>of each pair of adjacent  numbers in in the row above. Each row<br>also consists of the Binomial coefficients and the Combinations of<br>N (the row index) items taken M at a time ( 0 <= M <=N). <br><br>The Golden Ratio is also derivable by annexing squares whose sides<br>are Fibonacci numbers. Quarter circles erected on the diagonals of<br>these squares approximate a logarthmic spiral. The ratios of the <br>sides of successive squares approaches the GS and F(n+1)= F(n) <br>+ F(n-1)  The F sequence is 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 .... <br><br>An analogous construction of equilateral triangles also traces out<br>a logarithmic spiral and the sides of the triangles form the Padovan<br>Sequence, 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 7 9 16 21 ... P(n+1)= P(n-1)+P(n-2).<br><br>For more information, see Ian Stewart, Mathematical Recreations, Tales<br>of a Neglected Number, Scientific American June 1966 pp102-103.<br><br>The Golden Section or Ratio is approximately 1.6180339 or 833 cents.<br>The Padovan or Plastic Number is about 1.324718 or 487 cents. I <br>don't recall right now if Erv used cycles of this rather flat fourth<br>to generate scale or derived the intervals of slendro and pelog like<br>scales from Pascal's triangle or Padovan spiral. Erv's communications, <br>alas, are sometimes cryptically concise.<br><br><br><br><br>--John	<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 28 Oct 1996 19:26 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA20403; Mon, 28 Oct 1996 19:26:16 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA20393<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id KAA23293; Mon, 28 Oct 1996 10:26:14 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 28 Oct 1996 10:26:14 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3235762173.298371@ycrdi.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
