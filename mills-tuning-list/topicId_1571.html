''Musical fiction'' is an extremely<br>curious phrase to use. ''Music-theoretic fiction'' is more plausible, but I<br>have no idea what terms of reference are construed as fiction and fact by<br>this statement. The fact remains that /4:/5:/6 is a description of a set of<br>frequency relationships that is extremely useful, while the equivalent<br>harmonic description (in lowest terms: 10:12:15) is misleading when applied<br>to any real musical contexts of which I am aware.<br><br>Do you really hear a just minor triad as being built a Major third above an<br>absent fundamental?  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 20 Jan 1997 18:14 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07761; Sat, 18 Jan 1997 02:21:12 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07754<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id RAA23570; Fri, 17 Jan 1997 17:21:10 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 17 Jan 1997 17:21:10 -0800<br>Message-Id: <54970117214645/0005695065PK4EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4639 href="#4639">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;106232.3266@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/1997 12:09:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>You wrote:<br><br>'' Even Daniel and Little Wolf <br>preferred 10 12 15 17 to /12 /10 /8 /7, despite the smaller numbers in the <br>latter.*** Only in changing the comparison to 17 20 24 30 vs. /7 /6 /5 /4 <br>does the subharmonic version win out.
