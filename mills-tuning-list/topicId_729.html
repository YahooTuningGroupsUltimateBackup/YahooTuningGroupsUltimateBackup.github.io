What is the<br>>experimental control?  What kind of statistical<br>>methods does the  experimental composer use <br>>to analyze hi/r results--linear regression, chi<br>>square, least squares, ANOVA?  What and<br>>where is the mathematical model upon which the <br>>experimental composer's hypothesis is based?<br>>Which laws of nature does the experimental<br>>composer seek to investigate...?  ...Or is, perhaps,<br>>the term "experimental" used merely to indicate<br>>a certain glamorous intention to be "scientific,"<br>>in the same way that advertisements for <br>>astrological services include the phrase <br>>"scientifically calculated using the latest<br>>astrological computer program"...?<br><br>One composer who described his work as "experimental" and who may have been<br>one of the first to think of his music as such is Lejaren Hiller, author of<br>the "Illiac Suite" and later "HPSCD", a collaboration with John Cage that<br>featured many different superimposed N tones per octave tunings.  To this<br>day the studios at the University of Illnois Champaign-Urbana are referred<br>to as the "Experimental Music Studios".  Hiller's background was in<br>Chemistry, and for a time he had a joint appointment there in Chemistry and<br>Music.  For Hiller his experiment was if he could compose a piece of music<br>using the computer.  Aesthetic issues about whether the music was<br>appreciated by the audience were sometimes considered to be outside the<br>bounds of the experiment.<br><br>regards,<br><br>Steve Curtin<br>Ensoniq Corp<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 12 Aug 1996 17:08 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11031; Mon, 12 Aug 1996 17:08:58 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11038<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA23723; Mon, 12 Aug 1996 08:08:56 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 12 Aug 1996 08:08:56 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960812075504.20713A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3424 href="#3424">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/1996 7:30:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: Hucksters, shysters and<br> other suspicious doyens of intonational <br> "research"<br>--<br>Many and mutually contradictory are the<br>results of psychoacoustic research on <br>tuning  in the early years of this century.  <br>And still, occasionally, in the badly<br>thought-out articles which appear now<br>and then.<br>As one who believes along with H. L. <br>Mencken that "Man, at his best, remains<br>a sort of one-lunged animal, never completely<br>rounded and perfect, as a cockroach, say,<br>is perfect," this is perhaps only to be<br>expected.  Nevertheless it behooves me<br>to point out some of the more glaring<br>errors perpetuated in the name of<br>early 20th-century intonational "research."<br>(These errors are filched straight from<br>"How to Lie with Statistics," by Darrell<br>Huff, W. W. Norton and Co., 1954. This<br>book  ought to be taught in every college <br>curriculum.)<br>The first classic error of the intonational<br>"researcher" is the biased sample.<br>Consider, for example, a paper which stands<br>out for sheer wackiness as perhaps the worst<br>piece of microtonal "research" ever done:<br>namely, "Scale, Key and contour in the<br>discrimination of tuned and mistuned<br>approximations to melody" by Anthony J.<br>Watkins, Perception & Psychophysics,<br>1985, Vol. 37, No. 4, pp. 275-285.<br>Watkins makes sure to build in a huge<br>bias into his test sample of listeners,<br>because he defines "mistuned" melodies<br>as the closest approximation to a 12-TET<br>melody in another equal temperament.<br>The problem with this sort of microtonal<br>"research" should be obvious: if you inform<br>your test subjects that, say, red is a distorted<br>version of blue, and then show your test <br>subjects a lot of paintings with red in 'em,<br>you will obtain the predictable result that<br>"the subjects reported that all paintings <br>which were not monochromatically blue<br>were perceived as significantly distorted."<br>This kind of "research" is just a nudge away<br>from the infamous political "push polls," in<br>which quondam "phone researchers" call up<br>voters for the opposition and ask: "Would you<br>change your vote if you learned that your<br>candidate is a child molester?"<br>(It's worth mentioning that Richard Nixon<br>is the father of this infamy, in the 1947 <br>Jerry Vorhees senate race.)<br>In the microtonal realm, a more subtle form<br>of biased sample is found when researchers<br>choose 1st year music students as test subjects <br>for intonational listening studies.  SInce most of<br>these music students are constantly being<br>run through an exhaustive regimen of 12-TET<br>listening tests, the sample is a priori tainted,<br> and might even be unusable.  John Chalmers has<br>pointed this out--the problem is much less<br>severe with upper division music students,<br>since they've been exposed to real music in<br>so many intonational real-life situations that<br>their ears are bound to be more flexible. They<br>also have presumably passed the early ear-<br>training tests and thus are not constantly<br>being bombarded by 12-TET brainwashing.)<br>[2] The well-chosen average is a second <br>source of error in intonational research.<br>Mean and median "averages" are often quite<br>different, particularly with small sample<br>sizes and large variances.  Most insidious of all<br>is the quoted "average" deviation from some<br>hypothetical "target tuning" as measured by<br>the preferences of a group of listeners. If<br>the averages are given as unsigned scalars,<br>the study is often worthless.  Don Hall et al.<br>made this error in their 1985 article "The<br>Perception of Musical Intervals."  Hall and co.<br>also chose their deviations from values which<br>slyly sit atop just ratios, so that the implication <br>was that the listeners judged deviations based on <br>an innate desire for small integer ratios.<br>Franz Loosen's articles corrected this error<br>by showing that the direction of the error<br>bars of perceived deviations changed systematically<br>depending on which instrument the listener<br>used.  Loosen's studies tell us: [1] different listeners <br>perceive deviations from different types<br>of intervals--pianists from ET intervals,<br>violists from Pythagorean intervals; and [2]<br>that pianists and violinists tolerate different<br>error ranges skewed toward different triadic<br>pitch heights, showing that they are measuring<br>"deviation" primarily in terms of the triads<br>they've become used to hearing.<br>[3] "The little figures that are not there"<br>bedevil small group studies of intonational<br>perception.  If you've got 4 or 6 listeners,<br>it's no more meaningful to report that "75%<br>of listeners perceived the stretched intervals<br>as..." than it is to report that "75% of dentists<br>surveyed prefer Crest."  (What this really means<br>is that the fourth dentist disagreed.)<br>Carol Krumhansl's studies use very small <br>sample sizes--yet her results purport to<br>be statistcally significant.  A much earlier<br>researcher, Carl Seashore, used truly mammoth<br>sample sizes, and his results hold up. Heinz Werner's<br>studies are also a excellent model in this regard;<br>his results were primarily *qualitative*,<br>and Werner's main interest was in eliciting<br>descriptions of perceived intervals.  This<br>is a valid procedure even with very small<br>sample sizes.  But Krumhansl's statistical<br>approach seems highly suspect when only<br>a dozen or twenty-some listeners are involved,<br>yet the results are generalized to sweeping<br>grandiosities involving "Western tonal<br>hierarchical perception," etc.<br>[4] "Much ado about practically nothing"<br>is the problem of making a big deal out<br>of small differences which probably<br>don't exist.  This can be seen in Partch's<br>insistence and more recently Ezra Sims's<br>insistence that inaccuracies in the realm of<br>2 cents, 1 cent, 1.8 cents, etc., are lethal<br>to the peformance and audition of just<br>intonation music.  This error also crops<br>up in intonational research. Comparing standard<br>deviations of interval preference, for<br>example, may not be valid unless the<br>sample size is very large and/or the<br>results have been replicated by many<br>different reserachers over many <br>different years.<br>Another way of saying this is: (number<br>of intonational studies) * (difference<br>in standard deviations) is the quantity<br>that ought to be compared.<br>This works in reverse.  Many intonational<br>advocates have tried to claim that small<br>differences in standard deviation of<br>interval perception are merely a statistical<br>error caused by sampling noise--yet they<br>ignore the fact that these small differences<br>are (A) small when compared with the octave,<br>but not when compared with the intervals<br>being perceived, and (B) the results have<br>been replicated by so many hundreds of<br>researchers over more than 150 years of<br>quantitative tests that it's clear a real<br>effect is involved, not mere statistical<br>noise.  <br>[5] The last error and one of the most<br>insidious in intonational research is<br>the classic "post hoc" fallacy.<br>This fallacy is aptly summed up by<br>the case in which there are two clocks<br>in the town square.  When clock #1<br>points to 5 o'clock, clock #2 rings<br>its bell.  Therefore clock #1 caused<br>clock #2 to ring.<br>Right?<br>This kind of error can be seen in study<br>after study of ethnic scales in non-<br>western cultures.  Most of these <br>studies find predominantly 7 or<br>5 tones.  No suggestion is ever made<br>that because of Miller's limit to the<br>channel capacity of the human sensorium<br>and short-term memory (see Miller, G. A.,<br>"The Magic Number 7 Plus or Minus Two,"<br>Journ. Psych. 1956), 7 notes represents<br>a practical near-upper limit to the number<br>of tones which can be distinguished in<br>a fluid musical context.<br>Instead of arriving at *that* conclusion,<br>intonational researchers in the early<br>part of the century reasoned: since the piano <br>has 7 white keys and 5 black keys, clearly<br>this indicates that the tuning <br>preferences throughout all the world's<br>cultures are caused by an unconscious<br>desire for the western 7-note white<br>piano keys. <br>Right?<br>Alternatively, this fallacious argument<br>is used by just intonation fans (most<br>notably, Lou Harrison--a very fine <br>composer but a less than entirely rigorous <br>scholar) to argue that since errors are<br>distributed approximately evenly around<br>this or that set of just ratios for all<br>of the 7-tone and 5-tone scales used by<br>other cultures, clearly this indicates<br>that the tuning  preferences throughout <br>all the world's cultures are caused by an <br>unconscious desire for small whole<br>number ratios.<br>Right?<br>And thunder causes the lightning,<br>right? <br>And smoke causes the fire...right?<br>Researchers like Frederic Voisin, who<br>use retunable synthesizers to measure<br>the *process* of tuning by native<br>experts in other musical cultures,<br>are now beginning to torpedo these<br>specious "post hoc, propter hoc" notions<br>of the origins of ethnic tunings. <br>Shockingly, researchers like Voisin<br>are discovering that there's very little<br>preference for even such purportedly<br>"universal" and "basic" units of <br>intonational measure as the 2:1<br>octave, the 3:2 fifth, etc. See<br>Voisin, F.

Many<br>cultures think musically in terms of adding constant<br>Herz intervals, irregardless of whether the sum<br>comes out to a 2:1 or not. In fact the Banda Linda,<br>Banda Ndopka, Ngaka-Manza and Banda Gbambiya<br>peoples of Central Africa prefer an "octave" of<br>1150 cents. Lou Harrison has not explained how<br>to reconcile these facts with the notion that just<br>intonation forms the basis of world music.<br>In the 1920s H. L. Mencken lamented:<br>"Today the old pegagogy has gone out,<br>and a new and complicated science has<br>taken its place.  Unluckily, it is largely <br>the confection of imbeciles,<br>and so the unhappiness of the young<br>continues.  In the whole realm of human<br>learning there is no faculty more <br>fantastically incompetent than that of<br>pedagogy.  If you doubt it, go read the <br>pedagogical journals. Better still, send<br>for an armful of the theses that <br>Kandidaten write and publish when they <br>go up for their Ph.D's. Nothing worse is<br>to be found in the literature of astrology,<br>snake oil salesmanship, or Christian<br>Science." [Mencken, H. L., "The Vintage<br>Mencken Gathered by Alistair Cooke,"<br>Vintage Press: New York, 1956, pg. 184]<br>This is nowhere more true than in early<br>intonational "research."
