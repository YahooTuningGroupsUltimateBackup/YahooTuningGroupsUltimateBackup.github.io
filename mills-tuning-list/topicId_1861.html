In careful tests they have been unable to predict<br>the lives of people about whom they know only the time and place of birth. <br><br><br>   And besides how could it possibly work?  How could the rising of Mars at<br>the time of my birth affect me, then or now?  I was born in a closed room. <br>Light from Mars couldn't affect me.  The only influence of Mars that could<br>have had any effect upon me was its gravity.  But the gravitational<br>attraction of the obstetrician was much greater than the gravitation of<br>Mars.  Mars is more massive, but he obstetrician was a lot closer."<br><br><br>   Do I personally agree with that philosophy?  I'll take a more or less<br>functional approach to that question:  If you can point me to some benefit<br>from Astrology, then I'll give it a whirl, but I have yet to find any<br>benefits from Astrology.  It hasn't helped my music, career, or<br>interpersonal relationships.  And I'd be very amazed if I ever will find<br>any benefit from it, because the best model of the Universe we know has<br>nothing in the slightest to do with Astrology.  But I certainly won't rule<br>out the possibility categorically.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 18 Mar 1997 05:09 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04142; Tue, 18 Mar 1997 05:09:11 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04139<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id UAA29373; Mon, 17 Mar 1997 20:07:42 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 17 Mar 1997 20:07:42 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703180404.UAA29199@ella.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
