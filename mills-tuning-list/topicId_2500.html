This<br><seems to me to be the same kind of logic J. Reinhard is pursuing, and<br><which Mr. Wolf is vehemently objecting.  Interesting.<br><br>No. I was just illustrating how the adjective ''microtonal'' would be<br>useful<br>in talking about this particular tuning, which - assuming Reinhard is<br>refering to Cairo-sytle arabic art or pop music - uses a pythagorean tuni=<br>ng<br>with =<br><br>schisma-equavalents of ratios of five and often some added ratios of elev=<br>en<br>to get approximate quarter tones, all used, however, only in melodic<br>intervals<br>greater that semitones.<br><br>While the source collection contains _microtones_, the sub-collections<br>actually used in real music do not. However, the intervals actually used<br>can be efficiently described as varying _microtonally_ from reference<br>intervals.<br><br>I don't want to drag this out any longer, but the word ''microtone'' =<br><br>clearly signifies something _small_, and to adopt a new definition that<br>is so broad as to erase this basic significance - indeed, to follow<br>Reinhard, to have no significance at all - is contrary to common sense,<br>and,<br>from the viewpoint of someone who would like to promote the use of a<br>variety of tunings, counterproductive.   =<br><br><br><br>Dr. Daniel J.
