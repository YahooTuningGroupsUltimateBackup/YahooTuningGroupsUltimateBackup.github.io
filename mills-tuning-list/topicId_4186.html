It was<br>found that they more easily discriminated between the just and out-of-tune<br>fifths than between just and out-of-tune 45/32 tritones.  Details are in the<br>paper: "Sensory consonance and the perceptual similarity of complex-tone<br>harmonic intervals: Tests of adult and infant listeners"  Journal of the <br>Acoustical Society of America vol. 100 (5) November 1996 by E. Glenn<br>Schellenberg and Laurel J. Trainor.  In that paper there are references to<br>other research papers in this same area.</div>
