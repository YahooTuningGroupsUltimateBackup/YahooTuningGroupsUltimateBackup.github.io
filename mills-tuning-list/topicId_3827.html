His translator, Ellis, suggested 27 tones of meantone<br>or Pythagorean (p.433-434) and it was he who named the 1/8th skhisma tuning<br>after Helmholtz (p.435). On page 437, Ellis says it is audibly equivalent<br>to<br>Sauveur's theoretical cycle of 301 tones/octave (heptamerides).<br><br>Ellis also constructed a 53 tone irregular tuning, which he called somewhat<br>oxymoronically "unequally just," from the central 56 tones of the<br>Duodenarium by ignoring the skhisma and using fifths of 700 and 702 cents<br>(pp.435 and 465). <br><br>Ellis is still a good source for extended JI tunings and instruments to<br>play them.<br><br>The 1/9th Skhisma tuning was discovered as far as I know by Eduardo<br>Sabat-Garibaldi in the 1960's. He also uses 53 tones of the tuning.<br><br><br>--John</div>
