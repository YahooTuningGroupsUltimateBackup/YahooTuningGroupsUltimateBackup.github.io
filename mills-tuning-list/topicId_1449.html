This is a <br>simple repetitive song for two voices and I was surprised at the intensity <br>of the emotion it aroused. This is not the crying in your beer kind of <br>emotion you'd expect when Merle sings about the same disaster you're going<br>through--I don't speak Bulgarian and my life's great at the moment. This<br>was a response of elation, and at the same time a little sadness. Do<br>some pieces of music evoke a universal response within a musical<br>subculture? Is there some underlying resonant structure in our brains<br>that lets us recognize great music, or respond emotionally to "emotion<br>invoking" music?<br>	I have had deep emotional responses to mathematics when I saw for <br>the first time some deep connection, but mathematics is somehow <br>different. There is more cross cultural agreement as to what is beautiful <br>or deep mathematics than there is to music. In mathematics a theorem is <br>considered true, and therefore worthy of attention, when it can be proven.<br>A proof can show the place of a theorem in the larger structure of <br>mathematics of some type, and sometimes the structure and tools of a <br>proof shows the deep connection between different branches of <br>mathematics. <br>	Are the realtions between musical structures comparable to <br>the relations between mathematical structures? Is a great theme somehow a <br>great musical theorem and the musical development of the theme its proof? <br><br>Gettin' all philosophical on ya,<br>John Starrett 	<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 31 Dec 1996 02:52 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05444; Tue, 31 Dec 1996 02:55:21 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05442<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id RAA04809; Mon, 30 Dec 1996 17:55:18 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 30 Dec 1996 17:55:18 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95.961230174402.6862A-100000@equinox><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4436 href="#4436">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;106232.3266@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/1996 2:14:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Haverstick wrote:<br><br>''... I think the points raised lately concerning the<br>connection between tunings, music, and larger "Metaphysical" issues are<br>very important, and should be pursued.''<br><br>A response:<br><br>In the end, what drives a passion for music is not a set of numbers or a<br>piece of technology (no matter how ''elegant'' in construction), but some<br>very deep psychological response to the sound of a music, the way it is<br>articulated in time, and the way in which it resonates with an individual's<br>memory and imagination.. What is attractive about tuning theory is that it<br>is a way of getting fairly concrete handles on extremely subjective<br>matters. A description of a tuning system may appear to be a cold and<br>indirect approach to musics we respond to emotionally, but it is perhaps<br>the only approach that may be tested objectively and communicated<br>universally. If we wish to speak or write directly of emotional responses<br>we are forced into an adjectival deadend and communication is virtually<br>impossible. If however, we are driven to communicate our emotional response<br>to Music directly, why do we need to resort to words at all? Isn't the most<br>appropriate response to a piece of music a new piece of music? (This last<br>was something I learned from Charles Seeger). <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 31 Dec 1996 14:40 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05730; Tue, 31 Dec 1996 14:43:32 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05735<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id FAA12140; Tue, 31 Dec 1996 05:43:28 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 31 Dec 1996 05:43:28 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.95.961231083112.3965A-100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4437 href="#4437">ðŸ”—</a>Johnny Reinhard &#x3C;reinhard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/1996 5:43:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I believe the use of "just" is reference to honest as being explicit to<br>nature's overtone series.

It is<br>safer to define Just intonation in terms of whole number ratios, and then<br>to distinguish between varieties of JI on the basis of the genus (a la<br>Euler) or limit (a la Partch). So Pythagorean tuning is a type of (3^n) or<br>three limit JI; much tonal music can be performed in (3^n,5^n) or five<br>limit JI; the Partchian Diamond is a species of (3^4,5^2,7^2,11^2) or<br>eleven limit JI etc. <br><br>The Morley text (1596) - excellent for rhythmic modes and diminution but<br>decidedly deficient for intonation - is the first of what kind?
