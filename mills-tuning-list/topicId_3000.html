It supports Roland"s GS<br>>specification, an extension of General MIDI.  My understanding is that all<br>>Roland GS instruments have one octave based microtuning per part, or MIDI<br>>channel, but that they may only be accessible through MIDI System Exclusive<br>>codes.  If the sequencer in the PMA-5 allows the user to define and embed<br>>Sysex, then the unit would be capable of self-contained microtonal music,<br>>otherwise an external sequencer would be needed to generate the microtonal<br>>parts.  Worst case, it ought to be possible to generate the Sysex microtuning<br>>file on your computer, record it on the PMA-5, then use that setup file as<br>>the basis for any compositions.<br>><br>>The PMA-5 is listed at my Microtonal Synthesis web site, located at:<br>>http://freeweb.pdq.net/jloffink/<br>><br>>John Loffink<br>>john.loffink@compaq.com<br>><br>><br>><br>>   I just heard that Roland recently released what they call a "Personal<br>>Music Assistant".  It is, essentially, a music-oriented PDA (Personal<br>>Digital Assistant, like the Newton).  Apparently it lets you do some pretty<br>>typical (ooo, that might be a problem right there!) compositional tasks<br>>with a pen-based interface, and play the results over MIDI, presumably<br>>General MIDI.  I hear it sells for a few hundred US$.<br>><br>>   Anybody know if this beastie has any microtonal capability, or any other<br>>info or thoughts on it?  I suppose microtonal capability would be too much<br>>to ask.<br>><br>><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Prent Rodgers <prodgers@us.ibm.com><br>Subject:  Our instruments<br>PostedDate:  06-01-98 18:02:23<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  06-01-98 18:01:59-06-01-98 18:02:00,06-01-98 18:01:55-06-01-98 18:01:56<br>DeliveredDate:  06-01-98 18:01:56<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256584.005D8EA1; Tue, 6 Jan 1998 18:01:53 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07413; Tue, 6 Jan 1998 18:02:23 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 6 Jan 1998 18:02:23 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05075<br>Received: (qmail 17083 invoked from network); 6 Jan 1998 09:02:19 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 6 Jan 1998 09:02:19 -0800<br>Message-Id: <5030050002606435000002L552*@MHS><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=7007 href="#7007">ðŸ”—</a>jpff@maths.bath.ac.uk</h3><span>1/11/1998 11:14:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Message written at 10 Jan 1998 17:10:42 +0000<br><br>I am not sure that this question, what microtonal instruments you own<br>and play, was directed at me.  But in the spirit if the reckless<br>pursuit of truth....<br><br>My main microtonal instrument is an SGI Indigo R3000, aging but still<br>in fine voice.  The secondary instruments are a PC/Pentium166<br>(recently upgraded from a 60MHz), and a new PentiumII/266, which will<br>be upgraded to Linux as soon as the 166 has settled down.  I also have<br>a portable 133Hz ThinkPad560 which is used largely for sounds, and a<br>PowerMac which is sometimes pressed into service.<br><br>In addition I have a consort of recorders (no bass, alack) on which I<br>can and sometime do play almost any pitch.  I am actually way out of<br>practice on these though.<br><br>Others have reported voice as well; it is nigh on 35 years since I<br>sang except on a bike of course.....<br><br>==John ffitch<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Bob Lee" <quasar@wco.com><br>Subject:  Tritone ratios<br>PostedDate:  11-01-98 21:12:32<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  11-01-98 21:12:06-11-01-98 21:12:07,11-01-98 21:11:57-11-01-98 21:11:57<br>DeliveredDate:  11-01-98 21:11:57<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256589.006EF423; Sun, 11 Jan 1998 21:12:23 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA27688; Sun, 11 Jan 1998 21:12:32 +0100<br>Date: Sun, 11 Jan 1998 21:12:32 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA27656<br>Received: (qmail 20302 invoked from network); 11 Jan 1998 12:12:29 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 11 Jan 1998 12:12:29 -0800<br>Message-Id: <01bd1ecc$44d1be40$765e04c7@quasar><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
