Isn't it<br>mainly thought of as a pitch of a frequency that is snug up against a more<br>tradionally ensconsed scaffold member, one of the 12 steps to heaven?<br><br>If I played Mary Had A Little Lamb a quartertone sharp from convention's<br>A=440, then each and every tone I advanced would be a microtone.  By<br>virtue of the tortured fingerings in sometimes embarrassing postures,<br>these lambs were microtones.  Why is it no one listening to my<br>Mary... rendition on the bassoon would notice and remain<br>convinced that there were absolutely no "microtones" at play (the<br>rare perfect pitchers aside).<br><br>A tone can be an interval of major and minor size, of numerous variations,<br>actually.  It is also the blend of harmonicities and inharmonicities<br>of a plethora of amplitudes which all make up the klangfarben of vivid<br>color in musical tone.<br><br>Could a microtone be an interval that bridges to another microtone, or<br>not?  Must its pedigree be the remainder of real time arithmetical<br>calculations (let's see, this note is only so far from the closest<br>standard so since its smaller than a semitone in this case, as in any<br>other similarly, I'll say it's a "microtone" interval in the sense that<br>it's practically beneath notice melodically.  Bela Bartok rapped the<br>microtone interval in one of his published Harvard lectures saying that<br>the semitone was an awful enough dissonance that it wasn't necessary to<br>push it down further to a quartertone interval which always wants to rise<br>back up.<br><br>Now, a quartertone is a microtone interval.  Which is more maleable, I<br>wonder.  Depends I guess...<br><br>"Microtonal" is the personal sensibility one achieves when making the<br>acquaintence of a progressive number of powerful sound<br>angles...skipping stones on the sound continuum one moment,<br>placing stones to cross a river in the next, knocking on<br>familiar doors all along the way.<br><br>"Microtonality" is the realm which houses the encylopedia of<br>"microtonalisms" and "microtuning" in general.  "Micro" expands the way a<br>microphone expands the voice, the way the microscope expands the<br>molecular, the way the microcomputer expands our minds.<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@idt.net<br>http://www.echonyc.com/~jhhl/AFMM<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Andrew L.
