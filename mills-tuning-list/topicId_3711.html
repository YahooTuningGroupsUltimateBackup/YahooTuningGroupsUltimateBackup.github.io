(for example).<br><br>Yes, but if you extrapolate from key A to key B and the desired interval is<br>not an exact integer cents division you might get some small error (1 cent<br>per range) in the extrapolation.  Normally, you define a full octave and<br>extrapolate that.<br><br>> 1. Explain why high end resolution of 0.0061 cents would be useful? <br>> Otherwise manufacturers will assume craziness? Suggest other options <br>> and why?  <br><br>That's the highest resolution of the MIDI Tuning Standard.  It's not useful<br>for me, but is for some people doing drones.  By high end I'm really<br>referring to computer synthesis type programs, not your everyday keyboard<br>synthesizer.  This should be spelled out in the wishlist.  MIDI response<br>isn't fast enough to make that pitch resolution usable due to phase<br>cancellations, as discussed previously in the list.<br><br>Manufacturers will think we're crazy asking for 0.1 cent resolution.  I'll<br>probably rephrase the pitch resolutions as "to 0.1 cent or best possible<br>cents resolution" and add some exposition to the requests.  In a wavetable<br>synthesizer the underlying samples would never be tuned to that accuracy. <br>Sorry, but it's true.  Writing some new code is one thing, but<br>manufacturers are not going to order their sound development groups to tune<br>everything to 0.1 cent accuracy just for us microtonalist's benefit.  That<br>would be a huge labor effort on their part.  The idea is to keep this as<br>simple as possible, thereby raising the probability that these ideas will<br>be implemented.<br><br>> 3. I'm unclear how far the last line of your high-end  spec addresses <br>> the question of adaptive tunings  ("real-time updates of note <br>> pitches is selectable per note as instant pitch correction or new <br>> note only").

How best <br>> to provide *user configurability* for real-time adaptivit(ies) is not <br>> my area - but others might like to suggest?<br><br>I'm open to any ideas on this.  I got the idea from the Justonic folks.  I<br>use new note only updates myself.  They were more inclined to real-time<br>updates, giving as an example barbershop quartets where a pitch swoop<br>wouldn't be out of place.  The MIDI Tuning standard also requests real-time<br>updates.  Do we really need both types available simultaneously?<br><br>> 5. Measurements in Cents and/or Hz and/or *Ratios*(?).

It's important to break away the things that make<br>microtuning convenient from those that make it possible.  Asking or<br>demanding too much work from the software engineers who write these<br>programs is likely to get us nothing in return.
