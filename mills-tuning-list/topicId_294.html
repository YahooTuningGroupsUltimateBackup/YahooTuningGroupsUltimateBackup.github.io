But using it like a fourth does seem to help break the mold of<br>thinking of 9:7 as a poor step-cousin of 5:4.  <br><br>   Perhaps the most intuitive melodic way to invoke the sense and expectation of<br>a fourth, into which you can substitute a 9:7, is in the old classic rising<br>fourth from a pick-up note on diatonic step 5 to the tonic (e.g., Old Lang Syne,<br>or however that's spelled).  <br><br><br>+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+<br>|  Tip #10:                                                                  |<br>|     When you first introduce 9:7s in an actual composition, don't be timid |<br>|     with them.                                                             |<br>+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+<br><br><br>   Presenting anything too timidly makes it sound like a mistake, in this case,<br>like you accidentally played a 5:4 too sharp.  Go ahead and blare it out with<br>rock steady tones.  Feel free to start a motif with 9:7s on an accented beat,<br>and then repeat or sequence that motif.  As my ol' freshman Theory instructor<br>put it, repetition is the great legitimizer in music.  <br><br><br>+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+<br>|  Tip #11:                                                                  |<br>|     A subtle (but clearly diliberate) way to ease timid ears into harmonic |<br>|     9:7s, is by using a drone or suspending a note from a previous chord   |<br>|     that forms a 9:7 with a new chord tone.                                |<br>+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+<br><br><br>   I have found exploring first melody, and then melody with drones, especially<br>useful when I'm exploring ALL facets of a new tuning.  So in the case of you,<br>the composer, getting comfortable with 9:7, drones might be the ticket.  But you<br>might want to consider the suspension approach in "real" compositions, since<br>that's more interesting contrapuntally, and musically in general.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 21 Jan 1996 13:53 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id EAA00486; Sun, 21 Jan 1996 04:53:03 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 21 Jan 1996 04:53:03 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199601211251.EAA26386@netcom6.netcom.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
