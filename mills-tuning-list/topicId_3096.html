My<br>idea was to tune my instrument at 440+12db (something close to 444, it<br>seems) and then calibrate the tuner at 440 trying to switch from +14db<br>notes (i.e., tuned to 12ET) to correct notes (i.e. just major<br>thirds:12ET-14db). Of course, this is no replacement for any group<br>practice but the -14db target isn't that easy to reach.<br>Then, I wanted to do the same thing with minor thirds which gets a bit<br>more complicated as, on a sax, it's better to lower a note than to raise<br>it (because the jaw has to be relaxed).<br><br>>Since you're only playing one note at a time, you have a much simpler problem<br>than a steel<br>>guitarist.<br>Well, *I* wouldn't say that, of course... ;-)<br>The concept of tuning a sax is usually limited to adjusting the<br>mouthpiece so that notes are in a correct range. But our main problem is<br>that any movement from the lower lip causes a certain change in pitch. We<br>can also change the pitch using corrective fingerings which are usually<br>hard to use on anything but long notes. Then, everything changes from one<br>instrument to another. To make things rather amusing, temperature has a<br>very important effect on metal instruments...<br>So we have to fiddle a lot. Our lower lip acts somewhat like the slide of<br>a trombone but this tuning method can change the quality of the sound,<br>may be quite hard at ppp, in the lower range or on a flat note. So it<br>takes a lot of practice to make this method acurate.<br><br>>I love classical sax quartets, by the way.<br>Really? Wow! First time I hear that from a steel guitarist! ;-)<br><br>>  Someday I'd like to hear a steer guitar with one.<br>Well, if you ever come to Montreal, give me a call, we might think of<br>something...<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Alex <enkerli@iname.com><br>Subject:  Tuning in West African music<br>PostedDate:  31-01-98 00:45:49<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  31-01-98 00:45:00-31-01-98 00:45:01,31-01-98 00:43:44-31-01-98 00:43:45<br>DeliveredDate:  31-01-98 00:43:45<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125659C.008271D0; Sat, 31 Jan 1998 00:44:48 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03033; Sat, 31 Jan 1998 00:45:49 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 31 Jan 1998 00:45:49 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03031<br>Received: (qmail 8138 invoked from network); 30 Jan 1998 15:44:42 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 30 Jan 1998 15:44:42 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199801302341.SAA17852@ulys.POSTE.UMontreal.CA><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
