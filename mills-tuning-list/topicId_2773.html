They are as necessary to music, either melodically or<br>harmonically conceived, as the numerals are to mathematics, and their<br>existence is just as certain.<br><br>I apologize if all this seems too elementary to be worth stating. But<br>these principles have been repeatedly denied by a certain school of<br>modern theory, at least by implication.<br><br>Having now set the stage, I should like to inquire what just intonation<br>is, and what is the form of just intonation that a singer (any singer,<br>not just a Western singer of some particular tradition) can use, and<br>which it is the business of temperament to imitate, both for instruments<br>and for the training of singers.<br><br>Within the octave the consonances are six in number, and _only_ six: 3:2<br>4:3 5:3 5:4 6:5 & 8:5. The septimal intervals 7:4 7:5 & 7:6 are<br>dissonances, both because their partials beat with each much more<br>severely than is the case for the consonances, and because they are<br>melodically confused with closely adjacent dissonant intervals directly<br>derived from the consonances (e.g. 16:9 with 7:4.) The septimals have no<br>harmonic connection with the six consonances, and have undoubtedly<br>dissonant inversions 8:7 10:7 & 12:7. (Septimal 'harmony' therefore<br>gives rise to dissonances.) But the six consonances do have a<br>mathematical interrelationship with each other, as will be seen.<br><br>All music begins with a tonic, the initial note. The singer in creating<br>for himself a body of tones that are interrelated acoustically, and<br>which he can remember and internalize, can proceed by the narrower,<br>conjunct intervals (closer than 6:5, say,) and here he is limited only<br>by the skill of his vocal chords and mind, which make it very difficult<br>to sing or remember pitches closer than about 55-60 cents.<br><br>As soon as music becomes disjunct, however (a compass of more than about<br>6:5) the singer (or listener or instrumentalist) runs the very real risk<br>of becoming totally confused; pitches cease to have anything in common<br>that one can remember, and music readily disintegrates into a welter of<br>random noise, that all sounds much alike, and so can have little power<br>to illustrate language or affect our emotions.<br><br>There is a great deal of evidence that non-Western cultures are at least<br>as intolerant of what they conceive to be aimless or random as the most<br>hidebound Western conservative, although certainly they define this<br>somewhat differently.<br><br>None of these ideas are new. I seek only to make myself the purveyor of<br>what the common sense of mankind knows almost instinctively. There is no<br>objection if some wish to challenge these principles. If they can find<br>an enthusiastic audience for music that violates these principles, I<br>certainly do not object. But they should be intimately aware of these<br>principles. So far composers who have sought to enshrine randomness or<br>pure dissonance have only discredited the musical art.<br><br>Fortunately, disjunct music (or what ultimately amounts to the same<br>thing, music of compass wider than about 6:5) is possible. It is the<br>phenomenon of consonance that makes it so.<br><br>In our century consonance has acquired a reputation for vaguely<br>indicating hypocrisy or insincerity or immaturiy in those who love it;<br>one thinks of sugary-sweet childrens' choirs singing one of the more<br>uninspired polyphonic masters - or something much worse. This is a very<br>dangerous mistake. Consonances are not the enemy of dissonance. They<br>only are what make dissonance itself emotionally meaningful. Not only<br>that, but consonances alone make disjunct melody itself possible. And<br>this is as true for the Indian or Arab or Turk as for the cultural heirs<br>of the Greeks and Romans.<br><br>Providentially - or perhaps this is the result of human evolution itself<br>- just as melody becomes too disjunct to keep in order by the<br>'dead-reckoning' of conjunct intervals alone, we find an undoubted<br>consonance, 6:5. We then find a series of consonant, beat-free intervals<br>that provide us with sure resting points for the voice (and for the<br>understanding) and which melody can invest with the most profound<br>emotional significance. Again, this is as true for the rock singer as<br>for the opera singer or an Indian singer.<br><br>Once we reach any one of these consonances, we can take it for a new<br>tonic, though in subordination to the original tonic. (I have no space<br>here to discuss how the tonic can be changed, but I will consider that<br>elsewhere in a more appropriate forum.) By this means we can, for<br>example, if we wish, sound a minor third above the original minor third,<br>so that we reach 6/5 x 6/5 = 36/25 which is dissonant with the original<br>tonic, and disjunct, but - and this is a kind of miracle - nevertheless<br>singable with fair accuracy and comprehensible to us.<br><br>Conjunct intervals intercalated between these disjunct consonances<br>further assist the voice and the understanding.<br><br>Such dissonances as 36:25 (the diminished fifth) number twelve within<br>the octave. They hold a quite unique place among the dissonances,<br>because they are, in a sense, 'consonant with the tonic at one remove',<br>as it were, because they can be sung entirely by singing consonances,<br>though since a subtonic (6:5 in this example), that is to say, an<br>intermediate tonic, separates them from the original tonic, they are not<br>so closely related to the tonic as are the six consonances.<br><br>I call these intervals 'tonal dissonances', because they more than<br>anything else bind disjunct music together and make it tonal, that is to<br>say coherent and consistent with itself. I am not of course referring to<br>the so-called 'tonal' era of Western music, which might be better called<br>the period of its decadence.<br><br>The human voice does not sound these intervals with the same confidence<br>and accuracy that it sounds the consonances, or even those conjunct<br>dissonances made familiar to it by cultural training. Nevertheless it<br>can readily distinguish the tonal dissonance 25:18 (the augmented<br>fourth) from the tonal disonance 36:25 (the diminished fifth) because<br>these are 63 cents apart, because they indicate quite different<br>relations to the tonic, and also because there is enough 'tonal space'<br>between 4:3 and 3:2 so that two (but not three) pitches can be kept<br>melodically distinct, both from each other and from the adjacent<br>consonances:<br><br>4:3		25:18		36:25		3:2<br><br>The 25:18 occurs in the lydian mode, and has an entirely different<br>psychological effect eery and weird, but relaxed) from 36:25, which has<br>a menacing, tense effect, and occurs in the locrian mode. The septimal<br>dissonance 7:5 (the septimal tritone) also lies between 4:3 and 3:2, but<br>becasue it lacks any relation with the consonances, and has a dissonant<br>inversion 10:7, it is melodically and harmonically confounded with 25:18<br>(only 14 cents narrower than 7:5.) The tonal dissonance 25:18 is in fact<br>much more easy for a singer to sing than 7:5, because the former is part<br>of the fabric woven from the undoubted consonances, whereas 7:5 occupies<br>the shadowy, weird realm between consonance and dissonance.<br><br>Here are the six consonances and twelve tonal dissonances, together with<br>the prime and octave:<br><br>1:1 25:24 16:15 10:9 9:8 6:5 5:4 32:25 4:3 25:18 36:25 3:2 25:16 8:5 5:3<br>16:9 9:5 15:8 48:25 2:1<br><br>Or in cents:<br><br>0 71 112 182 204 316 386 427 498 569 631 702 773 814 884 996 1018 1088<br>1129 1200<br><br>or by name:<br><br>augmented prime, diminished second, minor tone, major tone, minor third,<br>major third, diminished fourth, perfect fourth, augmented fourth or<br>tritone, diminished fifth, perfect fifth, augmented fifth, minor sixth,<br>major sixth, subminor seventh, superminor seventh, major seventh,<br>diminished octave, octave<br><br>Every music theorist has these values by heart, as well he should have -<br>they are part of the basic vocabulary of music.<br><br>Many of these intervals are inconveniently close for the voice. For<br>example, 25:24 and 16:15 are separated by only the doubly diminished<br>second, alias the diesis, 128:125, 41 cents. The melodic limen of 55-60<br>cents suggests that the voice (and mind) cannot reliably use more than<br>about 20 pitches in the octave. Perhaps our species will one day come<br>into contact with creatures who have a different limen.<br><br>Now it happens that the consonances and tonal dissonances number 19<br>pitches within the octave.<br><br>The obvious (and only) solution is to divide the octave into about 20<br>equal degrees. It happens that only one temperament within 12 and 31<br>equal tones in the octave gives reasonably accurate values for the<br>consonances, and also conciliates the three consonant cycles in such a<br>manner that all consonances are available not merely on one tonic, but<br>on all possible tonics.<br><br>This is the 19-tone equal temperamnt. The 12-tone equal temperament<br>gives reasonable (or halfway reasonable) values only for the<br>consonances. The 19-tone equal gives much better values for the<br>consonances, although its fifths are rougher, and also gives good values<br>for the tonal disonances, which is no less important, for music is not<br>only consonance and conjunct dissonance, but disjunct dissonance also.<br><br>It may be instructive to pursue the method further, and ask ourselves,<br>could singers reliably relate dissonances to the tonic through a<br>sub-subtonic? For example, could one proceed from 6:5 to 36:25 and again<br>by a minor third to 216:125, the greater diminished seventh? Probably<br>not. But even if one could, the resulting 18 additional dissonances -<br>I call them 'atonal dissonances' - are so close that no singer could<br>ever keep them melodically distinct. The 31-tone equal is the<br>temperament that corresponds to the introduction of the 'atonal<br>dissonances'. But the 19-tone equal accepts four of these into its<br>fabric, namely the diminished third 144:125 and the augmented minor tone<br>125:108, which it merges into a single tone that is also confounded with<br>7:6; and the greater diminished seventh 216:125 and augmented sixth<br>125:72 which it also merges, and likewise confounds with the septimal<br>interval 7:4.<br><br>Here are the 18 atonal dissonances:<br><br>128:125 27:25 144:125 125:108 75:64 32:27 125:96 27:20 45:32 64:45 40:27<br>192:125 27:16 128:75 216:125 125:72 50:27 125:64<br><br>and in cents:<br><br>41 133 245 253 275 294 457 520 590 610 680 743 906 925 947 955 1067 1159<br><br>or by name:<br><br>doubly diminished minor tone, diminished major tone, diminished third,<br>augmented minor tone, augmented major tone, subminor third, augmented<br>third, superperfect fourth, superaugmented fourth, subdiminished fifth,<br>subperfect fifth, diminished sixth, supermajor sixth, lesser diminished<br>seventh, greater diminished seventh, augmented sixth, submajor seventh,<br>augmented seventh<br><br>Note that four different, incompatible terminologies are used: the<br>10:9/9:8 and 16:9/9:5,<br>as the commatically separated intervals, by tradition have each their<br>own terminology, as do the thirds and sixths on the one hand (major and<br>minor) and the fourths, fifths, primes and octaves on the other<br>(perfect). No authorities use quite the same terminology, and none that<br>I have found include quite all the intervals.<br><br>There is a direct and exact relationship between just intonation and the<br>three best temperaments of all, namely 12- 19- & 31-tone equal. The<br>12-tone equal loosely approximates the consonances, but radically<br>distorts the tonal dissonances, so much so indeed that certain of these<br>(e.g. the diminished fourth 32:25) are confounded with consonances. This<br>particularly disturbed Helmholtz, and he was right to be disturbed.<br>Certain nineteenth century composers used this in their modulations,<br>with results that quickly became a clich?. The 19-tone equal gives close<br>approximations to the consonances and the tonal dissonances, while<br>confounding the atonal dissonances with the tonals. Finally, the 31-tone<br>equal gives close approximations to the consonances, tonal dissonances<br>and atonal dissonances, the last to no good or useful effect.<br><br>The method can of course be pursued yet further, to 24 'ultra-atonal<br>dissonances', and leads to 50-tone equal temperament (virtually<br>Zarlino's 2/7 comma mesotonic.) The 43- & 55-tone equal are also fully<br>cyclic, and constitute alternate, though less logical methods of<br>conciliating the divers categories of intervals.<br><br>Our notation is closely in accord with 19- 31- & 50-tone equal. The<br>first of these may be called the 'system of the flat and sharp', the<br>second the 'system of the double flat and double sharp', and the last<br>the 'system of the triple flat and triple sharp'. The 12-tone of course<br>confounds both flat and sharp, and also, at two points, accidental with<br>natural. The 43- & 55-tone equal are also mixed systems.<br><br>There are many systems of just intonation. But I daresay this system<br>corresponds most nearly  to what is actually possible for the voice, and<br>present to the mind.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Reply to Graham Breed<br>PostedDate:  14-12-97 02:27:27<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  14-12-97 02:25:34-14-12-97 02:25:35,14-12-97 02:25:16-14-12-97 02:25:17<br>DeliveredDate:  14-12-97 02:25:17<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656D.0007D103; Sun, 14 Dec 1997 02:27:18 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14772; Sun, 14 Dec 1997 02:27:27 +0100<br>Date: Sun, 14 Dec 1997 02:27:27 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14769<br>Received: (qmail 29027 invoked from network); 13 Dec 1997 17:27:24 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 13 Dec 1997 17:27:24 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3493987D.855@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6641 href="#6641">ðŸ”—</a>Steven  Rezsutek &#x3C;rezsutek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/1997 9:40:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net spake thusly:<br><br>> Alas, the incommensurability of the thirds and fifths in 22-tone<br>> equal does not arise only when modulation is employed, which I have<br>> always been very careful to note.
