(..) If you want to back up 650 MB, you<br>want to have another 650 MB on your hard disk<br>empty to store the image, which is then <br>transferred to the CD-R (..) You get *one shot<br>at writing to the disk* from beginning to end.<br>You can do multiple sessions, but that's a *real<br>hassle too.* The point is that once the CD-ROM<br>starts to `burn' you can't stop it.  If there's a<br>glitch, brownout, operating system hiccup,<br>horribly fragmented file, or any number of<br>things, then the CD doesn't get burned, and you<br>end up with a *blown session.*  These are<br>common, and *the result is a totally useless<br>disk* that must be discarded. It takes<br>a couple of hours to prepare your files to be <br>burned into the disk.  If something changes,<br>you have to start over.  And if your hard disk<br>isn't fast enough, you can't even burn the<br>disk at all.<br>"One vendor told me that the quad-speed CD-<br>ROM writers *were kept off the market* <br>because the system requirements were<br>outrageous, and tolerances for error was<br>nil.  I recommend people buy a cheap Tahiti<br>optical drive and use it for backup and <br>archiving instead--at least until a new<br>technology arrives called *packet writing.*<br>Packet writing is now being standardized,<br>and it will allow a CD-R to act a little more <br>like a normal optical drive insofar as <br>using for backup is concerned.  I'm told<br>that many of the CD-R units on the market<br>will be upgradble to packet writing<br>technologyw ith a BIOS revision.  Make sure<br>to check before you buy a CD-R.  Until <br>packet writing comes along, these devices<br>are *close to being useless for the average<br>user.*"  [Dvorak, John C., "Inside Track,"<br>in PC Magazine, March 26, 1996, pg. 91]<br>The test reported on this forum in which<br>a 15-minute audio file was written to<br>CD-R is, alas, meaningless.  The acid test:<br>how often does the drive and disc combo<br>produce a bad burn when a full 680 megs<br>of audio data are written non-stop to<br>CD-R disk?<br>Reports suggest that the error rate right<br>now is around 60%, depending on the brand<br>of CD-R disc.  That is, 6 out of 10 discs<br>produce a bad burn and a blown disc which<br>must be discarded. Worse still, my gearhead<br>friends inform me that the writeable CD<br>technology is so flaky that to get good<br>results, people who burn their own CD<br>ROMs must check the grapevine to see<br>which brand name of writeable CD-R <br>disc has a bad error rate this month,<br>and which manufacturer came out with<br>a good batch.  One month TDK writeable<br>CD-R discs produced near-100% bad burns,<br>the next month it was Mitsui, the next<br>month Sony... And it changes from one<br>month to the next.  You get the idea.<br>Worse still, many CD-R writeable drives<br>will burn discs that other brands of<br>CD-ROM read-only drives cannot read.<br>Let's take some detailed examples,<br>from "The Great American Burnout,"<br>Multimedia World, July 1996, pp. 58-<br>66, in which 20 different CD-R burner<br>drives were compared:<br>"JVC's Personal Archiver 2X for<br>Windows 3.x and Windows 95 eliminates<br>compatibility issues; but it limits you<br>to burning discs on JVC recorders..."<br>"On the HP SureStore 4020i, none of<br>the included software would run our<br>write tests..."<br>"[On the Microboards PlayWrite 4000]<br>premastering packages can record Red<br>Book audio tracks, but they lack<br>audio-editing features, and [the<br>Microboards']  Red Roaster's ability to<br>set up subchannel codes for subindices<br>and program pauses...]<br>"[MicroNet Master CD Plus] the 512K<br>buffer can be a problem with slower 486 <br>systems...]<br>"Though it supports all modes of writing,<br>the drive failed the CD Extra test. According<br>to Olympus, the PC versions of Gear don't<br>handle the [Olympus Deltis CD-R2] properly,<br>causing the failure..."<br>"[On the Pioneer DW-S114X] we created CD<br>Extra discs without a problem; but the read<br>tests failed, with bad sector errors.  This<br>recorder requires CD-R media to be in pristine<br>condition..."<br>"We couldn't get [the Smart & Friendly CD-R<br>1002] to burn a CD-DA + XA two-session disc.  <br>Our attempts to add a session after recording<br>a session with audio tracks resulted in a<br>cryptic `Toolkit or virtual CD error' from<br>Easy-CD Pro.  Since we were able to add data<br>on the very same CD-R disc using the same<br>software but another recorder, the Sony<br>mechanism appears to have been the culprit..."<br>"Easy-CD Pro returned a cryptic `Toolkit<br>Error: 136' and Gear's manual stated that<br>the [Sony Spressa 9221] doesn't support<br>CD Extra..."<br>"While the write performance is excellent,<br>the [Yamha CDR100] cannot effectively<br>double as a reader, because of slow<br>access times..."<br>The Philips CDD 2000 got the highest marks<br>from Multimedia World magazine--which,<br>compared with the dismal results from the<br>other drives, means that the Philips CDD <br>2000 might actually *work*--some of the time.<br>Now let's deal with some anecdotal evidence:<br>Gary Morrison and I paid for a CD-R audio<br>disc as the pre-master of our CD release,<br>"Detwelvulate!" containing 74 minutes of<br>Ivor Darreg's microtonal music.<br>I tried to play the CD-R master last week.<br>It's now unplayable, some 18 months after<br>it was burned.<br>Despite all the nonsense about the photoreactive<br>dye lasting 10 years, 20 years, 500 years,<br>or what-have-you, the brutal reality is that<br>CD-R discs don't last very long.  A year,<br>maximum.  Probably less.<br>The problems afflicting CD-Rs, once written,<br>are legion:<br>[1] Fingerprints are permanent.  They cannot<br>be burnished off.  Try to do so, and you'll<br>destroy the CD-R because you'll smudge the<br>photoreactive dye.<br>[2] The photoreactive dye is laid down in a<br>single continuous spiral track 1/10 the width<br>of a human hair.  As the disc endures thermal<br>stress in winter and summer, the single <br>continuous spiral track distorts and finally<br>becomes unreadable.<br>[3] If the spiral dye channel is even <br>microsopically off-center, the CD-ROM<br>drive will accumulate so many errors as<br>the drive head runs from the inside toward<br>the outside fo the CD-R disc that the disc<br>will be unreadable.<br>Thus, unfortunately, the writeable CD<br>technology is not ready for prime time.<br>I researched the technology 6 months ago:<br>it was dismal.  Packet-writing drives are<br>now beginning to become available, but<br>it doesn't seem to have helped the abysmal<br>error rate of the CD-R media, nor has it<br>helped lengthen the ridiculously short life<br>span of dye-based CD-R discs once burned.<br>Those of you who are contemplating buying<br>a CD-R writeable drive to burn your own<br>microtonal audio CDs would do well to <br>wait another 3-5 years.  Perhaps the technology <br>will have been debugged by then.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 2 Sep 1996 20:53 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06941; Mon, 2 Sep 1996 20:54:07 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14925<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA07506; Mon, 2 Sep 1996 11:18:25 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 2 Sep 1996 11:18:25 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960902181107_71670.2576_HHB36-4@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
