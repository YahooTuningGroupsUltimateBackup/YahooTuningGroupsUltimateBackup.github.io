Szanto&#x22; &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/1996 2:05:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>To the Tuning List Patrons -<br><br>> Sorry, Jon, no dice.<br><br>Johnny has dismissed me out of hand.  Allow me, at the risk of wasting precious <br>bandwidth, a little response; to whit:<br><br>> Contrary to Mr. Szanto's assertions, I neither ignored nor <br>> miscomprehended Mr. Partch's oeuvre.  Once again, the use of the <br>> synthesizer for the Chromelodion was discussed as acceptable by Danlee <br>> Mitchell over the phone - the only possible substituion allowable.  Mr. <br>> Drummond's hoarding of the instruments is not related at all to this usage.<br><br>Yes, he did miscomprehend.  Harry Partch would have never allowed his music to be <br>recreated by anything other than his instruments (what he would call a "...basic <br>mutilation...").  Something that still amazes me: people want to treat Partch just <br>like *any* other composer, that he wrote music, with no strings attached.  I don't <br>mean that Partch was better than other composers, but he is an *altogether* <br>different set of circumstances -- his own ensemble of instruments and his own (at <br>least, at the time) tuning system, which simultaneously developed along with his <br>repertoire.  And as if that weren't enough for us mortals, all of the corporeal <br>'baggage' <g> that went along with it.  These things ARE inseparable, with the <br>tiniest of disclaimers (see below).  I'd even like Ted Mook and Stephen Kalm to do <br>the "Li Po" in a dramatic setting...<br><br>Oh.  Danlee was wrong to have ever agreed (if he did) to the synth.  I'll drive over <br>and slap him this afternoon.<br> <br>> Dean's regular performance of 2 Studies on Ancient <br>> Greek Scales for zoomoozophone and flute, and its recording on CD - <br>> contrary to Danlee and company - belies the fury that keeps Partch under <br>> wraps, unless it is by the blessed few who worked with Partch directly.<br><br>I also disagree with Dean using non-Partch instruments for the studies, but here is <br>that little disclaimer: Harry *excepted* his little studies from the rigor that he <br>imposed on his 'real' works; please see Partch's "These two ideas..." quote in my <br>Part One reply.  You see, this isn't my idea, it's Harry's.  And while I wish Dean <br>would do them with the real instruments (maybe he does now...), the fact of the <br>matter is that these are JUST STUDIES, little pieces for Partch's investigation into <br>tunings.  They aren't the masterworks.<br><br>> Non-corporeal performances by Mr. Mitchell at Lincoln Center flies in the <br>> face of further criticisms.  <br><br>True.  I can only think of one other instance where we did a non-corporeal <br>performance of a piece, that being a concert version of "The Bewitched" in Cologne <br>in 1981.  In both cases, they were extensions of full-scale staged productions of <br>the work (Bewitched at Berlin New Music Festival, Revelation at American Music <br>Theatre Festival); the Bewitched being a live-concert broadcast for West German (my, <br>how times change...) Radio.  To single out one or two concerts out of the dozens I <br>have known about seems, well...  But, the point is well taken: do not perform Partch <br>non-corporeally.<br><br>> And the value of the synthesizer (which was unavailable to Partch) in<br>> performing "all the notes written" by the composer for his music adds an<br>> improved dimension - if only the music was listened to, rather than talked<br>> about.<br><br>Partch's music is not to be simply listened to, but seen, felt and experienced.  <br>Promoting anything less, except in a desire to 'document' a performance, is a <br>cheapening of the work itself.  Go find another composer - there are lot's of them.<br><br>> The sentimentality for Partch's mortality undercuts his role as a <br>> composer in this country.  Mr. Szanto - a fantastic bass marimba player - <br>> should have been involved with east coast performances, he was missed.  <br>> At this time there is a monopoly on his instruments as a result of <br>> territoriality and protectionism.  It should not be too surprising - had <br>> the same problem with the Charles Ives Society.  That one worked through <br>> a bit better, thankfully.<br><br>Wrong.  As before, Partch isn't just "a composer in this country".  Not better, but <br>radically different, engendering a completely different set of circumstances, both <br>when he lived and now.  Thanks for the compliment; now, maybe if Ted Mook can get <br>Yo-Yo Ma, in spite of his "territoriality and protectionism", to release his <br>Stradivarius cello for Ted's use, we can get a mondo-cool version of "Li Po".  <br>Yo-Yo, that selfish SOB.  And it seems the Partch folks aren't the only group Johnny <br>has had trouble with.  Remember, I don't know JR, but have offered to correspond <br>with him.<br><br>> Danlee Mitchell does not believe that Partch's music holds up without the <br>> exact instruments   [J.S. - I concur with Danlee...]<br>>                   formerly in his possession being used.  He wrote me on <br>> March 7, 1987, effectively derailing my planned production of King Oedipus,<br>> "I do not recall saying that I approved of Dean performing this work (2 <br>> Studies on Ancient Greek Scales) on flute and zoomooxophone(sp), and if I <br>> did I take it back.  It should be performed on HC and BM--nothing else!"  <br>> Several years later, and with original instruments in Dean's possession, <br>> it was released on Mode Records.  <br><br>Who knows why Dean recorded it that way?  Maybe he already had it on tape?  Maybe he <br>likes his Zoomoozophone?  Point is, even Dean's use of it weakens the Partch <br>aesthetic, and I wish he hadn't done it, as I'm sure Danlee does too.<br><br>I'll close with a final thought.  I am not here to say "You are a good person", "You <br>are a bad person"; I am offering my thoughts, having performed the literature, <br>worked with Harry Partch and spent a good deal of my life helping to spread the <br>amazing World of HP and his creations.  It bothers me to see phrases such as<br><br>  "a guitar "better" than Partch could hope for"<br>  "Drummond's hoarding of the instruments"<br>  "unless it is by the blessed few"<br>  "monopoly on his instruments"<br>  "territoriality and protectionism"<br>  <br>because they lower the debate to the level of bitter feelings and petty jealousies; <br>if not intended, then certainly in feel.  I would suggest that if people feel left <br>out of the Partch performance circle, they do as many members of the group have done <br>through the years: travel to where the instruments are and make yourself available <br>as a player.  Unrealistic, an unbearable sacrifice?  You betcha - just ask anyone of <br>those who did just that.  And they'll tell you it was a small bit o' effort compared <br>to the old boy himself, Harry.<br><br>"And the best of luck to you."<br><br>Jon<br>-- <br>|--------------------------------------------------|<br>|   Jonathan M.
