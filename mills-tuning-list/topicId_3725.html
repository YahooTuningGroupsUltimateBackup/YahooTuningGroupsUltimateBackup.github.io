The consistency issue which<br>Graham Breed is referring to involves the traditional definition of the<br>syntonic comma as the difference between an octave and a major sixth up,<br>and three perfect fifths up. Many equal temperaments have a better<br>approximation to the major sixth than the best approximation of a major<br>third plus the best approximation of a perfect fourth. Therefore two<br>distinct syntonic commas can be defined for such equal temperaments.<br>5-limit consistency means that the best approximations of the perfect<br>fifth/fourth, the major third, and the major sixth are all compatible.<br>Given 5-limit consistency, then, there can be only one syntonic comma.<br>ETs that are not 5-limit consistent include 11, 17, 20, and 21. 64tET is<br>interesting in that the triads defined as you or Paul Rapoport would<br>define them are not even second-best, they are third-best (i.e.,<br>altering either the major third or the perfect fifth yields a minor<br>third [or major sixth] that is so much better that the entire triad is<br>improved).<br><br>Paul Erlich<br><br>------ =_NextPart_000_01BD9E09.A133B37A<br>Content-Type: application/ms-tnef<br>Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64<br><br>eJ8+IiwSAQaQCAAEAAAAAAABAAEAAQeQBgAIAAAA5AQAAAAAAADoAAEIgAcAGAAAAElQTS5NaWNy<br>b3NvZnQgTWFpbC5Ob3RlADEIAQWAAwAOAAAAzgcGABYADgAOACQAAQAyAQEggAMADgAAAM4HBgAW<br>AA4ADgArAAEAOQEBCYABACEAAAAzQkVBMkNCOEUyMDlEMjExQUNEMjAwODA1RkJFM0MwNQBBBwEE<br>gAEAGwAAAFJlOiBDb21tYXMgYW5kIENvbnNpc3RlbmN5AHYJAQ2ABAACAAAAAgACAAEDkAYAbAgA<br>AC4AAAADADYAAAAAAAMABIAIIAYAAAAAAMAAAAAAAABGAAAAAFKFAAC3DQAAHgAFgAggBgAAAAAA<br>wAAAAAAAAEYAAAAAVIUAAAEAAAAEAAAAOC4wAAMABoAIIAYAAAAAAMAAAAAAAABGAAAAAAGFAAAA<br>AAAACwAAgAggBgAAAAAAwAAAAAAAAEYAAAAAA4UAAAAAAAALAA+ACCAGAAAAAADAAAAAAAAARgAA<br>AAAOhQAAAAAAAAMAEIAIIAYAAAAAAMAAAAAAAABGAAAAABCFAAAAAAAAAwARgAggBgAAAAAAwAAA<br>AAAAAEYAAAAAEYUAAAAAAAADABSACCAGAAAAAADAAAAAAAAARgAAAAAYhQAAAAAAAB4AJIAIIAYA<br>AAAAAMAAAAAAAABGAAAAADaFAAABAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAeACWACCAGAAAAAADAAAAAAAAARgAAAAA3<br>hQAAAQAAAAEAAAAAAAAAHgAmgAggBgAAAAAAwAAAAAAAAEYAAAAAOIUAAAEAAAABAAAAAAAAAAIB<br>CRABAAAAWQMAAFUDAABFBQAATFpGdVeEHuwDAAoAcmNwZzEyNdIyAPszNgHoIAKkA+MJAgBjaArA<br>c2V0MDYgBxMCgH0KgAjIIDubCW8OMDUCgAqBdWMAUL8LAwzQAcEI0ABBC2BuDhBIMDMzC6YgSgIg<br>YVZ0EOADoFcHQGsEkCxXCqIKhAqAWQhhIAIQclRtdQtgZRiSIAWgbYcAwAQgC4AgZXF1B0CgIHRl<br>bXAEkGEHgJ8CMAQgCsAZEBoRaXYHQMMa8RpgbyBQYRjgB/DYYXBvHNAAICcZwxvAZwUQCGAEIHB1<br>AmAEAGgbCYAbMXQN4Bvgcy4gLlQecBlhAIFzGnBuY455GdAEEApQIHdoDeAYaCBHGsAQ4G0gQtcJ<br>0R6QBAAgCXBmBJAFENcVoBwiC4B2BvB2B5EW0OUZEHQawGRpHtAWoQMgRwEBC4Aj8yBvZiNjc/55<br>AjACIA3gGWQbMCNUI+CvASAEkCABGRBiESB3CeF7GzAlAWMBkCMwKBEekSAtAMBqBbEAkHgW0CB1<br>/HAsKLMW0AnRHgAEkCIwfyhgGJAGkBbQBCAp4B8wTf8AcCAwGh8EIBDgKJInkhpw6wXAHMBwA2B4<br>B3AWwCTi/xwxI3IpKhbTI3InoB/gLk33JSEpBhbQaQsgHgAKQCNU/zD/MgUqxwhhFtAfMyIRBbD9<br>I5F3HEAj4B/gC4ArESWc/QQgYwORJ6AkZB6BGTIgcKcg4SxPHyE1LR5AbSPw/x+LB4AGIhbRHBEz<br>nyQCBCD7JSUqyy81xCoAL2gy0yoG/y+MG0IHQAMgGXEKsB7QAmD6ZR8wRxuwJ/E7fyAgQJPebkCT<br>G1E4tQIgbCAwAiAzJX4fMEVUPPUbQm5vPwVARK8FQDdhCkABACAxcjEqADE3KgAB0CoEMuIxHzA2<br>NHRIsCHSC4B/LhE9sSJyGeE9FyOwBzBk9wQgOSYZsXkIYCUQBcAca/sgoAhgbB6QOSQjYiFgSUbO<br>ZURiERAfkWQtPaJAkw8gMBtCMtNTgyAoaS7bRBAqAWwuESJyZSPwNlH/QK5QEj8fT9AIkFFgGyEp<br>ENsLgDKnWwWxKSldPQQh4f5zHEAY0CDhLeU9FxrxMvAfTqVNAxqQA2AjMGQpLvMXmhxjRXIeQBDQ<br>FTEBQAsXoxHRAGFAAAAAAwAmAAAAAAADAC4AAAAAAAsAAgABAAAAHgBwAAEAAAATAAAAVFVOSU5H<br>IGRpZ2VzdCAxNDU0AAACAXEAAQAAABsAAAABvZ31Hui4LOeQCeIR0qzSAIBfvjwFAASzW0AAQAA5<br>AKDCAp0Jnr0BAwDxPwkEAAAeADFAAQAAAAYAAABQQVVMRQAAAAMAGkAAAAAAHgAwQAEAAAAGAAAA<br>UEFVTEUAAAADABlAAAAAAAMA/T/kBAAAAwCAEP////8CAUcAAQAAADMAAABjPVVTO2E9IDtwPUFj<br>YWRpYW4tQXNzZXQ7bD1NQVJTLTk4MDYyMjE4MTQzNlotOTAyNQAAAgH5PwEAAABLAAAAAAAAANyn<br>QMjAQhAatLkIACsv4YIBAAAAAAAAAC9PPUFDQURJQU4tQVNTRVQvT1U9QUFNL0NOPVJFQ0lQSUVO<br>VFMvQ049UEFVTEUAAB4A+D8BAAAADwAAAFBhdWwgSC4gRXJsaWNoAAAeADhAAQAAAAYAAABQQVVM<br>RQAAAAIB+z8BAAAASwAAAAAAAADcp0DIwEIQGrS5CAArL+GCAQAAAAAAAAAvTz1BQ0FESUFOLUFT<br>U0VUL09VPUFBTS9DTj1SRUNJUElFTlRTL0NOPVBBVUxFAAAeAPo/AQAAAA8AAABQYXVsIEguIEVy<br>bGljaAAAHgA5QAEAAAAGAAAAUEFVTEUAAABAAAcwRtECnQmevQFAAAgwerMzoQmevQEeAD0AAQAA<br>AAUAAABSZTogAAAAAB4AHQ4BAAAAFwAAAENvbW1hcyBhbmQgQ29uc2lzdGVuY3kAAB4ANRABAAAA<br>LgAAADxCRTFCRkQwNzM5RDhEMTExQUNDODAwODA1RkJFM0MwNTE0OTVFNkBNQVJTPgAAAAsAKQAA<br>AAAACwAjAAAAAAADAAYQA43eaAMABxDAAwAAAwAQEAAAAAADABEQAAAAAB4ACBABAAAAZQAAAEpP<br>TkFUSEFOV0FMS0VSLFlPVVJGT1JNVUxBRUZPUkNPTU1BU0lORVFVQUxURU1QRVJBTUVOVFNBUkVF<br>UVVJVkFMRU5UVE9QQVVMUkFQT1BPUlRTSU5WQVJJT1VTUFVCTElTSEUAAAAAAgF/AAEAAAAuAAAA<br>PEJFMUJGRDA3MzlEOEQxMTFBQ0M4MDA4MDVGQkUzQzA1MTQ5NUU2QE1BUlM+AAAAo9o=<br><br>------ =_NextPart_000_01BD9E09.A133B37A--</div><h3><a id=8163 href="#8163">ðŸ”—</a>kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk (Jonathan Walker)</h3><span>6/21/1998 8:25:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Graham Breed wrote:<br>> <br>> Jonathan Walker wrote:<br>> <br>> >If the best approximations of 3/2 and 5/4 are consistent in n-ET, for<br>> >any integer n, then<br>> <br>> >      4[1/2 + nlog_2 3/2] mod n == [1/2 + nlog_2 5/4]<br>> <br>> >but if the two sides are unequal then a syntonic-comma equivalent is<br>> >present in that n-ET.
