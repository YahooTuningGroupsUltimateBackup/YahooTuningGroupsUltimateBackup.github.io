I <br>have been familiar with these facts, including the integer harmonicity of <br>sustained bowed strings and consistently blown wind/brass tones, for some <br>time now, and have been posting to that effect recently. I'm glad to have <br>more authority on my side, but it doesn't change my opinions and probably <br>won't change the extent to which they are ignored. :)<br><br>Matt, I pursued the entire line of discussion with Charles Lucy years ago on <br>rec.music.compose. The man is clearly interested only in promulgating his <br>opinions -- any factual evidence that "supports" them he will gladly jump <br>on, while all contradictory evidence or semblance of mathematical reasoning <br>he evades through obfuscatory ramblings. The whole pi business is utter <br>nonsense. Its value can only reside in its aesthetic appeal to musicians who <br>are used to a major third being 1/3 octave. Now, you tell them, it's 1/pi <br>octave. Easily enough understood, and as much mathematics as most musicians <br>would want.<br><br>Despite all this, LucyTuning is about the best tuning around for the <br>existing diatonic, triadic repertoire. Let me try to explain why.<br><br>First, it is a meantone tuning. This means that 5-limit just intonation is <br>approached without any commas to deal with. For anyone who denies the <br>importance of this, take a piece of diatonic, triadic music and try to <br>render it in just intonation. Inevitably, different-sized whole tones, comma <br>shifts during sustained notes, out-of-tune chords, and/or wandering tonics <br>arise. Now in meantone, everything is just as easy as good old 12-equal <br>(unless you start using enharmonic equivalents, since meantone is usually an <br>infinite system with no enharmonic equivalents), but the maximum deviation <br>from JI is reduced by a factor of 3-4.<br><br><br>Now meantone temperaments in general have a fifth from 692-700 cents. <br>LucyTuning is almost exactly 3/10 comma meantone (.3005 comma, to be exact). <br>His perfect fifth is thus flat by 3/10 comma; it is 695.493 cents. Now if <br>you take all 5-limit just intervals and calculate the meantone tuning that <br>minimizes the mean squared error (which is appropriate if you think <br>dissonance is a function whose first derivative is zero and second <br>derivative is positive at just intervals (I do)), you get a perfect fifth of <br>696.165 cents. If you use a weighted mean, with weights inversely <br>proportional to the limit (following Partch who said higher-limit intervals <br>need to be tuned more accurately in proportion to their limit), you get a <br>perfect fifth of 696.019 cents. The optimal tuning for any real musical <br>situation (as long as it is diatonic and triadic) will probably fall <br>somewhere between these two tunings (a very narrow range!).<br><br>Lucy is obviously very close. The 19-equal fifth is 694.737 cents, and the <br>31-equal fifth is 696.774 cents. Lucy is thus doing considerably better than <br>19-equal, and about as well as 31-equal. (50-equal would be almost perfect). <br>It's no wonder that an eminent scholar of days past (John Harrison) <br>advocated the pi-based tuning (LucyTuning). Another eminent scholar of days <br>past, Christiaan Huygens, advocated 31-equal.<br><br>However, with 31-equal you get consistent and very accurate representations <br>through the 11-limit, not just the 5-limit. Although an infinite tuning <br>system like LucyTuning can of course approximate any pitch with any degree <br>of accuarcy, you may need a very large number of notes to get all the <br>harmonies you want. With 31-equal, you never need more than, uh, 31.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 19 Feb 1997 01:43 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11062; Wed, 19 Feb 1997 01:43:10 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11059<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id QAA07886; Tue, 18 Feb 1997 16:41:26 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 18 Feb 1997 16:41:26 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B017AA2A0D3D3.2E94@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
