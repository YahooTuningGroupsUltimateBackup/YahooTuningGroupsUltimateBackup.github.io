Ronald Bruce Smith said that Magnus Lindberg is the only IRCAM<br>>composer that had a knowledge of Forte's theory. Many others composers<br>>(Tristan Murail, Hugues Dufourt, Jean-Yves Bosseur etc....)<br>>perfectly know the Forte's theory, but they don't used in their<br>>own compositions.<br>My point exactly. That is, they *do not* use pitch class theory in their<br>compositions.  Thanks for the reconfirmation<br><br>>Magnus has said (I can't remember where but I have read it)<br>>that he used the pitch set theory in his compositions.<br><br>Magnus often uses a synthesis of techniques derived from spectral theory<br>and pitch class theory.  Nevertheless, he still thinks primarily in terms<br>of harmony and harmonic colour.<br><br>>3. The "objet sonore" is a concept of Pierre Schaeffer and electro-acoustic<br>>music, born in the GRM (Groupe de Recherches Musicales), not really a "friend"<br>>of the IRCAM because they have to deal with the same pie... Messiaen, Dutilleux<br>>and Boulez don't refer to the "objet sonore".<br><br>Certainly, but during my studies with Tristan he refered often to the objet<br>sonore.<br>><br>>4. If IRCAM had opened "les nouveaux espaces", "a rather large and impressive<br>>extension to their building in Beaubourg" said Smith, IRCAM has also<br>>always >beenin crisis. Many people think that IRCAM has imposed his<br>>esthetics in the >french developpement of the music, had marginalized many<br>>other musical >institutions and eat to much money for what they do. Pierre<br>>Boulez had >published an interview in "Telerama" (a TV program paper) last<br>>week on the >musical french life. In reading this paper, you could<br>>understand what kind of >people is Pierre Boulez and understand how IRCAM<br>>had been what it is today.<br><br>Sure, IRCAM has often been a political hot potato. Still, to say, as<br>Mclaren did, that IRCAM has (musically) nearly marginilized *itself* out of<br>existence is not true.<br><br>rbs<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 23:03 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA32663; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 23:05:06 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA32767<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id OAA16384; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 14:05:04 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 9 Sep 1996 14:05:04 -0700<br>Message-Id: <61960909210116/0005695065PK5EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
