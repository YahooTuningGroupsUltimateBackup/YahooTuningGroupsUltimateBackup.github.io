It<br>>has quite a bit less traffic gridlock, for one thing.<br><br>My offer to look into the possibility of a conference here was inspired not<br>so much by a preference for this geographical location as opposed to San<br>Diego or San Francisco, both lovely cities, but for the possibility of<br>institutional support: meeting rooms, lecture halls with computers and a/v<br>equipment, concert halls, a secretary to do mailings and other conference<br>business, brochures, publicity, even (should we want to go that route) a<br>special dinner or something of that sort.<br><br>Some people may have well-grounded suspicions of the drawbacks of academia,<br>but these are some of the pros that a college site can provide. Of course<br>there are alternatives to this model, and I'm open to other people's<br>preferences. But if a conference of this sort in the LA area is still of<br>interest to enough people, I will be happy to continue pursuing the<br>possibility.<br><br>(By the way, my college is not actually in LA, but in Claremont, about 25<br>miles east of downtown.)<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
