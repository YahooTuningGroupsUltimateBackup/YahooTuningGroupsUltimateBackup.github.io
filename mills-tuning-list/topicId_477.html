The Bflat<br>is tuned to 60hz.  As far as I know, the Korg is 48 note polyphonic.<br>During the opening section which LaMonte refers to as "clouds" a great deal<br>of difference tones are produced, thanks to the tuning.  That's probably<br>what you're hearing that's not subject to the attack and release<br><br><br>>The frantic arpeggios seemed to be a means of<br>>projecting the pure, resonant coinciding overtones that resulted from the<br>>pure tuning. I suppose the faster the arpeggios are, the less variation is<br>>heard in the intensity of these overtones, as all the phase-cancellation and<br>>reinforcement would average out, but I was surprised at how the overtones<br>>did not seem to be subject to the attack or inevitable release (how many<br>>notes can the Korg sustain at once? infinity?) of the notes. Anyone know how<br>>LaMonte does it? I think I read that he claimed to have such a fine control<br>>of timing that he could make a certain overtone resonate by repeatedly<br>>striking a key ar keys just at the crest of its cycle. Is this really<br>>humanly possible?<br><br>Good question.  LaMonte's been exploring this terrain for a long time.
