I think<br>the King Crimson album "Thrakattak" has some of that stuff too. What I<br>would love to hear is Fripp & Co. strap on some microtonal axes and try<br>writing some genuine prog-metal riffs with purer as well as smaller<br>intervals -- Fripp is always pushing the boundaries of tonality, so it<br>seems like a logical step . . . I can report that power chords (open<br>fifths with distorition) on the 22-tone guitar sound great despite being<br>7 cents flat, and any three-or-more-note subset of a "dominant ninth"<br>chord (0 7 13 18 26 in 22-tET) sounds really good with distortion, much<br>more reminiscent of Jon Catler's JI guitar than of standard 12-tone . .<br>.</div>
