May 23, 1997<br><br>The fourth and final day of this festival started with Follow the<br>Wrecking Ball, Wish I Thought of it Sooner by Virgil Moorefield. The<br>first half of the piece featured a cello solo and the other had the band<br>pulsating along in a minimalist fashion. I think the piece was in 48 tone<br>equal temperament. World premiere. <br><br>violin - Tom Chiu <br>cello - David Eggar <br>guitar - Woody Pak <br>clarinet and baritone sax - Tim Otto <br>synthesizer - Virgil Moorefield <br><br>Dedicated to the memory of her late father, Mayumi Reinhard's Near By<br>Life was a deeply beautiful elegy. The piece was performed using the<br>rich sounds of a Kurtzweil synthesizer tuned to the Tibetan tuning<br>preset. World premiere. <br><br>synthesizer - Mayumi Reinhard <br><br>The close dissonances of La Ritournelle et le Galop by Pascale Criton<br>were produced by stringing a 24 tone equal temperament guitar with 6<br>low E strings and tuning them 1/16th of a tone apart. The composition<br>started with some close pitches then evolved to a point where the<br>guitarist was sliding a chord up and down the neck while rapidly picking<br>arpeggios and scraping one fingernail across the strings. American<br>premiere. <br><br>96 tone equal temperament guitar - Wim Hoogewerf <br><br>I pretty much missed The Song of Songs - Violin Sonata #3 by Mordecai<br>Sandberg - I needed to take a personal intermission. <br><br>violin - Tom Chiu <br><br>Another major highlight of the festival was the performance of Free<br>Music for 4 Theremin by Percy Grainger. The Theremin is a rarely<br>spotted in public alone, even rarer in groups. For this performance they<br>were arranged so that there was one in each corner. The composition was<br>full of the drastic dynamics and glissandi that this electronic music<br>instrument is capable of. At intermission, I walked around, checked out<br>the various Theremin and I could see that a graphic score was used.<br>World premiere. <br><br>theremins - Lydia Kavina, Eric Ross, Bradford Catler, and Nicholas<br>Brooke <br>conductor - Johnny Reinhard <br><br>Ivan Wyschnegradsky's Chant Nocturne was a real treat. Using two<br>pianos tuned a quarter tone apart and a violin soloist who ventures in to<br>48 tone equal temperament territory, it was a rich exploration of the<br>possibilities of this kind of tuning. <br><br>violin - Tom Chiu <br>24ET pianos - Joshua Pierce and Dorothy Jonas<br>                                                          <br><br>Kyle Gann's How Miraculous Things Happen used a 23 note 11 limit<br>just intonation tuning. This new work is a bit different the Conlon<br>Nancarrow influenced work I heard at Experimental Intermedia in<br>December '95. Gone are rhythmic ratios, now replaced with a more<br>minimal approach. When is someone going to release all this on a cd?<br>World premiere. <br><br>synthesizer - Kyle Gann <br><br>The collective improvisation More.Meat.For.Apes was performed by<br>Harvard Project4NewMusic. Here's how the work started: One person<br>hit a metal sculpture while another tossed objects into metal containers.<br>Pretty metal sounds. Then the joined two other performers sitting cross<br>legged on the floor where they played portable cd players. What kind of<br>material was on the cd's isn't really clear, it could have been other<br>people's work (like John Cage's Imaginary Landscape series) or<br>previously prepared CD-R material. What the audience heard was a nice<br>post-industral, dark ambient din. The improvisation ended when one of<br>the performers got up and started a series of boxes lined along the edge<br>of the stage. World premiere. <br><br>Harvard Project4NewMusic: <br>Fleur de Vie Weinstock, Alice Liu, Kyle Lapidus, Ron Rosennian, Luke<br>Fischbec, and Sasha Costanza-Chock <br><br>To end this marathon evening and the MicroMay '97 fest was the Catler<br>Bros. performing two pieces from their Crash Landing cd. Jon Catler's<br>Spiritual Brother is a slow modal rocker with lots of room for him to<br>stretch out and improvise. Most musicians would cut loose and play lots<br>of notes over the slow groove, but here he took his time and made every<br>note count. In fact, at this point, Miles Davis would have been playing<br>too much compared to Catler. <br><br>In contrast, Free by Ornette Coleman was a chance for the band to go<br>wild. After the zany Coleman head, drummer Kane started tapping the<br>idiomatically correct ride cymbal and Brad Catler walked the bass while<br>Jon ripped on the guitar, slipping, sliding, playing lots of notes and rock<br>'n roll feedback. <br><br>just intonation guitar - Jon Catler <br>fretless bass - Bradford Catler <br>drums - Jonathan Kane <br><br>My picks: Near By Life, La Ritournelle et le Galop, How Miraculous<br>Things Happen and of course, the Catler Bros. <br><br>See you at the next microfest! <br><br>db <br>5/30/97 <br><br>Information about the American Festival of Microtonal Music:<br>http://www.echonyc.com/~jhhl/AFMM/ <br><br><br>D a v i d   B e a r d s l e y .. dmb5561719@aol.com <br>      *            ..    *    ... .*             ....     *......   .<br>            ..*    I M M P  &  B i i n k!   m  u  s  i  c<br>. ..    *             ..                 ..           * ..             <br>J u x t a p o s i t i o n Ezine    *          . ..        *<br> . .*.. .           .. .     .    .*.   . . .     . ..       ..<br>      http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm<br>  . ..         .*..            . .. .           ..*.     .    ..   . *. <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 31 May 1997 10:46 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05445; Sat, 31 May 1997 10:46:35 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 31 May 1997 10:46:35 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05444<br>Received: (qmail 11073 invoked from network); 31 May 1997 08:45:29 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 31 May 1997 08:45:29 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.93.970531163201.6106A-100000@extro.ucc.su.OZ.AU><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
