My (current) <br>itinerary in the USA is New York, Boston, Chicago, Madison, SF, LA, <br>and San Diego, and Lafayette (Louisiana) (not necessarily in that <br>exact order). This will run from about 5th October to early <br>November. <br><br>In Europe the trip will take in various cities in France, Germany <br>and Holland - and I am still trying to establish further <br>contacts.  This will be mid November to mid December.  <br><br>The purpose of the trip is to discuss new ideas for acoustic <br>instruments with instrument makers and manufacturers;  and to discuss <br>whether contemporary musicians support the idea that the 'classical <br>instrumentarium' would benefit from new acoustic (or adapted versions <br>etc) as well as new electronic instruments.  It would seem that if <br>there is adquate consensus on this then there would be considerable <br>value in establishing a 'network' of interested contributors in <br>various different fields - and a 'Centre' or group of centres to <br>co-ordinate research and development. <br><br>Unfortunately my plans for this trip are running very much behind<br>schedule, partly due to the difficulties of writing the paper while <br>doing a full-time job, partly due to family problems.  (For a long <br>time I thought I would have to cancel the trip and abandon the <br>grant...) <br><br>I would enjoy meeting as many people on the trip as possible - from <br>each of the areas listed (composers, performers, instrument makers <br>etc).  Even at this late stage, I would still be very grateful if any <br>of you can me in touch with open minded acoustic instsument makers <br>and others who might be interested - especially in Europe, where I <br>have had less luck in making a large number of constructive contacts. <br> (Due to time limits - email addresses and telephone numbers, where <br>possible, would be extremely helpful: they will be treated in <br>complete confidence). <br><br>I am hoping to create as soon as possible the simplest webpage <br>so the discussion paper can be downloaded easily, and everyone can <br>have alook at it.  <br><br>20 hardcopies of the paper are due to be printed tomorrow, and I will <br>mail these to folks who have been especially helpful over the last <br>year.  Unfortunately I cannot send free hardcopies to everyone <br>because of the cost.  However, I will certainly create bound <br>hardcopies on request for anyone who wants one, if they will <br>contribute something toward the cost of printing, binding and <br>postage.   The text is about 180 pages including appendices;  each <br>copy currently costs about 9-12 pounds sterling to produce and send <br>(depending where you are).   I'm trying to find ways of reducing the <br>cost, and will be mailing reduced versions of the text to individuals <br>at various universities and research  institutues in the hope of <br>generating general interest.     <br><br>Please note that the 'tuning theory' element of the paper is <br>introductory;   similarly, the paper does not go into the real <br>nitty-gritty of acoustics.  I am a composer (and pianist), not a <br>tuning theorist, instrument maker, or acoustician.  I have written <br>the paper from a 'generalist's' viewpoint in the hope of interesting <br>a broader audience in the subject of alternative tunings.  It is also <br>written from the point of view that the instruments of the orchestra <br>(obviously not their technique) have more or less ossified since the <br>late 1800's, and from the position that electronic musical <br>instruments are unlikely to 'replace' acoustic instruments in the <br>near future.   Therefore, it would seem that there would be much <br>value in directing a proportion of public funding for musical <br>instrument research toward acoustic as well as electronic research <br>domain.  (Well, it's not quite a simple as that, of course...)<br><br>The major theme of the paper is the implications of alternative <br>tuning systems (ATS) for future acoustic instrumental innovation.<br><br>If it you would like to meet me on the trip, or can suggest others to <br>meet, instruments to view, concerts to go to, institutes at which <br>to present a seminar, museums holding instruments of special <br>interest.... I would be very grateful if you would contact me as soon <br>as possible. Please respond to: <br><br>******** pol@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk ***********<br><br>(NOT the address I am writing from). <br><br>I should also mention that London Guildhall University has <br>expressed interest in hosting the project in a  'Centre for New <br>Musical Instruments'.   This is very preliminary, and little <br>as yet has happened in this respect.<br><br>My sincere thanks go to all those on the list who have helped, <br>cajoled, and criticised.....  Your help, and the daily reminder that <br>there are many on this list who know much more than I about many <br>aspects of these subjects...  has helped to focus the paper <br>considerably. <br><br>Patrick Ozzard-Low, Alternative Tuning Projects, UK<br>pol@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk <br>Tel: (44) - 01603 - 614380<br><br>Last thought: if it would be at all useful to send small portions <br>of the paper to the list - say on a weekly basis... please let me <br>know.  I certainly don't want to flood the list with what is <br>merely one aspect of this vast subject.  My plan to create a forum <br>specifically about new _instruments_  for ATS is as yet still in <br>abeyance...</div><h3><a id=8412 href="#8412">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.
