I need to mention two things about the survey<br>though:<br><br>   First of all, I suspect that there will be a tendency of musicians on the<br>list to respond more vigorously than theoreticians, because several people have<br>called the musicality of list into question.  So let me say that there's nothing<br>wrong at all with being a theoretician.  Theoreticians formulate new basic ideas<br>for performers and composers to make musical sense of.  That's important and<br>valuable, so let me encourage theoreticians and musicians alike to respond<br>equally vigorously.  <br><br>   Second, I think I really must amend the first question by putting some<br>stipulations on the response "musician".  In particular, please don't respond<br>with "musician" unless your involvement in music includes some form of<br>performance, composition, or improvisation.  <br><br>   By no means am I suggesting that appreciation, analysis, or literary writing<br>and publishing about music, are not valuable to musicianship.  They certainly<br>are, but I just want to narrow down a bit the field of that particular response.<br><br><br>   If you have already responded and wish to change your answer to that<br>question, then please be sure to tell me that point out that it's a change.  I'm<br>only keeping raw numbers, so I need to be able to distinguish a change of vote<br>from a new, additional vote.  <br><br>   Thanks y'all!<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 7 Sep 1996 21:33 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA27042; Sat, 7 Sep 1996 21:34:44 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA27257<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA27179; Sat, 7 Sep 1996 12:34:42 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 7 Sep 1996 12:34:42 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960907192919_71670.2576_HHB60-17@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
