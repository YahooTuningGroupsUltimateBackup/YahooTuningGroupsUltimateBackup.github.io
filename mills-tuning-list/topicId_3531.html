Whatever it is, you seem to feel it's big<br>>enough to cause problems in ET's over 35/oct.<br><br>Well, the only real problem in ET's over 34/oct is that consistency is<br>not really relevant anymore, since there might be an adequate<br>approximation for a given interval which is not the closest<br>approximation. My paper, for the sake of brevity, sticks with the simple<br>ETs, with at most one decent approximation to each just interval. There<br>may be some wonderful scales in 41tET for all I know.<br><br>>And then there's the matter<br>>of the thing being based on pure tones.  What about tones with partials?<br><br>Good point -- the answer is something that somehow slipped out of the<br>latest version of my paper, but was there before. Sorry! Basically, the<br>0.6%-1.2% deals with a certain optimal frequency range. In other ranges,<br>the discrimination was much more coarse. From the original version og<br>the paper (1994): "Musical tones normally have uypper partials within<br>this range, and since harmonic partials are integer multiples of their<br>fundamentals, they will yield the same ratio-interpretation for their<br>fundamentals as would the fundamentals transposed into this range.<br>(This is why we did not worry about overtones in the first place)."<br>Carl, perhaps you could do me a favor and stick something like this into<br>the .pdf version of my paper? You have already helped make it more clear<br>than the version that's going to be in Xenharmonikon 17 (Hey John<br>Chalmers, how's it going?).<br><br>>Okay.  Gary, representing the prime-number advocates (of which, I will be<br>>sure to add, he is not necessarily one), said that steely coldness was<br>>often considered to be related to the FACTOR of 3.  You start out by saying<br>>"an arbitrary power of 2 produces an effect of equivalence",<br><br>I put that phrase in quotes because I wasn't the one who said it!<br><br>>and then<br>>finish up asking if a power of 3 can produce steely coldness.  But it is a<br>>factor of three that is supposed to produce steely coldness.<br><br>No, according to Gary, a factor of 3 will only produce steely coldness<br>if there are no higher prime factors in the ratio. Powers of 3 are<br>candidates, since they only have factors of 3.<br><br>>Any change in power (stacking the interval two, or however many times) is<br>>supposed to produce equivalence, falling off as stacking brings the<br>>compound interval close in size to an interval with different prime factors<br><br>This equivalence, if it exists at all (I don't think it does), is<br>clearly of a different kind than that produced by factors of two, and<br>the latter is what Dave Hill was initially referring to at the beginning<br>of this whole discussion. Gary tried to argue that it may just be a<br>special case of the former, but the fact that different intervals of<br>arbitrarily high prime limit can be similar to one another due to<br>differing only by a factor of 2, shows that this equivalence is of a<br>very different sort.<br><br>>Don't I use this idea when talking about music evolving by prime limit?<br>>Not really.  Because you will NEVER hear a higher prime being used<br>>harmonically in the earlier style.  It's not a question of what they<br>>considered it because they *didn't* consider it.<br><br>I think the fact that the tritone in major nearly forms a 4:5:6:7 with<br>the dominant, and that the tritones in minor nearly form an<br>8:10:12:14:17 with the dominant, were not inconsequential for the<br>development of tonal harmony. (Unfortunately, in my decatonic scales in<br>22tET, the characteristic dissonances (analogues to the tritone) fail to<br>approximate higher harmonics over any consonant chord in the scale).<br><br>When I play diatonic music in 26tET, something interesting happens.<br>Instead of the tritone in the major mode sounding like the 5th and 7th<br>harmonics of the dominant, it sounds like the 8th and 11th harmonics of<br>the subdominant. In some ways, in the major mode in 26tET, the<br>subdominant functions as the dominant.<br><br>>Sort of like you could tell what prime limit music on a 33 is, playing at<br>>45 rpms, but not what odd limit the same music was without hearing it at<br>>actual speed?<br><br>See, I have no problem with this, since the melodic and harmonic<br>vocabularies both figure into the pitch sets that are heard, and the<br>pitch set determines the character of the music to a large extent. I<br>already stated where I think the odd-limit concept is useful.<br><br>>The 12-tone 5/4 is treated as a consonance.  I wonder what Mr. Erlich<br>>thinks about this, since it very close both in size and derrivation to the<br>>81/64.<br><br>I think Partch was right that an interval's allowance for mistuning, as<br>regards the interval's ability to be recognized as the just ratio, is<br>inversely proportional to the ODD limit. 81/64, if recognizable at all<br>(I don't think so), has an EXTREMELY small allowance for mistuning.<br><br>>He doesn't seem to have a problem considering a 7 cent sharp 3/2<br>>consonant! <br>>This 3/2, to my ear, makes the triads of 22 no better than those of 12,<br>>despite the better third.<br><br>Most people who have made the comparison (including me) consider 19tET,<br>whose 3/2 is 7.5 cents flat, to have better triads than 12tET. Do you<br>disagree?<br><br>>Even if the "association of certain intervals with the tuning systems in<br>>which they occur" (that is, I asume, some sort of cultural conditioning) is<br>>the only way we can pick prime factors apart from odd ones in music, are we<br>>not still performing a prime factorization on what we hear?<br><br>I guess I would have to concur in that case.</div>
