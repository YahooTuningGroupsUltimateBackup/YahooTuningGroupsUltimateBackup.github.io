If you listen to blues, which is at the root of much <br>contemporary pop, there's micronotes galore because of the bending and <br>stretching that constantly goes on. As soon as one bends a note, we're <br>off the pitch of the scale, and somewhere else. As to the related subject <br>of is this then microtonal music per se, my personal feeling is that if <br>the bending and stretching occurs over a base scale of an instrument <br>tuned in 12 eq, then I don't feel like calling it microtonal, overall, <br>because 12 eq is our home base, and any notes which are not bent are <br>still in 12. Of course, this is a rather subjective perception, and maybe <br>there's no right answer, just gut intuitions...Hstick</div>
