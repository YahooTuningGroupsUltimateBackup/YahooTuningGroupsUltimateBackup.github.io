He wanted vividness. He wanted intoxication.<br>His one-man dispute with Western culture was rooted in a<br>dismissal of anything learned or abstract. He looked to the<br>musical cultures of ancient China and Greece, in which sound,<br>display, word and gesture were welded and magically potent.<br>He spoke of the "emotional saturation, or transcendence,<br>that it is the particular province of dramatic music to achieve."<br>He was a hobo Antonin Artaud.<br><br>  But if Thursday night's performance of his "Oedipus" failed<br>to live up to his ideals, the faults were at least as much in<br>the piece as in the mildness and rehearsal quality of the<br>theatrical presentation at the Metropolitan Museum. Quite<br>simply, there isn't much music in this score. Partch insisted<br>on one thing at a time (this was another quarrel he had with<br>the Western musical tradition) and he largely avoided having<br>his singer-actors accompanied by instrumental music of any<br>great elaboration.<br><br>  Much of his "Oedipus" consists of declamation, whether<br>spoken or chanted, with chimes, stationary backgrounds<br>and cadences. Only toward the end, when we come to Jocasta's<br>suicide and Oedipus's self-blinding, does the array of specially<br>built instruments begin to wake up. At this point on Thursday<br>one could begin to feel the heartbeat Partch was looking for,<br>as an embracing percussion ostinato was joined by a shrill,<br>trilling clarinet in mounting exhilaration.<br><br>  Partch was obliged to make his own instruments because he<br>needed a new tuning system, more on course with natural vibration.<br>But he turned necessity into opportunity and created things as<br>beautiful as their names: cloud chamber bowls, made from Pyrex<br>carboys, or marimba eroica, with huge wooden slabs and<br>resonators. He wanted his shows to look good, with his<br>instruments set around the stage, though unfortunately in<br>the cramped space at the museum they all had to be<br>bunched together.<br><br>  Still, opportunities to experience the Partch instrumentarium<br>are rare, and it was excellent to be hearing live the authentic<br>sonorities of the composer's aged recordings: the reed-organ<br>wheezes, the deep-bass thumps, the arpeggios from the<br>zitherlike harmonic canon that sound like cast jewels. Dean<br>Drummond, whose ensemble, Newband, has the care of the<br>Partch instruments, was conducting a group of professional<br>and student musicians.<br><br>  Among the vocal performers, Joe Garcia commandingly<br>brought before us an Oedipus speaking out of a snarl of<br>contempt. Gregory Sims, a vital actor, made Creon's part<br>passionately important, and Robert Osborne, as Tiresias,<br>was able to convey the special qualities of Partchian<br>incantation, which often seems to imitate the sick drone of<br>someone on illicit substances.<br><br>Copyright 1997 The New York Times<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 26 Apr 1997 18:46 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA31483; Sat, 26 Apr 1997 18:46:28 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA31515<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id JAA15106; Sat, 26 Apr 1997 09:44:26 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 26 Apr 1997 09:44:26 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199704261641.AA17307@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
