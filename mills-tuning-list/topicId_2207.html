The way I larnt it, a simple C major triad in root position consists<br>of a minor third stacked on top of a major third.  In first inversion, it<br>consists of a perfect fourth stacked on top of the minor third.  In second<br>inversion it's that perfect fourth with the major third stacked above it.<br> From what perspective are those the same set of intervals?<br><br>> ... However, if you disallow octave<br>>equivalence of intervals, and you define harmony in terms of intervals,<br>>you must also reject the octave equivalence of harmony.  Inversional<br>>invariance follows from octave invariance, unless you have a<br>>privileged root to lift the otonal/utonal degeneracy.<br><br>I don't quite follow all that, especially the "privileged root" part, with<br>which concept I am unfamiliar.  Could you give an example?<br><br>> ... none of this<br>>implies that octave transpositions are harmonically negligible.  Many<br>>people state this, and I believe it to be a result of sloppy thinking.<br><br>To my great surprise, I am increasingly inclined to agree with you on that.<br> After all, orchestrators and arrangers have known the importance of<br>appropriate "voicing," or spacing of intervals across octaves, for about as<br>long as there has been 4-part harmony.<br><br>David J.
