However, it is my sacred duty to hereby respond<br>to a part of Brian McLaren's post in digest 910.  <br><br>I apologize in advance for the length, but I feel compelled to back up what<br>I now state. Brian said:<br><br>>Well, as it happens Partch was also an<br>>inveterate improviser.  I'm very surprised<br>>that no one seems to realize this.  Improvisation<br>>was an integral element of Partch's small-<br>>ensemble composition process.  (By small<br>>ensemble, I mean the compositions which<br>>did *NOT* demand staging and libretti;<br>>in short *NOT* the late large theater works.)<br>>We know for a fact (as has been reported on<br>>this forum) that Partch improvised the vocal<br>>lines in the Li Po songs and then wrote them<br>>down to give performers something to go by.<br>>We know for a fact (because Partch tells us so)<br>>that "And On the Seventh Day Petals Fell In<br>>Petaluma..." was improvised using two<br>>tape recorders. First Partch performed an<br>>improv he had polished and recorded it on<br>>one tape recorder, then Partch listened<br>>and performed an accompanying improvised<br>>part along with the recorded part, the<br>>result being recorded on the second Ampex<br>>recorder.<br>>Afterwards he wrote out the score, making<br>>changes after the fact and re-recording them<br>>so that overlaid duets would work as quartets.<br>>Clearly Partch's score for "Petals" represents<br>>the usual backtracking and transcription of<br>> performance so beloved of 20th century<br>>composers.<br><br>I will state this as plainly as I can, so that people new to the list or<br>unfamiliar with Partch's work will not be confused:<br><br>THE PREVIOUSLY QUOTED SECTION IS A MIXTURE OF CONJECTURE, TOTAL INACCURACY<br>AND FABRICATION; IT IS COMPLETELY INCORRECT.<br><br>Clear?  As to Partch's early works, although many works did go through a<br>number of revisions, virtually all of this can be seen in the category of a<br>'work in progress', especially in light of the fact that Partch was still<br>developing/grappling with devising a notational method (for very good<br>examples of the different notational systems used for the Li Po settings,<br>see Thomas McGeary's excellent "The Music of Harry Partch", complete with<br>four excerpts and descriptions of the six versions).  As to "improvising"<br>the vocal lines, yes, in as much as someone who is working on a song; the<br>notation was for performance and a 'fixed' setting of the work, which could<br>be referred back to.  They were *not* improvisations.  And if anyone would<br>draw the above conclusions by comparing any of the notated versions with<br>the existing recordings of Partch performing them, then I would simply tell<br>you that while Harry was not the most consistent of singers, he was a<br>performer who felt the freedom of the moment in terms of interpretation.  I<br>can attest to this by virtue of having listened, over the years, to many<br>tapes in the HP archives of Harry that are not available to all, including<br>'out-takes' and alternate versions.<br><br>More to the point, his statement regarding "We know for a fact (because<br>Partch tells us so) that "And On the Seventh Day Petals Fell In<br>Petaluma..." was improvised using two tape recorders." is an utter<br>fabrication.  Nowhere (that I am aware of) does Partch say this.  Harry<br>Partch, according to Danlee Mitchell, who was present during the time of<br>"Petals" composition and both recordings (Petaluma/Gualala and Venice, CA)<br>said that when Partch would work on his composing, he would work at the<br>instruments (to the exclusion of mundanities such as shopping, daily<br>chores, etc.) and work out parts and fragments by playing them.  He would,<br>as he developed the material, notate the passages in pencil on manuscript<br>paper, developing the score as the composition progressed; some sections<br>where composed away from the instruments as well.  He did *not* tape record<br>improvisations and later transcribe them.  As he progressed he would ask<br>others to learn parts to play them together and see if it was working, if<br>other players were available to help.<br><br>Anyone who knows "Petals" knows that there are a few parts that ARE<br>improvised (the crychord and drone devil parts, for example), but these are<br>small, auxiliary parts.  In sum total, "Petals" is a composition that,<br>while aided by Harry working at the instruments, was a fully composed<br>creation and not a re-creation of noodling or improvisation of any sort.<br>He was interested in creating more challenging instrumental parts, rhythms<br>and textures (to more fully exploit the expressive characteristics of the<br>ensemble) *but also* wanted to know that they *were* playable - if *he*<br>could, he could expect others to!<br><br>The end sections that he devised so that succeeding duets/trios could be<br>combined into quartets/quintets/sextets where conceived of without true<br>knowledge as to what the results would be, and they (Partch, Danlee<br>Mitchell, Michael Ranta, C. C. Spiller and others) grappled with the (then)<br>clunky technology of tape synchronization to make the larger groupings a<br>reality.  It is also important to realize that, no matter how much fun it<br>is to listen to "Petals" (or play it, I assure you...), the piece existed<br>as a 'sketchbook' for the (then) upcoming very large (indeed, imposing)<br>theater drama "Delusion of the Fury".  Virtually every lick and phrase<br>contained as an abstract exercise in "Petals" will find a place and (as<br>Harry put it) "become the musical sinews of a larger concept, a full-blown<br>integration - 'Delusion of the Fury'". [Delusion is discussed in "Bitter<br>Music", Petals and it's creation in "Genesis of a Music, 2nd ed. (also<br>another article noted there, as well)]<br><br>Harry Partch was NOT an "inveterate improviser", and improvisation was NOT<br>an "integral" part of his compositional modus, in the small-group works or<br>otherwise.  Period.  Finally:<br><br>>Partch used the same technique with more<br>>layers (re-re-recording) for "Daphne of the<br>>Dunes" and "WindSong."<br>>It surprises me that no one realizes how<br>>integral both magnetic tape and improvisation<br>>were to Partch's compositional process.  In<br>>fact, this process is essentially identical to<br>>some of our work in the Southern California MIcrotonal<br>>Group.<br><br>"Daphne" and "Windsong" are essentially two version of the same piece:<br>"Windsong" being a score to accompany Madeline Tourtelot's film of the same<br>name.  Partch overdubbed the parts himself, mainly because no one else was<br>around at the time to help. Also, the soundtrack was heavily edited in the<br>'razor-blade-and-splice' mode.  In doing so, he discovered that he could<br>have parts played at double or half speed and found enough interesting<br>effects to use in the piece.  In all his life, he used taped sections in<br>pieces *twice*: about 3 or four minutes worth in "Windsong" (dispersed<br>throughout the piece), and a short segment in "Revelation in the Courthouse<br>Park" (a recording of the Cloud-Chamber bowls played at half-speed to put<br>them in a lower octave).  That's it. And no coat-tails to ride on here,<br>either <g>. <br><br>No wonder Brian is surprised: what he reports doesn't exist.<br><br>***************<br><br>To close, something related that bothered me in digest 912 from William<br>Sethares:<br><br>>I am not so happy with attacks based on casual emails.<br>>I do not believe that people need to stand behind<br>>every word they write in email, any more than<br>>they need to stand behind every casual comment<br>>in a phone conversation.<br><br>This list goes to roughly 325 people daily, many of whom I have found are<br>quite well-known and influential in the microtonal society, in addition to<br>all those who read the list for general interest.  If Brian (or anyone<br>else) wants to email me with information that ends up being in need of<br>correction, I can respond to him as I would on the phone (to use Bill's<br>analogy).  However, this is a *very* public forum, and (here's *my*<br>fabrication) Brian McLaren breaks in material here before publishing it (as<br>he did in the recent British Harry Partch Society newsletter), still full<br>of quotations, postulations, inaccuracies and nonsense.<br><br>In a public debate, if you are posting for informational purposes it had<br>better be provable unless it is ongoing research or stated opinion.<br>Besides, Bill: why not defend what you believe in, unless it just doesn't<br>mean anything to you?  There aren't very many sources for the kind of<br>material we deal in here, and there is no reason to not do a little<br>'self-regulating' for the benefit of those who rely upon the list as a<br>resource. <br><br>I do post 'casually' sometimes, as do others, but using this forum as a<br>substitute for some kind of ongoing "Intonational Journal" invites readers<br>to hold an author responsible for what they put in 'print'.  It is a<br>(fairly) new age and the old rules don't apply.<br><br>Private email: fine, whatever.  Put it here: back it up.  I won't<br>countenance ignorance of the facts.<br><br>Other than that, it's been a fine week <g>!<br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br>*------------------------------------------------------------------*<br> Jonathan M.
