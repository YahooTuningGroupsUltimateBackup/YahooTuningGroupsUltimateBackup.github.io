Two things:<br><br>1. I don't know the law on putting other people's stuff on my page, but I <br>sure would like to put some Partch, Darreg, etc. there. Does anyone on <br>the list know the law on these matters?<br><br>2. I would like to put samples of the music of tuning forum members on my <br>page, so if any of you have some microtonal music you would like to post <br>there, please send it along and I will! First preference will go to <br>ra and .wav files since they are easiest, followed by CDs and audio <br>tapes. I do not have facilities for converting DATs. You can email me <br>with attached files, or send media to <br><br>John Starrett<br>3500 Clay St.<br>Denver, CO<br>80211<br><br>I will keep it up until the system administrator slaps me for hogging the <br>hard drive.<br><br>John Starrett<br>http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</div><h3><a id=7546 href="#7546">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>4/24/1998 5:10:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Play ANY music fast enough and I suppose the errors become negligible.<br><br>   I personally agree that the "clean" feeling of JI is best appreciated<br>with long, sustained chords.  But even still, I personally have found that<br>you don't have to hear given harmonies in long sustained tones to notice<br>their tuning character.  Even if you play them each for a short duration,<br>you can perceive a cummulative character to them provided that you play<br>enough of those short chords.</div><h3><a id=7553 href="#7553">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>4/26/1998 10:32:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>For three notes, the average=0Aabsolute values for the devia=<br>>tions of the average partial frequencies from n=0Atimes the average =93gl=<br>>obal=94 frequency were: 0.44, 1.04, and 0.48 cents.<br><br>   Thanks Dave, for the details on your results.<br><br>   Do you have any way of characterizing your process' margin of error?<br>That is, could these sounds be absolutely exactly harmonic (short of noise<br>components and human/random fluctuations in the entire tone of course), and<br>your process could only detect their pitch within that accuracy (that of<br>course being quite impressive accuracy)?  Or is it more likely, in your<br>view, that these pitch deviations from exact harmonic frequencies are very<br>definitely present in the overtone structures of the tones?</div><h3><a id=7557 href="#7557">ðŸ”—</a>Ascend11 &#x3C;Ascend11@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/1998 10:20:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>=09I recently joined the tuning forum and have followed the recent discus=<br>sion=0Aabout tuning resolution with interest.

For three notes, the average=0Aabsolute values for the devia=<br>tions of the average partial frequencies from n=0Atimes the average =93gl=<br>obal=94 frequency were: 0.44, 1.04, and 0.48 cents.

For a trombone f3 sound, the average absolute=<br>=0Avalue of the deviation of a partial=92s average frequency from n times=<br> the=0Asound=92s global frequency was .48 cents (first 20 partials).<br><br>=09The averages of the instantaneous deviations of the frequencies of par=<br>tials=0Afrom n times the global frequency over a set of time points space=<br>d a=0Amillisecond apart over the duration of the sounds appeared to be co=<br>nsiderably=0Agreater than this.<br><br>=09In the case of a flute d4 note a little under a second in duration, th=<br>e=0Adeviations in the average partial frequencies from n times the global=<br>=0Afrequency of the sound amounted to 4.55 cents, roughly ten times great=<br>er than=0Athese deviations were for the sung notes and the trombone note.<br><br>=09I analyzed a piano a2 sound of roughly 2 seconds=92 duration and here =<br>will give=0Athe cent deviations of the average partial frequencies from n=<br> times the=0Aaverage global frequency over the early portion of the sound=<br> just after the=0Apeak of the attack for the first 20 partials:  Partial =<br>1: -11.4 cents; par. 2:=0A-6.7 cents; par. 3: -7.3; par. 4: -6.7; par. 5:=<br> -6.5; par. 6: -5.8; par. 7:=0A-4.8; par. 8: -3.5; par. 9: -1.1; par. 10:=<br> +1.0; par. 11: +5.1; par. 12: +5.0;=0Apar. 13: +7.9; par. 14: 10.4; par.=<br> 15: +8.9; par. 16: +16.9; par. 17: +20.1;=0Apar. 18: +23.0; par. 19: +24=<br>6; par. 20: +29.1.
