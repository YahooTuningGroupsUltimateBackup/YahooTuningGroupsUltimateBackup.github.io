Are you seriously suggesting that the melodic difference limen<br>>is the single most important aspect in choice of tuning? I can think of<br>>three counterarguments...<br>>(1) Melody is only one aspect of musical performance...<br>>(2) Even within melody, intonation is very variable among instrumentalists...<br>>(3) Even if we grant the melodic difference limen at 1/3 tone, this<br>>says nothing about 19-tet per octave (or per stretched pseudo-octave<br>>as you prefer)...<br><br>   And I'll add to that,<br>(4) Melodic passages involving intervals smaller than 60 cents are clearly<br>    musically meaningful.  I'm quite confident that NOBODY will perceive the<br>    chromatic run of quartertones C C+ C# Dd D as a subtle "shading" of<br>    C C C# C# D.  The fact that C C+ C# Dd D is a continuous rise in pitch,<br>    whereas C C C# C# D is a sequence of two repeated pitches followed by a<br>    third, is a more audible effect.  Repetition is almost certainly a much<br>    more basic psychoacoustic consideration than this melodic limen you're<br>    proposing.<br><br>   Or similarly, even if a melody doesn't use step sizes smaller than 60<br>cents, if it is taken from a scale that is nothing at all like a diatonic<br>scale, 9TET for example, then it can't possibly be viewed as a subtle<br>variation on a diatonic melody.  It is clearly systematically different at<br>its very roots.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Re: Re G.
