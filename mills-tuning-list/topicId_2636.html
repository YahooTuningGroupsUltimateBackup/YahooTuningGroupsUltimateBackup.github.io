Yes, this is a challenge on the<br>bassoon.  If the instrument can already play microtonally (like the<br>bassoon) it wouldn't help, but hinder its fluid playing to be anymore like<br>the Batman's auxillary belt.<br><br>I believe there should be enough evidence in Prague for the quartertone<br>clarinets that the Czechs use for their annual performances of Haba's<br>_Matka_.  I've know many clarinetists that have mastered various tunings,<br>though each focuses on different intonational terrain.<br><br>The oboe does not have much room for extra keys and extra keys will make<br>instruments much heavier, besides.  There is a fellow in California that<br>developed "Fenchaphones" which are like soprano saxophones (with their<br>respective sizes) that had shiftable tone holes.  Washers on the tone<br>holes could be manipulated to slide in set grooves allowing different<br>tunings, including 19ET, and others.<br><br>I guess the exploration of the standard instruments needs to be through<br>before I would recommend changing their physical form.
