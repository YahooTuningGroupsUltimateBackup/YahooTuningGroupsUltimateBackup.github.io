"Rootedness" I find to be extremely problematic musically, in the<br>same way that the Fuxian bass line is simply more convincing musically than<br>the Rameau basse generale (why is it that all of those dead, white male<br>composers read Fux and ignored Rameau?). The idea of hearing a single chord<br>outside of its contrapuntal (voice-leading) context is strikingly <br>_unmusical_.<br><br>(2) I assume that combination tones will have significantly lower<br>amplitudes than the instrumental tones played. (By the way, I would be<br>interested in learning how one can calculate the amplitudes of combination<br>tones if anyone knows). Thus, only pitch complexes constructed from (lower)<br>harmonic series members will be significantly affected by masking, such<br>that difficulties in discerning individual tones from the entire complex<br>occur. (Anyone who has ever tried to dictate ensemble musics has<br>experienced the masking problem).<br><br>(3) I assume that pitch information is mentally processed as frequency<br>rather than wave length (the ear functioning like a AD transformer): I may<br>of course be entirely wrong about this, but it is a reasonable assumption.<br>(An intutionist approach will takes temporal perception over spatial as the<br>basis of the initial construction (cf Brouwer _Cambridge Lectures_); the<br>spatial interpretations only follow.) The classical harmonics approach does<br>not contradict this, as the first visual observation was of different<br>strings (of different tension or thickness) moving faster and slower and<br>yielding different pitches (this is immediately observable in gut or wire<br>strings throughout the frequency ranges presumably used in ancient music),<br>and then the compared lengths of a single string were then used to quantify<br>this observation. Oscillatory periods and wave lengths are not observable<br>as such without special apparati (this is not completely true, but the<br>perception of wave lengths as physical distances depends on instrumentation<br>and conditions generally outside of contemporary concert music and well<br>outside of the ancient setting).   <br><br>(3a) This is a weak argument, but I give it anyways: why is it that<br>microtonal music theorist structure their discourse almost universally in<br>terms of frequency ratios and not stringlengths, wavelengths, or periods?<br>Either this is just a convention (which I doubt because each individual<br>theorist seems to like building from first principles), or there is indeed<br>an intuitive quality to frequency ratios not shared by _alternative_<br>descriptions. <br><br>(4) Indeed, classical harmonics had no definitive _musical_ preference for<br>subharmonic or harmonic divisions, and their results gave stringlength<br>measurements for scales constructed in both ways (with preference for the<br>least cumbersome numerically, and possibly using the physical _boundary_<br>problem of not being able in practice to divide the string into many parts<br>as a determinant of their preference), the issue being the prefered<br>intonation of those (melodic) scales, not their analysis as harmonic<br>complexes. _Mathematically_, however, the arithmetic divisions (subhamonic)<br>were recognized as closed segments of the harmonic division; each<br>individual arithmetic division yielded a finite number of pitches and was<br>exhausted, while the harmonic division was continuable indefinitely. In<br>this sense (a kind of set theory), the subharmonic divisions were<br>considered inferior to the harmonic. The issues we are dealing with -<br>comparing different pitch complexes - are outside of the narrow framework<br>of classical harmonics, but I see no contradiction between mine and the<br>classical approach.<br><br>(5) I haven4t a degree in physics but I do recognize that the region<br>between the smallest particle (10^-33 or so) and the vacuum (null) is not<br>precisely mirrored by its inversion.<br><br>Daniel Wolf<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 4 Oct 1996 11:37 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01908; Fri, 4 Oct 1996 10:38:32 +0100<br>Received: from sun4nl.NL.net by ns (smtpxd); id XA01906<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by sun4nl.NL.net (5.65b/NLnet-3.4)<br>	id AA18943; Fri, 4 Oct 1996 09:55:44 +0200<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id AAA21355; Fri, 4 Oct 1996 00:54:22 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 4 Oct 1996 00:54:22 -0700<br>Message-Id: <9610040753.AA08057@arthaud.saclay.cea.fr><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
