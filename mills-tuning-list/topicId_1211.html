Hence the <br>"resolution" of interest is where both voices move. The Mixolydian and <br>Dorian modes are common in jazz, where the tritone blends with the tonic <br>triad to form approximate 7-limit tetrads (often with added notes). The <br>behavior of the tritone here is more "static" as opposed to its "dynamic" <br>behavior in the major and minor modes (the harmonic minor has two dynamic <br>tritones). No, this has nothing to do with "dynamic just intonation."<br><br>David Beardsley wrote<br>>he who only calls himself "PAULE" writes:<br>I know I must come across as pretentious sometimes, but my name is Paul <br>Erlich, and my e-mail address it not a clever attempt to conceal it but an <br>unfortunate creation of my co-workers in the systems department.<br><br>Brian -- I tried to include all the world music tuning systems I was <br>acquainted with (not many) in my proposed curriculum, and would certainly <br>think well over 5 hours could be devoted to those and others without <br>changing the outline. (I conceived it as a 30-, not 15-, hour course). The <br>history and diversity of tuning theory is of course very interesting, but <br>would be outside the scope of this course; ideas such as 31-tet and JI have <br>arisen again and again from many highly incompatible theories and so should <br>be included despite their "theoretical" nature. As long as you're mentioning <br>55-tet (1/6-comma meantone), don't forget 43-tet (1/5-comma meantone), which <br>was also discussed in the 18th century, I believe. I'm not aware of 34 <br>having been discussed in the Renaissance, but 53 was (Mercator was 16th <br>century?) so 34 could have been. As for non-octave scales, etc., the field <br>at this point has very little that can be "taught" as "this is the way it <br>is," but certainly the intent of putting it last is to say, "This is the <br>avant garde, you can throw away the presumptions of all the previous lessons <br>if you want to." Those interested can use the remaining free-form weeks to <br>explore these ideas if they wish, and go on to take an advanced course in <br>the subject taught by Prof. McLaren. :)<br><br>Gary wrote,<br><br>>That brings to mind a curious question:  How many underlying bases (as in<br>>plural of basis), structurally speaking, are there for the major scale,<br>>historical or not?  I can think of three right off the top of my head:<br>>1.  Identical upper and lower tetrachords<br>>2.  Circle of fifths (one down and five up)<br>>3.  Primary triads<br><br>I'd add<br>4. Maximal evenness (this works only in 12-tet and 19-tet)<br>5. Unique interval vector (this only works in 12-tet); Balzano liked this <br>one.<br>6-infinity. Lots of other 12-tet set theory garbage; Xenakis has some <br>construction in the appendix of his book "Formalized Music" that looks more <br>complicated than just saying what all the notes are!<br><br>John Chalmers wrote,<br><br>>It seems<br>>therefore, that the major-minor system presupposes some sort of tuning<br>>with acceptable thirds that ignores the syntonic comma. Meantone, ET<br>>and various irregular systems do just this.<br>>(Redfield's just scale does have this property as it consists of three<br>>minor triads on 1/1, 4/3 and 3/2. Every mode of this scale contains a<br>>note differing by a comma from a Ptolemaic mode. The generating tetrachord<br>>is 10/9 x 9/8 x16/15 rather than the Greek 16/15 x 9/8 x 10/9. )<br><br>But this scale has only two major triads, so by your definition of a major <br>scale, it is not a satisfactory tuning for the major-minor system. Or am I <br>missing something?<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 20 Nov 1996 22:21 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01171; Wed, 20 Nov 1996 22:22:42 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01174<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA15129; Wed, 20 Nov 1996 13:22:39 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 13:22:39 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.961120151636.7775B-100000@library><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
