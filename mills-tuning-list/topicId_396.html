This basically means that I have to calculate my <br>'cents' approximations of whole-number ratios to even more compromised figures <br>--e.g., the ratio of 7/4 can be represented as 969 cents, or 31 cents flat of a <br>theoretical tempered minor seventh; the proteus will then read that discrepancy <br>as 20/64ths of a semitone, etc. This process is utterly tedious, as well as <br>being insufficient in terms of deriving natural intervals (i.e., I  am forced <br>to tune by maths, rather than by ear).<br>Do the Proteus' that you lot are using really tune in cents? How recent is your <br>equipment? etc., etc. I think I would do anything to get away from tuning the <br>way I do now (except for buying my own equipment, of course). <br><br>-Flynn Cohen<br> Dartington College of Arts<br> Devon, England.<br>>fcohen@dcolarts.demon.co.uk<<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 4 Mar 1996 22:02 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id NAA00015; Mon, 4 Mar 1996 13:01:49 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 4 Mar 1996 13:01:49 -0800<br>Message-Id: <0099ED9E6F07B2A1.D849@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
