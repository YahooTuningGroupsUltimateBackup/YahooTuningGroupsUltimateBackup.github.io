Taking<br>these regions at +/- 30 cents (the 60-cent melodic limen) we have the<br>following regions:<br><br>-30 ? 30		prime 1:1<br>41 ? 101 		chromatic semitone 25:24<br>82 ? 142		diatonic semitone 16:15<br>152 ? 212		minor tone 10:9<br>174 ? 234		major tone 9:8<br>286 ? 346		minor third 6:5<br>356 ? 416		major third 5:4<br>397 ? 457		diminished fourth 32:25<br>468 ? 528		fourth 4:3<br>539 ? 599		augmented fourth 25:18<br>601 ? 661		diminished fifth 36:25<br>672 ? 732		fifth 3:2<br>743 ? 803		augmented fifth 25:16<br>784 ? 844		minor sixth 8:5<br>854 ? 914		major sixth 5:3<br>966 ? 1026		lesser minor seventh 16:9<br>988 ? 1048 	greater minor seventh 9:5<br>1058 ? 1118 	major seventh 15:8<br>1099 ? 1159	diminished octave 48:25<br>1170 ? 1230	octave 2:1<br><br>Remember that I am here considering melody, not harmony; obviously an<br>octave of 1230 cents would be something terrible in harmony.<br><br>The minor and major tones greatly overlap, and so do the lesser and<br>greater minor sevenths; as far as melody is concerned these pairs merge.<br><br>At the other extreme, the prime is absolutely distinct from the<br>chromatic semitone, the diatonic semitone is clearly distinct from the<br>minor tone, the minor third is very easily distinguished from both the<br>major tone and the major third, the perfect fourth is quite distinct<br>melodically from both the diminished and augmented fourths, the<br>augmented fourth is distinct from the diminished fifth, the perfect<br>fifth is highly distinct melodically from the diminished and augmented<br>fifths, the minor sixth is quite distinct from the major sixth, the<br>major sixth is quite distinct from the lesser minor seventh, the greater<br>minor seventh is distinct from the major seventh, and the diminished<br>octave is distinct from the perfect octave.<br><br>To my own ears at least, all the above predictions of theory are<br>correct. The augmented fourth and diminished fifth, for example, are as<br>different in character as the locrian and lydian modes (when sung just),<br>the former melancholy and 'minor', the latter weirdly major and<br>hilarious. But in the 12-tone equal, where these modes must use the same<br>600-cent interval, this difference in character is far less pronounced.<br><br>A third class of justly-intoned interval-pairs would be predicted to be<br>but little distinct when played on instruments; singers must either<br>exaggerate the difference between these intervals in order to sing them,<br>as in 19-tone equal, or else merge them altogether, as in 12-tone equal.<br>These are:<br><br>chromatic semitone & diatonic semitone (faintly distinct to my ears,<br>although with great effort; perhaps the very conjunct nature of these<br>intervals permits their separation by sheer 'dead-reckoning'.)<br><br>major third and diminished fourth (not distinct to my ears)<br><br>augmented fifth & minor sixth (distinct to my ears with great effort,<br>the former slightly expansive and 'major', the latter slightly<br>contractive and 'minor')<br><br>major seventh & diminished octave (not distinct to my ears)<br><br>Finally, there are two "holes" in the octave big enough to definitely<br>escape from the melodic orbits of the consonances and tonal dissonances.<br>These are 234 ?286 cents (center: 260 cents) and 914 ? 966 cents<br>(center: 940 cents). Like faint stars that come out at night while the<br>sun no longer shines (forgive the poetaster), the atonal dissonances<br>that occupy these two "black holes" enter into prominence. The augmented<br>second/diminished third "hole" has three atonal dissonances, of which<br>125:108 at 253 cents is nearest the center. 7:6 is at 267 cents, so may<br>exert some influence. The augmented sixth/diminished seventh "hole" has<br>likewise three atonal dissonances (necessarily so, since these two<br>"holes" are complements of each other), of which 216:125, the complement<br>of 125:108, is nearest the center. 7:4, at 969 cents, is not part of<br>this "hole", and moves definitely within the tonal orbit of 16:9.<br><br>It is to be noted also, that 7:4 is very disjunct, and this further<br>increases the difficulty in singing it. 7:4 is in fact the very type of<br>the interval that when sung "just" sounds badly mistuned; indeed, the<br>effect of 7:4 when played just, very well corresponds to the typical<br>Western notion of a singer unable to carry a tune. The third septimal<br>interval, 7:5, is swallowed up by 25:18, which it closely resembles in<br>melodic effect; the latter is however even more intensely weird, cool,<br>laid-back, etc.<br><br>If we now insert 125:108 and 216:125, merge the two pairs 10:9/9:8 &<br>16:9/9:5,  divide the narrow 10-cent gaps remaining between some of the<br>pitch classes, and divide the narrow overlaps equally, we have the<br>following division of the octave:<br><br>-30 ? 35 		perfect prime<br>36 ? 91		augmented prime/diminished second (chromatic semitone)<br>92 ? 147		minor second (diatonic semitone)<br>148 ? 228		major second<br>229 ? 285		augmented second/diminished third<br>286 ? 351		minor third<br>352 ? 406		major third<br>407 ? 462		diminished fourth<br>463 ? 533		perfect fourth<br>534 ? 600 		augmented fourth<br>601 ? 666		diminished fifth<br>667 ? 738		perfect fifth<br>739 ? 793		augmented fifth<br>794 ? 849		minor sixth<br>850 ? 915		major sixth<br>916 ? 971		augmented sixth/diminished seventh<br>972 ? 1052		minor seventh<br>1053 ? 1109	major seventh<br>1110 ? 1164 	diminished octave<br>1165 ? 1230 	octave<br><br>The major second and minor seventh pitch classes are predicted to be<br>much wider than the average width, whereas ten other pitch classes are<br>slightly narrower than average, and seven pitch classes about average in<br>width.<br>I do not want to make too much of this, for there is evidence to the<br>contrary, but it is a common observation that the major second and minor<br>seventh are the most variable in widths of the intervals, and not only<br>in Western music...<br><br>The pitch class comprising the consonances may however well be slightly<br>narrower than those of the disjunct tonal dissonances, and especially<br>the atonal disjunct dissonances, for it is well-proven that singers can<br>sing consonances much more accurately than disjunct dissonances, and<br>audiences may be more able to hear errors.<br><br>These tables are nothing more than the roughest of estimates;<br>nevertheless they do permit us to predict quite well the melodic<br>character of the several degrees of the usual temperaments. The nearer<br>the degree of a temperament to the centers of the 19 pitch classes, the<br>more surely will that degree sound melodically distinct, and possessed<br>of a unique character, for the more perfectly will its degrees reproduce<br>the tonal fabric of just intonation, without however the intonational<br>flaws of just intonation (namely the inconsistency of the three<br>consonant cycles), which a good temperament resolves.<br><br>There is however, another most important point to be made. As has been<br>seen, ten of the pitch classes of just intonation may be but roughly 55<br>cents wide, and my own ears at least find that at least a few of the<br>just intervals require some considerable attention to keep distinct from<br>adjacent tones in melody. One would expect that two tones as 25:24 and<br>16:15, separated by only 41 cents, would be far less melodically<br>distinct than 25:18 and 36:25, separated by 63 cents. In fact, whatever<br>may be the corrections which greater study may make to the above tables,<br>it is quite certain that the 19-tone equal, which equalizes the<br>intervals at 63.3 cents (63.16 cents without a stretched octave) is<br>melodically richer than just intonation itself, because in this<br>temperament almost all the last instances of melodic confusion of<br>adjacent intervals are removed, a fact that becomes apparent on the most<br>cursory examination of this temperament. In the 19-tone equal four<br>interval pairs that are susceptible of being melodically confused in<br>just intonation (chromatic vs. diatonic semitone, etc) become quite<br>distinct.<br><br>It is instructive to use the above determination of the melodic pitch<br>classes of just intonation to analyze the intervals of 12-tone equal,<br>which are widely known.<br><br>The 12-tone equal has, melodically considered, excellent fourths and<br>fifths, and its major seconds and minor sevenths also are not bad,<br>becasue they are relatively near the center of the just ranges for these<br>intervals. Much less satisfactory are the minor seconds, minor thirds,<br>major thirds, minor ixths, major sixths and major seventh. Although<br>highly imaginative persons very often _try_ to hear additional intervals<br>in the 12-tone equal, this temperament has no chromatic semitone,<br>augmented tone, diminished fourth, tritone, diminished fifth, augmented<br>fifth, augmented sixth or diminished octave. Consequently, it is these<br>intervals of the 19-tone equal, or of just intonation for that matter,<br>that are likely to sound strangest to the typical Western musician. But<br>they sound strangely beautiful, not merely strange.<br><br>Perhaps the most atonal of the 12-tone intervals is its 600-cent<br>interval, which has neither the even-more-than-septimal weirdness of the<br>augmented fourth nor the intensely menacing quality of the true<br>diminished fifth, but rather an utterly neutral, colorless ethos.<br>19-tone equal has two atonal intervals, its augmented second/diminished<br>third and its augmented sixth/diminished seventh, of which the former is<br>far less objectionable than the 600-cent atonal interval of 12-tone<br>equal, but the latter even more so.<br><br>Finally, I give the centers of the 19 melodic pitch classes, together<br>with the degrees of the 19-tone equal:<br><br>Just		19-tone Equal (with octave stretch)<br>64			63.3<br>119			126.6<br>188			189.9<br>257			253.2<br>319			316.5<br>379			379.8<br>435			443.1<br>502			506.4<br>567			569.7<br>633			633.0<br>702			696.3<br>766			759.6<br>822			822.9<br>884			886.2<br>943			949.5<br>1012		1012.8<br>1081		1076.1<br>1137		1139.4<br>1200		1202.7<br><br>Here is as good as anywhere to announce that I am in the habit of<br>calling enneadecaphony (19-tone equal temperament) with an octave<br>stretch of 2.7 cents 'eumely', from the Greek for<br>'sweetly-sounding'.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Comments to Andrew Kaye<br>PostedDate:  18-12-97 06:18:55<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  18-12-97 06:16:54-18-12-97 06:16:55,18-12-97 06:16:32-18-12-97 06:16:32<br>DeliveredDate:  18-12-97 06:16:32<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256571.001CFF7F; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 06:18:40 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18674; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 06:18:55 +0100<br>Date: Thu, 18 Dec 1997 06:18:55 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18673<br>Received: (qmail 20422 invoked from network); 17 Dec 1997 21:18:52 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 17 Dec 1997 21:18:52 -0800<br>Message-Id: <34991428.1F0C@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
