But I'd say that as long as we keep writing, for example, just<br>intonation music and marketing it as such, it will always be perceived as JI.<br>All that remains then is just the question of how widely the music gets heard,<br>because it will be heard with that label on it.  <br><br>   By the way, I too agree with Ivor's idea of moods.  And in response to Paul's<br>question on the topic, I'll mention two things.  First, Ivor claimed to have<br>tested the 19TET, 22TET, and 24TET moods on over a hundred people and got<br>similar reactions as to their moods (forceful, peaceful, and same as 12TET,<br>respectively).  <br><br>   Second, and along the lines of personal experience, I am increasingly of the<br>impression that mood are more easily perceivable than theoretically analyzable<br>interval approximations for example, when it comes to real-world music.  I say<br>that in the sense that, when notes "fly by" our ears at typical rates, even for<br>harmonic rhythms, it's pretty difficult for us to pinpoint tiny details like<br>exactly how a major third is tuned, or whether it has any neutral thirds in the<br>tuning.  But what I do hear loud and clear over the course of phrases and entire<br>compositions, is the cummulative effect of those qualities.  If a composition<br>uses lots of neutral thirds (as I did in a recent composition of my own) it's a<br>little hard to latch on to the exact tuning of any one chord, especially at this<br>piece's tempo.  Still, the ambiguous sensation of those neutral thirds is<br>flagrantly obvious in the overall sound of the composition.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 22 Feb 1996 13:04 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id EAA18780; Thu, 22 Feb 1996 04:04:14 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 22 Feb 1996 04:04:14 -0800<br>Message-Id: <0099E4AE788DC08B.BBDC@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
