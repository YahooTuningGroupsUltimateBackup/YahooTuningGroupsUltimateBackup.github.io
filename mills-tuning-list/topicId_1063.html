There don't seem to be <br>nearly enough frets on J.C.'s guitar to make 49/oct -- is it that if all the <br>notes were transposed to one octave, there'd be 49?<br><br>Sorry the event wasn't more popular -- I hope to be contributing my own <br>22-tone jazz/rock in some future Microstock. While Neil's tunings are the <br>best ETs for 5-limit harmony, and Catler favors purely tuned 13-limit <br>sounds, my own preference falls somewhere in between, with 7-limit harmony <br>predominating and excursions up to the 11-limit. Although I won't deny their <br>musical usefulness, 13-limit sounds have yet to impress me as "consonant" in <br>the slightest. Right now I'm still fumbling with a keyboard, barely able to <br>reach a "perfect fifth" with one hand, can't wait for the guitar to arrive . <br>. .<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 28 Oct 1996 18:17 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06658; Mon, 28 Oct 1996 11:49:54 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07341<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id CAA16107; Mon, 28 Oct 1996 02:49:52 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 28 Oct 1996 02:49:52 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199610280549_MC1-B64-1070@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
