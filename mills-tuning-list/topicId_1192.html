There are two obvious ways to combine as <br>many of them as you want into any desired playing <br>configuration: key extensions and push rods.<br><br>Key extensions: pieces of metal bent in a Z shape, one end <br>fastened to the MIDI keys, the other holding the surface to be <br>played. In side view (the * are the extensions):<br><br>           **************  -----------<br>           ********** ----| keyboard  |<br> playing   *      --------|    1      |<br> surface   *               -----------<br>    *********************  -----------<br>           ********** ----| keyboard  |<br>                  --------|    2      |<br>                           -----------<br>                               etc.<br><br>Push rods: with a pin on the lower end to sit in a hole in the <br>MIDI key, the top surface going through a plate that defines <br>the key configuration desired (you can have several plates). <br>Push-on keys of various lengths, shapes and colours identify <br>each as desired and can be interchanged to change tuning. Side <br>view again:<br><br>    playing<br>    surface<br> _____****______geometry plate<br>     ** * *<br>    * * *  *<br>   *  * *   *    -----------<br>   * *  *   ----| keyboard  |<br>  *  *  --------|    1      |<br>  *  *           -----------<br> *   *    -----------<br> *   ----| keyboard  |<br> --------|    2      |<br>          -----------<br>              etc.<br><br>Either way: no electronics work. No special software <br>development. (Not even any "entrepreneurial attitude"!) Cost <br>about $600 for a 48 notes/octave setup.<br><br>I'd use the push rod method if I were building one. Wood <br>doweling is light weight and rigid in compression for the best <br>feel, easy to work and cheap. And, with the only modification <br>of the keyboards being a small hole in each key for a pin, <br>they can be put back to regular use at any time.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 19 Nov 1996 18:28 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18110; Tue, 19 Nov 1996 18:29:25 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18111<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA17306; Tue, 19 Nov 1996 09:29:22 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 19 Nov 1996 09:29:22 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.961119090920.13306A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
