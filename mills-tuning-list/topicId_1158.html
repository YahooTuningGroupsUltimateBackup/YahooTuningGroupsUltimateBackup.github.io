When will you people learn to make a listserv a<br>constructive tool? If someone just subscribed to this list to learn about<br>alternate tunings, what are they going to see? They're going to come away<br>with the idea that microtonality involves a lot of irrelevant railings! Ye,<br>gods, people, hasn't anyone taken logic 101?

Two<br>potential challenges come to mind though.<br><br>   First, computer screens are nearly square as opposed to the extremely long<br>and narrow, horizontal format of most any keyboard scheme.  Can we come up with<br>key layouts that make sense on a nearly-square format?<br><br>   I have thought of another type of controller than a keyboard (it would<br>probably be too difficult to describe in words) but it does have one problem in<br>common with this sort of thing:  It would be kinda tough to make velocity<br>sensitivity detectable.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 16 Nov 1996 19:29 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11694; Sat, 16 Nov 1996 19:31:03 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14378<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id KAA11275; Sat, 16 Nov 1996 10:31:00 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 16 Nov 1996 10:31:00 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01540b00aeb3b525e1aa@[204.74.9.166]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
