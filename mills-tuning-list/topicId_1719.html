This is true for Music; it is also true for Chemistry,<br>Mathematics, Choreography just to name a few of them. These notational<br>systems have multiple and deep relationships with their discipline. They<br>reflect a state of knowledge as well as a vision of the world, but they are<br>also a decisive element in the evolution of their discipline.<br><br>The third Multidisciplinary Musical Meetings aims at taking stock of the<br>evolution and the roles of music notation as well as its interactions with<br>our thought and practices, by bringing together composers, musicologists,<br>performers and music historians. The question of notation will also be<br>examinated from the point of view of other disciplines like Dance,<br>Linguistics, Cognitive Sciences, Mathematics and Computer Science.<br><br>The program includes about twenty talks (with a special contribution of<br>composer I. Xenakis), debates and demos as well as an exhibition on Music<br>Notation.<br><br>Additional information available at :<br>           http://www.grame.fr/RMPD/RMPD97/presentation_us.html.<br><br>For registration please contact<br>           GRAME 9 rue du Garet - BP 1185 - 69202 Lyon Cedex 01 - France<br>           Ph +33 (0)4 72 07 37 00, Fax +33 (0)4 72 07 37 01<br>           Email: grame@rd.grame.fr<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 24 Feb 1997 23:25 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA19122; Mon, 24 Feb 1997 23:25:06 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA19115<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id OAA04623; Mon, 24 Feb 1997 14:21:22 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 24 Feb 1997 14:21:22 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B06308E12AA3A.3993@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5547 href="#5547">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>5/26/1997 9:46:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Date: Fri, 23 May 1997 12:56:47 -0400<br>From: EMF@emf.org (Electronic Music Foundation)<br><br>THE EMF WORLDWIDE CALENDAR<br>May 23, 1997<br><br>In and around New York City<br>Hartvestworks 'Listen In'<br>Lisa Karrer, on stilts with MIDI Impact Triggers generating sampled sounds,<br>David Simons, with his MIDI Theremin, and Jeff Gompertz, wearing his<br>Inflatable Polyethylene Bubble Suit fitted with tiny fans and studded with<br>MIDI Proximity Triggers, will demonstrate these devices as they relate to<br>their in-progress chamber opera 'The Birth Of George'. >Friday, May 30 from<br>6 to 8 pm at Harvestworks, 596 Broadway, Suite 602.
