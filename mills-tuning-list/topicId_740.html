Paul Rapoport<br>is to date one of the keenest minds and <br>best writers to have explained these<br>types of tunings in detail, along with<br>the inestimable John Chalmers.  Kraig Grady's<br>1989 1/1 article "Erv Wilson's Hexany" deals<br>with a subset of the Wilson CPS scales<br>and does so in some detail, but does not<br>concern itself with many of the implications<br>of Wilson's CPS tunings, nor with the many<br>operations which can be performed on <br>Wilson CPS tunings (stellation, cross-product<br>sets, etc.).  Paul Rapoport has explained these<br>ideas with admirable clarity, and John Chalmers<br>has also explained them very well.  Warren <br>Burt's Topic 2 of Digest 31 is the clearest<br>explanation of cross-product sets written<br>to date.<br>--<br>Paul Erlich pointed out that my lists of Wilson<br>CPS tunings sometimes added a "confusing and<br>extraneous "1/1.  It is probably true that adding<br>the implied 1/1 was confusing--so let me take<br>a stab at explaining why Erv Wilson doesn't,<br>and why I sometimes do.<br>The Wilson CPS tunings can be highly tonal<br>but never have a 1/1 in the form Erv Wilson<br>generates them.  Erv typically starts with 1<br>and takes some mutually prime set of <br>numbers and generates an abstract set of<br>points in ratio space by combinatorial <br>methods.  (See Tuning Digest 30 if you're not<br>familiar with this process.)  This abstract<br>set of points in ratio space is not strictly<br>speaking a tuning, but a framework within<br>which individual tunings can "collapse" down<br>into acoustic space. <br>What I'm talking about here is akin conceptually<br>to the process by which an equal-tempered<br>chromatic scale generates a melodic mode.<br>Depending on which note of the chromatic scale<br>one starts on, quite different-sounding modes<br>can be generated.  Thus, phrygian sounds entirely<br>different lydian or dorian--yet all are theoretically<br>contained within the 12-TET chromatic scale.<br>Similarly, the process of getting individual tunings<br>(as on a guitar or a synthesizer or a set of<br>tubulongs) from abstract points in ratio space<br>is a process of projection from a higher-<br>dimensional ratio space into a lower-dimensional<br>acoustic space.  This process is familiar to<br>students of analytic geometry: the family of<br>conic curves is usually derived by explaining<br>them as projections of 3 dimensional lines<br>inscribed on the surface of a 3-D cone down onto<br>the two-dimensional space of graph paper.<br>Depending on the angle of the cone to the<br>2-D graph paper, one can obtain an hyperbola,<br>a parabola, etc.  A classic example of projective<br>geometry--one of the more fascinating byways<br>of mathematics.<br>Erv Wilson's CPS structures in ratio space<br>exhibit a number of paradoxical properties.<br>If low prime numbers are used as generators,<br>the tunings will strongly imply tonality--<br>because the root motions between three-<br>pitch "facets" (i.e., triads) in ratio space<br>are ratios like 3/2, 4/3, &c.  Yet, paradoxically, <br>the CPS structure itself in ratio space<br>has no 1/1 and thus no tonal center--until<br>it is collapsed down into acoustical space<br>by dividing the entire set of ratio space<br>points by the ratio of a single ratio space<br>point.  (I.e., by choosing some ratio as a<br>1/1 and dividing all the other ratios by<br>that ratio.)<br>This process has the effect both of centering<br>the acoustic representation around one<br>particular point in ratio space--in effect,<br>making some arbitrary point in the n-space<br>lattice the origin of the ratio space <br>coordinates--and it also has the effect<br>of making the individual acoustic intervals<br>more complex than they were in the original<br>abstract ratio-space representation because<br>they're now all multiplied by the inverse of<br>the ratio chosen as 1/1 (that is, divided by<br>the ratio chosen as 1/1).<br>Erv Wilson's CPS tunings are not really <br>atonal when low integer generators are used.<br>They become increasingly atonal-sounding <br>as higher and ever higher integers are used<br>as members of the generating set.<br>However, because any other point of the<br>ratio space lattice can be chosen at any<br>time as a different 1/1, the Wilson CPS<br>tunings allow maximum modulatory<br>flexibility with a minimum set of pitches.<br>Partch's diamond is less efficient in modulatory<br>terms  than Wilson's CPS structures in<br>ratio space  because  moving from one <br>section of the two-dimensional Partch  <br>ratio-space diamond to the next does not <br>produce a maximum change in triadic notes<br>with a minimum length of ratio-space<br>movement.<br>You could think of this in projective geometry<br>terms: the length of the geodesic in n-space<br>between two points separated by more than<br>2 dimensions will always be shorter than<br>the length of the geodesic on a plane between<br>the same two points projected on a plane.<br>This is nothing more complicated that the<br>very familiar problem of projecting 3-D<br>objects onto a 2-D plane.  Map-makers have<br>for millenia known that projecting coordinates<br>on a sphere down onto a 2-D plane creates<br>large distortions in some of the distances<br>between some of the coordinates.  Some<br>distances which are short in the 3-D original<br>are unnaturally and deceptively long on<br>the 2-D plane; and so it is with ratio space<br>projected onto a plane--as with Partch's<br>ratio diamond, which can be (as has been,<br>by Erv Wilson) visualized as a much more<br>compact higher-dimensional ratio-space<br>structure.<br>Another way of thinking of the Wilson CPS<br>method is that it provides a ratio-space <br>coordinate system within which acoustic <br>structures can be  rotated with maximum<br>symmetry.  To put it another way, as<br>the size of the Partch diamond increases,<br>the amount of symmetry-breaking increases<br>as the square as the number of prime<br>generators.  By "amount of symmetry-breaking"<br>I mean here the number of anisometric points<br>in the grid, each of which has the potential<br>to break symmetry upon rotation of a musical<br>structure across the grid. <br>Example: In the 4 5 6 7 1/4 1/5 1/6 1/7<br>Partch diamond with 4 generators there<br>are 4 1/1's--1/1, 3/3, 5/5 and 7/7.<br>This anisometric diagonal of 1/1s acts<br>in effect like an axis.  It has the effect of<br>breaking the symmetry of 2-D ratio<br>space structures when they're rotated<br>through the 2-D ratio space of the Partch<br>diamond.  But in a Wilson CPS *there is<br>no 1/1*, and thus there's *never* any<br>example of symmetry-breaking when<br>substructures are rotated through<br>ratio space. (Wilson CPS structures<br>are inherently symmetrical: thus their<br>symmetry cannot collapse in ratio space<br>but only when they are projected <br>into some anisometric lower-dimensional<br>coordinate system.)<br>Physicists know that many physical<br>processes can be described in terms<br>of broken symmetry: the nucleation of<br>snowflakes in a supersaturated<br>air, the spontaneous transformation<br>of isotherms into tornadic weather<br>patterns, the formation  of new crystals through <br>screw dislocations, and the fracture of the <br>single unified force after the intial few<br>femtoseconds of the Big Bang into the 4 <br>fundamental universal forces of gravitation, <br>electromagnetism, strong and weak nuclear <br>forces, are all  classic examples of symmetry-<br>breaking which leads to emergent order.<br>In the same way, symmetry breaking is<br>required to generate an emergent order <br>out of the abstract ratio space structures<br>of the Wilson CPS or the Partch diamond.<br>This leads us to a concise explanation of<br>why I sometimes add an "extraneous"<br>1/1 to the Wilson CPS.<br>Seen from the perspective of symmetry<br>breaking as a means of generating scalar<br>order, it's not obvious why choosing<br>one of the CPS lattice points as a 1/1<br>is significantly different from adding<br>a 1/1 point at the lowest-dimensional point<br>of the structure in ratio space.  Both<br>procedures break the symmetry of the<br>abstract ratio-space CPS; both procedures<br>collapse the higher-dimensional structure<br>down into a lower-dimensional acoustic<br>space.<br>The advantages of adding a 1/1 at the lowest-<br>dimensional point of the ratio space Wilson<br>CPS are: [A] the acoustic ratios are maximally<br>simplified and so it's especially easy to hear<br>the underlying harmonic progressions. [B] the<br>acoustic distance from the 1/1 to any given<br>scale-step is minimized. The disadvantages<br>of adding such an "extraneous" 1/1 in ratio<br>space are: [C] modulation is no longer <br>maximally efficient--that is, modulations<br>no longer produce maximum change in <br>number of chord components for minimum<br>change in root position; [D] it is no longer<br>simple to modulate to another substructure<br>embedded within the ratio space CPS.<br>These advantages and disadvantages must<br>be weighed carefully.  In fact, Erv Wilson<br>often adds "extraneous" pitches to his<br>CPS tunings--there is no reason whatever<br>why I can't add "extraneous" pitches too.<br>The point is that the process is not black-&-<br>white, good-or-bad.  Simply because Erv<br>Wilson doesn't do something (and even Erv<br>sometimes refers to the "nonexistent"<br>1/1 at the lowest-dimensional point in<br>ratio space in the process of theorizing;<br>he regards as the null operation in which <br>all axes of the ratio space are raised to<br>the zeroth power) doesn't mean it can't <br>or oughtn't to be done.<br>--mclaren <br>  <br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 13 Aug 1996 21:16 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02160; Tue, 13 Aug 1996 21:17:01 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02166<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA17431; Tue, 13 Aug 1996 12:16:58 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 13 Aug 1996 12:16:58 -0700<br>Message-Id: <13960813191331/0005695065PK5EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
