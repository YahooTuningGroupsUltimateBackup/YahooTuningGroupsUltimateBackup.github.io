Chalmers&#x22; &#x3C;non12@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/10/1995 1:33:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>The current discussion of tonal drive and resolution in JI <br>seems to me to miss an elementary point stressed by Harry Partch <br>himself. JI increases the range of available consonance and dissonance <br>however C and D are defined, see Tenney's book _A History of <br>Consonance and Dissonance_. <br>	Hence, in some contexts the dominant seventh chord should be <br>tuned 4:5:6:7 for maximum consonance, but in others one might wish to <br>use 20:25:30:36 (1/1 5/4 3/2 6/5) or even 36:45:54:64 (1/1 5/4 3/2 16/9). <br>	One should read Chapter 11, "The Question of Resolution,"<br>in HP's _Genesis of a Music_, 2nd edition, pp 181-194. While HP<br>wrote everything in the key of G (392 hz), in part because of<br>material and technical limitations, in part for theoretical reasons <br>(monophony is the harmonic expansion of a single tone, the 1/1, see<br>the definition on page 71), he was very aware of resolution and<br>chordal motion and wrote some extremely dissonant, yet powerful <br>progressions. (Allen, do you still have your notes from his UCSD <br>class?).<br>	Partch suggested several principles: Resolve voices by very<br>narrow intervals, avoid 11 O or U identities (11 th harmonic or <br>subharmonic of the tonic) in the bass, space the voices widely, and <br>mix harmonic and subharmonic (O and U) chords in progressions. One does <br>not have to use complete hexads (1 3 5 7 9 11 harmonics) and the remaining voices  may be doubled as desired. Non-harmonic tones and tones outside <br>the conventional 43-tone scale may also be used (HP sometimes did this <br>on the canons and even changed reeds on the Chromelodea, i.e., 25/21 <br>in Delusion.)<br> <br>--John<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 11 Nov 1995 03:15 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id RAA18141; Fri, 10 Nov 1995 17:15:25 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 10 Nov 1995 17:15:25 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199511110113.RAA17982@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2303 href="#2303">ðŸ”—</a>Allen Strange &#x3C;STRANGE@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/11/1995 8:30:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Pardon my ignorance but what is meant by "LCM" and can someone explain<br>"minimum chords"?<br><br><br>                 thanx--<br><br>=========================================================================<br>|                          Allen Strange                                |<br>|             http://cadre.sjsu.edu/music/strange.html                  |<br>|_______________________________________________________________________|<br>| Electro-Acoustic Music     | International Computer Music Association |<br>|        Studios             |        2040 Polk St., Suite 330          |<br>| School of Music            |        San Francisco, CA 94109           |<br>| San Jose State University  |       Telephone + (408) 395-2538         |<br>| 1 Washington Square        |          Fax + (408) 395-2648            |<br>| San Jose, CA 95192-0095    |      Email: icma@sjsuvm1.sjsu.edu        |<br>| Telephone +(408) 924-4646  |                                          |<br>| Fax +(408) 924-4773        |     We hope to see you at the ICMC96     |<br>| <strange@sjsuvm1.sjsu.edu> |         On the Edge in Hong Kong         |<br>|                            |         ICMC96@cs.ust.hk for info        |<br>|=======================================================================<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 11 Nov 1995 23:38 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id NAA00386; Sat, 11 Nov 1995 13:37:59 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 11 Nov 1995 13:37:59 -0800<br>Message-Id: <951111213450_71670.2576_HHB6-4@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2305 href="#2305">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/11/1995 1:39:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I believe that LCM is the usual mathematical abbreviation for "Least Common<br>Multiple".  Marion and probably others use that as an indicator of the overall<br>harmonic complexity of a chord.  The lower the LCM, the simpler the chord.  <br><br>   For example, the least common multiple of 4, 5, and 6 is 60.  That's the<br>smallest number that is an even multiple of all three (4x15=5x12=6x10=60).  So<br>that major triad voicing would be equally complex harmonically as a 10:12:15<br>minor triad (LCM is also 60), even though its numbers are somewhat higher on the<br>whole.  <br><br>   Some on the list have disputed whether LCM is the best measure of harmonic<br>complexity.  Personally, it strikes me as a reasonable rule-of-thumb, although I<br>haven't personally compared it with other possibilities.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 12 Nov 1995 06:00 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id UAA02660; Sat, 11 Nov 1995 20:00:29 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 11 Nov 1995 20:00:29 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199511120358.WAA19511@freenet3.carleton.ca><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
