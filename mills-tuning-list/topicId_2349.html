Another way of expressing this is that the<br>difference between the 5-fifths semitone (B-C) and the 7-fifths semitone<br>(C-C#) is 2 degrees. The doubly positive systems are 10, 22, 34, 46, 58,<br>70.....10+M*12  where M-2 is the number of degrees between C and C#. For,<br>22-tet M is 3<br>degrees and 22-tet is described by Wilson as a doubly-positive, ternary<br>system.<br>Other ternary systems are 29, 36, 43 and 50-tets.<br><br>--John<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net<br>Subject:  Re: syntonic and skhismatic notation<br>PostedDate:  24-08-97 17:16:58<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  28-08-97 09:57:42-28-08-97 09:57:43,28-08-97 09:55:16-28-08-97 09:55:17<br>DeliveredDate:  28-08-97 09:55:17<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564FD.0053F089; Sun, 24 Aug 1997 17:16:50 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA20453; Sun, 24 Aug 1997 17:16:58 +0200<br>Date: Sun, 24 Aug 1997 17:16:58 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA20447<br>Received: (qmail 26792 invoked from network); 24 Aug 1997 15:16:54 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 24 Aug 1997 15:16:54 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541101b025ad9d2069@[207.207.3.118]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6019 href="#6019">ðŸ”—</a>gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)</h3><span>8/27/1997 10:42:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Bill Alves wrote:<br><br>> The first known Indian treatise to describe the octave divided into 22<br>> srutis is the Natyasastra of Bharata.
