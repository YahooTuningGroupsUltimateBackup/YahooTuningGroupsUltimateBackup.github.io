Anyway, if you mean 5-limit JI, my first suggestion <br>would be Helmholtz's 24-tone temperament, which is indistinguishable from <br>just intonation and allows just playing in many different "keys". If you <br>mean 7-limit JI, I'd suggest a meantone tuning: a circle of fifths of 697 <br>cents each -- then you will have 28 very pure 7-limit tetrads as well as 18 <br>major and 18 minor keys playable without any of the difficulties of true JI.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 17:31 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04327; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 17:32:43 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04346<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA11260; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 08:32:40 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 11 Nov 1996 08:32:40 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.961111082148.2158H-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
