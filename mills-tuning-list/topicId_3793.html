Sorry I didn't make the connection<br>right away.  They have some SUPER products, and are right in the<br>pocket with DSP-type development. Their Wolf Roth was given <br>a SSAIRA award for their Audio Editor.<br><br>And we shouldn't suggest that the Workstation-style of<br>synthesis won't slowly take over, despite 'seeming' more expensive.<br>I'd be very interested to see what this new device you've heard of<br>is doing.  Hopefully they'll be demonstrating it at Karlsrhue in<br>November.  Don't forget AES is in San Fran this Fall, maybe there.<br><br>Although, in this market, you might be better off taking the $6500<br>and doing a straddle in the currency futures market, say buying<br>Deutsch Marks forward to expire on Dec 17 (before the EU currency<br>kicks in).<br><br>Then again, maybe we need a whole new forum called <br>"financial derivatives based on the 7/4 interval"<br>Cheers:<br>Rick S.</div>
