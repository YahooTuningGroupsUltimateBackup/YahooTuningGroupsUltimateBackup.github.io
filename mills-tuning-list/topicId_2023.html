However, in creating intervals in<br>>JI, you will eventually come across some very complicated ratios<br>>that are so close to simple ones that they will function as<br>>consonances rather than dissonances. So the typical JI <br>>small-integers=consonance / large-integers=dissonance approach<br>>falls flat on its face.<br><br>It is true that JI has no puns, but a similar sort of joke could be done<br>a slightly different way.  Take Bach's Prelude (No.1 from well-tempered<br>Clavichord) which must be one of the punniest pieces around.<br><br>Each arpeggio is played twice, and the first time its meaning matches<br>the tuning of the previous arpeggio and the second time it matches the<br>following arpeggio.  So in JI the frequencies should reflect this and<br>change slightly between the first and second playing.  In most cases<br>some notes would stay the same and some change by small amounts such as<br>81/80, 64/63 and such.  It would be interesting to hear it done this<br>way.<br><br>OK, for the purests, that was not the intended joke.<br><br>-- Ray Tomes -- rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz -- Harmonics Theory --<br>     http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 7 May 1997 14:50 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06798; Wed, 7 May 1997 14:50:35 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06807<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id FAA13146; Wed, 7 May 1997 05:48:27 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 7 May 1997 05:48:27 -0700<br>Message-Id: <l03010d02af95d1c33b10@[165.227.35.74]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
