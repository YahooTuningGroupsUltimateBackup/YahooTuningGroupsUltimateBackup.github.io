By playing through a _descending_ harmonic<br>>>> series with two notes and keeping a "B" on top, we<br>>>> can see that the difference tone line creates an<br>>>> _ascending_ minor scale that corresponds exactly to the<br>>>> Undertone Series created earlier from mirror-imaging.<br><br>Then Paul Erlich wrote:<br>>> The wording here is unclear -- anyone know what Jon<br>>> meant by "playing through a _descending_ harmonic series<br>>> with two notes and keeping a "B" on top"? Judging from<br>>> the results, he probably meant something like "playing<br>>> through a series of superparticular ratios, with the upper<br>>> note fixed at "B", and the lower note descending."<br><br>Then Joseph Monzo wrote:<br>>This is exactly what he meant.  I believe this passage<br>>refers to the part we just heard last night in "Sleeping<br>>Beauty" where Jon does this on his JI electric guitar.<br><br>Maybe I'm misinterpreting the above, but I cannot get it to work.  Here's<br>one my feeble attempts (note names are sometimes approximate):<br><br>lower tone freq  upper tone freq  difference    name<br>---------- ----  ---------- ----  ----------  ---------<br>       C    264       B      495     231      Bb<br>      Bb    231       B      495     264       C<br>     G      198       B      495     297        D<br>    E       165       B      495     330         E<br>   C        132       B      495     363          F#<br>  G          99       B      495     396           G<br> C           66       B      495     429            A<br>C            33       B      495     462             Bb<br><br>The above does not result in a minor scale.  It kind of starts out like a<br>whole tone scale, and the intervals get slightly smaller and smaller.<br><br>Can anyone show an example with actual note names and/or frequencies?  Thanks,<br>--Mark<br><br>P.S.:  I do remember an demonstration long ago of "difference tones", where<br>the resultant tones played the tune "Yankee Doodle".  What's scary is that<br>just after I thought of it, while writing this email, a commercial came on<br>the radio for a place called "Yankee Doodle's" in Woodland Hills (KROQ, FM<br>106.7, Los Angeles, California, USA).
