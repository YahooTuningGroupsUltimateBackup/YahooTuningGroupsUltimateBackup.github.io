It is not;<br>it is a 7 tone unequal scale that varies from gamelan to gamelan.<br>One might map various pelogs onto 9-tone ET or even 23, but is<br>would be a very non-Indonesian thing to do.<br>	Anyway, there are 15 possible 5 tone modes in 7-tet:<br>1a. 	2 1 2 1 1	1b. 	2 2 1 1 1	1c.	3 1 1 1 1<br>2a.	1 2 1 1 2	2b.	2 1 1 1 2	2c.	1 3 1 1 1<br>3a.	2 1 1 2 1	3b.	1 1 1 2 2	3c.	1 1 3 1 1<br>4a.	1 1 2 1 2	4b.	1 1 2 2 1	4c.	1 1 1 3 1<br>5a.	1 2 1 2 1	5b.	1 2 2 1 1	5c.	1 1 1 1 3<br> <br>Lou Harrison has played in 1a, 2a and 4a. The "Thai" modes correspond <br>to numbers 4a, 2a and 2b. I suspect that the a modes are the most <br>common and I would  think the c modes would be hard to use.<br> <br>I had forgotten that the Greek chromatic is found in South India<br>as well as the enharmonic without the divided semitone. There is a<br>discussion of tuning currently on the rec.music.indian.classical Usenet<br>newsgroup and the influence of Greek theory has been mentioned, though<br>not yet discussed. I will post anything especially interesting to Tuning.<br> <br>--John	<br> <br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 30 Dec 1995 17:02 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA22446; Sat, 30 Dec 1995 08:02:50 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 30 Dec 1995 08:02:50 -0800<br>Message-Id: <0099BA60FE2A37E6.5B55@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
