According to the author of a study of the flute's scale, Bob Fink,<br>the scale is diatonic minor with degrees 2 and 7 missing. (Though he admits<br>that the third is neutral, he says that the "limits are based on what an<br>average ear might notice as being in or out of tune.")<br><br>The article about the paper says:<br><br>"Fink added, "This is the most powerful practical evidence ever in support<br>of believing there is a natural or acoustical foundation to the evolution of<br>the diatonic scale." It is also in line with University of California's<br>(Berkeley) Prof. Anne D. Kilmer's deciphering of the world's oldest known<br>song from clay tablets, 4,000 years old, indicating the use of both harmony<br>and of the diatonic scale. It is also supported by recent psychological<br>studies by Trehub (U. of Toronto), Schellenberg (U. of Windsor), and Kagan<br>(Harvard) of infants. These studies (Vol. 7 #5 Sept '96 of "Psychological<br>Science") showed musically untutored infants preferred natural (acoustic)<br>intervals over dissonant intervals."<br><br>I won't quote the long article here, but his paper is at:<br><br>http://www.webster.sk.ca/greenwich/fl-compl.htm<br><br>Here is an excerpt:<br><br>    Holes 2, 3 & 4 on the bone (as shown, from left to right) stand in a<br>significant relationship to each other: The distance between holes 2 and 3<br>is virtually twice that between holes 3 and 4. The line-up of the holes<br>indicate that it is a flute.<br>    This means we are looking at a whole-tone and a half-tone somewhere within<br>a scale. Such a combination of whole-tone and half-tone is the heart and<br>soul of what makes up 7-note diatonic scales. Without making even one more<br>measurement beyond this, we can already conclude: These three notes on the<br>Neanderthal bone flute are inescapeably diatonic and will sound like a<br>near-perfect fit within ANY kind of standard diatonic scale, modern or<br>antique. We simply cannot conceive of it being otherwise, unless we deny it<br>is a flute at all. In essence, the whole story is simply that.<br>     Sometimes the simplicity of a situation, as outlined just above, is so<br>simple that we are unnecessarily suspicious of the obvious -- that it's just<br>"too easy" to accept it at first glance, and we tend to over-complicate<br>things to avoid appearing hasty. Therefore, many experiments and other<br>approaches were tried, but the simplicity of the issue remains intact.<br>     The remaining hole (left-most first hole on the picture) is the only clue<br>we have to answer the remaining questions, which is really the bulk of the<br>paper's subject. To those questions, as one can read, we have come up with a<br>fit to the Mi, Fa, Sol, La part of a minor scale, which includes a flatted<br>La and a "neutral" third for Mi, widely used in many cultures, sometimes<br>called a "blue" note (match no. 2 in the paper). Another match was also<br>considered viable (no. 1).<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
