"Perception and generalization of <br>frequency contours by a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)."<br>Journal of Comparative Psychology, 1995 Sep, v109 (n3):268-277.<br>    <br> Abstract: A single adult female bottlenose dolphin was tested in a <br>series of perceptual studies. On each trial, 4 sine-wave tones were <br>presented that contained a falling frequency contour or some other <br>contour. There were several frequency-transposed exemplars of each <br>contour type in each experiment. The dolphin discriminated contours <br>at a level significantly greater than chance in all experiments. In <br>the 1st 2 experiments, the dolphin demonstrated only modest transfer <br>to novel stimuli and a sensitivity to the absolute frequency of stimuli. <br>In the 3rd experiment, there was no effect of the absolute frequency of <br>stimuli; in the 4th experiment, the dolphin successfully transferred the <br>discrimination to novel stimuli drawn from the octave above the <br>previously heard range. These results demonstrate dolphins' capability <br>to perceive frequency contours, which may underlie the recognition of <br>conspecific whistles. <br><br>Cynx, Jeffrey. "Auditory frequency generalization and a failure to <br>find octave generalization in a songbird, the European starling <br>(Sturnus vulgaris)." Journal of Comparative Psychology, 1993 Jun, <br>v107 (n2):140-146.<br><br>Abstract: Examined frequency generalization in starlings (Sturnus <br>vulgaris) that were trained to discriminate between individual <br>frequencies. Starlings were tested for frequency generalization after <br>training on 2- and 3-tone discriminations. There was no evidence for <br>octave generalization, which is a hallmark of human absolute pitch <br>perception. This suggests that avian absolute pitch perception must not <br>be interpreted as identical with that in humans. A control experiment <br>with 1-tone discriminations indicated that the presence of lit response<br>keys affect the shape of the generalization gradients. Lit response keys <br>are a common feature in avian auditory perception experiments, and this <br>control experiment cautions that results may be affected by this <br>seemingly minor procedural change. <br><br>Hulse, Stewart H.; Humpal, John; Cynx, Jeffrey. "Discrimination and <br>generalization of rhythmic and arrhythmic sound patterns by European <br>starlings (Sturnus vulgaris)."    Music Perception, 1984 Summer, <br>v1 (n4):442-464.<br><br>Abstract: Investigated the ability of mature wild-caught European <br>starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to process acoustic patterns with <br>different, serially organized temporal structures. Four of the <br>Subjects were female; 2 were male. Subjects were taught to discriminate <br>patterns of 2000-Hz tones organized into rhythmic as compared with <br>random, arrhythmic temporal structures, and the perceptual processes <br>underlying the discrimination were analyzed. Subjects were required to <br>peck at one key in the presence of a rhythmic pattern and at another <br>in the presence of an arrhythmic pattern. Results show that all Subjects <br>learned to discriminate between rhythmic and arrhythmic patterns and <br>that discrimination accuracy was the same for linear and hierarchical <br>rhythmic structures. In a series of transfer tests that followed, <br>discrimination performance was tested when the temporal structure of <br>the rhythmic stimulus patterns was transformed and when the pitch was <br>shifted up or down 1 octave. Performance was well-maintained when <br>baseline temporal patterns were shifted 1 octave. Results suggest <br>that the Subjects solved the rhythmic-arrhythmic discrimination on <br>the basis of rhythmicity. <br><br><br>And now for something completely different, Gamelan tunings on<br>Roland synths, forwarded from the Gamelan List out of Dartmouth.<br><br>Date:    Sat, 13 Jul 1996 10:07:30 WIB<br>From:    Al Nurbandana <ALNURBA@MCSCPI.PTCPI.COM><br>Subject: Laras Gamelan in Roland 86<br><br>For those who like both the diatonic scales and the gamelan pentatonic<br>scale.<br><br>I just made tune adjustment in one of the program of my Roland 86 to<br>make the organ usable to play gamelan instruments with the pentatonic<br>music scales.<br><br>The basis of 'laras' gamelan is tone 6 (nem) and 2 (ro) for slendro,<br>pelog bem and pelog barang.  For scale 6, I use Bb with pitch adjusted<br>+47 steps higher - most gamelan has more or less laras 6 similar to that<br>tone.  For scale 2, I use Eb with pitch adjusted +37 steps higher.<br><br>Slendro scales:<br>1 = C# |  2 = Eb +37 |  3 = F# -33 |  5 = Ab +15 |  6 = Bb +47<br><br>Pelog Bem Scales:<br>1 = D |  2 = Eb +37 |  3 = F |  5 = A |  6 = Bb +47  ----> 4 = Ab +15<br><br>Pelog Barang Scales:<br>1 = C |  2 = Eb +37 |  3 = F |  5 = A |  6 = Bb +47  ----> 4 = Ab +15<br><br>It is obvious that laras gamelan is not a simple break of tones by half<br>like in a piano (both slendro and pelog).  Please explore and you will<br>see.  If you have a Roland E86, 'Happy trying !'.<br><br>Nuwun,<br>Al Nurbandana<br>Phone:(0761)594621,593402 Internet: alnurba%mcscpi.ptcpi.com<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Topic No. 5<br><br>Date:    Sat, 13 Jul 1996 04:11:44 -0400<br>From:    Tom Ross <rosst@UNVAX.UNION.EDU><br>Subject: Re: Laras Gamelan in Roland 86<br><br>Al: so far so good. But aren't instruments such as peking tuned sharper<br>than, say, slentem? What to do about that? Some synths, such as the EPS<br>16+ and Kurzweil 2000, allow overall ['global'] tuning, which I think<br>you're describing, as well as tuning of individual sounds or<br>'instruments.'<br><br>I assume the steps are tuning units, 1024 to the octave?,  or does<br>Roland use another system I'll post any reply to Tom Ross's question.<br><br>--John</div>
