It was not "Ensoniq" the<br>company that gave us their implementation -- it was Steven Curtin,<br>who was in charge of the tuning implementation while he worked there.<br>Likewise, E-mu's David Frost was more or less singlehandedly responsible<br>for the Proteus tuning implementation.  Tuning is not and never will be<br>a priority for a manufacturer.  The best we can hope for is a sympathetic<br>and knowledgable individual within a company who is willing to devote<br>his or her time and energy to make it happen.  Talking to programmers<br>is far more likely to be productive than talking to executives or<br>marketing types.</div><h3><a id=8096 href="#8096">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.

Her FAQ on Pythagorean tuning<br>>and harmony is superb. It also describes meantone and 12-tet<br>>from the point of view of medieval music.<br>><br>>See http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html.<br><br>This site is excellent and also describes many other important early<br>music tunings. Everyone should read it. I must now correct myself in TD<br>1367, where I wrote,<br><br>>the tuning of Grammateus, where the white keys are in meantone, and the<br>black keys divide the whole tones >exactly in half.<br><br>The white keys are actually in Pythagorean tuning. The resulting tuning<br>has 10 large and 2 small semitones, like the 12-out-of-22 tuning I<br>described.</div>
