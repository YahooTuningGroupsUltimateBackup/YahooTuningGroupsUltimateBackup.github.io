Just as the tritone<br>>bisects the octave, the neutral third bisects the perfect fifth.<br><br>>The neutral thirds of all the meantones, 12-TET, 31-TET, quartertones,<br>>Egyptian music, and others are roughly all in the same place because<br>the<br>>fifth is so etched in its shape.  The difference of a few cents in<br>either<br>>direction from 351 cents (at perfect fifth of 702 cents) is negligible<br>for<br>>musical purposes.<br><br>Though I'm not sure what the neutral third of 12-TET is, I basically<br>agree. However, there are tuning systems where the neutral third is not<br>dead center, such as Partch's, where an 11/9 (347 cents) is the neutral<br>third. But I think that musical uses of the neutral third tend to derive<br>from a logarithmic bisection of the perfect fifth, and not the 11/9<br>ratio.<br><br>In blues, the neutral third is very common, as is the neutral seventh,<br>which is a perfect fifth higher and acts as a sort of leading tone. I<br>think I might know something about the blues because I got a great<br>response from the audience at a recent gig at Buddy Guy's Legends. The<br>7/6 or some sort of sub-minor third does occur with some frequency,<br>though, and I at least hear some consonance when it falls over the IV<br>chord (so I use it there a lot). The 7/4 is least common of these but I<br>hear it used by gospel singers and harmonica players over the I and in<br>passing by guitarists bending up from the 6th to the flat 7th.</div>
