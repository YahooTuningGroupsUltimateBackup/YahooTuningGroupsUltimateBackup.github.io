I just played<br>>through a Fantasy ut, re mi etc, by John Bull from the Fitzwilliam<br>>collection.  There is a note:<br>><br>>'This interesting experiment in enharmonic modulation is thus   <br>tentatively<br>>expressed in the MS;  the passage proves that some kind of "equal<br>>temperament" must have been employed at this date.'<br>><br>>I doubt that it proves that.  But what temperament would have been<br>>characteristic of the time?<br><br>Quarter-comma meantone was nearly universal for keyboards at the time,   <br>and would be most appropriate for all of the Virginalist repertoire with   <br>one exception - that single piece by Bull.  There's nothing tentative   <br>about the enharmonic equivalence it assumes.  Among other things, there   <br>is an A - Db - E chord that must be considered the same as A - C# - E.   <br> Thus an extension to meantone would not work.<br><br>It certainly does not require equal temperament - any 12-note circulating   <br>one will do.  Personally, I think ET was most likely what Bull had in   <br>mind.  Mersenne had not yet published his string length figures, but as   <br>far as I am aware ET was the only circulating temperament being discussed   <br>at the time.<br><br>There was a discussion on the harpsichord list a while ago on what   <br>temperament to use for this piece.  Various people have successfully used   <br>everything from ET to one (the name of which escapes me at the moment)   <br>with 10 pure fifths and two 1/2-Pythagorean comma fifths.<br><br>Bull's fantasy was a one-time exception to the use of quarter-comma   <br>meantone, not to be repeated for almost a century.  Perhaps he did tune   <br>ET for the piece, but no one liked the sound of it?<br><br><br>Gordon Collins<br>gordon_collins@jhuapl.edu</div>
