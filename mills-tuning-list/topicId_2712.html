For a keyboard, this could mean equal temperament, it could mean<br>a well temperament where 6 of the fifths are diminished by 1/6 Pyth.<br>comma, and it could mean that he would have been satisfied with the<br>whole range of tunings between those extremes. For some very interesting<br>and compelling speculation about Bach's life experiences with tunings<br>and how these relate to his compositions, check out _J. S. Bach's<br>Critique of Pure Music_ by C. L. Van Panthaleon van Eck. Handel, I<br>believe, had stops on his organ to allow four of the chromatic notes to<br>be specified as either sharps or flats; thus he would have had 10 major<br>keys and 7 minor keys playable in meantone temperament. I don't think,<br>however, that he would have used more than 12 notes in any given piece.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
