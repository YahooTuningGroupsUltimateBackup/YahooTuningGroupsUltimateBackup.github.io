In 88CET, you can't, for example, have a subminor triad<br>spanning more than an octave, or a major triad spanning less than an octave.<br>The subminor third is only available within the first octave's span, and the<br>major third is only available in the second-octave's span as a major tenth.  <br><br>   What does this mean to a composer, other than the obvious fact that you have<br>to plan spacing and quality each in light of the other?  Does this pose<br>problems?  Certainly it can complicate some situations.  For example in<br>chorale-like, first-species counterpoint (and thus in a lot of small ensemble<br>compositions) you usually want most voices to move in small, smooth steps.<br>Suppose that all voices are closely spaced, forming a subminor triad.  It would<br>clearly be impossible to expand that subminor chord in small step-wise motion to<br>a major chord.  <br><br>   Still, that certainly doesn't prevent you from presenting the essential<br>sonority of a subminor chord moving to a major chord.  First of all, adding a<br>bass note at a fifth below the root of the subminor triad, doesn't change the<br>essential sonority of that triad very much.  That chord would then span over a<br>range of a major ninth, which can expand step-wise to a major tenth.  The root<br>of that subminor chord could even be a common tone between the two chords.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 8 Oct 1995 07:58 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA24971; Sat, 7 Oct 1995 22:58:14 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 7 Oct 1995 22:58:14 -0700<br>Message-Id: <01HW6IGUQNWY921T88@delphi.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2108 href="#2108">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/1995 11:45:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Brian's writings are a little like plastic explosives.  They come in many<br>shapes and forms, but no matter what shape they take, they detonate with<br>explosive force!  Usually this explosive force is one of amusement.  (Although I<br>think he's putting too much effort into pointing out who rather than what his<br>research disagrees with, but let's not get into that.)<br><br>   I think it's important to listen to his research carefully, because the<br>points he's raising are definitely meaningful.  But recall what I've mentioned<br>about Brian before:  When he gets into something, it becomes his entire world<br>for a while, and he sometimes loses perspective on the big picture.  <br><br>   It's worth asking exactly how the information in Brian's psychoacoustics<br>postings affects the art of composition.  I think that it helps in important,<br>but in more peripheral, ways than Brian seems to be suggesting.  <br><br>   Consider his points about whole-number-ratio harmony.  What did composers<br>know before?  We knew that whole-number ratios, up to a point, outline<br>meaningful harmonies.  And after all of these statistics about stretched<br>octaves, low-frequency effects, neuron firing rates, basilar membrane anatomy,<br>and so forth, what do we now know?  We find that whole-number ratios, up to a<br>point, outline meaningful harmonies.  Hmmm...  Sounds familiar, eh?!  <br><br>   What matters, I believe, is that we now know more detail about that point<br>exactly where the just-intonation model breaks down.  We shouldn't conclude from<br>this that the JI model is worthless.  I think it's pretty obvious from thousands<br>of years of history and individual exploration that it is meaningful.  But it's<br>only a model, and every model has its limits.  Brian's posts may help us find<br>those limits.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 8 Oct 1995 20:47 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA29047; Sun, 8 Oct 1995 11:47:19 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 8 Oct 1995 11:47:19 -0700<br>Message-Id: <951008184429_71670.2576_HHB28-2@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
