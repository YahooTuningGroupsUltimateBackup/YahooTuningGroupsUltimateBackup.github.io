Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/1998 1:41:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>This raises an interesting question: how _should_ we describe e-g-b-d'<br>>as a stable 20th-century sonority on a 12-tet organ or piano, say?<br>>Should we use "n-limit" terminology at all when the actual tuning in<br>>question doesn't really fit such a model, and more closely fits<br>>3-limit than 5-limit or 7-limit/9-limit?<br><br>Does the 12-tET major third, for example more closely fit the<br>3-(prime)-limit or the 5-(prime)-limit? Beyond 5:4 and 81:64, one can<br>use very complex ratios of either prime limit to approximate the 12-tET<br>arbitrarily closely, and your recent posting of a 5-(prime)-limit<br>approximation to 12-tET shows that you are at least partially aware of<br>this fact. (BTW, Helmholtz/Ellis have precedence over you in the<br>"Schulter Artusian 5-limit Just" tuning.) But perceptually, it is only<br>the simplest ratios which determine the character of an interval or<br>chord, even if the exact tuning is off by a sixth-tone or even a<br>third-tone. So the 3-(prime) limit description of the minor seventh<br>chord seems quite irrelevant despite its closeness, while the 5- and<br>7-(prime) limit descriptions both have some relevance, I feel, to the<br>way the 12-tET minor seventh chord is perceived, and the way it is often<br>performed on free-pitched instruments. In this context (namely, that of<br>describing individual sonorities), I believe the odd limit to be of more<br>utility. The odd limits of the aforementioned JI descriptions (whose<br>prime limits are 3, 5, and 7) are 81, 9, and 9, respectively. This gives<br>a much better idea as to the perceptual relevance of these descriptions<br>than the prime limit.</div>
