This became clear to me during a discussion I had with<br>Paul E. some time ago.  Thinking back over that, it seems to me<br>that our differences of opinion on the subject of the length of<br>LCM patterns was mostly due to different assumptions about ratio<br>invariance.  I was assuming ratio invariance, he was not.  I'm<br>still not absolutely clear on all this and would appreciate any<br>comments.<br><br>Aliquot parts are simply a list of all the possible numbers that<br>can be derived by multiplying subsets of the prime factors of a<br>given number.  For example, here is a list of the aliquot parts<br>of 2880:<br><br>1 1<br>2 2<br>3 3<br>4 2^2<br>5 5<br>6 2*3<br>8 2^3<br>9 3^2<br>10 2*5<br>12 2^2*3<br>15 3*5<br>16 2^4<br>18 2*3^2<br>20 2^2*5<br>24 2^3*3<br>30 2*3*5<br>32 2^5<br>36 2^2*3^2<br>40 2^3*5<br>45 3^2*5<br>48 2^4*3<br>60 2^2*3*5<br>64 2^6<br>72 2^3*3^2<br>80 2^4*5<br>90 2*3^2*5<br>96 2^5*3<br>120 2^3*3*5<br>144 2^4*3^2<br>160 2^5*5<br>180 2^2*3^2*5<br>192 2^6*3<br>240 2^4*3*5<br>288 2^5*3^2<br>320 2^6*5<br>360 2^3*3^2*5<br>480 2^5*3*5<br>576 2^6*3^2<br>720 2^4*3^2*5<br>960 2^6*3*5<br>1440 2^5*3^2*5<br>2880 2^6*3^2*5<br><br>This list contains the seven-tone Zarlino scale, and 2880 is the<br>LCM of that scale.  That is not a coincidence.  A list of aliquot<br>parts contains all the scales that can be made from a given LCM.<br><br>Most of the utilities distributed with my FasTrak Sequencer use<br>this principle.<br><br>To classify the chords in a given scale, I just sort them by<br>their LCM's, or by their pattern length, if I do not want to<br>think in terms of ratio invariance.  I find this to be much<br>simpler and easier to work with than multidimensional ratio<br>analysis.<br><br>But the big advantage, from my exact JI point of view, is that it<br>gives me an easy way to analyze the musical possibilities of a<br>given frequency divider network, and all modern electronic<br>musical instruments use some form of frequency division in the<br>sense that all the musical output is phase locked to some high<br>frequency signal in the system, therefore these systems have the<br>capability of producing exact musical intervals if programmed<br>properly.<br><br>Note that octave inversion of a chord can double its LCM.<br><br>Marion<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 1 Jul 1997 15:10 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA15776; Tue, 1 Jul 1997 15:10:43 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 1 Jul 1997 15:10:43 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA15771<br>Received: (qmail 10512 invoked from network); 1 Jul 1997 13:10:35 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 1 Jul 1997 13:10:35 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541104afdf033119ea@DialupEudora><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5720 href="#5720">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>7/1/1997 7:24:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Edward Remler <ataraxy@erols.com> asks<br><br>> 1) Well Temperament arose in the latter half of the 17th century and<br>> Bach attempted to popularize it circa 1716 with his first WTC.<br>> Presumably the further a pieceï¿½s key is removed from C, the stranger it> will sound to the modern ear, but I have never heard the preludes and<br>> fugues played on a well tempered instrument.

In fact, it is such a commonplace that it won't normally<br>get mentioned in the liner notes - but is immediately audible. Starting<br>with Dutch early music specialists in the sixties, most professional<br>harpsichordists and fortepianists have done their own tuning, and usuallywith a single tuning fork (typically using the A440A as Bb to get something<br>something close to A415). Learning to set meantone, a Kirnberger or a<br>Werkmeister by ear isn't terribly hard - while tuning 12tet is really<br>specialist work unless you're using a digital tuner or a strobe.<br><br>At both of my Universities in the States, and here at the Frankfurt<br>Musikhochschule, the early keyboard faculty and students are themselves<br>responsible for tuning the instruments. There has been some influence on<br>the piano world as well - Keith Jarrett, enthused by Lou Harrison's<br>_Concerto for Piano with Selected Orchestra_ keeps a piano tuned (by<br>himself) in Kirnberger II, and has released recordings using it.<br><br>In the organ world, it has become standard practice to build new or to<br>restore old tracker organs in historical tunings, in some cases with split<br>keys. The Oregonian composer Douglas Leedy has made a small career out ofcommissions for new pieces for new organs in historical temperaments. Along<br>these lines, I guess that Ligeti's _Passacaglia Ungarese_ was the first<br>work in this century to be composed specifically for a meantone instrument<br>(Harpsichord).<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 1 Jul 1997 18:20 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03046; Tue, 1 Jul 1997 18:20:45 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 1 Jul 1997 18:20:45 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03037<br>Received: (qmail 21932 invoked from network); 1 Jul 1997 16:17:45 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 1 Jul 1997 16:17:45 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.95.970701120523.28436A-100000@sunspot.tiac.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
