Please <br>correct me where wrong, Jon.  Regarding my writing to the list, I just <br>returned from 3 weeks away and responded in the most direct way I know <br>how.  Thankfully, due to the powers of the internet, I have had my say <br>and will now move on to other topics...unless specifically encouraged <br>otherwise.  Also for the record, I have only admiration for the work <br>Jon Szanto has performed in presenting Partch's music.  It is only the <br>ideology that I object to.
