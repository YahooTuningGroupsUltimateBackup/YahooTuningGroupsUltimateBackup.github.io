Stuart plays with Deep Listening Band amongst other groups.<br><br>Any interested trombonist with a good ear can do terrific things in JI as I<br>had in a concert recently of a piece of mine.  We played 7, 11, 13th<br>harmonics and so on in various keys.<br><br>Sorry I don't know what is meant by adaptive tuning techniques, but check<br>out Stuart.<br><br>Michael Dixon</div>
