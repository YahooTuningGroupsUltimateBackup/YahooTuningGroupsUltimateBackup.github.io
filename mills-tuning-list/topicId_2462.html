Let's say you have<br>>a fairly dense arrangement with 20 notes on 10 MIDI channels sounding<br>>as you modulate to another tonic.  It takes, not counting the actual<br>>note ons, 320 us per byte x 12 bytes per message x 20 sysex messages =<br>>76.8 milliseconds to send the updated tunings to the various<br>>instruments.  This is clearly not adequate.<br><br>The 20 sounding notes receive no sysex.  Only when a note is struck does<br>it need a prefixed sysex real-time pitch-change message.  The combo is<br>essentially a 15-byte note-on including high-precision frequency data.<br>Bandwidth really isn't the issue here, unless you think a (320us * 15<br>bytes = 4.8ms) delay on a note is a problem.  (And if you do, you should<br>be aware that that degree of slop is more or less average for MIDI<br>equipment.)<br><br>>If I want sustaining notes to hold their current tuning while sounding<br>>new notes in a new scale, what are my options?  If it's back to the<br>>individual sysex messages per note, I'll need some MIDI Draino to unclog<br>>the limited bandwidth.<br><br>You strike a note on your keyboard; a MIDI note-on goes out to some<br>computer host.  Software gets the note-on, figures out what frequency<br>you want, and prefixes a 12-byte frequency message to the note-on,<br>passing the combo on to audio hardware.  (If that particular MIDI note<br>number is already sounding on the channel requested, software changes<br>the struck note number.  Note number is independent of pitch in the<br>Tuning Spec.  The only limit is the MIDI limit of 128 notes per<br>channel.)  Sustaining notes aren't affected at all.<br><br>So yes, it is back to individual sysex messages per note.  A pain in the<br>neck to type into a sequencer, for sure.  It would be much nicer if we could<br>compel every manufacturer to include 64 or 255 tuning tables, all accessible<br>and switchable the same way.  We can't, so instead we wrote a (mostly<br>ignored and obsolescent) standard so that at least the sysex codes might be<br>the same for different instruments.<br><br>Still, to use the standard practically for dynamic JI you need some<br>software pre-processing tool (like Justonic).  But the problem shouldn't<br>be MIDI bandwidth.<br><br>Am I being clear, or have I missed something?<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Mark Nowitzky <nowitzky@pacificnet.net><br>Subject:  Ben Denckla's Masters Thesis<br>PostedDate:  01-10-97 12:17:27<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  01-10-97 12:17:15-01-10-97 12:17:16,01-10-97 12:16:12-01-10-97 12:16:13<br>DeliveredDate:  01-10-97 12:16:13<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256523.00387E19; Wed, 1 Oct 1997 12:17:03 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03578; Wed, 1 Oct 1997 12:17:27 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 1 Oct 1997 12:17:27 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03572<br>Received: (qmail 21437 invoked from network); 1 Oct 1997 03:17:19 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 1 Oct 1997 03:17:19 -0700<br>Message-Id: <2.2.16.19970930031252.0ae70360@pacificnet.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
