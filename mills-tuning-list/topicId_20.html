In a very<br>> careful, meticulous manner Rasch looks at many myths, fictions,<br>> and misconceptions about temperament and Bach.<br><br>On your suggestion, I found and read this article.  It's interesting,<br>but there are a few points that I think he doesn't argue as convincingly<br>as he thinks he does.<br><br>> some of his points (I'm<br>> recalling from memory) include: there is no reason to associate Werckmeister<br>> III with Bach (W. in fact had other temperaments, including ET);<br><br>This is true, and a lot of other writers mention ET as well.  (But I do<br>find a little questionable when Rasch says "hey, look at all these<br>theorists who recommend ET" when he has obviously just gone through and<br>selected out the (equally) many who don't.)  However, ET is really a<br>pretty obvious solution once you begin considering the question of the<br>disposition of the comma.  OTOH, the most obvious method isn't always<br>the best one.  ET is probably the hardest temperament of all to set<br>accurately by ear.  Recall that Bach was reputed to be able to tune his<br>harpsichord in fifteen minutes.  I'd like to see anyone who could set a<br>good ET in that time; even the best tuners I've seen take much longer<br>than that.<br><br>> there is no<br>> justification or rationale for the Barnes-Bach temperament (Barnes'<br>> methodology is subjective, his sample too [small]),<br><br>Rasch does raise some signficant issues about Barnes' work, but I would<br>note that Barnes says straight out in his own article that the sample is<br>too small to be conclusive statistically.  But if we required the level<br>of rigor in musicology that physicists do, I shudder to think how many<br>(few) articles would get published.<br><br>> that all the contemporary<br>> statements about Bach's tuning practice (for stringed keyboards, of course)<br>> suggest equal temperament.<br><br>With all respect, the evidence is hardly as conclusive as Rasch would<br>have us believe.  There are many possible interpretations even for<br>some of the evidence he cites.  Example: he quotes the following<br>passage from Forkel's biography:<br><br>: Nobody could have any thanks for quilling his harpsichord for him; he<br>: always did it himself.  Also the tuning of his harpsichord and<br>: clavichord was his own affair, and he was so practised in this work<br>: that it did not take him more than a quarter of an hour.  But then,<br>: when he improvised, all twenty-four keys were his; he could do with<br>: them what he wanted.  He connected the most remote keys together as<br>: easily and naturally as the nearest; one could believe he was<br>: modulating only in the inner circle of a single key.<br><br>He then concludes that the last two sentences indicate that all keys<br>sounded the same in Bach's tuning.  However, is it not as plausible that<br>Forkel is praising Bach's skill in improvising smooth modulations?<br><br>> Two quotes Ihave ready-to-hand: "equal temperament<br>> was becoming the norm for tuning during the second half of the eighteenth<br>> century"<br><br>Too bad Bach died in 1750, huh?<br><br>To be fair, Rasch says this in order to argue that if WTK _were_ in fact<br>for an unequal temperament, those later theorists for whom ET was "the<br>norm" would have remarked on the fact.  Still, those theorists didn't<br>have any more evidence than we do.<br><br>> and "equal temperament has been described and discussed so often<br>> in eighteenth-century writings as a practical system that it must have<br>> played an important part in musical performance."<br><br>See above.  Just because it's an obvious theoretical solution doesn't<br>mean it was practical, or that there weren't other factors weighing<br>against it.<br><br>[snip the rest]<br><br>--pH (manynote@library.wustl.edu or http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote)<br>       O<br>      /\             "Foul?

This is true in both equal temperament _and_ Werckmeister <br>III.  The Werckmeister III contains 4 sizes of major third, one of which <br>is equivilent to 402 cents, one that is Pythagorian at 408 cents, <br>one at 396 cents, and the smallest one at 390 - all sharper than the just <br>386 cents.<br><br>Further, Kirnberger himself gave directions for the tempered fifth whose <br>ratio (10935:16384) is almost exactly 1/12 of a comma smaller than the <br>pure fifth in several publications, including his *Von der Temperatur*.  <br>The method by which he arrived was to take seven pure fifths in <br>succession plus one pure major third.  This gives the tempered fourth <br>8192:10935, which is larger than the pure fourth by 1/12 of a comma, its <br>inversion is the tempered fifth 10935:16384.  <br><br>According to Kirnberger he <br>showed this discovery to Leonhard Euler in 1766 and remarked to him that <br>this fifth could be used to determine all ratios of equal temperament, <br>an idea subsequently developed by Johann Heinrich Lambert and published <br>in the *Memoires de l'academie royale des sciences et belle lettres* <br>(Berlin 1774) and used by Marpaug against Kirnberger.  (see p. 20 of the <br>*Art of Strict Musical Composition* by Kirnberger, Yale University Press)<br><br>There is great bitterness against Kirnberger, chief violinist and <br>keyboardist at the court in Berlin by Marpaug, the Lottery King Of Berlin.<br><br>Clearly, this argument of fifths over thirds is an aesthetic battle of <br>historic proportions.  Politics enters at every level and success is oft <br>measured by clout.  What intrigues me most about Prof. Rasch's <br>perspective is that the Netherlands has been a leader in performing <br>"early music" in historic intonation and as its main musical intellectual <br>in this area, Rasch bucked the trend.  Perhaps if he were in any one of <br>the other countries that had been resistant to historic intonation <br>systems, he might have headed the other way.  <br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@ios.com<br><br><br>p.s.

When Werckmeister wrote in 1691 _Musical Temperament_ he<br>provided the first description of a "correct" tuning that played in a full<br>cycle of keys.

Werckmeister II is quarter-comma<br>meantone.<br><br>The largest discussion in _Musical Temperament_ centers on what has come<br>to be known as "Werckmeister III".  The author didn't name the "good<br>temperament" but merely described a popular tuning of the middle baroque<br>in Thuringia and throughout German lands (definitiely including<br>Danish-speaking Lubeck where Dietrich Buxtehude was an ardant Werckmeister<br>fan.)  (And of course Bach almost lost employment for just taking off to<br>Lubeck to see Buxtehude play in person.)<br><br>Werckmeister embarrassingly met the charge that 12ET was nowhere to be<br>found in his privately-produced publication by claiming that the<br>"engraver" of his monochord drawings refused to draw it!  (This is<br>described in the New Grove article "temperament."  Though there are<br>alternate well-temperament arrangements outlined that might now be called<br>Werckmeister IV, V, and VI, these are given relative short shrift by the<br>author.  Werckmeister III is the prominent well temperament tuning current<br>in Bach's Thuringia and is more than half the monograph.<br><br>J.S. Bach lived for a number of years with his cousin Johann Walter (an<br>organist, composer, author of the first major German language music<br>encyclopedia, and former student of Werckmeister).  Walter would receive<br>letters and music from his older friend Werckmeister.  Do you think Bach<br>could ignore the famous Werckmeister?  He couldn't help but tune only to<br>his own satisfaction, clearly accepting on some level the pronouncements<br>of Thuringia's leading organ designer and organist of an earlier<br>generation.
