Ben Johnston does<br>not have priority in presenting his tunings as lattices. There is a long<br>German tradition of presenting tonal functions in terms of positions on<br>lattices of 2 or more dimensions. Even Schoenberg, coming from the Austrian<br>scale-step function theory, uses lattices in his _Structural Functions of<br>Harmony_. These lattices are identified immediately with Just Intonation<br>and later mapped onto the temperament at hand. Moreover, it is not uncommon<br>to see the rows in the lattices shifted so that Major triads are<br>upward-pointing triangles, and minor triads point downward. (One of Martin<br>Vogel*s students has written a dissertation documenting some 130 years of<br>lattices illustrating tonal functions).<br><br>One of the reasons that Jim Tenneyï¿½s Darmstadt lectures were met with such<br>reserve four years ago is that his excited presentation of his tonal<br>lattice was like an elementary - and old fashioned - harmony lesson to much<br>of his audience. This was  a shame, because Jim has raised some interesting<br>aesthetic issues and drawn exciting compositional implications from his<br>research. <br><br>On a different theme, I had some conversations with Scott Hackleman in<br>April about the possibility of his building 17, 19- or 22- tone keyboards<br>along the line of his famed clavichord, but used to trigger midi-keys.<br>Whether this would be a simple on/off arrangement or touch sensitive was<br>left open in our discussion. I was interested in this possibility because<br>it seems that around 19 tones is nearly ideal, provided one had the<br>capacity through software to modulate, and the Hackleman-Wilson keys are<br>wonderful to play, with the feel of something real under the fingers. The<br>question I have not been able to answer concerns the possibility of<br>dismantling one or two cheap midi keyboards and attaching their switches to<br>the Hackleman keys. Has anyone ever ventured such a project? I have not got<br>a midi keyboard here to tear apart...<br><br>Daniel Wolf <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 12 Nov 1996 14:48 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01267; Tue, 12 Nov 1996 14:49:08 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01260<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id FAA01065; Tue, 12 Nov 1996 05:49:05 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 12 Nov 1996 05:49:05 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199611121345.VAA04050@hk.super.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
