It is a <br>from an interview by Mitch Corber with John Cage.<br><br>JOHN CAGE: Do you want me to read the questions [aloud]?  (pause) I like <br>this one: "Do you consider yourself a microtonal composer?"<br><br>Well, I think of the field of sound as not having discrete steps in it.  <br>Scales make discrete steps, and modes and so forth.  But I like to think <br>of it as a field on which one could land at any point; and you can do <br>that, of course, with dials.  With our technology, we're living in a <br>period where you can have a pitch at any point.<br><br>MC: And this is called microtonality?<br><br>JC: It could be called that.  Or you could say that if you look at the <br>history of intervals, you could say that intervals have gotten more and <br>more close together.<br><br>[later in the interview]<br><br>MC: Was there a certain friction between you [and Partch]?<br><br>JC: He didn't like my work.<br><br>MC: Did you think this was a cursory take on it?<br><br>JC: No, he simply didn't like it.  I think he didn't like the use of <br>chance operations, and I don't think he liked my attitude toward pitch, <br>which is, as i told you, an attitude toward a field of possibilities; <br>whereas for Harry Partch, there had to be particular discrete steps in <br>that field, and you had to be on the _right_ ones, so that certain sounds <br>for him were right, and all the otherws were wrong.  I don't know the <br>difference between a right pitch and a wrong pitch.<br><br>MC: Do you believe Partch actually heard these tiny differences?<br><br>JC: Of course he did.<br><br>MC: Would you say he had an exceptional ear, then?<br><br>JC: I think many people have exceptional ears.  David Tudor had what's <br>called a "golden ear," and the term is used when they test to see how <br>many vibrations you can distinguis...how closely you can distinguish <br>different numbers of bibrations.  And we worked very closely together.  <br>So, since he had a golden ear, I never felt that I had to have one that <br>was that special.
