I post a short statistical summary<br>of the Tuning list.  It seems that as the list approaches Digest 1000<br>(just three more to go!) such a posting would be appropriate, with<br>perhaps a bit of historical stuff.<br><br>The list was started on February 2 1994 by Greg Higgs and myself, and<br>announced on USENET.  By the Feb 3 we were congratulating ourselves<br>because we had 25 subscribers!  In less than a year, the list had grown<br>and brought the machine it was originally implemented on (a NeXT "Turbo<br>slab") to a virtual standstill, so it was moved to its current home<br>(eartha@mills.edu).<br><br>As of Feb 23rd, 1997, the list had 350 subscribers, distributed around the<br>globe/nets as follows.  (List membership normally oscillates between a<br>high of about 360 and a low of about 325.  That is, it is about 90%<br>stable.)<br><br>Austria 3, Australia 18, Canada 13, Switzerland 2, Commercial Providers<br>100, Germany 12, US Education 101, Spain 3, Finland 1, France 4, US<br>Government 2, Greece 2, Hong Kong 2, India 1, Italy 2, Japan 4, Korea<br>1, US Military 1, Mexico 1, "Network (.net)" 30, the Netherlands 10,<br>Norway 1, Non-profit Organizations 9, Poland 1, Sweden 3, Singapore 1,<br>United Kingdom 20, "United States" 1, South Africa 1.<br><br>(Note: there is no way of geographically locating the "Commercial"<br>subscribers, although a majority seem to be in English speaking<br>countries.)<br><br>I would like to comment here that, although the US Education subscribers<br>have the barest of pluralities(!), the shift toward commercial and<br>international subscribers over the last couple of years has been<br>dramatic.  It seems that for the first year or so, about 75-80% of the<br>subscribers were US Education (.edu).  Now they are about 28%.<br><br>There have been 5695 messages posted to the list, and the archive now<br>contains 15.3 Megabytes of data (including mail headers, etc.).<br><br>The list physically resides at Mills College in Oakland, California, USA,<br>currently on an SGI Indy.  Oakland is across the Bay from San Francisco.<br><br>Dave Madole<br>Technical Director, Center for Contemporary Music<br>Listserv Administrator<br><br>Mills College<br>Oakland, CA 94613<br>510-430-2336<br><br>madole@mills.edu<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 25 Feb 1997 21:31 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01024; Tue, 25 Feb 1997 21:31:18 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00967<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id MAA26713; Tue, 25 Feb 1997 12:29:00 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 25 Feb 1997 12:29:00 -0800<br>Message-Id: <331343A5.2017@dial.pipex.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4899 href="#4899">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>2/26/1997 7:21:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com><br><br>>>The whole point is that it doesn't matter what the exact form dissonance<br>>>function is!

But one is naturally<br>curious. Since a meantone tuning is generated by the (flattened) perfect<br>fifth, which we will represent by v, express these intervals in terms of<br>that fifth. Since were are assuming a tuning with perfect octaves, it<br>doesn't matter which octave inversion or extension of the consonant<br>intervals we examine.

A good start might be Juan Roederer's "Introduction to the Psychophysics<br>of Music." I posted some of my musings, complete with mathematical<br>derivations, a few months ago. This procedure I extended from intervals to<br>chords with a kludge. I would now like to make this more rigorous, but I<br>need to drop the assumption that ratios are always expressed in lowest<br>terms. (This was a nice assumption because it allowed be to use the theory<br>of rational approximations. There is no theory of rational approximations<br>for ratios of three of more numbers. Graphing x/y vs. x/z for all<br>combinations of x, y, and z integers less than N (N fixed) will give you<br>some idea why no such theory exists. There is evidence (including personal<br>experience) that even a rich complex tone, played quietly and in the<br>presence of noise, can sometimes be interpreted as harmonics 2, 4, 6, 8, . . <br>., or even 3, 6, 9, 12, . . . of the consciously perceived fundamental. The<br>lowest-terms restriction would not allow for these phenomena.) Anyway, I'm<br>sort of not working on this now, but J. Kukula has suggested that wavelet<br>theory might be useful.<br><br>Brian McLaren has made the observation that "scientific" models of<br>perception and cognition are continously revised to reflect the mathematics<br>and computer science in vogue at the time. Rather than take this as evidence <br>for a Kuhnian attack on these models, I would suggest that they represent<br>successively better approximations to the truth, just as Newtonian physics<br>remains a good approximation though relativity and quantum mechanics are far <br>more accurate. So, when I cite the results of Goldstein, J. L. 1973. "An<br>optimum processor theory for the central formation of the pitch of complex<br>tones." J. Acoust. Soc. Amer. Vol. 54 p. 1499, and I often do, I realize<br>that there may be improvements to the model, but as a first-order<br>approximation, it fit the data quite well.<br><br>Where has Brian been lately? I sort of miss him in a weird way. I kind of<br>wanted to respond to his assertion that neutral thirds are more consonant<br>than tritones by saying that, for tones with strong third partials and weak<br>fifth partials, he is certainly right, if a roughness-type definition of<br>consonance (based on Plomp and Levelt's critical bands) is used. The reason<br>many objected is that when gradually changing the size of the interval, the<br>_local_ minimum of dissonance achieved around the 7:5 is much more distinct<br>than that achieved at the 11:9. In an absolute sense, however, the 7:5 may<br>be more dissonant.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 04:23 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12641; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 04:23:57 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12638<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id TAA29517; Wed, 26 Feb 1997 19:22:26 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 26 Feb 1997 19:22:26 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B07BF6D01BDBD.5C04@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
