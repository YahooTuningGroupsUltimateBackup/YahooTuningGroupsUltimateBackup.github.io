Jennings, one of the<br>earliest minimalist composers, performed and<br>recorded with La Monte Young in the '50s, '60s<br>and '70s. Curtis has studied the interpretation of<br>Jennings' music with Young for ten years and<br>has presented Jennings' compositions in<br>numerous concerts, including performances with<br>Young. <br><br>Friday, June 19, 8:00 pm<br>in the Dream House<br>275 Church Street, 3rd Floor <br>$12 / $9 MELA members<br><br><br>Michael J.

A<br>computer produces wave after wave of a big,<br>bassy sonic ocean, literally vibrating the guts of<br>the listener. The piece is randomly generated in<br>"real time" using the six prime numbers that are<br>the rhythmic basis of all of Schumacher's sound<br>environments: 13, 17, 23, 29, 37 and 43. By<br>using complex algorithms, the sound remains in<br>constant flux, and the many resulting combination<br>tones create a wild, raging aural seascape.<br><br>Sunday, June 21, 2:00 pm - Midnight<br>in the Dream House<br>275 Church Street, 3rd Floor<br>$4 / $3 MELA members <br><br><br>La Monte Young   Marian Zazeela       <br>Dream House: Seven Years of Sound and Light<br><br>Now in its fifth season, the Dream House has<br>become known as a sound and light oasis in the<br>parched desert of serious artistic encounters. "A<br>magical place," Paul Griffiths, The New Yorker. "A<br>wild frontier of tonality that has never been<br>explored, the outer edge of consonance," Kyle<br>Gann, The Village Voice. "The Dream House is a<br>unique life experience that you will remember for<br>years, and one that you will probably return to<br>time and again. It's a great place to celebrate,<br>reflect, create, rest, mourn, analyze, energize,<br>focus, wander, and revitalize."
