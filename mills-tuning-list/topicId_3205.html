This triad resonates clearly<br>and forms a polyharmonic structure against the root. Tuning the triad<br>27:34:40 would destroy this effect and render the chord pretty ugly<br>(IMO). Hence in this case the maj. 13th should be 5/3 and the min. 9th<br>should be 25/12.<br><br>2. sharp11flat9 (meaning: root, maj. 3rd, min. 7th, min. 9th, aug. 11th)<br><br>Here, there is a strongly resonating dominant seventh chord formed on<br>the aug. 11th with the min. 7th, min. 9th, and maj. 3rd. If we fix the<br>maj. 3rd at 5/4, then the aug. 11th should be 10/7, the min. 7th should<br>be 25/14, and the min. 9th should be 15/7. Of course, the fact that the<br>min. 7th is also close to 7/4 helps to reinforce the root along with the<br>maj. 3rd. It is very common in jazz to have a maj. 3rd - min. 7th<br>tritone imply two different roots, one with their traditional roles and<br>one with their roles reversed. This requires a tuning, such as 12tET,<br>where the 50:49 "septimal sixth-tone" vanishes.<br><br>3. 6/9 (meaning root, maj. 3rd, perf. 5th. maj. 6th, maj. 9th)<br><br>Here, we have a chain of 5ths, but also a major 3rd and two minor<br>thirds. If all these intervals are to be consonant, no just<br>interpretation will really do. This chord requires a tuning where the<br>80:81 syntonic comma vanishes.<br><br>Other examples can be pointed out, but I think that's enough to make my<br>point for now.<br><br>By the way, the simplest ET consistent in the 19-limit is 80tET.</div><h3><a id=7790 href="#7790">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.

But add some more notes, and it<br>>becomes fairly easy to compare the qualities heard in comparing<br>>various intervals.<br><br>I would agree that stacking 5 notes in consecutive perfect fifths, one<br>hears a chord with a great deal of perfect-fifthness to it. The 81/64<br>itself is rather irrelavant. Maybe I picked too tautological an example.<br>Got a better one?<br><br>>(I'd really like to see more feedback about microtonality in<br>>the blues.)<br><br>I think this is a great topic, but I don't think ratios of large numbers<br>have much to do with it.

Tonal harmony, as used during the so-called<br>>"common practice" period 1600-1900, developed mainly out of<br>>the fixing of pitches as absolute values (especially in notation),<br>>the recognition of 5-limit ratios as consonances, and the intuitive<br>>realization that because ratios have two terms, they are<br>>related to other ratios in two different ways (Partch's<br>>"Basic Monophonic Concept #2": "every ratio of a Monophonic<br>>system is at least a dual identity"; "Genesis", p. 88), giving<br>>rise to the major/ minor system.<br><br>>In fact, assuming a tuning in 5-limit JI (or a meantone<br>>which approximates 5-ratios well), the tritone could be one<br>>of four ratios, all of which, while much less dissonant than<br>>the Pythagorean tritones:<br>>3^6		729/512		6.12	aug 4th<br>>3^-6		1024/729	5.88	dim 5th<br>>were pretty much at, if not beyond, the limit of what could<br>>be considered consonant:<br>>3^2 * 5^-2	36/25	6.31	dim 5th<br>>3^-2 * 5^-1	64/45	6.10	dim 5th<br>>3^2 * 5^1	45/32	5.90	aug 4th<br>>3^-2 * 5^2	25/18	5.69	aug 4th<br><br>>The 64/45 would normally be considered the tritone which appears<br>>in the 5-limit Dominant 7th chord of 36:45:54:64.  4:5:6:7 is the<br>>same as 36:45:54:63.<br><br>This whole argument smacks of what I object to in the prime-limit<br>theoreticians' approach. Harmonically speaking, an interval is never<br>more likely to be interpreted as a higher-odd-limit, lower-prime-limit<br>ratio than a higher-prime-limit, lower odd-limit ratio, holding the<br>approximation error constant. I think the four 5-prime-limit ratios you<br>listed have very little to do with the way a tritone is heard<br>harmonically, even if tuned to exactly those ratios. Although I agree<br>that the Pythagorean tritones, despite their low prime limit, are very<br>dissonant, I don't think the JI tritones are "much" more consonant. In<br>fact, they may even be more dissonant, since the Pythagoean tritones<br>approximate simple 7-limit ratios better.<br><br>Anyway, I maintain that the fact that the tritones reinforced the root<br>of the dominant chord when combined with it harmonically helped to<br>define major and minor as the "tonal modes", while other modes without<br>such harmonic-melodic focus fell out of use.</div><h3><a id=7883 href="#7883">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.

Lemme see some numbers.<br><br>The experiments that Ken Wauchope and I both did (independently) are one<br>bit of tangential evidence. The problem is that it's hard to come up<br>with an experimental test of what ratio is implied, acoustically, by a<br>given interval. But there are mathematical ways of defining such things,<br>such as which pair of overtones is beating most slowly, etc., and<br>anything reasonable along those lines will favor something like an<br>integer-limit rule. Superimposing octave equivalence then brings you<br>from interger-limits to odd-limits.<br><br>>Well, Paul, the reason you say these things is because you favor<br>>ETs, where you must be concerned with consistency, approximations,<br>>etc.<br><br>No!<br><br>>In real just tuning, the differences are quite audible.<br><br>I agree that the differences are audible<br><br>>The<br>>5-limit<br>>tritones provide a biting dissonance in the "dominant 7th" chord<br>>that *demand* resolution onto the major or minor triad on the "tonic".<br><br>I agree that you wouldn't want the 7-limit approximations to be too<br>smooth -- that would take away from the need to resolve. However, the<br>tritones are not, in any relevant harmonic sense, 5-limit.<br><br>>A perfectly tuned 4:5:6:7 chord is only a tiny bit less consonant<br>>than a plain old 4:5:6 triad.  There's a big difference in the sound<br>>and feel from the 3- and 5-limit "dominant 7th"s, provided they are<br>>in perfect tune also.  And we're not talking about the tritone dyad<br>>by itself, we're talking about a 4-part chord.<br><br>Right. I think that the dominant 7th arises because it can be formed<br>from diatonic scale steps. The diatonic scale admits a wide range of<br>tunings, and the dominant 7th "works" in virtually all of them. Pinning<br>its tritone down to some complex ratio has no acoustical relevance. Even<br>contextual relevance is suspect since the diatonic scale in<br>common-practice music requires the vanishing of the syntonic comma, so<br>whatever ratio you give, I can probably give you another one, differing<br>by 81:80, that has as much contextual meaning.</div>
