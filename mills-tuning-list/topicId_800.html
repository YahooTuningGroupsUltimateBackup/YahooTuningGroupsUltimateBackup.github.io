I get the feeling the answer is no...and Albert was<br>an innovator in blues...he created one of the most powerful and unique<br>voices in the genre, and influenced Hendrix greatly. Of course, Partch<br>was an innovator...but, again, I see him more as a theoretical genius<br>than one who touches me on any profound spiritual or emotional levels.<br>Partch reminds me, in a way, of Johnny Smith, the well known jazz<br>guitarist...Smith makes folks pee with his technique, but I saw him<br>twice and he was a boring MF. Partch is surely not boring, but I sure<br>don't feel his music hits those deep, deep levels where the Creator<br>dwells...bitterness and bleakness are very present in a lot of Uncle<br>Harry's music, I feel, and that ain't the final destination...besides,<br>could he play his cloud chamber bowls behind his head, like T-Bone<br>Walker did with his guitar, or could he duckwalk with his kithara like<br>Chuck Berry?...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 29 Aug 1996 15:02 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05812; Thu, 29 Aug 1996 15:03:39 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05818<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id GAA27271; Thu, 29 Aug 1996 06:03:36 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 29 Aug 1996 06:03:36 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960829130015_71670.2576_HHB55-4@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
