Shame on you Wolf for implying otherwise.<br><br>My philosophy of music has remained unchanged regarding previous<br>statements and I live my philosophy.  It is okay to disagree with me.<br>This in itself, however, does not indicate rightness or wrongness on an<br>issue.<br><br>One last attempt to explain my non-acceptance of the microtone as _only_ a<br>discreet interval smaller than a semitone: perhaps it is the<br>reticence I have for doing mathematical calculations to provide<br>"microtone" remainders.  Same problem I have with Ben Johnston's notation.<br>It's not that it is theoretically unsound.
