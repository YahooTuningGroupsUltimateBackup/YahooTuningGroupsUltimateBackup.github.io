I will attempt to answer your questions based on the information<br>I've gathered for my "Microtonal Synthesis" web site.<br><br>You are correct that the ASR-X supports only one global tuning table at a<br>time.  It's architecture in this regard is based more on the MR-Rack, so I<br>doubt your pitch tables from the EPS 16-Plus are transferrable.  Pitch<br>resolution should be the same or better as the 16-Plus.<br><br>I don't know of any computer program (MIDI patch/program editor) that<br>supports the MIDI tuning standard other than Justonic's Pitch Pallette, and<br>it supports only 12 note per octave scales.  Anyone?<br><br>The ASR-X can load EPS/EPS 16-Plus/ASR-10 samples and programs as well as<br>AIFF and WAV files, Akai S1000 type sample files and others.<br><br>John Loffink<br>john.loffink@compaq.com<br><br>> -----Original Message-----<br>> <br>> I'm hoping someone on the list can answer some gear questions for me.  I<br>> have been working with the old Ensoniq EPS 16+ for some time now and am<br>> quite comfortable with manipulating its tuning tables.  I am, however<br>> being seduced by the sexy new ASR-X.  Its expandable to 34megs of sample<br>> ram and has an on board synth.  What's really cool though, are the<br>> alternate tunings built into it.  I didn't count them, but a brief glance<br>> at the manual showed dozens.  Included were most of the popular ETs -<br>> 19,31,53 and many of the Carlos tunings.  Hell, even 88cet was in there<br>> (kudos Gary) but I digress...Anyway, here is my problem:<br>> For those of us who like to "roll their own" scales how easy is this<br>> beast to work with.  What little I could infer from the manual stated<br>> that you could have one user programmed scale at a time reside in RAM,<br>> BUT it had to be done via a computer using the midi tuning standard.  My<br>> questions:<br>> Is this a good thing?  How does the resolution compare?  I've never<br>> worked with the midi tuning standard so i'm clueless.  And finally, is<br>> there a way to use more than one tuning at once, especially the user<br>> programmed ones (oh, and what kind of computer program will I need).<br>> The beauty of the previous generation of samplers (EPS, 16+, ASR10) was<br>> that you could have many different scales reside in memory at the same<br>> time.  And for someone like me( who is the self proclaimed village idiot<br>> of micro tonality) this was great for comparing scales (it just doesn't<br>> sink in when I read it, I have to hear the pitches and putz around with<br>> them.  I guess it's a drummer thang...).  <br>>  Are the tunings from my EPS16+ upwardly compatible.  And for that<br>> matter, are the samples themselves going to work. <br>> Any info will be greatly appreciated.<br>> <br>></div>
