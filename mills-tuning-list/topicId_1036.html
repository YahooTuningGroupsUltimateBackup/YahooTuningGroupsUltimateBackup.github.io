In addition to Paul<br>>Rapoport's article in Xenharmonikon 16, there are articles by<br>>Ervin Wilson and others in XH2 and XH3. All three of these issues<br>>are available from Frog Peak Music, P.O. Box 1052, Lebanon, NH<br>>03766 USA, p/f : (603)  448-8837. email: frogpeak@sover.net<br>>URL http://www.sover.net/~frogpeak/.<br>><br>>As far as performance on midi instruments is concerned, some<br>>composers simply map the tuning onto a standard keyboard and<br>>play whatever is under the fingers.<br>><br>>Alternatively, one may use Julian Carrillo's numerical system<br>>for any tuning. However, Carrillo's books are somewhat difficult<br>>to find.<br><br>Of course, there's also Ezra Sims' notation--he describes it in his article<br>"Reflections on This and That (Perhaps a Polemic)" in Perspectives of New<br>Music (I forget in which issue)--and Ben Johnston's notation, best<br>described by John Fonville in "Perspectives" issue 29, No. 2 (1991).  These<br>both describe the pitches very closely, although Johnston's are only really<br>useful for JI, and do not include the convenience of enharmonic spellings.<br>Sims is good for quartertone, 31-tone, 72-tone and the like.<br><br>I did an informal survey recently about what kinds of notations are used by<br>the people on this list, and only got a couple of responses, which leads me<br>to believe that most people use staff notation with (a) quarter-tone<br>accidentals, (b) standard accidentals used for 17TET or similar scales, or<br>(c) less than 12 tones per octave.<br><br>Or perhaps people don't like responding to silly queries.<br>********************<br>I have a couple of semantic questions:<br>1.  (Ken): Who uses the word "allotonality", and who came up with it?<br>2.  Who is Sheperd of "Sheperd Tones" (pitches which seem to perpetually<br>rise or fall as in Tenney's "For Ann(rising)")<br><br><br>_________________<br>Adam B.
