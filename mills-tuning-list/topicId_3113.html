It's not likely that there will be much heated<br>discussion of 12TET vs 22TET, but I think most of you will find some<br>interesting papers relating to Mr. Babbitt's work, remembering that he was<br>one of the pioneers in electronic music.  Please drop me a line if you<br>plan to attend.  I hope to see you on May 2!<br><br>==========================================================================<br><br>		****  MILTON BABBITT SYMPOSIUM ****<br><br>On Saturday, May 2, 1998 the Music Division of the Library of Congress<br>will be sponsoring a symposium in honor of Milton Babbitt.
