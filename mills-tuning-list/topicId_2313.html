What's<br>> so special about 81/80?<br><br>When this discussion cropped up earlier (in May, I think), I was unable<br>to send out mail due to certain technical problems, so I'll take the<br>opportunity now to mention what I had in mind then.<br><br>Paul, I think this problem admits of a resolution if we agree to treat<br>pitch relations as a phenomenal, secondary-quality discourse, operating<br>within the conceptual system of a given musical tradition; on the<br>physical, primary quality level, we can speak of frequency ratios. I<br>would suggest that the problem you have encountered arises from the<br>confusion of these distinct levels of discourse: the perfect fifth<br>belongs to the phenomenal level, the syntonic comma to the physical. If<br>I were to say "pure fifth", however, it would be natural to assume that<br>a 3/2 was intended; "pure fifth" is opposed to "impure fifth", i.e.<br>tempered, whereas "perfect fifth" is opposed to "imperfect fifth", i.e.<br>augmented or diminished. To specify an interval on the phenomenal level<br>leaves the physical realisation of the interval underdetermined: a<br>perfect fifth could be a 3/2, or any meantone or ET analogue; what<br>matters is that the perfect fifth, regardless of the tuning system in<br>which it may be realised, should _function_ as such.<br><br>The syntonic comma is already well-defined as 81/80, and its etymology<br>specifies the context in which it arises: the syntonic diatonic of<br>Ptolemy, and implicitly the difference between this and the ditonic<br>diatonic. Its use, established since the 16th century, for categorizing<br>the various shades of meantone entrenches this sense further.<br>Nevertheless, there is probably no harm in saying, at the beginning of<br>an article on ETs, that you will be discussing analogues of the syntonic<br>comma, and that for convenience you will thereafter refer to these as<br>"syntonic commas" or simply "commas", on the understanding that the<br>meaning of the terms is derived, not literal. But to treat "syntonic<br>comma" as if it were a phenomenal term such as "perfect fifth" is to<br>merge the phenomenal and physical levels, and open the way to all manner<br>of confusion.<br><br>Consider how this applies to Greek theory: Ptolemy was, in part, arguing<br>at cross purposes with Aristoxenus. Ptolemy, giving an empiricist slant<br>to Pythagorean theorising, was discussing intervals as frequency ratios,<br>while Aristoxenus, trying to supplant the Pythagorean tradition, was<br>trying to argue that intervals should be defined purely within the<br>concepts native to music, as pitch relations on the phenomenal level.<br>(Aristoxenus then brought trouble upon himself by constructing a<br>numerical model which was too heavy for such a foundation, but we can<br>leave this aside for present purposes.) In spite of the exclusive claims<br>of each theorist, there is no logical incompatiblity between the two<br>approaches, if they are understood to operate on different levels:<br>intervals qua pitch relations, and intervals qua frequency ratios.<br><br>> Any JI term that has an ET equivalent is probably OK to use in the<br>> tempered sense, as long as that use is understood. This is where<br>> "quartertone" is different: it's already a tempered term.<br><br>Whether quarter-tones are defined functionally as pitch relations, or<br>physically as frequency ratios is a moot point. I would judge that<br>"quarter-tone" is context-dependent in this respect: if I were reading<br>through a Vyshnegradsky score, I would understand them as 2^(1/24)/1<br>frequency ratios because the tuning system in which the score is to be<br>realised is specified by the composer. But if I were reading, say, a<br>Ferneyhough score, I would not make any such assumption: the flautist,<br>violinist, etc. is required to produce a sound which is sufficiently<br>distinct from its neighbours to have its own audible function. In such<br>music, tones are not specified to be 2^(1/6)/1, and semitones are not<br>specified to be 2^(1/12)/1, so we can hardly suggest that quartertones<br>are somehow to be assigned a precise frequency ratio. Audible function<br>is all that counts in such contexts, placing quarter-tone notation on<br>the phenomenal level, and not the physical.<br><br>> I know we've been over this before, but I think I'm being consistent.<br>> As far as I'm concerned, anyone is welcome to talk about quartertones<br>> in 31-tET; you just won't find them in the tuning.<br><br>Lowinsky spoke of quartertones when discussing Vicentino's enharmonic<br>writing; since Vicentino's assignment of ratios to intervals was highly<br>confused, this usage might not be quite so reprehensible as it would<br>seem. If Vicentino had unequivocally specified, say, 31TET, then<br>"quartertone" would be out of place; but considering Vicentino's<br>vagueness, I think we can charitably allow Lowinsky the functional,<br>phenomenal sense of quartertone.<br><br>Interestingly enough, 14th and 15th century music requires two levels<br>for specifying pitch relations (one for notation, one for singing), as<br>well as another for specifying frequency ratios. But that's another<br>story -- if anyone's interested, I'll explain what I mean.<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  f1279605@nv.aif.or.jp<br>Subject:  introducing a ml from japan<br>PostedDate:  14-08-97 16:17:38<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  14-08-97 16:17:43-14-08-97 16:17:44,14-08-97 16:15:53-14-08-97 16:15:53<br>DeliveredDate:  14-08-97 16:15:53<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564F3.004E851D; Thu, 14 Aug 1997 16:17:38 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03033; Thu, 14 Aug 1997 16:17:38 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 14 Aug 1997 16:17:38 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03031<br>Received: (qmail 6496 invoked from network); 14 Aug 1997 14:17:23 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 14 Aug 1997 14:17:23 -0000<br>Message-Id: <33F38C62.6439@nv.aif.or.jp><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
