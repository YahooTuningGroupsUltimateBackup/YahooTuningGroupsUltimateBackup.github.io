Though he stated that he<br>didn't think there was anything of value in composing with quartertones,<br>thirdtones or tenthtones, he was known traditionally for his "expressive<br>intonation."  This past Christmas I played his C minor and D minor Bach<br>Cello Preludes and analyzed them successfully according to Werckmeister<br>III tuning, apparently intuitively.  Casals described his ideas thusly:<br><br>"Intonation, as it is conceived today, has such sensitiveness and subtlety<br>that the intonation of note must affect the listener quite apart from any<br>stimulating accent.  The necessity of observing it is understood and<br>observed by all good instrumentalists.  In our day, the public would not<br>accept a good soloist if he did not play in tune.  Singers are taught<br>"tempered" intonation, but I have noticed that the most gifted and the<br>most artistic ones realise the importance and the subtelety of perfect<br>intonation.  The principle I am speaking of is of varied character in its<br>application to string instruments.  I make an exception for double-stopped<br>playing: in this case one must compromise between expressive intonation<br>and the "tempered" one.<br><br>"I can give a demonstration which would astonish many people: for example<br>I can prove with my system that there is a greater distance between a Db<br>and a C# than there is in a semitone like C-Db or C#-D natural.<br><br>"It is a pity that such an essential part of performance as this real<br>intonation should be, is still so neglected by some teachers.  The other<br>day when I was giving a young pupil his first lesson, I asked him how he<br>had been taught; he said he had been taught intonation from the tempered<br>piano.  So you see what work he will have to do to correct this!"  <br>-- Pablo Casals<br><br>The translater had one slant on the above and a footnote references<br>another.  I prefer to take Casals at his word. That is: that tempered<br>intonation is mathematically exact 12-tone equal temperament but it is by<br>its very nature unnatural.  So for expressive imperitives, in order to<br>draw the truest character out of music, notes are distorted from their<br>mathematical ideal.  The Db is sometimes stretched so low for a dark shape<br>of interval, while a C# is striving up so high to lead to the next,that<br>their abstract disctance can be measured as greater than the conventional<br>12ET semitone.  (This of course assumes that C# is higher than Db as in the<br>Pythagorean/12ET theory of pitch ordering.)<br><br>Johny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music	- MicroMay '97 (May 16, 21-23)<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@idt.net<br>http://www.echonyc.com/~jhhl/AFMM/<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 5 May 1997 04:47 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04626; Mon, 5 May 1997 04:47:10 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04592<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id TAA18692; Sun, 4 May 1997 19:45:29 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 4 May 1997 19:45:29 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199705050242.TAA08154@dnai.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5423 href="#5423">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>5/6/1997 6:41:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>   And, Marion's comment that he thought people gravitated to eq temps<br>>because they were "easier"...easier in what way?<br><br>   I think he probably means easier than dynamically-retuned JI.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>>...yes, I am bored to tears with 12 eq, but you<br>>"just" champions better get on the ball, then, and do some serious<br>>playing and composing, instead of chattering...then, your words will have<br>>more real depth and meaning<br><br>   Marion has produced quite a bit of JI music, by the way.<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 7 May 1997 03:44 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06467; Wed, 7 May 1997 03:44:34 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06477<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id SAA03309; Tue, 6 May 1997 18:43:00 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 6 May 1997 18:43:00 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01541103af9536ea3db5@[207.207.2.28]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
