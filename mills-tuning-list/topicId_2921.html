These collections were done from the turn of the<br>century to the 40's. Although she makes no attempt to decyper the<br>tunings, she recorded these songs on Edison Disks which many are housed<br>at the Southwest Museum here in L.A. That none of us has investigated<br>this collection is a shame and all you out there could ridicule me for<br>not taking up the task. May my friends out there harp me to go over<br>there, I will. She states that they raise their fourths and lower their<br>sevenths(could they be attempting to reach a gibson<br>dischord!).Personally I have heard stories that before this time of<br>Densmore's collections (of individual not group renditions) that with<br>certain tribes the women would keep a high drone from which the song<br>would start or move to within the first few notes. I have tried playing<br>quite a few songs with an upper drone finding the effect very<br>convincing!! Even more so when I've used scale derived from  a<br>subharmonic series.<br>	Rod Poole who first used my 12-tone tuning Centaur found in the last<br>Xen., now has expanded this into a 17-limit affair (22 frets to the<br>octive with various open tunings). He has also done some compositions as<br>"The Voice of the Bowed Guitar" with 3 just open tuned guitars that are<br>bowed. I will update you when the recording is available.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed) <br>Subject:  Re: Comma shift and the speed of the galaxy<br>PostedDate:  28-12-97 14:29:46<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  28-12-97 14:27:29-28-12-97 14:27:30,28-12-97 14:26:55-28-12-97 14:26:55<br>DeliveredDate:  28-12-97 14:26:55<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125657B.0049EAB3; Sun, 28 Dec 1997 14:29:18 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA26528; Sun, 28 Dec 1997 14:29:46 +0100<br>Date: Sun, 28 Dec 1997 14:29:46 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA26542<br>Received: (qmail 21216 invoked from network); 28 Dec 1997 05:29:44 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 28 Dec 1997 05:29:44 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.728255@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6859 href="#6859">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl</h3><span>12/30/1997 7:22:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> I've just migrated over to Win95 from both Atari and Mac, and I'm<br>wondering<br>> if there's any sort of software out there for Windows that does tuning<br>via<br>> pitch bend for some of my older synths.<br><br>Yes you can use Scala which can do tuning via pitch bends for any synth.<br>You have to run it in a DOS window.
