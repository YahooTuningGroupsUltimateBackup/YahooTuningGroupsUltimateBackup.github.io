(in a harmonic context based on<br>existing Western tonal practice)<br><br>I listened to a large number of ratios one after another, alone and in<br>chords (using harmonic timbres), and concluded that for root position<br>3-6 tone tertian harmony, the intervals I listed, including the 3rds<br>above, provide the necessary model for an extension of tonal practice. <br><br>We can label these qualities according to accepted terms:<br><br>7/6 subminor 3rd<br>6/5 minor 3rd<br>11/9 neutral 3rd<br>5/4 major 3rd<br>9/7 supermajor 3rd<br><br>In this view, 14/11 will be heard either as a supermajor or major third,<br>so it's not a perceptually distinct quality.<br><br>It's also true that one must create certain musical contexts to enable<br>the listener to distinguish certain of these thirds from others--for<br>example, it's easy to make a neutral third have the quality of 'major'<br>if it isn't surrounded by a pair from the remaining 3rds, built from one<br>of the 'minors' and one of the 'majors'.  <br><br><br>>7/5, 3/2 (fifths)<br><br>Is there some reason you prefer 7/5 over 10/7?<br><br>HF: 7/5 is the first 'diminished fifth' quality in the harmonic series,<br>and is found in the 5:6:7 diminished triad.<br><br>As mentioned already, these ratios can be used to model aspects of<br>voice-leading in JI as well as various ETs--thus, I'm not tied to one<br>system, but do have a consistent model for voice-leading across them.<br><br>The best way to make sense of all this is to try it out yourself. For<br>example, recreate this V-I four-part harmony cadential pattern (ratios<br>built on the same tone until the final chord):<br><br>8 18 7   10<br>6 15 6   8 <br>5 12 5   8<br>4 10 4   4<br>------   --<br>V        I (obviously a 3/2 distance between V and I)<br><br>Happy listening. <br><br>If you live in southern CA, contact me now if you'd like to try and meet<br>(if you haven't already).<br><br>With intent to generate discussion<br>(but remember I'll be cut off from e-mail 'til Thanksgiving now),<br>Harold Fortuin<br>www.wavefront.com/~hfortuin</div>
