In first inversion, this<br>chord from d down to a down to f has the d to a fourth wide from just by a<br>21.5 cent comma, while the interval from f to a is a just 5/4 major third.<br>In the song My Country tis of Thee - God Save the Queen, which begins C C D<br>B C<br>D, the first two notes are harmonized with C major and the third note would<br>normally be harmonized with D minor.  On my piano, which I am here<br>translating<br>to the terms of the just scale on C, the D minor chord sounds bad if played<br>with a D in the bass, but if the F is played in the bass, that D minor<br>chord<br>sounds all right to me - not perfectly consonant, but not egregiously out<br>of<br>tune, and possibly as effective musically as it would sound if a lowered D<br>were used or raised F and A so that the chord would be a just minor triad.<br>I<br>cannot try out the just minor chord now, but will do so at some point and<br>then<br>be able to compare their sounds to see whether a just minor D chord would<br>sound still better at this point.<br><br>I had not realized that by putting the third in the bass it might be<br>possible<br>to use a minor II chord without having the dissonant fourth detract<br>excessively from its effect.  I just now tried this with a major II chord<br>and,<br>although putting the Fsharp in the bass somewhat reduced the dissonance, to<br>me the chord still sounded very dissonant and not likely to be frequently<br>usable.  When played side by side, the minor II chord with F in the bass<br>sounded much more solid and reasonable to me than did the major II chord.<br><br>Dave Hill, La Mesa, CA<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1488<br>*************************</div>
