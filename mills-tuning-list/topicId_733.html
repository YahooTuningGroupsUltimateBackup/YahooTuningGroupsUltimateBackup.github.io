Without offering any<br>>facts or data to back up his sentiments,<br>> the thrust of Taylor's several thousand<br>>words of verbiage seems to be: "I don't like<br>>mclaren."<br><br>It was split into two parts for easier<br>reading, actually.<br><br>I'd say we have a difference of opinion here,<br>Brian. You blessed us all with an editorial<br>rant on the notion of canonicity, and I simply<br>endeavored to suggest what someone who actually<br>had some contact with academic discourse would<br>probably say about the issues surrounding it. I<br>did so because I thought your jeremiad on the issue<br>uninformed [your notion of the canon as an historically<br>invariant entity, for example], and because I<br>thought it might be interesting or important to<br>suggest that there are all kinds of folks well inside<br>the discourse who've thought long and hard about<br>what one *does* with a "canon" in terms of attacking<br>or amending it. I tried to sketch out the *general*<br>forms such arguments take in the interests of<br>suggesting that those folks who labour outside of<br>12TET might find all kinds of common approaches<br>and issues with their literary as well as musical<br>sisters and brothers. I'll sure admit that this may<br>not be as much fun as torching some cultural straw<br>(wo)man, but my hope was that it would help to<br>suggest that the reality of the situation is simply more<br>complex than your highly entertaining charicature<br>might suggest.<br><br>I think it's rather too bad that you're incapable of<br>extracting what I thought was a rather straightforward<br>description of things, but that's *your* problem<br>rather than mine. As I believe I've suggested before,<br>as long as you continue to alternate between being<br>someone who supplies us with interesting summaries<br>of "the literature" and a producer of intemperate rants,<br>you can expect to be complemented on the former and<br>razzed on the latter. My impression from the mail that<br>came after the posting suggested that at least a couple<br>of persons seemed to understand what I was trying to<br>explain, so I think it served its purpose well.<br><br>>This can be shortened immensely and vast<br>>amounts of internet bandwidth saved if<br>>Taylor simply posts "IDLM" in response to<br>>my posts.<br><br>One might waggishly suggest that you could bless<br>us by making such pronouncements *multilateral*<br>and simply replacing "ILBM" (I Love Brian McL.)<br>whenever you feel the need.  :-).<br><br>With regards,<br>Gregory<br><br>P.S. Having been doing a little actual reading<br>on Cage of late, I'm wondering about what you<br>think John meant when he described microtonalism<br>as "another wing on the academy." I hate to be a<br>pest about this, but it's looking increasingly like<br>this quotation is located in John's "Silence" period<br>writings [i.e. the 50s]. Have you actually *read*<br>this material?<br><br>My best guess (actually, I'm still hunting the quote in its<br>baad entirety and context) is that we're located in Cage's<br>"Composition as Process" stuff, in which he's thinking in<br>terms of entirely "scaleless" space where pitch is entirely<br>continuous [electronic technology interests him at this point<br>because he thinks it lets him move about in this continuous<br>space, natch]. If, as I surmise, this is the case and context for<br>his comments, quarter tones would be no improvement over the<br>normal 12 notes/octave. Actually, the argument does, I think,<br>carry some weight [aren't there some "scaleless space folks<br>here?"] What is the difference between erecting a complex<br>syntactic-theoretical framework on the basis of twelve tones<br>or twenty-four tones or any other number of tones or on any<br>other system of temperament? If I'm reading my 1950s version<br>of John correctly, none whatsoever. You'll note also that this is,<br>in fact, Cage being *critical* of all those 12-tone guys you so<br>love to fulminate on.<br><br>I'll let you know when I find the original citation - unless you've<br>got it, of course....  :-)<br><br>P.P.S There's quite a cogent little essay in "Silence" where<br>Cage attempts to explain what *he* means by the use and<br>application of the term "experimental" when applied to<br>musical behaviour. While I've no particular faith that you'll<br>read it, I commend it to the rest of our readers. His approach<br>was not quite as I imagined it.<br><br>_<br>I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,<br>paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only<br>maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it.
