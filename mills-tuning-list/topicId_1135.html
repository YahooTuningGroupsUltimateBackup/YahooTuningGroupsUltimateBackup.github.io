How about highly chromatic polyphonic<br>> passages?  Could you play Bach's Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue<br>> on this 1796 31-TET contraption?<br>> How easily can 31-TET chromatic passages be performed? Or<br>> is this keyboard you mentioned useful only for playing 12-out-of<br>> 31-TET?<br><br>The Hammerklaviersonate, unlikely. I don't know the exact key sizes.<br>The Harmoniehammerfluegel (not a harpsichord what Brian said) has rows<br>of short white keys which are above one another in a straight line.<br>It was not designed to play 31-tone music on! But it is not a very<br>practical key layout and for playing Bach's Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue <br>on it, one would benefit from having very long thumbs :-).<br>There were only two instruments like this built. The older one that<br>Mozart knew doesn't exist anymore I think. However had there been a<br>break-out of Harmoniehammerfluegelomanie, they could have of course<br>made substantial improvements. It has one feature to ease playing<br>and that is an extra sixth row. The keys of the bottom row are connected<br>to other keys. Shifting a chromatic semitone is very easy.<br>The layout of the five upper rows is as follows:<br><br>   Fx   Gx   Ax   Bx   Cx   Dx   Ex   Fx   Gx   Ax  ...<br>   F#   G#   A#   B#   C#   D#   E#   F#   G#   A#  ...<br>   F    G    A    B    C    D    E    F    G    A   ...<br>   Fb   Gb   Ab   Bb   Cb   Db   Eb   Fb   Gb   Ab  ...<br>   Fbb  Gbb  Abb  Bbb  Cbb  Dbb  Ebb  Fbb  Gbb  Abb ...<br><br>Beethoven and Haydn have tried it out. Perhaps we may conclude that<br>they weren't very impressed from the fact that they didn't write any<br>music for it. <br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 23:02 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00509; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 23:03:56 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00507<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id OAA18838; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 14:03:53 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 11 Nov 1996 14:03:53 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199611112144.QAA20765@freenet5.carleton.ca><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
