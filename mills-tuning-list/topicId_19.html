It may sound naive, but he does go to<br>some trouble to assign "prominence values" to each of the thirds as<br>they occur in the music -- he uses a five-fold classification scheme,<br>based on several factors:  register, chordal context (if there are other<br>dissonances in the sonority, we won't be as disturbed by a particularly wide<br>third), duration.  He admits the resulting prominence value, which he will<br>use to give a weighted sum  of the total number of occurrences of<br>particular thirds in a passage, is somewhat subjective, and will be influenced<br> by the performer's phrasing, tempo, etc.  His basic idea, to use his own<br>words, is  that "the avoidance of bad major thirds, sounded as such, in<br>music of a generally urbane character, appears to be the principal<br>constraint in the use of a circular temperament.  This should be an<br>influence on the composer which, in favourable circumstances, might<br>be recognizable as confirmation of the use of a circular temperament."<br><br>I can't see anything wrong with trying to make such a count, and to<br>correlate it with the character of the thirds in various temperaments.<br><br>But I would still not assume that WTC is conceived in one temperament, and<br>one only.  Tuning is an art, despite all the electronic boxes out there.<br>(also despite all the theorist's descriptions!)  Harpsichords can be tuned<br>for the particular piece one wants to play.  Also remember that at least<br>one of the preludes began life in a different key from the one in which<br>it ended up.  Moreover, unless you are convinced that the collection is a<br>cycle, always to be presented complete, there is no reason to assume that<br>only one temperament can be employed.<br><br>On the other hand, we all develop habits -- I tune Werckmeister III<br>often, I'm used to it, I may rely on it as my generic tuning for several<br>months at a time.  Maybe Bach did that too.  But if the concert is far<br>out on the flat side of things, I may not choose Werckmeister III.<br>If the concert has pieces far out on the flat and on the sharp side,<br>I may choose equal temperament.  I try not to program that way since I<br>enjoy suiting the tuning to the piece.<br><br>Sandra Mangsen<br>University of Western Ontario</div><h3><a id=2045 href="#2045">ðŸ”—</a>COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>9/25/1995 4:08:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Date:         Sat, 23 Sep 1995 09:42:32 -0400<br>Sender:       Harpsichords and Related Topics <HPSCHD-L@CNSIBM.ALBANY.EDU><br>From:         Tom Parsons <twp@PANIX.COM><br>Subject:      Re: In defense of Rasch.<br><br>On Sat, 23 Sep 1995, Paul Hahn wrote:<br><br>> Well, I'll give you that (though see Jorgenson for an argument that no<br>> one really tuned accurate ETs until a century or so ago when beat rates<br>> were calculated and began to be used), but the point is that the<br>> evidence that _Bach_, specifically, used ET is tenuous to the point of<br>> nonexistence.<br><br>(a) What I got from Rasch's paper was that we should reserve judgement.<br><br>(b) Actually, Jorgenson seems a more persuasive rebuttal to Rasch than<br>anything else I've seen in this discussion.
