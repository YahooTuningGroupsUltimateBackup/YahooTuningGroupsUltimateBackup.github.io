This tuning scheme could be<br>conceptualized as a modified<br>quarter comma MT tuning with the fifths from Eb to C made just and their<br>quarter comma temperaments all shifted onto the single C to G fifth, etc.<br><br>	This scheme yields six just major triads - Eb, Bb, F and G, D, A,<br>and six<br>just minor triads - G, D, A and B, F sharp, C sharp.  Although very<br>limited,<br>this is enough to permit a number of very simple tunes to be played with<br>reasonable arrangements, together with some renaissance hymns.<br><br>	My piano tuner asked me to play some chords after he had completed<br>the<br>tuning job, which I did.  To me at that point, the chords sounded quite<br>clean, not very much different than they had sounded in 1/4 MT.  As usual,<br>the piano<br>sounded somewhat dry, despite the unisons having been left slightly detuned<br>by<br>irregular amounts around a cent.  My piano tuner was quite enthusiastic<br>when<br>he heard the chords and said that THAT was the first tuning he had done for<br>me<br>which really sounded good to him.<br><br>	I believe it is an important observation that he felt this way -<br>liked the<br>sound of the piano in JI but not so much in MT.<br><br>	Although the overall average degree of tempering of the thirds and<br>fifths is much less in 1/4 MT than in EQT, I have become convinced that in<br>comparison<br>with just intonation, both EQT and 1/4 MT sound appreciably tempered, but<br>the<br>overall characters imparted to music in these two different temperaments as<br>a<br>result of the tempering are very different.<br><br>	Thus some musicians long accustomed to EQT are likely to be so<br>accustomed to the effects of EQT that these sound completely natural to<br>them.  To them, I<br>hypothesize, music on a piano in just intonation may sound different than<br>what<br>they are accustomed to hearing, but they will not find any new effects<br>which<br>add quote OFF unquote qualities to the music^Rs sound.  They will<br>immediately<br>notice the greater flatness of the fifths in 1/4 MT than in EQT and find<br>that<br>to be disagreeable.  In their aesthetic judgment, the fifths will be<br>weighted<br>much more heavily than the thirds.<br><br>	Nevertheless, there will be many others who, notwithstanding the<br>greater<br>off-ness of the 1/4 MT fifths, will weight the greatly increased<br>harmoniousness of the thirds, together with the reduction in fast, high<br>frequency beating and the markedly increased overall resonance of the piano<br>more heavily than the moderately more perceptible off-ness of the fifths.<br><br>	I've been exploring the sounds of the piano in JI, and listening to<br>earlier recordings made in 1/4 MT.  I'm finding, not having expected it,<br>that in comparison with the piano in JI, the 1/4 MT music has a definite<br>quote<br>CHARACTER unquote imparted to it by the appreciable tempering of the<br>fifths.<br>My personal sense is that it is the tempering of the fifths, equally as<br>much<br>as the justness of the thirds which gives the 1/4 comma music a certain<br>solemn<br>character, a certain deliberate weightiness or seriousness.  Also, while<br>after<br>having always heard the piano in EQT, the beating resulting from 1/4 MT<br>seemed<br>essentially unnoticeable, in contrast with JI, there is a somewhat<br>noticeable<br>waveriness and shimmering effect discernible in 1/4 MT.  There is a<br>tendency<br>for this to be especially noticeable in very high pitch registers.<br><br>	There seems to be an overall slightly dreamy flatness which isn't<br>noticeable when one hears nothing but 1/4 MT music, but which is noticeable<br>after one has been listening to JI piano music.<br><br>	To me, the shimmering and slight dreamy quality of the 1/4 MT music<br>sometimes adds to the beauty of its sound, but perhaps not always.<br><br>	I find that with JI tuning, there is a definite improvement over<br>1/4 MT in<br>the harmoniousness and beauty of minor chords and music having many minor<br>harmonies.  Also, where the upper voice forms a fifth - melodic especially<br>-<br>at an important point, the overall sound seems more like what one would<br>expect, and to me better, with JI.<br><br>	At this point, I'd say that the change and improvement in going<br>from EQT to 1/4 MT was greater for me than that in going from 1/4 MT to JI,<br>but that there are quite a few differences between 1/4 MT and JI - minor<br>harmonies, the<br>fifths, melodic steps such as exact major semitones, neither wide nor<br>narrow,<br>just minor thirds, full major whole tones - which one begins to notice<br>increasingly with time.<br><br>	I haven't found the JI piano tuning to be quote STIFLINGLY unquote<br>restrictive, as textbooks usually state, but having only three adjacent<br>usable<br>keys (the bad C and E are problems) is sometimes frustrating.</div>
