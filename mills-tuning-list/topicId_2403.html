Dan Stearns<br>is a flabbergasting guitarist, working with 20 tone equal temperament, as<br>well as fretless; address is Box 701, Rutland MA. 01543. Yours truly has<br>a CD out with several jazz/blues 19 tone pieces; address Box 150271,<br>Lakewood, CO. 80215  (my next CD, all acoustic 34 and 19 tone, is on dat,<br>ready for pressing when I dig up the moolah).<br>    Someone also was curious about the professions of those on the<br>forum...I am a freelance musician in Denver, playing everything from<br>blues bars to jazz duos to department stores to shows...Denver is booming<br>like crazy, so there's a ton of work lately. Also, we do manage to do a<br>microtonal show or two...next Microstock is October 25, featuring John<br>Schneider on just intoned guitar with interchangeable fretboards...come<br>on out, and we'll put you up somewhere....Haverstick<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  nowitzky@pacificnet.net<br>Subject:  Re: Keys, Emotions, Tempering, etc...<br>PostedDate:  17-09-97 09:54:42<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  17-09-97 09:54:35-17-09-97 09:54:36,17-09-97 09:53:51-17-09-97 09:53:52<br>DeliveredDate:  17-09-97 09:53:52<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256515.002B6FF1; Wed, 17 Sep 1997 09:54:27 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04482; Wed, 17 Sep 1997 09:54:42 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 17 Sep 1997 09:54:42 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04478<br>Received: (qmail 11124 invoked from network); 17 Sep 1997 07:54:37 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 17 Sep 1997 07:54:37 -0000<br>Message-Id: <2.2.16.19970917005135.3dbf340e@pacificnet.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
