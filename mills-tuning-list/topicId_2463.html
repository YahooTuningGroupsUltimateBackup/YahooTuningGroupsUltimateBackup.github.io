I take it<br>that stood for "Helmholtz" (My hero!).<br><br>Easley Blackwood's book, "The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings",<br>is on my list of things to read too, but it ain't machine-readable, so it'll<br>have to wait.<br><br>About your 30 Sep 1997 post to the TUNING list - As far as the idea that a<br>lot of music relies on the "blurring provided by temperament" (courtesy<br>James Kukula's phraseology), I'm still not convinced.<br><br>Here's my line of thought:  What if you "blurred" the distinctions between<br>pitches even more?  Suppose, as an example, a melody, first played in major,<br>then in minor.  (It happens a lot in those "variations on a theme".)  You<br>could blur this melody into a "7tET" (7 equal intervals per octave), which<br>would wipe away the distinction between major and minor.  But you'd<br>definitely lose something in the translation.  In simplistic terms, you<br>would no longer have that "happy the first time, sad the second" feel to it.<br><br>That's all for now (since it's now past 3:00 am).  I look forward to reading<br>the rest of your thesis.<br><br>--Mark Albin Nowitzky (MIT BS EECS '79)<br>+------------------------------------------------------+<br>| Mark Nowitzky                                        |<br>| email:  nowitzky@pacificnet.net                      |<br>| www:    http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky          |<br>|         "If you haven't visited Mark Nowitzky's home |<br>|         page recently, you haven't missed much..."   |<br>+------------------------------------------------------+<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl<br>Subject:  dynamic JI<br>PostedDate:  01-10-97 17:17:26<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  01-10-97 17:17:03-01-10-97 17:17:04,01-10-97 17:15:59-01-10-97 17:16:00<br>DeliveredDate:  01-10-97 17:16:00<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256523.0053F220; Wed, 1 Oct 1997 17:16:54 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03857; Wed, 1 Oct 1997 17:17:26 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 1 Oct 1997 17:17:26 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03852<br>Received: (qmail 4437 invoked from network); 1 Oct 1997 08:17:24 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 1 Oct 1997 08:17:24 -0700<br>Message-Id: <C1256523.0053BD48.00@notesrv2.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6252 href="#6252">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>10/9/1997 7:02:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>I was wondering why no one doing dynamic intonation seems to make use<br>>of research in the area of automatic key recognition of music.

The different activation levels<br>of the key units<br>is what indicates the key. So if C has the highest activation then F and G<br>come next<br>to that as in the circle of fifths. The network consists of layers with<br>nodes for tones,<br>major chords, minor chords and keys. The links have a weight and are<br>symmetrical.<br>An interesting conclusion of the article by Barucha is that even though the<br>weight<br>of the links between source chord C major and its parent keys F, C and G<br>are equal,<br>the parent keys are not activated to the same degree. It is in decreasing<br>order:<br>C, F, G which are the keys in which the chord is on the tonic, dominant and<br>subdominant.<br>This in accordance with the hierarchy of harmonic functions in music<br>theory.<br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Subject:  Re: Guitar refretting<br>PostedDate:  10-10-97 23:39:15<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  10-10-97 23:38:49-10-10-97 23:38:50,10-10-97 23:39:18-10-10-97 23:39:19<br>DeliveredDate:  10-10-97 23:39:19<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125652C.0076E537; Fri, 10 Oct 1997 23:38:39 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13555; Fri, 10 Oct 1997 23:39:15 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 10 Oct 1997 23:39:15 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13551<br>Received: (qmail 28181 invoked from network); 10 Oct 1997 14:39:07 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 10 Oct 1997 14:39:07 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.971010153531.46961A-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
