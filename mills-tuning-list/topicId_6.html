First, I would suggest there<br>is no basis for using Young or Barnes-Bach.  Young is too late by 100<br>years, and Barnes-Bach is a fictional fabrication for which there is<br>no historical basis (see Rudoph Rasch's article on does well temperament<br>mean equal temperament, in Peter William's "Bach, Handel, Scarlatti").<br><br>There seem to be a lot of different temperaments being advocated in<br>the early 1/2 of the 18th-cent. in Britain.  The earliest I knowof<br>if given in Godrey Keller's "Rules for tuning the Harpsichord or<br>Spinett" in his A Compleat Method for ... Thorough Bass" (1707). It's<br>rules are the typically vague regular temperament whose 3rds and 5ths were<br>respectively "as sharp" and as flat as the ear will permit." It most<br>likely would be a temperament approaching 1/5- or 1/6-comma meantone.<br><br>Other temperaments mentioned in the early half of the century include<br>strict meantone, Pythagorean, and modifications of them. Further details<br>can be found in "Early Eighteenth-Century English Harpsichord Tuning and<br>Stringing" in "The English Harpsichord Magazine, vol. 3, no. 2 (1982),<br>pp. 18-22.<br><br>tom mcgeary</div>
