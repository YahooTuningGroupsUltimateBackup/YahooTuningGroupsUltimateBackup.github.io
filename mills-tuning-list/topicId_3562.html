But I will note that...<br>>1) The best of Ivor's stuff is roughly as good as the best of Blackwood's.<br>>2) The majority of Ivor's work is un-recorded.<br><br>   It's kinda hard to compare the two, but I guess I more or less agree.<br><br>   Ivor was always operating in lifestyle that might be described as "panic<br>to get xenharmonics in the public eye before he dies".  He intentionally<br>rejected the idea of devising and becoming fluent with alternative notation<br>systems, because he concluded that doing so would just simply take too much<br>time.  That in turn then meant that he couldn't get involved with music<br>complex enough to, practically speaking, require notation to devise it.<br><br>   Easley Blackwood is pretty much the exact reverse.  As with me, he<br>almost strictly in terms of notation, so his music lacks the exciting<br>spontaneity and flow that you hear in Neil Haverstick's improvs, or Ivor<br>Darreg's music.  So although Blackwood's music is a little more "stiff"<br>(and mine is stiffer still, although I've almost got that problem licked<br>now), it is nevertheless more inspiring than Ivor's music in terms of each<br>composition making a really specific musical statement.<br><br>   Ivor also had extremely meager equipment to work with compared to<br>Blackwood's army of graduate students and grant to work from.  That until<br>right at the end when Brian McLaren and others helped Ivor out.  Ivor's<br>creativity really started flourishing again when he had some more inspiring<br>and powerful equipment to work with.  And then he died.<br><br>   Another thing that makes them hard to compare is that Ivor was much more<br>interested in making humorous commentary in his writings and his music.<br>Blackwood's music on the other hand is pretty much academic and "serious".<br>Both approaches are valuable of course, each having its strengths and<br>weaknesses.</div>
