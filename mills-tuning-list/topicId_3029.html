DSP or Virtual Modeling type<br>instruments<br>>> could do better though.<br><br>> Sorry, what's an IC?<br><br>Sorry, IC = Integrated Circuit = analog or digital electronic device from<br>as simple as a logic gate to as complex as a Digital Signal Processor or<br>Pentium microprocessor.  All audio level processing in today's synthesizers<br>and samplers occurs in each manufacturer's custom ICs (a few use<br>off-the-shelf DSPs).<br><br>>> Building tunings into "Partials", Keygroups or Zones is tedious and<br>>> wasteful effort in my opinion.<br><br>>Yes, it's extremely tedious - but my point is that it needn't be,<br>>even on a sampler.  Hence the idea of creating on-board macros or<br>>templates to speed up the process.  The reason why it's not a waste<br>>of effort (for me) is that I'm creating simulations of acoustic<br>>instruments.  The difference between what one can achieve in this<br>>respect on a sampler and a synth is enormous (IMO) - but of course<br>>not everybody is interested in simulation.<br><br>I guess I'm confused whether you want more "Partials" to accomplish<br>microtonal scales or better sampling.<br><br>> > > A kind of `kit' mother keyboard with a large number of movable slots<br>> > > into which a user configurable number and arrangement of keys of<br>> > > different sizes and colours could be fitted_  And new types of<br>control<br>> > > for keys (taking the idea of `after touch' further_)<br>> ><br>>> Starr Labs is working on a generalized microtonal MIDI keyboard that<br>>> supports polyphonic aftertouch.<br><br>> Do you mean the Microzone - or are Starr Labs producing another<br>> keyboard as well?  I hope the distinction between what I suggested<br>> and the Microzone is clear.<br><br>I was talking about the Microzone, but I can see now the distinction.  The<br>Microzone has just black or white keys, all one size, and no "new" types of<br>control.  I'm sure the reason is purely economics.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed) <br>Subject:  Re: MIDI/Audio wish list<br>PostedDate:  10-01-98 20:27:00<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  10-01-98 20:26:28-10-01-98 20:26:29,10-01-98 20:26:20-10-01-98 20:26:21<br>DeliveredDate:  10-01-98 20:26:21<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256588.006AC9B2; Sat, 10 Jan 1998 20:26:53 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04519; Sat, 10 Jan 1998 20:27:00 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 10 Jan 1998 20:27:00 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09363<br>Received: (qmail 14495 invoked from network); 10 Jan 1998 11:26:57 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 10 Jan 1998 11:26:57 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.96943@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
