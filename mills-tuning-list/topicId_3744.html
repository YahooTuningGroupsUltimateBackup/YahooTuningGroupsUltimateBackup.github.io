This is reported by Marc Shulgold ( a very good friend of <br>microtonal music in Denver, by the way)..."A former Nazi propagandist <br>named Hans Scherbius says important wartime data collected by German <br>spies was transmitted through the 12 tone music of New Viennese School <br>composers." and ""These pieces were nothing more than cipher for encoding <br>messages,"" Scherbius claimed, referring to the thorny music of Anton <br>Webern, Alban Berg, and Arnold Schoenberg." Supposedly, for example, <br>Webern's Opus 30 Variations for Orchestra contain "a mathematical grid  <br>that deciphered into German a comparison between the neutron release <br>cross sections of uranium isotopes 235 and 238..." Sounds out there, but <br>local composer Donald Keats goes on to point out that "Berg did encrypt <br>secret thoughts to his mistress." So...Hstick</div>
