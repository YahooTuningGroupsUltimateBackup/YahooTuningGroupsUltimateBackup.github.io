That at the expense of<br>the more important intervals in terms of musical organization.  <br><br>   I agree that that's a meaningful concern.  Still, I came to the conclusion<br>early on that naming it after its step size was the only precise way.  Like<br>Wendy Carlos' Alpha and Beta tunings, and unlike Pierce-Bohlen or octave-based<br>equal-temperaments, 88CET doesn't split any simple harmonic relationship into<br>even pieces.  <br><br>   But as far as I'm concerned, you're welcome to think of it as 3 equal steps<br>per 7:6, 4 steps per 11:9, 5 per 9:7, 7 per 10:7, 8 per 3:2, 10 per 5:3, 11 per<br>7:4, 18 per 5:2, or 41 per 8:1.  That assuming you realize that its<br>approximations to those frequency ratios are close but not exact.  <br><br>   In either case, I'd prefer there to be a single name for the tuning, so that<br>we don't risk calling it seven different things and not realize that we're<br>talking about the same thing!  For example, I think it would be a bad idea to<br>call Carlos' Alpha "78CET", since plenty of literature already exists on it<br>under the name "Alpha".  <br><br>   By the way, I have an all-new 88CET lecture/demo with more music on it.  If<br>you want to hear some of the sounds I've been blabbering about, lemme know.<br>Unfortunately my DAT deck is in the shop at the moment, so it'll be a while<br>before I can send out copies.
