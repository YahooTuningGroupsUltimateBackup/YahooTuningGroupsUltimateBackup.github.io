In it, American<br>bluesman Taj Mahal talks about similarities between V. M. Bhatt's Indian<br>melodies and the blues.<br><br>Taj demonstrates by singing a bluesey riff that contains a "quartertone".<br>To my ear, it sounds like he is singing the 64/33 and resolving it to the<br>octave, a distinct interval of about 53 cents.  Bhatt responds by echoing<br>the riff quite accurately on his instrument.<br><br>Now, this interval does not sound alien or even unusual to me, and it's a<br>distinct melody note.  Anyone who listens to modern American pop music will<br>hear singers doing this kind of thing in their melodic "grace notes" all the<br>time.  I have to believe there are better singers in the world than the<br>folks I hear on the radio.  There are certainly many with better accuracy<br>than poor old Taj!<br><br>    -b0b-<br>-----<br>quasar@wco.com (Bobby Lee)<br>http://wco.com/~quasar/<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed) <br>Subject:  Reply to Gregg Gibson (and not the only one!)<br>PostedDate:  13-12-97 14:32:47<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  13-12-97 14:30:54-13-12-97 14:30:55,13-12-97 14:30:37-13-12-97 14:30:38<br>DeliveredDate:  13-12-97 14:30:38<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656C.004A391F; Sat, 13 Dec 1997 14:32:39 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14467; Sat, 13 Dec 1997 14:32:47 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 13 Dec 1997 14:32:47 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14462<br>Received: (qmail 3948 invoked from network); 13 Dec 1997 05:32:37 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 13 Dec 1997 05:32:37 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.348361@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
