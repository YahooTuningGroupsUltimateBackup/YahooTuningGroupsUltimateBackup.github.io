You can anonymous FTP there.<br><br>>     Also, I've been wondering if anyone has created a PC version of<br>>the melograph, i.e., something that will read a sound file and provide<br>>a continuous graph of pitch & loudness?  <br><br>There's a program I picked up from the net a while back called gram.exe.<br>If displays FFTs of signals in color given an input WAV file.  You may be<br>able to derive pitch and loudness from that but there's nothing specific in<br>it that does this.  I can't remember where I got it but the info box says to<br>send comments or questions to rshorne@delphi.com.  Sound Forge also has a<br>new spectral analysis plugin.<br><br>regards,<br><br>Steve Curtin<br>Ensoniq Corp<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 8 Dec 1995 19:23 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id KAA11285; Fri, 8 Dec 1995 10:23:10 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 8 Dec 1995 10:23:10 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199512081820.AA01313@server.net4you.co.at><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
