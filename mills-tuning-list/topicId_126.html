The reason is that the basic building blocks of 88CET traditional<br>harmony, such as sixths and tenths, are far away from the building blocks of<br>nontraditional harmony, notably subminor, neutral, and supramajor thirds.  <br><br>   Adding a part to the harmony can sometimes help.  For example, consider a<br>wide-voiced major chord, like what in traditional notation would be E up to C up<br>to G.  An equivalent-sonority chord in 88CET would be notated D up to C up to A.<br>You can immediately create a nontraditional sound by injecting an additional<br>note between chord tones to form supramajor or neutral thirds with the original<br>parts.  For example, adding an G and an Eb to form D G C Eb A produces a very<br>nontraditional chord to say the least.  <br><br>   But there are some nontraditional intervals within a stepwise-motion's<br>distance of traditional intervals.  For example, consider tritone resolution,<br>one of the most basic cadential effects in traditional harmony.  Diminished<br>fifths traditionally either resolve inward to thirds, and augmented forths<br>outward to sixths.  In 88CET, tritones do resolve outward to traditional sixths,<br>but to nontraditional thirds.  Here are some examples of how this can be<br>exploited:<br>               Traditional                Nontraditional<br>               Resolution:                 Progression:<br><br>                       A                    G<br>                G                                   F# (SM3)<br>           (TT)          (m6)          (TT)         C#<br>                C                           C<br>                       B                               (sm7)<br>          (sm7)          (M6)         (sm7)         C#<br>                C      C                    C<br><br>              dom7   major                dom7     new<br><br>   Of course leaps are always an option, especially since in transitioning to<br>nontraditional harmony, you're beginning to toss traditional part-writing<br>notions out the window.  But as in traditional music, too much leaping breaks<br>the flow of the counterpoint and harmony.  Although there's nothing inherently<br>wrong with breaking that flow, it can obscure the surprise or oddness of a<br>transition to nontraditional harmony.  This harkens back to the notion of<br>"relativistic voice-leading":   When everything seems "normal" and your<br>progression all flow normally, people expect all of the chords you play to sound<br>normal.  When they turn out unusual, you have a powerful effect.  When the flow<br>breaks, all bets are off, so there's less surprise.  But when a seemingly normal<br>collapsing tritone produces something strange, you'll get your audience's<br>attention!  <br><br>   There are many other possible smooth transitions from traditional to<br>nontraditional.  Your best bet in locating them is through experimentation.  In<br>particular, start with a traditional chord structure, and then resolve one or<br>more of the tendency tones in the wrong direction.  Many of these also work<br>great in retrograde as transitions from nontraditional to traditional.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 28 Oct 1995 05:38 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id UAA17136; Fri, 27 Oct 1995 20:38:10 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 27 Oct 1995 20:38:10 -0700<br>Message-Id: <951027233718_78428733@mail02.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
