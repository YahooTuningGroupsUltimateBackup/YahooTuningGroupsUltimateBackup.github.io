I've been doing quite a lot of<br>tuning-related reading recently, yet have been encountering conflicting<br>definitions for these concepts.<br><br>According to R. H. M. Bosanquet in "An Elementary Treatise on Musical Intervals<br>and Temperament," (1876, [1987 reprint]): "Fifths are called positive if they<br>have positive departures, i.e. if they are greater than E. T. fifths; they are<br>called negative if they have negative departures, i.e. if they are less than E.<br>T. fifths.  Perfect fifths are more than seven semitones; they are therefore<br>positive.  Systems are said to be positive or negative according as their<br>fifths are positive or negative." (p. 60)  By "E. T. fifths" he means 700 cent<br>12-tET fifths, of course.  Similarly, "seven semitones" means seven 100 cent<br>12-tET semitones.<br><br>This would appear to be rather clear.  However, J. Murray Barbour can't seem to<br>make up his mind in "Tuning and Temperament: A Historical Survey" (1951, [1972<br>reprint]).  Right up front in the Glossary (p. ix), he defines a positive<br>system as: "A regular system whose fifth has a ratio larger than 3:2."<br>Similarly, he defines a negative system as: "A regular system whose fifth has a<br>ratio smaller than 3:2."  This, of course, is at odds with Bosanquet's<br>definition.  Barbour then goes on in the main text, when describing multiple<br>divisions of the octave, to say: "The 34-division is a positive system, like<br>the 22-division.  That is, its fifth of 706 cents is larger than the perfect<br>fifth ..." (p. 121).  This is consistent with his definition of positive system<br>in the glossary, although it is not at all clear whether he is using the term<br>"perfect fifth" to refer to the pure ratio of 3/2 (701.955 cents) or to its<br>12-tET approximation of 700 cents.  However, a few pages later, he describes<br>53-tET as "a positive system, with fifths sharper than those of equal<br>temperament ..." (p. 124).  The 53-tET fifth is 701.887 cents, which is<br>slightly *smaller* than 3/2 (701.955 cents), so we must conclude that his<br>definition in the glossary is incorrect.<br><br>Unfortunately, the confusion has not been limited to Barbour.  In his article,<br>"Cents and Non-Cents: Logarithmic Measures of Musical Interval Magnitude" in<br>Xenharmonikon 15, our own John Chalmers writes: "A negative system is one whose<br>fifths are less than the 3/2 perfect fifth of 701.9550009 cents." (p. 82)<br>Fortunately, John C. has since corrected his error in the "Notes & Comments"<br>section of XH 16 (p. 2).<br><br>Ironically, several pages later in this very same issue of XH, Paul Rapoport,<br>in his otherwise excellent article "The Notation of Equal Temperaments," makes<br>the same mistake, I believe, when he writes: "In many positive temperaments,<br>i.e. where v is greater than the just perfect fifth (701.955 cents), k is the<br>obvious choice of komma to use for notation, ..." (p. 66).  He uses the<br>variable "v" to represent the equal-tempered interval most closely<br>approximating the just perfect fifth.<br><br>I believe Bosanquet to be the final authority in this matter -- is he indeed<br>the originator of the terms "positive system" and "negative system"?  However,<br>the question remains: Why is there so much confusion over these terms?<br><br>Now, what in blazes is a "doubly positive system"???<br><br>John<br><br>---<br>John G.
