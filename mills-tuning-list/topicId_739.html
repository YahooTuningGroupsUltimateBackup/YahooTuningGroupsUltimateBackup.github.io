Searched for the word <br>"microtonality."  Defaults only.<br>Worst result: 6 hits. (Accufind.) "Best" result: 168 hits<br>(HotBot).<br>Ah, but those 168 "hits" are deceptive, kiddlies...  <br>Of all those 168 "hits," exactly 4 URLs led to useful<br>websites: the Piet Oostrum's site, the JIN<br>Store, Zia's site, and the Mills microtonal discography/<br>bibliography.<br>Every other "hit" led either to wild garbage--<br>including some truly amazing wackiness about<br>"quantified astrological fields"--or irrelevant<br>fragments (someone somewhere thought it would<br>be a smart idea to spatter bits and pieces of <br>microtonal CD reviews and miscellaneous e-mail<br>from the Mills tuning forum across the<br>web by turning them into hhtp links, and the<br>end result is positively hallucinogenic), or<br>dead "404 -- FILE NOT FOUND" messages. (Also<br>plenty of 403s, same difference.)<br>Artificial intelligence has never impressed<br>me, and 40 years of LISP code seems to have<br>produced a truly monogoloid spate of<br>WWW search engines, all of them deeply &<br>desperately & unspeakably *bad* at finding<br>anything in the way of useful info.<br>Plus, fraud. HotBot clearly ups its number of "hits"<br>by including all dead URLs in its list.  (Other<br>search engines appear to weed 'em out.) Thus,<br>while HotBot scored the largest number of<br>"hits" in a search for the word "microtonality,"<br>it does so at the cost of including vast<br>numbers of 404 URLs.  Roughly 25% of all the<br>HotBot hits were dead URLs.  Every link to<br>the Harry Partch Society 404'd, every link to<br>CERN 404'd.  Attempts to find the new URLs<br>failed in every case.  Gave up.<br>Even worse, *no* WWW search engine<br>turned up a basic list of elementary info<br>you'd want to find out if you were a micro-<br>tonalist just starting out:<br>Namely, what kind of non-12 tunings exist?<br>How is microtonal music being made?<br>Where is it being made?<br>What's the history of non-12 tuning?<br>Why is microtonal music being made?<br>This is truly impressive.  These are the BASIC<br>questions any microtonal beginner would ask,<br>and answers to 'em are *nowhere* available<br>on the web. <br>--<br>So let's see what we've got here:<br>[1] The WWW is a swirling maelstrom<br>of junk littered with dumb-and-dumber<br>search engines and non-stop 404s.<br>About 98% of the search "hits" on the<br>word "microtonality" turned up pure <br>garbage--essays by grad students about<br>burning pianos that happen to mention<br>the word "microtonality," random <br>dissociated fragments of Mills Tuning<br>Forum e-mail someone pasted into the<br>web...last and best, innumerable LINK NOT FOUND<br>dead ends.<br>[2] None of this so-called "information" on<br>"microtonality" had much to do with<br>microtonality, with the exception of<br>Manuel Op de Coul's discography and the<br>Mills bibliography.  The typical<br>"hit" on an Alta Vista or Yahoo list was<br>something like "Post Modern Notation<br>And Its Implications For Tutti-Fruiti<br>Ice Cream" with the word "microtonal"<br>squirreled away somewhere in the body<br>of the text for snob appeal.<br>[3] There is no single web page anywhere,<br>at any time, in any way that offers any<br>kind of general introduction to microtonality<br>for the beginner.  There is also no single<br>web page anywhere that offers any kind<br>of *context* for people who know something<br>about microtonality and want to know more.<br>Ideally, we should have 3 levels of web<br>pages about microtonality: (1) BEGINNERS START<br>HERE.  (2) IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT<br>MICROTONALITY AND WANT TO KNOW MORE,<br>START HERE. (3) EXPERTS ONLY--ADVANCED<br>TOPICS IN MICROTONALITY.<br>In effect, there is zero useful information<br>available about microtonality on the web.<br>[4] Because most of the URLs blow out with<br>404s, it's incredibly frustrating--almost<br>*no one* seems to be bright enough to realize<br>that all URLs very quickly fry & die as<br>the Internet addressing scheme is changed<br>to accomodate the explosive growth of the<br>web....therefore, the most sensible thing<br>to do is assume the URLs are DOA and<br>include a snail mail address for each URL<br>(all of which will be 404 soon anyway).<br>--<br>So my worst nightmares turned out to be<br>*mild* in comparison with the truth.<br>I already knew the Internet was a chaotic<br>mess of bad info and gossip, but I'd assumed<br>there was at least *a little* smidgen of<br>useful information hidden away somewhere,<br>available to extremely persistent web surfers.<br>Silly me.<br>Turns out the WWW is a vast whirlwind of<br>junkthink, misinformation, snobtalk,  gossip,<br>rumors, fantasy and nonsense.  The web's<br>democratic, all right--just like the incurable<br>ward at Bellevue.<br>There's no context for anything, no way to<br>make sense of any information, no place for<br>beginners to start, no way to sort out garbage<br>misinformation from solid info.  Among other gems<br>I encountered an essay which discussed <br>Thaddeus Cahill's trautonium (I like it!  Cahill<br>did *not* invent the trautonium, he invented<br>the telharmonium, a totally different instrument<br>from a totally different era).  Ah, but best of all:<br>I searched the WWW for the word "tuning" & got 20<br>websites about "tuning your server" but not *one*<br>*single* *website* about microtonality.<br>Impressive, eh? <br>All told, the experience of surfing the web <br>in quest of information about microtonality<br>was like being beaten by 12 dwarfs with baseball<br>bats underwater while blindfolded on LSD.<br>Utter, raving, wild chaos.  No way<br>to make sense of anything.  No context.  No place<br>to start.  No reliable info (except for Manuel's<br>web pages and few scraps of the Mills Tuning<br>Forum placed on the web but wayyyyyy out of<br>context and thus incomprehensible to anyone<br>likely to read 'em).<br>--<br>If I were a beginner looking for info on <br>microtonality, what would I find by searching<br>the world wide web?<br>[1] Huge amounts of information about industrial<br>music, pomo music theory, computer music,<br>some mystifying references to a guy named<br>Harry Partch all of which lead to dead URLs<br>that give "404 -- file not found" messages.<br>Weird fragments about some guy named<br>Haverstick who made a CD, a couple of files<br>about how to tune your guitar *to 12-tet*,<br>and--best of all--plenty of references to<br>university music courses on 20th century<br>music, all of which mention microtonality<br>as something a couple of European guys did<br>back in the 1920s.<br>Riiiiiiiight.<br>This is good.<br>We're really doing well here, people.<br>If I were a beginner searching for info<br>on microtonalty...after surfing the web<br>for a couple three hours I'd run screaming<br>back to the 12-tet conservatory, where<br>at least *some* hard info on *something*<br>would be available.<br>--<br>Between all the hundreds of dead-end 404<br>URLs and the lengthy essays on "notational<br>implications of MIDI" (nary a mention of<br>microtonality) and the odd "quantified<br>astrological field" references (another<br>of my favorite "hits" from a search for<br>the word "microtonality"), if I were a<br>microtnal beginner searching the web,<br>after about 3 or 4 hours  I'd be ready <br>for some heavy-duty electroconvulsive <br>therapy.<br>Alas, one thing I would *NOT* be ready to<br>do after surfing the WWW in search of<br>useful info on microtonality, is:  contact <br>*any* of the major<br>microtonal organizations (JIN,<br>Frog Peak, Artifact Records, Pointless<br>Music, ReR, BHPS, Xenharmonikon, <br>ReR Quarterly, Boston Microtonal<br>Society, AFMM, etc.)<br>or be equipped to understand even the<br>most elementary basic fundamental<br>concepts of microtonality.<br>--<br>So it's one huge incredible mess out there.<br>Far worse than I ever imagined.  The web is<br>not "the nervous system of the human race,"<br>it's a giant dumpster full of out-of-date<br>astrology ads and ungrammatical essays. Not<br>only will beginners wind up baffled by <br>their attempts to find info on microtonality,<br>but they'll probably get the impression<br>that [A] there *isn't* any useful info<br>on microtonality, it's just a chaotic<br>jumble of gibberish; [B] somebody named<br>Harry Partch did something in connection<br>with microtonality, but he's obviously not<br>worth bothering with because no info is<br>available about him; [C] contemporary<br>microtonality is mostly about pomo<br>music theory with a smattering of<br>industrial music, feedback guitar<br>techniques, and "post-classic" pop<br>music;  [D] the most important <br>microtonalists in music history are:<br>Glenn Branca, the Velvet Underground,<br>Brian Eno and Gavin Bryars.<br>--<br>Wow.<br>What can I say?<br>Just...Wow.<br>--<br>Okay.  So here's this giant mess...what do we<br>do about it?<br>First: you people need to LEARN HOW TO DESIGN<br>A WEBSITE.<br>Let's start at the beginning.<br>All search engines seem to operate by chewing<br>on the cumulative text of a website and tallying<br>up the total number of times your search word<br>is mentioned.  The first 25 words or so of a website <br>are typically digested into a tag line that serves<br>as the search listing.  So what is the most<br>important part of any website?<br>*THE FIRST 25 WORDS.*<br>Hello. <br>Anyone there???<br>When you design your website you *must*<br>do the following:<br>[1] ALWAYS strip off mail header garbage<br>if it's a re-post linked to the WWW.  Otherwise<br>the listing will show up as incomprehensible<br>stuff like BDHJ110101-10112@#128999198.111<br>What the hell is that???<br>If you surfed to Alta Vista and your "hits"<br>were a bunch of listings like <br>1. 8989283.292#9202002=JJKDBD<br>2.===!~~~*(988.2392983DJDJDM.DLLL<br>3.&**@_)WWJWJ/WWW9989.2929298@ZOB<br>would *you* bother to read these "hits"?<br>Of course you wouldn't, you can't even tell<br>what the hell is *in* these websites.<br>[2] BOIL DOWN THE ESSENCE OF YOUR WEBSITE<br>TO 25 WORDS OR LESS.  THEN START WITH THOSE<br>25 WORDS, pure and simple. I can't begin to <br>count the number of websites whose Yahoo<br>or Alta Vista or HotBot listing started off<br>something like this: "Hi, Jo Blow Here, this<br>is my attempt at doing a website which...."<br>WRONG!!!<br>If the website is about microtonal notation<br>for traditional instruments,  here is<br>how your website should look:<br><HEAD>MICROTONAL NOTATION </HEAD><br><P> <H1> for traditional acoustic instruments.</H1> <br><P><br>This website contains the following<br>specific information: <P> <L1><br>..<br>This website would show up on a Yahoo<br>search list as<br>1.  MICROTONAL NOTATION for traditional<br>instruments. This website contains the following....<br>and this is *exactly* the way you want it to<br>show up, because this tells a websurfing visitor<br>*precisely* what is in your website as<br>clearly and simply and succintly as possible.<br>--<br>Here is how NOT to design the same website:<br><HEAD> (Big huge graphic that takes 5 minutes<br>to download and tells the websurfer nothing--<br>hey....how about a picture of me?  Yeah! That'll do!) </HEAD><br><H1> This is JOE BLOW'S WEBSITE designed<br>with PageMill version 3.01.  This web page<br>was last updated on (blah-blah woof-woof).<br>If you have any new information or corrections,<br>please e-mail (myaddress@swarb.gink.zoid)<br></H1><br><P> Fancy interactive JAVA program <br><P> Dead URL<br><P> This web page is a first stab at an<br>attempt to describe a meta-theory involving<br>certain aspects of microtonal notation<br>which...<br>--<br>This would show up in a Yahoo or Alta Vista<br>or HotBot search list as:<br>"This is JOE BLOW'S WEBSITE designed<br>with PageMill version 3.01.  This web page<br>was last updated on (blah-blah woof-woof).<br>If you have any new information or corrections,<br>please e-mail (myaddress@swarb.gink.zoid)"<br>--<br>Guess what?  <br>It's impossible to tell what  this web page<br>is *about* by looking at the Yahoo listing.<br>Good job!<br>--<br>Second important point:  <br>When you design a web page, *forget* about<br>fancy graphics.  After a half hour of websurfing<br>I learned the hard way that Netscape downloads<br>text first--then goes back to fill in graphics.<br>So as soon as the text fills in I learned to<br>click on STOP.  This kills the graphics<br>downloads and lets me scroll through<br>the body of the webpage to see if there's<br>any useful content there (usually not).<br>The alternative is to sit around for 10<br>minutes reading Aristotle's "Rhetoric"<br>(my constant companion) while a useless<br>picture of something or someone creeps across <br>the screen like a mailman with Parkinson's.<br>Here's a hint, people:<br>Graphics are garbage.  They're content-free.<br>Sound files are garbage.  They take wayyyyy<br>too long to download, last only a few seconds,<br>are wayyyyy too low-fi, and most computers<br>won't be set up to play 'em anyway.<br>JAVA programs never run.  DEC is always<br>upgrading JAVA, so the bottom line is that <br>all JAVA interpreters are beta (if not alpha) <br>code and they all crash and burn, no exception.  <br>--<br>So the second thing you need to know when<br>you folks design web pages is: leave out<br>the graphics, don't bother with sound files,<br>forget about fancy interactive animations,<br>kiss off the JAVA programs.  <br>As a websurfer I want one thing and one<br>thing only: content.  Also content.  And<br>by the way, did I mention content? <br>That means text, text, more text, and even<br>*more* text.  It means BE CONCISE.  It<br>means TELL 'EM WHAT YOU'RE GONNA TELL<br>'EM, TELL 'EM, THEN TELL 'EM WHAT YOU TOLD<br>'EM.<br>AT* fill the damn background<br>of your web pages with fancy patterns.  This<br>makes the web page *unreadable.*<br>Also, please do *NOT* do something tricky<br>like making your text fluorescent green<br>against a picture of a black starry sky<br>scanned from a Hubble satellite photo.<br>Any sensible user will click on STOP long<br>before the background graphic downloads...<br>Which leaves the hapless reader with unreadable <br>fluorescent green text against a gray background.  <br>Ai caramba!<br>--<br>Here are 3 horrible examples of what<br>I'm talking about:<br>[1] "<H1> Two CD reviews </H1><br>DMB5561719@aol.com<P><br>Sat, 1 Apr 95 17:49:18-0800<P><br><L1>Message sorted by [date][thread][subject]<br>[author]<br><L1> Next messages John H. Chalmers: "Another<br>post from McLaren" <P><br><L1>Previous message: John H. Chalmers "Post<br>from Brian"<P1><br><L1><br>In tuning digest I never see enough reviews<br>of microtonal rcordsings.  Here is my<br>contribution, a few things I haven't seen<br>anywhere else.<br>(etc.)<br>--<br>That was the verbatim text of the start of an<br>actual web page.<br>First, look at the uninformative header:<br>"Two CD reviews."  What KIND of CDs? <br>Second: look at all the header junk.  Who<br>cares about the internet adress, who cares<br>about the date?  Post that crud--if you have<br>to--at the *end* of the website, *not*<br>the first couple of lines.<br>Third: look at all the garbage!  "Messages<br>sorted by..."  "Next message..."  "Previous<br>message..."  Totally content-free!<br>And even in the body of the website<br>we get vaguely worded mush that tells<br>the average person nothing: "In tuning<br>digest I never see enough reviews of <br>microtona recordings.  Here is my<br>contribution, a few things I haven't..."<br>yadda-yadda-yadda. <br>Imagine it--10 lines of text, and the<br>web surfer *still* doesn't have the<br>faintest idea WHAT THE HELL THIS<br>WEB PAGE IS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT.<br>--<br>Horrible example 2: check out Zusaan<br>Kali Fasteau's web page.  She's a fine<br>performer, an innovative microtonalist,<br>etc., etc., okay, fine, she's peachy-keen<br>'n dandy, love her music, she's the <br>greatest thing since squeezed cheese.<br>Fine.<br>But the very first thing on her web<br>page is a *monster* graphic that takes <br>10 minutes to download.<br>I clicked STOP, dumped the graphic,<br>aborted the web page and scooted.<br>ZKF offers a perfect example of how *not*<br>to design a web page.<br>CONTENT FIRST, and superfluous glitz<br>later (if at all).  Put your graphics at<br> the *end* of the web page, if you must<br>include them at all.  And as for scanned<br>photos of yourselves--people, I hate to<br>let you in on a little secret here, but<br>nobody cares what you look like.  "On<br>the Internet, no one knows you're a dog"<br>as the cartoon goes.<br>Content is what matters on the web.<br>Pure distilled info.  Everything else<br>is piffle. <br>--<br>Third horrible example:<br>Wendy Carlos put up a web page with a<br>mail box.  Never got around to reading it.<br>Wendy is a genius, a wonderful person,<br>a superb musician, yadda-yadda-yadda.<br>But her web site is a *disaster.*<br>The background is some textured Mayan<br>hieroglyphic something-or-other, and<br>it is just plain *impossible* to make<br>out black text against it.<br>At first, I thought I had eye trouble.<br>--<br>Here's the bottom line:<br>Dark black text against a light<br>uniform background is highly readable.<br>Anything else is probably UNreadable.<br>Stick to *dark black text* against a <br>*light uniform background.*<br>--<br>Okay.  That takes care of basics.  Common<br>sense should have told you all of this,<br>but apparently these revelations come<br>as a startling epiphany to those of you who <br>design web pages.<br>This leaves the issue of content.<br>Clearly none of you are capable of putting<br>together a concise comprehensive web<br>page that introduces beginners to the<br>fundamental elmentary terms and ideas<br>of microtonality. <br>Clearly none of you are able or willing<br>to design a web page that gives oodles 'n<br>oodles of snail mail addresses of<br>places like the JIN and the British<br>Harry Partch Society and Frog Peak<br>and ReR and Pointless Music and <br>the Electronic Music Foundation.<br>Clearly none of you other than Manuel<br>are able or willing to design a web page<br>that contains titles of basic essential<br>references like Mandelbaum's thesis,<br>Partch's Genesis of a Music, Blackwood's<br>Structure of Recognizable Diatonic<br>Tunings, Darreg's Xenharmonic Bulletins,<br>Bosanquet's book, and the Corpus Microtonale<br>score library, and the addresses at which<br>to get these documents. (Snail mail--remember,<br>all URLs go 404 within a couple of months<br>nowadays.)<br>--<br>So, obviously, as usual, I'll have to do it. <br>Amazing.  Just amazing.  You people have<br>got enough collective brainpower and knowledge<br>about microtonality to move Mars out of its<br>orbit, and after 3 years you *still* haven't put<br>even a single  minimally  adequate microtonal <br>web page anywhere in the world where beginners<br>can find basic necessary info on microtonality.<br>What's that?<br>Oh.  Sorry.<br>Did I wake you folks up?<br>Never mind, go back to sleep.  It's nothing.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 12 Nov 1996 19:46 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01610; Tue, 12 Nov 1996 19:47:41 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01608<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id KAA05568; Tue, 12 Nov 1996 10:47:38 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 12 Nov 1996 10:47:38 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.961112124655.16680A-100000@library><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4044 href="#4044">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/1996 11:58:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: a blizzard of misinformation<br>--<br>Paul Erlich is a very smart fellow who has done<br>commendable work in looking up valuable references.<br>Alas, Paul often has a tendency to shoot from<br>the hip, based on incomplete or out-of-date info.<br>Such an example occurred when Paul Erlich<br>wrote that "the preference for stretched<br>intervals only occurs in melodic, not harmonic,<br>intervals" (or words to that effect).<br>This is a common enough canard, and it turns<br>out to be untrue.  In actual fact unbiased listeners<br>uniformly tend to hear *both* melodic *and*<br>vertical intervals which are stretched as<br>"pure" and "just," while they tend to hear<br>unstretched small-integer ratio harmonic<br>*and* melodic intervals as "too narrow" and<br>"impure."<br>(I mention "unbiased" because it is always <br>possible to train yourself to recognize any<br>kind of interval from its beat structure if <br>you confine yourself to a narrow range<br>of very restricted integer-harmonic timbres. <br>This is why A-B-X tests using a wide variety<br>of different timbres in an objective psychoacoustic<br>experiment are so important.  Simply setting<br>up a synthesizer and playing such-and-such<br>and interval and saying, "Oh, I can hear that<br>the interval is [fill in the blank]" is useless<br>in probing the human auditory system, since<br>you know what to listen for and thus have<br>unwittingly biased yourself.)<br>The evidence that listeners hear *both*<br>stretched harmonic *and* melodic intervals as <br>"pure" is cumulative,  the data have been confirmed<br>by hundreds of experiments, and the evidence goes<br>back more than 160 years.  C.J. Delezenne<br>in "Memoires sur les valeurs numeriques des<br>notes de la gamme," in Recueil des travaux<br>de la Societe des Sciences de Lille, 1826-1827,<br>was the first researcher to identify *both*<br>melodic *and* harmonic preference for<br>stretched intervals.  Delezenne used an<br>adjustable monochord and meticulously<br>recorded the values his test subjects<br>heard as "pure" intervals in terms of<br>fractions of a Pythagorean comma (cents<br>were not yet a measurement in use).<br>The next researchers who duplicated these<br>results were Cornu and Mercadier, who used<br>a phonautograph (as scholars, you know what<br>this instrument is and require no explanation)<br>and by examination of the tracings on the<br>lampblack-coated camphorated cellulose<br>strips Mssrs. C & M were able to calculate<br>with precision the frequency of sounds impinging<br>on the phonautograph.  Cornu & Mercadier<br>found that the mean intonation for a vertical<br>dyad heard as a "pure" major third was<br>1.251, close to but sharper than the just<br>5/4; a consecutive-tone series of tests on<br>musical subjects yielded the much sharper<br>value of 1.2666 for melodic "just" thirds.<br>See Cornu & Mercadier, "Sur les intervalles<br>musicaux," Comptes Rendus de l'Academie<br>Royale des Sciences, 1869a, pp. 301-308<br>for proof.<br>In 1876 Preyer found that vertical intervals<br>as large as 397 cents were still identified<br>by some subjects as "pure major thirds." <br>Preyer's results are suggestive, but not<br>conclusive, since he gave his data in terms<br>of an "index of sensitivity" to intervals <br>rather than in terms of analysis of variance,<br>as would be done today. Preyer's value<br>for the "pure" major third represents a <br>weighted average of the minimum and maximum<br>values cited by test subjects. For details, see <br>Preyer, W. T., Ueber die Grezen der Tonwahremung,<br>Jena, 1876.<br>In 1897-8 the extremely underrated acoustician<br>and music theorist Carl Stumpf studied perception<br>of the minor third by test subject under 3<br>conditions: melodic ascending, melodic descending,<br>and simultaneous dyad.  His results show a marked<br>asymmetry in the spread of sharp vs. flat intervals<br>judged "pure." For the minor third, this means that<br>the test subjects were more inclined to accept <br>considerable flatting that slight sharping.  Stumpf<br>concluded that the "point of subjective purity" <br>shifted toward flat minor thirds.  <br>He conducted the same series of tests with major<br>thirds and found exactly the opposite tendency.<br>For major thirds, the point of subjective purity shifted<br>toward sharp thirds.  Melodic intervals had to be tuned<br>significantly sharper to be perceived as "pure"<br>than simultaneous dyad major thirds, but *both*<br>had to be sharper than just to be perceived as<br>"pure."  See Stumpf, C., and H. F. Meyer,<br>"Massbestimmungen ueber die Rienheit <br>consonanter Intergvals," in Beitraege zur<br>Akustik und Musikwissenschaft, Vol. 2, 1898,<br>for full details.<br>Moran and Pratt tested melodic and vertical<br>intervals but didn't give detailed breakdowns:<br>they state merely that there is an average error <br>of 18 cents for the intervals of the 12-TET scale.<br>They did, however, find that subjects were more<br>likely to hear intervals chosen from equal<br>temperament as "pure" and "just" than intervals<br>chosen because they exhibited small integer<br>ratios.  It's unclear whether this was due to<br>the effect of familiarity with 12-tet, however.<br>See Moran , H. and C. C. Pratt, "Variability of<br>Judgments On Musical Intervals," J. Exp. Psych.,<br>Vol. 9, 1926, for more info--but not much more.<br>The article is very short on details, alas.<br>P.C.

F. Nickerson, in "A Comparison of Performance<br>of the Same Melody in Solo and in Ensemble with<br>Reference to Equi-Tempered, Just and,<br>Pythagorean Intonation," PhD thesis, University <br>of Minnesota, 1948, found the same perception of<br>stretched melodic *and* harmonic intervals as<br>"pure"  (although as usual melodic intervals had<br>to be stretched  more widely than vertical<br>dyads before they were heard as "pure" or "just"<br>or "in tune.").<br>There are so many studies from the 1950s<br>and 1960s and 1970s that I will cite only<br>3 more: Ward, W. D., "Music Perception" in<br>Foundations of Modern Auditory Theory, Ed.<br>J. V. Tobias, 1970--more support for my<br>statement and more contradiction of Paul<br>Erlich's claim that listeners do not perceive<br>stretched vertical dyads as "just" and just<br>vertical dyads as "too narrow" and "impure."<br>In 1975 Terhardt and Zick published an<br>extremely interesting paper which links<br>the accompaniment of a melody with the<br>intervals heard as "pure." Some types<br>of accompaniment required intervals<br>be stretched to be heard as "pure," while<br>other types of accompiment required that<br>all intervals be contracted to be heard<br>as "pure." This applies to the vertical<br>intervals of the accompaniment as well<br>as to the consecutive intervals of the melody.<br>See Tehardt, E., & Zick, M., "Evaluation of<br>the Tempered Tone Scale in Normal, <br>Stretched and Contracted Intonation,"<br>Acustica, Vol. 32, 1975, pp. 268-274.<br>The most recent reference which refutes<br>Paul Erlich's claims and proves my <br>statement of fact is Sundberg, Johan,<br>"The Science of Musical Sounds," <br>The Academic Press: New York, 1991, <br>page104: "In the case of the octave,<br>the craving for stretching has been<br>noticed for both dyads and melodic<br>intervals."  Table 4.12 on Sundberg's page<br>102 gives "Average sizes and standard<br>deviations for dyads between vibrato<br>tones adjusted by musically experienced<br>listeners."

Kudos are due<br>to him on both counts, since in setting down <br>plenty of hard details and carefully-thought-out<br>ideas, he laid  himself open to the verbal assaults <br>so beloved of an unfortunate minority on this tuning<br>forum. <br>Paul Erlich's proposed 15-week course in<br>tuning seems excellent--*if* the purpose is<br>to indoctrinate the student in Pythagorean<br>tuning theory, with other tunings considered<br>as deviations therefrom.<br>This might not be the best way to introduce<br>students to tuning theory, insofar as they<br>are already brainwashed into the Pythagorean<br>mindset.  Our overwhelmingly Pythagorean <br>music notation and terminology  pretty<br>much assure that by the time students reach<br>Erlich's putative course, they'll have long since<br>followed Alexander Pope's dictum: "A little<br>knowledge is a dangerous thing; drink deep or<br>foreswear that Pierian spring."<br>If we are going to teach people about tuning<br>theory we may want to give them a sense that<br>other structures and harmonies are possible than<br>those considered standard in western Pythagorean<br>musical paradigms.<br>Who knows?  We might even to reveal to them (gasp!)<br>that most of the world's musical cultures are<br>*not* based on Pythagorean paradigms.<br>However, if Pythagorean zombification is the intent, <br>the course seems well structured *except* for<br>the strange introduction of "7-TET representations<br>of pentatonic scales allowing modulational freedom."<br>Alas, 7-TET *cannot* be understand in Pythagorean<br>terms.  Attempts to force the neutral triad typical<br>of and the sole consonant harmony in 7-TET into<br>a Pythagorean mold produces Easley Blackwood's<br>unfortunate gaffes: EB states that "the only<br>consonant harmony in 20-TET is a kind of sixth<br>chord," untrue, since the neutral chord (which cannot<br>be explained in a Ptyhagorean framework) is one<br>of only 2 consonant triadic structures in 20-TET.<br>Blackwood also  states that "there is no <br>consonant vertical triad in 17-TET," also untrue.<br>In both cases the primary consonant vertical<br>triad is a *neutral chord*--the *same* kind of<br>structure which forms the *sole consonant<br>vertical triadic structure* in 7-TET. <br>In 17-TET the neutral triad occurs on<br>scale degrees 1-6-11; in 20-TET the neutral<br>triad occurs on scale degrees 1-7-13; in<br>7-TET the neutral triad occurs on scale degrees<br>1-3-5. (Numbering scale degrees from 1 to<br>N where N is the equal tempered division of<br>the octave.)<br>If we approach these equal temperaments in<br>Pythagorean terms we cannot recognize or<br>acknowledge the existence of neutral triads<br>or neutral modes, since Pythagorean 3-limit<br>theory has no place for the 11-limit neutral <br>comma.<br>(See my upcoming serialized set of posts<br>which set forth my article "The Sound and<br>Structure of the Equal Temperaments," in<br>which the neutral comma is defined,<br>quantified, and used to describe the <br>properties of scales like 7-TET which<br>can be understood or approach in 3-<br>or 5-limit terms.)<br>Clearly 7-TET is completely out of place<br>in any discussion of Pythagorean tunings.<br>--<br>Introducing  NJ NET scales between <br>a discussion of the Pythagorean comma<br>and schismatic tunings of the late middle<br>ages also seems strange.  NJ NET scales <br>come out of left field, then vanish.<br>Perhaps they would be better placed off by<br>themseves as a separate block?<br>Paul Erlich's "10. Just intonation--<br>Indian Music" propounds the pervasive<br>and dubious claim that "Indian<br>music" is based small integer ratios.<br>In fact there are at least two kinds<br>of "indian music"--Karnatic music,<br>which uses 9 of 22 just srutis theoretically <br>but does not appear to follow them at all in<br>actual practice; and  Indian music,<br>which uses 12 tweaked pitches (*NOT* the<br>same as those in western music) with<br>extensive highly microtonal inflexions around<br>these pitches.<br>Some highly respected Indian musical <br>scholars claim that the 9 of 22 sruti model<br>is universal in Indian music, but it is <br>not clear whether they are talking about<br>the prescriptions of the classic Indian<br>musical texts from hundreds (often <br>thousands) of years ago, or whether they<br>are describing what most Indian musicians<br>actually do *today.*<br>There is so much controversy, so many<br>dubious claims, and so much bad data about<br>both types of "Indian music" that it would<br>be better to leave this topic off entirely.<br>It is clear that western theorists do *not*<br>understand the nature of the intonation<br>used in either North or South Indian music,<br>if indeed a single type of intonation is<br>used in either (there may be as many<br>intonations as there are pandits). In fact<br>there is violent and ongoing controversy<br>among both North and South Indian music<br>theorists, as well as *between* them,<br>primarily because of the British Raj.<br>Whole generations of South & North Indian <br>music theorists and researchers travelled<br>to Britain to absorb a "modern" education<br>and in the process they were brainwashed <br>by the very strong British just intonation<br>movement of the 1910s-1930s.  (B. <br>Chaitandra Deva is the most glaring<br>example, but there are many others.) Thus<br>a great many of the texts written by<br>Indian music theorists about Indian music<br>in English between the 1930s and the 1970s<br>are in fact regurgitations of the British just <br>intonation theories by way of Perronet Thompson, <br>Kathleen Schlesinger, Poole, et alii.<br>I've read the texts of these Anglicized Indian music<br>theorists *and* those of foreigners who claim to<br>"explain" the "true" intonation system used in<br>North or South India.  The purported "limit" and number<br>of pitches used in Indian JI is in every case  different <br>(Danielou claims 11-limit, B. C. Deva claims 31-limit, <br>Dudon claims 7-limit, Jhairazbhoy claims it's non-JI, <br>and so on).  For a convincing debunking of these "just <br>intonation Indian tuning" claims, read "Intonation in <br>present day North Indian Classical music," Bulletin<br>of the School of Oriental and African Studies,<br>University of London, 1963, vol. 26,  pp. 118-132. <br>For an equally convincing and authoritative description<br>of the classical just 9 of 22 sruti Indian tuning<br>system by an eminent Indian scholar, see the web<br>page for Indian music. (I won't give you the URL<br>because it is of course dead with a 404 by now.<br>At the rate telcos are being taken over, URLs<br>last about 2 weeks nowadays.) <br>Alas,  B. C. Deva's text "Psychoacoustics<br>and Music" provides no experimental or<br>theoretical justification for his claim of<br>a 31-limit JI North Indian classic tuning, <br>though it does provide strong evidence for<br>a link between the timbre of the tambura<br>drone and the pitches of the scale.<br>Deva's book could be the result of his<br>absorption in Britain of British ji theories<br>about India. Or it might be an accurate and<br>factual description. "Perceptual, Acoustical and Musical<br>Apsects of the Tambura Drone" is perhaps the<br>best serious and worthwhile modern study<br>using scientific methods (Carterette et al. in<br>"Music Perception," 7(2), 1989, 75-108) written<br>in English by an Indian music theorist. Krumhansl's <br>"studies" on North Indian classical music are worthless<br>inasmuch as Prof. Krumhansl claims that the 7<br>modal pitches of North Indian classic music<br>are identical to the 7 white keys of the piano.  <br>Right.<br>Put on *your* CDs of North Indian classical <br>music, and tell me *you* believe that.<br>The only conclusive result of all these studies and<br>claims and theories is that no one, Anglo-Saxon<br>or Indian, has made a convincing case<br>for just intonation or any other specific<br>intonational model in the actual performance<br>of contemporary present-day Indian music.  The<br>measured data from oscillographs and<br>melographs, where they exist, (in the Jairazbhoy<br>1963 article, in particular) systematically<br>contradict all the proposed intonational<br>models.<br>In "12. Equal-tempered versions of meantone,"<br>Paul Erlich has gotten very close.  However,<br>31-TET (1/4-comma meantone) and 19-TET<br>(Salinas' 1/3-comma meantone) should be<br>supplemented with 55-TET, which the German<br>composers considered the acme of intonational<br>perfection. Froberger, Handel and in particular <br>Georg Philip Telemann considered a subset of 55-TET  <br>supremely musical: Georg Andreas Sorge mentions <br>Telemann by name in his 1748 text "Gespra"ch<br>zwischen einem musico theoretico und einmen<br>studioso musices" (Conversation between a<br>music theorist and a student of music): <br>"Besser gefa"llt mir das beru"hmten Herrn<br>Capellmeister Telemanns `Systema Intervallorum'<br>also welcher die Octav in 55. geometrische <br>Beschnitte (commata) die von Stufe zu<br>Stufe keiner werdern, theilet."  (A rough<br>translation: "The well-known Herr Cappelmeister<br>Telemann's `Systema intervallorum' pleases me<br>better, in which the octave is sliced up into 55<br>units [commata] which become smaller from<br>top to bottom.")<br>Erlich's idea of comparing 22-equal with the<br>22 theoretical ji sruti is excellent.  Side-by-<br>side *audible* comparison are *extremely* <br>important;  words on a page or figures<br>on a chart are cold and deaf and silent.<br>Words & diagrams don't do nearly as much as <br>sound examples to clarify these musically <br>important differences.<br>The progression from "introduce the 7-limit <br>consonances" in #17 to "equal-tempered<br>representations of higher consonances"<br>in #20 to "inharmonic timbres" and then<br>"non-octave scales" seems haphazard, but<br>perhaps given a Pythagorean model there is<br>no straightforward way to proceed from the<br>7-limit to inharmonic non-Pythagorean<br>anti-western models of harmony/melody.<br>--<br>Overall, Paul Erlich's proposed course would<br>prove useful in teaching students about<br>harmony from a western Pythagorean <br>viewpoint and then gently extending it<br>in modest ways.<br>As far as breaking students out of their<br>Pythagorean zombification and leading them<br>to discover alternative melodic and<br>harmonic paradigms, Erlich's might not be<br>the best curriculum.<br>--<br>An alternative curriculum could be<br>constructed historically.  Starting<br>with the neolithic bone flute recently<br>discovered in an archaeological dig<br>in France, microtonality could be<br>shown to predate the invention of<br>writing, and xenharmonics could<br>be demonstrated as one of the oldest<br>human activities (the 15,000-year-old<br>bone flutes do not appear to have used<br>12 equal tempered tones. Gosh, what a<br>surprise, eh?).<br>>From there, reference could be made to<br>the picture of the mouth bow in the<br>10,000-yr-old paintings on the Trois Freres<br>caves, and subsequently Otto Neugebauer's<br>"The Exact Sciences In Antiquity" could<br>be used along with examples of tunings<br>from Side 2 of tablet U7/80 of the British <br>Museum.<br>(This  tuning, written in Old Babylonian <br>is, conveniently, Pythagorean.  Say that<br>five times fast!)<br>>From there, reference could be made<br>to 5th-century Greek theories of music--<br>specifically Artistoxenos' advocacy<br>of equal temperament contrasted with<br>the Pythagorean enthusiasm for 3-limit. <br>(John Chalmers will no doubt point out<br>that Aristoxenos' famous quotation is<br>ambiguous, to which I must respond<br>that there are still UFO conspiracy theories<br>about JFK's assassination.  No evidence <br>is 100% completely totally unambiguous.<br>The gist, however, seems clear.)<br>Then tetrachords, tonoi, genera, and<br>onward to the drastic change in limit <br>from 3 or 7 or11 or 13-limit Greek paradigms<br>(depending of whether or not you buy<br>Kathleeen Schlesinger's fanciful ideas,<br>and how you date the collection of tunings<br>compiled by Ptolemy) all the way <br>down to 3-limit 7th-century  tunings <br>as specified in Boethius ca. 600 A.D.<br>The controversy over dividing the<br>whole tone could be dealt with as<br>a continuation of the Aristoxenian/<br>Pythagorean conflict--these two<br>attitudes toward music are diametrically<br>opposed and cannot be resolved; the<br>Pythagorean view elevates pure theory<br>and numbers as source of valid intonation,<br>while the Aristoxenian view elevates<br>the evidence of the senses as the<br>supreme arbiter of intonation.  In fact<br>these are more than attitudes toward music,<br>they are fundamental to the antipodally<br>opposing approaches to science in the western<br>world--namely, applied science vs. pure<br>theoretical science.<br>The vehement controversy between the<br>followers of Walter of Odington and<br>the neo-Pythagoreans could be detailed<br>throughout the 14th century, not neglecting<br>to mention the role of Odo of Cluny, and<br>the rich history of Renaissance tunings<br>(19, 31, 34, 55, many different meantones,<br>as well as pure ji as advocated by di Doni<br>and others) following the introduction of<br>Napier's logarithms could be dealt with.<br>The supremacy of meantone and its <br>reign in European music until the 1840s <br>should be mentioned, as well as the importance<br>of the Maudslay lathe in dethroning meantone.<br>(Since you are scholars the connection will<br>be obvious.)  The role of Helmholtz and<br>his followers should be contrasted with<br>the British and American ji movements<br>in the western hemisphere and the <br>controversy twixt Russian advocates of<br>pure ji and xenharmonic equal temperaments<br>in the GKHN during the 1920s. (Since you<br>are scholars you are of course familiar<br>with the roles played by Sabaneev and<br>Avraamov in Russian microtonality during<br>the 1920s and 1930s, as well as Alexei<br>Stepanovich Ogolevets' anticipation of Krahenbuehl<br>& Schmidt in his 1948 text "An Introduction to <br>Contemporary Musical Thought," which itself<br>elaborates on Yasser's historical-determination<br>theory of tunings but in a direction which leads<br>to 17- & 22-TET rather than 19-TET as the "4th <br>stage" of musical evolution.)<br>>From there the path would be clear to discuss<br>the modern history of tuning, which is<br>inherently polyintonational. The days of<br>"one tuning ueber alles" are over, despite the<br>best efforts of the dunderheads at Lincoln<br>Center. (They should put an iron gate in front<br>of the door engraved with the words ARBEIT<br>MACHT FREI.)<br>--<br>Jose Antonio-Martin Salinas wanted to know<br>whether it was appropriate to spend an<br>entire hour of a 15-hour lecture on tuning<br>theory discussing non-octave tunings.<br>Of course it is not at all appropriate to<br>spend so little time on non-octave tunings;<br>a full three or four hours should be spent on<br>non-octave tunings, inasmuch as the set<br>of non-octave ETs perceptually include all<br>of the octave = 2.0 scales.  (See my paper<br>"The Uses and Characteristics of Non-Octave<br>Scales" in Xenharmonikon 14 for more details.)<br>In all justice, 5 hours ought to be spent on<br>nj net scales particularly in other cultures<br>(Balinese, Javanese, African, Guatamalan,<br>etc.) and 5 hours should to be lavished on<br>just intonations greater than 3-limit,<br>with the remaining 5 hours dealing with<br>octave = 2  and octave <> 2 equal temperaments.<br>That is, 5 hours each on NJ NET, ET and<br>ji tunings.<br>The importance of non-octave scales is<br>so vast that I would keep the theory to<br>a minimum and spend most of the time<br>immersing students in the exotic, delicious<br>sound of various Nth root of K non-octave <br>scales.  Once they've experienced the richness<br>and acoustic beauty of non-octave scales,<br>they'll be irrevocably hooked--it's like living in<br>a monochromatic desert all your life and<br>suddenly being transported to the middle of<br>a technicolor rain forest.

This<br>idea is interesting and innovative.  However,<br>it's important to point out a source of <br>possible confusion here.<br>My posts on pyschoacoustics have described<br>in detail the fact that the mathematical and<br>perceptual octave are different entities,<br>especially when the octave is heard as an<br>isolated interval.  Psychoacoustic experiments<br>do indeed show that isolated intervals are<br>heard as "too flat" and "too narrow" and "impure"<br>when they are tuned to a precise 2:1 ratio,<br>whereas an interval of approximately 1208-1215<br>cents is heard as "pure" and "in tune" and "just."<br>However, what we are discussing here is<br>*sensory consonance.*  This is consonance<br>as measured by psychoacoustic experiments.<br>It is the consonance perceived by observers<br>under experimental conditions.  It is consonance<br>of isolated intervals in a non-musical setting.<br>This is not necessarily the same thing <br> as *musical consonance.*<br>Musical consonance is dependent on *context*.<br>It is judged in a musical setting.  Musical<br>consonance is dependent not only on timbre<br>and beats and the width of the critical band,<br>it is also dependent on the preceding harmonies,<br>the nature of the music's melodic stucture,<br>and most importantly it is determined by the<br>intonation itself.<br>It is very important to make this distinction<br>between *sensory consonance* and *musical<br>consonance* because the two are not generally<br>distinguished in music theory.  In fact Hermann<br>Helmholtz intentionally and purposely conflated<br>the two--Helmholtz claimed that sensory <br>consonance was completely equivalent to<br>musical consonance.  <br>Yet it is clear that this is often not the case.<br>One of the best examples is the stretched Balinese<br>octave. Heard as an isolated interval, this 1215-cent<br>octave  can sound questionable.  But it is never<br>played in isolation in Balinese music.<br>When a Balinese gamelan plays, there's a constant<br>tinkling shimmering gonging interplay of partials<br>that make the partials seem to sizzle in the air,<br>and the beats thus produced are integral to the<br>musical effect.  Individual intervals sound quite<br>different in terms of their consonance from the<br>same intervals played in rhythmic counterpoint<br>with mass masses of other notes, whose timbre<br>blends into one huge shimmering klangfarbenmelodie.<br>Indonesian gamelan tuners know this so well that<br>they point out that an individual metallophone cannot<br>be fully tuned until the entire gamelan has been<br>rough-tuned; the entire timbral wash is needed<br>to fine-tune any one metallophone in the <br>ensemble.<br>This is a *very* important point.  <br>Our ears have a remarkable ability to<br>pick up on the structure embedded within<br>an intonation and to fit various harmonic<br>and melodic progressions into that <br>embedded structure.  A great deal of<br>subconscious processing goes on when<br>we listen to music; our ear/brain system<br>is extraordinarily sophisticated at <br>extracting and recognizing patterns<br>buried in the intonation of the music<br>to which we listen.<br>The net result is that we must be careful<br>not to pursue sensory consonance at the<br>expense of musical consonance.  While<br>as Johan Sundberg points out it is vital<br>not to mistake mathematical for perceptual<br>intervals, it is even more vital *not* to<br>give up musical consonance in the pursuit<br>of sensory consonance.<br>Thus Kami's suggestion of stretching just<br>intonation tunings makes good sense as <br>far as increasing the sensory consonance<br>of the intervals.  However, stretching the<br>intervals in a just array disarranges most<br>of the mathematical relationships between<br>the octave and the component just intervals.<br>This can be a significant loss if those<br>relationships are used musically.  Moreover,<br>this is not just a matter of mathematics;<br>the ear can hear the musical structure<br>embedded with a just intonation scale.  <br>Disjointing this structure for the sake of<br>improving sensory consonance might prove<br>musically successful--or it might not.  My<br>guess is that it will depend on the musical<br>context.<br>--<br>On another point:<br>An extremely superficial understanding of<br>my criticisms of theories of just intonation<br>on this forum leads to the false conclusion<br>that I am out to debunk just intonation.  <br>Nothing could be further from the truth.  If<br>this is what people have come away with<br>by reading my posts on psychoacoustics<br>then they have completely misunderstood<br>my point.<br>Instead, my point is that the arguments used<br>by JI advocates in favor of just intonation do<br>not hold water.  Hermann  Helmholtz and<br>Partch (following Helmholtz's lead) both<br>tried to claim that western music was based<br>on the harmonic series, and that therefore<br>sensory consonance could be directly equated<br>to musical consonance, and that therefore<br>just intonation is musically superior and<br>musically preferable to any other system<br>because just intonation offers maximal<br>sensory consonance and direct use of the<br>harmonic series in music.<br>These arguments in favor of just intonation<br>have actually been extremely damaging to<br>the cause of JI.  As psychoacoustics and<br>digital synthesis have progressed by leaps<br>and bounds, it has become increasingly<br>clear over the last 100 years that sensory<br>consonance is not at all necessarily the same<br>thing as musical consonance, and that as a<br>result many exotic and beuatiful yet <br>inharmonic timbres and intonations can<br>be developed which nonetheless sound<br>musically effective and very beautiful.<br>The problem with the Helmholtz/Partch/<br>Johnston/Doty argument in favor of just<br>intonation is that it creates a Manichean<br>dichotomy: once we accept the premise that<br>the harmonic series is the end-and and the<br>be-all of music, all musical structures not<br>based on the harmonic/subharmonic series<br>must be regarded as musically inferior, to<br>be purged, expurgated, reviled, cast down<br>into darkness.<br>This is a big problem because it immediately<br>puts the listener in the position of having to<br>revile and abjure all the music s/he has<br>heard over a lifetime...since virtually all of<br>the music all of us hear while we grow up<br>is, of course, 12 tone equal temperament.<br>Yet anyone interested enough to spend years<br>studying music theory must love 12-tet music<br>dearly indeed.  So this creates a huge problem<br>for the just intonation advocate: you are now<br>in the position to having to convince your<br>audience that all the music they love is<br>a debased abomination, a falling-away from<br>the true faith of the harmonic series.<br>This is not a good way to attract converts<br>and gain followers.<br>The sensory consonance argument for JI<br>is also lethally flawed, because anyone<br>with a reasonable knowledge of pyschoacoustics<br>can destroy it by citing the experimental<br>evidence.  For that matter, you can utterly<br>annihilate the Helmholtz/Partch sensory<br>consonance argument simply by playing<br>pieces of music by Risset, Chowning, <br>Dashow, Harvey, et al. which use extremely<br>inharmonic timbres but which nonetheless<br>sounds beautiful.<br>Inharmonic digitally-generated timbres and<br>computer-produced and -controlled inharmonic<br>series could not be heard prior to the mid-1970s.<br>The computer power to produce such music was<br>simply not available.  Now that everyone can hear<br>and experiment with such musical timbres and<br>inharmonic series tunings, it has become starkly<br>apparent that arguments for just intonation on<br>the basis of sensory consonance do *not*<br>necessarily lead to the harmonic series, and<br>(conversely) that the harmonic series does *not*<br>necessarily lead to sensory consonance.  (Inharmonic<br>timbres with harmonic series chords produce musical<br>effects completely *unlike* those of just intonation.<br>John R. Pierce, Max Mathews, William Sethares,<br>myself and many others have produced demonstation<br>tapes showing this effect.)<br>The point of all this is that my systematic<br>demolition of the sensory consonance argument<br>for just intonation is in fact necessary to create<br>a firm foundation for the musical use of JI.  <br>Otherwise, we are building on a foundation of<br>quicksand. As for the the claim that the harmonic<br>series is the basis of all consonance intervals <br>and timbres, and that sensory consonance can <br>best be obtained from the members of the<br>harmonic series, and that therefore JI is<br>the most musical intonation because it<br>maximizes sensory consonance...  Well, as<br>we have seen, all of these arguments are<br>incorrect because all of the premises are<br>false.  And so, to use these lethally flawed<br>arguments for just intonation is merely to<br>create a wonderful oportunity for those<br>hostile to new music to shoot down just<br>intonation wthout even hearing it.<br>A much more powerful argument for just<br>intonation is the "Mount Everest" argument.<br>Like Everest, just intonation is there--<br>why not explore it?<br>While it's extremely easy for any narrow-<br>minded conservative hater of new music<br>like the abysmally ignorant Paul Griffiths<br>(current music critic for the New Yorker)<br>to demolish the "natural interval" or<br>"harmonic series" or "sensory consonance"<br>justification of JI, it's extremely hard<br>for even the most narrow-minded musical<br>reactionary to convince anyone that we'd<br>all be better off if we didn't open our<br>ears and explore potentially beautiful new<br>JI harmonies and melodies.<br>This argument for JI puts the shoe on the<br>other foot--reactionaries like Griffiths must <br>now show their true colors and argue against open-<br>mindedness if they want to prevent anyone<br>from trying JI on this basis.<br>--<br>To return to the original point, then, Kami's<br>idea of stretching JI scales is an interesting<br>one.  However, it's important not to confuse<br>sensory consonance with musical consonance,<br>and not to confuse either of those with<br>musical concordance.<br>Stretching a JI scale might heighten the<br>perceptual purity of intervals while lowering<br>the musical utility of those intervals.  If<br>stretching the scale warps or destroys the<br>internal structure of the intonation, <br>sensory consonance might be enhanced at<br>the price of creating musical discordance.<br>As always, all three quantities must be<br>balanced, and they are inextricably bound<br>up with the musical context in which <br>this occurs.<br>It would be nice to give a simpler or shorter<br>evaluation of Kami's idea...but given the<br>complexity of human hearing and the subtlety<br>of even the simplest-sounding intonation,<br>that just isn't possible.<br>--mclaren <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 26 Nov 1996 17:27 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08530; Tue, 26 Nov 1996 17:29:21 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08622<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA27803; Tue, 26 Nov 1996 08:29:18 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 26 Nov 1996 08:29:18 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.961126085212.48420A-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4170 href="#4170">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/1996 8:23:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: Muddy thinking, the scientific method and John<br> Cage - part 2 of 2<br>--<br>In the previous post, I mentioned that <br>the scientific method is crucially important in<br>microtonality.  As Aristotle points out in the Rhetoric:<br>"A speech has two parts.  You must state you case,<br>and you must prove it.  You cannot either state your<br>case and omit to prove it, or prove it without<br>having first stated it."  This is clearly an alien<br>concept to Eric Lyon and Greg Taylor: but to the<br>rest of us, it's obvious.<br>So here's concrete proof of my claim for the importance<br>of the scientific method in dealing with microtonality.<br>Tune up an open "fifth" in which the fifth has the ratio<br>2^[3/5].  This is an interval of 720 cents.  If you play<br>this interval bare using a timbre with integer harmonics<br>and plenty of high overtones, the interval will be hard<br>to take.  It may even grate on your ears.  <br>Now, however, play the progression I-IV-V-I in such<br>bare fifths, same timbre, but with I, IV, V and I in<br>15-TET.   You will suddenly discover that the interval<br>which sounded grating in the first instance now sounds<br>remarkably euphonious and concordant.<br>The ear, in short, readily accepts the 720-cent "perfect"<br>fifth as part of a multiple-of-5/oct equal tempered<br>microtonal scale.  <br>This example can be repeated with 7-TET "perfect" fifths,<br>which are nearly as far from just fifths (685.4 cents)<br>as is the flagrantly non-just 720-cent fifth of 5-TET,<br>yet which in the context of the 7-TET scale sound<br>astonishingly euphonius and perfectly acceptable. <br>Now tune up the 19-tet perfect fifth and play the<br>progression I-IV-V-I.  You'll discover that the <br>progression sounds all but indistinguishable from the<br>same progression in 12-tet, except that if you<br>use full triads the chords sounds slightly smoother<br>in 19-tet.<br>Yet theorists condemned 19-tet throughout the 19th<br>century because of its supposedly "unacceptable" <br>7-cent-flat perfect fifths.  Barbour dismissed<br>19-tet as "musically useless" for this reason--<br>yet he never even *heard* music in 19-tet.<br>Without experiment to serve as a check on our purely<br>mathematical calculations, we cannot even begin to<br>approach microtonality in an intelligent way.<br>Instead, we would find ourselves flailing like bugs<br>stuck in yogurt, as Eric Lyon and Greg Taylor have<br>done repeatedly on this tuning forum.  Without physical<br>and psychoacoustic experiment to back up our claims,<br>we would make foolish unproven statements which turn<br>out to be nonsense--as Eric Lyon and Greg Taylor have<br>done repeatedly on this tuning forum.<br>--<br>It's worth taking two posts to discuss the various<br> remarkably feeble defenses offered in service of<br>John Cage, charlatan, because these wan and etiolated<br>arguments in favor of Cage are symptomatic of the <br> faulty reasoning and fuzzy grasp of fact found all <br>too often on this tuning forum and throughout society <br>in general (I'm talking about American society here<br>--I can't speak for Europe).<br>Yes, ladies 'n gents, there's a *REASON* why<br>psychic help phone lines are so popular<br>in America nowadays...<br>Fuzzy thinking and slipshod logic lead to a pervasive<br>abuse of words, a wanton violation of their recognized<br>meanings, a disdain and a contempt for precision <br>in the use of the English language.<br>To use a word so fundamental to the outlook of modern<br>western culture as "experimental"  (in the way Cage <br>does) and willfully pervert its recognized meaning is<br>to grossly and culpably misuse the word "experimental."<br>This, both Cage and Lyon have done by claiming that<br>it means something other than its dictionary definition<br>as soon as we kidnap the poor word "experiment," jam<br>a hood over its head, stick a gun in its back, and <br>frog-march it into the realm of modern music.<br>Of course, if we want to make up the meaning of the<br>words we use, we are certainly free to do so.  Thus I can <br>refer to Eric Lyon as a slubberdegullion and explain by <br>this that slubberdegullion means "fine fellow."  <br>If we choose to go this route, we will quickly come<br>a-cropper, and our discourse will  degenerate into <br>pure nonsense.  We will straightways wind up talking<br>about the importance of sofas in swimming pools<br>("sofa" here means "mathematics," while "swimming<br>pool" in this context means "tuning system") and so on.<br>The only alternative, ladies and gentlement, is to<br>think clearly and use words with some concern for<br>their recognized meanings.<br>--<br>This points up the Bengal Tiger trap hidden in my<br>previous post, and into which Eric Lyon so fulsomely<br>tumbled.  <br>"A man may take to drink because he feels himself to <br>be a failure, and then fail all the more completely <br>because he drinks. It is rather the same thing [with]<br>the English language.  It becomes ugly and inaccurate <br>because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of <br>our language makes it easier for us to have foolish <br>thoughts. The point is that the process is reversible." <br>[Orwell, George, "Orwell: The Complete Essays, 1963, <br>pg. 163]<br>Alas, careless and sloppy use of words--particularly<br>of terms borrowed from the sciences--is a chronic<br>problem in music theory and indeed in all post-1945<br>art theory.  While John Cage was irremediably sloppy<br>and careless in his use of words, he is far from<br>atypical of modern art theorists; in fact Cage's<br>incoherenece and murkiness is symptomic of a<br>larger problem. As Orwell points out, "In certain<br>kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism<br>and literary criticism, it is normal to come across<br>long passages which are almost completely lacking<br>in meaning." [Orwell, op cit., pg. 168]  <br>--Also in modernist postwar music theory, one needs<br>must add.  The culprit, again, is the willfull misuse<br>and shameless abuse of scientific terms. <br>Eric Lyon himself touches on this important problem<br>when he states "indeed the confusion of artistic and<br>scientific methodologies is one major reason that <br>many American university music departments have<br>become somewhat inhospitable for artists." <br>To put it bluntly, if you propose to use terms borrowed<br>from the sciences you had better use them properly<br>and with some  understanding.  Cage did not.<br>Eric Lyon does not.  Most modern "music theorists"<br>do not.<br>If you fail to properly use terms borrowed from<br>the sciences, you are practicing pseudo-science.<br>Another word for a person who practices <br>pseudo-science is "charlatan"--<br>which the American College Dictionary defines as<br>"1. One who pretends to more knowledge than he<br>has; a quack."  John Cage and his rivals at  Darmstadt, <br>along with PIerre Boulez' group in Paris were,<br>by dictionary definition, charlatans one and all.<br>They spouted meaningless pseudo-scientific<br>drivel, and  the intent of their "theories" appears<br>to have been to obfuscate and impress, rather than to <br>elucidate and specify.<br>This is the charge made against John Cage in my<br>topic 3 of TD 803, and the charge stands.  Eric<br>Lyon has not refuted the charge, since clearly<br>he does not understand the dictionary definition<br>of "experimental" any better than John Cage<br>did.<br>I don't blame Eric Lyon for this, any more than I<br>hold Greg Taylor responsible for the fractured logic<br>and twisted reasoning of his posts.  Clearly these <br>people are the victims of an educational system <br>which has turned out college graduates who can't <br>locate England on a world map and who think <br>Neville Chamberlain was a basketball player.<br>Because they have never been taught to think<br>clearly or trouble themselves about the meaning<br>of the words they use,  these casualties of a failed<br>system of so-called "higher" education are singularly<br>vulnerable to argument by authority and proof<br>by assertion. <br>Lyon tries his hand at the latter when he states<br>"The most cursory glance at Cage's writings<br>displays his obvious intelligence and musical<br>knowledge." <br>This is an attempt at proof by mere unsubstantiated <br>claim.  As we all know, this is no proof at all.  <br>Countless crackpots have uttered unsubstantiated <br>claims with great conviction... which claims turn <br>out to be utter bilge.<br>The most memorable example? Cyrus Teed.  <br>This 19th century cult leader claimed  that the <br>earth was not spherical but hollow and that we <br>all live on the inside.  Teed stated that the<br>convexity of the earth's surface was due to<br>"an unfortunate optical illusion."  <br>Teed made his claim with great authority,<br>enough  to convince hundreds of followers.<br>Need I say more?<br>Perhaps I do.  Lyon speaks of what we learn from<br>"the most cursory glance at the writings of John <br>Cage."  <br>Fine.  Let's take a cursory glance.<br>Cage writes:<br>"Does being musical make one automatically stupid and unable<br>to listen?  Then don't you think one should put a stop to studying<br>music?  Where are your thinking caps?" [Cage, John, "Silence,"<br>page 49]<br>Let's see:<br>Studying music must...therefore "make one automatically stupid."<br>Right.<br>--<br>Again:<br>"For in this new music nothing takes place but sounds: those<br>that are notated and those that not." [Cage, John, "Silence,"<br>page 7]<br>This is true of *all* music.  And so what? A fine example<br>of a meaningless truism, since music by definition involves<br>sounds, and all sounds performed in a musical concert are<br>either notated, or not notated. <br>This like saying "The visual arts involve optical aesthetic<br>objects" or "the defining quality of a circle is its circularity."<br>In short, this is trivial crap dolled up in pompous<br>language to pass as profundity. Typical of Cage's writing.<br>-- <br>Again:<br>"What might have given rise, by reason of<br>the high degree of indeterminacy, to no <br>matter what eventuality (to a process)<br>becomes productive as a time-object."<br>[Cage, J., "Silence," pg. 28]<br>A simpler way to say this is: "shit happens."<br>Why didn't Cage say that?  Could it be because<br>if he did, we would realize how assininely<br>otiose the statement is?<br>Any "thing" which "gives rise" to "no matter<br>what eventuality" eventually becomes "a<br>time-object" in music.  This is as true<br>as it is meaningless.<br>--<br>Again:<br>"Musical habits include...the study of the<br>timbres, single and in combination of a limited<br>number of sound-producing mechanisms.  In <br>mathematical terms these all concern discrete<br>steps." [Cage, John, "Silence," page 9]<br>Here Cage makes the ignorant blunder of<br>claiming  that all sounds have spectra which<br>can be described in "discrete steps."  This<br>is completely wrong. In fact, many acoustic sounds<br>have continuous spectra--all noisy sounds do.<br>Cymbals, fricatives, plosives, whispered<br>speech, flute multiphonics, loud brass notes, sul<br>ponticello violin or viola or bass or 'cello<br>notes;  shaken thunder sheets, guiros,<br>guajiras, shakers, rasps,  drums, brushed<br>metal plates, banged rocks, tambourines, etc.<br>Only a very few instruments exhibit <br>anything *like* discrete overtones<br>and even then--as Xavier Sera showed in his<br>Stanford doctoral thesis--*all* sounds <br>have an acoustically important stochastic<br>(contuous spectrum, essentially a noise)<br>component, which (if left out) renders the<br>resynthesis much more "artificial" and harf proof by authority.<br>The Bible states that the earth was created in<br>seven days.  Who wants to argue in favor of this<br>claim?  This "authoritative" claim contradicts all<br>available fossil evidence, all available  radiocarbon <br>evidence, isotoptic-proportion evidence, evidence<br>from the microwave background radiation of the universe, <br>evidence from radial red shifts of distant galaxies,<br>ad infinitum. <br>Proof by authority might have passed muster back<br>when the Inquisition was burning witches, but<br>that method of proof doesn't cut it nowadays,<br>Eric.<br>In fact, authorities, as history shows, are usually <br>*wrong.*<br>Aristotle is a superb example.<br>Aristotle claimed that ice floats because its shape<br>does not pierce the surface of water, while iron<br>sinks because iron objects' shape do pierce the<br>surface of water.<br>Aristotle's authoritative statement was believed<br>for thousands of years, simply because Aristotle<br>was THE AUTHORITY.  No one dared question THE<br>AUITHORITY...until Galileo in the 1550s placed a<br>thin iron needle on the surface of a pan of water<br>and showed that the iron needle floated; then<br>he pushed a piece of ice under the water and<br>showed that even though its shape pierced the<br>surface of the water the piece of ice inevitably<br>rose to the surface.<br>In short, proof by authority is meaningless<br>because *no* authority is omniscient.  No matter<br>how prestigious any high panjandrum, s/he<br>can be utterly and completely wrong.  An excellent<br>modern example is Linus Pauling's proposed structure<br>for the DNA molecule.  Pauling's model used 3 strands<br>of nucleic acid, a structure which could not have<br>held together at the molecular level.  Pauling was<br>a genius, a Nobel prize winner, an authority on<br>chemistry, and he was also 100% dead wrong.<br>If we wish to separate truth from nonsense and<br>gibberish from meaningful statements, we must<br>have recourse to evidence from the physical<br>world.  Nothing else will do.  <br>So please, people, stop quoting authority figures.<br>I don't give a fat rat's ass what Milton Babbitt<br>or John Cage or Bach or Beethoven or the King of<br>Siam or Allah or Boddhisatva says, this means <br>*NOTHING* to me.<br>I'm from Missouri.  I have to be shown.  Authority<br>figures mean *zero*.  If you claim there will<br>be a dawn tomorrow, your unsubstantiated<br>opinion is amusing and no doubt charmingly<br>naive;  but if you want anyone to *believe* <br>that there will be a dawn tomorrow, you had better <br>run us through orbital dynamics and observed<br>measurement of the planets' orbits,  Newton's<br>law of gravitation and the 3 laws of motion<br>along with plenty of experimental evidence for<br>'em and (just to be on the safe side) an extensive<br>computer simulation of the solar system to<br>make sure it doesn't exhibit radically chaotic<br>behavior.  *Then* we'll  believe there *might* be<br>a dawn tomorrow.<br>Otherwise, your statements amount to meaningless<br>unproven gibberish--exactly like the statements<br>of Eric Lyon and John Cage.<br>--<br>Sadly, Eric Lyons' arguments conform to the<br>tried and true principles of pseudo-science.<br>Instead of proof, he offers only assertion;<br>instead of reference to physical evidence,<br>he genuflects to authority figures; and <br>instead of using precisely defined terms<br>clearly and coherently, he grossly misuses <br>recognized scientific terms. (Viz., the word<br>"experiment.")<br>Thus, predictably, Lyon offers no evidence to<br>back up his unsubstantiated claim that "the most<br>cursory glance at Cage's writings displays his<br>obvious intelligence and musical knowledge"<br>other than testimony to that effect by Milton<br>Babbitt. Since Babbitt is (if possible) even<br>more musically and scientifically and <br>mathematically incompetent than John Cage,<br>this is like using the testimony of a witch<br>doctor to back up the claims of a dowser. <br>In fact,  the most cursory glance at Cage's <br>writings demonstrates 4 qualities:<br>[1] Disdain for the recognized meaning<br>of  words; [2] incoherent reasoning<br>and disjointed logic; [3]  contempt for<br>scientifically demonstrated facts; [4] a profound<br>ignorance of music, mathematics, science,<br>statistics and the laws of probability.<br>--<br>Unlike Eric Lyon and so many other casualties of<br>our intellectually bankrupt system of higher<br>education who've  attempted in vain to rescue <br>John Cage from the consequences of his own gross<br>incompetence, I propose to substantiate my<br>claims that John Cage is a charlatan.  I will <br>demonstrate quote by quote and fact by fact<br>that John Cage is a musical swindler "who pretends<br>to more knowledge than he has; a quack."

"The central pitch <br>processor is the mechanism by which we<br>perceive a set of harmonic partials as<br>a signle note -- the virtual pitch -- with<br>an associated pitch. (..) Whether this process<br>is inborn or acquired, some claim prenatally,<br>is a matter of debate. Its existence is<br>not."<br>Erlich's meaning is not entirely clear. He<br>might be saying that the existence of<br>the central pitch processor is not open to<br>debate.  If so, he confutes the *process* of<br>pitch perception with the *hypothesis*<br>of a purported  "central pitch<br>processor."  In this case his claim<br>is naturally false.<br>The existence of some centralized high-level<br>mechanism of pitch detection far inside the<br>brain has been demonstrated pretty conclusively.<br>Houtsma and Goldstein conducted a series of<br>experiments in which they showed that any<br>of a set of the first 10 harmonics produced a<br>virtual pitch even when each of a pair of those<br>first 10 harmonics was presented dichotically<br>(this is, one to each ear).  <br>Since there was no opportunity for those<br>two tones to interact except in the brain,<br>some higher-level mechanism of pitch<br>perception must have been at work for<br>thos tones.<br>If this is what Paul Erlich means when<br>he says "there can be no doubt" about<br>the existence of a central pitch processor,<br>he is surely correct.<br>However, if what Paul E. means is that<br>"there can be no doubt of the existence<br>of Goldstein's postulated mechanism of<br>central processor pitch detection," alas,<br>this is incorrect.<br>While there is no doubt about the<br>reality of the *observed effect*  (virtual<br>pitch) there's strong doubt as to the hypothesized<br>cause (Goldstein's specific "central processor")<br>which might or might not exist in the human<br>auditory system. In fact, Goldstein's and Wightman's<br>theories are outmoded and have been supplanted<br>by spectral network theories of pitch perception<br>based on wetware neural nets.  Paul Erlich does<br>not mention the latest spectral network models<br>of pitch perception because he might not have<br>the space to do so in his posts...or he might be unfamiliar<br>with the full range of psychoacoustic literature.  <br>Regardless, Erlich appears to have  based his discussion <br>and his posts on a small subset of the psychoacoustic <br>literature dating from the 1970s-early 1980s, some of<br>which is outdated.  As it happens, there is strong<br>evidence against Wightman's and Goldstein's specific<br>"central processor" models, but Erlich does not<br>mention it. This might be because Erlich may <br>be entirely conversant with the all the aspects<br>of the psychoacoustic literature dealing with<br>inharmonic tones.<br>When Erlich states "there can be no debate" about<br>this or that hypothetical auditory mechanism,<br>he is not talking about psychoacoustics.<br>*Almost all* aspects of modern psychoacoustics<br>are subject to debate because most of the evidence<br>is contradictory.  Some experiments strongly<br>support certain hypotheses about how the ear/brain<br>system works, while other psychoacoustic<br>experiments strongly support *other* hypotheses.<br>Some of the evidence contradicts *all* available<br>hypotheses.<br>Worst of all, the human ear/brain system is pretty<br>much a black box.  We can't saw open someone's skull<br>and start slicing out brain tissue and zapping the<br>poor subject with electrical impulses because that<br>would be unethical.  It might tell us a good deal about<br>the precise wetware mechanisms which allow us to<br>extract pitch, but at present we can only view the<br>human brain as a sealed system and we can't muck<br>around punching in wires and burning out parts of the<br>brain to see what effect this has.  As a result, <br>psychoacoustics is more like astronomy than <br>acoustics: in astronomy you can look but you can't <br>touch.  It's impossible for an astronomer to arrange<br>for galaxies to collide to  see what happens--<br>the best you can do is try to find two galaxies that<br>probably collided and figure out what might have<br>happened.  The same is true in the human auditory<br>system--deaf subjects and stroke victims have<br>provided some of the most useful info about ear/brain<br>wetware.<br>This observation is nothing new. It's an old truism.  <br>James Clerk Maxwell pointed out in his Rede Lecture <br>in 1878 that what we would now call<br>psychoacoustics is "that untrodden wild between<br>acoustics and music, that Serbonian bog where <br>whole armies of scientific musicians and musical<br>men of science have sunk without filling it up."<br>Unlike so many earlier microtonal theorists, <br>Paul Erlich knows some hard facts about psychoacoustics,<br>and he has clearly gone to the trouble of looking up<br>some of the actual literature.  This is important, <br>because (and I'm speaking to the rest of you) you *must*<br>read the full text of the original papers to understand<br>the full range of ambiguity of psychoacoustic results,<br>and the full complexity of the human auditory system.<br>However, Paul Erlich may rely to an unwarrented degree<br>on the theories of a few researchers--Terhardt,<br>Wightman, and Goldstein--whose theories conflict<br>with the results a number of important psychoacoustic <br>experiments. <br>Terhardt has gained plenty of attention and a hefty<br>rep by performing a lot of experiments which back<br>up his mathematical place-theory model of human<br>hearing.  This is fine as far as it goes, but the problem<br>is that Terhardt has *not* bothered to mention the<br>not-so-negligible  evidence which casts *doubt* on<br>his place theory of hearing.<br>In Terhardt's theory, the primary action of the human<br>auditory system is  Fourier analysis of<br>incoming sounds into sinusoids on the basilar <br>membrane of the inner ear.  Other effects--such as<br>virtual pitch--are considered by Terhardt to<br>constitute "secondary sensations" derived from<br>the primary Fourier analysis.<br>What are the problems with this theory?<br>First, Terhardt's mathematical model gives predictions<br>which conflict with a signifcant amount of psychoacoustic <br>data.<br>For one thing, Terhardt's theory stumbles on the<br>minor triad, as Richard Parncutt has pointed out.<br>For another thing:<br> In "Hearing A Mistuned Harmonic In An<br>Otherwise Periodic Complex Tone," William<br>Morris Hartmann, Stephen McAdams and Bennett<br>K. Smith point out that "The predictions of the<br>algorithm, calculated from the formulas<br>given in Terhardt et al. (1982), are shown in Fig.<br>14.  The figure shows predictions for -4% and<br>+4% mistuning; the predictions for other values<br>of mistuning actually used in our experiments lie<br>ebtween the curves for -4% and +4%.  The algorithm<br>predicts a shift for zero mistuning (harmonic <br>complex), approximately midway between curves for<br>-4%R and +4%, although Peters et al. (1983) did not<br>find such shifts.<br>"Comparing the predicted shifts with the observed<br>shifts shows that he algorithm correctly predicts<br>the trends of the data when the mistuning is positive.<br>When te mistuning is negative, however, the algorithm<br>fails completely. Experimentally, negative mistuning<br>usually leads to negative pitch shifts.  By contrast,<br>the algorithm predicts positive pitch shifts for negative<br>mistuning. (..)  The fact that [Terhardt's] algorithm fails <br>so badly for negative mistuning suggests that there is<br>something quite wrong with the idea that pitch shifts<br>are mainly determined by partial masking." [Hartmann,<br>W. M., McAdamas, S., and Smith, B. K., "Hearing a Mistuned<br>Harmonic In An Otherwise Periodic Complex Tone,"<br>J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 88, No. 4, 1990, pg. 1722]<br>--<br>Partial masking is at the center of Terhardt's theory,<br>and these data strike a serious blow at partial<br>masking in pitch perception.  Paul Erlich does not mention<br>this because he may not be aware of it: his grasp of<br>the psychoacoustic literature might be incomplete, or<br>perhaps he simply didn't space in his post.<br>(For the other experiment in which Terhardt's<br>theory failed to accurately predict results, see<br>"Pitch of Components of a Complex Tone," Peters,<br>R. W., Moore, B. C. J., and Glasberg, B.R., Journal of <br>the Acoustical Soc. Am., Vol. 73, 1983, pp. 924-929.)<br>So not only does Terhardt's theory fail several basic<br>psychoacoustic experiments  badly, the entire<br>theory of virtual pitch as a secondary effect<br>derived from the operation of the basilar membrane<br>ignores a significant body of evidence pointing to<br>the operation of temporal mechanisms of pitch<br>perception and timbral resolution, as well as<br>a large amount of evidence *against* the place<br>theory throughout much of the musical range.<br>--<br>Why, for instance, doesn't the ear seem to use<br>basilar membrane information to detect pitch<br>below about 500 Herz?<br>David M. Green pointed out in 1970 that "Pairs of<br>waveforms having identical energy spectra were<br>generated using a technique developed by Huffman.<br>A pair of such waveform differ only in their<br>phase spectra.  The discriminability of such<br>waveforms was measured under various <br>conditions.  (..) The results of these experiments<br>suggest that the ear can discriminate differences<br>in temporal order as small as 2.5 msec." [Green,<br>D. M. and Patterson J. H.,  "Discrimination of Transient <br>Signals Having Identical Energy Spectra,"  J. Acoust.<br>Soc. Am., Vol. 48, No. 4, pp. 894-905]<br>If the ear can reliably discriminate between a waveform<br>and its inverse, clearly the ear is not in that frequency<br>range operating according to spectral analysis--since<br>a waveform and its inverse have exactly identical<br>Fourier magnitude spectra.

Insofar as these<br>results support temporal fine-structure theories<br>of pitch perception, they are incompatible with<br>the theories of pitch perception we cited<br>at the beginning of this paper (Goldstein, 1973;<br>Terhardt, 1973; Wightman 1973b)." [op cit., pp. 102-3]<br>Notice that Kubovy and Martin*specifically* identify<br>Terhardt's, Wightman's and Goldstein's models<br>(the latter 2 are papers which conjecture the<br>existence of a "central pitch processor") as<br>*incompatible* with their experimental results.<br>Other embarrassing problems include an unwonted<br>sensivity to the phase of high harmonics in<br>determining the virtual pitch of the tone complex.<br>According to Terhardt's theory, the ear/brains system<br>should ignore phase, but in fact phase is vitally<br>important to determining fundamental pitch below<br>500 Hz and above about 5000 Hz.<br>--<br>John R. Pierce points out in "Periodicity and Pitch<br>Perception" that "Investigations of just noticeable<br>differences (jnd's) of pitch continue to indicate the<br>plausibility of two 'pitch mechanisms,' the first<br>operating on resolved harmonics, and the second<br>'periodicity pitch' mechanism on unresolved<br>clusters of harmonics (Houtsma and Smurzynski, 1990)<br>as discussed earlier by de Boer (1976). (..)<br>"The shape of the curve of jnd versus pulse rate suggests<br>a transition between two mechanisms between 62.5<br>and 500 pulses per second. <br>"Such a transition is supported by experiments on <br>matches between periodic all-positive pulses and<br>periodic patterns of positive and negative pulses,<br>carried out by Flanagan and Guttman (1960), Guttman <br>et al. (1964), and Rosenberg (1966). At low frequencies<br>the match is on pulse rate; at higher frequencies the '<br>match is on fundamental frequency." [Pierce, J. R., <br>"Periodicity and Pitch Perception," J. Acoust. Soc.<br>Am., 90 (4), October 1991, pg. 1989]<br>The failure of the ear's Fourier analysis below<br>500 Hz to account for observed pitch perception<br>is a long-standing weakness of place theories of<br>hearing, and Terhardt's theory does not solve<br>this problem.  Terhardt's paper never mention<br>or explain the results of Gutman & Newman's<br>1960 experiments, but they're also crucial because<br>they also provide hard evidence for periodicity <br>mechanisms of pitch perception.<br>One of the most serious problems for a theory<br>of place-type pitch perception like Terhart's<br>(in which periodicity mechanisms of pitch<br>perception are conjured away) is that while central<br>processor models are forced on us by the finding that<br>dichotic harmonics 3, 4 and 5 are most important to<br>virtual pitch (Ritsma, R. J., "Frequencies Dominant in the<br>Perception of the Pitch of Complex Sounds," J. Acoust. <br>Soc. Am., Vol. 42, 1967, pp. 191-198;  also Plomp, R.,<br>"Pitch of Complx Tones, J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 41,<br> 1967, pp. 1526-1533) and particularly the finding<br>by Houtsma and Goldstein (1972) that 2 successive<br>simultaneous harmonics with frequencies nf[o] and<br>(n+1)f[o] are presented to different ears they evoke<br>a fundamental pitch percept equally as effect as<br>a monotic or diotic presentation of the same two<br>harmonics, *nonetheless* phase is crucially important<br>to the perception of pitch below 500Hz and above<br>5000 Hz.  Whenever phase becomes crucial in<br>pitch perception, by definition the mechanism<br>must be temporal and not spectral.<br>Moreover, in an intriguing experiment in which "the<br>perception of musical pitch was investigated in <br>postlinguistically deaf subjects with cochlear implants,"<br>the pure periodicity theory of hearing received a shot<br>in the arm.  "Within a range of low pulse rates, subjects<br>defined the intervals mediated by electrical pulse<br>rate by the same ratios which govern musical intervals<br>of tonal frequencies in normal-hearing listeners.<br>It may be concluded that tempral cues are sufficient<br>for the mediation of musical pitch, at least for<br>the lower half of the range of fundamental frequencies<br>commonly used in music."

F.,<br>"Melody Recognition and Musical Interval Perception by<br>Deaf Subjects Stimulated with Electrical Pulse Trains<br>Through Single Cochlear Implant Electrodes," J. Acoust.<br>Soc. Am., 98(2), August 1995, pg. 886]<br>This provides strong evidence in favor of a strictly<br>temporal mechanism of pitch perception at frequencies<br>below about 500 Hz and at least a plausible mechanism<br>for temporal explanations of consonance throughout<br>the auditory range (though there are also problems<br>with purely temporal models of pitch perception above<br>5 khz--nerve-coding theories shouldn't work at frequencies<br>that high because the volley rate has topped out!)  As<br>I mentioned, there is a lot of data for *and against*<br>ALL the proposed models of pitch perception.<br>As of 1993, most references on psychoacoustics considered<br>UNRESOLVED the question of whether place or periodicity <br>mechanisms are primary in the human ear/brain system.<br> Despite Paul Erlich's emphasis on the theories of Terhardt,<br>Goldstein and Wightman, there's vigorous & ongoing & unresolved<br>debate between place theories of pitch perception like<br>Terhardt's *and* temporal periodicity theories of pitch<br>perception, *and* combination theories which seek to<br>combine elements of both. "Several theories have been<br>proposed to account for residue pitch. Theories prior <br>to 1980 may be divided into two broad classes. The first,<br>spectral theories, propose that the perception of the<br>pitch of a complex involves [Fourier analysis followed<br>by] a pattern recognizer which determines the pitch<br>of the complex from the frequencies of the unresolved<br>components (Goldstein 1973; Terhardt 1974).

Atoms<br>are interchangeable and identical; musical intervals <br>are not.<br>If you read Hiller's 1956 book carefully, you will <br>realize that Hiller himself understood that his<br>experiments demonstrated the failure of his<br>mathematical model of human musical cognition.<br>Hiller claims that he was not interested in the<br>aesthetic result of his "experiments," but if you<br>read between his lines you can detect the clear<br>disappointment he felt in not producing more<br>human-sounding music (or, to put it another way,<br>the ease with which listeners could tell that<br>the music went nowhere).<br>Little has been remarked on Hiller's subsequent<br>efforts in this area; however, HIller's own writings<br>about his subsquent "Computer Cantata" (and a<br>listen to the work in question) prove enlightening<br>even today.<br>Unlike John Cage, Lejaren Hiller understood and <br>respected the meaning of the term "experimental."<br>Unlike John Cage, Hiller recognized that science<br>demands hard numbers in order for an experiment<br>to be meaningfully called an experiment.  Unlike<br>John Cage, Lejaren Hiller formulated a mental <br>model of a physical process (composition as <br>filtered noise subjected to modus ponens<br>logic in the form of a rule-set); unlike Cage,<br>Hiller reduced his mental model to mathematics<br>(encapsulated in a computer program); unlike<br>Cage, HIller generated a testable hypothesis<br>from his mathematical equations (composition<br>can be generated using such a computer program<br>which is both statistically and perceptually<br>indistinguishable  from compositions produced<br>by humans); unlike Cage, Hiller tested his<br>hypothesis (set up a quartet to perform the<br>composition, and recorded the reactions of<br>people who listened to it); unlike Cage, Hiller's<br>music could therefore be meaningfully called<br>"experimental."<br>--<br>By the way, no doubt some of you will object<br>to my use of the term "computer composition"<br>in a recent post critical of that genre.<br>Many of you will claim that my post denies<br>the validity of all "computer compositions,"<br>and since many "computer composers" (Larry<br>Polansky, Carter Scholz, John Bischoff, etc.)<br>have produced interesting and worthwhile<br>music, my post is purportedly incorrect.<br>In fact this boils down to a controversy over<br>the meaning of the phrase "computer <br>composition."<br>What is a "computer composition"?  <br>Is a string quartet written out by hand and<br>using a computer only to print the score an<br>"computer composition"?  Since the<br>composer did not specify the exact number of <br>1/300ths of an inch border around the staves,  <br>these  proportions were generated outside of the<br>composer's direct control, by means of<br>algorithms.  Is such a quartet score therefore<br>an example of "computer composition"? <br>Clearly not.<br>Let us then consider a rock band whose<br>manager schedules performances using<br>a computer (with scheduling algorithms).<br>Is this "computer composition"?<br>Clearly not.<br>How about a keyboardist who performs <br>from written scores and uses a computer<br>to load different timbres into hi/r synthesizer<br>during the performance?  Is this an example<br>of "computer composition"?<br>Clearly not.<br>Let us then move on to consider a composer who<br>uses elaborate mathematics to generate timbres<br>and chords during the course of a composition.<br>Over his shoulder, the composer has an idiot<br>savant watching who observes which notes<br>the composer plays and calculates rapidly in <br>hi/r head the resulting notes and timbres <br>according to the composer's mathematical<br>procedures.  (One such prodigy, Johan Zacharias<br>Dase, boasted such astounding powers of <br>mental calculation that he calculated pi in<br>his head to 400 decimal places over the course<br>of 2 months. Thus it is humanly possible, while<br>rare, to perform such elaborate mental<br>calculations.)<br>Is this an "algorithmic computer composition"? <br>I would say not, since it can be performed by<br>a human.  To think of it another way, the elaborate<br>mathematics of the composer can surely be <br>boiled down to a set of charts and tables which<br>can be memorized.  Now if we observe that the<br>elaborate mathematics of which I speak might<br>well be figured bass notation of the Baroque<br>period (which, if reduced to a computer program,<br>would require a great deal of calculation to <br>interpret correctly in any key signature as the<br> music modulates), we realize that this<br>is a pretty standard human musical operation<br>couched in deliberately arcane terminology.<br>Obviously, it's not "computer composition"<br>if humans were performing it in the 18th century<br>as a matter of routine musical practice.<br>Now suppose we have a computer program like<br>Lejaren Hiller's which performs many millions<br>of calculations to obtain each note.  The mathematics<br>recirculate, requiring some of the output to feed<br>back into the input.  Many millions of numbers must<br>be multiplied by weights, sieved with thousands<br>of rules, and random numbers must be generated<br>by multiple 32-bit numbers by one another to<br>obtain overflow and then shifting them right or<br>left by some larger number of bits.<br>This seems a clear case of "computer<br>composition" because the process is too elaborate<br>to be performed by any conceivable human in any<br>reasonable amount of time.<br>--<br>What do all these cases have in common?<br>Clearly, we make distinctions here depending<br>on the proportion of the computer's input to<br>the process of composition.  <br>If the proportion is very high, we can speak<br>meaningfully of "computer <br>composition."  If the proportion of computer<br>input is low, clearly we are talking<br>only about computer-aided composition.<br>Thus, true "computer composition" occurs only<br>when the process of composition *demands*<br>a computer and *exclusively* a computer. If a<br>human can perform the same operations, this<br>is not "algorithmic computer composition," it's<br>merely ordinary composition *aided by computer.*<br>This leads us to a clear distinction between <br>*computer-aided composition* and *algorithmic<br>computer composition.*<br>"Algorithmic computer composition" only occurs<br>when the overwhelming bulk of the compositional<br>process takes place in the computer.  <br>If most of the compositional process is human,<br>and the computer is used merely to keep track<br>of vectors in ratio space, or display morphological<br>shapes, etc., then we are clearly speaking of <br>"computer-aided composition."<br>My comments in my recent post referred *only* to <br>computer composition--that is, to composition in<br>which the composer sets up a computer program,<br>lets it go, and walks away.<br>Computer-aided composition is a whole different<br>kettle of fish, since it is de facto human composition<br>in which the computer is used as a convenient aid.<br>The line between the two is of course blurry; as<br>the proportion of human effort to computer<br>interpretation approaches 1:1, it becomes hard<br>to say whether the computer or the human is<br>composing.<br>My earlier comments should therefore not<br>be taken as an argument against the validity of<br>all composition involving computers, but rather<br>against the validity of compositions produced mainly<br>by unaided computer operations.  To put it bluntly,<br>winding up a computer and letting it spit out music<br>on its own didn't work in 1956 and has failed miserably <br>to produce any interesting musical results in the <br>ensuing 40 years.  Changing the number of tones per<br>octave does not promise to improve that track record.<br>However, computer-aided microtonal composition is<br>a wide-open field, and promises many fascinating<br>and aesthetically worthwhile results as new<br>approaches are tried and new algorithms developed.<br>In particular, computer *aided* composition might<br>prove very helpful in harmonizing a melody line in<br>an exotic microtonal intonation with too many notes<br>per octave for humans to navigate easily.<br>--mclaren <br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 04:15 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22244; Thu, 5 Dec 1996 15:49:44 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22105<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id GAA21370; Thu, 5 Dec 1996 06:49:35 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 5 Dec 1996 06:49:35 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612050946_MC1-CBC-A5EC@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4250 href="#4250">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/1996 8:37:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: An amazing achievement<br>--<br>Congratulations to Manuel Op de Coul on<br>a magnificent achievement.  His latest<br>upgrade of the tuning program SCALA<br>more than fulfills the promise of the<br>earlier versions of the program.<br>As some of you may know, SCALA is<br>a program which allows users to<br>design, alter, combine, stretch,<br>and transmute tunings in a variety<br>of ways.  SCALA includes a vast<br>cornucopia of scale generation <br>methods: cyclic, equal-tempered<br>(octave and non-octave), polynomial,<br>Wilson CPS permutation, Pythagorean,<br>and many others.<br>However, SCALA is not merely a tuning<br>program.  It includes an entire programming<br>language which allows you to write command<br>scripts which execute automatically and<br>write huge numbers to disk.  So it's not<br>really accurate to call SCALA a "program"--<br>it's an entire tuning programming language.<br>Nothing like SCALA has ever existed before.<br>Prior attempts, like the excellent JiCalc,<br>forced users to enter each scale-step one<br>at a time, and shackled users with severe<br>constraints: only 60 scale-steps could<br>be entered, all steps had to be specified<br>as just ratios (a very bizarre requirement<br>if your scale in a non-just non-equal-tempered<br>tuning!), and so on.<br>However, Manuel Op de Coul's SCALA overcomes<br>all these limitations.<br>I must admit that previous versions of SCALA did<br>not work with any of my MIDI cards.  Perhaps it<br>was my setup, or perhaps my cards, or perhaps<br>it was the older versions of the program--but I<br>had never succeeded in transmitting a tuning<br>to any of my synthesizers.<br>However, the latest version of SCALA transmits<br>tunings to my synthesizers quickly and easily.<br>The program works with perfect transparency:<br>you simply follow Manuel's command script,<br>the synth is retuned...it's that simple.  SCALA<br>is even *easier* to use than the Mac application<br>JiCalc. (Alas, those of you who own Macintoshes<br>now know why Apple Computer will go bankrupt.<br>None of the useful programs on the old 680X0<br>Macintoshes run on the garbage Power Macs.<br>If you want to run JiCalc, here's a piece of <br>advice: buy an old Mac Plus cheap at a swap<br>meet and use it run JiCalc.  Otherwise, you're<br>out of luck.)<br>SCALA is a remarkable accomplishment. It<br>is one of the most important developments in<br>the post-1983 modern era of retunable MIDI<br>synthesizers.<br>Congratulations on a job well done, Manuel.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 5 Dec 1996 23:16 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA21775; Thu, 5 Dec 1996 18:52:22 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA20944<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA25865; Thu, 5 Dec 1996 09:52:13 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 5 Dec 1996 09:52:13 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01510103aecc46e37710@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
