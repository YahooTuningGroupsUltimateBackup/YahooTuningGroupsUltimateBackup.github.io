The accompaning tape of his "The Kingdom of Mescal" (based on a <br>Mayan story of a young man's quest for vision and knowledge) utilized <br>Opcode's sequencer, Vision, to control the Ensoniq EPS16+ sampler, the <br>Alesis D4 percussion module, and the Yamaha DX7IIFD synthesizer.  Mary <br>Platt provided excellent stage direction.<br><br>Having presented Paul's work on the AFMM, it was quite entertaining to <br>see him "moving" corporeally in his music, rather as a stick figure <br>recitalist.  The 20 minute work was roundly entertaining.  The JI was <br>most apparent in the taped music, for Paul's standard even vibrato seemed <br>to camaflage its pedigree. <br><br>Pete Rose the virtuoso recorderist presented several of his <br>improvisation/compositions.  SNSI with soprano and sopranino recorders <br>played simultaneously emphasizes beating, glissando effects, an <br>micro-relationships of sound.  "Palindrome Over the Low Notes" and "Rapid <br>Shave" allowed for singing in combination with tenor and alto recorders, <br>respectively, to finish the set.  Pete does not usually indicated exact <br>microtonal fingerings in his set pieces, preferring jazz forms and <br>humor.  However, he is most capable in written works of this kind by <br>other composers.<br><br>Virginia Johnston's "Sojourns" contained what sounded like 1/8th tone <br>passages (if they were indeed measured) in the context of a trio for <br>flute, bassoon, and clarinet (played by the composer).  Ms. Johnston 4th <br>movement "Tale" begins with "mesmerizing clarinet microtones" [from the <br>program notes] and begins an interplay with the flute and bassoon.  <br>Seasoned musician composers like Gallagher and Rose are an unfair <br>comparison to a recent graduate, but if Ms. Johnston can break out of <br>academic constraints - like matching already existing styles of composing <br>so that she can truly find her own voice - then we look forward to her <br>next and latest.<br><br>Thanks go to Dinu Ghezzu who with the NYU Composers Forum presents this <br>collaboration with the the Composers Guild of New York - now in its 15th <br>year.  Robert Pollack chairs the NJ group and though he is a pianist, he <br>has truly worked to present an exciting array of concert music.<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@ios.com<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 14 Feb 1996 22:26 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id NAA15384; Wed, 14 Feb 1996 13:25:42 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 14 Feb 1996 13:25:42 -0800<br>Message-Id: <0099DEB342EE0C94.AA73@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2552 href="#2552">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/1996 8:37:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> It's all played in the rather<br>> radical 1/3-comma meantone (some people say meaner-than-meantone)<br>> but it works well for the music.
