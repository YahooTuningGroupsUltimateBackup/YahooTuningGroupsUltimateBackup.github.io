Once you get out of the ''piano zones'', the evidence<br>starts to collapse. My recent posting on Javanese gamelan was one examplethat showed a statistically equal preference for larger, just or smaller<br>octaves, and my experiences with other musics are similar - when the tuner<br>wants the octave to beat, it doesn't matter if it is because the octaves<br>are smaller or larger than a 2:1.<br><br>I asked the maker of my gamelan what he thought about the ''pleng'' tuning<br>for the octaves I had chosen. His reply was that, in effect, I had made aconsumer choice against a particular shimmering quality caused by beatingand that singers and rebab players would have to be more careful in the<br>upper register because of the unisons, but that the tuning was not an<br>unacceptable one. He added that the tuning was more restfull, more<br>''Javanese'' than ''Balinese''. So, the rationale he gave for the non-just<br>octaves was related to timbre and difficulty in performance due to a lackof fuzziness around the pitches, to some cultural referents, and not at all<br>to a intervallic preference for stretching.
