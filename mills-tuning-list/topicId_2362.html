Ice is crystalline and<br>thus distinguishes directions by the orientation of neat rows of molecules.<br><br>Symmetry breaking also arises in cosmology and particle physics. The<br>Weinberg-Salam unification of electromagnetic and weak forces somehow deals<br>with them being like two directions that get sort of arbitrarily<br>distinguished by a spontaneous symmetry breaking, which the cosmologist tell<br>us happened as the early universe cooled down, probably in the first few<br>seconds after the big bang but I really don't know.<br><br>My excellent undergrad thermodynamics professor illustrated symmetry breaking<br>by using an inverted pendulum. Basically, if you balance a pencil on its<br>tip, at first it looks symmetric, the pencil could fall in any direction with<br>equal likelihood. But in fact it ends up falling in just one direction. So an<br>initially symmetric situation ends up being not symmetric at all. That's a<br>broken symmetry.<br><br>I suppose just rolling some dice would be a symmetry breaking operation. All<br>the sides are equally likely to come up, but then afterwards only one side<br>actually comes up on each die.<br><br>I don't see immediately how one could apply the idea of a broken symmetry to<br>tuning systems. I can sort of imagine thinking of the seven notes of a scale<br>as starting off all equally spaced, then somehow the symmetry is broken and<br>a couple of the intervals get smaller. But that seems pretty nutty.<br><br>I've thought for a long time about using statistical methods like simulated<br>annealing to do algorithmic composition. The total duration of the<br>composition is divided up into many little time slots - like a crystal is<br>made up of an array of atoms. What note to put at each time slot? At a high<br>temperature, the choice of notes is random. As one brings down the<br>temperature, some sort of orderly pattern emerges. That would be a symmetry<br>breaking.<br><br>I've never actually got around to trying this. I just plain don't know how to<br>write a program on a PC that will make the PC generate noises. My best<br>guess is to go through some sort of MIDI file. Back around 1984 good old<br>basica came with DOS and the play command did what I needed. Now every PC has<br>a CD player, but things are so complicated, I have no clue how to do the easy<br>things!<br><br>Hope my comments are useful!<br><br>Jim<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com<br>Subject:  RE: 5-Limit in India?<br>PostedDate:  29-08-97 18:22:16<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  29-08-97 18:22:21-29-08-97 18:22:21,29-08-97 18:22:08-29-08-97 18:22:09<br>DeliveredDate:  29-08-97 18:22:09<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256502.0059EE4C; Fri, 29 Aug 1997 18:22:17 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08741; Fri, 29 Aug 1997 18:22:16 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 29 Aug 1997 18:22:16 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08742<br>Received: (qmail 9497 invoked from network); 29 Aug 1997 16:22:07 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 29 Aug 1997 16:22:07 -0000<br>Message-Id: <c=US%a=_%p=Acadian-Asset%l=MARS-970829161448Z-1602@mars.acadian-asset.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
