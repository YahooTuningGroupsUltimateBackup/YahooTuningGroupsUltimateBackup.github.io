The<br>>decomposition of a sound in partials are used by composers as a primary<br>>material. They build algorithms to move from one spectre to another one.<br>>In this calculation, they usually used approximation in quarter of tone.<br><br>And in this regard, Franck brings up something that I was wondering<br>about commenting on when I originally posted the brief listings of<br>discographies for those of you interested in pursuing Spectralists<br>as the raw material of contemplation (audition)....<br><br>The thing that interests me about Brian's interest in our French<br>brothers and sisters is that (at least going on the basis of my<br>interactions with those of them I've met) they are, in some<br>respects, solidly located in the stream of good old European<br>High Modernism - the major difference being that the formalisms<br>are located in spectral analysis rather than in 12T set theory<br>formalisms. In some respects, I'd be inclined to see them as one of<br>the streams which flows from the disruption of a single, monolithic<br>concensus of what music as High Culture is about - the other ones<br>being<br><br>a: those who still remain committed to serial techniques (though<br>they may be using those means to produce "tonal" results, in some<br>cases - the formalisms remain) like, say, Lachenmann or Spahlinger, etc.<br><br>b: those who began their lives in group a but hunt for a way out or<br>through (a fair number of Dutch composers like the late Ton de Leeuw,<br>the Danish composer Poul Ruders, Walter Zimmerman, etc.<br><br>c:the minimalist/postminimalist composers (you know the drill<br>on this lot....)<br><br>Since we're graced with a number of readers and correspondents<br>from the European Community and beyond, I'd be quite interested<br>to know how they see *themselves* with regard to their own<br>cultural traditions. I still remember being somewhat surprised<br>at asking one of these younger European composers about nonET<br>work (she's pretty spectral), only to get a rather straightforward<br>"Oh, that really doesn't interest me. I don't think it's related very<br>much to what I'm doing."<br><br>With regards,<br>Gregory<br><br>P.S. Of course, our Dutch friends have the liberty of pointing with<br>some well-deserved pride to Huygens and Fokker [cue a brief fanfare<br>on the Teyler Museum organ....] - so they're off the hook!<br>______<br>>From: hyperpoodle@mail.sisna.com (Doren Garcia)<br><br>>Hello Waveophiles & Professor Ludwig Plutonium,<br><br>Actually, it's *Archimedes Plutonium* now, I believe.<br><br>>I am unfamiliar with the aesthetic of the school of 'New Complexity'. Can<br>>someone offer a synopsis of their ideas?<br><br>They are the fount of all that is evil and crapulous in the Present<br>Age. Aided by their foul ally Cage and his evil crew of cryptoZen<br>omphalocentrics, they wage a never-ending war against all true....<br><br>:-)<br><br>Actually, the term is usually used to refer to a number of younger<br>composers (I understand the term as being used to refer predominantly<br>to composers from the UK, although I'd be happy to be corrected on<br>this matter) whose work could probably be said to exist in the train<br>of the Darmstadt folks [didn't Ferneyhough teach at Darmstadt for a<br>while?]. They write agressive and energetically spiky work which<br>seems to either favor virtuousity or be impossible to play. It's the<br>closest one comes in a European concert hall to high-vol, head-bangin'<br>perceptual overload. As a personal matter, I don't care for 'em all<br>that much - my interest in them tends toward *pieces* rather than<br>a body of a given composer's work. The names you can look for are<br>(this is just for starters. I welcome additions):<br><br>Brian Ferneyhough<br>Michael Finnissy<br>James Dillon<br>Chris Dench<br><br>I think that the easiest way to fine their work for American listeners<br>is through the recordings of Dillon and Ferneyhough's work for String<br>Quartet done by the Arditti Quartet on the French label Auvidis/Disques<br>du Montaigne. They've done discs of both Dillon and Ferneyhough's work,<br>and Harmonia Mundi distributes 'em in the states - so you should be<br>able to locate them. Caveat auditor, folks - I find them an acquired<br>taste myself (although I did program some of Finnissy's work last Sunday<br>evening).<br><br>With regards,<br>Gregory<br><br><br><br><br>_<br>I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,<br>paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only<br>maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it.
