This puzzles me.<br><br>It puzzles me too, but I have had some time to think about it, so<br>I have formed some theories.<br><br>I think the major reason for the emphasis on ET, and various<br>other 'transcendental' type scales is that they are easier.  The<br>math needed to have a state-of-the-art understanding of JI scales<br>is quite thorny, IMHO, requiring actual thought, rather than just<br>punching numbers into a calculator or spreadsheet.<br><br>There are only a quite limited number of ET scales compared to<br>the number of JI scales, which is another reason it requires much<br>less effort to 'master' ET than JI.<br><br>Also there is the perception that transcendental math is 'higher'<br>than grubby old arithmetic.  Arithmetic is taught in the first<br>grade, but logarithms are only taught later.  Needless to say, I<br>disagree with this perception.<br><br>>Finally, technology is giving us keyboards with virtually<br>>continuous pitch possibilities, ...<br><br>That is what the manufacturer's of these keyboards would like you<br>to think, but actually, the pitch possibilities are far from<br>continuous.  The granularity is quite coarse, both from the<br>perspective of the relative pitch perception capabilities of the<br>ear, and from the perspective of what is possible to modern<br>technology.<br><br>Those of you who are long time readers of this list will<br>recognize that I'm back after a long absence.  <br><br>Hello again, everyone.<br><br>Marion<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 4 May 1997 16:47 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04107; Sun, 4 May 1997 16:47:39 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04131<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id HAA23163; Sun, 4 May 1997 07:45:40 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 4 May 1997 07:45:40 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01541101af9200f54919@[207.207.3.174]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
