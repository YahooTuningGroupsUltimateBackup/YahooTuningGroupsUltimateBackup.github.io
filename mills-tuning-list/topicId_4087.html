As someone who has presented shows since the<br>early 80's I would be happy to help Bill or whoever would like to put<br>together on here. I would take on the whole mess if I had backing which<br>I don't. My comments were to help an understanding of the situation. We<br>are not a "movement" in the same way as the impressionist or the<br>dadaist. In fact Breton rejections of others as not being "surrealist"<br>is closer than I wish it was. All in all, I find it funny and enjoyable.<br>I would love to meet you all in person and find a big room and let the<br>ideas and music fly. Frankly I don't find universities the "neutral"<br>environments they wish they are. They should be involved but not to the<br>exclusion of those who feel uncomfortable to their basic assumptions.<br>After all, this music exist both in and out and the conference should<br>reflect that. From knowing Erv since 1975, I would guess he would rather<br>present his work outside a university. But that is just my assumption.<br>LET US PROCEED.
