Using the matrix Pierce gives<br>of four 1/1 5/3 7/3 major chords (3:5:7) and reduction by the 3/1 <br>"tritave" (rather than the 2/1 octave), one obtains the following <br>ratios:<br> <br>V	IX	III		<br>		III	VII	I<br>			VI	I	IV<br>					IV	VIII	II<br> <br>27/49	45/49	9/7<br>		9/7	15/7	1/1(3/1)<br>			9/5	1/1	7/5<br>					7/5	7/3	49/15<br> <br>Note the equivalence between 1/1 as the dominant of one chord<br>and the mediant of the next rather than tonic (VII is not VI).<br>When reduced to one "tritave," the ratios are 1/1 49/45 9/7 7/5 <br>81/49 9/5 15/7 7/3 135/49 3/1. Alternate tunings for some tones are <br>needed in some harmonic contexts, i.e,  5/3 for 81/49, 25/9 for 135/49, <br>35/27 for 9/7 etc. However, the scale is best construed as a subset <br>of the 13th root of 3 temperament and hence has many just intonation<br>interpretations.<br> <br>As for the 12-tone chromatic scale, the so-called  "Pythagorean" <br>or 3-limit cycle of 4ths and/or 5ths tuning can be traced back to <br>the Babylonians in the 2nd millennium BCE, though some Chinese <br>legends credit a court official whose title was Ling Lun with an even <br>earlier date. <br> <br>There are many 5-limit chromatic tunings; I posted a couple of<br>dozen to the list earlier) and also published them in 1/1. <br>J. Murray Barbour's book Tuning and Temperament is a good<br>source for the historical western ones and Mandelbaum's<br>dissertation for some more theoretical and 7-limit varieties.<br> <br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 20 Nov 1995 19:19 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA03621; Mon, 20 Nov 1995 09:19:48 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 20 Nov 1995 09:19:48 -0800<br>Message-Id: <647.199511201717@altair><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
