I added empirically calibrated error correction<br>modifications to the basic program and tested these using artificially<br>constructed "sounds" having time varying amplitudes coupled with time varying<br>frequencies.<br>	I do not recall specific numbers (these are "buried" in my not very well<br>organized logs and notes), but I believe that in cases of "well behaved"<br>sounds - normal pitched singing, instrument notes at moderate volume, etc. the<br>method faithfully yielded, for a partial, the number of cycles it went through<br>over a sound's course (from under a second to several seconds for most sounds<br>I analyzed) accurate to .01 of a cycle.  Thus I believe the method would, for<br>example, give AVERAGE frequency results for, say, the second partial of a 440<br>Hz fundamental analyzed over one second to an accuracy of about one part in<br>88,000.<br>	If the results of my work would be of significant value to a researcher or<br>researchers in the field, I would like to make my programs &c. available to<br>them.  Some work would be needed to make my software "user-friendly", although<br>someone with a technical background (C programming, basic scientific<br>mathematics) might be able to make use of it quickly.<br>	I'm currently working on another research project (preparing listener<br>intonation response - e.g. preference, descriptive observations of contrasts,<br>etc. - tests to be given in late June/early July for research purposes to high<br>school/junior high school summer music campers - I'm doing another post<br>regarding this).  This limits the amount of time which I can presently give to<br>dealing with the additive analysis material, but if there is a serious need it<br>might meet I certainly would like to make it available to meet that need.<br><br>	Dave Hill</div><h3><a id=7888 href="#7888">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>5/20/1998 7:09:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Wandering tonics are another typical example used against JI renditions<br>>of many common-practice pieces.<br><br>   I'm always prompt to point out that I personally wandering tonics to be<br>more of an intriguing musical effect than a liability, so I guess I may as<br>well point it out this time too.<br><br>   Oh, I suppose I just did, eh?</div>
