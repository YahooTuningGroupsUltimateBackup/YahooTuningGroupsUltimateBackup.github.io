His ensemble<br>features his wife's vocals, a gadulka, bagpipes, tamboura, bass, and<br>percussion.  This Sofia-based ensemble virtuosically surfs the line<br>between composition and improvisation.  Stylistically they bounce from<br>Bulgarian folk, jazz, classical, avante-gard, experimental, while<br>remaining microtonal throughout.<br><br>The music "sounds" improvised throughout except for one thing...the<br>rhythmic timing is too complex for the music to not have been composed<br>aforehand.  The youthful looking Spassov has an audio cassette on the Gega<br>lablel (GC 541).  I have no idea how to get a copy.  (A great friend<br>brought it back from her home in Sofia because she knows my musical taste.<br>I must have listened to it 50 times and I have played it for people as<br>part of my top 10.<br><br>The kaval sometimes sounds like flute, sometimes as a clarinet.  The<br>intonation is remarkable for its surety and for its seeming exoticness.<br>Yet, there seems to room for doubt that Spassov and Co. are brilliant<br>musicians playing music at its most vital.  This single tape if music<br>written and arranged by Spassov is composed -- yet it completely simulates<br>improvisation.  This is exciting stuff.<br><br>I doubt there is a defined set of tones used, though it is clear that<br>players use the same pallette.  If I could afford the time and money I<br>would be out there now.  It's in the plans.  If you have loved the<br>harmonically rich singing of Bulgarian women choruses, you'll love this.  <br>Somehow I don't see any burning need to analyze what they are indeed<br>doing, microtonally speaking.  When I go out there to work with the<br>musicians I many have a better idea of their tuning aesthetic.<br><br>It's kick-ass music in the best sense of this list.<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@ios.com<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 12 Jan 1997 20:35 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA32691; Sun, 12 Jan 1997 20:38:56 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA32667<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA21580; Sun, 12 Jan 1997 11:38:54 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 12 Jan 1997 11:38:54 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701121935.OAA04992@copland.udel.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
