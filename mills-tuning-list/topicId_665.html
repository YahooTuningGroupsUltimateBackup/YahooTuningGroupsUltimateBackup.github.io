I have a<br>lot to talk about, so I divided my post into sub-topics (if the typos bother<br>you, please respond via private email): <br><br>****<br>a)Stretched JI : For beatless chords in an harmonic context, we have JI. For<br>ease of modulation, there are all the various ET's (octave or non-octave).<br>All this stuff is fine, but I have been feeling incomfortable since I red<br>McLaren's article about psychoacoustics. I learned that musicians prefered<br>stretched octaves and found the 5/4 flat. It was demonstrated that classical<br>musicians *do* use stretched intervals. (Some aspect of perception, by<br>Shackford, is a good example.) These studies make me feel inconfortable.<br>Well, I found a plausible alternative about a week ago. Why not strech the<br>scale? A typical result would be  :<br><br>[1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1] ** 136/135<br><br>           (Or you could try 61/60 as the exponent, to make it more obvious)<br><br>If listen to a "61/60" major chord and compair it to the 4:5:6 chord, you<br>might think that the chord has moved by a microtone. If this happens, either<br>concentrate on the fundamental of the chord or use a smaller exponent.<br><br>I think of this new model is good, because it is a compromise between JI and<br>the "real world" scientific data. Larry Polansky and Linus Liu postulated<br>something similar.<br><br>****<br>b)Reference pitch : First, a stupid question : Where is A4=440Hz on the<br>piano staff? I have seen references to Yamaha using a different octave, can<br>anyone clear this up? <br>I find that 'A' is not a pretty note to start a scale on. Could we use C=512cps?<br><br>****<br>c)The Real World : There are not many concerts lately. When will we be able<br>to hear live microtonal music again? (Manuel?)<br>I tried to organize a GT earlier, with not much success (I received a single<br>answer.) GT is short for "get together", it is an occasion to meet the other<br>musicians of your area. Maybe we could have a jam session or something? <br>The physical location seems to be a problem : New England is not densely<br>populated. Maybe Boston would be a better place. (But I am not sure I can<br>afford a ride there.) Anyway, maybe some of you will be interested in a<br>group activity in this area. <br><br>****<br>d)Help me! : The xenharmonic culture is non-existant where I live<br>(Sherbrooke, next to Montreal, qc.ca.) I have written a small journal called<br>"Liberte d'accord" (Freedom of tuning) to educate the local musicians. When<br>I handed a free copy to the town's authority in music writing, the answer I<br>got was a 15 minute speech about the supremacy of jazz music. That<br>discouraged me a little bit. How do you make microtonal popular? How do you<br>explain to a normal person the signification of expressions like<br>1200*log2(x) and 3//13?<br><br>--Kami<br>http://www.interlinx.qc.ca/~kami/<br>kami@interlinx.qc.ca<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 27 Jul 1996 01:30 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id QAA07046; Fri, 26 Jul 1996 16:30:06 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 26 Jul 1996 16:30:06 -0700<br>Message-Id: <31F94F86.A85@adnc.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
