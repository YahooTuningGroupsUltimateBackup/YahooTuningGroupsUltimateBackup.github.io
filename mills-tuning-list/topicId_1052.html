I learned all of this from<br>Erv Wilson. A good deal of my music tends to modulate over a wide harmonic<br>lattice of several dimension. So for the players* sake, I like to have as<br>little ambiguity as possible and would like all identical written intervals<br>to have identical size. Johnston*s notation does not do this, as it is<br>based upon a scale with a mixture of three and five intervals, and depends<br>upon identification of a tonic. Thus, within the key of C, for example,<br>Johnston*s fifths C/G and D/A are not both 3/2 intervals. Moreover,<br>Johnston*s notation obviates the fact that the conventional staff notation<br>is a perfectly natural vehicle for Pythagorean intervals. (And players of<br>bowed stringed instruments do play fifths fairly well, but need to<br>consciously correct to get thirds and other intervals in tune; outside of<br>Anglo-Irish folksong - and there only inconsistantly - I have not<br>encountered the syntonic diatonic as a _natural tendency_).  So, I use the<br>conventional notation (with potentially unlimited sharps or flats along the<br>series of fifths) to describe a basic pythagorean series, modifications by<br>the comma 81/80 and 80/81 are indicated by 45 degree slanted upward plus<br>and downward minus sign. The septimal modifications of 64/63 and 63/64 are<br>indicated by an inverted seven and an upright seven, respectively. The<br>intervals of eleven 33/32 and 32/33 are indicated by arrows up or down.<br>Additional symbols have been used for ratios of 13, 17, 19, 23, but I must<br>admit to having been rather inconsistant with them. <br>There are two pieces of self criticism that I may offer with my present<br>answers: (1) Compound ratios do become a bit notation heavy, and are slower<br>to read, but these relationships are more difficult to learn anyway, and<br>this method seems to work. (2) In very microtonal passages, pitch height<br>may not match notational height. I have decided to accept this point in<br>lieu of going to a further step and using a notation with  more than seven<br>nominals, such as the twelve-nominal notation proposed by Wilson in<br>Xenharmonikon.<br><br>I am not particularly attached to my notation but I do find it curious that<br>so many people have made transcriptions of Partch scores in Johnston*s<br>notation which goes against both the whole limit (factoring) idea of<br>Partch, and Partch*s decided invertibility. Moreover, the instances in<br>Partch*s music which are based upon the syntonic diatonic scale are<br>minimal.<br><br>Daniel Wolf, Frankfurt<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 28 Oct 1996 15:17 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03671; Sat, 26 Oct 1996 18:46:51 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05479<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA02749; Sat, 26 Oct 1996 09:46:48 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 26 Oct 1996 09:46:48 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9610261253.A24338-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3842 href="#3842">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Adam B.

Since each symbol or combination of symbols<br>represents a particular ratio, then an enharmonic spelling is necessarily a<br>different pitch.<br><br>Does your comment refer to a system such as that which is described by S.<br>Terpstra in 1/1 8:3, which uses a system which sounds to me like an ET with<br>comma or skhisma-sized scale steps?  If so, could someone please explain<br>the logic of this system to me?<br><br>Johnny R. said:<br>>My experience with Ben Johnston gives high marks for exactitude, but<br>>loses too much due to the slowness with which it is read.  Often conflicting<br>>directions are used for a single note and so a mathematical calculation<br>>is necessary.  This process takes one out of real time.<br><br>and Paul Rapoport said:<br>>I am interested in Johnny Reinhard's remarks that cents notation is<br>>helpful to performers. I can readily believe this, provided that fine<br>>discriminations aren't necessary. I imagine that performers then identify<br>>a sound or fingering with a cents designation. Would that be right?<br>><br>>I still don't like this for analytical purposes, however. I wonder<br>>whether performers prefer this notation to others or just get used to it.<br><br>Johnny's notation is especially good for his own polymicrotonal music,<br>which pledges allegiance to no system and wanders with ease from one<br>microtonal system to the next.  However, it does nothing to guide the<br>performer towards knowledge of what *kinds* of intervals are being played.<br>For example, in the early performance of his "Cosmic Rays" (I have not<br>heard the "good" tape), the performers were so steeped in the xenharmonic<br>aspects of the piece (note: *xen* harmonic) that they failed to well-tune a<br>major triad--I argue that they didn't know that they were supposed to play<br>a well-tuned chord.  Nonetheless, this is probably the best compromise for<br>such music.  It should also take a whole lot of rehearsal to do well, as<br>does all "performed" microtonal music.<br><br>Ben's notation is specifically bent towards a JI ststem which he himself<br>has stretched to the limit of its practical capabilities.  My suggestion<br>(for JI music) is to use differing systems of notation for score and parts,<br>in which Sims or similar diacriticals are used to approximate pitch (with<br>the rest tuned by ear) for easy sight-reading, and Johnston or something<br>similar is for the score.  Of course, Johnston notation, as with all<br>notational systems, should be in a constant state of evolution, and I hope<br>that discourse such as this will include proposition of better ways to<br>notate pitches which are far from home on the lattice.<br><br><br>_________________<br>Adam B.
