Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/1998 11:10:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>(a) I wish to go beyond basic (level 1) consistency because it is<br>>possible for an ET to be level 1 consistent and still err from a given<br>>just ratio by nearly half the stepsize of the ET.  An extreme example:<br>>18TET is consistent to the 7-limit, but its 11-step "fifth" is only<br>>barely better as an approximation to the 3/2 than its 10-step interval.<br>>One is over 31 cents high, the other more than 35 cents low; the<br>>difference between the two errors is less than four cents! <br><br>That's a good reason, but it would seem highly unlikely that the most<br>appropriate consistency level for this purpose would turn out to be an<br>integer, unless you had particular composite ratios in mind that you<br>care about representing consistently. It was the ratios of large<br>composite numbers I was objecting to, since treating them more carefully<br>than ratios of numbers with larger prime factors, even if the latter<br>numbers are smaller than the former ones, is something that those who<br>believe in prime characteristics will advocate, but I find no<br>justification for.</div>
