How do we find out the answer to this most ultimate of<br>musical questions...and if, as Danielou suggests, the tempered scale<br>is out of harmony with the natural laws of musical pitch organization<br>(which, of course, we definitely know it is), what is the cumulative<br>spiritual effect of all these out of jharmony (as opposed to out of<br>tune) intervals? I am beginning to realize that this is perhaps the<br>most important issue facing musicians in the world today.<br>I believe we are in a most crucial time in the history of this planet,<br>and the decisions we make now will have a great impact on future<br>evenys...I also believe artists have a lot more power than we are<br>seeing, for the most part...at least we have the ability to be using<br>our gifts for more creative ends than most music I currently hear.<br>So, Kami's question is most appropriate, and one which we tuning folks<br>have the resources to begin to grapple with...I plan on taking my<br>music as far as possible, so this means really looking for the true<br>meaning and purpose of music...by studying the harmonic clues left<br>to us by the Creator, I believe a great and powerful music can arise,<br>one with the ability to heal and make positive waves in the very<br>structure of the Universe...which sruti, eh?

For beginners, I like David Reck's PhD<br>dissertation, _A Musician's Toolkit_ which is unfortunately only available<br>from University Microfilms. Likewise, the dissertations of Jon Higgins (on<br>the music for Bharata Natyam), T. Viswanathan (on Raga Alapana), and K.S.<br>Subramanian (on a single vina tradition).<br><br>In any case, I would listen to a lot of music before beginning a survey of<br>the theoretical literature. There is simply too much irrelevant and/or<br>inaccurate material in the literature that only an active encounter with<br>the performed music can help sort out. Even better is to find a teacher -<br>either Hindustani or Karnatic - to give you a grounding in raga and tala. I<br>heartily recommend vocal lessons in combination with rhythmic training<br>(e.g. South Indian Solkattu).<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 25 Mar 1997 01:25 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14082; Tue, 25 Mar 1997 01:25:00 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14064<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id QAA09304; Mon, 24 Mar 1997 16:23:29 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 24 Mar 1997 16:23:29 -0800<br>Message-Id: <19970325002315.13191.qmail@autarch.acsu.buffalo.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5212 href="#5212">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>3/27/1997 9:52:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>There are plenty of web pages about Indian classical music and this one <br>I was looking at just now:<br>http://www.aoe.vt.edu/~boppe/MUSIC/music.html<br>It contains a good annotated bibliography and a set of primers. <br><br>I can recommend the cheap three cassette set Music Appreciation of the<br>New Delhi label Music Today as an introduction, if you can find it.<br>The basic notions are explained and mixed with musical examples.<br><br>This is a long list of links:<br>http://webhead.com/WWWVL/India/india214.html<br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 27 Mar 1997 19:44 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA19707; Thu, 27 Mar 1997 19:44:42 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA19701<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id KAA27121; Thu, 27 Mar 1997 10:43:14 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 27 Mar 1997 10:43:14 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B1E6EFB0228C6.8F44@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
