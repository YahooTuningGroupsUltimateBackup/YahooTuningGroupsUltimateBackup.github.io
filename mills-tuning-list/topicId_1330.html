Right now the software is available for<br>Windows only   -a Mac version (which they say will have more bells and whistles<br>) is on the way.  They say they have convinced Kurzweil to upgrade theie OS so<br>that notes can be retuned as they are being played- but other manufacturers<br>are not so easily convinced (and why are we not surprized!!!).

(Similar pairs of X-ads<br>from the diamond can be very interesting, Partch liked to contrast 8/7<br>Otonality with 7/4 Utonality (The Letter, and in Oedipus) as well as 16/11<br>O and 11/8 U. And of course the pair 1/1 O and 1/1 U makes an authentic<br>cadence - which HP also used: The Hell With It, I'm Going To Walk!)). Cross<br>sets can be made by multiplying any set of numbers by any other set of<br>numbers, and Partchian cross sets multiply a set (e.g. (1,3,5,7,9,11)  by<br>its inversion (/1,/3,/5,/7,/9,/11).
