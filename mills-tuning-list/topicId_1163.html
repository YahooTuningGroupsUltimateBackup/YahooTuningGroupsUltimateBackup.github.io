When you set up a web page, be sure to cross-index by as large a variety of<br>    keywords as possible.  <br>2.  When you do keyword searches, use a lot of related words.  In this case, <br>    stopping with "microtonality" alone, the fact that he didn't find much <br>    doesn't particularly surprise me.  He should use words like "microtone",<br>    "microtonal", "meantone", "quartertone", "comma", "Partch", "intonation", <br>    "tuning", "scale", "scales", "cent" (that of course will net a lot more <br>    spam than fish), and such words.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 14 Nov 1996 16:16 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07530; Thu, 14 Nov 1996 16:17:27 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08720<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id HAA04854; Thu, 14 Nov 1996 07:17:24 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 14 Nov 1996 07:17:24 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961114150100_71670.2576_HHB71-13@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
