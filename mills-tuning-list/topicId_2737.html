I am indeed serious. Of<br>course anyone can distinguish between tones as little as 5-10 cents<br>apart in successive hearings. But if one substitutes one such tone for<br>the other in a given melody, not one person in a thousand will identify<br>that _melody_ as different. This is what I mean. I can make myself no<br>plainer. I grant that melodies wherein one substitutes one of the<br>degrees of the 22-tone or 24-tone equal for an adjacent degree, do<br>occasionally (not usually) produce a change in melody if one of the<br>degrees is highly consonant. Adjacent degrees of the 31- and 34-tone<br>equal _never_ produce such a change in melody to my ears. Naturally<br>there may be exceptional individuals with more acute powers of<br>discrimination, though I doubt it. But music is written for the many,<br>not the few.<br><br>55-60 cents as the limen of intervallic perception is well-established<br>in the literature. Pratt for example in his Meaning of Music, as I<br>recall, found a value "just wider than a quarter-tone", and Seashore &<br>Jenner found a value between 53 and 61 cents.<br>Naturally no one should accept these results without making trial for<br>himself. I find however that my own ears are fully in agreement with<br>these results.<br><br>There is nowadays a disposition to be suspicious of anyone who ventures<br>to condemn _any_ system of tuning. The presumption seems to be that<br>everything is good for something. The advocates of the 12-tone equal<br>have often been willing to use any argument to defend their chosen<br>system (e.g. the egregious Barbour, who ventured to write a book on<br>tuning, having never heard any tuning system other than the 12-tone<br>equal) and this perhaps, by a kind of reaction in favor of<br>experimentation, has induced many to doubt that any standard tuning<br>system should exist. This is emphatically not the attitude of the great<br>artists of the past, whose work depends as much on calculated limits as<br>on absolute freedoom. Nor was this the attitude of musical theorists of<br>the past, who tended rather to automatically dismiss all tunings that<br>did not conform to quite specific and demanding requirements. And I am<br>far from certain that their attitude was merely benighted. A temperament<br>which results in continual whining dissonances in place of consonances<br>may interest a few, but will never displace the 12-tone equal, nor<br>should it. Music which innovates too radically is somewhat in the case<br>of poetry which should adopt so many new words that the sense is<br>obscured.<br><br>I have observed that rock singers use a great many third tones; there is<br>seldom a popular melody nowadays without them. This perhaps is what<br>makes rock melody so much more pleasing to the masses than the 12-tone<br>melodies of the last century, which are now almost wholly disregarded. I<br>suspect that if 12-tone equal is ever dethroned, it will be by rock<br>instrumentalists wishing to reproduce the subtler, necessarily 19-tone<br>melodies of their vocalists.<br><br>All tuning systems which are not mere noise, reduce approximately either<br>to the 12-tone or the 19-tone equal, melodically considered. This<br>follows inescapably from the principle of the melodic limen. 31-tone<br>equal for example reduces melodically to the 12-tone equal (with a few<br>exceptions where the augmented tone occurs, where it has rather a flavor<br>of the 19-equal), because the adjacent degrees of the 31-tone equal are<br>confounded in melody. 17- and 22-tone equal do possess a certain melodic<br>independance, but are so seething with sour dissonances that they are<br>really not worth discussing.<br><br>I have used tree diagrams to examine all the possible heptatonic modes<br>of the 19-tone equal that have a modicum of consonant intervals and<br>chords, hence the four new modal genera, which I have previously<br>suggested might profitably be added to the diatonic. In harmony these 28<br>new modes constitute what may be called the chromatic music, whose<br>existence has been hitherto intuited, but never plainly defined.<br><br>It is fascinating that Francisco Salinas in the 16th century in his De<br>Musica observed that the 1/3 comma mesotonic (virtually equivalent to<br>the 19-tone equal) would alone permit the realization of the enharmonic<br>genus of the ancients. This is indeed the case, of which more<br>later.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Subject:  lutes again<br>PostedDate:  09-12-97 03:17:08<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  09-12-97 03:15:21-09-12-97 03:15:22,09-12-97 03:15:09-09-12-97 03:15:10<br>DeliveredDate:  09-12-97 03:15:10<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256568.000C6010; Tue, 9 Dec 1997 03:15:10 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10202; Tue, 9 Dec 1997 03:17:08 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 9 Dec 1997 03:17:08 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10198<br>Received: (qmail 9133 invoked from network); 8 Dec 1997 18:17:06 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 8 Dec 1997 18:17:06 -0800<br>Message-Id: <348CB3A9.6D90@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6628 href="#6628">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>12/14/1997 6:10:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Ed's comments on moveable fret lutes were interesting...I must admit<br>>that I was thinking of the hard fretted variety.
