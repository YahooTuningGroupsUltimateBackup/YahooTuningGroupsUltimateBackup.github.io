Strum a chord, and hold the guitar<br>next to the amp.  A positive feedback loop will be set up<br>between the pickups, strings and amp.  As electric guitars aren't<br>designed to have resonatins sound boards, it's a fair bet the<br>sound is traveling through the air and into the strings.  Of<br>course, you have to have the amp fairly loud, and hold the<br>guitar pretty close.  It also works with a bass guitar, which is<br>acoustically unviable.<br><br>Come on, you all already knew this, didn't you?<br><br>About inharmonic timbres: does anyone have data on the<br>inhamonicity of a human singing voice?  In as far as music is a<br>natural human behaviour, it's about singing and dancing.<br><br>Now, I've finished a MIDI file parser that does most of the things<br>that Brian McLaren asked for in TD906.  I have lost a few digests<br>since, so I can't be sure someone hasn't done it already, but<br>mine can handle pitch bends as well, so there!  I'll ftp it to<br>the site associated with this list once I've written some<br>documenation and tested it.<br><br>                      Graham<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 2 Mar 1997 00:26 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01725; Sun, 2 Mar 1997 00:26:02 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01717<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id PAA27482; Sat, 1 Mar 1997 15:24:17 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 1 Mar 1997 15:24:17 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3332b824.109912318@kcbbs.gen.nz><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4963 href="#4963">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>3/3/1997 12:43:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com><br><br>>Even if<br>>the figure were to have originated in a just or meantone environment<br>>(approximating /6:/5:/4) - and its obiquity in the lute repertoire speaks<br>>against this - the adoption into other tuning systems would have meant that<br>>the figure was frequently heard without the psychoacoustic effect that you<br>>claim.<br><br>The psychoacoustic effect I claim? Do I sense another deliberate <br>misunderstanding? What I claimed was that the minor triad was not considered <br>stable enough to serve as a final chord until its tuning became standardized <br>near 16:19:24. The major triad is still more stable in any tuning, so the <br>picardy third is appropriate in any tuning. My claim is that ending a <br>_tonal_ piece of music with a long, sustained minor tonic chord did not <br>become a convincing compositional gesture until composers heard 16:19:24 <br>minor triads. Note that a Pythagorean minor triad is just as good as a <br>12-equal one for approximating 16:19:24, so there is no need to enter the <br>debate about well-temperament vs. equal temperament.<br><br>>the figure ['s] archaicizing<br>>quality was already well established in the late meantone repertoire (hence<br>>Rousseau's label identifying the figure with gothic Picardie).<br><br>Well, if the historical evidence proves me wrong, so be it, but my ears tell <br>me quite clearly which note is the root of a 19:16 interval, while a 6:5 <br>interval has a different effect. Minor tonics tuned to just 10:12:15 or <br>meantone just don't work for me, while ET or Pythagorean minor tonics work <br>fine.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 21:53 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03289; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 21:53:39 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03300<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id MAA15784; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 12:50:06 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 3 Mar 1997 12:50:06 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B0BA3FA068AFB.5883@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
