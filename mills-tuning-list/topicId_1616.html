I played 12 tone reggae, <br>country, and jazz on the gig, but also did a 34/oct acoustic guitar/tamboura duet for my <br>feature, and it seemed to go over just fine. Also, sitting around warming up before the <br>set, got several interesting comments about the guitar, one being that it made the guy <br>feel relaxed, the very sound of the notes, and I understand because 34 IS relaxed <br>because many of the intervals, esp the 3rds, are very close to pure intervals.<br><br>Point being, we are still making "microtonal music" a PART of the overall music <br>landscape in Denver, playing it, talking about it with a wide range of folks, and being <br>on the scene, so to speak...as always, a lot of people seem really intrigued by the <br>whole concept...also, one student pulled the frets off his guitar to begin learning the <br>pure intervals, and another is beginning to study well temperaments etc. It is little, <br>everyday things like that that encourage me. Also Larry Hanson, God bless em, is <br>financing the building of a 34 tone acoustic bass guitar...we will soon be able to do <br>combo stuff in 34...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 3 Feb 1997 18:41 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA23611; Mon, 3 Feb 1997 18:41:45 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA23631<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id JAA04647; Mon, 3 Feb 1997 09:39:43 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 3 Feb 1997 09:39:43 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3.0.32.19970203092234.00696718@adnc.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
