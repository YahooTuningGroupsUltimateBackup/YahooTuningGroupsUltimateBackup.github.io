There seems to be some inconsistency in your usage<br>of the word "limit". You appear to define the word thus:<br><br>>In describing just intonation systems, it is common to refer to the<br>>most complex prime number used in generating the intervals of a given<br>>system as its "n-limit."<br><br>But then you speak of a non-prime, 9, as a limit:<br><br>>Since the time of Debussy, more complex sonorities have been accepted<br>>as stable: for example, tetrads such as the "added sixth" (12:15:18:20<br>>in one possible 5-limit tuning) and "minor seventh" (12:14:18:21 in a<br>>9-limit tuning).<br><br>The prime limit of the first chord is indeed 5, but that of the latter,<br>7. However, as some of us have discussed before, there can be two<br>equally useful concepts, an odd limit (closer to Partch's usage and<br>useful for describing sonorities) and a prime limit (useful for<br>describing resources of JI systems). The chords 12:15:18:20 and<br>12:14:18:21 are what I call the two "saturated 9-limit tetrads," since<br>all the intervals in each chord are ratios of 9 or less, and no notes<br>can be added to either chord without increasing the odd limit, and there<br>are no other chords with these properties. (Incidentally, both chords<br>can be called minor seventh chords, as the first is octave-equivalent to<br>10:12:15:18.) This type of chord seems to have been missed by Partch,<br>who may not have realized that utonalities and otonalities are not the<br>only possible saturated chords for odd limits 9 and up. So perhaps you<br>were thinking of the odd limit of the second chord, and the prime limit<br>of the first chord?<br><br>But then you go on to say,<br><br>>Similarly, in Gothic style, a combination of three superimposed thirds<br>>(e.g. e-g-b-d') may resolve to a stable 3-limit sonority (e.g. f-c');<br>>in triadic harmony, it may resolve to a 5-limit sonority; in 7-limit<br>>harmony, it may serve as a stable tetrad.<br><br>Now any chord that could be notated as e-g-b-d' cannot be a stable<br>tetrad if the odd limit is 7, so you must be back to the prime limit<br>definition and thinking of 12:14:18:21, or you should have said 9<br>instead of 7, in which case you could have meant either 12:14:18:21 or<br>10:12:15:18.<br><br>On another point, you wrote,<br><br>>The striking "neo-late-Gothic" feature of 22-tet is its drastically<br>>contrasting versions of intervals I will here call in traditional<br>>fashion thirds and sixths, although Erlich's decatonic nomenclature is<br>>well worth studying and may give a better insight into the scale's<br>>structure<br><br>When discussing neo-late-Gothic applications of the tuning, there is no<br>need to consider the decatonic nomenclature; it is quite irrelevant. The<br>conventional (heptatonic) nomenclature predates any kind of equal<br>temperament and is not "derived from" or "most natural for" any ET; on<br>the contrary ETs (12, 19, 31) were developed to conveniently quantize<br>the ideas of composers using this nomenclature. Similarly, there has to<br>be a decatonic corpus (opus?) before that nomenclature can be useful; in<br>no way does 22-tET alone suggest or require it. It is true that I found<br>the decatonic scales in 22-tET, and 22-tET is very nearly the best<br>tuning for them. But as you demponstrate, the "Xeno-Gothic" paradigm can<br>suggest 22-tET just as strongly as the "hyper-diatonic" paradigm that<br>spawned the decatonic scales, and for the former case, some form of<br>Pythagorean notation is clearly more appropriate.<br><br>An easy way to get a feel for these and other possibilities on almost<br>any retunable synth is to use a 12-out-of-22 tuning where E-F and B-C<br>are 1/22 oct intervals and all the rest are 2/22 oct. Then:<br><br>1) The white keys are a "Pythagorean" diatonic scale<br>2) The black keys are a "Pythagorean" pentatonic scale.<br>3) All thirds and sixths formed by two keys of the same color are<br>"regular" and approximate ratios of 7 or 9.<br>4) All thirds and sixths formed by two different-colored keys are<br>"schismatic" and approximate ratios of 5.<br>5) A major, A-flat major, C minor, and C-sharp minor give approximate<br>5-limit just intonation, in a fashion analogous to the late Gothic<br>keyboard tuning.<br>6) Decatonic scales as in my paper can be formed by omitting C and F, B<br>and F, or B and E.<br>7) The interval B-f approximates 11:8 with an error of 6 cents and<br>sounds good in the chord B-a-b-eb'-f, which approximates 4:7:8:10:11. It<br>is interesting to resolve this interval by contrary motion through the<br>very incisive 1/22 oct intervals to c-e. The latter interval is<br>approximates a 9:7 with an error of 1 cent and is therefore more stable<br>than B-f. 9:7 sounds like a traffic noise to most people unless supplied<br>with a context, such as D-Gb-A-c-e, which approximates 4:5:6:7:9.<br><br>-Paul</div><h3><a id=8416 href="#8416">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/1998 5:42:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Aline Surman wrote:<br><br>> I've been listening to a cassette version of the<br>> CD, and we have a unique project here, one which I believe will really<br>> impress a lot of folks...good job from all involved.<br><br>   Thanks for clarifying "unique" there!  :-)  (No just kidding...)<br><br>   Thanks for all the hard work, Neil!<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1518<br>*************************</div><h3><a id=8761 href="#8761">ðŸ”—</a>Neil Haverstick &#x3C;stick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/1998 7:55:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I got Genovese's $$$...I'll get them out early next week...anybody<br>know where Sethares is?
