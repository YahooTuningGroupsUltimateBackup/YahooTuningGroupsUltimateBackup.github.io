Hope<br>I'm in the ballpark, but it still got me to thinking about some ideas<br>I'm working with. First, my friend Richard Krantz came up with a bunch<br>of cool 11 note scales for 19 tone/eq, so I figured out the chords that<br>go with each degree of the scale...some are familiar, some are really<br>out there. It gives me many directions to go in 19, and of course can<br>lead into complex, bop type 19 tone pieces. In fact, I've rearranged<br>Coltrane's<br>masterpiece "Giant Steps" for 19 tone, and it is one tough tune to play.<br>I've also written several jazzy 19 tone pieces, and would be glad to<br>send a tape to anyone who's curious. I am also planning a piece (most<br>likely a long 'un) around the cycle of 3rds in 34/eq. If you start going<br>up by major 3rds in 34, you must go around a whole cycle of 34 different<br>notes before you come back to 1. Think of the vastness of the variations<br>contained in working out a chord progression on this movement. As always,<br>I'm more concerned with if I can create a piece with some deep meaning<br>than I am the tuning itself.<br>Also, Gary Morrison mentioned something about the chordal movement in<br>blues. Basically, and only very basically, blues starts with a structure<br>of 3 dominant 7th chords...in C, this is C7-F7-G7. Having all dominants<br>is a hoot, because there's never any real resolution to the tonic as in<br>"Western" rules where you get the restfullness of a Major 7th chord.<br>Believe me, I've been messing with blues for 30 years, and the variaitons<br>are truly staggering...there are many ways to alter and move this chord<br>progression around.<br>The scale is also fascinating because it gives you so little to grab onto,<br>and it can be added onto in many various ways. In C, the blues scale<br>would be: C-Eb-F-F#-G-Bb...this is already a trip because remember, we're<br>sort of "pitting" this weird ass scale against a dominant chord...the<br>C7th chord, of course, has an E natural for a 3rd, and a G nat. as the<br>5th. Yet, the scale has a FLAT 3rd and a FLAT 5th as well as the nat.5th.<br>And, if you write out the notes in all 3 dominant chords and compare them<br>to the scale, it really makes no logical sense as to how this scale can<br>"fit" these chords...yet, it does, and much more as well.<br>Ah, but the tough thing to swallow is this...the blues scale, as it is,<br>is only part of the deal. Many blues players routinely add the major 6th<br>and the major 3rd to their runs, as well as the 2nd (or 9th). Also, they<br>may actually start using different blues related scales as well, in other<br>words, when they switch chords they'll use the scale of THAT chord, so<br>the pot gets even thicker.<br>Then, there are so may styles of blues, from the Muddy Waters Delta voodoo<br>stuff, to the industrial strength punch of the Chicago schoo;, to the<br>big band changes of Count Basie blues, to the absolutely amazing changes<br>of Charley Parker and the boppers. To truly understand the blues is a life-<br>long pursuit, and I am convinced that the way to reach Joe Public with<br>microtones is through this music...blues was the fire of the whole 1960's<br>rock movement, and some truly lasting music was produced out of this<br>era. By using 19 and other tunings to alter "traditional" blues and<br>country truisms, a whole new music is appearing...it sounds familiar,<br>but is obviously something else than it was. The proof is simple...just<br>try and play some 19 tone blues changes, where the time is changing almost<br>every measure...it takes all of your favorite riffs and distorts them;<br>it is very difficult music to nail.<br>Enough for now...Hstick<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 9 Jul 1996 10:36 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id BAA08653; Tue, 9 Jul 1996 01:36:38 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 9 Jul 1996 01:36:38 -0700<br>Message-Id: <9607090836.AA02012@arthaud.saclay.cea.fr><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
