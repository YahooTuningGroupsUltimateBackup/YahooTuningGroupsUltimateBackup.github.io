        <a href="/mills-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Transcendental Numbers</h1><h3><a id=2248 href="#2248">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/1995 9:43:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>In beginning to read Brian's post about non-equal-tempered, non-just tunings,<br>I promptly realized that I was missing one very basic piece of information that<br>perhaps some others of you may also be wondering about:  <br><br>   What the bloody hell is a transcendental number?!  <br><br>   That sort of ignorance of course is difficult for a practicing engineer to<br>admit, so please forgive the sarcastic tone of this message.  It comes from<br>having to swallow my mathematical pride even after taking twenty-some-odd<br>heavily mathematical classes after Vector Calculus.  <br><br>   Those included a mysterious class called Automatic Control Theory, the<br>equations in whose textbook, I was once amused to notice, had more appeal as<br>abstract visual artforms than as mathematical statements.  Then again standards<br>of amusement drop to all-time lows when you average (including weekends) four<br>hours of sleep a night for an entire semester in a room located directly above<br>the central water heater for the entire dormitory complex!  <br><br>   Of course Brian makes a point - in belching out two printed pages of examples<br>of transcendental and nontranscendal numbers (each of which approximately halves<br>my estimate of my mathematical prowess) - to explain the concept ever so<br>concisely by pointing out that "there appears to be NO general criterion for<br>determining whether a number is transcendental".  Gee thanks Brian, that just<br>about sums it up for me!  <br><br>   So having accepted the embarrassing truth that I'm a complete mathematical<br>moron, I decided that maybe Grolier's CD-ROM encyclopedia might help out.  "A<br>transcendental number is an irrational number that is not a root of any<br>polynomial equation with integer coefficients."  <br><br>   Thank you, Grolier.  <br><br>   Maybe some other blithering idiot like me was wondering...  <br><br>   Fortunately, my mathematical ego having been deflated to about the size of a<br>white pepper corn, I have the gratification of realizing the significance of a<br>number being the root of a polynomial equation with integer coefficents.  If on<br>the other hand you don't, let me tell you a secret:  playing the guitar is more<br>fun!  <br><br>   End of sarcastic tone.
