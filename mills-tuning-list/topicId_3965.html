Schulter&#x22; &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/4/1998 7:41:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Hello, there, and I'd like to reply briefly to two questions of David<br>Finnamore about my example of one possible arrangement for his<br>"neo-medieval/Renaissance" tuning based on Pythagorean 9:8 whole-tones<br>and 256:243 semitones combined with semitones ingeniously dividing 9:8<br>into 21:20 and 15:14.<br><br>First, in my example, I followed the usual Gothic rule that small<br>semitones should be placed at diatonic locations, that is, where mi-fa<br>or fa-mi would be sung: e.g. a-bb, eb-d, f#-g, c#-d, g#-a. Here I take<br>the small 21:20 semitone as the counterpart of the usual limma<br>(256:243, which occurs at e-f and b-c'), and accordingly place it at<br>these locations. Note that "diatonic" semitones in this sense may be<br>defined by the rule that a flat tends to descend, and a sharp to<br>ascend.<br><br>Chromatic semitones (c-c#, eb-e, f-f#, g-g#, bb-b) get a large semitone of<br>15:14 (about 119.4 cents), a counterpart of the Pythagorean large semitone<br>or apotome (2187:2048). These semitones are located immediately below a<br>sharp or above a flat, and singing such semitones would go "against the<br>grain" from a usual medieval/Renaissance perspective. <br><br>This preference has both melodic and harmonic aspects somewhat<br>accentuated by this tuning. Melodically, the diatonic semitones of<br>21:20 (about 84.5 cents) are even more incisive than the usually keen<br>limma of about 90.2 cents. Harmonically, for example, major thirds and<br>sixths take on an even more active and "expansive" quality than in<br>classic Pythagorean tuning, making cadences where these intervals<br>expand to stable fifths and octaves yet more dynamic.<br><br>Thus if one shares the medieval preferences for small melodic<br>semitones and dynamic Gothic-style vertical cadences, and is<br>performing or composing in a usual medieval or "medievalesque" style<br>where c#-d or bb-a, for example, are much more likely to occur as<br>melodic intervals than c-c# or bb-b (often regarded as "unsingable" in<br>medieval and even Renaissance theory, although theorists as early as<br>Marchettus of Padua in 1318 approved of such "chromatic"<br>progressions), following the "small diatonic semitone" custom might be<br>an apt choice.<br><br>However, you are very right to emphasize that this _is_ a choice, and<br>that your scale permits many alternatives which might be just as usual<br>or more so, depending on the style.<br><br>For example, around 1400, it appears that there was a very popular<br>movement in favor of consistently dividing whole-tones so that the<br>small semitone would always be in the _lower_ part of the division. In<br>other words, from a Pythagorean perspective, all accidentals were<br>tuned as flats -- or, in your tuning, would have 21:20 below and<br>15:14 above. <br><br>As Mark Lindley has shown (see "Pythagorean Intonation" in the _New<br>Grove_ for a brief and informative summary), a major motivation for<br>this modification was a desire in the early 15th century to place<br>schisma thirds in prominent places -- that is, the almost pure thirds<br>(and sixths) which result when sharps are tuned as flats.<br><br>In your tuning, if we make a similar modification, we get major thirds<br>and sixths at locations like d-f# and e-c#' which are about 379 cents<br>and 877 cents respectively, if I calculate correctly. This narrow M3<br>is reminiscent of 1/3-comma meantone or 19-tet, but the m3 won't be<br>the same as in these tunings at such points, because the fifths remain<br>a pure 3:2, requiring an m3 of around 323 cents to fill the remaining<br>space. While not as close to pure as regular Pythagorean schisma<br>thirds and sixths, these intervals nevertheless will have a nice<br>contrast with their active Pythagorean counterparts (e.g. c-e, d-b)<br>and even more active counterparts involving flats (e.g. eb-g, bb-g').<br><br>One choice, of course, if you go in for a "quasi-Pythagorean"<br>arrangement of your scale, is to do what certain early 15th-century<br>theorists proposed: have 17 notes per octave, with ten accidentals<br>splitting the five whole-tones both ways (c#/db, eb/d#, f#/gb, g#/ab,<br>bb/a#). Where this is possible, it could give a performer or composer<br>great freedom to explore many potentials of your scale.<br><br>In conclusion, I should emphasize that these tunings are just a subset<br>of the possibilities for your scale.<br><br>Most respectfully,<br><br>Margo Schulter<br>mschulter@value.net<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1523<br>*************************</div>
