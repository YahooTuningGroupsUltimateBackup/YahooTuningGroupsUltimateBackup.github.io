If so,  is that not BORING?<br>><br>>It would be boring if that were the only goal and the usual 5-limit intervals<br>>were the only ones. But there are plenty of other goals. Read Blackwood on<br>>15TET, Goldsmith on 16TET, Yasser on 19TET, Balzano on 20TET, me on 22TET,<br>>Fokker on 31TET, Bohlen or Pierce on 8.202TET, plus many others I have not<br>>read, and I assure you you will not be bored! Musically, I find many of<br>>Blackwood's pieces very exciting, and Ives' to be sublime, to name two<br>>composers who used more than 12TET.<br>><br>>While theorists for hundreds of years have recognized that tunings such as<br>>19TET, 31TET, 43TET, and 55TET would lend more purity to the harmonies of the<br>>diatonic scale, there are tunings such as 15TET, 22TET, 34TET, 41TET, and<br>>53TET (as well as JI) which do not conform to standard diatonic logic despite<br>>their excellent 5-limit approximations. Forcing oneself to work in such a<br>>tuning can lead one to discover ideas that were inaccessible to European<br>>composers.<br>><br>>As I have mentioned before, I discovered a 22-tone "well temperament" that I<br>>am quite proud of. Had I not studied 22TET, though, I never would have had<br>>the idea . . .<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Joseph Downing <jdowning@mailbox.syr.edu><br>Subject:  RE: TUNING digest 1254<br>PostedDate:  02-12-97 21:37:49<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  02-12-97 21:36:05-02-12-97 21:36:05,02-12-97 21:35:59-02-12-97 21:35:59<br>DeliveredDate:  02-12-97 21:35:59<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256561.00712980; Tue, 2 Dec 1997 21:36:02 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04545; Tue, 2 Dec 1997 21:37:49 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 2 Dec 1997 21:37:49 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04544<br>Received: (qmail 18192 invoked from network); 2 Dec 1997 12:34:05 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 2 Dec 1997 12:34:05 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95.971202151521.4297A-100000@rodan.syr.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
