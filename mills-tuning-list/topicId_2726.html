There are a few very interesting passages on the Arab use of<br>the 1/3 tone, which apparently they borrowed from the Greeks (like much<br>else).<br><br>If Mr Moniodis has some particular questions which seem to him<br>critical to his researches, perhaps I could comment on their<br>general sense. La Musique Arabe is of course a veritable treasure trove<br>of info on arab music, but in my opinion neither the<br>pythagorean intonation that dominated the older arab music, nor<br>the 24-tone equal temperament which has been prominent since the last<br>century, are of much interest.<br><br>I am pretty much exclusively interested in the 19-tone equal, on which I<br>have accumulated quite a bit of material. In my experience the human ear<br>cannot reliably distinguish intervals closer than those of the 19-tone<br>equal, so the endless debates about minute distinctions between musical<br>ratios, or about equal temperaments with more than 19 tones in the<br>octave,  seem to me rather beside the point. The 22-tone equal is at the<br>extreme limit of human auditory acuity in melody, but this is a<br>worthless temperament, for it is non-cyclic.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA><br>Subject:  WTC<br>PostedDate:  07-12-97 05:52:10<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  07-12-97 05:50:16-07-12-97 05:50:17,07-12-97 05:50:06-07-12-97 05:50:07<br>DeliveredDate:  07-12-97 05:50:07<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256566.001A927B; Sun, 7 Dec 1997 05:50:14 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08445; Sun, 7 Dec 1997 05:52:10 +0100<br>Date: Sun, 7 Dec 1997 05:52:10 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08438<br>Received: (qmail 11945 invoked from network); 6 Dec 1997 20:52:07 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 6 Dec 1997 20:52:07 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.96.971206234535.3225D-100000@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
