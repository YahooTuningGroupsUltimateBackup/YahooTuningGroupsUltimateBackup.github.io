I did not intend to <br>support serious censorship of a performance, but rather pose the <br>consideration that Partch's music must be gingerly presented, since it <br>treads the fine line between high art and folk art.  I am of the opinion <br>that it could (and must) be judged, therefore, with the high standards we <br>use to review a concert of any fine opera.<br><br>Most people cannot play piano, and their opinion of "Bitter Music" will <br>therefore be based on a recorded version.  This version should therefore <br>be only of the utmost passionate and skillful rendering.  Perhaps someone <br>should take this journal and make it into a grainy film, starring Tom <br>Waits as Harry, with the piano parts arranged for guitar, harmonium, and <br>viola.<br><br>As I said before, I am not a critic except in my own armchair, and I <br>probably should have kept this judgement between my dog and myself. <br>Although I stand by my opinion of the work's rendering, I apologize to <br>Warren for the unwarranted confrontation.  I appreciate his efforts to <br>get the work before more people, and hope that no hard feelings linger.<br><br>Adam<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 11 Mar 1996 05:36 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id UAA24078; Sun, 10 Mar 1996 20:35:20 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 10 Mar 1996 20:35:20 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199603110434.AA16684@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
