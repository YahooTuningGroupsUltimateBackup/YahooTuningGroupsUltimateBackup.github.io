What was<br>even neater was that, on the same show, were 2 tunes from the Mingus<br>tribute CD, Weird Nightmares, which features someone playing a<br>Chromelodeon...I believe a number of Partch instruments were used on<br>this CD. So, in this hour long show, almost 1/4 of it contained non 12<br>music...I think that's a good thing...Hstick</div>
