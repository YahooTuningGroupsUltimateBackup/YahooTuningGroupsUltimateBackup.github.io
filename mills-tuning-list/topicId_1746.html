The tubes are both hanging<br>and horizontal, with a special holder designed for groups of<br>six horitonzontal tubes.  I have about three octaves of these,<br>tuned in just intonation, with 75 tubes in the middle octave,<br>and a few less in the outer octaves.<br><br>If anybody wants to try a few tubes, contact Woodstock Percussion<br>in West Hurley <, New York.  I got my custom-made tubes through<br>Stacy Bowers, who is sometimes difficult to reach since the<br>company has become so large (I got mine in their early years<br>when they were a samllmall operatoion with just a few people).<br><br>Best,<br><br>Lydia<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 28 Feb 1997 02:01 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA32496; Fri, 28 Feb 1997 02:01:39 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA32366<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id QAA21310; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 16:59:11 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 27 Feb 1997 16:59:11 -0800<br>Message-Id: <33162DFA.1250@cavehill.dnet.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
