But just be forewarned that such<br>organizations have a history of failure because of the geographic problem.<br>Even these days, it's simply very difficult to form a sense of comradery<br>across abysses like the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.<br><br>   The other difficulty to overcome is that the majority of us are are<br>either amateur musicians who have to scrape for every minute they can in<br>musical pursuits, or are pros who have to spend the majority of their time<br>playing "normal" music to eek out a living.  We just don't have a lot of<br>time for such things.<br><br>   Also, here's another question to answer:  If indeed it is valuable to<br>create such an organization, would starting yet another new organization<br>cause yet more fragmentation?  That as opposed to ... "enhancing" (for lack<br>of a better word) ... an existing organization?  Stichting Huygens-Fokker,<br>for example, has been resolved in recent years to branch out from their<br>originally-31TET roots to deal with unusual tunings in general.  Would it<br>be more meaningful to have them handle it?<br><br>   Above all, I'm glad to see that the reaction has been mostly positive<br>toward such an idea.  That because, again historically speaking, such<br>organizations that are formed by 1-3 people have not fared well.  Most of<br>them either dissolve over a handful of years.  That or, like the JI Network<br>or Interval Foundation, become the blood, sweat, and tears of one or two<br>people, with a little bit of periodic effort from a handful of satellite<br>authors.<br><br>   If on the other hand, we can get something like 5 active local chapters,<br>perhaps in Los Angeles, San Diego, around Stichting Huygens-Fokker, Denver,<br>and New York, along with annual dues and a significant monthly publication,<br>then I'd give it a definite chance of even more than just survival.  But<br>less than that, I'd anticipate it being a really up-hill battle.</div>
