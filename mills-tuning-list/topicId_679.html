Going back to 12, the semitones sound like whole <br>tones for a little while.<br><br>Someone mentioned playing their office-mate some music in 19 several times <br>until they got used to it. Then 12 sounded wrong, until they got used to <br>that again. I found that once I had heard music (Bach, Blackwood) in 19, 12 <br>never sounded quite as good again. Although I use 12 all the time, the <br>triads have a certain tension, an element of restlessness, that 19 doesn't <br>have. 19 sounds more peaceful to me. Although it's a subtle difference, I <br>think much of the 12tet canon (Classical & Romantic, whatever composers may <br>be in favor at the moment) depends on that restlessness for its musical <br>effect. Although translating tonal music from one system to the other looks <br>feasible on paper, the emotional effect, if one can perceive it anew each <br>time, is often quite different in each tuning. May I venture a <br>counterfactual: if the great composers has 19tet to work with, they might <br>have come up with music of a quite different character.<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 29 Jul 1996 18:51 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA28353; Mon, 29 Jul 1996 09:51:40 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 29 Jul 1996 09:51:40 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960729094545.2817A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
