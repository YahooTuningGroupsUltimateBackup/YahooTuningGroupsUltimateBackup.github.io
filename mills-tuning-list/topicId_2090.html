The <br>distinction between n-limit JI, x-comma meantone, well-temperament, and <br>12TET is *totally irrelevant* to the definition of modes and scales!<br><br>Look at a music theory book and its description of musical resources.  Where <br>is there any discussion of pitch or tuning?  It just doesn't matter.  The <br>only thing that rules out applying JI or meantone is the circle of fifths <br>with its enharmonic equivalence of notes. <br><br>It also is not sufficient to define "pitch areas" for the notes.  There are <br>Renaissance motets in which, depending on one's interpretation of _musica <br>ficta_ rules, the range of pitches used for F overlaps that used for E <br>*within the same piece*.  This is not just due to comma shifts, but due to <br>_ficta_ inflections.<br><br><br><br>>2) A subset of pitches from that tuning system, or, put another way, a<br>>pattern of intervals. (In the European tradition this means the diatonic<br>>set.)<br><br>But the notes of the modes were not taken from a larger set.  They WERE all <br>the defined notes.  Others were *added* to the set as necessary for <br>polyphony.  They were initially considered as intonational inflections, only <br>later being accepted as separate notes in their own right as sharps and flats.<br><br>I agree with Daniel that modes and scales can only be defined in terms of <br>whole tones and "half" tones, as a pattern of approximate intervals.  I don't <br>think that those patterns can be described as pitches selected from a <br>predefined tuning system.<br><br><br><br>>Number of pitches in the tuning system/number of pitches in the<br>>subset/number of commonly used auxiliary tones.<br>><br>>[qualification snipped]<br>><br>>Thus traditional diatonic modes are:<br>><br>>12/7/0<br><br><br>In light of the above, the original modes would actually be:<br><br>7/7/0<br><br>Guido's system formally allowed for:<br><br>8/7/0<br><br>and the whole system with _musica ficta_ would be:<br><br>infinite/7/infinite<br><br>as there was no predefined set of available frequencies, and no upper limit <br>on available auxiliary (_ficta_) pitches.<br><br><br>Reducing this to 12 requires accepting enharmonic equivalence, closing the <br>circle of fifths.  That idea strikes me as one of the most pivotal notions in <br>the history of Western music, yet as far as I can tell, it grew gradually <br>over centuries and without much comment, only becoming fully accepted in the <br>18th century.  Only then could 12TET, long understood, be applied.  It was <br>far from being the foundation.<br><br>Gordon Collins<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 24 May 1997 06:40 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA09120; Sat, 24 May 1997 06:40:05 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 24 May 1997 06:40:05 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09119<br>Received: (qmail 17705 invoked from network); 24 May 1997 04:40:02 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 24 May 1997 04:40:02 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.95.970524003304.3339A-100000@sunspot.tiac.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
