I thought this might<br>be of interest.  (Is there anyone in the Twin Cities here?)  I know this is<br>last minute.  The concerts are this weekend already.  I'll just quote the<br>little notice in the City Pages:<br><br>"LOU HARRISON MINI-FEST...  Among his Asia-phile peers, he's less oddball<br>than Harry Partch and more pleasure-centered than John Cage or Henry<br>Cowell, and given the simple and unmistakable beauty of most of his work,<br>it's surprising he's not more well known.  But such is the dustiness of the<br>classical-music world that just now, as he prepares to celebrate his 80th<br>birthday next month, Harrison is finally getting some of the attention he's<br>long deserved.  This three-day program begins Saturday night with a concert<br>by pianist and 20th century music booster Michael Boriskin, including works<br>by Harrison and a tribute composed by the pianist.  On Sunday afternoon is<br>a collaboration by the Schubert Club Gamelan Ensemble and the Minnesota<br>Contemporary Ensemble on some of Harrison's extensive catalog of<br>gamelan-inspired works.  Monday brings the Kronos Quartet back to town for<br>a set that should include Harrison's gorgeous, medieval-flavored String<br>Quartet Set, which has been in the Kronos repertoire since early 80's,<br>along with the local premiere of the organic and romantic Ghost Opera by<br>Chinese composer Tan Dun, which the group recently recorded."<br><br>Saturday 4/12, 8 pm Walker Art Center<br>Sunday 4/13, 3 pm Walker Art Center<br>Monday 4/14, 8 pm Ted Mann Concert Hall<br><br>I don't have any more specific information on pieces being played.  But<br>when I ordered tickets for the Kronos show I asked about the program for<br>that night.  There was a long list rattled off to me which I didn't write<br>down and didn't recognize the names of any pieces -- except Partch's Two<br>Studies in Ancient Greek Scales.  Obviously the program is not all<br>Harrison.  In any case, I'm looking forward to it!<br><br>Kris Peck<br>kpeck@wavetech.net<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 12 Apr 1997 02:46 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03805; Sat, 12 Apr 1997 02:46:52 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03803<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id RAA15937; Fri, 11 Apr 1997 17:45:20 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 11 Apr 1997 17:45:20 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199704120034.RAA15207@ella.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
