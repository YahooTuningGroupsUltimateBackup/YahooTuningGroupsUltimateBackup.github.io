However, there are many other ways to notate, and some members<br>of the list have criticized my attempt in various ways. No one else has<br>come up with anything general, however, and you may find that some of the<br>tunings you are interested in work fine on the 5 lines. Many do. <br><br>Most of my published articles do not discuss notation of equal<br>temperaments beyond using the 3rd and 5th harmonics. Some day they will. <br>Others will guide you I am sure on this matter.<br><br>The last few months of this list have been full of discussions relating <br>to this.<br><br>Meanwhile, maybe you can tell the list which tunings interest you?<br><br>==========================      =================================<br>Dr. Paul Rapoport               e-mail:	rapoport@mcmaster.ca<br>SADM (Music)	                   tel: (+1) 905 529 7070, ext. 2 4217<br>McMaster University                fax: (+1) 905 527 6793<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 19 Oct 1996 22:20 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03623; Sat, 19 Oct 1996 22:21:58 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03597<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA25874; Sat, 19 Oct 1996 13:21:57 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 19 Oct 1996 13:21:57 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.961019130631.2655A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
