Certainly people can hear the harmonic partials of a complex tone <br><br>>> and infer melody and harmony from that, but they can also hear simple <br>tones<br>>> in "simple" pitch relationships and infer melody and harmony from this.<br><br>>Pardon me if I'm missing something here, but I was under the impression<br>>that small number ratios were precisely intervals found in the harmonic<br>>overtone series, ie. 8/5 being the relationship between the 8th and 5th<br>>harmonic of the series.  Perhaps I don't understand the terminology<br>>properly.<br><br>>Bruce Kanzelmeyer<br><br>Bruce, I don't think you're missing anything, you're exactly right. If our <br>brains are built to recognize harmonic series, it doesn't matter if the <br>fundamental or some octave-equivalent is present or not. For example, given <br>a set of pure tones forming a harmonic series but with the fundamental <br>missing, say, 300, 500, 600, and 700 Hz, what we hear is a single pitch at <br>100Hz. This is called fundamental tracking, and has nothing to do with <br>difference tones. Other psychoacoustical examples that would prove you <br>right, Bruce, are nonlinearities and partials forming critical band <br>roughness. In these cases, assuming you have instruments with reasonably <br>harmonic partials, you get the smoothest effects with intervals from <br>anywhere in the (lower) harmonic series, whether the fundamental is <br>represented or not. But the harmonic series remains a fine way of <br>understanding these phenomena.<br><br>The only case where fundamentals might take on special importance in<br>applying the harmonic series to music is when trying to put a chord in<br>"root position." It helps the stability of a chord if the fundamental<br>or octave equivalent thereof is in the bass part. This explains why,<br>in the days when minor triads were very close to 10:12:15, pieces in<br>minor keys tended to end on a mjor triad, 4:5:6, for stability.<br>However, once minor triads began to be tuned close to 16:19:24 (as in<br>equal temperament), the root of the became was an octave-equivalent of<br>the fundamental, so it was okay to end a piece on a root-position<br>minor triad. <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 14 Feb 1997 23:41 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06998; Fri, 14 Feb 1997 23:41:58 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06976<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id OAA08334; Fri, 14 Feb 1997 14:39:44 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 14 Feb 1997 14:39:44 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009AFE585F362755.2C5D@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
