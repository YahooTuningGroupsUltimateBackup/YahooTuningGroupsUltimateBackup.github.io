One could take a look<br>at the Amsterdam Catalog of Compositional Algorithms of Alcedo<br>Coenen at<br><br>http://mars.let.uva.nl/ACCA/ACCA.html<br><br>There's also a couple of secondary artifacts where folks who're<br>actually *teaching* at *academic* institutions work hard at<br>assembling collections of pointers on the subject as they strive<br>to brainwash, bamboozle, and otherwise indoctrinate the poor,<br>stupid sheep who are their students... :-) Until such time as<br>Brian sees fit to savage their work, you can peruse one such<br>example that I've sent students to at Stanford at<br><br>http://cmn19.stanford.edu/~tkunze/algobib.html<br><br>These two sources have, admittedly, not been vetted by the<br>bias-free (e.g., Brian) and may thus exercise a pernicious<br>effect on the unwary reader. I think they *do* suggest that<br>there are other approaches and that the discourse may be<br>more nuanced than Brian's jeremiad contra the lowly<br>daisy-chain may suggest.<br><br>I'll close with one bit of Brian Eno's recently published bit<br>of demystification, shoptalk, and vernacular insight "A<br>Year With Swollen Appendices" [Faber and Faber, 1996<br>ISBN 0-571-17995-9] for your edification. From<br>a note to Stewart Brand (31 August):<br><br>"A by-the-by: I've noticed that all these complex systems<br>generators (such as Life and Boids (the flocking one) and<br>"The Great Learning") have something in common - just 3<br>rules for each. And these 3 also seem to share a certain<br>similarity of relationship: one rule generates ideas, another<br>reduces, another maintains. I suppose it's obvious, really.<br>But perhaps it's not trivial to wonder if those three conditions<br>are all you need to specify in order to create a complex<br>system generator (and then to wonder how those are actually<br>expressed in complex systems we see around us)."<br><br>With regards,<br>Gregory<br><br><br><br><br>_<br>I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,<br>paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only<br>maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it.
