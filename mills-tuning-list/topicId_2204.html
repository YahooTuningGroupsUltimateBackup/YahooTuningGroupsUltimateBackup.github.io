As I understand it, using all octaves<br>>(like P. D. Q. Bach's Don Octave) would be 1-dimensional, Pythagorean scales<br>>(3-limit in practice) would be 2-dimensional, 5-limit would be 3-dimensional.<br><br>This is a correct exposition of my idea of n-D harmony.  I thought<br>of it before I knew anything about prime limits, and I suggest<br>the terminology be adopted to avoid confusion with odd limits.<br><br>I have a related idea of scale dimensionality: this is the number<br>of generative intervals for a scale.  An n-D scale can be<br>represented on an n-D rectangular lattice.  Just n-D harmony<br>requires an n-D scale.  Meantone temperaments are 2-D scales,<br>usually approximating 3- or 4-D harmony.  ETs are 1-D scales.<br>This is inconsistent with meantone temperaments being "linear"<br>temperaments.<br><br>The idea of scale dimensionality is closely linked to my matrix<br>representation.  A meantone scale can be written:<br><br>          H(k) H + (k2)p(k)<br>                     (k3)<br><br>Where H is the metric of 2-D harmonic space, H(k) is an approx-<br>imation to H in the tempered scale, k2 is the amount by which an<br>octave is sharpened, k3 is the amount by which a pefect 12th is<br>sharpened and p(k) is the comma as a proportion of which this<br>sharpening occurs.  Note that k2 and k3 form a vector.<br><br>1/4-comma meantone is: k2:0, k3/4, p(k)4 4 -1)H.<br><br>H(k) is a tempered Pythagorean scale.  To get a tone and a<br>semitone out of this:<br><br>                 (t) (-3  2)N(k)<br>                 (s)k  ( 8 -5)<br><br>The power of matrix representation is that a temperament can be<br>derived from the intervals you wish to remove.  However, that<br>gets a bit complicated so I won't illustrate it here.<br><br>                 Graham<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 6 Jul 1997 12:05 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03946; Sun, 6 Jul 1997 12:06:17 +0200<br>Date: Sun, 6 Jul 1997 12:06:17 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05621<br>Received: (qmail 6040 invoked from network); 6 Jul 1997 10:06:02 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 6 Jul 1997 10:06:02 -0000<br>Message-Id: <memo.183030@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
