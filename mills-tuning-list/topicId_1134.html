In chapter five of<br>this work, minor is derived from _undertones_, which are physically derived<br>by lengthening a string. I think this reference is useful to illustrate<br>that the essential ideas were _in the air_ at the time, and a<br>scholar-composer like Seeger, who was familar with the German scholarship<br>available during his years in Koeln as assistant conductor in the Opera<br>House, was a leeding intellectual figure in the bay area. Likewise, the<br>school of music at USC, which Partch attended for a while, had a real<br>German (and Riemannian) bias. It is interesting to note that the Swiss<br>speculative theorist Hans Kayser was only 10 years Partchï¿½s senior, and<br>their harmonic structures are quite similar in construction.<br><br>Daniel Wolf<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 18:29 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04384; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 18:30:43 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04365<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA13108; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 09:30:40 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 11 Nov 1996 09:30:40 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009AB386547CDDE0.198F@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
