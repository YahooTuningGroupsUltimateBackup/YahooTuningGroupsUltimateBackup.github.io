The question of what that<br>> resolution should be can be best answered on the basis of finding a large<br><br>> equal temperament in which the limit you want to work in is consistantly<br>> represented. <br>> <br>> Since many manufacturers will probably continue to specify tunings in<br>terms<br>> of deviations from 12tet pitch classes, it would probably be best to<br>lobby<br>> on the basis of two large equal temperaments, one chose entirely on the<br>> basis of prime consistancy and another on this basis, but limited to<br>those<br>> temperaments divisible by 12.<br><br>You made some valid points, but since the MIDI Tuning Standard is already<br>in divisions of 2^n, I think it would be a bad idea to promote some other<br>division.  I was more interested in the desired frequency resolution.  <br><br>John Loffink<br>jloffink@pdq.net</div>
