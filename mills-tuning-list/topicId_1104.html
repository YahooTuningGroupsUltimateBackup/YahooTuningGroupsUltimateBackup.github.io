I thought I'd briefly present<br>the project here to see if anyone had any comments (notably, to see if<br>anyone has done any similar work that I could learn from before I<br>start).<br><br>My idea is to render tonal keyboard music (on synthesizers) using<br>dynamic just intonation.  By dynamic just intonation, I mean intonation<br>that changes according to the key center of the piece.  At first I plan<br>to do this using MIDI files, but eventually the idea would be to have a<br>system with a score follower, allowing for dynamic just intonation in<br>live performance.<br><br>I would like to try to use the pitch bend technique of tuning, where<br>each channel is initially given a pitch bend and then all notes with<br>that offset from ET are played on that channel  (i.e. all C's on chan 1,<br>all C#'s on chan 2, etc.).  At least that is a scheme I remember someone<br>proposed somewhere.  This seems to me quite a general technique that<br>doesn't tie me to one machine.  Also, pitch bend messages sent during<br>dynamic retuning will not cause glitches whereas I'm not sure which (if<br>any) of the explicitly tunable synths out there can be retuned without<br>glitches, since this is usually conceived of as an editing, rather than<br>performance operation.  It is important to have a synth with good pitch<br>bend resolution (perhaps one that uses all 14 bits of pitch bend, if<br>such a thing exists).  Any suggestions?<br><br>A significant problem with the idea of dynamic just intonation is how to<br>deal with accidentals and/or transitional periods during modulation.  In<br>a way, I think this problem is where the "meat" of the matter lies, and<br>would probably be the crux of the investigation.<br><br>Any comments?  Attacks are especially appreciated :-)<br><br>Ben Denckla<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 5 Nov 1996 00:57 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00670; Tue, 5 Nov 1996 00:58:44 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00668<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id PAA05312; Mon, 4 Nov 1996 15:58:41 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 4 Nov 1996 15:58:41 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199611042357.SAA01999@freenet5.carleton.ca><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
