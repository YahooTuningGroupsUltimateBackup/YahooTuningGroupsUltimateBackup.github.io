Korg 05/RW - I use this mostly, 1200 cent resolution.<br><br>2. EMu Proteus Orchestral module - the resolution isn't as good<br>as the Korg, I don't even have it in the rack right now.<br><br>3. mid-'70's Gibson L-6S with a Roland synth pickup - I use<br>this for controlling the Korg. I've also been ear training<br>with Cakewalk, sine tones, a glass slide and an E-Bow. Handy<br>for open tunings too. Used with a pair of silver face early<br>'70's Fender Princetons.<br><br>4. There's a brand new fretless/nutless G&L S500 (read Strat) shipping<br>today from Manny's, NYC. It should show up here sometime in the next<br>few days. In a few weeks it will be fretted for 13 limit just<br>intonation (my own tuning). Let me know if anybody's interested<br>in getting in contact with Jon Catler at Mannys to get a frettless<br>guitar. I'll hook you up with his email address if you need it (It IS<br>on his Freenote records web page). Why use a krap guitar when you can<br>get a new fretless with a quality neck?<br><br><br>John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu> writes:<br><br>>All-<br>>	I have added the ressponses to my question of "what microtonal<br>>instruments do you play?" to my web page<br>>http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html<br>> under Microtonal Instruments.
