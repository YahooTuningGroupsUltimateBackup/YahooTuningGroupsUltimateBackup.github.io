I<br>>mostly write for small ensembles of orchestral instruments.<br><br>What sort of tunings? ET's or just?<br>What sort of technical restrictions do you run into with various<br>instruments (and their related performers)?<br>   For example - with unconventional woodwind fingerings, 1) are there<br>     problems writing more virtuosic material requiring them (I know<br>     from playing flute that some alternative fingerings can be pretty<br>     cumbersome) 2) are there problems acheiving precise intonation<br>     with them (since not all alt. fingerings are dead on)?<br>   If your music is just, 1) do performers grasp the concept pretty<br>     quickly and tune by ear, or do they need to think in terms of<br>     deviations from 12ET; 2) how high a prime limit do you use, and<br>what are any difficulties you have with higher primes; 3) how<br>     beat-free is the result in performance; 4) how much does tradi-<br>     tional expressivity (vibrato, etc.) intefere with pure tuning,<br>     or, conversely, how much can it be cautiously applied while<br>     leaving theoretical niceties audible?<br>I'm just curious with what your experiences have been performing your<br>music, positive or negative.<br>Thanks, Chris<br><br><br>______________________________________________________<br>Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  kpeck@wavetech.net<br>Subject:  theories<br>PostedDate:  31-07-97 01:37:12<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  31-07-97 16:42:19-31-07-97 16:42:25,31-07-97 16:41:10-31-07-97 16:41:11<br>DeliveredDate:  31-07-97 16:41:11<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564E5.00280427; Thu, 31 Jul 1997 09:17:06 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA25756; Thu, 31 Jul 1997 01:37:12 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 31 Jul 1997 01:37:12 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA24631<br>Received: (qmail 25670 invoked from network); 30 Jul 1997 23:36:28 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 30 Jul 1997 23:36:28 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199707302329.SAA03559@riptide.wavetech.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
