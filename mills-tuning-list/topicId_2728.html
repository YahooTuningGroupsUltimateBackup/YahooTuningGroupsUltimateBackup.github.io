Weiss...thus, was Bach<br>>in well temperament, and Weiss in eq?<br>> would it<br>>have been possible for Bach (and other keyboardists of that day) to >have<br>tuned to eq by ear, using the notes of the Lute?<br>   I would think it difficult. Try this,  from one guitar, tuned as well as<br>possible, tune another guitar by open string unison tuning, one string at a<br>time, and then see if the second guitar sounds as good as the first. Now<br>imagine trying to copy a temperament from a lute to a harpsichord.   I tried<br>this once, ( with two Martin D-18's,  the tuning didn't make it from one to<br>the other intact).<br>     It appears from Jorgensen that temperament transfer like this was<br>attempted, and was found to be a crude way of  temperament.  The differences<br>between wire and gut would have made the overtone alignment difficult, perhaps<br>that may have been a reason for the Lautenwerk? I dunno, maybe someone older<br>and smarter can answer this??<br>    I would think the lutist would have tuned to the keyboard tuning, but I<br>know little about lutes, other than they were among the first to benifit from<br>the Mersenne ratios and Napier's logarithms.  The moveable frets on them makes<br>me think they were multi-intonation capable, and I would assume a lutist of<br>the time would move one or two of them to match the ensemble of the moment.<br>But I don't know chestnuts from pecans about this........<br><br>>In a similar vein, were the  instru-mentalists of that time adept at<br>>switching between various systems? If<br>> a flutist, for example, played with a Lutenist, seems eq would be the<br>>system...but, would they be using well or meantone with others, such<br>>as keyboard players?<br>    Was there a ET flute in the 1700's?  I thought that was more of an early<br>to mid 1800's development.  Keyboard tuning was considered to suffer the<br>"imperfection of the instrument", and I would think it would determine the<br>keys that the other instruments would tune for.<br>    I can't claim expertise on other instruments history through this era, but<br>if we could get Maclaren back in here, I bet we would all hear a lot about<br>this.  Others??<br>Regards,<br>Ed Foote<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA><br>Subject:  useless temperaments<br>PostedDate:  08-12-97 00:19:27<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  08-12-97 00:17:35-08-12-97 00:17:36,08-12-97 00:17:25-08-12-97 00:17:25<br>DeliveredDate:  08-12-97 00:17:25<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256566.007FF23F; Mon, 8 Dec 1997 00:17:31 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA09000; Mon, 8 Dec 1997 00:19:27 +0100<br>Date: Mon, 8 Dec 1997 00:19:27 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08999<br>Received: (qmail 26378 invoked from network); 7 Dec 1997 15:19:23 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 7 Dec 1997 15:19:23 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.96.971207180455.29648B-100000@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
