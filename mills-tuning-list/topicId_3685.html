I will post it soon and open it up for comments.  I'm breaking<br>the wish list up into low, medium and high end, as some requests are too<br>specialized to be achieved on all instruments.<br><br>1)  Full keyboard scales are obviously preferable, except when you have<br>something like Justonic's Pitch Pallette that updates tunings in realtime<br>over MIDI.  Sending an entire keyboard table clogs up the MIDI data stream,<br>while an octave table does not.  This is the argument I have against the<br>stance that full keyboard scales are all that is necesary.  We've waited<br>centuries to get keyboard-based instruments that can modulate freely in just<br>intonation, why hamper it now by limited software definitions?  Until we get<br>a better protocol than MIDI I think a mix of keyboard and octave scales is<br>needed.<br>2)  I feel that 5 or 6 quickly accessible tunings are insufficient if you're<br>doing realtime modulation in just intonation.  I recommend at least 64<br>tables (defined globally and assigned per MIDI channel) for a medium priced<br>instrument.<br><br>John Loffink<br>jloffink@pdq.net<br><br>> From: Rick Sanford <76122.2237@compuserve.com><br>> <br>> Has there, in the past, ever been a "wish list"<br>> sent around collectively?  Things like pitch<br>> resolution, non-octave repeating scales, etc?<br>> <br>> The two pieces I find usually missing are:<br>> 1) Only 12 pitches to choose (then next octave<br>>         repeats)<br>> 2) Only ONE (or maybe 2, e.g. Yamaha) storable <br>> user scale, necessitating frequent trips to<br>> a librarian application to get a new tuning.<br>> <br>> Ideally, for me, one would have 5 or 6 tunings<br>> quickley accessible, then these would also<br>> be non octave-repeating. We could frame our request<br>> as coming from the WM school, no?<br>> <br>></div>
