Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/1998 3:03:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>>According to Goldstein, the precision with which frequency information is<br>>>transmitted to the brain's central pitch processor is between 0.6% and 1.2%<br>>>within a certain optimal frequency range. Goldstein, J. L. 1973. "An<br>>>optimum processor theory for the central formation of the pitch of complex<br>>>tones." J. Acoust. Soc. Amer. Vol. 54 p. 1499. The roughness component is<br>>>somewhat more permissive as to mistuning, but a 1% standard deviation would<br>>>cause the<br>>>accuracy to fall below 1/2 at around the point where benign beating begins<br>>>to gives way to the roughness effects of the critical band.<br><br>>..Just wondering what this means.  It deals with mistuning plus or minus<br>>0.3% - 0.6% of a dyad's logorithmic size?  No?  What then?  And what does<br>>it say can percieve about an interval so mistuned?<br><br>No, 0.6% means a frequency change of 0.6%. Basically Goldstein dealt<br>with the way complex tone pitch (virtual pitch) was inferred from sets<br>of pure tones which departed by various amounts from an exact harmonic<br>series. His experimental results were very well fit by a model with only<br>one parameter, sigma, which could vary from listener to listener.<br>Essentially the model states that the listener will interpret the set of<br>pure tones as a certain virtual pitch if the pure tones have an rms<br>deviation less than sigma from a harmonic series above that virtual<br>pitch. As the deviations are increased further, the ear shifts to a<br>different, lower virtual pitch, whose harmonics better fit the pure<br>>tones (this is a very rough description).</div><h3><a id=7914 href="#7914">ðŸ”—</a>Mark Nowitzky &#x3C;nowitzky@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/1998 11:07:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I improved the bottom of my web page entitled "'The' Dominant Seventh<br>Chord", thanks to feedback I've received; notably: <br><br>1)  Thanks to Graham Breed for the idea of showing both chords (and making<br>one red) instead of showing just the Gdom7 chord. <br>2)  Thanks to Joseph Monzo for suggesting I add a diagram for the<br>equal-tempered version.<br>3)  Thanks to Andrew Kaye for the "blind" test idea. <br><br>The web page is (still) located at<br><br>        http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint/dom7.htm<br><br>--Mark<br><br>P.S.:  What a way to spend Memorial Day weekend.
