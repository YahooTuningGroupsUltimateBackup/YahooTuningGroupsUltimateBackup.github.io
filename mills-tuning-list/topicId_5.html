In a very<br>careful, meticulous manner Rasch looks at many myths, fictions,<br>and misconceptions about temperament and Bach.  Some of his points (I'm<br>recalling from memory) include: there is no reason to associate Werckmeister <br>III with Bach (W. in fact had other temperaments, including ET); there is no<br>justification or rationale for the Barnes-Bach temperament (Barnes'<br>methodology is subjective, his sample too sample), that all the contemporary<br>statments about Bach's tuning practice (for stringed keyboards, of course)<br>suggest equal temperament.  Two quotes Ihave ready-to-hand: "equal temperament<br>was becoming the norm for tuning during the second half of the eighteenth<br>century" and"equal temperament has been described and discussed so often<br>in eighteenth-century writings as a practical system that it must have<br>played an important part in musical performance."  Earlier in the<br>essay rasch makes the point that prejudice against ET may be due to the<br>natural association of it with standard, 19th-century performance: the<br>desire to be authentic would seemingly required getting rid of ET along<br>with pianos, modern stringed instruments, etc.<br><br>tom mcgeary</div>
