This version runs on both older<br>and new Macs withor without QuickTime and QuickTime Musical Instruments.<br>HC 2.0 or above is essential, though, but System 6.07 is adequate.<br><br>The LATTICE routine factors ratios and plots those at the 31 prime <br>limit or lower on a N-dimensional Cartesian "perspective" plot <br>similar to that used by Erv Wilson. Ratios involving higher primes are <br>simply skipped, and notes differing by a single step in any dimension <br>are connected by lines. Clicking on either the node or a ratio in the <br>list of notes highlights both items.<br><br>I've customized my copy by patching in Steve Curtin's Fret Position<br>routine, whose button is easily added to the scale card background by <br>slightly rearranging the right hand side of the card without losing<br>any of the pre-existing functions. I placed the string length field to <br>the right of the Name field at the top of the card. In addition to <br>the Fret Position, I created another function by replacing the <br>indicated line in Steve's script with the statement below. This script <br>calculates the vibrating String Length instead of the fret or moveable<br>bridge position.<br><br>Replace the line "put ((line 1 of field i)-(line 2 of field i))/(line <br>1 of field i)  into ratio" by the statement "put (line 2 of field i)/<br>(line 1 of field i) into ratio" (omitting the quotes).<br><br>Two small buttons for FP and SL fit in a single line just below<br>the new LATTICE button. Linking these buttons to the HELP stack and<br>creating new cards for them is quite easy in HyperTalk by analogy<br>from existing cards and buttons. <br><br>I heartily recommend that any user of JiCalc get this version. It's<br>great fun and seeing the lattice makes it easy to spot errors, find<br>chords, etc.<br><br>I presented a revised version of my ICMC 97 tutorial with a new example <br>DAT compiled by Brian McLaren last night at the Sonic Arts Gallery in <br>San Diego. Though the audience was small, there were numerous questions<br>and due to the number and length of the musical examples, I decided to<br>present only the introduction and the JI parts. I'll probably do the<br>temperament sections later if there is sufficient interest.<br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 17 Dec 1996 22:14 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00698; Tue, 17 Dec 1996 22:16:27 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00696<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA21951; Tue, 17 Dec 1996 13:16:18 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 17 Dec 1996 13:16:18 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612172111.NAA21440@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4352 href="#4352">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;106232.3266@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/1996 1:07:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Pat Missin's example of harmonica tunings shows exactly where the<br>distinction between what is patentable and what is not might reasonably be.<br><br>An arrangement of _notes_ on the instrument is patentable for keyboard<br>instruments and for instruments where individual _notes_ are produced by<br>individual keys, switches, or blowholes (as in the harmonica).
