Rousseau's Temperament<br>47      Handel Well Temperament<br>56      D'Alembert Modified Meantone<br>58      Equal Beating D'Alembert Well Temperament<br>70      The Transposed Vallotti Well Temperament<br>76      The One Half syntonic Comma Temperament by Kirnberger ca 1771<br>83      William Hawkings Improved Modified Meantone Temperament of 1807<br>>My hope is to use these and I have come up with some figures using Owen<br>>Jorgensen's text.<br>>All suggestions welcome.<br><br>    Greetings,  <br>    As one who has been wearing out grindstones on my nose with this, I have a<br>suggestion.  Simplify !  The glazed-eye factor goes up dramatically when you<br>get more than two or three temperaments in the same place at the same time<br>with the noviate audience.  <br>    While these tunings are interesting, identifiable, and familiar to many<br>tuners and theorists, exposure to this much complicated variety is going to<br>submerge your listeners after two or three changes. I think it will set them<br>a-floundering in a sea of unfamiliar contrasts, wild-eyed and crying for Cmaj<br>to come take them home.............<br>    You may want to consider trying to illustrate Meantone, Well, and Equal<br>Temp. as a historical progression, and then concentrate on the subsets of each<br>as your audience grasps the concepts.  Opening with some shock value is good. <br>      The wolves of 1/4 comma are always a big hit with audiences, I open the<br>gates at my lectures by retuning two thirds in an octave.   Audiences listen<br>real hard  while I turn the pins down, and by the time I near Just, the place<br>is always real quiet.  At that moment, I let them hear two just 3rds, and then<br>the wolf.  This always gets a big laugh, which is a signal that some emotional<br>connection is taking place. There is no question that the unexpected<br>dissonance has an effect, and given the perishable nature of a listeners<br>attention, you want to create this emotional link between the audience and<br>tempering as quickly as possible. Once forged, you must take care not to go<br>too fast or it will break.  It is like catching 50 lb. fish with 6 lb. line.  <br>     After recognizing the wolf, and with everyone usually feeling astute,<br>acute, and <br>sensitized, you can delve into the graduations of tempering that was such an<br>art form of the well-tempered era. I really like the Prinz,(which is why we<br>used it on the temperament CD), as it has good contrast, and nobody gets hurt<br>worse than a comma. <br>   You will be doing well if you can get them to grasp the concept of unequal<br>tonality and actually hear it well enough to appreciate what it is doing to<br>the music. Owen has several lectures and the pieces to go with them. You may<br>want to write to him.<br>   Good luck,  I would be really interested in how it goes. <br>Regards, <br>Ed Foote</div>
