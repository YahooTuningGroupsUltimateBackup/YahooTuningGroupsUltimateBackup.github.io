There are<br>little marks under the syllables, indicating the pitch to be sung. I<br>thought it was fascinating; needless to say, the pitches would not be in<br>12 equal. Does anyone out there know more about this subject, and what<br>tuning they might be using? Obviously, this concept goes way back in<br>time, and doubtless has deep spiritual connections...I am curious.<br>    On a slightly different note, I chatted briefly with a virtuoso pipa<br>player, and she mentioned that Chinese pitches will vary from region to<br>region...this, of course, doesn't surprise me at all, but again, it's a<br>subject I'd like to know more about. It reminds me of blues players, who<br>vary the pitch of a bent note according to the mood they're in at the<br>time, and I suspect this is common practice among Indian and Arabic<br>musicians as well. Any folks know about Chinese tunings, and I mean pre<br>12 equal? Thanks...Hstick</div>
