Please bookmark  http://www.anaphoria.com/wilson.html take a<br>look and tell me if you can read it or if you have any comments or<br>suggestions. Those of you who have some of his work that you think<br>should be up, please let me know and the request will be passed on to<br>him. I do not have a printer so please don't ask me to relay messages to<br>Erv. I'm not sure exactly how much I can get up at a time, but when I<br>run out of room I plan to rotate files on a 3 month period but I will be<br>updating this daily for quite awhile. Space is one of the reason I am<br>attempting to keep these files small. I plan to make announcements<br>periodically as to additions.<br>    The Moment of Symmetry article represents the birth of this MOS idea<br>that has been taken up by others. Despite it very simple presentation, I<br>would like to warn the reader that the implications are far reaching,<br>especially the second-order MOS which more work could be done with. But<br>this and all my comments should be considered secondary to the work. The<br>idea is to let his work finally speak for itself.<br>--<br>Kraig Grady<br>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br>http://www.anaphoria.com</div><h3><a id=8608 href="#8608">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/1998 5:30:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> >   I guess I may as well ask:  What's your book about?<br>><br>> Wow -- guess I've been away from the List longer<br>> than I thought.<br><br>   (And of course people join and leave the list periodically...)</div>
