This is, in part, due to the fact that y'all have<br>been very generous with sending tapes [yo, Sethares - I'm still waiting....].<br><br>It turns out that a number of listeners seemed to want to hear some of the<br>stuff they *don't* have. This means that the big request is Partch's "Delusion<br>of the Fury" on Columbia, for example. A couple of listeners wanted to know<br>why I wasn't doing quarter tone pieces, too. SO - the first program is going<br>to be some kind of "traditional values" program; 20th century works by "the<br>old guys" (Blackwood, Partch, Darreg, Ives q-tone, Johnston,  early Riley, and a<br>bit of *really* rare LaMonte if I can dig it up, etc.). The next set will be the<br>"new guys" (that's *you* lot), and - I didn't exactly think of this - one<br>listener<br>wanted a program of non-western music (this is still on the drawing board)<br>for #3.<br>#3 might wind up being a bit of a mix, perhaps.<br><br>By virtue of dividing it this way, I can opt for more of the works you submitted<br>and not appear to be slighting Ivor for Carter Scholz, etc. Given the<br>season and some<br>other stuff, I think the shows will be spread out to one/month for the next<br>3 months,<br>with the first one being this Sunday.<br><br>I am *really* going to keep to my usual rules about not spending half the<br>evening<br>blathering on mike (the work is lots more interesting than my opinions of it. I<br>know that some of you may be surprised to learn that I'm the very sould of<br>brevity<br>on-mike), so I'll have to *really* encourage folks to call me if they've<br>got questions.<br><br>Thanks again to all of you for your work and for your advice. I think that<br>!12tET.2 is<br>going to be the third week in January (weeks one and two are traditionally<br>the long-form<br>"Best releases of 1996" program, where folks get to hear 15 or so minutes<br>of each disc<br>instead of a lousy soundbite. As a side note, "Music from the Isle of<br>Anaphoria" - which I<br>commend to your hearing - is on the short list this year).<br><br>With regards,<br>Gregory Taylor<br><br>_<br>When I pronounce the word Future,/the first syllable already belongs to the<br>past./When I pronounce the word Silence,/I destroy it./When I pronounce the<br>word Nothing,/I make something no nonbeing can hold./ (Wislawa Szymborska)<br>Gregory Taylor, Heurikon Corp.<br>http://www.msn.fullfeed.com/~gtaylor/home.html<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 18 Dec 1996 00:18 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00862; Wed, 18 Dec 1996 00:21:05 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00860<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id PAA26437; Tue, 17 Dec 1996 15:21:03 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 17 Dec 1996 15:21:03 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.95.961217175117.2533D-100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
