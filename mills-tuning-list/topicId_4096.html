With<br>C as tonic the notes would be:<br><br>C        Db        Eb      F     G        Ab        Bb    C<br>1/1    21/20    7/6    4/3    3/2    14/9    16/9<br>    or   16/15    6/5                        8/5      9/5<br>                        32/27                    13/8    7/4<br><br>I find the book difficult to read, suffice to say that Ayyar considered that<br>much more research should be done to work out what ratios are being used.<br><br>The artists I have heard in Chennai weren't that careful about intonation<br>and didn't consider such questions about specific ratios and srutis to be<br>important, but then their use of ears certainly didn't always place the<br>pitch in the same place during each raga.<br><br>I guess there must be a few that take exact pitch relations in ragas very<br>seriously.<br><br>michael Dixon<br>MandLDixon@bigpond.com<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1561<br>*************************</div>
