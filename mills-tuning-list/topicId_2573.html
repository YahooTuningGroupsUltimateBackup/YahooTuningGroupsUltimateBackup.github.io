You mentioned in your last<br>post that "once you shut off your ears, the whole effect disappears."<br>Yikes...check this out (from GUITAR)..."The Army and Navy have been<br>developing acoustic weaponry, wherin audio frequencies can be tuned to<br>lethal levels."   Later, it says a certain company   "has built a device<br>designed to make human internal organs resonate with results ranging<br>from a simple shudder to intense discomfort to death." Of course, this<br>may not be "music," per se, but it is sound, and music is sound, and<br>this devilish device obviously bypasses the ears to really reach folks<br>in a deep and profound way.<br>    I am not trying to be cute here at all...my concept of music is very<br>broad, and does not just include what we hear with the ears, or even what<br>exists on this planet...it is, needless to say, an awesome Universe,<br>and the potential fo what "music" is most likely goes way way beyond<br>our Earthly experiences. As well, yogis such as Paramahansa Yogananda<br>have taught methods of meditation that involve listening for internal<br>sounds that may very well bypass the mechanisms of the inner ear. Far<br>fetched? I don't think so...my inner hearing has changed drastically<br>over the last 20 years, and I know I hear things that are not part of<br>the "external" world. One's personal belief system certainly affects<br>the way they percieve art, or life in general. Again, my concept of<br>music is a part of my overall concept of life, and my life view is<br>that we humans are a teensy weensy part of an unbelieveble Creation,<br>with potentials beyond, perhaps, what we have traditionally been led<br>to consider. I enjoy these discussions, as they enrich my mind and<br>spirit...Hstick<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com><br>Subject:  Tell your friends<br>PostedDate:  26-10-97 01:44:57<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  26-10-97 01:43:59-26-10-97 01:43:59,26-10-97 00:44:36-26-10-97 00:44:37<br>DeliveredDate:  26-10-97 00:44:37<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125653C.000405D6; Sun, 26 Oct 1997 02:43:56 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA27239; Sun, 26 Oct 1997 02:44:57 +0200<br>Date: Sun, 26 Oct 1997 02:44:57 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA27580<br>Received: (qmail 17300 invoked from network); 25 Oct 1997 17:44:54 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 25 Oct 1997 17:44:54 -0700<br>Message-Id: <19971026004750828.AAA307@NIETZSCHE><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
