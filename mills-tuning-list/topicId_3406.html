Does anyone have any input on this question?'<br><br>I may be entirely wrong about this, but I think<br>that the generally heavier construction of the piano<br>(esp. the tuning block and frame) made the instrument<br>simply better able to hold a tuning over a longer<br>period of time and thus shifted the responsibility<br>for the tuning from the performer or instrument owner<br>to professional piano tuners. While most musicians<br>can learn to set a meantone or well temperament and<br>learn quickly to correct a tuning before and during<br>a rehearsal or performance, approximating an equal<br>temperament is a specialist activity and cannot be<br>done on the fly. Douglas Leedy speaks about<br>'invention being the mother of necessity' in this<br>case: because the piano was able to hold a tuning in<br>ET, it became necessary to tune it in ET.<br><br>There are arguments about ET and the piano based upon<br>the stretched intonation of the partials of the<br>rigid piano wire. I have great trouble in supporting<br>these arguments historically, however, because the<br>early pianos were wired at a much lower tension<br>than modern instruments and were considerably less<br>stretched. (La Monte Young's _Well Tuned Piano_ =<br><br>deliberately uses a lower tension to reduce, but not<br>eliminate the stretching. The actual tuning he uses<br>deviates considerably from just intonation when =<br><br>measured but is instead a subjectively convincing<br>approximation.)<br><br>Daniel Wolf<br>rankfurt  =</div><h3><a id=7779 href="#7779">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/13/1998 4:21:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Tue, 28 Apr 1998, it was written:<br>>                  I should dig out my program and run it a little ways<br>> past 1200, just to make sure there isn't some awesome ET out there that<br>> would get us a lot more accuracy/consistency for not too much more<br>> resolution.<br><br>I've now generated that table and it is available at<br><br>http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote/consist4.txt<br><br>It covers ETs from 1200 upt 2400.
