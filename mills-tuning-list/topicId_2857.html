The following is the output of a program that<br>> approaches that subject from the perspective of least common<br>> multiple.  As most of you must know by now, I favor this as a<br>> measure because it correlates with a physical property of the<br>> composite sound, i. e. the length of the pattern.  Also, the<br>> concept is independent of "limits" as in 5-limit, 7-limit, etc.<br><br>I vaguely recall something in Mersenne to this effect, back in the 17th<br>century; Euler used this principle also, I think, but maybe in a<br>different context. It certainly is one of the traditional methods of<br>evaluating consonance. It definitely has problems though, but perhaps<br>not insuperable problems. For example, 9:2 is certainly not consonant,<br>even though the product of its ratio members is less than that of 5:4<br>for example. But probably my comments are nothing new to you. I tried to<br>use this once, but could never reconcile my ears with the resulting<br>numbers. But there may be a way.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Subject:  personal insights<br>PostedDate:  20-12-97 09:56:08<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  20-12-97 09:54:00-20-12-97 09:54:01,20-12-97 09:53:35-20-12-97 09:53:36<br>DeliveredDate:  20-12-97 09:53:36<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256573.0030E1C3; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 09:55:51 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22539; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 09:56:08 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 20 Dec 1997 09:56:08 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22576<br>Received: (qmail 17481 invoked from network); 20 Dec 1997 00:56:05 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 20 Dec 1997 00:56:05 -0800<br>Message-Id: <349B90AB.2971@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
