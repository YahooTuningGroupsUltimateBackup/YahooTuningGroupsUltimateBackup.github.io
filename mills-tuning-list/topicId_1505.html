He has looked at <br>early Sanskrit texts and also tried to deal with the sruti concept <br>from various points of view within Just Intonation. He examines various <br>issues in content and structure, representing his results in diagrams and <br>lattices.<br><br>The problem is that I am no expert on Indian classical theory, nor do I <br>have the time to respond to his request for comments on what he's <br>written. I am therefore looking for anyone qualified on this list who might <br>have an hour to look at the material and send comments to its author.<br><br>To such a person I will send the papers. Please respond to me rather than <br>to the list. The author is not on the list, by the way.<br><br>Thanks in advance for any interest. I think reading the material will be <br>worthwhile.<br><br>     <br>Dr. Paul Rapoport               e-mail:	rapoport@mcmaster.ca<br>SADM (Music)	                   tel: (+1) 905 529 7070, ext. 2 4217<br>McMaster University                fax: (+1) 905 527 6793<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 6 Jan 1997 01:36 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02346; Mon, 6 Jan 1997 01:39:13 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02344<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id QAA28996; Sun, 5 Jan 1997 16:39:10 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 5 Jan 1997 16:39:10 -0800<br>Message-Id: <32D0491A.7B97@ix.netcom.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
