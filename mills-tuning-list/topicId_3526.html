For instance,<br>a frequency of 1/2 the sample rate will begin to repeat after two samples,<br>but a frequency of 1/3 the sample rate will repeat after three samples.<br>Is a sine tone at 1/3 the sample rate more dissonant than one at 1/2 the<br>sample rate?<br><br>A real DSP or information theory person could go into greater detail,<br>and actually my main disagreement was with posing an equivalence between<br>"noise" in a signal and "dissonance" of a signal. Dissonance is subjective,<br>and noise can be measured, via the amount of redundancy in the signal<br>(which is the compressability).<br><br>Bob Valentine</div>
