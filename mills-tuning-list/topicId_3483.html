The "simplified models", as Gary<br>> observed, seem to handle the vast majority of cases. Dave Hill did<br>find<br>> specific values for the inharmonicities, which I would ascribe to<br>> methodological errors, etc. But even if you don't believe me, and take<br>> Dave's values for the inharmonicities, they are clearly of a different<br>> order of magnitude (typically < 1 cent) than the departures of the<br>> series of resonant frequencies from a harmonic series (typically<br>dozens<br>> of cents). That's what I've been trying to say.<br><br>Hang on.  In TD 1392, Gary Morrison started the discussion with:<br><br>>   Another consideration that deserves some thought along these lines<br>is<br>> that very few acoustic instruments have their overtones within 1 cent<br>of<br>> exact harmonics.<br><br>Then you said<br><br>> Last time we had this discussion, we agreed (I thought) that bowed<br>> strings, winds, and brass instruments had exact integer harmonics for<br>as<br>> long as they sustain a consistent tone. That is a physical fact, true<br>of<br>> any system with a 1-component driver, which oscillates periodically<br>and<br><br>Firstly, I took "exact" to mean an integer to an infinite number of<br>decimal places.  "How can anyone assert such accuracy?"  I thought.<br>Also, the implication is obviously of far _higher_ accuracy than the <1<br>cent previously suggested.  I also queried how you could be so sure that<br>a reed or whatever is exactly a 1-component driver, but Gary made the<br>point for me.<br><br>You replied with a model for the operation of reeds/lips that assumed<br>laminar airflow, and concluded with:<br><br>> Hence the amplitude of<br>> the partials can vary, sometimes wildly, rendering the waveform<br>> aperiodic. However, for the time domains relevant for the ear's<br>> analysis, this does not lead to any relevant alterations in the<br>> frequencies of the partials.<br><br>So, you're presumably still with exact integer ratios.  Maybe, though,<br>you mean that pitch fluctuations place a lower limit on the pitch<br>precision that is meaningful, and that inharmonicity is below this<br>threshold.  It isn't clear.<br><br>I presumed, with all the uncertainties in the construction of the reed,<br>that resonance with the air column was the main factor governing<br>inharmonicity, and was corrected on that point.<br><br>If you're now saying that inharmonicities of a fraction of a cent are<br>not physically impossible, I'm happy to concur with that.  My guess<br>would be less than 0.1 cents, although I have no proof of that, and<br>would like some.  Hopefully, we can stop theorising and wait for some<br>more data.<br><br>This is interesting, though:<br><br>>>Any noise in the input will cause peaks at the resonant modes.<br><br>> They are not really "peaks" so much as "hills" since there are no<br>> constructively interfering standing waves to sharpen them. While the<br>> noise energy will be spread throughout the spectrum, the energy from<br>the<br>> driver (reed, lips, bow) will manifest in Dirac-delta-function-like<br>> peaks at harmonic overtones in the spectrum.<br><br>Why couldn't they be reinforced by standing waves?  If the noise<br>provides a constant impulse at all frequencies, that should lead to<br>peaks at the resonances like with a flute, maybe still corrected by an<br>order of magnitude towards harmonicity.  Whether this means two peaks<br>occur close together, or the original peak is shifted slightly, I don't<br>know.  Definitely smaller than the 0.1 cents for most instruments,<br>though, because of the low noise level.  Maybe not even the only source<br>of inharmonicity, but the easiest one to quantify.<br><br>I'm not deliberately causing trouble here, only I usually agree with you<br>and it distresses me when I don't.  Hopefully, this was just a problem<br>of expression, and we can put it all behind us, marching defiantly<br>towards a better future.<br><br><br>> Listen, Gary and I have been defining systematic inharmonicity as<br>cases<br>> where, after the noise is removed, the partials deviate from a<br>harmonic<br>> series. Since noise doesn't exhibit interference effects, the only<br>> inharmonicity relevant to JI is systematic inharmonicity.<br><br>I can't find this definition anywhere.  I was assuming "systematic"<br>meant the deviation from integers had to be constant from one cycle to<br>the next.<br><br>>>The resonances of flutes were also given relative to 12-equal.  They<br>were<br>>>up to 20 cents out!  It's only the flautist's skill that adjusts them<br>to<br>>>the desired scale.<br><br>>The standard fingerings take this into account, in case you didn't know<br>>that already. So, if knowing the standard fingerings is considered part<br>>of "skill", then you are right.<br><br>I can't go back and check now, but I think both cases were covered.<br>Harmonics played by the performer were out by less than however else<br>they were measured.  There is still a deviation with the usual<br>fingerings, though, of quite a few cents.  Enough to scupper the<br>difference between 12-equal and meantone.  Instrument manufacture may<br>have improved since then, of course.<br><br>The inharmonicity in the resonances is caused by the holes being there,<br>and there's some complex relationship between this and the holes<br>producing slightly the wrong pitches.  I didn't read it for long enough<br>to be sure. I usually ignore acoustic instruments, but thought I'd<br>better clue up for this discussion.</div>
