Is anybody on the list using U-tonality (equal <br>space fretting) for composition. I would be interested on hear something<br>more about it.<br><br>	Johnny said:<br>"Also, a list of listening materials that <br>correspond to each and every lesson might be adviseable.<br>Most important is the real time singing of intervals, perhaps a new <br>interval each and every lesson"<br><br>	I'm finding through Carnatic music that the only way to <br>distinguish the difference of the pitches (and ornamentation around <br>the tone) on the similar ragas, is to actually sing a traditional catchy <br>tune. Putting everything into numnbers made it really confussing. <br>So I agree with your point and would also like to ask you what vocal <br>(or choral) material can be use for beginners for the different groups <br>of tunings already classified by Paul through his 15 week tuning course <br>proposal:<br><br>>1. Introduce the octave as an acoustical phenomenon<br>>2. Introduce the 3-limit consonances and Pythagorean tunings<br>>3. Pythagorean tunings as applied to pentatonic scales: Chinese Music<br>>4. 7-ET representations of pentatonic scales allowing modulational freedom: <br>>Thai music<br>>5. Pythagorean tunings as applied to the heptatonic scale: Organum<br>>6. Discuss the pythagorean comma; introduce 12-ET representations of the <br>>heptatonic scale<br>>7. Non-just non-equal-tempered scales: African and much other music<br>>9. Schismatic tuning of late middle ages and medieval Arabic tuning as <br>>Pythagorean approximations to the 5-limit<br>>10. Just intonation: Indian music (I've heard some santoor music where the <br>>intonation is very clearly just 5-limit).<br>>11. Discuss the syntonic comma; introduce meantone temperament: Renaissance <br>>music<br>>12. Equal-tempered versions of meantone -- 31, 19, is 12 good enough?<br>>13. Circulating temperaments/well temperament: Bach and "key colors"<br>>14. 12-TET becomes standard :( , Arabic music measured and played in <br>>"quarter-tones"<br>>15. Equal tempered versions of just intonation: 53, 34, maybe compare <br>>22-equal with 22 sruti of Indian music to show how JI structures are <br>>preserved<br>>16. Atonality, set theory, Balzano and 20-TET and other numerological <br>>constructs.<br>>17. Introduce the 7-limit consonances<br>>18. Augmented sixth chords as meantone approximations to the 7-limit<br>>19. Introduce the 9- and 11-limit consonances in JI: Partch, Johnston, etc.<br>>20. Equal-tempered representations of higher consonances: Huygens, Fokker, <br>>and 31; Herf, Sims and 72, proposals of 41-tone and 171-tone equal <br>>temperaments<br>>21. Inharmonic timbres, tunings to go with them: Gamelan music, modern <br>>explorations<br>>22. Non-octave scales in history and modern non-octave tunings such as <br>>Pierce's 13 per 3:1<br>>23-30. Creative ensemble projects<br> <br>This is also for anybody else who could suggest any other vocal works connected<br>to<br>any tuning different than the 12 Tet !!!!!<br><br>	I have translated into english the index of a book which is used <br>by the Spanish Conservatoir as reference for the subject of acoustics :<br>"Afinacion y temperamento en la musica Occidental". This is also a good<br>classification of tunings (Only western I'm afraid):<br>***********************************************************************<br><br>TUNING AND TEMPERAMENT IN WESTERN MUSIC<br><br>1.
