Of course, I have a feeling that it<br>was abandoned more because the clavier builders didn't want to mess with<br>the mechanics of building such an axe, the economics. I am sure that a<br>lot of the musicians would have liked to have these instruments. As<br>usual, in the European system, the bucks won out. That's why I respect<br>the people who build/play original instruments in other tunings; then,<br>we've got something to play on, to try out our theories with real<br>sounds...Hstick<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Re: repeating patterns<br>PostedDate:  15-12-97 10:59:37<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  15-12-97 10:57:40-15-12-97 10:57:41,15-12-97 10:57:21-15-12-97 10:57:22<br>DeliveredDate:  15-12-97 10:57:22<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656E.0036B400; Mon, 15 Dec 1997 10:59:26 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA15657; Mon, 15 Dec 1997 10:59:37 +0100<br>Date: Mon, 15 Dec 1997 10:59:37 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA15656<br>Received: (qmail 24141 invoked from network); 15 Dec 1997 01:59:33 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 15 Dec 1997 01:59:33 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541105b0b9fcd6b13a@[207.207.2.115]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
