I worked out my ideas, including the<br>basics of interval matrices, before I joined the tuning list and so<br>before I realised there were other people interested in the same<br>stuff as me.  Naturally, I worked out my own terminology to explain<br>things to myself.  I'm trying to explain myself using the standard<br>terms where possible, but it isn't easy because most of them don't<br>even seem to have precise meanings, and some of my concepts also<br>appear to be original.<br><br>> The last message in particular was<br>> very obscure. Can you try doing some hand-holding for us and explain<br>> what you mean by "this works," "that doesn't work," a "0-comma scale,"<br>> and "this temperament"?<br><br>Okay.  By "this works" I meant that a 2-D scale could be<br>constructed such that every 5-limit interval can be defined on<br>that scale.  I originally added the condition that a basis should<br>be a tempered 2-3 plane.<br><br>A 0-comma scale is a tempered scale with a just octave and another<br>just interval, usually a perfect fifth.<br><br>"This temperament" is the doubly positive temperament that Paul<br>Erlich worked out.  I think this can be called doubly positive<br>temperament, as it covers all the ETs usually described as doubly<br>positive.  It is defined using the following matrix equation:<br><br>                          (1    0)<br>                     H' = (0    1)H'<br>                          (5.5 -2)<br><br>As this matrix involves a fraction, the tempered 2-3 plane is not<br>a basis.  The 0-comma scale involves a just fifth and a tritone<br>equal to 6 steps in 12 tet.  By my original criteria, it "doesn't<br>work" but non-Pythagorean bases can be chosen.  For example:<br><br>                   (s) = (-0.5 1)H'<br>                   (r)   ( 3  -5)<br><br>> Feel free to review you matrix/determinant stuff.<br><br>A full description of interval matrices should arrive with this<br>post.

I've<br>brushed determinants under the carpet for the time being.<br><br>> It may actually be valuable for understanding ancient Hindu<br>> music. Then let's talk 7-limit.<br><br>I'm more interested in making new computer music than describing<br>old music, but I am nevertheless interested in what scales are<br>used by different peoples at different times.  Particularly when<br>those scales can be defined economically by mathematics, ie JI and<br>ETs.

Before you were saying that no<br>inharmonicity could possibly occur, which places too much faith in the<br>simplified models.  Ideally, we should develop more complicated models to<br>give a quantitative estimate of the (upper limit of the) inharmonicity.<br><br>Inharmonicity will cause problems with JI whether or not it's systematic.<br><br>Any noise in the input will cause peaks at the resonant modes.  The result<br>will be inharmonicity.  The level of that inharmonicity can be estimated<br>from the noise level of the input.  I don't know of a good model of the<br>human embouchure (that's the word, isn't it?) although there may be one<br>that is too complicated to escape from the academic literature.<br><br>If the overtones are not centered at the resonant peaks, the amplitude of<br>each overtone on output will depend on it's pitch.  That means, where<br>vibrato is present, the corrected waveform will not be perfectly periodic.<br> This will probably show up as a subharmonic of the heterodyned overtone.<br> Whatever, it isn't important for tuning as the effect will be swamped by<br>the vibrato itself.<br><br>I've had a look at some books on this today.  The pitch from the<br>embouchure is determined by the mode of resonance, but overtones can still<br>arise.  Also, the nature of the mouthpiece is such that noise may not<br>propagate to the conical bit.  Another thing is that it is not only brass<br>instruments that have conical tubes.  Examples of recorded resonances were<br>given for a range of wind instruments, and they're all significantly off<br>from the integer ratios.  This means that the flute, where the initial<br>sound is not periodic, should show the most inharmonicity.  Fortunately,<br>this is one case where experiment agrees with theory, at least on the<br>basis of the one flute sample analysed and explained here recently.  I<br>couldn't find any discussion in books of the inharmonicity of the sound of<br>any instruments.<br><br>The resonances of flutes were also given relative to 12-equal.

Different<br>>> overtones will be reinforced, and the difference tone pattern<br>>> may change.<br><br>> Can you give a concrete example?<br><br>Ooh, nothing concrete, no.  Where two notes are related by<br>a 7-limit interval, this will reinforce the 7th overtone of<br>one of them.  I think this explains why different timbres<br>behave differently in the 7-limit: it depends on the strength<br>of the 7th overtone.  There may be knock on effects in a<br>chord with two 7-limit intervals producing a factor of 49.<br>Instinctively, I recognise the possibility that this sort of<br>thing may lead to prime-limit character, but I haven't worked<br>out any details.

It's generally more<br>>> efficient to say how well different primes are approximated.<br><br>> This may not work if consistency doesn't hold.<br><br>If the approximation is *good* consistency will hold.  If<br>you know the intervals you want to use, a consistency test is<br>more appropriate.  For general rules governing what ratios<br>*might* work, prime approximations are more flexible.<br><br>>> For exactness, state the signed errors, and you can work<br>>> other intervals out from that.<br><br>> Isn't that what Carl Lumma said? But no, you guys are wrong, and that's<br>> the whole reason for the consistency concept. Wendy Carlos, Yunik and<br>> Swift, and others also seem to have missed out on the importance of<br>> consistency.<br><br>I think Carl Lumma (mistakes aside) takes the best<br>approximation for each interval, and tries to describe them in<br>terms of prime intervals.  I really _mean_ to take the best<br>approximations to prime intervals (not necessarily prime<br>numbers) and define the rest from this.  If the scale is<br>inconsistent, one of the intervals will have an error greater<br>than half the step size.  If that error is acceptable, so is<br>the scale.  I'm not wrong.<br><br>Consistency makes sense if you happen to be working within an<br>odd limit.  Expressing the consistency level as a fraction<br>[(step size) / (2 * worst error)] is more precise, and fairer<br>on 46-equal, but also harder to remember than an integer.<br><br><br>On the phi-based meantone: some algorithms show it as almost<br>the optimal 5-limit tuning.  However, it is poor in higher<br>limits, so won't do as a harmonic standard.  I use 31-equal<br>for this purpose: find the best approximation to a given<br>prime interval, take the simplest mapping on the cycle of<br>fifths, and generalise this to all meantones.<br><br><br>>> Incidentally, having different notes on different strings is<br>>> a _good_ thing.  It means you get more chords than you would<br>>> otherwise.<br><br>> Huh? It definitely means fewer positions in which to play a given chord.<br><br>It means both, of course :-)<br><br>With all the chords I've tried so far, it works out fine.<br>For an example, the 7:9:11 chord G-Cb-D#.  Find G on the<br>D string.  Cb is two steps of 31-equal nearer the bridge on<br>the G string.  D# is another step along on the B string.<br>This chord is easy to play on my guitar with an incomplete<br>meantone mapping.  It can be built on E, Fb, A, B, C and D,<br>as well as G, with 19 frets per octave.  As I have an extra<br>fret, I can also build it on F.  On a 19 note meantone<br>keyboard, you can only get this chord on G, D and A.  So,<br>the guitar wins!<br><br>With all 31 notes, of course, you can play as many of these<br>chords as you like.  There are some very common chords that<br>would be too difficult for me, though, so I'm happy with<br>what I've got.
