Did he sit around messing with his<br>> instruments and seeing what happened, or did he work things out in his<br>> head first, and then write down those ideas? Did he write fast, slow,<br>> did he make a lot of corrections, did he agonize over a few notes (as<br>> Miles said Gil Evans would do), or did he think the idea had precedence<br>> over a certain way of expressing that idea? In that regard, I read in<br>> the liner notes to a Bach Lute album that Bach (or others in that period)<br>> would sometimes write things that were idiomatically incorrect for the<br>> Lute, but he knew that the lutenist would take care of it, and adapt it<br>> for his own axe...they were expected to be able to do this...thus, a few<br>> notes here and there were not the issue...the performer was now actually<br>> INVOLVED in the compositional process in a way that is conspicuously<br>> absent from many players of the European orchestral repertoire.<br>> <br>That's indeed an interesting question, perhaps someone better acquainted <br>with HP could answer the other details.  As far as tuning is concerned, <br>Johnston recounted that he composed alone, and not in his head--he would <br>sit at the instruments and plunk around until an idea came that was not <br>only musically adequate, but idiomatic for the instrument.  I understand <br>that Glenn Hackbarth wrote a dissertation on Daphne of the Dunes, which <br>concludes that instrumental performance ease outweighed JI theory, one <br>which I think is well justified i most works; perhpas Oedipus, The <br>Letter, and some of the Intrusions are the exceptions in which just <br>intonation is the dominant force in composition.  Also notable is that <br>the kitharas and HCs, as time progressed, were tuned less for ease of <br>producing just-intervals and more for expressionistic reasons.<br><br>-Adam<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 12 Aug 1996 20:14 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11205; Mon, 12 Aug 1996 20:14:57 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11091<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA00254; Mon, 12 Aug 1996 11:14:54 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 12 Aug 1996 11:14:54 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960812110311.25366A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
