(1-800-827-6364)<br>Lines: 32<br><br>It's great to see all this discussion about Harry Patch!  CRI has kept his<br>music available for more than twenty years.  He's a back bone of our<br>catalogue not to mention the experimental tradition in American music.<br><br>When we reissued on CD The Bewitched, we made a flyer offering both our<br>Patch CDs plus three books by our about Partch and the video of The<br>Dreamer That Remains.  If you e-mail CRI, we can send you this flyer by<br>standard U.S. mail.  Of the three books offered (an annotated catalogue of<br>his works, Genesis of a Music, and Bitter Music), Genesis is out of print<br>when last we checked, but the other titles can be obtained still through<br>CRI.<br><br>AND, we have plans to reissue the majority of Patch's remaining Gate 5<br>recordings on CD.  Gate 5 was Patch's own label wherein he recorded the<br>majority of his major works.  Our two CDs of recordings are drawn from<br>Gate 5 material.  Lots still remains -- many recordings not heard in<br>years.  I spent a weekend last spring with Danlee Mitchell, Patch's heir,<br>in San Diego reviewing the material.   That's all I'll say for now... It's<br>going to be a lot of work to get this done (two or three new CDs) with<br>proper notes and librettos, etc.  So, my guess is winter/spring of next<br>year will be the time to look for a major new Patch series on CRI.<br><br>Joseph Dalton<br>Managing Director<br><br>COMPOSERS RECORDINGS, INC.<br>73 Spring Street, Suite 506<br>New York, NY  10012-5800<br>phone 212.941.9673<br>fax 212.941.9704<br>e-mail:  CRInyc@aol.com<br><br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 15 Aug 1996 18:19 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14587; Thu, 15 Aug 1996 18:19:42 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14588<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA06068; Thu, 15 Aug 1996 09:19:41 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 15 Aug 1996 09:19:41 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960815090347.4556C-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3423 href="#3423">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/1996 6:07:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>You know, I've been pondering Bill Sethares' mention of a study "that<br>approached octave-equivalence from a melodic perspective" (that's probably not a<br>direct quote, but that was the idea).  <br><br>   I don't know whether what I'm about to say will be perceived as...<br>* a pointless statement of an obvious truism,<br>* a surprising but insightful observation, or<br>* utterly preposterous nonsense,<br>but something dawned on me after I read that statement from Bill:  As far as I<br>can tell, octave equivalence is ONLY meaningful from a melodic perspective.<br>That because the entire purpose of fusing individual tones into a chord is to<br>have them lose their individual identities and form a single combined sound.  <br><br>   Now that is not to suggest that two notes an octave apart have to be played<br>in sequence rather than together, for them to be appreciated as octave<br>equivalents.  But if they are played simultaneously, you have to at least<br>auditorially pick the pitch of one tone out of the chord, then the other, then<br>compare the two.  If you were not to do that, then they would be no more than<br>simply a combination timbre like from an organ, rather than tones that sound<br>like two versions of the same pitch.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 16 Aug 1996 15:49 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00511; Fri, 16 Aug 1996 16:31:55 +0200<br>Received: from sun4nl.NL.net by ns (smtpxd); id XA00506<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by sun4nl.NL.net with SMTP<br>	id AA29408 (5.65b/CWI-3.3); Fri, 16 Aug 1996 16:31:38 +0200<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA19443; Fri, 16 Aug 1996 07:30:17 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 16 Aug 1996 07:30:17 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960816071445.7100E-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
