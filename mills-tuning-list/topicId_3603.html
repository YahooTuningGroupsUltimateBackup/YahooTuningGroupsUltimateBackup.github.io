Since we're ironing out<br>the history of using lattice diagrams, I thought I'd<br>make it public.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>When I first designed a lattice graph to represent pitches<br>back around 1988, I used exactly the same triangular<br>format used by you and Erlich, with 5/4 above and to<br>the right of 1/1, and 6/5 below and to the right.  It was<br>something that I came up with by playing around with<br>Partch's Tonality Diamond scheme.<br><br>I was shocked to find out that diagrams exactly like this<br>appeared in a book called "A Graphic Introduction to the<br>Harmon" by Esther Watson Tipple & Royal Merrill Frye,<br>and published back in 1942!<br><br>I just read Mandelbaum's (unpublished) book for the first<br>time, and have found out that Fokker used diagrams very<br>much like mine.  In fact, Riemann's harmonic ideas [c. 1890]<br>are based on a 3^x * 5^y lattice structure.<br><br>Over the past four years, doing research for my book, I've<br>seen almost all of the various visual pitch representations<br>that I thought I invented, in books that were written as far<br>back as 1600!<br><br>So Gregg Gibson [TD 1278] certainly had a point about how<br>we moderns think we're doing something new that's already<br>been done countless times before.  But of course, technology<br>has given us many new capabilities, and we can adapt these<br>old ideas to new technologies.<br><br>I think the 3-dimensional ladder-type lattices I use (see<br>some of my recent postings) are the best way to represent<br>JI systems of more than 3 prime factors.<br> <br>   Joseph L.
