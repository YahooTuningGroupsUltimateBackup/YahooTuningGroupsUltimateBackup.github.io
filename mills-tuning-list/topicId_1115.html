He, once you give the notes<br>of a chord, produces all his possible inversions on guitar keyboard. The<br>number of inversions is so high that it requires a filter that allows to<br>rearrange it with various criterions.<br>These are essentially of two types:<br>a) technical difficulty (fingering)<br>b) level of consonance<br><br>Naturally the point b is a problem so vast and open from seem me often a<br>pure utopia. My objective would be that of establish a "consonance<br>coefficient" that gathers in a number the problematic that the concept<br>of "consonance" implies (beating, harmonics series and many other things<br>that I don't know but that surely anybody of you knows well...)<br>Naively I've thought that this number could be synthesized in a value to<br>give to the various intervals that each inversion requires. For<br>instance:<br><br>octave=3D 12<br>P5=3D 11<br>P4=3D 10<br>M6=3D 9<br>M3=3D 8<br>m3=3D 7<br>m6=3D 6<br>m7=3D 5<br>4+=3D 4<br>M2=3D 3<br>M7=3D 2<br>m2=3D 1<br><br>This is only an example based upon my instinctive list of the intervals.<br><br>A triad of C would get the followings "scores":<br><br>Root position: M3, m3, P5=3D 8+ 7+ 11=3D 26<br>First inversion: m3, P4, m6=3D 7+ 10+ 6=3D 23<br>Second inversion: P4, M3, M6=3D 10+ 8+ 9=3D 27<br><br>The fact that the second inversion is, in according to this strange<br>"score", more consonant than root position is strange but, in effects,<br>in the harmonics series it appears before.<br><br>In short the principal problem is that of establish the values in the<br>intervals list correctly. I don't know if my method is too na=EFve, let m=<br>e<br>know.
