It can be refered to as an enlarged<br>quasi-pythagorean-system (though minor tempered) , in which a system<br>of relays decides between two pitches for each note.<br><br>I've had contact with the department of Music, at Universitet i Oslo, <br>Norway, and I learned from Arvid Vollsnes there, that somebody in the US<br>had begun `something' with reference to Grovens work and principles.<br><br>Now, can I be that lucky, that this/those person(s) is/are reading this ?<br>If so, PLEASE let me know. Id like to hear just a bit about your hypothesis,<br>applications used etc.<br><br>Also, Id appreciate any information, ideas, links to articles etc etc about <br>EIVIND GROVENs works and systems.<br><br><<2>><br>In 1934 an englishman, John Hathwood Compton, did a patent specification <br>which descibes an improvement of  12-tempered keyboard instruments. This is<br>done by using two series of notes, both tempered, but tuned with different <br>references. Thus it is possible to have both pure thirds (by using a note <br>from each series) and nearly pure fifth (the tempered ones).<br><br>I have only got the patent specification, and no other reference to Comptons<br>work and doings. Did he succed in having the pattent (at least for some years)?<br>And - again - if anybody is able to suply any information about this system,<br>references, articles ..... please let me know.<br><br><<----->><br>Just as a final question, does anyone have any good references that<br>throughoutly covers the efforts to combine usual (or nearly-usual) <br>keyboards with the just intonation?<br>Id appreciate ALL inputs concerning this.<br><br>If there really isn't any good reference, please let me know as well.<br>Then I will definitly gather informations on the subject and place it<br>on the Net.<br><br>Sincerely<br>Lars Frandsen<br><br><br>----------------------------------------<br><br><br>E-mail:<br>lafrance@musik.auc.dk<br><br>Universitetsadresse:<br>Lars Frandsen<br>Institut for Musik og Musikterapi<br>Kroghstraede 6<br>DK-9220 Aalborg Ost<br>Denmark<br>Tlf. +45 98 15 42 11 - lokal 3111<br><br><br>Privat adresse:<br>Lars Frandsen<br>Danmarksgade 5, 1.th<br>DK-9000 Aalborg<br>Denmark<br>Tlf. +45 98 12 41 73<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 27 Sep 1995 14:20 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id FAA00187; Wed, 27 Sep 1995 05:20:16 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 27 Sep 1995 05:20:16 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199509271216.UAA02883@csnt1.cs.ust.hk><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
