I have learned a great deal so far and am interesting in<br>exploring many of the scales discussed here.  I have a E-mu Morpheus and have<br>been exploring the 19-tone scale that it comes with pre-defined.  Unless I<br>am mistaken, customizing the user definable tuning table is not too<br>trivial (in terms of time requirement).  The manual says the steps of <br>fine tuning are "approximately 1.56 cents", so I take it one has to a bit <br>of figuring for each MIDI note.<br><br>I'm wondering if there are archives of E-mu sysex tuning tables available<br>and/or any utilities that would construct the sysex tuning table from a<br>formula.  I am under the impression that the tuning tables are "standard"<br>among all current E-mu synths.  Working "by hand" is fine, but slow.<br><br>Thanks for any help, and thanks for such a great forum!<br><br>-- <br>Paul Fly                      |   Our deeds travel with us from afar<br>pfly@nyx.cs.du.edu            |   And what we've been makes us what we are<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 28 Oct 1995 15:54 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id XAA21239; Fri, 27 Oct 1995 23:54:55 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 27 Oct 1995 23:54:55 -0700<br>Message-Id: <009988D5F30ED4AB.0633@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
