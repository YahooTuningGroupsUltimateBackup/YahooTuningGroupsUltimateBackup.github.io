Chicken or the egg?<br><br>Tidbit: microtonal composer Stephen Mayer told me years ago that it was<br>his deaf brother (a medical doctor) that got him singing microtonally.  An<br>apparently idionsyncratic relationship of pitch fed into the imagination<br>of a perfect pitch microtonal composer (who mainly uses quartertones).<br><br>Elodie Lauton's work (just reviewed by David) was based on her hearing an<br>inner "chord" which she made manifest in the drone basis of the work.  Too<br>bad the Knitting Factory is so sloppy with their part of the concert<br>(late sound check, inaequate microphones, sound pops, noises in<br>general...ouch).  Awfully hard to be meditative with that kind of<br>inteference.  The tuning was based on a transposed Pythagorean.<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music	<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@idt.net<br>http://www.echonyc.com/~jhhl/AFMM</div><h3><a id=8799 href="#8799">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/12/1998 1:02:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Thu, 12 Nov 1998, Paul H.
