For your information, it<br>is the tuning that has the largest wandering tonic, 80 cents. When I first<br>started to explore this tuning, the only documentation I had was<br>Blackwood's chord progressions.<br><br> I discovered this wandering tonic by accident, while I was writing ii V7 I<br>progressions in various tunings (7TET, 12TET, 18TET and 22TET). By the way,<br>the 22TET version sounds has a very powerful sound. I can send a short .mid<br>with the I IV V I in 22TET (staying on the same tonic) to anyone<br>interested. <br><br>After thinking for a certain time, I found a melody that was harmonised<br>using only ii V7 I. You've probably heard it, it was last week's microtonal<br>midi moment. Of course, I've used this new musical effect to the limit. I<br>do not want to start a musical revolution, I am just exploring. <br><br>BTW, I am not deaf, I can hear the very "special" sound that my music has.<br>It feels like you don't end up where you're supposed to. It took me a short<br>while to get used to this new sound. It is understandable that people<br>repudiate music whose basic structure is complex. The fact that music that<br>sounds too normal won't be noticed is also generaly accepted.<br><br>The problem is that I am now somewhere in between. If, in the back of your<br>mind, you do not believe that valuable music can be composed using<br>wandering tonics, your perception of the tonic will stay at the 1/1, and<br>when it goes down 80 cents, you will feel uncomfortable. But if you have<br>enough fate to accept the descending of the tonic, the wandering will<br>become natural, and it is  normal music will make you feel a little<br>uncomfortable, because it will sound "too static".<br><br>Now, maybe you think that I am crazy. The same musical could be applied in<br>22TET, and be more "digestible", or more subtile. But 22 does not seem like<br>a challenge to me (for the time being), and I choose to dwelve in this new<br>unexplored territory, to "boldly go where no one has gone before", where<br>tonality is eternaly moving. (There are many other resources, I'll write<br>about them later.)<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 6 Jul 1997 03:00 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05501; Sun, 6 Jul 1997 03:01:20 +0200<br>Date: Sun, 6 Jul 1997 03:01:20 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05515<br>Received: (qmail 24385 invoked from network); 6 Jul 1997 01:01:17 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 6 Jul 1997 01:01:17 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.970705175414.116036D-100000@quake.garlic.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5766 href="#5766">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>7/5/1997 11:13:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>To what degree does atmospheric conditions affect music transmission and<br>>perception?<br>>  o Temperature, Humidity and Pressure (aside from instrumental changes)<br><br>   Uhmmm...

Relativistic motion effects<br>have no meaning in any musical environment, for two obvious reasons and<br>many others:<br>1.  If I remember the math correctly, relativistic effects will be on the order<br>    of 1 MILLIONTH OF A PERCENT (almost certainly of no musical significance<br>    whatsoever) at an airspeed of about 65 billion miles per hour.  At that<br>    speed, heat due to air-friction would incinerate any object capable of<br>    generating or receiving a sound in a matter of nanoseconds.  A few<br>    nanoseconds (billionths of a second) is obviously far too short a time to<br>    develop any sort of musical appreciation for whatever you're hearing!<br>2.  Doppler effect in that sort of environment would turn KHz-range sound<br>    frequencies into either the millihertz or Gigahertz range, either of which<br>    is obviously FAR beyond any human's ability to hear.<br><br><br><br><br>>  o Interference (nearby mechanical and electrical devices)<br><br>   The possibilities - masking for example - are too numerous to list and<br>explore, even in cursory detail, in anything short of a book.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 6 Jul 1997 11:06 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05612; Sun, 6 Jul 1997 11:06:51 +0200<br>Date: Sun, 6 Jul 1997 11:06:51 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05618<br>Received: (qmail 4553 invoked from network); 6 Jul 1997 09:06:47 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 6 Jul 1997 09:06:47 -0000<br>Message-Id: <970706044204_1178835171@emout02.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
