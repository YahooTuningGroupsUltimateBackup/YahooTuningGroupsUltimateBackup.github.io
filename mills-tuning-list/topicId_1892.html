If it is to be viewed<br>metaphysically, then harkening to well-understood physical and biophysical<br>processes is irrelevant to any sort of mystical expose', and seems more<br>likely to be an attempt to make the document appear on the surface more<br>scientific than it is.<br><br><br><br><br>> The first is very near the skin and appears to be a<br>> dark color (its true color is a flourescent red).  ...<br>> The first field is simply the radiation of body<br>> heat, i.e., infrared.

There<br>is nothing spiritual, metaphysical, or aphysical about electricity.  The<br>laws that govern electric and magnetic phenomena have been known, and have<br>gone mostly unmodified, since the late 1800s.  They are known as Maxwell's<br>Equations.  <br><br><br><br>> While<br>> traditional science adequately describes the process of metabolism and<br>the<br>> function of the endocrines, we must accept the possibility that these<br>> glands are governed by forces outside the human organism: solar rythms. <br><br>   Phrases like "traditional science" strike me as a warning sign:  He<br>could be preparing his readers for a later suggestion that "traditional<br>scientists" ignore or ridicule him for no reason other than that they just<br>inexplicably hate him.  More likely, it's because he hasn't convinced them<br>of the scientific validity of his findings.  Or perhaps it's because he<br>doesn't understand the conservative nature of science:  An alternative<br>explanation of well-understood phenomena is rarely interesting to<br>scientists.  What IS interesting when it comes to alternative explanations<br>of well-understood phenomena is when they present new and unequivocally<br>accurate evidence that the previously-accepted cannot possibly explain, but<br>the alternative explanation can.  But different just because of novelty<br>rarely leads to new scientific models.  <br><br>   That being said though, I seriously doubt if many medical scientists<br>would disagree that the sun affects biochemistry and psychology.  <br><br><br><br><br>> There is every reason to believe that the energy fields are the source of<br>> life and may have the potential of surviving the death of the physical<br>> organism.  <br><br>   Uhmmm...  What reason(s) in particular is the author refering to?  <br><br><br><br><br>> they are representative of a more refined cosmic body which requires<br>> electromagnetic (not chemical) nourishment directly from the source of<br>all<br>> life, the sun.  The energy fields, I suspect, would therefore affect the<br>> biophysical organism.<br><br>   Comments on terms:<br>"Cosmic body" has not been defined (at least not in this fragment) and<br>seems to <br>    be an oxymoron.  <br>"Nourishment" here is metaphorical at best.  He has not presented evidence <br>    (again at least not in this fragment) of essential nutrients being<br>gleaned <br>    directly from any form of electromagnetic radiation.  <br>"Energy field" has a very wide variety of possible meanings, so that last <br>    sentence is almost certainly true be default.  <br><br><br><br><br>   Thank you Bruce for taking the time to type this up for us.<br><br>   My best guess, from what little I've read of this document is that the<br>author intends it to be evaluated mystically.  If indeed that is the case,<br>I would recommend that he avoid scientific principles, since they are<br>uninteresting to mysticism, and since, unless he's prepared to pursue them<br>with true scientific rigor, it constitutes poor science.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 26 Mar 1997 12:39 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17948; Wed, 26 Mar 1997 12:39:05 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA17975<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id DAA24496; Wed, 26 Mar 1997 03:37:26 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 26 Mar 1997 03:37:26 -0800<br>Message-Id: <336406c8.2227516398@kcbbs.gen.nz><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5207 href="#5207">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Jo A.

I am sure that we are at the very beginning of<br>our understanding of things electrical and magnetic; Newtonian physics<br>falls apart on the microscopic level and I believe Maxwell's Equations<br>will eventually suffer the same fate.<br><br>I realize it is too much to expect that anyone could make sense out of my<br>previous post taken out of context as it was.  Let me attempt to clarify<br>several of the "mystical" givens that form the basis of these thoughts and<br>then take this discussion off this list if necessary.<br><br>Even from the strictly "scientific" description I presume that all would<br>agree that as the earth evolved out of the sun, so we must see the sun as<br>the source also of life.  Mr. Savoy has proposed that energy, and therfore<br>matter also, has associated with it what he calls intelligence factors<br>(IF) and that it is these IF factors that are responsible for organizing<br>matter into forms which express life.  In fact solar radiant energy is by<br>far the most influential force on this planet.  Savoy proposes that eyes<br>evolved solely for the intake solar energy (intelligence)--Plato's<br>metaphor of the cave is apropo.  By absorbing solar energy in the proper<br>way, changes take place in many ways, from stimulating the rods and cones<br>to perceive a broader range of the electromagnetic spectrum to changes in<br>the endocrine system and resultant physiological changes.  As a result of<br>the IF factors of sunlight there is also a tremendous impact on the psyche<br>of the individual, which can be completely overwhelming (the devil made me<br>do it!). This radiant energy absorption is a kind of nourishment for the<br>organizing fields, or the intelligence that holds matter in particular<br>forms.  These fields reflect certain solar force centers and are linked to<br>particular organ systems of the body.  These fields can eventually "live"<br>independently of the physical body, achieving the potential for<br>"immortality".  Taoist techniques collect "chi" energy, circulating it<br>correctly to raise "shen", spirit, in the pursuit of<br>immortality--unfortunately I believe that the negative alchemical<br>presentation of taoist principles does a disservice to the true ideas,<br>like judging the efficacy of science based on its involvement in producing<br>the atomic bomb. <br><br>But what does all this have to do with music?<br><br>I believe that this general thread of discussion of things "mystical" is<br>the result of several simple questions--as musicians, is there any reason<br>to work with one particular scale or another?  Does musical expression<br>have any particular effect on us, our bodies, psyches, spirits? <br><br>Bruce Kanzelmeyer<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 27 Mar 1997 04:21 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18855; Thu, 27 Mar 1997 04:21:03 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18847<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id TAA10772; Wed, 26 Mar 1997 19:19:39 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 26 Mar 1997 19:19:39 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95.970326190026.480A-100000@equinox><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
