It is for<br>example, a lot less tense than 88CET's closest approximation to a traditional<br>ninth chord (traditional dominant ninth except for neutral third).  <br><br>   Also, the concept of a four-note chord, clearly built in thirds, but spanning<br>a ninth rather than a seventh, has interesting contrapuntal and harmonic<br>possibilities.  Harmonic possibilities for its close-voiced and equally-spaced,<br>yet wide-open, sound on a four-part ensemble.  And contrapuntal possibilities<br>because it can serve as a widening of a seventh chord or inverted triad by<br>contrary motion, but still being constructed entirely in thirds, (i.e., no<br>perfect consonances).  <br><br>   <br>+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+<br>|  Tip #4:                                                                   |<br>|     There's seems to be a lot of cases where 9:7s work well in chords with |<br>|     tritones.  Oddly, some of them (to my ears at least) sound LESS har-   |<br>|     monically tense than either supramajor thirds or tritones alone.       |<br>+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+<br><br><br>   Still, these chords are generally somewhat intense;  more so than the 9:7 and<br>5:3 chord.  One strangely useful chord fragment from my 88CET experimentation is<br>a 10:7 tritone below a 9:7 supramajor third.  Its "acoustic inversion" (to use<br>Dave Hill's terminology), a 10:7 ABOVE a 9:7, also has a distinctive sound.  Of<br>the two, the inversion is the less harmonically tense.<br><br>   Each of the six four-note chords formed by adding notes at 7:6, 11:9, or 9:7<br>thirds below those three-note chords, has a subtly but curiously different<br>flavor.  In my 88CET notation, examples of these six chords would be (in<br>ascending note-order):  (F#, G or A), C, (F or G), C#.  (If you're interested in<br>trying out these chords, but are not familiar with 88CET or my notation system<br>for it, then reply to this message and I'll fix you up one way or another!)<br><br>   Next time we'll talk about some non-pitch-related considerations for finding<br>9:7's characteristic sensation.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 6 Jan 1996 19:39 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id KAA27244; Sat, 6 Jan 1996 10:39:39 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 6 Jan 1996 10:39:39 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9601061234.A15540-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2452 href="#2452">ðŸ”—</a>jpff@maths.bath.ac.uk</h3><span>1/9/1996 3:16:54 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Message written at 8 Jan 1996 21:23:42 +0000<br>In-reply-to: <v01530501ad145f4f4c0b@[128.83.112.162]> (message from James<br>	McCartney on Sat, 6 Jan 1996 15:16:35 -0800)<br><br>May I ask a dumb question?
