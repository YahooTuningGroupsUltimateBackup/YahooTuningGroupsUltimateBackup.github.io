Haverstick)</h3><span>12/19/1996 10:46:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Haverstick here...the cool thing about this forum is that there are<br>some sharp folks on board, who get you to thinking...for example,<br>Szanto's comment that kick ass chops are not enough without solid<br>compositions is right on...it made me realize that I have never<br>separated composition from chops because of an interesting fact: in<br>the blues/jazz bag that I developed my style in, EVERYONE is a com-<br>poser. Why? Because improvisation is the name of the game in these<br>styles, so every time you play, it's SUPPOSED to sound different<br>than the last time...there's a saying, "if you're not making mis-<br>takes, you're not playing"...true indeed. Which also got me to <br>realizing, somewhat sadly, that today's "classical" musicians, by<br>and large, are mainly interpreters of other people's music (the<br>composer) rather than creators (improvisors) who have the ability<br>to create spontaneous compositions with substance and style. I have<br>a lot of respect for, especially, the Baroque masters of Germany...<br>they were EXPECTED to be very proficient in many areas, including<br>writing for church services, playing organ, directing the choir,<br>teaching knucklehead kids who coul;dn't sing, and just generally<br>being monster musicians...of course, Bach was legendary for his<br>ability to spin fugues of great genius onm a moment's notice...<br>what's interesting to me is that today's jazz and blues musicians<br>are the inheritors of the art of improvisation...<br>Also, Bruce Kanzelmeyer's post on spiritual values was wonderful;<br>coincidently, I am studying a book by Alain Danielou, "Music and the<br>Power of Sound", which takes a look at ancient Indian and Chinese<br>systems of music, and relates the structures and cycles to the much<br>larger structures of the whole Universe...the Book of the Hopi talks<br>of flute music that healed a body pierced by an arrow, and Danielou's<br>book also mentions musicians who could heal and achieve incredible<br>states of consciousness. So, I hope Bruce's post does get us to<br>looking at the deeper levels of music...it is true that music has<br>some very basic laws, physical correspondences which were CREATED<br>as part of the structure of the Universe...how we work with these<br>primal laws has a great effect on the world around us...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 20 Dec 1996 09:21 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12803; Fri, 20 Dec 1996 09:23:51 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12807<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id AAA15863; Fri, 20 Dec 1996 00:23:48 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 20 Dec 1996 00:23:48 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612200322_MC2-DB3-FD40@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
