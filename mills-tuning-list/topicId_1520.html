See New Grove et al for more on the arcicembalo.  I don't<br>know if Stembridge has recorded this stuff.<br><br>I thought (FWIW) that it sounded very bland:  all the intervals were<br>just, even in remote keys.  I missed the extra flavour you get with the<br>out-of-tune intervals on normal  keyboard instruments.<br><br>David Griffel<br><br><br><br>Todd McComb     mccomb@medieval.org<br>I don't think you can really characterize the Neapolitan chromatic<br>repertory as "totally lacking in temperment" ... and, of course, the<br>whole point is that the compositions *were* written with split accidentals<br>in mind.<br><br>Anyway, seriously, what do you think of Alan Curtis' recording (Nuova<br>Era 7177)?  Lacking in contrasts?  Just curious.  I like it, but not<br>overwhelmingly so.<br><br>Todd McComb<br>mccomb@medieval.org<br><br><br><br>a440a@aol.com (A440A)<br><br>      I have had the same experience as David.  Total lack of tempering<br>sounds dull in a hurry, without the specific composition properly written<br>to utilize the effect.  Even then, these 20th century ears soon begin<br>looking for a little contrast.<br><br>     The equal temperament of today offers little more contrast than the<br>meantone tunings of yesteryear.  This is logical, as all like intervals<br>are tempered alike. The key of D has as much dissonance/consonance as<br>the key of G#<br>     If you really want to hear tonal contrast in the keyboard literature,<br> it can be found in the keyboard tunings of the 18th century.  The music<br>written for it came from Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert,( and some<br>temperament savvy people say, Chopin.)  There are no concrete dates for<br>temperament changes, but some fairly well supported guidelines.  We know<br>when many of the temperaments were published, and how many of them were<br>received.<br>     These composers created in the age of Werckmeister, Prinz, Neidhardt,<br>and Young.  We know how these theorists described tuning practises of the<br>day, and today, we can once again restore the key coloration that the<br>Well-Temperaments were all loosely based on.<br>     The art of modulation was built on changes in dissonance found among<br>the various keys. This was not a helter-skelter approach of some keys<br>good, some bad,  but rather,  a process that rendered the most used keys<br>more purely tuned.  Broad implications here for modulatory steps.<br>      Since increasing the number of accidentals in the key sig. will<br>cause an increase in the dissonance of the root tonic third,  the<br>signature will often give a hint of what the mood of the key may be.  <br>(the 3rd has a very strong affect on the tonal character of the triad,<br>changes in the amount of tempering in the third changes the tonal nature<br>of the key signature).  In any of the major temperaments of the 18th<br>Century, and much of the early 19th, Cmaj has a very different tonal<br>character than C#maj, and Ebmin is totally different from both.<br>   More to be said on this later.<br>Ed Foote<br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tenn.<br><br><br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 7 Jan 1997 22:24 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA16606; Tue, 7 Jan 1997 22:27:26 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA16601<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA12926; Tue, 7 Jan 1997 13:26:55 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 7 Jan 1997 13:26:55 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SGI.3.95.970107132301.5739A-100000@ella.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
