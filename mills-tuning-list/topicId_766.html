It would also be interested to know, how people that<br>>>include tunings as part of their teachings introduce them (and subdivide<br>>>them).<br>><br>>This is how I would structure a 15-week course on tunings, meeting twice a <br>>week, with musical examples along the way. The course would be "hands on" <br>>with monochords and scalatrons for all.<br>><br>>1. Introduce the octave as an acoustical phenomenon<br>>2. Introduce the 3-limit consonances and Pythagorean tunings<br>>3. Pythagorean tunings as applied to pentatonic scales: Chinese Music<br>>4. 7-ET representations of pentatonic scales allowing modulational freedom: <br>>Thai music<br>>5. Pythagorean tunings as applied to the heptatonic scale: Organum<br>>6. Discuss the pythagorean comma; introduce 12-ET representations of the <br>>heptatonic scale<br>>7. Non-just non-equal-tempered scales: African and much other music<br>>9. Schismatic tuning of late middle ages and medieval Arabic tuning as <br>>Pythagorean approximations to the 5-limit<br>>10. Just intonation: Indian music (I've heard some santoor music where the <br>>intonation is very clearly just 5-limit).<br>>11. Discuss the syntonic comma; introduce meantone temperament: Renaissance <br>>music<br>>12. Equal-tempered versions of meantone -- 31, 19, is 12 good enough?<br>>13. Circulating temperaments/well temperament: Bach and "key colors"<br>>14. 12-TET becomes standard :( , Arabic music measured and played in <br>>"quarter-tones"<br>>15. Equal tempered versions of just intonation: 53, 34, maybe compare <br>>22-equal with 22 sruti of Indian music to show how JI structures are <br>>preserved<br>>16. Atonality, set theory, Balzano and 20-TET and other numerological <br>>constructs.<br>>17. Introduce the 7-limit consonances<br>>18. Augmented sixth chords as meantone approximations to the 7-limit<br>>19. Introduce the 9- and 11-limit consonances in JI: Partch, Johnston, etc.<br>>20. Equal-tempered representations of higher consonances: Huygens, Fokker, <br>>and 31; Herf, Sims and 72, proposals of 41-tone and 171-tone equal <br>>temperaments<br>>21. Inharmonic timbres, tunings to go with them: Gamelan music, modern <br>>explorations<br>>22. Non-octave scales in history and modern non-octave tunings such as <br>>Pierce's 13 per 3:1<br>>23-30. Creative ensemble projects<br><br>I would like to know what JOHN CHALMERS thinks about this.<br><br>I would also like to ask people,like JOHNNY REINHARD, who include tunings <br>as part of their music teachings, if they agree with this. <br><br>I also have a question for ENRIQUE MORENO, McLAREN, and any other on the <br>list who deals with non-octave scales. Do you agree with PAUL's 22nd<br>lecture of his 15-week course on tunings? Do you think it would be right<br>to spend  one hour out of 30 explaining historical and modern non-octave<br>scales? Is that how important they are for the future generations?<br>If you agree explain us how would you split the one hour speech, and if you<br>don't, how would you do it? Thanks in advance!!!<br><br>**********************PART II ***********personal local experience/thoughts****<br><br>As far as I know, in UK, all there is available, are musicians trained to<br>sightread quartertones very accurately. All organized by James Wood (director<br>of the Microtonal Music Centre in London) and the SPNM that 4 years ago<br>organized a composers forum where, after an introduction to tunings, we<br>were introduced to quartertone notation and techniques for diferent <br>instruments. Apart from that, there is Charles Lucy who was doing allright<br>with popular music and who very kindly supports anybody who works with his <br>tuning (I personally found him a bit restricted about the idea of using other<br>tunings that were not acoustically correct according to his theories).<br><br><br>I'm a bit mad about the little access that there is to "microtonality" or <br>tunings in the educational system. Is that how we care for future generations.<br>I just finished a degree on music composition in UK, which is meant to be very<br>experimental, and avant-garde, and what do I get?<br>Nothing was mention about any other tuning system different than the 12-tET.<br>A bit was mention about the freedom of pitches used by Meredith Monk on her<br>compositions (when apparently she also uses Jewish scales, which were not even<br>mentioned on the seminar). It seems that some people like Neil H. are doing<br>very well in getting people interested through playing popular music, and<br>I would also like to know how people are doing in the educational context.<br>By the way Paul, do you have any experience teaching tunings? If so, I would<br>like to hear more about it.<br><br>J.A.M.Salinas<br><br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 20 Aug 1996 13:27 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10468; Tue, 20 Aug 1996 14:09:57 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10477<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id FAA23780; Tue, 20 Aug 1996 05:09:54 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 20 Aug 1996 05:09:54 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9608200820.A391-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
