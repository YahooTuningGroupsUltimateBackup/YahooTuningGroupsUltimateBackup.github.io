No harm, no foul.<br><br>>It happens that for one reason or another, playing live can fail,<br>>temporarily or otherwise, to be an option. Then the resort to non-realtime<br>>at least has the compensation of being potentially without the encumbrance<br>>of notation. I suspect that quite a few readers of this list may be in<br>>that position - which would explain why not many could respond when asked<br>>what method of notation they used. <br><br>Couldn't agree more, and I would have been sunk long ago in my compositional<br>development (hah! such as it is...) without the wonderful tools available to<br>us now.  Whether used as a mock-up for future live performance or as a<br>creative avenue itself, we are having and eating cake.<br><br>>The appeal of software can be compelling for all sorts of reasons. But<br>>perhaps this is not the place to discuss the socialogical aspects of live-<br>>versus canned music. Or is it? <br><br>Hard to say, but then I'm relatively new here. As to my comments about the<br>plethora of numeric data recently, Gary Morrison responded:<br><br>>That's an old but valid criticism of the list traffic.  I personally <br>>think that there's value in both theoretical and musical traffic.  <br>>Some of it I believe has to do with the fact that it's easier to <br>>discuss math in pure ASCII text mail than pure musical ideas.  <br><br>The latter point is undeniable, yet one would assume that the purpose of a<br>specialized community like the tuning list is to have an environment to<br>discuss issues of a more narrow focus.  My only point (and this is where I<br>am at a disadvantage for my short tenure on the list) is that *all* of the<br>discussion is in the service of creating some sort of musical output, or at<br>least a sonic field of dreams, is it not?  I am guessing that the various<br>forms of tuning aren't being explored simply for how they come out in a<br>spreadsheet but for their current/eventual use in a musical context, and<br>what I had not seen represented here, in healthy proportion to the datum,<br>was the *end result* of these investigations.<br><br>But then, I am new, and maybe have missed listings of the works composed by<br>the parties involved.  In any event, we're done, and the notation wars are<br>clammering for fresh cannon fodder.<br><br>Of which I will lurk blissfully on the sidelines.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br>*--------------------------------------------------------------------*<br>   Jonathan M.

Would 1300 or 2000 points <br>make a discernable difference?  I think 1200 is just past the threshold <br>of pitch accuity for human beings.<br><br>In essence this is the digital equivalent to CDs and DATs.  So much pitch <br>information is available as to appear infinite.  Nice proportion, I think.<br><br>Ben Johnson once wrote a piece for me for bassoon and tuba.  We spent so <br>much time deciphering the notation into cents that valuable rehearsal <br>time was lost.  The piece was performed beautifully in tune, but perhaps <br>at a third too slow, or more.<br><br>I do not speak of "conflicts" in the notation, but "conflicting <br>directions" of mathematical calculations.  For a player to have to think <br>up and then down, and maybe up again puts the music in a laboratory <br>setting for analysis.  Finding fingerings take time, rewriting the part <br>takes time, and playing with new fingerings takes time, over and above a <br>conventional 12ET piece.  In AFMM concerts we do it all the time.  The <br>above story is a special case.<br><br>If players can't feel the new intervals there is something much more <br>seriously wrong than the notation used.  Gardner Read has fully <br>catalogued the plethora of pitch alterations in use.

Isn't knowledgeable choice the ultimate path of <br>music making.  Isn't a system a control placed upon one's perspective, <br>one's final fronteir, one's potential.  Lou Harrison once told me that <br>when he taught at Mills which was all-female he would never use the words <br>"tuning system" in the title of a class: no one would show up.  And yet, <br>by all means compose using material that you are comfortable with, <br>whether it be 88ET or Extended Just Intonation.  <br><br>Notation that is less a personalized mythology of meanings of <br>relationships, and more a comparative of all that is available will <br>further the cause of microtonal music significantly.<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@ios.com<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 28 Oct 1996 17:30 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA20505; Mon, 28 Oct 1996 17:30:02 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA20427<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA20203; Mon, 28 Oct 1996 08:29:58 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 28 Oct 1996 08:29:58 -0800<br>Message-Id: <31961028162713/0005695065PK3EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
