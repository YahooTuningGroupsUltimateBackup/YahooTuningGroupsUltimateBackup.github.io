I know I mentioned not being Just-<br>or N-ET-centric, and I hope I have not overstayed my welcome.  I came by<br>because colleagues had indicated to me a general discussion of Partch (with<br>not all sides represented, quite).  I lurked, asked a couple of questions<br>and was encouraged to post.<br><br>Therefore, my apologies if this has gone on *way* too long, and my thanks<br>for Steve to at least hint in that direction in a very congenial manner.<br>And what I couldn't agree with more:<br><br>>However, what about living people making Just and N-ET music?   What about<br>>current tuning theory and musical applications of same?  Who is Partch's<br>>heir?   I guess in a sense we are.  I'd be curious to hear about where<br>>Partch's theories have been taken and if any extensions have been made to<br>>them, or any new music has been made using them.<br><br>Absolutely!  It is time to create new music, new works, all parties<br>concerned.  In this light, it matters not a whit whether you like or dislike<br>the works of HP.  As someone had remarked about Timotheus of Sparta: "He had<br>failed to realize that to dream of desirable changes is one thing; to act<br>upon those dreams is another."<br><br>Then, to dreams, and to action...<br><br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br><br>P.S. I'll be lurking and available for questions -- here, our site or my<br>email addr.<br><br>And Enrique, just how did you find out about the Ceremonial Robes in my closet?<br>*--------------------------------------------------------------------*<br>   Jonathan M.
