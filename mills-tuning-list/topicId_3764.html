The system includes a composition<br>>> engine, performance engine, and arbitrator. The arbitrator provides an<br>>> interface with an application program running a multimedia presentation.<br>>> The arbitrator receives parameters from the application program indicative<br>>> of a user's interaction and the type of music the application program<br>>> requests in response to the interaction. The parameters are passed to the<br>>> composition engine which composes a musical section having a chord<br>>> progression and other data therein. The musical section and a style<br>>> provided by the arbitrator are used by the performance engine to generate<br>>> music sequence data for driving a musical instrument. The performance of<br>>> the musical sequence data by the musical instrument occurs substantially<br>>> contemporaneously with the user's interaction which caused the musical<br>>> section composi<br>>><br>>> tion. Because the composition engine uses processes which vary the<br>>> composition of musical sections, the user events which initiate<br>>> composition of a musical section and which occur at the same place within<br>>> a multimedia presentation, still vary the performance at each user event.<br>>><br>>> Ex Claim Text: A system for composing music in response to a user's<br>>> interaction with a multimedia presentation comprising: an application<br>>> program interface for receiving parameters identifying a style, a shape,<br>>> and a personality for music that conform to said user's interaction with<br>>> said multimedia presentation; and a composition engine for composing a<br>>> musical section corresponding to said parameters so that a user perceives<br>>> the performance of the musical section to be related to said user's<br>>> interaction with said multimedia presentation.<br>>><br>>> Patent Number: 5753843<br>>><br>>> Issue Date: 1998 05 19<br>>><br>>> If you would like to purchase a copy of this patent, please call<br>>> MicroPatent at 800-648-6787.<br>>><br>>>Inventor(s): Fay, C.
