Loose but <br>very exciting, notes appeared like fireworks, often surprising the <br>players as well as the listeners...and that's just what I wanted to <br>happen. Thanks to Alex Lemski for supporting this music...and the people <br>of Denver...Hstick PS...a visiting microtonalist was on hand...Carl Lumma <br>stopped by on his way to the West Coast...we did our best to make him <br>feel at home...</div><h3><a id=7219 href="#7219">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.

Your smallest intervals will be virtually the same,<br><br>   Of course then ALLLL intervals will be the smallest size, which is a<br>little more difficult to play.  But nevertheless, yes, Paul is correct that<br>there are definite advantages to 31TET.</div>
