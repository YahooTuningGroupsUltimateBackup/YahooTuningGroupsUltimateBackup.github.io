The volume on the<br>psychology of music edited by Diana Deutsch some 15 years ago had a<br>fascinating study of performed rhythms (one of the researchers was Paul<br>Zukovsky). It seems that the degree of tolerance for durational ratios is<br>significantly higher than that for pitches. (The performance by the famous<br>conductor ''P.B." was especially tolerant!). <br><br>Since the Babbitt time-point system is not comparing durations but points<br>of attack within the measure modulus, and that a metre typically introduces<br>both accentuation and unequal real durations for beats of equal notated<br>durations, it is possibly here that a reasonable analog to temperament<br>might be found.<br><br>(2) The discussion on modular math has illustrated vividly one of those<br>points where the domains of mathematics and music diverge. The operation of<br>inversion is mathematically transparent in a way that is quite foreign to<br>music. Both our pitch perception and time perception are decidedly<br>directional, and this is, to my ears at least, the great failure of the<br>various serial projects in all their variations. (Babbit, at least,<br>realized this and decided that the row (or set or whatever) was not a<br>theme, and that no version of the row had priority over the others, but the<br>perceptual problems remained when one tried to relate the rows (or segments<br>thereof) to one another.)<br><br>That said, I would be curious to hear if any list member are composing or<br>have composed serially in some tuning besides 12tet (a perfectly reasonable<br>proposition: quick: what are the all combinatorial octochords for<br>16tet?)... or has the whole serial era really passed? <br><br>(3) I am sure that I speak for the majority of the list when I say that<br>eagerly look forward to Jonathan Szanto's review of Robert Goulet's 57tet<br>extravaganza.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 16 Dec 1996 01:24 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05057; Mon, 16 Dec 1996 01:26:41 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05061<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id QAA14774; Sun, 15 Dec 1996 16:26:39 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 15 Dec 1996 16:26:39 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612160025.QAA29079@dnai.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4328 href="#4328">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/16/1996 2:03:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> This is none other than the tuning that Charles Lucy has attached <br>> his name to and has been trying to sell as a musical panacea for the <br>> past several years.<br><br>   And (again recapping old tuning-list ground here) it is also nearly<br>identical with Erv Wilson's "Meta-Meantone", which is the meantone tuning<br>with a consistent beat-frequency between 1 and 3, and 3 and 5 of its 4:5:6<br>chord approximation, but not necessarily other voicings of major triads.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 16 Dec 1996 12:07 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05398; Mon, 16 Dec 1996 12:09:29 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05395<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id DAA17436; Mon, 16 Dec 1996 03:09:26 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 16 Dec 1996 03:09:26 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009ACED1C60D7B20.D434@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
