It had a great name, which<br>I wrote down somewhere...also, I have gotten the impression over the<br>years, that there seems to be a lot of unanswered questions about just<br>what Indian (and other modally oriented folks} musicians are doing when<br>they play...perhaps this is because no Indian master has ever yet<br>written a major book explaining the subject in English; perhaps , also,<br>it has to do with some other, deeper issues, issues which may not be so<br>easy to put on paper, and that you can only understand if you are a<br>participant in the tradition. But, whoever put the great quote "Play in<br>tune or go to hell" on the board left us a great clue, at least: if<br>playing in tune is so important, then just how far away from basic,<br>powerful, naturally pure intervals are they likely to get? If they stay<br>within the parameters of the harmonically real, ratio based intervals,<br>than is it wrong to make certain assumptions about their system? Does<br>anyone out tjhere really know what's going on with Indian, Turkish,<br>Persion, and other such traditions? Or, is it mostly speculation and<br>mathematical ideas, which may or may not be what's "really" happening?<br>I do know that blues is MIGHTY hard to teach in any "logical" fashion,<br>becaus within a loose framework of 3 chords and the 6 tone blues scale,<br>there's a whole lot of room for individual interpretation as to where to<br>put a note, for instance, when you bend the 4th up to the 5th...what is<br>the FEELING you're trying to communicate, that is the issue, and believe<br>me, blues is both profound and microtonal as anything. In this way,<br>perhaps the secrets of blues, which, by the way, is a very improvisatory<br>art form, where performer/composer are one and the same, just like<br>Indian and other "Eastern" modally based forms...perhaps in the essence<br>of the blues we may find some of the keys to understanding those<br>mysterious Oriental traditions.<br>So, is Danielou correct in his interpretattions? Does he miss the boat?<br>A lot of the stuff he says seems pretty sensible and well thought<br>out...but, since I sure don't know the secrets of the stuff he talks<br>about, I could get taken for a ride the wrong way if I am not<br>careful...again, just what IS going on with these deep and ancient<br>traditions, because I feel there's a lot of good concepts about music<br>which we can (re)learn by studying them.   Also, has anyone heard of an<br>author named Raouf Yekta Bey? Sounds like an interesting fellow...Hstick<br><br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 26 Dec 1996 08:21 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02513; Thu, 26 Dec 1996 08:23:53 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03121<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id XAA15139; Wed, 25 Dec 1996 23:23:50 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 25 Dec 1996 23:23:50 -0800<br>Message-Id: <851581523@csst.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
