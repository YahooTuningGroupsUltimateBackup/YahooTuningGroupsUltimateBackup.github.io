I paid<br>>them for a membership renewal a year ago and got one newsletter<br>>when I was promised three. Isn't that mail fraud? (Yes!)<br>><br><br>>From the "What is JI/What is JIN" brochure (also quoted on the JIN Web Site):<br><br>     The duration of a membership is one volume of 1/1, rather than a year<br>     because the publication schedule is irregular.<br><br>>From my editorial in 1/1, 8:2 (Jan, 1994):<br><br>     These days 1/1 is mostly a one-person operation... Hence an issue of 1/1<br>     appears when I have material to fill one and the time to assemble it.<br>     Complaints from members have no affect on these factors...<br><br>1/1 9:3 came home from the printer yesterday. It will be mailed in a week or<br>2. In the meantime, if anyone wishes to cancel their membership, I will<br>gladly refund their money. Once cancelled, however, your membership will not<br>be rentered, as long as we both shall live. I have no tolerance for whiners<br>and complainers these days. If you don't like 1/1's publication schedule,<br>start your own magazine.<br><br>--DBD<br>==========================================================================<br>David B.
