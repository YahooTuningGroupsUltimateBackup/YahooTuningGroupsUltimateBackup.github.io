It starts out at about double the volume of<br>>an individual sin wave, then the volume decreases until the two waves<br>>exactly cancel out at x=10, then come to complement each other and x=20,<br>>and continue to alternate.<br>><br>>If a sin wave is now added which becomes most angular at the place where<br>>the other two waves cancel out, it will tend to make the volume consistent<br>>throughout. Specifically, the function<br>><br>>sin(x/4) + sin(x/5) + 5*sin((x+10)/40)<br>><br>>should have less of a beat.<br>><br>>I say less instead of none because I'm fairly certain I did something<br>>wrong with the volumes. Can someone verify for me whether sin(x) and<br>>a*sin(x/a) are of the same volume? If they are, I know how to make it<br>>exact.<br>><br><br>they're not equal. a*sin(x/a) = a(sq.rt.((1-cosx)/a)) or<br>sq.rt.((a^2-a^2cosx)/(a))<br>i think. 0 would work however. and so would pi. (or would it be 0 and 1?)<br> <br>>Note that phase information is very important here - simply adding a third<br>>sin wave of the correct wavelength but wrong phase will be unlikely to do<br>>a good job fixing the beat.<br>><br>>Unfortunately, I don't have the tools handy to make neat diagrams or sound<br>>files to illustrate the above - could anybody suggest some good free ones<br>>which work under windows?<br>><br><br>does anyone have any sample keyboard programs out of mild curiousty?</div>
