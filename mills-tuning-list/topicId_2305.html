Now I don't<br>want to sound like public radio at fund raising time but... I think we need<br>more contributers to really make this successful. I know that some of you all<br>already have discs out, however, I hope this doesn't dissuade you from<br>contributing a bootleg performance or a home recording. And for those of you<br>that are concerned about the use, distribution or possession of your material<br>let it be said-<br><br>All material submitted remains entirely the property of the composer. All<br>material will only be duplicated and distributed for those contributing to the<br>tape swap project. Furthermore, the tapes will not be sold.<br><br>I don't have lawyer here so that's the best I can do.<br><br>With all that said - don't be shy - send in the music. I mean it's one thing<br>to tune your synth to all these wild tunings but it's quite another to hear<br>pieces by those that have been working within a tuning for any length of time.<br><br>So that address once again to send your music, your SASE (preferably a padded<br>envelope), and your 90minute blank tape is ---<br><br>Denis Atadan<br>13 Washington Street<br>Newark, Delaware 19711<br>USA<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  salinas@lgu.ac.uk<br>Subject:  Julian Carrillo<br>PostedDate:  11-08-97 20:51:58<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  11-08-97 20:51:53-11-08-97 20:51:54,11-08-97 20:50:18-11-08-97 20:50:18<br>DeliveredDate:  11-08-97 20:50:18<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564F0.00679F0C; Mon, 11 Aug 1997 20:51:49 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08074; Mon, 11 Aug 1997 20:51:58 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 11 Aug 1997 20:51:58 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08019<br>Received: (qmail 21675 invoked from network); 11 Aug 1997 18:47:28 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 11 Aug 1997 18:47:28 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.96.970811155111.13716B-100000@kali><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5951 href="#5951">ðŸ”—</a>alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)</h3><span>8/11/1997 5:27:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>I have read that Gerald R.Benjamin has the material in<br>>Indiana University.
