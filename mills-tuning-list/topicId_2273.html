I<br>> didn't quite understand what that meant, but I believe there was an<br>> example that one could play a C# in some cases that was actually at a<br>> lower frequency than a natural C. Maybe I'm not remembering correctly,<br>> but can anyone out there explain the concept of expressive intonation in<br>> greater detail?<br><br>The idea of "expressive intonation" arises from the use of strict<br>microtonalism which often becomes so specific that the performer has no<br>room for interpretation by means of pitch shifting, vibrato, portamento,<br>etc.  When the composer specifies exactly which pitch s/he wants from a<br>gamut of 31 or 1200 or more steps-per-octave, musicality often gets thrown<br>out of the window.  Expressive intonation is not a system, but just an<br>issue that may be addressed by a vague-ness in the notation, a program<br>note, or other ways that best suit your music.  I assume that most<br>people who work with equal temperaments will want to limit this as much<br>as possible, (which still allows for expressiveness in articulation,<br>rhythm, dynamics, etc.).  In my music, I have been working on finding good<br>ways to use Extended Just Intonation as a goal, while giving the performer<br>a chance to show their musicality.  This is much the same as standard<br>tonal music performance-practice, except that it accepts higher<br>overtone-relationships as consonances.<br><br>Adam B.
