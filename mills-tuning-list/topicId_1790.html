There are several examples of very<br>near matches in harmonic ratios.  They centre around the near equality<br>of the numbers 81 and 80, 64 and 63 and some other lesser ones.  These<br>numbers are all important in my view because they are all numbers with<br>many ways to be factorised and so have many harmonic relationships.<br>Changes in the relative importance of notes come into play when we shift<br>around in the multidimensional world of tonality.<br><br>The 81/80 shift is the easiest one to get to happen and is no doubt<br>familiar to all, but I repeat it just to set the scene.  If we have a<br>Just Intonation scale of 24 27 30 32 36 40 45 48 and move by a fifth<br>then we multiply all these by 3/2 and get 36 40.5 45 48 54 67.5 72 which<br>when brought back into the original range is 24 27 33.75 36 40.5 45 48.<br>So we dropped 30 and added 33.75 which is our sharp coming in, and<br>replaced 40 by 40.5 or an 81/80 shift.  Of course if we repeat this 12<br>times they will all shift and we get Pythagoras comma problem.<br><br>If we accept the ratios 28 and 42 as being the minor 3rd and minor 6th<br>(please excuse my lack of proper musical jargon) then we can see that<br>these will become 42 and 63 (or 31.5) when we transpose by a fifth.<br><br>This 63 introduces another near miss with a difference of 63/64.<br>There are other more subtle near misses.<br><br>It is also possible to shift key by a major third and so we can multiply<br>the JI scale by 5/4 to get 30 33.75 37.5 40 45 50 56.25 60 which in the<br>original range is 25 28.125 30 33.75 37.5 40 45 and so lots of notes<br>have gone wandering.  The 28.125 value is however very close to 28 and<br>the ratio of 225/224 is one of the many lesser near misses.<br><br>When I used my little BASIC program to calculate all the strong<br>harmonics according to the factorisations of each number (which is a<br>measure of their total number of musical relationships) then I found a<br>couple of interesting things happening as I went to higher numbers.<br>Sometimes as I compared the pattern as I went up octaves one harmonic<br>would gradually fade and a nearby one would come in.  This happens with<br>both 81/80 and 64/63 ratios.  In fact, if we consider a tonic as 1 then<br>although 6 octaves above is 64 alright, after a few more octaves the<br>most dominant note is 63*2^n not 64*2^n.  There is evidence of this type<br>of thing in the Indian musical scale although I don't know enough about<br>the music to say whether it happens in the music itself.<br><br>Does anyone else have thoughts on whether there might reasonably be such<br>a funny scale used which had the tonic tuned at successive octaves to<br>say 16 32 64 126 252?  This would be most likely to occur when the <br>.. oh bugger, my musical knowledge doesn't allow me to express myself<br>(HELP) let me go back a bit.  Say we are in C major and we have Cs at<br>frequency 16 32 64 126 252 with this funny discontinuity between 64 and<br>126.  In parctice 63 wants to exist also and 128, but we don't have<br>enough keys.  ... anyway, to resume, this is likely to happen when we<br>are also using Eb and Bb in our music because these have the ratios 28<br>and 42 already, which want the 63 and 126 rather than 64 and 128.  Does<br>this make sense?  I am suggesting that the emphasis might change between<br>the low and the high octaves.<br><br>Here is a grand chord that demonstrates the simultaneous use of such<br>"out of tune" octave notes:  8 12 16 20 24 28 32 42 56 84 126<br><br>Similar examples can be found that want both a 5/4 and 81/80 tuning in<br>different octaves.  Is this something that has ever been suggested<br>before?<br><br>Of course you realise that there is a secret plot.

I'll confess I <br>was feeling a little guilty at having addressed only Paul Erlich's <br>general statement about Greeks and irrationals, without moving on to <br>their treatment of music, where, for the reasons Jonathan has given, <br>irrationals were indeed shunned. I would still maintain, of course, that <br>if the Greeks had broken their quadrivial constraints, and tried to <br>reinterpret Aristoxenus in terms of irrational equal divisions, the 30th <br>root of 4/3 would have been by far the most likely choice of a basic <br>unit. The fact that when this break was eventually made, in the 16th <br>century, Aristoxenus was taken to be the father of 12TET, reflects the <br>needs of Renaissance theorists, and not those of Greek antiquity. <br>Aristoxenus was needed as a precedent, to justify the abandonment of <br>numerus sonorus dogma; without citing a precedent, these ideas could, in <br>the intellectual environment of the times, have been summarily <br>dismissed. Renaissance theorists were therefore primarily interested in <br>the use that could be made of Aristoxenus to serve their purposes; the <br>truth of their interpretation of Aristoxenus was only a secondary <br>consideration.<br><br>-- <br>Jonathan Walker<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 10 Mar 1997 15:00 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00522; Mon, 10 Mar 1997 15:00:33 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00520<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id FAA20001; Mon, 10 Mar 1997 05:59:02 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 10 Mar 1997 05:59:02 -0800<br>Message-Id: <33240F0D.27CE@cavehill.dnet.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
