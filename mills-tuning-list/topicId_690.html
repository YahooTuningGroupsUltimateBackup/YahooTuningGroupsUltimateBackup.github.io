It <br>appeared that he was trying to defend the idea that a <br>finite collection of integers had only one generating <br>function.<br><br>Marion<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 31 Jul 1996 07:49 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA16459; Tue, 30 Jul 1996 22:49:27 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 30 Jul 1996 22:49:27 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199607310547.XAA03268@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3367 href="#3367">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/1996 9:54:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I have to admit, whether true to the dictionary definition or not, I tend to<br>associate the word "elitism" with ... oh, for lack of a better word, chauvinism.<br>To me it carries the connotation that not only are you in fact good, but you<br>know it too.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 7 Aug 1996 15:00 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02963; Wed, 7 Aug 1996 14:59:49 +0200<br>Received: from sun4nl.NL.net by ns (smtpxd); id XA02961<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by sun4nl.NL.net with SMTP<br>	id AA19094 (5.65b/CWI-3.3); Wed, 7 Aug 1996 06:55:18 +0200<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA10417; Tue, 6 Aug 1996 21:54:01 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 6 Aug 1996 21:54:01 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960807045253_71670.2576_HHB63-16@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
