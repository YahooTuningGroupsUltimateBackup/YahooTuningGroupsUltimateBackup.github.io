Given the problems with<br>harmoniums, he did indeed receive a Guggenheim with Marshall<br>to build an electronic instrument, but this project was<br>soon abandoned and the funds used for recordings and upkeep<br>or construction of acoustic instruments. =<br><br><br>It is unclear how serious the electronic project ever was.<br>I have heard more than once that it was a subterfuge by<br>Marshall to get the Guggenheim to otherwise support Partch's work.<br><br>Partch would later write (in the second edition of _Genesis_,<br>pp. 210):<br><br>"The musicality, versatility, and potentialities of these<br>old-fashioned harmoniums are constantly amazing. I would not<br>trade my two Chromelodeons for any electric organs that I<br>have ever heard."<br><br>Even later, reportedly, when he was told about the Motorola<br>Scalatron project, he apparently reacted with resignation =<br><br>that it had came 30 years too late for him. Given the musical<br>limitations of the scalatron, with its tacky electic organ<br>swell, it is hard to imagine Partch ever actually using one.<br><br>Making an electronic substitute for a harmonium is an<br>interesting problem. The breath-like quality of the bellows,<br>the uneven voicing of the individual reeds, and the<br>variable response of the knee swells would all have to be<br>considered. In the case of the Chromelodeons, the double stops<br>and octave coupler introduce additional, considerations in that<br>the added reeds do not respond identically.<br><br>An alternative to this is manufacturing new reed organs.<br>This is still done in India, albeit in poor quality, and<br>I wonder if Indian makers might produce more useful instruments<br>if commissioned.  =</div>
