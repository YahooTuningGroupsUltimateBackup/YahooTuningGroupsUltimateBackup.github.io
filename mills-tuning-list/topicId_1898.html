The article <br>showed that "second-order-maximal-evenness," along with one other property, <br>was sufficient to define the four rotationally distinct gramas of early <br>Indian theory. Well, I accidentally discovered that a slightly different <br>(but no more complex) definition of second-order-maximal-evenness is <br>sufficient to give you the gramas without invoking any additional <br>properties. If you are interested, I will discuss this definition.<br><br>Incidentally, I believe the gramas resulted from tuning pure thirds and <br>fifths, which were then reckoned in terms of 22 degrees, which can be <br>explained in many ways. I don't find plausible the argument that the 22 <br>degrees were a "universe" from which the scales were chosen. Nonetheless, if <br>one goes down that path, there is an easier derivation of the gramas than <br>that in your paper.<br><br> -Paul E.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 25 Mar 1997 22:46 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA16858; Tue, 25 Mar 1997 22:46:07 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03373<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id NAA06203; Tue, 25 Mar 1997 13:43:11 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 25 Mar 1997 13:43:11 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B1CF40E3F1432.8A33@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
