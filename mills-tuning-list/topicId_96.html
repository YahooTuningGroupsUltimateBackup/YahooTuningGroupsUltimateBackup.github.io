Apparently when<br>his word processor wraps a long line, the line gets truncated somewhere <br>in the chain of systems it passes through. Unfortunately, it usually<br>looks complete on my screen, so only if I pass his text through my word<br>processor, insert a CR at the end of every line, then save it again as <br>an ascii file, can I be assured that it will be legible. This takes some <br>time and I have been loath to do it.

We all seem so delighted with the ease at which<br>we are able to do these things.  So let me shed some additional light on the <br>subject.<br><br>Hindu-Arabic number system along with its place holder notation was assimilated<br>by west around 825 A.D.  The decimal system appears about 1600 A.D. and shortly<br>thereafter we get logarithms.  Next comes the 2 space coordinate system followed<br>by Calculus.  With calculus we get a deep insight into the nature of solving<br>problems which previously were very demanding even though solutions of sorts<br>had been known for millenniums.<br><br>To guess the sixth root of two?  The method thought to be employed since Greek<br>times for comparing the sizes of two ratios is that of continued fractions.  It<br>ain't easy by a long shot.  <br><br>As for the post from our pool player (I don't have his name either only his <br>Email address) which gave the formula for the twelfth with the powers of eleven,<br>this formula is a direct result of Newton's Method hence it requires the knowledge<br>of Calculus.  I believe that the same could be said about Manuel Op de Coul's<br>formula.  I think there is a slight difference between his and the Babylonian<br>rendition.   I looked up in my Math History textbook and found that the <br>Babylonians were able to do cube roots.  The Chinese have had a type of decimal<br>system for nearly as long with algorithms for these two problems as well.  <br><br>I also remember reading that the man who discovered logarithms used the twelfth<br>root of two as the first problem solved using this new system.  <br><br>I believe that the answer was not as important to them as was the method and its<br>basis were, or what they could learn about the deeper nature of things by <br>studying the problem.
