I'm<br>hoping to build a pair of matched leslie-type speakers but currently I don't<br>know much about the acoustics of cabinet building. Does anyone know of a good<br>book that would act as a practical reference source for this sort of thing. In<br>fact, I would be interested in talking to someone first hand who builds or<br>designs cabinets. So, if anyone of you know someone that might take a few<br>moments out to talk to me about this I would appreciate if you could pass<br>my name and number along to them or, conversly, send me their name and number.<br>Thanks,<br><br>Denis Atadan<br>(302) 654-7337<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 1 May 1997 04:04 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12466; Thu, 1 May 1997 04:04:18 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01138<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id TAA25530; Wed, 30 Apr 1997 19:02:45 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 30 Apr 1997 19:02:45 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01541100af8d4f573e5e@[207.207.2.133]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
