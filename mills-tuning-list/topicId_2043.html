This has been there<br>> for a long time now.  Look at cpsxpch.<br><br>Thanks John. I have looked at cpspch. It seems to me to be related to<br>pitch class, which is inherently related to modulo-12. For that reason, I<br>tried another way. I thought it was more exact (and therefore less likely<br>to mislead) to use modulo-7 numbers, rather than modulo-12.<br><br>In my demo program - which I cooked up for students to discover the<br>differences in the sound of triads produced on 2-limit and 3-limit scales<br>as discussed in Doty's book - I found a way to do this using cpsoct as<br>Scala also gives values (using SHOW/FREQ) that contain the tuning in<br>oct+cps. In my program, pitch is defined in the .ORC file using goto<br>statements which access 7 oscils that contain<br><br>	cpsoct (ioctave + ktonic)<br>	cpsoct (ioctave + ksupertonic)<br>	cpsoct (ioctave + kmediant)<br>	cpsoct (ioctave + ksubdominant)<br>	cpsoct (ioctave + kdominant)<br>	cpsoct (ioctave + ksubmediant)<br>	cpsoct (ioctave + ksupermediant)<br><br>The values of ktonic, ksupertonic, etc.. are defined in the .ORC files. <br>Pitch can then be specified in the .SCO file as two parameters, octave<br>number and percentage of an octave. The .SCO files are as easy for the<br>user to read in cpsoct as they are in cpspch too.<br><br>Maybe the question should be : is it being too pedantic to try and express<br>these JI pitches in a numbering system other than 12. What do you think ? <br>Anyway, I hope to post the code on Mark's website later this week. <br><br>	http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint/greg.htm<br><br>I'll inform the list when it is ready. Thanks Mark for setting this up.<br><br>Aside from the issue of expressing pitches without using pitch classes,<br>it's been suggested that I use Pearl as a string editor on a PC to tailor<br>Scala output by stripping away unwanted character strings. This would<br>allow me to generate Csound .SCO and .ORC files entirely from within<br>Scala. Has anyone done this already ? <br><br>Greg S<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 14 May 1997 13:30 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01609; Wed, 14 May 1997 13:30:04 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 14 May 1997 13:30:04 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01607<br>Received: (qmail 14040 invoked from network); 14 May 1997 11:30:00 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 14 May 1997 11:30:00 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541102af9da53a27dd@[207.207.3.165]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
