More than I had previously realized.<br><br>Since a string players can roll a finger to get about 27 cents, and wind <br>players cannot merely "press and blow" and hope to get within 27 cents of <br>given pitch target, cents tunes their mind up (not the instrument).<br><br>Paul effectively pointed out to me that one need not use numbers higer <br>than 25 if noteheads are enharmonically chosen.  In other words, since I <br>use notated quartertones and all deviations are an eighthtone or less <br>from any particular quartertone, using more than 25 cents would seem moot.<br><br>Thinking further, I still like using a number up to 49 cents.  Wind <br>players remember new tuning relationships in part by new fingerings.  The <br>motoric, physical memory is most valuable in learning new microtonal <br>music.  Sometimes the allocation of a single finger to an established <br>fingering cements the new pitch to the mind.  Additionally, unneccessary <br>enharmonicism might cloud clear tonal relationships that would gain from <br>easy recognition.<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@ios.com<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 21 Nov 1996 16:48 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02555; Thu, 21 Nov 1996 16:49:59 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02556<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id HAA28462; Thu, 21 Nov 1996 07:49:55 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 21 Nov 1996 07:49:55 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.961121072747.13487B-100000@delta1><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4097 href="#4097">ðŸ”—</a>Allen &#x3C;STRANGE@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/21/1996 8:53:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Brian will be happy to learn that at SJSU, due largely to the efforts of<br>Brian Belet, we have thrown out the "worst" of the traditional music<br>theory core, keeping, hopefully the "best"- the first week or so of which is<br>learning and exploring the ramifications of the harmonic overstone system and<br>learning one's ratios.<br><br>=========================================================================<br>|                          Allen Strange                                |<br>|            http://www.music.sjsu.edu/Music/strange.html               |<br>|_______________________________________________________________________|<br>| Electro-Acoustic Music     | International Computer Music Association |<br>|        Studios             |        2040 Polk St., Suite 330          |<br>| School of Music            |        San Francisco, CA 94109           |<br>| San Jose State University  |VOX + (408) 395-2538 Fax + (408) 395-2648 |<br>| 1 Washington Square        |      Email: icma@sjsuvm1.sjsu.edu        |<br>| San Jose, CA 95192-0095    |  URL http://coos.darmouth.edu/~icma      |<br>| Telephone +(408) 924-4646  |                                          |<br>| Fax +(408) 924-4773        |     We hope to see you at the ICMC97     |<br>| <strange@sjsuvm1.sjsu.edu> |         in Thessaloniki, Greece          |<br>|                            | http://alexandros.csd.auth.gr/~icmc97/   |<br>|                            |  email:icmc97@alexandros.csd.auth.gr     |<br>|=======================================================================|<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 21 Nov 1996 18:52 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01996; Thu, 21 Nov 1996 18:53:35 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02754<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA01153; Thu, 21 Nov 1996 09:53:33 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 21 Nov 1996 09:53:33 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v02130505aeba449c092e@[192.168.11.207]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
