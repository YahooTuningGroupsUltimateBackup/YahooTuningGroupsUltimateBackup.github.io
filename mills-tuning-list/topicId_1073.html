I think the study was conducted by Plomp and Levelt<br>(or something like that - I don't have the reference in front of me).  <br><br>   But anyway, two factors strike me as especially significant about Bill's<br>approach:<br>1.  It builds from experimental results that strike me as hard to believe, but<br>    I'm 90% confident are due to the fact that the experimenters used <br>    sinewaves (their "dissonance" curve looked somewhat like the integral of<br>    a typical bell-curve if you can imagine that), and<br>2.  Bill uses this seemingly unrealistic set of experimental results with <br>    sinewaves, to form what is almost certainly the most complete, accurate,<br>    and practical approach to the meaning of "consonance" and "dissonance" <br>    (the latter more accurately being called "discord").  <br>Along the first lines - surprising conclusions of the indepth experimental study<br>- it concluded that minor ninths and major sevenths are about as consonant as<br>octaves.  I find that difficult to swallow even with sinewaves.  I have a<br>preconceived notion that major sevenths and minor ninths have to be<br>comparatively discordant in ANY timbre.  I have to confess that, based upon his<br>accompanying tape, it could well be that my preconceived notion in that regard<br>is at least partly false.  <br><br>   But anyway, I'm about 98% certain that what I'll find as I read further, is<br>that he'll attribute the discord of major sevenths and minor ninths absolutely<br>100% to a "rough" (fast) beat between the second harmonic of the lower tone with<br>the fundamental of the higher tone.  That suggests that half-wave symmetrical<br>tones (no even harmonics) will not produce discordant M7s and m9s, which again<br>strikes me as counterintuitive.  <br><br>   But the undeniable fact of the matter is that Bill's techniques and ideas<br>absolutely DO work.  That in turn seems to make it hard to deny that what I<br>described above is indeed a case of preconceived notions.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 4 Nov 1996 21:16 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA16536; Sat, 2 Nov 1996 20:26:05 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01566<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA01387; Sat, 2 Nov 1996 11:26:02 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 2 Nov 1996 11:26:02 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009AAC840564E580.8B7F@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3908 href="#3908">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/1996 10:04:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Ooops, I just realized that the integral of a bell curve is all wrong.

This has been <br>attributed to second-order beating, which can be thought of as beating <br>between the lower tone's summation tone with itself and the upper tone. <br>However, at a low enough volume, second-order beating should disappear. I <br>vaguely remember reading that it doesn't disappear, which was taken as <br>evidence for periodicity pitch detection.<br><br>Plomp and Levelt's main results need to be taken seriously in any theory of <br>consonance. K&K (two Japanese workers -- I can't remember their names) <br>calculated consonance curves based on Plomp and Levelt's results. K&K <br>assumed some typical harmonic series, and assumed (I think) that total <br>roughness is the sum of the individual sine-wave roughnesses calculated <br>according to P&L's results. They derived the usual consonance/dissonance <br>relations by defining consonant intervals as local minima on the graph. <br>Clearly, with inharmonic timbres, none of the usual consonant intervals <br>would appear (except the unison), and a whole new set would arise. This is <br>the basis of Sethares' work, I believe.<br><br>However, there is an additional component to consonance that is a somewhat <br>separable issue. It goes under many names, such as "spectral fusion," <br>"rootedness," etc., and is the degree to which the entire set of sine waves, <br>belonging to more than one complex tone, approximates a single harmonic <br>series. The harmonic series is privileged in our auditory system as the <br>information is "compressed" into a single pitch (the fundamental, even if it <br>is physically absent) and timbre (which represents the relative amplitudes <br>of the harmonics). For instruments with harmonic timbres, this phenomenon <br>explains the difference in consonance between "otonal" and "utonal" chords, <br>whose roughness (if equal to the sum of the roughnesses of the individual <br>intervals) is identical, but whose consonance is not. For minor vs. major <br>triads, this may be arguable, but for complete 11-limit hexads, it's pretty <br>easy to hear that the utonal chord is less consonant. This is because the <br>otonal chord forms a single harmonic series, while the utonal chord can only <br>be considered a harmonic series if four- and five-digit harmonic numbers are <br>allowed. Tones with completely inharmonic spectra may be formed into chords <br>that have the same degree of roughness as an "otonal" or "utonal" chord of <br>harmonic spectra, but this other component of consonance will favor both of <br>the chords with harmonic spectra over the inharmonic one. This is because <br>any pair of tones, even in the utonal chord, forms a harmonic relationship, <br>and, particularly for the perfect fifth, the set of harmonics resulting from <br>the pair of tones forms a single harmonic series (in the perfect fifth, this <br>harmonic series is 2/3 complete).<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 4 Nov 1996 21:34 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01146; Mon, 4 Nov 1996 21:35:32 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01149<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA00486; Mon, 4 Nov 1996 12:35:27 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 4 Nov 1996 12:35:27 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199611042038.UAA24942@gollum.globalnet.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3918 href="#3918">ðŸ”—</a>PAULE &#x3C;ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/1996 2:32:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>The two factors contributing to consonance, roughness and tonalness, are <br>often associated with Helmholtz and Rameau, respectively.
