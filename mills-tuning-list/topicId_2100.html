Medieval music theory<br>for the motion of melodic voices is based upon the assumption that the<br>scale is pythagorean. Therefore the dorian is going to have a 3/2 fifth at<br>the interval d - a. A combination of this tuning and the standard rules for<br>melodic motion leads logically to something like a raga with a distinct<br>identity for each mode, albeit obligatory ornamentation (like gamakas) must<br>remain a matter of conjecture. There is simply too little evidence one way<br>or another, and the difference over time and in different places must have<br>been enormous (as is true for South Indian music, for example.) Later polyphonic music may or may not require just thirds and comma shifts<br>to accomodate these, or the whole matter may be rendered moot by a<br>temperament (i.e. equal on fretted strings, meantone on keyboards). In any<br>case, a 40/27 on the dorian tonic would only be the consequence of a justhexachord on c (assuming that just hexachords ever were current), but could<br>be corrected to 3/2 by RE on the hexachord on G. Ancient greek music is another matter altogether. There is no theoreticalevidence one way or another of rules regarding tritone leaps - or of any<br>rules about melodic motion except for the labeling of certain common<br>motions. If I recall correctly, however, some of the preserved fragments do<br>have augmented fourth or diminished fifth leaps.
