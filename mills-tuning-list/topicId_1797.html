I can't tune up the triads easily today, but<br>I did calculate the following:<br><br>		Fifth	Major T 	minor t (in cents)<br>PE's tuning	720	372		348<br>15-tet		720	400		320<br><br>720-F 18.05 		(720-F)^2	325.62 <br>T-372 14.3137 	(T-372)^2 204.88<br>400-T		13.683		(400-T)^2 187.31<br>348-tm 32.36		(348-tm)^2 1047.09<br>320-tm 4.36		(320-tm)^2 19.0<br><br>Now let us sum the squared errors of the fifth and the Major<br>Third for both tunings:<br>15-tet 325.62 + 187.31 512.93<br>PE's  325.62 + 204.88 530.5<br><br>15-tet is the more consonant tuning by this test, though not by much.<br><br>Now let us add the squared error of the minor third to each.<br>15-tet 512.93 +19531.93<br>PE's 530.5 + 1047.09	77.59<br><br>I will stipulate that this is a very large difference, but we already <br>knew that 15 tet was the more consonant. Whether the subjective<br>difference is proportional to the difference in the summed squares<br>is something to be determined experimentally.<br><br>After I did this (to put off doing my taxes, alas), I decided to<br>look for a tuning that would equalize the errors in major/minor triads<br>with fifths of 720 cents. I solved these two equations: X + Y 720 <br>(X, Y are the Major and minor thirds) and X-386.3137 Y-315.6413  <br>(errors in TM, tm). By substituting in, one gets 395.3362 for X, <br>324.6638 for Y, 9.0225 for the absolute differences and 488.43 for <br>the total squared  error as (9.0225^2 x 2 + 325.62), 407.03 without <br>the tm. This is also the unweighted least squares minimum error solution <br>as well. [(TM-X)^2 + (tm-720+X)^2, differentiate wrt X, set equal to<br>zero, solve for X.] As both thirds are on the sharp side, this should<br>be a pretty good tuning. (Essentially what I did was to take the <br>error in the Fifth and split it between the two thirds.)<br><br>For comparison, the corresponding values for 10-tet with its neutral<br>third of 360 cents are 1018.03 and 2985.72. Ten fails by both tests<br>again.<br><br>Paul is correct that 15-tet is the more consonant of the two tunings he <br>suggested and he is certainly correct that adding in the minor third <br>(or Major Sixth) shows the differences dramatically. My point (in case<br>someone forgot what we are discussing) is that in this case using just <br>the <br>fifth and major third is sufficient to demonstrate the difference in<br>consonance, on the assumption that squared errors from JI is a good<br>proxy measure consonance. <br><br>In the meantone cases, I think it would be very difficult to hear the <br>differences between the various tunings we've suggested, but Paul could<br>be right.<br><br>--John<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 6 Mar 1997 01:05 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07210; Thu, 6 Mar 1997 01:05:32 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07202<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id QAA14942; Wed, 5 Mar 1997 16:02:13 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 5 Mar 1997 16:02:13 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.91.970305154922.23970B-100000@si.UCSC.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
