A factor in psychological effect of music in addition<br>to that of frequency ratios in individual chords is the interval over which <br>a chord root transition is made - say by a fifth, by a 9/8 major second, by a<br>6/5 <br>minor third, etc.  Also, do small deviations - say by five cents - from just <br>of the interval between the roots of successive chords affect the<br>psychological <br>effect of the part of the musical phrase formed by these two successive<br>chords? <br><br>Historically the idea of the 3/2 consonant fifth appeared long before there is<br>evidence that two or more harmonizing parts were frequently employed in music.<br>Of course the second note of a melodic interval would be mentally "harmonized"<br>with the first note.  I believe many people can easily detect a melodic fifth <br>which is off from just by five cents.<br><br>Thinking as I write, I believe that there are objective, scientifically<br>demonstrable <br>relationships between pitch relationships in music (among all the other<br>factors) <br>and the psychological effects of the music.  Also, it would seem that if our <br>understanding of the effects of these factors were deepened, it would be <br>possible to create music which is even better at creating various specific <br>psychological effects than is present day music.  Thus Beethoven's music is <br>emotionally moving for quite a few people.  Why?  We would say that Beethoven <br>was an inspired genius who had a feel for what musical edifices would be<br>really <br>effective psychologically.  However, I believe that if - and this is beginning<br>to <br>seem possible today - we really understood more quantitatively how music <br>achieves its psychological effects, music could be produced - by individuals<br>who <br>had deep understanding of this and had enough of Beethoven's gifts to<br>effectively <br>use this understanding - which would equal and even surpass the music which <br>Beethoven produced.<br><br>I believe that relatively fine nuances of tuning are much more important<br>towards <br>music's achieving the psychological effects which it has the potential to<br>produce <br>than has generally been appreciated in the recent past.  Many are now aware of<br>this <br>and this is very encouraging.</div>
