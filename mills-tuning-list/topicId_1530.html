You can keep a set of say, four pitches, plus octave and <br>some fifth transpositions thereof, in your mind, and notice any new pitches <br>as a "shift" in the music -- this is one reason modulation is so effective <br>in delineating compositional structure.<br><br>>I personally like the sound of<br>>a<br>>slight pitch adjustment in an inner voice corresponding with a change in<br>>harmonic<br>>context. I find it almost a spiritual affirmation as the subtle correction <br>is<br>>made; it sounds so right.<br><br>It makes me queasy. Sometimes a syntonic comma will pass by unnoticed, but a <br>septimal comma -- I'm running for the toilet.<br><br>However, I have written a (mostly) triadic piece where successive shifts of <br>chromatic semitones, 36/35s, 49/48s, and a limma, adding up to a perfect <br>fourth, have a certain melodic integrity, but only in 22-tet because all <br>these intervals are represented by 55 cents! Any effect, no matter how <br>unpleasant in isolation, can become beautiful if it becomes a basic, <br>repeating structural element. Many in the avant-garde have noticed this.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 10 Jan 1997 20:09 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA19725; Fri, 10 Jan 1997 20:12:38 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA19741<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA16228; Fri, 10 Jan 1997 11:12:35 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 10 Jan 1997 11:12:35 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3.0.32.19970110110717.0068a970@adnc.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4577 href="#4577">ðŸ”—</a>Matt Nathan &#x3C;mattn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/1997 11:45:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Jonathan M.
