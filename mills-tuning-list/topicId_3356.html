It bugs me that he has these axes, but doesn't use <br>them to drop the other shoe and make a CD with them as the feature <br>tuning. If a Vai finally goes for it, it will advance the cause of other <br>tunings by a great amount..Hstick  PS Junko Shigeta and I had a marvelous <br>gig last nite in Denver, doing traditional Japanese music and music in 19 <br>and 34 tone eq..we had a good audience, and a lot of musicians showed <br>up...</div>
