There are <br>exceptions, such as a pentatonic scale played as a chord, where a meantone <br>tuning changes the three thirds from Pythagorean to near-just, without <br>giving up much consonance in the fifths. But yes, melody and harmony often <br>have contradictory implications for tuning.<br><br>>> Finally, consider the geometric series<br>>><br>>>  . .x^-9, x^-8, x^-7, x^-6, x^-5, x^-4, x^-3, x^-2, x^-1, x, x^2, x^3,<br>>> x^4, x^5, x^6, x^7, x^8, x^9, . . .<br>>><br>>> where x>0 and x does not equal 1. Whether the units of measurement are<br>>> string length or wavelength or time period, as above, or frequency, as <br>in<br>>> the 800:900:1000 Hz example, the result is the same: equal temperament!<br><br>>Alright.  I figured out how to use the geometric series shown above to<br>>acheive octave-repeating ET by supplying x with the nth root of two, where<br>n<br>>is the number of divisions/octave.  But I don't understand what you mean <br>by<br>>putting a series of integrally-related frequencies such as 800:900:1000 Hz<br>>into the equation.  If you apply the geometric series to a _single_ <br>frequency<br>>you get ET.  But I can't seem to get the 800:900:1000 Hz _series_ to make <br>ET,<br>>no matter what I do to it.<br><br>All I was saying is that if you use frequency units as your units of <br>measurement, the geometric series gives you equal temperament.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 22 May 1997 19:49 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07883; Thu, 22 May 1997 19:49:02 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 22 May 1997 19:49:02 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07871<br>Received: (qmail 13622 invoked from network); 22 May 1997 17:48:28 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 22 May 1997 17:48:28 -0000<br>Message-Id: <338434F1.7510@gold.tc.umn.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
