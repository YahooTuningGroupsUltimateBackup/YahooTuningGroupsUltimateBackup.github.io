Schulter&#x22; &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/1998 8:21:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Hello, there.<br><br>Recently Gary Morrison raised a very interesting question about how<br>different people perceive a major third at the Pythagorean or 3-limit<br>tuning of 81:64 (around 407.82 cents).<br><br>>   Using a related 3-limit interval as another example, I personally<br>> have never managed to attribute any intuitive meaning to 81:64.  To<br>> me it sounds like an off-5:4 much more than anything meaningful in<br>> itself.  It's just too complicated a pitch relationship very close<br>> to a vastly more obvious one.<br><br>Here I'd like to have a try at describing how an 81:64 feels to me in<br>some typical musical settings where I encounter it.<br><br>First, I might note that an 81:64 can take on different qualities<br>depending upon the timbre, also true to an extent of a 5:4 major<br>third, for example. Using a somewhat regal-like or crumhorn-like<br>registration (Yahama TX-802 preset voice A22, for the curious), I find<br>that an 81:64 major third can be quite "strident," but with a more<br>subdued organ-like registration (e.g. a combination of TX-802 voices<br>A17 "cello" and A23 "flute"), it can sound quite "sweet."<br><br>Generally, the medieval term _ditonus_ or "ditone" is intuitively<br>descriptive: this major third consists of two pure 9:8 whole-tones.<br><br>In polyphonic music of the 11th and 12th centuries, I feel this<br>"ditonal" quality in the very common cadence where two voices contract<br>from a major third to a unison, each moving by a whole-tone in<br>conjunct contrary motion. It's a kind of convergence or flowing<br>together, and an 81:64 nicely suits this process, making the major<br>third before a unison a bit more "complicated" and interesting.<br>Incidentally, someone has already observed on the Web that the beats<br>of an 81:64 add cadential interest before a unison, so this isn't<br>necessarily the most original observation <grin>.<br><br>Around 1200, as polyphony expands to three or four independent voices,<br>this major third also makes itself heard in cadences like this:<br><br>     d'    -- +204 --  e'<br> (702,294)         (702,702)<br>     b     -- -204 --  a<br>   (408)              (0)<br>     g     -- +204 --  a<br><br>Here, again, the contraction of the ditone to a unison by whole-tone<br>motion in both lower voices, complemented in this cadence by the<br>similar m3-5 resolution between the upper voices, has what I might<br>describe as a certain stately quality.<br><br>By the late 13th century to some extent, and in the 14th century, the<br>81:64 typically takes on a more "incisive" cadential character,<br>expanding to a fifth with one voice moving by a semitone and the other<br>by a whole tone. It's especially characteristic for the 81:64 to team<br>together with a 27:16 major sixth, expanding to fifth and octave<br>respectively:<br><br>     c#'   --  +90 --  d'<br> (906,498)         (1200,498)<br>     g#    --  +90 --  a<br>   (408)             (702)<br>     e     -- -204 --  d<br><br>How does this feel -- I would say "hot, passionate, intense,<br>expressive," with accidental inflections often required to make the<br>third and sixth major further underscoring the power of the cadence.<br><br>It's beautiful the way that a scale yielding pure fifths and fourths<br>also seems to lead just the right amount of tension to those major<br>thirds and sixths to really make this progression ideal. I once<br>compared its expansiveness in a poem to the Big Bang. <br><br>Of course, this isn't to say that 81:64 and 27:16 are the _only_<br>tunings that can "feel right" for this cadence. In a Xeno-Gothic<br>tuning, where the major third and major sixth can be made a<br>Pythagorean comma wider than usual (close to 9:7 and 12:7), this same<br>progression in certain timbres can have a very convincing "ring" for<br>me:<br><br>     c#'   --  +67 --  d'<br> (930,498)         (1200,498)<br>     g#    --  +67 --  a<br>   (430)             (702)<br>     e     -- -204 --  d<br><br>Here I'd describe the usual Pythagorean version with 81:64 and 27:16<br>as "classic," and this version as more "jazzy," although my sense of<br>"neo-Gothic jazzy" might not be the same as other people's <grin>.<br><br>Additionally, a sonority with an 81:64 often occurs in 14th-century<br>music as a kind of half-cadence, and the "classic" edge to this major<br>third emphasizes the musical message that this is a mild but<br>_unstable_ sonority, and that there's more to come. Of course, this is<br>a matter of _musical_ expectation that would hold in 12-tet or even<br>meantone: thirds are inconclusive in this style! However, that bit of<br>extra tension nicely adds emphasis to this point, and heightens my<br>sense of "a _partial_ repose" still seeking harmonic "perfection" and<br>moving toward what follows next.<br><br>>   There is another possible explanation though: Exactly opposite of<br>> Margo, I have almost no time whatsoever with 81:64, or 3-limit<br>> tunings in general.  Historically, I've been much more interested in<br>> the other end of the spectrum: 7s, 11s, 13s, and such.<br><br>Please let me admit that even when considering intervals such as 9:7<br>or 12:7, I tend to approach them from a kind of 3-limit viewpoint: "A<br>9:7 is sort of like a superactive 81:64 inviting expansion to a<br>fifth." Also, I may like the idea of combining 9:7 and 12:7 (or their<br>Xeno-Gothic approximations of 81:64-plus-comma and 27:16-plus-comma)<br>because the two ratios together give a pure 4:3 fourth between the<br>upper voices.<br><br>> In fact, I may even be able to count the total number of times I've<br>> intentionally confronted myself with 81:64 on my fingers and toes.<br>> If I were to listen to it more an intuitive meaning for it might<br>> become apparent.<br><br>Please let me, in turn, caution that I'm oriented to 81:64 in a Gothic<br>or neo-Gothic setting, both in performing and in composing or<br>improvising. This leaves open all kinds of new styles and applications<br>for this interval which might be quite different from either the<br>medieval tradition or from my musical experience largely based upon<br>it, however imperfectly transmitted across the centuries. I certainly<br>wouldn't want to leave the impression that Gothic music defines _the_<br>way to use an interval such as 81:64; it's just one possibility.<br><br>Of course, if the fact that this interval _has_ been used to make some<br>very impressive music encourages people to try using it now in ways<br>both old and new, then history and creativity may prove happy allies.<br><br>Most respectfully,<br><br>Margo Schulter<br>mschulter@value.net</div>
