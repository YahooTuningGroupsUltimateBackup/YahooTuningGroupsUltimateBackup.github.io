I think over all the swap<br>was a big success. It was a real pleasure to put this project together. It was<br>considerably more time and money consuming than I had expected, however. This<br>was the only drawback to doing this, otherwise it was great.<br><br>There was a large amount of material that I had been given to choose from.<br>Editting this thing was a little painful as I wish I could have put on alot<br>more material than the 90 minutes had allowed. There were all kinds of<br>considerations that played in deciding what finally went on the tape. I had to<br>balance between representing  Tuning List members fairly and representing an<br>array of tunings adequetly. I also took into consideration representing style<br>and types of performance. Of paramount importance in selecting the cuts was<br>musicality. I wanted to put together a tape that was a compilation of good<br>music. Of course this is subjective. So don't shoot if you didn't get your<br>favorite piece on. I tried to create a tape that flowed well and set each<br>piece up so that it would be heard in its best light.<br><br>I've played the tape for several people that have nothing to do with music<br>other than they listen to alot of it and the reviews have been overwhelmingly<br>favorable. This is great news, I think. It's something you can hand to someone<br>and say "look, see we're not just a bunch of wankers"!<br><br>The numeration on the liner notes is nothing less than bizarre. The reason for<br>this is that it was 1) done _real_ late at night  and 2) revised after the<br>intial printing of the liner notes and 3) I live in fear of the number 7, so<br>there is no track 7. It's alittle confusing but you're all smart dudes. I<br>trust you'll be able to wend your way through it.<br><br>and the play list is...<br><br>1) John Starrett "Dance of the Mermaids"<br>2) Neil Haverstick "Swing 19"<br>3) Denny Genovese and the Exotic Music Ensemble "Gypsy Dance"<br>4) Warren Burt "Almond Bread Harmonies II"<br>5) Denis Atadan "Times to Sprout"<br>6) Denis Atadan "The Usual 2020 Jam"    (don't worry folks they're short!)<br>7) Dead Silence<br>8) Elaine Walker "Lost Souls"<br>9) Randy Winchester excerpts from "Comets over Flatlands"<br>9a) Randy Winchester excerpts from "Comets over Flatlands"<br>10) Neil Haverstick  excerpt from " Microseconds"<br>11) Allan Strange  "Phoenix Rising"<br><br>SIDE B<br><br>12) Gary Morrison " A Different Drummer"<br>12a) Gary Morrison "Alternative Fuels"  (movement 3)<br>13) David Finnamore "Tales of the Bullroarer"<br>14) Denny Genovese and the Exotic Muisc Ensemble "Ancient Cultures"<br>15) Bruce Campbell "Enharmonic Canon"<br>16) Brian McLaren excerpt from "240 Piano Pieces"<br>16b) Warren Burt " Music for Microtonal Piano Sounds" part 6a<br>17) Bill Alves "Hiway 70"<br>18) Bill Sethares "Circle of Thirds"<br>19) Graham Breed "Fuckfeedback"<br>20) Paul Erlich "Fragment in 22-tone equal temperment"<br>21) Charles Lucy "Lelo Ledung"<br>22) Gary Morrison "Symphonietta for 7 Equal Frequency Steps" (movement 3)<br><br><br>These tapes should be getting to you within a few days. I hope you enjoy them.<br>As I've said it was a real pleasure to work on this project. Maybe we can do<br>it again in a year or two.<br><br>Hopefully these tapes will add a little dimension to little chats. and if<br>anyone has any complaints whatsoever please e-mail  John Starrett. John's the<br>busiest guy I know and I'm sure he'll give you're gripe full regard. ;-)<br><br><br>Best,<br><br>Denis Atadan<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com><br>Subject:  TUNING digest 1199<br>PostedDate:  07-10-97 15:31:06<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  07-10-97 15:30:50-07-10-97 15:30:51,07-10-97 14:29:24-07-10-97 14:29:25<br>DeliveredDate:  07-10-97 14:29:25<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256529.004A3783; Tue, 7 Oct 1997 15:30:38 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA09902; Tue, 7 Oct 1997 15:31:06 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 7 Oct 1997 15:31:06 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08590<br>Received: (qmail 28668 invoked from network); 7 Oct 1997 06:30:56 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 7 Oct 1997 06:30:56 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199710070927_MC2-2315-9456@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
