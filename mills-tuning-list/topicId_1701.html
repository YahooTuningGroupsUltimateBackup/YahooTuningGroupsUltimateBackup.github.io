(as a fifth <br>> and an octave above) or close on the chain of fourths <br>> and fifths.<br><br>Saying "usually related to..." is not a sufficient<br>specification. <br><br>> I need to get a LucyTuned guitar and find the <br>> notenames and pitches for you. <br><br>How is it that you don't already know the pitches of <br>the ghosttone sequence for which you claim to have a <br>better model? <br><br>> >When you say "at fret...B" do you mean only a single<br>> >fret or all the frets which produce B's?<br>> <br>> I was initially referring to the fret in the first <br>> octave i.e. II fret on your 'A' string.<br><br>So the other frets which produce B's don't represent <br>ghosttone positions?<br><br>> On the spiral of fourths and fifths.<br>> As far as I recall (retest needed) on 'A' string.<br>> Loudest is at octave (midpoint of string);<br><br>Where does an octave fit into a sequence of fourths<br>and fifths?
