Here's my 2 cents-worth, if you will.<br><br>1)  When everything in a piece is justly tuned within 2 cents or so, the<br>blend is so thorough that individual melodic lines are in danger of losing<br>their identity.  Too much homogeneity.  This can be remedied to a certain<br>extent by carefully using contrasting timbres between parts.  However, a more<br>musically useful solution can be to give the melody instrument, and any other<br>part where its movement is melodically important, the freedom to use pitch<br>inflections so that the attack phase is "out of tune" enough to provide the<br>distinction of its part, then falls back into just tune.  Psychologically,<br>the listener can continue to "hear" the distinct note and its timbre even<br>after its tone has blended into the harmony.<br><br>2)  On a related note (oops!), when too many tones are representing too many<br>partials of a given fundamental at once, the parts can completely lose their<br>identity.  I tried making a chord once that used the first 32 partials of a<br>fundamental tone (my synth is 32-note polyphonic, so there ya go).  It didn't<br>sound like a chord at all - it sounded like one humongous note.  A very<br>powerful sound in its own right, like an orch hit in a way, but not providing<br>any possibility of polyphonic function of the individual parts.  Reminded of<br>the Borg on Star Track (g).  This technique appears to be an excellent<br>sound-design tool, by the way.  Try it with "wide" sounds (pitch-wise) like<br>string-section or choir samples.  Soundtrack city!<br><br>To summarize, the choice between just and non-just tuning could be seen as an<br>opportunity to strike a balance between the individual freedom of each part,<br>and a sense of "community" and cooperation between the parts.  Not trying to<br>start any political arguments here!<br><br>David J.
