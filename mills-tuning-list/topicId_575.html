Psych. 10 (1940)149-156) I cannot say that the result comes as a<br>surprise.  Many years ago I was faced with a small-interval set of<br>strings, and I quickly found that the tunes which interested me were<br>all within a major third.  Similar effects have occurred since, and in<br>my last completed (OK, only completed) microtuned piece the parts I<br>really like are the melodic fragments with very small intervals.  This<br>does not seem to correspond with the JT systems or the various 12ET<br>approximations.  I want to listen to more notes, and closer notes.<br><br>Talking to Rick Boulanger earlier this year he suggested that as so<br>much information in speech is conveyed by small inflections, it was<br>not unexpected that small intervals could be so inviting.<br><br>Still, I like pickled okra (mathematical joke) and various other<br>unpopular things.<br><br>==John<br><br>Received: from sun4nl.NL.net [193.78.240.12] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 16 Jul 1996 14:57 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by sun4nl.NL.net with SMTP<br>	id AA12180 (5.65b/CWI-3.3); Tue, 16 Jul 1996 14:17:42 +0200<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id FAA27753; Tue, 16 Jul 1996 05:16:19 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 16 Jul 1996 05:16:19 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960716120119_101610.3043_JHP90-4@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
