[snip] Nothing special about JI.<br><br><br>But there is something special about JI as far as modulatory effects go:<br>its consistency level is infinite.  72tET is only level 2 consistent at the<br>11 limit.  Any modulation in JI following a chain of 3 or more 11/8's will<br>no longer be represented consistently in 72tET.<br><br>I must confess I do not know if such a modulation appears in Partch's<br>music.  Careful listening would tell.  Such a modulation is not possible in<br>the 11 limit tonality diamond as such.  But Partch was not tied to the<br>diamond as such.  He added secondary tonalities as he needed them, and I'm<br>sure he would have no problem with modulating the entire diamond by some<br>interval.<br><br><br>Carl</div>
