Does anybody out there know what I'm<br>>talking about?  Who was the performer, and has he or she toured this stuff<br>>or put it on a published recording?<br><br>I don't know anything about this particular performance, but the repertory<br>is fairly well-known to EM keyboardists.  Definitely, as far as recordings<br>go, the one to hear is Alan Curtis' on Nuova Era 7177<br>http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/cds/nuo7177.htm<br><br>Todd McComb<br>mccomb@medieval.org<br><br><br>BTW, I was re-reading Bosanquet's 1876 book "An Elementary Treatist on <br>Musical Intervals and Temperament" in which he describes his famous<br>generalized keyboard. What caught my attention was a section where he<br>calculates musical logarithms, in this case the semitone measure of<br>ratios (equivalent to cents divided by 100). Bosanquet computes his own<br>logs from a series expansion approximation rather than using tables<br>and implies that the proofs of such expansions were commonly given in<br>19th century trig books. Anyway, a longer discussion which illuminated<br>the method of Ellis, which I posted to the tuning list last Spring (or<br>so). The method appears less to have been pulled out of thin air than<br>it does in Ellis's exposition in Helmholtz.<br><br>I, for one, would like to see David Feldman's table of "isotempered" <br>interval pairs. Alas, I have an old, small screen Mac and would need<br>the reformatted or a hardcopy version.<br><br>By using Brun's algorithm, it was easy to show that Feldman is correct<br>in that the series of relations of the degrees of the fifth Q to those<br>in the octave T: Q\T ~3\5, 4\7, 7\12, 10\17, 17\29, 24\41, 31\53,<br>55\94 corresponds to the number of degrees of the 13/9 in the <br>equal divisions of the 15/8.<br><br>One might describe this as series of compressed octaves which in<br>which the relative size of the 13/9 corresponds to the relative<br>size of the 3/2 in the original series of octaval ET's. <br><br>I also played around with another, but related, problem of finding <br>optimal ET's for sets of all 4 numbers, in this case 2/1, 15/8, 3/2 <br>and 13/9.  Using Viggo Brun's version of the euclidean algorithm, I got <br>the  following N-tone ET's: 10, 19, 24, 43, 53, 72, 125, 178...(only <br>those which distinguish all 4 ratios are listed). Selmer's version <br>oscillates a bit, but finds 20, 21, 12, 26, 34, 46, 33, 41, 54, 75, <br>62, 87,  162. Pipping's ramified version gave erratic results, though <br>it works fine for 3 terms.<br><br><br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 4 Jan 1997 20:11 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01169; Sat, 4 Jan 1997 20:13:52 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01167<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA12790; Sat, 4 Jan 1997 11:13:49 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 4 Jan 1997 11:13:49 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009ADE03C0567240.0557@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4513 href="#4513">ðŸ”—</a>Johnny Reinhard &#x3C;reinhard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/1997 11:40:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Manuel is correct the flat fifths are: C-G, G-D, D-A, B-F#<br><br>(Circling in the back of my mind was the fact that F Major is the most<br>"just" of the major keys.)<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@ios.com<br><br>On Sat, 4 Jan 1997, Manuel Op de Coul wrote:<br><br>> > Translation of the Werckmeister treatise of 1691<br>> > remains available only in archaic Thuringian German (and in an unpublished<br>> No that's the original.<br>> <br>> Johnny's description of Werckmeister III is incorrect.
