It<br>concerns a scale with the following properties:<br><br>(1) There are seven pitch classes in the system,<br>which I will number ascending from 1 to 7. Octave<br>equivalence is assumed, but may actually vary to<br>create beating for coloristic or perhaps a<br>vibrato-like effect to cover the difference of the<br>tuning from a small-number-ratio just intonation.<br><br>(2) There are three distinct pentatonic 'keys',<br>beginning at degrees 1 (12 456), 2 (23 567) and<br>5 (56 123) of the seven tone system, that is to<br>say, at 'fifths' apart.<br><br>(3) the intervals 1-5, 2-6 and 3-7 are recognizable<br>as 'fifths' (let's say +/- 25 cents of a 3/2) and<br>are used as dyads.<br><br>(4) 5-2', 6-3', and 4-1' _may_ be recognizeable as<br>fifths. The interval 7-4' is not used as a dyad.<br><br>(5) the intervals 1-2, 2-3 and 5-6 are between 80<br>and 190 cents apart.<br><br>(6) the intervals 1-2-3, 4-5-6, and 5-6-7<br>encompass an interval between an 8/7 and a 6/5.<br><br>(7) the interval 1-2 is smaller than 2-3 and the<br>interval 5-6 is smaller than 6-7. (The relationship<br>between the intervals 4-5 and 5-6 is not so fixed).<br><br>I am interested in what kinds of tunings others can<br>come up with that will meet the above specifications<br>in order to find out if the set of specifications<br>above is sufficient and necessary. Anyone game to try?<br>===============<br><br>Daniel,<br><br>This sounds like a generalized definition of Javanese pelog.  If so, I<br>would question condition (1).  In some if not most pelogs I've studied, 2-6<br>can be more than 50 cents narrower than a 3/2.  It seems generally to be<br>slightly flatter than the 1-5 and 3-7 dyads, even though it is, in Javanese<br>theory, the same interval.  I also question whether 1-2 is always smaller<br>than 2-3, and whether 4-6 is always or even usually larger than an 8/7.<br>The other conditions seem to me accurate constraints on pelog.<br><br>Parenthetically, re condition (2): as I'm sure you know, 4 is a subsidiary<br>tone in pelog lima, an alternate to 3; and some gendhing use all 7 tones;<br>so the boundaries between the three "keys" are not strict.  In KNOWING<br>MUSIC, MAKING MUSIC, Ben Brinner writes, "The difference between pieces in<br>pelog lima and pelog nem is so obscure that some musicians ignore the fuzzy<br>boundary and group them together as pathet bem."<br><br>But to your question.  Only conditions (3), (5), (6), & (7) put hard<br>constraints on the scale construction.  Satisfying them keeps the pitches<br>in these ranges:<br><br>pitch  cents range  conditions met<br>1      0<br>2      80-157       (80-190 cts above 1 and less than half 1-3)<br>3      231-316      (231-316 cts above 1)<br>4      439-684      (231-316 cts below 6)<br>5      675-725      (675-725 cts above 1)<br>6      755-875      (675-725 cts above 2 and less than half 5-7)<br>7      906-1041     (231-316 cts above 5)<br><br>This is not to say that any and all pitches in these ranges will satisfy<br>the conditions.  Condition (7) must be met for pitches 2 and 6 after fixing<br>pitches 3 and 7.<br><br>Are you looking specifically for small-number ratios?<br><br>To guarantee a functional pelog, I wonder if you might also need to<br>constrain the 6-7 interval (already >80 cents, but usually a good deal<br>larger), and possibly the 3-4 (usually at least twice as large as 4-5).<br><br>--Carter</div><h3><a id=7508 href="#7508">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>4/19/1998 5:13:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>I have an older Mac 660AV using only Quicktime 2.5.
