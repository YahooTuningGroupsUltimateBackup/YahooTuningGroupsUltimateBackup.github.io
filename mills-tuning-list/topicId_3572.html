(I mentioned<br>notation somewhere in this discussion -- can't find it now.)<br><br>> 3) It allows ambiguous chords.<br>><br>>  I remember you (Monzo, TD1403) agreeing that the chord<br>>  below only works in meantone.  Did you really mean to imply<br>>  (above) that this isn't a use for temperament?<br>><br>>                 A---E---B<br>>                      \ / \<br>>                       G---D---A<br><br>The chord referred to was originally given as an example by<br>Paul Erlich in TD1400:<br>><br>> [Example] 3. 6/9 (meaning root, maj. 3rd, perf. 5th. maj. 6th, <br>> maj. 9th)<br>><br>> Here, we have a chain of 5ths, but also a major 3rd and two minor<br>> thirds. If all these intervals are to be consonant, no just<br>> interpretation will really do. This chord requires a tuning where <br>> the 80:81 syntonic comma vanishes.<br><br>I replied in TD1403 that I agreed with this statement, and I<br>suppose you are at least partly correct in pigeonholing Erlich's<br>broader definition of "a tuning where the 80:81 syntonic comma<br>vanishes" as "meantone".<br><br>I represented this chord with a lattice diagram that would look<br>like this in your version:<br><br>                         B<br>                        / \<br>                       G---D---A---E---B<br><br>with the _caveat_ that the A and E a syntonic comma lower would<br>probably also be implied, but I didn't have space to include them.<br>That diagram would look like:<br>                  A---E---B<br>                       \ / \<br>                        G---D---A---E---B<br><br>so again, your citation is basically, though not literally,<br>correct.<br><br>Anyway, the opening phrase of my posting (from TD1415) which<br>you quoted and to which you replied, was: "the only reasons I can<br>see for accepting any equal-temperament...".  I did specify that I<br>was talking about _equal_ temperaments, not well or meantone.<br><br>Of course, you do have a good point though.  I guess this one is<br>a personal decision -- I prefer chords that are _not_  ambiguous.<br>There's already so much numerical interplay possible in JI, who<br>needs notes that are "close but no cigar"?  Chords can be tuned<br>in JI with a variety of ratios that are close enough to a "target"<br>that many of these ambiguities can be explored rationally.<br><br>> 4) You can't be bothered to work out the ratios.<br>><br>>  As implied in the Schoenberg paragraph, most<br>>  composers don't want to worry about ratios.  They want a<br>>  resourceful scale to compose in.  Give them a meantone, and<br>>  they'll find good harmonies in it.  They might even give<br>>  them to musicians who'll render them in JI.  Do you really<br>>  expect the composer to sit and work out where the commas<br>>  should be?<br><br>My dissatisfaction with working directly with ratios was exactly<br>the stimulus which caused me to notate ratios as prime factors with<br>exponents.  To me, this, especially when graphed on lattice<br>diagrams, is by far the simplest way to accurately represent<br>JI harmonic concepts and pitches.  I usually find it useful to<br>describe temperaments this way too, since often composers who<br>favor temperaments _do_  wish to imply JI harmonies.<br><br>> Where were you when Gregg Gibson was stomping all over<br>> the list? <br><br>Who's Gregg Gibson?  I've been receiving the Tuning Digest since<br># 1314.  (Email me something -- I'd like to see it).<br><br>> Then again, perhaps Schoenberg had a piano.<br><br>I took this as an attempt at humor.  As I suggested, there are far<br>more profound reasons why Schoenberg so enthusiastically<br>embraced the 12-Eq scale.  He intuitively understood much more<br>about rational harmonic concepts than his limited mathematically<br>ability demonstrates; and this is important because Schoenberg's<br>compositions and theory have had a huge impact on a lot of<br>this century's music, both academic and commercial.<br><br> <br>   Joseph L.
