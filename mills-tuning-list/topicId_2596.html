Zazeela's light sculptures have<br>invariably, teasingly refused to surrender their<br>entire secret to photographic reprodution, so much<br>do they depend on the retinal impact of activated<br>photons in real time and so much do they exploit,<br>in ways analagous to Young's techniques, the creation<br>of visual combination tones and an accumulation of<br>after-images."<br><br>-- Sandy McCroskey, 1/1, The Journal of the Just Intonation Network<br><br><br>"Young's newest sine-tone sculpture shimmers<br>and swirls as you walk around the room and,<br>amazingly, when you freeze, it does too. Stay<br>at least long enough to stare at Zazeela's<br>Imagic Light and Ruine Window, which will<br>imprint your retina with blues and<br>purples you haven't felt before."<br><br>-- Kyle Gann, The Village Voice<br><br><br>"The visitor with an acute ear can actually<br>'play' the room like an instrument: explore<br>the sound close to the wall, close to the floor,<br>in the corner, or just standing still. Or lie<br>on the floor and allow the sound to float you<br>into heaven, slide you into hell, or transport<br>you wherever you want to go. See if you agree<br>with those who call Young's sound sculpture<br>a precursor of ambient music.<br><br>Zazeela's light installation, "Imagic Light,"<br>offers an intriuging complement to the sound,<br>even though it is equally effective when viewed<br>in silence. Using pairs of colored lights and<br>suspended aluminum mobiles cut out in calligraphic<br>shapes, Zazeela explores the relationship between<br>object and shadow, making the tangible intangible,<br>and vice versa. Enjoy the installation for its<br>mesmerizing beauty, or try to analyze how the<br>different colors are achieved, how the mobiles<br>create the resulting shadows, or perspective<br>the infinite number of symmetrical patterns in the<br>room."<br><br>-- David Farneth, Metrobeat<br><br><br>Music Eternal Light Art<br><br><br><br><br>*    David Beardsley<br>*    DMB5561719@aol.com<br>*<br>*    virtual dream house monitor<br>*                         for the MELA Foundation<br>*<br>*    http://www.virtulink.com/mela/main.htm<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
