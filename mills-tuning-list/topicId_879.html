And, it is sometimes necessary to <br>modulate tunings within a hymn.  One would, therefore, like an instrument <br>where tunings can be stored and easily be evoked.  It would also be necessary <br>to record a given melody in memory.<br><br>A minimum of 6 different tunings are needed for the majority of the <br>compositions, though a few additional tunings are necessary for some of the <br>more unusual pieces.  Usually only two voices (rarely three) are used, so   <br>extended polyphonic ability is not needed.<br><br>I'd gladly respond to any additional question needed to help in identifying <br>a synthesizer(s) which would meet these requirements.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Polychronios Moniodis<br>Ypsilanti, MI<br>upb_moniodis@emuvax.emich.edu<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 12 Sep 1996 23:45 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29230; Thu, 12 Sep 1996 23:47:09 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29187<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id OAA05355; Thu, 12 Sep 1996 14:47:07 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 12 Sep 1996 14:47:07 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9609121754.A10445-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
