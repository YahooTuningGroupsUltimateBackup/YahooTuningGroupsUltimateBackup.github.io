It's called triaxial because it can be constructed<br>with three axes as 120 degrees (3's, 5's and 6/5-5/3's). Three-D graphs<br>or their planar projections can be constructed as a centered triangular<br>graph or as a more common rectilinear type with the 7's axis at about<br>30 degrees. David Doty in his JI Primer, Carter Scholz (including Ji Calc),<br>Paul Erlich, Erv Wilson in his writings, etc. have all used such <br>lattices and higher homologs.<br><br>--John<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 2 Apr 1997 22:47 METZ<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01562; Wed, 2 Apr 1997 22:47:58 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01560<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id MAA11471; Wed, 2 Apr 1997 12:46:21 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 2 Apr 1997 12:46:21 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95.970402121307.13732A-100000@equinox><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
