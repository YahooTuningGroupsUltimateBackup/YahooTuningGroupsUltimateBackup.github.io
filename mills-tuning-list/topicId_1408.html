Perhaps this was not exactly the right question,<br>and it should rather be: why is there a preference for an infill that<br>leaves a gap at top (i.e. 6-8 is left unfilled by 7)? Could there be an<br>explaination that does not go into supposed numerological properties of the<br>number 7? <br> <br>The best explaination of the infill question I have come up with is that<br>the infill is heirarchic, following the harmonic series: an octave infill<br>adds the fifth (2-3-4) and the next infill in of that fifth, not of the<br>octave (4-5-6-8), and the next infill (theoretically) would be of the third<br>(8-9-10-12-16)(which can be heard as a stable chord).<br><br>It is perhaps trivial to note that these infills are freshman sums.<br><br>There seems in this procedure to be a kind of equilibrium building, in that<br>the infill of the lowest interval counteracts the harmonic series effect of<br>increasingly smaller intervals at top. Perhaps this spacing equilibrium can<br>partially account for the prefered use of triads in the resolving position<br>of tonal cadences.<br><br>This procedure inverted appears to be effective for subharmonic sonorities<br>as well.<br><br>Now, if we would prefer to use 12th equivence instead of octave<br>equivalence, how might our infill procedure change? One immediate<br>possibility comes to mind: maintain the regular harmonic series and the<br>infill procedure will be very similar to the octave version 1-3, 1-2-3,<br>2-3-4-6, 4-5-6-8-12.  <br><br>And for kicks, here is a version for 7/4 equivalence: 4-7, 8-11-14,<br>16-19-22-28, 32-35-38-44-56<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 20 Dec 1996 11:26 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13385; Fri, 20 Dec 1996 11:28:38 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13387<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id CAA16733; Fri, 20 Dec 1996 02:28:35 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 20 Dec 1996 02:28:35 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009AD1F0923F01C0.DF58@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4394 href="#4394">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/1996 9:51:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>As for why there's a historical preference for using triadic rather than<br>seventh-chord fills within an octave's span, I think that that's pretty<br>much historical.

''<br><br>Yes, but this still begs the question of why this particular preference<br>appeared and not others. I was trying to argue from first principles about<br>the infill phenomenon using a spacing model, not an intonational model (for<br>which Pythagorean and 5-limit just intonations would provide a familiar and<br>convincing argument for western music through the early baroque). For later<br>music, where sonorities akin to 4-5-6-7 become common place, it is striking<br>how these are left in the _dissonant_ category and required to _resolve_.<br>Even vernacular musics tend not to end on seventh chords. Either this is<br>evidence of a deep conditioning from common practice music, or there is<br>some other mechanism at work.  Possibilities which spring immediately to<br>mind include (1) a problem with ratios of seven (or their tolerable<br>approximations), or (2) a spacing function (which I have called variously<br>"compacting" or "optimizing"). Any other ideas?<br><br>Another possiblity - and one purely from an intonational standpoint - is<br>that the ET approximation is bad enough to shove the seventh into a<br>_dissonant_ category and to demand resolution. In this case, however, the<br>resolutions of seventh chords occuring in real, existing Just intoned<br>musics - chorales or Barbershop quartets - retain the avoidance of sevenths<br>in final chords (except for special effects). Is this just conditioning<br>from the the familiar temperament? Does anyone know of a way to test this?<br><br>(Unfortunately, music that I am familiar with using justly intoned seventh<br>chords (Partch, Johnston, Young, Leedy, my own) is often highly ambiguous<br>about the whole issue of _resolution_. I do detect some tendency to respect<br>harmonic series spacing in the voice leading, but this is as yet more of an<br>impression than an established statistical fact).   <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 27 Dec 1996 19:19 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03727; Fri, 27 Dec 1996 19:21:56 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03723<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id KAA26411; Fri, 27 Dec 1996 10:21:53 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 27 Dec 1996 10:21:53 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612271321_MC2-DEE-EFC5@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4418 href="#4418">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/1996 11:24:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> Yes, but this still begs the question of why this particular preference<br>> appeared and not others.

Once people<br>became convinced that building chords in thirds was the way to go, they<br>started with smaller stacks of diatonic thirds and later progressed to<br>larger ones.  <br><br>   In other words, it may just be a matter of "well, that's just how it<br>happened" more than there being really clear reasons.

In the dwelling of this one child was placed an instrument <br>designed with the potential to produce an almost limitless range of <br>timbres and tunings, and to be easily programmable. <br><br>As this child grew, he discovered<br>the instrument and began playing around on it with no external <br>guidance and no preconceived notions of what it was or what<br>should be done with it.

Occasionally, a rare <br>one would find the imagination to suppose that there were<br>something beyond the small world he knew and would effect escape.<br>The child in the story is one such person. As a young man,<br>he escapes. After wandering dissoriented and with no idea<br>of how to meet his own basic needs, he ends up in some local <br>bar where an old out of tune acoustic piano collects dust in <br>the corner. The young man sees people, but doesn't know how<br>to relate to them or perhaps even what they are. They <br>don't recognize him and after their initial greetings are met <br>with a confused stare from the young man think him <br>an idiot, and leave him alone. He <br>finds the piano, and begins plunking all the notes. He <br>quickly learns what all the (out of tune) pitches are and<br>begings playing them in such a way as to make the people in<br>the bar turn around and be mesmerized by such unusual and<br>acute beauty. Some of them start to cry without knowing why.<br><br>He wanders more. With each hour on the outside, impressions<br>from radios and other raw noise of the culture begins to <br>change him. <br><br>Soon, his absence from the dwelling is noticed and he is<br>persued and caught and returned to his old small world. <br>His brief experience outside has infected his creativity.<br>People listening in notice strains of familiar melodies<br>creeping into his improvisations, imitations of vehicle<br>sounds, and other recognizable noises. <br><br>I think he escapes one more time and is caught again. <br><br>His priceless <br>purity of imagination is tainted.
