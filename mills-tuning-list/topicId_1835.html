Why is it that the Moon always keeps one face turned to us? <br>I've long thought that seemed sort of odd. What sort of math is at work, <br>on a very basic level, to make that happen, and why? Is that common with <br>Moons in general, or is Earth an exception? It seems to me that it makes <br>more sense if the two spheres were off a bit, so to speak, and that the <br>Moon would gradually show all of it's surface. Any ideas? Maybe things <br>like this relate to scales and harmonies as well. Of course, then one can <br>think about all of the different things happening with the orbits of the <br>planets and stars as well, and what sort of great BALANCE does this <br>create, and again all the limitless numbers of frequencies from the <br>bazillions of waves pouring through the great expanse of the Universe,<br>how do they affect us teensy little bodies of flesh and bone as they zip <br>ceaselessly through our minds and cells?<br><br>Incidentally, I want to congratulate John Schneider for such a great job <br>with Microfest in LA on March 8. He pulled together a really diverse <br>bunch of folks from the field of alternate tunings, and helped to make it <br>a really wonderful event. I was greatful to be invited, and to meet and <br>hang with some of the great names in tuning ideas. We got great press in <br>the LA Times, and I believe one is coming out in the weekly as well. I <br>think we need more of these events, as they seem to be catching on. It's <br>not that hard to get a few hundred bucks for airline tickets together, do <br>some press work (and so far the press has really dug the ones we've done <br>so far...gives them something new to write about), and boom, instant <br>Microwhatever. I think it's the best way to make a case to people about <br>"Microtones", let them HEAR it, instead of only read about theories in <br>books...so, here's to more of 'em...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 13 Mar 1997 22:14 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11368; Thu, 13 Mar 1997 22:14:16 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11363<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id NAA07447; Thu, 13 Mar 1997 13:10:47 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 13 Mar 1997 13:10:47 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95q.970313145522.29733A-100000@library.wustl.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
