He was a master of the very <br>microtonal Kirana tradition and greatly influenced Terry Riley and <br>Lamont Young  as well as other musicians interested in just intonation <br>in singing. <br><br>In addition to performing and teaching in India, he taught at UCSD <br>in 1973 and was a visiting professor of music at Mills College from <br>1973 to 1984.<br><br>--John  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 18 Jun 1996 02:17 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id RAA25821; Mon, 17 Jun 1996 17:17:09 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 17 Jun 1996 17:17:09 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.960617174554.41121A-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3133 href="#3133">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/28/1996 4:10:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Ladies and Gentlemen-<br>        I have been away from the computer for a few days due to the<br>wedding of a son and a promise to a wife to paint the house. Yesterday I<br>got back to work and set out to resolve a problem that consumed about 3<br>hours of time since I first hooked up the CD-Recordable and the to the<br>Adaptec SCSI card---my Gateway 2000 computer could not find the SCSI<br>device.<br>        Thursday-after 4 hours of trying every combination of available IRQ <br>and base address, screaming at the computer, Adaptec and Gateway <br>technicians, we determine that the problem is in the advanced BIOS of the <br>Gateway machine-it is set to plug & play and assigns IRQs as it sees fit. <br>I reset the BIOS to user setup and the SCSI drive is recognized! <br>(I am not a genuine computer geek--I just use the computer for scienfic <br>number crunching and visual simulations, so if you must call me on my poor <br>use of DOS and hardware terminology, please do so in a gentle fashion).<br>	I am finally ready to record. I have three CD-R software <br>packages-Correl, EZ CD-R and one that came with the CD-R player. I try <br>the EZ CD-R software first. A CD-R can be recorded over several sessions,<br>which is a good thing, as standard CD audio takes about 10 megabytes per <br>minute and a hard disk would be quite full from an hour of music. After <br>each session, a box is clicked to close the session. When the disk has <br>all the material recorded (data, programs, music, images or multimedia) <br>you click the close disk box and the CD-R can finally be read. I have <br>several disks with test data that have not yet been closed, so in the <br>interest of economy, I first try recording DOS from my hard drive to the <br>disk. It takes about ten seconds to put DOS in the appropriate format and <br>about three minutes to burn it on the disk. I close the disk (about one <br>minute) and I have my first CD ROM. I test it, and it works! The machine <br>reads DOS from the CD-R!  <br>	Now for music. Each of the three software packages has a test <br>feature that simulates writing a disk by doing everything but turning on <br>the laser. As I don't have a whole disk worth of material to record, and <br>special preparation is required to mix sound and other sources, I cannot <br>use one of the partially recorded test discs. To avoid wasting a new <br>disc, I decide to test write some wave files. I take several Monty Python <br>sound bytes, sing a few bars into WINDAT (it came with my $50 sound card) <br>and make a cue sheet. Piece of cake. It takes about five minutes. Just <br>drag and drop WAVE files into the CD-R icon. I test record, and it is a <br>success!<br>	Except for the 7 wasted hours trying to determine why the machine <br>couldn't locate the SCSI device (ain't DOS machines grand?), running the <br>CD-R has been a breeze. Each of the three pieces of software is easy and <br>intuitive to use, and there were no glitches recording a real DOS CD and <br>the test sound CD. All that remains is to do a real sound session, which <br>I will report on next time.<br>	By the way, Sony now is pricing a fully functional CD-R drive at $600.<br><br>John Starrett  <br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 29 Jun 1996 04:20 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id TAA10372; Fri, 28 Jun 1996 19:20:41 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 28 Jun 1996 19:20:41 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01540701adfa43319cfb@[165.227.35.74]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
