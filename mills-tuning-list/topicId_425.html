Scala is<br>>written in Ada, which makes the program very easily portable, but sad<br>>enough there is no decent Ada compiler for the Macintosh, at least not<br>>at the moment. So, the more people tell to Apple to fund and support<br>>development of an Ada compiler, like it funded porting of Linux, the<br>>better.<br><br>There is a possible intermediate solution- certain PowerMacs are "DOS<br>compatible", meaning they have a card with a 486 of unknown speed running in<br>parallel to the PowerPC.  You can switch from DOS/Windows mode to Mac mode<br>and back with command-enter, and in fact start a job running under DOS and<br>switch back to the Mac while it's running.  My Dad has one of these machines<br>and we managed to get a Windows-based mapping program and the Ensoniq ESP2<br>assembler working on it just fine.  Scala should work too since its I/O is<br>pretty generic.  Of course if you don't happen to have a Mac with this<br>option it wouldn't do you any good, but from what I hear it's a not uncommon<br>machine around academic computing centers and studios.<br><br>Steve Curtin<br>Ensoniq Corp<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 12 Mar 1996 16:15 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA21325; Tue, 12 Mar 1996 07:14:07 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 12 Mar 1996 07:14:07 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01510100ad6b4398799e@[206.119.10.100]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2664 href="#2664">ðŸ”—</a>alves@osiris.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)</h3><span>3/12/1996 9:06:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>A friend of mine and an excellent composer, Frederick Lesemann, did a piece<br>on a Moog Model 12 modular synth back in the 1970s based on "pi-octaves."<br>As I recall, these were based on the 12th root of pi by stretching<br>(amplifying) the control voltage to the oscillators. A very nice piece,<br>though I haven't heard it in years, and it was never recorded commercially.<br>I don't think Rick has had any other special interest in alternate tunings<br>since then. Another friend described the piece as "very tuneful" and said<br>that he walked away whistling the melodies. However, the moment he heard<br>any 12-TET afterwards, his ear "snapped back" and he was thereafter unable<br>to recall the pi-octave melodies.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
