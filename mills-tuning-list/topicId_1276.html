That said, Maestro McLaren really, *really*<br>stretches the definition of incredulity; odd, since he is such a dictionary<br>literalist.  Did anyone else notice, in the last post, this lovely<br>tripartite sequence of statements:<br><br>>In the previous post, I mentioned that <br>>the scientific method is crucially important in<br>>microtonality.  As Aristotle points out in the Rhetoric:<br>>"A speech has two parts.  You must state you case,<br>>and you must prove it.  You cannot either state your<br>>case and omit to prove it, or prove it without<br>>having first stated it."  This is clearly an alien<br>>concept to Eric Lyon and Greg Taylor: but to the<br>>rest of us, it's obvious.<br><br>.. a little later:<br><br>>In fact, authorities, as history shows, are usually <br>>*wrong.*<br>>Aristotle is a superb example.<br><br>.. and finally:<br><br>>So please, people, stop quoting authority figures.<br>>I don't give a fat rat's ass what Milton Babbitt<br>>or John Cage or Bach or Beethoven or the King of<br>>Siam or Allah or Boddhisatva says, this means <br>>*NOTHING* to me.<br><br>Excellent: Brian leads off his lecture with a supporting quote from Mr. A,<br>proceeds to later undermine Mr. A's credibility, and then admonishes others<br>for quoting people like Mr. A.  And he is on *our* collective posteriors<br>about a (perceived) inability to offer reasoned and logical discourse; this<br>is far richer than that piece of pumpkin/apple butter pie (with real<br>whipped cream!) I just finished.<br><br>Sooooo, I am sorry that I've been too busy up until now, but I absolutely<br>will call Sonic Arts Gallery tomorrow morn and get an appointment with the<br>boy.  I hope he gives good meeting...<br><br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br>*--------------------------------------------------------------------*<br>  Jonathan M.
