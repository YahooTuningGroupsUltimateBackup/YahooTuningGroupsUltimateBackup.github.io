The quantum computer<br>would use particle energy state/positions to encode information. <br>I can't pretend to understand all the details yet, but if this<br>really works is could be the scientific breakthrough of the<br>century, IMHO.<br><br>A day or so later I read Brian's post on psychoacoustics, and was<br>struck by the idea that the brain might be a quantum mechanical<br>computer.  This would explain many anomalies about how such an<br>apparently slow system could consistently outperform silicon<br>which seemingly operates hundreds or thousands of times faster. <br>It could also mean that far from a simple on/off coding for each<br>neuron, that each exchange of an ion between two neurons could<br>encode a multibit packet of information.<br><br>If you've read this far, remember that I tried to warn you.<br><br>Marion<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 30 Sep 1995 17:21 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA11855; Sat, 30 Sep 1995 08:21:12 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 30 Sep 1995 08:21:12 -0700<br>Message-Id:  <9509300820.aa01733@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3315 href="#3315">ðŸ”—</a>COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>7/26/1996 7:11:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Marion says:<br>> It seems to me that for any finite number of integers, there are an infinity <br>> of generating functions.<br><br>To the contrary. As I said a generating function does NOT have the<br>numbers of the sequence as a result. It depends on the numbers. It <br>is similar to the Z-transform. The generating function is unique, for<br>a finite or infinite number of integers. Of course a function can be<br>notated in an infinite number of ways but that doesn't alter the<br>function. <br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 26 Jul 1996 19:18 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id KAA01817; Fri, 26 Jul 1996 10:18:53 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 26 Jul 1996 10:18:53 -0700<br>Message-Id: <1.5.4b12.32.19950726170952.0067fc38@interlinx.qc.ca><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
