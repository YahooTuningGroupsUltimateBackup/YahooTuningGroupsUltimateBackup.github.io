That would be a<br>shame. His characterizations of what people within the<br>discipline think a canon *is* was such that I find myself wondering<br>if this isn't another of those things he's managed to confabulate in<br>the absence of much contact with those horrible academics. I<br>personally know of no one who's at all engaged with the material<br>who'd claim that the "canon" is a collection of works whose<br>relative positions or even whose inclusion is some kind of fixed<br>and ahistorical list; Maybe if we went back as far as Cleanth<br>Brooks and the "new critics" of the late 40s, we could find<br>something this clumsy. Perhaps the business of actually talking<br>with real academics is less fun than demonizing them and erecting<br>straw persons to burn for epistolary amusement.<br><br>I think that the reality of the situation is both more complex and<br>more interesting. In the course of the discussions which center around<br>those musical and literary types who've chosen to assail the much<br>older Modernist notions of a canon, what's emerged is considerably<br>more nuanced than the guidance system of Brian's last missal would<br>lead one to believe. Out  here in the real world, the "canon" isn't viewed<br>as either representing some kind of social constituencies [New Complexian<br>or otherwise] *or* as some kind of absolute judgement beyond and above<br>the social conditions of deciding. Rather, one is oblidged to construct<br>some view of how works are produced, consumed, disseminated,<br>heard, and retaught in different times and in different places. That is<br>understood to explicitly be at the heart of the activity of *anyone*<br>who discusses the notion of a "canon," and Heaven help the poor<br>person who neglects to be clear about that in these times.<br><br>In addition to mischaracterizing the canon in a way that I can't<br>imagine anyone at all familiar with the discourse doing, Brian has<br>also avoided mentioning in any organized way some of the questions<br>and debates which have emerged from the more serious critiques of the<br>notion of a  "canon" (we have a few of those horrible semioticians and<br>deconstructionists who write papers with titles like "Toward a Theory<br>of the Canon" which Brian has spoken ill of in this newsgroups to<br>thank for some of these discussions, incidentally). If the lot of you here<br>are seriously interested in engaging folks on the issue of why 12TET<br>work is or isn't considered canonical, it seems reasonable to think<br>that it might be good to understand how folks within the academy<br>think of these same issues. You might find that there are folks who're<br>perfectly willing to entertain your point of view, for example.<br><br>Perhaps I should begin my "debrianization" of the discussion of<br>canons with a simple disclaimer: what's here is intended to be<br>understood as my attempt to provide you with a plain-English<br>description of things as I understand them to be. I hope it's<br>clear to almost all of you that I don't view normative utterances<br>such as "John Cage is an incarnation of the Bodhisattva" and<br>matters of opinion such as "I don't like John Cage's music." as<br>the same thing. I'm merely operating as a non-academic who has<br>personally found this particular bit of academic discourse to be<br>worth thinking about for folks interested in looking at the body of<br>non 12TET work in relation to stuff that *is* 12TET. If I can<br>manage to describe the basic shape of the discussions about "the<br>canon" as practiced by the *real* circumspect academic folks<br>that I know well, I hope you'll see *why* this particular area of<br>study has caught my attention. But this is a provisional explanation<br>which I hope some of the *real* academics in our midst will be<br>quick to correct if'n I've overstated the case.<br><br>It seems easiest to begin with the observation that we've got a kind<br>of concensus on the part of persons who listen to and compose<br>music in this time and this culture that there is a grouping of<br>works and composers  who seem to be deemed as "exemplary"<br>for some reason or another. That's a simple notion of a canon.<br>For many of us, the practical engagement with it is often a matter<br> of pedagogy or repertoire (if we define education as an encounter<br>with an understanding of the exemplary works of a given discipline).<br>Of course, that whole definition itself is shot through with all kinds<br>of assumptions about cultural context; we date the current musical<br>canon  as something that show up sometime in the Romantic era,<br>as a result of  the historical/influential awareness of Beethoven<br>and Bach.<br><br>And this more general awareness didn't exactly spring from the head<br>of Zeus, either - it required its own contexts [stuff like a middle class,<br>publishing, the rise of the concert itself as an institution, biography<br>as a form, a couple of individuals like Liszt and Mendelssohn to<br>stir things up, and so on]. But that historical awareness which goes<br>well back into the last century isn't quite the notion of a "canon" as<br>we're using it now - we owe *that* construct to critical theory in<br>this century. This is greatly condensed, but I'm just trying to add<br>a little background/context. So, we're standing in the stream of<br>history, negotiating questions of value and coming up with this<br>socially constructed thing called "the canon." By virtue of being<br>a social construct, this negotiation of value includes some things<br>and excludes others. As an individual or small group within<br>the larger whole, there are persons whose inclusion we may<br>disagree with, or persons  whose relative "ranking" we may<br>question - one sees that in some of the recent discussions here<br>surrounding Harry Partch's work, for example.<br><br>That all seems a reasonable introduction to what happens when<br>this "canon" comes under fire, so to speak. ...<br><br>So, we don't like the canon. The obvious question is simply "<br>Should there  even *be* a canon?" Of course, there isn't a single<br>master list of composers who  are "in" the canon; in this sense<br>the notion of a canon for musical or literary works  differs<br>considerably from the Bible. In some sense, one winds up really<br>trying to answer the question of who "they" are who actually set<br>the "content" of the canon. That's that notion of being mindful<br>of context and all that.<br><br>Although being able to decide that we just scrap the canon altogether<br>might certainly get rid of the problem of who is excluded from a<br>canon and why and avoids the potential pitfalls of figuring out<br>how we'd go about supplementing any kind of canonical list, if<br>doesn't really touch the really thorny problem of *who* we should<br>teach/point to and how we *decide.* Moreover, it's questionable<br>that we could actually *do* such a thing - the argument here is that<br>we'd simply have all kinds of little subcanons whose adherents<br>would squabble for hegemony, etc.<br><br>Although I've several acquaintances who disagree with me on this,<br>I don't think that having a canon is something we can avoid - particularly<br>since, on a practical level, there's a strong connection between the canon<br>and its use as a snapshot for what is, at this time and in this place,<br>considered "exemplary." It seems to me that it might be more useful to<br>(in the words of Gerald Graf in his "Beyond the Culture Wars") "teach<br>the conflict." Strive to make explicit the provisionality of those<br>decisions and the ongoing socially constructed negotiations of value<br>which circle around what is included and what is excluded.<br><br>In light of that, it seems to me that there are about three other<br>basic ways that folks within academic discourse have tried to<br>address the  practices and concepts of the idea of a canon. I'll<br>try and outline them tomorrow.<br><br>Thanks for your patience.<br><br>With regards,<br>Gregory<br><br>_<br>I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,<br>paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only<br>maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it.
