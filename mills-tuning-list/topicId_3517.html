Sethares<br>Springer-Verlag, London 1998<br>ISBN 3-540-76173-X<br>345 pp. plus CD. <br><br>(sorry, I left the review reference at home, but can post it if <br>anyone wants to know - it's in an Australian Journal).<br><br>***********BEGIN REVIEW***********<br><br>To most people, the 12-note scale of the piano keyboard, and with it<br>the hierarchy of consonant intervals =BE the octave, fifth, fourth and<br>third =BE  is the basis of all music.  Some may be aware that the modern<br>system of equal temperament, in which all semitone intervals have<br>precisely the same frequency ratio, is a compromise that sacrifices<br>the purity of tuning of the consonant intervals (except that of the<br>octave) for the ability to play equally in all keys, but that is about<br>where most knowledge stops.<br><br> But what is the basis of these musical principles?  Take the octave,<br> for example.  Its importance as a concord derives from the fact that<br> ordinary Western musical instruments have harmonic spectra, in which<br> the overtone frequencies are integral multiples of that of the<br> fundamental.  If two notes an octave apart (frequency ratio 2:1) are<br> sounded simultaneously, then many of the overtones coincide and the<br> result is a pleasant smooth sound, while any mistuning leads to<br> unpleasant beats and tonal roughness.  But what if the individual<br> notes have inharmonic spectra?  A recorded example shows that if the<br> spectra of the two notes are stretched, then the "octave" must be<br> similarly stretched to give a concordant sound.  It is also possible<br> to divide either the genuine 2:1 octave or a stretched octave into a<br> number of equal "semitones" other than 12 =BE both 11-note and 10-note<br> divisions can sound very pleasant =BE provided that the overtone<br> spectra of the component notes are adjusted appropriately.  And this<br> is despite the fact that the traditional "concords" have now<br> disappeared!<br><br> Non-Western musical traditions based upon non-harmonic percussion<br> instruments, such as the  gamelan of Indonesia, have faced similar<br> problems and have developed pleasant-sounding scales with 5 or 7<br> notes in a slightly stretched octave, but with tunings very different<br> from simply playing selected notes on a piano.<br><br> This excellent book, written by a musically minded electrical<br> engineer and computer scientist, examines the basis of our whole<br> concept of melody and harmony and presents compelling recorded<br> demonstrations using computer-synthesised sounds.  The presentation<br> requires no mathematical background, though the relevant mathematics<br> and computer programs are given concisely in a series of appendixes<br> for those who want to follow them further.  As well as stretched<br> octaves, stretched spectra and non-12-tone scales, the author shows<br> in detail how to construct a synthetic instrument spectrum to match<br> an arbitrary scale, and conversely how to design a scale to fit a<br> given instrument spectrum.  There is a detailed treatment of the<br> gamelan, and then, as a virtuoso exercise, he designs a scale and<br> presents musical examples to match the sounds of a small bell, a<br> piece of resonant stone, and the pattern of an x-ray diffraction<br> spectrum!    He also shows how a computer can adaptively tune the<br> notes of a scale so that the result is concordant irrespective of key<br> changes =BE an aim that is only imperfectly fulfilled by equal<br> temperament and that leads to disaster in just intonation =BE and<br> outlines a treatment of music theory for an equal-tempered 10-tone<br> scale.<br><br> The writing throughout is admirably clear and straightforward, the<br> book production is up to Springer's usual high standards, and the<br> recorded passages on the CD, which comprise both short examples and<br> longer compositions in unusual scales on peculiar synthetic<br> instruments, admirably illustrate the points made in the text.  They<br> also demonstrate that the author is a very competent and persuasive<br> composer in this new idiom.<br><br> This book, which is destined to become a classic, is essential<br> reading for anyone concerned with computer music, or with the study<br> of non-Western music.  It should be bought and studied by all<br> lecturers (and read by all students!) in musicology, and should be in<br> the library of every institution teaching music at an advanced level.<br> Perceptual psychologists should also include it high on their<br> reading lists, and I am sure that engineers, mathematicians and<br> physicists will enjoy it.  I found it absorbing reading (and<br> listening!), and I can recommend it to anyone with an interest in the<br> fundamental psychological or acoustic basis of music.<br><br>Neville Fletcher<br><br>********END OF REVIEW QUOTE**************<br><br>The last paragraph is 200% right.  High praise indeed, and, having <br>read the book cover-to-cover twice (and more) I've absolutely no <br>doubt it is deserved.<br><br>Thought you'd all like to see this....... Hope you didn't mind me <br>blowing your 10-ET trumpet Bill ! <br><br>Patrick O-L</div>
