We didn't go into much detail in<br>the conversation, but he expressed a concern - I think an understandable one -<br>about that being an attempt over-systematizing music.  You might perhaps be<br>interested in my response to that concern.  <br><br>   (By the "Tamas" is a Hungarian name.)<br><br><br><br><br>Hi Tamas -<br><br>   I was thinking back to your reaction last Wednesday when I mentioned that I<br>write microtonal music.  I know what you're talking about, but I'm not sure if<br>you do!  <br><br>   Sorry.  I realize that that sounds insulting, but insult not at all what I<br>intend.  So let me explain a bit.  <br><br>   I absolutely do know exactly what you mean about mathematical equations and<br>musical formulas seeming uninspiring in the sense of the emotional excitement of<br>musical art.  But that's all an illusion when you really get down to it.<br>Composing music, as with creating any other form of art is inherently both an<br>intellectual and emotional endeavor.  Whether or not composers admit it to their<br>admirers, or to themselves, they use both profusely in their craft.  <br><br>   Everywhere you go when you pull apart a piece of music, you see evidence of<br>both evoking well-understood effects and of breaking the rules to create all new<br>effects.  Even the most emotionally inspiring music is absolutely loaded full of<br>very uninnovative and uninspiring "off-the-shelf" chord progressions.  My Theory<br>instructor was fond of pointing out examples where the magical emotionality of<br>Chopin's music was much more clearly attributable to just plain-and-simple<br>cleverness, than to magic or emotion.  <br><br>   Also, even the most exciting and spontaneous jazz improvisations owe their<br>brilliance to countless hours over the years of relentlessly tedious practice,<br>study, and memorization.  But those things are all part of what it takes to<br>create really inspiring art.  <br><br>   So, my interest in microtonality really doesn't imply bias toward the<br>intellectual side of the artistic process.  With the intellectual fascination of<br>using mathematical models to suggest new musical resources, comes an equal and<br>complimentary emotional excitement for the all-new musical feelings of these<br>resources.  Neither the intellectual nor the emotional excitement is more<br>important than the other to a microtonal composer on my opinion.  They are both<br>critically needed to produce that magical effect of great art.  <br><br>                                          - Gary M.<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 23 Nov 1995 12:17 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id CAA19169; Thu, 23 Nov 1995 02:17:44 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 23 Nov 1995 02:17:44 -0800<br>Message-Id: <00999D24A06CC020.1C20@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
