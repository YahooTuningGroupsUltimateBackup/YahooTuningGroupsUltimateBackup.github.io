Much (not <br>all) of what I have done is 5-limit, but that doesn't make it wholly<br>Pythagorean or tied to 12.<br><br>What I have tried to do in a couple of articles is to explore the<br>implications of 5-limit in equal temperaments and to use modified 5-limit<br>notation in ETs and in JI (with no prime limit). I don't think that makes<br>me quite the brontosaurus Brian suggests, especially because I am always<br>pointing out that other issues, explorations, and solutions exist. I am <br>aware that the notation system considered standard is quite limiting; I <br>am also aware that one good way to get musicians to make advances in <br>microtonality is to build on what they know, as Brian points out. The JI <br>piece of mine recorded by an amateur choir would never have gotten past <br>the first choral entry if I had turned the notation system on its head. <br>(They had a hard enough time as it was.)<br><br>I have also been saying for years the things Brian quotes Enrique Moreno as <br>saying. Part of the uniqueness of microtonal music is the context and <br>structure of the intervals, not just some abstract sense of how they sound.<br><br>In any case, nothing I have done is intended to be restrictive. I don't<br>argue that one system or one notation is the only way to do anything; <br>even if the disclaimers in my articles look like they're there to be<br>ignored, they're not. In the meantime, I await others' comments on those<br>articles, to see whether some of my ideas might be advanced by them, or by<br>me, for that matter... <br><br>One of these days I'll respond to Brian's original arguments about my<br>notation article in XH16, but in the meantime someone else should take<br>over. Has anybody read it? I really would like to have comments from more<br>than Brian and Manuel, both of whom have had considerable insight into <br>what I'm trying to do.<br><br>Diaskhismatically yours,<br><br>==========================      =================================<br>Dr. Paul Rapoport               e-mail:	rapoport@mcmaster.ca<br>SADM (Music)	                   tel: (+1) 905 529 7070, ext. 2 4217<br>McMaster University                fax: (+1) 905 527 6793</div>
