I was looking for a way to do that for my<br>sitar, where the strings are rather high above the frets so that the<br>increased tension when the string is pressed down needs to be taken into<br>account. The formulas and program are explained with diagrammes in his<br>book "Principios de la Gama Dina'mica".<br>The vibration frequency of a string depends on the vibrating length,<br>mass and the tension. All three of them change when the string is <br>pressed down against a fret.<br>Apart from the frequency ratio, there are five variables to the program:<br>- The length of the open string. This is the distance between the <br>bridge and the nut.<br>- The height of the frets. On a guitar, this is something in the order <br>of a millimetre.<br>- The height of the nut. This is the height where the string is fixed <br>perpendicular above the plane of the fingerboard.<br>- The height of the bridge. This is the height where the string leaves<br>the bridge, above the prolongation of the plane of the fingerboard. <br>This may be a little difficult to measure up, if the fingerboard makes <br>an angle with the rest of the instrument.<br>- A value that indicates how much the tension rises when the string is <br>stretched. It is the length increment due to elasticity: the difference <br>in length between the situations when the open string is tuned and<br>when the string is straight with zero tension. To measure it, first<br>tune the string, make a mark on the string just in the nut, <br>loosen the string until it stays straight but without tension, and <br>size the shortening, this value is called Del01.<br>The value can be assumed independent of the tension for metal strings<br>(within a certain range of course). This means that Hooke's law holds,<br>which says that the tension rises proportionally to the increase of<br>length. However it is not a fixed value in case of organic (plastic,<br>gut) strings. Mr. Sabat has written another program to deal with that<br>case. <br>All these values must be given in the same unit, millimetres are <br>convenient. I took the BASIC program, rewrote it in Ada, and improved <br>it somewhat to get the convergence more rapid and stable.<br>It is an iterating algorithm. I doubt whether it is possible to obtain<br>a formula in closed form. With all the square roots in it I did not <br>want to try an attack.<br>The input parameters in the following routine are in the same order as<br>above. The pitch parameter is the ratio of the desired frequency with <br>the frequency of the open string. The procedure will raise an<br>exception (i.e. end with an error condition) if the parameters<br>describe an impossible situation. The output parameter Result will be<br>the distance along the plane of the fingerboard between the nut and<br>the fret. <br><br><br>   Pitch_Out_Of_Range : exception;<br>   Fret_Too_High      : exception;<br><br>   procedure Fret_Position (Str_Length : in  Long_Float;<br>                            Hfret      : in  Long_Float;<br>                            Hnut       : in  Long_Float;<br>                            Hbridge    : in  Long_Float;<br>                            Del01      : in  Long_Float;<br>                            Lin_Pitch  : in  Long_Float;<br>                            Result     : out Long_Float) is<br>      Hdiff : constant Long_Float := Hbridge - Hnut;<br>      Inc   : Long_Float := Lin_Pitch / 2.0 - 0.5;<br>      M     : Long_Float := 1.0 + Inc;<br>      D, Lpmin, Lp2min, L2min, Del12, Del12min, M1, M2, Temp : Long_Float;<br>   begin<br>      while Inc > 1.0E-10 loop<br>         loop<br>            Lpmin  := Str_Length * (1.0 - 1.0 / M);<br>            D      := (Lpmin / Str_Length) * Hdiff + Hnut - Hfret;<br>            if D < 0.0 then<br>               raise Fret_Too_High;<br>            end if;<br>            Lp2min := Sqrt(Lpmin * Lpmin + D * D);<br>            L2min  := Sqrt((Str_Length / M) ** 2 + D * D);<br>            Del12  := Lp2min + L2min - Str_Length;<br>            Del12min := Del12 * L2min / (Lp2min + L2min);<br>            M1     := Str_Length / (L2min - Del12min);<br>            M2     := Str_Length / L2min *<br>                        Sqrt((Del01 + Del12min * M1) / Del01);<br>            if M2 > Lin_Pitch then<br>               Inc := Inc / 2.0;<br>               M := M - Inc;<br>               exit;<br>            else<br>               M := M + Inc;<br>            end if;<br>         end loop;<br>      end loop;<br>      Temp := Lp2min * Lp2min - (Hnut - Hfret) ** 2;<br>      if Temp < 0.0 then<br>         raise Pitch_Out_Of_Range;<br>      end if;<br>      Result := Sqrt(Temp);<br>   end Fret_Position;<br><br>So for example if it's called with the following parameters:<br><br>   Fret_Position(Str_Length => 600.0,<br>                 Hfret      => 0.8,<br>                 Hnut       => 1.5,<br>                 Hbridge    => 10.0,<br>                 Del01      => 3.6,<br>                 Lin_Pitch  => 1.25, -- 5/4 major 3rd<br>                 Result     => Result);<br><br>Result will be 118.0536.

Not exactly equal,<br>but the results differ only a few hundreds of a millimetre so there is no <br>difference in practice. Perhaps either one of us neclected something <br>subtle.<br>I shall put this routine in the next release of Scala, version 1.2.<br>Other things that one might take into consideration next are the<br>quantities neglected by this approach, for example the string<br>stiffness is assumed to be zero and the position where the finger<br>presses the string is assumed to be right on the fret where it is in<br>practice just behind the fret, increasing the length and tension of the<br>string a little further. So this one should keep in mind when<br>interpreting the results. Another complication will arise when single<br>frets are used for more than one string so a compromise may be needed.<br>Let me repeat that the routine can be inaccurate for strings of<br>organic material.
