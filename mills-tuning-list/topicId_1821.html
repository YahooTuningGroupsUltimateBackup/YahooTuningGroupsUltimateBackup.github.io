We looked at x-ray diffraction<br>>patterns (spectra) and mapped them into the audio spectra. Many of<br>>the resulting sounds were exceedingly complex (*very* many<br>>nonharmonic partials), but there were some real standouts. One of<br>>our favorites was the sound of the morphine crystal, which we used<br>>for a piece titled "Duet for Morphine and Crystal" that appeared in<br>>the EMI compilation cassette that year.<br><br>Having broadcast the piece a number of times, I can personally attest<br>that a) it's quite listenable b) it seems to attract the attention of<br>a number of those community radio listeners in the habit of calling the<br>station when they hear something that interests them. I try and explain<br>what Bill's said above, and point out that he's in the process of<br>releasing a CD of his intriguing musics. Just out of curiousity, what<br>other XRD stuff sounded interesting? Can one generalize? I wouldn't<br>mind trying to map an essential oil like Melissa, which I could then<br>collide with the Allman Brothers tune of the same name....<br><br>Working on !12tET program number *4*,<br>Gregory<br><br><br>|  COMPUTER PRODUCTS -  HEURIKON CORPORATION  |<br>|                Powerful Products for Communications                 |<br>|                                                                     |<br>| Gregory Taylor                       Email: gtaylor@heurikon.com    |<br>| Marketing Communications Manager     Phone: 608-831-5500            |<br>| 8310 Excelsior Drive                 Fax: 608-831-4249              |<br>| Madison, WI 53717                                                   |<br>||<br>|  Yo, digerati! the surf's up at Heurikon! http://www.heurikon.com   |<br>||<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 11 Mar 1997 18:20 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02082; Tue, 11 Mar 1997 18:20:57 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02080<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id JAA12203; Tue, 11 Mar 1997 09:17:57 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 11 Mar 1997 09:17:57 -0800<br>Message-Id: <33254AED.5632@cavehill.dnet.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
