Schoenberg could explain the whole chromatic <br>scale as harmonic series above C, F, and G; however, in identifying C# with <br>the 13th harmonic of F as well as the 11th harmonic of G, he was identifying <br>it with two notes a semitone apart. Meanwhile, Hindemith expressed all 12TET <br>intervals as 5-limit just ratios, and identified the strength of the <br>relationship with the simplicity of the ratio:<br><br>Strongest<br>2/1 (octave)<br>3/2 (perf. fifth)<br>4/3 (perf. fourth)<br>5/3 (maj. sixth)<br>5/4 (maj. third)<br>6/5 (min. third)<br>8/5 (min. sixth)<br>9/5 (min. seventh)<br>9/8 (maj. second)<br>15/8 (maj. seventh)<br>16/15 (min. second)<br>45/32 (tritone)<br>Weakest<br><br>(He construed this sequence as sort of a "tone row" in his Ludus Tonalis.) <br>So he is really constructing the chromatic scale by building major triads on <br>C,  F,  G, Db, and Eb, and a minor triad on B: a rather arbitrary <br>construction. He then assumes that the relationships he set forth will be <br><br>heard as such without the conncting triads. I would argue that a tritone is <br>never directly heard as a 45/32; it is almost as close to 7/5 as a minor <br>sixth is to 8/5, so 45/32 is silly except in some kind of "extended <br>referece" theory and then only in very specific situations. Other ratios he <br>put forth are not going to be directly heard as such, or only in certain <br>chords.<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 7 Jun 1996 04:12 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id TAA28699; Thu, 6 Jun 1996 19:12:56 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 6 Jun 1996 19:12:56 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960607020702_71670.2576_HHB85-7@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
