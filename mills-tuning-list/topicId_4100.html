And Morrison spelled things out real well about the forum<br>CD...I do, indeed, have to assemble them, so please be patient...next in<br>line are Loffink, Alves, and Burt...I'll get them out as soon as<br>possible. I sent one to Keyboard mag, and a few other writers as<br>well...hopefully, some of you will have some creative ideas as to where<br>to place them. I hope for some good reviews, and some airplay...I have a<br>number of thoughts about the project, but will wait until everyone has<br>their copies before I chat about it. If anyone emailed me recently, I am<br>afraid that the messages were lost, so try again if you need to<br>chat...see you...Hstick</div>
