I've programmed<br>my k2000 for 19-tones et. it is however a tedious process to retune the<br>kurzweil. but if you put in the effort it's really worth it. the kurzweil is a<br>beautifulsynthesizer with some very realistic samples. additionally in terms<br>of tuning because every note is completely programmable you can say for<br>instance start on c1 program 19 pitches skip a few keys and repeat the process<br>starting on c3 and then again on c5 etc. this helps alot when improvising. you<br>tend to run out of keys a bit more quickly but on the new k2500 88key models<br>that problem is minimized.<br><br>goodluck,<br><br>denis atadan<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 6 Oct 1996 20:01 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA24093; Sun, 6 Oct 1996 19:02:56 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA24087<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA06325; Sun, 6 Oct 1996 11:02:51 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 6 Oct 1996 11:02:51 -0700<br>Message-Id: <961006180035_71670.2576_HHB32-2@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3739 href="#3739">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/1996 10:29:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>As far as I know at least, 88CET tuning is my own discovery (invention or<br>whatever), but several others on the list have come up with some good music in<br>it as well (Bill Sethares, Paul Fly, and Warren Burt, to name three).<br><br>   "CET" stands for "Cent [per step] Equal-Temperament", so 88CET tuning is an<br>equal temperament where each step is 88c apart.  For nonoctave tunings, that<br>sort of nomenclature is less cumbersome than the usual "TET" nomenclature.  But<br>it works out to about 13.63TET.  <br><br>   I did a series of posts with a lot of detail about 88CET several months ago,<br>but the essential goal of 88CET tuning could probably best be summarized as to<br>represent the frequency ratios 4:6:7:9:10:11:15 and their combinations (like 5:3<br>and 5:2) in an equal-tempered environment, and at the expense of the octave.  <br><br>   Were I to characterize 88CET music in a general way, I would say that it has<br>a flourescent glow to it.  Speaking for myself, I have found that it's<br>appropriate for musical ideas and styles that are a little raucous, or that<br>sound mysterious.  It's probably not terribly appropriate for Mozart/Haydn-like<br>styles.  Incredibly though it does turn to be possible, although with great<br>effort, to produce that sort of harmony and style in 88CET.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 7 Oct 1996 12:43 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01479; Mon, 7 Oct 1996 11:44:19 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01476<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id DAA22144; Mon, 7 Oct 1996 03:44:16 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 7 Oct 1996 03:44:16 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199610070640_MC1-A1E-1A42@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
