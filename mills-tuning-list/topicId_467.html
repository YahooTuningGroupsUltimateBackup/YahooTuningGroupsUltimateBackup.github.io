Quite impressive,<br>I couldn't pick out all the tuning details, but it was a blast to <br>hear an orchestra play those unusual intervals. I wouldn't<br>mind hearing this again.<br><br>Last night, LaMonte Young's Forever Bad Blues Band<br>played the Knitting Factory. I wasn't a big fan of the CD,<br>however I couldn't resist the opportunity to hear LaMonte and the <br>Catler brothers in action. Starting with a 45 min. solo piano "alap" <br>section by LY, the three hour concert was bit of a marathon.<br><br>Improvisational, more like rock then jazz, I got enough out of <br>the show to make me want to go again tonight.<br><br>I was particularly impressed with Jon Catler's guitar playing.<br>Previously, I have found electric guitar in tunings a bit<br>of a gimmick where the main goal seemed not to<br>explore the tuning but get "Hey! Look at me!" attention.<br>There's none of that here. In the FBBB, Catler really takes <br>to exploring and pushing the envelope using interchangeable<br>fretless and JI fretboards. JC didn't just force blues licks<br>in to the tuning or obscure the tuning <br>with DSP effects, using just good old distortion to enhance tone.<br><br>Brad Catler played mostly fretless bass although he<br>switch to a JI bass towards the end.<br><br>Young's Dorian Blues in G is in 6/8 and during parts of the concert<br>LaMonte and the drummer seemed to be in a battle with<br>LaMonte pumping out 4/4 accents over the 6/8.<br><br>For those who didn't catch the original announcement,<br>here's who is in the band:<br><br>La Monte Young & The Forever Bad Blues Band<br><br>La Monte Young, Korg synthesizer in just intonation; <br>Jon Catler, just intonation and fretless guitar; <br>Brad Catler, just intonation and fretless bass; <br>Jonathan Kane, drums; <br>Marian Zazeela, light design.<br><br>I listened to the CD this morning. I think I like it now. :)<br><br>just lucky to be able to check it all out,<br><br>      *   *      ..    *   D a v i d   B e a r d s l e y ... .*<br>.     .      . *         .   .   ...     dmb5561719@aol.com<br>I M M P   &    B i i n k!    m  u  s  i  c               *           ..<br>     . ..         .*..            . .. .           ..* .     .    ..   . *. .<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 9 Jun 1996 08:52 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id XAA28380; Sat, 8 Jun 1996 23:52:19 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 8 Jun 1996 23:52:19 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01540700ade023013959@[165.227.35.74]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
