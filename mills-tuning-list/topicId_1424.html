I found explanations to how the scales <br>are formed. Intervals in a melody, or for that matter, notes in any part in <br>progression of chords, are like a passenger sitting inside a train watching a <br>sequence of electric wire posts sweeping past. When the spacing is in a regular<br>pattern, he finds it normal. Just as if interval arrangements follows some<br>sort of pattern in a _balanced_ manner, the listener then finds it in tune.<br><br>The western major scale, the Chinese major scale, the mean tone and the <br>tempered scale, all conform to this logic.<br><br>But those are the easiest pieces of "work" to analyse.<br><br>Back in October, I read a paper in a conference in Shanghai which I <br>explained exactly when and why two identical melodies in the "Butterfly <br>Lovers'" violin concerto must be played differently - by exactly a 81/80 <br>comma on certain notes.<br><br>There is an exact reason why every note in every good piece of music<br>must be played a particular intonation that is "correct". There is a natural <br>law which many classical composers fell into. And breaking this law became <br>the Art for subsequent composers.<br><br>Once I played a little of a cd recording of the "Butterfly Lovers'" violin <br>concerto (not by me) at my home, and asked my maid whether she thought <br>the violinist was playing well or not. She exclaimed "Why, is that a cd. <br>I thought it was your friend playing!" She thought it was the man who sold me <br>my violin. He just manage to play some violin, but no where near good. My maid <br>did not notice the accompanying orchestra on the cd. She just noticed how <br>the violinist played out of tune.<br><br>Yes, I played this concerto, with a piano, two weeks ago, and will play<br>again twice in January. The audience likes it, and wonders why I sound<br>better than their cd's at their home, with orchestra.<br><br>One new pupil is studying this concerto with me for her first lesson<br>yestersday. She is ten years old and got distinction in her grade 8 LRSM <br>exam. And she noticed that the lovers were actually dead, when I showed her<br>how the ending melody should be played, differently from the beginning.<br><br>John Chalmers heard a little of my playing on tape in my car. On the<br>"Spanish Dance" (in a minor key), he commented that my playing improved <br>a lot (actually, it was just "correct". On the Meditation, which I told <br>him I was playing in the "Chinese scale", he said, "It sounds very <br>expressive"  which actually, just exactly how the composer intended.<br><br>That is exactly what I teach. Which particular pitch on which note, on every<br>note.<br><br>I make myself, and my choir, sound normal. And make the others sound<br>different. <br><br>Pls see my notes via ftp kahless.isca.uiowa.edu in /pub/algo-comp/LinusLiu<br><br>Linus Liu.<br><br>>When DO you use a particular pitch, indeed, and what are the implications<br>>thereof? How do we find out the answer to this most ultimate of<br>>musical questions...and if, as Danielou suggests, the tempered scale<br>>is out of harmony with the natural laws of musical pitch organization<br>>(which, of course, we definitely know it is), what is the cumulative<br>>spiritual effect of all these out of jharmony (as opposed to out of<br>>tune) intervals? I am beginning to realize that this is perhaps the<br>>most important issue facing musicians in the world today.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 23 Dec 1996 17:21 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01344; Mon, 23 Dec 1996 17:23:43 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01446<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA23685; Mon, 23 Dec 1996 08:23:40 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 23 Dec 1996 08:23:40 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009AD47DCA998420.E094@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4401 href="#4401">ðŸ”—</a>linusliu@HK.Super.NET (Linus Liu)</h3><span>12/24/1996 5:55:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Thanks Coul for a part of a much bigger library on the subject I must have <br>seen.
