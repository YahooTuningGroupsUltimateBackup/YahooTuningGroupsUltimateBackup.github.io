But even more challenging is that we need to do all of this in a<br>way that convinces skeptical audiences that it's exciting.  <br><br>   That's a tall order that needs a whole lot of work to fill.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 17 Dec 1996 16:08 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA21661; Tue, 17 Dec 1996 16:10:17 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA21735<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id HAA09922; Tue, 17 Dec 1996 07:10:14 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 17 Dec 1996 07:10:14 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612171000_MC1-D44-44E0@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
