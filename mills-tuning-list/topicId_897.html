My interest here is the noisier less conventially  aesthetic<br>approaches to tuning, compositon, dare I say "improvisation", performance,<br>music instrument invention, computer, hypertexted sound on the web, crackpot<br>electronics.  So by exposing my self Im sure its probably clear that much of<br>the mailinglist style banter & theorizing ad naseum holds little interest for<br>me. What interests me greatly is the interactive medium we have in front of<br>us to collectively come to new ideas, create new works, lighten the burden of<br>history & construct a collective musicality that would make Harry Partch sit<br>up in his gravel & yodel.  (& it would probably take something  utterly<br>designed with nature & wildness to even get his attention).  <br><br>Yesterday I had some of the most fun (& I do desire fun) by following the web<br>link to a posting here which mysterious led me to a site by David Behrman &<br>several other including some named IGOR.  Getting to meet those people's<br>work, even on a cursory level, was much more seductive than having to wade<br>thru the rhetoric.  Understand that Im not dissing what's going on, Im saying<br>it would be useful to many many other people who are very interested in<br>experimenting with alternative tunings, more personally invoked styles of<br>composition to feel included in this space.<br><br>My suggestion is maybe a directory of web pages proactively hyperlinked by<br>all who come here.  So that we can visit each others life & each others work<br>in this particular (read peculiar) dimensional virtuality.<br><br>I apologize for being so prosaic but even though Ive read thru these things<br>endlessly, Ive never felt that there was a place for my style & articulation<br>of musicality. Having quite college eight times, (even got thown out of the<br>electronic music seminar for throwing paint bombs at the building ways during<br>a noise ritual), have spent many years painting records & putting my own<br>labels on them, writing a book about noise as the most unused & neglected<br>resource on the planet,<br><br><br>I<br>guess<br>Im<br>just<br>not<br>qualified<br>to<br>carry<br>on<br>about<br>the<br>mathematics<br>of<br>frequency<br>as<br>it<br>relates<br>to<br>someone's<br>subjective<br>fantasies.<br><br>Miekal And<br>Dreamtime Village<br>The Driftless Academy of Botanical Apparitions<br>http://net22.com/dreamtime/<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 19 Sep 1996 05:06 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11306; Thu, 19 Sep 1996 05:08:24 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11023<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id UAA12215; Wed, 18 Sep 1996 20:08:22 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 18 Sep 1996 20:08:22 -0700<br>Message-Id: <01I9N3DTMT5E8WW710@delphi.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
