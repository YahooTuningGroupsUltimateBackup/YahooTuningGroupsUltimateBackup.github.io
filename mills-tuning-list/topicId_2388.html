As much in the Western world as anywhere else.<br> And what a shame!  It was darn well true of me, too, until a few months ago.<br> And I have a B. of Mus. degree!  I recently described to my former Dean of<br>the School of Fine Arts how dramatically my recent study of JI and other<br>tunings had deepened my understanding and appreciation of music in general,<br>not to mention greatly refining my ear for pitch.  I asked him why we were<br>not taught this stuff in school, why I had to wait 10 years after graduation<br>to stumble upon a real understanding of music.  He had no answer.<br><br>My point is, understanding the hows and whys of something provides a stronger<br>basis for intuitive usage of it.  The two (knowlege and intuition) are not<br>isolated from each other.  Knowlege is power.  If musicians from all cultures<br>studied tuning, including the math and science of it, and practiced putting<br>that knowlege to work, how much better we all would understand our own musics<br>and those of other cultures!  Not that that's entirely possible, since many<br>don't have sufficient education in math and science to grasp the mechanisms<br>involved.  But the more the merrier, I say.<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu<br>Subject:  Re: srutis and such<br>PostedDate:  13-09-97 02:07:39<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  15-09-97 10:14:15-15-09-97 10:14:16,15-09-97 10:13:34-15-09-97 10:13:34<br>DeliveredDate:  15-09-97 10:13:34<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256511.0000AFD4; Sat, 13 Sep 1997 02:07:30 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA32756; Sat, 13 Sep 1997 02:07:39 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 13 Sep 1997 02:07:39 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA32752<br>Received: (qmail 13172 invoked from network); 13 Sep 1997 00:07:33 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 13 Sep 1997 00:07:33 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01510102b03f1e217117@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
