Perhaps it<br>> could be an evolving group effort. I've been thinking<br>> about what I'd like to see in it and what I could<br>> contribute. The toughest job may be in deciding what<br>> not to let in so that it wouldn't bloat to the size<br>> of a reference library. As a minimum, I think we<br>> need a glossary and an exposition of common<br>> tuning-notation styles (not the tunings themselves).<br>> <br>> Second: If we could find ways to make the exchange<br>> of actual sounds be part of our communication, it<br>> would raise by orders of magnitude the quality of<br>> the experience. When I suggested this before, I<br>> received from two people almost-angry replies that<br>> such a thing was too daunting to even suggest, yet<br>> one other person had already been quietly sending<br>> me sound files via private email. One idea is to<br>> find internet-accessible memory space which we can<br>> temporarily upload stuff to, and then reference via<br>> URL links in our messages so as not to clog the list<br>> stream itself. Maybe if we compare notes we can<br>> find a file format which most of us can listen to.<br><br>I'd happily second both of these proposals. Uploading compressed .wav <br>files by anonymous ftp to a selected site would seem to be the best <br>option, since not all subscribers will have e-mail accounts (or <br>software) that can cope with large files.<br>-- <br>Jonathan Walker<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 20:06 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA32182; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 20:06:22 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA32136<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id LAA21113; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 11:04:21 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 27 Feb 1997 11:04:21 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3315D329.6F85@cavehill.dnet.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
