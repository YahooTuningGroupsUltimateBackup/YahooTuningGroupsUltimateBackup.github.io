If one is wider than another, then they're not equal, are they?<br><br>Remember that Sorge's were *ear tuning* instructions.  Because<br>frequency doubles with every octave, the beating of any fixed interval<br>*increases* as the frequency of the lower tone of the pair increases.  Although<br>Sorge's major thirds remain the same size linearly speaking, they would<br>beat faster with each successive third of the row, hence Sorge's<br>instructions to make each of the thirds a little wider than the last.<br><br>>> Yes, this is the F#-C# fifth in Kirnberger I though III.  However, it is not<br>>> tempered by 1/12 Pythagorean comma; it is tempered by the<br>>> *schisma.*  Kirnberger was not the best mathematician in the world<br>>> and Marpurg, in fact, corrects Kirnberger's calculations in Marpurg's<br>>> _Versuch._<br><br>>Let me get this straight: you castigate Jorgenson for insisting on .1<br>>cent accuracy, and now you're making a fuss about a difference of (my<br>>calculator puts it) .0012817 cents?  Sounds like straining at gnats and<br>>swallowing camels to me.<br><br>I was merely pointing out that there is a difference between 1/12 of a<br>Ditonic Comma and the schisma.  For all intents and purposes (thank you,<br>Michael), they are the same thing and difference between them is<br>imperceptible in actual tuning... even to your dog.<br><br><br>Aleksander Frosztega<br><br><br><br>-------------------------------------------------------<br>Aleksander Frosztega     "Odi summusos; proinde aperte<br>University of Utrecht     dice quid sit quod times."<br>The Netherlands<br>-------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 28 Sep 1995 13:45 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id EAA16230; Thu, 28 Sep 1995 04:45:32 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 28 Sep 1995 04:45:32 -0700<br>Message-Id: <950928114206_71670.2576_HHB30-3@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
