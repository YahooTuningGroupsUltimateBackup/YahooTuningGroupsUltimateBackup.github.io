What is the<br>experimental control?  What kind of statistical<br>methods does the  experimental composer use <br>to analyze hi/r results--linear regression, chi<br>square, least squares, ANOVA?  What and<br>where is the mathematical model upon which the <br>experimental composer's hypothesis is based?<br>Which laws of nature does the experimental<br>composer seek to investigate...?  ...Or is, perhaps,<br>the term "experimental" used merely to indicate<br>a certain glamorous intention to be "scientific,"<br>in the same way that advertisements for <br>astrological services include the phrase <br>"scientifically calculated using the latest<br>astrological computer program"...?<br>As it happens,  Iannis  Xenakis is the composer <br>most often described in the press and by<br>audiences as  "the major 20th century <br>experimental composer."  In fact Xenakis<br>succeeded where Caged failed:  using a computer,<br>Xenakis could toss millions of coins in the time<br>it took Cage to toss one, and with a computer<br>program Xenakis could direct the ensemble<br>statistics of his coin-tosses, whereas Cage<br>could never do anything more than generate a<br>random noise stream.  Because using a computer<br>would have required talent and intelligence,<br>Cage chose instead to spout a steady stream of<br>double-talk.  On the other hand, one could also<br>argue that Morton Feldman succeeded where <br>Cage failed.  In fact so *many* other composers<br>produced interesting music using techniques<br>with which Cage failed to produce anything<br>listenable that it's clear the difference is *not*<br>due to...uh, well...chance.  <br>Rather, the difference can only be explained<br>by Cage's utter lack of musical talent.<br>However,  John Chalmers wasn't the only<br>subscriber who rushed out of the shower to <br>Cage's aid.<br>A number of other forum subscribers have <br>staunchly  "defended" Cage by pointing out that <br>"he changed how we listened to music," that<br>he wrote amusing prose, that he was the<br>first to compose with the I Ching, etc., etc.<br>So, in the same spirit, here's a list of reasons why <br>we should listen to John Cage's music:<br>* John Cage was a great modern composer <br>     because he was tall.<br>* John Cage was a great modern composer<br>      because he liked mushrooms.<br>* John Cage was a great modern composer<br>      because he wore flannel shirts.<br>* John Cage was a great modern composer<br>       because Ecuador is a land-locked country.<br>* John Cage was a great modern composer<br>       because the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle<br>       ended the war of Austrian succession in<br>        1748.<br>Take your pick!<br>Of course no one has yet suggested that John<br>Cage was a worthwhile composer on the basis that<br>he could actually compose interesting music. <br>No, we all know that would be *pushing it too <br>far*.<br>After all, even for the most gullible forum<br>subscriber...credulity has its limits.<br>--<br>In a related nugget of wisdom, Paul Rapoport<br>lamented the "Cage-bashing" that has gone<br>on.  This is presumably the new description<br>for telling self-evident truths--we now call it<br>"bashing," along the lines, no doubt, of <br>the omnipresent Political Correctness.  Thus <br>one can't call someone fat nowadays: s/he is<br>"weight-challenged."  Saying someone is <br>fat is vile and outrageous; it's "weight-bashing."<br>In the same vein, let's have no more of this<br>condemnation of Hitler for slaughtering 6<br>million Jews. That's "Hitler-bashing." Similarly,<br>John Wayne Gacy was no doubt "compassion-<br>challenged," and we should all refrain from<br>"Gacy-bashing."  For that matter, we should <br>write to the National Insitute of Health and<br>urge that the battle against cancer be ended<br>posthaste.  <br>That, after all,  is "cancer-bashing."<br>Perhaps John Cage is a great modern composer <br>because (as P.T. Barnum put it) there's<br>a sucker born every minute...<br>--<br>In Tuning Digest  784 Greg Taylor offered<br>an enooooooormous post in response to my <br>modest proposal re: the "accepted canon" of<br>classical music.  Without offering any<br>facts or data to back up his sentiments,<br> the thrust of Taylor's several thousand<br>words of verbiage seems to be: "I don't like<br>mclaren."  <br>This can be shortened immensely and vast<br>amounts of internet bandwidth saved if<br>Taylor simply posts "IDLM" in response to<br>my posts.  <br>In fact, the process can be streamlined <br>even further by writing a  'bot which  <br>spits out the string "IDLM" to the tuning <br>forum at random intervals.<br>This would enlighten us at least as much<br>as Taylor's actual posts, and save enormous<br>amounts of time and bandwidth.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 11 Aug 1996 01:05 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06943; Sun, 11 Aug 1996 01:05:14 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06941<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id QAA01593; Sat, 10 Aug 1996 16:05:12 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 10 Aug 1996 16:05:12 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960810190150_381694222@emout18.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
