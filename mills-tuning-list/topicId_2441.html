They are trained to deliver melodies, and these before the<br>invention of the amplifier.  Try a choir.<br><br>>I have to disagree here.  The word microtonal definitely needs to be on the<br>>front jacket.  The tuning email address will mean nothing to 99.9% of our<br>>customers.  Only after they buy the cd will they realize its significance.<br><br>I don't have my copy yet (which I paid for in March), and I wasn't a<br>contributor, but I don't think that either the email address or the word<br>microtonal should be on the cover.  Music should stand on its own.<br><br>>This is a point that should be repeated more often. The early music<br>>community has been intensely engaged with questions of intonation, at least<br>>since Wesley Kuhnle's pioneering efforts in the 1950's.<br><br>Actually since forever, since no clavichord tuning speciallty has ever<br>existed.  The comment was clearly about modern pianos only, since they are<br>the only acoustic keyboard instruments that will hold a tune long enough to<br>make specialist tuners affordable.<br><br>>no matter how convenient a particular notation may be, no single notation is<br>>neccessary. For example, attempts to standardize Just intonation with<br>>Johnston's or my own or some other notation should be discouraged in favor<br>>of getting players to think flexibly about pitch in general.<br><br>Brother, I'll agree with this!<br><br>Carl</div>
