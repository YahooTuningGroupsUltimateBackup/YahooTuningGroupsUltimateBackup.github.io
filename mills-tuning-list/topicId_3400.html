Also a hoax is the rumour that Indiana at<br>one time attempted to legislate the same thing.<br><br>And yes, the Chronicles (and book of Kings) do refer to the 30 cubits<br>around and 10 cubits across.  Please note, though, if the item were<br>hexagonal, the diameter would be exactly 3.0000...this is perhaps the<br>rendering anticipated.  Also, the lip had a finite width -- perhaps the<br>30 cubits was the interior circumference and 10 cubits was the exterior<br>diameter, making the lip 0.7 cubits thick.  More likely, I think the<br>scribes could neither measure nor write a phrase requiring fractional<br>cubits.<br><br>If only the musical instruments of the time were described in detail by<br>the authors!  I would love to know the structure and tunings.<br>></div><h3><a id=7575 href="#7575">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>4/27/1998 10:01:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>It looks an awful lot like the true fundamental is an octave below the<br>>period you have identified.<br><br>   That's not terribly likely for three reasons:<br>1.  This note is in the lower register of the bass clarinet.  It is not an<br>    overtone.  The register key is not down.<br>2.  If you look at the wave earlier in time, you see that the alternating<br>    low-high of that rough slowly starts alternating the other direction, and<br>    in about the same amount of time starts alternating the other way.  There's<br>    something going on that isn't at a subharmonic frequency.<br>3.  Once again, if it were a component at half the fundamental frequency, we<br>    would have seen the entire wave ooze up and down with that trough.<br><br><br><br><br>>Try playing<br>>a wind instrument without the reed and you will still get a rough idea<br>>of the pitches you're fingering from the way your breath-noise is<br>>amplified.<br><br>   Analogously, one thing I've done on my orchestral string samples is to<br>sample and loop the sound of bowing the bridge, and then high-pass filter<br>it out in the original sample.  That way the pitch of that noise component<br>doesn't change in pitch with the change in pitch of the tone, just as it<br>does not on a the real instruments.</div><h3><a id=7593 href="#7593">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.

I<br>wonder if a double-reed instrument might have some slow phase drift due<br>to slight inequalities between the two reeds, much like a guitar string<br>will vibrate at two slighlty different frequencies if the bridge allows<br>horizontal vibrations to begin at a different point or with different<br>resistance than vertical vibrations.<br><br>>3.

A physical "subharmonic" is not just a sine wave but is<br>a (weak) true fundamental with any or all (weak) harmonic overtones. In<br>this case, those overtones would be at 3/2, 5/3, 7/2, . . . the primary<br>pitch and could conspire to keep the bulk of the waveform intact. (I'm<br>sure if we knew more about the physics of the situation, this<br>"conspiracy" would turn out to arise in a very natural way, not one that<br>requires any "consciousness" on the part of the instrument).</div><h3><a id=7605 href="#7605">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>4/29/1998 7:12:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Not necessarily.
