The subject areas include, but are not limited to astronomy,<br>biology, climatology, commodities, cosmology, dendrology, economics,<br>extinctions, finances, geology, history, meteorology, mathematics,<br>medicine, music, paleontology, politics, prices, physics, social trends,<br>stocks, weather, wars.<br><br>Observations of cycles, mathematical analysis methods and theories<br>concerning cycles are to be discussed and information about conferences,<br>lectures, books, software and other related matters.  The emphasis is on<br>an interdisciplinary approach.<br><br>According to Edward Dewey, who formed the Foundation for the Study of<br>Cycles, there is no subject are that has been studied which does not<br>show cycles.  Other interdisciplinary cycles researchers include Raymond<br>Wheeler, and the famous Russians Kondratieff and Chizhevski.  Because<br>education is broken into particular disciplines, the benefits of<br>understanding of the relationships between all things that can be<br>achieved with an interdisciplinary approach are often not achieved and<br>many people must rediscover these connections for themselves.  So this<br>is primarily an interdisciplinary group for sharing information,<br>discoveries, ideas and theories on cycles.<br><br>My name is Ray Tomes and I am a member of the advisory board of the<br>Foundation for the Study of Cycles in the US and a member of CIFA in<br>Europe/Russia and have attended and spoken at many cycles conferences<br>around the world.  It is clear that researchers in all areas of study<br>can gain a new perspective by the study of cycles and recognising that<br>there are many relationships between things that we do not fully<br>understand.<br><br>Some Keywords: cycles, periodicity, frequency, fourier analysis,<br>spectral analysis, spectrum, waves, waveforms, indicators, music,<br>tuning, electromagnetism, sound, brain-waves, rhythm, circadean rhythms,<br>resonance, repetition, modulation, signal, noise, catastrophe.<br><br>If you are interested in being a member of such a list group (messages<br>are exchanged through email by special servers) then please reply to me<br>by email by keeping the subject field the same as above and replacing<br>the contents of this post by a simple statement of interest.<br><br>The group will be started if and when there is sufficient interest and<br>those replying will be subscribed.  You can unsubscribe at any time that<br>you want to.  I will be the list owner and only members of the list will<br>be able to post to the list which will be available in a digest form (so<br>that only one message per day arrives).  The policy of the group will be<br>strictly enforced so that all posts are:<br>a. Polite and respectful.<br>b. Related to the subject matter of Cycles in some way.<br>c. Considered and not overly repetitive.<br>If you have any further suggestions on policy or subject matter then<br>please include them with your reply and a statement of policy will be<br>issued when/if the list commences.<br><br>Best wishes<br><br>Ray Tomes<br><br>-- Ray Tomes -- rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz -- Harmonics Theory --<br>     http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 4 Jul 1997 02:40 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04622; Fri, 4 Jul 1997 02:41:16 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 4 Jul 1997 02:41:16 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04639<br>Received: (qmail 9261 invoked from network); 4 Jul 1997 00:41:07 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 4 Jul 1997 00:41:07 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.970703180748.28203C-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5744 href="#5744">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>7/3/1997 11:38:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Rousseau's bits, a reworking of a<br>>rather standard 12TET chord progression in<br>>15TET.
