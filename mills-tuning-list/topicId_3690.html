Besides, how do the other ratios<br>> support 10/9?<br><br>Now, this is a little aside of the conversation, but aren't 9:8 and 10:9<br>both part of the 5-limit system?  Partch includes them in his 5-limit<br>chapter in "Genesis".  Where does this "9-limit" talk come from?  9 isn't a<br>prime number.<br><br>Both 9:8 and 10:9 are used in the standard E9th pedal steel.  Typically the<br>F# is tuned to 9:8 and lowered to 10:9 with the pedal that raises the B<br>(3:2) to C# (5:3).  I've always thought of it as a 5-limit system.  There's<br>nothing here to really challenge the ear.<br><br>The interval between 10:9 and 9:8 is significant (about 22 cents).  It's<br>worth noting that some amateur steel players try to split the difference<br>instead of tuning the F# string JI and adding a tuning rod for the change<br>from 9:8 to 10:9.  The success of that approach depends on the amount of<br>"cabinet drop" of the individual instrument.  When you engage a pedal, the<br>increased stress on the instruments tends to detune strings that aren't<br>attached to the pedal.<br><br>On some inferior instruments, cabinet drop detuning can be as much as 10<br>cents!  So, if our amateur steel player tunes his 9:8 F# 6 cents flat, and<br>gets 10 cents of cabinet drop when he engages the pedals (and moves the bar<br>up a 10th of a fret to compensate for it, we hope), his 10:9 will be 6 cents<br>sharp.  This is "close enough for country", as they say...<br><br>    -b0b-<br><br>http://wco.com/~quasar/articles/just_e9.html</div>
