The research was excellent<br>and I consider it to be certainly worth the price.  Gilmor goes a bit off<br>the deep end with his occassional psycho-analysis of some of Harry's<br>sitations/ characteristics ( I find it hard to believe that Harry's<br>homosexuallity was caused by him being circumsized (sp?) at the age of<br>eight!) -- but, hey, Bob Gilmor is a musicologist -- and I think a very<br>good one! It is not an "upper" read but I think very accurate to Harry's<br>ideals and stuggles.<br><br>The day I finished it the new Lou Harrison bio (Miller /Lieberman) arrived<br>and that was like turning on a different light- very true to Lou's life but<br>very "uP"- the celebration of a composer.<br><br>Both books need to be read by us folks.<br><br>Also the Robert Erickson bio by Charles Sheer published by Fallen Leaf<br>Press (?) is very good.<br><br>That's what I think-<br><br>Allen Strange<br><br>*************************************************<br>*             ALLEN STRANGE                     *<br>*===============================================*<br>*        School of Music and Dance              *<br>*        San Jose State University              *<br>*           1 Washington Square                 *<br>*       San Jose, CA USA 95192-0095             *<br>*   vox +408 924-4646  fax +408 924-4773        *<br>*         astrange@email.sjsu.edu               *<br>*  http://www.music.sjsu.edu/Comp/strange.html  *<br>*************************************************</div>
