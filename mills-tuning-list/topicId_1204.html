Some English vocal ensembles (the<br>Hilliard Consort, and Paul Hillier*s Theatre of Voices) have had real<br>success in using hexachordal solfege to control the intonation and get the<br>ficta right, making a convincing case for this historical performance<br>practice. In contrast, I don*t see how the tetrachord is going to help with<br>either intonation or ficta; there is insufficient overlap between the<br>source pythagorean collection and the space of a perfect fourth.<br><br> <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 20 Nov 1996 18:06 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00924; Wed, 20 Nov 1996 18:07:32 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00922<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA05653; Wed, 20 Nov 1996 09:07:30 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 09:07:30 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.961120085015.2750A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
