Although<br>>Paul Erlich used these as an argument for giving 9 a separate<br>>direction<br><br>Did I really argue that way? I thought my reasons for sometimes giving 9<br>a separate direction had nothing to do with saturated chords. Although I<br>may have used a saturated chord as an example of a 9-limit harmony.<br><br>>As there are no 7s, we can use a tetrahedral lattice with 9 at<br>>the apex.  The chords then become:<br>><br>>              5                     5----15<br>>             / \                     \   /<br>>            / 9 \                   9 \ /<br>>           1-----3                     3<br>><br>>Which doesn't look as clear to me.<br><br>I would have to disagree with the way you drew those pictures. The<br>3-limit connection between 3 and 9 is very important, so I would include<br>an additional 9 to the right of 3 in both chords. As I have said before,<br>the disadvantage of giving composites their own axes is that certain<br>notes often have to appear in more than one place in the lattice.<br><br><br>>The reason is that these<br>>anomalous suspensions work because of the compositeness of 9.<br><br>True.<br><br>>A lattice that treats 9 as prime can't show that.<br><br>Unless you put 9 in two places.<br><br>>I can understand why 9 is a separate axis in Erv Wilson's<br>>diagrams.<br><br>In all of his diagrams that I've seen, 9 is NOT a separate axis.<br><br><br>>The way the scales are generated, there's no confusion.<br><br>I'm confused.<br><br>>For general lattices, though, why?  If you want the otonality<br>>to look like a primary unit, how about a double linkage?<br><br>>                        5<br>>                       / \<br>>                      / 7 \<br>>                     1=====3-----9<br><br>Something along those lines might be the best solution, although (I'm<br>assuming you have invisible lines connecting 7 to the other identities)<br>I would still want to have 9 directly connected to 5 and to 7. The<br>advantage of giving 9 its own axis is that such connections can be<br>easily made without a messy tangle of lines.<br><br>>Now, a curved<br>>structure in 5-dimensional space, that might work...<br><br>Right, one where the two occurences of 9 would coincide due to the<br>curvature.</div>
