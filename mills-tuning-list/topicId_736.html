Somehow Brian Mclaren manages<br>>to goad me into defending John Cage, a composer who<br>>has never been in my top 20, and who, I agree with Brian, is<br>>probably overrated. Nonetheless, with so many legitimate<br>>ways to criticize Cage, Mclaren manages to find some bafflingly<br>>inane ones instead.<br><br>You know, I remember occasionally reading something here<br>(usually uttered in Brian's defense after a particularly<br>bilious attack) that things might be different if we only<br>*knew* him instead of the occasionally redlining rant<br>generator who posts under his name from the splended<br>isolation of the Oregonian leftcoast.<br><br>In a similar vein, one must suppose that things are<br>exceptionally bad when one sees the estimable Mr.<br>Lyon rise to Mr. Cage's defense. Having met and actually<br>hobnobbed some with Eric, I can guarantee that seeing<br>him resolutely defending John against the McLarenist<br>screed would bring a smile to your face. It amuses the<br>heck outta me....<br><br>Hey, wait a minute - come to think of it, *I* don't<br>even like Cage all that much, myself. And, come to think of<br>it, have I programmed Cage on my "pimping for High<br>Modernism*" radio program more than Eric's patented<br>electroacoustic rollercoaster rides through the darkness?<br>[pause to fire up web browser]. Nope. They're even over<br>the course of the last programming year. Wait! I'm actually<br>playing the noncanonical Partch recordings, too. Whoops!<br><br>With regards,<br>Gregory<br><br>* http://www.msn.fullfeed.com/~gtaylor/RTQE.html<br><br>_<br>I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,<br>paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only<br>maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it.
