Or were there physical reasons why it could<br>not be done?<br><br>>theorist<br>>Paul Wilson, who claimed that tonal music such as this doesn't work in<br>>JI as well as in 12TET.  Basically, he is saying that the 4:5:6:7 chord<br>>is too stable to provide directed tonal motion to a consonance, and that<br>>moving from complicated (higher-number) sonorities to simpler sonorities<br>>is not interesting enough in itself to sustain a piece of music.<br><br>This sounds like someone who hasn't had a lot of experience with JI and who<br>has a very narrow view of what tonal music is, how motion can be defined,<br>and how interest in music can be created. It sounds like he claims that one<br>can't have a dissonance in JI, which is not true, at least to my own<br>definition of dissonance. By the same token, one could say that it is<br>impossible to have a consonance in 12TET (which does have some truth to it,<br>though your theorist might disagree). To me, tonal music does not<br>necessarily imply harmonic progression towards a goal - that's just what<br>European common-practice music was. Nor does a composer have to employ<br>harmonic progression towards a goal to create interest in a tonal<br>composition. There are often theorists who say that this or that kind of<br>music "can't work," when I think they are finding justifications for their<br>own personal preferences rather than arriving at universal rules<br><br>>Is just-intonation, as Ben Johnston says, indeed adaptable to any style of<br>>music?<br><br>I don't think it's suited for atonal music. I think it reinforces tonality<br>by its very nature, though I am using the term tonality in much more<br>general sense than the "tonal music" of the common-practice period. Lou<br>Harrison says that Schoenberg's great genius was in the realization that<br>12TET leads to atonality by its very nature.<br><br>>Can a composer write JI music that provides tonal motion rather than just<br>>common-tone modulation?  Can this be done with a mere 12 notes or less?<br><br>I don't really understand how "tonal motion" and "common-tone modulation"<br>are considered opposite directions, but I certainly think that JI can<br>support tonal motion. One need only to listen to much of the JI written to<br>hear that. Modulation, of course, is very limited in JI, but only if you<br>want all of your keys to sound the same. If you take the changed quality of<br>the different keys as a new resource, you can turn this to your advantage.<br>Of course the more tones per octave the more possibilities. (I chuckle a<br>bit at the "mere 12 notes" as I have been writing a lot of pentatonic music<br>lately -- now that's a difficult compositional exercise!)<br><br>>If the answer to these is "no", for what style is JI best suited?<br><br>If you listen to some of the compositions being done today, as demonstrated<br>on the Just Intonation Network's samplers, you will hear an enormous<br>variety of styles, though all within what I would call a tonal framework.<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.

There's no doubt that the 4:5:6:7 version of a dominant seventh chord<br>is more dissonant than a 4:5:6 major triad.  Is the reduction of tension from<br>that JI progression enough less than its nearest 12TET equivalent to make it<br>unusable?  I have not found that to be the case at all, but there's no absolute<br>threshold here.  <br><br>   To me though, that sort of a matter-of-degree question ultimately has only<br>limited value.  For example, in sustained chords, there is definite musical<br>meaning to the cleanliness of beatless JI harmonies.  But when you really get<br>down to it, just how big a deal is that?  And how often are chords sustained<br>long enough, and rendered at high enough precision, and in harmonic enough<br>timbres to tell the result from, say, quarter-comma meantone?  <br><br>   Don't get me wrong; of course the precise character of how a new tuning<br>renders existing resources is certainly important.  But it's not as important,<br>in my view, as what all-new resources it offers.<br><br>   From a harmonic perspective, I find it pretty obvious from my recent work<br>that subminor, neutral, and supramajor thirds provide very powerful new musical<br>possibilities.  From a hybrid melodic-harmonic perspective, I find that<br>wandering tonics provide a surprising nontraditional effect.  From a melodic<br>perspective, it's pretty obvious that microtonal melodic steps give sensations<br>from ominous to humorous to irritating.  Certainly they have very big effects on<br>counterpoint as well.<br><br>   But getting away from the mechanics, you pointed out that these new effects<br>were not readily accepted in this case.  Perhaps the most common reason why our<br>audiences wouldn't understand these new effects is that we don't either!<br>Millions of peole have spent thousands of years figuring out what to do with<br>what we now call traditional resources.  Just how realistic is it to think that<br>a handful of people - many of whom are not professional musicians - can find<br>equally powerful ways to use these new resources in a few decades?  <br><br>   And, even if we can, is the idea that these new musical sensations are not<br>always understood really all that surprising?  Ultimately the musical experience<br>is much deeper when we use these new possibilities, but people have a natural<br>tendency to panic when faced with the unusual.  <br><br>   As I pointed out shortly after I joined the tuning list - wow, nearly two<br>years ago it seems! - xenharmonic composers have to be triathletes.  Most of us<br>on the tuning list will listen to microtonal music for that reason alone, but<br>that's not true of audiences in general.  Our music has to be appealing for all<br>of the usual reasons as well as showcasing new and unusual reasons to be<br>appealing.  <br><br>   Many have pointed out that being a 20th century composer is difficult because<br>music of the huge variety of styles is so readily and simultaneously available<br>on radio and CDs.  With so many types to cast it to, it's easier for people to<br>think of it as "kind of like this composer or that composition", rather than<br>something interesting in its own right.  Xenharmonic ideas can help a lot in<br>that regard, because they can make our music sound totally different from the<br>start.  <br><br>   But then we run into the other problem that this wide availability of music<br>causes:  Overload.  People hear so damned much music all around them, that we're<br>down to trying to DISCARD music, rather than mining a rare gem of song from a<br>lute-wielding troubadour wandering through your village.  Our music has to<br>brilliant and appealing for reasons other than the unusual tuning, and that's<br>just terribly difficult to do.  Fun and rewarding, yes, but unequivocally<br>difficult.  <br><br>   Still there certainly are plenty of success stories, so take heart in them<br>too.  We all can learn a lot from the ultimate successes Harry Partch, Ivor<br>Darreg, Other Music, Ben Johnston, and many others.  And perhaps more<br>impressively, the live performers among us.  Johnny Reinhard and his troops have<br>produced many years of microtonal concerts, most very well accepted.  And more<br>recently it seems like hardly a week goes by without Neil Haverstick reporting a<br>case of audiences enjoying the heck out of his gigs.  <br><br>   So, to oversummarize, we're taking on a difficult task here, so success<br>depends on focusing on the right aspects of the task, and presenting the focused<br>image in a way that audiences can relate.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 9 Nov 1995 06:53 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id UAA27566; Wed, 8 Nov 1995 20:53:43 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 8 Nov 1995 20:53:43 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01530501acc7382a32b9@[199.212.154.44]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
