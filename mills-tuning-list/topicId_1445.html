In conversation with Daniel Jones it <br>became apparent that he knew technically what he was doing--tuning pairs <br>and trios of strings for beatlessness, and tuning the pedals and levers <br>appropriately. Does anyone here know of any articles on non 12tet pedal <br>steel guitar tunings, or recordings of "just" pedal steel?<br>	On another subject, I have downloaded Shockwave digital audio streaming<br>software, (allows "high fidelity" real time audio transmission over the <br>web, and the player's free) <br><br>http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/<br><br>and I am pretty happy with the sound (the best sounding audio streaming I <br>have heard so far), although the streaming is intermittant (maybe I <br>haven't adjusted everything properly yet). I think this technology might <br>be useful as a tool to get the sounds of microtonal music out to the <br>public. Has anyone used the shockwave audio encoder? Any opinions?<br><br>	Also, I e-mailed Justonics twice regarding price and availability <br>of their just intonation software and received no response. Does anyone <br>here have any updates on what these folks are doing? Is the software <br>available at all yet?<br><br> John Starrett <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 28 Dec 1996 21:53 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04161; Sat, 28 Dec 1996 21:56:36 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04163<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA05035; Sat, 28 Dec 1996 12:56:33 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 28 Dec 1996 12:56:33 -0800<br>Message-Id: <32C588C4.21F6@ix.netcom.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
