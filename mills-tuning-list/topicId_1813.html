If so, my apologies.<br><br>I'm afraid you are; but this isn't the only problem. <br><br>> A previous writer, quoted by Gary Morrison, wrote:<br>> <br>> "ergo, the distinction between C# and Db makes sense<br>> _only_ in well temperament. But of course, you can't<br>> set two different temperaments at once, at least not<br>> on a piano."<br><br>In what we earthlings call "well-temperament", there is no possible <br>distinction between C# and Db -- everyone knows this on our planet. The <br>well-tempered systems were specifically designed for a 12-note per <br>octave keyboard; they were WELL-tempered specifically because they <br>removed the wolf of the meantone temperaments, and this was by means of <br>closing the "circle" of fifths. No closed temperament offering only 12 <br>pitch classes can possibly distinguish between and C# and Db -- this is <br>a bland truism on planet earth.<br><br><br>Then Gary Morrison himself:<br><br>>    Welll...<br>> <br>>    Certainly C# and Db are different in meantone temperaments and just<br>> intonation as well as in well temperaments.  And also in 17TET, 19TET <br>> and 31TET as well.<br><br>Meantone, yup.<br><br>Just intonation, sure thing. Pythagorean too.<br><br>19TET and 31TET, if you treat them as closures of 1/3-comma and <br>1/4-comma meantone, yessir. 17TET, I suppose, can also be regarded as <br>the closure of a chain of fifths.<br><br>But well-temperament? NO! (in 72-point Gothic font)<br><br>What's going on here? Has someone just devised an all new well-tempered <br>scheme for >12 pitch classes?<br><br>>    But even if they are tuned exactly the same as they are in 12TET or<br>> 24TET, the two notes are functionally different.  C# is nominally the<br>> leading tone in the key of D, and Db ... well, Db could be a number of<br>> formulations, like the seventh of a dominant seventh in the key of Ab, <br>> or the root of a Neapolitan in C.<br> <br>For the record, when I introduced this Beethoven example, I said that he <br>was talking about KEYS and not single pitches. I was saying that <br>Beethoven distinguished various keys, assigning them characteristics of <br>their own, and that we might be tempted to guess that well-temperament <br>was the main or sole cause of Beethoven's distinctions. But then I said <br>that we cannot simply ignore one of his distinctions, namely between C# <br>major and Db major; since this distinction cannot arise in any <br>well-temperament, Beethoven's thinking must have been motivated, at <br>least in part by less concrete considerations, such as the accumulated <br>associations of certain keys with certain pieces, or the association of <br>certain instruments with their most congenial keys, or relational <br>associations depending on the difference between modulating in a <br>flat-wards direction and in a sharp-wards direction. This is only a <br>paraphrase of what I said in two earlier messages.<br><br>-- <br>Jonathan Walker<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 10 Mar 1997 15:00 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00517; Mon, 10 Mar 1997 15:00:19 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00515<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id FAA19976; Mon, 10 Mar 1997 05:58:46 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 10 Mar 1997 05:58:46 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3323F940.D9C@cavehill.dnet.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5045 href="#5045">ðŸ”—</a>rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz (Ray Tomes)</h3><span>3/10/1997 6:32:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>William Sethares <sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu> wrote:<br><br>>A few years ago, Tom Staley and I wrote an article called "Sounds of <br>>Crystals" in Experimental Musical Instruments (EMI) that did <br>>something very similar (ref. below).
