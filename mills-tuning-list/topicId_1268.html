A quick glance at<br>_Silence_ will show that he initially rejected the name, completely aware<br>of the scientific use of the term which he felt inapplicable to his work.<br>The name, used by the press and some academics, did stick - much as<br>_minimalism_ has stuck to a later group of composers - and Cage accepted<br>this under the limited definition, that _experimental music_ involved a way<br>of working where aspects of the outcome were unforeseen by the composer.<br>Cage was always seeking a way of generating new or surprising music. Since<br>so much of MacLarenï¿½s own music ends up in a self-similar new-agey wash, I<br>suggest that he try chance operations in order to avoid some of the effects<br>of his own tastes or habits. In any case, in future postings, he best do<br>his homework and read what his target has actually said before attacking in<br>valuable computer time.<br><br>I myself have found it very useful to use chance operations in exploring<br>unfamilar tonal environments, and in one case, to determine the intonation<br>of a work. What is abundantly clear about any such algorithmic method is,<br>however, that the establishment of a division of responsibility between<br>composerly choices and a random procedure requires extremely deep thinking.<br>Anyone who has heard the Arditti quartet perrform Cageï¿½s _FOUR_, or _Music<br>for 4_. or _Thirty Pieces for String Quartet_ has surely realized that Cage<br>was asking extremely deep and musical questions, and exploring a larger<br>scale of musical form than is familiar. <br><br>Daniel Wolf, Frankfurt<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 28 Nov 1996 12:24 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10692; Thu, 28 Nov 1996 12:26:23 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10702<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id DAA02453; Thu, 28 Nov 1996 03:26:20 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 28 Nov 1996 03:26:20 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009AC0AF219BA7E0.4E30@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
