Later French physicists rounded this<br>to 300 tones. This tuning is named after Savart, a physicist, but I<br>don't if he actually developed the system. Both the 301 and 301 system<br>are sometimes called Savarts, the latter rationalized Savarts.<br><br>Pikler had an article on this in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of<br>America in the 60's.<br><br>BTW, Yasser used the cycle of 600 (centitones), Ellis invented Cents.<br>Pikler is a very good source for various logarithmic measures.<br><br>The late composer and electronic music pioneer proposed the cycle if<br>1728 tones/octave (12 cubed) in base-12 notation, though I don't know<br>if the idea is original with him. I came up with some not altogether<br>serious suggestions in bases 8, 16, 20, etc. and put them in a past<br>issue of XH.<br><br>--John</div>
