Wim Hoogewerf played three works that<br>were stunning.  The nearest experience for me was listening to J.S. Bach's<br>Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue in D minor in Werckmeister III.<br><br>French citizen Wim Hoogewerf was the a featured guitarist this AFMM season<br>and his individually moveable fretlets alow for many new possibilities.<br>Following the outlining of the cover of PITCH I:1 (AFMM produced), Wim set<br>up a tuning for Dowland with certain chords completely just, and with<br>others in varying shades of delicious support.<br><br>All concerts were recorded with most videotaped.
