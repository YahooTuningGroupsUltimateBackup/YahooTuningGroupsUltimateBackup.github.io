I obviously have no shame...<br><br>   Amusingly I got into unusual tunings under similar circumstances as Mr.<br>Jeude.  I too was in high school (in Clear Lake City down by NASA in Houston),<br>when a friend told me about the twelfth root of two.  For me that was about 20<br>years ago as well (I graduated from HS in 1979).  I then wondered about what<br>would happen if you use the tenth root of two instead, obviously producing 10TET<br>tuning.  <br><br>   I decided to explore it through guitars, which was a little bit of a<br>departure from my upbringing in that I almost entirely listened to and played<br>classical music, and had very little exposure to classical guitar at the time<br>(although I learned to play it reasonably well after college).  Guitars were<br>more of a pop music instrument in my mind.  Anyway, I figured out how to<br>calculate fret positions (pretty easy), built an acoustic guitar and bass from<br>kits and fretted them to 10TET.  I then entered the results in the science fair,<br>the physics of vibrating strings being the scientific connection, and did rather<br>well.  <br><br>   After that, the fellow who played the "decimal bass" in my 10TET demo tapes<br>showed me Ivor Darreg's article in Guitar Player magazine about 19-, 22-, and<br>31-tone guitars.  That was the first time I had concrete knowledge of anybody<br>else having worked at all formally with nontraditional tunings (although in all<br>fairness 19, 22, and 31 are moderately traditional as microtonal tunings go).<br>Ivor then connected me up with John Chalmers who was living in Houston then, and<br>we met over that science fair.  John of course is active on the list.  It's<br>kinda wild to think that about 20 years after we first met, he hooked me up to<br>the list.  <br><br>   For the following year's science fair, I did the same basic idea for some<br>small flutes, following Boehm's ideas.  That resulting science fair project took<br>me out to the International Fair held that year in Anaheim, coincidentally not<br>too far from where Ivor lived, in Glendale at the time.  That's when I met him,<br>Erv Wilson, and Glen Prior.  <br><br>   The next year (12th grade), I designed a two-voiced pulse-wave-only digital<br>synthesizer from about a hundred SSI and MSI chips, and outfit it on a big<br>wire-wrap board with an unusual controller appropriate for a wide variety of<br>tunings, interfaced it to a single-board 6502 computer (this was a little before<br>the Apple II days).  It could play in most any tuning of up to 31 notes per<br>octave.  <br><br>   Despite its intricacy, it only won second place in the regional (Houston<br>vicinity) fair.  The guy who won first place was very good indeed.  But that<br>gave me my professional career direction, working in computers now for Motorola<br>in Austin, in the group that's working on what the 68000 is evolving into.  <br><br>   But music is still my main fascination in life, and well, you folks have seen<br>my endless babblings about 88CET tuning...  I currently work mostly with an<br>Ensoniq ASR-10 sequencing from my Mac IIfx running EMagic's "Logic" sequencer.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 15 Mar 1996 11:46 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id CAA15420; Fri, 15 Mar 1996 02:46:16 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 15 Mar 1996 02:46:16 -0800<br>Message-Id: <960315104004_71670.2576_HHB33-6@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
