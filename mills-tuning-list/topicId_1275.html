I disagree with him, but a list like this is not the<br>place to carry on a detailed argument. <br><br>One curiosity, however. He mentions a number of professor types who he<br>thinks are OK, against the vast hordes whom he excoriates. Rightly or<br>wrongly isn't the issue. He then goes on to say that these few are the<br>exceptions that prove the rule. Most people, Brian included (I believe--<br>but he'll have to tell us), think that exceptions prove rules in the sense<br>of confirming them. Now this is a peculiar logic--in which the opposite of<br>something confirms its truth. But how many exceptions do we need to prove<br>their opposite?  One? A hundred? A majority? <br><br>I believe that the word "prove" here is to be used in a different sense<br>only, "to test." In this sense, exceptions do prove rules, and the saying<br>then makes sense. But popular usage has taken this one away from its<br>meaning into nonsense.  Lots of what we say is nonsense, I'm sure Brian<br>would agree... <br><br>Just to make this allowable on a tuning forum, I don't think the<br>exceptions of a (relatively) few microtonal pieces prove (establish) the<br>superiority of 12-tET. But they certainly prove it, don't they? (Test it,<br>I mean!)<br><br>On a different topic, thanks to all the "lurkers" (terrible term: how<br>about "non-posting readers") for writing in recently. Lots of you<br>newcomers are 'way beyond me. <br><br>Paul Rapoport<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 29 Nov 1996 06:57 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11031; Fri, 29 Nov 1996 06:59:06 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11068<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id VAA10163; Thu, 28 Nov 1996 21:59:04 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 28 Nov 1996 21:59:04 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3.0.32.19961128212357.0068ac2c@adnc.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4202 href="#4202">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/1996 8:37:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> So please, people, stop quoting authority figures.<br><br>   I found that statement especially curious, since, of all the people on this<br>list, brian is almost certainly the biggest on quoting other peoples' research.<br>Presumably the issue he's raising here is not with the word "quoting", but with<br>the word "authority".  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 1 Dec 1996 17:36 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13545; Sun, 1 Dec 1996 17:38:22 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13585<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA27401; Sun, 1 Dec 1996 08:38:20 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 1 Dec 1996 08:38:20 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961201163524_71670.2576_HHB20-5@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
