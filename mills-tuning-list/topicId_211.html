Bach mastered<br>the tonal system, but few composers today can say that they have mastered<br>any non-12 tunings.  (If you have, congratulations!)  There's so much to be<br>learned about it; entire worlds of possibilities exist.  <br>	The intellectual systems of a medium in an art form must be<br>internalized before they can produce really great art.  I think it was Dennis <br>Eberhard who said that a composer must learn the musical past so well that he <br>can internalize it and not think about it consciously.  Whatever system of <br>tuning (or compositional method, for that matter) a composer is using, it must <br>be learned so well that he doesn't have to think about how the system works.    <br>Then the humanity and emotion can be communicated through that system.<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Morgan Ellington Smith	 	|	When all else fails, <br>smithme@hiramb.hiram.edu	|	lower your standards.<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 4 Dec 1995 04:22 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id SAA09289; Sun, 3 Dec 1995 18:22:44 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 3 Dec 1995 18:22:44 -0800<br>Message-Id: <951204022010_71670.2576_HHB43-2@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
