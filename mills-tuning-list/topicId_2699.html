It makes various<br>alterations to MIDI files that may be useful to those working<br>with alternative tunings.  It's written for DOS, but I've<br>included the C++ source code, and it should compile for any<br>platform.<br><br>The features are:<br><br>Retuning a file using pitch bends.  This is an afterthought,<br>and probably not as slick as Scala, but it doesn't touch the<br>file type which someone wanted recently.<br><br>Taking a piece in a non octave scale, and splitting it into a<br>number of different octave scales on different channels.  This<br>is something Brian McLaren specifically asked for, and seems<br>to be useful for some sample based synths.<br><br>Converting a piece in an equal temperament into a number of<br>smaller ETs on different tracks.<br><br>More general channel/note mappings.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed) <br>Subject:  Testing the Tropez Plus tuning dumps<br>PostedDate:  29-11-97 17:09:44<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  29-11-97 17:08:09-29-11-97 17:08:09,29-11-97 17:08:06-29-11-97 17:08:06<br>DeliveredDate:  29-11-97 17:08:06<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125655E.00589F4C; Sat, 29 Nov 1997 17:07:59 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02084; Sat, 29 Nov 1997 17:09:44 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 29 Nov 1997 17:09:44 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02082<br>Received: (qmail 17392 invoked from network); 29 Nov 1997 08:09:18 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 29 Nov 1997 08:09:18 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.844987@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
