There are brief passages, by Emil Richards, I <br>believe, on one of Ervin Wilson's metallophones in 22-tet. <br>It has a rather high pitched, metallic sound and is very <br>effective in context.<br><br>I'll try to get a more complete story from Erv.<br><br>Some of Henry S. Rosenthal's films have had JI soundtracks, <br>but these are art films and unfortunately not widely distributed. <br>David Doty should have the details. (David?)<br><br>The best example I know of of a film with significant microtonal<br>music is "The Giving," which has a Stephen James Taylor's score.<br>Taylor makes extensive use of Wilson's hebdomekontany and other<br>scales. <br><br>--John</div>
