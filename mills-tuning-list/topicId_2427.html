But, maybe<br>I've found a way...<br><br>There is a difference between compositional models and methods of<br>performance.  Musicians will always play things differently between one<br>another, and between performances.  My high school choir sang in crappy<br>5-limit JI.  The only things that play in 12:2 equal are a few pianos, some<br>guitars, and many synthesizers.  No band, choir, or orchestra performs in<br>12-tone.  Why do you think piano concertos sound so bad?<br><br>Actually, all music is microtonal (unless it's played on a hammond organ or<br>a very special additive synthesizer) because of the harmonics!  Yeah!<br><br>The point of JI is that it offers an expanded compositional model.  Music<br>composed in such a model will no doubt be played in all sorts of ways by the<br>musicians of the future.  An understanding of tuning is not a prerequisite<br>for playing this music, as DFinnamore@aol.com suggests; our future musicians<br>will be making more powerful music because it will be based on a more<br>powerful model.<br><br>If we can agree that there is a difference between re-tuning music made for<br>100 cent equal, as powerful a model and good-sounding a tuning as it is, and<br>playing music made for 7+ limit Just Intonation, however embellished, then<br>maybe we can be free to appreciate the excellent musicianship that thrives<br>in every idiom the world over.<br><br>Carl<br><br>Postscript:  I get more milage from BBshop than Mr. Szanto, and I'm<br>wondering what "4tet fan" means.<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu<br>Subject:  Re: pop and tunings<br>PostedDate:  23-09-97 19:05:50<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  23-09-97 19:05:37-23-09-97 19:05:38,23-09-97 19:04:44-23-09-97 19:04:44<br>DeliveredDate:  23-09-97 19:04:44<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C125651B.005DE293; Tue, 23 Sep 1997 19:05:28 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12692; Tue, 23 Sep 1997 19:05:50 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 23 Sep 1997 19:05:50 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12678<br>Received: (qmail 21077 invoked from network); 23 Sep 1997 17:05:42 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 23 Sep 1997 17:05:42 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01510102b04d418a6709@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
