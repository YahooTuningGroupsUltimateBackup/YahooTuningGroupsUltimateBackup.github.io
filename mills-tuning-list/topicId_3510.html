However, for the time domains relevant for the ear's<br>>> analysis, this does not lead to any relevant alterations in the<br>>> frequencies of the partials.<br><br>>So, you're presumably still with exact integer ratios.  Maybe, though,<br>>you mean that pitch fluctuations place a lower limit on the pitch<br>>precision that is meaningful, and that inharmonicity is below this<br>>threshold.  It isn't clear.<br><br>Put it this way: although analysis of a signal into frequency components<br>with constant amplitude has a unique solution, analysis of a signal into<br>frequency components with varying amplitude doesn't. In the typical case<br>the variations in amplitude will be slow enough so that any inharmonic<br>frequencies that might come up in the latter, non-unique mode of<br>analysis would be too close together to be resolved by the ear. What I'm<br>suggesting is that the ear in fact does the latter and hears a harmonic<br>series with changing amplitudes, rather than inharmonicity.<br><br>>If you're now saying that inharmonicities of a fraction of a cent are<br>>not physically impossible, I'm happy to concur with that.  My guess<br>>would be less than 0.1 cents, although I have no proof of that, and<br>>would like some.  Hopefully, we can stop theorising and wait for some<br>>more data.<br><br>Again, with the amplitude fluctuations, you can't pin the frequencies<br>down in a well-defined way. However, I'm saying that for wind, brass,<br>and bowed string instruments, it would be consistent to assume that you<br>have exact integer overtones with a particular amplitude spectrum for<br>each one (plus noise). Such an assumption would not differ from the<br>ear's own interpretation in any meaningful way.<br><br>>>>Any noise in the input will cause peaks at the resonant modes.<br><br>>> They are not really "peaks" so much as "hills" since there are no<br>>> constructively interfering standing waves to sharpen them. While the<br>>> noise energy will be spread throughout the spectrum, the energy from<br>the<br>>> driver (reed, lips, bow) will manifest in Dirac-delta-function-like<br>>> peaks at harmonic overtones in the spectrum.<br><br>>Why couldn't they be reinforced by standing waves?<br><br>The driving force has to be in phase with the reflected wave for a<br>resonant standing pattern to develop. In noise, there is no phase<br>regularity whatsoever.<br><br>>If the noise<br>>provides a constant impulse at all frequencies, that should lead to<br>>peaks at the resonances<br><br>Hills, yes.<br><br>>like with a flute, maybe still corrected by an<br>>order of magnitude towards harmonicity.<br><br>No, not like a flute. A flute tone is not just selectively amplified<br>noise. The turbulent airflow that is responsible for the driving force<br>of a flute is not fully understood, but is definitely more regular than<br>just noise.<br><br>>Whether this means two peaks<br>>occur close together, or the original peak is shifted slightly, I don't<br>>know.<br><br>In the ideal of an infinitely long sampling time, the original peaks are<br>Dirac delta functions, while the hills of noise remain hills, so the<br>former are not shifted at all.<br><br>>I'm not deliberately causing trouble here, only I usually agree with you<br>>and it distresses me when I don't.  Hopefully, this was just a problem<br>>of expression, and we can put it all behind us, marching defiantly<br>>towards a better future.<br><br>Yes!<br><br>>> Listen, Gary and I have been defining systematic inharmonicity as<br>cases<br>>> where, after the noise is removed, the partials deviate from a<br>harmonic<br>>> series. Since noise doesn't exhibit interference effects, the only<br>>> inharmonicity relevant to JI is systematic inharmonicity.<br><br>>I can't find this definition anywhere.  I was assuming "systematic"<br>>meant the deviation from integers had to be constant from one cycle to<br>>the next.<br><br>Well, we both mentioned noise as an extraneous factor at various points<br>in the discussion. So the definition was implicit.<br><br>>The inharmonicity in the resonances is caused by the holes being there<br><br>As well as end effects even when all the holes are closed.</div>
