Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/1998 12:57:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>In my design, which is similar to the<br>>rectangular form above, lengths are proportional<br>>to the prime's place in the prime series, and<br>>angles are representative of circular "octave"<br>>pitch deployment for each interval. <br><br>On Monzo's diagram, only the tones whose interval with 1/1 has a prime<br>number in the numerator and a power of two in the denominator have<br>angles representative of circular "octave" pitch. All other intervals,<br>including composites with a power of two in the denominator, will not<br>have the correct angle. Therefore, Monzo's diagrams have no real<br>advantage over standard rectangular lattices or any other projection<br>thereof. However, I feel strongly about the advantage of triangular over<br>rectangular lattices, and one could certainly use Monzo's angles in<br>constructing a triangular lattice (but why would one?).<br><br>One way of determining what angles to use that makes more sense that<br>Monzo's proposal is Canright's (in his web article Harmonic-Melodic<br>Diagrams or something -- John Starrett's page is down right now so I<br>can't tell you the address). Although Canright uses a rectangular-type<br>lattice, aditional connections can easily be drawn to make it into a<br>triangular lattice. Canright derives the lengths and angles to use in<br>his lattice so that  the position of the tones along a certain direction<br>will correspond to the pitch of the tones. This works for all the tones,<br>not just the ones at certain special intervals from 1/1, while Monzo's<br>circular pitch is only correct for a few tones. So, given Monzo's<br>willingness to have arbitrary angles in his diagram, and desire to<br>depict pitch relationships, he would be better served by Canright's<br>approach.</div>
