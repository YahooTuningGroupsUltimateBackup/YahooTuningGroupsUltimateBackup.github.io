In some if not most<br><pelogs I've studied, 2-6 can be more than 50 cents narrower<br><than a 3/2.<br><br>In the central Javanese palace instruments<br>(cf the Gadja Mada study), this average is<br>indeed around 665 cents. However, since so many modern<br>instruments copy the RRI Solo tuning, with essentially<br>a slendro kempyang ('fifth') of 721 cents, we may being<br>witnessing one way in which a tuning trend develops. =<br><br><br>To confuse the matter even more, rebab players usually try<br>to tune 6 to the tumbuk and 2 a beatless fifth below. Most<br>players then identify this 2 as pelog rather than slendro! =<br><br><br><It seems generally to be slightly flatter than the 1-5<br><and 3-7 dyads, even though it is, in Javanese<br><theory, the same interval.<br><br>As I read Javanese theorists, 'interval'<br>(Gembyang/Kempyang) is a number of keys on a<br>metallophone, not a acoustic ratio. Martopangrawit<br>did in fact distinguish between a given interval<br>between keys on an instrument and an 'acoustic'<br>interval (i.e pelog kempyang 3-i is identified as<br>not being an acoustic kempyang). Pak Hardi talks<br>about kempyang in functional terms and then<br>identifies which kempyang he prefers to be 'mleng'<br>or 'pleng' (beatless).<br>   =<br><br>< I also question whether 1-2 is always smaller<br><than 2-3, and whether 4-6 is always or even usually<br><larger than an 8/7.<br><br>Since at least the second half of the last century<br>instruments consistantly have 1-2 smaller than 2-3.<br><br>I selected the 8/7 based on remarks of many<br>players in both Yogya and Solo that on a tubuk 6<br>gamelan P4 could be the same as but not higher than<br>S5. My initial set of conditions made reference<br>to Slendro, but I wanted to try it without.<br><br>>...4 is a subsidiary<br>>tone in pelog lima, an alternate to 3; and some<br>>gendhing use all 7 tones; so the boundaries between<br>>the three "keys" are not strict.  =<br><br><br>I find myself continuously rethinking how one divides<br>the pelog repertoire. The three pathet division does<br>apply to a large chunk of the repertoire in terms<br>of techniques used on the elaborating instruments<br>(which don't have pitch 4) where the<br>tone pelog is sometimes a substitute for 3 and<br>sometimes takes a scalar function in the sequence<br>4-5-6 parallel to that of 1 in the sequence 1-2-3. =<br><br><br>While most of the seven tone repertoire (i.e.<br>Solonese gendhing bonangan and Yogya gendhing soran)<br>can be analysed as modulating locally to one of<br>the five tone sets that I identified or a 4 for 3<br>substitution, there are uses<br>of 4 as a kind of chromatic tone (particularly in<br>contemporary Lagu Dolanan), a kind of 'pelog pathet<br>slendro' where both 3 and 4 are used, and sometimes<br>pitch 7 is introduced in the absence of a high 1.<br><br>I may be entirely wrong about this, but I imagine<br>these 'chromatic' uses of the residua from the =<br><br>tuning method to be like Skryabin, Slonimsky or<br>Bartok inventing new scales or Harry Partch playing<br>chromatic scales or 'octaves' on the chromelodeon.<br>(Or, for that matter, Doug Leedy's meantone black-<br>key slendro). The best evidence I have for this,<br>in the absence of rebab and voices in gendhing<br>bonangan/soran. =<br><br><br><Condition (7) must be met for pitches 2 and 6<br><after fixing pitches 3 and 7.<br><br>This can be reversed. I believe in practice that<br>2 and 6 are set first and then 3 and 7 set with<br>checks of 3 against 5 and 6 and 2 against 7. =<br><br><br><Are you looking specifically for small-number ratios?<br><br>No, but if someone does come up with a just solution<br>(I lean toward the view that these tunings are kinds<br>of 'well temperaments'), I would be _very_ interested<br>in hearing it.<br><br><To guarantee a functional pelog, I wonder if you<br><might also need to constrain the 6-7 interval<br><(already >80 cents, but usually a good deal<br><larger), and possibly the 3-4 (usually at least<br><twice as large as 4-5).<br><br>These are already satisfied by setting 1-3 and 1-5.<br><br>As you can read from your table, the results are<br>still broad enough to include, for example, a 12tet<br>phrygian scale. =<br><br><br>Can you imagine any additional constraints to narrow this? =</div>
