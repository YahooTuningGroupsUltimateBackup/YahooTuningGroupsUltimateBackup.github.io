Still, we do the men of the past a<br>gross injustice to pretend that their minds were closed in matters of<br>intonation, or for that matter of diatonicism versus chromaticism or<br>enharmonicism. With all its crowds of artists more interested in<br>shocking than moving (nor do I find this love of flamboyance wholly an<br>unsympathetic attitude), the really closed-minded century has been our<br>own, with its Hitlerian insistence on the 12-tone equal temperament.<br><br>In reaction to this, we now suffer (a few of us) from the opposite error<br>to having a closed mind, which is to cherish a mind so flaccidly open<br>that one denies all universal principles, or the possibility of such<br>principles. To make (for once) a sweeping statement, such an attitude is<br>abhorrent to art, and would have been viewed with horror and disdain by<br>every Great Western (or Eastern) Composer who has ever lived. This<br>brings to mind Oscar Wilde's delicious remark (I quote from memory): "To<br>find all styles in art equally good is to betray the soul of an<br>auctioneer." People who fall into this error often compound their error<br>- human nature being what it is - by imagining that it is a viable<br>option for a musical culture to have _no_ universal tuning or even any<br>favored set of _similar_tunings. Each musical artist would then have to<br>reinvent his own musical language from scratch.<br><br>This is as if each poet had to invent his own language. We should then<br>perhaps have strange new poetries ? most of them pathetically valueless<br>and inept, a few<br>of them perhaps (within a narrow sphere) exquisitely beautiful. But the<br>latter class of languages and poetries would be precisely those that<br>most closely imitate some one (or several) of the 'natural' languages<br>and known cultures.<br><br>In the real world, poets ? sane, serious, level-headed, money-grubbing,<br>great poets ? do not invent their own language. The most they try to do,<br>is to bend a little to one side the great common possession of mankind,<br>language.<br><br>Though the analogy is not perfect of course, music is essentially in the<br>like case. The composer who announces that he has found a marvelous<br>tuning that, by the way... doesn't stoop so low as to give consonant<br>fifths and thirds within a single coherent system... is like the English<br>poet who announces that he is banning all words with more than four<br>letters from his verse. The thing might be possible ? but why bother? I<br>can state with _absolute_ finality, and with divine closed-mindedness,<br>that such poetry would be drivel.<br><br>On the list, I believe someone ? by no means devoid of understanding ?<br>said that "Gibson's preference for mean-tone temperaments is<br>well-established" as if there are any others worth discussing (for<br>long). Well, there is just intonation and Pythagoreanism, but they are<br>not temperaments. There are 22- 29- 41- & 53-tone equal, but I do hope<br>that by now I have explained why these 'temperaments' are valueless, for<br>they cast out the consonant thirds from their tonal fabric as soon as<br>one tries to preserve the consonant fifths.<br><br>When one knows nothing of the matter of tuning, the choice of a tuning<br>appears purely arbitrary, but the more one learns of the principles that<br>govern music ? all human music ? the more one realizes that, although<br>there is incredible tuning variation within human music, there is also a<br>very obvious and powerful tendency toward just intonation, or rather,<br>toward some system that shall preserve the advantages of just<br>intonation, while remedying its defects, and if possible even adding to<br>its available melodico-harmonic resources, especially in conjunct music<br>of very limited compass, where sheer dead-reckoning can be used to sing<br>and understand intervals outside the realm of just intonation. And note<br>that the variation in human tuning systems _is concentrated_ in<br>precisely this domain of conjunct music within limited compass. As soon<br>as cultures move out of this domain, and also as soon as they use<br>harmony, just intonation assumes a compelling r?le in their tuning<br>systems.<br><br>Some may imagine that ? falling into that habit of the human mind which<br>causes us to become passionately attached to whatever we much use, and<br>to which we ally our own vanity ? I advocate 19-tone equal as a kind of<br>obsession or quest for notoriety, etc. This is not so. I dislike<br>notoriety very much, and wish someone else would promote the most<br>essential ideas that I have presented, leaving me free to my poetry and<br>my music, only no one has, at least so far as I know, in the requisite<br>depth and with the suitable insistence. My own artistic vanity happens<br>to be more attached to poetry than to music, and it is a matter of<br>personal indifference to me whether anyone uses 19-tone equal or not. I<br>do rather pity those who do not.<br><br>But I have already presented some very strong evidence which suggests<br>that 19-tone equal is _uniquely_ close to the tendencies of human<br>intonation, and also far, far richer in real, usable, melodic ? and<br>therefore, granted the presence of consonances, in harmonic ? resources.<br>These are almost certainly facts, and will not be shaked. There are<br>exceptions, there are caveats... but the trend is as clear as the<br>daylight.<br><br>I have much more evidence, better suited for a book ? a 10,000 page book<br>? than for this forum.<br><br>I would like to suggest that no one, whether they happen to like my<br>personality or not, should deny himself the pleasure of carefully<br>exploring the 19-tone equal in a variety of musical styles. This surely<br>is bigger than matters of personality. BTW, I have a notion that<br>Schoenberg would have been fascinated with the 19-tone equal, had anyone<br>explained its potentialities to him.<br><br>Finally, I wish to state again that the masses, although seemingly<br>ignorant of and indifferent to tuning questions, are, like it or not,<br>our masters. The most imperious dictator who ever lived, the haughtiest<br>aristocrat who ever breathed, lives in nightmarish fear of popular<br>ridicule. The people ? our own, Western people especially ? exert a<br>potent influence, via popular melody and musical instrument makers (to<br>name just two influences) on the choice of tuning, and on all music.<br>Those who refuse to decide on a universal tuning, and consider the<br>notion tyrannical, closed-minded, limiting, etc will merely have the<br>choice of a universal tuning made _for_ them, most probably in favor of<br>12-tone equal, but one day, most probably, in favor of 19-tone equal.<br>The latter should prima facie interest microtonalists more than the<br>former.<br><br>I have already spent far too much time here ? it is rather addictive,<br>and I have corrected several errors or incompletions in my theories by<br>reading the list ? but I hope I have offered some ideas of value.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Reply to Paul Ehrlich<br>PostedDate:  20-12-97 05:42:22<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  20-12-97 05:40:12-20-12-97 05:40:13,20-12-97 05:39:48-20-12-97 05:39:48<br>DeliveredDate:  20-12-97 05:39:48<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256573.0019A640; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 05:42:05 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22476; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 05:42:22 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 20 Dec 1997 05:42:22 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22460<br>Received: (qmail 11744 invoked from network); 19 Dec 1997 20:42:19 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 19 Dec 1997 20:42:19 -0800<br>Message-Id: <349BAF35.7E0D@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
