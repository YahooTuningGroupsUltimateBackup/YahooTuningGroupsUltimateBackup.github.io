Especially to<br> Kami for your formula. Quite difficult for a guy like me but will try hard to<br> get the image. Thanks also to Manuel for MAX info. I'm wondering why that sof<br>tware doesn't have a function that let the user directly get the Hz he wants. <br>I hear that the program has a lot to do with IRCAM....then why? To buy MAC-MAX<br> system to start some kind of self-composing-alternative-tuning-music or not..<br>..that is a problem for me right now.<br><br>   Ammm...one more selfish question. I'm using QUADERNO33 and it only has 4MB <br>MEMand a strange dsp for PCM recording. Playing .wav is the only way to make t<br>his machine act musically. Any suggestion to make this TOY play a alternative-<br>tuning things......well, mission impossible....maybe souldn't have asked. Actu<br>ally I downloaded SCALA and......you know how it resulted...ha ha(half crying)<br><br>    A little bit away from this list's theme but .....how come could you get i<br>nformed of Japanese Quiz program? Are those things popular? Talking about the <br>TARZAN thing Johnny had mentioned.
