If the chord occurs as a result of<br>>simultaneous melodic lines in a piece of music, I don't think you're right,<br>>unless you'd allow 20 cents to be considered a few cents. If you're listening<br>>for beats, then yes, you're exactly right.<br>><br>>    >All of the above depends strongly on timbre<br>><br>>Amen. Volume as well.<br>><br>>    >The idea that dissonance increases with prime limit is<br>>    >erroneous.<br>><br>>I agree. The odd limit is a much better indicator. I bought a copy of<br>>Partch's book while in San Francisco (I last read it many years ago) and on<br>>virtually every page there is evidence, often strong, emphatic evidence, that<br>>his definition of "limit" was the odd, not prime, definition. All the Partch<br>>"experts" using the prime definition frustrate me to no end as they clearly<br>>have not listened as much as Partch and yet fail to understand the ideas he<br>>derived from years of listening. And for those using the prime limit<br>>definition to describe the resources of a tuning system rather than<br>>consonance/dissonance issues, what information is contained in the knowledge<br>>of the highest prime one is using that is more important than knowing any of<br>>the other primes one is or is not using?<br>><br>>>The 3-5-7 limits happen to get progressively out<br>>>of tune in 12tet, though, which may be the origin of this.<br>><br>>3, 5 and 7 are successive odd numbers, so I don't think one has to resort to<br>>12tet to explain the increasing dissonance of their respective intervals<br>>(which I clearly hear). However, since you're using a "prime," not "odd"<br>>definition, of limit, I think you're right; for example, 9:8 and 16:9 are<br>>more familiar, due to 12tet conditioning, than 8:7 and 7:4, but the latter<br>>would be more consonant if one could erase the conditioning. Many who cannot<br>>undo their conditioning therefore conclude that prime limit 3 is more<br>>consonant than prime limit 7, but I would say that this is not true; it is<br>>only true that odd limit 3 is more consonant that odd limit 7. Odd limit 9 is<br>>naturally slightly more dissonant that odd limit 7, though this ordering may<br>>be culturally altered. However, what is considered "in tune" and "out of<br>>tune" may have much more to do with familiar scalar intervals than familiar<br>>harmonic intervals, and some pure 7s hidden in inner voices will sound just<br>>fine to even the most culturally conditioned of listeners.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  William Sethares <sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Subject:  psychoacoustic foundations<br>PostedDate:  28-10-97 16:15:45<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  28-10-97 16:14:52-28-10-97 16:14:53,28-10-97 15:15:27-28-10-97 15:15:28<br>DeliveredDate:  28-10-97 15:15:28<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125653E.0053BE30; Tue, 28 Oct 1997 16:14:41 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29748; Tue, 28 Oct 1997 16:15:45 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 28 Oct 1997 16:15:45 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29534<br>Received: (qmail 1901 invoked from network); 28 Oct 1997 07:15:32 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 28 Oct 1997 07:15:32 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199710281513.AA03194@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
