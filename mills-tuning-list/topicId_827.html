If Brian believes so strongly <br>that there is no hope of a meaningful performances by conventional <br>instrumental forces, he is likely to be correct by virtue of the fact <br>that there are no "paper" scores.<br><br>Perhaps this is why the AFMM concerts cannot perform any of Brian's <br>works.

I have a tape of<br>Brian's music which I consider to be fine stuff, only marred by the<br>woodenness of the performance.  I would love to have a score so I<br>could try using different sound generations to see if I could bring it<br>to life.  Johnny and his colleagues should have the real skills to<br>PLAY these pieces.  The MIDI versions sound like demos rather than the<br>real thing.<br>  I suppose that does reopen teh discussion on what a suitable<br>notation is.  I use Csound scores, but that is hardly human readable.<br><br>==John ffitch<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 5 Sep 1996 17:19 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22707; Thu, 5 Sep 1996 17:20:48 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22371<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA10275; Thu, 5 Sep 1996 08:20:45 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 5 Sep 1996 08:20:45 -0700<br>Message-Id: <009A7ED5C81CB760.18B5@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
