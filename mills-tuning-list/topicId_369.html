(Again, Id like to<br>>get the "world record")<br><br>>From an old Guinness book of records: "Children with asthma can<br>>often detect a sound of 30000 cycles per second. It was<br>>announced in February 1964 that experiments in the U.S.S.R. had<br>>conclusively proved that oscillations as high as 200000 cycles<br>>per second can be heard if the oscillator is pressed against the<br>>skull."<br><br>I once read in an acoustics book that even ordinary people can<br>perceive frequencies up to 200,000 cycles in the sense that they<br>can tell that sounds are different, even if they only differ by<br>harmonics in that very high frequency range.  Unfortunately, that<br>was about 35 years ago, and I can no longer remember the name of<br>the book or it's author, for certain.  I thought the author was<br>an englishman named white, but people on another music forum were<br>very skeptical, and couldn't locate such a book.  Does anyone<br>here know the real answer?<br><br>Marion<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 28 Feb 1996 07:20 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA06535; Tue, 27 Feb 1996 22:20:24 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 27 Feb 1996 22:20:24 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3133F3EB.4537@sfo.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
