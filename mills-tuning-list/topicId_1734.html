I just performed some experiments on four stringed instruments<br>in my collection, a cheap violin, a sanxian, a small zheng and an <br>Appalachian mountain dulcimer.  Of these, I got the best results from<br>the violin and the sanxian.  On the violin, I got the best results on<br>the A and E strings, with the E string sounding louder.  I don't have a<br>scientific way of measuring the guage, but it looks like the violin E<br>string is the thinnest of all the strings on all four instruments.  It is<br>also unwound wire and tightly stretched.  The timbre of the sympathetic <br>resonance is similar to the plucked string timbre.<br><br>The second best results came from the sanxian.  The strings are longer<br>than those on the violin, and I think they're made from wound silk.  They<br>look like they're just a little bit thicker than the G and D strings on<br>the violin.  The timbre is similar to the plucked string timbre.<br><br>Both the violin and sanxian have excellent resonators, with the sanxian<br>having a small, round, snakeskin-covered box.<br><br>My small zheng (Chinese zither-type instrument) has thin wire strings <br>between the thickness of the A and E strings on the violin).<br>I didn't have time to find the tuning key right now to tighten them, so<br>they aren't really tightly stretched.  The resonator is much bigger than<br>that for the violin - it's basically a wooden box that all the strings <br>are mounted on, with holes in the bottom.  It worked better when I picked<br>the instrument up so that the sound could come out the small holes, but<br>the resonance still wasn't very loud.  Maybe the large moveable bridges<br>don't transmit the sound as well to the soundboard.<br><br>The dulcimer has nylon strings slightly thinner than those on the <br>sanxian.  I can't really account for why this one is not very loud.<br>Maybe metal strings work better than nylon?  Maybe the resonator<br>doesn't amplify the sound very well?<br><br>I got these results by loudly singing the same pitch as the string is <br>tuned to, as close to the plucking area (and the string itself) as <br>possible.  Singing a different pitch from the pitch of the string does <br>not give the effect, so it seems unlikely that the sympathetic vibration <br>comes from exciting the resonator.  I think the original excitation<br>must be airborne, and the strings sound louder if they have good<br>resonators.<br><br>Lydia Ayers<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 08:15 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA28778; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 08:15:32 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA28787<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id XAA10683; Wed, 26 Feb 1997 23:13:56 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 26 Feb 1997 23:13:56 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199702270213_MC2-11C6-1B7D@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4908 href="#4908">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/1997 3:41:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Lydia:<br><br>You wrote:<br><br>'' I don't get a sympathetic ringing at<br>the pitch if I hold all the strings (both sides of the bridge) so that<br>they cannot vibrate.''<br><br>I think you misunderstand this. The soundboard itself is here only a<br>transmitter - whose surface area is receiving the sound from the air.  Try<br>the reverse of what you describe - hold the soundboard firmly (I assume you<br>haven't got an instrument from Cremona) so that it cannot vibrate. Sing<br>into the back of the violin. The sympathetic motion should be minimal.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 13:07 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA21721; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 13:07:21 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01810<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id EAA29530; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 04:05:02 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 27 Feb 1997 04:05:02 -0800<br>Message-Id: <33157814.7B89@ix.netcom.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
