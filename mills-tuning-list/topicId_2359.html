Alexander the Great reached the Indus in the 4rd<br>century BCE and a Greek state lasted in Khorasmia until Roman times. Greek<br>astronomy clearly influenced Indian astronomy (the Paulisa Siddhanta,<br>Romaka Siddhanta, Surya S. etc. ) at an early date, thought to be  around<br>4th century CE by Neugebauer). Since the chief music theorists of the<br>Hellenistic period were also astronomers, I see no problem with their being<br>a Greek influence on music as well, or at least on music theory.<br><br>Because of the skhismic relationship, 5 limit relations may be approximated<br>by<br>a long Pythagorean cycle. I read a paper in an ethnomusicology journal that<br>suggested that the 22 tone scale grew out of the modes of the 12-tone<br>Pythagorean series. I gave my copy of the paper to Erv Wilson, who agreed,<br>but I don't recall the details any more. Hence one could use essentially 5<br>limit intervals while not recognizing 5 as a factor at all.<br><br>The point is that 5 and 7 limits intervals in theory and in melody were<br>recognized by the Greeks in the 4th century BC (Archytas) and later in<br>Alexandria in Hellenistic times (Didymos, Eratosthenes, Ptolemy). India<br>could have borrowed these concepts or developed them independently. I don't<br>think we can decide on present evidence (the Indians made no secret of<br>having learned astronomy from the Greeks as the Surya Siddhanta recounts<br>someone being ordered to go West to the land of the Ionians (Yavanas),<br>become incarnated as a barbarian, and learn astronomy. (Ethnic prejudice is<br>not a dead, white European, male value, evidently). The Paulisa S. is<br>thought to be named after Paulus Alexandrinus, a 4th century CE astronomer.<br><br>Actually all of the ancient world was in pretty close cultural contact,<br>particularly after Alexander, though Greek mathematics owes a lot to<br>Babylon and somewhat less to Egypt. They took what they wanted and ran with<br>it...<br><br>--John<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  nowitzky@pacificnet.net<br>Subject:  Re: Matrices (digest 1166 topic 2)<br>PostedDate:  28-08-97 18:35:22<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  28-08-97 18:35:27-28-08-97 19:13:26,28-08-97 19:13:14-28-08-97 19:13:15<br>DeliveredDate:  28-08-97 19:13:15<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256501.005B21C1; Thu, 28 Aug 1997 18:35:24 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04167; Thu, 28 Aug 1997 18:35:22 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 28 Aug 1997 18:35:22 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04191<br>Received: (qmail 22027 invoked from network); 28 Aug 1997 16:35:19 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 28 Aug 1997 16:35:19 -0000<br>Message-Id: <2.2.16.19970828092939.2d375326@pacificnet.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
