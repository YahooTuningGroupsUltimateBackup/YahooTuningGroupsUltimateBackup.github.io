As with Neil, I recognize the delicate balance involved, and agree<br>that the way to avoid expressing depressing or weird ideas is certainly not<br>by having it express nothing (i.e., "noodling" as Neil calls it).<br><br>   That delicate balance comes with it another problem:  Everybody's<br>balance scales come prebiased one way or another.  Some people will find<br>depressing what others will find to be minimally challenging.<br><br>   In analogy to semirecent news stories, I found the Lorena Bobbit story<br>unnewsworthy.  For something to be newsworthy, it needs not only to have<br>happened and happened recently, but there must also be some sort of value<br>in others knowing about it.  I saw none of the latter.  There are others<br>though who live off that sort of thing.  Perhaps they view anything short<br>of that as looking too much like a scene from Sesame Street or Ozzy and<br>Harriet.  Perhaps they're the sort of people who have "Shit Happens" bumper<br>stickers on their cars, to which my response has always been "well alright,<br>but what's the point in reminding us?"<br><br>   So taking that back to the musical realm, I personally think that<br>there's value in - voluntarily of course - limiting what we express in our<br>music.  I believe that music ideally should express something, and that<br>something should be challenging and intriguing, or perhaps just mindless<br>and fun, but expressing defeatism or depression strikes me as pointless.<br>Day to day life is a challenge for most of us, so singing about problems<br>alone says little more than the obvious that "I'm a living organism" or<br>"the world still isn't ideal", and rarely does more than deepen our<br>outrage.<br><br>   I believe that sad or painful feelings can be valuable to express<br>though, if there's some point of intrigue or insight to them.  For example,<br>a sad melody presented in the context of an unusual or surprising<br>underlying harmonic progression, or using a curious "twist" on traditional<br>forms, evokes more than just unabated pain.  The opening of Brahms' Requiem<br>is such a thing.  Or similarly, lyrics about how sad you are to lose a<br>loved one, reminiscing about the things in her life you'll miss, has a lot<br>more value in it than singing about the details of the blood and gore of<br>her death.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 14 Jun 1997 13:15 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA30639; Sat, 14 Jun 1997 13:15:02 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 14 Jun 1997 13:15:02 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA30629<br>Received: (qmail 20196 invoked from network); 14 Jun 1997 11:14:58 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 14 Jun 1997 11:14:58 -0000<br>Message-Id: <memo.492288@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5639 href="#5639">ðŸ”—</a>gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)</h3><span>6/14/1997 4:15:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I don't want to start a bandwidth wasting "who's your favourite<br>composer?" thread.
