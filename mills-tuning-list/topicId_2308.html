As soon as you say a quartertone is the unit of 31-tET, you might<br>as well use the term to describe any small interval, with the result<br>becoming terminologically chaotic. If desired, the 31 unit could be called<br>a fifthtone, as long as we realize there's a diesis lurking. In other<br>words, a 31-tone scale has 6 whole tones divided into fifths plus a<br>diesis. (6 x 5 + 1 = 31.) Each of the fiftones is of course the diesis<br>itself. (Not a JI diesis, needless to add...)<br><br>I am reminded of a story Easley Blackwood often told. When he mentioned to<br>a student that he was working on his project involving all the ETs between<br>13 and 24, the student replied, "Oh, you mean quartertones."<br><br>(Don't take the story too literally--maybe E B was talking about<br>microtonality in general. I don't remember.)<br><br>The notation pithily described by Paul Erlich has been used for 19 and 31<br>for a long time. There is no reason to change it for tonal/modal (centric)<br>music that I know of. The symbols + and - have a long history too and are<br>thoroughly annoying on a five-line staff. I suggested some time ago<br>changing them to / and \ or shorter variants thereof.<br><br>Paul Rapoport<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net<br>Subject:  Re: TUNING digest 1150<br>PostedDate:  12-08-97 16:02:28<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  12-08-97 16:02:28-12-08-97 16:02:29,12-08-97 16:00:52-12-08-97 16:00:53<br>DeliveredDate:  12-08-97 16:00:53<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564F1.004D1E74; Tue, 12 Aug 1997 16:02:20 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08857; Tue, 12 Aug 1997 16:02:28 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 12 Aug 1997 16:02:28 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08461<br>Received: (qmail 18463 invoked from network); 12 Aug 1997 14:00:08 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 12 Aug 1997 14:00:08 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541100b0166a2c72fb@DialupEudora><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
