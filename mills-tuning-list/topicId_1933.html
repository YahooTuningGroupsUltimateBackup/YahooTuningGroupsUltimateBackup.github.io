It <br>was written by Jeff Potter, and he was very enthusiastic; he also got the <br>details right, and mentioned Erv Wilson to boot. Write him, and get a <br>dialogue going about tunings.<br><br>It's encouraging to see such articles, and I believe there's been a trend <br>lately...there's been a lot of good press in the last few years about <br>tunings. This article, Catler's recent spot in Guitar Shop mag, some <br>wonderful concert articles from Denver, El Paso, Los Angeles, and New <br>York, all say to me that our labors have not been in vain. The word is <br>spreading, and I am sure this is just the beginning.<br><br>The Neanderthal flute debate is also very timely. Personally, since I <br>believe that the Harmonic series is such a natural part of the Creation <br>itself, it would not surprise me at all if "early" people sort of <br>naturally gravitated to it in their music. I also think that we get a bit <br>carried away trying to date everything...it seems to be a risky venture, <br>at best. And, more importantly, how "old" is old, anyway? The Hopis, and <br>I'm sure many other "old" cultures, have spoken of previous worlds and <br>civilizations, long destroyed by ancient disasters...they say this is the <br>4th world, with more to come. This seems pretty likely, to me...I think <br>the Universe is far, far older than contemporary "science," which seems <br>to think it's only 10-18 billion years since the "Big Bang." That ain't <br>much, I think...so, there might be flutes, and God knows what else, <br>buried or destroyed long ago...it is a valid path of study to speculate <br>about such things, and could lead to some incredible art...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 7 Apr 1997 20:19 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01505; Mon, 7 Apr 1997 20:19:21 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01503<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id LAA15387; Mon, 7 Apr 1997 11:17:17 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 7 Apr 1997 11:17:17 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01510102af6e70b5c0e0@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5269 href="#5269">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>4/8/1997 2:06:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Interesting!
