Strange.  My father always used to ask me to<br>give him a transcendental which was not pi, e or multiples; after all<br>there are very many of them.  I agree that e+pi is not decided --<br>there is a theorem by W.S.Brown which is significant for computer<br>algebra based on a conjecture which has e+pi being transcendental as a<br>specal case, and I have not heard that it was decided.  My PhD depends<br>in part on Gelfond-Schneider theorem, and I used to search this stuff.<br><br>Oh well, enough memory lane for tonight.<br><br>==John ff<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 21 Dec 1995 14:51 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id FAA07672; Thu, 21 Dec 1995 05:51:03 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 21 Dec 1995 05:51:03 -0800<br>Message-Id: <0099B33C0E28C9B9.5145@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
