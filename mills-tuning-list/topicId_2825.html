The 7:5 is obscured by<br>>}the fifth and fourth. There is a slightly stronger case for the 7:4, but<br>>}note that the first partial of the lower tone beats with the fundamental<br>>}of the upper tone (8:7).<br>><br>>Dissonance and consonance are merely relative acoustical qualities; how they<br>>are used in music is a human cultural decision. To speak of them in such<br>>absolute terms elevates one particular style of music to the status of divine<br>>revelation. Medieval and Chinese music used 3-limit dyads as the basic<br>>harmonic consonances. Later modal and then tonal Western music used 5-limit<br>>triads as the baisc consonances; dyads were now excluded from the texture as<br>>they sound "incomplete" in this context. It is not difficult to find examples<br>>in Wagner, Stravinsky, and jazz where the basic consonances are 7-limit<br>>tetrads, by virtue of all other harmonies being even more dissonant. Triads<br>>sound incomplete in this sort of context. Some features of this sort of style<br>>are harmonic movement by a half-octave, representing a 7:5 but forming a<br>>cycle which quickly closes; and chromatic melodic segments which are more<br>>than just passing figures. However, in such a style it has been difficult to<br>>impart a sense of logic and inevitability that is present in much tonal<br>>music. This is because<br>><br>>1) The (7-limit) consonant and (even more) dissonant chords do not arise from<br>>a fixed pattern of intervals within a scale -- in other words there is no<br>>grammatical support for the consonant/dissonant distinctions.<br>>2) There is no pattern of intervals which differentiates a given note as the<br>>"tonic."<br>>3) 7-limit chords are quite out-of-tune in 12-tet.<br>><br>>My decatonic scales in 22-tet solve these and other problems.<br>><br>>}Your phrase "vanishing of the syntonic comma" is unfortunate. This comma<br>>}does vanish in the 22-tone equal, but at a value (218 cents) that leads<br>>}to excruciatingly dissonant 'major thirds' (436 cents), minor thirds<br>>}(273 cents), major sixths (927 cents) and minor sixths (764 cents) as<br>>}soon as one modulates more than a few keys.<br>><br>>The syntonic comma arises musically in two ways. Either it is the difference<br>>between a 5:4 ("major third") and four 3:2s ("perfect fifths"), or it is the<br>>difference between a 5:3 ("major sixth") and three 3:2s, octaves ignored.<br>>These consonances must first be present in the tuning system and musical<br>>style before the determination of the size of the comma can take place. In<br>>22TET, there is no doubt that if the 5:4 and 5:3 are used as consonances,<br>>they are represented by 382 and 872 cents respectively, as the just values<br>>are 386 and 884. The 3:2 is represented by 709 cents, a value that is very<br>>slightly better than that of 19TET relative to just intonation. In mod 1200<br>>arithmetic, we find: 4*709-382 = 55, and 3*709-872 = 55. Both definitions<br>>give a syntonic comma of 55 cents, or one degree, in 22TET.<br>><br>>One cannot set the syntonic comma to a fixed value (0) and then use these<br>>relations to derive the size of the basic consonances. The consonances come<br>>first.<br>><br>>Since the syntonic comma does not vanish in 22TET, the whole diatonic system<br>>fails, a point you don't need to keep making, if you're paying any attention<br>>my replies. I don't disagree with you and never did. The terms "third,"<br>>"fifth," "semitone," etc. are therefore not strictly appropriate in<br>>discussing 22TET. However, if you do choose to use them, it should be with<br>>respect with some reasonable distortion of the diatonic scale, for example a<br>>major scale like the Indian ma-grama 4 3 2 4 3 4 2, where five triads are<br>>consonant, rather than a fifth-generated creature like 4 4 1 4 4 4 1, whre no<br>>triads are consonant. Actually, the three "minor" triads in this latter scale<br>>are close to just 6:7:9 chords, which many people quite like. But let's leave<br>>these diatonic non-issues behind.<br>><br>>}But even if one remains<br>>}within the same key, many intervals within the tonal fabric become<br>>}dissonant so long as fifths of 709 cents are preserved. To those who<br>>}treasure each new whining, commatic dissonance like the goose's golden<br>>}egg, and hate consonance with a passion, this temperament is indeed a<br>>}gift from the gods.<br>><br>>Let me make one caveat to the claim that if the syntonic comma does not<br>>vanish, the diatonic system fails. There is an important period in Western<br>>musical history where a major scale with a comma defect was actually used.<br>>This was in the late medieval period, when consonant thirds and sixths were<br>>gaining acceptance, but Pythagorean temperament was still sine qua non. The<br>>procedure was to tune a Pythagorean series starting with, say, Gb, to obtain<br>>the scale C Db D Eb E F Gb G Ab A Bb B C in Pythagorean intonation. Now<br>>examine the "major" scale starting on D: D E Gb G A B Db D. In cents it is 0<br>>204 384 598 702 882 1086 1200. The I, iii, IV, V and vi triads are only 2<br>>cents off just intonation! The ii triad is quite out-of-tune, however, and<br>>would have to be avided in such music, and modulation is not possible. But<br>>this was a period before triadic harmony had not yet established itself,<br>>though the diatonic scale had long reigned supreme and continued to do so.<br>>Melodically the difference between the two sizes of whole tone is just a bit<br>>too small to be disturbing, and so it seems likely that this scale could have<br>>been the ma-grama of ancient India -- in terms of a 22-tone Pythagorean<br>>tuning, the structure of this scale is indeed 4 3 2 4 3 4 2. Indian music<br>>uses a melody against a tonic drone, so the out-of tune intervals between the<br>>second and fourth and between the second and sixth never occur harmonically.<br>><br>>}22-tone equal is to observe that the three consonant cycles (those of<br>>}the fifth, major third and minor third with their inversions) are<br>>}incommensurable.<br>><br>>Introduce the septimal harmonies and the cycles become "commensurable" again,<br>>if I may continue your misuse of the word. See my paper.<br>><br>>}Of<br>>}course the centre of 22-tone equal in India is nowadays supposed to be<br>>}the South.<br>><br>>Where did you get this idea?<br>><br>>}Tuning now to a different issue, you appear to assume that because the<br>>}historic Arab theorists - most of them more concerned to interpret<br>>}ancient Greek theory than the practice of their own musicians -<br>>}prescribe or record a tuning, all are Neanderthals who do not fall down<br>>}before this tuning in awe. I certainly do not hold Arabic music in<br>>}contempt.<br>><br>>As I recall, you began on this list by attempting some selective<br>>interpretation of Arab theorists -- anything that supports 1/3-tones, you<br>>like. I am speaking simply as a musician who listens. I listen closely -- at<br>>blues jams I will often echo a singer or other soloist note-for-note<br>>including all microtonal inflections and slides. In high school I trained<br>>myself with a computer to infallibly recognize randomly played 31-equal<br>>intervals, though I must admit to falling short of Johnny Reinhard's<br>>1200-equal abilities. The simple fact is that Arabic music often divides a<br>>minor third into two equal parts.<br>><br>>}I am aware of the cents in a (12-tone equal) tone. Difference of opinion<br>>}need not give rise to random unpleasantness.<br>><br>>Just curious, what is this in reference to?<br>><br>>}I had much rather be called a 'popularist' than an elitist.<br>><br>>Yes, I thought it a more accurate description.<br>><br>>}I do not deny that non-Western traditions use intervals different from<br>>}those commonly used in the West. Thank God that they do!<br>>}I do however categorically deny that any singers whatever (allowance<br>>}made for the occasional alien with 31-tone equal ears)<br>>}can reliably reproduce intervals narrower than 55-60 cents in melody.<br>><br>>Partch and several fine interpreters of his music have produced many<br>>counterexamples, now available on CD.<br>><br>>}I wish to clarify my statements regarding the tone of 22-tone equal.<br>><br>>}This temperament does not merge 10:9 (182 cents) and 9:8 (204 cents) in<br>>}the sense that it does not merge the two at a value intermediate between<br>>}the two( as _do_ the harmonically usable temperaments)<br>><br>>Correction: diatonically useable temperaments<br>><br>>}but it does merge<br>>}them at a value quite divergent from both, namely at 218 cents. So in<br>>}one sense it does not merge (or compromise between) the two species of<br>>}tone, but in another sense it does merge them, at a very unfortunate<br>>}excentric value.<br>><br>>How you can say it merges them is beyond me. The "9:8" arises from<br>>consonances as two perfect fifths, and the "10:9" arises as a major third<br>>minus two perfect fifths. Thus the difference between them is, by definition,<br>>a syntonic comma. The syntonic comma, we have seen, is represented by 55<br>>cents in 22-equal. The "10:9" is represented by 164 cents, and the "9:8" by<br>>218 cents, in 22-equal.<br>><br>>}All harmonically usable temperaments<br>><br>>Again, this should say "diatonically usable"<br>><br>>}: 12- 19- 31- 43- 50- 55-tone equal,<br>>}etc merge the two species of tone at a value intermediate between 10:9 &<br>>}9:8. This permits the cycles of the fifth, major third and minor third<br>>}to be integrated within a single coherent system. These temperaments<br>>}divide the tone into 2,3,5,7,8 & 9 equal parts respectively.<br>><br>>}It is interesting that no usable temperament divides the tone into four<br>>}equal parts. Both 22- and 24-tone equal do so, and both are dogs, though<br>>}for very different reasons. There is also a gap in the sequence at 6.<br>><br>>Why is 24TET unusable?<br>><br>>And what about 26TET, where the syntonic comma truly does vanish? You feel<br>>that the ratios of 3 (3:2, 4:3) are more sensitive to mistuning than the<br>>ratios of 5 (5:4, 6:5, 5:3, 8:5), and therefore 26-equal would be out of the<br>>question. However, Harry Partch was convinced that the opposite was true, and<br>>rational approximation theory, with a suitable musical interpretation, quite<br>>agrees with Partch. My ears find evidence for both points of view: at first<br>>the prominent beating of out-of-tune ratios of 3 is more disturbing, but<br>>ultimately it is not as detrimental to the musical meaning of the intervals<br>>as an equal amount of mistuning in more complex ratios. This latter fact<br>>explains why 19TET is much better than 12TET for 5-limit harmony; weighting<br>>the ratios of 3 much more than the ratios of 5 would make 12TET look better.<br>>One gets used to the prominent beating of the ratios of 3 in 19TET and 22TET,<br>>and misses it when it's gone. The beating in 26TET is only a shade faster.<br>>Many musical cultures use ratios of 3 in musically significant ways but<br>>mistune them relative to JI by up to about 20 cents. The West mistunes ratios<br>>of 5 by similar amounts in attempting to use 12TET. On balance, treating all<br>>consonances as equally susceptible to mistuning may make the most sense,<br>>especially in a context of complete harmonies, where the more complex ratios<br>>can be more easily understood by virtue of the way they combine. I did so in<br>>deriving 2-3 cents as the optimal amount of stretching for 19TET; unlike<br>>Gregg, I used squared error as the measure of dissonance, the appropriateness<br>>of which I recently discussed.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Practical Bases of Just Intonation<br>PostedDate:  18-12-97 03:19:01<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  18-12-97 03:16:56-18-12-97 03:16:56,18-12-97 03:16:33-18-12-97 03:16:34<br>DeliveredDate:  18-12-97 03:16:34<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256571.000C8764; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 03:18:47 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18616; Thu, 18 Dec 1997 03:19:01 +0100<br>Date: Thu, 18 Dec 1997 03:19:01 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18603<br>Received: (qmail 6742 invoked from network); 17 Dec 1997 18:18:58 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 17 Dec 1997 18:18:58 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3498EA05.140F@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
