The reason for this is that I left Mills back in June,<br>and I no longer really regularly check my mail here, as my life has moved on.<br>My successor at Mills is not interested in continuing with the listserver.<br><br>It is time to start to arrange to move the list.  I will provide all of <br>the support I possibly can to whomever decides to take it over - it would<br>be best to be moved to another list server running listproc 6.0, or listserv,<br>if possible.  I will even help get the listserver compiled and running  (but<br>not maintain it) if that is necessary.<br><br>If you have any ideas, please send the mail to my new address, madole@dnai.com.<br><br>Dave</div><h3><a id=8975 href="#8975">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;John Loffink&#x22; &#x3C;jloffink@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/1998 4:53:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>From: Neil Haverstick <stick@uswest.net><br>><br>>    The first review that I've seen of the tuning CD appeared in the new<br>>Westword mag this week...log onto www.westword.com, and look for reviews<br>>by Michael Roberts.
