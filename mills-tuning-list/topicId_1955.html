This record is especially notable for being the<br>first of theirs to include new works scored for Partch's instruments in<br>combination with others--commonly the flute and synthesizer.<br><br>The first work is Partch's "Castor & Pollux," which I admittedly do not<br>group with Partch's *great* music.  Plodding rhythms in this piece are<br>accentuated by Newband's unenthusiastic playing, resulting in well-placed<br>notes which would probably not encourage a new listener to seek more of<br>Partch's music.  Furthermore, I should point out that C & P is Newband's<br>second re-recording of Partch's highest-quality recordings (Newband's last<br>CD included "Daphne of the Dunes," which, along with C & P was on "The<br>World of Harry Partch" record).  I suggest that to best serve the memory of<br>Partch, Newband would do well to record works like "Eleven Intrusions"<br>which exist only as shabby recordings.<br><br>The second piece, sadly, was also not to my liking.  Anne LeBaron's<br>"Southern Ephemera," scored for flute, cello, surrogate kithara and<br>harmonic canon, is a knotty background with fragments of American-Southern<br>melodies floating through.  At no point do I understand why one song or<br>another appears, nor can I find a connection between a melody and its<br>accompaniment.  The music also fails to project an emotional "topic," and<br>it certainly avoids any sense of homage or nostalgia which is such a<br>dominant feature in the music of Charles Ives--an obvious point of<br>comparative reference.<br><br>The winning track turns out to be Elizabeth Brown's "Archipelago," scored<br>for flute, cello, synthesizer, surrogate kitharas, diamond marimba and<br>zoomoozophone.  Accustomed to working with non-Western instruments, Brown<br>avoids the seductive impulse to play with Newband's colors while abandoning<br>creativity in the other musical parameters.  In fact, aside from Partch,<br>Brown is the first of Newband's recorded composers to creatively work in<br>Just Intonation.  "Archipelago" exhibits creative use of tonal flux, remote<br>modulations and sliding tones.  Her zoomoozophone writing is clean, and her<br>use of Partch's instruments is creative.  I hope that more works of this<br>calibre will be contributed to Newband's repetoire.<br><br>The final work on this CD is Dean Drummond's "Dance of the Seven Veils,"<br>decribed in the liner notes as being based on "Tom Robbins' 'Skinny Legs<br>and All'."  From this I can only assume that Drummond is not familiar with<br>the opera of Richard Strauss, the play of Oscar Wilde, the biblical source,<br>etc.  How embarrassing!<br><br>Drummond's piece is a whirling collage of beautiful sounds.  While this is<br>not enough to be the essence of a masterpiece, it is notable that his<br>intimate knowledge of the instruments allows him to make stunning sounds,<br>brighter than Partch's with the wonderful addition of metal instruments<br>such as the zoomoozophone and juststrokerods.  Even though I am very<br>familiar with all of the instruments, there were several moments in this<br>piece where I could not discern what was playing; the music is genuinely<br>"orchestrated" in the classical sense.<br><br>Overall, the CD is worth buying for Elizabeth Brown's piece.  As for<br>Newband's future, I hope that an effort will be made to better acquaint<br>composers with the tuning concepts inherent in JI instruments as well as<br>the playing techniques involved.  The work by LeBaron (as well as Julia<br>Wolfe's "Steam," not included here) exhibits a shallow relationship with<br>Partch's instruments; if Newband continues to commission new music from<br>established composers, this issue must be dealt with.  Once it is, perhaps<br>they will establish themselves as a good force in bringing Just Intonation<br>music to the common composer.<br><br>_________________<br>Adam B.
