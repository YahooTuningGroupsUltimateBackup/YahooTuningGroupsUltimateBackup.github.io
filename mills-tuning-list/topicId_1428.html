I've seen small harmoniums (shruti-boxes?) with <br>a hand-operated bellows and 12-tone keyboards in Indian import shops <br>and performance. Perhaps a microtonal version could be cheaply produced.<br><br>I found it difficult to extract a coherent scale from the Gudjieff<br>excerpt. One can see the chromatic scale there and perhaps 14 sympathetic<br>strings or an octave of 26 tones. The names seem to be a mixture of<br>Greek and Armenian, at least I see a few number roots in both languages, <br>though my knowledge of Armenian is virtually nil. Gurdjieff, as I recall,<br>was born in Russia of Greek parents and directed an Oriental dance troupe<br>in Moscow for which he wrote the music. Hence he might well have been<br>acquainted with Near Eastern music, which is largely based on Iranian <br>styles. BTW, the Armenian vocabulary has been greatly influenced by<br>Iranian languages too. <br><br>In any case, scales of roughly 24 tones in Pythagorean, some sort of<br>JI, or near ET are known in the Near East. D'Erlanger discusses them in<br>some detail in the later volumes of La Musique Arabe. I'm not clear<br>whether Persian and Turkish music is basically 12 tones of Pythagorean<br>with commatic and double-commatic inflections or not. The effect is<br>quarter-tonal in many instances.<br><br>As for contemporary Greek Orthodox or Byzantine liturgical scales,<br>I consulted several somewhat contradictory sources for my book on<br>tetrachords. The sources are these:<br><br>Xenakis, Iannis.  1971.  "Towards a Metamusic."  in  Cybernetics, Art <br>and Ideas.  Jasia Reichardt, ed.  New York Graphic Society Ltd.<br>Greenwich, CT.  Another translation of this article appears in <br>Xenakis, Iannis. 1971.  Formalized Music,  Indiana University Press, <br>Bloomington, IA, USA.<br><br>Tiby, Ottavio.  1938.  La Musica Byzantina.   Fratelli Bocia Editori.  <br>Milan, Italy.<br><br>Savas, Savas I.  1965.  Byzantine Music in Theory and Practice,  Hercules <br>Press. Boston<br><br>Athanasopoulos, Georgios D.  1950. Theoria tes Byzantines Mousikes, <br>Patras, Greece. (excerpts in another article.)<br><br>Xenakis uses Aristoxenos's/Cleonides's cypher notation of<br>30 parts to the 4th to come up with scales in JI. He discusses<br>the Trochos and other chains of tetrachords and pentachords as<br>well as heptatonic scales, modulations,etc.<br><br>Savas's and Athanasopoulos's scales use the same system, but if <br>anything, their resemble some contemporary Islamic scales as much <br>as Aristoxenos's genera.  I found Sava's book quite confusingly<br>written in some places and I used Athathanasopoulos only for some<br>unusual tetrachords. Tiby uses an oldar 28 parts to the 4th, 68 to the <br>octave system.<br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 24 Dec 1996 23:22 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02566; Tue, 24 Dec 1996 23:25:20 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02567<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id OAA04586; Tue, 24 Dec 1996 14:25:18 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 24 Dec 1996 14:25:18 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612241723_MC1-DDF-8BCB@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
