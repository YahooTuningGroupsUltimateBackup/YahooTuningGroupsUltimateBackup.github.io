By the<br>"harmonic series" I meant the set of harmonic overtones. I forgot<br>that there was a quite different harmonic series in maths.  It's<br>one of those confusing things like 13 being a lucky number.<br><br>My point is that the overtone series exploits the same symmetry<br>as ETs, but in a different scale.  JI can be derived from this<br>series, and so exploits the symmetry.  Where subsets of an ET are<br>used, the analogy is even better, as we are dealing with small<br>integer ratios in both cases.<br><br>Paul Erlich wrote:<br><br>>However, pitch space is not the same as frequency space.
