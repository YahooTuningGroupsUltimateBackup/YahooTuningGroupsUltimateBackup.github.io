But I think the first message in TD 1418 was<br>sort of mostly directed at be, so I'll take that one on first.<br><br>>Yeah, but doesn't the 7-limit accuracy depend somewhat on the 5-limit<br>>accuracy?  (Isn't the 5-limit a subset of your 7-limit in that example?)<br><br>Yes.<br><br>>Are you willing to accept a tuning that has good 7 ratios but horrible or<br>>non-existant 5 and 3 ratios?<br><br>If the 7:4, 7:5, AND 7:6 are good, and we're talking about an equal<br>temperament with pure octaves, then the ratios of 5 and 3 can't be that<br>bad.<br><br>>1) The best of Ivor's stuff is roughly as good as the best of Blackwood's.<br>>2) The majority of Ivor's work is un-recorded.<br><br>In that case, I should shut up. I've only heard "Detwelvulate." The<br>whole of Blackwood's etudes were made more powerful to me by the ending<br>of the last one (in 19), which rocks.<br><br>>>>the best 11/9 will be off by the absolute value of the sums of<br>>>>the errors of the 11/8 and 9/8, consistency or no<br>><br>>>If you mean the best 11/8 and the best 9/8, then that might not be true,<br>>>although consistency will guarantee that it's true. If you don't mean<br>>>the best 11/8 and the best 9/8, then what do you mean?<br><br>>That's what I mean.  Can you give an example where it's not true?<br><br>Easy -- 12-tone equal temperament. The best 11/8 is off by -48.68 cents,<br>the best 9/8 is off by 3.91 cents, and the best 11/9 is off by 47.41<br>cents.<br><br>>I will say that the 720 cent interval may function as the dominant in many<br>>parts of that suite, but it does not function as a 3/2.  I cannot imagine<br>>any two intervals more sharply contrasting in sound.<br><br>To me, the triads in 15-equal on the classical guitar sound almost as<br>good as those in 12-equal. This is partially due to the very pure minor<br>thirds. With consonant triads, the 720 cents interval is certainly<br>functioning as a 3/2. It has very little chance of being interpreted as<br>any other just ratio.</div>
