Indeed, the fact that it _was_ so close<br>and yet not the same certainly would have impelled<br>him on to see what other kinds of relationships<br>there were.  He probably wouldn't have stopped<br>until he just plain got tired of doing all that<br>calculating.<br><br>If he had the same kind of inquisitiveness that<br>Darreg, Partch, and Schoenberg had, and many of<br>us have, he would have written pieces that<br>utilized all those unusual notes, to see just<br>what that would sound like.  So maybe there<br>was some ancient Greek walking around with a<br>toga that said "quasi-7-Limit Rules!".<br><br>- Joe Monzo<br>  monz@juno.com<br>  http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html<br><br>___________________________________________________________________<br>You don't need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html<br>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</div>
