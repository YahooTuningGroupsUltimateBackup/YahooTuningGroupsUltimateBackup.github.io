        <a href="/mills-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>More beating Intervals</h1><h3><a id=3786 href="#3786">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/1996 8:01:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>While trying to determine the source of the discrepancies between<br>my numbers and Manuel's, I recomputed my earlier table and got the<br>same results. However, it occurred to me that my approach does not<br>distinguish between intervals that are sharp from those that are<br>flat, or in other words, between intervals beating because they are to<br>narrow or too large. Hence, there are two solutions to each of the<br>relations; one where the beat rates are due to intervals both sharp<br>or flat, and one where they are dissimilar. I have thus added a<br>column of "Equal and Opposite" tunings for these new results.<br><br><br>Beating Intervals	Equal		Equal & Opposite<br><br>1. 4th = min 6th        695.8096      	697.1769<br>2. 4th = Maj 6th        696.2958	692.1612,  too flat?<br>3. min 6th= Maj 6th     696.0063        698.1741<br>4. 5th = Maj 3rd        695.6304	697.2785       <br>5. 5th = min 3rd        695.8096      	693.3588, too flat?<br>6. Maj 3rd = min 3rd    695.7294	(629.9748, unacceptable!)	<br>7. min 3rd = min 6th    698.8781        695.9340<br>8. 4th = Maj 3rd        697.4747       	695.2284<br>9. 5th = min 6th        697.0390        696.0237<br><br>My approach is based on Rasch's beat rate formulae where x is the <br>temperer and S=81/80. The tempered fifths thus equal 3x/2. The <br>"register-free" beat  rates of the various intervals are as follows:<br><br>Fifth 		3x - 3<br>Fourth 		4/x - 4<br>Major 3rd 	5Sx^4 - 5<br>Minor 3rd	6/Sx^3 - 6<br>Major 6th	5Sx^3 - 5<br>Minor 6th	8/Sx^4 - 8<br><br>Tunings are defined by taking pairs of these relations and setting<br>one equal to the other or to the negative of the other. Thus #4 <br>where the Fifth beats at the same rate as the Major third is defined <br>by the formulae 3x - 3 = 5Sx^4 - 5 and 3x - 3 = 5 - 5Sx^4. Solve these<br>equations for x, then multiply by 3/2 to get the decimal fraction for <br>the tempered fifth  and then multiply this value by some convenient <br>pitch base such as C261.625 hz. From this frequency, one may compute <br>the difference between the 3rd partial of the tonic and 2nd of the <br>tempered fifth. This value is 0 for x=1. <br><br>Beat rates of the  other intervals are calculated by generating them<br>from tempered fifths by the traditional Pythagorean cycles. Beat <br>rates are then determined from the lowest (nearly) coincident partials <br>as above.<br><br>--John<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 19 Oct 1996 18:41 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03481; Sat, 19 Oct 1996 18:43:12 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03475<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA25310; Sat, 19 Oct 1996 09:43:09 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 19 Oct 1996 09:43:09 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.961019122935.7120F-100000@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
