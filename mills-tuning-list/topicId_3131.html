But there's also a driving<br>>and rather harsh energy redolent of rock, as well as a cleanly<br>>(Western) melodicism. Motorically "snapped to grid", in computer<br>>parlance, the music's momentum and intricate cross-rhythms rarely<br>>let up, making the occasional infectious tunes that emerge all the<br>>more beautiful for surprise. "A Visible Track of Turbulence" and<br>>"Relative Segments" are for classical chamber ensembles, but it's<br>>the slight microtonal piano retunings in the other works - "Fields<br>>Amaze", my favorite, and "Everything Distinct: Everything the<br>>Same" - that give the music a highly original punch.<br>><br>>Kyle Gann - The Village Voice ( week ending Feb. 24)<br>>http://www.villagevoice.com/ink/music/8gann.shtml<br>><br>>-------------------------------------------------------------<br>><br>>More and more young composers are determined to fuse their<br>>formal training with popular and world music influences. Few,<br>>however, come up with results that add up to more than the sum of<br>>their parts, like Patrick Grant, whose debut CD (Silent Treatment<br>>1709 MLTV) is out now. A lack of program notes and biographical<br>>information imply that Grant intends the music to speak for itself.<br>>In truth, the Detroit reared composer is in his early thirties, has<br>>worked a lot with dance and multimedia, and performs regularly<br>>with Gamelan Son Of Lion.  "Fields Amaze," the opening work on<br>>the disc, blends traditional gamelan with a microtonal keyboard,<br>>weaving an intriguing tapestry of non-pitched sounds with lively<br>>rhythmic patterns that culminate in a driving pedal point that is<br>>almost Bachian in effect. "A Visible Track of Turbulence" is<br>>scored for more conventional forces. Grant's writing for flute,<br>>clarinet and piano emphasizes long lines and rigorously<br>>constructed rhythmic phrases, yet never really exploits the<br>>instruments on their own terms. "Everything Distinct: Everything<br>>the Same", for three percussionists and just as many keyboards<br>>tuned in meantone temperament reveals the composer's strong<br>>theoretical bent. I am especially fond of the four movement<br>>"Relative Segments," which bristles with upbeat invention<br>>throughout, notably in its harmonic and metric slights of hand. It<br>>has an evocative slow movement that reveals a lyric gift I hope<br>>Grant will explore more extensively in future works. One suspects<br>>much of this music would easily appeal to young choreographers<br>>looking for something out of the ordinary yet accessible at the<br>>same time. You can obtain this CD directly from the composer @<br>>Silent Treatment (BMI), 1173A 2nd Avenue, Suite 322, New<br>>York, NY 10021, or via the Internet (mrpgrant@mail.idt.net).<br>><br>>Jed Distler - EPULSE: Tower Records Online Weekly Ezine<br>>coming out Feb. 21<br>>http://www.towerrecords.com/epulse/index.html<br><br><br>--<br>*   .
