In case I confused anyone : of course I meant the Kingma<br>(Osten Brannen) flute, not a simulation of a flute using Kyma (the<br>digital platform).<br><br>I seem to have confused Johnny! ;-)<br><br>> When asked which instrument is the hardest by a young, naive individual.<br>> The honest answer is that they are all equally hard in the long run.<br>> While a harp string is easy to pluck, this easy challenge is compounded<br>> later on by the rapidity of of multiple harp simultanaities, artistically<br>> rendered...and invariably by memory.<br><br>No! you mean there's a learning curve to learning an instrument!?<br>Well I'll be darned....  and you've got to memorise! well, I didn't<br>understand the relevance of that before!;-)<br><br>> I honestly think it's not that hard to learn microtonal playing on<br>> conventional instruments.<br><br>Agreed - up to a point....but.... Last night there was a performance<br>of Ravel's Daphnis and Chloe on BBC Radio.  And I thought to myself:<br>there's no way that something of this nature could be brought off<br>with conventional existing instruments, if it was composed in, say<br>32-ET (which can give, for example, a glorious mix of Western and<br>Eastern harmony...).  No way.  The thing would be completely fudged,<br>even if it were a whole orchestra of superstars... Ok, maybe you<br>could do it after 5 years of rehearsals...<br><br>But perhaps I 'harp' on....<br><br>All best,<br><br>Patrick Ozzard-Low<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET><br>Subject:  Re: Daphnis and Chloe<br>PostedDate:  19-11-97 22:03:05<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  19-11-97 22:01:39-19-11-97 22:01:40,19-11-97 22:01:47-19-11-97 22:01:48<br>DeliveredDate:  19-11-97 22:01:48<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256554.00737FA5; Wed, 19 Nov 1997 22:01:33 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03245; Wed, 19 Nov 1997 22:03:05 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 19 Nov 1997 22:03:05 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03243<br>Received: (qmail 10413 invoked from network); 19 Nov 1997 13:03:01 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 19 Nov 1997 13:03:01 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.95.971119155826.9972A-100000@u2.farm.idt.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
