(~100 of <br>them).<br><br>On Henk Badings and Nazism, we can get all the Wagner CDs we want, and <br>rightly so. I would hesitate to censor a Nazi's speeches, let alone his <br>music. Every time I walk into a record store, I go directly to the section <br>after Bach, only to find Baden followed by Baermann. The few selections of <br>Badings I have heard have been breathtaking, and I haven't even heard his <br>microtonal work. It would be a true loss to humanity if Badings' music were <br>to disappear into the shadows of history, but it seems as if it already has. <br>Any information on how to obtain LPs or cassettes of his music would be much <br>appreciated!<br><br>The question of tuning a harmonica is a truly interesting one. Although <br>meantone is the best possible tuning to get all six consonant triads in a <br>diatonic scale, only three of these triads are possible on the diatonic <br>harmonica (CEG, DFA, and GDB -- I believe there is a draw G in the lower <br>register, isn't there?). So the intervals AC and EB do not need to be tuned <br>precisely. If the presence of two different-sized whole tones is not <br>disturbing to you, you can try 1/1 9/8 5/4 27/20 3/2 27/16 15/8 1/1. More <br>radically, if you allow the draw G to be different from the blow G, you <br>might want to try 1/1 10/9 5/4 4/3 (3/2 or 40/27) 5/3 50/27 2/1, where 3/2 <br>is the blow G and 40/27 is the draw G. The chromatic harmonica, as described <br>by Pat, is a different beast, I'll have to think about it. It seems less <br>restrictive in that G does not have to be in tune with D or B. But the <br>problem of getting the dominant seventh chord to sound just without <br>destroying the usual intervals seems futile. Equal temperament (of the 12 <br>variety) is a pretty good compromise here.<br><br>Which leads me to Harold Fortuin's post. While the 31-note scale has both <br>beautiful diatonic scales and 4/5/6/7 chords, unfortunately the latter are <br>not included in the former. The 4/5/6/7 chord appears as a German sixth <br>(such as A-flat C E-flat F#) in the meantone interpretation of 31tet, and <br>the minor version of this chord could be expressed as A-flat B D F#. These <br>could fit into traditional harmony quite well, and their pure tuning would <br>allow one to "sit" on them or resolve to them with auxilliary progressions <br>before allowing them to perform their traditional function: A-flat and F# <br>each resolve by a diatonic semitone to a G. The 11-limit intervals are quite <br>good but do not show up in traditional harmonic formulae; incorporating them <br>into traditional harmony would be a challenge, but certainly one of the most <br>worthy challenges in music today.<br><br>Harold, I can tell you far more about the 22-tone scale, based on research I <br>have done (soon to be published). Here 7-limit chords become the basic <br>consonances and triads are incomplete. There are other similarities with <br>jazz as well. I offer to send you a copy of my paper and other material in <br>exchange for recordings of your music, both past and future. I will e-mail <br>you to see if you agree to this offer. Other references would include <br>Yasser's _Theory of Evolving Tonality_ and van Eck's _J. S. Bach's Critique <br>of Pure Music_. Yasser shouldn't be taken too seriously, but my imagination <br>was sparked more by this book than any other. van Eck incorporates more <br>modern psychoacoustics than any of your references, and certainly deals with <br>"traditional" harmony, though microtones are not really dealt with. In any <br>case, good luck to you, I think your approach is among the most likely to <br>meet with success in the future of music.<br><br>Thanks to all for the suggestions of xenharmonic vocal compositions. I am <br>definitely going to check some of these out.<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 9 Jul 1996 02:52 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id RAA04449; Mon, 8 Jul 1996 17:52:07 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 8 Jul 1996 17:52:07 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9607082042.A2854-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
