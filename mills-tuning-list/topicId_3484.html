I<br>thought Duffing's equation is pretty much a classic for forced<br>oscillations, but maybe only in pure mathematics.  I never did any chaos<br>theory in physics.  Not important here, as I assume we're still thinking<br>of an artificial process in the brain.<br><br>>Instead of a period-doubling cascade, changes in the<br>>parameter value for this type of system lead to a Fibonacci sequence of<br>>period lengths. So changing the parameter in this case could decrease<br>>the period to 2 or increase it to 5. I don't see how this is more<br>>"stable" that a typical order 1/n^2 subharmonic for a<br>>quadratic-fixed-point nonlinearity.<br><br>I meant "stable" in the usual sense that, of you perturb the system<br>slightly, it will not tend towards an entirely different behaviour.<br>This is the minimum criterion for a limit cycle to be at all useful.<br>There are, in fact, four centres and three (unstable) saddles.  Centres<br>are stable, but not asymptotically stable, and this is usually how limit<br>cycles arise, although I don't know if that's relevant in this case.<br>Slight damping means the centres become stable spirals, and their basins<br>of attraction are much reduced.<br><br>Here's some text:<br><br>"For the linear equation this[not the system above] periodic motion<br>appears to be merely an anomalous case of the usual almost-periodic<br>motion, depending on a precise relation between the forcing and natural<br>frequencies.  Also, any damping will cause its disappearance.  When the<br>equation is nonlinear, however, the generation of alien harmonics by the<br>nonlinear terms may cause a stable subharmonic to appear for a range of<br>the parameters, and in particular for a range of applied frequencies.<br>Also, the forcing amplitude plays a part in generating and sustaining<br>the subharmonic even in the presence of damping.  Thus there will exist<br>the tolerance of slightly varying conditions necessary for the<br>consistent appearance of a subharmonic and its use in physical systems."<br><br>D.W.Jordan & P. Smith "Nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations" 2nd<br>edition, Oxford, 1987, p.196.<br><br>The following general case (Duffing's equation without damping) is then<br>covered:<br><br>                  x'' + a*x + b*x^3 = G*cos(w*t)<br>                  w^2*x'' + a*x + b*x^3 = G*cos(tau)<br><br>In the first equation, differentiation is with respect to t, in the<br>second wrt to tau.  The two are equivalent, and the second is used as<br>the frequency is not known before the parameters are chosen.  There's a<br>lengthy calculation, that I haven't followed, the result being (p.200):<br><br>                 a =~ w^2/9<br><br>As "the calculations are valid without the restriction on b."  I think b<br>should still be small, though.  It looks like this is a good way of<br>generating a subharmonic of a particular value, if that's what you want<br>to do.  Not all of these subharmonics are stable, though, so I quoted<br>one that is proved such as an example in the next section.<br><br>Whatever mechanism, some kind of nonlinear equation seems to be the way<br>to perform frequency reduction.  The most useful subharmonic will still<br>be of order 1/2, but that is not inevitable.  According to the text,<br>this sort of thing goes on in quartz clocks.<br><br>> The actual frequency at which periodicity pitch gives up is about 5-6<br>> kHz. Really high!<br><br>Yes, this is higher than I thought.  I was expecting a few hundred Hz.<br><br>>>The latest book's I've read --<br>>>which, as they came from libraries, are a decade or three old -- say<br>that<br>>>the original experiments showing octave invariance were performed on<br>>>musically literate subjects.<br><br>> Are white rats musically literate?<br><br>No, obviously not.  I'd still prefer humans, but please outline any<br>experiments you know of.  Not having access to a university library, I<br>can't get hold of academic papers very easily.<br><br>>>More specifically, literate in Western<br>>>Classical Music, where the notation is octave based.<br><br>>Many other cultures use octave-based notation.<br><br>Whoa!  Hold on there!  When did I say anything else?<br><br>>>> As for the apparantly irregular "subharmonic" which Gary observed in<br>the<br>>>> bassoon waveform, this can easily be explained by assuming some<br>>>> parameter of non-linearity (perhaps lip pressure) was hovering<br>around a<br>>>> value at which an initial period doubling occurs. So the amplitude<br>of<br>>>> this period-2 subharmonic could have been changing, and it could<br>cease<br>>>> to exist for a while, returning again just as easily after either an<br>odd<br>>>> or even number of period-1 oscillations.<br><br>>>This assumes the system is teetering in a bifurcation point, which is<br>>>actually very unlikely.<br><br>>Not unlikely at all! Look again at a bifurcation diagram -- there is<br>>quite a large range of values where the period-2 behavior has a<br>>relatively constant amplitude, but at one end of this range the<br>>amplitude suddenly decreases and period-1 behavior ensues. If the<br>>bassoonist is trying to keep within this range, say because he is<br>trying<br>>to play as loud as he can and octave subharmonics don't bother him but<br>>chaos does, the parameter will likely take on just such a range of<br>>values.<br><br>If there's some reason to move toward a bifurcation, that would make a<br>difference.  If "the period-2 behaviour has a relatively constant<br>amplitude" why not play right in the middle of the period 2 region,<br>instead of veering toward the bifurcation?<br><br>>>I'd guess the amplitude of the subharmonic is<br>>>chaotic.  Or, the subharmonic is entirely chaotic but appears to be<br>order<br>>>1/2 at certain times<br><br>>>A period doubling cascade can be<br>>>linked to amplitude, though.<br><br>>These don't sound like examples of real-world dynamics.<br><br>On thinking about it, the chaotic subharmonic is unlikely.<br><br>It's obvious I'm relying on one book, but anyway ... The example is for<br>Duffing's equation again:<br><br>                 x'' + k*x' + x^3 = G*cos(w*t)<br><br>The bifurcation parameter is G (really Gamma) which is the forcing<br>amplitude.  A period doubling cascade is demonstrated (pp336-345).<br><br>>>It's unlikely that a period 3 cascade could be picked out from a<br>chaotic<br>>>region with one parameter.<br>><br>>Not unlikely at all, I've done it with my vocal cords.<br><br>Well done!  How did you perform this experiment?<br><br>>>In the Mandelbrot set, though, there is a<br>>>fairly large period 3 region.  Similar things might occur with<br>>>differential equations of 2 parameters for all I'd know.<br><br>>Actually, a differential equation needs to have at least 3 parameters<br>>for chaos to occur. However, the picture along whichever of the<br>>parameters is responsible for chaos will be the good old bifurcation<br>>diagram. The Mandelbrot set represents a discrete (not continuous)<br>>dynamical system, which only needs one parameter to exhibit chaos. If<br>>you restrict yourself to the real line, you see the usual bifurcation<br>>diagram again (proceeding from right to left).<br><br>I meant that the bifurcation parameter becomes a plane, like the<br>Mandelbrot set, rather than that the system has two variables.  I can<br>see that isn't clear.<br><br>Minor correction: that should be "an autonomous differential<br>equation..."<br><br>>>I think there<br>>>might even be a period 3, 9, 27, ... cascade in the Mandelbrot set.<br>><br>>Naah, the Mandelbrot set is clearly all about period doubling; the<br>>iteration of a point on the set's boundary doubles the angle the point<br>>makes on the unit circle (to which the boundary can be conformally<br>>mapped). Although you could probably find some contorted path in the<br>>complex plane to support your guess.<br><br>You bet!  The way I would implement twelfth-reduction, though, is to use<br>a 1/3 order subharmonic generator, and repeat the process until the<br>frequency became suitably low.<br><br>Incidentally, Benoit Mandelbrot is a Polish mathematician, with some<br>links with France, working in the USA.  I have no idea how he pronounces<br>his name, but everyone I know, including one Italian who's met him,<br>sounds the last 't' in 'Mandelbrot'.</div>
