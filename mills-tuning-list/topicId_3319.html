But Partch scoffed at any reference to<br>>> "undertones" or the like,  calling them "hallucinations" or worse.<br>><br>> Where does he say this?  I am more familiar with his use of what he <br>> called "Utonality" - which was intervals formed from inversions of <br>> "Otonality" ie. Otonal intervals were derived from the overtone series,<br>while <br>> Utonal intervals were derived from the Undertone series.<br>><br>>(Just re-read Genesis a couple of months ago)> <br>><br> <br>I thought I remembered Partch saying that too, but I've looked<br>for the citation and can't find it.  On pages 75 and 89, however,<br>he does note the controversy surrounding the theory of an<br>"undertone series" and says that it is not a part of his theory.<br><br>Partch explained O- and Utonality not in terms of over- or undertone<br>series, but as an inherent dualistic numerical property of the ratios<br>themselves.  It so happens that these properties *do* explain the<br>over-/undertone series, but Partch did not use these as a basis<br>for his harmonic theories.<br><br>The theorist most associated with dualism was Hugo Riemann,<br>an Austrian who formulated his theories based on over-/undertones<br>in the late 19th century, but he too was uncomfortable with the<br>idea of an undertone series, and by the early part of this century<br>he had discarded it.<br><br>PS.  Anyone who gets hold of a copy of "Style and Idea" and<br>thinks of Schoenberg as being serious and having no sense of<br>humor should read the short "Sleepwalker" (as well as its longer<br>and more sober sequel "The Music Critic") -- it's a stinging<br>(and hilarious) attack on a critic who published a bad review<br>of a Schoenberg concert, even though he apparently saw only<br>about half of it!<br><br>   Joseph L.
