The musical meaning of integer levels of <br>consistency higher than 1, namely, the importance of matching just <br>intonation in combinations of n-limit intervals, I find dubious. So level 2 <br>consistency seems like an arbitrary requirement, as level 2.1 consistency <br>and level 1.9 consistency would lead to results which are slightly different <br>but just as meaningful musically.<br><br>One thing I looked at long ago was what we would now call level 3 <br>consistency, since 12-tET is just barely level 3 consistent at the 5-limit. <br>It seemed reasonable that an equal temperament could be "fuzzified" so that <br>it covered one-third of frequency space, while two-thirds remained <br>out-of-tune with respect to the equal temperament. The simplest qualifiers <br>are:<br><br><br>3-limit:	 5-tET<br>5-limit:	 12-tET<br>7-limit:	 31-tET<br>9-limit:	 171-tET<br>11-limit:	342-tET (=2*171)<br><br>My Commodore 64 couldn't do the higher-limit calculations within a <br>reasonable period of time, but these days it's just a few seconds:<br><br>13-limit:	5585-tET (=5*1117)<br>15-limit:	5585-tET<br>17-limit:	16808-tET (=22*764)<br>19-limit:	20203-tET (=89*227)<br><br> -Paul Erlich<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 18 Sep 1996 02:29 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08515; Wed, 18 Sep 1996 02:31:38 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07845<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id RAA16328; Tue, 17 Sep 1996 17:31:33 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 17 Sep 1996 17:31:33 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960917190242_480834378@emout09.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
