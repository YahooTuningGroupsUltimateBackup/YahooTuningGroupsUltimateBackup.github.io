I looked up the scale he posted in Helmholtz (p.518<br>of the Dover edition) and noticed that Ellis himself was somewhat dubious <br>about it.<br><br>Ellis (on p. 556 ) says that the King of Siam (sic) sent over his Court <br>Band with their instruments to the London Inventions Exhibition of 1885 <br>and the he and Hipkins were allowed to "determine the musical scale." A <br>Prince Prisdang said "the intention was to divide the octave into 7 equal<br>intervals." However, Ellis said he  found considerable deviation from the<br>ideal. <br><br>Ellis went on to say that the Ranat_s were tuned with lumps of wax <br>containing a heavy material and that all of them had been removed from <br>#85 (p. 518) in his tables and "hence it was entirely out of tune." <br><br>Furthermore he stated that only 21 of 52 measured intervals were between <br>160 and 179 cents (nominally 171).<br><br>Some "octaves" measured by Ellis:<br><br>Ranat Ek, wooden "harmonicon", 3 octaves, last incomplete<br>0 208 326 537 698 883 1048 1208<br>0 200 359 537 711 883 1057 1222<br>0 193 347 549 698 --  -- (two notes too high to measure)<br><br>Ranat t'hong (brass harmonicon)<br>0 200 340 537 699 881 1043 1207<br><br>Ranat lek (steel harmonicon) 3 octaves<br>0 --  327 519 679 856 1075 1202 (2nd bar missing)<br>0 150 299 447 614 743 960 1179<br>0 90 222 430 609 (incomplete octave)<br><br>Tak'hay (crocodile, 3 string instrument with high frets)<br>0 198 362 528 720 890 1080 1250<br><br>Theoretical 7-tet<br>0 171 343 514 686 857 1029 1200<br><br>0 129 277 508 726 771 1029 1254 (#85, p. 518)<br><br>As I recall, Thai music selects out 5 tone subscales from the<br>7-tone gamut so the actual scales may be something quite far <br>from 7-tet. There seems to a tendency to stretch the octave,<br>sharpen the fifth and possibly the first interval as well.<br><br><br>--John <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 17 Jun 1997 13:28 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04264; Tue, 17 Jun 1997 13:28:32 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 17 Jun 1997 13:28:32 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04267<br>Received: (qmail 4359 invoked from network); 17 Jun 1997 11:27:59 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 17 Jun 1997 11:27:59 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541106afcb3a3e133a@[207.207.2.58]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
