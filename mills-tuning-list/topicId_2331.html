Stieglitz, "Minoan<br>Mathematics or Music," Bull. Amer. Soc. of Papyrologists; Studies Presented<br>to Naphtali Lewis, vol. XV (1-2) (1978) pp. 127-132. Steiglitz argues,<br>quite convincingly, IMO, that an incomplete wall inscription from Hagia<br>Triada, Crete, in Linear A, is part of a tuning table or at least a<br>proto-Lambdoma as described by Plato, Nichomachus, et al. It appears to<br>contain the first four terms of the cycle of 3/2's, but at least 2 terms<br>are missing from the end. The numerals are accompanied by a rare<br>hieroglyphic sign which may mean length or even a monochord. As the<br>contemporary Babylonians and Egyptians, with whom the Minoans were in<br>cultural and commercial contact, already had well-developed musical systems<br>at the period of this inscription (2nd Millenium BCE), the musical<br>interpretation is plausible. The author, however, does admit that the table<br>could be purely mathematical.<br><br>--John<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  non12@deltanet.com<br>Subject:  Thanks, pentagram<br>PostedDate:  19-08-97 02:14:52<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  19-08-97 02:14:54-19-08-97 02:14:55,19-08-97 02:12:52-19-08-97 02:12:52<br>DeliveredDate:  19-08-97 02:12:52<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564F8.00015C56; Tue, 19 Aug 1997 02:14:51 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01333; Tue, 19 Aug 1997 02:14:52 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 19 Aug 1997 02:14:52 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01336<br>Received: (qmail 14488 invoked from network); 19 Aug 1997 00:12:33 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 19 Aug 1997 00:12:33 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.96.970818165427.15175A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
