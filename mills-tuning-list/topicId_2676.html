Three-valved brass instruments are<br>> actually seven natural horns sharing a bell and a mouthpiece.

Thus if the semitone valve<br>added a length exactly equal to 2^(1/12) of that of the open horn, then<br>when added to the horn *plus* the second or third valve it would no longer<br>lengthen the tube by as large a ratio, since the tube would be longer to<br>begin with (not a very good sentence but hopefully you get the point). The<br>third valve by itself lengthens the tube by more than the combination of<br>the first and second, because it's designed to be used only in tandem with<br>the other valves. That's why you use valves 1 + 2 to go down a minor<br>third, instead of valve 3. Seven independently tunable natural horns would<br>be a great thing in one instrument, but it can't be done with three<br>valves.<br><br>One exaggerated example to show why instrument makers have to compromise<br>on tube-lengths for the various valves: say your horn is 5 feet long, and<br>you want valve #1 to lower the pitch by a just minor third (5:6), then you<br>need one extra foot of tubing, right? If you want valve #2 to lower the<br>pitch of the open horn by a just minor sixth (5:8), then that valve should<br>have 3 feet of tubing... Problem is, if valve #2 is depressed, your "minor<br>third" valve now adds its foot of tubing to an 8-foot horn, so only lowers<br>the pitch by an 8:9 tone. Same sort of problems (but with messier, albeit<br>smaller numbers) apply to real-world "12tet" valves. So if you want to be<br>able to combine valves, you have to compromise on accuracy so they can be<br>used across the board. (Of course, players can and do correct for the<br>inaccuracy - it doesn't mean valved instruments can't play in 12tet, just<br>that the fundamentals of each valve combination aren't in *exact* 12tet<br>relationships.) <br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Fred Kohler" <Fred_Kohler@bc.sympatico.ca><br>Subject:  Re: TUNING digest 1246<br>PostedDate:  25-11-97 10:40:09<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  25-11-97 10:38:36-25-11-97 10:38:37,25-11-97 10:38:38-25-11-97 10:38:38<br>DeliveredDate:  25-11-97 10:38:38<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125655A.0034F6CD; Tue, 25 Nov 1997 10:38:30 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00511; Tue, 25 Nov 1997 10:40:09 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 25 Nov 1997 10:40:09 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00509<br>Received: (qmail 17376 invoked from network); 24 Nov 1997 12:13:24 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 24 Nov 1997 12:13:24 -0800<br>Message-Id: <01bcf914$612afa80$LocalHost@a1a05977><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
