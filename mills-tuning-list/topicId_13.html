Surely,<br>> they were different for ill-tempered tunings, but perhaps you never used<br>> one of those except for the keys it wasn't ill for.  But well-but-not-<br>> equal temperament tunings must also have given the same keys different <br>> flavors.  Or would the criterion for well-temperedness be precisely that<br>> these differences would be trivial?<br>> <br>> What bothers me --and this goes beyond WTC-- is this: Since composers<br>> had no control over the tuning of anybody else's instrument, how could<br>> they have counted on the flavor of a key?  <br><br>Actually, virtually all the circulating or "well" temperaments I've<br>worked with have some fairly significant characteristics in common:<br><br> 1.  The best available major third is always between C and E, or, if<br>     there are more than one "best" third, C-E is invariably one of them.<br><br> 2.  The _worst_ available major third (or one of them if there are<br>     more than one) is directly opposite C-E on the circle of fifths, or<br>     nearly so; usually F#-A#/Bb or C#/Db-F.<br><br> 3.  Between these two extrema, the quality of the thirds progresses<br>     without backtracking; i.e. on the sharp side, any particular major<br>     triad will have as good a third, or better, than its dominant, and<br>     on the flat side, the reverse is true.<br><br>--pH (manynote@library.wustl.edu or http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote)<br>       O<br>      /\             "Foul?
