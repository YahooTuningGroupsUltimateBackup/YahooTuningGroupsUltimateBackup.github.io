A while back, Morrison was chatting about the comma <br>encountered after a 12 note spiral of pure 5ths, which is a well known <br>phenomenon. As most theorists have done, he called this comma an "error" <br>(I've also seen it called an "anomaly"). However, I don't think "error" <br>is an appropriate name for this occurance, since it is a natural feature <br>of the spiral of 5ths...it IS the way it is, so how can it be an "error," <br>which implies a deviation from the way it "should" be? To me, that which <br>is natural is the norm...seems to me an "error" would be a departure from <br>the natural...Hstick</div>
