Hence, from this point of view, the various <br>JI scales would be most appropriate.<br><br>There is another issue...  early brass instruments <br>(more generally, any air column resonator that<br>is overblown) produces pitches with fundamentals<br>that very closely match the harmonic series<br>(one thinks of bugles, for instance). Hence "overtone scales"<br>might be another good choice, since they would mimic<br>the way the instrument works.<br><br>These two answers are not the same, but if you pick<br>your overtones carefully, then they are quite<br>close.<br><br>Bill Sethares</div>
