You to have to supply weights for 12 notes and then only 7<br>intervals are compared. Are you comparing the prime on purpose, or is<br>it always 0 cents? Is the resulting scale always symmetrical? The<br>error-function seems to be quadratic in the note values, and so far as<br>I can tell you need indeed an iterative procedure to find the minimum<br>of it. If there wouldn't be product terms of pitch variables then the<br>solution could be found algebraically by setting the derivative to <br>each of them to zero.<br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 21 Dec 1995 20:59 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA12991; Thu, 21 Dec 1995 11:59:15 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 21 Dec 1995 11:59:15 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01530501acff15d18060@[128.83.111.124]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
