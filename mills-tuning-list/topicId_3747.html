A year ago, I had my other piano - an old=<br>er one with a=0Awarm, not bright tone quality retuned from equal temperam=<br>ent to sixth comma MT=0Atemperament.  As I played that piano over the nex=<br>t days and weeks, my initial=0Asense of amazement that a piano, of all in=<br>struments, could sound so pleasingly=0Aharmonious grew even greater.  The=<br> change in tuning did wonders for that=0Apiano's overall resonance, givin=<br>g it an almost awe-inspiring "big" sound.  The=0Afact that I'd never seen=<br> or really seriously imagined a "change of heart" in a=0Apiano of this na=<br>ture before contributed to the overall impression.<br><br>Despite the overall reduction in sharpness of the major thirds from about=<br> 13.5=0Acents to a little over 7 cents (I'm sure there were deviations fr=<br>om target of=0A1, 2, and even three cents here and there), the sharpness =<br>of the thirds in=0Asixth comma MT was prominent in its overall sound.  Th=<br>e harmonies were warmer,=0Abut had a mild "impressionistic" vagueness whi=<br>ch I associate with 12 TET=0Aharmonies.  I had a desire to hear a piano t=<br>uned with the sharpness of the=0Athirds reduced even more and later began=<br> working with a rented piano tuned for=0Aa brief time to 5/24 comma MT (t=<br>hirds 3 and a half cents sharp) and then,=0Abecause even in that tuning t=<br>he sharpness of some of the thirds sometimes drew=0Aattention, quarter co=<br>mma MT temperament.  The increasing flatness of the=0Afifths which was ne=<br>eded to get the thirds down to just was so gradual that I=0Adidn't notice=<br> it at all until reaching the full quarter comma temperament.<br><br>Now, my rented Yamaha upright with a very bright tone quality - capable o=<br>f=0Asounding loud and harsh - has been retuned in the other direction fro=<br>m quarter=0Acomma MT to sixth comma MT.  My first impressions of the chan=<br>ge are a slight=0Asense of disappointment.  To me, overall the piano does=<br>n't sound quite as=0Asmooth and harmonious as it did in quarter comma.  I=<br>n fact, it almost sounds=0Aas though it had been put into equal temperame=<br>nt - but the wolves - with=0Athirds now only 28 cents sharp rather than 4=<br>0 cents sharp remove any doubt as=0Ato the fact that it's not in equal te=<br>mperament.<br><br>When I play pieces, trying to get them to sound really nice and harmoniou=<br>s, I=0Afeel some frustration.  Getting a good balance with the melody not=<br>es clear and=0Athe full harmonies continuously present is more difficult =<br>- at times upper=0Anotes which are thirds above the root will surge too l=<br>oud, or else they will=0Abe unexpectedly drowned out by lower notes.  The=<br> harmonies overall don't sound=0Aas smooth and pleasant.<br><br>However, in one piece - Long, long Ago - which I play with some 7th and 9=<br>th=0Achords marking important points in the piece - the sixth comma MT pe=<br>rformances=0Areally sound better and more musical than the quarter comma =<br>ones.  To me,=0Athere didn't seem to be anything out of place at all in u=<br>sing a just 5/4 for=0Awhat might be intended as a 9/7 in playing such a c=<br>hord in quarter comma MT -=0Aafter all, it's a twelve=96note=96per=96octa=<br>ve instrument.  But these chords have a=0Acertain sweetness and flexible =<br>musicality in the sixth comma MT - the sense of=0Athe different harmony o=<br>f the ninth chord as contrasted with that of a major=0Atriad - really com=<br>ing through - which isn't there in the quarter comma=0Arecordings.  Thus =<br>it seems that widening a 5/4 third by only 7 cents can make=0Ait a lot ea=<br>sier to "hear" it as something like a 9/7.  It may be that 12 TET=0Agives=<br> this same effect and that for many people who are less put=96off by the=<br>=0Adissonant (and for most contexts too=96sharp) thirds, the improved "re=<br>alism" of=0Aseventh and ninth chords in 12 TET outweighs its drawbacks.<br><br>There's another thing about the sixth comma MT which distinguishes it cle=<br>arly=0Afrom both quarter comma MT and 12 TET.  This is the quite noticeab=<br>le pulsating=0Aeffect, a quakiness or shakiness, which seems to be presen=<br>t most of the time -=0Aa wa=96wa=96wa=96wa=96wa kind of sound going on wi=<br>th a pulsation rate of about 2 to 4=0Aor 5 waves per second.  I believe t=<br>his is an effect of the reinforcement of=0Athe beating of the fifths, whi=<br>ch are flat by about one part in 480, and the=0Amajor thirds, which are s=<br>harp by exactly twice that amount - one part in 240.=0AWith the bright po=<br>werful Yamaha, this pulsating is quite noticeable, but it=0Ahadn't caught=<br> my attention (although it was present) with the other piano last=0Asumme=<br>r.<br><br>It is possible - maybe there are writings about this - that one of the=0A=<br>"fathers" of the piano, Gottfried Silbermann, has his name attached to th=<br>is=0Atemperament - the Silbermann temperament - because he wanted to give=<br> his=0Ainstrument a natural vibrato and could best achieve this effect by=<br> this=0Aparticular temperament.  An Italian writer on music described thi=<br>s temperament=0Aas "temperamento per comune opinione perfettissimo" in a =<br>work published in=0A1786.<br><br>Later today my piano tuner is coming again to put the piano into 12 TET a=<br>nd=0AI'll have a chance to see if that causes the piano to seem appreciab=<br>ly=0Adifferent than it does now in sixth comma MT, which now seems to me =<br>almost=0Alike 12 TET already.  Maybe I should enjoy the short time I have=<br> before he=0Acomes!<br><br>Just a couple additional observations: The major semitones are wide from =<br>a=0Ajust 16/15 in quarter comma by 5.4 cents, but they are narrow from 16=<br>/15 by=0A3.6 cents in sixth comma MT - a difference of 9 cents.  The whol=<br>e tones are=0Avery slightly wider (by 3.6 cents) in sixth comma MT, and t=<br>his also affects=0Athe overall impression.=0A</div><h3><a id=8105 href="#8105">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.
