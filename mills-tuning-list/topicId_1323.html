That would change<br>   if I could walk into the CD store and select 1 of hundreds of CDs in<br>   the "non-12TET" section, or find non-12TET music intermingled in the<br>   12TET sections as we now have it.<br><br>The primary obstacle to #4, is that the "common folk" don't care about<br>harmonic ratios etc, they care only about the emotional reactions they<br>have to the musical sounds that reach their ears.  If xenharmonic theory<br>enhances the musical sounds, that will be a Good Thing.  A theory<br>not put into practice has only intellectual value (and therefore very<br>little value to the "common folk"), but once that theory is put into<br>practice, then the benefit for the masses is achieved.<br><br>What is needed, I think, is some critical mass of practicing musicians doing<br>non-12TET.  Think how much different the landscape would be for non-12TET<br>if just 10% of the current 12TET musicians switched over.  There'd be a<br>lot of new "talents".  That would improve #4 a lot.  That would, I think<br>in the long run help all arenas of non-12TET.  That can happen if someone<br>can catch the 12TET's ears.  That can happen if we play what we speak.<br><br>So, let the intellectual discussions continue, they *are* important.  But<br>when the mood strikes, pick up that AXE, or Keyboard, or CPU and have a go<br>at the end product.
