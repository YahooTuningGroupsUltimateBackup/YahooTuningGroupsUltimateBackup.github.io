NB. The * represents multiplied by frequency <br>(i.e to give indication of octave)<br> <br> <br>So the notes which we produce produce from this are<br>A, C#, and E.<br> <br>The Spiral of fourths and fifths runs:<br> <br>A E B F# C# in one direction (Vths)<br>A D G C F Bb in the other.   (IVths).<br> <br> <br>So the ghosttones give us two new pitches in the fifths<br>direction E Vth and its octaves and<br>          C# III two ocatves higher.<br> <br>Remember A-C#-E  I-III-V (a major chord).<br>Now all we need to do is ascertain the "exact" value<br>of either the III or the Vth interval and we have the<br>tuning defined.<br> <br>By now resetting the string pitch we can generate all the<br>other notes that we need, and we find that the fret positions<br>match the touching positions as closely as we can measure.<br> <br>Hence as we know that IVth plus Vth equals an octave,<br>we can generate any number of steps of fourths and fifths.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>>Last post you said you could measure the frequencies of <br>>ghosttones without a tuner, using a metronome and a <br>>second string. Will you outline the exact procedure for <br>>doing this so I can proof your method? <br> <br>I need to get myself or build a metronome to reconstruct<br>the second part of these experiments, and when done will<br>complete it.<br>BTW A stable reference tone is also required (eg. tuning fork)<br>    to complete the experiment.<br> <br>>> The principle of this is explained in my spreadsheet which I<br>>> posted last week<br> <br>>I just reread it. You only posted the spreadsheet data <br>>with no explanation of the principle of beat frequencies.<br>>Be sure to include it in the next post. Thanks.<br> <br> <br>The figures for metronome readings represent the beat frequencies,<br>as beats per minute (i.e. tempo of the beating).<br> <br>I may need to reset the reference frequency on the<br>spreadsheet to get the bpm values for each stage and each<br>frequency,as I work through each new note that I wish to examine.<br>(That's the easy part)<br> <br> <br> <br>lucy Sunday morning - perfect Hawaiian sunshine with breeze.<br>I'm outta here for a while to search for a metronome.<br> <br>Does the posting about the Waldorf schools mean that jk,<br>(my four-year old) is being indoctrinated with JI at the <br>local Kinderhale?
