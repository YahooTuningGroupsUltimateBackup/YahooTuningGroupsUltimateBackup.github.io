Interesting tonalities and atleast to my <br>inexperienced ears,veers off 12-TET.If anyone could make  interesting <br>microtonal rock music AND get people to listen,it's these guys.<br>I think the album is called "Walking into Clarksdale".<br><br>About Steve Vai,he's never had a bigger fan than me ( I  owned a <br>Universe.No,no, I'm not a crazed megalomaniac,I speak of the 7-string <br>thing),but as I've gotten smarter (i.e. abandoned 12-TET for anything <br>else) and from what few words he's been quoted on non-12-TET ,I keep <br>wondering if he's just pulling our collective legs ? OR,perhaps some wise <br>magazine editor people have been filling up the cutting floor ? (No <br>offence to  David  Beardsley or 'zine people in general)<br><br>Paul  Erlich,I believe,said:<br>>I have two Ibanez 7-string guitars (which Steve Vai designed), one of which I<br>>had refretted to 22-TET. I'm sure he would love to know about that, if I knew<br>>how to get in touch with him!<br>It would be very interesting to get Vai to speak a bit about his <br>experiences with microtonality.<br>Like Neil says,if someone of Vai's stature had to put out real microtonal <br>music,it would make some waves.Besides,I have never come upon anyone with <br>a higher level of skills with the electric guitar.<br><br>Later,<br>Drew</div>
