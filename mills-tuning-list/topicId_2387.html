I really did not expect so much of a kind<br>spirit.  I guess microtonal people are the coolest.<br>I think microtonality could have a very definite demand, if infused into<br>what is termed pop music.  I think that experimental high level<br>compositions are very intersting, but I am surprised that no one really<br>works with simple popular forms.<br>The Kithara that I am making has a 12 strings arranged lyre fashion, i.e.<br>spread apart over an open space, and one of its arms has the fretboard on<br>it.  This arm itself will have four or six strings.  Of course, the body<br>is modified from its original cradle kithara shape to a more assymetrical<br>form in order to attain the proper angles and sonority.  It looks more<br>like (I believe) a sumerian harp, with arms pointing assymetrically.  My<br>major problem is, on the fretboard portion, how could I have the strings<br>tuned to non-unison notes with close to harmoniai scales possible.  Since<br>a non-unison string  would imply a different AP for that string, i.e. a<br>16/13 string using a 13/13 utonality, the fretboard would have to be<br>modified somehow.<br>Currently, the two possibilities I have are as follows:<br>1)Angle the frets.  This would cause a serious "obliqueness" near the high<br>notes.<br>2)Use the 4/3, 3/2 system you described earlier.  This is actually pretty<br>appealing, as AP tetrachords would be available.  But, the scales if<br>played on multiple strings would not be pure KS harmoniai.<br>3)Cut the frets into little pieces.  I don't like this very much, just<br>because of the aesthetics.<br>Yeah, I'm doing Greek, and plan to be doing a harmoniai/tetrachord reading<br>of Sappho and Alcaeus with a nice complex rhythm and bass behind it.  See,<br>this is not traditional, and not really esoteric, because I think a drum<br>rhythm and funky bass would add what some pop people call "jive".  But, it<br>would still be microtonal.<br>THanks a lot.  Are there any college students or youngger in this group?<br>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>[Peter Blasser, Oberlin College Mailroom Box #277, Oberlin, Ohio ,.<br>[Peter.Blasser@Oberlin.edu       .             .            .           .<br>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  DFinnamore@aol.com<br>Subject:  Re: TUNING digest 1176<br>PostedDate:  13-09-97 01:05:50<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  15-09-97 10:14:08-15-09-97 10:14:10,15-09-97 10:13:28-15-09-97 10:13:28<br>DeliveredDate:  15-09-97 10:13:28<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256510.00801781; Sat, 13 Sep 1997 01:05:39 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA32683; Sat, 13 Sep 1997 01:05:50 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 13 Sep 1997 01:05:50 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA32699<br>Received: (qmail 7974 invoked from network); 12 Sep 1997 23:01:57 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 12 Sep 1997 23:01:57 -0000<br>Message-Id: <970912185139_434888412@emout03.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
