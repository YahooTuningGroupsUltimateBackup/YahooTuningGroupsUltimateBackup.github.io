Erlich wrote:<br>>> ><br>>> >} In his "Harmonielehre" [1911], p. 24-25, Schoenberg<br>>> >} explained...<snip><br>><br>> This sounds to me like 5-limit just intonation as a basis for <br>> conventional harmonic theory, a further developing of<br>> Helmholtz in using the overtones as a foundation for<br>> harmony.  Illustrating partials up to the 12th or further<br>> merely underlines the exactness inherent in the series.   <br><br>Monzo:<br>First, it was I and not Erlich who gave the Schoenberg<br>citation quoted above.<br><br>It's true that Schoenberg envisioned the basic scale as<br>a 5-Limit just system.  But what did you mean in that<br>last sentence, about underlining exactness?  Is this a<br>reference to the fact that as you go higher in the overtone<br>series, the partials divide the pitch-space into ever-smaller<br>increments?<br><br>Reinhard:<br>> <snip>...Shoenberg defined dissonances as corresponding<br>> to the remote overtones.  His was an open theory that <br>> may have accounted for jazzy, pop, and other interval<br>> invasions to previous theory.  Forgive me for speculating.<br><br>Monzo:<br>Indeed, Schoenberg's tonal theory is almost exactly the same<br>as much of the established basics of jazz harmony.  His<br>most important (and controversial) idea was this very one.<br>"Dissonances" did not have to sound quickly according<br>to rules, but could be used as regular chord members,<br>because several higher overtones come close to these<br>(12-eq) notes.<br><br>Note that Schoenberg hedges his bets by saying at the<br>outset that his exposition is "based on the _possibly<br>uncertain_ overtone theory" [emphasis mine], and that<br>he used it because it seemed, in his experience, to<br>agree best with the facts of musical usage by the<br>German masters (who are the only ones important<br>to Schoenberg).<br><br>Reinhard:<br>> <snip>  Schoenberg describes temperament as an<br>> indefinitely extended truce (Harmonielehre p.25) and says<br>> the chord is the synthesis of the tone.  Would either<br>> Partch or Erlich disagree?  <br><br>Monzo:<br>Hey, don't leave me out of this!  I've written a _lot_ on<br>the rational implications represented in Schoenberg's theories.<br><br>I _do_ think Partch would disagree with this: as I pointed out,<br>he emphazed that the undertone series _as an acoustical<br>phenomenon_  was not a part of his theory, but the mathematics<br>involved in calculating it was.<br><br>Erlich would probably disagree too, just because he likes to<br>disagree (-- but that's OK by me, Paul; in fact it's healthy in<br>this forum).<br><br>Reinhard:<br>><snip><br>> Frankly, this is more tomfoolery than it is decisive.  Schoenberg <br>> never pretended to understand the mathematics, preferring to<br>> let the music speak for him and to apply intuition and the<br>> reservior of theory as it existed at that time.   <br><br>Monzo:<br>I must agree wholeheartedly with the second sentence here.<br>Schoenberg expressed in several of his writings that he usually<br>composed very spontaneously, and a notorious tidbit of Schoenbergian<br>musical history is that he wrote his opera "Erwartung" in 17 days<br>(summer of 1909), and even though I believe scholarship has found<br>this to be somewhat exaggerated, the piece was still written in<br>a very short time, no longer than a couple of months.  To have<br>written what I consider to be the most experimental piece of<br>his career (a career which lasted another four decades!) and<br>the one furthest removed from any conception of what a piece<br>of music was up to that time, in such a short fury of inspiration,<br>underlines to me how far Schoenberg trusted his instincts.<br>In fact, his whole speculative theoretical output (i.e., that other<br>than what he considered to be tutoring in "composer's basic<br>training") is merely an attempt to provide some kind of rational<br>[note well that word! -- but used here in its sense of "logical",<br>not as referring to ratios] underpinning for the radical sonic<br>structures he wrote into his pieces.<br><br>Reinhard, from Tuning Digest 1379:<br>> Schoenberg did imagine music microtonally.  And<br>> with his gift of musicianship he could imagine much<br>> more than is usual.  He wrote of 53ET to Busoni...<snip><br><br>Monzo:<br>In "Harmonielehre", on the pages we are here discussing,<br>Schoenberg cites both Busoni's musings on 36-ET and a<br>certain Dr. Robert Neumann on 53-ET.  He first maintains<br>that at some future date the world will be ready to accept<br>such enlarged scale resources, then scoffs at the idea that<br>musicians in 1911should be bothered with such<br>number-play, as "12 x 12 notes provides more than<br>enough to explore" for the forseeable future, and never<br>mentions microtonal intervals again (or possibly mentions<br>them only once more in passing).<br><br>In several places throughout his theoretical writings,<br>Schoenberg (seemingly proudly) announces his ignorance<br>of musical mathematics, until one finally finds a footnote<br>explaining some simple ratios in his "Preliminary Exercises<br>in Counterpoint" [1963], written near the end of his life.<br><br>Judging by all accounts I've read, both Partch and Schoenberg<br>each must have had a profoundly sensitive ear for pitch.<br>Schoenberg, after all, is the person who came up with the<br>idea of "tone-color melodies", that is, instruments of several<br>different timbres playing succesively the same note, with the<br>different overtones of the different timbres providing a sort of<br>"melody of overtones".  This is the last idea in "Harmonielehre"<br>(and was actually explored on chords in the middle piece of<br>"5 Pieces for Orchestra" [1909]), and was surely the most<br>far-out idea presented in a harmony book up to that time.<br><br>Reinhard, from Tuning Digest 1381:<br>> Most troubling for me was the basis of Helmholtz for<br>> Schoenberg's theories, but with nary a mention.<br><br>Monzo:<br>As has been pointed out before (in a JMT article, possibly<br>also in the translator's preface to the 1978 English edition<br>of "Harmonielehre"), although Schoenberg professed to being<br>"self-taught" with the exception of his lavishly-credited<br>instruction from Zemlinsky, he does use many concepts<br>from several different turn-of-the-century theoretical treatises,<br>which _can_ be identified along with their authors, and<br>Schoenberg gives no references by name, with the single<br>exception of a focused attack on Schenker.<br><br>Although this is possibly just an attempt by Schoenberg<br>at assuming credit for as much as possible in his book, he<br>does address the lack of references early in the book by<br>saying that he only read the other books casually and<br>retained the good ideas without the extraneous information.<br> <br>There's another perplexing aspect to Schoenberg's lack<br>of interest in using ratios in harmony.  There is a book<br>published recently which I saw in the library -- I have<br>neither title nor author, but I think it's called "The Composer<br>as Numerologist" -- which purports to explain Schoenberg's<br>pre-compositional techniques as being based on<br>numerology.  It has been quite definitely reported<br>(see Stuckenschmidt's biography) that Schoenberg<br>was a believer in numerology, and it seems that this<br>was passed on to his pupil Berg.  (I'm not sure about<br>Webern in this regard -- anyone out there know?).<br><br>The argument in this book seems pretty plausible to<br>me, but it astonishes me that a composer so hung<br>up on numbers _and_ on explaining "dissonant" chord<br>tones as high overtones, would fail to see the relevance<br>and importance of using ratios as a notation for pitch.<br>I got into a small debate with Sandy McCroskey over<br>this, and he emphasized Schoenberg's conception of<br>the "democratization of the 12 tones".  This sounded<br>reasonable to me, but surely someone with an ear<br>as good as Schoenberg's could tell the difference<br>between the 12-eq notes and their supposed rational<br>implications.  So why not use ratios, and play with<br>_those_ numbers instead of the ones representing<br>the 12-eq pitch set??????<br><br>   Joseph L.
