In reading the<br>statement by Harry on the front of this booklet I was amazed how these words<br>could just as easily be applied to those of us working in the computer media-<br>especially the first two paragraphs. So I thought I should share them with you.<br><br><br>Allen Strange<br><br>========================== Tear Here ========================================<br><br>It is inherent in the being of the creative art worker to know and<br>understand the materials he needs, and to create them where they do not<br>exist, to the best of his ability. In music, this characteristic must go far<br>beyond the mere competence to compose and analyze a score.  It is more<br>difficult for the composer to create the colors of needed sound than it is for<br>the painter to create the colors of needed light, but it is no less important<br>that he find it possible to do so.  The usual musical traditions are against<br>him in the effort, in our time they are recognizable as traditions  only when<br>they have reached the comfortable plateau of academic security. But the<br>rebelliously creative act is also a tradition, and if our art of music is to be<br>anything more than a shadow of its past, the traditions in question must<br>periodically shake off dominant habits and excite themselves into palpable<br>growth.<br><br>If one must have the feeling of historical respectability beneath him in<br>order to function, our world provides it in myriad variety, beyond the<br>immediate local, before the immediate past.  He does not need to become<br>an archeologist to realize that there is hardly an exotic line he could write,<br>a variant article he could create, or a singular idea he could brew, that<br>would be not felicitous in some tradition, at some point on the globe, at<br>some conjectured time in the cultural past.  My instruments belong to<br>many traditions, especially including the present one: affirmation of<br>parentage provides the primary substance of rebellion.<br><br>There tuning is based on the 43-tone-to-the-octave system of acoustic---<br>not equal--- intonation, which is explained in by book, Genesis of a Music,<br>published by the University of Wisconsin Press in 1949.  A new range of<br>melodic resources, a new series of tonal relationships, and a new<br>perspective on consonance and dissonance are all implicit in the system..<br>Beyond these severely definable ideas is the music itself, elusive to words,<br>I call corporeal, because it roots itself with other arts necessary to<br>civilization, in a unity that is important to the whole being--- mind and<br>body.  Even the visual element of seeing the instruments played is a vital<br>one.<br><br>I began designing and building instruments nearly forty years ago. Five of<br>those represented here are explained in my book.  The other have been<br>built since the time of that publication. All have been built and rebuilt---<br>one of them seven times--- to improve quality.  No two are exactly alike.  I<br>am not an instrument builder, but a philosophic music-man seduced into<br>carpentry.<br>H.P.--- June, 1962<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 8 Nov 1995 21:39 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA15194; Wed, 8 Nov 1995 11:39:14 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 8 Nov 1995 11:39:14 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9511081423.D9503-0100000@email.ir.miami.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2290 href="#2290">ðŸ”—</a>masa@gold.interlog.com (marc sabat)</h3><span>11/8/1995 8:53:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Whose music truly has tonal motion?<br>>        Harry Partch's -no<br>>        La Monte Young's -no<br>>        James Tenney's -no<br><br>Wondering if you've heard Tenney's Harmonium #5 for string trio (on<br>ARRAYMUSIC's CD "Strange City/Ville Etrange", Artifact Records<br>(http://www.io.org/~artifac/).<br><br>I find this piece has fairly non-static harmonic motion.<br><br><br>- Marc Sabat<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 9 Nov 1995 07:22 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA28926; Wed, 8 Nov 1995 21:22:23 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 8 Nov 1995 21:22:23 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9511090003.A22166-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2291 href="#2291">ðŸ”—</a>Johnny Reinhard &#x3C;reinhard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/8/1995 9:22:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Dear Adam,<br><br>If you define JI in 12 tones per octave and they are based on the the <br>better resultion of 12 ET than you should not be surprised if a listener <br>hears very little difference.  My wife Mayumi uses only 12 notes in JI, <br>but they are all made up of ratios of the 13th harmonic.  This provides <br>for the melodic angularity you are seeking, while enriching the harmony <br>with sure and meaningful relationships, and a fresh sound to boot.<br><br>Surely a restriction of only 12 keys is still a restriction and this can <br>be overcome by writing for another instrument (or more) playing with the <br>restricted keyboard.  The additional instruments can play additional <br>microtones.  Wyschnegradsky's *Meditation* has the cello (or in my case <br>bassoon) playing quartertones and sixthtones against a conventionally <br>tuned piano extremely effectively.<br><br>My belief is that 7-limit JI is to organically harmonic to provide the <br>melodic angularity wanted - everything blends.  11-limit is able to <br>present "grey" sounds, a quartertone dimension, and opens up directional <br>melody.
