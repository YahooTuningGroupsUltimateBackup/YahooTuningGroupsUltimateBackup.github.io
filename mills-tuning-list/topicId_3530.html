He tells me that Buzz figured out the system by ear and that <br>the patent does not tell the whole story. Further, he states that the <br>luthier who helped Buzz implement the physical modification of the <br>fingerboard is responsible for some of the misinformation and misuse of <br>the terms meantone and well temperament appearing in the ads and interviews.<br>	I am told that the nut is shifted and angled, the strings are tuned <br>slightly differently from 12TET and the bridge compensation is tuned <br>differently from standard practice. My luthier contact, who is familiar with <br>the history of tuning and temperaments says that the method really does <br>reduce out of tuneness, especially when a modified guitar plays with a <br>piano. This seems to indicate that there is some stretching. I still <br>don't know the lowdown skinny on what it does "really", but it would be <br>interesting to find out in more detail and do an analysis. <br>	Was my previous post a little harsh on Buzz? Perhaps. I was <br>incensed by the misinformation in the literature I had read, but <br>apparently the patent does not tell the whole story, and the ads a <br>distorted story. I am told that Buzz is innocent of the promulgation of <br>buzzwords, and I aploogize for any blame I may have thrown his way.   <br><br>John Starrett<br>http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</div>
