I just downloaded the Yamaha S-YXG50 <br>software synthesizer (30 day free trial) which sells for about $30.00, <br>and I am really impressed. Although it is not appropriate for live <br>performance due to a 500 ms delay between MIDI input and sound output, it <br>has some very impressive sounds, and seems to deal really well with pitch <br>bend microtonal MIDI. <br><br>http://www.yamaha.co.uk/shop/home.asp<br><br>John Starrett<br>http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1519<br>*************************</div><h3><a id=8427 href="#8427">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;M.

However, as some of us have discussed before, there can be<br>> two equally useful concepts, an odd limit (closer to Partch's usage<br>> and useful for describing sonorities) and a prime limit (useful for<br>> describing resources of JI systems). The chords 12:15:18:20 and<br>> 12:14:18:21 are what I call the two "saturated 9-limit tetrads," since<br>> all the intervals in each chord are ratios of 9 or less, and no notes<br>> can be added to either chord without increasing the odd limit, and<br>> there are no other chords with these properties.<br><br>As a medievalist, I find that this distinction raises an interesting<br>question: which 9-based sonorities can be viewed as "complex 3-limit<br>sonorities," and which should be classed as specific to "9-limit"<br>tunings in Partch's sense?<br><br>I would tend to say that 4:6:9 (an actual Gothic sonority) and<br>(theoretically) 1:3:9, for example, are extended 3-limit sonorities,<br>but that 6:7:9 is 9-limit, not 3-limit (in part because it includes a<br>ratio based on 7, a larger prime than 3, of course).<br><br>The next quote refers back to 12:15:18:20 and 12:14:18:21:<br><br>> (Incidentally, both chords can be called minor seventh chords, as<br>> the first is octave-equivalent to 10:12:15:18.) This type of chord<br>> seems to have been missed by Partch, who may not have realized that<br>> utonalities and otonalities are not the only possible saturated<br>> chords for odd limits 9 and up. So perhaps you were thinking of the<br>> odd limit of the second chord, and the prime limit of the first<br>> chord?<br><br>Indeed, my recollections of writing the original post seem to fit well<br>with the explanation that I mixed the "prime limit" and "odd limit"<br>concepts without realizing the inconsistencies. Thanks to your<br>query, I've maybe become able to articulate why. First, a quick<br>historical aside on octave equivalence and inversion.<br><br>Certainly in the immediate context of the discussion, "since the time<br>of Debussy," we could apply the octave equivalence and inversion<br>concepts to call both sonorities "minor seventh chords." For the sake<br>of completeness, I should mention that in other periods, different<br>views (and appropriate terminologies) may prevail.<br><br>While the usual "inversion" concept draws a connection between<br>sonorities which might share the same pitch classes (e.g. e-g-b-d' and<br>g-b-d'-e'), medieval and Renaissance theory tend to focuses on<br>sonorities sharing the same _intervals_. Thus in medieval terms, the<br>first combination might be described as a "major sixth sonority," and<br>the second as a "minor seventh sonority."<br><br>In classical 18th-century theory, based on Rameau, g-b-d'-e' might be<br>described as _either_ an "added-sixth chord" or a "minor seventh chord<br>in inversion," depending on the context. This might be an interesting<br>case where even in a stylistic setting where "inversional equivalence"<br>usually holds, it gets qualified a bit in at least some areas of<br>theory. <br><br>I'm fascinated that Partch apparently didn't consider these combinations.. <br>This sounds like a significant point that I'd love to see further<br>developed. <br><br>Again, your suggestion that I may have been applying the "largest<br>prime" concept to the first ratio, but the odd-limit concept to the<br>second, nicely explains my inconsistencies here. However, there's<br>another complicating factor we're about to consider.<br><br>> But then you go on to say,<br><br>> > Similarly, in Gothic style, a combination of three superimposed<br>> > thirds (e.g. e-g-b-d') may resolve to a stable 3-limit sonority<br>> > (e.g. f-c'); in triadic harmony, it may resolve to a 5-limit<br>> > sonority; in 7-limit harmony, it may serve as a stable tetrad.<br><br>> Now any chord that could be notated as e-g-b-d' cannot be a stable<br>> tetrad if the odd limit is 7, so you must be back to the prime limit<br>> definition and thinking of 12:14:18:21, or you should have said 9<br>> instead of 7, in which case you could have meant either 12:14:18:21 or<br>> 10:12:15:18.<br><br>First, of course, you're absolutely right that I should have said<br>"9-limit" instead of "7-limit" in reference to a stable 12:14:18:21<br>tetrad (odd-limit sense).<br><br>Now we come to a critical point which may be of interest in many<br>discussions of "harmonic evolution" and JI theory, and which you have<br>very helpfully brought into focus.<br><br>If these ratios really mean what they say, a not-unfair assumption,<br>then indeed they are impossible without a 9:7 interval, calling for a<br>9-(odd)-limit system in order for the tetrad to be stable.<br><br>However, what I left vaguely floating somewhere out there in my<br>conceptual space is the awareness that in a medieval 3-limit<br>(Pythagorean) context, or the 12-tone equal temperament (12-tet)<br>context assumed by much 20th-century keyboard music, the tuning does<br>_not_ actually treat minor sevenths as 7-based intervals, and nor does<br>it have anything very close to a 9:7.<br><br>In medieval 3-limit (Pythagorean) just tuning, for example, we have<br>54:64:81:96, or notes at about 0-294-702-996 cents; in a 20th-century<br>keyboard setting premised on 12-tet, we have notes at 0-300-700-1000<br>cents. In both cases, the m7 is at or close to 16:9, not 7:1, and the<br>thirds at or closer to 3-limit than to either 5-limit or 7-limit/9-limit<br>(6:7, 9:7).<br><br>Note that your possible 5-(prime)-limit interpretation of e-g-b-d' as<br>10:12:15:18, or about 0-316-702-1018 cents, involves the ratio 18:10<br>(9:5) for the minor seventh, but does _not_ involve any 9:7 large<br>major third, arguably an interval involving a distinctive level of<br>tension not found except in the version involving ratios with _both_ 7<br>and 9 as factors. Similarly, the 3-limit tuning involves 16:9 for this<br>minor seventh, but not a 9:7 third, which seems to me a definitive<br>interval for "9-(odd)-limit" in a certain idiomatic sense of "a system<br>of stable sonorities including the ratio between the odd-limit 9 and<br>the nearest smaller prime of 7."<br><br>In other words, what I suspect I may have been doing without realizing<br>it was to focus on the prime limit of 3 or 5 where the sonority has a<br>16:9 or 9:5 interval but no 9:7 interval, but to focus on the odd<br>limit when 9:7 was present.<br><br>This raises an interesting question: how _should_ we describe e-g-b-d'<br>as a stable 20th-century sonority on a 12-tet organ or piano, say?<br>Should we use "n-limit" terminology at all when the actual tuning in<br>question doesn't really fit such a model, and more closely fits<br>3-limit than 5-limit or 7-limit/9-limit?<br><br>While writing as imprecisely as I did may not necessarily be cause for<br>great celebration, having a reader such as yourself to point out my<br>inconsistencies, thus inviting more careful consideration of some<br>underlying issues, may be beneficial not only to me but to the<br>progress of xenharmonics.<br><br>> An easy way to get a feel for these and other possibilities on almost<br>> any retunable synth is to use a 12-out-of-22 tuning where E-F and B-C<br>> are 1/22 oct intervals and all the rest are 2/22 oct. Then:<br><br>                     [ ... ]<br><br>> 7) The interval B-f approximates 11:8 with an error of 6 cents and<br>> sounds good in the chord B-a-b-eb'-f, which approximates<br>> 4:7:8:10:11. It is interesting to resolve this interval by contrary<br>> motion through the very incisive 1/22 oct intervals to c-e. The latter<br>> interval is approximates a 9:7 with an error of 1 cent and is<br>> therefore more stable than B-f. 9:7 sounds like a traffic noise to<br>> most people unless supplied with a context, such as D-Gb-A-c-e, which<br>> approximates 4:5:6:7:9.<br><br>Curiously, I've tried this kind of Renaissance-Romantic era resolution<br>of a diminished fifth to a large major third using two voices, e.g.<br><br>f'-e'<br>b -c'<br><br>in 17-tet, where the resolution isn't _quite_ so incisive (b-c'<br>and f'-e' being 1/17 octave, or about 70.6 cents, rather than the 54.5<br>cents of 22-tet). In 17-tet, the large major third is a bit smaller,<br>being 6/17 octave or about 423.5 cents.<br><br>It seemed to work nicely, and maybe demonstrates Ludmila Ulehla's<br>concept of a "dual-purpose" sonority: the 17-tet M3 can be quite<br>urgently "discordant," and yet relatively "restful" when it follows a<br>diminished fifth (8/17 octave, about 564.7 cents).<br><br>Typically I might use 17-tet in a more Gothic manner as a<br>"hypermodern" variation on Pythagorean, but it's interesting that the<br>Renaissance and later d5-M3 resolution (which Zarlino recognizes as<br>very pleasing in 1558) also works well in this tuning.<br><br>[The following message by Paul refers to this "12-out-of-22" scheme<br>for tuning 22-tet with e-f and b-c' equal to 1/22 octave and all other<br>intervals to 2/22 octave, which he points out could nicely fit the<br>"neo-late-Gothic" applications I mentioned in my review]<br><br>> I wrote,<br>> <br>> > 5) A major, A-flat major, C minor, and C-sharp minor give<br>> > approximate 5-limit just intonation, in a fashion analogous to the<br>> > late Gothic keyboard tuning.<br><br>> > I meant the _keys_ that are conventionally called A major, A-flat<br>> > major, C minor, and C-sharp minor, not (just) the _chords_ that go<br>> > by those names.

Authors<br>sometimes attempt to apply 18th-century key concepts in explaining the<br>development of these tunings, as with Owen Jorgensen in _Tuning the<br>Historical Temperaments by Ear_ (Northern Michigan University Press,<br>Marquette, 1977), e.g. pp. 48-56.<br><br>My caution would be that major/minor key systems are really specific<br>to European music of the era around 1680-1900, and to subsequent works<br>following such styles.<br><br>In the early 15th-century context of the Pythagorean tunings with<br>prominent schisma thirds and sixths, for example, we can best<br>understand the role of these intervals by focusing on Gothic concepts<br>of harmonic action and color.<br><br>This situation may be very analogous to the 22-tet nomenclature issues<br>you discussed in your initial reply, emphasizing that either decatonic<br>or more conventional notations might be appropriate depending on the<br>musical context.<br><br>To take one quick example, consider a sonority with smooth schisma<br>thirds and sixths in the tuning with a Wolf at F#-B (actually Gb-B) of<br>around 1400: e-g#-c#'. To understand the harmonic role of this<br>sonority, we need to be familiar with one of the most popular final<br>cadences of the epoch, and indeed of the preceding century:<br><br>c#'-d'<br>g# -a<br>e  -d<br><br>Here the major third expands to a stable fifth, and the major sixth to<br>a stable octave. The schismatic tuning doesn't alter this basic<br>vertical logic, but gives the cadence a different color both by making<br>the M3 and M6 somewhat smoother than in a usual Pythagorean tuning,<br>and by making the melodic semitones g#-a and c#'-d' somewhat less<br>keen and efficient.<br><br>This point quite aside, I'm fascinated and delighted to see a<br>discussion of 22-tet as a "neo-late-Gothic" tuning lead to possible<br>5-limit applications in later stylistic contexts. This is also a<br>striking illustration of how the same combinations of notes might be<br>useful in _either_ a 15th-century or 18th-century context, although<br>the progressions and the expectations behind them might be very<br>different.<br><br>Most appreciatively,<br><br>Margo Schulter<br>mschulter@value.net<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1520<br>*************************</div>
