I think that experimental high level<br>>>  compositions are very intersting, but I am surprised that no one really<br>>>  works with simple popular forms.<br>><br>>I think you have a very good idea, there, Peter.  Pop music, in the sense of<br>>hit music, has run the gamut (no pun intended) of harmonic possibilities and<br>>come back around to three chords and a bad lyric.<br><br>I will jump in here to stand up for a couple of people who *do* write<br>microtonal pop music, especially Jon Catler and Neil Haverstick.  Neil<br>contributes to this list often, and plays blues/rock on guitar and bass in<br>a myriad of tunings.  Jon plays all sorts of music, from experiemntal<br>improv to more rock and blues-based tunes.  Denny Genovese's band plays<br>poppy stuff with a world-music orientation, although it might sometimes<br>cross over the "art" world.<br><br>Anyway, I find that most folk music with open guitar or banjo tunings in in<br>pretty good intonation, often with an inventive quality as far as tuning is<br>concerned.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with "experimental high level" music, though.  It<br>usually seems that someone willing to get involved with the microtonal<br>theory is usually bent towards the experimental aesthetic.<br><br>Adam B.
