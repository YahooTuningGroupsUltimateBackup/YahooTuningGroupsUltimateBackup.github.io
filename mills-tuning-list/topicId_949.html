I presented a list of just, perceptually distinct 3rds,<br>5ths, 7ths, 9ths, and 11ths that I recently developed, and provided examples<br>which demonstrated voice-leading between the ET representatives of those<br>intervals.<br><br><<I will post more details about this list of intervals in the coming weeks.>><br><br>In the composition seminar later that afternoon, I discussed my general<br>aesthetic, and presented xenharmonic and xenrhythmic works of mine, and talked<br>about my Clavette microtonal MIDI keyboard.<br><br>Quite a few students were interested, and had some tough and interesting<br>questions for me.<br><br>I left Michael Matthews, the resident composer and head of the electronic<br>studios, with copies of examples from the lecture, spreadsheets with interval<br>ratios for 19, 22, 27 and 31-ET, and a sheet of formulas for ET and JI<br>calculations, which hopefully some students will find useful.<br><br>At the end of the day, I completed arrangements which allowed me to take <br>their standard keyboard Scalatron and the Electrical Engineering Departments<br>17/19-tone digital organ back to Minneapolis. Unfortunately, both instruments<br>are not working, but I intend to get them fixed over the coming months. <<The<br>17/19-tone digital organ is described in Tempered Music Scales for Sound<br>Synthesis by M. Yunik and G.W. Swift, in the Computer Music Journal Vol. 4 #4,<br>Winter 1980.>><br><br>I enjoyed meeting Professor Swift, Music Dept. head Richard Wedgewood, and<br>appreciated Michael Matthews hospitality.<br><br>After reading about Johnny Reinhardts visit to Brookings, South Dakota, I am<br>thinking that I might eventually arrange a midwestern concert tour with the<br>Clavette and perhaps these other instruments and additional performers.<br><br>Yours truly,<br>Harold Fortuin <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 30 Sep 1996 20:09 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06639; Mon, 30 Sep 1996 19:09:48 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07347<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA07798; Mon, 30 Sep 1996 11:09:41 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 30 Sep 1996 11:09:41 -0700<br>Message-Id: <82960930180728/0005695065PK3EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3725 href="#3725">ðŸ”—</a>PAULE &#x3C;ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/1996 10:30:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Daniel,<br>Let's try to wind this up.<br><br>>I know, for example, that I can hear,<br>>identify, and reproduce the sine wave complex 500, 600, 750 Hz. I hear it<br>>distinctly as a "minor" triad and neither as a mistuned harmonic series<br>>segment where 500Hz = 2^n nor as a harmonic series segment over the<br>>fundamental of 50Hz.<br><br>Okay, well that is different from my experience, and seems different from <br>any documented psychoacoustic phenomena. But that doesn't mean you're wrong. <br>How well does this extend up to, say, 11-limit hexads? I've found that <br>tuning an 11-limit otonal hexad is easy, even with sine waves, while tuning <br>an 11-limit utonal hexad, without listening to smaller subsets while tuning, <br>is nearly impossible, unless the tones are unusually rich in harmonic <br>partials.<br><br>>(2) Phase differences can have dramatic effects on pitch perception. With<br>>long duration sound installations, the relative phase positions are<br>>apparent in physical space. I recently heard an extraordinary installation<br>>by Hauke Harder in Copenhagen, where phase relationships were essentially<br>>the only dynamic element in the work. When phases were locked this entire<br>>quality disappeared. Young has worked with _drifting_ phases and has made<br>>some interesting psychoacoustical conjectures. (I have had similar - but<br>>not precisely so - experiences in recording sine wave complexes from my<br>>Rayna synthesize onto CD or DAT, where differences in sampling speed all<br>>but destroyed entire works).<br><br>Well, the effect is apparantly specialized enough that most music retains <br>its character, since the BBE hardware works by reducing peaks through <br>judicious frequency-dependent phase-shifts. This is what I thought you were <br>talking about, the relative phases of two different partials in a harmonic <br>relationship.<br><br>>(3) A spacing theory would be a method of analysis and not a theory of<br>>composition, although the information obtained might be useful to<br>>composers. Last time I checked, composers were free to proceed with or<br>>without a theory.<br><br>By a theory of composition I meant a method of analyzing compositions, just <br>as a theory of physics does not cause physical phenomena to occur but merely <br>explains them.<br><br>>(4) I believe your procedure is closely tied to western musical materials<br>>(I try to be a bit more global in my approach, but the simple matter is<br>>that the number of repertoires with pitch complexes of three or more<br>>members is limited; a parallel project of mine involves harmonization<br>>procedures for repertoires with melodic properties distinctive from the<br>>German folksongs upon which classical chorale harmonization is based); for<br>>this reason, a coupling of your algorithm with an approach to chord<br>>progression is worthwhile if not necessary, since your procedure demands<br>>parameters only close to those offered by traditional western classical and<br>>vernacular musics. In this (broadly defined) repertoire, contrast between<br>>harmonic structures is a (if not THE) defining feature.<br><br>Yikes. I don't see where you're getting this, and I should also point out <br>that a pitch complex of two members is enough.<br><br>Look, I'm only trying to explain certain features of the musical experience <br>here, namely phenomena that are due to what is going on at a given instant <br>in time. Whether a certain chord is a tension or a relaxation will obviously <br>depend on what goes on *before* and *after*, but there is a component that <br>depends on the *during*, and one of the two components of that is related to <br>the virtual pitch detection process. I feel it is very important to model <br>and understand this process, becuase it is so strong as to convert all <br>near-simultaneous near-harmonic sine-wave complexes into single sensations. <br>To assume it has no impact on the musical effect of harmony would be folly.<br><br>>(5) For the Boomsliter and Creel example, I should have said harmonic<br>>_progressions_, for the choice of 224/128 over 7/4 was aopparently made in<br>>reference to position in a larger network of relationships, and not to a<br>>stretching preference (although Linus Liu recently sent me an example of a<br>>scale for Chinese music - which is primarily melodic - where a sequence of<br>>just melodic intervals leads to an octave stretched by 81/80).<br><br>Ah, well in that case I would agree. (You meant 225/128, since 224/128=7/4.) <br>Certainly one can follow a relatively long chain of 3/2 relationships, a <br>relatively short chain of 5/4 or 6/5 relationships, and perhaps only one 7/4 <br>relationship (or not even) in the roots of consecutive chords. This is very <br>different from the perception of simultaneities.<br><br> -Paul<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 5 Oct 1996 04:17 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07834; Sat, 5 Oct 1996 03:18:46 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07793<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id TAA28541; Fri, 4 Oct 1996 19:18:45 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 4 Oct 1996 19:18:45 -0700<br>Message-Id: <961005021451_71670.2576_HHB59-8@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
