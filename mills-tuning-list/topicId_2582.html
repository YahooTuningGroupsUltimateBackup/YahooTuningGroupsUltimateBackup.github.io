Yesterday you wrote:<br><br>>... the probability that two physical strings are tuned<br>>to a rational inteval is zero, as Cantor showed...<br><br>This is true only if the two strings vibrate independently.<br>When two strings are mounted on the same instrument, then<br>there may well be some kinds of interaction between them.<br>They may, for instance, become "entrained" to each other,<br>that is, locked into various "simple integer" modes of vibration.<br>Besides strings, there are other examples of entrainment, for<br>instance, the orbits of several moons are entrained to simple integer<br>ratios about their planets. On pianos, it is well known that adjacent<br>strings interact. Might they, under certain conditions, entrain?<br><br>Then, in talking about consonance and dissonance, you said:<br><br>>The only definition I care about is one with a psychoacoustic<br>>correlative.<br><br>The sensory consonance theory (including Helmholtz, Plomp and<br>Levelt, Terhardt, your own work, and my own work) is not the only<br>theory that has a "psychoacoustic correlate."<br><br>Consider for a moment the slightly different question of how the ear<br>determines pitch. There are two major theories, the "place" and the<br>"periodicity" theories of pitch perception. In the place theory, pitch is<br>determined by where on the basilar membrane the maximum<br>excitation occurs. This classic model, expounded by Von Bekesy in<br>the 30's was considered the final word for a long time, but careful<br>measurements of JND's (Just Noticeable Differences) for pitch showed<br>that the basilar membrane is not sensitive enough to account for all<br>thats known about the ear's resolution powers.<br><br>The ear can also resolve very small temporal differences (as used for<br>instance, to locate sounds in the environment). The periodicity<br>theorists suggest that the ear basically "counts up" how many<br>maxima (or minima or zero crossings, depending on who you read)<br>occur in a given time interval to determine pitch. There is currently<br>no experimental evidence that definitely points to one of these<br>theories over the other, and J Pierce has argued (convincingly, in my<br>opinion) that the most likely scenario is that both mechanisms are at<br>work.<br><br>Now let's return to the "simple integer ratio" theory of consonance.<br>One can easily turn the simple integer ratio version into a "length of<br>waveform" argument. The periodicity pitch theorists already have a<br>mechanism for determining length of period, so it would be easy to<br>believe that the this same mechanism could also be used by the<br>"dissonance determining algorithm" of the brain. The problem with<br>irrational ratios then becomes the problem of determining the pitch<br>of "almost periodic waveforms". This is then not a huge problem<br>since presumably the brain will interpret ambiguous interval ratios<br>in much the way as it interprets ambiguous pitches.<br><br>Thus the "simple integer ratio" theory of consonance has (roughly) as<br>firm a psychoacoustic foundation as the sensory consonance theory.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Fred Kohler" <Fred_Kohler@bc.sympatico.ca><br>Subject:  Starr Labs/Erv Wilson Keyboard<br>PostedDate:  28-10-97 16:55:11<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  28-10-97 16:54:18-28-10-97 16:54:19,28-10-97 15:54:53-28-10-97 15:54:53<br>DeliveredDate:  28-10-97 15:54:53<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125653E.00575A28; Tue, 28 Oct 1997 16:54:07 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29461; Tue, 28 Oct 1997 16:55:11 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 28 Oct 1997 16:55:11 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29767<br>Received: (qmail 4398 invoked from network); 28 Oct 1997 07:55:07 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 28 Oct 1997 07:55:07 -0800<br>Message-Id: <01bce3b9$51164480$4617c2cf@a1a05977><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
