Erlich&#x22; &#x3C;PErlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/1997 1:34:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I don't think Blackwood really said anything new here. The point is<br>that, at least for early works, the Western common practice idiom works<br>in any tuning where the syntonic comma vanishes. Only in such tunings is<br>it possible to construct a diatonic scale where all thirds are 5-limit<br>consonances. So JI and ETs 15, 22, 34, 41, 53 are all no-gos, but any<br>meantone tuning including ETs 12, 19, 31, 43, 50, and 55 is OK (with<br>some provision, perhaps, for exaggerated leading tones). The former<br>tunings require one to insert comma inflections into the score to avoid<br>wolves, with the typical result of a piece drifting several commas away<br>from its initial key, and in tunings where the syntonic (pseudo-)comma<br>is large, messing with the thematic integrity of the development of<br>essentially heptatonic ideas.<br><br>Of course, once enharmonic equivalents (i.e., vanishing diminished<br>seconds) enter the repertoire, some variant of 12-tET is necessary for a<br>truthful interpretation. I don't think we need a Blackwood or anyone<br>else to prove this to us!<br><br>To me, this is all the more reason for modern microtonalists to focus on<br>the "forbidden" tunings; the challenge is to find a perhaps<br>non-heptatonic framework, possibly using higher than 5-limit harmony,<br>for thematic development. Certainly Blackwood's own attempt at composing<br>in 22-tET makes the case against trying to adhere to traditional<br>harmonic/melodic practice in that tuning. I think Schonberg may have<br>been right that diatonicism had been played out, but in abandoning the<br>concepts of tonality and scale he threw the baby out with the bathwater.<br>Many of the octatonic experiments of the post-tonal composers are a nice<br>middle ground between controlled and emancipated dissonance and between<br>tonality, polytonality, and atonality. But what if these composers could<br>write in 15-tET, where similar symmetrical scales actually allow for<br>circle-of-fifths chords progressions as well as better 7-limit tetrads?<br>The 12-tone system forced the serious, innovative composers into an<br>increasingly academic corner as the vast majority of music lovers<br>gravitated toward recyclings of older ideas that their ears could still<br>digest. The 20th century was an amazing century for Western music<br>primarily due to the incorporation of non-Western influences. Perhaps<br>the 21st will see a breaking down of the 12-tone barrier and a flood of<br>new tonal ideas.<br><br>Today is my last day as a full-time employee of an investment company. I<br>already spend almost all my free time playing music, and virtually all<br>of that is 12-tone. My latest 4-track improvisation is some sort of<br>octatonic funk music; novel perhaps but not revolutionary by any<br>stretch. With more free time, I hope to kick myself into putting some<br>serious time into exploring microtonal realms. It's hard what with all<br>the great musicians around playing 12-tone; I'll have to say, "No sorry,<br>can't play with you today, gotta go home and play microtonal by myself."<br>Will I do it? I don't know. It's a pretty tough barrier to break in the<br>musical culture we're living in.<br><br>I'm off to NY and SF for two weeks, hopefully for some inspiration. In<br>the meantime, happy tuning!<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Carter Scholz <csz@well.com><br>Subject:  Re MIDI Tuning Spec<br>PostedDate:  01-10-97 05:53:32<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  01-10-97 05:53:06-01-10-97 05:53:06,01-10-97 05:52:02-01-10-97 05:52:03<br>DeliveredDate:  01-10-97 05:52:03<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256523.0015551C; Wed, 1 Oct 1997 05:53:00 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03274; Wed, 1 Oct 1997 05:53:32 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 1 Oct 1997 05:53:32 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03258<br>Received: (qmail 673 invoked from network); 30 Sep 1997 20:53:28 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 30 Sep 1997 20:53:28 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199710010351.UAA13587@well.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6200 href="#6200">ðŸ”—</a>alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)</h3><span>10/1/1997 9:12:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>It would be much nicer if we could<br>>compel every manufacturer to include 64 or 255 tuning tables, all accessible<br>>and switchable the same way.
