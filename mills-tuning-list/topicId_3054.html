This puts into question the positive rating of my IQ and<br>my ability to read plain English.  So I'm very sorry for the<br>redundant explanations  in the last digest.  And John, contrary to<br>what I said, wasn't remotely wrong.<br><br>John wrote:<br><br>>>>  My points are 1) for<br>> > >microtonal scales to be implemented in mass produced instruments it must be<br>> > >economically realistic for the manufacturers to do so, and 2) for microtonal<br>> > >scales to be used by non-specialists it must be as easy as possible for them<br>> > >to be changed.

I'm unconvinced<br>> however about the last sentence of this paragraph.<br><br>John's reasoning is:  to greatly extend the number of<br>'partials'/zones available would take up too much system memory,<br>causing the cost of the unit to increase too much.  That seems<br>suprising - but it may be true (?)<br><br>Except that, as I understand, the E4 does not have this architectural<br>feature (ie., more 'partials' do eat into sample RAM, they certainly<br>did on the EIII).   The drawbacks on the E4 are rather : cost, tuning<br>resolution, speed of setting up the zones/samples for ATS.<br><br>Apologies again for my inability to read..........<br><br>Patrick Ozzard-Low<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  DMB5561719 <DMB5561719@aol.com><br>Subject:  New reviews at Juxtaposition Ezine<br>PostedDate:  16-01-98 15:27:38<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  16-01-98 15:27:43-16-01-98 15:27:43,16-01-98 15:26:47-16-01-98 15:26:47<br>DeliveredDate:  16-01-98 15:26:47<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125658E.004F6EF6; Fri, 16 Jan 1998 15:27:37 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02598; Fri, 16 Jan 1998 15:27:38 +0100<br>Date: Fri, 16 Jan 1998 15:27:38 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA30020<br>Received: (qmail 28737 invoked from network); 16 Jan 1998 06:27:34 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 16 Jan 1998 06:27:34 -0800<br>Message-Id: <63079538.34bf6d75@aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=7298 href="#7298">ðŸ”—</a>Xou Oxno &#x3C;xouoxno@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/1998 7:28:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>New to Juxtapostion Ezine<br><br>http://www.virtulink.com/immp/jux/j_index.htm<br><br>Joe Monzo's reviews of <br><br>When Mozart Was A Nine Year Old<br>Presented by SoHo Baroque Opera Company, New York City<br>Monday, March 16, 1998 <br><br>and<br><br>Dean Drummond's score to <br>F.
