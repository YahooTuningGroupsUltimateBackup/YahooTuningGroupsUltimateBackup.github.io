I must admit, though, when the discussion gets too <br>technical about ratios of super-rational numbers etc, at times my eyes <br>glaze over -- which, of course, is not to say that these aren't important <br>discussions.  What I find myself struggling with, is that for someone <br>like myself, a technical discussion may have some intellectual meaning to <br>my brain, but what are my ears going to hear as the product of the <br>discussion?<br><br>Sooo, I've been thinking -- I'd really really like to have a library, a <br>web page or something where I could go and get a synopsis of a technical <br>idea, theory, argument and some actual sound, or MIDI files that would <br>demonstrate the idea so my intellect and ears can be "singing from the <br>same songsheet", if you know what I mean.<br><br>Then I got to thinking in a similar vein, it'd also be very nice to have <br>a library of music that could take one from traditional 12 tone equal <br>step tuning, to a variety of alternate tunings, but instead of making the <br>jump to *extreme* variation from TET, there would be a progression of <br>individual songs that would allow ones ears to get accustomed to the <br>final desired tunings in a series of steps.  It's very akin to the first <br>time I ever had a beer, I really didn't think it was all that great, but <br>after a while I did develop a taste for light beers, but wasn't all that <br>crazy about darker brews, but over the years, I generally wouldn't touch <br>a light beer anymore, because I have come to a point where I much prefer <br>the full bodied flavor of a dark brew.<br><br>So, list members, what I'm asking I suppose, is to have my ears slowly <br>seduced into enjoying alternate tunings the way my taste buds were <br>seduced into drinking a dark beer!<br><br>Positive steps are regularly posted in this direction, I will point out, <br>in annoucements of concerts, or reviews of CDs. It would also be nice to <br>know if the piece of music was going to sound totally bizarre and <br>unpalatable if you were expecting something close to TET.  I suppose some <br>sort of rating might be nice that would let you know based on someone <br>else's subjective sense how "out there" a piece is from TET.<br><br>I must admit I don't have the time, experience or resources necessary to<br>build either one of these libraries I spoke of, but I did want to make it<br>known from my point of view these kinds of libraries would be extremely<br>useful.<br><br>Jeff<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 7 Jun 1996 23:02 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id OAA20189; Fri, 7 Jun 1996 14:02:30 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 7 Jun 1996 14:02:30 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199606072059.AA27870@felix.dircon.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3033 href="#3033">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/1996 5:42:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Brian Lee said:<br>> From my own work with rational tunings, I find that I get most out of them<br>> either using long sustained tones or repeated patterns. This gives the<br>> quality of the interval time to really resonate for me inwardly. Whereas the<br>> short chippy sounds of much of Partch's music communicates well rhythmically<br>> but I don't get much else out of it other than at an intellectual level.<br><br>   I just have to put a big "amen!" on that one.  That was one of the biggest<br>confusion points to me in getting to understand Partch's music.  I also find it<br>strangely - or perhaps amusingly - ironic that he used some of the most<br>nonharmonic timbres to perform music based on harmonic relationships.  <br><br>   But I once posed that concern to Jonathan Glasier, who has been associated<br>with Partch and his legacy since his youth.  He responded that he understood<br>that concern, but cautioned me to realize that Partch's musical goals were not<br>wholly, or in his view, even primarily, about tuning alone.  He wanted to create<br>an entire alternative music tradition, including instrumentational, rhythmic,<br>literary, and yes intonational.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 9 Jun 1996 02:45 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id RAA24150; Sat, 8 Jun 1996 17:45:09 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 8 Jun 1996 17:45:09 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960609003845_71670.2576_HHB38-6@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
