Jorgenson  has introduced<br>the "Victorian Temperament " as a way to describe the slightly bent equal<br>temperament that  appears to have been in favor during the last of the 19th<br>century.  <br>      The variance this "Victorian Temperament, (VT) shows from true ET is so<br>small, that I have yet to have an audience notice. This is not the case when<br>you move farther back, and get into something that definitely shows a variety<br>of interval widths, ( Jorgenson's listed, "Equal Beating Kirnberger" for<br>example). <br>    Today's listeners, even the ones accustomed to listening to the classical<br>repertoire often are not sure if they can tell a temperament difference on<br>first hearing,  but with enough exposure, they  get to the point where<br>something sounds wrong when they hear Beethoven played on an  equally<br>tempered piano. <br><br>     I have noticed on this list that there is an attitude of  combat with<br>the established 12 ET world;  as though one must be an "enemy" of that tuning<br>system if one is to be a legit microtonalist.  Perhaps this is necessary, but<br>it may also be counterproductive to the goal of expanding the audience.  <br>     The more quickly us AT's ,(alternative tuneheads?),  can offer<br>attractive alternatives to modern 12ET,  the more quickly the more esoteric<br>and less familiar stuff will have a chance at being heard by widening<br>audiences. <br>      My point is,  If you are to dislodge a 12-ET type from clinging to the<br>familiar, so that he may someday enjoy the latest composition  for bloganhorn<br>and organic crystopleyel tuned in the  new 1n/Ip-xenwowie-no-limit<br>amorphous-jughead-micro-function-tuning that somebody finds in a computer<br>trance,  it just may be that listening to familiar music on unfamiliar tuning<br>is an easier first step than asking them to listen to something that is<br>strange in both composition and intonation.  <br>     To that end, there are a lot of us out in the field, tuning ET for a<br>living, but promoting nonET for the sake of art.  I know virtually nothing of<br>the microtonal world, ( having found myself totally absorbed by the 18th<br>century keyboard tuning differences), but what I have observed is, that once<br>somebody has a pleasurable experience of leaving 12 ET for something else,<br> they are more likely to have an open mind for alternative tunings in<br>general.  Then you can close up the Steinway and get out the<br>bloganhorn..................<br>Regards to all, <br>Ed Foote <br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn <br>(wondering if any of this microtonal guitar stuff will show up here in<br>"guitar town")<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 18 Nov 1996 04:56 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA15802; Mon, 18 Nov 1996 04:57:30 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA15578<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id TAA23169; Sun, 17 Nov 1996 19:57:27 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 17 Nov 1996 19:57:27 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.961117205336.58657B-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4047 href="#4047">ðŸ”—</a>bf250@freenet.carleton.ca (John Sankey)</h3><span>11/17/1996 8:54:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>There is one - Cubase Score outputs in Adobe Acrobat format<br>and there is a free viewer for that format.
