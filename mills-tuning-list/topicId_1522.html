It does that by taking the time derivative of each partials'<br>phase values.  You have to have to look at a very short sliver of time to<br>do that though.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 10 Jan 1997 16:03 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18551; Fri, 10 Jan 1997 16:06:46 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18547<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id HAA09182; Fri, 10 Jan 1997 07:06:41 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 10 Jan 1997 07:06:41 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701101000_MC2-E7C-6023@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
