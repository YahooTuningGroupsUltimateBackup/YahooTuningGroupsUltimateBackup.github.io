And, if you only had to read one thing<br>about my opinion on tuning them, Hstick says it best!<br><br>>I don't think our fixed pitch instruments are stuck in 12; our<br>>minds are...Hstick<br><br>Bingo!  If we had the conservatories filled with Xenharmonic keyboards and<br>theory classes, then we have ensembles using Xenharmonics in a very<br>effective way (as opposed to doing it by accident, as they do now).<br><br>>What a manufacturer considers 'correct' may vary very slightly.  But in<br>>general, it seems that much effort is put into actually 'centering' the<br>>resultant pitches which arise, by equalling out factors of breath pressure<br>in >tests etc . And the 'model' is certainly 12-ET.<br><br>I don't know as much about clarinets, but I've played the trumpet for many<br>years.  And trumpet players are notorious "equipment freaks", so I am always<br>up on the latest stuff.  But when it comes down to it, trumpets are just<br>three natural horns in a small package.  Thus, playing the harmonic series<br>is easy as can be -> When you hear an arpegio, you can bet it's Just.<br><br>I've got two top-of-the-line professional Bb horns, a Bach Stradivarius with<br>72 bell and a Yamaha ML heavy-wall.  And I've played many different<br>configurations of the above.  I can personally say, and it is well known,<br>that the intonational characteristics vary widely from horn to horn of the<br>same make and config, let alone different makes and configurations.<br><br>As far as what intonational 'model' the builders shoot for, they must be<br>torn between good harmonic characteristics and 12equal approximations.  The<br>Yamaha tends to pull towards the 12 equal in the high register, but is just<br>plain out of tune in any system in the low range.  The Bach tends to be more<br>harmonic throughout, and the tone is plainly warmer to the most novice listener.<br><br>But either horn will intone however my conservatory-trained friend wants it<br>to, once he's had a few minutes to get to know the pet peeves of it.<br><br>The bottom line is: I'm all for new instrument design of any kind.  But I<br>can only see biasing free pitched instruments to equal temperaments as the<br>exception (say, for keyboard concertos) rather than the rule.<br><br>And the real bottom line is just what Hstick says.<br><br>Carl<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
