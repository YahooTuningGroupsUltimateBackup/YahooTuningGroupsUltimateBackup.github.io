(12501 Mitchell Ave., Los Angeles, CA<br>90066); Back; Gregory T. (16000 Sunset Blvd., #1, Pacific Palisades, CA<br>90272). Appl. No.: 896,685Filed: Jun. 10, 1992<br><br>A fully adjustable acoustic guitar bridge is claimed that allows the<br>strings (nylon or steel) of an acoustic guitar to be separately and<br>continuously intonated accurately and easily whenever necessary. The<br>bridge system employs a minimum of alterations to the traditional<br>non-adjustable acoustic guitar bridge to retain the acoustic qualities<br>of the instrument. Recessed, rear-loaded cap screws utilize the forward<br>pull of the guitar strings to stabilize the adjustable saddles. A<br>threaded saddle capture on each saddle provides stability, continuous<br>threading capability, and the freedom to use acoustically resonant<br>materials (bone, phenolic, composites, etc.) for saddles. These features<br>eliminate the need for springs or other fasteners, which would have a<br>negative effect on the acoustic guitar's tone and sustain. A rosewood<br>shim is employed on acoustic/electric guitars over the internal bridge<br>pickup. The vibration of the saddles on the shim is transmitted to the<br>pickup regardless if the saddles are located directly over the pickup or<br>not. The system has been tested and is compatible with most bridge<br>pickup systems that are currently on the market. The Rule of 3.3%, which<br>cuts 3/64" off of a guitar neck fingerboard (for a neck with a scale<br>length of 25.5") compensates for the various string tensions along the<br>neck to allow for any guitar, with an adjustable bridge and properly<br>located frets, to achieve accurate intonation at all fret positions.<br><br>If you want to refret for real microtonal use see:<br><br>http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy/lsd/frets.html</div>
