When I was younger, I drooled over <br>Apple computers in glass cases, and had to content myself with a <br>homebuilt Elf, a Pip, and finally a Sinclair until I could afford a PC <br>running MSDOS. PCs are now dominant and Macs are finally releasing <br>machines at around $1000. One reason why so little software is written <br>for Mac these days- there is no economic incentive because the customer <br>base is so small. It is not insensitive to fail to mention the platform, <br>and it is really not that much work to do a net search. Besides, don't <br>modern Macs run PC software also? (I am ignorant on this point, but I <br>know several Mac users in my department run PC software on their Power <br>Macs.) <br><br><br>John Starrett<br>http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</div>
