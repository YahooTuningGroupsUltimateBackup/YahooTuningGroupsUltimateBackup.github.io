Exactly what you call this  <br>area of memory, what it is, how it works, etc, I'm no expert at (as <br>you'll just have gathered).  Presumably it's some kind of RAM <br>reserved for stuff nearer the operating system level.  I'm sure John <br>Loffink used a term to describe it once, but I haven't time to search <br>for it right now.
