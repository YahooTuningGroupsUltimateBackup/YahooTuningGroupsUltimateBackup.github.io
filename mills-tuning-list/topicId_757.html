Just back from Camp Rising Sun and thought it's time to get <br>back to internet communication.  Saw yet another response by Harry <br>Partch witness Jon Szanto and felt there is still too much <br>misunderstanding to drop the potato...just yet.  <br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@ios.com<br><br>On Wed, 7 Aug 1996, Jonathan M. Szanto wrote:<br><br>> Friends,<br>> <br>> It took a few days, but I finally managed to apply my Algorithmic Rebuttal<br>> Module to the input source material (Mr. R.'s last 8-point railing against<br>> "the truth"), and here are the results.

Here we go...<br>> <br>> ***************<br>> <br>> >The truth is Harry Partch promoted corporeality and his heir Danlee <br>> >Mitchell performed *Revelation in the Courthouse Park* in Lincoln Center <br>> >in total concert form, thereby giving the opposite impression of his mentor.<br>> <br>> This has been covered before.  Yes, "Revelation"-NY was a concert<br>> production; as such, dismissible on that basis.  In the last twenty years of<br>> productions I can remember only two others that would fall outside of the<br>> corpus of corporeality, out of many, many performances.  You win -- and it's<br>> a pretty *tiny* victory.  It would have been interesting to hear Johnny's<br>> comments on this Lincoln Center concert, but he has stated that he did not<br>> attend it.<br><br><br>While Jon agrees with my point, he obfuscates it.  Though in Navaholand <br>during the non-corporeal Lincoln Center Revelation, I heard the earlier <br>*premiere* in Philadelphia: there the Partch instruments were practically <br>hidden from view behind the acting, were each amplified to distortion <br>(mentioned as a problem by the largely positive John Rockwell NYTimes <br>review), and followed-up by a NY premiere with stick figure singers.  <br>Perhaps there were no other such *non-corporeal* performance of Partch <br>because Danlee Mitchell stopped directing Partch productions soon after.<br><br><br>> >The truth is that Partch decried recordings for their abstract nature, <br>> >while creating the Gate 5 label for his music, an early an successful Indie.'<br>> <br>> What on Earth is the point here?  Damned if you do and damned if you don't?<br>> Harry didn't exactly "decry" records; he said that "records have been a<br>> rather sad compromise." (Preface to 2nd Edition, "Genesis Of A Music")  And<br>> they were, seeing as they completely omitted the physical aspects of a<br>> performance.  If one takes a historical perspective on Partch's reasons for<br>> recording, including the fact that some of the early Gate 5 recordings were<br>> sold on a *subscription* basis, to underwrite productions of the works, one<br>> can see that recordings for Harry were a 'means to an end', not a shortcut<br>> or a quick buck.  And, though he continued to sell the Gate 5 recordings for<br>> many years, it would be a stretch of monumental proportions to label <g> him<br>> a "successful Indie".<br> <br>That's exactly how I feel by your posts, "Damned if I do and damned if I <br>don't."  To my knowledge there is no performance of Partch in the U.S. <br>other than Newband, solo guitarist Jon Schneider, former Partch ensembler <br>Francis Thumm, and the AFMM.  The effort and financial support to present <br>Partch in concert is formidable.  Audiences and critics have responded <br>enthusiastically.  So why is the impression being made repeatedly that <br>these concerts - still unheard by Mr. Szanto - are counterfiets?  <br><br>The point about the Indie is that idealism is all fine and good, but <br>Partch realized practicality simultaneously.  That is exactly what I do: <br>Partch works that require the least amount of specialized percussion, <br>that have rarely if ever been performed, that have never been recorded or <br>recorded poorly.  And yes, Gate 5 was successful, if not measured solely <br>by money, IMHO.<br><br>The only instrument that the AFMM replaces is chromolodeon with a <br>Proteous synthesizer attached to an 88-key manual.  Henry Lowengard is <br>devoted to capturing its sound and regularly updates the patch(es).  To <br>stop performances because of this, already agreed to by Mr. Mitchell as <br>logical, is self-serving.<br><br><br>> >The truth is that every performance of Partch since 1974 has been a <br>> >variation.  The instruments, some held with rubber bands, have been <br>> >updated, replaced, and even improved.  Still, Harry's voice is not <br>> >recreateable and every performance demonstrates a difference.<br>> <br>> Wait a minute.  <br>> <br>> Point One: Yes, no two performances are alike.  Does it follow then that the<br>> differences between two evenings' performances of "Castor and Pollux" by the<br>> Partch Ensemble are the equivalent to the differences between one of those<br>> performances and one by the Garfield Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps?<br><br>Are you saying that we are Garfield Cadets?  E-mail is easily <br>misconstrued.  Re: voice, Danlee wrote me of the Li Po we had both <br>intoned in performance in NYC that neither of us had Harry Partch's voice <br>(while admiring my expression and sentiment). :)<br><br> <br>> Point Two: Ah, the rubber band analogy.  Johnny seems to take perverse<br>> delight in one of Harry's less 'high-tech' construction methods; too bad --<br>> it's fun changing those rubber bands.  Keeps ones' ego in check.  Reminds<br>> you of the temporal nature of our life on the planet, or something.  But<br>> seriously, from 1974 to 1987 there was no 'updating, replacing or improving'<br>> done to the instruments, with one exception: a new Boo was constructed, but<br>> it was done as a completion of a project that Harry himself had started (he<br>> had experimented with the phenolic resin tubes himself, and was eager to<br>> build a more durable instrument.  I was glad for it, having had to<br>> personally supervise a massive repair job on Boo I in the late 70's.  Bamboo<br>> cracks...).  So this was the only change to the ensemble; the rest was<br>> maintenance.<br> <br>Jon seems to take perverse delight in defending rubber bands, clearly <br>keeping his ego in check.  <br><br>> >The truth is that Newband issued a CD with transcriptions, even as Mr. <br>> >Mitchell was railing against all such transcriptions, this one in <br>> >particular, while insuring Mr. Drummond complete and absolute control.  <br>> >If only _Partch Instruments_ are used, and all competition is <br>> >marginalized, then monopoly is achieved.  <br>> <br>> Oh, Lord, I already touched on this, but Johnny seems to be quite put out<br>> about it.  This is a true flaw in our Grand Master Plan of Control (watch<br>> out for those black choppers...).  This transcription is a blight on what<br>> would hopefully be a spotless record, and I hope that it is never repeated<br>> again.  [I actually addressed this in a _serious_ manner in my previous posts.]<br><br>You may want to keep touching on this, because it is more than merely <br>hipocritical.  Remember also that even paranoids have enemies.  To me the <br>transcription is no blight: it is beautifully played by Stefani Starin <br>and Dean Drummond for flute and zoomoozophone.  It is only the behind <br>the scenes double standards that I find objectionable.<br><br><br>> But I guess I now know why this bothers Johnny so much.  It is the use of<br>> the word *competition*.  I never looked at music as a competition, and I<br>> still don't.  There is so much available, so much new music to be created.<br>> The only possible reason it could be a competition is if it is 'my product<br>> vs. your'.  What an utterly repugnant thought...<br><br>Whether or not Jon looks at music as competition, or politics, or <br>philosophy, or entertainmnet, etc. matters little in the big picture.  I <br>create new music all the time and never take auditions.  (Actually went <br>to John Dewey High School, an experimental non-competitive school in <br>Brooklyn.)  The use of competition does bother me.<br><br>> >The truth is that their is a morbid qualtiy to Mr. Partch and what might <br>> >now be called his Bi-Polar personality.  The instruments were treated as <br>> >having mortality like humans.  The cloud chamber bowls have no calculable <br>> >way to be replaced, and the rubber bands examples of holding the <br>> >corporeal body of the instrument together.<br>> <br>> I am going to hang on to this paragraph, and I am going to ask Johnny to<br>> clarify his point.  I don't want to misconstrue his idea; I think I know<br>> what he is getting at, but don't want to jump to conclusions.  It is<br>> possible that he is addressing an issue many of us have grappled with since<br>> Partch's death; I'll email him when he is back from teaching...<br><br>Am I to be ambushed at the path?  Please, Jon, tell us what you have been <br>grappling with?<br><br>> lot of people, and I'm no scholar.  I've tried to understand what Harry<br>> Partch is really about, though.<br><br>Hmmm.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 17 Aug 1996 15:36 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10790; Sat, 17 Aug 1996 16:18:44 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10822<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA06728; Sat, 17 Aug 1996 07:18:42 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 17 Aug 1996 07:18:42 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960817070426.14536D-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
