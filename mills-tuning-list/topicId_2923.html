These collections were done from the turn of the<br>>century to the 40's.<br><br>While Densmore's collection is extensive and important, reflecting a<br>lifetime of work, she was well known for what we would now consider poor<br>fieldwork technique. She was procrustean in method, reputedly arbitrary in<br>not recording singers she considered "inauthentic" or "out of tune."  And<br>so on.<br><br>There are many other smaller but excellent collections out there--both from<br>the early days of cylinders and shortly thereafter, that, when taken<br>together, provide valuable perspective on Densmore's work.<br><br>Some examples:<br><br>Ida Halpern's work in British Columbia during the 40's is particularly<br>valuable and superb fieldwork; her albums, with =extensive= notes, remain<br>available on Folkways/Smithsonian. Halpern, trained by leading European<br>ethnomusicologists was a sensititive fieldworker, who almost<br>single-handedly preserved a remarkable tradition that was at the time<br>outlawed by the Canadian government, so her recordings had to be made in<br>secret. She included on the recordings many interview segments, and was<br>particularly aware of the tonal shifts (there's a microtonal rise between<br>verses in much NW Coast Indian music), polyphony, and non-mensural<br>rhythms--fortunately she wrote about these elements not only in the record<br>notes but in some major articles. In the late 1970's, at her request, my<br>graduate students and I (at the U. of Washington) carried out some lab<br>analyses of scale and rhythm, which appear in the notes to some of her last<br>albums, and in late articles.<br><br>Earlier, Alice Fletcher made a remarkable series of cylinders in the<br>Midwest, and with her adopted Indian son wrote monographs on the material.<br>(See Joan Marks's excellent biography of Fletcher, =A Stranger in Her<br>Native Land=.)<br><br>Willard Rhodes recorded a systematic survey somewhat later, commissioned<br>and published by the Library of Congress, of all major Native American<br>traditions.<br><br>The Federal Cylinder Project of the Library of Congress is a superb<br>discography of all known cylinder recordings held in any Federal facility<br>(they're scattered rather widely--from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the<br>LOC to the Smithsonian, and even further afield).<br><br>These and other early collections by Laura Boulton, Walter Fewkes, George<br>Herzog, Helen Roberts and many more await modern analysis. All are<br>accessible at the LOC, Indiana U., the Bishop Museum (Honolulu), and UCLA,<br>the main repositories of the original collections or tape copies thereof.</div>
