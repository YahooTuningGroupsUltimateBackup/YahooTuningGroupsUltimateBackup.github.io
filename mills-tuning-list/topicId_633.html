I must admit that I've never <br>felt comfortable with the notion that art should resemble nature in <br>its mode of operation, as extreme randomness is not really nature's way. <br>I have also resented his dismissal of microtonality as "just another wing <br>on the academy,"  but his work always has seemed to sound (and look) much <br>better than one would expect from the verbal description of its <br>structural and philosophical basis. Much of it is very good music <br>irrespective of its composer's aesthetic principles.<br><br>Furthermore, Cage has in fact composed with microtones in such works <br>as Ryoanji (in 1/4-tones, performed out of doors at the dedication of <br>the sculpture garden of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and joined by <br>an exhibit of his engravings) and HPSCHD, a computer collaboration with <br>Lejaren Hiller, which used various ET's up to 51 or 53-tet. Johnny<br>Reinhard has programed Cage's "Sonatas and Preludes for Prepared Piano"<br>on his AFMM concert series as a microtonal work and Dean Drummond has<br>performed a transcription  of "Haika," with Cage's permission, on <br>the justly-tuned aluminum tube metallophone, the Zoomoozophone.<br><br>Cage also inspired James Tenney to write an important theoretical essay<br>"John Cage and the Theory of Harmony." (I'm ad-libbing this AM, so I<br>may not have the titles word-perfect.)<br><br>--John<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 20 Jul 1996 21:58 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA25061; Sat, 20 Jul 1996 12:58:00 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 20 Jul 1996 12:58:00 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9607201519.A17843-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
