The info here is great, but I need citeable references. Any and all books, journals, articles, and URLs would be mightily appreciated.Thanks very much for the clear info presented here.<br>Momilani Ramstrum</div><h3><a id=7357 href="#7357">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Ed &#x26; Alita Morrison&#x22; &#x3C;essaim@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/3/1998 11:24:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>John Loffink and others who know about samples of microtonal music in<br>movies have talked about the subject frequently in the Tuning Digests.  I<br>have interest in "2001" and "Star Trek II, The Wrath of Khan" - soundtrack.<br> Can someone tell me how to find the exact spots where the microtonal music<br>is located.  Perhaps you could describe the scenes so that I could see the<br>scenes and hear the music with it?  I would think that others reading these<br>Tuning Digests would be interested also.
