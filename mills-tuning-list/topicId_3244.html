Wuzzat?<br>---------------<br><br>   Before I go into more detail about the sorts of exercises that make<br>sense on such a CD, I need to explain a bit more about 88CET tuning itself.<br>Some of the exercises won't make a lot of sense without this background<br>information.  Indeed, some of the exercises on these 88CET CDs aren't<br>likely to make much sense on, for example, a 34TET ear-training CD.<br><br>   I did a series of tuning-list postings on 88CET tuning about 3 years ago<br>or so.  Even though it's been that long, I'll paraphrase the qualities of<br>88CET tuning a lot here, since that's not the main thrust of this series.<br>I am working on some really killer web pages about 88CET tuning, but<br>they're only about 1/3 done now.  So in the meantime (not to be confused<br>with "meantone"!), if you'd like to learn more, I can send any of you who<br>might be interested in more details about 88CET, the text of those postings<br>(assuming that I can find them all!).<br><br>   Most basically, "88CET" stands for "88-Cent [per step] Equal<br>Temperament".  It's an equal-temperament whose primitive step size is 88<br>cents.  The 1200 cents in an octave's span clearly don't divide evenly by<br>88, so 88CET is a nonoctave tuning.  No two notes on an 88CET instrument<br>are exactly an octave apart, nor exactly two octaves apart.<br><br>   But the fact that it does not approximate octaves is not, in itself,<br>quite as critically important as several other attributes.  For the<br>purposes of this series, here's what's most important about 88CET tuning:<br>1.  88CET has no traditional major or minor thirds.  Instead it<br>    has three nontraditional thirds:  subminor (7:6), neutral (11:9),<br>    and supramajor (9:7).<br>2.  It has no approximation to a traditional major or minor scale.<br>3.  Since it has no octave, 88CET has no octave-compound intervals.<br>    That means that, rather than getting "octave-equivalent" intervals<br>    in each octave's span, you instead get an different set of<br>    harmonic resources.<br>4.  88CET has a pretty good approximation to a 4:6:7:9:10:11:15<br>    harmonic-series fragment chord, or (obviously) any fragment of<br>    that chord.<br>5.  Since it's an equal temperament, it can also play that same<br>    structure inverted, meaning a that same subharmonic-series<br>    fragment.<br>6.  Also because it's an equal-temperament, you can build other<br>    chords as stacks of any one of those intervals, such as a neutral<br>    triad, which is a stack of two 11:9 neutral thirds.  That in the<br>    same sense that a major triad is a minor third atop a major third.<br>7.  Since 88CET has no approximation to the octave, it has two<br>    intervals that come close to an octave.  They are far enough to<br>    sound "out of tune", and close enough not to sound like anything<br>    in their own right.  They are, in short, "off octaves" and I find<br>    that they pretty much have to be avoided in most forms of harmony<br>    (for approximately-harmonic timbres that is).<br>8.  In addition to "off-octaves", 88CET also has a similarly dreadful-<br>    sounding off twelfth (3:1 ratio), and off double-octave (4:1).<br>    Other harmonic frequencies (5:1, 6:1, 7:1, etc.) seem to be either<br>    sufficiently well-represented, or are harmonically remote enough<br>    to be tolerable.<br>Again I'm brutally paraphrasing here, so I'm not coming even close to doing<br>justice to the importance of any of these qualities of 88CET tuning.<br><br>   Here is a table of frequency-ratio approximations in 88CET music:<br><br>             ------------------------------------------<br>                     Number<br>                    of 88CET<br>             Ratio   Steps    Interval Name<br>             ------------------------------------------<br>              1:1      0      Perfect Unison<br>             10:9      2      "Minor" Wholetone<br>              7:6      3      (Septimal) Subminor Third<br>             11:9      4      Neutral Third<br>              9:7      5      Supramajor Third<br>             10:7      7      (Large Septimal) Tritone<br>              3:2      8      Perfect Fifth<br>              5:3     10      Major Sixth<br>              7:4     11      Subminor Seventh<br>             15:7     15      Neutral Ninth<br>              9:4     16      Major Ninth<br>              5:2     18      Major Tenth<br>             ------------------------------------------</div><h3><a id=7307 href="#7307">ðŸ”—</a>alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)</h3><span>3/27/1998 3:29:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Paul,<br><br>I don't have any comments about these tunings, but I do have a question<br>about this:<br><br>>>In MT, the two German augmented sixth chords (usually Bb D F G# and Eb G Bb<br>>>C#) have a particularly concordant quality, resembling the seventh chords<br>>>sometimes encountered in barbershop singing. The two incomplete French<br>>>augmented sixth chords (Bb E G# and Eb A C#) also have a unique resonance.<br>>>Huygens, in advocating meantone tempermant, pointed out (back in the 17th<br>>>century, I believe) that these latter chords are used in compositions and in<br>>>meantone are tuned very nearly 1/7:1/5:1/4. This may have been the first<br>>>attempt to use the number 7 in explaining musical practice.<br><br>I haven't read Huygens (apart from what Barbour says about him), but this<br>seems a curious justification. Given that the minor seventh of the dominant<br>seventh chord resolves inward and the augmented sixth of the German<br>augmented sixth chord resolves outward, wouldn't one expect that, ideally,<br>the augmented sixth to be a larger interval than the minor seventh? (If,<br>indeed, one considers the seventh harmonic to be in need of resolution at<br>all.)<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
