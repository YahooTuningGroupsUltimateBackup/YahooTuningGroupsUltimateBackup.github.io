I was referring (about static music) to the cornucopia of <br>harmonic-series works of his like "In a Large Open Space", "Spectral <br>Canon", "Saxony", etc.<br>-----<br>from Johnny Reinhard:<br>> If you define JI in 12 tones per octave and they are based on the the <br>> better resultion of 12 ET than you should not be surprised if a listener <br>> hears very little difference.<br><br>"Big Gulp"'s tuning is 11-limit: 1/1, 33/16, 9/8, 28/12, 5/4, 21/16, <br>11/8, 3/2, 99/64, 27/16, 7/4, 15/8.  It should be a good scale for piano <br>music which sounds convincing yet distinctly xenharmonic.<br><br>> Surely a restriction of only 12 keys is still a restriction and this can <br>> be overcome by writing for another instrument (or more) playing with the <br>> restricted keyboard.  The additional instruments can play additional <br>> microtones.  Wyschnegradsky's *Meditation* has the cello (or in my case <br>> bassoon) playing quartertones and sixthtones against a conventionally <br>> tuned piano extremely effectively.<br><br>Of course it is nice to write for an ensemble, but when it comes to <br>analyzing a tuning purely, a solo keyboard may be ideal. Adding <br>instruments, especially ones without fixed-pitch,  would muddy up the sound <br>and act as a "cover" for hearing the true relationships.  I also find <br>that the more action is involved (varied instruments, harmonic motion, <br>etc.), the less xenharmonic a piece sounds.  This is taken from comments <br>of non-JI musicians who I have listen to it.<br><br>A couple of questions:<br>-Who is "Twinings"?  I haven't heard his music.<br>-Is the consensus that harmonic "pull" towards another tonality is the <br>same in a just-equivalent of 12TET?  Could the dominant triad not be more <br>effective in 12TET because the triadic third is more dissonant (the <br>sharper quality may lead the ear more strongly to the tonic).<br><br>Thanks for the discussion and keep it coming.<br>Adam B.

If<br>you don't play both sides of the string, you have a definite nut and bridge, the<br>sound you're considering vibrating between the bridge and the slide (that would<br>define the bridge).  <br><br>   As you perhaps know, the frequency of a vibrating string is inversely<br>proportional to its length.  So if you place the slide half-way up the string,<br>you will have a string half the length, and thus twice the frequency of the<br>pitch of the open string (i.e., no slide on the string at all).  If you were to<br>place the slide 1/3 of the entire string's length from the bridge, the vibrating<br>length of the string would be 1/3, so the frequency would be 3 times that of the<br>string if you remove the slide from the string completely.  Similarly for 1/4 of<br>the open string length, and so forth.  <br><br>   But what if you DO sound the other side as well.  Let's place the slide in<br>those same places and see what happens to the other part of the string.  Well,<br>if you place the slide in the middle, you have 1/2 on one side, and 1/2 on the<br>other, so the pitches are the same, as you correctly pointed out.  If you place<br>the slide 1/3 of the way to one side as before, one part of the string will be<br>at 3-times the open-string frequency.  What about the other side?  Well, it has<br>2/3 of the open-string length, so it will sound at 3/2 of the open-string<br>frequency.  <br><br>   So, if you place the slide 1/3 of the open string length from one end, you<br>will have pitches at 3 times and 3/2 times the frequency of the string if the<br>slide were removed completely.  Clearly, 3 is two times 3/2, so the two<br>frequencies are octaves apart.  <br><br>   Similarly, if you place the slide at 1/4 of the open string length from one<br>end, you will have string lengths of 1/4 and 3/4.  Those will then sound at<br>frequencies of 4 and 4/3 times the frequency of the open string.  Clearly 4 is 3<br>times 4/3, so the two frequencies will be a factor of three apart.  <br><br>   But you asked what are the relationships between all of these frequencies?<br>Well, let's look at those three cases:<br><br>In terms of lengths:       In terms of frequency:     In terms of Pitch:<br><br>           1/1                        1/1                        P1<br>|-----------------------|  |-----------------------|  |-----------------------|<br><br>     1/2         1/2            2/1         2/1             P8         P8<br>|-----------0-----------|  |-----------0-----------|  |-----------0-----------|<br><br>   1/3        2/3              3/1         3/2           P12          P5<br>|-------0---------------|  |-------0---------------|  |-------0---------------|<br><br>  1/4         3/4            4/1         4/3          dbl 8va       P4<br>|-----0-----------------|  |-----0-----------------|  |-----0-----------------|<br>                                                      (Note:  P1 = perfect uni.<br>                                                              P8 = perf. octave<br>                                                              P12 = perf. 12th<br>                                                              P5 = perf. fifth<br>                                                              (etc.)   )<br><br>   The frequencies of the shorter parts of the strings are harmonics (1 times, 2<br>times, 3 times, and 4 times) of the frequency of the open string.  The others<br>are somewhat more complexly related to the each other and to the open string.<br>If I recall correctly, they are called "superparticulars".  <br><br>   But here's what's neat about the frequencies sounded by the larger parts of<br>the string when you make the play harmonics on the smaller parts:  The are as<br>far above the common open-string root pitch as the current harmonic is above the<br>previous harmonic.  <br><br>   So first time around, on the shorter half (left) of the string, we went from<br>1/1 times whatever the frequency of the open string may be, to 2/1 times that<br>frequency, a jump of an octave, which is as far above the open-string root pitch<br>as the harmonic side jumped up.  The next time around, the pitch of the harmonic<br>side jumped from an octave above the root pitch to a twelfth above the root<br>pitch, an increase of a perfect fifth, and by golly, the longer end is a perfect<br>fifth above that common root pitch.  Similarly, the third time, the pitch of the<br>harmonic side went from a twelfth above the root pitch to a double-octave above<br>that root pitch, a pitch change of a fourth.  And by golly, the pitch of the<br>longer side is a perfect forth above the root pitch.  <br><br>   This relationship occurs only if you stick with the "sweet spots" - the<br>shorter side sticking with 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, and so forth of the open string<br>length.  <br><br>   As for the other topic - other fingering patterns to pick out on your<br>jumbush's fretless fingerboard - you might want to try subharmonic pitch<br>relationships.  You can get them by placing imaginary frets at exactly equal<br>distances apart all the way up the neck.  That rather than the usual<br>ever-decreasing distance as you move your way up the neck toward the bridge.<br>These subharmonic frequencies are 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, and so forth of a<br>very high fret position.  <br><br>   But there's a very important constraint here:  You must split the open string<br>length into a whole-number of equal-sized pieces!  As I vaguely recall from Ivor<br>Darreg's jumbush, the open string length is about 13 inches long.  You can<br>therefore split that up into 13 uniform 1-inch long imaginary fret positions.<br>But if your open string length is 13 and a half inches long, DON'T use a 1-inch<br>sized imaginary fret spacing!, leaving a 1/2-inch piece at the end (especially<br>not at the bridge end!).  Lengthen this uniform distance between your imaginary<br>frets slightly so that you've segmented that 13.5-inch distance into an even 13<br>pieces, or shorten it slightly into an even 14 pieces.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 10 Nov 1995 18:52 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA06750; Fri, 10 Nov 1995 08:52:32 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 10 Nov 1995 08:52:32 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.951110114011.141378A-100000@freenet2.freenet.ufl.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
