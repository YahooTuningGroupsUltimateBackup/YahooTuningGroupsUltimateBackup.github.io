For that matter, we may <br>>be hardwired for mathematical understanding of all that we can understand <br>>mathematically, and that may spill over into musical understanding, even <br>>of tempered and non-octave scales. <br>>	In short, I don't think we are in any position to say what is <br>>natural to our musical understanding and what is not. Further <br>>psychoacoustic research may shed some light on what musical <br>>structures are more primal, but I haven't seen anything convincing <br>>yet. I'll bet Brian Mclaren has an opinion on this.<br><br>A good book I read a couple of years ago that I think might provide a<br>good foundation for further psychoacoustic research is "Consciousness<br>Explained" by philosopher Daniel Dennett.  Although Dennett doesn't<br>specifically deal with psychoacoustics in this book, he does set up a<br>substantial framework for discussing perception and consciousness.<br>Dennett doesn't take a typical behaviorist approach, but grants<br>credence to subjective experience as important to how things feel to<br>people (what he calls heterophenomenology), but not necessarily as a<br>description of reality.  He outlines a theory of "multiple drafts" of<br>consciousness where the perception of discrete events is no longer<br>sequentially ordered.  Perceptions of an event can even change<br>radically over small periods of time as the brain fills in what it<br>considers missing information or rationalizes the perception to make<br>it fit within preconceived notions of what should be perceived.<br>Dennett backs up his theories with findings from recent research in<br>neuroscience, although his examples focus mostly on visual perception.<br>Fascinating reading.<br><br>So, my feelings on the psychoacoustics . . .<br><br>I believe that it's going to be very difficult to isolate the<br>so-called "primal" musical perceptions or structures, since so much of<br>what we hear is heavily influenced by our indoctrination and<br>education.  I don't doubt that some primal structures exist, or even<br>that they might possibly be hardwired in some way, just that they pale<br>in significance when compared with the effects of experience.  (It<br>seems to me that recent research gives more examples of why the brain<br>isn't hardwired than why it is.)<br><br>Example: Even at this fairly late point in my life (after age 40),<br>after working on advanced 72tET ear training exercises, I can hear the<br>difference between two intervals that differ by one 72tET step much<br>more clearly than I could a year ago.  I now hear adjacent microtonal<br>steps as being much wider than I did previously.  There's no doubt to<br>me that this has affected my overall perception of music in some way,<br>especially when I now hear 100 cent steps of 12tET as much larger than<br>I used to.  Some musically untrained people I have worked with have<br>enough trouble even with steps of that size, while I know other people<br>who can hear an isolated pitch, give you the note name and then tell<br>you approximately how many cents off from 12tET it is.<br><br>I think that in this sense, perception of music is much closer to<br>perception of language.  Some people have larger vocabularies than<br>others due to their education.  People in specialized fields also have<br>specialized vocabularies which help them make sense and allows them to<br>communicate their ideas to others in the same field.  I think that<br>something similar happens with music.<br><br>Randy<br>************************************************************************<br>* Randy Winchester * randy@mit.edu * PO Box 1074, Cambridge, MA  02142 *<br>*       (617) 253-7431       *       http://web.mit.edu/randy/www      *<br>************************************************************************<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 11 Feb 1997 20:51 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02749; Tue, 11 Feb 1997 20:51:54 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02747<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id LAA14305; Tue, 11 Feb 1997 11:49:32 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 11 Feb 1997 11:49:32 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.970211190120.23927C-100000@kali><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
