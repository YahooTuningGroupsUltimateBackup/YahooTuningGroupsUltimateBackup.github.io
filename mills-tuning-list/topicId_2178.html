Does such a recording<br>exist? 2) More generally, do recorded demonstrations of the differences between<br>various systems of tuning exist? I am particularly interested in the<br>efforts composers made in increasing the range of modulation in their<br>compositions in the era when the Just system was pre-eminent.<br><br>2) As I understand it, the first clearly stated modern suggestion for ET<br>came from the Belgian scientist Simon Stevin in the early 17th century<br>but was not put into general practice for well over 100 years for a<br>number of reasons. Aside from aesthetic preferences, people did not know<br>how to calculate the twelfth root of 2 (Stevin did, but made a few<br>calculational errors). Furthermore, the understanding of overtones and<br>beats came only in the mid 17th century and some time would have been<br>necessary for tuners to learn how to tune by beats. Any information<br>about the transition to Equal temperament would be of interest to me.<br><br>Ed Remler<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 30 Jun 1997 18:21 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17379; Mon, 30 Jun 1997 18:22:09 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 30 Jun 1997 18:22:09 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA17323<br>Received: (qmail 16504 invoked from network); 30 Jun 1997 16:21:49 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 30 Jun 1997 16:21:49 -0000<br>Message-Id: <c%apï¿½adian-Asset%lRS-970630155553Z-697@mars.acadian-asset.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
