Otherwise, it doesn't want to resolve.<br><br>Paule, please pardon me,but WHY is the dominant 7th a dissonance? To me <br>a tuned 7th is very consonant.<br><br> In jazz in the mixolydian mode, the dominant seventh chord is the tonic <br>chord, and tuning it more purely can only add to its tonicity. It can, <br>however, make the chord sound out of tune with respect to the scale. <br><br>Do you mean with respect to the tempered scale?<br><br>I'm an "ear" singer-listener-whatever. Are you referring to a 7th whose <br>tones are in frequency ratios of 4x:5x:6x:7x where x=some fundamental <br>frequency?
