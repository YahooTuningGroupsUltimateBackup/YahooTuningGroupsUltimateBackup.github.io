I've sometimes wondered how 18th-century European<br>philosophers, so disturbed over the question of variation of taste, would<br>respond to the startling differences in interpretation of music between<br>cultures.<br><br>Wayne Vitale brought up a good example of this subjectivity: the Balinese<br>gamelan angklung. This 4-tone per octave ensemble plays some of the most<br>bright, lively, wonderfully happy melodies on the island, and yet it is<br>associated with death rites and cremations. The Balinese explained to Wayne<br>that they find the melodies melancholy, not bright or happy at all.<br><br>On the other hand, if anyone wants to make a fast buck, there are Chinese<br>modes and tones that, in their metaphysical music theory, are supposed to<br>promote weight loss. I think a CD of this music, promoted in the right way,<br>would be a big seller.<br><br>(Please note that I'm not trying to be flip about the belief systems of the<br>Chinese, just Western tabloid exploitation and shallowness.)<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.

I recall the late  <br>> Ivor Darreg once getting a phone call from an acquaintance who announced  <br>> that he had just discovered the ultimate laxative theme. Prudence or  <br>> good taste, alas, prevented Darreg from recording it, so it's been lost  <br>> to posterity.<br>> <br>> Basically, I think music should be a treat rather than a treatment. I'm <br>> willing to listen to good music on its own merits regardless of its <br>> underlying metaphysics.<br>> <br><br>John, I feel the effects of music, though sometimes extremely apparent,<br>more often are on the level of tobacco smoke or asbestos--occasional<br>exposure having seemingly little effect, some not being effected at all,<br>while long term exposure seems to eventually have drastic consequences.<br><br>I hope that interested individuals won't be kept from reading David Tame's<br>book based on several of the posted reviews.  I believe his main thesis is<br>that music has a great influence on the civilization and culture which<br>creates it.  He analyzes Chinese, Western, and Indian music traditions,<br>and to some extent pre Greek and Greek music.  There is much material<br>which is thought provoking, though his conclusions are rather sweeping and<br>general.  I believe it is unfair to interpret his thoughts as<br>racially biased, although he is hard on most "modern" Western music,<br>including jazz and R&R.  Should one dismiss Indian ragas<br>because they believe Indian culture at one time condones(d) the caste<br>system and abuse of women?<br><br>Bruce Kanzelmeyer<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 3 Apr 1997 08:41 METZ<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01845; Thu, 3 Apr 1997 08:42:16 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01843<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id WAA21452; Wed, 2 Apr 1997 22:40:49 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 2 Apr 1997 22:40:49 -0800<br>Message-Id: <334363F5.651A@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
