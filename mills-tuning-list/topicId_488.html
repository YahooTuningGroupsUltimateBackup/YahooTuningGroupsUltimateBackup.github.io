But it never sounds that way to<br>> these old ears.<br><br>   Brian said that Bill Alves' comment that spurred this comment was insightful,<br>but to me both comments are very insightful.  <br><br>   Perhaps it's all because of my composition-oriented perspective, but I would<br>never in a million years thought to view QC meantone as a combination of a<br>tempered tuning and a just tuning, on the grounds that it has a just major third<br>and a tempered fifth.  <br><br>   Especially since I'd be dead most of those million years!<br><br>   From my composition-oriented perspective, I have long been boggled, if not<br>all-out scared, by what it would mean to compose in several tunings at the same<br>time.  From that compositional perspective I think more in terms of the<br>relationships between the intervalic resources of a tuning.  And to make<br>something simple sound overtechnical, the "systematology" of those resources.<br>That more than the resources themselves.  <br><br>   What on Earth could I possibly be trying to say here?  I'll imagine myself<br>trying to compose something simultaneously in 12 and 19.  I know exactly what an<br>authentic cadence in either tuning alone.  I know what certain typical<br>modulation techniques would sound like in either tuning alone.  I know what<br>certain "tricky" chromatic variants in 19 sound like, and I have a pretty good<br>ability to imagine what a chromatic variant in either tuning would sound like<br>without hearing it.  <br><br>   But suppose that the 19- and 12-toned instruments are tuned with a C in<br>common between them.  Maybe my microtonal musicianship is lacking, but I'm<br>having a hard time imagining what the instruments would sound like together once<br>the ensemble modulates to each system's concept of an E.  First of all, there<br>would be two microtonally different concepts of that tonal center.  I can<br>certainly grind out the pitch relationships in dead ol' mathematical numbers.<br>But when I'm trying to keep a melody or harmony in my head as I'm committing<br>ideas to paper, there just ain't no way I'm going to be able to stop and grind<br>through assorted mathematical tuning theory, without losing my musical imagery!<br><br><br>   Certainly carefully devising intricately intertwined counterpoint with two<br>voices in 12 and two in 19 on tonal centers other than one in which they have a<br>common pitch basis, is just plain beyond my musical imagery abilities.  Perhaps<br>I'm underestimating the talent on the tuning list, but I suspect that I'm not<br>alone in that regard.  <br><br>   The trick, presumably, is to approach it from a far more wholistic level.<br>Ivor Darreg approached it from a perspective that might be described as "mood<br>painting".  12TET has a restless mood, and 22 has a calm mood, so mix the two<br>together and you get a painting where, at some spots on the canvas are restless<br>and calm in other spots.  And presumably something all-new in other spots.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 15 Jun 1996 19:37 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id KAA00318; Sat, 15 Jun 1996 10:37:03 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 15 Jun 1996 10:37:03 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960615103418.27492A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
