Clever, but <br>it brings up a recollection.  Dean Drummond told me that nobody is <br>allowed to play the instruments except for Newband and invited guests, who are <br>always among the top percussionists in NYC--not even SUNY Purchase <br>students who want to devote the time to learning on a regular basis.  <br>When I pressed him on this point, he agreed that if I moved to Purchase, <br>I could assist in maintenance and tuning, which would give me plenty of <br>time with the instruments.  I would never, however, play any ensemble <br>works.  It gives people like me (aspiring kitharists without the money <br>or  expertise to make one) almost no chance at all to get involved with <br>them.  I wonder how many of HP's ensemble members would have made the <br>Newband cut (no fingers pointed, just a question).  I had hoped that <br>perhaps two ensembles could be involved--Newband plus an <br>ensemble-in-training.<br><br>On another point, there *is* anecdotal evidence about how Harry wrote his <br>melodies.  Ben Johnston told me (and the scores attest) that Harry's <br>vocal lines for Barstow, US Highball and earlier pieces were not <br>precisely microtonal, but *freely ad libbed*.  Later, he found it easier <br>just to transcribe his performances while retaining the natural style in <br>order to guide the performers who sang when HP didn't do the deed himself.<br><br>As to corporealism, Li Po *is not a corporeal piece* since his theories <br>of corporealism were not yet in place.  Staging it would be <br>extra, and in my opinion, distracting from the simple elegance of the <br>songs.  The Greek Studies are also noncorporeal, as well as probably are <br>most of the smaller songs such as many of the Intrusions, The Letter, <br>etc.  Bitter Music is noncorporeal, yet multi-media.<br><br>I grant that it would be silly to produce a "concertante" version of The <br>Bewitched.  How effective would it be to stage Bless This Home?  I'll go <br>further and argue that a staging of Barstow would be nothing better than <br>a pantomime, since the piece is inherently the text plus accompaniment, <br>and lacks a coherent dramatic concept, such as that found in Water! Water!.<br><br>Adam<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 24 Jul 1996 09:59 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id AAA21324; Wed, 24 Jul 1996 00:59:49 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 24 Jul 1996 00:59:49 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199607240758.AAA21238@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4676 href="#4676">ðŸ”—</a>Murat Ses &#x3C;Murat.Ses@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/1997 11:16:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Hi<br><br><br>Help!!!<br>I need a Window-based software to microtune my soundcard.<br>Do you have win3.1X version of SCALA?<br><br><br><br>Murat<br><br><br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>"The Timeless and Boundariless Context of <br>	Culture and Civilization"<br><br>	Main Idea of Murat's Trilogy<br><br>	Released Concept Albums:<br><br>AUTOMATON    *    BINFEN   *	C..(planned till 2000)<br><br>     _______\      (((      /_______<br>   _____\____ \     | ,\    / ____/_____<br> ____\______ \_\    | __\  /_/ ______/____<br>___\_______ \__\\___| |___//__/ _______/___<br>  \_______ \__ \ \v v v v/ / __/ _______/<br>     \____\___\_\_\v v v/_/_/___/____/<br>              /  / \v v/ \  \<br>             |__/  /\v/\  \__|<br>               |__/ /|\ \__|<br>                 |_/\_/\_|<br><br>If you're interested in World, New Age, Ambient...<br>My albums are available from Ron at (800) 882-4CMC<br>		<br>		aimcmc@pan.com<br><br>Any questions?
