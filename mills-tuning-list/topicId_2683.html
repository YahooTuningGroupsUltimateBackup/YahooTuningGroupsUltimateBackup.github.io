I say that<br>mostly in the entirely complimentary sense, but also from a much lesser,<br>negative sense.<br><br>   But before I elaborate on that, let me make sure that if any of you who<br>were concerned that Neil's second album would be another R&B gig, then have<br>no fear.  Stylistically, this is entirely different from his first CD.<br>Neil is very clearly capable of much more just than blues.<br><br>   So, stylistically speaking, what are the differences then?  First of<br>all, as the title suggests, the music here is almost entirely on acoustic<br>instruments (the first two tracks have electric bass, played by John<br>Starrett, by the way.)  Second, except for one track, it's not basically<br>bluesy.  Some of the tracks are jazzy, two are Indianesque (if that's a<br>word), and is one is classical guitar.  Furthermore, this CD is entirely<br>instrumental;  no vocals.<br><br>   It also differs from his first CD, which was in 19TET and 12TET, in that<br>this one is in 34TET and 19TET tunings.  I thought that the second and<br>fourth tracks did the best job of using the unique qualities of the tuning<br>to make an exciting new musical experience.<br><br>   The CD has six tracks, the first four are comparatively short and in<br>19TET, the other two are comparatively long and in 34TET.  They are the two<br>Indianesque ones.  Its total play time is only 42 minutes, but then again<br>he's selling it at a very reasonable price, so I doubt if anybody's likely<br>to be upset about that.  I suppose it's also worth mentioning that one of<br>the tracks is a different rendition of something on his first CD,<br>"Birdwalk".  That and the short play time could give the impression that<br>Neil's running out of material, but I can assure you from cassettes he's<br>sent me that that's definitely not the case.  I'm sure that both are quite<br>intentional.<br><br>   So what about those details then?  Well, to put it quite simply, Neil<br>Haverstick, John Starrett, and Ernie Crews (the drummer) are excellent<br>performers.  That's just all there is to it.  Certainly they're a lot<br>better performers than I am!  Their performances are very clean, and<br>technically capable.  Their tone and timbral control is good, recording<br>quality is generally good as well (although the last track is a live<br>performance - I suspect maybe even the live one I saw in El Paso - and<br>there is a bit of audience shuffling in spots).  Except in a few rare spots<br>(e.g., about 4:32 into track 5 where a couple drum strokes seem to hesitate<br>for a fraction of a beat), every rhythm is executed masterfully.  There is<br>no hint of indecision in Neil's improvisations, and Crews' control over the<br>tabla strikes me as marvelous.  The performance chemistry among the band is<br>a beautiful thing to behold.<br><br>   Make no mistake:  the details and moments in this CD are wonderful.  So,<br>how could that possibly have a downside, like I suggested earlier?  Well,<br>first let me emphasize that that downside is a much lesser concern than the<br>positives of this CD;  it's basically a great CD.  But even so, I get the<br>sense that Neil paid so much attention to the details, that he didn't pay<br>quite enough attention to the "big picture" - at the level of musical form.<br><br><br>   I find the first four tracks better done in that regard.  So to use the<br>first cut, "African Stick" as a positive example, I think back at it and<br>say, "yes, there's a coherent musical statement here:  first they presented<br>the opening theme with cool African rhythms, then each of the three<br>performers did a short solo, followed by Neil doing a couple-minute solo<br>with a high-pitch climax toward the middle, and then the opening theme<br>returned ending in a kinda flashy ending".  What it says as an entire<br>musical work is pretty easy to get a handle on.  But on the other hand,<br>thinking back to the next-to-last track, "34 Steps", by the time the next<br>track starts, it's hard for me to remember much about it, or any really<br>clear reason why that track is there, other than enjoyably filling time.<br><br>   And of course, there's nothing at all wrong with "enjoyably filling<br>time".  "34 Steps" works great as a "go with the flow" piece.  But once<br>this CD goes onto the shelf, memorable musical experiences in a given track<br>are about all that can give me reason to reach for THAT particular CD from<br>among the other three-hundred or so in my collection!<br><br>   But above all however, let me state unequivocally that I have heard a<br>LOT of music - both microtonal and conventional - even some fine jazz -<br>that is VASTLY less impressive in this big-picture regard than Neil's CD<br>here.  So all-in-all, I think this is a fairly small downside, mostly just<br>to the extent that there is a gulf between the masterfulness of the details<br>and that of the big picture.<br><br>   So, here's what I recommend:  Above all, BUY THIS CD!  As you listen to<br>it revel in the little things, and when the last two tracks come on, listen<br>to them as a "go with the flow" experience, and don't ask yourself "so<br>where is this going and where has it been?"  Just sit back and enjoy them<br>moment to moment.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Paul H.
