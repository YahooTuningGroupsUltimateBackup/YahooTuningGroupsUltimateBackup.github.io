Could someone post a list<br>of pitches in cents that represents a fairly popular historical well<br>temperament?<br><br>On another subject, some of the music I play contains "diminished 7th"<br>chords (stacked minor thirds).  Is this chord a modern invention?  It seems<br>to me that such a thing is impossible in anything but equal temperament.<br>I'm having a hard time getting acceptable diminished chords out of my E9<br>pedal steel using the standard JI tuned pedals.  I know I could tune a pedal<br>specifically for these chords, but that's really an awkward solution.<br>Comments?<br><br>    -b0b-<br><br>http://wco.com/~quasar/</div>
