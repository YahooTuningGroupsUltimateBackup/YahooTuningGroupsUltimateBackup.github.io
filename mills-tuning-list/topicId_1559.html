(So please excuse the less than artful<br>voice leading :)<br><br>I've appended some notation below which illustrates how I made the<br>progressions in 22.  The source scale is 0-2-4-7-9-11-13-16-18-20,<br>and the borrowed tone (deg 15) comes from the same scale on the<br>dominant (13-15-17...)<br><br><br>The "bad" version [ii "regular" minor triad]:<br><br>				20<br>			17<br>	13				13<br>	7	9			7<br>	0	0	4	4	0<br>8va ----------------------------------------------------<br>		16	<br>			10	13<br>			 ^<br>			 |<br>		    comma shifts<br><br><br>	I	IV	ii	V	I<br><br><br>The "good" version [ii "diminished" triad with a subminor third]:<br><br>				20<br>			15<br>	13				13<br>	7	9			7<br>	0	0	4	4	0<br>8va ----------------------------------------------------<br>		16	<br>			9	13<br>			^<br>			| deg. 15 is borrowed tone<br><br><br>Of course since then I think I've grokked a little more, so I'll <br>probably go back and try this or similar exercises using 4 voices<br>(as long as the stretch on the keyboard doesn't get out of hand,<br>that is :)<br><br>Gary, I hope this answers your questions well enough.

From what I recall of his notes, he has sketched out<br>CPSes with all combinations, including repeated factors, through 15, and<br>tried out a few promising sets with higher factors. The three Eikosany he<br>has worked with most are 3(1,3,5,7,9,11), 3(1,3,7,9,11,15), and<br>3(1,3,5,7,11,13) and the two Hebdomekontany are 4(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15) and<br>4(1,3,5,7,11,13,17,19), the latter of which I have played with on my Rayna.<br>(It can have a Stravinskian quality due to the everpresent quasi-octotonic<br>scales).<br><br>Perhaps John can persuade Erv to publish his ''Letter to Adrian Fokker''<br>and ''Letter to John Chalmers'' where all of this material - including the<br>graphing that Paul describes - were first set out.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 16 Jan 1997 20:07 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA30947; Thu, 16 Jan 1997 20:10:48 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA30918<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA13221; Thu, 16 Jan 1997 11:10:45 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 16 Jan 1997 11:10:45 -0800<br>Message-Id: <32DE79AA.28F@top.monad.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
