Says:<br>> Lyons' logical error is his assumption that he can misuse and abuse and <br>> warp and twist the word  "experimental" at will.<br><br>   Uhmmm...  Well, Eric Lyon didn't fall into that "Bengal tiger" trap;  he just<br>quoted a bunch of people who did.  <br><br>   "Experimental Music" is a common term for music based upon unusual ideas.  If<br>indeed that's a misguided usage of the word "experimental", then it'll have to<br>go down as a common but misguided colloquialism rather than a bad choice of word<br>definitions on Eric's part.  <br><br>   Now I'm not suggesting that it's necessarily a good or bad term - just<br>common.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 3 Dec 1996 04:47 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10595; Tue, 3 Dec 1996 04:49:12 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10517<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id TAA18878; Mon, 2 Dec 1996 19:49:04 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 2 Dec 1996 19:49:04 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961202224715_1952119539@emout02.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
