But this seems not to be true<br>of the Kyma flute.  For specific non-multiple-of-12 systems the idea<br>of physically but NOT conceptually  adapting existing the keywork<br>seems out of the question (or defeats the object).  For<br>post-Logical-Bassoon type designs, (ie., computer-circuit controlled<br> tone and (multiple) speaker holes) the ball game is quite different.<br> The branched-tube design idea being developed at IRCAM would also<br>seem to contradict this.<br><br>> I believe there should be enough evidence in Prague for the quartertone<br>> clarinets that the Czechs use for their annual performances of Haba's<br>> _Matka_.  I've know many clarinetists that have mastered various tunings,<br>> though each focuses on different intonational terrain.<br><br>Sorry, I lost you.  Evidence for what?  That they are an improvement<br>for playing Haba or not ? On this topic I'd be very grateful if you<br>can give me any more details.  The 4 quarter tone clarinets I'm aware<br>of (Digest 1230):  Stein 1911 (built by Kohlert 1912),  two<br>commissioned by Haba (Kohlert 1924 and 1931), and Schuller (1933).<br><br>Schuller's is the double-bore instrument now in Markneukirchen (see<br>the photograph in Kroll's 'The Clarinet').  The others are single<br>bore.  I feel sure there must be others?  Do you by any chance know<br>any of the players who would be involved in Matka?<br><br>> There is a fellow in California that  developed "Fenchaphones"<br><br>Thanks, that's a good lead.  I'd be very grateful if anyone can give<br>me a name or address etc.  The idea is one I have been exploring for<br>multiple tuning options.<br><br>> I guess the exploration of the standard instruments needs to be through<br>> before I would recommend changing their physical form.<br><br>It will never be through!  The idea of building new instruments<br>doesn't mean the old one's are going to be scrapped...<br><br>>Each offers so much more than present consciousness allows.<br><br>Unfortunately, current instruments do not aid (as well as they might)<br>the advancement of the microtonal imagination: we work with<br>conventional designs because they are (in acoustic instrumental<br>terms) the best we have, and because we play them.  But, in a sense,<br>the design of current instruments hinders the development of that<br>conciousness, since they demand a degree of technique which will be<br>unnecessary with new and specifically designed instruments for a<br>given system (or systems).<br><br>But -  thanks for the your thoughts -  also the references from<br>Daniel Wolf.<br><br>Patrick Ozzard-Low<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET><br>Subject:  Re: Woodwinds for ATS<br>PostedDate:  17-11-97 21:54:07<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  17-11-97 21:53:24-17-11-97 21:53:24,17-11-97 21:53:34-17-11-97 21:53:34<br>DeliveredDate:  17-11-97 21:53:34<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256552.0072BE12; Mon, 17 Nov 1997 21:53:17 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01078; Mon, 17 Nov 1997 21:54:07 +0100<br>Date: Mon, 17 Nov 1997 21:54:07 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01076<br>Received: (qmail 8479 invoked from network); 17 Nov 1997 12:54:04 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 17 Nov 1997 12:54:04 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.95.971117153522.24304A-100000@u3.farm.idt.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
