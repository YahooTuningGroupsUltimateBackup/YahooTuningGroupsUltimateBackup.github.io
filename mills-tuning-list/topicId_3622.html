It's probably fair to say that that depends on what sorts of<br>unusual tunings you're interested in.  If you expect to render *very* long,<br>sustained chords, in exact JI with no vibrato or most any other expressive<br>device, then better than 0.1Hz resoltion could potentially have value.  I'm<br>inclined to thinkg that there probably aren't many musically-realistic<br>cases that require that, though.<br><br>   But as for what the MR-series' and ASR-X's resolution is, I confess that<br>I don't personally know.  Presumably John Loffink's web page lists it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>>I've been reading through the discussion on Ensoniqs that was going on<br>>here recently,and I don't<br>>quite get something : You said that  the MR and ASR-X can hold only one<br>>"global" tuning,does this mean that it can only use one tuning at a time<br>>on all MIDI channels ?<br><br>   I have heard that to be the case here on the list, but I didn't myself<br>make that that claim, nor do I personally know that for certain.  But they<br>do support the MIDI tuning, which, from what little I do know of it, does<br>have significant support for dynamic tuning.</div>
