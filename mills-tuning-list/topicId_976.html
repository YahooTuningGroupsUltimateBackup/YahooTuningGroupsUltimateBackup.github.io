The re-posted synth<br>evaluation was helpful, but a few worthwhile units were not mentioned. In<br>particular, the Marion Systems ASR-2 and Pro-Synth both have 4 tuning tables<br>which are completely retunable to 1/512th of a cent. According to Keyboard<br>Magazine's 1996 Buyer's Guide (December 1995), Korg's Trinity and General<br>Music's S2, S3, and S2R are also completely retunable. If 12-key tunability<br>is OK, recent Roland models (e.g. JV and XP series) are capable. Keyboard<br>lists Roland SC series modules as being retunable, but I didn't see how from<br>looking at the manuals. Their new sound expansion modules can't be retuned.<br>I was told by a Yamaha tech on the phone that the VL70m is 12-key retunable<br>via software. I have talked to some manufacturer reps about non-12ET tuning;<br>their perception is often that not enough buyers  care about it. <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 6 Oct 1996 23:03 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00557; Sun, 6 Oct 1996 22:04:24 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00555<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id OAA07464; Sun, 6 Oct 1996 14:04:21 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 6 Oct 1996 14:04:21 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199610062102.OAA01174@mail.cdsnet.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
