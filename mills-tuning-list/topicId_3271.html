I <br>have a couple of questions for those who know about this unit: (1) how <br>does this terminology jibe with Partch's and those used in the Just <br>Intonation Primer? and (2) I know my ears are spoiled by tempered music, <br>but I don't hear any difference between these tunings and equal <br>tempered.  How does one check to make sure the tunings are correct?  I <br>tuned a double harp using the just - major tuning, and all the triads <br>sounded too like equal temperament to my ear (admittedly unschooled as <br>yet).  <br><br>Thanks for any comments and advice from the list.<br><br>Brian Drake<br>bd57@hotmail.com<br><br>______________________________________________________<br>Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com</div>
