My thought was that the demonstration would<br>substantiate the idea that tempering the fifth 5.4 cents flat would leave its<br>character essentially intact.<br><br>	He was working with his frequency meter and I said: "The E is 5.4 cents<br>flat".  He set his meter to minus 5.4 cents and was working his tuning hammer<br>this way and that as strobe lights on his meter would rotate first clockwise<br>and then counterclockwise.  Finally he got the E pretty well at the -5.4 cent<br>point and played the A 440 - tempered E 660 fifth.  As I heard it - with its<br>disappointingly off sound - I felt a wave of discomfort.  I hadn't thought a<br>quarter comma mean tone fifth sounded that bad.  My piano tuner, a twelve<br>equal temperament fan, said: "Whew!".  Then I began speculating as to why, in<br>this situation, the tempered fifth sounded so bad.  Perhaps it was because not<br>all three unisons were being used.  So he tuned the other E 660 unisons and<br>the fifth continued to sound "off".  I'd heard this "off" sound quite a lot<br>with my quarter comma mean tone tuned piano, and I'd felt that when strings<br>went slightly out-of-tune in such a direction as to make a tempered fifth even<br>flatter, it didn't take much to make it sound "off".  But if the tuning was<br>accurate, the 5.4 cent flat fifths sounded to me like acceptable fifths as<br>long as I didn't listen too critically to them.<br><br>	I thought: "Well, I guess they sound worse than I'd thought.  If that's the<br>way they sound, that's the way they sound, and that's what I'll demonstrate to<br>the music students."  Then the thought hit me - "The frequency meter reads<br>minus 5.4 cents, but that's 5.4 cents less than the EQUAL TEMPERAMENT<br>frequency for the E5, which is ALREADY tempered close to 2.0 cents flat!  I<br>felt a sense of relief and asked him to set the E to minus 3.4 cents, which he<br>did.  He played the less tempered fifth again and it sounded "right" for a<br>quarter comma fifth to me - just barely OK.  By that I mean that when I hear<br>it, it has that feel of a musical, significant fifth with some kind of<br>emotional impact.  One knows it's "tempered", but it doesn't seem to have lost<br>too much of its character.  The 7.4 cent flat fifth, on the other hand,<br>sounded immediately recognizable to my ears - and my piano tuner's - to be<br>"off".<br><br>	What this inadvertent lesson brought home to me was something I'd already<br>come to believe - that pitch differences as small as 2 cents on an instrument<br>such as the piano can make a significant difference to the character of a<br>musical interval's sound.<br><br>	When he tuned the E5 to a pure fifth above A 440, setting his frequency meter<br>to plus 1.9 cents, the pure fifth on the piano really sounded good.  As he was<br>getting close, I found myself wanting to hear the E sharper and just a bit<br>sharper, etc.  Then it sounded really good.  I didn't place that fifth next to<br>an equal tempered fifth, but will do so when I prepare the demonstrations in<br>my computer.  I'm pretty sure, though, that the just fifth really does sound<br>different than a fifth which is only two cents flat.<br><br>	He also tuned the C sharp 5 to both an equal tempered third above the A4 and<br>to a Pythagorean third +7.8 cents on his meter while the E was a just fifth<br>above A4.  On the piano, the Pythagorean third sounded stranger and more<br>inharmonious than an equal tempered third.  The just triad on A4 which I<br>played and recorded (other piano strings damped) sounded really good - sweet<br>and high and bright.  The Pythagorean triad on A4 sounded - to me - really<br>strange - not terrible, but quite strange.<br><br>	What I'm learning with the piano is that in some cases, quite small changes<br>in pitch can appreciably affect a chord's character.<br><br>	Note: I've had the piano in quarter comma mean tone temperament for about six<br>months and have been playing it a lot, practicing and improving my piano<br>technique.  Yesterday, after setting the demonstration fifths and thirds to be<br>recorded then, my piano tuner put the piano into sixth comma mean tone<br>temperament.  It will be in that tuning for a week while I make comparison<br>recordings of pieces I've already recorded in 1/4 comma mean tone temperament.<br>Then next week he'll tune the piano to equal temperament so that I can make<br>comparison recordings of these numbers in equal temperament.  Soon after that,<br>he'll return the piano to 1/4 comma mean tone temperament, which I find very<br>enjoyable to play.<br><br>	Dave Hill,  La Mesa, CA</div>
