There were fewer<br>than 10 copies available to us at this price, so we were sadly unable to<br>provide this book to anywhere near the number of people who wanted it.<br>The book is still in print and is available new from Michigan State<br>University Press at the $70 (ouch) list price. MSU Press informed us<br>that they have several hundred in stock, but the book will not be<br>reprinted once these sell out. Their order number is: 517 35-9543<br><br><br>The following books are new arrivals at Mockingbird Books and may be of<br>interest to tuning afficionados and/or adventurous composers and<br>musicians. All prices include book rate postage. Quantities are limited.<br><br>If interested, please call 408 689-9113 10:00 to 2:00 Pacific time<br>7 days a week. <br><br>Butler, David	THE MUSICIAN'S GUIDE TO PERCEPTION AND COGNITION.<br>(includes CD of 62 listening examples) Schirmer Books 1992<br>List price $60.  Our price $30.<br><br>	An ideal resource for every student and scholar engaged in<br>	research in musical perception, cognition, and the psychology of <br>music, describing what we currently know of the psychoacoustical <br>features and cognitive aspects of musical sound, written 		specifically<br>from a musician's point of view. The book is 		organized in two parts.<br>Part One explores the "Psychophysics of 	Musical Sound" and is divided<br>into sections dealing with the 		sensory attributes of pitch, timbre,<br>loudness, and time and 		space. Part Two explores the "Mental<br>Representations of Musical 	Relationships," and is divided into sections<br>dealing with the 		cognitive aspects of pitch, timbre, and time, and<br>the 			development of musical cognitive awareness from infancy to 	<br>adulthood. The book also contains a very helpful glossary 		that defines<br>such things as the subtle differences among terms 		such as "harmonic,"<br>"overtone," and "tone partial" - terms that  	seem to cause confusion<br>and misunderstanding in tuning circles.<br>	A particularly interesting item in the book is Appendix B: The 		Humane<br>Treatment of Human Subjects, which begins: "There is 		often only a thin<br>line between 'stimulation and irritation..."<br>	The book concludes with a 16 page bibliography and helpful 		index.<br>Highly recommended! <br><br><br>Slonimsky, Nicholas 	THESAURUS OF SCALES AND MELODIC PATTERNS <br>Schirmer Books 1975. List price $55.00  Our price $27.50<br><br>	If you are not familiar with Slonimsky's 1947 masterpiece, 	you're in<br>for a treat. With well over 1300 different scales and 	melodic	patterns<br>to play with, you might find yourself aswim in 	new musical ideas. "The<br>purpose of the thesaurus is to provide a 	comprehensive musical<br>vocabulary of melodic phraseology for 		modern composers and performers.<br>The contents furnish ample 		material for imaginative improvisation and<br>actual composition. A 	special feature is a set of 'master chords' to be<br>used in 		harmonizing individual scales. The resulting harmonizations 	<br>create peculiarly resonant impressionistic colors. The materials 	are<br>classified according to the division of an octave into two, 	three,<br>four, six, and twelve equal parts, upon which ornamental 	designs are<br>built by interpolation and extrapolation. The main 		divisions of the<br>book include Pentatonic Scales, Pandiatonic 		Progressions, Dodecaphonic<br>Structures, Mirror Interval Series, 		Melodic Permutations, Plural<br>Scales, Bitonal Arpeggios, 		Polytonal Polyrhythmic Scales, and<br>Palindromic Canons." Although 	written with piano players in mind, the<br>possibilities that arise 	when one considers applying the wealth of<br>ideas in this book to 	performance on non-equal tempered instruments are<br>mind boggling.<br>	<br>	"Musical history may be saved from becoming a palindrome through 	the<br>progress made possible by Slonimsky's THESAURUS." <br>	- Henry	Cowell<br><br>Russell, Armand and Trubitt, Allen  THE SHAPING OF MUSICAL ELEMENTS<br>Schirmer 1992 2 vols, spiral bound.  List price $65.90  Our price $20.00<br><br>	This is a comprehensive first year course in college music 		theory.<br>Throughout, this text is concerned with "tension," the 		principal<br>manifestation of the affective nature of music. 		Tension patterns in<br>music have direct bearing on the 			interpretation of that music in<br>performance. The theoretical 		material covered in this text includes<br>diatonic harmony, 		borrowed chords, secondary dominants, and leading<br>tone chords, 		melodic analysis and musical forms from the phrase to the<br>binary 	and ternary forms and comparable structures. This is not an 	<br>"easy" theory book, but is aimed at serious students with a bit 	of<br>fundamental musical knowledge under their belts.<br><br><br>Starr, Larry A UNION OF DIVERSITIES - STYLE IN THE MUSIC OF CHARLES IVES<br>Schirmer 1992	List price $35  Our price $17.50<br><br>	Starr argues that, far from being an eccentric and musically 	<br>indifferent composer, Ives was genuinely engaged with the most 		serious<br>and original aesthetic issues of his day. The key to 		unlocking what<br>his music is about is style: specifically the 		heterogenity of style<br>within a single work. Stylistic 			heterogenity shatters our traditional<br>musical expectations and 		simultaneously creates challenging and<br>unprecedented expressive 	experiences. This is a new understanding of<br>Ives's extraordinary 	music based on the fundamental conviction that<br>Ives need not a 		specialist's composer.<br><br><br>Thank you for your interest.<br><br>Best wishes<br><br>Mark Bradlyn and Claire Sherard<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 8 Feb 1997 07:04 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29761; Sat, 8 Feb 1997 07:03:59 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29724<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id WAA16790; Fri, 7 Feb 1997 22:02:29 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 7 Feb 1997 22:02:29 -0800<br>Message-Id: <32FC109C.6BA8@ix.netcom.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
