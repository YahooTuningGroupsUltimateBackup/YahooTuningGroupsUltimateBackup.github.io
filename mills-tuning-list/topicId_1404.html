I thought I'd<br>mention what I've pretty much completely decided to do because I've<br>realized in a flash that my engagements *here* have had some sort<br>of effect on the content.<br><br>As it currently stands, I've made the decision to be *extremely*<br>clear that what I've chosen to broadcast is in no way a "canonical"<br>view - it's an arbitrary circle drawn according to the recordings<br>I could easily acquire, listener requests, etc. I'd also initially thought<br>that I'd bombard listeners with *lots* of little example pieces - but<br>I've opted instead to go for much longer performances which ought to<br>include ample time for the novice ear to start responding in a more<br>comfortable fashion. Finally, I think I've managed to get my hands on<br>a copy of LaMonte's "The Turtle - His Dreams and Journeys" on the<br>positively ancient Jazz Edition X label (yep - the one with Jon Hassell<br>and Tony Conrad, et. al.) - it seems a shame *not* to present a good<br>chunk of it, given its archival interest. So the program will pretty much<br>break up into looking at a couple of "kinds" of microtonalists - the<br>"outsiders" like Harry and Ivor (a tip of the hat to Ives here), some work<br>from those awful "academic" sorts who actually worked in the stuff<br>(Ben J. and Easley B. - hey, that sounds like a rap group!), and some<br>stuff from LaMonte and Terry (with a nod to the influence of Pandit<br>Pran Nath and non-western sources in general) as exemplars of the<br>20 or 30-year-old experimental/minimal wing. I can keep one of my<br>long-time listeners who's pestered me to hear the Columbia discs of<br>Partch's "Delusion of the Fury" happy, too.<br><br>I didn't realize it at the time, but I think that part of this program is<br>starting rather to drift from a position of polemic (that is, an exercise<br>in the didactic) toward one in which we let the listener's *ears* do the<br>initial work, and then suggest in program #2 (*you* lot) that this isn't<br>merely a kind of historically fenced curiousity, but instead a field in which<br>there's considerable idiosyncracy and range. I think that #3 is now cruising<br>toward contemporary performances of the older works (Ted Mook's Partch disc,<br>the Dean Drummond stuff) in addition to non-western musics outside of 12tET.<br><br>One of the interesting things about this broadcast thing involves watching a<br>given idea of collection of works "drift." I honestly think that I might have<br>had something considerably more didactic in mind - suggested by the recent<br>exchange of "course notes," perhaps. But what seems to be emerging is more<br>something more for the ears. Does this mean that my choice to foreground the<br>WORK rather than the ideas and equations mean that I'm channelling Brian?<br><br>:-)<br><br>Gregory<br><br>_<br>When I pronounce the word Future,/the first syllable already belongs to the<br>past./When I pronounce the word Silence,/I destroy it./When I pronounce the<br>word Nothing,/I make something no nonbeing can hold./ (Wislawa Szymborska)<br>Gregory Taylor, Heurikon Corp.<br>http://www.msn.fullfeed.com/~gtaylor/home.html<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 19 Dec 1996 20:33 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA09239; Thu, 19 Dec 1996 20:36:05 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09232<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA27929; Thu, 19 Dec 1996 11:35:57 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 19 Dec 1996 11:35:57 -0800<br>Message-Id: <9612191116.ZM1156@frollo><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
