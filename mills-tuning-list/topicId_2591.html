Kukula:<br><br>I do believe that the place and periodicity mechanisms are both at play.<br>I also believe that Plomp's model gives a fine account of the<br>place-related component of dissonance, which I like to call roughness.<br>Combination tones complicate the matter but with a knowledge of the<br>amplitudes and frequencies of all combination tone components, Plomp's<br>algorithm can be still applied. But a phenomenon called "virtual pitch"<br>or "fundamental tracking" is central to Parncutt's treatment of<br>dissonance and does represent, I believe, an additional factor besides<br>critical band roughness. This phenomenon is clearly distinct from the<br>combination tone phenomenon, but it may have a lot to do with<br>periodicity mechanisms. There is a very strong propensity for the ear to<br>try to fit what it hears into one or a small number of harmonic series,<br>and the fundamentals of these series, even if not physically present,<br>are either heard outright, or provide a more subtle sense of overall<br>pitch known to musicians as the "root". As a component of consonance,<br>the ease with which the ear/brain system can resolve the fundamental is<br>known as "tonalness." I have proposed a concept called "relative<br>harmonic entropy" to model this component of dissonance. The harmonic<br>entropy is based on the concept that the critical band represents a<br>certain degree of uncertainty in the perception of pitch, and for any<br>"true" interval, the auditory system will perceive a range of intervals<br>spanning a number of simple-integer ratios. Simple-integer ratios come<br>into the picture because if the heard tones are to be understood as<br>harmonic overtones of some missing fundamental or root, they must form a<br>simple-integer ratio with one another. The range is a sort of<br>probability distribution, and a certain amount of probability is<br>associated with each of the simple-integer ratios.<br><br>One way of modeling this is with a Farey series and its mediants. The<br>Farey series of order n is simply the set all the ratios of numbers not<br>exceeding n, and the mediant between two consecutive fractions in a<br>Farey series is the sum of the numerators over the sum of the<br>denominators (this definition has many mathematical and acoustical<br>justifications). The simpler-integer ratios take up a lot of room,<br>defined as the interval between the mediant below and the mediant above,<br>in interval space, and so are associated with large "slices" of the<br>probability distribution, while the more complex ratios are more crowded<br>and therefore are associated with smaller "slices." Now the harmonic<br>entropy is defined, just like in information theory, as the sum over all<br>ratios of a certain function of the probability associated with that<br>ratio. The function is x*log(x). (See an information theory text to find<br>out why.) When the true interval is near a simple-integer ratio, there<br>will be one large probability and many much smaller ones. When the true<br>interval is far from any simple-integer ratios, many more complex ratios<br>will all have roughly equal probabilities. The entropy function will<br>come out quite small in the former case, and quite large in the latter<br>case. In the case of 700 cents, 3/2 will have far more probabilty than<br>any other ratio, and the harmonic entropy is nearly minimal. In the case<br>of 300 cents, 6/5 will have the largest probability in most cases, but<br>7/6, 13/11, and 19/16 will all have non-negligible amounts of<br>probability, so the harmonic entropy is moderate. In the case of 100<br>cents, 15/14, 16/15, 17/16, 18/17, 19/18, 20/19, and 1/1 will all have<br>significant probability, and the harmonic entropy is nearly maximal.<br><br>In terms of the periodicity model, we can imagine a process which<br>samples the signal for random periods of time (with some probability<br>distribution that is large for very short times and vanishes for long<br>enough times) and in each period, counts the cycles of each pitch to<br>come up with a ratio (or equivalently, to come up with a fundamental<br>frequency, of which the heard note will be harmonic overtones and<br>therefore possess a small-integer ratio by implication). Note that<br>harmonic partials within the heard tones are irrelevant because the<br>cycles here need not be sinusoidal for the counting to occur.<br><br>If logs to the base 2 are used in the definition above, the entropy<br>measures the expected amount of information, in bits, needed in an<br>optimal code to communicate the ratio being heard. So the entropy really<br>measures, in a sense, "cognitive dissonance." Now the exact probability<br>distribution of sampling times, or the order of Farey series one should<br>use, is something that may be difficult to determine. However, as the<br>order of the Farey series is increased more and more, the entropy curve<br>(defined as a function of interval width) continues rising but stops<br>changing shape (I have observed this numerically but not proved it<br>mathematically). In the limit of a Farey series of order infinity, one<br>should find a smooth "relative entropy" curve that gives a good<br>approximation of the ups and downs of the entropy curve for any<br>reasonably large finite order. These curves look remarkably like many of<br>the Helmholtz/Plomp curves that were derived from completely different<br>assumptions, and though they are meant to represent a completely<br>different component of dissonance, they lead to the same conclusions for<br>intervals of tones with some appropriate overtone structure.<br><br>However, when three or more notes are involved, the two components of<br>dissonance can have quite different behavior. Consider Partch's "otonal"<br>and "utonal" chords. Adding higher identities to both chords increases<br>the roughness of both by the same amount. But while the periodicity of<br>the otonal chords will be unchanged or perhaps multiplied by small<br>powers of two, the periodicity of the utonal chords increases<br>dramatically. Thus the process of counting will not be significantly<br>complicated, and may even be aided, by adding higher identities to the<br>otonal chords, while in the utonal case the likelihood of counting the<br>same relative numbers of cycles in each sampling period becomes very<br>small, and thus the entropy becomes very large. So the high-limit utonal<br>chords, though just as much minima of roughness as the corresponding<br>otonal chords, are almost impossible to assign a fundamental frequency<br>to and are therefore not minima of harmonic entropy.<br><br>It is often possible for the brain to look for periodicities among some<br>components of the signal and dismiss the rest as "noise." This is why<br>the root of a major triad does not appear to change when the third is<br>decreased from 5/4 through 11/9 to 6/5 and the chord becomes a minor<br>triad; although the minor triad can be understood as 10:12:15, these<br>numbers are already too high for the entropy of the entire signal to be<br>low enough to compete with the low entropy of the perfect fifth alone<br>(10:15 = 2:3); even the major third alone (12:15 = 4:5) is stronger and<br>can dominate if the "third" is in the bass. In the otonal case, looking<br>at any subset of the notes present (except 9:3, etc.) will lead to a<br>periodicity which is octave-equivalent to, if not identical to, that of<br>the entire chord, so various combinations of components of the signal<br>effect a reinforcement of the tonalness of the overall chord. How to<br>weigh the various subsets' contributions to the probabilities of<br>particular fundamentals in an overall analysis is unclear. Even without<br>the consideration of subsets, there appears to be no mathematical theory<br>of ratios of three of more numbers analogous to Farey theory, and no<br>easy way to create one. Unlike roughness, tonalness is not merely<br>concerned with pairwise interactions of tones but three-way and higher<br>interactions as well. A mathematical model for it is out of my grasp at<br>the moment.<br><br>It's amazing I get any work done around here . . .<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com><br>Subject:  Erlich's Theory<br>PostedDate:  31-10-97 16:24:12<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  31-10-97 16:23:12-31-10-97 16:23:13,31-10-97 15:23:44-31-10-97 15:23:44<br>DeliveredDate:  31-10-97 15:23:44<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256541.005482C9; Fri, 31 Oct 1997 16:23:05 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00776; Fri, 31 Oct 1997 16:24:12 +0100<br>Date: Fri, 31 Oct 1997 16:24:12 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00805<br>Received: (qmail 28045 invoked from network); 31 Oct 1997 07:24:05 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 31 Oct 1997 07:24:05 -0800<br>Message-Id: <19971031152436078.AAA181@NIETZSCHE><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
