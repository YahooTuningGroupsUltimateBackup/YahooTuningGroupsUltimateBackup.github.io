I think some find 16/9 consonant<br>in such contexts due more to its proximity to the 12-ET minor 7th than due to<br>anything more profound.<br><br>The ETs I use, 19, 22, 27, 31, have separate 7:4 and 9:5 representations, which<br>I use as outlined above. As one might expect, I use the 7:4 atop minor triads<br>with the 7:6 third. <br><br>4:5:6:7 can be treated in most respects as the dominant 7th in traditional<br>harmony. The only difference I make is in the voice-leading around the 7:4--for<br>example, I find unprepared 8:7 melodic motion ugly, but enjoy<br>smaller-than-semitone voice-leading. <br><br>As for its use in traditional diatonic contexts:<br><br>Do NOT substitute the 7:4 over V for the diatonic scale degree 4--for melodic<br>purposes, use 4:3, and for dominant seventh chords, use 7:4 over V. This<br>practice will not bother anyone who makes use of the dominant seventh chord in<br>the minor scale.<br><br>Harmonically yours,<br>Harold Fortuin<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 15:11 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA28637; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 15:13:11 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA31032<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id GAA28899; Mon, 9 Sep 1996 06:13:01 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 9 Sep 1996 06:13:01 -0700<br>Message-Id: <9609091309.AA19130@arthaud.saclay.cea.fr><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
