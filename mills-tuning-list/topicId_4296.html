I've found that if I enter space then <br>>carriage return by the time I've typed 72 characters in a line <br>>my entry looks normal and the quotes and other <br>>punctuation marks are transmitted as I've typed <br>>them.  It took me a while to discover this but it's <br>>working well now.  Let's see - (80 character line) -<br>><br>>xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx<br>>xxxxxxxxx <br><br>Dave, check your mail reader options.  There should be an area to set your<br>wrap width (although you never know, with AOL).  I use Eudora, which is<br>about the best wysiwyg mailer around as far as customizing goes (Pegasus is<br>also very good, and free), and set my width to 79 characters, which is the<br>width used by most terminals that the internet grew up on.  My posts<br>usually look okay, although sometimes I have problems.  Your test line<br>seems to indicate 69 might be better, but then why do my posts not look worse?<br><br>Carl</div>
