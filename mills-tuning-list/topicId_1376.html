The (in)famous Johnny Reinhard was here <br>from New York, playing in most of the pieces. More about him shortly.<br><br>My reaction is in some parts the same as Johnathan's. Some of the pieces<br>on the concert didn't do enough. I went with an acquaintance who felt the<br>same way. In several pieces, something might happen, then something else<br>might happen, all very low-key. Of course, there were some good pieces<br>too, and all of them had good moments, but not much of the concert will<br>convince anyone of anything concerning microtonality. <br><br>The reason, I think, as has been mentioned by Warren Burt, Neil<br>Haverstick, and others, is that fine music transcends tuning. It does not<br>mean that tuning isn't integral to a piece, but it does mean that tuning<br>*alone* isn't likely to make a piece work. There are exceptions, but few. <br>One piece that Marc Sabat played tonight may be an exception, in fact,<br>for the natural harmonics made the piece work as well as it did...although<br>it would be hard to imagine this colourful, slow, atmospheric piece<br>(Marc's "Prism") without the violin's timbre and the harmonics. <br><br>So my remarks will seem similar to Johnathan's, although in this concert<br>little improvisation was involved. Many of the pieces were simply too<br>simple, not taking advantage of the microtonal resources available. <br><br>Now to Mr. Reinhard, whom I had not heard before. Regardless of the pitch<br>structures and how accurately they were delivered (which I think were<br>fairly so), and even apart from questions of style (which are sure to<br>enter at least for Partch), Johnny Reinhard seems to me a wonderful<br>performer. He intoned some Li Po, played the bassoon, and played the<br>recorder (the latter two in his own pieces, among others). He has this way<br>with his instruments (including voice) and his audience that makes<br>anything he does alive and engaging. Again, the music wasn't always tops,<br>but Johnny was a treat to hear and to watch. I'd recommend anyone in the<br>New York area to seek him out. <br><br>His equal in this concert was certainly Marc Sabat, an amazing violinist <br>whom we are lucky to have in Toronto. Margaret Gay, the cellist, was also <br>very fine, although she had less to do.<br><br>Another comment I made to my concert-mate was that few of these pieces had<br>fast parts, and few of them seemed able to use many of the notes of a<br>tuning (e.g. 31 ET) in a satisfying harmonic way. In other words, the<br>tunings may have liberated the sounds, but they also restricted them. Part<br>of this is a result of some of the instruments used, because they may not<br>be agile enough or constructed in such a way as to make music of a<br>different kind possible. <br><br>Probably this will engender debate and disagreement. But all I am saying <br>is that the movement may need to be more convincing musically. It <br>certainly needs variety, more than one is likely to hear in any one city.<br><br>Paul Rapoport<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 15 Dec 1996 16:43 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03470; Sun, 15 Dec 1996 16:45:35 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04474<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id HAA07224; Sun, 15 Dec 1996 07:45:32 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 15 Dec 1996 07:45:32 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009ACE2F340EA200.CE85@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
