Nov.<br>18 through Monday afternoon Nov. 23. My prime directive is to examine<br>the completed MicroZone keyboard and corresponding software for Windows<br>95. I'm looking forward to trying Harvey Starr's 810-key<br>velocity-sensitive instrument, and, providing it meets my needs, to take<br>one home with me (once a pitch template envelope is mounted on top, as<br>my Clavette has).<br><br>Almost as important is the chance to meet my fellow xenharmonicists. In<br>case you're not familiar with my work, you can at least get some sense<br>of what I'm up to from http://www.wavefront.com/~hfortuin. The Clavette<br>microtonal keyboard controller that I designed is described there.<br><br>Since the completion of the Clavette in 1994, the bulk of my<br>compositions have been microtonal, including  works in 19, 22, and<br>31-ET. My approach in these pieces has been to revisit existing styles<br>of Romantic to early Modern Classical music and jazz (chromatic tonal<br>music), but with the additional resources of these richer ETs. I work<br>out new functional harmonies by modelling the voice-leading with these<br>ratios above 1/1:<br><br>7/6, 6/5, 11/9, 5/4, 9/7 (the five kinds of thirds)<br><br>7/5, 3/2 (fifths)<br><br>7/4, 9/5, 11/6, 15/8, 27/14 (the sevenths a 3/2 above the thirds)<br><br>17/8, 9/8 (ninths)<br><br>11/4 (the harmonic 11th)<br><br>The above ratios within an octave are used  in inversion as well (I<br>dont entirely accept the concept of interval inversion entirely, thus<br>the quotes).<br><br>On first hearing, my pieces sound similar to Easley Blackwoods Etudes.<br>They are fully notated, and I perform them on Clavette playing<br>synthesizer with setups which map one keystroke to one tone, like<br>traditional instrument performance--I dont trigger any sequences.<br><br>I have an interest in Balkan, Middle Eastern, and Indian musics, but<br>have not yet written any xenharmonic work along these lines, although I<br>do have a Japanese-influenced piece Ill take along.<br><br>I will bring pieces on cassette, CD, and my 36-minute Clavette video<br>documentary on VHS.  I will also bring earlier, freely atonal virtuoso<br>compositions on cassette and CD, including xenrhythmic work. And be<br>forewarned: I must admit to having a Ph.D. in music composition ;) :(<br><br>Im most interested in meeting other xenharmonicists who have built or<br>designed alternate keyboards or other instruments;  and those<br>composers/improvisers/performers/ theorists with related concerns.<br><br>For now, the only thing scheduled is to visit Starr Labs in San Diego on<br>Wed. the 18th.<br>Id like to see if I could meet with San Diego xenharmonicists that<br>evening or perhaps on the 19th. <br><br>I expect to be in the Los Angeles vicinity from the 19th or 20th through<br>Mon. the 23rd.<br><br>If youd like to meet, please send me your address, phone, website, and<br>the dates and times you are available.<br><br>Best wishes from microtonal Minneapolis,<br>Harold Fortuin<br>hfortuin@wavefront.com</div><h3><a id=8747 href="#8747">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/1998 3:58:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>(I realize that this is a tad off the subject for the tuning list, but<br>since there's a lot of musicians here...)<br><br>   I've always been told that one should start trills on the upper of the<br>two notes (i.e., the note above the notated note).  I think my bassoon<br>teacher back in high school first pointed that out to me.  It seems like<br>that's what I've always heard in recordings as well, but I'll have to do<br>some listening.<br><br>   But this past Saturday, my saxophone teacher, who is working on his<br>music PhD but is first and foremost a jazz man, said that he'd always heard<br>that you should start on the notated note.  Since trills are rather rare in<br>jazz, I at first racked it up to his background.  However, I looked at the<br>venerable Harvard Dictionary, and it said that that is a controversial<br>topic, or at least that it depends on the era the music is from.<br><br>   I'm going to listen to some recordings to get some statistics along<br>those lines, but I'm curious:  what have you folks been told along those<br>lines?  Understand that I'm talking about true trills - not mordents and<br>such.<br><br>   Thanks!</div><h3><a id=8748 href="#8748">ðŸ”—</a>Johnny Reinhard &#x3C;reinhard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/1998 5:12:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Trills before the Romantic period start from the upper note.  After 1820,<br>it is permissiable to start the trill from the lower "written" note.  This<br>continues straight through the 20th century, thus including Jazz<br>tradition.  <br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br>Director<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music	<br>318 East 70th Street, Suite 5FW<br>New York, New York  10021  USA<br>(212)517-3550/fax (212) 517-5495<br>reinhard@idt.net<br>http://www.echonyc.com/~jhhl/AFMM</div>
