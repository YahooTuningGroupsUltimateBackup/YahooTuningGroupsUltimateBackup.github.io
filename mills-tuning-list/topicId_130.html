As Bosanquet<br>defined them, positive systems are regular cyclic systems whose<br>fifths are greater than 700 cents, hence the Pythagorean tuning<br>is a positive system. Defining positive fifths as those sharper than<br>3/2 is a common error, which I have been guilty myself on occasion.<br> <br>Secondly, Wuerschmidt defined constructing and defining intervals<br>somewhat differently than Brian alleges, though his definition is<br>very useful. According to Mandelbaum's dissertation (my principal<br>source for W), W's defining intervals are small intervals set to<br>zero size in defining an ET. In 12-tet, the syntonic comma and the<br>diesis are two such defining intervals. Constructing intervals,<br>on the other hand, are intervals set to 1 degree of the temperament.<br>Examples of such intervals in 12-tet are 16/15, 135/128, and 25/24.<br>Constructing intervals, therefore, are not the coordinate axes of<br>tonal lattices, but rather the melodic seconds of the JI scale<br>which is the acoustic justification for the ET. Different sets<br>of defining intervals lead to different sets of constructing <br>intervals and different scales to be mapped onto the ET <br>(or is it into?).<br> <br>Prof. Fokker used a concept identical to W's defining intervals<br>in his derivation of ET's as periodicity blocks in the 3x5 and<br>3 x 5 x7 tonal lattices. The number of tones in the ET is equal<br>to the absolute value of the determinant of the square matrix whose<br>rows are vectors whose elements are the exponents of the defining<br>intervals in the lattice. Two by two matrices are used for 2-D <br>lattices with obvious extensions to more harmonic factors.<br>For the 2- and 3-D cases, the ET's are equal to the cross and box<br>products of the vectors.<br> <br>--John<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 28 Oct 1995 22:27 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id GAA26264; Sat, 28 Oct 1995 06:27:50 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 28 Oct 1995 06:27:50 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9510281636.A22694-0100000@email.ir.miami.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
