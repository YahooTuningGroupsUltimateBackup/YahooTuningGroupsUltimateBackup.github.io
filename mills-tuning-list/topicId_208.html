But I had to wait until my<br>DAT deck came home to me from the shop, since it's on a DAT master.<br><br>   Well, at long last my DAT deck fiiiiiinally made it back from the shop.  <br><br>   I have copies out to Johnny Klonaris and Randy Winchester, because I know for<br>sure that they asked for copies.  Did/does anybody else want a copy?  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 2 Dec 1995 02:22 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id QAA13712; Fri, 1 Dec 1995 16:22:28 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 1 Dec 1995 16:22:28 -0800<br>Message-Id: <951202001803_71670.2576_HHB49-6@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2355 href="#2355">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/2/1995 10:20:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Neil's assessment that there is sadly little xenharmonic music out there of<br>the calibre of the great masters, reminds me of a celebrated event in Mozart's<br>life:  Early in Mozart's career, F.J. Haydn told Leopold Mozart (Wolfgang's<br>father), "I tell you that man is the greatest composer I know".  I'm reminded of<br>that because it was a case of two highly accomplished composers accepting that<br>they've been beat.  <br><br>   So one composer to another, I'm inclided to tell Neil that I have to agree<br>with his assessment - implicitly leaving both Neil's and my music out of that<br>league.  <br><br>   But I think it's also important to out that there's very little 12TET music<br>out there of that calibre either!  And a lot of the music that doesn't live up<br>to that sort of standard, is still worth listening to.  Louis Spohr's music<br>strikes me personally as being in that category - it's not up to the standards<br>of Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, or Brahms, but still it's good music.  <br><br>   And I enjoy listening to Neil's CD too.  It's certainly not at Bach's level<br>of genius, but it's lots of fun, and I think a very respectable accomplishment.<br><br><br>   And that brings me to a CD of wind serenades by Antonio Salieri.  Salieri,<br>even before the famous movie Amadeus, has been widely cited as a "bad" composer.<br>I have to disagree.  When I listen to it, I hear only a little that's just plain<br>bad.  As for the rest of it, it isn't so much that it's bad as much as that<br>there's not much about it that's particularly good.  It's just kind of "there".<br><br><br>   But I've come to the conclusion that even the great masters have their<br>all-out bad moments too!  Some of Beethoven's endings consist of little more<br>than banging out a simple progression of primary triads over and over and over.<br>At the end of his Eroica - perhaps one of the single most pivotal compositions<br>in the history of Western music, I sometimes find myself wanting to yell out,<br>"alright alright, just end it a'ready!".  <br><br>   So, to composers I say:  Take heart, keep the perspective as Neil said, and<br>keep working for improvement.  If something comes out effortlessly, ask why.  It<br>either means inspiration or lack of care.  Listen to your own music as if you<br>knew nothing about it, and try to follow the flow of intrigue through the music.<br>IS there one (or more), or is the music just sorta "there"?  Or rambling?  And<br>if there is a coherent line of intrigue, then does that line itself do something<br>intriguing?  <br><br>   And remember that even the great masters have SOME low points!  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 3 Dec 1995 18:01 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA03014; Sun, 3 Dec 1995 08:00:51 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 3 Dec 1995 08:00:51 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199512031558.XAA11778@hk.super.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
