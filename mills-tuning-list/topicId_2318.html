The first segment of the program was devoted<br>to various "special effects", which generated a lot of interest, right away.<br>After a round of aplause, I then began playing phrases from various melodies<br>rhat I have heard over the course of my life, including classical, oriental,<br>popular american and traditional Hawaiian and Italian melodies, in between<br>improvised episodes that explored the higher numbered segments of the<br>harmonic and subharmonic series. For a while, I was allowed to play some<br>quiet, sensitive stuff, but what they seemed to like most  was when I made<br>really loud building-shaking bass sounds that resembled body noises. In any<br>case, the entire performance was in just intonation and the audience loved it.<br><br><br><br>Best wishes,<br><br>Denny Genovese<br>Director<br><br>Southeast Just Intonation Center            sejic@afn.org<br>World Harmony Project Inc.<br>PO Box 15464                                http://www.afn.org/~sejic<br>Gainesville, FL 32604  USA<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net<br>Subject:  S.

As<br>I've said before, I can't agree with either: the interval of a<br>"quartertone" is sometimes correlated with a frequency ratio of<br>2^(1/24)/1, as in Vischnegradskij, but is more often left unspecified,<br>as with "semitone" and "tone". Like the latter it is a term belonging to<br>the phenomenal domain of pitch relations, rather than the acoustic<br>domain of frequency ratios (which is where the syntonic comma belongs,<br>as you appear to agree). There is no universal one-to-one mapping from<br>the domain of pitch relations to the range of frequency ratios;<br>sometimes such a mapping is specified (e.g. Ben Johnston) or implicit<br>(Vishnegradskij), sometimes the mapping is one-to-two (as in the tunings<br>c.1400 which incorporate both Pythagorean and quasi-just imperfect<br>consonances), but by far most often, the mapping from pitch relations to<br>frequency ratios is simply left open -- no single tuning system is<br>required for the realisation of a given score. Quarter-tone notation is<br>used freely and flexibly by many composers of non-keyboard based<br>instrumental music today, and their notation shares the functional<br>distinctions of semitone notation (i.e. signs for both 1/4-tone sharp<br>and 3/4-tone flat are employed, and likewise 1/4-tone flat and 3/4-tone<br>sharp). Are we to say that all string-quartet composers, from Barto'k to<br>Ferneyhough, who have used quartertone notation were demanding a strict<br>12TET environment for their quartertones? Any case you construct for<br>mapping quartertones to 50 cents will also map semitones to 100 cents<br>and so on, but the term "semitone" has generally been used without any<br>such specification in mind -- indeed it was used freely by many<br>mediaeval theorists who explicitly discounted the bisection of the tone;<br>for them, semitone, was an umbrella term for limmas and apotomes.<br><br>Jonathan Walker<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  non12@deltanet.com<br>Subject:  Info sought on recordings<br>PostedDate:  16-08-97 21:13:12<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  16-08-97 21:13:18-16-08-97 21:13:19,16-08-97 21:11:25-16-08-97 21:11:25<br>DeliveredDate:  16-08-97 21:11:25<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564F5.006992F6; Sat, 16 Aug 1997 21:13:09 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA31973; Sat, 16 Aug 1997 21:13:12 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 16 Aug 1997 21:13:12 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA31971<br>Received: (qmail 7150 invoked from network); 16 Aug 1997 19:04:50 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 16 Aug 1997 19:04:50 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.96.970816115005.7606A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5990 href="#5990">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>8/19/1997 7:00:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>This is not what Paul seemed to be saying: he left the size of the tone<br>>open, but required that the quarter tones be genuine fourth roots.<br><br>   Meaning that it could be a quarter of a 9:8, for example?<br><br>   I personally see a lot of value in there being a well-understood,<br>compact term for intervals of 50 and 100 cents.
