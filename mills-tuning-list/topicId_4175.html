I'm struck by the fact that Margo,<br>as well as the others who contributed to the<br>discussion, "discovered" this: that 3-limit<br>ratios, calculated out far enough, come close<br>enough to not only 5-limit ratios (which has<br>been known possibly for centuries and recognized<br>since Ellis), but even close enough to 7- and<br>higher-prime ratios, that they can possibly<br>allude to or substitute for each other.<br><br>My "discovery" of all sorts of commas, schismas,<br>and other small "anomalies" (Scott Wilkinson's<br>term) throughout the prime-number relationships<br>is what led me to be so bold as to intuit that,<br>for example, as far back as 1318 Marchetto of<br>Padua may have been trying to notate not only<br>5- but also 7-limit ratios that he could discern<br>by ear.<br><br>I see by the discussion of the septimal schisma<br>that this idea may not be as foreign to other<br>microtonally-informed theorists as I had<br>previously thought.  The idea is not just<br>incomprehsible to regular theorists steeped<br>in the 12-equal scale, but also seems absolutely<br>ludicrous to those who understand ratios but<br>have accepted historical theorizing (and bad<br>translations of same) without questioning it.<br>These theorists/ historians would say that it's<br>utter nonsense to think that European listeners<br>of the 1300s ever heard 7-limit ratios -- this<br>is barely around the time that these theorists<br>would begin to admit that the 5-limit could<br>have been in use.<br><br>I'm only a little sorry to bust that bubble <br>that surrounds European tuning history -- it<br>seems pretty likely to me that Marchetto _was_<br>describing 5- _and_ 7-limit usage in the 1300s,<br>and I'm convinced that 5-limit ratios have been<br>in more-or-less constant use in practice ever since<br>the time of Boethius (the 500s!) and possibly<br>even earlier than that, in Greece before the<br>Roman conquest (c. 200 AD).<br><br>This is but one reason why this Forum is so<br>important.  For so many years many microtonalists<br>have worked hard in complete or almost-complete<br>isolation, and so many important concepts have<br>been "discovered" over and over again.  That<br>disparate researchers keep stumbling upon these<br>same ideas tells me that there is much validity<br>in them, but an open discussion seems to me so<br>much more fruitful, especially as it gives the<br>opportunity for those with different views to<br>call these assertions, or even speculations, into<br>question, and offers those who have access to<br>information that may be denied the single researcher<br>the opportunity to publicly post it.<br><br>(Stay "tuned" to my website for the appearance<br>of the Marchetto article -- hopefully this week)<br><br>- Joe Monzo<br>  monz@juno.com<br>  http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html<br><br>___________________________________________________________________<br>You don't need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html<br>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</div><h3><a id=8796 href="#8796">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/12/1998 10:08:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Thu, 12 Nov 1998 Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl wrote:<br>> I compared it with my scale archive, but found nothing close to it.<br>> That's not really surprising since well-temperaments with pure fifths<br>> and a few flattened ones [snip]<br><br>I _also_ note that the original message (which I can't seem to lay hands<br>on right now) described most of the fifths not as just, but<br>undertempered even for ET, about 1 cent as I recall.
