Szanto&#x22; &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/1996 11:13:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Just wanted to add a little addendum as the comments come in, regarding<br>hearing the concert here in San Diego.<br><br>To Neil: Neil, don't mistake my comments as simply disparaging the<br>technical performance aspect of the players, which was, for the most part,<br>not the problem.  Just being a monster player, with "kick ass chops",<br>doesn't guarantee a great evening.  Even you must have wanted to strangle<br>some of those guitar-weenies who sit there going<br>"reedle-ee-reedle-ee-reedle-ee" (as a substitute for a single musical lick)<br>for hours on end.  Chops are only one facet.<br><br>To Will, who remarked:<br>>This seems harsh to Cage, who would probably have<br>>been bored, too, if you were.  I think he liked pudding<br>>just as much as the next guy.<br><br>It may have come off this way, which was not intended.  Knowing how much<br>disrespect Brian shows JC, I was only pointing out that his solo<br>performance had all the aural hallmarks of a chance piece, where something<br>would evolve (or not evolve) outside of any strict intentions of the<br>composer - quite the opposite of what BM intended, one would imagine.  I,<br>like you, appreciate many different disciplines, and am thankful Cage<br>graced us with his presance.<br><br>A last thought, in general: I wouldn't want people to leave this with the<br>impression that I don't appreciate improvisation - on the contrary.  From<br>very free-wheeling events like Sun Ra or The Art Ensemble of Chicago, to<br>anyone who has flourished in the vernerable art form of the blues,<br>improvisatory performs can be as transcendant as most any 'worked out'<br>composition.  They just need to have a reason for making those sounds, be<br>it the underpinning of a 12-bar blues format (or chord changes to<br>"Good-Bye, Pork Pie Hat") or a melding of musical thoughts between players<br>to create an organic whole.  Until a fabric, similar to a blues format, is<br>ingrained in a non-12TET playing field, these other-intonation improvs can<br>very easily fall into a randomized airing of intervals, with no compelling<br>reason to have switched from 12TET in the first place.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br>*------------------------------------------------------------------*<br> Jonathan M.
