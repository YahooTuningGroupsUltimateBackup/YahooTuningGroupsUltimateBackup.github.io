My 4 lectures (outlined in a previous post) <br>were written about in 2 papers and attended by the Freshman-Sophomore <br>music classes.<br><br>The students regularly surprised the faculty by their astute attention to <br>the issues discussed; by their willingness to "sing" aloud - <br>microtonally, of course; and expecially by the non-jazz improvisation by <br>8 students in their orchestral hall.<br><br>Reminding me somewhat of the openness I experienced in Denver during <br>MicroStock I, I found South Dakotans accepting microtonality at face <br>value.  The _Shrine to Music_ in Vermillion, SD has a huge building <br>devoted to musical instruments, proud of its Stradivarious violin and 2 <br>Strad guitars (10 string).

(There's probably more truth to this than just another tale....)<br><br>Kudos to Anthony Lis for encouraging this with his students (we worked<br>together in the S.D. Composers Forum years back).  Allen Strange and I<br>are likewise introducing so-called microtonal concepts to our 1st-semester<br>music systems class (no longer called "theory"); those students who are<br>aware of their world have no problem with these issues (alas, those<br>students who are among the walking comotose do not get it.....but then<br>they are not getting Mozart's sevenths resolving down by step either).<br><br>  --  Brian Belet<br>   (South Dakota raised, and proud of it  --  now surfing in California)<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 30 Sep 1996 21:19 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06493; Mon, 30 Sep 1996 20:19:32 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06644<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA12761; Mon, 30 Sep 1996 12:19:30 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 30 Sep 1996 12:19:30 -0700<br>Message-Id: <55960930191755/0005695065PK5EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
