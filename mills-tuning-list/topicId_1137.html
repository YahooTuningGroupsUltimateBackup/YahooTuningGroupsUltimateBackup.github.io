He lived in England when I met him but moved to Australia. <br>As far as I know, only four of these instruments were built. But it wins <br>the prize on quantity, as there were only three generalized-keyboard <br>Scalatrons built.<br><br>We certainly need a generalized keyboard driving MIDI or some equivalent. <br>These days this should not be hard to build. Does anyone have any <br>knowledge of the status of various attempts in their various stages?<br><br>Paul Rapoport<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 23:23 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00538; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 23:24:32 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00536<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id OAA19774; Mon, 11 Nov 1996 14:24:27 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 11 Nov 1996 14:24:27 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9611111706.A15727-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
