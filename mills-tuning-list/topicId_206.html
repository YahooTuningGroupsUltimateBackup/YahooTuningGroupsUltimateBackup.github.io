My intrests are leading me<br>more and more in some direction what I am not to sure but that always makes<br>me feel better sometimes. If any one could recommend a  starting point for<br>exploring this aspect of music ie books, recordings, and any thing else. I<br>have been searching the web. I am fortunate to have the time to exsplore my<br>composing again and would appreciate the help.

The guitar players all love the increased<br>> harmony available in the purer keys. ( actually, any key with less than 4<br>> accidentals). <br><br>   Just as a side note, for most keys with less than 4 accidentals, even<br>quarter-comma meantone (12 tone per octave that is) would probably work fairly<br>well.  <br><br>   I have had definite, but limited, exposure to well temperaments.  I<br>personally have come to the conclusion that the differences between most well<br>temperaments and 12TET are certainly significant, but ultimately not all THAT<br>big.  <br><br>   Then again, along with all of the other factors - timbre, musical style,<br>tempo, and others - there's another factor you need to consider in weighing<br>answers from tuning listers:  How wildly different from 12TET are the tunings<br>they've dealt with?  In my case, they've been pretty darned different.  <br><br>   To an American, Arabic and Eskimo culture seem pretty different, but to a<br>Martian the difference would seem real subtle!  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 1 Dec 1995 07:38 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA25510; Thu, 30 Nov 1995 21:38:03 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 30 Nov 1995 21:38:03 -0800<br>Message-Id: <951201053032_71670.2576_HHB46-7@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
