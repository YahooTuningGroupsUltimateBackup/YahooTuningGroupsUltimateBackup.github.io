The following quotes are from his book, "The Inner Nature of<br>Music and the Experience of Tone" (1983), An throposophic Press, Hudson,<br>NY. <br><br>"...If we compare our age with former times, we find our age characterized<br>in a specific way in relation to the musical element.  One can say that<br>our age occupies a position between two musical feelings [Empfindungen];<br>one such feeling it already has, th e other not yet.  The feeling that our<br>age has attained, at least to a considerable degree, is the feeling for<br>the interval of the third.  In history we can easily trace how the<br>transition from the feeling for the fifth to the third came about in the<br>worl d of musical feeling.  The feeling for the third is something new. <br>The other feeling that will come about but as yet does not exist in our<br>age is the feeling for the octave.  A true feeling for the octave actually<br>has not yet developed in humanity.  You will experience the difference<br>that exists in comparison to feelings for tone up to the seventh.  While<br>the seventh is still felt in relation to the prime, an entirely different<br>experience arises as soon as the octave appears.  One cannot actually<br>disting uish it any longer from the prime; it merges with the prime.  In<br>any case, the difference that exists for a fifth or a third is absent for<br>an octave.  Of course we do have a feeling for the octave, but this is not<br>yet the feeling that will be developed in time; in the future the feeling<br>for the octave will be something completely different and will one day be<br>able to deepen the musical experience tremendously.  Every time the octave<br>appears in a musical composition, man will have a feeling that I can only<br>describe with the words, "I have found my 'I' anew; I am uplifted in my<br>humanity by the feeling for the octave."  The particular words I use here<br>are not important; what is important is the feeling that is evoked. "(p.<br>47-8) <br><br>"If you could go back into the Atlantean age, you would find that the<br>music of that time, which had little similarity to today's music, was<br>arranged according to continuing sevenths; even the fifth was unknown.<br>This musical experience, which was based on an experience of the seventh<br>through the full range of octaves, always consisted of man feeling<br>completely transported [entruckt].  He felt free of his earthbound<br>existence and transported into another world in this experience of the<br>seventh.  At that time he could just as well have said, "I experience<br>music," as, "I feel myself in the spiritual world."  ...As the human being<br>wished to incarnate more deeply into his physical body and take possession<br>of it, the experience of the seventh became faintly painful. ...In the<br>course of time, the fifths began to be the pleasurable experience.  All<br>musical forms, however, in which the third and what we call c today are<br>excluded, were permeated with a measure of this transporting quality. Such<br>music made a person feel as if he were carried into a different element.<br>In the music of fifths [Quintenmusik], a human being felt lifted out of<br>himself. ...This transition to the experience of the third signifies at<br>the same time that man feels music in relation to his ow n physical<br>organization.  For the first time, man feels that he is an earthly being<br>when he plays music.  Formerly, when he experienced fifths, he would have<br>been inclined to say, "The angel in my being is beginning to play music.<br>The muse in me speaks."  "I sing" was not the appropriate expression.  It<br>became possible to say this only when the experience of the third emerged,<br>making the whole musical feeling an inward experience; the human being<br>then felt that he himself was singing." (p 51-2) <br><br>Anyone have any insight into the sources of this kind of thinking about music?<br><br>Bruce Kanzelmeyer<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 16 Apr 1997 19:10 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01312; Wed, 16 Apr 1997 19:10:10 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01310<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id KAA21375; Wed, 16 Apr 1997 10:08:35 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 16 Apr 1997 10:08:35 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.96.970415195523.25216A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
