We usually assume that some variety ofwell temperament was demanded. And yet, a later generation, that of Mozart<br>and Haydn, would be again satisfied with the key variety offered by<br>meantone. Clearly, this reflects well-known differences in musical style<br>and form, but it also suggests some of the factors in a given style and<br>form that lead to their exhaustion as well as the factors that seem to<br>transcend a given style and are useful to later generations. While Bach'scontrapuntal technique appeared to lead to a cul-de-sac of never-ending<br>modulations and would only be rediscovered in very different contexts (late<br>Beethoven, Schoenberg), Handel's use of key characteristics was extremelyinfluential upon immediately following generations - Mozart especially. And<br>as meantone was sufficient for most of Handel, it was also sufficient if<br>not essential, to Mozart.<br><br>The convention wisdom is that there was a meantone era, then an era of well<br>temperaments, and then 12tet. It is perhaps more useful to think of a<br>larger meantone era from which well temperaments branched off into a deadend, and then a separate emergence of equal temperament in the first halfof the 19th century, during which time, incidentally, accurate metronomesand watches with second hands - both useful in setting a temperament -<br>emerged as consumer products.
