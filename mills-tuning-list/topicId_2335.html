In linguistics, there is an<br>international phonetic alphabet, and linguists are able to identify<br>dozens of degrees of difference in the pronunciation of the letter "a",<br>for example.  Well, people around the world use different sized<br>intervals, whether we want to call them "whole tones", "half tones",<br>"fifths" or whatever.  What we need to do is join in an organized<br>endeavor to identify and name all the possible intervals that are<br>actually used by human beings.  Whom on this list would be interested in<br>embarking on such a project?  (My interest in what people actually<br>do--and have done historically--around the world betrays my training as<br>an ethnomusicologist; but isn't this what musicology or music theory in<br>general should build its theories on?).<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  stick@dnvr.uswest.net<br>Subject:  Silverman's JI dictionary<br>PostedDate:  21-08-97 20:36:09<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  21-08-97 20:36:11-21-08-97 20:36:12,21-08-97 20:34:06-21-08-97 20:34:06<br>DeliveredDate:  21-08-97 20:34:06<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564FA.00662F0A; Thu, 21 Aug 1997 20:36:07 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18495; Thu, 21 Aug 1997 20:36:09 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 21 Aug 1997 20:36:09 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18488<br>Received: (qmail 25551 invoked from network); 21 Aug 1997 18:30:43 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 21 Aug 1997 18:30:43 -0000<br>Message-Id: <33FBD8D6.3CDC@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6018 href="#6018">ðŸ”—</a>Glenn Engstrand &#x3C;touchles@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/1997 9:05:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Wed, 20 Aug 1997 22:57:42 -0700, Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net> =<br>said<br><br>>>Just got Adam Silverman's JI dictionary in the mail, and want to say=20<br>>>that he did a great job on it...I recommend it highly to anyone, like=20<br><br>I am looking for a good dictionary on JI on other tuning systems.
