"<br>><br>> [Gary Morrison]<br>> Frankly I wouldn't buy that. If the harmony makes clear<br>> that you're playing a vi chord, then its third is the tonic.<br>> That's built into the definition of diatonic triads.<br><br>Sure, but definitions are not music. I say let the<br>music make the definitions, not the reverse. Harmony<br>can "make clear" at least two different chords which<br>a simple diatonic analysis would be incapable of<br>distinguishing. This leaves the analyser with a false<br>dilemna of deciding which one is the correct chord.<br>Either is correct, depending on the harmonic context.<br>Here are the quickest progressions which get you to these<br>two distinct chords while keeping one or more common<br>tones between successive chords:<br><br>1/1 5/4 3/2  (major triad built on 1/1 root)<br>5/3 1/1 5/4  (minor triad on 5/3 root)<br><br>and<br><br>1/1 5/4 3/2  (major on 1/1)<br>3/2 15/8 9/8  (major on 3/2)<br>9/8 27/20 27/16  (minor on 9/8)<br>27/16 81/80 81/64  (minor on 27/16)<br><br>The first example sends us directly to the relative minor.<br>The second example leaves us in a place that is distant<br>from the original key and which sets up some tension to<br>be unwound on the way home. It's a shame that these two<br>chords are confounded by a diatonic assumption.<br><br>If you decide "there are only 7 notes, so I will only<br>use 7 notes", then you're going to have to use tuning<br>systems which purposely incorporate distributed errors<br>to consolidate (confound by single representation) the<br>many pitch classes which would normally result from<br>various (JI) root motions.<br><br>> If the harmony is ambiguous enough to confuse a leading<br>> tone with a tonic, then that would not fall within the<br>> realm of diatonic harmony.<br><br>If a diatonic analysis is crippled enough to confuse 81/80<br>with 1/1, then it doesn't fall within the realm of usefulness.<br><br>The wonderful ability of harmony to carry us into new areas<br>is hobbled by having to reuse pitches from a previous context.<br>As any jazz player knows, you "blow over the changes", you<br>don't just keep playing the same scale.<br><br>Matt Nathan<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 22 Feb 1997 16:06 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14643; Sat, 22 Feb 1997 16:06:52 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14648<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id HAA10363; Sat, 22 Feb 1997 07:05:03 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 22 Feb 1997 07:05:03 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B04627D97D76F.3733@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
