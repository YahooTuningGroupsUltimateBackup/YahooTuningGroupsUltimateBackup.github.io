Bob Lee has been very helpful to the list with his recent<br>postings, and it would be amazing to get more of the people here to take up<br>that beast also! A minor point regarding his last post:<br><br>>Partch's "surrogate kithara" is a steel guitar of sorts, but it is not<br>>played well in any of Partch's music.  If Patch had paid any attention to<br>>standard steel guitar techniques of his time, his string sounds could have<br>>been every bit as spactacular as his percussion.  Instead, he ended up with<br>>sound effects where there could have been legitimate string music (only my<br>>opinion, of course).<br><br>"of sorts" is quite true: the instrument originally begat itself for the<br>sole purpose of performing some kithara parts that were too awkward to be<br>played on the outer courses of strings on the kithara itself -- hence,<br>"surrogate". The SK received perhaps some of the least acoustical attention<br>of any of the instruments, and ended up having parts written for it that<br>crossed the line between stringed (with the pitch-bending bars/rods) and<br>percussive (played with felted sticks).<br><br>No doubt with more resources the SK could have been more elegant; his<br>writing for what I would consider "lap guitar" is much more subtle and<br>reminiscent of pedal steel, and the "Eleven Intrusions" contain a good bit<br>of this. One other item is to note that Newband commissioned a newer SK to<br>be built (by an actual luthier, I believe) and though I haven't heard it in<br>person it could hardly be worse then the old one.<br><br>But Bob, answer me this: the SK was on a tripod stand with wheels, and when<br>you sat to play you could scurry all across the stage while executing the<br>part -- can this be done on any production model pedal steels?  :)<br><br>Best wishes to all for a happy solstice festivity of your choice!<br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br>*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*<br> Jonathan M.
