First, I'd say there is a great deal of <br>humanity and passion in Schoenberg's serial music. Also, complexity may <br>not have as much to do with the issue as it seems, because at least so <br>far as I know, there are no measures of it in music.<br><br>And, to go out on a limb--so far out that Neil may be sharpening his<br>saw--I will say that for me, classical music is what I want to hear most. <br>In some aspects I think that it is often superior--in some aspects only.<br>BUT that is my upbringing and preference only; it does not invalidate<br>others' preferences and abilities, and it is not absolute.  Classical<br>music is also not what I listen to 100% of the time, and I have been<br>vigorous in my support of other music. For Neil and others are surely<br>right that the division into kinds of music, flaky at times, has in any<br>case nothing to do with quality or importance. <br><br>Inherently I don't deal with things that are in any sense popular, but <br>that is my choice. Xenharmonics certainly fit that choice and probably <br>always will, even when Neil and others bring other tunings to the rest of <br>the world in the way that is certainly most important--performance.<br><br>==========================      =================================<br>Dr. Paul Rapoport               e-mail:	rapoport@mcmaster.ca<br>SADM (Music)	                   tel: (+1) 905 529 7070, ext. 2 4217<br>McMaster University                fax: (+1) 905 527 6793<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 31 Jul 1996 21:07 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA27656; Wed, 31 Jul 1996 12:07:54 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 31 Jul 1996 12:07:54 -0700<br>Message-Id: <2.2.32.19960731190613.00677328@adnc.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3356 href="#3356">ðŸ”—</a>MESSAGE AGENT &#x3C;jpff@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/31/1996 12:11:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>This is an automatic reply.
