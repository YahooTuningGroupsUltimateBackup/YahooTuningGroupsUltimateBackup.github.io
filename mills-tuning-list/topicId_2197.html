Mean Temperament has two general meanings. First it means a<br>system of<br>> tuning by fifths such that four ascending fifths and two descending<br>> octaves make up a perfect third. It also means any one of many<br>slight<br>> variations about this basic system.<br>> 4. Bach's WTC refers to a mean tempered clavichord; in particular,<br>> well-tempered means mean tempered. Since the WTC starts in the key<br>of C,<br>> it seems that Bach's thought of mean tempered in terms of ascending<br>> fifths started on C.<br><br>Regarding the scheme (if I understand it right) of up four fifths and<br>down two ocataves will give a pure third.  <br><br>Using the notation that middle C c'   and tuning from the octave<br>below, or c Tuning this on a piano gives a c - e  third that beats<br>sharp by more than 5 beats per second, more like 7 or 8.  After<br>trying two or three times and erring on the flat side for fifth going<br>up and sharp octaves comming down, the c - e third was still sounded<br>faster than the rate prescribed for ET  or 5.1-- bps.  <br><br>To check against paper, using the ratio for the 5th or 3/2, or 1.5,<br>and using A220, (a)  for conveince, four fifths gives a frequency of<br>220*1.5^4 (as entered on the W95 calculator, OK so ^ is the x^y key)<br>or  1113.75.   So two octaves down or /4 gives 278.4375 for c# ' . <br>Hmm already that is sharper than 277.183 called for by ET. <br><br>Where one begns the temperament is all important and I believe as Ed<br>suggests that it should start from C, especially for the reason he<br>gives of WTC starting at C.  <br>	Continuing the temperament started above, the b fifth to e is tuned.<br> Here is is intersting to note that in the octaves e - e', d - d',<br>and c - c', all of the fourths and fifths sound pure, execpt f which<br>has not been tuned, so tuning f from c' and Bb from f gives the<br>diatonic scales in both C and F with pure fourths and fifths.  If one<br>keeps close to the circle of fifths as Ed mentions, it would be<br>logical to tune the "flat keys" next, so from Bb tune up two octaves<br>to bb'  (I knew this notation system would be rough in ASCII), down a<br>fifth (eb') down a fifth (ab)  down a fifth (db).  octave up from db<br>(db' ) fifth down and here we are at gb and f # and the wolf is from<br>f # to B (fifth) and f # to b (fourth) The rests of the fourths and<br>fifths are as pure as the skill of the tuner.  It is interesting to<br>hear the thirds some pure and some well.. nasty. <br><br>	This also can be quickly tuned from (for the sake of our piano tuner<br>members) <br>C3-G3-D3-A3-E3-B3-(F#4), Then C3-F3-Bb2-Eb3-Ab3-Db4-Gb4(/F#4) and the<br>octaves Gb4-G3, Eb4-E3, Db4-D3.  and the E and B octaves.  This I<br>believe might be the temperament that the variations are based.  To<br>get rid of the wolf, it would have to be spread out, which means<br>temper the fifths, or put in another place by tuning further into the<br>circle of fifths, or starting the temperament from another key. <br><br>Richard Moody  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 5 Jul 1997 02:47 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05237; Sat, 5 Jul 1997 02:47:40 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 5 Jul 1997 02:47:40 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05210<br>Received: (qmail 16696 invoked from network); 5 Jul 1997 00:47:33 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 5 Jul 1997 00:47:33 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95.970704202257.2286A-100000@rodan.syr.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5758 href="#5758">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>7/5/1997 12:21:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>And yet, a later generation, that of Mozart<br>>and Haydn, would be again satisfied with the key variety offered by<br>>meantone.<br><br>   They never actually used meantone though, right?<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 5 Jul 1997 23:19 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05246; Sat, 5 Jul 1997 23:19:45 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 5 Jul 1997 23:19:45 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05358<br>Received: (qmail 18280 invoked from network); 5 Jul 1997 21:19:21 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 5 Jul 1997 21:19:21 -0000<br>Message-Id: <970705171747_1178805111@emout08.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
