Szanto&#x22; &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/1997 1:34:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>[I'm assuming interested parties have already set their<br>'from="szanto"--->trash' filters to the *ON* position]<br><br>Well, this has developed far beyond the pop model. Kind of scary.<br><br>Nonetheless, potentially worth a little bandwidth, since most all<br>subscribed herein are involved with tuning in a some musical fashion. And<br>if you are a visible entity, your thoughts are worth examining critically.<br><br>>Of course, most on this list understand that my philosophy of microtonal<br>>music is cross-cultural based.  From this yardstick, _all_ music is<br>>considered microtonal, past and present.  Understandably, not everyone is<br>>as catholic in their take on the intonational pie.<br><br>Daniel Wolf handled this admirably. A yardstick that can no longer measure<br>has certainly ceased to function as intended (when is a yardstick not a<br>yardstick?).<br><br>>As far as microtones in pop being out of tune, or irregular, or accidents,<br>>I think this condition exists quite rarely if at all.  The days of<br>>microtones being "out-of-tune" notes I thought had passed.<br><br>What's that expression..."get real"? If a singer in a cover band is 50<br>cents flat to the pitch on his/her rendition of "Feelings", it IS NOT<br>intentional microtonality -- it's plain, inept 'out-of-tune'-ality. To<br>ignore this is an ivory-tower view of unprecendented opaqueness, and also<br>raises a dark spectre: if acceptance of all the variants of 'out-of-tune'<br>performance are merely lumped in as broad-based microtonality, then how on<br>Earth do you come up with performance standards?  This implies, by default,<br>that bad or poorly executed intonation is impossible, even in microtonal<br>music, such as JI or other ET's! What now: "Close enough for jazz", to coin<br>an old phrase?<br><br>I know Johnny referred to Pink Floyd when citing microtonal performers; he<br>asserts that these aren't "accidents". If I may expand, I would posit that<br>the tempo fluxuations coming from Nick (drummer) weren't intended, that he<br>was never known for having a particularly solid 'pocket'. I would never<br>propose that the group was either micro- or poly- metric/rhythmic. But<br>that's me.<br><br>>Answer:  if you perceive it as art, it is art.<br><br>While I realize this is a very philosophical outlook, it also completely<br>validates the "if you perceived it as in tune, it was in tune" model. I<br>don't know if I would want to hear an ensemble based on *that* particular<br>aesthetic.<br><br>>It is crucial to any discussion to define the terms being discussed.  To<br>>that end I wrote a paper titled _Phenomenology and Its Application to<br>>Microtonality_ while a graduate student in ethnomusicolgoy.<br><br>Which, of course, sent me out on a search for information on phenomenology,<br>Edmund Husserl and calls to my more philo-centric colleagues and contacts.<br>While at polar extremes from being an expert, I have an idea of where<br>Johnny is coming from now.<br><br>>Meanings of words evolve.<br>>"Microtone" by itself may not have any utility.  It is vague and signifies<br>>insignificance by itself.  IMHO.<br><br>Then, for anyone involved in the ongoing growth and evolution of a subject<br>area, it would seem not only valuable but imperitive to re-define terms, in<br>an effort to sustain a dialog and investigation of that very subject<br>matter. There is certainly no harm, and much good, that can come from<br>application of intellectual rigor in a case such as this, especially when<br>"It is crucial to any discussion to define the terms being discussed."<br>Bailing out is unhelpful. IMHO.<br><br>>A discipline of Microtonality, which I adhere to, would include the<br>>commonality of all musics from the perspecitive of pitch and their<br>>intervallic relationships.<br><br>I find it difficult, if not impossible, to see how this defines<br>Microtonality; it would seem to be all-inclusive, with the possible<br>exception of non-pitch oriented musics. It would even, at face reading,<br>appear to include 12TET.<br><br>I'm dense: what's the point?<br><br>I have not quoted Johnny's references to the Harvard Dictionary of Music,<br>because to hold up incorrect, dated, or superceded examples/models is a<br>rather weak way of postulating an alternative model. Baby with the bath<br>water, or some such thing...<br><br>Sooooooooooooooooooooo: what is microtonal music? Maybe it's all been about<br>chasing our tail, and could have easily been boiled down to "non-12TET<br>musics".  I just don't think *everything* is microtonal. It has to be more<br>than a casual happenstance, at least on some level.<br><br>I only hope Johnny would think about this a bit more, seeing as he has a<br>somewhat higher-profile-than-most role in the future and development of<br>non-12TET musics. It *can't* be, as previously stated, the "American<br>Festival of All Musics".<br><br>Well, it could be, I suppose, but then the AFMM would be just like everyone<br>else, and we wouldn't want that. Besides, if it wasn't Microtonal Music, I<br>would lose all the good feelings I get from advertising the concert series<br>on my web site!!<br><br>Stay in tune, folks; looking forward to that tape.....<br><br>Cheers,<br>Jon<br>*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*<br> Jonathan M.
