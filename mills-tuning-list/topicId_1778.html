V. Mathews, L. A. Roberts, and J. R. Pierce, "Four new scales based<br>on nonsuccessive-integer-ratio chords," Journal of the Acoustical<br>Society of America 75, S10(A) (1984).<br><br>Upon tracking down this reference at the library, I was dismayed to find<br>that it only refers to an abstract of a paper presented at the 107th<br>Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America.  I have been unsuccessful<br>so far in locating the complete paper.  Can someone on the list point me<br>to where I might find the full paper?  If anyone actually possesses this<br>paper, can you contact me directly about obtaining a photocopy of it?<br><br>Many thanks,<br>John<br><br>---<br>John G.

They got an ovation.<br><br>In another post in this thread, based on my statement: <br>>" If the substance of the universe, the aether, is taken as a<br>>medium then the speed of sound in the aether is what we know as light<br>>The aether is very high tensile stuff).
