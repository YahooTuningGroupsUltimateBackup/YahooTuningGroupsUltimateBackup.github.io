I can't tell which tuning(s) he uses, especially as I have not<br>heard a note of the disks. The extensive written notes seem to imply equal<br>temperament, but even this isn't clear. The evidence brought out for this<br>is the well-known fact that some of the pieces were transposed as little<br>(and therefore as far) as a semitone by Bach. <br><br>If this proves equal temperament, it's some kind of logic I don't yet get.<br>There are other arguments, many of which have appeared on this list. <br><br>I landed a copy of Huguette Dreyfus's Book 1 on Denon. The notes say she<br>is using Werckmeister 3 and then go on to say this is 12-note equal<br>temperament. I checked the original German, and yes, that's what the<br>writer claims. Anyhow, the playing is not always of the highest quality. <br><br>Of course, WTC is hardly the music to use extreme tunings on in the name<br>of historical authenticity (there may be other reasons). Anyone know what<br>Gilbert or Leonhardt uses?  When I asked Colin Tilney what he used, he<br>said he didn't know; he had just asked his tuner to set up something<br>reasonable. I suspect this may be the case with many (certainly not all)<br>performers. <br><br>Paul Rapoport<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 17 Oct 1996 05:28 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01895; Thu, 17 Oct 1996 05:30:37 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01898<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id UAA05582; Wed, 16 Oct 1996 20:30:35 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 16 Oct 1996 20:30:35 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199610170327.UAA28279@well.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
