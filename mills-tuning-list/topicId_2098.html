May 22, 1997<br><br>Ear Garden opened with the minimalist classic "In C" by <br>Terry Riley. This version was performed using instruments <br>that are plucked: guitar, viola, harpsichord and kanon <br>(zither). At times the music seemed bathed in the <br>reverberant space of St. Paul's chapel, at other times, <br>the room was heard more then the instruments. Probably <br>the best seat in the house would be on your back, on <br>the floor at the feet of the performers. The performance <br>was beautiful, the effect of the chapel was nice, but it<br>obscured the best efforts of the performers. <br><br>"In C in Just Intonation" was premered by the AFMM in 1988. <br><br>just intonation guitars - John Schneider and Wim Hoogewerf <br>kanon - Skip LaPlante <br>harpsichord - Rebecca Pechefsky <br>viola - Anastasia Solberg <br>pulse guitar - Steve Antonelli <br><br>Luc Marcel's Beach Glass microtonalness came from <br>harmonics and multiphonics on the bassoon and glissando's <br>on the strings. After the quiet moments of In C, Beach <br>Glass was almost deafening. In fact maybe<br>the strings over powered the bassoon. There was some <br>fellow standing between the bassoonist and I, waving <br>his arms about. Perhaps if I had a<br>better seat, I would have heard the performance better. <br><br>conductor - Charles Zacharie Bornstein <br>bassoon - Johnny Reinhard <br>violin - Tom Chiu <br>viola - Anastasia Solberg <br>cello - David Eggar <br><br>Enbellie by Iannis Xenakis for solo viola was characteristic <br>of the composer's music. In fact, this version was more <br>expressive then any I've heard before. Lot of hard bowing <br>close to the bridge gave a dry tone where the tortured <br>harmonics jumped out. A tortured lull in the storm?<br>Alternately then, quiet high notes. My references inform <br>me that this is quartertone tuning. <br><br>viola - Anastasia Solberg <br><br>Sophia Gubaidulina's Duo Sonata for 2 Bassoons showed <br>what a pair of bassoons can do. Quartertones, harmonic <br>tunings and multiphonics. Quite the opportunity for circular <br>breathing and the chords between the two horns were <br>heavenly. I don't think I've heard anything like it.<br>Gubaidulina's music never fails to surprise. <br><br>bassoons - Frank Morelli and Johnny Reinhard <br><br>                                                         <br><br>Johnny Reinhard's Odysseus Cello Concerto had it all. <br>Odyssus (David Eggar) and his soldiers wandered around <br>St. Paul's chapel for 30 to 40 min. During their travels they <br>discovered islands and strange beautiful instruments <br>in different tunings: polymicrotonality, Reinhard's term for<br>using more then one tuning. <br><br>     Where else can you see microtonalist guitarists John Schneider and<br>     Wim Hoogewerf kill a trombonist (Julie Josephson) with their<br>     guitars, tear off chunks and eat them? They offered some to<br>     Odysseus who politely refused with a shake of his head and a wave<br>     of the hand. <br><br>     Lotus Eater Island (blown winds) was in one balcony while Aiolius<br>     (bagpipes) was in another. <br><br>     Odysseus traveled to and from the underworld by sliding on his<br>     back across the floor under the piano. <br><br>     At one point, Odysseus played some walking bass while his band of<br>     soldiers improvised some swinging microtonal jazz. <br><br>     Two Sirens (Carol Flamm, Piera F. Paine) magically appeared in<br>     the pulpit and sang while a third (Christine Coppola) danced a<br>     wildly seductive dace to lure Odysseus. <br><br>     No doubt Scylla and Charibdis (Jon Catler, just intonation guitar<br>     and Eric Ross, therermin) scared Odysseus and his gang half to<br>     death. What a racket! <br><br>     There were many custom and/or rarely used instruments like 96<br>     tone equal temperament harp, shofar, psalteries, just intonation<br>     pedal steel guitar, large glass bowl in G, bansuri and shakuhachi<br>     flutes, ocarina, bagpipes, tarogato, theremin, and conch shells. <br><br>     Click here for a list of performers in the Odysseus Cello Concerto. <br><br>My picks: Enbellie, Duo Sonata for Two Bassoons and Odysseus. <br><br>Stay tuned for more... <br><br>db <br>5/27/97 <br><br>The first two parts of this review are at url:<br>www.virtulink.com/immp/jux/j_index.htm<br><br>Information about the American Festival of Microtonal Music:<br>www.echonyc.com/~jhhl/AFMM/ <br><br>From:	SMTP%"tuning@eartha.mills.edu" 29-MAY-1997 02:50:23.90<br>To:	manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl<br>CC:	<br>Subj:	Re: modes<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 29 May 1997 02:50 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03299; Thu, 29 May 1997 02:50:21 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 29 May 1997 02:50:21 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03297<br>Received: (qmail 12793 invoked from network); 29 May 1997 00:50:17 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 29 May 1997 00:50:17 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541104afb032af1969@[207.207.3.144]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=7234 href="#7234">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/1998 9:55:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Charles: The ancient Greek names for the heptatonic modes are correct<br>in your post.  To avoid accidentals, the key of C major is<br>used and the various modes occur as octave species in the order<br>Mixolydian (B-b), Lydian (C-c), Phrygian (D-d), Dorian (E-e),<br>Hypolydian (F-f), Hypophrygian (G-g), and Hypodorian (a-a').<br><br>The extinct Ionian mode was a G mode and the Aeolian and Locrian <br>were A modes, but it is not known how these differed from the HP <br>and HD modes. The Mixolydian was also called Hyperdorian and the <br>lower A mode (on the note Proslambanomenos) was called Hypermixolydian <br>and Hyperphrygian. (In Argos, it was outlawed because it had no ethos of<br>its own, but was merely a lower octave repetition of the Hypodorian.)<br><br>Greek music was based on a 15-tone two-octave gamut running in our <br>notation from A-a-a', to which an accidental b-flat was added to<br>illustrate modulation at the fourth. This system  could be taken<br>at various pitch levels (see below). The absolute pitch is not known <br>and may have been irrelevant in any case.<br><br>In musical practice, these modes were transposed so that the modal <br>patterns of all 7 species moved into the middle range of the two octave <br>system. Thus a system of pitch keys developed at roughly semitonal <br>intervals. These keys took the names of the modes and new names <br>(Hyperionian, etc.) were coined to complete  a set of 15 keys or TONOI. <br><br>The center of the system was also changed from Dorian (E)<br>to Hypolydian (F) and two series of names were applied (high<br>and low Dorian, etc.).<br><br>In the Middle Ages, confusion arose between the keys and the modes<br>and the order of the modal names was reversed. Schlesinger attributes<br>this error to Boethius. Later, other ecclesiastical names were invented<br>as musical practice changed. The plagal/authentic distinction <br>developed at that time.<br><br>To avoid confusion, one should always specify whether Greek or <br>ecclesiastical nomenclature is being used unless the context is<br>clear.<br><br>--John</div>
