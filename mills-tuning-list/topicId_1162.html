Hooked to a high speed network this stuff is awful<br>-- at home, it's intolerable.<br><br>However, I strongly emphasize that until the Internet becomes searchable<br>through author-provided keyword indices that are systematically defined<br>and gathered, which is many years away, most searches to be meaningful<br>must be combinations of important keywords and require some creative<br>searching.<br><br>I would suggest Digital's AltaVista.  You can get there either through<br>	http://www.altavista.digital.com<br>or get the "text only, advanced query" (my favorite -- death to<br>unnecessary graphics!) at<br>	http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=aq&text=yes<br><br>Choose your keywords carefully.  For example, the word "microtonality"<br>rarely shows up in that exact form in the TUNING list and cannot be a<br>good predictor of web page content left on its own.  When I select the<br>phrase<br>	microtonal near music and tuning<br>I receive 95 hits with a reasonable "goodness" density.  Yes, many of<br>the hits are themselves pointers to other sites (Mills college and the<br>South East Just Intonation center get frequent mention) and yes, the<br>search engines should do a better job on the final bit of formatting,<br>cleansing, and de-duplicating.  The phrase<br>	"Just Intonation" and music<br>gets 198 hits, a bit of a struggle but still manageable.<br><br>Finally, without filling up too much space, I'd recommend the<br>	http://www.justonic.com<br>site for a good summary of just intonation and microtonal music, and<br>their list of "other Just Intonation" sites.  The JI Network is linked<br>from here.  My biggest complaint about the Justonic site is lack of<br>prices and ordering information -- whatever it is they're selling sure<br>sounds good.  But that is another post for another time.  Anybody used<br>their products yet?<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 14 Nov 1996 16:12 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08815; Thu, 14 Nov 1996 16:13:38 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08825<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id HAA04144; Thu, 14 Nov 1996 07:13:35 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 14 Nov 1996 07:13:35 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961114150108_71670.2576_HHB71-15@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
