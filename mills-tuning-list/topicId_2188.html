This became clear to me during a discussion I had with<br>>Paul E. some time ago.  Thinking back over that, it seems to me<br>>that our differences of opinion on the subject of the length of<br>>LCM patterns was mostly due to different assumptions about ratio<br>>invariance.  I was assuming ratio invariance, he was not.  I'm<br>>still not absolutely clear on all this and would appreciate any<br>>comments.<br><br>I thought we had decided that our "differences of opinion" were simply<br>an error on your part. You were claiming that the LCM of a chord was<br>proportional to the pattern length of the chord. I pointed out that this<br>was only true under certain wild assumptions about the relative register<br>of the chords. For example, the major triad (4:5:6) and the minor triad<br>(10:12:15) both have an LCM of 60. For both chords, the pattern length<br>of the chord as a whole is that of the frequency represented by the<br>number 1. So in order to give both chords the same wavelength, you have<br>to play the minor triad an octave plus a major third higher than the<br>major triad. If you play them in the same register, the wavelength of<br>the minor triad is 10/4 2.5 times longer than that of the major triad.<br><br>The LCM was used by Euler to classify chords. The only physical<br>significance of the LCM is that it is the ratio of the lowest common<br>overtone to the highest common fundamental. This fundamental is a note<br>whose wavelength is the same as the pattern length of the chord as a<br>whole. So your attempt at equating the LCM with pattern length is<br>correct in general only if we assume all chords are built below the same<br>common overtone. In other words, it assumes that there is some note (say<br>2880Hz) which is the lowest common overtone of the notes within each and<br>every chord. Needless to say, that is a preposterous assumption (calling<br>it "ratio invariance" doesn't help). For example, adding the major third<br>to an open fifth increases the LCM from 6 to 60; in this case the<br>pattern length increases not by a factor of 10 but only by a factor of<br>2, since the lowest common overtone goes up by a factor of 5. Meanwhile,<br>adding a minor third to the fifth again increases the LCM from 6 to 60;<br>this time the pattern length increases by a factor of 5 and the lowest<br>common overtone goes up by a factor of 2.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 2 Jul 1997 20:27 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA27106; Wed, 2 Jul 1997 20:28:01 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 2 Jul 1997 20:28:01 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA27101<br>Received: (qmail 24388 invoked from network); 2 Jul 1997 18:27:14 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 2 Jul 1997 18:27:14 -0000<br>Message-Id: <memo.82798@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5745 href="#5745">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/4/1997 2:44:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Marion wrote:<br><br>''Gosh, I thought Pythagorus started the whole thing (at least in<br>the west) with his famous 3 limit.

The tradition is muddy enough, but<br>evidently Pythagoras (or better: the Pythagoreans) was (were) not workingwith a conscious ''limit'' of three, but with the hypothesis that the<br>numbers 1 and 2 alone yielded musically insufficient materials, and that<br>the addition of some number of factors of 3 would yield the rational<br>resources to construct the known scales. This is subtly but vitally<br>different from the notion of _limit_.<br><br>Although an obvious enough concept, the term _limit_ appears to be Partch's<br>innovation in musical terminology. His late romantic harmonic view was<br>based upon a ''stacked thirds'' model, frequently found in American theory<br>texts of the time, and used by Partch in terms of odd, not prime chordal<br>components. (Interestingly, Partch's viewpoint leads - to my ears - to a<br>better explaination of the lowered ninth (as the 17th) than the<br>conventional treatment as an ''altered tone''.) In view of Partch's<br>priority and importance, I think it is due respect to use ''limit'' as<br>''odd limit'' and explicitly say ''prime limit'' when that is the case.<br><br>The leading alternative to the limit classification is that of Euler, which<br>lists the set of generative factors. This has the advantage in that factors<br>left out in a given system that would otherwise be implied by a limit<br>labeling are not falsely incorporated. (Example: Sometimes I use the<br>Eikosany with (1,3,7,9,11,15) as factors in preference to (1,3,5,7,9,11);a<br>limit notation would not make the distinction clear).<br><br>This discussed really repeats a discussion from last fall (and probably<br>from earlier than that!).
