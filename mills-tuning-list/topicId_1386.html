What is a 5 limit (or any "n" limit for that<br>matter)? Is it a scale that only includes ratios with a 5 in numerator or<br>denominator? Is the highest prime 5 that any number in numerator or<br>denominator can be divided into?<br>He uses a scale as follows: 1/1   6/5   5/4   4/3   3/2   8/5   5/3   2/1<br>on page 109.<br>        What about 16/15. This ratio's numerator and denominator are<br>divisible by primes that are 5 or less. Does he choose his scale based on<br>what sounded good, on how close to just he could get?<br>        On page 110 he speaks of the coexistence of Major and Minor and<br>draws the first Tonality diamond in the book. Why do these major and minor<br>sounds (ie Otonalites and Utonalities) result. It seems like they just<br>appear out of thin air.<br>        What is a Numerary Nexus? His definition on page 72 is confusing to me.<br>        Sorry to bother you with these questions, but who else in the world<br>is there to turn to? Your standard music prof at "state" university?<br>I would appreciate any help you can give me.<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 16 Dec 1996 21:15 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05971; Mon, 16 Dec 1996 21:17:23 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05970<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA26892; Mon, 16 Dec 1996 12:17:16 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 16 Dec 1996 12:17:16 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612161516_MC1-D38-2D57@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
