But my point is that, if I understand the<br>idea correctly, the fact that the ... "projection" for lack of a better word ...<br>of the pythagorean comma in these tunings effectively becomes negative in size<br>is what is interesting about these tunings.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 8 Mar 1996 16:37 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA09365; Fri, 8 Mar 1996 07:36:36 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 8 Mar 1996 07:36:36 -0800<br>Message-Id: <9603081527.AA00371@zeus.ief-paris-sud.fr><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
