Anyone care to prove this, or find a<br>> counterexample?<br><br>Well, I can prove it, but it's not particularly elegant.  The rough<br>outlines of the proof go like this: eight just major triads have eight<br>1/1s, eight 3/2s, and eight 5/4s, or 24 members in all.  To get this out<br>of fewer actual pitches many pitches must serve as different members of<br>multiple triads.  No pitch can be a member of more than three different<br>major triads, and if you examine the geometry of scales in the<br>triangular lattice there must be at least three pitches in a scale that<br>each are members of only a single triad.  That leaves at most 9 pitches<br>to function as the other 21 members.  This requires at least three<br>pitches to serve triple duty (21 = 3 * 3 + 2 * 6), but the most<br>economical way (pitch-wise) to do that is this:<br><br>        .   .<br>      .   *   .<br>    .   *   *   .<br>      .   .   .<br><br>and that already uses up your twelve pitches and still only gets you<br>seven major triads.
