Of course he did not. The idea of irrational <br>> numbers was too repugnant to the ancient Greeks. Aristoxenus just <br>> described what he heard, and a different mathematical mindset may <br>> have led to different interpretations of his descriptions. As these <br>> descriptions were self-contradictory, it seems useless to try to <br>> figure out what Aristoxenus "actually meant" in mathematical terms; <br>> however, this didn't prevent ancient Greeks or 16th century <br>> theorists from doing just that.<br><br>I see what Paul means here, but I misinterpreted him to the extent <br>that I thought he himself subscribed to the view that Aristoxenus <br>implicitly described 12TET. However my misinterpretation ends there, <br>and there was much more to my reply. I'll explain why I'm not <br>satisfied with the above:<br><br>First, as Dan Wolf was quick to point out, the Greeks, from Pythagoras <br>onwards certainly did not despise/ignore/try to remain in ignorance of <br>irrational numbers. Prior to Pythagoras's theorem, they did indeed <br>hold to a theory of proportion which required, for example, that the <br>three sides of a right-angled triangle must always be rationally <br>related. Pythagoras showed that this was not a necessary truth, by <br>proving that the square root of 2 was irrational; since, for example, <br>if take each of the other two sides of an isoceles right-angled <br>triangle to be one unit in length, then by the theorem, then 2^(1/2) <br>is the length of the hypoteneuse, the proof that the latter bore no <br>rational relation to the other sides demolished the older Greek theory <br>of proportions. Here is the proof traditionally ascribed to Pythagoras <br>(I'll flesh it out considerably):<br><br>If 2^(1/2) is rational then we can express it in the form a/b, where a <br>and b are relatively prime integers (i.e. they have no common <br>denominator higher than 1). Every ratio of two integers can be reduced <br>to this canonical lowest form, so if 2^(1/2) is rational, it must also <br>be expressible in such a form. Thus since a/b 2^(1/2)<br><br>                         a (2^(1/2) * b<br><br>Squaring each side, we obtain<br><br>                          a^2 2(b^2)<br><br>If 2^(1/2) is indeed rational, then this equation must be soluble for <br>relatively prime integers a and b.<br><br>Now from the equation we see that since a^2 equals a multiple of 2, <br>a^2 must be even, and therefore a is itself even, i.e. there is a c <br>such that a 2c. Hence<br><br>                      4(c^2) 2(b^2).<br><br>Dividing both sides by two we obtain<br><br>                      2(c^2) b^2<br><br>But then b is also even, and so a and b are both divisible by 2. But <br>this is a contradiction, since a and b are relatively prime, and thus <br>have no common divisor higher than 1. Since there are no solutions to <br>the equation a^2 2(b^2) for any relatively prime integers a and b, <br>2^(1/2) cannot be expressed as such a ratio, a/b, and therefore <br>2^(1/2) is an irrational number.<br><br>This, of course, was only the beginning of the Greek exploration of <br>irrational numbers, and Dan has listed the most important instances of <br>later Greek mathematicians employing them. But it certainly marked the <br>end of the older Greek theory of proportions. Now if this proof of the <br>irrationality was provided by Pythagoras, or even if it originated <br>from among his followers, its provenance is considerably earlier than <br>Aristoxenus, and centuries earlier than Ptolemy.<br><br>It would seem, therefore that Paul cannot credibly call upon any <br>supposed Greek repugnance for irrational numbers in order to explain <br>why Greek mathematicians failed to interpret Aristoxenus in terms of <br>an equal division of the octave. If any such repugnance had existed, <br>it had been swept away before Aristoxenus, and ironically, by the very <br>Pythagorean school to which Paul would ascribe much of the blame.<br><br>Secondly, even given that the Greeks, post-Pythagoras, were perfectly <br>well able to conduct their mathematics in areas requiring irrational <br>numbers (I trust Paul is by now convinced of this), I would still <br>contend, contra Paul, that 2^(1/12) is not the irrational number that <br>would have suggested itself in any Greek attempt to revise <br>Aristoxenus. As I said yesterday, Aristoxenus's tunings are presented <br>as divisions specifically of the tetrachord, and not of the octave. If <br>Greek mathematicians or music theorists had wished to find an <br>equal-tempered re-interpretation of Aristoxenus, they would surely <br>have attempted to work out a division of the fourth, and not of the <br>octave. It was only because of the special status that Ptolemy <br>accorded the 2/1, five centuries after Aristoxenus, and his <br>characteristic presentation of Aristoxenus's divisions in the form of <br>an octave spanning the diezeugmenon and meson tetrachords, that we, <br>and Renaissance theorists before us, have forgotten the earlier <br>emphasis (in addition, of course, to our own notions of the primacy of <br>the octave). What any Greek revision of Aristoxenus would require then <br>is something like the model Cleonides derived (uncontroversially) from <br>Aristoxenus, of a fourth divided into 30 parts; our Greek <br>mathematician would then have to extract the 30th root of 4/3, which <br>would mean (for them) the cubic root of the fifth root of 2, divided <br>by the fifth root of the cubic root of the square root of 3, and then <br>try to measure this out for a monochord. Not a very attractive <br>proposition, especially when you have no method for extracting a fifth <br>root! <br><br>-- <br>Jonathan Walker<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 28 Feb 1997 00:27 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA32369; Fri, 28 Feb 1997 00:27:29 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA32421<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id PAA13440; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 15:25:17 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 27 Feb 1997 15:25:17 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199702272313.HAA01856@csnt1.cs.ust.hk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
