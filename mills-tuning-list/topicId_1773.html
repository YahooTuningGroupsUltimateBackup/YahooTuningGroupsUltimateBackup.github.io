Reviewers in <br>Guitar Player and Guitar Shop have been enthusiastic about the sound.<br><br>The BF Tuning system is a set of corrections to put 12-tet guitars <br>in better tune by moving the nut two millimeters nearer the bridge and<br>making small unspecified adjustments for each string. The point of<br>these corrections is primarily to compensate for the increase in string<br>tension due to stopping, particularly near the net, and secondarily<br>for the traditional fret placement according to the "Rule of 18."<br>I was somewhat surprised to learn that the "Rule of 18" is still<br>used as it virtually guarantees that the octave will be off by <br>about 12 cents (The frets are placed at successive distances of 17/18; <br>18/17 is about 99 cents.)<br><br>I've queried their rep David Marcus about applying it to non-12.<br>I would think the nut movement itself and a linear interpolation based <br>on the positions of the nearest 12-tet frets would work adequately, but <br>I don't know. <br><br>Buzz Feiten's email address is BuzzInTune@aol.com.  Apparently a number <br>of guitar repair shops and manufacturers, mostly in So. California, have <br>been licensed to use this system. <br><br>Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi published a set of complex and comprehensive<br>BASIC programs in his book "Principios de la Gama Dina'mica to fret <br>guitars to his 53-tone 1/9th skhisma system. I should think they <br>could be easily modified for any other tuning as well. <br><br>Mark Rankin also has a computer program to calculate fret positions,<br>but I don't know if it makes these types of corrections.<br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 4 Mar 1997 00:41 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03521; Tue, 4 Mar 1997 00:41:55 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03571<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id PAA01336; Mon, 3 Mar 1997 15:30:09 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 3 Mar 1997 15:30:09 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703032328.IAA22162@inetnif.niftyserve.or.jp><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
