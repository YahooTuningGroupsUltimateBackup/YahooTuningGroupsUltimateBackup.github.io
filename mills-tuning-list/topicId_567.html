Gary, maybe you should listen to it on a different <br>stereo system, this beating is not hard to hear. The lower note of the minor <br>third is about a middle d#, and a little calculation shows that the beat <br>frequency for a 22-tet minor third in this register is 2.5 Hz. Considering <br>that this was a Korg, the disrepancy is forgivable -- when the minor third <br>moves down a semitone, the beat frequency falls to just over 2 Hz. Another <br>clue that the piece is in 22 is the melodic division of the major third into <br>two almost-but-not-quite-equal parts, which is impossible in 19.<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 10 Jul 1996 23:05 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id OAA04641; Wed, 10 Jul 1996 14:05:54 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 10 Jul 1996 14:05:54 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960710140237.20783A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3232 href="#3232">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Ooops.  I meant to send this to the list, not just to Paul.  <br><br>   Actually, listening again to the opening chord, I hear something a little<br>different.  The opening minor-third chord is about 3 seconds long before the<br>first melody note enters.  There is some sort of square, on/off change (no<br>intermediary values) that occurs about once a second during that time.  During<br>that first second-long period, I hear something that sounds to me like a classic<br>beat, but it vanishes after that first second-long period.  <br><br>   But anyway, check out Bill Sethares' analysis below.<br><br>   By the way, it sounds different depending upon where and at what angle I<br>place my head within the room.  That beat during the first second-long period<br>seems almost inaudible when I have my head between the two speakers, but is<br>clearly audible when I have my head turned 90 degrees so that both speakers are<br>toward my left ear.  <br><br>   For you folks doing sample looping, that's something I've found to be very<br>valuable:  Don't declare a loop to be clean without moving and tilting your head<br>relative to the monitor speakers.  Some flaws in some rooms can easily be<br>rendered inaudible when your head is at one angle or another.  <br><br><br>--------------- Forwarded Message ---------------<br><br>From: 	Gary Morrison, 71670,2576<br>To: 	PAULE, INTERNET:ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com<br>Date: 	10 Jul 1996 , 7:16 PM<br><br>RE: 	Darreg Disc Error: track 3 mislabelled<br><br>> Not only does that minor third sound wide from just, but it also beats just <br>> under 3 times per second. Gary, maybe you should listen to it on a different <br>> stereo system, this beating is not hard to hear. <br><br>   I definitely heard something changing at the low-mid frequency range, at<br>about the rate you mentioned, but it didn't sound like a beat to me.  I say<br>"didn't" because of some results Bill Sethares came up with.  <br><br>   He did a mathematical analysis of a certain passage, and the frequencies<br>present drew two conclusions I found surprising:<br>1.  Two pitch changes in a chromatic run were 48 cents and 52 cents.  It seems<br>    likely therefore that it's not in 17, 19, nor 22, but in quartertones.  <br>2.  The timbre, despite its brightness, consisted of only of two partials an <br>    octave apart.  I don't recall what he said were the relative weights.  <br><br>   As for the beat, I suppose that that change we both hear could be a beat<br>after all.  The tone was bright enough that I expected it would have major wads<br>and wads of high-harmonic content, in which case the beats would sound like<br>typical phaser/flanger effect from a Tomita album.  It would be a horrendous<br>comb-filter sweep - FAR less subtle than that fluctuation you pointed out.  <br><br>   But knowing that the tone is really just a couple of partials (and apparently<br>low ones), then yes, that probably is exactly what such a waveform's beat would<br>sound like.  <br><br><br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Topic No. 4<br><br>Date: Thu, 11 Jul 1996 01:02:04 -0600<br>From: hyperpoodle@mail.sisna.com (Doren Garcia)<br>To: tuning<br>Subject: 11 tET mudtone bass guitar man<br>Message-ID: <v01510101ae09ef8a38f5@[205.218.46.34]><br><br>Tuners,<br><br>For some reason I failed to receive issue 774.

The ratios within each octave for this tuning are 7:7, 8:7, 9:7, 10:7,<br>11:7, 12:7, 13:7, and 14:7, obvious 7:7 being the unison and 14:7 being the<br>octave.  <br><br>   This is a tuning I've played with before, and I thought that Bill would very<br>good at using it in the way that I concluded would be best, after I used it in a<br>way I concluded to be less than ideal.  <br><br>   Bill tuned it up on his Kurzweil K2500 last night and found it rather<br>intimidating.  He likes to use the phrase "out of tune" because he knows that<br>that's inadequate to characterize a tuning except at a very high level.  <br><br>   Anyway, here are some suggestions I made to him that perhaps some of you<br>might want to consider playing with as well:<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>   Yesterday afternoon I wanted to expound further on how to use that 7-step<br>octave-repeating harmonic-series-based tuning.  You said that you weren't sure<br>how to use it, noting semijokingly that it sounded "pretty out-of-tune".  <br><br>   My responses to that are:<br>1.  Hey, no pain no gain!  <br>2.  Is that really any more disconcerting than the microtonal scale-step size<br>    phenomenon you like to tantalyze your audience with?  I'm refering to how <br>    you described 19 to Dave E. and me ... oh, probably 9 months back:  <br>    Tantalyzingly delaying an expected melodic resolution by approaching it in <br>    small microtonal steps.  Is the out-of-tune nature of this tuning really<br>    all that much more disconcerting?  And whether it is or not, is that a <br>    problem?  <br>3.  One thing you're really good at, and I'm not (yet) is music involving <br>    long, sustained tones with faster stuff, often repeated figures, dancing <br>    on top of the sustained chords.  This tuning, I suspect, is well-suited to <br>    that sort of thing:<br>  a.  You can build large chords will little chance of a clash in the minor-<br>      second/major seventh sense of the word, because the pitch relationships<br>      are very simple.  <br>  b.  There exists a semi-standard mixing engineer/artist's analogy of the<br>      sounds they mix to a three-dimensional space:  left/right stereo gives<br>      you the left-right dimension with high- vs. low-pitch suggests top-<br>      bottom and quiet- vs. loud-volume suggests far and close.   Combine<br>      that with the fact that each tone of the octave has a distinct color to <br>      it, and then play a musical, 3D version of ... Pollock was it?  - the <br>      fellow who first painted with squirt-guns).  <br>4.  What it's probably not good for is what I used it for on that tape I gave <br>    you early on, with the last three movements of a Symphonietta in that <br>    tuning.  In that case I tried to build classical structures - traditional<br>    instrumentation, forms, melodies - with nontraditional harmony.  Well, I<br>    concluded that what I did in that regard went reasonably well, but that <br>    that style is not what this tuning is built for.  <br>5.  Since when have you been concerned with audiences thinking your music <br>    weird?!</div>
