I<br>like to see meantone systems as 2-D even if octave equivalence is<br>assumed, since meantone systems are meant to approximate 5-limit JI.<br>Topologically, meantone tunings wrap the 5-limit plane onto an infinite<br>cylinder. I like to see ETs as having as many dimensions as odd factors<br>with which they are consistent. ETs consistent with the 5-limit wrap<br>said plane onto a torus. 22tET can be considered 5-dimensional because<br>it consistently represents all ratios of 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. If we allow<br>skipping of 13, we can add 15 and 17 and treat 22tET as a 7-dimensional<br>tuning! Of course, one doesn't need a very large portion of the lattice<br>to cover all 22 notes . . .<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 8 Jul 1997 19:22 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17964; Tue, 8 Jul 1997 19:23:15 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 8 Jul 1997 19:23:15 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA19468<br>Received: (qmail 10441 invoked from network); 8 Jul 1997 17:23:05 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 8 Jul 1997 17:23:05 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199707081320_MC2-1A72-8171@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5798 href="#5798">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/1997 12:15:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Wed, 9 Jul 1997, Graham Breed wrote:<br>>             So, it looks like I was thinking along the same lines<br>> as Fokker.
