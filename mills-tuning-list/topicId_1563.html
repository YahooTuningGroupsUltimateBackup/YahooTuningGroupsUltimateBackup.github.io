I've done this <br>experiment millions of times, blindfolded, and with a sustaining tone on my <br>synthesizer, using headphones, I always get 10:12:15:17. It would have been <br>nicer theoretically if I got 1/6:1/5:1/4:2/7, but no, 10:12:15:17 sounds <br>right, and 1/6:1/5:1/4:2/7 sounds wrong.<br><br>Tuning the strings of my acoustic guitar, assuming I already tuned a <br>10:12:15, I _do_ end up with 1/6:1/5:1/4:2/7. Amazing, but true. From a <br>theoretical standpoint, this chord minimizes beating between overtones, <br>while the 10:12:15:17 exhibits "fusion" or a blending into a single <br>sensation. Approching this latter chord slowly on the synthesizer, one hears <br>beating in the low frequencies gradually coming to a halt. This probably has <br>something to do with eliminating beating between the virtual pitch and the <br>difference tones. The latter are less pronounced on the acoustic guitar, <br>which is however rich in overtones.<br><br>It is these sorts of experiments that lead me to quarrel with Daniel Wolf <br>about his use of sine waves, which would invariably lead to the 10:12:15:17 <br>solution, and never to the subharmonic one.<br><br>Incidentally, there is another important tuning of the minor 6th chord, <br>6:7:9:10, but only in 12-equal is this the "same" chord.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 16 Jan 1997 19:13 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12507; Thu, 16 Jan 1997 11:21:52 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12445<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id CAA22448; Thu, 16 Jan 1997 02:21:47 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 16 Jan 1997 02:21:47 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701160521_MC2-F5B-3050@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
