The answer is to just send me your mailing address<br>that's all.  I'm not charging for it or anything like that.  <br><br>   Much of the music on the demo I expect to release on my up-coming CD, so all<br>I ask for it is that:  1) You don't copy it around too much (or claim it's your<br>own music obviously), and 2) If you have any comments on the nature or quality<br>of the music, I'd be delighted to hear them.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 3 Dec 1995 20:38 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id KAA05026; Sun, 3 Dec 1995 10:38:02 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 3 Dec 1995 10:38:02 -0800<br>Message-Id: <951203183430_71670.2576_HHB39-5@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2360 href="#2360">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/3/1995 6:22:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>  few composers today can say that they have mastered<br>> any non-12 tunings.  (If you have, congratulations!)  There's so much to be<br>> learned about it; entire worlds of possibilities exist.  <br><br>   Yes, I certainly agree.  Also, the more unusual the tuning the less you can<br>draw from centuries of exploration in traditional tunings, and the more you have<br>to make up for yourself.  <br><br>   As I've opined a couple of times before, we xenharmonic composers have to be<br>super(wo)men.  We have to derive the equivalent of centuries of theory, and then<br>write music that is enjoyable even if it weren't xenharmonic.  And we often also<br>have to perform our own music too because nobody else can play our weird<br>tunings.  It's just simply a tough job, no matter how you slice it.<br><br>   But there's certainly no point in giving up, because I've found it to be a<br>fun and rewarding task, despite the difficulty!  And we've seen some really<br>exciting success stories in recent times.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 4 Dec 1995 16:35 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id GAA13850; Mon, 4 Dec 1995 06:35:46 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 4 Dec 1995 06:35:46 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199512041539.KAA02370@cerberus.Ensoniq.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2362 href="#2362">ðŸ”—</a>reinhard@styx.ios.com (Johnny Reinhard)</h3><span>12/4/1995 3:20:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Where is the microtonal Beethoven? is a common enough complaint.

Despite the fact that there was no concept<br>> of "absolute pitch," he mastered improvisation regardless of intonation.  <br><br>   Far be it from me to question a truly excellent composer-performer-producer<br>like Johnny Reinhard, but I've never equated microtonality with anything as<br>general as mastering improvisation in absense of an agreed pitch standard.  It<br>seems like it has to be more specific than that, involving new musical sounds<br>stemming from fundamentally nontraditional pitch relationships.  I find it hard<br>to conceive of any nontraditional pitch relationships in Bach's work.  That<br>especially since, ever since Mendelsohn, Bach's music (the Chorales especially)<br>has been the very vehicle of teaching musical tradition.  <br><br>   I personally (and others I know as well) take the term "microtones" to be far<br>more specific than that:  a generalization of the concept that originally<br>emerged under the name "quartertones".  <br><br>   But I certainly don't claim to be a great authority on Music History.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 8 Dec 1995 06:55 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA00638; Thu, 7 Dec 1995 21:55:48 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 7 Dec 1995 21:55:48 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9512080004.A1882-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2374 href="#2374">ðŸ”—</a>Johnny Reinhard &#x3C;reinhard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/1995 9:55:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Gary is right to question why I tied improvisation to microtonality in <br>Bach.

No interval could be given <br>with authority to a musician unless he gave it.  To write music that <br>would favor the most advanced temperament schemes, and yet be fully <br>functional and aesthetically pleasing in alternatives and variations, <br>combined with the knowledge of his prowess in improvising to the point of <br>musical duels, leads me to believe that he was a great micrtonalist indeed.<br><br>He has the most microtonal title of any established composer (The <br>Well-tempered Clavier).
