Separate code is written for <br>   piece initialization, note-on, note-off (optional), and sample computation.<br><br>4) Each instrument is compiled as a separate C module and several modules can <br>   be linked together with the M4C library to form an orchestra.<br><br>5) Once the orchestra is compiled it is run with the score in the background<br>   to produce a sound file. The sound files can be NeXT, headerless short int,<br>   or headerless floating point.<br><br>6) ascii pseudo-music notation and score processor software is part of the <br>   package. A midi file preprocessor is avaiable.<br><br>A "class orchestra", consisting of 9 instruments, is set up for beginner use.<br>Its use is discussed in M4C_intro.txt in the m4c/doc directory.<br><br>With version 1.5 Music 4C includes unit generator functions for handling sound<br>files and doing reverberation. In addition, several example instruments are<br>given which illustrate FM modulation (1 and 2 carriers); additive synthesis<br>based on analysis files produced by SNDAN; ghost instruments for amplitude<br>control and reverberation; several examples of simple and complex<br>reverberation; some sample instruments; and a trumpet instrument which uses<br>Spectral Dynamic Synthesis.<br><br>To obtain a copy of Music 4C, login to m4cguest@cmp-nxt.music.uiuc.edu and<br>follow the instructions for ftp back to your machine. pw is same as the login<br>name. Then follow the simple instructions for installation.<br><br>*******************************************************************************<br>SNDAN is a Unix-based software package for spectral analysis, display,<br>modification, and synthesis of musical sounds. It uses EPS graphics for display<br>under X Windows or NextStep. Both fixed filter bank harmonic analysis with<br>arbitrary base frequency and tracking analysis with the possibility for pitch<br>detection and reduction to harmonics are available. Recently SNDAN's display<br>repertoire has been upgraded for improved 3D graphics. monan's 'pp' command now<br>allows arbitrary orientations of the 3D spectrum with optional hidden line<br>removal and color or grey scale. In addition, there is a 2D "spectrogram"<br>command, 'ftc', which uses color or grey scale to indicate amplitude.<br><br>Documentation for the various SNDAN commands are contained in the sndan/doc<br>subdirectory.<br><br>To obtain a copy of SNDAN, login to sndan@cmp-nxt.music.uiuc.edu and follow the<br>instructions for ftp back to your machine. pw is 'cnmat.12'.

In particular, not much beyond "yip, that there 53TET cut sure has a lot<br>of VERRRRRRY microtonal intervals alright".  I just kind a sat back and enjoyed<br>it.  <br><br>   But anyway, I just listened to the track Paul mentioned, and I think he's<br>right!  I suspect that it's 19TET though.  The final chord pretty much seems to<br>rule out 17.  But I think I'll have to ... "tenuously" I'll say ... disagree<br>with his assessment of the opening minor third.  I definitely know what he means<br>by it sounding a little "off", but I suspect that that's an aberation of the<br>carbon-arc-lamp brightness timbre of that particular Korg patch.  I suspect that<br>it's 19 because, unless I've gone deaf, I don't hear a shred of beating in it.<br>And with that much high-harmonic content I would expect it to sound like<br>phase-shift city if it were off by any appreciable amount from just.  <br><br>   It would not surprise me if, when Ivor recorded a bunch of 17-tone stuff on<br>that Korg, he tossed in something in 22 or 19 or whatever for comparison, and<br>didn't announce on the master that he'd changed tunings.  He was always<br>concerned with comparing tunings rather than sticking with any one, so his taped<br>letters to me were always switching off tunings.  <br><br>   I have this image of the man to come leaping out of his grave and announce to<br>the world, "Aha!  I was wondering when somebody would catch that!".  Of course<br>there's the minor detail that he was cremated, but hey, nothing else ever seemed<br>to stop him when he wanted to accomplish something!  <br><br>   But anyway, I'm pretty sure that Paul's right here, and I'd be curious<br>whether anybody else agrees.  Congrats, Paul!  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 4 Jul 1996 08:10 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id XAA10626; Wed, 3 Jul 1996 23:10:39 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 3 Jul 1996 23:10:39 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199607040608.AAA20396@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
