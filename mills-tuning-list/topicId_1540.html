I'm not an historian like<br>some participants on this list, but I doubt that a strong case could be<br>made for proving that back in the beginnings of human melody, the pitch set<br>determined the melodic choices rather than the other way around. You know <br>what I mean? I suspect that conceptions of fixed pitch sets are tied more <br>with the practicalities of instrument making than pure melodic thought. I<br>will not deny that "choosing pitches from a set" is now a popular method<br>for generating melody. I wish to move away from that and free melody (again?)<br>from the restrictions of pre-determined pitch sets. If you could sing, or<br>play any pitch on demand, what melodic inspiration might be enabled by this?<br>Extend that to harmony as well. <br><br>> ...I have written a (mostly) triadic piece where successive shifts of<br>> chromatic semitones, 36/35s, 49/48s, and a limma, adding up to a perfect<br>> fourth, have a certain melodic integrity, but only in 22-tet because all<br>> these intervals are represented by 55 cents! Any effect, no matter how<br>> unpleasant in isolation, can become beautiful if it becomes a basic,<br>> repeating structural element. Many in the avant-garde have noticed this.<br><br>I'm not sure quite what you mean, those 3 intervals don't add up to 4/3.<br>I'd like to hear your piece though. Is there any way I can?<br><br>Matt Nathan<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 13 Jan 1997 16:59 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04946; Mon, 13 Jan 1997 17:02:19 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04526<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA02342; Mon, 13 Jan 1997 08:02:16 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 13 Jan 1997 08:02:16 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701131053_MC2-F34-5C1E@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
