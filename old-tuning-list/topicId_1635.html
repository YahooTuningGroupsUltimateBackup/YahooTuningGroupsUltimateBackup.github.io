I am reacting to <br>Morrison's comments, which said something to the effect that Lucy angers <br>the just intonation folks because he believes that Lucytuning is the <br>ideal tuning system, and that small whole number ratios are seen as valid <br>insofar as they approximate Lucytuning (if I missed it here, please <br>correct me).<br>    Anyway, my point is this: the harmonic series, with it's infinite <br>series of relationships, is a part of the Creation. We did not invent <br>this system, and can only react to it in various ways. We can try to play <br>exactly within the framework of what is there, the ratios, or we can <br>change them, which gives us various temperaments. But, no matter which <br>way we deal with it, the 3/2 ratio IS a "perfect 5th"; the 5/4 IS a <br>"perfect 3rd"...these intervals have exact mathematical values which <br>definitely affect the way they sound when used in a musical context, and <br>no matter what we, as humans, think about the Harmonic Series, when we <br>deviate from it, we change a part of the Creation that is pure; what this <br>means, exactly, I'm not sure if we yet know. But, any tuning that changes <br>these basic, fundamental values, is less than perfect, to my way of <br>thinking.<br>    Now, I play equal temperaments, because I love chordal music with <br>lots of changes; we all know, in fact, that temperaments came about to <br>play just this kind of music. I love Bach, Bartok, Charlie Parker, etc.; <br>I also love the modal music of India, Arabia, Turkey, etc. My point, <br>basically, is this; once you deviate from the purity of the Harmonic <br>Series, don't go thinking that you've improved on what was already there. <br>To me, as much as I enjoy eq temperaments, I don't think for a moment <br>that I have invented something superior to the mystery of the HS; I know <br>that eq temps are a compromise that allows me to play the style of music <br>I like, and nothing more. Perhaps, someday, someone will come up with a <br>way to play Bach fugues in pure tunings (and I mean in a practical way, <br>not complex synthesizers that are only for a few); that would be neat. <br>But, I doubt if that will happen, so I will continue to alter my 5ths so <br>my 3rds sound better, etc.<br>    If Lucy thinks that his variation of the Harmonic Series is better   <br>than the real thing, then I do not understand his reasoning. Perhaps he <br>could put a post on the forum which will clarify things, to avoid any <br>misunderstandings. Again, I see all temperaments as a compromise, and in <br>no way superior to what already exists...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 7 Feb 1997 01:41 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA28550; Fri, 7 Feb 1997 01:41:44 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA28578<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id QAA14218; Thu, 6 Feb 1997 16:40:06 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 6 Feb 1997 16:40:06 -0800<br>Message-Id: <32FA7998.3883@ix.netcom.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>comments about Lucytuning</h1><h3><a id=4740 href="#4740">ðŸ”—</a>Aline Surman &#x3C;stick@dnvr.uswest.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/1997 1:34:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Haverstick here...a brief comment on Lucytuning.
