The fixed pitched instruments may be said<br>to approach a 7-equal tuning, but singers and instruments with variable<br>pitches sing or play distinctly Major or minor thirds, depending upon<br>position in the 5-tone scale in use. The basic scalar template is 1 2 3  5<br>6, the interval 1-3 is almost always "major" and the 3/5, 6/1ï¿½ intervals<br>are almost always minor. My sense is that the _inner melody_ of the music<br>is vocal, but that the fixed pitch instruments provide a framework for<br>transposition. (This is somewhat similar to what W. Carlos does, in using a<br>just tuning for synchronic structures and equal temperament for diachronic<br>structures; voices and variable pitched instruments in the Javanese gamelan<br>have a similar practice; come to think of it, Ivor Darreg built an electric<br>organ that did the same (making a virtue out of a design failure)).<br><br>Daniel Wolf  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 21 Sep 1996 14:19 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA23556; Sat, 21 Sep 1996 14:21:24 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA24203<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id FAA29351; Sat, 21 Sep 1996 05:21:22 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 21 Sep 1996 05:21:22 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.960921072107.15668A-100000@library><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3657 href="#3657">ðŸ”—</a>DreamtimeV@aol.com</h3><span>9/21/1996 12:30:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>g a r y :<br><br>Im wondering if the Bart Hopkins quote was from another mailinglist & if so,<br>which one?  or whether from private correspondence?<br><br>thanks<br><br>Miekal And<br>the driftless academy of botanical apparitions<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 21 Sep 1996 21:44 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08285; Sat, 21 Sep 1996 21:45:55 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09687<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA09654; Sat, 21 Sep 1996 12:45:53 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 21 Sep 1996 12:45:53 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9609211520.B23229-0100000@email.ir.miami.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Amplification, question, comment</h1><h3><a id=3654 href="#3654">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;106232.3266@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/1996 11:52:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Amplification.
