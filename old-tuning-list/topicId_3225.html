Some of my most powerfully-learned lessons<br>in ear-training have come from just humming and singing to myself while I<br>clean the house or drive to work.  Unlike practicing an instrument, you<br>don't have to spend any time taking your ears out of a case or cleaning<br>them out after you're done.  Well, I don't anyway!  And your ears are<br>always there when you want to try something out.<br><br>   So if an ear-training tool can be used during those few minutes here and<br>there, like while you're driving to work, exercising, working the garden,<br>or whatever, would be very valuable.<br><br><br><br>Solution: Ear-Training CDs<br>--------------------------<br><br>   In the words of a certain US ex-President, "let me make one thing<br>perfectly clear".  At least one person has interpreted "ear-training CD" to<br>mean an interactive computer CD-ROM-based presentation.  No, what I'm<br>talking about here is a bit less of a production than that, and it's not<br>really the sort of thing that I'd be likely to sell either.<br><br>   But being less of a production can good too, because without a great<br>deal of effort, you can taylor such a CD to your own particular interests<br>and needs.  Although I'll use my 88CET ear-training CDs as an example, my<br>main goal here is a much more general one:  I'd like to give you ideas for<br>what you can do on your own such CDs, to help you become fluent at your own<br>favorite tunings, and to give you the most practice on what you in<br>particular are weakest on.<br><br>   Or another way you can customize them is to your own vocal range.  That<br>might seem at first like a minor thing, but it makes a lot of difference!<br>It's especially important in sight-singing pitch accuracy.  After all, in<br>the microtonal realm, we're talking about much finer pitch distinctions<br>than in the 12TET world.  You need to get your pitch right in both<br>scenarios of course, but in the microtonal world, all of your mistakes have<br>potential microtonal meaning!<br><br>   And it makes an even bigger difference still with nonoctave tunings,<br>because singing up or down an octave to bring an answer tone into your<br>vocal range ultimately comes down to singing a note that's not even in the<br>tuning system!  For some simpler exercises you can say, "everything's just<br>down an octave from the answer on the tape", but for others, like when<br>you're fitting a note harmonically into a chord, you're pretty much giving<br>the wrong answer!</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>88CET Ear Training CDs, Part 2</h1><h3><a id=7281 href="#7281">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>3/22/1998 6:53:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Microtonal Ear Training:  How?<br>------------------------------<br><br>   Also in analogy with learning an instrument or many other things in<br>life, you'll have days where you can sing 7:6s, 11:9s, 9:7s, 7:4s, 11:6s,<br>and 15:7s all within a few cents, but other days when you can't seem to<br>stop confusing perfect fifths for perfect fourths!
