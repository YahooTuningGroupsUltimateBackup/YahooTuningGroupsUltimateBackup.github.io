Is this<br>really a problem?<br><br>> i don't like using pitch bend...the pitch bend affects all notes on that<br>> channel, meaning that you can really only do monophonic stuff.  yuck.<br><br>That depends on your software, of course.  With GM, you're<br>limited to 15 melodic notes per MIDI stream.  It's quite<br>possible to go beyond this, but I've never wanted to.<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk<br>Subject:  Re: missing fundamental<br>PostedDate:  20-09-97 16:45:41<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  20-09-97 16:45:31-20-09-97 16:45:32,20-09-97 16:44:42-20-09-97 16:44:42<br>DeliveredDate:  20-09-97 16:44:42<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256518.00510EA9; Sat, 20 Sep 1997 16:45:21 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01898; Sat, 20 Sep 1997 16:45:41 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 20 Sep 1997 16:45:41 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01896<br>Received: (qmail 29887 invoked from network); 20 Sep 1997 14:44:14 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 20 Sep 1997 14:44:14 -0000<br>Message-Id: <memo.558454@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6124 href="#6124">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>9/21/1997 10:08:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>>    You might be well-served to see how your "product plans" compare with<br>>> Marion McCoskey's "FasTrack" JI MIDI sequencer, or possibly even Justonic's<br>>> "Pitch Palette" software.
