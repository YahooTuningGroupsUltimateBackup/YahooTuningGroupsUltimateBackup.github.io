The initial ROMs on the early VFXs<br>had some bugs in the INTERPOLATE function:<br>prior to the ROM upgrade, my VFX produced some<br>extremely bizarre scales during INTERPOLATE<br>and EXTRAPOLATE.   Perhaps a ROM upgrade?<br>Steve Curtin can tell you how to find out the<br>ROM version--the procedure involves holding<br>down a number of buttons at once, can't <br>recall which ones.<br>Because the VFX has a 1.5625 cent resolution,<br>but shows intervals in cents, some equal <br>temperaments won't exhibit accumulated<br>roundoff error at the octave after INTERPOLATE<br>(i.e., the ETs which divide nearly evenly into 768)<br>while others will.  <br>As Steve Curtin points out, none of these minor<br>bugs are important.  At worst, you can simply<br>enter the octave scale step by step into the synth<br>and then press EXTRAPOLATE.<br>The VFX sounds to these old ears like one of the<br>most sonically luxuriant synthesizers available.<br>The original VFX and the VFX-SD sound even more<br>impressive to me than the later-generation TS-10/12.<br>The VFX is one of the great classic synths--in a <br>class with the Arp 2600, the Moog 90x modular,<br>the Prophet 5,  the Oberheim 4-voice, the DX-7,<br>the Synergy II+.<br>Steve Curtin is right on the money when he says<br>that Ensoniq makes the best-sounding fully<br>retunable wavetable synths.  Nothing else<br>compares with the VFX/TS-10 series. And not<br>only do these Ensoniq synths sound great, they've<br>got *multiple tuning tables.*  This is A HUGE<br>ADVANTAGE.  JI composers/performers, take note:<br>with the TS-10's 16 different tuning tables,<br>you can do a *lot* of just intonation modulation<br>with no trouble at all.<br>--<br>In a post nasty, brutish and short, a certain<br>forum subscriber claimed for the Nth time that since <br>Bang  On A Can now plays at Lincoln Center, this <br>somehow invalidates my criticism of the Alice Tully<br>Hall/Lincoln Center/Juilliard Conservatory 12-TET<br>mindset.  <br>Hello?<br>Was there a visit from the Brain Fairy?  Did someone<br>find a quarter under hi/r pillow and daylight shining<br>through both ears?<br>In fact Bang On A Can moved to Lincoln Center *very*<br>recently,  *despite* the vociferous protests of the<br>Mostly Mozart fans (who have found their programs<br>of moldy mediocre music suddenly curtailed). <br>For most of its life, the Bang On A Can festival<br>took place in grotty little clubs and dingy basements.<br>The  Bang On A Can concerts *only* moved to Lincoln<br>Center because of the overwhelming demand by<br>the hoi polloi who couldn't get into the SRO <br>concerts in grungy closet-sized "art galleries"<br> & basement "performance spaces."  <br>(Q: What do you call a bathroom in New York?  <br>A: Performance art space.)<br>Given the hostility of the Lincoln Center establishment,<br>Bang On A Can will likely vanish from Alice Tully<br>Hall any day now.  <br>Naturally this does not *in any way* invalidate my<br>criticism of the Alice Tully Hall/Lincoln Center/<br>Juilliard Conservatory 12-TET mindset.<br>The specimen of warped logic according to which my<br>posts on this subject were criticized is a classic case<br>of the reductive fallacy, equivalent to saying that because<br>a few Jews escaped Hitler's gas chambers, there<br>was no Holocaust.<br>Logic 101, anyone?<br>"All rocks are living organisms; <br>All animals are rocks;<br>Therefore...all animals are living organisms!"<br>Marvellous!  <br>Merely because one lone group which *sometimes*<br>plays microtonal music was forced into Lincoln<br>Center by popular demand does *not* mean that <br>Juilliard Conservatory has stopped brainwashing<br>its students into playing 12, always 12, only<br>12, forever 12.   <br>Merely because a few microtonalists sneak in the <br>back door of Alice Tully Hall does *not* mean that <br>the directors and concert managers and 99.99999+ of<br>the musical programs in Alice Tully Hall are no<br>longer  locked rigidly into 12, always 12, only 12, <br>forever 12. <br>Merely because three of Harry Partch's instruments<br>appeared once in one (count it, 1) composition by <br>Julia Wolfe at Lincoln Center does *not* mean that <br>all of the prestigious uptown music venues in New <br>York no longer freeze out microtonalists and no longer<br>concentrate with unholy fervor on music in<br>12, always 12, only 12, forever 12.<br>Ye gods.<br>Is that what passes for reasoning in college<br>nowadays?<br>I thought I'd heard it all when Brooke Shields chirped<br>"Smoking can kill you, and if you're killed you've lost<br>the most important part of your life," but the twisted <br>logic behind this kind of criticism is a new low.<br>A single black person escapes lynching, therefore<br>there's no oppression of blacks in the deep South...?<br>A handful of microtonalists sneak into Lincoln<br>Center, therefore there's no prejudice against<br>and systematic refusal to program non-12 music<br>throughout New York symphony halls...?<br>For sheer warped twists of bizarre illogic, this kind<br>of wacky reasoning takes first prize.  <br>As Molly Ivins has pointed out, instead of<br>making English the official language throughout <br>the U.S., we ought to make sanity the  official method <br>of reasoning. <br>A word to the wise, folks--the book "Clear Thinking" <br>was written by Hyman Ruchlis and published by <br>Prometheus Press in 1990.<br>Do us all a favor.  Pick up a copy.<br>--<br>In a similar vein, various people claim my critique <br>of the12-TET academic/symphonic/conservatory<br>mindset constitutes some sort of "conspiracy<br>theory" on my part.<br>A forum subscriber who need not be named has<br>for more than a year persistently and flagrantly<br>made this constant error in reasoning.<br>And so (since no one else seems to want to stand <br>up for clear thinking) as usual it's up to me to <br>expose the obvious fallacy.<br>There are two logical errors here.<br>The first is the conclusion that because a<br>pervasive and profoundly damaging mindset <br>exists throughout our culture, therefore some <br>sort of  "conspiracy" exists. <br>The latter does not necessarily follow from the<br>former.  <br>No "conspiracy" is required for a damaging<br>and ruthless and universally shared  mindset <br>to exist & flourish & oppress.  Think back a<br>moment to the early 60s, when all those<br>repulsive fat Southern sheriffs waddled up<br>to Northern news reporters while black people<br>were being lynched, shot, hosed, clubbed and<br>savaged with dogs for demanding equal rights<br>under the constitution.  The fat white Southern<br>sheriff would invariably tip back his hat,<br>stare at the reporter, and drawl, "What are you, <br>boyyyyy? Y'all some kinda CONSPIRACY THEORIST?<br>Ain't no CONSPIRACY down here, boyyyy.  We<br>all just good ole folks down heahhhh."<br>No evidence suggests that all southerners <br>met in weekly groups and asked eached other "Hey,<br>how can we oppress them niggers this week?"<br>A conspiracy was *unnecessary*...<br>Because white people in the deep south had a <br>*mindset* according to which black people<br>were inferior, dangerous, smelly, vicious,<br>and subhuman.  <br>And so the net effect was the same as though<br>there had been a conspiracy.  The net effect<br>was that black people were systematically<br>oppressed by white Southerners from 1865 until<br>1965.<br>This is the second logical error: confusing<br>cause with effect.   Simply because a presumed<br>cause is not present does not invalidate the<br>existence of an observed effect.  All it means<br>is that the presumed cause was wrongly<br>hypothesized.  It does not conjure out of<br>existence the observable and clearly obvious<br>effect.<br>Thus, simply because there is no "conspiracy"<br>among symphony directors and college<br>music teachers and conservatory teachers<br>does *NOT* mean that microtonalists aren't<br>systematically marginalized, oppressed,<br>denied recognition and refused performance<br>venues.  <br>Rather, this merely means that microtonalists<br>suffer from systematic prejudice and oppression<br>because of a pervasive mindset, rather than some<br>sort of conspiracy.<br>And so what?<br>C'mon, people...elementary logic here.  This isn't<br>quantum mechanics.  You can reason it out.<br>Does it matter AT ALL whether microtonalists<br>are being marginalized and denied recognition<br>because of a conspiracy, or because of a mindset,<br>or for some other exotic reason?<br>Who cares *why* it's happening?<br>The point is, IT'S HAPPENING.<br>The fact exists that microtonalists are systematically<br>refused space in music textbooks, systematically<br>refused time at concerts, systematically refused<br>performance opportunities, systematically refused,<br>denied, prevented, shut out, marginalized, excluded,<br> locked out, silenced.<br>Get a clue.  The *result* is what matters.  Not the<br>presumptive cause.<br>Ai caramba.  Don't they teach elementary logic in the<br>universities any more...?<br>The goal of higher education is supposed to be to<br>train people how to *think.*  In that case, we<br>might as well close all the universities tomorrow<br>and turn 'em into hot dog stands.  Because the goal is <br>*nowhere* in sight.<br>--<br>Some time back I stated that  "In the era of<br> wooden machines (viz., the piano, the harpsichord)<br> it would have been impossibly difficult &<br> expensive to build a 5-octave instrument with<br> 31 equal tones to the octave.  If such an instrument<br> could have been built, its keys would have been<br> too narrow to be fingered; and the instrument<br> itself would have been too mechanically complex<br> and too fragile to survive an actual performance."<br>-- mclaren<br>Manuel Op de Coul responded: "No no. More expensive yes, <br>impossible to build not and well playable. See my post of <br>13 aug. 1994..."  Manuel goes on to describe a harpsichord<br>with 6 manuals of 37 keys tuned in 31-TET and built<br>in 1796, for which Mozart wrote some little pieces.<br>While this is fascinating, the wretched lack of pictures<br>on the Internet (a crude stone-age communcations medium<br>*far* more low-tech than the letter, which at least allows<br>xeroxes of photographs to be included) puts me at a loss<br>here.<br>Manuel, how far are the key rows situated from one another <br>vertically?<br>Could, for instance, Beethoven's Hammerklavier sonata be<br>performed on it?  How about highly chromatic polyphonic<br>passages?  Could you play Bach's Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue<br>on this 1796 31-TET contraption?<br>How easily can 31-TET chromatic passages be performed? Or<br>is this keyboard you mentioned useful only for playing 12-out-of<br>31-TET?<br>My examination of the pre-Maudslay-lathe technology of the 1700s<br>tells me that exotic non-12 harpsichords/pianos/clavichords with<br>lots of keys had to be either [A] so complex that their wooden<br>key-actions wouldn't work for long without repair, or [B] due<br>to mechanical considerations, the keys were so awkwardly arranged<br>as to either prevent truly chromatic microtonal passages, or<br>performance of standard 12-TET works.<br>Any details you could give in this regard, Manuel, would be most<br>interesting.  (I mention Maudslay because of course his lathe,<br>invented in the 1840s, was the start of the modern machine<br>tool revolution and thus of the modern symphony orchestra,<br>whose instruments cannot be tuned accurately sans precision <br>machine tools. Since you're all scholars, you have of course<br>never heard of Henry Maudslay, nor has anyone mentioned or noticed<br>his importance to the growth of the modern symphony orchestra.)<br>--<br>The redoubtable Paul Erlich posted in digest 755:<br>"There is indeed a tonality diamond on p. 22 of `The Musician's <br>Arithmetic.' It gives cents values for all 16 seven-limit intervals, <br>transposed to within one octave. Of course, four of these intervals <br>are 0 cents. So Partch most likely did get the idea from Meyer, but <br>he rotated it 90 degrees counterclockwise." -- Paul Erlich<br>Erlich is one of the few members of this tuning forum to actually<br>show some gumption and study some references.  Most  of you<br>prefer to sit around with your fingers stuck in your noses, posting <br>trivial nitpicks on this or that item of minutia--rather than <br>getting  the "Exposition" did not admit undertones<br>as the source of intervals, and therefore it implies that<br>earlier drafts of the "Exposition" did not contain the<br>Tonality Diamond.<br>Because of the timing of the Meyer and Cowell books, either<br>one could have influenced Partch in his discovery of the<br>Tonality Diamond--or both.<br>The plot thickens because (as John Chalmers pointed out)<br>the Meyer text was published as a part of a special series<br>not available in most libraries.  Did Partch have access to<br>a library in which the Meyer text was available?<br>We don't know.<br>It seems impossible to determine which of the two<br>texts had most influence on Partch.  It does seem clear,<br>given Partch's redaction of his typewritten text of 1933,<br>that the idea of the Tonality Diamond was already present<br>in the back of his mind.  Thus both the Meyer and Cowell books<br>likely did not give him the idea directly, but rather served<br>as midwives to an inspiration already present and waiting<br>to be born. (My guess is that Partch read both books prior<br>to 1931, but this is only a guess.)<br>This is one among a number of new data presented in an<br>article titled "The Evolution of Harry Partch's Tuning <br>System."  Naturally, it will when published be treated<br>with the utmost contempt and disdain, and thus I look<br>forward to yet another important article never<br>being cited, never being mentioned, never being noticed.<br>Gosh.  What a surprise.  Folks, it's easy to tell who the<br>significant composers and theorists are in any generation--<br>they're the ones who are *never mentioned in the presitigious<br>journals*, *never cited in the music theory literature*, *never<br>heard*, *never acknowledged.*  Thus, the one composer most<br>completely rendered an Orwellian unperson by the musical<br>establishment of the 1950s-1970s (Harry Partch) is accurately <br>described by Kyle Gann in his latest Village Voice article <br>as "the central American composer" of the last half of the <br>20th century.<br>Naturally!<br>Typically!<br>Inevitably!<br>Is there a limit to human stupidity?  Is there some boundary<br>to human obtuseness?<br>Is not the most convincing proof of the existence of intelligent <br>life elsewhere in the universe the fact that none of it has tried<br>to contact us?<br>-- <br>Incidentally, those of you curious about the number of pitches<br>of an n by n Tonality Diamond need wonder no longer.  The<br>number of pitches is n^2 - n.   Thus, the 6 x 6 Tonality<br>Diamond has 36 - 6 = 29 essential utonal/otonal pitches.<br>Notice that this is *not* the same as giving the answer <br>to the question: "How many pitches are there in an n-limit<br>Tonality Diamond?"   This latter question cannot be<br>computed in closed form because specifying the limit<br>of the Diamond does not necessarily specify the number<br>of n by n rows/columns of the Diamond.<br>For example, a 17-limit Tonality Diamond could be <br>built from the generator row  3  5  7  11  13 1 7  and <br>the generator column  /3  /5  /7  /11 /13  /17.  <br>Buboth<br>utonalities and otonalities.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 10 Nov 1996 21:17 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02461; Sun, 10 Nov 1996 21:18:08 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03401<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA01065; Sun, 10 Nov 1996 12:18:05 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 10 Nov 1996 12:18:05 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9611101529.A14329-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>New Post from Brian</h1><h3><a id=3959 href="#3959">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/10/1996 11:41:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: miscellany<br>--<br>Paul Erlich's problems with his VFX-SD seem<br>vaguely similar to glitches in my VFX before<br>it was returned to the factory for a ROM <br>upgrade.

Or<br>is this keyboard you mentioned useful only for playing 12-out-of<br>31-TET?<br>My examination of the pre-Maudslay-lathe technology of the 1700s<br>tells me that exotic non-12 harpsichords/pianos/clavichords with<br>lots of keys had to be either [A] so complex that their wooden<br>key-actions wouldn't work for long without repair, or [B] due<br>to mechanical considerations, the keys were so awkwardly arranged<br>as to either prevent truly chromatic microtonal passages, or<br>performance of standard 12-TET works.<br>Any details you could give in this regard, Manuel, would be most<br>interesting.  (I mention Maudslay because of course his lathe,<br>invented in the 1840s, was the start of the modern machine<br>tool revolution and thus of the modern symphony orchestra,<br>whose instruments cannot be tuned accurately sans precision <br>machine tools. Since you're all scholars, you have of course<br>never heard of Henry Maudslay, nor has anyone mentioned or noticed<br>his importance to the growth of the modern symphony orchestra.)<br>--<br>The redoubtable Paul Erlich posted in digest 755:<br>"There is indeed a tonality diamond on p. 22 of `The Musician's <br>Arithmetic.' It gives cents values for all 16 seven-limit intervals, <br>transposed to within one octave. Of course, four of these intervals <br>are 0 cents. So Partch most likely did get the idea from Meyer, but <br>he rotated it 90 degrees counterclockwise." -- Paul Erlich<br>Erlich is one of the few members of this tuning forum to actually<br>show some gumption and study some references.  Most  of you<br>prefer to sit around with your fingers stuck in your noses, posting <br>trivial nitpicks on this or that item of minutia--rather than <br>getting  the "Exposition" did not admit undertones<br>as the source of intervals, and therefore it implies that<br>earlier drafts of the "Exposition" did not contain the<br>Tonality Diamond.<br>Because of the timing of the Meyer and Cowell books, either<br>one could have influenced Partch in his discovery of the<br>Tonality Diamond--or both.<br>The plot thickens because (as John Chalmers pointed out)<br>the Meyer text was published as a part of a special series<br>not available in most libraries.  Did Partch have access to<br>a library in which the Meyer text was available?<br>We don't know.<br>It seems impossible to determine which of the two<br>texts had most influence on Partch.  It does seem clear,<br>given Partch's redaction of his typewritten text of 1933,<br>that the idea of the Tonality Diamond was already present<br>in the back of his mind.  Thus both the Meyer and Cowell books<br>likely did not give him the idea directly, but rather served<br>as midwives to an inspiration already present and waiting<br>to be born. (My guess is that Partch read both books prior<br>to 1931, but this is only a guess.)<br>This is one among a number of new data presented in an<br>article titled "The Evolution of Harry Partch's Tuning <br>System."  Naturally, it will when published be treated<br>with the utmost contempt and disdain, and thus I look<br>forward to yet another important article never<br>being cited, never being mentioned, never being noticed.<br>Gosh.  What a surprise.  Folks, it's easy to tell who the<br>significant composers and theorists are in any generation--<br>they're the ones who are *never mentioned in the presitigious<br>journals*, *never cited in the music theory literature*, *never<br>heard*, *never acknowledged.*  Thus, the one composer most<br>completely rendered an Orwellian unperson by the musical<br>establishment of the 1950s-1970s (Harry Partch) is accurately <br>described by Kyle Gann in his latest Village Voice article <br>as "the central American composer" of the last half of the <br>20th century.<br>Naturally!<br>Typically!<br>Inevitably!<br>Is there a limit to human stupidity?  Is there some boundary<br>to human obtuseness?<br>Is not the most convincing proof of the existence of intelligent <br>life elsewhere in the universe the fact that none of it has tried<br>to contact us?<br>-- <br>Incidentally, those of you curious about the number of pitches<br>of an n by n Tonality Diamond need wonder no longer.  The<br>number of pitches is n^2 - n.   Thus, the 6 x 6 Tonality<br>Diamond has 36 - 6 = 29 essential utonal/otonal pitches.<br>Notice that this is *not* the same as giving the answer <br>to the question: "How many pitches are there in an n-limit<br>Tonality Diamond?"   This latter question cannot be<br>computed in closed form because specifying the limit<br>of the Diamond does not necessarily specify the number<br>of n by n rows/columns of the Diamond.<br>For example, a 17-limit Tonality Diamond could be <br>built from the generator row  3  5  7  11  13 1 7  and <br>the generator column  /3  /5  /7  /11 /13  /17.  <br>Buboth<br>utonalities and otonalities.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 10 Nov 1996 21:17 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02461; Sun, 10 Nov 1996 21:18:08 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03401<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA01065; Sun, 10 Nov 1996 12:18:05 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 10 Nov 1996 12:18:05 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9611101529.A14329-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
