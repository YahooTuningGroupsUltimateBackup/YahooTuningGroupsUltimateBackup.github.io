Result = same note.<br>* If you then move the slide up (or down) and continue to <br>strike both sides of the string, certain "nodes" emerge in <br>which with each side of the string harmonises, according to the <br>relationship - i.e. "perfect" third, fourth, fifth etc... <br>For example: if the string in question is a G, then going up <br>the neck towards the nut you will pass from:<br><br>unison (g)  | (g) - at the half-way length of the string, to:<br>octave (d') | (d) - at the third-way length of the string.<br><br>Although many of these nodes are the expected ones, plenty are <br>"out" of the standard "g" harmonic series. For example, the <br>minor 3rd is near enough a quarter-tone and the 7th is <br>decidedly skew.<br><br>Questions:<br>Maybe people have been going on abut this under some other <br>name, if so what is this sort of harmonic collection called? <br>What is the mathematics of this as a whole series? Are there <br>any proper big compositions & works in this field of, I suppose <br>I'd call it "bifurcative-JI"? Is it possible to play this in <br>yet another plane (i.e have not 2 but 3 floating sliding points <br>in the frequencu spectrum)? Is this a bit like what Brian <br>McLaren is talking about with rhythm?<br><br>2. <br>My second request is of a similar nature, but more practical <br>and applies to anyone who is interested in the visualisation of <br>fretless finger-stopping (as opposed to diagrams of music!), <br>who has a computer and means op generating waving nice wavy <br>patterns (sine, cosine will do). <br><br>I have this thing called a cï¿½mbï¿½s (that's pronounced jumbush <br>with puckered lips for the u umlauts). It's about the hardest <br>animal I ever encountered but essentially it is a 12-string <br>fretless banjo. The neck is bolt-on and the fingerboard is made <br>of (if you please) a formica strip.
