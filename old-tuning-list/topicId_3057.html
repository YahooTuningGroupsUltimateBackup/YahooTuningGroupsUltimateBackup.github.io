After doing 2 CD's of my own, I want to get involved in the production<br>end of things, and work helping other artists get projects out. I have a<br>number of ideas in mind, and the cash is really the only problem.<br>2. I really believe in non 12eq music, and want more of it to be heard.<br>Atadan's tape swap was a great idea, and was perhaps the seed for this<br>project. In the music industry, a CD is definitely the<br>standard...generally, you are not taken seriously by the media without<br>one. It is very difficult to get airplay, or reviews in the top<br>magazines, with only a cassette...which sucks, but it is true.<br>3. The arts is, again unfortunately, a name game...if they haven't heard<br>of you, you are not important. Thus, a compilation of<br>tuning@eartha.mills.edu music would put us on the map, so to speak, and<br>get industry folks to take a closer look at what we're up to.<br>4. The whole thing really boils down to this: I am deathly tired of 12eq<br>all the time, and want to change it's dominance in the world...a<br>difficult task, to be sure, but one must start at the beginning. There<br>really are a lot of talented folks on this list (and elsewhere), so let's<br>make a statement.<br>5. My involvement with this project is simple: send me your DAT's (and<br>$$$), and I'll do the grunt work, get a very nice looking/sounding<br>package together, and from there, anything can happen. I plan to send<br>mine to my media contacts, including folks like Kyle Gann, and try to get<br>them intrigued. Each participant can do what they wish with theirs,<br>including selling them. I also will try to get a few small distributors I<br>know to take it on.<br>6. All in all, this is a labor of love, so to speak, and as my friend<br>Mary Stribling says, "a CD is a high priced business card." Very<br>true...if we happen to hit the big number, and someone wants to do<br>something with the project, great...we'll deal with it. I have no<br>detailed intellectual plan for this thing, other than to get this music<br>out there.<br>    So, there it is...we now have 5 folks who are interested...5 more,<br>and we're there. Please post me privately to chat...this can be done very<br>easily and pretty quickly, once I have the materials in hand....Hstick<br>PS...someone asked if a non list member could be included...that is fine<br>with me, although I still want to call the CD  "tuning@eartha.mills.edu-a<br>compilation of microtonal music"...<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed) <br>Subject:  Tempering issues<br>PostedDate:  17-01-98 10:32:54<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  17-01-98 10:32:58-17-01-98 10:32:59,17-01-98 10:32:01-17-01-98 10:32:01<br>DeliveredDate:  17-01-98 10:32:01<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125658F.00347230; Sat, 17 Jan 1998 10:32:51 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22863; Sat, 17 Jan 1998 10:32:54 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 17 Jan 1998 10:32:54 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22904<br>Received: (qmail 22 invoked from network); 17 Jan 1998 01:32:51 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 17 Jan 1998 01:32:51 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.328746@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>forum CD project</h1><h3><a id=7047 href="#7047">ðŸ”—</a>Aline Surman &#x3C;stick@dnvr.uswest.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/1998 3:42:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I've received a number of private posts regarding this CD concept, so<br>I wanted to restate my basic concepts behind the idea...here goes:<br>1.
