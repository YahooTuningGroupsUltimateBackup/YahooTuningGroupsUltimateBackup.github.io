Each Harrison piece in these pairings did sound substantially<br>similar in style to one of the above composers, without suffering the<br>typical not-as-good-as-the-original problem. (In fact, I'd certainly rather<br>hear Harrison's Suite (1943) than Schoenberg's Suite Opus 19, although I<br>used to play the latter.) The Rondo in Harrison's Suite was particularly<br>good, and its Conductus movement anticipates the complexity of Boulez. The<br>Carl Ruggles Four Evocations was a particularly brilliant piece on the<br>program,<br>and the Harrison Triphony (1945) compares well.

Nevertheless, the rather static style of<br>these pieces, and many of their structural features were very close to those<br>of the traditional pieces.<br><br>The second half of the program included Triphony again, and Waltz for<br>Evelyn Hinrichsen both played by local pianist Mary Jo Payne, the<br>Air for Flute solo backed by synthesized drone, and Party Pieces for chamber<br>ensemble of piano and wind quintet. These latter were written from fragments<br>composed at some New York composers' parties in the 1940s.<br><br>Regrettably, there was none of Harrison's JI music so far this weekend.

It's some of the best of its kind, and I<br>think it's not<br>well-known across the Atlantic. Another such composer is Ruth Crawford<br>Seeger, whose<br>string quartet is hopefully known a bit, but whose other work is certainly<br>unjustly<br>neglected as well.<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 14 Apr 1997 06:21 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01134; Mon, 14 Apr 1997 06:21:38 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01132<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id VAA21008; Sun, 13 Apr 1997 21:19:57 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 13 Apr 1997 21:19:57 -0700<br>Message-Id: <3351B503.1D97@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Lou Harrison Concerts in Minneapolis</h1><h3><a id=5297 href="#5297">ðŸ”—</a>Harold Fortuin &#x3C;hfortuin@wavefront.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/1997 6:45:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Yes, Kris, there is at least one other tuning list subscriber in<br>Minneapolis--me.<br><br>Yes, it's too bad that one of us didn't post news about the Lou Harrison mini-<br>fest on this list earlier.<br><br>This weekend, I attended both the Boriskin piano recital and the concert<br>including the local Schubert Club gamelan orchestra and the Minneapolis<br>Contemporary Ensemble.<br><br>The Boriskin concert had no alternately tuned music, but did make<br>insightful pairings of pieces of Harrison with those of his teachers or<br>contemporaries including Henry Cowell, Schoenberg, Carl Ruggles, and<br>Virgil Thomson.
