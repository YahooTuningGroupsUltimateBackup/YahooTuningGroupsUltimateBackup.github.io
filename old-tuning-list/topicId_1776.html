When I was first instructed in the process of <br>> tuning, (1972), my tutor pointed out to me that the fifths leading up <br>> to the C-E third could be made a little "noisy" so that the key of C <br>>  would be the "nicest". This was in north Louisiana!!!!!  If the <br>> tradition of "key favoritism"  was still extant 25 years ago,  I <br>> really believe that in 1800, the practise was probably more<br>> widespread.<br><br>I like the anecdote, but tuning practices in Louisiana during the 1970s <br>will hardly serve as historical evidence for tuning practices between <br>1750 and 1800 in Germany and Austria. Again, I'll repeat that I have no <br>vested interest in the consensus view that ET had become the normal <br>keyboard tuning by 1800 in Germany/Austria; indeed I would receive any <br>documentary evidence to the contrary with enthusiasm. But I'm still <br>waiting ...<br><br>>       Comparing the ease of production between meantone and 12TET <br>> seems like a stretch.  Equal temperament is much more difficult. <br>> Meantone (1/4 comma Aaron) is so easy in comparison, that it's use <br>> doesn't mean that everything else followed as well, i.e.  tempering <br>> four fifths at better than 5 cents each is a lot easier than tuning 12 <br>> fifths at 1.95 each.  The scale of difficulty doesn't translate.<br><br>Two matters concerning 16th-century tuning practices in reply to this:<br>Firstly, you picked the easiest meantone to tune; 1/3-comma isn't so <br>much harder either, but what of the 2/7 and 2/9-comma temperaments, <br>which had some popularity during this period? These certainly aren't <br>such a dawdle.<br>Secondly, if ET was well-nigh impossible in the 18th century,  as you <br>argue, how come it was in popular use for lutes and viols during the <br>16th century? I mentioned this before, but you didn't address this. I'll <br>certainly grant that the differences between keyboard instruments and <br>fretted string instruments make it simpler for the latter, but this <br>hardly closes the gap on what you are arguing. I'm sure 16th-century <br>attempts at ET were not especially accurate, but equality was certainly <br>their stated intention.<br> <br>> Walker again;<br>> <snip><br>> >pronouncements Beethoven made, well into his career, upon key<br>> >characteristics, might seem to indicate his continuing preference for<br>> >and use of well-temperament (for as long as he could hear any<br>> >difference).

Do we know what <br>> he was talking about inre Db vs.C#?  I don't, and though it seems that <br>> from our point of modern view, there is no difference, was he talking <br>> about meantone? or was he talking about orchestral intonation, or <br>> singers?.  But his pronouncements upon key characteristics are easily <br>> understood when listening to his sonati in Well temperament.<br><br>I can't believe that I haven't made this point perfectly clear by now; <br>perhaps you should read what I've said more carefully. Distinguishing <br>between the NOTES Db and C# is not the same as distinguishing between <br>the KEYS Db major and C# major. But I'm not going to repeat all I've <br>said yet again; if you haven't time to read what I've already said on <br>this matter, then let's drop it.<br><br>>     What it comes down to when deciding performance practises is <br>> listening to the music, and making decisions.  It is easy to say that <br>> composers didn't write anything down about their preferences, but is <br>> that true?  Did they not write down the notes?  Is music a language or <br>> not?  If it is, then can it not tell us something about the composers <br>> intention? Extrapolation of temperament practise from composition is <br>> pretty thin stuff, I know,  but coupled with what documentation we <br>> have of the state of science, (ET is a scientific tuning), and <br>> demonstrated differences in the sound of say, the "Pathetique" <br>> performed on Well temperament and Equal Temperament,  I am convinced <br>> that it was not composed with ET in mind.  I just cannot imagine <br>> Beethoven would have been oblivious to, or uncaring about the lack of<br>> tonal contrasts that follow from the use of Equal Temperament.<br><br>Musicians have convinced themselves of all sorts of things by relying on <br>"what the music says", or "what their ears tell them". For instance, the <br>performance of Renaissance polyphony without sharpened leading-notes at <br>cadences was the norm until a few years ago, and prominent ensembles <br>such as the Hilliard still sing this way. People convinced themselves <br>that this was the characteristic sound of Renaissance modality, that <br>flat leading notes were in the music, obvious to anyone who used their <br>ears. But it was all utter rubbish, based on a wilful disregard of all <br>the sources on ficta practices, and on a misguided fixation with a modal <br>purity that had nothing to do with compositional practices of this time. <br>You can still find plenty of CDs which bear witness to this nonsense.<br><br>The ground strewn with such corpses, so forgive me if I'm disinclined to <br>accept any far-reaching thesis purely on the grounds that the ears of <br>some (no doubt able) musician have convinced him of its truth. What of <br>the converse: would you like to say that anyone whose stomach doesn't <br>churn at the sound of Beethoven in ET lacks some essentials of <br>musicianship? Was Chopin (advocate of ET, as I've said before) less than <br>a true musician?<br><br>> Walker again;<br>> >If pianists need their confidence<br>> >bolstered by foundationless arguments, concerning the tunings<br>> >Beethoven would have heard, <snip><br>> <br>>       Foundationless arguments?
