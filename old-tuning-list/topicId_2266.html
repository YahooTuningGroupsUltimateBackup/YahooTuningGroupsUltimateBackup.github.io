So, I came up with<br>a way that I could help out communication on the list in, hopefully, a<br>meaningful way. Basically a tape swap is my idea. I know alot of you have<br>web sites where one can download songs or wave files but unfortunately I can't<br>tune into that stuff and I certainly can't put up my own website. So,for all<br>ofus still banging rocks and sticks together (and even those with web sites) I<br>offer a tape swap so we can hear each others tunings and musical ideas.<br><br>This is how I will do it.<br><br>1) Send me a Cassette with a couple of musical pieces. Brevity is important.<br>5 minutes a piece seems like a good limit to me. If you have nothing that<br>short then I may simply take an excerpt ( as long as you don't state any<br>objection to this).<br><br>2)Along with the tape please send me a blank tape (90 minutes in length) and a<br>self-addresed stamped padded envelope.<br><br><br>3) I will take the tapes, transfer them onto DAT, then dub out copies from<br>there. Then send then back to you!<br><br>I will solicit tapes for about 3 weeks and then stop. I have no idea what the<br>response on this will be like but if  there are more than 18 responses I will<br>then start a second tape for the 19+ GROUP. So there would be circulating 2<br>different tapes, not everyone would have everyone else's music but at least<br>we would all still be getting a smattering of what others are up to sonically<br>on this list.<br><br>I would personally like to hold onto the tapes that you all send me and I will<br>do so unless you request otherwise.<br><br>OH,YES AND ....<br><br><br>LINER NOTES.<br><br>4) give me some very basic information about music you are submitting<br>e.g. tuning (of course), maybe some formal aspects, or perhaps something that<br>you feel is particullarly sweet to listen for, maybe even a couple of lines of<br>philosophy. I will type it up on a sheet and enclose it with the tape.<br><br>Please don't expect anything more than the bare bones on this one. My goal is<br>to put a little sound in the backs of our minds as we read the list while<br>considering what is being written.<br><br>This tuning community is very small and it is very diverse and I think that is<br>great. A project like this, because of our size, is still very possible,<br>hopefully, that will change.<br><br>Please send your harmonies to:<br><br>Denis Atadan<br>13 Washington Street<br>Newark, Delaware 19711<br><br>Allow as much as 6-8 weeks for your first tape.
