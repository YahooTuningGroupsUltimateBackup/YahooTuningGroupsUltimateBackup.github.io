Don't fall into the trap of using PCs as a model for RAM requirements<br>on a sampler.  There is no limit to the astounding levels of inefficiency that<br>programmers seem to be attaining on PCs, but there are definite physical limits<br>to how much RAM you need to digitize audio.  <br><br>   How much RAM you need depends a lot on what you're doing with the sampler.<br>For example, if you're doing orchestral instrument simulations, everything's<br>going to be looped and you don't need to sample in stereo.  If you:<br>1.  Keep your loop sizes down below 1.5 seconds then each wavesample will be <br>    about that long on the average.  The fact that few loops need to be 1.5 <br>    seconds long if you choose your sample material carefully, gives you <br>    room in 1.5 seconds for the attack transients.  (With the wonders of <br>    electronics, its easy to lose sight of the fact that, on a surprisingly <br>    large number of orchestral instruments, it's quite difficult to hold a <br>    single note longer than 6 seconds or so.)  <br>2.  Introduce a new wavesample every major third on the average.<br>3.  Use a typical orchestral instrument range at 2.5 octaves.<br>4.  Limit yourself to 11 instruments total (violin, viola, 'cello, d.bass, <br>    flute, Bb/A clarinet, oboe, bassoon, F.horn, t.trombone, and tuba).  <br>If I can still do mental arithmetic, that all totals up to 132 seconds of total<br>sampling time for an entire orchestra.  That leaves some room for a generic<br>string ensemble sound to enhance the individual string solo sounds, and maybe<br>even a little room for some percussion.<br><br>   Don't get me wrong;  I realize that that's a very scanty orchestra of limited<br>accuracy.  And sure, I'd like to have more RAM expansion capacity alright.  But<br>my point is not to immediately laugh off 16Meg of RAM and ask for double that,<br>muchless 8 or 16 times that much, until you think out what you can do with<br>16Meg.  You can do a heck of a lot with 16Meg!  Especially when the ASR-10 can<br>(all by it's little lonesome) play direct-from-disk audio.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 22 Dec 1995 21:26 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA02656; Fri, 22 Dec 1995 12:26:28 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 22 Dec 1995 12:26:28 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199512222025.AA02566@interlock.wdni.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>ASR-10 RAM</h1><h3><a id=2413 href="#2413">ðŸ”—</a>Gary &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/1995 12:03:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> [1] The ASR-10 needs more RAM.
