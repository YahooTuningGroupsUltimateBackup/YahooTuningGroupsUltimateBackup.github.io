Some of my acquaintance decide that<br>it might be innerstin' to figure out how a DX7 assigns pitches on a<br>keyboard (imagine my good fortune.

I'd initially<br>started by using the tunings from the gamelan I perform with at Cornell<br>and some stuff from Colin MacPhee, but ran into the same problem<br>that sent Bill Sethares on his grand quest - lots of my hard-won<br>programming of timbres sounded like complete nonsense with the new<br>tunings.

When my beloved got a Fulbright<br>and we moved to the Netherlands in 1989-90, I became a Sonologist, and<br>wound up riding the   train between Utrecht and Den Haag nearly every<br>day. One of the books I'd taken along to work my way through was "Karawitan:<br>Source Readings in Javanese Gamelan." I thought then that it was about<br>time that I tried to get a sense of the way that the Javanese thought  of their<br>own traditions (besides - a bunch of my teachers had translations and<br>articles in the book). One of the interesting ideas that I kept circling<br>around in the book was the notion of how one "transposes" between<br>various Javanese pathet, and I found myself thinking about the extent<br>to which it might be possible to look at making a kind of transpositional<br>version of my scale. So, I did the stupidest and simplest thing; I got out<br>my notebook on the train and took the Slendro scale from Dan Schmidt's<br>Just Intonational variant and figured the frequencies by using each of the<br>other pitches besides 1/1 as the first note for the series of ratios. It wasn't<br>pretty - with some "tempering", you can produce something that seems<br>to work rather well to the ear. But that's another story. Since I'm nearly<br>innumerate and exceedingly stupid, that took me pretty much the whole<br>way from Gouda and Woerden back home.<br><br>But the next afternoon, I tried the same thing with the Pelog scale, and<br>found something that worked beautifully. When I took Dan's Pelog<br><br>1/1 - 11/10 - 6/5 - 7/5 - 3/2 - 8/5 - 9/5<br><br>and cranked out a new set of pitches using the same ratios starting on the<br>3/2, all kinds of stuff started to drop out (that is, I wound up with<br>frequencies that were octaves of the 7 tones I already had). I've still got<br>the piece of graph paper from that train ride somewhere, full of places<br>where I scratched out the doubled notes. I wound up with (drum roll)<br>12 NOTES which gave me two Schmidt Pelog scales a perfect fifth apart.<br>"Oh, cool," I thought. I got off the train, ran home, fired up JICalc on<br>my Mac Plus, and typed in the new scale (from F=600)<br><br>600-630-660-675-720-810-840-900-945-960-990-1080<br><br>(I'll let y'all do that on your own)<br><br>And all kinds of cool stuff started dropping out once I started stepping<br>through the intervals on transpose. The thing that made me happiest was<br>that I'd managed to get a Schmidt *Slendro* scale outta putting the two<br>Pelogs together - two of 'em, actually. It's the scale that's been on my<br>keyboards since that very day, and the one I've pretty much exclusively<br>for my own pleasure. The genesis of the thing was impossibly mundane<br>and dumb, but it gave me what at the time seemed a kewl set of options.<br>After that, I started making music and pretty much forgot about it.<br><br>I include this little tale to encourage those of you who may be flummoxed<br>by the squad of witty and numerate folks here.

No revolution, no agenda. I just wanted to mess about with the<br>Javanese music I studied and loved (and wasn't gifted with the intelligence<br>that allowed Bill Sethares to discover a whole bunch of neat stuff in the<br>course of wondering about how to come up with good timbres for *his*<br>stuff). I confess here before the assembled masses just *how* I wound<br>up with my silly little "personal" scale that's brought me so much<br>pleasure.
