In Tuning Digest 710, Taylor<br>wrote:<br>"[the recent Mills server crash] allowed me a little more time to think <br>again and try to excise my late uncle's comments on his antisemitic <br>prejudices (which, surprisingly, bothered me more to discuss than his <br>racism - which I guess I'd expect from a southerner of his age) and to <br>put a more positive spin on things..." -- Greg Taylor<br>Since Taylor posted the selfsame implication that I'm anti-Semitic<br>more than 6 months ago, then repeated the insinuation on 1 May in Tuning<br>Digest 702, the *repeated* the insinuation yet again on 9 May in Tuning<br>Digest 713, Taylor's expression of self-disgust rings more than a little <br>false to these old ears.<br>Pardon my French, but I''ll be damned if I'll sit back and let someone<br>accuse me of felony hate speech on 3 separate occasions and call <br>it "putting a positive spin  on things." <br>I've got a strong stomach, but there's some shit I will NOT eat.<br>Again, let me put the record straight:<br>As Greg Taylor well knows, there is no trace of anti-Semitism<br>or white supremacy in ANY of my posts. <br>My main "crime" has been to traduce against Gregory Taylor's<br>favorite 20th-century modernist composers.<br>I have done this, apparently, by saying that people in positions of <br>musical authority and prestige tend to become self-satisfied.  <br>I've said 12-TET concert audiences tend to lapse into inertia, and <br>become used to hearing the same old thing at every<br>concert.  <br>Both the avant-garde and the civic orchestras tend to fall <br>into comfortable ruts.<br>By what stretch of imagination is this "a shadowy cabal"?<br>In what way is this akin to "anti-Semitism"?<br>It *is* a fact that in universities,  talented microtonal<br>composers tend to be overlooked because it would require<br>extra effort for performers to play their music.<br>The string players would have to learn  to tune scordatura<br>and some new sight-singing to play a composition in<br>19 tones per octaves.  This would jolt the average<br>performer out of hi/r comfortable rut, and so microtonal<br>composers find themselves at a disadvantage vis-a-vis<br>12-TET composers for no good reason.<br>In the same way, talented and insightful microtonal composers<br>and theorists find themselves at a disadvantage compared to<br>12-TET composers and theorists as regards academic<br>appointments.  The reason has nothing to do with Greg Taylor's<br>imaginary "conspiracies" or "shadowy cabals."  Instead, it's<br>just human nature. If everyone in the music department knows<br>12-TET music theory  and very few people know  microtonal <br>music theory, then the next job applicant is likely to be a<br>12-TET music theorist rather than a microtonalist.<br>Why?<br>Not because of Greg Taylor's imaginary "cabals" or <br>ludicrous "conspiracies."<br>Rather, because everyone in the music department is well <br>equipped to evaluate the 12-TET applicant's credentials and <br>uprepared to evaluate  a microtonal music theorist.<br>If, for example,  a prospective candidate for an assistant <br>professorship points out that some equal tempered scales<br>have musically functional perfect fifths (12,17,19,22,24,27,29,<br>31, etc.) while other equal tempered scales have musically<br>non-functional fifths which don't sound anything like "perfect"<br>fifths (6,13,16,18,23)...  Well, how does the 12-TET music<br>faculty committee evaluate this statement?<br>Will the faculty committee call a halt to the hiring process<br>so they can run out, get a synthesizer, and go through all<br>the effort of tuning all those equal temperaments to test<br>the candidate's claim?<br>Or will these overworked Ph.D.s instead simply say,<br>"Well, what this microtonalist  says might be true, but<br>since we perform and teach 12-TET music in this<br>university, we'd probably be better off hiring someone who's<br>solely concerned with 12-TET music."<br>This has nothing to do with any kind of silly "conspiracy," <br>it's merely an example of human inertia.<br>It's also a vivid example of the  very real tendency<br>of large bureaucracies to keep doing what they're assigned<br>to do long after the reason for it has vanished.<br>As I've pointed out in my previous posts, the job of the university<br>music department is changing rapidly.  University music<br>departments used to teach students how to compose & analyze<br>and perform music in 12-TET--and that made sense, since<br>all the concerts and all the musical instruments<br>at those concerts were locked into 12-TET. <br>But today, live concerts more and more often include<br>electronics and synthesizers which are *not* locked into <br>12-TET.  Very often nowadays a concert of new music involves<br>a digital synthesizer or DSP processor which can be put<br>non-12 with the touch of a button.<br>This means that universities are, by and large, preparing<br>students for a career in a 19th-century concert hall <br>environment which no longer exists.  Yet the university<br>music departments continue on as they are, unwilling to change,<br>stuck in a 12-TET rut. <br>Why?<br>Simple inertia, nothing more.  <br>Greg Taylor knows quite well that I've never spoken of and<br>do not believe in "conspiracy" or "a shadowy cabal of serialists,'<br>he's just out to smear me as an anti-Semite.  Greg Taylor knows<br>quite well that the main impression everyone will carry away from<br>his defamatory posts is "mclaren is anti-Jewish and anti-black."<br>For good measure, Greg Taylor keeps repeating the ad hominem<br>attack, implying over and over again that I'm anti-Jewish and <br>that I hate blacks.<br>For the record, Greg Taylor's implication is a lie.<br>For the record, I abhor anti-Jewish racism.  I despise people who<br>talk about "niggers."

He has never posted citations, articles, <br>historical facts about microtonality, or indeed anything <br>much but ad hominem character assassination along the <br>lines of his constant stories about his repulsive <br>Jew-baiting white supremacist uncle.<br>If it weren't for his  ceaseless  false insinuations about <br>Your Humble E-Mail Correspondent, Greg Taylor would apparently <br>have nothing to post at all.<br>Frankly, this is tiresome.<br>If you want to rebut my arguments, Taylor, cite some contradictory<br>references.  Stop sneaking around implying that people you disagree <br>with are anti-Semites and white supremacists.<br> Cut out the Nixon-style smear tactics.<br>Come on out of the shadows. Rise from the gutter. Make your argument<br>on the basis of the facts--rather than stories about your racist<br>uncle.<br>Such character assassination ("so-and-so reminds me of a child <br>molester on TV," "so-and-so reminds me of my Anti-Semite white<br>supremacist uncle," "so-and-so reminds me of a drug dealer ")<br>has no place in this tuning forum. <br>Anti-Semitic/white supremacy hate speech is a felony.  <br>I don't appreciate  being accused of committing a felony <br>simply because you disagree with me. <br>If you don't like my ideas, rebut them.  If you disagree <br>with my references, cite opposing references.
