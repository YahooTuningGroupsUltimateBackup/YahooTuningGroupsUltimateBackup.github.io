The Ramirez (it's a cheapie for a Ramirez) was designed to be played<br>very loudly, so the nut and bridge are MUCH taller than the frets.

Most guitars use a weak<br>glue for setting the nut (and a few use none at all), so it's not usually hard<br>to adjust them.  The biggest difficulty is that, in the process of filing into<br>the fingerboard, you'll accidentally file down into the neck.  That's easy to do<br>because the wood for the neck is often softer than for the fingerboard.
