The idea is that we are optimizing the <br>_diatonic_ dominant seventh chord with respect to a tuning of 4:5:6:7 by <br>minimizing the weighted or unweighted mean of the squared errors of all six <br>intervals in that chord. No schismatic thirds, augmented sixths, etc. are <br>used.<br>	    There is a discussion currently about whether the 4:5:6:7 is the <br>classical dominant seventh chord and whether it is too consonant. In most <br>cases I would say that 4:5:6:7 should not be used for the dominant seventh <br>and therefore a negative tuning such as meantone is best, as only the triads <br>should be rendered as consonant as possible. But there are other styles for <br>which diatonic dominant sevenths or minor 6th (that means minor with an <br>added major 6th) chords are tonics, and should be tuned accordingly. My <br>results indicate that mildly positive tunings are better for such styles. <br>12-tET is a compromise that leans slightly toward the latter; in fact I <br>think it unlikely that mixolydian and dorian would have achieved their <br>current popularity had a negative system become standard in Western music.<br> -Paul E.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 13 Mar 1997 00:03 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04955; Thu, 13 Mar 1997 00:03:56 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04952<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id PAA15168; Wed, 12 Mar 1997 15:02:17 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 12 Mar 1997 15:02:17 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B12C606EBAEF3.6A55@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5080 href="#5080">ðŸ”—</a>rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz (Ray Tomes)</h3><span>3/13/1997 5:47:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net> wrote:<br><br>>The discussion about whether or not our ears can hear certain <br>>frequencies, and the implications thereof, is interesting to me.

No schismatic thirds, augmented sixths, etc. are <br>used.<br>	    There is a discussion currently about whether the 4:5:6:7 is the <br>classical dominant seventh chord and whether it is too consonant. In most <br>cases I would say that 4:5:6:7 should not be used for the dominant seventh <br>and therefore a negative tuning such as meantone is best, as only the triads <br>should be rendered as consonant as possible. But there are other styles for <br>which diatonic dominant sevenths or minor 6th (that means minor with an <br>added major 6th) chords are tonics, and should be tuned accordingly. My <br>results indicate that mildly positive tunings are better for such styles. <br>12-tET is a compromise that leans slightly toward the latter; in fact I <br>think it unlikely that mixolydian and dorian would have achieved their <br>current popularity had a negative system become standard in Western music.<br> -Paul E.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 13 Mar 1997 00:03 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04955; Thu, 13 Mar 1997 00:03:56 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04952<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id PAA15168; Wed, 12 Mar 1997 15:02:17 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 12 Mar 1997 15:02:17 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B12C606EBAEF3.6A55@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5080 href="#5080">ðŸ”—</a>rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz (Ray Tomes)</h3><span>3/13/1997 5:47:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net> wrote:<br><br>>The discussion about whether or not our ears can hear certain <br>>frequencies, and the implications thereof, is interesting to me.
