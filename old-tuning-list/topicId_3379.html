If the tuning resolution is, for example, 1<br><br>> Hz, in lower registers there is going to be good intonation for the<br>> harmonic series above 1 Hz, and all else will be rough approximations. I<br>> think that the contrast between the exact and approximate tunings would<br>be<br>> musically unacceptable (with a resolution of 1 Hz, try modulating from<br>the<br>> key of 80 Hz to its subdominant!). If I can't have a tuning with the<br>> accuracy of the Rayna, then I would like the potential deviation from<br>Just<br>> to be spread around as much as possible in a temperament that represents<br>> harmonic identities consistently. As long as you are not working with<br>> sustained textures that really require something like the Rayna, I think<br>> that absolute frequency resolution will be secondary to consistency. I<br>made<br>> the suggestion that equal-tempered division of the octave divisible by 12<br><br>> be considered because, MIDI standard or not, tuning tables seem to be<br>> expressed at the software level most often in terms of unit deviations<br>from<br>> 12tet pitch classes, not in terms of octave divisions alone, and<br>> manufacturers will probably be interested in supporting microtonal<br>capacity<br>> only when that does not eliminate an accurate 12tet. From my experience,<br>> 768tet and 1200tet are not good choices but there are ET of this<br>magnitude<br>> that would be better.    <br>> <br>No, I understood you perfectly.  The MIDI Tuning Standard has a maximum<br>resolution of 100 cents / 2^14 = .0061 cents.  Only 768TET, 1536 TET,<br>3072TET, etc. fit within that standard.  Trying to achieve some other nTET<br>with better consistency will have several problems from a practical<br>standpoint:<br>1. The MIDI Tuning Standard, while currently implemented by only three<br>manufacturers (Emu, Ensoniq and Turtle Beach), is the only standard we've<br>got.  To propose some division of the semitone other than its 2^n divisions<br>would set back the little progress it has made.  I know some list members<br>are disappointed over the lack of response to the MIDI Tuning Standard, but<br>this is to be expected given the design life cycles of these instrument<br>lines that amount to 3-8 years on average.<br>2.  Division of the octave or semitone by other than binary multiples is<br>not likely to be accepted by manufacturers.  They have no margin timewise<br>for anything more complicated than binary multiplication/division in<br>calculating pitch.  Remember that they are using microprocessors like the<br>68000, 68340 (68020 comparible), or 68020 running at 16 to 25 MHz, not the<br>latest Pentium or RISC processor.  While this situation will improve in the<br>future, the increase in voice count is likely to eat up any processing<br>speed improvements.<br>3.  My impression is that instruments with "1 cent resolution" actually map<br>some 100 cent / 2^n division to the 1 cent value.  The Ensoniq<br>EPS/16Plus/ASR-10 certainly do this.  I believe Roland does it as well. <br>The actual scale is stored as 100 / 2^n divisions, usually 768TET, not 1<br>cent.  This could explain why some list members have worse results with<br>these instruments since the conversion errors are not consistent.  For<br>instance, if you want to adjust a pitch by +0.6 cents, you would round up<br>to 1 cent.  The 1 cent value on your synth display is closest to 1.5625<br>cents, so now your pitch is adjusted by +1.5625 cents, instead of 0 cents<br>which would have been closer.  Perhaps one request should be to show the<br>actual cents values to several decimal places, not roughly translated<br>values or hard to decipher tuning units.<br><br>John Loffink<br>jloffink@pdq.net</div><h3><a id=7600 href="#7600">ðŸ”—</a>wauchope@AIC.NRL.Navy.Mil</h3><span>4/29/1998 2:01:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> I did the exact same experiment many years ago.

Erlich says:<br>> <br>> For an interval in perfect just intontation, whatever phase difference<br>> was present at the beginning of the sound would persist for the duration<br>> of the sound. Let's say two instruments are producing tones, both of<br>> which have an equally loud partial at 1000Hz. For someone standing in a<br>> particular location with respect to the two instruments, there is some<br>> delay time between the beginning times of the two instruments for which<br>> the 1000Hz components will interefere constructively, resulting in four<br>> times the energy at that frequency than what one instrument alone would<br>> produce. For a delay time just 1/2000 of a second longer, you get<br>> destructive interference, or no energy at that frequency. Obviously no<br>> human instrumentalist can control their onset time to within 1/2000 of a<br>> second relative to the onset time of another instrument. So you end up<br>> with a random number between zero and four to describe the energy of the<br>> 1000Hz component -- probably not the musical effect you were looking<br>> for. Even an individual performer playing both instruments can't do it<br>> -- try tuning two synth keys to the same note and notice how repeatedly<br>> playing both keys "simultaneously" leads to random fluctuations in the<br>> loudness.<br>> <br>> Now if the onset times are controlled really accurately by MIDI, and<br>> let's say a 90-degree phase shift is chosen so that the energy at 1000Hz<br>> is twice that from one instrument, then you're doing okay, right? But<br>> for someone standing in a different location in the room, though, the<br>> differece in the path lengths from the two instruments, and thus the<br>> phase, will be different. There are nodes of destructive interference<br>> and antinodes of constructive interference in the room no matter what<br>> the original phase shift was. So some members of the audience may be<br>> receiving no energy at 1000Hz, while others may be receiving four times<br>> what they would from one instrument. Again, probably not the effect you<br>> were looking for.<br>> <br>> If both instruments are electronic, and their signals are mixed into one<br>> speaker, there will be no spatial nodes or antinodes. So finally you can<br>> control the musical effect. But other than monophonic electronic<br>> MIDI-sequenced music, perfect JI can lead to big problems. In the real<br>> world, thankfully, acoustic instruments are slightly out-of-tune with<br>> each other, so that whatever the onset delay and whatever the position<br>> in the room, one gets a signal that frequencies common to both tones<br>> have an average energy twice that of one instrument. There will not be<br>> noticeable, let alone startling, differences in the musical effect<br>> depending on minute variations in the onset delay or position in the<br>> room.<br>> <br><br>In addition, it has been my experience that when creating JI related sample<br>loops, that it is not enough that the frequency relationships be exact - the<br>period of the wave cycles involved all must have a simple divisible integer<br>relation with one common compound period/sample length. Further, I believe<br>that it is best to have a simple divisible relationship with the sampling rate<br>one is employing. As an example, for a recent set of 21 JI pitch relationships<br>I developed, I used a common 1/1 period number/sample base length of 21870.

If I can't have a tuning with the<br>> accuracy of the Rayna, then I would like the potential deviation from<br>Just<br>> to be spread around as much as possible in a temperament that represents<br>> harmonic identities consistently. As long as you are not working with<br>> sustained textures that really require something like the Rayna, I think<br>> that absolute frequency resolution will be secondary to consistency. I<br>made<br>> the suggestion that equal-tempered division of the octave divisible by 12<br><br>> be considered because, MIDI standard or not, tuning tables seem to be<br>> expressed at the software level most often in terms of unit deviations<br>from<br>> 12tet pitch classes, not in terms of octave divisions alone, and<br>> manufacturers will probably be interested in supporting microtonal<br>capacity<br>> only when that does not eliminate an accurate 12tet. From my experience,<br>> 768tet and 1200tet are not good choices but there are ET of this<br>magnitude<br>> that would be better.    <br>> <br>No, I understood you perfectly.  The MIDI Tuning Standard has a maximum<br>resolution of 100 cents / 2^14 = .0061 cents.  Only 768TET, 1536 TET,<br>3072TET, etc. fit within that standard.  Trying to achieve some other nTET<br>with better consistency will have several problems from a practical<br>standpoint:<br>1. The MIDI Tuning Standard, while currently implemented by only three<br>manufacturers (Emu, Ensoniq and Turtle Beach), is the only standard we've<br>got.  To propose some division of the semitone other than its 2^n divisions<br>would set back the little progress it has made.  I know some list members<br>are disappointed over the lack of response to the MIDI Tuning Standard, but<br>this is to be expected given the design life cycles of these instrument<br>lines that amount to 3-8 years on average.<br>2.  Division of the octave or semitone by other than binary multiples is<br>not likely to be accepted by manufacturers.  They have no margin timewise<br>for anything more complicated than binary multiplication/division in<br>calculating pitch.  Remember that they are using microprocessors like the<br>68000, 68340 (68020 comparible), or 68020 running at 16 to 25 MHz, not the<br>latest Pentium or RISC processor.  While this situation will improve in the<br>future, the increase in voice count is likely to eat up any processing<br>speed improvements.<br>3.  My impression is that instruments with "1 cent resolution" actually map<br>some 100 cent / 2^n division to the 1 cent value.  The Ensoniq<br>EPS/16Plus/ASR-10 certainly do this.  I believe Roland does it as well. <br>The actual scale is stored as 100 / 2^n divisions, usually 768TET, not 1<br>cent.  This could explain why some list members have worse results with<br>these instruments since the conversion errors are not consistent.  For<br>instance, if you want to adjust a pitch by +0.6 cents, you would round up<br>to 1 cent.  The 1 cent value on your synth display is closest to 1.5625<br>cents, so now your pitch is adjusted by +1.5625 cents, instead of 0 cents<br>which would have been closer.  Perhaps one request should be to show the<br>actual cents values to several decimal places, not roughly translated<br>values or hard to decipher tuning units.<br><br>John Loffink<br>jloffink@pdq.net</div><h3><a id=7600 href="#7600">ðŸ”—</a>wauchope@AIC.NRL.Navy.Mil</h3><span>4/29/1998 2:01:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> I did the exact same experiment many years ago.

Erlich says:<br>> <br>> For an interval in perfect just intontation, whatever phase difference<br>> was present at the beginning of the sound would persist for the duration<br>> of the sound. Let's say two instruments are producing tones, both of<br>> which have an equally loud partial at 1000Hz. For someone standing in a<br>> particular location with respect to the two instruments, there is some<br>> delay time between the beginning times of the two instruments for which<br>> the 1000Hz components will interefere constructively, resulting in four<br>> times the energy at that frequency than what one instrument alone would<br>> produce. For a delay time just 1/2000 of a second longer, you get<br>> destructive interference, or no energy at that frequency. Obviously no<br>> human instrumentalist can control their onset time to within 1/2000 of a<br>> second relative to the onset time of another instrument. So you end up<br>> with a random number between zero and four to describe the energy of the<br>> 1000Hz component -- probably not the musical effect you were looking<br>> for. Even an individual performer playing both instruments can't do it<br>> -- try tuning two synth keys to the same note and notice how repeatedly<br>> playing both keys "simultaneously" leads to random fluctuations in the<br>> loudness.<br>> <br>> Now if the onset times are controlled really accurately by MIDI, and<br>> let's say a 90-degree phase shift is chosen so that the energy at 1000Hz<br>> is twice that from one instrument, then you're doing okay, right? But<br>> for someone standing in a different location in the room, though, the<br>> differece in the path lengths from the two instruments, and thus the<br>> phase, will be different. There are nodes of destructive interference<br>> and antinodes of constructive interference in the room no matter what<br>> the original phase shift was. So some members of the audience may be<br>> receiving no energy at 1000Hz, while others may be receiving four times<br>> what they would from one instrument. Again, probably not the effect you<br>> were looking for.<br>> <br>> If both instruments are electronic, and their signals are mixed into one<br>> speaker, there will be no spatial nodes or antinodes. So finally you can<br>> control the musical effect. But other than monophonic electronic<br>> MIDI-sequenced music, perfect JI can lead to big problems. In the real<br>> world, thankfully, acoustic instruments are slightly out-of-tune with<br>> each other, so that whatever the onset delay and whatever the position<br>> in the room, one gets a signal that frequencies common to both tones<br>> have an average energy twice that of one instrument.

Further, I believe<br>that it is best to have a simple divisible relationship with the sampling rate<br>one is employing.
