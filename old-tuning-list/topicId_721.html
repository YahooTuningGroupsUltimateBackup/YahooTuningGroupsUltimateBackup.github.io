The tape wasn't<br>ready on time and as a result no one has heard<br>this seminal document for 30 years.

The idea<br>that someone might find the neutral third discordant<br>would never have occurred to me: and the idea that the<br>7/5 might be heard as *more* concordant is extremely<br>surprising.<br>Ivor Darreg used to point out that people tended to prefer<br>either 19 or 22 tone equal temperament, and their<br>preferences were generally  strong.  If you liked 22, you<br>rejected 19 violently--or vice versa.<br>At least one tuning forum member has decried 22-TET<br>as "slimy," which presumably indicates a negative<br>reaction to 22-TET.  For my part, I prefer 22 to 19.<br>Ivor pointed out that such consistently binary and strong<br>preferences (hardly anyone likes both tunings equally, or<br>is indifferent to both) might indicate personality traits.<br>Ivor suggested that something like the Minnesota Multiphasic<br>might be done with tunings, rather than written cues.<br>Expanding on that idea, it occurs to me that personality<br>types might be distinguished by, say, preference for 7/5<br>as opposed to the geometric mean neutral third.<br>This is highly speculative.  Anyone care to test a group<br>of students with both Minnesota Multiphasic *and*<br>tuning preference and see if there's a correlation twixt<br>various personality traits and various tuning preferences?<br>In correspondence, I recently ventured the hypothesis<br>that folks who like primarily near-just equal <br>temperaments like 31-TET, 19-TET, 22-TET, 41-TET,<br>53-TET, etc., might fall toward the left-brain purist<br>control-freak end of the personality spectrum, while<br>folks who mainly enjoy wildly non-twelvular equal<br>temepraments like 13-TET, 11-TET, 9-TET, 23-TET, etc.<br>might fall toward the right-brain intuitive New Age<br>hippy-dippy end of the personality spectrum.<br>Again, this is mere persiflage and wild speculation.<br>However,  the fact remains that people do tend to <br>fall in distinct groups as regards their response to<br>different classes of tunings.  So perhaps there's<br>a personality component involved.<br>It'd be fascinating to play real microtonal music,<br>tally preferences, and compare the results to<br>personality test scores.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 1 Sep 1996 07:28 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11419; Sun, 1 Sep 1996 07:29:35 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11336<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA07219; Sat, 31 Aug 1996 22:29:33 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 31 Aug 1996 22:29:33 -0700<br>Message-Id: <3229384B.D6C@sprynet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3516 href="#3516">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/1996 9:01:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject:  30 years of gibberish<br>--<br>My statement of what has long been regarded<br>as obvious fact sparked real fury in this tuning<br>forum.  When I pointed out in Digest 714 that,<br>"As has long since been demonstrated, most of <br>the subscribers to this forum have no interest in <br>music.  To all but a handful of you, music is an <br>annoying and deeply distasteful waste product of <br>the really IMPORTANT aesthetic process--<br>namely, theorizing."  -- mclaren, TD 714<br>..Well, when I pointed out this obvious fact, a<br>veritable firestorm of outrage ensued.<br>Yet it has been recognized for more than 30<br>years that my statement is simple fact.<br>In the Perspectives of New Music article "Some<br>Current Trends," vol. 5, No. 4, 1966, pp. 81-84,<br>Ernst Krenek points out: "...after assiduously<br>studying Babbitt's essay "Twelve-tone invariants..."<br>Musical Quarterly, XLVI (April, 1960), 246-59,<br>I have covered several sheets of music paper with<br>experiments, exercises, and examples trying to<br>penetrate the meaning of his discourse, and finally<br>approached my learned friend by letter for more<br>information.  It was of no avail, and I gave up in<br>frustration since I did not wish to encroach <br>further on his time.  I am afraid that the use of<br>this language in PERSPECTIVES has reached a point<br>of diminishing returns: *the possible increment of<br>scholarly prestige (not to speak of snob appeal)<br>is compensated by loss of communicability.*" [Krenek,<br>Ernst, "Some Current Terms," Perspectives of New<br>Music, Vol. 5, No. 4, 1966, pg. 84]<br>This quote is 30 years old.  Yet it echoes precisely my<br>own.  <br>How can any of my posts *possibly* be considered<br>"outrageous" when they merely repeat sentiments <br>*expressed and agreed upon for more than 30 years?*<br>In "Some Problems Raised by the Rhythmic Procedures<br>in Milton Babbitt's Composition for Twelve<br>Instruments," Perspectives of New Music, Vol. 4,<br>No. 2, 1965, Peter Westergaard points out that "Such<br>a resultant rhythm has just as little to do with ordering<br>the sets as the previous example, and nothing to do with<br>their contours. If the supposition at the beginning of<br>this paragraph were true, it might at best be thought<br>of as the unstructured results of a conflict between<br>two highly structured elements.  But the supposition<br>is not true. <br>"I see no way for the ear to distinguish those attacks<br>which define durations for Po and those which define <br>durations for RI2.  Thus, I see now way for the ear to<br>perceive either order or content." [Westergaard, Peter,<br>op cit.]<br>Again, this prelection on the unintelligibility and <br>musical meaninglessness of Milton Babbitt's "theories"<br>differs from my own merely in fine details.  Are we <br>to believe that, after *more than 30 years,* anyone <br>is still shocked by this simple recitation of fact?  <br>Please.<br>People have been pointing out that Babbitt's pitch-class<br>matrix jargon is musically meaningless nonsense for <br>30+ years.  Get over it.<br>Krenek cuts to the heart of the matter when he mentions:<br>"We are reminded of Oswald Spengler's prediction forty<br>years ago that the true representative of our age will<br>be the engineer and that the artist will become obsolete.<br>Perhaps some artists fear that he was right and attempt<br>to demonstrate that they really *are* engineers, in order to<br>be assured of a raison d'etre." [Krenek, Ernst, "A composer's<br>Influences," Perspectives of New Music, 3(1), 1964, pg. 41]<br>Again, this is a near-verbatim reiteration of points made in <br>my own posts.<br>More recently, William Thompson has summarized the<br>process of systematic post-1948 academic obfuscation  <br>and pretentiousness in his book Schoenberg's Error: "The <br>flurry of enthusiasms of [the 1950s] centered not around <br>Schoenberg, whom Boulez had declared `dead,' but around<br>Webern. From the movement's inception in the United<br>States, the newly-influential academic segment of the<br>population became prominent, especially among themselves.<br>In time it demonstrated how the lives of artworks (whose<br>dependence on the auspices of higher education had in <br>times past been negligible) could be sustained by<br>artificial means beyond normal expentency, regardless of<br>their direct aesthetic vibrancy.<br>"The era's post-Viennese energy induced a remarkable<br>production of analytical dissections and speculative<br>tracts--more those than public performances of music.<br>The torrent of words and numbers and fomulae unleashed<br>about Schoenberg's methods, about their more thorough<br>exploitation by Webern, and then about subsequent<br>extensions (like those of Boulez and babbitt) to other<br>musical dimensions, produced one of the most bountiful <br>crops of verbiage ever harvested in the cause of art.<br>"The movement also habored a hidden cul de sac for<br>the unwary.  Its participants produced a fair amount<br>of theoretical "how to..."  composers' shoptalk, which<br>tended to be preoccupied with manipulations of notes<br>as permutable collections, rather than with interpretive <br>descriptions of phenomenal things. So the unassailable<br>and unchanging concern of musicians for the art's aural <br>ontology became secondary to the orderings of serialized<br>particles.  Permutations, reciprocal relativities,<br>combinatoriality, segmentation, source sets, derived <br>sets, intersections, adjacencies, partitions, germ cells,<br>aggregates, pitch qualia, hexachords, mathematical<br>models, complementation modulus-12, pitch (or note) <br>cells, and the like dominated the literature of Serialism.<br>(..)  "Words have special powers: *permutation* had an<br>inimitable ring of profundity, and *modulus-12* was<br>sheer magic.  Both seemed to guarantee conceptual <br>precision and mathematical certainty; both hinted<br>at the flinty `rigor' of the hard sciences. Such<br>terminology prompted a comforting fantasy in the <br>1960s and 1970s; it allowed us metaphorically to<br>put on laboratory smocks and pretend to be<br>`genuine scientists,' the Einsteins of harmony."<br>[Thompson, William, "Schoenberg's Error," 1991, <br>pg. 184]<br>Great as was the outrage that greeted my mention<br>of what has for 30 years been recognized as fact--<br>namely, that dexterity in the manipulation of<br>words  replaced skill in the manipulation of sound <br>among the musical so-called "cognitive elite" from<br>1948 onwards--even greater was the fury that <br>greeted my casual acknowledgement of Boulez, <br>Cage, Stockhausen, et al., as incompetent <br>con  artists.  <br>Yet this too has been exposed as obvious fact <br>for more than 30 years.<br>In discussing the first 6 issues of Die Reihe,<br>touchstone of the Darmstadt School of music<br>and supreme model for all subsequent jargon-<br>laden music theory, John Backus  points out: <br>"The baffling technical language we <br>encounter contains a  considerable amount of what <br>appears to be scientific terminology--definitions, <br>acoustical and physical terms, etc. (..) We may therefore <br>examine Die Reihe with a critical eye...  We wish to see <br>if the scientific terminology is properly used, to see if <br>the charts, graphs and tables have any real significance, <br>and to determine the technical competence of the<br>material from the scientific standpoint. (..)<br>"The first article in V. I by Herbert Eimert demonstrates<br>the technical style adopted by most of the <br>contributors. [Eimert] states (I, 3):<br>`The composer is required to have a certain amount<br>of acoustical knowledge' and proceeds to define<br>six categories of electronic sound...  His definitions,<br>however, besides being difficult to understand, are<br>not acoustically accurate. His first one, tone, is what<br>is known in acoustics as a `simple tone' (his<br>statement that it is unknown to traditional music is<br>not entirely true; flutes and clarinets played softly<br>produce nearly simple tones, for example, as do <br>tuning forks).  [Eimert's] second definition, note, is <br>what is called in acoustics a `complex tone'... <br>"On the other hand, in number four, `noise,' he states<br>` only blank noise which fills an acoustic region<br>may be determined in position.'  This statement<br>does not make sense; if by `blank noise' he means<br>what is now called `white noise,' which contains<br>equal amounts of energy in each unit frequency<br>band width, and if by `position' he means pitch,'<br>then `blank noise' has no `position.' If  `white noise'<br>is filtered to give it the attribute of pitch, <br>it is no longer `white.'  Finally, [Eimert's] fifth category,<br>chord (note complex), is hardly a definition at all.<br>Taken all together, the definitions are very poor<br>examples from the standpoint of conciseness,<br>clarity, or accuracy.<br>"Eimert himself thus appears to be somewhat <br>deficient in the acoustical knowledge now required<br>of the composer.  Since he does not seem to have a<br>clear idea himself of the meaning of the terms he<br>is trying to define, it is not surprising that his<br>definitions are inadequate...  The remainder of [Eimert's]<br>article is for the most part impossible to follow,<br>but since we now see that this is not due to our<br>ignorance of the supposedly necessary acoustical<br>background, we need not concern ourselves further<br>with it. (..) <br>"H. Pousseur adopts a technical style in his <br>contribution.  (..) The definition is too diffuse to <br>quote in full; it has no perceptible beginning nor<br>ending.  Considerable study of it has failed<br>so far to decipher what he is trying to say; it <br>remains quite incomprehensible even after <br>allowing for considerable distortion in the <br>meanings of the technical terms used.  The <br>term 'index of rationality' has no discoverable<br>connection with any concept in acoustics.<br>"The remainder of Pousseur's article follows<br>the example set above.  Trying to understand<br>it is most frustrating to one with merely a<br>technical training in acoustics and music. <br>`Further difficulties were raised in the coordination<br>of preselected quantities with a durational<br>ordering.'  Here is a beautiful example of <br>unintelligibility  `Though they were theoretically<br>correct, they did not have the anticipated<br>effect.'  Correct by what theory?  And so on.<br>"What is being described is basically the process<br>of recording sounds on tape. It is quite possible to<br>describe this process in a manner that can be<br>understood by a physicist with acoustical <br>training.  It should be possible to describe it<br>in simple enough terms so that even a musician<br>with a relatively amall amount of acoustical <br>knowledge could follow what is being done. <br>Pousseur's discussion is only bewildering, and<br>demonstrates his lack of understanding of the<br>subject.<br>"The article by Paul Gredinger states (I, 42) 'the<br>basis of our work remains within the domain of<br>physics...' while remaining unintelligible to<br>the physicist. The word `proportion,' for<br>example, is one which has a specific meaning in<br>physics; it is used a score of times in the article, <br>but never in its accustomed scientific meaning.<br>(..) "Karlheinz Stockhausen contributes a article<br>of forbiddingly technical appearance.  (..) What<br>he means by `statistic' variation is not known;<br>his later discussion of the term (I, 48) only <br>confuses matters further.<br>"His subsequent discussion becomes more and more<br>inspired; mention is made of `harmonic, sub-harmonic,<br>and chromatic ptich-scales,' `spectral composition,'<br>`line- and band-spectra,' and so forth.  The climax is<br>reached in a paragraph which must be quoted in full<br>to be appreciated (I, 47):<br>`Differentiation of the intended permutation of timbres<br>is obtained from the complexity resulting from the<br>simultaneous combination of the six formant regions<br>within one sound process, from the varying of the <br>elements or groups of elements, in all their components,<br>according to the series and of coordinating a special <br>intervallic scale of partials or of medium frequency <br>width ratios in each formant octave.' - Stockhausen<br>"This is formidable language.  What are the six<br>formant regions?  What is an intervallic scale of<br>partials?  or a medium frequency width ratio?  What<br>is a formant octave?  None of these phrases has<br>been used or defined previously.  The individual words <br>have perfectly well-defined scientific meanings, but <br>are combined in ways that make no sense as acoustical<br>language. The paragraph quoted is an excellent example<br>of technical jargon without technical meaning.

The use of<br>technical-sounding gibberish to baffle and nonplus the<br>unwary dupe is a staple of astrologers, spiritualists,<br>fortune-tellers, ufologists, perpetual motion machinists, <br>orgone therapists, bogus swamis, crystal-power healers,<br>aura readers, and dowsers from time immemorial.<br>As John Backus points out, "In fact, the articles in Die<br>Reihe conform to all the best traditions of pseudo-<br>scientific writing in their disregard of accepted<br>meanings of scientific terms, their unintelligibility,<br>and their complete lack of any reference to the results<br>of other workers as support for their statements."<br>[Backus, J., "Die Reihe - A Scientific Evaluation,"<br>Perspectives of New Music, Vol. 1, No. 2, 1962, pg. 171]<br>And thus the primary distinction claimed by Boulez, Cage, <br>Stockhausen, et al., is that for the first time they<br>applied the techniques of ufo cultism and palmistry<br>to music.<br>Thus it's clear why Cage developed such a close<br>relationship with the composers at Darmstadt:<br>Stockhausen and Cage were attracted to one another<br>as irresistably as two psychic surgeons at an AMA<br>convention.

It's merely been brushed off, <br>polished up and trotted out to dupe yet another generation <br>of gullible composers and naive music students.<br>Morris writes:<br>"A closer look at the realization reveals a functional<br>distinction between notes of long and short duration.<br>Long notes, sustained by at least one of the <br>participating instruments, are circled in the underlying<br>design to show that each aggregate projects its<br>own ordered hexachord.  The inside aggregates (numbers<br>2 and 3) project transformations of the first hexachord of<br>the generating row; the long notes in the outside aggregates<br> project hexachords related to one another by T sub 1 1 but <br>not to the hexachords of the P row. If this were an<br>excerpt from an actual piece, these Q hexachords might be a <br>reference to some other hexachord in the word or even<br>some other piece of music." [Morris, Robert, op cit, 1995]<br>This is formidable language.<br>What is an "aggregate"?  How does it "project" its own<br>"underlying hexachord"?  How can one "project" a transformation?<br>In analytic and projective geometry, the term "projection"<br>has a specific meaning, but it is not used in its accustomed<br>mathematical sense in Morris' article.

What are they inside of?  What are they <br>outside of? None of these terms has been used or defined<br>previously.  In particular, the phrase "the long notes of the <br>outside aggregates project hexachords related to one another <br>by T sub 1 1 but not to the hexachords of the P row" stands<br>out as a beautiful example of unintelligibility.<br>Is there any point in  trying to decipher mathematical<br>terms which are not used mathematically?

I've simply reiterated these obvious and<br>long-recognized facts because of the astounding persistence<br>of gullibility and naivete in successive generations of <br>theorists and music students.  Just as urban legends like<br>"alligators in the sewers" have long since been disproven<br>and recognized as fantasies, yet continue to circulate among<br>young and old in the form of stories "everyone knows are true,"<br>in the same way the gibberish and jargon of the 1950s music<br>theorists, long recognized as meaningless jabberwocky,<br>*continues* to circulate like a turd that won't flush.  It's a kind<br>of musical Gresham's Law: gibberish drives out sensible<br>rational discussion in modern music theory.<br>My statements in this regard have been recognized as fact for<br>more more thirty years, and the frenzied reaction to my<br>posts which accurately describe Cage, Boulez, et al. as <br>inept con artists...well, the reaction can only be described <br>as the reflexive twitch of a patient with brain death.<br>And what does ANY of this have to do with microtonality?<br>Well  might you ask, kiddies.<br>The sad fact is that all too many members of this tuning<br>forum have grown up spouting the kind of musical <br>glossolalia decried by Backus, by Krenek,<br>by Thompson, et alia.  Alas, all too many members of this<br>tuning forum have learned music not as music but as<br>a gallimaufry of pseudo-scientific gardyloo... <br>indistinguishable from astrology or ufology except<br>in the details of the pseudo-science employed.  <br>And thus all too many of the members of this tuning<br>forum reflexively approach microtonality as a brand-<br>new wide-open opportunity for jargon and gibberish.<br>This is a poor idea, and we should discourage it.<br>Microtonality is about *music.* <br>To the extent that the posts on this tuning forum<br>depart from the discussion of actual sounds, actual<br>performances, actual notes and chords, actual<br>fist-in-the-gut emotional impact of *music*,<br>to that extent they are wasting the bandwidth<br>of this tuning forum.<br>As Randy Winchester has noted, there is now no<br>longer any rationale for the existence of IRCAM<br>or a Darmstadt School or a Babbitt-style Princeton<br>clique or any of the other purportedly "elite"<br>centers for "modern" music.

Anyone can now<br>disseminate valuable ideas about music theory to<br>a wide public--costly paper is no longer required,<br>expensive subsidy-press music magazines need no<br>longer be run through costly binderies. Thus  it is now<br>no longer possible to shut out uncredentialed but<br>insightful music theorists by refusing publication <br>on the basis of their supposed lack of academic <br>qualifications; they can publish their insights on <br>forums like this one.  It is now no longer possible <br>to silence critics of the 12-TET status quo by denying <br>them print space in  prestigious music journals; they <br>can post incisive critiques on forums like this one.  It <br>is now no longer possible to crush unknown composers<br>who are not members of the proper elite clique of<br>academia by refusing them access to sophisticated<br>hardware and software, because *everyone* has<br>access to awesomely sophisticated hardware and<br>software nowadays.<br>As a result, the only criterion for judging musical<br>value is increasingly: *musical talent.*<br>This explains the fury and hatred which has greeted<br>my posts...

Pauls' achievement is<br>considerable, and the article valuable, for three reasons: [1] Paul<br>appears to be the first theorist who has put together an integrated &<br>coherent notation which can apply not just to a limited range of<br>ETs, but to all of 'em; [2] He has generalized Blackwood's procedures<br>(as when B'wood used every other note from 26 to notate 13) to<br>regularize the notation of equal temperaments in which either<br>the limma =3D the apotome, or in which the neutral mode is the=20<br>predominant melodic paradigm; [3] Paul's approach is open-ended<br>enough and flexible enough to admit of considerable expansion,<br>potentially to other systems than those he considers in his<br>article.<br>All together, Paul's article "The Notation of Equal Temperaments"<br>is among the most impressive and theoretically dextrous=20<br>written on the subject.<br>That said, permit me to respond to some of Paul's wise and<br>insightful comments:<br>Paul posts:<br>"1. Brian says that <I have an "implicit presumption" that one ought to<br>relate "all the especially 12-like tunings with good fifths."> I don't.<br>The basing of a notation system on fifths is all I did, whether or not<br>those fifths are good or bad, or whether an ET has fifths at all. For<br>those that don't (e.g. 13-tET), I proposed a general solution to notate<br>them within the same framework."<br>This is an excellent point, and it cleverly dodges the question of what's<br>an "implicit presumption."  My experience is that when you notate<br>music on a five-line staff  (never mind the names of the notes or<br>exact shape of the accidentals), the immediate presumption created<br>in the minds of the average musician is: "Oh, this is familiar!<br>Here's a  perfect fifth, and here's a major second, and...I guess there<br>are some odd accidentals, but this is really just like 12, isn't it?"<br>No, 13-TET doesn't sound a bit like 12.<br>The problem with notating highly xenharmonic equal temperaments<br>like 13 or 23 on the five-line staff is that the 5-line staff itself<br>carries baggage.  It automatically seduces the unwary observer into<br>assuming that you've got a perfect fifth, major 3rd, &c.  This is an=20<br>*implicit presumption.*  Use the five-line staff *at all*=20<br>and you can't escape creating this illusion.<br>Paul posts:<br>"2. <ETs 9, 10, 23, 22, and 21 cannot be usefully notated using a 5-limit<br>method.> The article shows how to do this. Of course many may prefer the<br>method for ETs with recognizable fifths; see point 1." =20<br>Paul & I disagree over what is meant by "usefully notated."  Clearly,<br>Paul has a different idea of "useful" than do I.  To me, "useful"=20<br>notation is that which most accurately reflects the *sound* of<br>the equal temperament and its fundamental melodic/harmonic<br>paradigms.  Paul Rapoport may mean something different--<br>for instance, he might mean "the notation that most clearly<br>brings out certain abstract structures present in the tuning." =20<br>In any case, let me give you an example: in 21-TET  a *basic*<br>melodic mode is the neutral mode.  Here you're in catch-22 if you<br>stick with the five-line staff and conventional note-names--<br>because if you write the neutral mode 1 4  7  10  13  16  19<br>(scale-steps numbered 1 to 21) as C D E F G A B, you will<br>be bamboozling the person who reads the notation inasmuch<br>as s/he will assume there's a semitone twixt E and F: but in<br>the 7-note neutral mode of 21 all successive notes have the same<br>interval, 171.428 cents.  On the other hand, if you flat the E or<br>sharp the F, your reader will assume that the distance D-Eb<br>or F#-G is smaller than the other steps.  Again, having settled<br>on a five-line staff and conventional note-names, these implicit<br>assumptions are *unavoidable* regardless of which particular=20<br>exotic symbols are used instead of # and b...and thus these<br>implicit assumptions (created unavoidably in the reader) render such=20<br>notation less than useful (again, in my opinion).<br>I should mention that Paul Rapoport knows *vastly* more than I do=20<br>about notating the equal temperaments.  So he'll surely answer what<br>to me seem like serious objections.  My guess is that I'm overlooking<br>something obvious and fairly deep here.=20<br>Paul posts:<br>"3. <ETs generally do not allow themselves to be seen as an "outgrowth" of<br>just intonation.> Many uses of ETs do exactly that, especially the ones<br>that allow recognizable tonal or modal progressions. This does not mean<br>that they grew from JI historically, which is a different and differently<br>arguable point." =20<br>The key words here are "many" and "allow themselves." =20<br>Paul is absolutely correct in implying that some xenharmonic composers<br>use ETs as quasi-JI arrays--Ezra Sims comes to mind, some of the music<br>of Fokker, etc.  But nowadays with retunable synths, most modern<br>xenharmonic composers who use equal temperaments generally<br>use 'em because they like the way each ET "sounds" or because<br>each ET enjoys structural or melodic or harmonic properties which<br>render it musically unique and impressive.  In short, nowadays, if<br>you want JI, you just press a button and retune your synth to JI.<br>So this "quasi-JI" use of ETs has dropped drastically.  Also, with the<br>advent of true JI, composers can hear just how far from JI most<br>equal temperaments sound.  Most ETs sound unique--not like JI.=20<br>Now that all of us can hear that, there's been a steadily growing<br>realization that each ETs is musically unique not for this or that<br>aproximation of this or that JI array but because of its unique<br>internal structural and modal properties... And this awareness<br>on the part of composers and listeners alike has steadily eroded<br>the tendency to hear any particular ET as a JI analog.  (53 and<br>72 remain exceptions in this regard, depending on the ratios.)<br>Paul's objection here may well relate more to theoretical than to<br>compositional concerns.  Certainly listeners react to music in<br>ETs when we perform them in terms of: "Wow, 19 is really smooth<br>but 17 is brilliant and steely," rather than, "Wow, 19 sounds much<br>more just than 17 does."<br>Paul posts:<br>"4. Brian spends some time discussing why small intervals, e.g. 1/17 or<br>1/31 octave don't sound like JI, for no reason I can determine." =20<br>The reason is simple. Throw in a bunch of chromatic 1/31 or 1/17<br>octave intervals in succession and the impression of a quasi-JI<br>construct disappears.  Now that we can get all 31 or 53 or 72<br>or whatever tones per octave at once,  my experience is that=20<br>xen composers/performers are much more willing to sound<br>radically microtonal chromatic passages.  Neil Haverstick is<br>a shining example.  "Hit 'em with tiny intervals" seems to be<br>his watchword, and it's a knockout.  Listen to Neil's superb<br>"Birdwalk" if you want to be rocked back in your seat. This is  very<br>different from the "bad old days" back when the Prophet 5 rev 3<br>was all you had, and you had to choose "12 out of" 31 or "12 out<br>of" 53, etc.  Paul's comments in his numbered rebuttals<br>3 and 4 seem more  appropriate to 12-out-of-X usage than=20<br>all-notes-of-X-at-once microtonal usage. =20<br>Again, for the obvious reason that lots of chromatic successive=20<br>notes destroy any sense of "JI-ness" *even* in a highly JI-like=20<br>ET like 53.<br>Paul posts:<br>"5. <Easley Blackwood's microtonal etudes suffer because he tried to make<br>them all as 12-like as possible.> Not quite; he tried to make them as<br>tonal/modal as possible."  Paul is very close to being accurate here,<br>but his statement is just shy of 100% correct.  In fact Blackwood tried=20<br>to=20<br>make the ETs as tonal/modal as possible *in the Pythagorean framework*--<br>there are tonal/modal constructs entirely *non-Pythagorean.*  Viz.,<br>the neutral mode used by the Kwaiker of Guatamala, the Thais, etc.<br>Blackwood's usage forces the ETs into either major or minor=20<br> melodic modes derived from Pythagorean theories and<br>constructs.  This doesn't work musically for more than half the<br>equal temperaments between 5 and 33 tones per octave.<br>Incidentally, I mentioned that upwards of 40% of=20<br>Blackwood's claims about the ETs were incorrect. =20<br>Here's the rundown:<br>B claims that 21-TET has no recognizable diatonic mode.  [Blackwood,<br>Research Notes, NEH Grant R0-29376-78-0642, 1978-81, pg. 9] This<br>is verifiably wrong, as you can hear for yourself.   Tune up 21 & sound:<br>MAJOR IN 21-TET:  1  5  8  10  13  17  20<br>MINOR IN 21-TET:   1  5  7  10  13  16  19<br>(notes numbered numerically from 1 to 21, Carillo-style)<br>Your ears will end the debate.<br>Blackwood on page 124 of his NEH Grant Report claims that in<br>16-TET "the effect of CEG is that of a minor triad with<br>acceptable thirds,  but a singularly peculiar perfect fifth."<br>[Blackwood, Research Notes, NEH Grant R0-29376-78-0642,=20<br>1978-81, pg. 124]<br>*Nonsense.*  Tune up the triad 1-5-10 (starting at A440 Hz,<br>these are frequencies 400 Hz - 546.417 Hz - 649.803 Hz).<br>Does this triad sound as though it has anything *remotely*<br>akin to a perfect fifth?<br>In fact the triad sounds like discordant diminished chord<br>of some kind.  No perfect fifth is perceptible, Blackwood<br>is simply wrong. But don't take my word for it--again,<br>let your ears decide.<br>In discussing 17-TET, Blackwood states that there is<br>no consonant triad available.  Wrong.  The neutral triad<br>formed by 1-6-11 (again, these are scale steps numbered<br>from 1 to 17, Carillo-style) sounds just fine. =20<br>Blackwood claims that 19 has a recognizable diatonic<br>scale: to me it sounds unacceptably distorted.  The 2/19<br>of a whole-tone leading tone is the Achilles heel of<br>this mode--it just doesn't work at all, and the 9-tone<br>gapped mode 1 4 7 8 9 12 15 18 19 works infinitely<br>better. But let your ears decide.=20<br>Lastly, Blackwood claims that 18-TET allows the<br>construction of various chords which he writes as<br>V,  V7, etc.  This is contrary to what my ears hear,<br>to what common sense tells us.  Rather than creating<br>a sense of tonality, diminished seventh chords *destroy*<br>a sense of tonality. Thus, for Blackwood to claim that<br>(for example) "the V/II harmnies are both complex<br>altered chords with roots missing" (as on pg. 213 of<br>his grant report) and that "the chord in bar 96 is..a<br>minor dominant ninth with a lowered fifth and lowered<br>seventh" and that this creates any sense of tonal<br>harmonic progression...  Preposterous.  When<br>you lower the fifth as much as the 18-TET scale does,<br>it makes no sense to speak of "dominant chords with<br>lowered fifths."  The thing doesn't sound even remotely<br>like a dominant anything, it sounds like a diminished<br>chord and it's discordant as hell. Listen to an 18-TET<br>4:5:6 triad and you'll hear instantly that there is<br>no recognizable fifth, there is no dominant, there<br>is no V chord, there is no sense of tonality.

Is this a functional<br>dominant?<br>So adding up the total, we find that Easley Blackwood<br>has made statements verifiably incorrect (tune up=20<br>your synth, don't take my word for it) about 16, 17,<br> 18, 19 and 21 tone equal temperament.  That's 5 out<br>of the 12 equal temperaments twixt 12 and 24: a<br>40% error rate. =20<br>Paul posts:<br>"6. <A string of MIDI numbers (0 to 127) and a MIDI file...constitutes<br>a notation.> It does, but no one  I know would want to perform or<br>analyze from. Brian goes on to claim that <I reject pieces of music which<br>aren't in traditional notation,> a point which he dreamed up himself."<br>Paul might imagine that I dreamed up this point, but the fact remains<br>that when faced with anything other than an ultra-conservative=20<br>completely common-practice-period notation, Paul's interest<br>appears to drop drastically.  I've seen it happen in person.  If I<br>play Paul a notated piece, he shows real interest--but  play him music<br>notated in a MIDI file and he's apt to say, as he did to me face-to-face,<br>"I can't make anything of this without a score." (1992, personal<br>communication, in person.)<br>This seems a strong bias against accepting or listening critically<br>to music not notated in a quasi-conventional way...but then again,<br>perhaps I misinterpret. =20<br>As to the question of a MIDI file or numerical notation<br>being a notation that "no one I know would want to<br>perform or analyze from," well, Paul knows me, and I've no<br>problems performing or analyzing from such a notation.  So the<br>statement falls short of absolutely strict accuracy. Actually,<br>in my experience numbers are *far* simpler than using note names.=20<br>Bill Schottstaedt and Julian Carillo are two obvious examples of=20<br>superb composers who prefer this kind of notation, and you could<br>make a good argument that all Csound-using computer composers<br>analyze, perform and use numerical notation all the time.  So when<br>Paul says "no one I know" prefers using numerical rather than<br>quasi-ceonventional 5-line-staff-based notation, perhaps it's a=20<br>slight overstatement...<br>Paul posts:<br>"7. <"Essentially no one attends or gives live acoustic concerts any<br>more."> Statements like this lead people on this forum to ignore Brian."<br>This statement is numerically accurate.  The question here is: what<br>is meant by "essentially no one"? =20<br>Let's do the math.  Compare the total number of hours of recorded<br>music played last year with the total number of hours of=20<br>live acoustic concerts played last year.  (Rock concerts don't<br>count since they are nowadays karaoke to a DAT.) If the latter number<br>is C and the former is B, then B/C is indeed essentially zero.<br>Let's consider just one concrete example: DMX is a digital music<br>channel broadcasting 24 hours a day sans commercials.  You pay<br>10 bucks a month to your cable company for it, you get 30<br>channels, and it's CD-quality sound.  24 hours/day*365 days/year<br>*30 channels * 30 million subscribers (at last count, 1995) =3D<br>7.884 BILLION person-hours of listening to recorded music.<br>How does this number of person-hours compare to the total<br>amount of live acoustic music person-hours listened to in 1995?<br>Let's take a guess...say, 200 people per live acoustic concert,<br>maybe 1000 concerts per day across the U.S., say 2 hours<br>per concert, total =3D 200*1000*365*2 =3D 189,800 person-hours<br>of live acoustic concert.<br>Now divide live/recorded person-hours of listening:<br>189,800/(7.884 exp 9) =3D 0.000024<br>Isn't this "essentially zero"?  Paul is being silly here.  He's<br>quibbling.  This is as near zero as makes no difference.<br>Quibbles about how closely 0.000024 approaches zero are<br>obviously superfluous--obviously virtually the music listened<br>to by virtually all the people in the U.S. is recorded music.  Clearly the<br>obvious fact is that by and large 99.999% of the population no<br>longer attends  live concerts of acoustic music.  Essentially all=20<br>music is nowadays heard off CDs, off cassettes, on the radio, or<br>some other recorded form.  To deny this is to discredit yourself<br>by denying the facts.=20<br>Paul posts:<br>"8. <For 25-tET, "a notation which implies that there are more tones than<br>sharped or flatted versions of C, D, E, G, and A proves less than<br>useful."> Sorry, no sale. Keeping to that principle of notation would<br>imply that the only structure in 25-tET is groups of pentatonic scales.<br>But 25 has a quite usable major 3rd and natural 7th, which staying with C<br>D E G A won't reveal adequately." =20<br>The issue in this particular case is what is meant by "less=20<br>than useful."  Clearly my meaning is different from Paul's.=20<br>My definition of "useful" in this case involved bringing to the surface<br>the fundamental pentatonic mode of pitches which remain exactly<br>the same in 5-TET through 45-TET.  Paul meant something else...<br>no doubt we're both right.<br>Paul posts:<br>"9. <Blackwood's (and my) notion that E and F are the same note (in 20, 25,<br>etc., any ET with a 720-cent fifth) is "willful obfuscation."> It is true,<br>however.

Paul is doubtless correct that I don't<br>recognize his point.  I'll have to re-read his article, clearly. Mea culpa.<br>Paul posts:<br>"10. <22-tET has nothing in common with traditional tunings.> Does anyone<br>agree with this?"  This has already been dealt with by Paul Erlich,<br>who also disagrees with Paul.  My claim is overstated: 22-TET has<br>a musically recognizable semitone in common with highly=20<br>Pythagorean tunings, and it shares a near-just 4:5:6.  Over-emphasis<br>is often necessary to get my point across.  Murmur politely and<br>average folks will step on your face as they walk over you without<br>noticing--shout and they'll pay attention. (Shout the truth as they'll<br>grab for a noose, but that's a different matter...)<br>Paul posts:<br>"11. <The notation of distinctly un-Pythagorean ETs in this manner doesn't<br>work, e.g. 13- and 14-tET.> My solutions for these and others like them<br>reveal exactly what he says is lacking. For example, there is no major or<br>minor third in 14, and no perfect fifth in 13: this emerges from what I<br>suggest be done to notate these ETs." =20<br>The issue here is whether the fact that the musical nature of=20<br>these ETs eventually "emerges" at the end of a lengthy process of<br>elaborate notation is sufficient to do musical justice to these exotic<br>ETs.  Paul clearly feels it is, and I clearly don't.  Reasonable people<br>can disagree.<br>Paul posts:<br>"12. <14-tET is nothing more than two sets of 7-equal.> This comment is<br>similar to Brian's comment about 25 being nothing more than 5 sets of<br>5-equal, and equally incorrect. Blackwood's 14-note etude and mine in 25<br>should be enough to show that." =20<br>Actually, Paul and I are both correct here.  My intended<br>subtext is that melodically the neutral mode is the primary melodic<br>structure in 14, not a diatonic major or diatonic minor scale.  In that<br>context my statement is correct; Paul's point is presumably that other<br>musically modes exist in 14 (and 25).  His statement is also correct.<br>Paul posts:<br>"13. <35-tET is a nightmare to notate.> Anyone who reads my article is<br>invited to determine that this is not so. If anyone wishes, I'll apply the<br>method I've evolved to that, since I didn't illustrate it in my article.<br>It is a curious case, but by no means dreadful."  Paul is speaking<br>notationally--I'm speaking musically.  35 is notationaly dire because<br>it boasts two "perfect fifths" about equally far from the just 3/2.<br>The ear thus tends to identify one or the other as "the" perfect fifth<br>depending on context--if you use a primarily 7-TET context, the 685.714<br>cent fifth sounds "right" and if you use the 5-TET context, the<br>720-cent fifths sounds "right." My experience is that no known notation<br>captures this musical reality.  On the other hand  Paul's  notation surely<br>has subtleties and advantages I've not yet appreciated..I'll have=20<br>to study his Xenharmonikon 16 article again.<br>Paul posts:<br>"14. <Sharps and flats are most useful in tunings which sound like they<br>have semitones.> This is too vague for me. Besides, sharps and flats<br>aren't defined in terms of semitones, but at least initially as 7 perfect<br>fifths (up or down), in a Pythagorean sense, anyhow. What interests me<br>most are cases where the fifths are so far from just that the sharp and<br>flat end up denoting either fairly large or fairly small intervals."<br>On reflection, Paul is right.  My language in this regard<br>is too vague.<br>Paul posts:<br>"15. <"The use of sharps and flats in 19 is willf<br>=D4 perverse."> There are<br>many counterexamples to this categorical denial. Of all ETs, 19-tET is<br>closest to 12."  This is musically not true in my experience.  22 sounds<br>to my ears much closer to 12 than 19, because the 1/11 octave interval<br>sounds much closer to a semitone than does a 2/19 octave interval.=20<br>19 is a third-tone scale, with whole tones and thirds of tones.<br>Thus, the leading tone in 19 must be either 2/19 a (too flat) or<br>1/19 a (too sharp); by comparison 1/11 octave works just fine as a=20<br>leading tone in 22.<br>The other issue here is that notating 19 with #, b, 5-line staff &<br>traditional note names *badly* confuses xenharmonists, because the<br>12-TET conditioning is so strong.  I've seen it happen.  Because<br>everything is notated with *exactly* the same symbols as used=20<br>in 12-TET, xenharmonists stumble and stumble again when<br>trying to interpret this...yes...this perverse notation for 19-TET. =20<br>Oddball accidentals or different note names (Yasser's suggestion)<br>really seem infinitely less confusing to me and to most folks<br>I've worked with in playing 19-TET pieces.<br>Finally, Paul posts:<br>"It's a discussion about matters of notation, which I see in a=20<br>broader context than one of convenience or necessity: a context=20<br>which may reveal structures and at the same time be<br>useful for all the things notation is intended for."<br>Wise and sensible.<br>Incidentally, Paul, John Chalmers told me that you studied with<br>Easley Blackwood.

For  a number of<br>reasons, this makes sense--even though the<br>cassette itself is now 7 years old.<br>First, this tape is an extremely important<br>aural document in the history of post-Partch<br>just intonation.  Prior to 1989 many individual<br>tapes were available, but there was no <br>convincing proof that a widespread movement<br>toward JI existed in America.  Individual<br>composers' JI tapes could be dismissed by<br>bigoted New York critics of the head-in-the-sand<br>Paul Griffiths school--"this JI composer is a<br>fringe lunatic," "that JI composer is a flake,"<br>and so on, and so forth. Partch himself was<br>treated this way until the 80s. (After all, The New Yorker<br>music critic described Ivan Vyshnegradsky as<br>"almost insane" in a 1995 review.)  But once the<br>JIN issued its compilation cassette, it became<br>impossible for the New York critical circle-jerk<br>buddy system to deny the existence of a<br>grass-roots just intonation movement of long<br>standing on the West Coast. <br>Second, the JIN cassette "Rational Music" is an<br>important document tracing the early history<br>of just intonation on pre- and post-MIDI<br>digital synthesizers.  Many of the compositions<br>on "Rational Music" date from just before and<br>just after the advent of MIDI, and they are<br>therefore an invaluable historical record of how<br>the first generation of mass-market digital JI'ers <br>wrestled with the problems of MIDI, computer<br>sequencers and keyboards designed for 12<br>equal tones but retuned to just intonation.<br>(This problem is one with which many of us continue<br>to wrestle today.)<br>Third, "Rational Music" was the Just Intonation<br>Network's announcement of its musical position.<br>Inevitably, all movements stake out a place in<br>the musical spectrum--IRCAM has consistently<br>placed itself in the post-Webern serialist camp<br>and has thus marginalized itself nearly out of<br>existence; all the award-winning IRCAM composers<br>use Forte/Rahn/Morrison pitch-class set theory<br>in their compositions. CCRMA has consistently placed <br>itself in the American neocalssical camp; Dartmouth<br>in the Ussachevksy/Luening American electronic music<br>camp, which lies midway between the extremes of the<br>French ORTF musique concrete and the Germand <br>Darmstadt lab-oscillator-and-filter school--and so on.  <br>With the selection of pieces on "Rational Music" the JIN<br>placed itself squarely in the neoclassical algorithmic<br>camp with this tape, reflecting by and large the<br>interests of the JIN members in the San Francisco<br>Bay area.  This movement has since flowered,<br>while the Eurocentric12-TET serialist acoustic<br>movement has continued to flail and twitch<br>like a chicken with its head cut off--albeit<br>more feebly now than ever before.  <br>(Remember that New York is part of Europe,<br>and the Bay area up through the Northwest is<br>part of the Pacific Rim.  Then you can understand<br>why New York composers were so Eurocentric<br>and why the American gamelan movement began<br>in the Bay area.) <br>--<br>The first piece on side 1 of "Rational Music For An<br>Irrational World" is "Dance of the Testifiers" by<br>Erling Wold.  This appears to be a synthesizer-and-<br>sampler arrangement of  "incidental music for<br>the theatre work `The Islamic Republic Of Las<br>Vegas.'"  The composition strongly resembles the<br>work of Lou Harrison, and dates from 1985. As<br>has been mentioned in prior posts, Erling Wold is<br>a talented composer as well as a polymath, and<br>this composition is as impressive and delightful<br>as the rest of his oeuvre.  Especially notable: Wold's<br>success in teasing an expressive, human-sounding<br>result from his MIDI sequences.<br>"Prelude and Fugue for the Rest of Us" by Jules <br>Siegel was performed "by the composer's original<br>IBM PC software which models human performance."<br>This composition won 3rd place in the Third Coast<br>New Music Project Microtonal Music Festival in 1988.<br>Despite a slightly mechanical-sounding performance,<br>the composition comes across as a tuneful and impressive<br>extension of Bachian contrapuntal techniques into the<br>realm of extended JI.<br>"Loved and Lost" by Eric S. Ridgway was composed,<br>performed and recorded in January of 1986 using<br>4 multi-tracked acoustic JI guitar tape parts. This<br>piece is fascinating because it is a species of<br>composition which could not have existed prior to<br>the advent of cheap multi-track tape machines. <br>It works well, although the recording quality betrays<br>the age of the composition.<br>"Form For Just Intonation" by Norbert Oldani, is <br>particularly interesting for 2 reasons: first, <br>Oldani is a long-time JI and ET theorist whose<br>theoretical work is undeservedly little-known<br>and whose compositions are  ( even more<br>undeservedly) less widely known.  And second, Oldani<br>realizes his composition with a peculiar early<br>digital synthesizer: Passport Design's Soundchaser<br>System.  This synth produced 8-bit digital sound<br>with 256-point additive synthesis wavetables. <br>On 2 cards plugged into an Apple II+ computer,<br>the Soundchaser was much more programmable<br>than most modern digital synths--moreover, due<br>to the digital filters on the DACs, the sound<br>output was reasonably hi-fi up to about 12 khz.<br>Oldani's composition takes maximum advantage<br>of the unique digital timbres of the Soundchaser<br>system: basically, you could get dynamic additive<br>digital synthesis by burning polyphony.  In this<br>regard the Soundchaser was infinitely more <br>flexible than modern digital synths, and Oldani<br>coaxes a remarkable variety of bell-like, string-<br>like and analog-synth-type timbres from his<br>system.  The piece works well, and is one of the <br>very few recordings now extant of a microtonal<br>composition on an entirely microcomputer-based<br>pre-MIDI digital synthesis system.<br>"City of Trout" by Thomas J. Dougherty, sounds<br>remarkably like much of the music being done <br>today by the San Francisco Bay area Max<br>algorithmic composers.  By and large the American<br>algorithmic composition movement came out of<br>the Bay area, and this is an early and elegant<br>example--one of the best pieces on the tape.<br>"I am Curious (George)" by Carola Anderson is<br>also noteworthy because it clearly represents<br>the first MIDI efforts by a JI composer who had<br>earlier worked exclusively with acoustic<br>ensembles.  (This is true of many of the Bay Area<br>JI community: David Doty and many other influential<br>SF JIN members initially started their xenharmonic<br>explorations as American gamelan performers and<br>builders, strongly influenced by Lou Harrison's<br>justly tuned gamelans.  Thus most of these early<br>JIN members gained their first compositional<br>experience with live acoustic ensembles, rather<br>than with digital synths and computers.)<br>This composition succeeds well, and doesn't<br>sound "stiff" or overquantized.  David Doty is to <br>be congratulated for serving as "MIDI guru" to<br>Carola Anderson on this composition.  The results<br>are musically impressive.<br>"Two Fragments of Ancient Greek Music" are<br>FB-01 HMSL-produced Greek melodic fragments.<br>The timbres sound not so great and the performance<br>is  somewhat mechanical, but since the main interest <br>here is historical and musciological, that doesn't <br>matter at all.  John Chalmers once again demonstrates<br>his scholarship by resurrecting these 2500-year-old<br>musical fragments from oblivion and letting us<br>hear them.<br>"Air for the Poet" by Lou Harrison is a fine acoustic<br>recording of a typically Handelian neoclassical<br>composition.  As always, it's difficult to hear anything<br>xenharmonic in the piece.<br>"Time Auscultations" by William Alves is up to the<br>usual high standard of this fine composer's oeuvre:<br>in this case, samples of the internal motors of<br>robots are ingeniously used to create a just <br>intonation soundscape.  Alves is one of the most<br>adroit composers at the forefront of the movement<br>to combine cutting-edge digital signal processing<br>techniques with classical just intonation tunings.<br>The result is a unique and splendidly musical blend <br>of the modern & the classical.<br>SIDE TWO:<br>"Paradigms Lost" by David B. Doty is his "fantasy<br>of what might have happened if psychedelic-era<br>rock bands had pursued their interests in the exotic,<br>free from the constraints imposed by the record<br>industry."  To thse old ears, this composition sounds<br>like the best piece of music on the tape.  It's a<br>stunning demonstation of how vividly musical just<br>intonation can be, while at the same time whipping<br>the listener through some truly crunchy JI<br>modulations & intervals.<br>Doty's intent is also a worthy one: we in the<br>Southern California Microtonal Group have also<br>produced a a subset of compositions which<br>in effect take up where the psychedelic rock<br>bands of the late 60s left off.  This is a<br>musical direction utterly disdained by the<br>so-called "serious contemporary music"<br>theorists and critics (many of whom cannot<br>be taken seriously), but it's a musical<br>direction which promises endless musical <br>rewards to the adventurous microtonal<br>explorer...as Neil Haverstick has recently<br>pointed out.   <br>I have in prior posts mentioned that David Doty<br>is a superbly talented composer: this composition<br>offers yet further proof of that fact.  "Paradigms<br>Lost" alone justifies spending the money on the JIN<br>tape.<br>"Analogs" by Glenn Frantz, uses a MIDIfied<br>Commodore 64 computer with a Yamaha TX81Z.<br>The composition is theoretically interesting since it<br>uses not a fixed scale, but instead a fluid set<br>of pitches separated by the 81/80.  This kind <br>of "floating just intonation" would be impossible<br>with an impractically large acoustic ensemble,<br>but with a computer it becomes easy.  Musically, this<br>piece is very effective, and works well.  Another<br>historically fascinating example of early JI<br>composition: it's sobering to realize that with<br>the advent of the Commodore 64 and the TX81Z<br>and FB-01, for about 5 years in the mid-1980s<br>even dirt-poor composers could get into digitally<br>sequenced computer-controlled xenharmonic<br>music for an investment of under 700 or 800<br>dollars U.S.  This is no longer true: today, the<br>minimum cost of a retunable digital synthesizer<br>has climbed above $1500 and new computers<br>aren't cheap, either.  (Of course, used IBM XTs<br>and TX81Zs can be bought second-hand for<br>next to nothing, but my point is that there are<br>no NEW synths or computers to fill the under-$1000-<br>for-the-whole-schmeer niche.)  In my judgment,<br>this lack of dirt-cheap retunable synths is a<br>big gap in the market, and some synthesizer<br>company will make a bunch 'o bucks if they<br>can fill it. (Computer sound cards don't count,<br>since they're not portable stand-alone units.)<br>"Threnody" by Dudley Duncan is a positively<br>19th-century-like essay in JI.  Very nice piece,<br>and an early 1988 example of a composition<br>using Partch's 43-tone scale(!)<br>"Guitar Suite" by David Canright demonstrates<br>another talent of the multifacted math<br>instructor.  Canright is not only a fine JI<br>theorist and a mathematically adept mind,<br>but a skilled guitar player & composer.<br>"Study #3" by Ralph David Hill is a virtuoso<br>example of something from nothing. This<br>piece was done on Hill's home-built Quadvox,<br>a synthesizer built literally from the <br>ground up out of raw chips and microcode<br>in the early 1980s.  Almost anyone else<br>would be intimidated by the mere prospect<br>of such a task: Dave Hill not only completed<br>the project, but managed to make the results<br>sound musical.  (The liner notes are not<br>accurate for this piece: I know Dave HIll's<br>work intimately, and this composition was<br>clearly not done with his Cro-Magnon resynthesis<br>system.)<br>"Temple of Eyes" is a very skillful new-agey<br>JI composition using sampled and synthesized<br>sounds.  Robert Rich, the composer, is also<br>an influential programmer: he wrote the JICalc<br>software which is used by so many xenharmonists<br>to retune their synths.  An excellent piece of music.<br>"Zenharmonics 2.1 (excerpt) by Gino Robair,<br>proves less interesting. A bevy of guitars all<br>played with e-bows comes off as too much guitar<br>and too static a drone.  Robair's percussion music<br>is much more interesting; it's a pity none of it<br>is included here.<br>"Ulysses Departs From the Edge of the World" by<br>Harry Partch is the only recording I know of this<br>composition.  Apparently it originally appeared<br>on a long-departed LP or CD called "New Music<br>For Trumpet" by Jack Logan.

By the 1940s Schouten et al. thought pitch<br>perception took place entirely in the 8th nerve,<br>and by the 1970s Wightman, Goldstein, et al. thought<br>pitch perception took place much farther inside<br>the brain via a computer-like mathematical<br>algorithm.  The most recent (1991, 1995) pitch<br>perception theories assume that hearing takes<br>place in a complex neural net distributed throughout<br>the higher brain loci.  Instead of an algorithmic loop,<br>these spectral network theories have more of the<br>flavor of a cake being baked--you can specify<br>pretty precisely the ingredients and procedures<br>required  to bake a cake with the required <br>characteristics, but the math of baking a cake<br>molecule-by-molecule is imponderable--it's a <br>highly parallel and highly non-linear process<br>in which the main events are thermodynamic rather<br>than algorithmic (as in neural nets, whose distribution<br>of nodal weights is more usefully viewed from the<br>point of view of entropy than of algorithms).<br>Notice, first, that successive investigators have<br>chased the "location" of pitch perception farther<br>and farther up the inner ear and into the brain,<br>until today there's no "location" at all other<br>than a large set of ganglia spread throughout<br>the Sylvian fissure.<br>Second, notice that each era described pitch<br>perception in terms of the highest technology<br>then available: in 400 B.C., a vibrating<br>drum, in the 1840s a mechanical Fourier<br>transformer, in the 1940s a time-based<br>electronic autocorrelator, in the 1970s<br>a complex computer program operating as<br>a "central processor," in the 1990s a highly<br>parallel neural net.<br><br>--mclaren<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 01:15 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22013; Thu, 5 Dec 1996 16:02:55 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA21950<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id HAA21562; Thu, 5 Dec 1996 07:02:51 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 5 Dec 1996 07:02:51 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961205145941_71670.2576_HHB56-3@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>(amb) Re: SUBJECT</h1><h3><a id=3389 href="#3389">ðŸ”—</a>DMB5561719@aol.com</h3><span>8/10/1996 8:44:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>In a message dated 96-08-10 02:03:55 EDT, you write:<br><br>> > okay okay, after much foot dragging I've gone ahead and made the change,<br>> > hopefully this post should have an "(amb)" in the subject line.<br>> <br>> For me, this is just six characters taken from the visible Subject<br>> header.

If you liked 22, you<br>rejected 19 violently--or vice versa.<br>At least one tuning forum member has decried 22-TET<br>as "slimy," which presumably indicates a negative<br>reaction to 22-TET.  For my part, I prefer 22 to 19.<br>Ivor pointed out that such consistently binary and strong<br>preferences (hardly anyone likes both tunings equally, or<br>is indifferent to both) might indicate personality traits.<br>Ivor suggested that something like the Minnesota Multiphasic<br>might be done with tunings, rather than written cues.<br>Expanding on that idea, it occurs to me that personality<br>types might be distinguished by, say, preference for 7/5<br>as opposed to the geometric mean neutral third.<br>This is highly speculative.  Anyone care to test a group<br>of students with both Minnesota Multiphasic *and*<br>tuning preference and see if there's a correlation twixt<br>various personality traits and various tuning preferences?<br>In correspondence, I recently ventured the hypothesis<br>that folks who like primarily near-just equal <br>temperaments like 31-TET, 19-TET, 22-TET, 41-TET,<br>53-TET, etc., might fall toward the left-brain purist<br>control-freak end of the personality spectrum, while<br>folks who mainly enjoy wildly non-twelvular equal<br>temepraments like 13-TET, 11-TET, 9-TET, 23-TET, etc.<br>might fall toward the right-brain intuitive New Age<br>hippy-dippy end of the personality spectrum.<br>Again, this is mere persiflage and wild speculation.<br>However,  the fact remains that people do tend to <br>fall in distinct groups as regards their response to<br>different classes of tunings.  So perhaps there's<br>a personality component involved.<br>It'd be fascinating to play real microtonal music,<br>tally preferences, and compare the results to<br>personality test scores.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 1 Sep 1996 07:28 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11419; Sun, 1 Sep 1996 07:29:35 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11336<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA07219; Sat, 31 Aug 1996 22:29:33 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 31 Aug 1996 22:29:33 -0700<br>Message-Id: <3229384B.D6C@sprynet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3516 href="#3516">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/1996 9:01:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject:  30 years of gibberish<br>--<br>My statement of what has long been regarded<br>as obvious fact sparked real fury in this tuning<br>forum.

Yet it echoes precisely my<br>own.  <br>How can any of my posts *possibly* be considered<br>"outrageous" when they merely repeat sentiments <br>*expressed and agreed upon for more than 30 years?*<br>In "Some Problems Raised by the Rhythmic Procedures<br>in Milton Babbitt's Composition for Twelve<br>Instruments," Perspectives of New Music, Vol. 4,<br>No. 2, 1965, Peter Westergaard points out that "Such<br>a resultant rhythm has just as little to do with ordering<br>the sets as the previous example, and nothing to do with<br>their contours.

[Krenek, Ernst, "A composer's<br>Influences," Perspectives of New Music, 3(1), 1964, pg. 41]<br>Again, this is a near-verbatim reiteration of points made in <br>my own posts.<br>More recently, William Thompson has summarized the<br>process of systematic post-1948 academic obfuscation  <br>and pretentiousness in his book Schoenberg's Error: "The <br>flurry of enthusiasms of [the 1950s] centered not around <br>Schoenberg, whom Boulez had declared `dead,' but around<br>Webern. From the movement's inception in the United<br>States, the newly-influential academic segment of the<br>population became prominent, especially among themselves.<br>In time it demonstrated how the lives of artworks (whose<br>dependence on the auspices of higher education had in <br>times past been negligible) could be sustained by<br>artificial means beyond normal expentency, regardless of<br>their direct aesthetic vibrancy.<br>"The era's post-Viennese energy induced a remarkable<br>production of analytical dissections and speculative<br>tracts--more those than public performances of music.<br>The torrent of words and numbers and fomulae unleashed<br>about Schoenberg's methods, about their more thorough<br>exploitation by Webern, and then about subsequent<br>extensions (like those of Boulez and babbitt) to other<br>musical dimensions, produced one of the most bountiful <br>crops of verbiage ever harvested in the cause of art.<br>"The movement also habored a hidden cul de sac for<br>the unwary.  Its participants produced a fair amount<br>of theoretical "how to..."  composers' shoptalk, which<br>tended to be preoccupied with manipulations of notes<br>as permutable collections, rather than with interpretive <br>descriptions of phenomenal things. So the unassailable<br>and unchanging concern of musicians for the art's aural <br>ontology became secondary to the orderings of serialized<br>particles.  Permutations, reciprocal relativities,<br>combinatoriality, segmentation, source sets, derived <br>sets, intersections, adjacencies, partitions, germ cells,<br>aggregates, pitch qualia, hexachords, mathematical<br>models, complementation modulus-12, pitch (or note) <br>cells, and the like dominated the literature of Serialism.<br>(..)  "Words have special powers: *permutation* had an<br>inimitable ring of profundity, and *modulus-12* was<br>sheer magic.  Both seemed to guarantee conceptual <br>precision and mathematical certainty; both hinted<br>at the flinty `rigor' of the hard sciences. Such<br>terminology prompted a comforting fantasy in the <br>1960s and 1970s; it allowed us metaphorically to<br>put on laboratory smocks and pretend to be<br>`genuine scientists,' the Einsteins of harmony."<br>[Thompson, William, "Schoenberg's Error," 1991, <br>pg. 184]<br>Great as was the outrage that greeted my mention<br>of what has for 30 years been recognized as fact--<br>namely, that dexterity in the manipulation of<br>words  replaced skill in the manipulation of sound <br>among the musical so-called "cognitive elite" from<br>1948 onwards--even greater was the fury that <br>greeted my casual acknowledgement of Boulez, <br>Cage, Stockhausen, et al., as incompetent <br>con  artists.  <br>Yet this too has been exposed as obvious fact <br>for more than 30 years.<br>In discussing the first 6 issues of Die Reihe,<br>touchstone of the Darmstadt School of music<br>and supreme model for all subsequent jargon-<br>laden music theory, John Backus  points out: <br>"The baffling technical language we <br>encounter contains a  considerable amount of what <br>appears to be scientific terminology--definitions, <br>acoustical and physical terms, etc. (..) We may therefore <br>examine Die Reihe with a critical eye...  We wish to see <br>if the scientific terminology is properly used, to see if <br>the charts, graphs and tables have any real significance, <br>and to determine the technical competence of the<br>material from the scientific standpoint. (..)<br>"The first article in V. I by Herbert Eimert demonstrates<br>the technical style adopted by most of the <br>contributors. [Eimert] states (I, 3):<br>`The composer is required to have a certain amount<br>of acoustical knowledge' and proceeds to define<br>six categories of electronic sound...  His definitions,<br>however, besides being difficult to understand, are<br>not acoustically accurate. His first one, tone, is what<br>is known in acoustics as a `simple tone' (his<br>statement that it is unknown to traditional music is<br>not entirely true; flutes and clarinets played softly<br>produce nearly simple tones, for example, as do <br>tuning forks).  [Eimert's] second definition, note, is <br>what is called in acoustics a `complex tone'... <br>"On the other hand, in number four, `noise,' he states<br>` only blank noise which fills an acoustic region<br>may be determined in position.'  This statement<br>does not make sense; if by `blank noise' he means<br>what is now called `white noise,' which contains<br>equal amounts of energy in each unit frequency<br>band width, and if by `position' he means pitch,'<br>then `blank noise' has no `position.' If  `white noise'<br>is filtered to give it the attribute of pitch, <br>it is no longer `white.'  Finally, [Eimert's] fifth category,<br>chord (note complex), is hardly a definition at all.<br>Taken all together, the definitions are very poor<br>examples from the standpoint of conciseness,<br>clarity, or accuracy.<br>"Eimert himself thus appears to be somewhat <br>deficient in the acoustical knowledge now required<br>of the composer.  Since he does not seem to have a<br>clear idea himself of the meaning of the terms he<br>is trying to define, it is not surprising that his<br>definitions are inadequate...  The remainder of [Eimert's]<br>article is for the most part impossible to follow,<br>but since we now see that this is not due to our<br>ignorance of the supposedly necessary acoustical<br>background, we need not concern ourselves further<br>with it. (..) <br>"H. Pousseur adopts a technical style in his <br>contribution.  (..) The definition is too diffuse to <br>quote in full; it has no perceptible beginning nor<br>ending.  Considerable study of it has failed<br>so far to decipher what he is trying to say; it <br>remains quite incomprehensible even after <br>allowing for considerable distortion in the <br>meanings of the technical terms used.  The <br>term 'index of rationality' has no discoverable<br>connection with any concept in acoustics.<br>"The remainder of Pousseur's article follows<br>the example set above.  Trying to understand<br>it is most frustrating to one with merely a<br>technical training in acoustics and music. <br>`Further difficulties were raised in the coordination<br>of preselected quantities with a durational<br>ordering.'  Here is a beautiful example of <br>unintelligibility  `Though they were theoretically<br>correct, they did not have the anticipated<br>effect.'  Correct by what theory?  And so on.<br>"What is being described is basically the process<br>of recording sounds on tape. It is quite possible to<br>describe this process in a manner that can be<br>understood by a physicist with acoustical <br>training.  It should be possible to describe it<br>in simple enough terms so that even a musician<br>with a relatively amall amount of acoustical <br>knowledge could follow what is being done. <br>Pousseur's discussion is only bewildering, and<br>demonstrates his lack of understanding of the<br>subject.<br>"The article by Paul Gredinger states (I, 42) 'the<br>basis of our work remains within the domain of<br>physics...' while remaining unintelligible to<br>the physicist. The word `proportion,' for<br>example, is one which has a specific meaning in<br>physics; it is used a score of times in the article, <br>but never in its accustomed scientific meaning.<br>(..) "Karlheinz Stockhausen contributes a article<br>of forbiddingly technical appearance.  (..) What<br>he means by `statistic' variation is not known;<br>his later discussion of the term (I, 48) only <br>confuses matters further.<br>"His subsequent discussion becomes more and more<br>inspired; mention is made of `harmonic, sub-harmonic,<br>and chromatic ptich-scales,' `spectral composition,'<br>`line- and band-spectra,' and so forth.  The climax is<br>reached in a paragraph which must be quoted in full<br>to be appreciated (I, 47):<br>`Differentiation of the intended permutation of timbres<br>is obtained from the complexity resulting from the<br>simultaneous combination of the six formant regions<br>within one sound process, from the varying of the <br>elements or groups of elements, in all their components,<br>according to the series and of coordinating a special <br>intervallic scale of partials or of medium frequency <br>width ratios in each formant octave.' - Stockhausen<br>"This is formidable language.  What are the six<br>formant regions?  What is an intervallic scale of<br>partials?  or a medium frequency width ratio?  What<br>is a formant octave?  None of these phrases has<br>been used or defined previously.  The individual words <br>have perfectly well-defined scientific meanings, but <br>are combined in ways that make no sense as acoustical<br>language. The paragraph quoted is an excellent example<br>of technical jargon without technical meaning. (..)<br>"We conclude that Stockhausen's technical language is<br>his own invention, using terms stolen from acoustics<br>but without their proper acoustical meanings, and that<br>the technical jargon he has developed is designed mostly<br>to impress the reader and to hide the fact that he has<br>only the most meager knowledge of acoustics."<br>[Backus, John, "Die Reihe--A Scientific Evaluation,"<br>Perspectives of New Music, Vol. 1, No. 1, 1962, pp. <br>160-171]<br>Ladies and gentlemen, there *is* a term which describes <br>the use of "technical jargon..designed mostly to impress <br>the reader and hide the fact that [the user] has only the <br>most meager knowledge of acoustics."  <br>The term is "scam."<br>Such scams were used to sell snake oil in the 1890s,<br>Florida swamp-land in the 1920s, junk bonds in the 1980s,<br>and derivative stock options in the 1990s.

I've simply reiterated these obvious and<br>long-recognized facts because of the astounding persistence<br>of gullibility and naivete in successive generations of <br>theorists and music students.  Just as urban legends like<br>"alligators in the sewers" have long since been disproven<br>and recognized as fantasies, yet continue to circulate among<br>young and old in the form of stories "everyone knows are true,"<br>in the same way the gibberish and jargon of the 1950s music<br>theorists, long recognized as meaningless jabberwocky,<br>*continues* to circulate like a turd that won't flush.  It's a kind<br>of musical Gresham's Law: gibberish drives out sensible<br>rational discussion in modern music theory.<br>My statements in this regard have been recognized as fact for<br>more more thirty years, and the frenzied reaction to my<br>posts which accurately describe Cage, Boulez, et al. as <br>inept con artists...well, the reaction can only be described <br>as the reflexive twitch of a patient with brain death.<br>And what does ANY of this have to do with microtonality?<br>Well  might you ask, kiddies.<br>The sad fact is that all too many members of this tuning<br>forum have grown up spouting the kind of musical <br>glossolalia decried by Backus, by Krenek,<br>by Thompson, et alia.

Anyone can now<br>disseminate valuable ideas about music theory to<br>a wide public--costly paper is no longer required,<br>expensive subsidy-press music magazines need no<br>longer be run through costly binderies. Thus  it is now<br>no longer possible to shut out uncredentialed but<br>insightful music theorists by refusing publication <br>on the basis of their supposed lack of academic <br>qualifications; they can publish their insights on <br>forums like this one.  It is now no longer possible <br>to silence critics of the 12-TET status quo by denying <br>them print space in  prestigious music journals; they <br>can post incisive critiques on forums like this one.  It <br>is now no longer possible to crush unknown composers<br>who are not members of the proper elite clique of<br>academia by refusing them access to sophisticated<br>hardware and software, because *everyone* has<br>access to awesomely sophisticated hardware and<br>software nowadays.<br>As a result, the only criterion for judging musical<br>value is increasingly: *musical talent.*<br>This explains the fury and hatred which has greeted<br>my posts...

Pauls' achievement is<br>considerable, and the article valuable, for three reasons: [1] Paul<br>appears to be the first theorist who has put together an integrated &<br>coherent notation which can apply not just to a limited range of<br>ETs, but to all of 'em; [2] He has generalized Blackwood's procedures<br>(as when B'wood used every other note from 26 to notate 13) to<br>regularize the notation of equal temperaments in which either<br>the limma =3D the apotome, or in which the neutral mode is the=20<br>predominant melodic paradigm; [3] Paul's approach is open-ended<br>enough and flexible enough to admit of considerable expansion,<br>potentially to other systems than those he considers in his<br>article.<br>All together, Paul's article "The Notation of Equal Temperaments"<br>is among the most impressive and theoretically dextrous=20<br>written on the subject.<br>That said, permit me to respond to some of Paul's wise and<br>insightful comments:<br>Paul posts:<br>"1. Brian says that <I have an "implicit presumption" that one ought to<br>relate "all the especially 12-like tunings with good fifths."> I don't.<br>The basing of a notation system on fifths is all I did, whether or not<br>those fifths are good or bad, or whether an ET has fifths at all. For<br>those that don't (e.g. 13-tET), I proposed a general solution to notate<br>them within the same framework."<br>This is an excellent point, and it cleverly dodges the question of what's<br>an "implicit presumption."  My experience is that when you notate<br>music on a five-line staff  (never mind the names of the notes or<br>exact shape of the accidentals), the immediate presumption created<br>in the minds of the average musician is: "Oh, this is familiar!<br>Here's a  perfect fifth, and here's a major second, and...I guess there<br>are some odd accidentals, but this is really just like 12, isn't it?"<br>No, 13-TET doesn't sound a bit like 12.<br>The problem with notating highly xenharmonic equal temperaments<br>like 13 or 23 on the five-line staff is that the 5-line staff itself<br>carries baggage.  It automatically seduces the unwary observer into<br>assuming that you've got a perfect fifth, major 3rd, &c.  This is an=20<br>*implicit presumption.*  Use the five-line staff *at all*=20<br>and you can't escape creating this illusion.<br>Paul posts:<br>"2. <ETs 9, 10, 23, 22, and 21 cannot be usefully notated using a 5-limit<br>method.> The article shows how to do this. Of course many may prefer the<br>method for ETs with recognizable fifths; see point 1." =20<br>Paul & I disagree over what is meant by "usefully notated."  Clearly,<br>Paul has a different idea of "useful" than do I.  To me, "useful"=20<br>notation is that which most accurately reflects the *sound* of<br>the equal temperament and its fundamental melodic/harmonic<br>paradigms.  Paul Rapoport may mean something different--<br>for instance, he might mean "the notation that most clearly<br>brings out certain abstract structures present in the tuning." =20<br>In any case, let me give you an example: in 21-TET  a *basic*<br>melodic mode is the neutral mode.  Here you're in catch-22 if you<br>stick with the five-line staff and conventional note-names--<br>because if you write the neutral mode 1 4  7  10  13  16  19<br>(scale-steps numbered 1 to 21) as C D E F G A B, you will<br>be bamboozling the person who reads the notation inasmuch<br>as s/he will assume there's a semitone twixt E and F: but in<br>the 7-note neutral mode of 21 all successive notes have the same<br>interval, 171.428 cents.  On the other hand, if you flat the E or<br>sharp the F, your reader will assume that the distance D-Eb<br>or F#-G is smaller than the other steps.  Again, having settled<br>on a five-line staff and conventional note-names, these implicit<br>assumptions are *unavoidable* regardless of which particular=20<br>exotic symbols are used instead of # and b...and thus these<br>implicit assumptions (created unavoidably in the reader) render such=20<br>notation less than useful (again, in my opinion).<br>I should mention that Paul Rapoport knows *vastly* more than I do=20<br>about notating the equal temperaments.  So he'll surely answer what<br>to me seem like serious objections.  My guess is that I'm overlooking<br>something obvious and fairly deep here.=20<br>Paul posts:<br>"3. <ETs generally do not allow themselves to be seen as an "outgrowth" of<br>just intonation.> Many uses of ETs do exactly that, especially the ones<br>that allow recognizable tonal or modal progressions. This does not mean<br>that they grew from JI historically, which is a different and differently<br>arguable point." =20<br>The key words here are "many" and "allow themselves." =20<br>Paul is absolutely correct in implying that some xenharmonic composers<br>use ETs as quasi-JI arrays--Ezra Sims comes to mind, some of the music<br>of Fokker, etc.  But nowadays with retunable synths, most modern<br>xenharmonic composers who use equal temperaments generally<br>use 'em because they like the way each ET "sounds" or because<br>each ET enjoys structural or melodic or harmonic properties which<br>render it musically unique and impressive.  In short, nowadays, if<br>you want JI, you just press a button and retune your synth to JI.<br>So this "quasi-JI" use of ETs has dropped drastically.  Also, with the<br>advent of true JI, composers can hear just how far from JI most<br>equal temperaments sound.  Most ETs sound unique--not like JI.=20<br>Now that all of us can hear that, there's been a steadily growing<br>realization that each ETs is musically unique not for this or that<br>aproximation of this or that JI array but because of its unique<br>internal structural and modal properties... And this awareness<br>on the part of composers and listeners alike has steadily eroded<br>the tendency to hear any particular ET as a JI analog.  (53 and<br>72 remain exceptions in this regard, depending on the ratios.)<br>Paul's objection here may well relate more to theoretical than to<br>compositional concerns.  Certainly listeners react to music in<br>ETs when we perform them in terms of: "Wow, 19 is really smooth<br>but 17 is brilliant and steely," rather than, "Wow, 19 sounds much<br>more just than 17 does."<br>Paul posts:<br>"4. Brian spends some time discussing why small intervals, e.g. 1/17 or<br>1/31 octave don't sound like JI, for no reason I can determine." =20<br>The reason is simple. Throw in a bunch of chromatic 1/31 or 1/17<br>octave intervals in succession and the impression of a quasi-JI<br>construct disappears.  Now that we can get all 31 or 53 or 72<br>or whatever tones per octave at once,  my experience is that=20<br>xen composers/performers are much more willing to sound<br>radically microtonal chromatic passages.  Neil Haverstick is<br>a shining example.  "Hit 'em with tiny intervals" seems to be<br>his watchword, and it's a knockout.  Listen to Neil's superb<br>"Birdwalk" if you want to be rocked back in your seat. This is  very<br>different from the "bad old days" back when the Prophet 5 rev 3<br>was all you had, and you had to choose "12 out of" 31 or "12 out<br>of" 53, etc.  Paul's comments in his numbered rebuttals<br>3 and 4 seem more  appropriate to 12-out-of-X usage than=20<br>all-notes-of-X-at-once microtonal usage. =20<br>Again, for the obvious reason that lots of chromatic successive=20<br>notes destroy any sense of "JI-ness" *even* in a highly JI-like=20<br>ET like 53.<br>Paul posts:<br>"5. <Easley Blackwood's microtonal etudes suffer because he tried to make<br>them all as 12-like as possible.> Not quite; he tried to make them as<br>tonal/modal as possible."  Paul is very close to being accurate here,<br>but his statement is just shy of 100% correct.  In fact Blackwood tried=20<br>to=20<br>make the ETs as tonal/modal as possible *in the Pythagorean framework*--<br>there are tonal/modal constructs entirely *non-Pythagorean.*  Viz.,<br>the neutral mode used by the Kwaiker of Guatamala, the Thais, etc.<br>Blackwood's usage forces the ETs into either major or minor=20<br> melodic modes derived from Pythagorean theories and<br>constructs.  This doesn't work musically for more than half the<br>equal temperaments between 5 and 33 tones per octave.<br>Incidentally, I mentioned that upwards of 40% of=20<br>Blackwood's claims about the ETs were incorrect. =20<br>Here's the rundown:<br>B claims that 21-TET has no recognizable diatonic mode.  [Blackwood,<br>Research Notes, NEH Grant R0-29376-78-0642, 1978-81, pg. 9] This<br>is verifiably wrong, as you can hear for yourself.   Tune up 21 & sound:<br>MAJOR IN 21-TET:  1  5  8  10  13  17  20<br>MINOR IN 21-TET:   1  5  7  10  13  16  19<br>(notes numbered numerically from 1 to 21, Carillo-style)<br>Your ears will end the debate.<br>Blackwood on page 124 of his NEH Grant Report claims that in<br>16-TET "the effect of CEG is that of a minor triad with<br>acceptable thirds,  but a singularly peculiar perfect fifth."<br>[Blackwood, Research Notes, NEH Grant R0-29376-78-0642,=20<br>1978-81, pg. 124]<br>*Nonsense.*  Tune up the triad 1-5-10 (starting at A440 Hz,<br>these are frequencies 400 Hz - 546.417 Hz - 649.803 Hz).<br>Does this triad sound as though it has anything *remotely*<br>akin to a perfect fifth?<br>In fact the triad sounds like discordant diminished chord<br>of some kind.  No perfect fifth is perceptible, Blackwood<br>is simply wrong. But don't take my word for it--again,<br>let your ears decide.<br>In discussing 17-TET, Blackwood states that there is<br>no consonant triad available.  Wrong.  The neutral triad<br>formed by 1-6-11 (again, these are scale steps numbered<br>from 1 to 17, Carillo-style) sounds just fine. =20<br>Blackwood claims that 19 has a recognizable diatonic<br>scale: to me it sounds unacceptably distorted.  The 2/19<br>of a whole-tone leading tone is the Achilles heel of<br>this mode--it just doesn't work at all, and the 9-tone<br>gapped mode 1 4 7 8 9 12 15 18 19 works infinitely<br>better. But let your ears decide.=20<br>Lastly, Blackwood claims that 18-TET allows the<br>construction of various chords which he writes as<br>V,  V7, etc.  This is contrary to what my ears hear,<br>to what common sense tells us.  Rather than creating<br>a sense of tonality, diminished seventh chords *destroy*<br>a sense of tonality. Thus, for Blackwood to claim that<br>(for example) "the V/II harmnies are both complex<br>altered chords with roots missing" (as on pg. 213 of<br>his grant report) and that "the chord in bar 96 is..a<br>minor dominant ninth with a lowered fifth and lowered<br>seventh" and that this creates any sense of tonal<br>harmonic progression...  Preposterous.  When<br>you lower the fifth as much as the 18-TET scale does,<br>it makes no sense to speak of "dominant chords with<br>lowered fifths."  The thing doesn't sound even remotely<br>like a dominant anything, it sounds like a diminished<br>chord and it's discordant as hell. Listen to an 18-TET<br>4:5:6 triad and you'll hear instantly that there is<br>no recognizable fifth, there is no dominant, there<br>is no V chord, there is no sense of tonality.  Blackwood<br>has simply let the theory and the numbers carry him<br>away to a conclusion contrary to what the ears hear.<br>Again, don't take my word for it--play the 18-TET<br>progression I-IV-V-I and let your ears decide whether<br>this creates any sense of tonality or not:<br>12=091=096=0912<br>6=0913=0918=096<br>1=098=0912=091<br>I-----IV----V----I<br>(Pitches of 18-TET notated from 1 to 18; vertically<br>stacked numbers indicate notes sounded together.)<br>Can you hear any kind of V chord?  Is this a functional<br>dominant?<br>So adding up the total, we find that Easley Blackwood<br>has made statements verifiably incorrect (tune up=20<br>your synth, don't take my word for it) about 16, 17,<br> 18, 19 and 21 tone equal temperament.  That's 5 out<br>of the 12 equal temperaments twixt 12 and 24: a<br>40% error rate. =20<br>Paul posts:<br>"6. <A string of MIDI numbers (0 to 127) and a MIDI file...constitutes<br>a notation.> It does, but no one  I know would want to perform or<br>analyze from. Brian goes on to claim that <I reject pieces of music which<br>aren't in traditional notation,> a point which he dreamed up himself."<br>Paul might imagine that I dreamed up this point, but the fact remains<br>that when faced with anything other than an ultra-conservative=20<br>completely common-practice-period notation, Paul's interest<br>appears to drop drastically.  I've seen it happen in person.  If I<br>play Paul a notated piece, he shows real interest--but  play him music<br>notated in a MIDI file and he's apt to say, as he did to me face-to-face,<br>"I can't make anything of this without a score." (1992, personal<br>communication, in person.)<br>This seems a strong bias against accepting or listening critically<br>to music not notated in a quasi-conventional way...but then again,<br>perhaps I misinterpret. =20<br>As to the question of a MIDI file or numerical notation<br>being a notation that "no one I know would want to<br>perform or analyze from," well, Paul knows me, and I've no<br>problems performing or analyzing from such a notation.  So the<br>statement falls short of absolutely strict accuracy. Actually,<br>in my experience numbers are *far* simpler than using note names.=20<br>Bill Schottstaedt and Julian Carillo are two obvious examples of=20<br>superb composers who prefer this kind of notation, and you could<br>make a good argument that all Csound-using computer composers<br>analyze, perform and use numerical notation all the time.

The question here is: what<br>is meant by "essentially no one"? =20<br>Let's do the math.  Compare the total number of hours of recorded<br>music played last year with the total number of hours of=20<br>live acoustic concerts played last year.  (Rock concerts don't<br>count since they are nowadays karaoke to a DAT.) If the latter number<br>is C and the former is B, then B/C is indeed essentially zero.<br>Let's consider just one concrete example: DMX is a digital music<br>channel broadcasting 24 hours a day sans commercials.  You pay<br>10 bucks a month to your cable company for it, you get 30<br>channels, and it's CD-quality sound.  24 hours/day*365 days/year<br>*30 channels * 30 million subscribers (at last count, 1995) =3D<br>7.884 BILLION person-hours of listening to recorded music.<br>How does this number of person-hours compare to the total<br>amount of live acoustic music person-hours listened to in 1995?<br>Let's take a guess...say, 200 people per live acoustic concert,<br>maybe 1000 concerts per day across the U.S., say 2 hours<br>per concert, total =3D 200*1000*365*2 =3D 189,800 person-hours<br>of live acoustic concert.<br>Now divide live/recorded person-hours of listening:<br>189,800/(7.884 exp 9) =3D 0.000024<br>Isn't this "essentially zero"?  Paul is being silly here.  He's<br>quibbling.  This is as near zero as makes no difference.<br>Quibbles about how closely 0.000024 approaches zero are<br>obviously superfluous--obviously virtually the music listened<br>to by virtually all the people in the U.S. is recorded music.  Clearly the<br>obvious fact is that by and large 99.999% of the population no<br>longer attends  live concerts of acoustic music.  Essentially all=20<br>music is nowadays heard off CDs, off cassettes, on the radio, or<br>some other recorded form.  To deny this is to discredit yourself<br>by denying the facts.=20<br>Paul posts:<br>"8. <For 25-tET, "a notation which implies that there are more tones than<br>sharped or flatted versions of C, D, E, G, and A proves less than<br>useful."> Sorry, no sale.

Clearly my meaning is different from Paul's.=20<br>My definition of "useful" in this case involved bringing to the surface<br>the fundamental pentatonic mode of pitches which remain exactly<br>the same in 5-TET through 45-TET.  Paul meant something else...<br>no doubt we're both right.<br>Paul posts:<br>"9. <Blackwood's (and my) notion that E and F are the same note (in 20, 25,<br>etc., any ET with a 720-cent fifth) is "willful obfuscation."> It is true,<br>however.

Paul is doubtless correct that I don't<br>recognize his point.  I'll have to re-read his article, clearly. Mea culpa.<br>Paul posts:<br>"10. <22-tET has nothing in common with traditional tunings.> Does anyone<br>agree with this?"  This has already been dealt with by Paul Erlich,<br>who also disagrees with Paul.  My claim is overstated: 22-TET has<br>a musically recognizable semitone in common with highly=20<br>Pythagorean tunings, and it shares a near-just 4:5:6.  Over-emphasis<br>is often necessary to get my point across.  Murmur politely and<br>average folks will step on your face as they walk over you without<br>noticing--shout and they'll pay attention. (Shout the truth as they'll<br>grab for a noose, but that's a different matter...)<br>Paul posts:<br>"11. <The notation of distinctly un-Pythagorean ETs in this manner doesn't<br>work, e.g. 13- and 14-tET.> My solutions for these and others like them<br>reveal exactly what he says is lacking.

Paul clearly feels it is, and I clearly don't.  Reasonable people<br>can disagree.<br>Paul posts:<br>"12. <14-tET is nothing more than two sets of 7-equal.> This comment is<br>similar to Brian's comment about 25 being nothing more than 5 sets of<br>5-equal, and equally incorrect.

My intended<br>subtext is that melodically the neutral mode is the primary melodic<br>structure in 14, not a diatonic major or diatonic minor scale.  In that<br>context my statement is correct; Paul's point is presumably that other<br>musically modes exist in 14 (and 25).  His statement is also correct.<br>Paul posts:<br>"13. <35-tET is a nightmare to notate.> Anyone who reads my article is<br>invited to determine that this is not so. If anyone wishes, I'll apply the<br>method I've evolved to that, since I didn't illustrate it in my article.<br>It is a curious case, but by no means dreadful."  Paul is speaking<br>notationally--I'm speaking musically.  35 is notationaly dire because<br>it boasts two "perfect fifths" about equally far from the just 3/2.<br>The ear thus tends to identify one or the other as "the" perfect fifth<br>depending on context--if you use a primarily 7-TET context, the 685.714<br>cent fifth sounds "right" and if you use the 5-TET context, the<br>720-cent fifths sounds "right." My experience is that no known notation<br>captures this musical reality.  On the other hand  Paul's  notation surely<br>has subtleties and advantages I've not yet appreciated..I'll have=20<br>to study his Xenharmonikon 16 article again.<br>Paul posts:<br>"14. <Sharps and flats are most useful in tunings which sound like they<br>have semitones.> This is too vague for me. Besides, sharps and flats<br>aren't defined in terms of semitones, but at least initially as 7 perfect<br>fifths (up or down), in a Pythagorean sense, anyhow. What interests me<br>most are cases where the fifths are so far from just that the sharp and<br>flat end up denoting either fairly large or fairly small intervals."<br>On reflection, Paul is right.  My language in this regard<br>is too vague.<br>Paul posts:<br>"15. <"The use of sharps and flats in 19 is willf<br>=D4 perverse."> There are<br>many counterexamples to this categorical denial. Of all ETs, 19-tET is<br>closest to 12."  This is musically not true in my experience.  22 sounds<br>to my ears much closer to 12 than 19, because the 1/11 octave interval<br>sounds much closer to a semitone than does a 2/19 octave interval.=20<br>19 is a third-tone scale, with whole tones and thirds of tones.<br>Thus, the leading tone in 19 must be either 2/19 a (too flat) or<br>1/19 a (too sharp); by comparison 1/11 octave works just fine as a=20<br>leading tone in 22.<br>The other issue here is that notating 19 with #, b, 5-line staff &<br>traditional note names *badly* confuses xenharmonists, because the<br>12-TET conditioning is so strong.

For  a number of<br>reasons, this makes sense--even though the<br>cassette itself is now 7 years old.<br>First, this tape is an extremely important<br>aural document in the history of post-Partch<br>just intonation.  Prior to 1989 many individual<br>tapes were available, but there was no <br>convincing proof that a widespread movement<br>toward JI existed in America.  Individual<br>composers' JI tapes could be dismissed by<br>bigoted New York critics of the head-in-the-sand<br>Paul Griffiths school--"this JI composer is a<br>fringe lunatic," "that JI composer is a flake,"<br>and so on, and so forth. Partch himself was<br>treated this way until the 80s. (After all, The New Yorker<br>music critic described Ivan Vyshnegradsky as<br>"almost insane" in a 1995 review.)  But once the<br>JIN issued its compilation cassette, it became<br>impossible for the New York critical circle-jerk<br>buddy system to deny the existence of a<br>grass-roots just intonation movement of long<br>standing on the West Coast. <br>Second, the JIN cassette "Rational Music" is an<br>important document tracing the early history<br>of just intonation on pre- and post-MIDI<br>digital synthesizers.  Many of the compositions<br>on "Rational Music" date from just before and<br>just after the advent of MIDI, and they are<br>therefore an invaluable historical record of how<br>the first generation of mass-market digital JI'ers <br>wrestled with the problems of MIDI, computer<br>sequencers and keyboards designed for 12<br>equal tones but retuned to just intonation.<br>(This problem is one with which many of us continue<br>to wrestle today.)<br>Third, "Rational Music" was the Just Intonation<br>Network's announcement of its musical position.<br>Inevitably, all movements stake out a place in<br>the musical spectrum--IRCAM has consistently<br>placed itself in the post-Webern serialist camp<br>and has thus marginalized itself nearly out of<br>existence; all the award-winning IRCAM composers<br>use Forte/Rahn/Morrison pitch-class set theory<br>in their compositions. CCRMA has consistently placed <br>itself in the American neocalssical camp; Dartmouth<br>in the Ussachevksy/Luening American electronic music<br>camp, which lies midway between the extremes of the<br>French ORTF musique concrete and the Germand <br>Darmstadt lab-oscillator-and-filter school--and so on.  <br>With the selection of pieces on "Rational Music" the JIN<br>placed itself squarely in the neoclassical algorithmic<br>camp with this tape, reflecting by and large the<br>interests of the JIN members in the San Francisco<br>Bay area.  This movement has since flowered,<br>while the Eurocentric12-TET serialist acoustic<br>movement has continued to flail and twitch<br>like a chicken with its head cut off--albeit<br>more feebly now than ever before.  <br>(Remember that New York is part of Europe,<br>and the Bay area up through the Northwest is<br>part of the Pacific Rim.  Then you can understand<br>why New York composers were so Eurocentric<br>and why the American gamelan movement began<br>in the Bay area.) <br>--<br>The first piece on side 1 of "Rational Music For An<br>Irrational World" is "Dance of the Testifiers" by<br>Erling Wold.  This appears to be a synthesizer-and-<br>sampler arrangement of  "incidental music for<br>the theatre work `The Islamic Republic Of Las<br>Vegas.'"  The composition strongly resembles the<br>work of Lou Harrison, and dates from 1985. As<br>has been mentioned in prior posts, Erling Wold is<br>a talented composer as well as a polymath, and<br>this composition is as impressive and delightful<br>as the rest of his oeuvre.  Especially notable: Wold's<br>success in teasing an expressive, human-sounding<br>result from his MIDI sequences.<br>"Prelude and Fugue for the Rest of Us" by Jules <br>Siegel was performed "by the composer's original<br>IBM PC software which models human performance."<br>This composition won 3rd place in the Third Coast<br>New Music Project Microtonal Music Festival in 1988.<br>Despite a slightly mechanical-sounding performance,<br>the composition comes across as a tuneful and impressive<br>extension of Bachian contrapuntal techniques into the<br>realm of extended JI.<br>"Loved and Lost" by Eric S. Ridgway was composed,<br>performed and recorded in January of 1986 using<br>4 multi-tracked acoustic JI guitar tape parts. This<br>piece is fascinating because it is a species of<br>composition which could not have existed prior to<br>the advent of cheap multi-track tape machines. <br>It works well, although the recording quality betrays<br>the age of the composition.<br>"Form For Just Intonation" by Norbert Oldani, is <br>particularly interesting for 2 reasons: first, <br>Oldani is a long-time JI and ET theorist whose<br>theoretical work is undeservedly little-known<br>and whose compositions are  ( even more<br>undeservedly) less widely known.  And second, Oldani<br>realizes his composition with a peculiar early<br>digital synthesizer: Passport Design's Soundchaser<br>System.  This synth produced 8-bit digital sound<br>with 256-point additive synthesis wavetables. <br>On 2 cards plugged into an Apple II+ computer,<br>the Soundchaser was much more programmable<br>than most modern digital synths--moreover, due<br>to the digital filters on the DACs, the sound<br>output was reasonably hi-fi up to about 12 khz.<br>Oldani's composition takes maximum advantage<br>of the unique digital timbres of the Soundchaser<br>system: basically, you could get dynamic additive<br>digital synthesis by burning polyphony.  In this<br>regard the Soundchaser was infinitely more <br>flexible than modern digital synths, and Oldani<br>coaxes a remarkable variety of bell-like, string-<br>like and analog-synth-type timbres from his<br>system.  The piece works well, and is one of the <br>very few recordings now extant of a microtonal<br>composition on an entirely microcomputer-based<br>pre-MIDI digital synthesis system.<br>"City of Trout" by Thomas J. Dougherty, sounds<br>remarkably like much of the music being done <br>today by the San Francisco Bay area Max<br>algorithmic composers.  By and large the American<br>algorithmic composition movement came out of<br>the Bay area, and this is an early and elegant<br>example--one of the best pieces on the tape.<br>"I am Curious (George)" by Carola Anderson is<br>also noteworthy because it clearly represents<br>the first MIDI efforts by a JI composer who had<br>earlier worked exclusively with acoustic<br>ensembles.  (This is true of many of the Bay Area<br>JI community: David Doty and many other influential<br>SF JIN members initially started their xenharmonic<br>explorations as American gamelan performers and<br>builders, strongly influenced by Lou Harrison's<br>justly tuned gamelans.  Thus most of these early<br>JIN members gained their first compositional<br>experience with live acoustic ensembles, rather<br>than with digital synths and computers.)<br>This composition succeeds well, and doesn't<br>sound "stiff" or overquantized.  David Doty is to <br>be congratulated for serving as "MIDI guru" to<br>Carola Anderson on this composition.  The results<br>are musically impressive.<br>"Two Fragments of Ancient Greek Music" are<br>FB-01 HMSL-produced Greek melodic fragments.<br>The timbres sound not so great and the performance<br>is  somewhat mechanical, but since the main interest <br>here is historical and musciological, that doesn't <br>matter at all.  John Chalmers once again demonstrates<br>his scholarship by resurrecting these 2500-year-old<br>musical fragments from oblivion and letting us<br>hear them.<br>"Air for the Poet" by Lou Harrison is a fine acoustic<br>recording of a typically Handelian neoclassical<br>composition.  As always, it's difficult to hear anything<br>xenharmonic in the piece.<br>"Time Auscultations" by William Alves is up to the<br>usual high standard of this fine composer's oeuvre:<br>in this case, samples of the internal motors of<br>robots are ingeniously used to create a just <br>intonation soundscape.  Alves is one of the most<br>adroit composers at the forefront of the movement<br>to combine cutting-edge digital signal processing<br>techniques with classical just intonation tunings.<br>The result is a unique and splendidly musical blend <br>of the modern & the classical.<br>SIDE TWO:<br>"Paradigms Lost" by David B. Doty is his "fantasy<br>of what might have happened if psychedelic-era<br>rock bands had pursued their interests in the exotic,<br>free from the constraints imposed by the record<br>industry."  To thse old ears, this composition sounds<br>like the best piece of music on the tape.  It's a<br>stunning demonstation of how vividly musical just<br>intonation can be, while at the same time whipping<br>the listener through some truly crunchy JI<br>modulations & intervals.<br>Doty's intent is also a worthy one: we in the<br>Southern California Microtonal Group have also<br>produced a a subset of compositions which<br>in effect take up where the psychedelic rock<br>bands of the late 60s left off.  This is a<br>musical direction utterly disdained by the<br>so-called "serious contemporary music"<br>theorists and critics (many of whom cannot<br>be taken seriously), but it's a musical<br>direction which promises endless musical <br>rewards to the adventurous microtonal<br>explorer...as Neil Haverstick has recently<br>pointed out.   <br>I have in prior posts mentioned that David Doty<br>is a superbly talented composer: this composition<br>offers yet further proof of that fact.  "Paradigms<br>Lost" alone justifies spending the money on the JIN<br>tape.<br>"Analogs" by Glenn Frantz, uses a MIDIfied<br>Commodore 64 computer with a Yamaha TX81Z.<br>The composition is theoretically interesting since it<br>uses not a fixed scale, but instead a fluid set<br>of pitches separated by the 81/80.  This kind <br>of "floating just intonation" would be impossible<br>with an impractically large acoustic ensemble,<br>but with a computer it becomes easy.  Musically, this<br>piece is very effective, and works well.  Another<br>historically fascinating example of early JI<br>composition: it's sobering to realize that with<br>the advent of the Commodore 64 and the TX81Z<br>and FB-01, for about 5 years in the mid-1980s<br>even dirt-poor composers could get into digitally<br>sequenced computer-controlled xenharmonic<br>music for an investment of under 700 or 800<br>dollars U.S.  This is no longer true: today, the<br>minimum cost of a retunable digital synthesizer<br>has climbed above $1500 and new computers<br>aren't cheap, either.  (Of course, used IBM XTs<br>and TX81Zs can be bought second-hand for<br>next to nothing, but my point is that there are<br>no NEW synths or computers to fill the under-$1000-<br>for-the-whole-schmeer niche.)  In my judgment,<br>this lack of dirt-cheap retunable synths is a<br>big gap in the market, and some synthesizer<br>company will make a bunch 'o bucks if they<br>can fill it. (Computer sound cards don't count,<br>since they're not portable stand-alone units.)<br>"Threnody" by Dudley Duncan is a positively<br>19th-century-like essay in JI.  Very nice piece,<br>and an early 1988 example of a composition<br>using Partch's 43-tone scale(!)<br>"Guitar Suite" by David Canright demonstrates<br>another talent of the multifacted math<br>instructor.  Canright is not only a fine JI<br>theorist and a mathematically adept mind,<br>but a skilled guitar player & composer.<br>"Study #3" by Ralph David Hill is a virtuoso<br>example of something from nothing. This<br>piece was done on Hill's home-built Quadvox,<br>a synthesizer built literally from the <br>ground up out of raw chips and microcode<br>in the early 1980s.  Almost anyone else<br>would be intimidated by the mere prospect<br>of such a task: Dave Hill not only completed<br>the project, but managed to make the results<br>sound musical.  (The liner notes are not<br>accurate for this piece: I know Dave HIll's<br>work intimately, and this composition was<br>clearly not done with his Cro-Magnon resynthesis<br>system.)<br>"Temple of Eyes" is a very skillful new-agey<br>JI composition using sampled and synthesized<br>sounds.  Robert Rich, the composer, is also<br>an influential programmer: he wrote the JICalc<br>software which is used by so many xenharmonists<br>to retune their synths.  An excellent piece of music.<br>"Zenharmonics 2.1 (excerpt) by Gino Robair,<br>proves less interesting. A bevy of guitars all<br>played with e-bows comes off as too much guitar<br>and too static a drone.  Robair's percussion music<br>is much more interesting; it's a pity none of it<br>is included here.<br>"Ulysses Departs From the Edge of the World" by<br>Harry Partch is the only recording I know of this<br>composition.  Apparently it originally appeared<br>on a long-departed LP or CD called "New Music<br>For Trumpet" by Jack Logan.

Terhardt's theory is a<br>good one, in particular because it is able to explain<br>stretched partials heard as a "pure" harmonic series--<br>but even so, Terhardt's theory has problems because<br>it ignores the apparently important role of temporal<br>information in human hearing below 500 Hz, and<br>also because it has problems with the minor mode<br>in western music, and it systematically produces the<br>wrong predictions for inharmonic tone complexes.<br>One of the biggest problems with current place<br>theories of hearing is that they are still largely<br>empirical.  The reason for this is that existing 3-D<br>hydroelastic models for the human cochlea<br>are fiendishly difficult to evaluate mathematically.<br>In order to "determine the solution for the <br>displacement of the basilar membrane, it is <br>necessary to solve a nonlinear eigenvalue problem <br>for the local inviscid wavenumber k zero."

Am., 81(1), Jan. 1987, pg. 110]<br>Solving a nonlinear eigenvalue problem is no<br>walk in the park.  The way you do this is: guess <br>the solution, input it, let the computer<br>churn until the solution begins to diverge out<br>of bounds, then do it over again. And over. And <br>over...  There's a large element of black magic<br>and intuition to this kind of thing--there's<br>an enormous premium on being a good<br>guesser.  Alas, when the p.d.e. is non-linear,<br>predictor-corrector methods like Runge-Kutta<br>don't help much.  Your solution diverges to <br>infinity long before the corrector can kick<br>in to save it. Point-and-shoot methods like<br>Newton's and variations on the steepest descent<br>theme are even worse: they fly off to infinity<br>almost immediately. Adaptive methods don't<br>help because when the solution starts to diverge<br>the adaptive loop cranks the iteration<br>increment down to such a small value that the <br>CPU bogs down and memory blows out.<br>So the bottom line is that we need a *lot*<br>more data and *much* better<br>mathematical models of the inner structures<br>of the human ear before we can hope to get<br>at the truth of the human auditory apparatus.<br>At present, the best guess is that both<br>place and periodicity mechanisms appear<br>to be involved in pitch perception, and some<br>sort of neural net *may* be involved.<br>--<br>Paul Erlich mentions specific "central pitch<br>processor" theories by Wightman and <br>Goldstein.   These are hybrid theories which<br>became fashionable about 25 years ago<br>in a number of guises. Goldstein offers<br>one version, Wightman another, more recently<br>(in 1991) Meddis and Hewitt: "Virtual Pitch<br>and Phase sensitivity of a computer model<br>of the auditory periphery," I & II, 1991, J.<br>Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 89., pp. 2866-2894.<br>Wightman's pattern transformation theory<br>suffered a severe blow in 1979--see A. J. M.<br>Houtsma, "Musical pitch of 2-tone complexes<br>and predictions by modern pitch theories,"<br>J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 66, No. 1, July 1979,<br>ppg. 87-98.<br>"Among the three popular pitch theories only<br>the optimum processor theory [Goldstein's]<br> is able to account for most of the data<br>is a quantitative sense.  The virtua pitch theory,<br>which in its original formulation can account for<br>most phenomena only in a qualitative sense, can<br>be brought into quantitative agreement with most<br>experimental results through some modifications<br>which make it yield results very similar to the <br>optimal processor theory.  The pattern transformation<br>theory was found to be significantly less supported<br>by empirical results, especially by results obtained<br>with successive harmonic two-tone complexes that<br>were already available in the literature. Attempts to<br>find a suitable modification of this theory that would<br>bring its predicitions and experimental results in<br>closer agreement were not successful. None of the<br>theories presently accounts in a quantitative way<br>for the apparent constatn rivalry between analytic<br>and synthetic mode pitch perception which is always<br>present in experiments that use complex tones."<br>[Houstmas, A. J. M., op cit., 1979, pg. 98]<br>And so Wightman's and Goldstein's models have been<br>supplanted in the 1980s and 1990s by spatio-temporal<br>theories most of which are non-deterministic--<br>that is to say they use a form of Boltzmann<br>machine (AKA neural net) rather than a set<br>of deterministic algorithms to extract<br>pitch.  (Note: Goldstein's model is also<br>non-deterministic, but to the best of my<br>knowledge it's not a neural net.) <br>For example:  see "A Spectral Network<br>Model of Pitch Perception," by Cohen, M. A.,<br>Grossberg, S., and Wyse, L. L., J. Acoust. Soc.<br>Am., 98 (2), August 1995, pp. 862-879.<br>This last model appears to be the best one<br>yet, far superior to the Wightman or Goldstein<br>models.  For one thing the Cohen et al. "Spectral<br>network" model produces reasonable output<br>from Shepard tone input and also from Deutsch<br>tritone-paradox input *without* the use of<br>ad hoc attentional mechanisms.<br>Wightman's or Goldstein's model both require<br>external ad hoc constraints to reproduce the<br>Deutsch results for tritone stimuli.<br>Serious problems remain with the hypothesis of<br>a *specific* central pitch processor.  To date, no <br>specific (today, neural-ent spatio-temporal) central<br>processor model can account for the Zwicker<br>tone, for the effects cited in "The influence<br>of duration on the perception of pitch in single<br>and simulatneous complex tones," Beerends, J.<br>G., J.

By the 1940s Schouten et al. thought pitch<br>perception took place entirely in the 8th nerve,<br>and by the 1970s Wightman, Goldstein, et al. thought<br>pitch perception took place much farther inside<br>the brain via a computer-like mathematical<br>algorithm.  The most recent (1991, 1995) pitch<br>perception theories assume that hearing takes<br>place in a complex neural net distributed throughout<br>the higher brain loci.  Instead of an algorithmic loop,<br>these spectral network theories have more of the<br>flavor of a cake being baked--you can specify<br>pretty precisely the ingredients and procedures<br>required  to bake a cake with the required <br>characteristics, but the math of baking a cake<br>molecule-by-molecule is imponderable--it's a <br>highly parallel and highly non-linear process<br>in which the main events are thermodynamic rather<br>than algorithmic (as in neural nets, whose distribution<br>of nodal weights is more usefully viewed from the<br>point of view of entropy than of algorithms).<br>Notice, first, that successive investigators have<br>chased the "location" of pitch perception farther<br>and farther up the inner ear and into the brain,<br>until today there's no "location" at all other<br>than a large set of ganglia spread throughout<br>the Sylvian fissure.<br>Second, notice that each era described pitch<br>perception in terms of the highest technology<br>then available: in 400 B.C., a vibrating<br>drum, in the 1840s a mechanical Fourier<br>transformer, in the 1940s a time-based<br>electronic autocorrelator, in the 1970s<br>a complex computer program operating as<br>a "central processor," in the 1990s a highly<br>parallel neural net.<br><br>--mclaren<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 01:15 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22013; Thu, 5 Dec 1996 16:02:55 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA21950<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id HAA21562; Thu, 5 Dec 1996 07:02:51 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 5 Dec 1996 07:02:51 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961205145941_71670.2576_HHB56-3@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
