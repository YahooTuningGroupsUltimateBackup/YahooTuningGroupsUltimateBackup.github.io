Implicitly I perceive you to be suggesting "or NOT coming<br>close to any particular instrumental or vocal sound".  <br><br>   I'm starting to come to the conclusion that the idea of sounds that are<br>natural and expressive, and yet don't sound like any existing musical<br>instrument (or voice), may not be possible to achieve!  I would never have<br>believed that ... five years ago or so.  The reason why I'm starting to<br>draw that surprising conclusion comes from an ever-closer examination of<br>musical instrument sounds.  <br><br>   In examining instrumental timbres in careful detail, I've come to<br>realize that I'm looking at them in too much detail!  <br><br>   What seems more clearly meaningful to their essential nature, is not the<br>specific things that set a clarinet, say, apart from a flute, as much as<br>the fact that their ranges of timbral qualities overlap quite a bit with<br>one another.  <br><br>   Most of the woodwinds really do sound quite similar to each other in<br>their upper ranges, at least as far as overtone structure is concerned. <br>Sure, they are distinguishible;  don't get me wrong, but they're not<br>massively different.  And that's largely true of brasses (at any one volume<br>level anyway).  And on top of that, there's even a lot of overlap between<br>the timbral qualities across the major families.  <br><br>   Professional arrangers often describe saxophones as chameleons;  you put<br>them among woodwinds and they sound like woodwinds;  put them among brasses<br>and they sound somewhat like brasses, put them among strings and they sound<br>somewhat like strings.  But there's a lot of truth to that in other<br>instruments as well.  Horns, for example, have long been used in woodwind<br>ensembles, as have double basses.  And 'celli are often likened to sounding<br>a lot like a tenor or bass human voice.  <br><br>   I've become aware of that further as I've taken up the soprano saxophone<br>the past few months.  I'm amazed by how much difference in timbre can come<br>from seemingly small adjustments in my mouth configuration (embouchure). <br>And that's just one single instrument, with one single player.  I've also<br>become aware of that as I've recorded various instrumental performers for<br>use in sampling.  I have to ask them to even out all of those expressive<br>mechanisms so that I can produce a clean loop, and then resupply those<br>expressions synthetically - synthetically so that I can control them<br>musically rather than having them play back as a tape recording would. <br>It's very easy to see that it's very difficult to resupply them<br>synthetically.  <br><br>   The idea that there exists a vast spectrum of timbres that existing<br>musical instruments carve tiny pieces of, I'm beginning to believe is just<br>not true.  It's much more accurate to suggest that each instrument actually<br>carves a very wide sath through those possibilities, and covers a LOT of<br>the available possibilities.  In fact it's looking like it goes even one<br>step further than that - to the point where the swaths existing instruments<br>carve through the timbral spectrum are in fact so wide, that not only do<br>the cover the majority of the spectrum, but they are so wide that they<br>overlap each other!  <br><br>   What seems to distinguish one instrument from another seems to be not<br>nearly as much their unique timbral qualities DISTINCT from other<br>instruments, as the way they behave within a field of timbral qualities IN<br>COMMON with other instruments.  <br><br>   So what this all seems to be demonstrating, is that there is so much<br>timbral overlap between the familiar instruments, that almost any seemingly<br>all-new timbre you devise is more likely to be perceived as "like" some<br>other existing instrument, or some qualities of an existing instrument at<br>least, than to be perceived as something truly new.  <br><br>   The solution?  Well, perhaps it lies in Wendy Carlos' approach of - in a<br>sense anyway - using fire to fight fire:  Building hybrid timbres - timbres<br>that take advantage of this overlapping space, so that they sound like two<br>instruments at the same time - "it's just like a violin," we say, "but then<br>again, it's also just like a clarinet too".<br><br>   Another possibility is that, to make a new invented timbre sound like<br>something in its own right, perhaps it's just a matter of using it a lot. <br>That way, whatever qualities you give it, even though at first most of them<br>will remind your audience of their overlap with some other instrument<br>they're familiar with, that particular combination of attributes will,<br>given enough time, start sound like something meaningful in a coherent<br>sense of a single, all-new instrument.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 9 Mar 1997 13:17 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10135; Sun, 9 Mar 1997 13:17:09 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10163<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id EAA23861; Sun, 9 Mar 1997 04:14:22 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 9 Mar 1997 04:14:22 -0800<br>Message-Id: <335ca7ef.761221085@kcbbs.gen.nz><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Thoughts on Fantasy Timbres</h1><h3><a id=5021 href="#5021">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MorriSonics@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/1997 8:59:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>In answering an E-mail message from a long-time xenharmonic explorer<br>friend, I launched into a dissertation of recent observations about timbre.<br> Perhaps you too would be interested in it.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>-----------<br><br>   Here's something to think about when it comes to finding what you<br>described as making "free use of sound synthesis techniques of any kind,<br>coming as close to voice or instrumental sound as suits the music I'm<br>producing".
