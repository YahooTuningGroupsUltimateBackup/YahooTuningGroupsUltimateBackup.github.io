This=20<br>issue is a xenharmonically important one because=20<br>Hindemith isn't the only composer with such odd<br>ideas...so it's worth discussing a little further.<br>From=20about 1880 through the 1940s it was popular<br>for many music theorists to add a dash of harmonic<br>series quasi-science to their teachings.  The guy who=20<br>started this was Mersenne, followed by Rameau,<br>but the fellow who really kicked the trend=20<br>into high gear was Hermann Helmholtz, with help from=20<br>the experimental work of  Michaelson, Lord Kelvin and=20<br>above all Dayton C. Miller.<br>Helmholtz proposed the notion that the human ear=20<br>performs a Fourier analysis on incoming sounds.  This<br>is now known to be partly true for frequencies above<br>500 Hz, which leaves open the very daunting question:<br>what does the ear do with sounds below 500 Hz?<br>This question has still not been satisfactorily=20<br>answered, though there is overwhelming evidence<br>that more than one process is at work when the ear/<br>brain system hears a sound.<br>Helmholtz's theory, however, specifies *only* Fourier<br>analysis.  This led several generations of researchers<br>to build mechanical Fourier analysis/resynthesis<br>systems: Lord Kelvin's tide predictor used 40 sine and<br>cosine terms added mechanically to predict tides,<br>while Michaelson's mechanical Fourier analyzer<br>reduced spectroscopic measurements to Fourier<br>coefficients.  Far and away the most elaborate of<br>these systems, however, was Dayton C. Miller's<br>mechanical Fourier analysis/resynthesis system=20<br>operating on phonodeik-generated sound waveforms.<br>A music theorist perusing the cutting-edge scientific<br>literature on musical acoustics between 1900 and 1940<br>would have "learned" that the harmonic series is=20<br>fundamental to an understanding of music and=20<br>acoustics.  The fact that the harmonic series was<br>used to analyze music primarily because it it had<br>the simplest and most straightforward mathematics=20<br>never seemed to occur to anyone--with a few lone<br>exceptions. See Llewellyn S. Lloyd's "Musical Theory<br>In Retrospect" in JASA, 1941, for a cogent critique<br>of the circular reasoning by which early 1900s musicians=20<br>and physicists concluded that the harmonic series=20<br>explained music, since all music when analyzed by=20<br>the Fourier transform is turned into a set of perfectly<br>harmonic frequencies.  And since Fourier analysis<br>generates a set of perfectly harmonic frequencies,<br>therefore the harmonic series explains all music.<br>The problem with this way of thinking about music<br>and sound is that the method you're using (Fourier<br>analysis) is incapable of ever giving you *anything*<br>BUT a set of perfectly harmonic frequencies.  If you<br>Fourier-analyze a set of inharmonic frequencies, your<br>output will be a set of perfectly harmonic frequencies--<br>albeit an infinite number of 'em.  Fourier analysis,<br>because it's incapable of generating any output<br>other than a set of perfectly harmonic frequencies,<br>automatically *limits the types of sounds which can<br>be usefully analyzed*, and it also radically limits<br>the kinds of output you get from your analysis.<br>As a result, Fourier analysis drastically limits the kinds<br>of  musical systems which can be usefully theorized<br>about.  The problem here is that we've begun with an=20<br>assumption and then proceeded to use evidence derived<br>from it to prove that out-of-the-blue assumption, =20<br>with the predictable  result that our logic is infallibly<br>mathematically true  and thoroughly meaningless as<br>a method of probing physical reality. =20<br>Imagine it this way: you're a bee.  You have faceted eyes.<br>You see the universe as facets.  You develop an elaborate<br>theory which explains the universe in terms of facets.<br>Have you learned anything basic about physical reality?<br>Or are you merely the victim of your preconceptions,<br>having assumed the truth of what you set out to prove?<br>Appplying Fourier analysis to music produces the same<br>conundrum.=20<br>However, no music theorist realized this back at the start<br>of this century.  (For a very telling early criticism of<br>the entire Fourier picture of sound, timbre and music,<br>see Danis Gabor's "Acoustical Quanta," 1947, Nature<br>(British journal), V. 4044) As a result, in the early 1900s it=20<br>was popular to "explain" exotic modern 12-TET  music by=20<br>using the  harmonic series.  A typical example is Scriabin's<br>"mystic chord," which supposedly approximates members=20<br>11 and 13 of the harmonic series with a set of 12-tone<br>equal-tempered pitches. (If memory serves, the complete<br>"mystic chord" was 9:10:11:12:13.  I may be incorrect.)<br>The fact that harmonics 11 and 13 were not well approximated<br>in 12-TET (harmonic 11 is about 50 cents away from<br>the nearest value available in 12) didn't seem to bother<br>Scriabin or his supporters.  Such, apparently, was the<br>power of the 12-TET mindset...<br>"Hindemith's position may be classed with 'law of Nature'<br>theories, which seek to derive the procedures of musical<br>art from the objective properties of tone rather than from<br>the musical activities of people.=20<br>%=A0resulting natural<br>'laws' are presented to us as scientifically valid and<br>general enough to comprise the permanent and inevitable=20<br>aspects of the art. Musicians hesitate to question such<br>theories, first because it is unpopular to  oppose the=20<br>claimed pronouncements of natural science, second<br>because few of them today are sufficiently prepared in<br>the relevant disciplines to be critical of details, and third<br>because they do not readily distinguish between proper=20<br>scientific forumlas and a species of mysticism dealing<br>with magic numbers.<br>"Hindemith's analysis begins with the familiar harmonic<br>series of overtones from the fundamental C, but he<br>discusses theoretical rather than actual overtones. (..)<br>"For we can 'discover' and 'prove' in the fertile harmonics<br>the natural origin of any musical relations whatsoever,=20<br>not to mention all the unmusical ones, though there is an<br>embarassing exception in the minor triad. (..)<br>"The most severe of Hindemith's troubles with Nature<br>occur in his account of the minor harmony, not so much=20<br>because Nature is notoriously coy about the matter, as=20<br>because Hindemith projects upon it a kind of reasoning<br>that should make even his scholastic predecessors wince. (..)<br>"Hindemith repeats some well-worn odes in praise of<br>just intervals, but does not investigate the facts. His<br>good ear notifies him of inflections, but he is not<br>equipped to define them properly, so that he never suspects<br>that Hindemith the violist plays quite normally in the=20<br>'abominable' Pythagorean system. As with mere facts,<br>so with logic, for our theorist first derides equal temp-<br>ermants in the manner of the least informed fiddle<br>teacher and elsewhere claims that we can hear only<br>in equal temperament. A pretty muddle is reached when<br>we learn that enharmonic differences in notation are<br>meaningless and futile and that these same enharmonic<br>differences in fact are also inesecapable and beautiful. (..)<br>"Hindemith does not study the real nature of music,=20<br>neither the nature of the material medium through which<br>the art of music comes alive, nor the nature of the human<br>purposes which have brought about every facet of the art.<br>His concern is with non-human mechanics of a non-<br>material world...=20<br>"Thus Hindemith does not give us Nature but in her stead<br>some more or less ingenious manipulations of cycles=20<br>and epicycles, of triangulations and of cubes, of alternate<br>multiplications and divisions...and above all the reflections<br>thereof in that wondrous and capacious subconscious which=20<br>is so convenient a repository, by definition, of everything<br>we do not know or cannot answer. (..)<br>"Hindemith prestends to be modern and scientific, and at every<br>turn he dazzles the unwary with thel anguage of mathematics,<br>of astronomy and of physics, and he even talks about=20<br>experiments. Yet he is not concerned with Nature but with<br>a revival of medieval speculation about magic numbers.<br>"Hindemith's 'experiments' consist of his private contemplation<br>of triangles and syllogisms, and he should not therefore hint to<br>us that his results come directly from the laboratory. (..)<br>"For the sake of clarity, the olden myths of musica mundana<br>should not be hidden in jargon taken from the natural=20<br>sciences." [Cazden, Norman,  abstract of the paper "Hindemith<br>and Nature," read in Iowa City on April 18 1954; Journal<br>of the American Musicologycal Society, Vol. 7, Summer<br>1954, pp. 161-164]=20<br>An even weirder twist on this strange notion that=20<br>high members of the harmonic series could somehow<br>be "represented" by 12-TET pitches is the idea that<br>the harmonic series pitches were "out of tune"--rather<br>than the 12-tone equal tempered scale pitches!<br>Paul Hindemith uses both of these ideas in his derivation<br>of the 12 tone equal temperament.  He then proceeds to<br>dismiss harmonic-series-based tunings as "out of tune"<br>because they deviate from the tuning of 12 tone equal<br>temperament (though as Cazden points out Hindemith<br>also praises the harmonic series effusively at other<br>points.)=20<br>In his 1931 doctoral thesis (republished as "Tuning and<br>Temperament in 1950) J. Murray Barbour commits the<br>same error--meantone and JI are "musically inferior"<br>because they contain large "errors"--errors measured<br>by comparing them with 12-tet!!!<br>This sounds incredible, but it was a common way of<br>theorizing about music between 1900 and 1940.  Back<br>then, ethnomusicology hadn't really gotten off the<br>ground and there was very little understanding of the<br>deeply non-twelvular nature of  non-western  musics<br>throughout the world.  Other cultures were presumed<br>to be "primitive" and their tuning systems were<br>assumed to be "crude approximations" either of<br>12 tone equal temperament, or some even simpler system<br>like 5-TET or 7-TET (which, most music theorists<br>assumed, were merely "precursors" of 12-TET). =20<br>It never seemed to occur to anyone between 1900 and<br>1940 that other cultures often performed music using<br>instruments which had inharmonic timbres and<br>therefore did not need tunings based on the harmonic<br>series.  It never seemed to occur to anyone in<br>the beginning of this century that other cultures<br>might make music which was *more* sophisticated<br>than ours in certain ways, while our music was<br>more sophisticated than that of other cultures<br>in different ways.  (For example, the idea that<br>African music was far more rhythmically complex<br>than western music seems to have been alien to<br>music theorists of the early part of this century.<br>Ditto the notion that other cultures often didn't break<br>up a 2:1 interval into small whole number ratios,<br>but instead added non-just non-equal-tempered=20<br>intervals cumulatively, producing scales which<br>are best analyzed as blocks of constant numbers=20<br>of Herz, rather than cents.  See Ellis, C., "Pre-<br>Instrumental Scales," J. Ethnomusiology,<br>1962.)<br>The idea that higher harmonics above 6 might<br>somehow be "represented" by pitches in common<br>12-TET chords sounds very strange to us today,<br>but it was an extremely common idea in the<br>early part of this century. =20<br>Two currently-cited references which date from<br>the period 1900-1940 still contain these weird<br>ideas:  J. Murray Barbour's "Tuning and<br>Temperament" and Joseph Yasser's "Theory of<br>Evolving Tonality."  Barbour's book was published=20<br>in hardback in the 1950s, but was actually a<br>PhD thesis from the 1930s. =20<br>Joseph Yasser's "Theory of Evolving Temperament"<br>from 1932 also propounds this weird notion of<br>12-TET "containing" or "representing" high members<br>of the harmonic series like 13.  Yasser mentions=20<br>Scriabin's "mystic chord" approvingly,  & proposes an odd-<br>sounding and very dissonant hexad as the fundamental<br>"consonant" chord of 19-tone equal temperment:<br>the hexad consists of the 19-tone pitches<br>most closely approximating harmonics 8, 9, 10,<br>11, 13, 14 (if memory serves). Harmonic 12<br>was deliberately left out because it's 3 octaves<br>plus a perfect fifth, and since the perfect fifth<br>is 1/170 of an octave off from the harmonic-series<br>value in 19-tone equal temperament, Yasser<br>proscribed the use of that 19-tone interval.<br>(Yasser never explained how 9 could be obtained<br>if the harmonic 3 was proscribed. This, as Ivor<br>Darreg remarked, was one of the sacred Mysteries<br>of the Yasser religion.)<br>Today, of course, this all sounds incredibly weird.<br>No one to my knowledge composes in 19-tone<br>equal temperament according to Yasser's<br>strange hexad system, or his "supra-diatonic"<br>12-out-of-19 pitches. No one to my knowledge<br>who has heard and performed in 19-tet thinks<br>that Yasser's dissonant hexads are the most<br>consonant chords in 19-tet. (M. Joel Mandelbaum<br>did once compose a serial piece using 12-of-19=20<br>purely as a showpiece--a serial composition which<br>is atonal yet which *modulates.*  Try *that,*<br>Schoenberg!)  As Ivor Darreg and Easley<br>Blackwood have both pointed out, 19-TET<br>major and minor triads  sound smoother<br>than the equivalent structures in 12-TET...<br>the 19-TET minor triad particularly so.=20<br>Why Yasser chose to categorize the 19-tet<br>perfect fifth as "dissonant" is simply<br>inexplicable...unless you look at the=20<br>era he came out of.=20<br>It's impossible to understand the strange<br>reasoning behind Yasser's, Barbour's, Hindemith's<br>and Scriabin's theories of intonation and=20<br>musical harmony without realizing that to<br>music theorists in the early part of this<br>century, the harmonic series was a mistuned<br>approximation of 12-tone equal temperament.<br>Seen from that standpoint, it's obvious why<br>the harmonic series is "useless" above the<br>6th harmonic--at that point the harmonic<br>series begins to sound extremely "out of tune"=20<br>with 12-TET.=20<br>To us, in the 1990s, this sounds incredibly<br>odd--as though someone were to explain<br>that clean air is a badly degraded form of smog.<br>Yet such musical-theoretic notions were common=20<br>from 1900 until 1948,  when serialism took=20<br>over academia like an epidemic of Tulipomania.<br>--<br>Incidentally, you might think that modern music<br>theorists have put behind them the weird delusion<br>that harmonic series members are "out of tune"<br>12-TET pitches. Alas, such strange statements<br>are *still* being made in contemporary music=20<br>textbooks. The most glaring example I have found<br>recently is page 27 of "Materials and Structure<br>of Music, Vol. 1," 3rd edition, by Christ, DeLone,<br>Kliewer, Lowell and Thompson., 1988. On that page, ex.<br>2-10 shows "harmonic series on D."

(For example, the idea that<br>African music was far more rhythmically complex<br>than western music seems to have been alien to<br>music theorists of the early part of this century.<br>Ditto the notion that other cultures often didn't break<br>up a 2:1 interval into small whole number ratios,<br>but instead added non-just non-equal-tempered=20<br>intervals cumulatively, producing scales which<br>are best analyzed as blocks of constant numbers=20<br>of Herz, rather than cents.  See Ellis, C., "Pre-<br>Instrumental Scales," J. Ethnomusiology,<br>1962.)<br>The idea that higher harmonics above 6 might<br>somehow be "represented" by pitches in common<br>12-TET chords sounds very strange to us today,<br>but it was an extremely common idea in the<br>early part of this century. =20<br>Two currently-cited references which date from<br>the period 1900-1940 still contain these weird<br>ideas:  J. Murray Barbour's "Tuning and<br>Temperament" and Joseph Yasser's "Theory of<br>Evolving Tonality."  Barbour's book was published=20<br>in hardback in the 1950s, but was actually a<br>PhD thesis from the 1930s. =20<br>Joseph Yasser's "Theory of Evolving Temperament"<br>from 1932 also propounds this weird notion of<br>12-TET "containing" or "representing" high members<br>of the harmonic series like 13.  Yasser mentions=20<br>Scriabin's "mystic chord" approvingly,  & proposes an odd-<br>sounding and very dissonant hexad as the fundamental<br>"consonant" chord of 19-tone equal temperment:<br>the hexad consists of the 19-tone pitches<br>most closely approximating harmonics 8, 9, 10,<br>11, 13, 14 (if memory serves). Harmonic 12<br>was deliberately left out because it's 3 octaves<br>plus a perfect fifth, and since the perfect fifth<br>is 1/170 of an octave off from the harmonic-series<br>value in 19-tone equal temperament, Yasser<br>proscribed the use of that 19-tone interval.<br>(Yasser never explained how 9 could be obtained<br>if the harmonic 3 was proscribed. This, as Ivor<br>Darreg remarked, was one of the sacred Mysteries<br>of the Yasser religion.)<br>Today, of course, this all sounds incredibly weird.<br>No one to my knowledge composes in 19-tone<br>equal temperament according to Yasser's<br>strange hexad system, or his "supra-diatonic"<br>12-out-of-19 pitches. No one to my knowledge<br>who has heard and performed in 19-tet thinks<br>that Yasser's dissonant hexads are the most<br>consonant chords in 19-tet. (M. Joel Mandelbaum<br>did once compose a serial piece using 12-of-19=20<br>purely as a showpiece--a serial composition which<br>is atonal yet which *modulates.*  Try *that,*<br>Schoenberg!)  As Ivor Darreg and Easley<br>Blackwood have both pointed out, 19-TET<br>major and minor triads  sound smoother<br>than the equivalent structures in 12-TET...<br>the 19-TET minor triad particularly so.=20<br>Why Yasser chose to categorize the 19-tet<br>perfect fifth as "dissonant" is simply<br>inexplicable...unless you look at the=20<br>era he came out of.=20<br>It's impossible to understand the strange<br>reasoning behind Yasser's, Barbour's, Hindemith's<br>and Scriabin's theories of intonation and=20<br>musical harmony without realizing that to<br>music theorists in the early part of this<br>century, the harmonic series was a mistuned<br>approximation of 12-tone equal temperament.<br>Seen from that standpoint, it's obvious why<br>the harmonic series is "useless" above the<br>6th harmonic--at that point the harmonic<br>series begins to sound extremely "out of tune"=20<br>with 12-TET.=20<br>To us, in the 1990s, this sounds incredibly<br>odd--as though someone were to explain<br>that clean air is a badly degraded form of smog.<br>Yet such musical-theoretic notions were common=20<br>from 1900 until 1948,  when serialism took=20<br>over academia like an epidemic of Tulipomania.<br>--<br>Incidentally, you might think that modern music<br>theorists have put behind them the weird delusion<br>that harmonic series members are "out of tune"<br>12-TET pitches. Alas, such strange statements<br>are *still* being made in contemporary music=20<br>textbooks. The most glaring example I have found<br>recently is page 27 of "Materials and Structure<br>of Music, Vol. 1," 3rd edition, by Christ, DeLone,<br>Kliewer, Lowell and Thompson., 1988. On that page, ex.<br>2-10 shows "harmonic series on D."  But the harmonic<br>series members 1-10 are depicted as 12-TET notes<br>with no indication that that the pitches of the 12-TET<br>are any different from the pitches of the  "Natural=20<br>harmonic series"(!!!)<br>When William Alves suggested teaching music<br>theory by introducing the harmonic series, this<br>is probably *not* what he had in mind.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 24 Nov 1996 17:21 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05999; Sun, 24 Nov 1996 17:22:47 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05935<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA19527; Sun, 24 Nov 1996 08:22:44 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 24 Nov 1996 08:22:44 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.961124075830.10035C-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
