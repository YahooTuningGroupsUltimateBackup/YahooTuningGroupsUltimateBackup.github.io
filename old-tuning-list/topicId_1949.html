This <br>is what we are talking about now in my theory class at De Anza.  (weak <br>disclaimer: Im a student).  I don't <br>mean to single Reinhard's article out, but it connected with my thoughts <br>about music (among other things) so Id thought Id share.  I welcome all <br>responses, and they will all be included in future considerations of this <br>topic by me, and would be much appreciated.  I dont know about the big <br>Wagner music list, so cross-posting would definitely be appreciated.<br><br>This is in response to Johnny Reinhardt's in Tuning Digest 1044. <br><br>Heavens Gate, imminent doom, the first of april?<br>Aka, is quantization geometry reincarnate?<br><br>Good April Fools must be ernetsly sought out, you say.  Well I found a <br>bizzare one today on television, the great source you mentioned.  I dont <br>think its a joke though, and Im sitting here contemplating the universe <br>because I just flipped out when I realized I solved a crime:<br>                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                   <br>I was watching the ch2 news, right after seeing a time-warped episode of <br>the Xfiles.  The story was of a man who escaped from prison this morning <br>and kidnapped a man named Brian Kelly.  The journalist showed video of <br>Brian Kelly being interviewed publicly.  Then, the news described the <br>escaped convict as a master of disguises and has been known to dress as a <br>womam, and was in the AIDS unit of the prison in Vacaville, CA.  The <br>convict, David Anderson, was then shown dressed as a woman, along with <br>about four other pictures of him in other disguises from the police <br>archive.  The news explained Kelly's story as Kelly was kidnapped near <br>the prison and they went to a motel.  However, when I saw the faces flash <br>by in the montage of the guises of David Anderson, I recognized the face <br>of Brian Kelly, and linked the two people forever like anti-particles.  <br>It was the mug shot of a false face that tipped it off.  The face of <br>Brian Kelly belongs to the elaborate and complicated imagination of a <br>convicted murderer, David Anderson.  The avatar of Brian Kelly was empty <br>and without a soul. He complained that he was afraid to call the police <br>at first.  He faulted fear.  This ocurrs at many conceptual levels.  <br>Almost boggles the mind.  I think this reporting television journalist <br>has created the perfect and sweetest "scoops" of the century, although it <br>was incomplete without the 'anti-matter' like link between Brian Kelly <br>and David Anderson. <br><br>That is basically it, but since Im also in Logic class this quarter, I <br>would like now talk about that some more.<br><br>The conclusion to my argument is that this man needs to be arrested <br>because To complete the last link of my story, they would need to match <br>the true identity of Brian Kelly with the escaped prisoner's.  The media <br>story of a kidnapping was part of the "plan" in the convicts mind.  It is <br>now time for the scene in Scooby-Doo to take off the mask.<br><br>It doesn't exactly end there.  No, this is where the universe starts <br>collapsing, and we start to get into time travel and stuff. <br><br>I was just watching X files right before the news tonite.  The episode <br>was about a man who becomes 'enlightened' frightfully by inventing and <br>manufacturing a chemical substance which apparently freezes the body to <br>0K (impossible in this universe) and allows unrestricted travel through <br>time, because matter is transformed by the infinities to "Tachyon" energy <br>particles, which travel both backward and forward in time because of <br>their absolute smallness and unity of existence (devoide of creation, the <br>energy perspective of newton's conservation of mass and energy).  In this <br>Universe, only unities and singularities exhibt strange and odd <br>perplexing time-domain characteristics.  For this reason, it makes an <br>great TV show.  Any way, this guy shoots up this freezing agent in the <br>future and slips back about 5 hours and tries to stop himself from <br>created what he did.  Notice creation is involved.  We said that being <br>devoid of creation (not in the religious sense, but the newtonioan) was a <br>characteristic of only the absolutely small (energy, 0Kelvin, the absence <br>of energy, which denies conservation).   As you can see indeed the loops <br>created by these arguments cycle deeper and deeper in to the infinities <br>they describe, like a snake nourishing itself eternally on its yummy <br>tail.  A very good marketing ploy for Silicon Valley drones is used by <br>the television media to feature logically inquisitive programming (such <br>as self-reference, infinite loops, quantum mechanics, astrophysics), plus <br>familiar internet distributed "urban folklore" issues of debate on <br>alt.legends.urban-folklore (like cryobiology), occult numerology (I quote <br>from the show, 'I wrote when I was 23..').  On the show, the man who <br>invented time travel by evil and murderous means (it happened in a <br>different universe) comes back to prevent himself from doing it.  They <br>first meet outside.  The man slipped back in time and he appeared older, <br>suffering from the effects of super-light-speed travel.  At any point in <br>the show, one might refute the logic as completely invalid because of the <br>infinite loops, but you have to remember its television, and it is a <br>dramatic representation of a scientific reality which does actually <br>ocurr.  The broadest term I can think of strait off is 'string theory'.  <br>This gentelman represents an infinitely massive AND nearly absolutely <br>small event that ocurrs regularly.  Basiclly its a long string of energy <br>which climbs through different universes, or different dimentions.  <br>Imagine 26 dimentions and 11 universes.  The string crawls in and out <br>near the worm hole's in time, black holes, as described by Steven Hawking <br>in _A Brief History of Time_ (1998).  This new york times best seller is <br>written by a man most people claim is "enlightened" in possibly the same <br>way the mad scientist in the X files was, or more directly, in the same <br>way that the Sqaure of Abott's _Flatland_ (1898) was enlightened by the <br>Sphere from the land of solids (three physical dimentions).  The <br>appearance of the string in our universe is evidenced by anti-matter <br>pairs which occur very near singularities like black holes.  Acording to <br>Hawking, black holes give off measurable photon like gamma-ray <br>radiation.  This is an energy they emit because near a black hole, pairs <br>of short-lived anti-particles pop into existence from apparently <br>nothing.  They live an extremely, and near absolutely short life, but it <br>is sizable enough to rule out infinitude error.  According to the rule of <br>gravity, the particles coming into existence out of seeming nothingness <br>must be affected by the nearby singularity, the black hole.  Its pretty <br>massive, its mass distributed across all the dimensions in an infinitely <br>small space.  One of these particles may indeed fall prey to the black <br>hole, but the other escapes into the night sky as gamma-ray radiation.  <br>The wave pattern of the radiation is retained from the original <br>pan-dimentional "string" it formerly belonged to.  Pan-dimentiality and <br>enlightened knowledge are deeply connected with Hawkings' reports, which <br>are similar in inquisitive nature as Flatland is.  They both regard <br>pan-dimentiality as an ultimate question, and science for entertainment <br>(literary devices, drama, personification).  These lead to logically <br>invalid increases in order and level of structure.  Or do they, well I <br>dont really know that.  A not-so-final point is that all the arguments <br>here revert to infinitudes, except for the last it appears.  That is the <br>logical background of the so-called grand unification theory member called <br>'string theory'.  Its strength is in the admission of finite <br>measurement at the core of logical statement, which is the anti-matter <br>pair, one emitted and measured, the other sucked to visit other <br>dimentions in a black hole.<br>As a point of coincidence, I had been flipping through Hawkings' book less <br>than two hours previous to viewing the television show and news report, <br>explaining the String Theory and the chapter called 'why black hole's <br>ain't so black'.<br><br>It gets wierder.  Since Im a music major:<br>Richard Wagner created a wonderfully playful artform in the romantic era <br>of musical theory.  His music and ideas about drama and life itself <br>influenced and created a perspective for ironically-named great men: <br>Nietzche "God is Dead", Hitler (_Mein Kampf_), Straus (_Also Sprach <br>Zarathustra_, Death and Transfuguration_).  Dozens of present day popular <br>images also fit under Wagnerian Art, such as Kubric's _2001_ film about <br>Possibility of Pan Dimentional enlightenment.  Wagner was a student of <br>the classics, and was no doubt knowledgable by Zoroastrianistic and Hindu <br>traditions regarding pan-dimentional enlightenment, avatarism, and <br>reincarnation as their 'unification theory'.   The genius of Wagner by <br>this argument is that since its so entertaining to study this stuff and <br>create with it, you can acheive anything want, and become rich and <br>famous.  Modern examples like musical ensemble KMFDM(A drug against <br>war), Einsteurzende Neubauten (_Hamlet Machine_), Kubric (film direction), <br>John Williams (Jaws, Star Wars music), mimic the initial success that Wagner <br>enjoyed as a National Socialist afficionado. <br><br>The stickieness of these arguments are they they tend to duplicate <br>themselves easily, and thats why there are so important to modern day <br>society.  People will soon be confused about reality.  A friend of a <br>friend is filming a movie, for which I will produce the sound track, <br>about a Jesuit involved in a church cover-up of news of a "companion" <br>space craft trailing comet Hale-Bopp.  Its made its pass a few days ago <br>(Reality has entered the scene again).  <br><br>In looping arguments, the point of being sucked in intellectually is <br>called the "pattern" by philosophers.  In eventual, momentary existence, <br>we call it coincidence, paralellism, and according to Douglas Hofstadter <br>(_Godel, Escher, Bach: the Eternal Golden Braid_), isomorphism.<br><br>The essential looping argument is born when the argument gains the <br>ability to reason about itself, says Hofstadter.  In symbolic logic, this <br>is described by the meta-mathematics of Godel.  In sound form, this is <br>described by Bach's _Art of the Fugue_.  In visual form, this is <br>represented in the work of MC Escher.  When an art form includes all <br>senses of the goings about of daily life, that is a "Wagnerian" ideal.  <br>It is complete because it has the ability to talk about itself.  <br>Therefore you can never have completeness and consistency together in <br>natural systems.  What you get is a choice between the two.  Either you <br>laugh or you don't, right?  In Bach's case, I laugh, its very beautiful, <br>and worthwile art. In the case of the UNABOMer, I remain paranoid and <br>skeptical, not laughing. <br><br>    "Blood has been shed" says a kidnapper in the movie "Fargo".<br><br>Robert Anton Wilson wrote a play called "Reality is only what you Make of <br>It".  My email program just crashed but thank goodness its set for direct <br>to disk composition, so I didn't just loose 3 hours of mindless ranting.<br>Anywho- Some folks from San Diego went nuts and bought into the story, <br>which originated as a folklore tale on the internet.  Heavan's Gate was <br>an internet publishing company.  It might have been a pan dimentional <br>marketing ploy to get more people over to the site, which still serves an <br>enourmous amount of people everyday around the world; this is just like <br>any other conspiracy and enlightened super-logical devoted man might <br>create, and be trapped in forever (in death).  <br><br>This apparent Hellish eternal damnation to the world of cries and moans <br>(a Masonic Parsifal reference) was dramatically played out by detectives <br>in the X Files show I saw tonite.  The mad scientist who goes back to <br>meet himself five hours in the past, eventually anhiliates himself by <br>joining with himself (anti-matter particles "anhiliate" when the meet <br>each other and go back into the nether-reaches of other dimentions).  So <br>his character explains to himself before he anhiliates with himself that <br>he has "seen" everything.  "Imagine what it would be like to know <br>everything that has ever happened and ever will happen" he says.<br>His demise is dramatically powerful, as the two men draw nearer to each <br>other, moaning and wailing louder and louder and closer and closer until <br>they both spontaneously combust (anhiliation logically) and not a trace <br>of their physical beings is left behind in this Universe.  <br><br>I was discussing the possibility of time travel with my fiance, who is <br>studying oriental phylosophy and medicine academically.  Her question was <br>it could it exist, because why couldn't it?  It was completely puzzling <br>to both of us, and I could only explain it away with the looped argument <br>that since time travel could possibly destroy the universe as we know it <br>in a paradox situation (Shades of fascism, Hitler) <br><br>Using loops as natually occuring logical entities (be they valid or <br>invalid), is an important spring-tool when developing a wholesome and <br>organic view of "life, the universe, and everything." --Douglas Adams <br>quoted from _The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy_, which incedentally is <br>about how the planet earth is a project of two pan-dimentional beings <br>incarnated as a pair of white mice to discover the meaning of life.  I <br>say, when brought back to reality, the fruits of such a project would be <br>combined and unified with James Lovelock's "Gaia Theory" of earth as a <br>super-organism.  What is the meaning of life you ask?  This is an <br>actually news item from an National Public Radio news item:<br><br>                              From NPR:<br>[10.]     [FORTY-TWO] - We explain that the preliminary results of a<br>new measurement of the so-called Hubble Constant, taken by radio<br>telescopic means at Cambridge University in England is 42. The Hubble<br>Constant determines the speed at which galaxies are receding from each<br>other, and thus tells us the age of the universe from the time of the<br>Big Bang. It so happens that Douglas Adams, in the book and radio<br>series "A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" in 1978 had a massive<br>computer calculate the meaning of life and the answer was: 42.<br>(2:15) (IN STEREO)<br><br><br>The news story in question was found during an internet search for <br>"Douglas Adams" and was written by NPR in 1997.  The Adams' text explains <br>dramatically that the giant computer is actually Earth, which gets <br>destroyed minutes before completing its sole computation, in the grand <br>fashion of good science fiction, it is knocked out to make way for a <br>hyper-space bypass.  This hyper-space bypass resembles the theory of <br>Black holes as worm holes through dimentions, and the string theory, <br>where mass travels in and out of our dimentional planes.<br><br><br>Master of Disguises.<br><br>I would also, for the sake of my English 1b class, relate the whole <br>shooting match to the UNABOMer case and Logging Industry.  Now the <br>UNABOMer went nuts and killed a whole lot of people who were big players <br>in anti-socialist attitudes toward nature, such as non-sustainable <br>plunder of natural resources, which the UNABOMer explains in his <br>so-called Manifesto.  In the traditionally apocalyptic manifesto style, <br>the UNABOMer details his thought processes (delusion of reality) in order <br>to validate extreme action as a means toward the goal of socialization of <br>resources: ultimate sustainability, which is completely inconsistent with <br>our present lifestyles (garbage cycles as replacement ecosystems).

The ultimate goal of life the universe and everything is thus <br>said to be (although still in process) the discovery of the answer to <br>everything, a single piece of logic that just about sums it up for this <br>universe, such as the many incarnations of Forcess*Accelleration which <br>have been cropping up since Newton.

Anyways, this is where I <br>need to do some research instead of typing, hehehe.  (Resist the <br>Temptation to Code, programming teachers tell me)<br><br>In the BBC Doctor Who series, the Doctor is a series of pan-dimentional <br>incarnations who patrol the universe for violators of space-time <br>continuum policy, which is governed by his race, called "Time-Lord".  An <br>errant timelord called the Master (an enlighted being dressed in black, <br>who speaks in circles, and is the parallel of the Fallen Angel in <br>christian theology) is the usuall suspect for Doctor Who, who's job it is <br>to foil the Master's criminal plans to rule the universe by exploiting <br>time travel.  The X-files episode on tonite had a Doctor-Who-like flavor.<br>The Fallen Angel is associated with infinite hell in conservative <br>christian theologies, just as the mad scientist had ended his life by <br>entering the infinite by flaming spontaneosly (a "hellish" and terrific <br>way to go).  <br><br>A recent communication event between artists of this type of logic was <br>billed as follows on an MIT internet document <br>(http://www-mitepress.mit.edu/LEA/bkissues/lea2-6.txt)<br><br>file quoted here The conference is being organized in commemoration of the 200th <br>birthday of the  Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers.

Well I found a <br>bizzare one today on television, the great source you mentioned.  I dont <br>think its a joke though, and Im sitting here contemplating the universe <br>because I just flipped out when I realized I solved a crime:<br>                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                   <br>I was watching the ch2 news, right after seeing a time-warped episode of <br>the Xfiles.  The story was of a man who escaped from prison this morning <br>and kidnapped a man named Brian Kelly.  The journalist showed video of <br>Brian Kelly being interviewed publicly.  Then, the news described the <br>escaped convict as a master of disguises and has been known to dress as a <br>womam, and was in the AIDS unit of the prison in Vacaville, CA.  The <br>convict, David Anderson, was then shown dressed as a woman, along with <br>about four other pictures of him in other disguises from the police <br>archive.  The news explained Kelly's story as Kelly was kidnapped near <br>the prison and they went to a motel.  However, when I saw the faces flash <br>by in the montage of the guises of David Anderson, I recognized the face <br>of Brian Kelly, and linked the two people forever like anti-particles.  <br>It was the mug shot of a false face that tipped it off.  The face of <br>Brian Kelly belongs to the elaborate and complicated imagination of a <br>convicted murderer, David Anderson.  The avatar of Brian Kelly was empty <br>and without a soul. He complained that he was afraid to call the police <br>at first.  He faulted fear.  This ocurrs at many conceptual levels.  <br>Almost boggles the mind.  I think this reporting television journalist <br>has created the perfect and sweetest "scoops" of the century, although it <br>was incomplete without the 'anti-matter' like link between Brian Kelly <br>and David Anderson. <br><br>That is basically it, but since Im also in Logic class this quarter, I <br>would like now talk about that some more.<br><br>The conclusion to my argument is that this man needs to be arrested <br>because To complete the last link of my story, they would need to match <br>the true identity of Brian Kelly with the escaped prisoner's.  The media <br>story of a kidnapping was part of the "plan" in the convicts mind.  It is <br>now time for the scene in Scooby-Doo to take off the mask.<br><br>It doesn't exactly end there.  No, this is where the universe starts <br>collapsing, and we start to get into time travel and stuff. <br><br>I was just watching X files right before the news tonite.  The episode <br>was about a man who becomes 'enlightened' frightfully by inventing and <br>manufacturing a chemical substance which apparently freezes the body to <br>0K (impossible in this universe) and allows unrestricted travel through <br>time, because matter is transformed by the infinities to "Tachyon" energy <br>particles, which travel both backward and forward in time because of <br>their absolute smallness and unity of existence (devoide of creation, the <br>energy perspective of newton's conservation of mass and energy).  In this <br>Universe, only unities and singularities exhibt strange and odd <br>perplexing time-domain characteristics.  For this reason, it makes an <br>great TV show.  Any way, this guy shoots up this freezing agent in the <br>future and slips back about 5 hours and tries to stop himself from <br>created what he did.  Notice creation is involved.  We said that being <br>devoid of creation (not in the religious sense, but the newtonioan) was a <br>characteristic of only the absolutely small (energy, 0Kelvin, the absence <br>of energy, which denies conservation).   As you can see indeed the loops <br>created by these arguments cycle deeper and deeper in to the infinities <br>they describe, like a snake nourishing itself eternally on its yummy <br>tail.  A very good marketing ploy for Silicon Valley drones is used by <br>the television media to feature logically inquisitive programming (such <br>as self-reference, infinite loops, quantum mechanics, astrophysics), plus <br>familiar internet distributed "urban folklore" issues of debate on <br>alt.legends.urban-folklore (like cryobiology), occult numerology (I quote <br>from the show, 'I wrote when I was 23..').  On the show, the man who <br>invented time travel by evil and murderous means (it happened in a <br>different universe) comes back to prevent himself from doing it.  They <br>first meet outside.  The man slipped back in time and he appeared older, <br>suffering from the effects of super-light-speed travel.  At any point in <br>the show, one might refute the logic as completely invalid because of the <br>infinite loops, but you have to remember its television, and it is a <br>dramatic representation of a scientific reality which does actually <br>ocurr.  The broadest term I can think of strait off is 'string theory'.  <br>This gentelman represents an infinitely massive AND nearly absolutely <br>small event that ocurrs regularly.  Basiclly its a long string of energy <br>which climbs through different universes, or different dimentions.  <br>Imagine 26 dimentions and 11 universes.  The string crawls in and out <br>near the worm hole's in time, black holes, as described by Steven Hawking <br>in _A Brief History of Time_ (1998).  This new york times best seller is <br>written by a man most people claim is "enlightened" in possibly the same <br>way the mad scientist in the X files was, or more directly, in the same <br>way that the Sqaure of Abott's _Flatland_ (1898) was enlightened by the <br>Sphere from the land of solids (three physical dimentions).  The <br>appearance of the string in our universe is evidenced by anti-matter <br>pairs which occur very near singularities like black holes.  Acording to <br>Hawking, black holes give off measurable photon like gamma-ray <br>radiation.  This is an energy they emit because near a black hole, pairs <br>of short-lived anti-particles pop into existence from apparently <br>nothing.  They live an extremely, and near absolutely short life, but it <br>is sizable enough to rule out infinitude error.  According to the rule of <br>gravity, the particles coming into existence out of seeming nothingness <br>must be affected by the nearby singularity, the black hole.  Its pretty <br>massive, its mass distributed across all the dimensions in an infinitely <br>small space.  One of these particles may indeed fall prey to the black <br>hole, but the other escapes into the night sky as gamma-ray radiation.  <br>The wave pattern of the radiation is retained from the original <br>pan-dimentional "string" it formerly belonged to.  Pan-dimentiality and <br>enlightened knowledge are deeply connected with Hawkings' reports, which <br>are similar in inquisitive nature as Flatland is.  They both regard <br>pan-dimentiality as an ultimate question, and science for entertainment <br>(literary devices, drama, personification).  These lead to logically <br>invalid increases in order and level of structure.  Or do they, well I <br>dont really know that.  A not-so-final point is that all the arguments <br>here revert to infinitudes, except for the last it appears.  That is the <br>logical background of the so-called grand unification theory member called <br>'string theory'.  Its strength is in the admission of finite <br>measurement at the core of logical statement, which is the anti-matter <br>pair, one emitted and measured, the other sucked to visit other <br>dimentions in a black hole.<br>As a point of coincidence, I had been flipping through Hawkings' book less <br>than two hours previous to viewing the television show and news report, <br>explaining the String Theory and the chapter called 'why black hole's <br>ain't so black'.<br><br>It gets wierder.  Since Im a music major:<br>Richard Wagner created a wonderfully playful artform in the romantic era <br>of musical theory.  His music and ideas about drama and life itself <br>influenced and created a perspective for ironically-named great men: <br>Nietzche "God is Dead", Hitler (_Mein Kampf_), Straus (_Also Sprach <br>Zarathustra_, Death and Transfuguration_).  Dozens of present day popular <br>images also fit under Wagnerian Art, such as Kubric's _2001_ film about <br>Possibility of Pan Dimentional enlightenment.  Wagner was a student of <br>the classics, and was no doubt knowledgable by Zoroastrianistic and Hindu <br>traditions regarding pan-dimentional enlightenment, avatarism, and <br>reincarnation as their 'unification theory'.   The genius of Wagner by <br>this argument is that since its so entertaining to study this stuff and <br>create with it, you can acheive anything want, and become rich and <br>famous.  Modern examples like musical ensemble KMFDM(A drug against <br>war), Einsteurzende Neubauten (_Hamlet Machine_), Kubric (film direction), <br>John Williams (Jaws, Star Wars music), mimic the initial success that Wagner <br>enjoyed as a National Socialist afficionado. <br><br>The stickieness of these arguments are they they tend to duplicate <br>themselves easily, and thats why there are so important to modern day <br>society.  People will soon be confused about reality.  A friend of a <br>friend is filming a movie, for which I will produce the sound track, <br>about a Jesuit involved in a church cover-up of news of a "companion" <br>space craft trailing comet Hale-Bopp.  Its made its pass a few days ago <br>(Reality has entered the scene again).  <br><br>In looping arguments, the point of being sucked in intellectually is <br>called the "pattern" by philosophers.  In eventual, momentary existence, <br>we call it coincidence, paralellism, and according to Douglas Hofstadter <br>(_Godel, Escher, Bach: the Eternal Golden Braid_), isomorphism.<br><br>The essential looping argument is born when the argument gains the <br>ability to reason about itself, says Hofstadter.  In symbolic logic, this <br>is described by the meta-mathematics of Godel.  In sound form, this is <br>described by Bach's _Art of the Fugue_.  In visual form, this is <br>represented in the work of MC Escher.  When an art form includes all <br>senses of the goings about of daily life, that is a "Wagnerian" ideal.  <br>It is complete because it has the ability to talk about itself.  <br>Therefore you can never have completeness and consistency together in <br>natural systems.  What you get is a choice between the two.  Either you <br>laugh or you don't, right?  In Bach's case, I laugh, its very beautiful, <br>and worthwile art. In the case of the UNABOMer, I remain paranoid and <br>skeptical, not laughing. <br><br>    "Blood has been shed" says a kidnapper in the movie "Fargo".<br><br>Robert Anton Wilson wrote a play called "Reality is only what you Make of <br>It".  My email program just crashed but thank goodness its set for direct <br>to disk composition, so I didn't just loose 3 hours of mindless ranting.<br>Anywho- Some folks from San Diego went nuts and bought into the story, <br>which originated as a folklore tale on the internet.  Heavan's Gate was <br>an internet publishing company.  It might have been a pan dimentional <br>marketing ploy to get more people over to the site, which still serves an <br>enourmous amount of people everyday around the world; this is just like <br>any other conspiracy and enlightened super-logical devoted man might <br>create, and be trapped in forever (in death).  <br><br>This apparent Hellish eternal damnation to the world of cries and moans <br>(a Masonic Parsifal reference) was dramatically played out by detectives <br>in the X Files show I saw tonite.  The mad scientist who goes back to <br>meet himself five hours in the past, eventually anhiliates himself by <br>joining with himself (anti-matter particles "anhiliate" when the meet <br>each other and go back into the nether-reaches of other dimentions).  So <br>his character explains to himself before he anhiliates with himself that <br>he has "seen" everything.  "Imagine what it would be like to know <br>everything that has ever happened and ever will happen" he says.<br>His demise is dramatically powerful, as the two men draw nearer to each <br>other, moaning and wailing louder and louder and closer and closer until <br>they both spontaneously combust (anhiliation logically) and not a trace <br>of their physical beings is left behind in this Universe.  <br><br>I was discussing the possibility of time travel with my fiance, who is <br>studying oriental phylosophy and medicine academically.  Her question was <br>it could it exist, because why couldn't it?  It was completely puzzling <br>to both of us, and I could only explain it away with the looped argument <br>that since time travel could possibly destroy the universe as we know it <br>in a paradox situation (Shades of fascism, Hitler) <br><br>Using loops as natually occuring logical entities (be they valid or <br>invalid), is an important spring-tool when developing a wholesome and <br>organic view of "life, the universe, and everything." --Douglas Adams <br>quoted from _The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy_, which incedentally is <br>about how the planet earth is a project of two pan-dimentional beings <br>incarnated as a pair of white mice to discover the meaning of life.  I <br>say, when brought back to reality, the fruits of such a project would be <br>combined and unified with James Lovelock's "Gaia Theory" of earth as a <br>super-organism.  What is the meaning of life you ask?  This is an <br>actually news item from an National Public Radio news item:<br><br>                              From NPR:<br>[10.]     [FORTY-TWO] - We explain that the preliminary results of a<br>new measurement of the so-called Hubble Constant, taken by radio<br>telescopic means at Cambridge University in England is 42. The Hubble<br>Constant determines the speed at which galaxies are receding from each<br>other, and thus tells us the age of the universe from the time of the<br>Big Bang. It so happens that Douglas Adams, in the book and radio<br>series "A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" in 1978 had a massive<br>computer calculate the meaning of life and the answer was: 42.<br>(2:15) (IN STEREO)<br><br><br>The news story in question was found during an internet search for <br>"Douglas Adams" and was written by NPR in 1997.  The Adams' text explains <br>dramatically that the giant computer is actually Earth, which gets <br>destroyed minutes before completing its sole computation, in the grand <br>fashion of good science fiction, it is knocked out to make way for a <br>hyper-space bypass.  This hyper-space bypass resembles the theory of <br>Black holes as worm holes through dimentions, and the string theory, <br>where mass travels in and out of our dimentional planes.<br><br><br>Master of Disguises.<br><br>I would also, for the sake of my English 1b class, relate the whole <br>shooting match to the UNABOMer case and Logging Industry.  Now the <br>UNABOMer went nuts and killed a whole lot of people who were big players <br>in anti-socialist attitudes toward nature, such as non-sustainable <br>plunder of natural resources, which the UNABOMer explains in his <br>so-called Manifesto.  In the traditionally apocalyptic manifesto style, <br>the UNABOMer details his thought processes (delusion of reality) in order <br>to validate extreme action as a means toward the goal of socialization of <br>resources: ultimate sustainability, which is completely inconsistent with <br>our present lifestyles (garbage cycles as replacement ecosystems).

The ultimate goal of life the universe and everything is thus <br>said to be (although still in process) the discovery of the answer to <br>everything, a single piece of logic that just about sums it up for this <br>universe, such as the many incarnations of Forcess*Accelleration which <br>have been cropping up since Newton.

(Resist the <br>Temptation to Code, programming teachers tell me)<br><br>In the BBC Doctor Who series, the Doctor is a series of pan-dimentional <br>incarnations who patrol the universe for violators of space-time <br>continuum policy, which is governed by his race, called "Time-Lord".
