Also<br>about which manufacturers support non-12, and<br>to what extent.<br>Here's a recap:<br>-------------------------------------------------<br>First, the manufacturers.  Yamaha, Waldorf, E-Mu<br>(in its line of stand-alone sound modules) and Ensoniq are<br>firmly dedicated to supporting microtonality on their<br>synths.  <br>Akai, Peavey , Roland and Kawai, on the other hand, are <br>implacably hostile to microtonality.  These companies <br>have never manufactured a synth that can be detuned.  <br>They'd be delighted if everyone on this tuning forum<br>died of Ebola virus.  These companies are ruthlessly<br>dedicated to preventing anyone, anywhere from breaking<br>out of the twelve-tone equal tempered scale.<br>Oberheim, Kurzweil and Korg are sitting on the fence. Some of<br>their synths support non-12, some don't.  Kurzweil and<br>Korg both build synths that allow all 12 notes per octave<br>to be retuned--but ONLY 12 notes at a time, and ONLY<br>within the octave.<br>----------------------------------------------------<br>The companies can be broken down into:<br>GOOD GUYS               BAD GUYS                FENCE-SITTERS<br>Yamaha          Kawai           Oberheim<br>Ensoniq         Akai                    Korg<br>Waldorf         Peavey          Kurzweil<br>E-Mu                    Alesis<br>                        Roland<br><br>This is important to those of you who want to compose <br>non-12 music.

A piece composed by a member of<br>this forum using pitch-bends for retuning has prompted<br>the question from everyone who's heard it: "What's wrong<br>with the weird sliding attacks on those notes?"<br>Plus pich-bends clog MIDI's datastream, especially in fast music.<br>If you're thinking of composing in non-12, best to pick<br>up a synth by Yamaha, Ensoniq, Waldorf, Oberheim or E-Mu.<br>Avoid synths by Peavey, Akai, Kawai, Alesis, Roland or Korg.<br>-----------------------------------------------------<br>Second:<br>A lot of people are confused about what "retunable" means.<br>By retunable, I mean that any key on the synth can be tuned<br>to any pitch desired.  So middle C can sound A0, 27.5 Hz, or<br>it can sound A8.  The keyboard can be turned upside-down, <br>tuned to a just scale, an equal-tempered scale, a non-just<br>non-equal-tempered scale, a non-octave scale, or anything<br>at all.<br>Any other synth is *not* retunable.  It may allow you to<br>tweak a few notes, or mess with pitch-bend, but sooner<br>or later you'll get frustrated.  Sooner or later a synth<br>without full keyboard retuning will *PREVENT* you from<br>producing the pitches you want to hear.<br>Only a few synths are retunable.  They have what are called<br>pitch tables.  A pitch table is a set of 128 memory locations<br>that contain the note number and a pitch.  By setting each of<br>the 128 internal memory locations to any pitch, you can get<br>any tuning desired.<br>Tuning accuracy is usually not nearly as important as full-<br>keyboard retunability.  Very few people will notice the <br>difference between a tuning resolution of 768 parts per <br>octave and a resolution of 1024 parts per octave... But <br>everyone with ears instantly hears the difference between a<br>synth which only allows 12 notes of 19 and a synth that<br>allows ALL 19 NOTES of 19. <br>A few synths even allow more than 1 tuning table.  The<br>advantage of these  is that they permit just intonation<br>composers to modulate quickly and easily between <br>different just arrays.  If you're a JI composer, this is no<br>trivial matter!  In fact it may well prove the most<br>important decision you make when choosing a synth<br>to compose with.<br>So JI fans,  pay special attention to the section<br>marked MULTIPLE TUNING TABLES below.<br>------------------------------------------------<br>Here in detail are the models (by manufacturer) :<br><br>ENSONIQ<br>Mirage - Full keyboard, 256 parts per octave or<br>            4096/octave by entering all 60 notes<br>            Requires Dick Lord's UPWARD CONCEPTS<br>            alternative operating system disk or<br>            Buzz Kimball's alternative OS disk.<br>ESQ-1, ESQ-M, SQ-80 - Only retunable within 12 notes<br>            per octave.

The advantage,<br>             however, is that (unlike any other synth<br>               on this list) you get a FULL 10 OCTAVES<br>             of notes in any scale you want, 768/oct<br>             resolution.<br>TX81Z, DX11  -  Full keyboard retuning, 768/oct.<br>DX7 with E!  - Full keyboard retuning, 1024/oct.<br>TX7 - NOT RETUNABLE!<br>TX816 - NOT RETUNABLE!<br>DX7II, TX802 - Full keyboard retuning, 1024 /oct<br>SY-22, TG-55 - NOT RETUNABLE!<br>TG-77, SY-77, SY-99 - Full keyboard retuning, 1024/oct.<br>>>>>> IMPORTANT!

It works, but it's<br>a godawful kludge.<br>One addendum to the above table: observant<br>readers will have noticed that the info for<br>Ensoniq samplers is not quite accurate.  Since<br>a tuning is stored with the layer to which a<br>sample is assigned, and since Ensoniq samplers<br>can use up to 8 different layers within each<br>channel, there is a theoretical maximum of<br>64 different tuning tables possible on an<br>Ensoniq EPS, EPS-16+, or ASR-10.  In practice<br>memory runs out long before the 64-layer<br>limit is reached, however.<br>-------------------------------------<br>Third (and last):<br>Here's a very quick overview:<br><br>ONLY 1 COMPANY MAKES A FULL-KEYBOARD<br>RETUNABLE SAMPLER: ENSONIQ<br>If you want to compose or perform using<br>a sampler in non-12, you have ONLY 3 CHOICES:<br>The ASR-10, a used EPS-16+ or a used EPS.  NO<br>OTHER SAMPLER ON THE PLANET HAS A<br>TUNING TABLE!<br><br>>>>>>> IMPORTANT!  IMPORTANT! <<<<<<<<br>The only synths recommended for<br>those who want to compose or perform<br>in non-12 are:<br><br>Yamaha DX7 w/E!, DX7II, TX802, TG-77,<br>TX81Z, FB-01, SY-77, SY-99, VL-1, VL-1M<br>Ensoniq  VFX, VFX-SQ, TS-10<br>Waldorf  MicroWave, Wave<br>E-MU   Proteus I, Proteus II, Proteus III,<br>        Morpheus, Classic Keys, Proteus FX,<br>          Ultraproteus<br><br>Time and time again, I've seen people<br>buy a synth *not* on this list.  Time and time<br>again, they get interested in microtonality...<br>and discover their synth is *locked into 12*,<br>or locked into only 12 notes out 19, or 12<br>notes out of 31, or 12 harmonic series pitches,<br>or 12 notes out of Harry Partch's 43...<br>The frustration and rage and hair-pulling<br>frenzy  this produces cannot be adequately<br>described.  It's unbelievably maddening to<br>discover that your shiny new $3000 synth<br>*CANNOT* produce the pitches you want to<br>hear.<br>So those interested in composition or performance<br>in non-12 would do well to choose wisely (as<br>the knight in "Indiana Jones and the Quest for<br>the Holy Grail" put it) and pick one of the<br>synths on the RECOMMENDED list.  Otherwise,<br>dollars to doughnuts, you are going to let<br>yourself in for a whole *world* of frustration.<br><br>IMPORTANT: IF YOU LIKE A PARTICULAR SYNTH<br>BUT ARE BUGGED THAT THE MANUFACTURER<br>DOESN'T OFFER RETUNABILITY, WRITE A LETTER<br>TO THE MANUFACTURER.

Tuning is stored on disk along <br>            with the sound sample.<br>SQ-1, SQ-1R - NOT RETUNABLE!<br>Also, none of Ensoniq's dedicated piano modules are<br>retunable.<br><br>KURZWEIL<br>Only one of their modules or synths built before the<br>company was sold to Young Chang is retunable.<br>K-150, K-1000  - Only within 12 notes per octave.<br>K-2000, K-2000S - Only within 12 notes per octave<br><br>ROLAND<br>None of this company's synths can be retuned in<br>any way, shape or form<br><br>ALESIS<br>Quadrasynth - NOT RETUNABLE!<br><br>YAMAHA<br>FB-01   - Retunable ONLY by sending each note-on<br>             as a sys-ex message.  Only Larry<br>             Polansky's HMSL currently supports<br>             retuning on this synth.  The advantage,<br>             however, is that (unlike any other synth<br>               on this list) you get a FULL 10 OCTAVES<br>             of notes in any scale you want, 768/oct<br>             resolution.<br>TX81Z, DX11  -  Full keyboard retuning, 768/oct.<br>DX7 with E!  - Full keyboard retuning, 1024/oct.<br>TX7 - NOT RETUNABLE!<br>TX816 - NOT RETUNABLE!<br>DX7II, TX802 - Full keyboard retuning, 1024 /oct<br>SY-22, TG-55 - NOT RETUNABLE!<br>TG-77, SY-77, SY-99 - Full keyboard retuning, 1024/oct.<br>>>>>> IMPORTANT!  No Yamaha sampler can be retuned. <<<<< <br>VL-1, VL-1M - Full keyboard retuning, 1024/oct.<br><br>OBERHEIM<br>Their latest (1993) rack-mount synth apparently allows<br>+ and - 50 cents retunability for each of the<br>12 notes in the octave.  No more than 12 retuned<br>notes per octave are allowed.  <br><br>E-MU<br>Proteus I, Proteus XL - Full keyboard retuning, 768/oct.<br>Ultraproteus -- full retuning, 768/oct. <br>Proteus II, Proteus IIXL - Full keyboard retuning, 768/oct.<br>Proteus III World - Full keyboard retuning, 768/oct.<br>Proteus FX - Full keyboard retuning, 768/oct<br>Proteus Classic Keys - Full keyboard retuning, 768/oct.<br>Morpheus - Full keyboard retuning, 768/oct<br>Proformance, Proformance Plus - NOT RETUNABLE!<br>Emax, Emax II, ESi, Emulator II, Emulator III - NOT RETUNABLE!<br>No E-Mu samplers can be retuned without "tricking"<br>the operating system by detuning each note and <br>storing it as a separate sample, etc.  (At best the<br>results from detuning E-Mu and Yamaha and Akai<br>and Kawai samplers are poor and it gobbles RAM<br>like you wouldn't believe.)<br><br>KORG<br>T-1, T-2, T3 - Retunable only  within12 notes per octave<br>Wavestation - Retunable only within 12 notes per octave<br>O1/W, O1/W Pro - Retunable only 12 notes per octave<br>X20, X30, X50 - NOT RETUNABLE!<br>X5, i4, i4S - Retunable only within 12 notes per octave<br><br>KAWAI<br>None of this company's synths can be retuned in any<br>way, shape or form.<br><br>AKAI<br>None of this company's synths can be retuned in any<br>way, shape or form.<br><br>WALDORF<br>MicroWave - Full keyboard retuning, 768/oct.<br>Wave          - Full keyboard retuning, 768/oct.<br><br>PEAVEY<br>None of this company's synths can be retuned in<br>any way, shape or form.<br>------------------------------------------<br>MULTIPLE TUNING TABLES:<br><br>COMPANY SYNTH           # OF TUNING TABLES<br>Yamaha  TX802           8<br>Ensoniq VFX, TS-10      12<br>Ensoniq EPS, EPS-16+,<br>                ASR-10          8<br>Ensoniq ESQ1, ESQ-M,<br>                SQ-80           8 (only  within<br>                                12 notes per octave)<br>This means that the TX802 can support up to<br>8 different full-keyboard tunings at once;<br>likewise the VFX & TS-10 can support up to<br>12 different full-keyboard tunings at once, etc.<br>The ESQ-1, ESQ-M and SQ-80 are special cases.<br>These synths don't have tuning tables; you retune<br>by using the MOD operators in each voice to<br>modulate notes/octave.  It works, but it's<br>a godawful kludge.<br>One addendum to the above table: observant<br>readers will have noticed that the info for<br>Ensoniq samplers is not quite accurate.  Since<br>a tuning is stored with the layer to which a<br>sample is assigned, and since Ensoniq samplers<br>can use up to 8 different layers within each<br>channel, there is a theoretical maximum of<br>64 different tuning tables possible on an<br>Ensoniq EPS, EPS-16+, or ASR-10.  In practice<br>memory runs out long before the 64-layer<br>limit is reached, however.<br>-------------------------------------<br>Third (and last):<br>Here's a very quick overview:<br><br>ONLY 1 COMPANY MAKES A FULL-KEYBOARD<br>RETUNABLE SAMPLER: ENSONIQ<br>If you want to compose or perform using<br>a sampler in non-12, you have ONLY 3 CHOICES:<br>The ASR-10, a used EPS-16+ or a used EPS.  NO<br>OTHER SAMPLER ON THE PLANET HAS A<br>TUNING TABLE!<br><br>>>>>>> IMPORTANT!  IMPORTANT! <<<<<<<<br>The only synths recommended for<br>those who want to compose or perform<br>in non-12 are:<br><br>Yamaha DX7 w/E!, DX7II, TX802, TG-77,<br>TX81Z, FB-01, SY-77, SY-99, VL-1, VL-1M<br>Ensoniq  VFX, VFX-SQ, TS-10<br>Waldorf  MicroWave, Wave<br>E-MU   Proteus I, Proteus II, Proteus III,<br>        Morpheus, Classic Keys, Proteus FX,<br>          Ultraproteus<br><br>Time and time again, I've seen people<br>buy a synth *not* on this list.  Time and time<br>again, they get interested in microtonality...<br>and discover their synth is *locked into 12*,<br>or locked into only 12 notes out 19, or 12<br>notes out of 31, or 12 harmonic series pitches,<br>or 12 notes out of Harry Partch's 43...<br>The frustration and rage and hair-pulling<br>frenzy  this produces cannot be adequately<br>described.  It's unbelievably maddening to<br>discover that your shiny new $3000 synth<br>*CANNOT* produce the pitches you want to<br>hear.<br>So those interested in composition or performance<br>in non-12 would do well to choose wisely (as<br>the knight in "Indiana Jones and the Quest for<br>the Holy Grail" put it) and pick one of the<br>synths on the RECOMMENDED list.  Otherwise,<br>dollars to doughnuts, you are going to let<br>yourself in for a whole *world* of frustration.<br><br>IMPORTANT: IF YOU LIKE A PARTICULAR SYNTH<br>BUT ARE BUGGED THAT THE MANUFACTURER<br>DOESN'T OFFER RETUNABILITY, WRITE A LETTER<br>TO THE MANUFACTURER.
