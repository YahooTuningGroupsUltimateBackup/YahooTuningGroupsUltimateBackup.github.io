Perhaps<br>sharing my "hit" on this pursuit will stimulate a little discussion on<br>areas of alternative tunings which I find particularly fascinating.  I<br>began musical training with piano lessons at age 8 and 2 years later took<br>up the french horn in 5th grade band program which I pursued through<br>college and beyond a little, gaining enough proficiency to sub a couple<br>of times with the Pittsburgh Symphony, a summer with the Colorado<br>Philharmonic and the a season with the Albuqurque Symphony ('72-'73) and<br>the following year a season down in Mexico.  However I becam e discouraged<br>with the professional classical music scene with all of the politics, etc.<br>so I gave it up, gave my horn to my brother and went to work for Austin<br>Organ Co. in Hartford, CT.  I learned cabinetmaking from a couple of<br>German master cabinetmake rs, an art which seems virtually nonexistent in<br>this country, and after about 4 years went to work in a small organ shop<br>which specialized in restoring tracker organs; the owner was also German<br>trained.  He also had a tuning business and I ended up holdin g keys for<br>many hours.  At this time I did extensive reading on temperments on<br>historical instruments through organ periodicals, etc.  But the pressures<br>of raising a family forced me into the plastics manufacturing business in<br>which I have been engaged for the past 20 odd years.  Picked up the horn<br>again a few years ago and currently play with the Reno Philharmonic, opera<br>orch, ballet orch, etc. for the fun of musicmaking which it has become<br>again!  Now to the things of interest--<br><br>During college I ran across several fascinating passages in Gurdjieff's<br>writings--specifically in "Meetings with Remarkable Men", pub. E. P.<br>Dutton & Co., Triangle Edition (1974), pp. 128-133.  I'll quote several<br>passages (p 128) <br><br>"...Vitvitskaia finally replied that the cause of her state was, as she<br>expressed it, the 'damned music,' and she asked me if I remembered the<br>music of the night before last.  I did indeed remember how all of us,<br>sitting in some corner of the monastery, had almost sobbed, listening to<br>the monotonous music performed by the brethren during one of their<br>ceremonies.  And although we had talked about it afterwards for a long<br>time, none of us could explain the reason for it."  And later (p 132)<br>"...I later, on my return to Russia, resumed my experiments on people. I<br>found, as the brothers had advised, the absolute "la" according to the<br>atmospheric pressure of the place where the experiment was to be carried<br>out, and tuned the piano correspondingly, taking into consideration also<br>the dimensions of the room.  Besides this, I chose for the experiment<br>people who already had in themselves the repeated impressions of certain<br>chords; and I also took into consideration the character of the place and<br>the race of each on e present.  Yet I could not obtain identical results,<br>that is to say, I was not able by one and the same melody to evoke<br>identical experiences in everyone....But here, the day before yesterday,<br>this music almost without melody evoked the same state in all<br> of us--people not only of different race and nationality, but even quite<br>unlike in character, type, habits and temperment.  To explain this by the<br>feeling of human 'herdness' was out of the question..."  Also in<br>Gurdjieff's "Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson" there is a whole section,<br>pp 847-870, E. P. Dutton & Co. (1964) in which he outlines a sophisticated<br>scale of 7 tones/octave, 5 'half tones' and 14 'quarter tones' over a 7<br>octave range which represents in sound vibration what the 7 colors of the<br>sp ectrum represents to light.  This tuning system apparently offers<br>insight into cosmic law.  The reading is relatively difficult but it<br>spurred my imagination into realms of the possibility of music beyond mere<br>entertainment--I was a biochemistry and philosophy major in college at<br>the time. <br><br>A few years later I read another passage which also reinforced my<br>curiosity of alternative tunings and dissappointment with the direction<br>that 12TET music was taking.  This is a passage in The Urantia Book<br>(1955), Urantia Foundation, Chicago, IL.  "The best music of Urantia<br>(earth) is just a fleeting echo of the magnificent strains heard by the<br>celestial associates of your musicians, who left but snatches of these<br>harmonies of morontia forces on record as the musical melodies of sound<br>harmonics.  Spirit -morontia music not infrequently employs all seven<br>modes of expression and reproduction, so that the human mind is<br>tremendously handicapped in any attempt to reduce these melodies of the<br>higher spheres to mere notes of music sound.  Such an effort would b e<br>like endeavoring to reproduce the strains of a great orchestra by means of<br>a single musical instrument. <br><br>"....Be not discouraged; some day a real musician may appear on Urantia,<br>and whole peoples will be enthralled by the magnificent strains of his<br>melodies.  One such human being could forever change the course of a whole<br>nation, even the entire civilized wo rld.  It is literally true, 'melody<br>has power a whole world to transform.' Forever, music will remain the<br>universal language of men, angels, and spirits.  Harmony is the speech of<br>Havona."(p 500) <br><br>I suppose more than other writings, these passages have motivated my<br>thoughts and search for things metamusical.  My work in this area has been<br>only theoretical to date and I hesitate to share these thoughts without<br>some real music to illustrate the ideas .  I have recently acquired an old<br>EPS with which I hope to work with some of my experimental tunings, so<br>I'll keep you all posted.  The constraints of survival in this society and<br>raising a family of course have limited this pursuit, but it has been a pl<br>easure to listen in on others who also are expanding and extending our<br>musical spheres and I look forward to continued discussion and<br>experimentation.
