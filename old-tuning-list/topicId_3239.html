Experience says that the easiest one to tune was<br>probably the most common.   The Kirnberger III is very close to the the Prinz,<br>or Aron-Neidhardt, which, according to Jorgensen, was quite close to the<br>temperament of L'Alembert, published in 1752 in the "Elemens De Musique".   <br>     The Prinz combines the two longest lasting practises of keyboards in one<br>tuning.  i.e. the ancient Pythagorean fifths in the higher keys, and the pure<br>thirds and tempered fifths of the Pietro Aaron 1/4 comma meantone in the<br>simpler keys.  I personally love this tuning. It has three thirds at the top<br>that are 21.5 cents wide. <br>     The differences among the well temperaments, in practise, were possibly<br>less than we might recognize, as most tuning was done to achieve a goal of<br>progressively changing characters of the keys.  In this respect,  Valotti<br>probably was the ideal, though Thomas Young's alteration of Valotti's placed<br>the purest key at "C", instead of Valotti's "F".  This distinction is lost on<br>us today, but perhaps 18th century ears accustomed to the tonal palette,<br>would have gone dancing with pin-headed angels over the difference. <br>    Jorgensen does point out that there has never been any improvement in<br>temperament, as one facet is improved, ( say modulation),  another is lost, (<br>key contrast).  <br>     Whereas the Young offered a very predictable rise in the speed of the<br>thirds as one modulated around the circle of fifths, the Prinz offered more<br>pure keys, and greater contrast.  It is hard to say that one is better or<br>worse, and given that there was raging controversy over the various<br>temperaments of the time, it is also hard to say what was the most common<br>tuning. <br>Regards to all, <br>Ed Foote <br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn.</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Well Temperament</h1><h3><a id=7296 href="#7296">ðŸ”—</a>A440A &#x3C;A440A@aol.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/1998 2:21:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Joseph L Monzo writes:<br>>The following table is the adjustment from equal temperament (in cents)<br>>used by Johnny Reinhard for the Werckmeister III temperament used in last<br>>week's performance by the Soho Baroque Opera.  <br><br>C = +12<br>C#/Db = +2<br>D = +4<br>D#/Eb = +6<br>E = +2<br>F = +10<br>F#/Gb = 0 <br>G = +8<br>G#/Ab = +4<br>A = 0<br>Bb/A# = +8<br>B = +4<br>C = +12<br> <br>     This is essentially the temperament that Dr. Al Sanderson published for<br>his manual  and is labeled the Werckmeister III, Correct Temperament no. 1.   <br>      ( Al is the inventor of the Sanderson Accu-tuner{SAT}, which has been a<br>tremendous help in restoration of the temperaments for piano techs). <br>     Since the SAT has a resolution of .1 cent, Al's numbers are slightly more<br>specific, though I don't think the difference is audible,    I will list them<br>below. <br>C =    +11.7<br>C#=    +2.0<br>D  =    +3.9<br>D# =   +5.9<br>E   =   +2.0<br>F   =   +9.8<br>F# =    0.0<br>G   =  +7.8<br>G# =  +3.9<br>A   =    0.0<br>A# =  +7.8<br>B   =   +3.9<br><br>    As far as the most widely used temperament in the Baroque and Classical<br>era,  that is hard to say.
