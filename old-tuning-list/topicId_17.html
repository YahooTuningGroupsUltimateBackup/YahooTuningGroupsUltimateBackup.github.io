He attributes this to <br>Werckmeister's later works which explicitly describe equal temperament.  <br>Werckmeister wrote in his *Hypomnemata musica* of 1697 that:<br>	Who, however, asks for a temperament in which all consonant <br>	intervals are equal, must take care that all fifths beat 1/12th of a 	<br>	comma downward, so that all major thirds beat 2/3 of a comma and <br>	the minor third 3/4 of a comma... So far I have not been able to <br>	agree with this view, because I prefer to keep the diatonic notes <br>	which are used most often with the diatonic tonalities, as pure as <br>	possible in tuning.<br>   Werckmeister clearly does not fully support equal temperament at this <br>point in his life.  Yet in Werckmeister's *Harmonologie musica* of 1702, <br>Rasch has determined that there is "a direct pleading for equal <br>temperament, based on the possibilities of unlimited transportation and <br>enharmonic changes."  One problem with this interpretation is that all <br>circular keyboard tunings are, by definition, capable of unlimited <br>transposition and enharmonic changes.  In this sense, equal temperament <br>fits well within the larger category of well-tempered tunings.<br>   Werckmeister's last opus *Musicalische Paradoxal-Discourse* of 1707 <br>was published posthumously.  Based on Rasch's translated excerpts, it <br>would appear to the point of offering an apology "for his earlier <br>propaganda for unequal temperaments.<br>	Werckmeister's attitude at the end of his life is summarized in a <br>	book published posthumously (1707) where in effect he apologized <br>	for not having included equal temperament among the various <br>	circulating temperaments for which he had earlier published a <br>	monochord diagram.  (The incompetent engraver, he said, had <br>	complained about dividing the narrow space of a comma into 12 parts.)  <br>	He quite approved of equal temperament, yet was willing "to have the <br>	diatonic 3rds left somewhat purer than the other, less often used<br>	ones," a procedure for which he had expressed clear preference in his <br>	earlier writings.<br>   What can be deduced for certain is that Werckmeister wrote about equal <br>temperament usage with increasing frequency in his later years.
