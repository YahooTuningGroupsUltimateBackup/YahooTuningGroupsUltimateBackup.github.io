So we have the catch all message....<br><br>*******************************************************<br>With Paul Erlich<br>*******************************************************<br><br>>No, 0.6% means a frequency change of 0.6%. Basically Goldstein dealt<br>>with the way complex tone pitch (virtual pitch) was inferred from sets<br>>of pure tones which departed by various amounts from an exact harmonic<br>>series. His experimental results were very well fit by a model with only<br>>one parameter, sigma, which could vary from listener to listener.<br>>Essentially the model states that the listener will interpret the set of<br>>pure tones as a certain virtual pitch if the pure tones have an rms<br>>deviation less than sigma from a harmonic series above that virtual<br>>pitch. As the deviations are increased further, the ear shifts to a<br>>different, lower virtual pitch, whose harmonics better fit the pure<br>>>tones (this is a very rough description).<br><br>Okay.  The idea seems to make sense.  We're talking about 15 cents, on<br>average?<br><br>What isn't clear is just what the claim is as to what mistuning like this<br>does to interval perception.  Whatever it is, you seem to feel it's big<br>enough to cause problems in ET's over 35/oct.  And then there's the matter<br>of the thing being based on pure tones.  What about tones with partials?<br><br>>Here's what I've always said: "a" is preferable for describing the<br>>resources of a given system of Just Intonations, and "b" is preferable<br>>for describing the maximum interval complexity in simultaneities<br>>considered consonant in a given style. The latter is very tied up with<br>>an acoustical theory of interval perception.<br><br>Sorry if I mis-understod your standpoint.  Maybe we're closer to agreeing<br>on this than I thought.  I did not mean to mis-represent your ideas.<br><br>>>>"An arbitrary power of two produces an effect of equivalence." This must<br>>>>of course include the case where the power is zero, and the equivalence<br>>>>is greatest. The equivalence evidently falls off as the power increases.<br>>>><br>>>>But what about steely coldness? Is it there when the power is zero? Does<br>>>>a unison contain all potential interval qualities, to a greater degree<br>>>>than the intervals themselves? It would seem hard to argue that way.<br>>><br>>>If he's means what he says ("powers"), then his first paragraph is correct,<br>>>but his second is not, as "steely coldness" is an attribute of the factor<br>>>3, not the power 3.<br>>><br>>>If he means factors instead of "powers", then I suppose his whole thing is<br>>>correct.  Although I do not see why he insists on making the unison into<br>>>some kind of "white light", I am willing to oblige.  As far as factor<br>>>determines which partials line up, and all of the partials in a unison line<br>>>up, the analogy holds...<br>><br>>I'm not sure what it is in my wording that was problematic. Perhaps you<br>>could suggest an alternative wording for each of the interpretations you<br>>mention, and I could endorse one, allowing us to proceed?<br><br>Okay.  Gary, representing the prime-number advocates (of which, I will be<br>sure to add, he is not necessarily one), said that steely coldness was<br>often considered to be related to the FACTOR of 3.  You start out by saying<br>"an arbitrary power of 2 produces an effect of equivalence", and then<br>finish up asking if a power of 3 can produce steely coldness.  But it is a<br>factor of three that is supposed to produce steely coldness.<br><br>Any change in power (stacking the interval two, or however many times) is<br>supposed to produce equivalence, falling off as stacking brings the<br>compound interval close in size to an interval with different prime factors<br>(like you point out with the 81/64 vs. 5/4 example -- although, as I said,<br>I don't think the the 81/64 is close enough to the 5/4 to mask its 3-ness).<br><br>I hope this helps.<br><br>>>music has evolved by prime limit.  Pull out a CD of English tudor music, as<br>>>sung by the King's Singers, for example, and try to add the 7's.  You<br>>>won't.  They didn't, not for hundreds of years.  They've got ratios of 25<br>>>and everything else needed to modulate around the 5-limit, throwing commas<br>>>around like frisbees, but no 7's.  Barbershop's got 7's and 28's, and 63's<br>>>a-plenty.  And 9's, and 18's, and 27's.  But no 11's.  Never will you hear<br>>>an 11 used harmonically in Barbershop music.  And the first time you do,<br>>>you'll be hearing them again soon and often :~)<br>><br>>Again, the odd-limit definition applies not when considering all<br>>intervals present, but when considering which intervals can be<br>>considered consonant. In all your examples, the higher composites are<br>>dissonant.<br><br>This is a very good point, provided you allow a movable 1/1.  <br><br>However, I will note that, in my experience, I have often need caution when<br>considering attempts of music theory to say, "and in this period,<br>such-and-such was considered dissonant, etc..."  I gather that Mr. Erlich<br>is quite a fan of such approaches; he insists in his 22TET paper on<br>nitpicking that "a better definition would be that 5-limit intervals are<br>considered consonances in this music, and therefore need to be tuned with<br>some degree of accuracy" [quoting from memory].<br><br>My objection to this approach is basically that:<br><br>1. It seems to be an over-generalization.  Different composers use lots of<br>different things in lots of different ways, even in the same "period".<br><br>2. It has never, in my experience, proven useful in the composition of new<br>music.<br><br>Don't I use this idea when talking about music evolving by prime limit?<br>Not really.  Because you will NEVER hear a higher prime being used<br>harmonically in the earlier style.  It's not a question of what they<br>considered it because they *didn't* consider it.<br><br>But I may yet be swayed, if only it can be demonstrated that odd limit is<br>really needed to describe a real phenomenon in the way intervals are<br>treated in music.<br><br>>>The reason, I suspect, that Paul Erlich fights for odd limits: He is a man<br>>>of equal temperaments :~)<br>><br>>Equal temperaments or not, that has nothing to do with this issue.<br><br>I'm going to catch you yet Erlich, biasing your science to support equal<br>temperaments!<br><br>>>The idea that 9's do not become harmonically significan't until we have<br>7's >>does not hold in my experience.  Try playing just 4-5-6-8-9 chords<br>and see >>if the 9 doesn't serve the same purpose as it does in a<br>4-5-6-7-8-9 chord.<br>><br>>That is not at all a valid interpretaion of anything I've tried to say.<br><br>Shit.<br><br>*************************************************************<br>With Joseph L. Monzo [ Hello! :~) ]<br>*************************************************************<br><br>>As I stated in a recent posting, La Monte Young's<br>>"Well-Tuned Piano" is a 5-hour-long JI piece using<br>>intervals with factors of only 3 and 7 -- no 5's.<br><br>An intentional effort by a composer using a fixed-pitch instrument.<br>Covered in my post.<br><br>>When I hear composite odd identites, like 9, 15, 21,<br>>etc., in quickly-moving real music, I don't get any<br>>particular sense of their particular odd-integer<br>>quality, but I  _do_  hear the qualities of the prime<br>>factors.  Under different conditions, such as<br>>listening to experiments at home, the qualities of<br>>individual odd identities can be isolated.<br><br>Sort of like you could tell what prime limit music on a 33 is, playing at<br>45 rpms, but not what odd limit the same music was without hearing it at<br>actual speed?<br><br>>3-limit music can be written in which 9 and 27, and probably<br>>even 81, have harmonic significance.  27 and<br>>especially 81 sound pretty dissonant, but that<br>>doesn't mean they can't be used as chord<br>>members. ( Who wants chords that are always<br>>consonant?)<br><br>I agree, and will go one further.  I believe the 81/64 can be treated as a<br>consonance.  I believe anything can (and has been) treated as a consonance<br>(and I am not talking about serialsim, where consonance is not an issue).<br>The 12-tone 5/4 is treated as a consonance.  I wonder what Mr. Erlich<br>thinks about this, since it very close both in size and derrivation to the<br>81/64.  He doesn't seem to have a problem considering a 7 cent sharp 3/2<br>consonant! <br>This 3/2, to my ear, makes the triads of 22 no better than those of 12,<br>despite the better third.<br><br>>This variety is exactly what makes JI so<br>>compositionally useful.  One of the reasons why<br>>working in JI is so wonderful is because there<br>>are so many different ways to combine the<br>>prime qualities and compare identities which are<br>>very close in frequency but have different prime<br>>factors (for example, chord tones an 81/80 apart).<br><br>I've always viewed these "commas" as making modulation more interesting.<br>But many disagree.  Partch's chapter in Genesis of a Music is really great<br>about this point (the one with the letter from Fox-Strangeways).  Boy that<br>chapter is really a thrill!<br><br>Basically, what I got from this chapter is that modulation is best defined<br>simply as switching the 1/1, and that common tones, while playing, of all<br>things, perhaps the most important role in the use of modulation, are not<br>necessary in its definition or execution.  And perhaps, that a theory of<br>modulation may be constructed where tones separated by a comma can still be<br>considered "common"!<br><br>>As I've stated many times before, I believe we<br>>_do_  perform prime factorization on music<br>>_as we listen_.  Perhaps this is so because<br>>it is the fastest way to understand the harmonic<br>>relationships occuring in the music as it flies<br>>past our ears in real time.  I will argue that<br>>harmonic relationships are _always_  implied,<br>>whether implied well or badly.<br><br>I agree.  And while the scalpal cuts into some dead guy's ear, I will ask:<br><br>Even if the "association of certain intervals with the tuning systems in<br>which they occur" (that is, I asume, some sort of cultural conditioning) is<br>the only way we can pick prime factors apart from odd ones in music, are we<br>not still performing a prime factorization on what we hear?<br><br>*****************************************************************<br>With Eduardo Sabat-Garibald<br>*****************************************************************<br><br>>A friend of mine asked for an orchestration book written in the last 20<br>>years.<br><br>I will also recommend Adler's book, which was recommened by Paul Hahn.
