Great reply, Patrick!<br><br>In fact, Schoenberg intended to represent loads and<br>loads of ratios, and to explore the ambiguities between<br>them which he felt he had available by making use of<br>the approximations to ratios in the 12-eq scale.<br> <br>[Schoenberg, from "Problems of Harmony" [1934], in<br>_Style and Idea_, p. 284:]<br>> "...interrelationship of all tones exists...because of<br>> their derivation from the first 13 overtones of the<br>> three fundamental tones [1/1, 3/2, and 4/3]..."<br><br>[Monzo:]<br>Schoenberg had already illustrated a partially-chromatic<br>scale which implied overtones thru the first 12 (i.e., an<br>11-limit) back in 1911 in _Harmonielehre_.<br><br>[Schoenberg,  _Theory of Harmony_ [1911], p. 21:]<br>> "...the tempered system [meaning 12-eq], which is only<br>> an expedient for overcoming the difficulties of the material,<br>> has indeed only a limited similarity to nature.  This is perhaps<br>> an advantage, but hardly a mark of superiority."<br><br>[Monzo:]<br>Throughout his _Harmonielehre_, Schoenberg postulates<br>an extreme fluidity of proportional implication in the 12-eq<br>scale, explaining all the traditional harmonic concepts in<br>terms of 5-limit, then progressing to higher odds/ primes<br>(but without further mathematical explanation) as his<br>interpretations of harmonic practice became more<br>adventurous in the chapters on "Non-Harmonic" Tones,<br>the Whole-Tone Scale, Chords Constructed in 4ths, and<br>finally Chords With Six or More Tones.<br><br>By "difficulties of the material", Schoenberg was<br>referring to the difficulty of accomodating the vastly<br>expanded pitch resources offered by an 11- or<br>13-limit to the practical concerns of scale size,<br>hand/ finger size and other instrumental limitations,<br>notation, etc.<br><br>The 12-eq scale is the smallest ET which gives even<br>an adequate approximation of 3-limit ratios, and  6-eq<br>and 9-eq give the same deviation from 5-limit ratios<br>as 12-eq, so 12-eq is the smallest ET that gives tolerably<br>good approximations to the ratios which are implied<br>in the (theoretically 5-limit) musical repertoire<br>Schoenberg knew. <br><br>Without using any numbers (these are my interpretation),<br>he stated in one of his articles that the music being<br>composed by he and his pupils was intended to make<br>use of the rational harmonic relations which were as yet<br>unfamiliar to listeners, that is, ratios with prime factors<br>higher than 5.  He said that those in his circle were<br>focussing specifically on these new relations and<br>avoiding the old ones:<br><br>[Schoenberg,  "Twelve-Tone Composition" [1923], in<br>_Style and Idea_, p. 207:]<br>> "In twelve-tone composition consonances (major and<br>> minor triads) and also the simpler dissonances (diminished<br>> triads and seventh chords) -- in fact almost everything<br>> that used to make up the ebb and flow of harmony --<br>> are, as far as possible, avoided."<br><br>[Monzo:]<br>He then immediately defended this statement:<br><br>[Schoenberg, same page:]<br>> "...this is not becasue of any natural law of the new art.<br>>  It is, presumably, just one manifestation of a reaction,<br>> one that does not have its own special causes but derives<br>> from another manifestation -- which it tries to contradict,<br>> and whose laws are therefore the same, basically, as its<br>> own."<br><br>[Monzo:]<br>I believe what Schoenberg meant here was that the<br>higher-prime or higher-odd relationships follow the same<br>compositional procedures as the lower numbers, but<br>that _because they are different_, try to "contradict"<br>the tonal implications of the lower primes/ odds.<br><br>In other words, for example, the septimal "major 3rd"<br>of 9/7 embodies vastly different _harmonic_  relationships<br>than the 5-limit "major 3rd" of 5/4.<br><br>He then explains this "manifestation of a reaction":<br><br>[Schoenberg, same page:]<br>> "...At the root of all this is the unconscious urge to<br>> try out the new resources independently, to wrest<br>> from them possibilities of constructing forms, to produce<br>> with them alone all the effects of a clear style, of a<br>> compact, lucid and comprehensive presentation of<br>> the musical idea.  To use here the old resources in<br>> the old sense saves trouble -- the trouble of cultivating<br>> the new -- but also means passing up the chance of<br>> enjoying whatever can *only* be attained by new<br>> resources when the old ones are excluded!"<br><br>[Monzo:]<br>Taking this literally says to me that he  _should_  have<br>been willing to consider other ETs which represent<br>these higher-prime ratios better than 12-eq, even if<br>their approximations of 3 and 5 aren't good.  11-eq<br>gives a decent approximation of 7/4 and and a good<br>one of 11/8, with nothing resembling a 3/2 or a 5/4.<br>13-eq gives an even better approximation of 11/8,<br>and one of 13/8 which is quite good, with an OK 5/4<br>but lousy 3/2 and even worse 7/4.  So both of these<br>small ETs (which Ozzard-Low probably picked pretty<br>arbitrarily from the possibilities available) would have<br>been a good choice for Schoenberg if his practice<br>was true to the letter of his description.<br><br>He went on to say that "a later time will perhaps"<br>allow composers a harmonic language which would<br>mix the old 3- and 5-limit relationships with the newer<br>ones of 7, 9, and 11. (I'm not certain if Schoenberg had as<br>yet included 13 in his rational implications -- there's no<br>evidence of this until 1934).<br><br>However, Schoenberg was a complicated man whose<br>writings and compositions frequently embody paradoxes.<br>He stipulated many times that he was "evolutionary,<br>not revolutionary" -- in other words, that his musical<br>advances were not a break with the past, but on the<br>contrary, the logical outgrowth of what had come<br>before (in the Austro-German tradition).  It's been pointed<br>out by many writers that Schoenberg's actual music<br>retained far more of Brahms's influence than that of<br>his "more radical" pupil Webern (although I disagree with<br>the assessment of Webern as such a radical).<br><br>Schoenberg was clearly interested in expansion,<br>not replacement.  This would seem to argue in favor<br>of his retention of 12-eq, as he certainly did not want<br>to eliminate completely the 3- and 5-limit rational implications<br>which were so important to so-called "tonal" music, and<br>which would have happened had he accepted 11- or<br>13-eq.  A favorite quote from his old age is "there is still<br>plenty of good music to be written in C major".<br><br>Also worth examing is Schoenberg's self-appellation<br>"pantonal", which he coined in angry opposition  to<br> the popularly-accepted epithet "atonal".  His<br>argument was that since any sounds giving<br>recognizable pitches exhibited numerical<br>relationships, some kind of tonality (defined as a<br>mathematical centricity around a certain tone) was<br>automatically built in to any collection of pitches.  He<br>preferred to think of his style as making use of all<br>tonalities at once, rather than as making use of no<br>tonality at all.<br><br>   Joseph L.
