Last time out, I meandered a bit trying to<br>describe what those horrible academic sorts with whom I consort<br>might actually tell you about the canon and where it came from and<br>how it changes if you asked them. The fact that the first part was<br>a bit qualified and meanderish is *itself* the result of the critiques<br>of the notion of canonicity which began in earnest back in the late<br>1960s and continues to the present day. What follows here is a<br>much briefer description of what someone in canon studies might<br>describe to you as the ways that outsiders (and insiders as well)<br>have sought to modify this social construct of a "canon thang." This<br>list is, I hope, constructed so that it can be applied to a canon of<br>any sort [music, literature, art] with roughly similar results. It<br>got roughed out during a dinner or two with my beloved [who is,<br>*horrors*, an academic - although a very nice one who does Dutch<br>literature and has who has done nothing to keep you lot out of the<br>concert halls :-) ], and run past some musicologist pals over coffee.<br><br>Here goes:<br><br>1. Inserting outsiders into the canon [sometimes called "opening<br>the canon"]<br><br>In most cases, the addition of others [outsiders or the marginalized]<br>into the existing canon proceeds by arguing that a given composer<br>or writer meets the standards which are generally applied to those<br>already present and represented, and that the included person's<br>work contributes something  important to an understanding of the<br>existing canon and the historical situation that it us understood to privilege.<br><br>For those critical of this approach, the big drawback of this strategy<br>is  the suggestion that it's involved in tokenization - would adding<br>a handful of xenharmonic composers (as an example) really "solve"<br>the problem of what might be seen as a vastly unequal representation<br>of 12TET composers in the canon?<br><br>My beloved reminded me over dinner that the mid-seventies<br>edition of the Norton Anthology claimed that the literature by and<br>about women was added to in a major way, when in reality the '74<br>edition had raised the number of women out of 80 or 90 to....8.<br><br>The other problem is that one could also argue that "opening the<br>canon" still, in effect, judges those added by means which still<br>favor the existing body of work. I'm personally less convinced<br>by this argument,  since it seems to me that real cultural change<br>of the "hearts and minds" sort does happen in precisely that<br>way - incremental change, one person by small steps, one at a time.<br>Thus, I'm inclined to believe it's an exaggeration to claim that<br>gradual shifts of the sort described by "opening the canon" necessarily<br>admit *only* those works which play the established melody - to me,<br>it suggests that the evaluative criteria are too simple. Your mileage<br>may vary on this point.<br><br>2. Assembling a counter-canon.<br><br>In a sense, this one's a pretty easy one to imagine. We simply<br>gather the worthy together - Fokker, Partch, Reinhard, Blackwood,<br>et. al. No tokenism here - it's all *us.* No pesky problems with<br>the nagging doubts associated with that whiff of compromise<br>and negotiation associated with supplementation of another canon<br>elsewhere.<br><br>There's also an easy literary example: the sorta recent "The Norton<br>Anthology of Literature by Women: The Tradition in English"<br>from the mid-80s. It looks  just like the other Nortons, but it's a<br>no-dangler zone, made up solely of women writers and thus no<br>offered as an "alternative" to the "real" canonical text.  But critics<br>of this particular approach point out that this is really  nothing more<br>than the original "supplementation" problem in big, screaming neon<br>capital letters. However much it may be praised by the true believers<br>who poured their hearts and sould into the counter-canon's formation,<br>the "separate but equal" status looks remarkably like a kind of ghettoization.<br>For one thing, it seems like it lets the existing "canons" off the hook<br>by, in effect, refusing to engage them in a substantive way in terms<br>of asking what makes the "standards" standard in the first place.<br><br>But what I guess I find a trifle more troubling is that the creation<br>of this walled-off set of accepted and acceptable music is itself<br>just another bit of exclusionism [albeit one that we might be more<br>positively disposed toward], and we've still not really engaged<br>with what the bases of canonization "are." Why decides, who<br>benefits, etc. - one has merely replaced one potentially repressive<br>orthodoxy with another.<br><br>3. Subversion - alternative approaches to canonical works.<br><br>This one's a little more complicated to apply to music, but a real<br>no-brainer in the litcrit world, since it's the way that what would<br>become the full-blown feminist critique of the notion of a literary<br>canon began [Kate Millett in the late 60s/early 70s]. Essentially,<br>it enters into and engages what's present from outside by pointing<br>out that while the canon may claim some universality for itself<br>[and this is a bit tricky to argue with anything but the most clumsy<br>stereotypes of the canon as I think its currently constituted], it<br>defines said universality *specifically* in terms of a given agenda.<br>By foregrounding this agenda, one argues that those who encounter<br>the canonical works must actively learn to resist the identification<br>of value with said agenda.<br><br>This particular approach certainly has proved to be a powerful<br>line of approach for kinds of ideological viewpoints, but it seems<br>to me that there are some problems with using it as an exclusivist<br>approach. The obvious idea is that, like the counter-canon, it<br>doesn't address the omission of a give set of works from what's<br>currently considered to *be* the canon. One is left with the side<br>effect that such an exclusion may  still suggest that non-canonical<br>composers didn't write many works or that the work they *did*<br>produce wasn't as good as what's in the canon.<br><br>And that's pretty much it. I hope you can recognize yourself<br>making an argument for a wider hearing of non12TET work<br>in at least one of these positions, and maybe in all three of them.<br><br>There are some other things which we could still be talking<br>about but didn't seem to readily fit what I had in mind - looking<br>at how the repertoire of "canonical" works is formed [which<br>can vary within a specific kind of music. My friend Roger the<br>opera buff tells me that the formation of the 19th century<br>opera is interesting because it changes from a kind of "replacement"<br>set of pieces to an "accretion" of works, around the middle of the<br>century. Verdi seems to have something to do with this], for example.<br>I find myself wondering if we might wonder about the way that<br>a xenharmonic "counter-canon" might be in the midst of change<br>itself, since the number of available works is growing [which is<br>what kicked off the replacement/accretion switch in Joe Green's<br>day], but perhaps that's for another time.<br><br>Also, I hope it's not too much of a shock to discover that those<br>horrible academic ranks may already contain folks whose views<br>and general approaches to the shortcomings and failures of the present<br>set of agreements we call a canon might be in sync with some of<br>your own. They might in some cases be folks you could work with<br>and find some common ground. I hope so - if questions of musical<br>value are too important to be left to academics [which is as charitable<br>a reading of Brian's less nuanced screeds as I can manage], it's also<br>too important to be left to Brian.
