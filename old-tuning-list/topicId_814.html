As usually defined, it has six <br>consonant triads: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am. These triads are in fact consonant <br>when 12-, 19-, 31-tET, or meantone temperament is used to tune the scale. <br>In all of these cases, G B D F will be dissonant, and in meantone or <br>31-tET, a closer approximation to a 4:5:6:7 chord built on G can be found <br>than that which arises from the diatonic scale. That chord is notatod G B <br>D E#. However, this chord will not sound correct in C major, despite its <br>acoustical purity:<br>> the note "F" is expected, and an out-of-tune version is put in its place. In addition, the "clash" in G B D F is essential to the feeling <br>that it needs to resolve to the tonic chord, C E G.<br><br>Paul, I think your elaboration is sufficient(g). I'm a barbershopper and <br>we don't tune with any *.tet scale that I'm aware of. We tune by ear to <br>achieve max consonance. I'm assuming that we tune 4:5:6:7 regardless of <br>the the Key note. The G-B-D-E#(F) chrd(sol-ti-re-fa) is one of the basic <br>chrds which define the style in it's return to C-E-G(do-mi-sol) via the <br>circle of 5ths. But you must at least go to D-F#-A-C(re-fi-la-do) and <br>return thru G-B-D-F to C-E-G  to define a simple bbshop progression. What <br>you call a "clash" is just returning home via the circle of 5ths and is <br>the essence of the bbshop style.
