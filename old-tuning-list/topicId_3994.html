Zazeela's light<br>sculptures have invariably, teasingly refused<br>to surrender their entire secret to photographic<br>reprodution, so much do they depend on<br>the retinal impact of activated photons in real<br>time and so much do they exploit, in ways analagous<br>to Young's techniques, the creation of visual<br>combination tones and an accumulation of after-images."<br><br>-- Sandy McCroskey, 1/1, The Journal of the Just Intonation Network<br><br>"Young's newest sine-tone sculpture shimmers and<br>swirls as you walk around the room and, amazingly,<br>when you freeze, it does too.
