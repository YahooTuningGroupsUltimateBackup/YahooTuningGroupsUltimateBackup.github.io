All the other pitches are exact multiples of 64Hz.<br>> <br>> All even top numbers are doublings of odd numbers that appeared <br>> previously in the series. It amounts to five octaves. The first octave <br>> has one pitch: 1/1. Each successive octave has twice as many pitches as <br>> the one below it. <br>> 	This scale can be used both melodically (almost diatonic but a <br>> little stranger) and harmonically (all pitches blend well with each other <br>> because they are all harmonics of 1/1).<br>> 	I first discovered it in 1974, while sweeping a resonant filter <br>> over a sawtooth wave. I discovered it again in 1978 while trying to make <br>> a flute and accidentally inventing the Fipple Pipe.<br>> 	Since then I have learned of a few others that also use it including Jules <br>> Seigle, Robert Dick and Johnny Reinhart. Lou harrison uses the same basic <br>> scale exept that he uses subsets of the duple between 12 and 24 in an <br>> octave repeating scale (at least that is what he once told me).<br>> 	This scale is a rich resource for discovering new melodies and <br>> harmonies that are resonant and powerful as well as restfull and peace <br>> producing. It all depends on how they are used.<br>> 	My New College thesis was devoted to an exposition of the <br>> resources and uses of this scale (THE NATURAL HARMONIC SERIES AS A <br>> PRACTICAL APPROACH TO JUST INTONATION, Denny Genovese 1991. Available <br>> from the Southeast Just Intonation Center for $20)<br>> <br>> 	In more recent times, I have been experimenting (and composing!) with<br>> the inverse of this scale, the Subharmonic Series. This series begins <br>> with a very high pitch (2048Hz.) and proceeds DOWNWARD by subdivisions:<br>> <br>> 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1<br>> - - - - - - - - - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --<br>> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28<br>> <br>> etc.<br>> <br>> This scale is very different in sound from the first one. All the <br>> individual intervals of the harmonic series are there, but in reverse <br>> order. This makes chord construction more tricky because of the high<br>> possibility of dissonance. Again, though it is rich for both new melodies <br>> and harmonies. You just have to be more careful with it. Also, in the <br>> subharmonic series it is <br>> helpfull to think of the octaves being between multiples of 3, rather <br>> than 2 (other modes are possible in both scales, and these greatly modify <br>> the character of the scales).<br>> <br>> 	I have found it practical to work gradually from the basic <br>> materials of the harmonic series and the subharmonic series in order <br>> to thoroughly learn their characteristics. Now that this has been <br>> accomplished, my current work is concerned with a matrix-like web of both <br>> types of scales in which each member of the subharmonic series serves as <br>> a fundamental for a new harmonic series. At the same time, each member of <br>> the harmonic series serves as a fundamental for a new subharmonic series.<br>> This is similar to Harry Partch's tonality diamond, and is equivalent to <br>> his Primary Tonalities, exept that I am using the series themselves (and <br>> subsets in various modes) as scales, rather than as resources for a <br>> composite linear scale. Also I am using much higher primes than the 11 <br>> limit that Partch was satisfied with. My reasons for all this are <br>> outlined in my thesis.<br>> <br><br>Best wishes,<br><br><br>Denny Genovese<br><br>sejic@freenet.ufl.edu<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 10 Nov 1995 20:57 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id KAA08782; Fri, 10 Nov 1995 10:56:58 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 10 Nov 1995 10:56:58 -0800<br>Message-Id:  <9511101055.aa05266@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2300 href="#2300">ðŸ”—</a>Alloen Strange &#x3C;STRANGE@sjsuvm1.sjsu.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>11/10/1995 5:15:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Fri, 10 Nov 1995 13:35:59 -0800 John H.
