Material of the classes includes music from the renas-<br>saince to the 20th century. Folksongs of many nations serve as basis. Public<br>educational concerts form an integral part of the BBCM, whose patrons are Sir<br>Georg Solti, Sir Charles Mackerras, Norman Bailey CBE, Daniel Barenboim, Radu<br>Lupu, Professor Reinhard Strohm and Andras Keller. The BBCM presents its next<br>public educational concert at 4.p.m, Sunday, 16 March in The Steiner Theatre,<br>35 Park Road, London NW1 6 XT. Apart from its regular classes, the BBCM orga-<br>nises occasional intensive courses. This year we offer two options: 24-27 July<br>in London and 20-27 August in Budapest. Both courses will include material <br>from regular BBCM classes as well as special presentations on such topics as<br>various tuning systems, various teaching systems and Bartok^s connection to<br>ethnic music. Practical music making will form an important part. Tuition fees<br>are 200 pound sterling (London) and 300 pound sterling (Budapest) respectively.<br>Both courses are credit bearing for the Trinity College of Music Certificate<br>and Diploma of Music Education. Application (with a deposit of 50 pounds ster-<br>ling) is due by 15 May,.
