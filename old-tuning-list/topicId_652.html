As I start this<br>third installment (not counting side-trips and rebuttals), it is my hope that all of <br>you recognize both light-hearted tone and serious content; that you can, all by <br>yourselves, distinguish between the two; and that neither diminishes it's companion.  <br>It's so *hard* to be clear with just 1's and 0's.  Back to our story...<br><br>**********<br><br>> Why *not* rearrange Harry's music for other instruments?  In particular, <br>> certain members of the British Harry Partch Society have been up in <br>> arms about the recent Kronos Quartet arrangement of Partch's "Barstow" <br>> intoned by Ben Johnston.  This is just incomprehensible to me.<br><br>Brian McLaren isn't the only one who's comprehensionally-challenged.  In the two <br>previous posts I have dealt with the general issue of arranging Partch's works for <br>instruments other than those of his own devising.  The matter of the Ben Johnston <br>"Barstow" arrangement for string quartet and voice is another, *much* more serious <br>matter.<br><br>> If *these* arrangements of Partch's music weren't a problem, why <br>> should the Kronos Quartet's arrangement be a big deal?  The other issue <br>> here is that if we demand that *all* performances of Partch's music be<br>> done *only* on original Partch instruments, then that's going to limit <br>> the performances of Partch's music to just about nothing.  I mean, <br>> c'mon, people!  Dean Drummond adn Danlee Mitchell are the only two people<br>> on the planet who have Partch's instruments in their possession.  So <br>> that means that only two (count 'em, 2) people on the planet can give <br>> concerts of Partch's music if we insist on absolute fanatical <br>> authenticity and *never* allow Partch's music to be arranged for other <br>> instruments.<br><br>There have probably been many quiet, backdoor versions of Partch's works, in effect <br>'trees falling in empty woods'.  As they don't reach the light of day (read: a large <br>audience), it doesn't make sense to rail against them, though as a practice it should <br>not be condoned.  For individuals to study the music, hopefully in furtherance of their <br>*own* creative voice, OK.  But when a very high profile group such as Kronos presents <br>the work, the significance is at least an order of magnitude greater.  I have respected <br>Kronos in the past for honoring composers with their performances and expanding (and <br>improving) the music world with their commissions.  What to think, then, when this very <br>group chooses to actively go against the stated wishes of the very composer they seek <br>to embrace?  If you do not believe that Partch's writings themselves document *clearly* <br>his disdain for this type of a setting, then know that Partch was spoken for by both <br>Danlee Mitchell and Dean Drummond, expressing their dismay and displeasure at the <br>ensuing abomination.<br><br>I first realized this was happening last fall, when I saw the piece listed on a program <br>Kronos was doing in L.A.  This is when Danlee drafted his statement, dated October 12, <br>1995; he had tried repeatedly to contact their office prior to the concert.  I <br>delivered to David Harrington both documents and a tape of Harry, which contained <br>excerpts from his spoken commentaries that pertained directly to the misappropriation <br>of his musical works.  Best part of the evening was that they didn't even *do* <br>"Barstow", substituting the "Greek Studies" as Ben couldn't join them (as David told <br>Betty Freeman backstage).  After a 4.5-hour commute to Hell-A, I still had to wait <br>until a couple of weeks ago to hear for myself (the CD) their 'version'.<br><br>Wrong, wrong, wrong.  Let me try once again: like it or not, for better or for worse, <br>Harry Partch is the sum of his parts.  Give us one part and you are not working in his <br>interest, or the interest of his works; you are treating Partch as grist for the mill, <br>just another damn composer to load in the hopper.  It is eminently understandable, <br>though undeniably frustrating, to see so many people unable to cope with Partch ON HIS <br>TERMS.  Yes, this does restrict access to the music.  Yes, it does require those who <br>would seek to do justice to his work to shed their specializations: for those same <br>musician's to dance, act, sing, move.  Yes, this does mean that the vast sea of <br>humanity won't experience Harry Partch.  How's that for living in the real world?<br><br>A strange aspect of this saga is Ben Johnston himself; listen to what he wrote of Harry <br>in 1974:<br><br>    "Harry Partch created not only musical compositions but also the instruments for <br>    which they were written, the scale to which those are tuned, the theory behind the <br>    design of both music and instruments, and the very circumstances for making music, <br>    which he believed should not have an existence independent of poetry, drama, dance, <br>    sculpture.  This is an essential aspect of corporeal art.  In a fully realized <br>    Partch production there are spoken words wedded to music without the abstraction <br>    typical of singing; there is a dramatic story expressed though action in a theater <br>    space not excluding visible actions of performing musicians as well as those of <br>    dancer-actor-singers; there is a setting which significantly includes, as <br>    sculptural objects, the hand-made instruments themselves.  Music functions as part <br>    of a many-faceted art-work."<br>    <br>    - Dictionary of 20th Century Music, New York: Dutton, 1974.<br><br>So.  Now *I* am comprehensionally-challenged.  Has Ben changed his thoughts?  Do his <br>desire to present the works (understandable) finally outweigh respect for the wishes of <br>the author-composer-creator (not understandable)?  I direct those of you interested to <br>his article "The Corporealism Of Harry Partch" (Perspectives of New Music, XIII/2, <br>1975); from my reading, it is clear that Ben both understood Harry's intent, and the <br>*seriousness* of that intent.  Ben may have started to see his own path back then, as <br>he intimates, but his understanding of Harry's bone-deep convictions seems unequivocal.<br><br>> In particular, I see no problem at all with the idea of using <br>> synthesizers for some of Partch's music--as long as the synthesizers <br>> produce creditable imitations of Partch's instrumental timbres, and as <br>> long as the synths are tuned to Partch's scale, and as long as the parts <br>> are played correctly.  To insist that *only* instruments produced by <br>> Partch himself be used in performances would be to lock Partch's music <br>> away from the public.<br><br>Well, did you see Harry loaning out his instruments while he was alive?  Or publishing <br>plans in "Popular Mechanics", so that there could be lots of little Partch Ensembles <br>everywhere?  No, when he was here it was his ball-o-wax, and he allowed control of it <br>to others only as he saw fit.  I tell you, ladies and gentleman, there isn't a month <br>that goes by that I don't want to jump on a plane and go back to playing with the <br>group; this feeling is *not* lessened by my good fortune to have done it before -- it <br>makes it doubly difficult.  But I am not placating myself with 'mock' versions, or <br>crying in my beer.  Harry Partch was not, and is not, a mass-market commodity.  Even he <br>only begrudgingly accepted recordings as a means of dissemination.  To those that would <br>cobble together a program of 'Partch-lite' transcriptions, your disregard for Partch's <br>entire reason for creating serves as prelude, commentary and postlude your performance.<br><br>Oh, yes.  Someone please put in front of me a percussion controller capable of <br>withstanding the brutal pounding absolutely *crucial* to the dramatically charged <br>Marimba Eroica part at the conclusion of "The Bewitched".  I thought so.....<br><br>> In my judgment, it's infinitely better for *lots* of people to hear <br>> synth versions of Partch's music, or string quartet versions of his music, <br>> or a zoomoozaphone-and-flute version of Partch's music, than for only a <br>> tiny few people who live in upstate New York to hear the Absolutely <br>> Authentic Real Thing.  Ideally, of course, there would be many copies of<br>> Partch's instruments, plenty of Partch-trained instrumentalists, and so <br>> on.  <br><br>This is Brian's judgment call.  Anybody here care to venture a guess as to what Mr. <br>Partch's response might be?  Oh, I forgot: he's dead now.<br><br>> But we live in the real world.  Given real-world constraints, isn't <br>> it better to hear *more* of Partch's music in *more* venues, than less?<br><br>Yes, we do.<br>No, it isn't, not under those circumstances.  Not by a long shot.<br><br>**********<br><br>Arghhh...  Your eyes are glazing over, and my fingers are tired.  I have pretty well <br>finished, except for some closing thoughts, a summation, and flotsam and jetsam.
