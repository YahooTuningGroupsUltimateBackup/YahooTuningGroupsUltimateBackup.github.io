But the actual sound <br>of the music, in a sense, is familiar to anyone who has <br>heard a blues singer bend a phrase. <br><br>Here's a go at explaining the concept: In Western music, <br>the standard octave has been somewhat arbitrarily divided <br>into 12 pitches. Obviously, there are pitches in between, <br>say, G and G sharp, as any slide guitarist makes clear. <br>These pitches can be called microtones, and by using adept <br>performers or instruments with special tunings, composers <br>can write music that pinpoints these microtonal pitches. <br><br>Confused? The American Festival of Microtonal Music came <br>to the rescue with its annual two-day festival, which <br>opened on Thursday night at St. Paul's Chapel of Columbia <br>University. <br><br>Lou Harrison's tender Suite No. 2 for microtonal guitars, <br>skillfully played by John Schneider, made you forget all <br>about the concept and listen to the music. Its mixture of <br>the Spanish-inflected dances and elegies with the slightly <br>"off" quality of the pungent microtonal harmonies, echoing <br>in the reverberant chapel, was a delight. <br><br>The other intriguing work was "Atom Turning in the Sun of <br>Eternity," a dramatic cantata, of sorts, by Sasha Bogdanowitsch <br>for vocalist-actor (the composer in bare feet and white robe) <br>and instruments either played or tuned microtonally, <br>including harps, guitars, marimba, flute and cello. The <br>vocal text of made-up syllables, which sounded like some <br>primal earthy language, tells a vague fable of searching <br>for a beloved. Mr. Bogdanowitsch sang the melismatic vocal <br>line with chantlike elegance. The pleasant, quietly undulant <br>music is awash with Pacific Rim exotica, but it had a kind <br>of winning authenticity. <br><br>Virgil Moorefield's "(Slight Return)" was anything but <br>quiet, a work of blasts and bursts for electronic instruments. <br><br>A microtonal version for viola, guitar and cello of Avro <br>Pï¿½rt's modal, moody "Frates" proved ineffective. The repetitive <br>minimalistic figures for viola, as played by Anatasia Solberg, <br>just sounded raw and out of tune. Ms. Solberg was quite <br>effective in "Din Cinpoiu," a long work for solo viola by <br>Violeta Dinescu, but the music was a nondescriptive series <br>of scrapings, noodlings and nothings. <br><br>The longest work was "Adam and Eve," by Johnny Reinhard, a <br>caterwauling, self-indulgent musical drama depicting the <br>story from Genesis of the fall from grace, with a dancer <br>(Christina Coppola) as Eve; the composer, on bassoon, as <br>Adam; a cellist (David Eggar) as the Tree of Knowledge, and <br>a roster of other good sports on gongs, drums, guitars and <br>whatnot. The use of microtones did not turn this silly piece into <br>something innovative. <br><br><br><br>-- <br>* D a v i d        B e a r d s l e y<br>*           xouoxnoREMOVE-THIS@virtulink.com<br>*<br>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br>*<br>* http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>AFMM NY Times review, May 12, 1998</h1><h3><a id=7761 href="#7761">ðŸ”—</a>Xou Oxno &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/12/1998 9:02:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>May 12, 1998<br><br>Microtonal Music: Learning the Language of the Notes Between the <br>Notes<br><br>By ANTHONY TOMMASINI<br><br>To many concertgoers, the concept of microtonal music <br>may seem intimidatingly complex.
