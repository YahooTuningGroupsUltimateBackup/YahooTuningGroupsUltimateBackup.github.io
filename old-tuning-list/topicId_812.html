Try this one sometime:  For the dominant<br>seventh, use 4:6:7 with an added third tuned to 9:7 instead of 5:4.  That<br>provides a dominant seventh chord (or at least a functional equivalent in<br>12-tone contexts) that is easily as dissonant a 4:5:6 with a sharper leading<br>tone than 7:4.  To my ears at least, the resolution of that<br>sharp-leading-tone/flat-subdominant chord is more satisfying than a 4:5:6 with<br>an added seventh at 9:5 or 16:9.
