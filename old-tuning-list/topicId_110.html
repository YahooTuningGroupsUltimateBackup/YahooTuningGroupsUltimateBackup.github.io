So the tonic<br>>wanders over the course of this progression from (in the 88CET notation) the<br>>second-space bass-clef C of the opening I chord, to the pitch-class of the D<br>>(somewhat less than an octave above the C) of the final chord.

The possibilities for smooth voice-movement when voices can't move<br>>through octave-doubles of other chord tones, dwindles rapidly.  Even in<br>>three-part harmony, you end up having to use lots of chords with fifths below<br>>their roots, or ninth chords (fifths above their fifths).

However, human hearing is a hierarchical process made up of many <br>>layers of abstraction.  <br>>Small acoustic stimuli shade imperceptibly into larger ones, leading <br>>inexorably to such large-scale percepts as "key center," "cadence," and<br>> "discordance" and "concordance." As Eberhard Zwicker points <br>>out, "It is clear that psychoacoustics plays an important role in musical <br>>acoustics.  There are many basic aspects of musical sounds that are <br>>correlated with the sensations already discussed in psycoacoustics.  <br>>Examples may be different pitch qualities of pure tones and complex sounds, <br>>perception of duration, loudness and partially-masked loudness, sharpness <br>>as a an aspect of timbre, perception of sound impulses as events within the <br>>temporal patterns leading to rhythm, roughness, and the equivalence of <br>>sensational intervals.  For this reason it can be stated that most of this <br>>book's contents are also of interest in musical acoustics. At this point we <br>>can concentrate on two aspects that have not been discussed so far: musical <br>>consonance and the Gestalt principle." [Zwicker, E. and H. Fastl, <br>>Psychoacoustics: Facts and Models, 1990, pg. 312]<br>>Zwicker characterizes the hierarchical perception of musical tones by <br>>drawing a distinction between sensory consonance (perceived roughness, <br>>sharpness, and noisiness of the tone) and harmony, (perceived tonal <br>>affinity, tolerability, and root relationship of tones or sequences of tones <br>>to a scale).  <br>>So doing, he posits that both modes of perception are hierarchically involved<br>> in the sensation of musical consonance.<br>>Both experience and experiment tell us that the process of listening to <br>>music involves levels of neural organization above the purely physical <br>>acoustic operation of the inner ear.  While the point of maximal stimulation <br>>on the basilar membrane indicates a simple mechanical Fourier analysis of <br>>sounds entering the ear, the firing pattern of neural fibers in the auditory <br>>nerve encodes pitch and spectral information in the nerve system in a <br>>complex way.<br>>The path between primary auditory nerve and cerebral cortex is not a simple <br>>one.  Many feedback loops control the processing of auditory information, <br>>and there are many opportunities for higher brain centers to alter the raw <br>>input travelling up the auditory nerve--and vice versa.<br>>The anatomy of the pathway between the auditiory nerve and   the cerebral <br>>cortex is complex: the cells of the primary neurons (that is, those in the <br>>auditory nerve) are located within the modiolus of the cochlea; these <br>>primary nurons terminate in the cochlear nucleus, a mass of gray matter <br>>located in the dorsal and lateral portion of the medulla oblongata. Here the <br>>physical nerve connection breaks. From this point there is a synpatic <br>>connection (mediated by neurotransmitters) to the neurons of the inferior <br>>colliculus.  After another synpatic gap in the neural pathway, the third-<br>>order neurons converge on the medial geniculate body, the final relay station<br>> on the auditory path to the cerebral cortex. It's worth nothing that the <br>>medial geniculate body not only collates fibers from the audtiory nerve, but <br>>also from other sensory systems and from the cerebral cortex as well. Thus <br>>the geniculate body serves not as a passive relay station so much as an <br>>active filtering and integrating locus.<br>>>From the geniculate body, the fourth-order auditory neurons connect with <br>>the cerebral conrtex by way of a thin sheet of radiating nerve fibers.  These <br>>radiations include corticofugal fibers running from the cortex back to the <br>>medial geniculate body.<br>>Thus the auditory neural pathway contains a complex feedback loop, <br>>controlled by several sets of higher brain loci, running between the auditory <br>>nerve and the cerebral cortex.  <br>>Most of the fourth-order neurons enter a small region ofthe posterial half <br>>of the horizontal wall of the Sylvian fissure, which acts as a focal zone for <br>>the entire auditory cortex. The complexity of the auditory region of the <br>>Sylvian fissure is daunting: each cochlear fiber makes connections with <br>>thousands of other neurons grouped in at least thirteen regions, and <br>>populated by many different types of neurons. To make the process even <br>>more complex, not all of these neurons respond identically. Some produce <br>>strong signals when presented with tones in a <br>>particular frequency range but do not respond to tones in other frequency <br>>ranges. A small fraction of neurons emit strong signals when two different <br>>frequencies are sounded together, but these same neurons produce little or <br>>no response when either frequency sounds alone. Some neurons are most <br>>strongly stimulated by sounds at specific amplitudes: sounds outside this <br>>narrow amplitude window cause no resopnse from suchneurons. For yet other<br>> auditory nerve fibers, the higher the sound's amplitude, the stronger the <br>>response, until a satuation point is reached. Some neurons respond best toe <br>>amplitude-moedulated tones, others to frequency-modulated tones. Some <br>>neurons respond with paritcular vehemence to sounds coming from a <br>>particular region of space, and some neurons respond best to sounds that <br>>are moving in space.<br>>Because these cortical loci consist of neural pathways, they are formed by <br>>learned response and can be changed.  Thus, the impact of culture and <br>>experience on musical perception is at least as great as the physical <br>>sensory correlates of musical tone--if not greater.<br>>"I once attended...a concert in Bangkok that was totally mystifying. I could <br>>see that the audience was utterly enraptured, swooning at moments of <br>>apparently overwhelming emotional beauty that made no impression on me <br>>whatsoever; not only that, I couldn't distinguish them from any other <br>>moments in the piece." [Eno, Brian, "Resonant Complexity," Whole Earth <br>>Review, May 1995, pg. 42]<br>>This points to a important caveat.  While the results adduced so far provide <br>>evidence for this or that musical tuning system ont he basis of sensory <br>>consonance, psychoacoustics cannot describe or validate the higher levels <br>>of musical organization implicit in a tuning system.<br>>Thus the internal structure of a tuning is different from the sensory <br>>consonance produced by intervals within that tuning.  For example: Risset's, <br>>Pierce's and Sethares' timbral mapping procedure, following the <br>>implications of research by Plomp and Levelt and Kameoka and Kuriyagawa, <br>>allow a composer to control the level of *sensory consonance * in a given <br>>tuning, but mapping the component partials of a sound into a given <br>>maximally consonant set for a specific scale does *not * change the <br>>inherent tonality of the scale, its Rothenberg propriety, the Barlow <br>>harmonicity or the Wilson efficiency of the scale.<br>>In short, by changing timbre, note duration, and compositional style one can <br>>change the surface affect of music produced in a given tuning: but the <br>>deeper structural elements of the tuning remain invariant. <br>>Ivor Darreg described one of the deeper structural invariants in a given <br>>tuning as its "mood:" "In my opinion, the striking and characteristic moods <br>>of many tuning-systems will become the most powerful and compelling <br>>reason for exploring beyond 12-tone equal temperament. It is necessary to <br>>have more than one non-twelve-tone system before these moods can be <br>>heard and their significance appreciated." [Darreg, Ivor, "Xenharmonic <br>>Bulletin No. 5, 1975, pg. 1]<br>>David Rothenberg proposed that the Rothenberg propriety of a scale <br>>explains some aspects of the scale's deep structure; Clouth and Douthett <br>>duplicated some of this work in their article "On Well-Formed Scales."  <br>>John Chalmers has speculated that Rothenberg propriety explains the sense <br>>of tension in such tunings as Ptolemy's intense diatonic.<br>>In addition to the "mood" or overall "sound" of a given tuning, Darreg and <br>>McLaren (1991) pointed out that each tuning exhibits some degree of <br>>inherent bias toward melody or harmony.  The Pythagorean intonation and <br>>13-tone equal temperament, for example, are both strongly biased toward <br>>melody, while 31-tone equal temperament and 13-limit just intonation are <br>>strongly biased toward harmony.<br>>Douglas Keislar made this same point in his 1992 doctoral thesis.  In it, <br>>Keislar describes research which demonstrates that altering the surface <br>>characteristics of the music--timbre, tempo, spatialization--does not <br>>change the deeper structural characteristics of the tuning. Thus, while <br>>mapped overtones will make a comopsition in 13-tone equal temperament <br>>sound more acoustically smooth, it does not change the essentially atonal <br>>character of the 13-tone scale, nor does it materially affect the scale <br>>"mood." Similarly, changing the timbres of a composition in Ptolemy's <br>>intense diatonic tuning will alter the degree of sensory roughness or <br>>smoothness; adding reverberation will mask to greater or lesser degree <br>>some of the overall "sound" of the composition.  But the sense of aesthetic <br>>tension created by scale intervals which are, in Rothenberg's usage, <br>>improper, will remain unchanged.<br>>Thus the implications for tuning suggested by psychoacoustic research <br>>must be viewed as separate from larger musical and perceptual questions. <br>>Because current psychoacoustic experiments focus on questions of sensory <br>>perception, there remains a dichotomy between what Easley Blackwood has <br>>called "concordance and discordance" and sensory consonance and <br>>dissonance. In fact sensory consonance is a misnomer: the effects are more <br>>accurately described as sensations of auditory roughness or smoothness.<br>>Depending on the tuning or the composition, intervals which are perceived <br>>as rough may prove concordant, while intervals which prdouce the auditory <br>>sensation of smoothness may strike the listener as discordant--that is, out <br>>of place musically.  In Western music, the best example of this phenomenon <br>>is the perfect fourth, which sounds acoutically smoother than the major <br>>third but which by itself generally constitutes an unstable and  musically <br>>discordant interval.<br>>In Balinese and Javanese music, the best example is the stretched 1215-<br>>cent octave, which sounds acoustically rough but which produces as sense <br>>of musical concordance when performed by a gamelan.<br>>The most striking example in my own experience was a 1990 concert by <br>>the Women's National Chorus of Bulgaria. One of the duets (a folk song <br>>from the Thracian plains) ended on a large major just second (9/8).  The <br>>Western audience sat without moving forwhat seemed a long time: only <br>>when the  singers bowed did the audience realize the duet was over, and <br>> applaud.  In  this case the contradiction between learned perceptions of <br>>concordance and cadence, and the sensory perception of roughness in the <br>>cadential intervals, prevented the audience from correctly perceiving the <br>>cadence. <br>>It is important not to confuse sensory roughness or smoothness, as <br>>measured by psychoacoustical experiments, with higher-level perceptions <br>>of musical consonance and dissonance. Many advocates of just intonation <br>>have baselessly conflated the two categories, while advocates of Fetis' <br>>model (viz., all auditory responses are predominately learned responses) <br>>excessively emphasize the abstract levels of hierarchical auditory <br>>perception while unjustifiably discounting the purely physical processes at <br>>work in the human ear/brain system--in particular the frequency-analysis <br>>operations of the basilar membrane and the periodicity-extraction <br>>mechanism of the neurons in the auditory nerve. <br>>Ultimately, what Zwicker calls Gestalt musical perception is mediated not <br>>only by the physics and acoustics of the inner ear, but also by primary, <br>>secondary, third-order and fourth-order neurons, a variety of different <br>>brain locations, and the operant conditioning imposed by experience, culture <br>>and  musical tradition.  The conclusions of this series of posts must be <br>>taken in that context, and understood in that larger framework.<br>>--mclaren<br>><br>>------------------------------<br>><br>>Topic No. 5<br>><br>>Date: Fri, 20 Oct 1995 19:15:18 -0400 (EDT)<br>>From: "Adam B.

So the tonic<br>>wanders over the course of this progression from (in the 88CET notation) the<br>>second-space bass-clef C of the opening I chord, to the pitch-class of the D<br>>(somewhat less than an octave above the C) of the final chord.

However, human hearing is a hierarchical process made up of many <br>>layers of abstraction.  <br>>Small acoustic stimuli shade imperceptibly into larger ones, leading <br>>inexorably to such large-scale percepts as "key center," "cadence," and<br>> "discordance" and "concordance." As Eberhard Zwicker points <br>>out, "It is clear that psychoacoustics plays an important role in musical <br>>acoustics.  There are many basic aspects of musical sounds that are <br>>correlated with the sensations already discussed in psycoacoustics.  <br>>Examples may be different pitch qualities of pure tones and complex sounds, <br>>perception of duration, loudness and partially-masked loudness, sharpness <br>>as a an aspect of timbre, perception of sound impulses as events within the <br>>temporal patterns leading to rhythm, roughness, and the equivalence of <br>>sensational intervals.  For this reason it can be stated that most of this <br>>book's contents are also of interest in musical acoustics. At this point we <br>>can concentrate on two aspects that have not been discussed so far: musical <br>>consonance and the Gestalt principle." [Zwicker, E. and H. Fastl, <br>>Psychoacoustics: Facts and Models, 1990, pg. 312]<br>>Zwicker characterizes the hierarchical perception of musical tones by <br>>drawing a distinction between sensory consonance (perceived roughness, <br>>sharpness, and noisiness of the tone) and harmony, (perceived tonal <br>>affinity, tolerability, and root relationship of tones or sequences of tones <br>>to a scale).  <br>>So doing, he posits that both modes of perception are hierarchically involved<br>> in the sensation of musical consonance.<br>>Both experience and experiment tell us that the process of listening to <br>>music involves levels of neural organization above the purely physical <br>>acoustic operation of the inner ear.  While the point of maximal stimulation <br>>on the basilar membrane indicates a simple mechanical Fourier analysis of <br>>sounds entering the ear, the firing pattern of neural fibers in the auditory <br>>nerve encodes pitch and spectral information in the nerve system in a <br>>complex way.<br>>The path between primary auditory nerve and cerebral cortex is not a simple <br>>one.  Many feedback loops control the processing of auditory information, <br>>and there are many opportunities for higher brain centers to alter the raw <br>>input travelling up the auditory nerve--and vice versa.<br>>The anatomy of the pathway between the auditiory nerve and   the cerebral <br>>cortex is complex: the cells of the primary neurons (that is, those in the <br>>auditory nerve) are located within the modiolus of the cochlea; these <br>>primary nurons terminate in the cochlear nucleus, a mass of gray matter <br>>located in the dorsal and lateral portion of the medulla oblongata. Here the <br>>physical nerve connection breaks. From this point there is a synpatic <br>>connection (mediated by neurotransmitters) to the neurons of the inferior <br>>colliculus.  After another synpatic gap in the neural pathway, the third-<br>>order neurons converge on the medial geniculate body, the final relay station<br>> on the auditory path to the cerebral cortex. It's worth nothing that the <br>>medial geniculate body not only collates fibers from the audtiory nerve, but <br>>also from other sensory systems and from the cerebral cortex as well. Thus <br>>the geniculate body serves not as a passive relay station so much as an <br>>active filtering and integrating locus.<br>>>From the geniculate body, the fourth-order auditory neurons connect with <br>>the cerebral conrtex by way of a thin sheet of radiating nerve fibers.  These <br>>radiations include corticofugal fibers running from the cortex back to the <br>>medial geniculate body.<br>>Thus the auditory neural pathway contains a complex feedback loop, <br>>controlled by several sets of higher brain loci, running between the auditory <br>>nerve and the cerebral cortex.  <br>>Most of the fourth-order neurons enter a small region ofthe posterial half <br>>of the horizontal wall of the Sylvian fissure, which acts as a focal zone for <br>>the entire auditory cortex. The complexity of the auditory region of the <br>>Sylvian fissure is daunting: each cochlear fiber makes connections with <br>>thousands of other neurons grouped in at least thirteen regions, and <br>>populated by many different types of neurons. To make the process even <br>>more complex, not all of these neurons respond identically. Some produce <br>>strong signals when presented with tones in a <br>>particular frequency range but do not respond to tones in other frequency <br>>ranges. A small fraction of neurons emit strong signals when two different <br>>frequencies are sounded together, but these same neurons produce little or <br>>no response when either frequency sounds alone. Some neurons are most <br>>strongly stimulated by sounds at specific amplitudes: sounds outside this <br>>narrow amplitude window cause no resopnse from suchneurons. For yet other<br>> auditory nerve fibers, the higher the sound's amplitude, the stronger the <br>>response, until a satuation point is reached. Some neurons respond best toe <br>>amplitude-moedulated tones, others to frequency-modulated tones. Some <br>>neurons respond with paritcular vehemence to sounds coming from a <br>>particular region of space, and some neurons respond best to sounds that <br>>are moving in space.<br>>Because these cortical loci consist of neural pathways, they are formed by <br>>learned response and can be changed.  Thus, the impact of culture and <br>>experience on musical perception is at least as great as the physical <br>>sensory correlates of musical tone--if not greater.<br>>"I once attended...a concert in Bangkok that was totally mystifying. I could <br>>see that the audience was utterly enraptured, swooning at moments of <br>>apparently overwhelming emotional beauty that made no impression on me <br>>whatsoever; not only that, I couldn't distinguish them from any other <br>>moments in the piece." [Eno, Brian, "Resonant Complexity," Whole Earth <br>>Review, May 1995, pg. 42]<br>>This points to a important caveat.  While the results adduced so far provide <br>>evidence for this or that musical tuning system ont he basis of sensory <br>>consonance, psychoacoustics cannot describe or validate the higher levels <br>>of musical organization implicit in a tuning system.<br>>Thus the internal structure of a tuning is different from the sensory <br>>consonance produced by intervals within that tuning.  For example: Risset's, <br>>Pierce's and Sethares' timbral mapping procedure, following the <br>>implications of research by Plomp and Levelt and Kameoka and Kuriyagawa, <br>>allow a composer to control the level of *sensory consonance * in a given <br>>tuning, but mapping the component partials of a sound into a given <br>>maximally consonant set for a specific scale does *not * change the <br>>inherent tonality of the scale, its Rothenberg propriety, the Barlow <br>>harmonicity or the Wilson efficiency of the scale.<br>>In short, by changing timbre, note duration, and compositional style one can <br>>change the surface affect of music produced in a given tuning: but the <br>>deeper structural elements of the tuning remain invariant. <br>>Ivor Darreg described one of the deeper structural invariants in a given <br>>tuning as its "mood:" "In my opinion, the striking and characteristic moods <br>>of many tuning-systems will become the most powerful and compelling <br>>reason for exploring beyond 12-tone equal temperament. It is necessary to <br>>have more than one non-twelve-tone system before these moods can be <br>>heard and their significance appreciated." [Darreg, Ivor, "Xenharmonic <br>>Bulletin No. 5, 1975, pg. 1]<br>>David Rothenberg proposed that the Rothenberg propriety of a scale <br>>explains some aspects of the scale's deep structure; Clouth and Douthett <br>>duplicated some of this work in their article "On Well-Formed Scales."  <br>>John Chalmers has speculated that Rothenberg propriety explains the sense <br>>of tension in such tunings as Ptolemy's intense diatonic.<br>>In addition to the "mood" or overall "sound" of a given tuning, Darreg and <br>>McLaren (1991) pointed out that each tuning exhibits some degree of <br>>inherent bias toward melody or harmony.  The Pythagorean intonation and <br>>13-tone equal temperament, for example, are both strongly biased toward <br>>melody, while 31-tone equal temperament and 13-limit just intonation are <br>>strongly biased toward harmony.<br>>Douglas Keislar made this same point in his 1992 doctoral thesis.  In it, <br>>Keislar describes research which demonstrates that altering the surface <br>>characteristics of the music--timbre, tempo, spatialization--does not <br>>change the deeper structural characteristics of the tuning. Thus, while <br>>mapped overtones will make a comopsition in 13-tone equal temperament <br>>sound more acoustically smooth, it does not change the essentially atonal <br>>character of the 13-tone scale, nor does it materially affect the scale <br>>"mood." Similarly, changing the timbres of a composition in Ptolemy's <br>>intense diatonic tuning will alter the degree of sensory roughness or <br>>smoothness; adding reverberation will mask to greater or lesser degree <br>>some of the overall "sound" of the composition.  But the sense of aesthetic <br>>tension created by scale intervals which are, in Rothenberg's usage, <br>>improper, will remain unchanged.<br>>Thus the implications for tuning suggested by psychoacoustic research <br>>must be viewed as separate from larger musical and perceptual questions. <br>>Because current psychoacoustic experiments focus on questions of sensory <br>>perception, there remains a dichotomy between what Easley Blackwood has <br>>called "concordance and discordance" and sensory consonance and <br>>dissonance. In fact sensory consonance is a misnomer: the effects are more <br>>accurately described as sensations of auditory roughness or smoothness.<br>>Depending on the tuning or the composition, intervals which are perceived <br>>as rough may prove concordant, while intervals which prdouce the auditory <br>>sensation of smoothness may strike the listener as discordant--that is, out <br>>of place musically.  In Western music, the best example of this phenomenon <br>>is the perfect fourth, which sounds acoutically smoother than the major <br>>third but which by itself generally constitutes an unstable and  musically <br>>discordant interval.<br>>In Balinese and Javanese music, the best example is the stretched 1215-<br>>cent octave, which sounds acoustically rough but which produces as sense <br>>of musical concordance when performed by a gamelan.<br>>The most striking example in my own experience was a 1990 concert by <br>>the Women's National Chorus of Bulgaria. One of the duets (a folk song <br>>from the Thracian plains) ended on a large major just second (9/8).  The <br>>Western audience sat without moving forwhat seemed a long time: only <br>>when the  singers bowed did the audience realize the duet was over, and <br>> applaud.  In  this case the contradiction between learned perceptions of <br>>concordance and cadence, and the sensory perception of roughness in the <br>>cadential intervals, prevented the audience from correctly perceiving the <br>>cadence. <br>>It is important not to confuse sensory roughness or smoothness, as <br>>measured by psychoacoustical experiments, with higher-level perceptions <br>>of musical consonance and dissonance. Many advocates of just intonation <br>>have baselessly conflated the two categories, while advocates of Fetis' <br>>model (viz., all auditory responses are predominately learned responses) <br>>excessively emphasize the abstract levels of hierarchical auditory <br>>perception while unjustifiably discounting the purely physical processes at <br>>work in the human ear/brain system--in particular the frequency-analysis <br>>operations of the basilar membrane and the periodicity-extraction <br>>mechanism of the neurons in the auditory nerve. <br>>Ultimately, what Zwicker calls Gestalt musical perception is mediated not <br>>only by the physics and acoustics of the inner ear, but also by primary, <br>>secondary, third-order and fourth-order neurons, a variety of different <br>>brain locations, and the operant conditioning imposed by experience, culture <br>>and  musical tradition.  The conclusions of this series of posts must be <br>>taken in that context, and understood in that larger framework.<br>>--mclaren<br>><br>>------------------------------<br>><br>>Topic No. 5<br>><br>>Date: Fri, 20 Oct 1995 19:15:18 -0400 (EDT)<br>>From: "Adam B.
