It depends<br>on your application.<br><br>If 12 note per octave scales are sufficient and you don't mind working in<br>MIDI sysex codes, then Roland GS instruments are very affordable and<br>available in just about any format:  sound card, sound module, keyboard,<br>digital piano, stand alone sequencer, etc.  Instruments like the XP-60 and<br>XP-80 provide very complete workstations (sequencer, synthesis, effects and<br>mixing bus) and front panel microtonal scale editing as well.<br><br>Ensoniq synths and samples are good if you need 1-4 full keyboard scales<br>with any number of notes per octave.  The samplers are good workstations,<br>but the ASR-10/88 are weak in the sampling department compared to other<br>current samplers.  The ASR-X is an updated sampler/synth that looks like a<br>good value if you don't need a piano style keyboard.<br><br>I could not disagree more about the Kurzweil's being non-intuitive.  Unlike<br>every other synth I've used, all parameters are in REAL values, not decimal<br>coded binary.  Filter cutoff frequencies are given in notes and cents,<br>amplifiers are calibrated in dB, etc.  The architecture is more like a<br>modular analog synthesizer than a fixed one, so it is correspondingly more<br>powerful.  A Kurzweil K2000 or K2500 is especially adept at modulating just<br>intonation scales since it has 255 user programmable intonation tables that<br>can be switched in real time.  These scales are limited to 12 notes per<br>octave.  However, nTET scales can be easily created at the program level.  <br><br>Another consideration is sound quality.  Ensoniq samplers and all wavetable<br>synthesizers (just about everything else) use linear interpolation for<br>frequency shifting.  This introduces distortion in the form of inharmonic<br>overtones when a note is transposed from its sampled pitch.  While it may<br>not be as important for nTET, it makes a big difference for just<br>intonation, where the inharmonic overtones stick out like a sore thumb. <br>The K2000 and K2500 use an improved interpolation scheme that greatly<br>reduces the transposition distortion.
