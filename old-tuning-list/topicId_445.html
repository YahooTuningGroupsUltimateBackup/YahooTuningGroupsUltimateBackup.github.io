I have taught the harmonic series in music theory,<br>computer music, world music and other classes whenever I have been able to.<br>And, despite Brian's characterization of university professors as a<br>monolithic bastion against such ideas, I know of other professors who also<br>think that a revision of standard music theory curricula is long overdue.<br>But there are problems:<br><br>1) Large-scale revisions of multi-semester sequences taught by different<br>people are very difficult to implement (especially by young, untenured<br>instructors). If the semester 3 instructor is expecting the students to<br>know what a Neapolitan sixth is, then that's something the semester 2<br>instructor is obliged to include. Enough of these obligations and there's<br>little time left for the harmonic series.

The difficulty of forging a very new consensus is certainly part<br>of what gives academic institutions their reputation for conservative<br>inertia.<br><br>2) Let's not forget the students. In my (admittedly limited) experience,<br>they come in three basic flavors:<br>a) The students who are basically non-music majors who are mainly<br>interested in learning to read music, understand chords, and know harmonic<br>progressions well enough to write their own pop songs.

Like all of us, they have certain<br>goals in their lives that drive their decisions.

I don't think that university educators should necessarily<br>pander to them, but I think it's unrealistic to expect a music school to<br>completely flaunt the students' educational goals and instead force another<br>curriculum on them.<br><br>I agree that the time and attention devoted to the minutiae of harmonic<br>practices of European art music in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries<br>in most music programs is seriously disproportionate. In my opinion, much<br>of that time would be better spent on tuning systems, acoustics, and music<br>of other cultures and traditions.<br><br>I don't want to give the impression that the situation is hopeless either.<br>These concepts can be given limited exposure in standard classes, much more<br>exposure in classes outside the regular curriculum, and even more through<br>personal contact with enthusiastic, intelligent students.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.

It's good to hear an insider's take on where some of<br>the difficulties lie.  Even though my formal Music education (beyond untold<br>hours of private lessons and reading on more advanced topics) stops at the<br>traditional Freshman and Sophomore Theory and Ear-Training classes, I've seen a<br>lot of what Bill's mentioned from a student's perspective.  Many of us have I'm<br>sure.  <br><br>   One factor in all of this that I find encouraging, perhaps surprisingly or<br>even ironically, is community colleges.  They have some advantages over<br>full-blown Universities with regard to innovative curricula:  <br>1.  In most US states anyway, they are paid by enrollment, so they are always<br>    scrounging for ways to keep students' interest rather than to weed them <br>    out.<br>2.  They have somewhat less pressure to provide specific knowledge to feed into<br>    Junior- and Senior-level courses.  <br>3.  A fair percentage of their student body consists somewhat older adults who<br>    are taking music (or whatever) courses simply because they want to, rather <br>    than to begrudgingly fill some required slot in the curriculum.  <br>4.  Most community colleges have fewer distractions (football for one, but <br>    let's not get into that!).  <br>5.  Since they lack the tenure system, they're a little more open to hiring <br>    innovative instructors.  <br><br>   Of course, they have disadvantages as well, especially the overall quality of<br>student (and instructor to a fair degree) they attract.  Some are quite good<br>though, my bassoon teacher back in high school was one.  <br><br>   Well, it's something to bear in mind anyway.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 6 Jun 1996 18:18 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA06916; Thu, 6 Jun 1996 09:18:36 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 6 Jun 1996 09:18:36 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.960606120714.22066H-100000@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3022 href="#3022">ðŸ”—</a>eig@ccrma.stanford.edu (Enrique Moreno)</h3><span>6/7/1996 2:54:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I am under the impression that the main reason for our usual higher-education music curricula to devote 4 semesters to  <br>tonal harmony is the bulk of the greatest music ever composed can be described in terms of tonal functions or modal relations.  <br>This attitude is the natural consequence of a causal relationship where the great works are first and the theoretical interest  <br>afterwards.<br>	It would seem equally natural, then, that there is no interest for a generalized practice of educating music students in  <br>the *how-to*s of some "exotic" intonation systems for which there is no significant corpus of real masterpieces.

First, I don't believe that "the<br>bulk of the greatest music ever composed" lies within the last 300 years or<br>so of Western European culture. When the world's music is viewed as a<br>whole, certainly ideas such as tonal harmony, 12TET, and counterpoint are<br>the "exotic" concepts.

My job is to get the students to understand pieces, and<br>perhaps come away turned onto a piece or type of music that they were<br>previously unaware of, or to see an old favorite in a new light.<br><br>Finally, I don't teach tuning systems so that students will understand<br>Harry Partch, for example, or other composers who use "exotic" intonation<br>systems. I teach them because they are a fundamental part of all<br>pitch-based music. I much prefer to teach the "whys" that lie behind even<br>common-practice theory (as far as is known) than to have students memorize<br>chord spellings and rules.<br><br>For example: Why is singing in parallel octaves not considered polyphony?<br>Why is an augmented chord dissonant, if all its component intervals are<br>consonant? What is the meaning of the title The Well-Tempered Clavier? Why<br>does a string quartet suddenly have to adjust in a common-tone modulation<br>to some foreign keys?

Some tunings require<br>that the fifth be treated as a dissonance (13-TET,<br>18-TET, 23-TET, many of Erv Wilson's higher-order CPSs),<br>while other tunings require that the fifth be treated<br>as a consonance (22-TET, standard-limit ji arrays).<br>In some tunings root progression by fifths produce<br>the most powerful and convincing cadences (19-TET,<br>7-limit ji) while in other tunings root progressions<br>by other intervals produce the most powerful and<br>convincing cadences (some of Erv Wilson's higher-<br>level CPSs, 15-TET,  varius non-just non-equal<br>tunings like the metal tube scale or the free-free<br>metal bar scale).<br>This explains why Krumhansl and other respected<br>researchers keep "discovering" that 12-TET is "the<br>best tuning" for melodies.   When you measure everything<br>by a 12-TET yardstick, 12 looks best.<br>You'd think that none of this would be controversial<br>or astonishing, yet these ideas seem to wallop<br>the psychoacoustics community with the force of<br>divine revelation.

"Translated from the Italian<br>with an introduction by Barclay Brown." Pendragon<br>press, New York, 1986, Monographs in Music No. 6.<br>This book is a collection of short essays written<br>by the Italian futurist Russolo.<br>Creator of the orchestra of noise-makers known<br>as intonarumori, Russolo is one of the founts<br>from which springs modern music.<br>(Great names for the instruments: "Sobbers," "wailers,"<br>"shriekers."  Sort of like the New Yorker music critic<br>at one of Johnny Reinhard's concepts.)<br>It is less well known that Russolo was a radical and<br>persistant microtonalist.<br>In the paper entitled "The Conquest of Enharmonicism,"<br>Russolo sets forth explicitly his dissatisfaction with<br>12-TET and his militant advocacy of UNtempered<br>harmonic series-based tunings.<br>"After the introduction of the tempered system<br>in music, only the word Enharmonicism remained<br>to indicate the values that no longer found corres-<br>pondence in musical reality. Indeed, the difference<br>between an E sharp and an F, and a B sharp and a C<br>are called enharmonic, while the tempered system,<br>in rendering the semitones equal, has removed this<br>difference and made the two notes into the same<br>sound.<br>"But unfortunately, the inconvenient result of the<br>tempered system does not lie only in the word.<br>Once that the octave was divided into only *twelve*<br>*equal* fractions and applied in the tempred scale,<br>there resulted a considerable limitation of the number<br>of practical sounds and a strange artificiality in <br>those that were adopted.  The difference between<br>the scale of the tempered system and hte natural<br>one are well known. (..) With wind instruments,<br>which produce the harmonic series of the fundamental<br>note, the 7th, 11th, 13th and 14th harmonics are<br>likewise corrected in their intonation to produce what<br>we call closed sounds.<br>"In the tempered system, therefore, the difference <br>between the large and small whole tone (9/8:10/9 = 81/80)<br>has disapperaed.  Similarly, the differences between the <br>diatonic semitone (16/15) and the chromatic ones (23/22<br>and 25/24) has also vanished. (..)<br>"A tempered harmonic system can be compared in a sense<br>to a system of painting that abolishes all the infinite<br>gradations of the seven colors (red, orange, yellow, green,<br>blue, indigo and violet) and accepts only  their type of<br>color, having only one yellow, one green and so on."<br>This is a remarkable passage.  It almost exactly<br>parallels several passages from Harry Partch.  In<br>"A Quarter-Saw Section of Motivations and Intonations,"<br>Partch talks in almost exactly the same way about <br>a rainbow of colors being collapsed down into dull<br>simplistic hues.<br>Moreover, it's clear that Russolo knew very well the<br>intricacies and advantages of just intonation, and that<br>he thought the so-called natural (read: harmonic series-<br>based) tuning superior to the tempered one.<br>It's interesting that when this debate between harmonic-<br>series-based and expanded equal-temperament (viz.,<br>48-TET, 41-TET, 72-TET, etc.) occurred in Russia between<br>1917-1928, the Russian expanded equal-temperament<br>faction won out.  But when this debate occurred in Italy<br>between 1917-1928, the Italian futurists made the<br>fascinating choice of chucking tonality entirely in<br>favor of noise.  During the same period in Germany,<br>Schoenberg resolved the debate by chucking tonality<br>in favor of an elaborate scheme of statistically <br>distributing the familiar 5-limit equal-tempered<br>12 pitches.  In Mexico, Novaro and Carrillo resolved<br>this debate by choosing the Russian option but using<br>live acoustic instead of electronic instruments.<br>Thus the claim that "Schoenberg solved the dilemma<br>of the exhaustion of tonality" is untrue, insofar as<br>MANY solutions were implemented in various different<br>countries.  The only solutions which survive to this<br>day are the Russian one (represented today by folks<br>who compose & perform microtonal music on synthesizers)<br>and the Mexican one (represented today by folks who<br>compose & perform microtonal music on acoustic<br>instruments.)<br>Needless to say, the German "solution" to the exhaustion of <br>12-TET tonality didn't last beyond 1978, and post-Webern <br>serial composition is now a dead art form with no attraction <br>for contemporary composers.<br>Clearly, someone should do a 1/1 article on Russolo<br>& his advocacy of ji as an Italian solution to this problem.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 9 Jun 1996 07:00 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA27039; Sat, 8 Jun 1996 22:00:05 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 8 Jun 1996 22:00:05 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199606090458.WAA07938@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3048 href="#3048">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/1996 12:02:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: construction of a 19-tone m'bira<br>--<br>The Sonic Arts Gallery is constantly boiling with<br>new ideas and plans for new instruments, so it<br>came as no surprise when Jonathan Glasier began<br>work on a 19-tone m'bira.<br>Patterend after Bill Wesley's "array m'bira," this<br>instrument is to an african thumb piano as a 747<br>is to the Wright brothers' biplane.<br>Bill Wesley's "array" arrangement of tines places<br>consonant intervals closest to one another, while<br>putting dissonant intervals far apart.

Moreover, McLaren seems to love neutral thirds <br>and hate tritones; I have to strongly disagree with his consonance judgments <br>here.

However,<br>all three of these composers are extremely<br>talented and their work is well worth listening<br>to.<br>However, it's hard to get hold of.  IRCAM has put<br>out a CD of Phillipe Hurel's pieces performed<br>by the Ensemble Contemporaine at the Espace<br>Projection in Paris. Other than that CD, there's<br>little available in this country.  (I heard Grisey's<br>"Joure, contre-jour" and some Mureil pieces whose<br>names escape me off cassette at a friend's house. <br>The friend had just returned from Paris.)<br>This is one instance where the French seem to<br>be ahead of us Americans.  While isolated voices<br>like John R. Pierce and James Dashow and <br>William Sethares have been talking about the<br>musical and compositional benefits of fitting<br>timbre to tuning, there is as yet no organized<br>movement of "spectral composition" in America.<br>This is peculiar, inasmuch as virtuoso groups like<br>Johnny Reinhard's AFMM exist in prominent American<br>cities, and these performers can *easily* perform<br>high-limit just ratios on traditional acoustic<br>instruments.<br>Listening to Johnny Reinhard quadratic just intonation<br>string quartet "Cosmic Rays" made my jaw drop.  These<br>performers can hit *any* pitch, and do it at top speed,<br>and do it consistently.<br>You'd think with these kind of musicians available in<br>this country, we'd have a full-blown "spectral <br>composition" movement.<br>To give you an idea of how important the spectral<br>composition movement is in French avant-garde<br>circles right now, consider the following quote<br>from Denis Cohen:<br>"I tried to show in an article I wrote ("Ulysses<br>and the Mermaids") that the contrast often made<br>in France between serial music and spectral music<br>was probably useful conceptually, but was <br>incomplete and bore littel relation with reality."<br>In America, the contrast is between the New Complexity<br>and minimalism of one sort or another.  But in<br>France, the lines of division are drawn between<br>Fortean set-theory serialism and spectral<br>composition.<br>--<br>Another (non-spectral) French composer of note<br>is the aforementioned Denis Cohen.  I mention<br>him because IRCAM has released a new CD of<br>his music, the last track of which is microtonal.<br>"Il SOgno Di Dedalo" (1990-1991).<br>According to Richard Toop's liner notes,<br>"Without venturing a key to the labyrinth of<br>Il Sogno Di Dedalo, one can at least draw<br>attention to some recurrent elements: loping,<br>almost *ethnic* percussion rhythms, rapid<br>melodies in (mostly) four-part harmony,<br>little brass glissandi, falling (and later,<br>rising) microtonal scales, and throbbing<br>Varese-like brass chords."

In fact this could serve<br>as the basis of a fascinating article, were any of the<br>12-TET-obsessed music theory journals interested in<br>publishing such an article. (You never know.  Sometimes<br>they relent.)  <br>The earliest reference to an idea similar to this one <br>appears to be found in Mersenne's Harmonicorum Libri... <br>(1636), pp. 126-127 (last pagination of 2nd ed., 1648).<br>Mersenne defines each interval as equal to a certain<br>number of commas, and some of the commas are <br>incompatible with one another.  <br>This is in the same ballpark as, but clearly not identical<br>to,  Erlich's insight.<br>--<br>Gary Morrison's conceptual difficulties in working with<br>multiple simultaneous tunings are probably what<br>Ivor Darreg used to call a "pseudo-problem."  In other<br>words, something that conceptually seems like<br>an unimaginably difficult issue but which, in real<br>life, turns out to be largely irrelevant or trivial.<br>(Playing 19-TET or 22-TET on a 7-white-5-black<br>keyboard is such a "pseudo-problem." In both cases,<br>the answer is to use open-voiced chord with third<br>and root played by the left hand, fifth by the right<br>hand.  Simple.  Trivial.  What's the problem?)<br>In combining 12-TET and 19-TET, for instance,<br>we in the Southern California Microtonal Group<br>have found it useful to view 19-TET as a gapped<br>nondiatonic  scale with some very xenharmonic<br>ornamental tones.<br>As I've pointed out before (and as Paul Erlich's<br>experiments with his roomate demonstrate), listeners<br>hear the whole-tone portion of a 19-TET diatonic<br>scale as very reasonable and familiar-sounding, but<br>the 2/19 of on octave "semitones" (a misnomer, since<br>this term presupposes that whole tones are <br>divided into 2 parts whereas in 19-TET they are<br>divided into 3 parts)  always make folks squirm.<br>They sound...weird. "Out-of-tune" is the typical<br>description.<br>The solution, in my experience, is to fracture the<br>mislabelled "semitone" intervals in the 19-TET<br>approximation of the 12-TET diatonic scale into<br>1/19s of a tone.  Thus a typical melody in 19-TET<br>will proceed by whole steps which sound very<br>reaonable in combination with 12-TET.  Then<br>a constellation of 1/19-octave steps are used<br>to bridge the gap twixt the next "island" of<br>whole steps in the 19-TET approximation of<br>the diatonic scale.<br>This seems to work reasonably well *provided*<br>that 12-TET semitones and 19-TET 1/19s of<br>an octave don't play simultaneously.  If, instead,<br>these intervals "trade off" between different<br>players (the way good jazz players will trade<br>off playing flatted blues thirds), the 12 + 19<br>combo seems to work well.<br>Another trick that seems to work is to play<br>melodies full of familiar 12-like intervals<br>in 19-TET, but to go above or below the last<br>note of the melody by 1/19 of an octave.<br>This works well, by the way, for many <br>incommensurable ETs: 15 and 12, 14 & 17,<br>15 & 17, 19 & 22, etc.<br>Many ETs are, however, commensurable--<br>that is, one forms a subset of the other,<br>or both form gapped subsets of a much<br>higher division of the octave.<br>When combining 5-TET and 7-TET, for<br>instance, it is often useful to throw<br>in 35-TET chromatic passages.  This<br>emphasizes that the tiny intervals<br>heard between 5-TET and 7-TET pitches<br>that happen to occur vertically are not <br>accidental, but part of the coherent<br>35-TET scale.<br>The issue of combining non-just non-<br>equal-tempered scales with xen ETs,<br>or combining, say, all 3 different <br>classes of tuning simultaneously,<br>is more complex.

The main difference comes<br>perhaps not so much from the intervals of the <br>tunig t hemsleves but from the *context* that<br>the whole tuning as an entity provides for every<br>interval in it.  In this sense, to attempt to classify<br>the new intervals as variations of twelve-tone-to-<br>the-octave equal intervals (or of just intervals)<br>woudl constitute perhaps a reasonable mistake.<br>"It would be reasonable because it is reasonable <br>to attempt to understand unknown things in terms<br>of the things we know, especially if there exists<br>a certain resemblance. It is reasonable to judge <br>the world according tothe categories of our<br>experience, but it is not logical to assume that<br>our categories are the ultimate representation of<br>reality. (..) <br>"Follwoing the same ine of thought, we realize that <br>notating this tuning with the aid of  symbols that <br>make reference to our usual twelve-tone-to-the-<br>octave tuning or to historical tunings would be<br>more or less absurd. Imagine having to interepret<br>the signs ^b, ~#, as "not so flat" and "not so sharp",<br>or -b+++ as "quasi-flat plus three syntonic commas,"<br>or whatever.  In short, regardless that some of the<br>intervals, chords, and even chord progressions may<br>resemble certain well-known intervals, chords, and<br>chord progression,s this tuning and many others <br>(although not necessarily all) deserve a fresh <br>departure point."<br>This is the stronget and clearest statement  I have<br>yet found of one extreme of the attitude toward<br>microtonality--namely, that we should approach<br>the intervals and the tunings anew and search our<br>their properties without preconceptions.  This is<br>clearly not entirely possibe--it remains a fact<br>that the human ear/brain system has measurable<br>properties and various intervals will have predictable<br>*sensory* effects on the auditory system--but in<br>making this point Enrique gets at an extremely<br>important truth.<br>Namely, that the *sensory* affect of an interval or<br>a tuning is not all necessarily the same as the<br>*musical* affect of that interval or tuning.<br>N0orman Cazden made much the same point in<br>the article "On Sensory Consonance," Int. Journ. of<br>Aesthetics and Art Criticism, 1980, but Cazden<br>was mainly concerned with demolishing Helmhotlz's<br>influence.  Enrique's point is much farther-reaching.<br>Now, the other end of the spectrum can be seen<br>in Easley Blackwood's and Paul Rapoport's writings<br>on microtonality.  "When investigating a tuning for<br>which there is no repertoire or tradition of any kind,<br>the most illuminating approach is to look for conenctions<br>between the new tuning and 12-note equal. All the other<br>tunings contain many extremely discordant intervals,<br>and are amenable to row music, or to other non-tonal <br>compositional techniques. But hte most interesting are<br>those that include tonal elements--ie., major and minor<br>triads, and seventh chords, which may be arranged in ways<br>similar to, but not exactly like, 12-note equal." [Blackwood,<br>Easley, "Research Notes, NEH Grant RO-29376-78-0642,<br>1980, page 1]<br>Clearly this approach has a lot of problems.  For example,<br>Blackwood reveals fundamental bias when he states<br>that "major and minor triads" are his primary criteria. <br>This causes him to completely overlook the neutral mode<br>and neutral triads on tunings like 17-TET and 21-TET,<br>and as a result Blackwood makes many verifiably false<br>statements--for example, Blackwood discusses *only*<br>the major and minor triads in 17-TET.  He never discusses<br>the neutral triad, formed from a third with 5 steps of<br>70.588235 cents each. Fortunately, Paul Rapoport revises<br>this oversight--but Paul's overall approach remains<br>relentlessly Pythagorean and 12-TET-based, which is<br>simply not appropriate, say, with melodic modes in 19-TET,<br>or harmonies in 21-TET, or with 9-TET or 7-TET or 10-TET<br>or many other tuning which cannot be jammed into the 12-TET<br>mold.<br>In 17-TET, the neutral melodic mode is an important<br>resource.  Blackwood completely overlooks it.  He does<br>not discuss 8- or 9-tone melodic modes, nor does he<br>discuss pentantonic modes except in 23-TET, to his<br>credit.<br>Thus the great drawback of trying to force all equal<br>temperaments into the conceptual framework of 12-TET<br>is that it leads the composer to completely overlook <br>many useful (but highly non-twelvular) melodic and<br>harmonic resources.<br>On the other hand, Easley Blackwood's and Paul Rapoport's<br>approach to non-12 also has many advantages: by<br>identifying points of similarity with 12, it gives them<br>a place to start analyzing harmonic progressions and<br>melodic modes.<br>The great weakness of Enrique Moreno's position is that<br>he does not provide a conceptual framework for harmonic<br>progressions and melodic modes.<br>The basic idea of Enrique's thesis (to do it gross injustice<br>by boiling it down to a few words) is that non-octave<br>tunings can be characterized by the Nth root of K, where N and<br>K are integers.  In many cases, K then takes on the audible<br>characteristics of the 2:1 (octave) ratio in the twelve-tone<br>equal temperament.  Thus, Enrique contends--and has data<br>from psychoacoustic experiments to prove--that in many <br>cases the K:1 ratio exhibits many of the properties of the<br>octave 2:1 ratio in 12-tone equal temperament. The particular<br>property on which Enrique concentrates is chroma--that is,<br>the property according to which a perceived pitch remains<br>"the same" perceptually if it is displaced up or down by<br>that ratio.  Thus, in 12-TET, a C4 is heard as "the same"<br>as a C3 and a C5; similarly, in the 12th root of 3, Enrique<br>claims (and has data to demonstrate) that a pitch <br>displaced up or down by 3:1 also "sounds the same."<br>This gives a starting point for harmony in non-octave<br>scales, since inversions can now be analyzed, melodic<br>modes can be described, etc.<br>Enrique's approach seems especially praiseworthy because<br>[1] it involves psychoacoustic data, and thus has some<br>connection to the real world--unlike so much mental-<br>masturbation "modern" 12-TET music theory; [2] it has<br>the courage to leave behind 12-TET preconceptions.<br>If it seems utopian that listeners might be expected to utterly<br>abandon 12-TET conventions when listening to mirotonal<br>music, it's well to remember Heinz Werner's paper in<br>the 1940 Journal of Psychology, cited a few posts back.<br>Wener found that, given enough time to familiarize themselves<br>with a microtonal tunings, *every* listener he tested<br>was able to make the leap into hearing the new intervals<br>on their own terms.  <br>Further proof is provided by everyday experience--William<br>Schottstaedt, for example, has pointed out that after working<br>with 11-TET for an extended period, he found that 12-TET<br>sounded "strange" when he returned to it.<br>In sum, Enrique's thesis is a major contribution to microtonal<br>theory.  It also adventurously extends some of the conventional<br>notions of music theory (i.e., octave equivalence) without <br>becoming a slave to 12-TET ideas.<br>--mclaren<br> <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 12 Jul 1996 02:44 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id RAA05905; Thu, 11 Jul 1996 17:44:46 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 11 Jul 1996 17:44:46 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960712003755_71670.2576_HHB80-5@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3204 href="#3204">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/1996 7:27:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: Paul Erlich's points about inharmonic<br> tone complexes - post 1 of 2<br>--<br>John Chalmers informs me that some folks<br>object to the idea of matching inharmonic <br>timbres to inharmonically-derived tunings.<br>Apparently, your contention is that the<br>inharmonic tone complexes tones will be heard<br>as having a virtual pitch entirely different<br>from that of their component inharmonic<br>partials.  Paul Erlich seems typical in<br>these respects.<br>On the surface, this sounds like a good<br>argument.  More: Erlich apparently claims<br>that  inharmonic tone complex will fail<br>to exhibit spectral fusion and will fall apart<br>into a set of discrete partials if they're highly<br>inharmonic.  Thus it would seem pointless<br>to attempt to match a non-just non-equal-<br>tempered tuning to a n-j n-e-t timbre, since<br>the resultant inharmonic timbre will never<br>be heard as having a fundamental pitch<br>related to the pitches of the n-j n-e-t scale<br>from which it is drawn.<br>Is this claim correct?<br>It turns out that it isn't.<br>Paul Erlich strikes me as a smart fellow with<br>some knowledge of acoustics and pyschoacoustics.<br>Alas, as a newly-minted graduate much of Paul's<br>knowledge is book learning only.   And, as it turns<br>out, much of what has been written about complexes<br>of inharmonic tones is either wrong, irrelevant<br>to xenharmonic composition, or the result of <br>peculiar and non-musical experimental conditions.<br>This issue is important.  James Dashow, Jean-Claude<br>Risset, William Sethares, myself, and a number of<br>other composers have produced a substantial body<br>of compositional work in which non-just non-equal-<br>tempered timbres and tunings are used.  If Paul's<br>claims (and some of the available psychoacoustic<br>literature about inharmonic tones) are correct,<br>then the theoretical and musical justification for<br>much of this compositional work collapses.<br>As will be seen, however, there is a great deal<br>of evidence *against* Paul Erlich's view, and<br>many of the psychoacoustic papers which purport<br>to "prove" that inharmonic tone complexes do not<br>audibly fuse are lethally flawed.<br>Let us begin with the alleged evidence *against* the <br>coherent audibility of inharmonic tone complexes:<br>Rayleigh, in his 1876 2-volume text "Acoustics," points<br>out that the fundamental pitch of orchestral timpani<br>is a frequency not present in the partials produced<br>by this instrument.  Rayleigh explained this by<br>pointing out that the ear hears some of the upper<br>partials of timpani as belonging to a fragment of<br>an harmonic series; the ear extrapolates from<br>this harmonic-series fragment a lower pitch<br>which is heard as the fundamental though not<br>physically present.  Other partials, which are<br>physically present, are heard as "hum" notes<br>which do not contribute to the sense of musical<br>pitch of the note.<br>Rayleigh noted the same phenomenon with regard<br>to bells: here again, the lowest several inharmonic<br>partials are heard as "hum" notes, but do not make<br>musical contribution to the sense of pitch of<br>the bell.<br>65 years later Schouten demonstrated in<br>an elegant experiment that the human ear often<br>heard a fundamental pitch not physically present in<br>a musical sound.  "He had constructed a sort<br>of optical siren (Figure 6-4) by means of which<br>he could produce sounds with various waveforms.<br>Using this, he produced sounds with harmonically<br>related partials. (..) Then, by proper adjustments,<br>he could cancel out the fundamental frequency...<br>I could hear this fundamental frequency come and<br>go, but the pitch of the sound did not change at <br>all.  In some way, my ear inferred the proper <br>pitch form the harmonics..." [Pierce, J. R., "The<br>Science of Musical Sound," 2nd ed., 1992, pg. 92]<br>The paper "Pitch of the residue," by J. F.

"Whenever a sound consists<br>of a small number of frequencies, spaced<br>sufficiently widely, subjective sound analysis<br>allows us to hear each Fourier component as a<br>separate pure tone with corresponding pitch<br>(Ohm's acoustical law).  If, however, the<br>frequencies are narrowly spaced, the ear<br>fails partly or completely to analyze the<br>Fourier components into corresponding pure<br>tones and, instead, hears one single percept<br>of sharp timbre.  If, moreover, the frequencies<br>are harmonics of one fundamental frequency,<br>the percept may have a decidedly low pitch."<br>[Schouten, J. R., J. Ritsman, B.

[ibid., pg. 1424]<br>Further evidence for the existence of<br>periodicity (or "virtual") pitch is found<br>in "Periodicity Pitch for Interrupted White<br>Noise--Fact or Artifact?" by Irwin Pollack,<br>J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol 45, no. 1, 1969,<br>pp. 237-238.  The author concludes that<br>switching transients cannot provide a<br>reasonable explanation for the perceived<br>ability of listeners to accurately match<br>the pitch of the interrupted noise despite<br>the fact that "The long-term spectrum of <br>an interrupted white noise shows no <br>sepctral peaks at the frequency of <br>interruption."  Consequently "The results,<br>therefore, suggest that the periodicity pitch<br>of interrupted noise is factual, no artifactual."<br>[Ibid., pg. 238]<br>The book "Frequency Analysis and Periodicity<br>Detection in Hearing," ed. R. Plomp and G. F.<br>SMoorenburg, A. W. Sithoff, Leiden, 1970,<br>adduced further evidence in favor of virtual<br>pitch as the primary pitch extractor in the<br>human auditory system. Franz Bilsen <br>concludes "The perceptual similarity between<br>a sound with its repetition and a pure periodic<br>signal can be represented in a general model<br>for the perceptibility of pitch and timbre. Like<br>the explanation of repteition pitch, time <br>separation pitch, and peridocity pitch, the model<br>finds its description in the time domain."

Sithoff, Leiden, 1970,<br>pp. 291-299]<br>Schouten himself points that the earlier (Helmholtz)<br>explanation of fundamental perception by nonlinear<br>production of difference tones between higher <br>harmonics fails: "The case of the missing fundamental<br>was solved for the time being (the 1860s-1920s)<br>by a modelmaker's brainwave that the nonlinearity <br>of the ear could produce the missing fundamental as<br>a difference tone between the higher harmonics. Both<br>Fletcher (1929) and von Bekesy (1934), now as<br>observers, proved this point by the method of best <br>beats. Sadly enough, the method of best beats is<br>unreliable unless one knows "who beats whom."<br>(..) In a way the discovery of the residue confirmed <br>Seebeck's "wider interpretation" that the high <br>harmonics might contribute somehow to the <br>fundamental tone, except that it is not the<br>fundamental tone itself which is enhanced but a<br>different subject component: the residue.<br>"As a modelmaker, the author (Schouten) ascribed<br>the low pitch of the residue to the *period* in the <br>time pattern of the joint harmonics striking a<br>particular area of the basilar membrane (Schouten,<br>1940s). This amounted to a revival of many older<br>assumptions, except that the initial quasi-Fourier<br>analysis was left standing in full glory.<br>"If a set of harmonics is shifted collectively over<br>a small distance in the frequency scale, the pitch<br>of the residue shifts *in proportion* to the <br>constituent frequencies (Schouten, 1940c). This<br>crucial experiment (now called the first effect<br>of pitch shift) kills two birds with one stone. It<br>implies that pitch is determined neither by the<br>*spacing* of the harmonics, nor by the *time*<br>envelope of the wave pattern since both remain <br>invariant.  Hence, in the realm of modelmaking, <br>it must be anouther form of periodicity detection<br>in the time domain.  This notion goes back to some<br>etent to Seebeck's (1844a) idea of 'the periodic<br>recurrence of an equal or similar state of movement'<br>and to Hermann's (1912) 'intermittence tones.'"<br>[Schouten, J., "The Residue Revisited," Frequency<br>Analysis and Periodicity Detection in Hearing, Ed.<br>R. Plomp and G. F. Smoorenburg, A. W. Sithoff, <br>Leiden, 1970, pp. 41-58]<br>These papers provided apparently convincing<br>proof of the residue's primacy in determining<br>perceived pitch.  Such was the power of the<br>residue pitch hypothesis that, from the late<br> 1960s to the present, Ernst Terhardt<br>produced an influential series of papers based<br>on his model of virtual pitch detection: "Zur<br>Tonho"henwarnehmung von Kla"ngen I. <br>Psykoakustische Grundlagen" [Concerning the<br>perceived pitch height of sounds: I.

Ein Funktionschema," Acustica,<br>Vol. 26, No. 4.,  [Concerning the perceived pitch<br>height of sounds: II. A functional model].<br>Terhardt's theory essentially relegates the<br>residue or "virtual" pitch to the role of a<br>"secondary sensation," ascribing the primary<br>mechanism of pitch detetction to the well-worn<br>place theory, which accords the operation of<br>the basilar membrane primacy in determining<br>pitch. "The pitch of simple tones and the<br>"residue" pitch of complex tones exhibit quite<br>different properties. The pitch of simple tones<br>may be xplained by the principles of the 'classical'<br>place theory. The 'residue' pitch is closely related <br>to the pure tone pitches of partials. It is<br>concluded that the 'residue' pitch may be regarded<br>as a 'seondary sensation,' derived from the pure<br>tone pitches of dominant partials."

In 1976, <br>de Boer's monumental study (he calls it "a<br>textbook inside a book") of the residue pitch<br>defined the field: "On the 'Residue' and Auditory Pitch<br>Perception," in Handbook of Sensory Physiology,<br>Volume 5, No. 3, Springer-Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg-<br>New York, 1976, pp. 481-583]<br>This survey of the residue pitch phenomenon drew<br>on de Boer's doctoral dissertation and provided an<br>unparalleled overview: from Seebeck's acoustic<br>siren to Schouten's and Ritsma's work, to the<br>evidence from chopped noise (Pollock, op. cit.),<br>to Smoorenburg's own work.<br>Here, however, doubt begins to creep in about<br>the universal validity of the residue hypothesis<br>as the basis of pitch detection. "Must we say<br>goodbye to the 'residue'? We might be inclined<br>to say: yes. In the course of this treatise, we<br>witnessed the gradual change of meaning of<br>tjhe term 'resideu,' a change that finally led<br>to a new and less restrictive definition (see e.g.,<br>Section E. 10). At the same time the musical<br>aspects of 'residue pitch' grew more and more <br>important. (..) What is also new is the<br>ambiguity involved in residue pitch. This was <br>recognized rather reluctantly at first (Section <br>E. 6); later, it was considered an essential feature<br>of the mechanism (Section E 14). How essential<br>it is did not become completely clear before the<br>work on two-tone complexes and musical intervals<br>(Section H. 2). In last instance, even the harmonic<br>number n of the lower partial appeared to be<br>esentially ambiguous (Section H. 6). The ambiguity<br>involves one other concept that is, in the opinion of<br>the present reviewer, of the greatest importance. (..)<br>When we listen to a sound, we do not perceive this or <br>that aspect of the sound all the time; what we perceive<br>depends completely on our training. (..) Hence,<br>the fact that the result of a particular experiment <br>turns out to be extremely clear-cut does not <br>necessarily imply that ever naive listener is able <br>to perceive the signals in the same way. It is not too <br>difficult to associate a residue pitch with a two-<br>tone complex presented monaurally. But to do the <br>same with a two-tone complex presented dichotically<br>is quite anotehr matter. (..) We may conclude that we<br>must be extremely cautious in our conclusions."<br>[de Boer, E., "On the 'Residue' and Auditory Pitch<br>Perception," Handbook of Sensory Physiology, Vol. 5,<br>No. 3, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1976, pp. 572-574]<br>R.

She has observed<br>further than the degree of fusion of a stretched<br>tone depends on the envelope of the tone, and is<br>greatest for an exponentially decreasing amplitude <br>which gives a 'struck' quality." [Mathews, M., and<br>Pierce, J.

Clearly, other auditory<br>mechanisms must be at work.<br>This should not be surprising: many other<br>researchers have run into a brick wall when<br>they tried to explain all ear/brain phenomena<br>on the basis of a single proposed mechanism<br>of pitch detection.<br>Elizabeth Cohen found similarly mixed results,<br>and raised even further doubts about the purported<br>"uselessness" of inharmonic tones for harmony<br>in her series of experiments.<br>For one thing, Cohen notes that "Throughout <br>history musical isntrument ave included not <br>only sources with integral multiple partials<br>but also thouse sources with inharmonic partials.<br>Examples of the latter are stiff strings, bars,<br>and bells. (..) We already possess convincing <br>musical examples illustrating that sources with<br>inharmonic partials have musical potential<br>outside the confines of western harmony. The<br>musical legacy of the Balinese gamelan is an<br>outstanding example. In addition, recent<br>compositions such as Inharmonique (Jean Claude<br>Risset) and Stria (John Chowning) have<br>demonstrated that inharmonic materials can<br>render musical ideas with exquisite sensitivity<br>within a more "western" context." [COhen, E.,<br>"Some Effects of Inharmonic Partials On<br>Interval Perpcetion," Music Perception, VOl. <br>1, No. 3, Spring 1984, pp. 323-349]<br>Cohen searched for a mechanism which could<br>explain why "Inharmonic tones are not <br>conventionally part of the infra-structure<br>of western harmony, but may be used in<br>the same manner as harmonic tones <br>under certain conditions." <br>Cohen notes that a number of her test<br>subjects had no difficulty perceiving<br>harmonic progressions in inharmonic<br>tones, and perceives as "octaves" intervals<br>far from the 2:1..."Subject GWM shows no<br>desire to cling to an octave based on a<br>learned or innate preference for a physical<br>ratio of 2:1." [op. cit., pg. 337]<br>She found similar results for inharmonic<br>"fifths": "The data suggests that GWM, JWG<br>and JMS tune by matching partials."<br>Cohen concludes that "The nature of an<br>instrument having noninteger partials suggests<br>a need to develop an interval sense on something<br>other than simple integer ratios or fundamental<br>doubling.  It is suggested here that GWM relied<br>on an interval sense that was based on <br>recognizing the consonance determined by<br>coincident partials and associating this <br>sound as a particular interval."<br>Cohen further points out that "If the composer<br>fuses the sound by controlling the temporal<br>evolution of the partials, then the composer <br>can be assured that conventional relationships<br>and impressions can be made to hold. If the<br>composer wishes to exploit the inharmonicity<br>of the stretched tones, yet maintain certain<br>consonance relations, then the knowledge<br>that interaction of the partials can successfully <br>determine interval size will surely be a useful<br>tool." [op. cit., pg. 347]<br>This would appear to strike the death blow for<br>Paul Erlich's argument.<br>We are now in a position to see why earlier<br>experiments with inharmonic tones failed to<br>produce a sense of spectral fusion, and why<br>earlier experiments (pre-1970s) with<br>inharmonic tones usually exhibited a residue<br>pitch unrelated to the frequencies of the<br>partials:<br>[1] Early experiments with inharmonic tones<br>used crude analog electronic tone production<br>circuits which generated a set of unrelated<br>iharmonic partials.  Typically, FM or AM<br>was used, or digital counter circuits.<br>By contrast, the use of digital computers <br>to generate inharmonic tone-complexes in<br>the 1970s allowed researchers to generate<br>inharmonic tones all of whose partials were<br>related.  Clearly this had a profound audible<br>effect on test subjects.<br>[2] Early experiments used extremely "electronc-<br>sounding" lifeless inharmonic tones with very<br>simple amplitude envelopes.  As John Chowning<br>has pointed out (and as can be heard clearly<br>in his composition Phone), even perfectly <br>harmonic sounds often fail to fuse into<br>a single percept if the envelopes of the <br>different partials do not share a common<br>vibrato and tremolo.  The effect can be <br>vividly heard in Chowning's composition:<br>a set of partials appears from silence and<br>while harmonic, sounds like an unrelated set<br>of partials: but when each partials slowly<br>begins to exhibit common vibrato, the <br>set of "unrelated" tones gradually fuse into<br>the unified percept of a human voice.<br>The same effect was clearly at work in<br>early experiments with inharmonic tones.<br>Later experiments, like Cohen's, use<br>common amplitude and frequency<br>information "built into" the envelopes<br>of each inharmonic partial to encourage<br>the tones to audibly fuse--and experiments<br>from the 1970s onward show that such<br>inharmonic tones, so modified, do indeed fuse.<br>[3] Early experiments with inharmonic tones<br>use arbitrarily stretched partials.  Later,<br>more sophisticated experiments, (as we<br>shall see) use sets of partials which <br>exhibit the properties of an "inharmonic<br>series" of tones which are related to some<br>coherent generating method.  The ear can<br>hear this and places the inharmonic partials<br>within the inharmonic series, producing<br>a complete and convincing sense of finality<br>in inharmonic cadences.<br>As the final nail in the coffin of Terhardt's<br>apparently all-embracing theory, note the<br>article "Reivsion of Terhardt's Psychoacoustical<br>Model of the Root(s) Of a Musical Chord," R.<br>Parncutt, Music Perception, Vol. 6, No. 1, Fall <br>1988, pp. 65-94:<br>"The predictions of Terhardt's octave-<br>generalized model of the root of a musical<br>chord occasionally disagree with music theory<br>(notably, in the case of the minor triad.)"<br>Thus Terhardt's theory (like so many others<br>which purported to give 'all the answers'<br>about how the ear hears) is now crumbling,<br>and various desperate attempts are being<br>made to shore it up. <br>This tells us (as we should have known all along)<br>that the ear uses more than the virtual<br>pitch mechanism to ascertain fundamental<br>pitch of real-world musical sounds. It also<br>tells us that the operation of the ear is complex<br>and context-sensitive, and that therefore an<br>inharmonic tone progression which offers the<br>ear alternate cues can and often will be heard<br>as an inharmonic progression within a coherent<br>yet inharmonic series of timbres.<br>The second and final post in this series will<br>discuss the overwhelming evidence *against*<br>Erlich's claim, and *in favor of* the ability of even<br>the most naive listener to hear inharmonic<br>progressions of inharmonic tones as<br>exhibiting a sense of harmonic closure,<br>and a fundamental pitch related to the<br>fundamental of the inharmonic tone complex..<br>Ideas fundamental to the extension of microtonality<br>into the realm of timbre.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 16 Jul 1996 16:31 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA00444; Tue, 16 Jul 1996 07:30:58 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 16 Jul 1996 07:30:58 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.91.960716072806.7804F-100000@garcia.efn.org><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3206 href="#3206">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: Enrique Moreno's 1995 PhD thesis<br>--<br>Enrique Moreno wrote a thesis in 1995 entitled<br>"Embedding Equal Pitch Spaces and the Question<br>of Expanded Chromas: An Experimental Approach."<br>This is available as Report No. STAN-M-93 from<br>the Stanford Unviersity Music Dept., CCRMA,<br>Stanford CA 94305-8180.<br>This dissertation is one of the most interesting<br>and provocative theses about microtonality to<br>come out of Stanford.

The main difference comes<br>perhaps not so much from the intervals of the <br>tunig t hemsleves but from the *context* that<br>the whole tuning as an entity provides for every<br>interval in it.  In this sense, to attempt to classify<br>the new intervals as variations of twelve-tone-to-<br>the-octave equal intervals (or of just intervals)<br>woudl constitute perhaps a reasonable mistake.<br>"It would be reasonable because it is reasonable <br>to attempt to understand unknown things in terms<br>of the things we know, especially if there exists<br>a certain resemblance.

Imagine having to interepret<br>the signs ^b, ~#, as "not so flat" and "not so sharp",<br>or -b+++ as "quasi-flat plus three syntonic commas,"<br>or whatever.  In short, regardless that some of the<br>intervals, chords, and even chord progressions may<br>resemble certain well-known intervals, chords, and<br>chord progression,s this tuning and many others <br>(although not necessarily all) deserve a fresh <br>departure point."<br>This is the stronget and clearest statement  I have<br>yet found of one extreme of the attitude toward<br>microtonality--namely, that we should approach<br>the intervals and the tunings anew and search our<br>their properties without preconceptions.  This is<br>clearly not entirely possibe--it remains a fact<br>that the human ear/brain system has measurable<br>properties and various intervals will have predictable<br>*sensory* effects on the auditory system--but in<br>making this point Enrique gets at an extremely<br>important truth.<br>Namely, that the *sensory* affect of an interval or<br>a tuning is not all necessarily the same as the<br>*musical* affect of that interval or tuning.<br>N0orman Cazden made much the same point in<br>the article "On Sensory Consonance," Int. Journ. of<br>Aesthetics and Art Criticism, 1980, but Cazden<br>was mainly concerned with demolishing Helmhotlz's<br>influence.  Enrique's point is much farther-reaching.<br>Now, the other end of the spectrum can be seen<br>in Easley Blackwood's and Paul Rapoport's writings<br>on microtonality.  "When investigating a tuning for<br>which there is no repertoire or tradition of any kind,<br>the most illuminating approach is to look for conenctions<br>between the new tuning and 12-note equal. All the other<br>tunings contain many extremely discordant intervals,<br>and are amenable to row music, or to other non-tonal <br>compositional techniques. But hte most interesting are<br>those that include tonal elements--ie., major and minor<br>triads, and seventh chords, which may be arranged in ways<br>similar to, but not exactly like, 12-note equal." [Blackwood,<br>Easley, "Research Notes, NEH Grant RO-29376-78-0642,<br>1980, page 1]<br>Clearly this approach has a lot of problems.  For example,<br>Blackwood reveals fundamental bias when he states<br>that "major and minor triads" are his primary criteria. <br>This causes him to completely overlook the neutral mode<br>and neutral triads on tunings like 17-TET and 21-TET,<br>and as a result Blackwood makes many verifiably false<br>statements--for example, Blackwood discusses *only*<br>the major and minor triads in 17-TET.  He never discusses<br>the neutral triad, formed from a third with 5 steps of<br>70.588235 cents each. Fortunately, Paul Rapoport revises<br>this oversight--but Paul's overall approach remains<br>relentlessly Pythagorean and 12-TET-based, which is<br>simply not appropriate, say, with melodic modes in 19-TET,<br>or harmonies in 21-TET, or with 9-TET or 7-TET or 10-TET<br>or many other tuning which cannot be jammed into the 12-TET<br>mold.<br>In 17-TET, the neutral melodic mode is an important<br>resource.  Blackwood completely overlooks it.  He does<br>not discuss 8- or 9-tone melodic modes, nor does he<br>discuss pentantonic modes except in 23-TET, to his<br>credit.<br>Thus the great drawback of trying to force all equal<br>temperaments into the conceptual framework of 12-TET<br>is that it leads the composer to completely overlook <br>many useful (but highly non-twelvular) melodic and<br>harmonic resources.<br>On the other hand, Easley Blackwood's and Paul Rapoport's<br>approach to non-12 also has many advantages: by<br>identifying points of similarity with 12, it gives them<br>a place to start analyzing harmonic progressions and<br>melodic modes.<br>The great weakness of Enrique Moreno's position is that<br>he does not provide a conceptual framework for harmonic<br>progressions and melodic modes.<br>The basic idea of Enrique's thesis (to do it gross injustice<br>by boiling it down to a few words) is that non-octave<br>tunings can be characterized by the Nth root of K, where N and<br>K are integers.  In many cases, K then takes on the audible<br>characteristics of the 2:1 (octave) ratio in the twelve-tone<br>equal temperament.  Thus, Enrique contends--and has data<br>from psychoacoustic experiments to prove--that in many <br>cases the K:1 ratio exhibits many of the properties of the<br>octave 2:1 ratio in 12-tone equal temperament. The particular<br>property on which Enrique concentrates is chroma--that is,<br>the property according to which a perceived pitch remains<br>"the same" perceptually if it is displaced up or down by<br>that ratio.  Thus, in 12-TET, a C4 is heard as "the same"<br>as a C3 and a C5; similarly, in the 12th root of 3, Enrique<br>claims (and has data to demonstrate) that a pitch <br>displaced up or down by 3:1 also "sounds the same."<br>This gives a starting point for harmony in non-octave<br>scales, since inversions can now be analyzed, melodic<br>modes can be described, etc.<br>Enrique's approach seems especially praiseworthy because<br>[1] it involves psychoacoustic data, and thus has some<br>connection to the real world--unlike so much mental-<br>masturbation "modern" 12-TET music theory; [2] it has<br>the courage to leave behind 12-TET preconceptions.<br>If it seems utopian that listeners might be expected to utterly<br>abandon 12-TET conventions when listening to mirotonal<br>music, it's well to remember Heinz Werner's paper in<br>the 1940 Journal of Psychology, cited a few posts back.<br>Wener found that, given enough time to familiarize themselves<br>with a microtonal tunings, *every* listener he tested<br>was able to make the leap into hearing the new intervals<br>on their own terms.  <br>Further proof is provided by everyday experience--William<br>Schottstaedt, for example, has pointed out that after working<br>with 11-TET for an extended period, he found that 12-TET<br>sounded "strange" when he returned to it.<br>In sum, Enrique's thesis is a major contribution to microtonal<br>theory.  It also adventurously extends some of the conventional<br>notions of music theory (i.e., octave equivalence) without <br>becoming a slave to 12-TET ideas.<br>--mclaren</div><h3><a id=3215 href="#3215">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject:  Yet another overlooked (but remarkable)<br>  article on microtonality<br>--<br>The Journal of Psychology is not a place you'd <br>usually think of looking for articles about<br>xenharmonic music--especially perceptive early<br>articles which foreshadow many later developments.<br>But, as it turns out, one such article was published<br>in Vol. 10, 1940, J. Psych., pp. 149-156, author<br>Heinz Werner.<br>The title is "Musical 'Micro-Scales' and 'Micro-<br>Melodies.'"<br>In this remarkable article, Werner discusses <br>what was later to become known as categorical<br>perception (though in 1940 it did not have that<br>name).  Werner points out that "A subject, when<br>presented with a arelatively small interval of--let <br>us say--0.12 of a semitone, at first may hear a<br>very slight indefinite difference between the two<br>tones, or even no difference at all.  But when the<br>same interval is repeated a great many times with <br>the subject deliberately focussing his attention on<br>the task of discerning a clear-cut interval, there <br>will almost invariably be reported an apparent<br>enlargement of the objectively constant interval.<br>UIsual;ly there is a maximum in this subjective<br>augmentation: *the maximum is reached<br>when this small interval has acquired the subjective<br>character of a semi-tone.*  The time necessary<br>for the attainment of this maximum increase varies<br>greatly with the individual, but so far not one <br>individual has been encountered who did not hear<br>the semi-tone-like quality after more or less<br>repetition." [Werner, H., "Musical 'Micro-Scales'<br>and 'Micro-Melodies,'" J. Pych., Vol. 10, 1940,<br>pp. 149-150]<br>In this paper Werner goes on to describe a set<br>of experiments in meldoic recognition performed<br>with intervals of "less than one-sixth of a <br>normal semi-tone (16.5 cents)."<br>Werner foudn a number of fascinating effects: <br>one which he called "the law of increasing <br>stabilization" mandated athat "if the subject should<br>be presented with an ascending-descending interval, <br>he will at first perceive the ascending phase as<br>subjectively larger than the one which descends."<br>Werner also found audible apradoxes--for example,<br>because the melodic patterns used tended to <br>acquire a gestalt quality of their own as well<br>as the effect caused by the pitch of the individual<br>notes "this leads to a paradoxical statement<br>frequently made by the [subjects] that even though<br>Tones 1 and 2 remain constant in character, <br>nevertheless the interval separating these tones <br>may audibly vary in size.  All this seems to prove<br>that it is not the position of the tones which is of<br>primary important and which creates the quality of<br>the interval. It would seem that it is the quality of <br>the interval which determines the position of the<br>tones in the micro-system." <br>Yet another fascinating effect was observed when <br>Werner played the ubjects a straight chromatic <br>cmirotonal scale versus a melody: "When the scale <br>such was given chromatically, i.e., step by step, <br>none of these subjects, providing that there were<br>completely ' in the system,' found any distinction<br>between te micro-scale and the normal piano scale. <br>Indivudal differences came to the fore when the<br>micro-melodies were compared to patterns of the<br>normal scale. Two of the subjects felt sure<br>that no difference existed.  One observed expressed <br>the feeling that it was as if she were sitting in a<br>puppet theater. 'If one keeps on looking at the puppets,<br>after a while they acquire the full siz eof human<br>beings!' The other two subjects felt a certain <br>difference." <br>This is a fascinating and to my knowledge one of the<br>only *subjective* records of naive observers' <br>reactionsn to microtonal melodies.  (By "naive" I<br>mean test subjects who weren't committed<br>microtonalists). <br>Moreover, Werner found that microtonal melodies<br>were perceived with considerable consistency<br>by the subjects, once they'd become used to hearing<br>them.  Observers could make reliable judgments<br>about whether two halves of micro-melody "fit"<br>together, or whether a melody formed an<br>antepenultimate closure leading to a cadence,<br>or whether the melody was perceived as<br>"empty" or not because it used primarily<br>members of the harmonic series.<br>Carol Krumhansl has done a great deal of work<br>with the "probe tone" method of studying<br>melodic perception.  Comparing her work to<br>Heinz Werner's, however, it seems to me that<br>Krumhansl's assumptions are crucially flawed.<br>For one thing, she assumed that when an observer<br>hears a 12-TET melody with one note missing<br>and then a series of notes off by  various twelfths<br>of a semitone, the observer willr eact according<br>to an innate sense of "tonality," rather than <br>according ot how s/he has been programmed by<br>a lifetime of listening to 12-TET.  <br>Second, Krumhansl assumes implicitly that no<br>systematic distinction can be made by test<br>subjects between one "mistuned" (tuned off<br>the target 12-TET note by some number of<br>twelfths of a semitone) note and another.<br>But Heinz Werner's article proves this is<br>clearly not so--and our own experience <br>indicates very clearly that observers can <br>easily be trained to hear intervals as small<br>(in my case, anyway_ as 1/100 of an octave.<br>In fact Jonathan Glasier reliably tuned Pep<br>Estavane's Harmonry Harp by ear to 1/100<br>of an octave intervals per string: he had no<br>trouble hearing a distinct difference twixt<br>adjacent tones, and he was reliably able<br>to detect which strings approximated members<br>of the harmonic series and which did not.<br>Third, Krumhansl seems to assume that <br>observers cannot tell whether the probe tone<br>is bouncing around between different circles<br>of fifths (each 1/12 of a semitone or 1/72<br>of an octave belongs to *different* circle<br>of fifths--and there are *six* different and<br>entirely incompatible circles of fifths in the<br>72-tone equal-tempered scale).<br>But my own experience indicates that this<br>assumption is probably untrue--and Werner's <br>evidence supports this contention strongly.<br>If Werner's subjects were able to hear <br>difrferences in the implied harmonies of<br>one 36-TET scale versus another, would <br>not Krumhansl's test subjects have made<br>similar judgments about one 72-TET scale<br>step versus another?<br>In short, Heinz Werner's article seems to me<br>a model of its kind.  It is amazing that this<br>article has almost never been cited in the<br>microtonal literature.  It blazes many new<br>trails and foreshadows quite a few later<br>developments.  In particular, Werner's <br>briliant idea of giving test subjects *months*<br>the get used to hearing micro-melodies <br>completely revolutionized test procedures<br>for microtonal melodies.<br>It is in fact shocking that psychoacoutic<br>and music psychology experiments continue<br>to be done today using micro-meldoies, but<br>*without* giving the subjects adequate time<br>to overcome the inevitable effects of <br>categorical perception which are known to<br>apply to any naive listener who hears an<br>entirely different tuning for the first time.<br>Heinz Werner's paper did not seem to garner<br>any attention...it appears to have dropped<br>into the sea of psychological literature and<br>vanished.<br>Yet it would fascinating to follow up on<br>Werner's experiments today, using modern<br>equipment, and do a second series of<br>experiments pushing further along the<br>lines Werner laid out. In paritcular it<br>would extremely interesting to compare<br>subject reactions to micro-harmonies<br>a well as micro-melodies, after a suitable<br>period of acclimitization by the <br>listeners.<br>This is a truly remarkable paper, and one <br>which every microtonalist would do well<br>to study.<br>Incidentally, there is one other paper by<br>Heinz Werner I've been able to track down--<br>"Uber Mikromeloik und Mikroharmonik," in<br>Zeitschrift f"ur Psychologie, 1926, pp. <br>74-128.  This probably explains the depth<br>and breadth of Werner's later paper.  Clearly<br>he cut his teeth on microtonality in the <br>European quartertone movement of the 20s,<br>then came to America as a refugee before<br>or during WW II.<br>It's a shame he never published anything else,<br>so far as I can tell.

The problem with this approach <br>is that it does not guarantee that the approximating<br>intervals are consistent with one another." -- Paul Erlich<br>This is an excellent point, and it's not clear that anyone<br>else has made it so cogently.  In fact this could serve<br>as the basis of a fascinating article, were any of the<br>12-TET-obsessed music theory journals interested in<br>publishing such an article. (You never know.  Sometimes<br>they relent.)  <br>The earliest reference to an idea similar to this one <br>appears to be found in Mersenne's Harmonicorum Libri... <br>(1636), pp. 126-127 (last pagination of 2nd ed., 1648).<br>Mersenne defines each interval as equal to a certain<br>number of commas, and some of the commas are <br>incompatible with one another.  <br>This is in the same ballpark as, but clearly not identical<br>to,  Erlich's insight.<br>--<br>Gary Morrison's conceptual difficulties in working with<br>multiple simultaneous tunings are probably what<br>Ivor Darreg used to call a "pseudo-problem."  In other<br>words, something that conceptually seems like<br>an unimaginably difficult issue but which, in real<br>life, turns out to be largely irrelevant or trivial.<br>(Playing 19-TET or 22-TET on a 7-white-5-black<br>keyboard is such a "pseudo-problem." In both cases,<br>the answer is to use open-voiced chord with third<br>and root played by the left hand, fifth by the right<br>hand.  Simple.  Trivial.  What's the problem?)<br>In combining 12-TET and 19-TET, for instance,<br>we in the Southern California Microtonal Group<br>have found it useful to view 19-TET as a gapped<br>nondiatonic  scale with some very xenharmonic<br>ornamental tones.<br>As I've pointed out before (and as Paul Erlich's<br>experiments with his roomate demonstrate), listeners<br>hear the whole-tone portion of a 19-TET diatonic<br>scale as very reasonable and familiar-sounding, but<br>the 2/19 of on octave "semitones" (a misnomer, since<br>this term presupposes that whole tones are <br>divided into 2 parts whereas in 19-TET they are<br>divided into 3 parts)  always make folks squirm.<br>They sound...weird. "Out-of-tune" is the typical<br>description.<br>The solution, in my experience, is to fracture the<br>mislabelled "semitone" intervals in the 19-TET<br>approximation of the 12-TET diatonic scale into<br>1/19s of a tone.  Thus a typical melody in 19-TET<br>will proceed by whole steps which sound very<br>reaonable in combination with 12-TET.  Then<br>a constellation of 1/19-octave steps are used<br>to bridge the gap twixt the next "island" of<br>whole steps in the 19-TET approximation of<br>the diatonic scale.<br>This seems to work reasonably well *provided*<br>that 12-TET semitones and 19-TET 1/19s of<br>an octave don't play simultaneously.  If, instead,<br>these intervals "trade off" between different<br>players (the way good jazz players will trade<br>off playing flatted blues thirds), the 12 + 19<br>combo seems to work well.<br>Another trick that seems to work is to play<br>melodies full of familiar 12-like intervals<br>in 19-TET, but to go above or below the last<br>note of the melody by 1/19 of an octave.<br>This works well, by the way, for many <br>incommensurable ETs: 15 and 12, 14 & 17,<br>15 & 17, 19 & 22, etc.<br>Many ETs are, however, commensurable--<br>that is, one forms a subset of the other,<br>or both form gapped subsets of a much<br>higher division of the octave.<br>When combining 5-TET and 7-TET, for<br>instance, it is often useful to throw<br>in 35-TET chromatic passages.  This<br>emphasizes that the tiny intervals<br>heard between 5-TET and 7-TET pitches<br>that happen to occur vertically are not <br>accidental, but part of the coherent<br>35-TET scale.<br>The issue of combining non-just non-<br>equal-tempered scales with xen ETs,<br>or combining, say, all 3 different <br>classes of tuning simultaneously,<br>is more complex.

The hard<br>cold fact is that you can either mix<br>for headphones, or for speakers--but<br>you can't mix for both. A mix that<br>sounds best when heard over headphones<br>is likely to sound indistinct, with<br>an exaggerated sound stage when heard<br>over speakers.  Contrariwise, a mix<br>that sounds best when heard over<br>speakers will seem too dry and too<br>sharp-edged when heard over headphones.<br>Alas, there is no way around this<br>dilemma. You cannot mix so that the<br>recorded sound is optimal on *both*<br>headphones and speakers. <br>Unfortunately, even the most expensive<br>audiophile speakers sound utterly<br>completely 100% totally different from <br>headphones. There is no sonic comparison<br>whatever. This becomes especially clear<br>when you make binaural recordings using<br>mikes placed about as far apart as the<br>ears on a human head. A 2-mike binaural<br>recording will sound truly startling<br>in its realism when heard<br>over headphones, but it will sound<br>disastrously weird when you hear it<br>through a pair of speakers.<br>Headphones isolate one ear from the other;<br>speakers blend the output of both channels<br>in the air and throughout all reflecting<br>surfaces in the room. <br>The result?  Speakers usually tolerate far<br>less reverb in the mix. A subtle touch of<br>BBE or Aphex aural enhancement will also<br>greatly help the clarity of a mix<br>heard through speakers. Even drastic <br>processing like the Carver sonic holography<br>process will sound acceptable. But the same<br>"enhancements" will produce an unpleasant<br>in-your-face edginess and dryness when heard <br>over headphones.<br>Thus, you must decide which source you're<br>mixing for *before* you starting mastering<br>your CD or cassette.  Moreover, you must<br>stick with that decision. Nothing sounds<br>worse than one track of a CD optimized<br>for listening over speakers and another<br>optimized for listening over headphones.<br>--<br>The next issue is dynamic range. Headphones<br>take maximum advantage of a recording with<br>a large dynamic range, while speakers<br>cruelly punish a recording with vast dynamic<br>range. Over speakers, much of a xenharmonic<br>composition like William Schottstaedt's<br>"Water Music" is either inaudible or<br>ear-shattering...yet the same composition<br>becomes clearly audible when heard<br>over headphones.<br>A recording with large dynamic range pretty<br>much demands headphone listening (The<br>alternative is a whisper-quiet listening<br>environment with ultra-high-quality loudspeakers<br>in a place where the neighbors won't protest<br>jet-plane-takeoff sound levels. Very few<br>listeners have such a loudspeaker environment<br>available.).<br>Thus, wide dynamic-range xenharmonic recordings <br>intended to be heard over loudspeakers must,<br>as a practical matter, employ some compression.<br>Unfortunately, compression always changes the<br>sound of a composition. This is especially<br>noticeable in commercial pop music, where<br>the maximum dynamic range is about 5 dB.<br>In such recordings, changes in timbre take<br>the place of changes in loudness, and this<br>may require corresponding changes in <br>you orchestration of a piece of music with<br>a very wide dynamic range.<br>One salient point about compression:<br>it must be applied without regard for the<br>settings of the equipment, but with <br>concern only for whether the final result<br>approximates the original sound of the<br>live recording. My experience is that <br>drastic alterations are often required<br>to get a recording to sond like a live<br>performance.  Often, radical compression,<br>sonic enhancement, dynamic noise reduction<br>and gain riding are needed to produce a<br>recording which when heard over loudspeakers<br>approximates what you heard in live<br>performance.  Alas, loudspeakers are wildly<br>non-linear transducers whose measured response<br>curves bear no relation whatsoever to the<br>sound you hear.  (The reason is simple: graphs<br>of loudspeaker response vs. frequency give<br>data *only* on the magnitude of the frequency<br>response, *never* on phase response at that<br>frequency, and as Fourier's theorem tells us,<br>both magnitude *and* phase data are required<br>for a full reconstruction of the original <br>signal. Equally important, loudspeaker response<br>is measured in an anechoic chamber using a<br>microphone which stays in a fixed position <br>relative to the loudspeaker. In a real listening<br>situation, each listener will hear the loudspeaker<br>from a different position and in a different<br>sound-absorbing and sound-reflecting environment.<br>Thus, the graphs typically published in hi-fi<br>magazines are meaningless as an index of the<br>actual sound of a pair of loudspeakers. These<br>graphs are as ludicrous as a graph of the<br>reflectivity of 450 nm light from Rembrandt's<br>"The Night Watch" from a photomoter fixed 5<br>cm from the painting's surface as an indication <br>of the overall "look" of the entire painting.)<br>Each loudspeaker type (acoustic reflex,<br>ribbon, horn, electrostatic, etc.) and<br>each placement and each listening position<br>and set of amplifiers, recorders and preamps<br>produces a different overall "sound." <br>Using a vacuum tube amplifier as opposed to<br>a solid state amp will significantly change<br>the sound of a reproduced recording--changing the<br>loudspeakers from, say, Klipsch horns to <br>Magnaplanar IIIDs will transform the sound of<br>the recording to an almost unrecognizable<br>extent.<br>This brings up the issue of boom boxes. <br>Although it seems wildly insane, it remains<br>a fact that most of your prosepctive audience<br>will listen to the output of 50,000 dollar<br>computer music workstations or tens of thousands<br>of dollars of handcrafted xenharmonic instruments<br>or a roomful of microtonal synthesizers over 40 dollar<br>boom boxes. This is a development so weird<br>as to border on the psychotic, yet it<br>remains unquestionably true. Because of<br>the rush-rush-rush nature of our society,<br>most people listen to xenharmonic music<br>either on a boom box or in their car.<br>The best way to mix for this kind of<br>peculiar playback situation is on a<br>set of satellite loudspeakers with small<br>cheap tweeters and the subwoofer EQ'd<br>nearly off. This reproduces the extremely<br>poor frequency response and dynamic range<br>of the average boom box/car stereo.<br>A piece of microtonal music mixed for<br>boom box or car stereo playback must be<br>compressed to about 20 dB dynamic range.<br>Notice that this is not "20 dB of reduction<br>in dynamic range," I mean that the entire<br>range of the composition must be compressed<br>to fit within the 20 dB of useful dynamic<br>range available on the average cassette<br>deck. This means that if you start with<br>a composition which uses a dynamic range<br>of 96 dB in 16-bit linear DAT format, you<br>will have to compress the output of the<br>DAT recording by at least 76 dB since<br>(as we all know) most cassette decks<br>produce garbage output if the recording<br>level falls below -20 dB. Typical compressors<br>useful for most musical material include <br>the dbx 163x series.<br>This kind of bizarrely extreme 76 dB<br>compression will produce a large number of<br>unfortunate artifacts which cannot, alas,<br>be avoided.  The alternative is to refuse<br>to mix for cassette deck playback, which<br>means that your recording will (to most<br>people, whose hearing has been destroyed<br>by excessive volume levels and who seem<br>perfectly happy with the exercrable <br>sound reproduction afforded by a boom<br>box/car stereo) sound too reverberant,<br>indistinct or "muddy," and inaudible<br>throughout much of its length.<br>--<br>The next issue to bear in mind when <br>recording xenharmonic music is that<br>computer music requires an entirely<br>different mixing technique than <br>live music. Computer music typically<br>uses sine waves or other kinds<br>of synthetic tones that cut through <br>a listener's head like a knife;<br>typical recording levels for a<br>xenharmonic piece of computer music<br>should be at least 20 dB lower than<br>for live music. This is a classic<br>case of the Fletcher-Munson curve<br>at work, and when mixing computer<br>music you should always ignore<br>the meter levels.  Instead, play<br>back a live piece periodically<br>to get a general loudness comparison<br>and set the levels with complete<br>disregard for the meter readings.<br>--<br>Lastly, there remains the issue of Dolby<br>encoding. As Dolby Labs has admitted,<br>the Dolby decoding circuits of most<br>cassette decks are badly miscalibrated<br>at the factory, or simply left uncalibrated<br>entirely. If you doubt this, ask yourself:<br>when was the last time you saw an audio<br>techician or a sound man with a Dolby B<br>calibration tape?<br>Try: "never."<br>As a result, the poorly calibrated Dolby B<br>decoding circuits in most cassette decks<br>turn Dolby encoded recordings into mush.<br>When poorly adjusted, Dolby B acts as a<br>drastic low-pass filter.  And since<br>virtually all cassette decks use <br>uncalibrated or misadjusted Dolby B<br>encoding/decoding circuitry, this means<br>that the best solution is always to<br>*AVOID* Dolby encoding.<br>Dolby C works well if the same cassette<br>deck is used to play back the tape as<br>was used for recording. Otherwise,<br>Dolby C produces wretched artifacts.<br>In effect Dolby C is so cassette-deck-<br>specific as to prove useless in the real<br>world.  <br>Dolby Spectral encoding is an excellent<br>method of noise reduction which, alas,<br>is featured on almost no casette decks<br>because the fools at Dolby Labs overpriced<br>the technology outrageously on its <br>introduction. When DAT arrived, it proved<br>far cheaper than adding Dolby S to existing<br>30 ips reel machines, and so Dolby S never<br>caught on. Yet another example of "how<br>not to introduce new technology."<br>--<br>Because Dolby encoding (even when adjusted<br>with a factory-authorized calibration tape)<br>inevitably produces many unacceptable <br>artifacts in the source material during<br>playback, some hiss will be evident in all<br>your recordings (since any sane person will<br>avoid Dolby encoding like the plague). This<br>means that it's vital to push the levels<br>of the recording as high as they'll go during <br>cassette dubbing so as to minimize noise<br>during playback.<br>In my experience, the most important element<br>in a cassette dubbing chain is the source<br>quality--preferably DAT--and after that, the <br>cassette deck. This means that you will get far<br>more bang out of your bucks by spending them<br>on a good cassette deck than on a ton of<br>signal enhancement gear.<br>It remains a fact, alas, that Nakamichi still<br>makes the best cassette decks around. Avoid<br>the high-end Nakamichi decks and buy the<br>cheapest new model available. The high-end<br>Nakamichi cassette decks do such a freakishly<br>good job of reproducing the execrable audio<br>signal on the crappy cassette format that a <br>Nakamichi Dragon (for example) will delude<br>you into EQ'ing the high end of your recording<br>down much lower than it should be.<br>The best way to test your recording is to<br>make the copy on a Nakamichi deck and play it<br>back on a crappy K-Mart boom box, since this <br>is the way virtually everyone will listen to<br>your recordings.  Such grotesquely poor<br>quality playback will quickly bring to light<br>any EQ or reverb problems with the master<br>recording--generally you'll have to EQ<br>the high end up or add considerable amounts<br>of BBE or Aphex enhancement to make up for<br>the fact that the average boom box has<br>less bandwidth that a typical telephone.<br>The analog compact cassette might not be<br>the world's lowest-fidelity recording<br>medium; it's possible that Edison wax<br>cylinder recordings sounded worse. However,<br>this question remains open. It is possible<br>that the analog copmact cassette does actually<br>the worst possible audio fidelity of any<br>recording medium ever invented.<br>Regardless of the outcome of that issue,<br>it remains an obscene and outrageous fact<br>that we will reach the 21st century with<br>most people listening to microtonal music<br>on ultra-lo-fi analog audio cassettes<br>with lots of hiss, plenty of wow and<br>flutter, and enormous amount of distortion.<br>Thus it behooves us all to produce the best<br>possible cassette recordings of microtonal music...<br>a task akin to producing the best possible<br>buggy whips we can make.

In most US states anyway, they are paid by enrollment, so they are always<br>    scrounging for ways to keep students' interest rather than to weed them <br>    out.<br>2.  They have somewhat less pressure to provide specific knowledge to feed into<br>    Junior- and Senior-level courses.  <br>3.  A fair percentage of their student body consists somewhat older adults who<br>    are taking music (or whatever) courses simply because they want to, rather <br>    than to begrudgingly fill some required slot in the curriculum.  <br>4.  Most community colleges have fewer distractions (football for one, but <br>    let's not get into that!).  <br>5.  Since they lack the tenure system, they're a little more open to hiring <br>    innovative instructors.  <br><br>   Of course, they have disadvantages as well, especially the overall quality of<br>student (and instructor to a fair degree) they attract.  Some are quite good<br>though, my bassoon teacher back in high school was one.  <br><br>   Well, it's something to bear in mind anyway.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 6 Jun 1996 18:18 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA06916; Thu, 6 Jun 1996 09:18:36 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 6 Jun 1996 09:18:36 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.960606120714.22066H-100000@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3022 href="#3022">ðŸ”—</a>eig@ccrma.stanford.edu (Enrique Moreno)</h3><span>6/7/1996 2:54:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I am under the impression that the main reason for our usual higher-education music curricula to devote 4 semesters to  <br>tonal harmony is the bulk of the greatest music ever composed can be described in terms of tonal functions or modal relations.  <br>This attitude is the natural consequence of a causal relationship where the great works are first and the theoretical interest  <br>afterwards.<br>	It would seem equally natural, then, that there is no interest for a generalized practice of educating music students in  <br>the *how-to*s of some "exotic" intonation systems for which there is no significant corpus of real masterpieces.

First, I don't believe that "the<br>bulk of the greatest music ever composed" lies within the last 300 years or<br>so of Western European culture. When the world's music is viewed as a<br>whole, certainly ideas such as tonal harmony, 12TET, and counterpoint are<br>the "exotic" concepts.

I teach them because they are a fundamental part of all<br>pitch-based music.

What is the meaning of the title The Well-Tempered Clavier? Why<br>does a string quartet suddenly have to adjust in a common-tone modulation<br>to some foreign keys?

Four examples <br>will be given.<br>"First, length was assumed until recently to<br>be an important factor in both the `memorable-ness'<br>and the `tonal-ness' of tunes; longer tunes carried<br>more information than short ones.  This has been<br>shown to be a false assumption."  <br>You'd think this was obvious.  Yet it seems to have<br>come as a revelation to music cognition researchers.<br>C'mon, guys!  Obviously Mozart's 41st symphony 1st<br>movement theme, while *long*, is *easy* to remember,<br>whereas the much *shorter* theme of the first <br>movement of Webern's symphony is obviously vastly<br>*harder* to remember.  Has anyone heard of the words<br>"implied harmonic cues" and "tonal landmarks"?<br>Jeez.  <br>"Second, so called `tonal' tunes have thus far for<br>the most part been defined simply as those <br>consisting of pitches drawn from some major-<br>mode diatonic collection, whereas `atonal' tunes<br>are obtained by drawing random pitches from the<br>12-tone chromatic collection.  The notions that<br>tunes could be diatonic but only weakly tonal<br>or chromatic but also tonal have only begun to<br>be articulated and refined."<br>Yow.<br>You'd think this  would be obvious.  <br>Listening--that's the key, folks.  Ya gotta *listen* to those<br>psychoacoustic test melodies before you use 'em...<br>"Third, in music the relationship between frequency<br>(pitch) distance and function distance is a <br>complex one..."  Again, a very clearly obvious<br>point--pitches a 12-TET semitone apart represent<br>opposing harmonies even though the notes are<br>melodically close, while pitches 7 12-TET semitones<br>apart represent harmonies close together even<br>though the notes are melodically distant.<br>Duh.<br>Yet researchers are only now catching onto this...?<br>"Fourth, tunes in the psychological literature,<br>whether tonal or atonal, are still all too often<br>characterized as sequences of signed note-to-note<br>intervals.  Few notions of melodic structure <br>(certainly none based on a well-founded theory<br>of implicit harmonic structure) have emerged."<br>[Hantz, E., "Studies in Musical Cognition: Comments<br>from a Music Theorist," Music Perception, Winter<br>1984, 2(2), pp. 245-264.]<br>These objections seem to explain very clearly why<br>much of the current psychoacoustic and psychological<br>and music cognition research in microtonality has<br>failed so miserably to produce results as revelatory or<br>enlightening as simply LISTENING TO NON-12 MUSIC.  <br>In study after study, otherwise reliable reserachers<br>like Carol Krumhansl come to obviously wacky <br>conclusions about such tunings as 48-TET, 19-TET,<br>36-TET, etc.<br>The reason for these obviously wrong concusions is<br>that the researchers assume [1] that melodies in<br>other tunings must exhibit the same melodic <br>structure as 12-TET; and [2] melodies in other<br>tunings msut exhibit the same implied harmonic<br>structure as 12-TET, with identical modes,<br>etc. etc.<br>Ivor Darreg pointed out long ago, as did Easley<br>Blackwood, that other tunings often turn the<br>rules of western harmony *upside-down.* Some<br>tunings require that major thirds be treated as<br>unstable dissonances which resolve DOWN until<br>major seconds (17-TET) or UP into perfect<br>fourths (Pythagorean ji).  Some tunings require<br>that the fifth be treated as a dissonance (13-TET,<br>18-TET, 23-TET, many of Erv Wilson's higher-order CPSs),<br>while other tunings require that the fifth be treated<br>as a consonance (22-TET, standard-limit ji arrays).<br>In some tunings root progression by fifths produce<br>the most powerful and convincing cadences (19-TET,<br>7-limit ji) while in other tunings root progressions<br>by other intervals produce the most powerful and<br>convincing cadences (some of Erv Wilson's higher-<br>level CPSs, 15-TET,  varius non-just non-equal<br>tunings like the metal tube scale or the free-free<br>metal bar scale).<br>This explains why Krumhansl and other respected<br>researchers keep "discovering" that 12-TET is "the<br>best tuning" for melodies.   When you measure everything<br>by a 12-TET yardstick, 12 looks best.<br>You'd think that none of this would be controversial<br>or astonishing, yet these ideas seem to wallop<br>the psychoacoustics community with the force of<br>divine revelation.  These folks are only now<br>slowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwly awakening<br>to the idea that you can't usefully measure non-12<br>melodic or harmonic properties according to 12-TET<br>melodic and harmonic standards.<br>Wow.<br>What a surprise, eh?<br>Incidentally, these same considerations explain why<br>Markov-chain analysis produces junk when you use it<br>to analyze a piece of music and then compose an<br>algorithmic piece.  Markov chains are blind to the<br>the melodic contour, the implied harmonies, the<br>sense of balance and unbalance, of parry and riposte<br>in a melody.

"Translated from the Italian<br>with an introduction by Barclay Brown." Pendragon<br>press, New York, 1986, Monographs in Music No. 6.<br>This book is a collection of short essays written<br>by the Italian futurist Russolo.<br>Creator of the orchestra of noise-makers known<br>as intonarumori, Russolo is one of the founts<br>from which springs modern music.<br>(Great names for the instruments: "Sobbers," "wailers,"<br>"shriekers."  Sort of like the New Yorker music critic<br>at one of Johnny Reinhard's concepts.)<br>It is less well known that Russolo was a radical and<br>persistant microtonalist.<br>In the paper entitled "The Conquest of Enharmonicism,"<br>Russolo sets forth explicitly his dissatisfaction with<br>12-TET and his militant advocacy of UNtempered<br>harmonic series-based tunings.<br>"After the introduction of the tempered system<br>in music, only the word Enharmonicism remained<br>to indicate the values that no longer found corres-<br>pondence in musical reality. Indeed, the difference<br>between an E sharp and an F, and a B sharp and a C<br>are called enharmonic, while the tempered system,<br>in rendering the semitones equal, has removed this<br>difference and made the two notes into the same<br>sound.<br>"But unfortunately, the inconvenient result of the<br>tempered system does not lie only in the word.<br>Once that the octave was divided into only *twelve*<br>*equal* fractions and applied in the tempred scale,<br>there resulted a considerable limitation of the number<br>of practical sounds and a strange artificiality in <br>those that were adopted.  The difference between<br>the scale of the tempered system and hte natural<br>one are well known. (..) With wind instruments,<br>which produce the harmonic series of the fundamental<br>note, the 7th, 11th, 13th and 14th harmonics are<br>likewise corrected in their intonation to produce what<br>we call closed sounds.<br>"In the tempered system, therefore, the difference <br>between the large and small whole tone (9/8:10/9 = 81/80)<br>has disapperaed.  Similarly, the differences between the <br>diatonic semitone (16/15) and the chromatic ones (23/22<br>and 25/24) has also vanished. (..)<br>"A tempered harmonic system can be compared in a sense<br>to a system of painting that abolishes all the infinite<br>gradations of the seven colors (red, orange, yellow, green,<br>blue, indigo and violet) and accepts only  their type of<br>color, having only one yellow, one green and so on."<br>This is a remarkable passage.  It almost exactly<br>parallels several passages from Harry Partch.  In<br>"A Quarter-Saw Section of Motivations and Intonations,"<br>Partch talks in almost exactly the same way about <br>a rainbow of colors being collapsed down into dull<br>simplistic hues.<br>Moreover, it's clear that Russolo knew very well the<br>intricacies and advantages of just intonation, and that<br>he thought the so-called natural (read: harmonic series-<br>based) tuning superior to the tempered one.<br>It's interesting that when this debate between harmonic-<br>series-based and expanded equal-temperament (viz.,<br>48-TET, 41-TET, 72-TET, etc.) occurred in Russia between<br>1917-1928, the Russian expanded equal-temperament<br>faction won out.  But when this debate occurred in Italy<br>between 1917-1928, the Italian futurists made the<br>fascinating choice of chucking tonality entirely in<br>favor of noise.  During the same period in Germany,<br>Schoenberg resolved the debate by chucking tonality<br>in favor of an elaborate scheme of statistically <br>distributing the familiar 5-limit equal-tempered<br>12 pitches.  In Mexico, Novaro and Carrillo resolved<br>this debate by choosing the Russian option but using<br>live acoustic instead of electronic instruments.<br>Thus the claim that "Schoenberg solved the dilemma<br>of the exhaustion of tonality" is untrue, insofar as<br>MANY solutions were implemented in various different<br>countries.  The only solutions which survive to this<br>day are the Russian one (represented today by folks<br>who compose & perform microtonal music on synthesizers)<br>and the Mexican one (represented today by folks who<br>compose & perform microtonal music on acoustic<br>instruments.)<br>Needless to say, the German "solution" to the exhaustion of <br>12-TET tonality didn't last beyond 1978, and post-Webern <br>serial composition is now a dead art form with no attraction <br>for contemporary composers.<br>Clearly, someone should do a 1/1 article on Russolo<br>& his advocacy of ji as an Italian solution to this problem.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 9 Jun 1996 07:00 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA27039; Sat, 8 Jun 1996 22:00:05 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 8 Jun 1996 22:00:05 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199606090458.WAA07938@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3048 href="#3048">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/1996 12:02:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: construction of a 19-tone m'bira<br>--<br>The Sonic Arts Gallery is constantly boiling with<br>new ideas and plans for new instruments, so it<br>came as no surprise when Jonathan Glasier began<br>work on a 19-tone m'bira.<br>Patterend after Bill Wesley's "array m'bira," this<br>instrument is to an african thumb piano as a 747<br>is to the Wright brothers' biplane.<br>Bill Wesley's "array" arrangement of tines places<br>consonant intervals closest to one another, while<br>putting dissonant intervals far apart.

But all these studies tend to focus of melodic rather than harmonic <br>intervals, or else tones with weak harmonics. The fact that "stretched" <br>intervals are preferred to just intervals in a context where beating between <br>partials is not the most prominent determinant of consonance may indicate <br>that Terhardt's hypothesis about a "stretched" harmonic template is correct. <br>The ear, when presented with a multiplicity of pure tone components (in <br>Parncutt's version, the prenatal ear hearing the mother's voice), is known <br>to slightly stretch the intervals between them, and one hypothesis is that <br>this stretching is "expected" even when a meager stimulus is presented. <br>Goldstein studied the precision with which frequency information is <br>transmitted by the brain's central pitch processor by measuring residue <br>("virtual") pitches produced by two pure tones, but I think his approach <br>assumed symmetrical errors and did not pay attention to systematic biases in <br>the allowable mistuning of the pure tones. I wonder if such a study would <br>reveal that judgments of harmonic relationships are easier to make when the <br>distances are stretched somewhat. In any case, it may be a case of the <br>archers aiming for the bullsye, but a steady wind blowing the arrows off <br>course. The aesthetic of stretched intervals must be somewhat compromised in <br>practice: phenomena such as second-order beating and combination tones can <br>be disturbing for significant departures from harmonicity.<br><br>The "small integers" concept of consonance that McLaren "disproves" is a <br>rather extreme, Partchian version. Which is more consonant, 300001/200000, <br>or 11/9? While the former clearly involves larger integers, it is also very <br>close to 3/2, and is likely to be heard as such. He also extends the small <br>number theory to chords of more than two notes, where the use of frequencies <br>vs. periods can determine which chord is calculated to be more consonant. <br>Observe:<br><br>Frequencies:<br><br>Major - 4:5:6<br>Minor - 10:12:15<br>Suspended - 6:8:9<br><br>Periods:<br><br>Major - 10:12:15<br>Minor - 4:5:6<br>Suspended - 6:8:9<br><br>Using either frequencies or periods, the suspended triad comes out in <br>between major and minor; the fact that the suspended triad is more dissonant <br>is related to the fact that when the intervals are looked at individually, <br>it requires higher numbers. Moreover, McLaren seems to love neutral thirds <br>and hate tritones; I have to strongly disagree with his consonance judgments <br>here. But consonance is a very subjective judgment, and the art of <br>composition can be just as effective (or more so) when based on flawed or <br>subjective premises. . . .<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 21 Jun 1996 22:18 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id NAA16477; Fri, 21 Jun 1996 13:18:33 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 21 Jun 1996 13:18:33 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960621131145.6208B-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3103 href="#3103">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/22/1996 11:24:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: Neil Haverstick's evaluation of Partch as<br> a composer<br>---<br>Neil Haverstick is one of the most talented guitarists<br>I've had the pleasure to hear.

Whether you want to call him "great"<br>probably depends on the judgement of future <br>generations...but in my opinion it's safe to say that if<br>*any* of the composers of the 20th century should be<br>called "great," Partch certainly should.<br>"Daphne of the Dunes" sends shivers down my spine.

Remember that Partch composed "Petals" so that<br>some of the duets overlapped into quartets...doing this with<br>a string quartet or a wind quintet is challenging enough, but<br>to do it *by yourself* using *only two tape recorders* in a JI<br>tuning which no one else had ever heard before, and to make<br>it work musically...well, this is an achievement that leaves<br>me speechless.<br>Partch was obviously a genius.

The problem with this approach <br>is that it does not guarantee that the approximating<br>intervals are consistent with one another." -- Paul Erlich<br>This is an excellent point, and it's not clear that anyone<br>else has made it so cogently.  In fact this could serve<br>as the basis of a fascinating article, were any of the<br>12-TET-obsessed music theory journals interested in<br>publishing such an article. (You never know.  Sometimes<br>they relent.)  <br>The earliest reference to an idea similar to this one <br>appears to be found in Mersenne's Harmonicorum Libri... <br>(1636), pp. 126-127 (last pagination of 2nd ed., 1648).<br>Mersenne defines each interval as equal to a certain<br>number of commas, and some of the commas are <br>incompatible with one another.  <br>This is in the same ballpark as, but clearly not identical<br>to,  Erlich's insight.<br>--<br>Gary Morrison's conceptual difficulties in working with<br>multiple simultaneous tunings are probably what<br>Ivor Darreg used to call a "pseudo-problem."  In other<br>words, something that conceptually seems like<br>an unimaginably difficult issue but which, in real<br>life, turns out to be largely irrelevant or trivial.<br>(Playing 19-TET or 22-TET on a 7-white-5-black<br>keyboard is such a "pseudo-problem." In both cases,<br>the answer is to use open-voiced chord with third<br>and root played by the left hand, fifth by the right<br>hand.  Simple.  Trivial.  What's the problem?)<br>In combining 12-TET and 19-TET, for instance,<br>we in the Southern California Microtonal Group<br>have found it useful to view 19-TET as a gapped<br>nondiatonic  scale with some very xenharmonic<br>ornamental tones.<br>As I've pointed out before (and as Paul Erlich's<br>experiments with his roomate demonstrate), listeners<br>hear the whole-tone portion of a 19-TET diatonic<br>scale as very reasonable and familiar-sounding, but<br>the 2/19 of on octave "semitones" (a misnomer, since<br>this term presupposes that whole tones are <br>divided into 2 parts whereas in 19-TET they are<br>divided into 3 parts)  always make folks squirm.<br>They sound...weird. "Out-of-tune" is the typical<br>description.<br>The solution, in my experience, is to fracture the<br>mislabelled "semitone" intervals in the 19-TET<br>approximation of the 12-TET diatonic scale into<br>1/19s of a tone.  Thus a typical melody in 19-TET<br>will proceed by whole steps which sound very<br>reaonable in combination with 12-TET.  Then<br>a constellation of 1/19-octave steps are used<br>to bridge the gap twixt the next "island" of<br>whole steps in the 19-TET approximation of<br>the diatonic scale.<br>This seems to work reasonably well *provided*<br>that 12-TET semitones and 19-TET 1/19s of<br>an octave don't play simultaneously.  If, instead,<br>these intervals "trade off" between different<br>players (the way good jazz players will trade<br>off playing flatted blues thirds), the 12 + 19<br>combo seems to work well.<br>Another trick that seems to work is to play<br>melodies full of familiar 12-like intervals<br>in 19-TET, but to go above or below the last<br>note of the melody by 1/19 of an octave.<br>This works well, by the way, for many <br>incommensurable ETs: 15 and 12, 14 & 17,<br>15 & 17, 19 & 22, etc.<br>Many ETs are, however, commensurable--<br>that is, one forms a subset of the other,<br>or both form gapped subsets of a much<br>higher division of the octave.<br>When combining 5-TET and 7-TET, for<br>instance, it is often useful to throw<br>in 35-TET chromatic passages.  This<br>emphasizes that the tiny intervals<br>heard between 5-TET and 7-TET pitches<br>that happen to occur vertically are not <br>accidental, but part of the coherent<br>35-TET scale.<br>The issue of combining non-just non-<br>equal-tempered scales with xen ETs,<br>or combining, say, all 3 different <br>classes of tuning simultaneously,<br>is more complex.  I'm still feeling<br>my way along in this regard. <br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 10 Jul 1996 23:07 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id OAA05049; Wed, 10 Jul 1996 14:07:33 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 10 Jul 1996 14:07:33 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960710140342.20783B-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3199 href="#3199">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/1996 3:25:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: Enrique Moreno's 1995 PhD thesis<br>--<br>Enrique Moreno wrote a thesis in 1995 entitled<br>"Embedding Equal Pitch Spaces and the Question<br>of Expanded Chromas: An Experimental Approach."<br>This is available as Report No. STAN-M-93 from<br>the Stanford Unviersity Music Dept., CCRMA,<br>Stanford CA 94305-8180.<br>This dissertation is one of the most interesting<br>and provocative theses about microtonality to<br>come out of Stanford.  It stands as the equal<br>of Elizabeth Cohen's and Douglas Keislar's<br>fascinating theses (both highly recommended).<br>The heart of the thesis can be found on pages 50<br>through 52:<br>"We need to see that the tuning has a unique<br>organization, and that its intervals and chords<br>are, in justice, as unique as the tuning itself<br>may be, even when the tuning may contain<br>very closely approximated versions of some<br>familiar intervals.  The main difference comes<br>perhaps not so much from the intervals of the <br>tunig t hemsleves but from the *context* that<br>the whole tuning as an entity provides for every<br>interval in it.  In this sense, to attempt to classify<br>the new intervals as variations of twelve-tone-to-<br>the-octave equal intervals (or of just intervals)<br>woudl constitute perhaps a reasonable mistake.<br>"It would be reasonable because it is reasonable <br>to attempt to understand unknown things in terms<br>of the things we know, especially if there exists<br>a certain resemblance. It is reasonable to judge <br>the world according tothe categories of our<br>experience, but it is not logical to assume that<br>our categories are the ultimate representation of<br>reality. (..) <br>"Follwoing the same ine of thought, we realize that <br>notating this tuning with the aid of  symbols that <br>make reference to our usual twelve-tone-to-the-<br>octave tuning or to historical tunings would be<br>more or less absurd. Imagine having to interepret<br>the signs ^b, ~#, as "not so flat" and "not so sharp",<br>or -b+++ as "quasi-flat plus three syntonic commas,"<br>or whatever.  In short, regardless that some of the<br>intervals, chords, and even chord progressions may<br>resemble certain well-known intervals, chords, and<br>chord progression,s this tuning and many others <br>(although not necessarily all) deserve a fresh <br>departure point."<br>This is the stronget and clearest statement  I have<br>yet found of one extreme of the attitude toward<br>microtonality--namely, that we should approach<br>the intervals and the tunings anew and search our<br>their properties without preconceptions.  This is<br>clearly not entirely possibe--it remains a fact<br>that the human ear/brain system has measurable<br>properties and various intervals will have predictable<br>*sensory* effects on the auditory system--but in<br>making this point Enrique gets at an extremely<br>important truth.<br>Namely, that the *sensory* affect of an interval or<br>a tuning is not all necessarily the same as the<br>*musical* affect of that interval or tuning.<br>N0orman Cazden made much the same point in<br>the article "On Sensory Consonance," Int. Journ. of<br>Aesthetics and Art Criticism, 1980, but Cazden<br>was mainly concerned with demolishing Helmhotlz's<br>influence.  Enrique's point is much farther-reaching.<br>Now, the other end of the spectrum can be seen<br>in Easley Blackwood's and Paul Rapoport's writings<br>on microtonality.  "When investigating a tuning for<br>which there is no repertoire or tradition of any kind,<br>the most illuminating approach is to look for conenctions<br>between the new tuning and 12-note equal. All the other<br>tunings contain many extremely discordant intervals,<br>and are amenable to row music, or to other non-tonal <br>compositional techniques. But hte most interesting are<br>those that include tonal elements--ie., major and minor<br>triads, and seventh chords, which may be arranged in ways<br>similar to, but not exactly like, 12-note equal." [Blackwood,<br>Easley, "Research Notes, NEH Grant RO-29376-78-0642,<br>1980, page 1]<br>Clearly this approach has a lot of problems.  For example,<br>Blackwood reveals fundamental bias when he states<br>that "major and minor triads" are his primary criteria. <br>This causes him to completely overlook the neutral mode<br>and neutral triads on tunings like 17-TET and 21-TET,<br>and as a result Blackwood makes many verifiably false<br>statements--for example, Blackwood discusses *only*<br>the major and minor triads in 17-TET.  He never discusses<br>the neutral triad, formed from a third with 5 steps of<br>70.588235 cents each. Fortunately, Paul Rapoport revises<br>this oversight--but Paul's overall approach remains<br>relentlessly Pythagorean and 12-TET-based, which is<br>simply not appropriate, say, with melodic modes in 19-TET,<br>or harmonies in 21-TET, or with 9-TET or 7-TET or 10-TET<br>or many other tuning which cannot be jammed into the 12-TET<br>mold.<br>In 17-TET, the neutral melodic mode is an important<br>resource.  Blackwood completely overlooks it.  He does<br>not discuss 8- or 9-tone melodic modes, nor does he<br>discuss pentantonic modes except in 23-TET, to his<br>credit.<br>Thus the great drawback of trying to force all equal<br>temperaments into the conceptual framework of 12-TET<br>is that it leads the composer to completely overlook <br>many useful (but highly non-twelvular) melodic and<br>harmonic resources.<br>On the other hand, Easley Blackwood's and Paul Rapoport's<br>approach to non-12 also has many advantages: by<br>identifying points of similarity with 12, it gives them<br>a place to start analyzing harmonic progressions and<br>melodic modes.<br>The great weakness of Enrique Moreno's position is that<br>he does not provide a conceptual framework for harmonic<br>progressions and melodic modes.<br>The basic idea of Enrique's thesis (to do it gross injustice<br>by boiling it down to a few words) is that non-octave<br>tunings can be characterized by the Nth root of K, where N and<br>K are integers.  In many cases, K then takes on the audible<br>characteristics of the 2:1 (octave) ratio in the twelve-tone<br>equal temperament.  Thus, Enrique contends--and has data<br>from psychoacoustic experiments to prove--that in many <br>cases the K:1 ratio exhibits many of the properties of the<br>octave 2:1 ratio in 12-tone equal temperament. The particular<br>property on which Enrique concentrates is chroma--that is,<br>the property according to which a perceived pitch remains<br>"the same" perceptually if it is displaced up or down by<br>that ratio.  Thus, in 12-TET, a C4 is heard as "the same"<br>as a C3 and a C5; similarly, in the 12th root of 3, Enrique<br>claims (and has data to demonstrate) that a pitch <br>displaced up or down by 3:1 also "sounds the same."<br>This gives a starting point for harmony in non-octave<br>scales, since inversions can now be analyzed, melodic<br>modes can be described, etc.<br>Enrique's approach seems especially praiseworthy because<br>[1] it involves psychoacoustic data, and thus has some<br>connection to the real world--unlike so much mental-<br>masturbation "modern" 12-TET music theory; [2] it has<br>the courage to leave behind 12-TET preconceptions.<br>If it seems utopian that listeners might be expected to utterly<br>abandon 12-TET conventions when listening to mirotonal<br>music, it's well to remember Heinz Werner's paper in<br>the 1940 Journal of Psychology, cited a few posts back.<br>Wener found that, given enough time to familiarize themselves<br>with a microtonal tunings, *every* listener he tested<br>was able to make the leap into hearing the new intervals<br>on their own terms.  <br>Further proof is provided by everyday experience--William<br>Schottstaedt, for example, has pointed out that after working<br>with 11-TET for an extended period, he found that 12-TET<br>sounded "strange" when he returned to it.<br>In sum, Enrique's thesis is a major contribution to microtonal<br>theory.  It also adventurously extends some of the conventional<br>notions of music theory (i.e., octave equivalence) without <br>becoming a slave to 12-TET ideas.<br>--mclaren<br> <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 12 Jul 1996 02:44 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id RAA05905; Thu, 11 Jul 1996 17:44:46 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 11 Jul 1996 17:44:46 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960712003755_71670.2576_HHB80-5@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3204 href="#3204">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/1996 7:27:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: Paul Erlich's points about inharmonic<br> tone complexes - post 1 of 2<br>--<br>John Chalmers informs me that some folks<br>object to the idea of matching inharmonic <br>timbres to inharmonically-derived tunings.<br>Apparently, your contention is that the<br>inharmonic tone complexes tones will be heard<br>as having a virtual pitch entirely different<br>from that of their component inharmonic<br>partials.  Paul Erlich seems typical in<br>these respects.<br>On the surface, this sounds like a good<br>argument.  More: Erlich apparently claims<br>that  inharmonic tone complex will fail<br>to exhibit spectral fusion and will fall apart<br>into a set of discrete partials if they're highly<br>inharmonic.  Thus it would seem pointless<br>to attempt to match a non-just non-equal-<br>tempered tuning to a n-j n-e-t timbre, since<br>the resultant inharmonic timbre will never<br>be heard as having a fundamental pitch<br>related to the pitches of the n-j n-e-t scale<br>from which it is drawn.<br>Is this claim correct?<br>It turns out that it isn't.<br>Paul Erlich strikes me as a smart fellow with<br>some knowledge of acoustics and pyschoacoustics.<br>Alas, as a newly-minted graduate much of Paul's<br>knowledge is book learning only.   And, as it turns<br>out, much of what has been written about complexes<br>of inharmonic tones is either wrong, irrelevant<br>to xenharmonic composition, or the result of <br>peculiar and non-musical experimental conditions.<br>This issue is important.  James Dashow, Jean-Claude<br>Risset, William Sethares, myself, and a number of<br>other composers have produced a substantial body<br>of compositional work in which non-just non-equal-<br>tempered timbres and tunings are used.  If Paul's<br>claims (and some of the available psychoacoustic<br>literature about inharmonic tones) are correct,<br>then the theoretical and musical justification for<br>much of this compositional work collapses.<br>As will be seen, however, there is a great deal<br>of evidence *against* Paul Erlich's view, and<br>many of the psychoacoustic papers which purport<br>to "prove" that inharmonic tone complexes do not<br>audibly fuse are lethally flawed.<br>Let us begin with the alleged evidence *against* the <br>coherent audibility of inharmonic tone complexes:<br>Rayleigh, in his 1876 2-volume text "Acoustics," points<br>out that the fundamental pitch of orchestral timpani<br>is a frequency not present in the partials produced<br>by this instrument.  Rayleigh explained this by<br>pointing out that the ear hears some of the upper<br>partials of timpani as belonging to a fragment of<br>an harmonic series; the ear extrapolates from<br>this harmonic-series fragment a lower pitch<br>which is heard as the fundamental though not<br>physically present.  Other partials, which are<br>physically present, are heard as "hum" notes<br>which do not contribute to the sense of musical<br>pitch of the note.<br>Rayleigh noted the same phenomenon with regard<br>to bells: here again, the lowest several inharmonic<br>partials are heard as "hum" notes, but do not make<br>musical contribution to the sense of pitch of<br>the bell.<br>65 years later Schouten demonstrated in<br>an elegant experiment that the human ear often<br>heard a fundamental pitch not physically present in<br>a musical sound.  "He had constructed a sort<br>of optical siren (Figure 6-4) by means of which<br>he could produce sounds with various waveforms.<br>Using this, he produced sounds with harmonically<br>related partials. (..) Then, by proper adjustments,<br>he could cancel out the fundamental frequency...<br>I could hear this fundamental frequency come and<br>go, but the pitch of the sound did not change at <br>all.  In some way, my ear inferred the proper <br>pitch form the harmonics..." [Pierce, J. R., "The<br>Science of Musical Sound," 2nd ed., 1992, pg. 92]<br>The paper "Pitch of the residue," by J. F. Schouten,<br>R. J. Ritsma and B. L. Cardozo, J. Acoust. Soc. Am.,<br>Vol. 34, pp. 1418-1424, 1962, presents these<br>results concisely. "Whenever a sound consists<br>of a small number of frequencies, spaced<br>sufficiently widely, subjective sound analysis<br>allows us to hear each Fourier component as a<br>separate pure tone with corresponding pitch<br>(Ohm's acoustical law).  If, however, the<br>frequencies are narrowly spaced, the ear<br>fails partly or completely to analyze the<br>Fourier components into corresponding pure<br>tones and, instead, hears one single percept<br>of sharp timbre.  If, moreover, the frequencies<br>are harmonics of one fundamental frequency,<br>the percept may have a decidedly low pitch."<br>[Schouten, J. R., J. Ritsman, B. Lopes Cardozo,<br>"Pitch of the Residue," J. Acoust. Soc. Am.,<br>Vol. 34, No. 8, September 1962, pg. 1418.]<br>Schouten et al. go on to point out that "The<br>phenomenon of the reside necessarily leads<br>to a hypothetical pitch extractor different<br>from and subsequent to the analyzer. As a<br>consequence of the pitch shifts, the operation<br>of the pitch extraction in the frequency<br>domain is highly improbable. Therefore, the<br>hypothetical pitch extractor probably <br>operates in the time domain (e.g., with<br>delay-line tehcniques)." [ibid., pg. 1424]<br>Further evidence for the existence of<br>periodicity (or "virtual") pitch is found<br>in "Periodicity Pitch for Interrupted White<br>Noise--Fact or Artifact?" by Irwin Pollack,<br>J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol 45, no. 1, 1969,<br>pp. 237-238.  The author concludes that<br>switching transients cannot provide a<br>reasonable explanation for the perceived<br>ability of listeners to accurately match<br>the pitch of the interrupted noise despite<br>the fact that "The long-term spectrum of <br>an interrupted white noise shows no <br>sepctral peaks at the frequency of <br>interruption."  Consequently "The results,<br>therefore, suggest that the periodicity pitch<br>of interrupted noise is factual, no artifactual."<br>[Ibid., pg. 238]<br>The book "Frequency Analysis and Periodicity<br>Detection in Hearing," ed. R. Plomp and G. F.<br>SMoorenburg, A. W. Sithoff, Leiden, 1970,<br>adduced further evidence in favor of virtual<br>pitch as the primary pitch extractor in the<br>human auditory system. Franz Bilsen <br>concludes "The perceptual similarity between<br>a sound with its repetition and a pure periodic<br>signal can be represented in a general model<br>for the perceptibility of pitch and timbre. Like<br>the explanation of repteition pitch, time <br>separation pitch, and peridocity pitch, the model<br>finds its description in the time domain." [Bilsen,<br>F., "Repetition Pitch: Its Implications for Hearing<br>Theory and Room Acoustics," Frequency Analysis<br>and Periodicity Detection In Hearing--Ed. R. Plomp<br>and G. F. SMoorenburg, A. W. Sithoff, Leiden, 1970,<br>pp. 291-299]<br>Schouten himself points that the earlier (Helmholtz)<br>explanation of fundamental perception by nonlinear<br>production of difference tones between higher <br>harmonics fails: "The case of the missing fundamental<br>was solved for the time being (the 1860s-1920s)<br>by a modelmaker's brainwave that the nonlinearity <br>of the ear could produce the missing fundamental as<br>a difference tone between the higher harmonics. Both<br>Fletcher (1929) and von Bekesy (1934), now as<br>observers, proved this point by the method of best <br>beats. Sadly enough, the method of best beats is<br>unreliable unless one knows "who beats whom."<br>(..) In a way the discovery of the residue confirmed <br>Seebeck's "wider interpretation" that the high <br>harmonics might contribute somehow to the <br>fundamental tone, except that it is not the<br>fundamental tone itself which is enhanced but a<br>different subject component: the residue.<br>"As a modelmaker, the author (Schouten) ascribed<br>the low pitch of the residue to the *period* in the <br>time pattern of the joint harmonics striking a<br>particular area of the basilar membrane (Schouten,<br>1940s). This amounted to a revival of many older<br>assumptions, except that the initial quasi-Fourier<br>analysis was left standing in full glory.<br>"If a set of harmonics is shifted collectively over<br>a small distance in the frequency scale, the pitch<br>of the residue shifts *in proportion* to the <br>constituent frequencies (Schouten, 1940c). This<br>crucial experiment (now called the first effect<br>of pitch shift) kills two birds with one stone. It<br>implies that pitch is determined neither by the<br>*spacing* of the harmonics, nor by the *time*<br>envelope of the wave pattern since both remain <br>invariant.  Hence, in the realm of modelmaking, <br>it must be anouther form of periodicity detection<br>in the time domain.  This notion goes back to some<br>etent to Seebeck's (1844a) idea of 'the periodic<br>recurrence of an equal or similar state of movement'<br>and to Hermann's (1912) 'intermittence tones.'"<br>[Schouten, J., "The Residue Revisited," Frequency<br>Analysis and Periodicity Detection in Hearing, Ed.<br>R. Plomp and G. F. Smoorenburg, A. W. Sithoff, <br>Leiden, 1970, pp. 41-58]<br>These papers provided apparently convincing<br>proof of the residue's primacy in determining<br>perceived pitch.  Such was the power of the<br>residue pitch hypothesis that, from the late<br> 1960s to the present, Ernst Terhardt<br>produced an influential series of papers based<br>on his model of virtual pitch detection: "Zur<br>Tonho"henwarnehmung von Kla"ngen I. <br>Psykoakustische Grundlagen" [Concerning the<br>perceived pitch height of sounds: I.

Ein Funktionschema," Acustica,<br>Vol. 26, No. 4.,  [Concerning the perceived pitch<br>height of sounds: II. A functional model].<br>Terhardt's theory essentially relegates the<br>residue or "virtual" pitch to the role of a<br>"secondary sensation," ascribing the primary<br>mechanism of pitch detetction to the well-worn<br>place theory, which accords the operation of<br>the basilar membrane primacy in determining<br>pitch. "The pitch of simple tones and the<br>"residue" pitch of complex tones exhibit quite<br>different properties. The pitch of simple tones<br>may be xplained by the principles of the 'classical'<br>place theory. The 'residue' pitch is closely related <br>to the pure tone pitches of partials. It is<br>concluded that the 'residue' pitch may be regarded<br>as a 'seondary sensation,' derived from the pure<br>tone pitches of dominant partials." [Terhardt, E.,<br>op. cit., pg. 174]<br>Terhardt went on publish a series of papers in<br>which he elaborated the "residue" pitch as a <br>secondary sensation: "Pitch consonacne, and<br>harmony," J.

In 1976, <br>de Boer's monumental study (he calls it "a<br>textbook inside a book") of the residue pitch<br>defined the field: "On the 'Residue' and Auditory Pitch<br>Perception," in Handbook of Sensory Physiology,<br>Volume 5, No. 3, Springer-Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg-<br>New York, 1976, pp. 481-583]<br>This survey of the residue pitch phenomenon drew<br>on de Boer's doctoral dissertation and provided an<br>unparalleled overview: from Seebeck's acoustic<br>siren to Schouten's and Ritsma's work, to the<br>evidence from chopped noise (Pollock, op. cit.),<br>to Smoorenburg's own work.<br>Here, however, doubt begins to creep in about<br>the universal validity of the residue hypothesis<br>as the basis of pitch detection. "Must we say<br>goodbye to the 'residue'? We might be inclined<br>to say: yes. In the course of this treatise, we<br>witnessed the gradual change of meaning of<br>tjhe term 'resideu,' a change that finally led<br>to a new and less restrictive definition (see e.g.,<br>Section E. 10). At the same time the musical<br>aspects of 'residue pitch' grew more and more <br>important. (..) What is also new is the<br>ambiguity involved in residue pitch. This was <br>recognized rather reluctantly at first (Section <br>E. 6); later, it was considered an essential feature<br>of the mechanism (Section E 14). How essential<br>it is did not become completely clear before the<br>work on two-tone complexes and musical intervals<br>(Section H. 2). In last instance, even the harmonic<br>number n of the lower partial appeared to be<br>esentially ambiguous (Section H. 6). The ambiguity<br>involves one other concept that is, in the opinion of<br>the present reviewer, of the greatest importance. (..)<br>When we listen to a sound, we do not perceive this or <br>that aspect of the sound all the time; what we perceive<br>depends completely on our training. (..) Hence,<br>the fact that the result of a particular experiment <br>turns out to be extremely clear-cut does not <br>necessarily imply that ever naive listener is able <br>to perceive the signals in the same way. It is not too <br>difficult to associate a residue pitch with a two-<br>tone complex presented monaurally. But to do the <br>same with a two-tone complex presented dichotically<br>is quite anotehr matter. (..) We may conclude that we<br>must be extremely cautious in our conclusions."<br>[de Boer, E., "On the 'Residue' and Auditory Pitch<br>Perception," Handbook of Sensory Physiology, Vol. 5,<br>No. 3, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1976, pp. 572-574]<br>R.

(..) We already possess convincing <br>musical examples illustrating that sources with<br>inharmonic partials have musical potential<br>outside the confines of western harmony. The<br>musical legacy of the Balinese gamelan is an<br>outstanding example. In addition, recent<br>compositions such as Inharmonique (Jean Claude<br>Risset) and Stria (John Chowning) have<br>demonstrated that inharmonic materials can<br>render musical ideas with exquisite sensitivity<br>within a more "western" context." [COhen, E.,<br>"Some Effects of Inharmonic Partials On<br>Interval Perpcetion," Music Perception, VOl. <br>1, No. 3, Spring 1984, pp. 323-349]<br>Cohen searched for a mechanism which could<br>explain why "Inharmonic tones are not <br>conventionally part of the infra-structure<br>of western harmony, but may be used in<br>the same manner as harmonic tones <br>under certain conditions." <br>Cohen notes that a number of her test<br>subjects had no difficulty perceiving<br>harmonic progressions in inharmonic<br>tones, and perceives as "octaves" intervals<br>far from the 2:1..."Subject GWM shows no<br>desire to cling to an octave based on a<br>learned or innate preference for a physical<br>ratio of 2:1." [op. cit., pg. 337]<br>She found similar results for inharmonic<br>"fifths": "The data suggests that GWM, JWG<br>and JMS tune by matching partials."<br>Cohen concludes that "The nature of an<br>instrument having noninteger partials suggests<br>a need to develop an interval sense on something<br>other than simple integer ratios or fundamental<br>doubling.  It is suggested here that GWM relied<br>on an interval sense that was based on <br>recognizing the consonance determined by<br>coincident partials and associating this <br>sound as a particular interval."<br>Cohen further points out that "If the composer<br>fuses the sound by controlling the temporal<br>evolution of the partials, then the composer <br>can be assured that conventional relationships<br>and impressions can be made to hold. If the<br>composer wishes to exploit the inharmonicity<br>of the stretched tones, yet maintain certain<br>consonance relations, then the knowledge<br>that interaction of the partials can successfully <br>determine interval size will surely be a useful<br>tool." [op. cit., pg. 347]<br>This would appear to strike the death blow for<br>Paul Erlich's argument.<br>We are now in a position to see why earlier<br>experiments with inharmonic tones failed to<br>produce a sense of spectral fusion, and why<br>earlier experiments (pre-1970s) with<br>inharmonic tones usually exhibited a residue<br>pitch unrelated to the frequencies of the<br>partials:<br>[1] Early experiments with inharmonic tones<br>used crude analog electronic tone production<br>circuits which generated a set of unrelated<br>iharmonic partials.  Typically, FM or AM<br>was used, or digital counter circuits.<br>By contrast, the use of digital computers <br>to generate inharmonic tone-complexes in<br>the 1970s allowed researchers to generate<br>inharmonic tones all of whose partials were<br>related.  Clearly this had a profound audible<br>effect on test subjects.<br>[2] Early experiments used extremely "electronc-<br>sounding" lifeless inharmonic tones with very<br>simple amplitude envelopes.  As John Chowning<br>has pointed out (and as can be heard clearly<br>in his composition Phone), even perfectly <br>harmonic sounds often fail to fuse into<br>a single percept if the envelopes of the <br>different partials do not share a common<br>vibrato and tremolo.  The effect can be <br>vividly heard in Chowning's composition:<br>a set of partials appears from silence and<br>while harmonic, sounds like an unrelated set<br>of partials: but when each partials slowly<br>begins to exhibit common vibrato, the <br>set of "unrelated" tones gradually fuse into<br>the unified percept of a human voice.<br>The same effect was clearly at work in<br>early experiments with inharmonic tones.<br>Later experiments, like Cohen's, use<br>common amplitude and frequency<br>information "built into" the envelopes<br>of each inharmonic partial to encourage<br>the tones to audibly fuse--and experiments<br>from the 1970s onward show that such<br>inharmonic tones, so modified, do indeed fuse.<br>[3] Early experiments with inharmonic tones<br>use arbitrarily stretched partials.  Later,<br>more sophisticated experiments, (as we<br>shall see) use sets of partials which <br>exhibit the properties of an "inharmonic<br>series" of tones which are related to some<br>coherent generating method.  The ear can<br>hear this and places the inharmonic partials<br>within the inharmonic series, producing<br>a complete and convincing sense of finality<br>in inharmonic cadences.<br>As the final nail in the coffin of Terhardt's<br>apparently all-embracing theory, note the<br>article "Reivsion of Terhardt's Psychoacoustical<br>Model of the Root(s) Of a Musical Chord," R.<br>Parncutt, Music Perception, Vol. 6, No. 1, Fall <br>1988, pp. 65-94:<br>"The predictions of Terhardt's octave-<br>generalized model of the root of a musical<br>chord occasionally disagree with music theory<br>(notably, in the case of the minor triad.)"<br>Thus Terhardt's theory (like so many others<br>which purported to give 'all the answers'<br>about how the ear hears) is now crumbling,<br>and various desperate attempts are being<br>made to shore it up. <br>This tells us (as we should have known all along)<br>that the ear uses more than the virtual<br>pitch mechanism to ascertain fundamental<br>pitch of real-world musical sounds. It also<br>tells us that the operation of the ear is complex<br>and context-sensitive, and that therefore an<br>inharmonic tone progression which offers the<br>ear alternate cues can and often will be heard<br>as an inharmonic progression within a coherent<br>yet inharmonic series of timbres.<br>The second and final post in this series will<br>discuss the overwhelming evidence *against*<br>Erlich's claim, and *in favor of* the ability of even<br>the most naive listener to hear inharmonic<br>progressions of inharmonic tones as<br>exhibiting a sense of harmonic closure,<br>and a fundamental pitch related to the<br>fundamental of the inharmonic tone complex..<br>Ideas fundamental to the extension of microtonality<br>into the realm of timbre.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 16 Jul 1996 16:31 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA00444; Tue, 16 Jul 1996 07:30:58 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 16 Jul 1996 07:30:58 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.91.960716072806.7804F-100000@garcia.efn.org><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3206 href="#3206">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: Enrique Moreno's 1995 PhD thesis<br>--<br>Enrique Moreno wrote a thesis in 1995 entitled<br>"Embedding Equal Pitch Spaces and the Question<br>of Expanded Chromas: An Experimental Approach."<br>This is available as Report No. STAN-M-93 from<br>the Stanford Unviersity Music Dept., CCRMA,<br>Stanford CA 94305-8180.<br>This dissertation is one of the most interesting<br>and provocative theses about microtonality to<br>come out of Stanford.  It stands as the equal<br>of Elizabeth Cohen's and Douglas Keislar's<br>fascinating theses (both highly recommended).<br>The heart of the thesis can be found on pages 50<br>through 52:<br>"We need to see that the tuning has a unique<br>organization, and that its intervals and chords<br>are, in justice, as unique as the tuning itself<br>may be, even when the tuning may contain<br>very closely approximated versions of some<br>familiar intervals.  The main difference comes<br>perhaps not so much from the intervals of the <br>tunig t hemsleves but from the *context* that<br>the whole tuning as an entity provides for every<br>interval in it.  In this sense, to attempt to classify<br>the new intervals as variations of twelve-tone-to-<br>the-octave equal intervals (or of just intervals)<br>woudl constitute perhaps a reasonable mistake.<br>"It would be reasonable because it is reasonable <br>to attempt to understand unknown things in terms<br>of the things we know, especially if there exists<br>a certain resemblance. It is reasonable to judge <br>the world according tothe categories of our<br>experience, but it is not logical to assume that<br>our categories are the ultimate representation of<br>reality. (..) <br>"Follwoing the same ine of thought, we realize that <br>notating this tuning with the aid of  symbols that <br>make reference to our usual twelve-tone-to-the-<br>octave tuning or to historical tunings would be<br>more or less absurd. Imagine having to interepret<br>the signs ^b, ~#, as "not so flat" and "not so sharp",<br>or -b+++ as "quasi-flat plus three syntonic commas,"<br>or whatever.  In short, regardless that some of the<br>intervals, chords, and even chord progressions may<br>resemble certain well-known intervals, chords, and<br>chord progression,s this tuning and many others <br>(although not necessarily all) deserve a fresh <br>departure point."<br>This is the stronget and clearest statement  I have<br>yet found of one extreme of the attitude toward<br>microtonality--namely, that we should approach<br>the intervals and the tunings anew and search our<br>their properties without preconceptions.  This is<br>clearly not entirely possibe--it remains a fact<br>that the human ear/brain system has measurable<br>properties and various intervals will have predictable<br>*sensory* effects on the auditory system--but in<br>making this point Enrique gets at an extremely<br>important truth.<br>Namely, that the *sensory* affect of an interval or<br>a tuning is not all necessarily the same as the<br>*musical* affect of that interval or tuning.<br>N0orman Cazden made much the same point in<br>the article "On Sensory Consonance," Int. Journ. of<br>Aesthetics and Art Criticism, 1980, but Cazden<br>was mainly concerned with demolishing Helmhotlz's<br>influence.  Enrique's point is much farther-reaching.<br>Now, the other end of the spectrum can be seen<br>in Easley Blackwood's and Paul Rapoport's writings<br>on microtonality.  "When investigating a tuning for<br>which there is no repertoire or tradition of any kind,<br>the most illuminating approach is to look for conenctions<br>between the new tuning and 12-note equal. All the other<br>tunings contain many extremely discordant intervals,<br>and are amenable to row music, or to other non-tonal <br>compositional techniques. But hte most interesting are<br>those that include tonal elements--ie., major and minor<br>triads, and seventh chords, which may be arranged in ways<br>similar to, but not exactly like, 12-note equal." [Blackwood,<br>Easley, "Research Notes, NEH Grant RO-29376-78-0642,<br>1980, page 1]<br>Clearly this approach has a lot of problems.  For example,<br>Blackwood reveals fundamental bias when he states<br>that "major and minor triads" are his primary criteria. <br>This causes him to completely overlook the neutral mode<br>and neutral triads on tunings like 17-TET and 21-TET,<br>and as a result Blackwood makes many verifiably false<br>statements--for example, Blackwood discusses *only*<br>the major and minor triads in 17-TET.  He never discusses<br>the neutral triad, formed from a third with 5 steps of<br>70.588235 cents each. Fortunately, Paul Rapoport revises<br>this oversight--but Paul's overall approach remains<br>relentlessly Pythagorean and 12-TET-based, which is<br>simply not appropriate, say, with melodic modes in 19-TET,<br>or harmonies in 21-TET, or with 9-TET or 7-TET or 10-TET<br>or many other tuning which cannot be jammed into the 12-TET<br>mold.<br>In 17-TET, the neutral melodic mode is an important<br>resource.  Blackwood completely overlooks it.  He does<br>not discuss 8- or 9-tone melodic modes, nor does he<br>discuss pentantonic modes except in 23-TET, to his<br>credit.<br>Thus the great drawback of trying to force all equal<br>temperaments into the conceptual framework of 12-TET<br>is that it leads the composer to completely overlook <br>many useful (but highly non-twelvular) melodic and<br>harmonic resources.<br>On the other hand, Easley Blackwood's and Paul Rapoport's<br>approach to non-12 also has many advantages: by<br>identifying points of similarity with 12, it gives them<br>a place to start analyzing harmonic progressions and<br>melodic modes.<br>The great weakness of Enrique Moreno's position is that<br>he does not provide a conceptual framework for harmonic<br>progressions and melodic modes.<br>The basic idea of Enrique's thesis (to do it gross injustice<br>by boiling it down to a few words) is that non-octave<br>tunings can be characterized by the Nth root of K, where N and<br>K are integers.  In many cases, K then takes on the audible<br>characteristics of the 2:1 (octave) ratio in the twelve-tone<br>equal temperament.  Thus, Enrique contends--and has data<br>from psychoacoustic experiments to prove--that in many <br>cases the K:1 ratio exhibits many of the properties of the<br>octave 2:1 ratio in 12-tone equal temperament. The particular<br>property on which Enrique concentrates is chroma--that is,<br>the property according to which a perceived pitch remains<br>"the same" perceptually if it is displaced up or down by<br>that ratio.  Thus, in 12-TET, a C4 is heard as "the same"<br>as a C3 and a C5; similarly, in the 12th root of 3, Enrique<br>claims (and has data to demonstrate) that a pitch <br>displaced up or down by 3:1 also "sounds the same."<br>This gives a starting point for harmony in non-octave<br>scales, since inversions can now be analyzed, melodic<br>modes can be described, etc.<br>Enrique's approach seems especially praiseworthy because<br>[1] it involves psychoacoustic data, and thus has some<br>connection to the real world--unlike so much mental-<br>masturbation "modern" 12-TET music theory; [2] it has<br>the courage to leave behind 12-TET preconceptions.<br>If it seems utopian that listeners might be expected to utterly<br>abandon 12-TET conventions when listening to mirotonal<br>music, it's well to remember Heinz Werner's paper in<br>the 1940 Journal of Psychology, cited a few posts back.<br>Wener found that, given enough time to familiarize themselves<br>with a microtonal tunings, *every* listener he tested<br>was able to make the leap into hearing the new intervals<br>on their own terms.  <br>Further proof is provided by everyday experience--William<br>Schottstaedt, for example, has pointed out that after working<br>with 11-TET for an extended period, he found that 12-TET<br>sounded "strange" when he returned to it.<br>In sum, Enrique's thesis is a major contribution to microtonal<br>theory.  It also adventurously extends some of the conventional<br>notions of music theory (i.e., octave equivalence) without <br>becoming a slave to 12-TET ideas.<br>--mclaren</div><h3><a id=3215 href="#3215">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject:  Yet another overlooked (but remarkable)<br>  article on microtonality<br>--<br>The Journal of Psychology is not a place you'd <br>usually think of looking for articles about<br>xenharmonic music--especially perceptive early<br>articles which foreshadow many later developments.<br>But, as it turns out, one such article was published<br>in Vol. 10, 1940, J. Psych., pp. 149-156, author<br>Heinz Werner.<br>The title is "Musical 'Micro-Scales' and 'Micro-<br>Melodies.'"<br>In this remarkable article, Werner discusses <br>what was later to become known as categorical<br>perception (though in 1940 it did not have that<br>name).  Werner points out that "A subject, when<br>presented with a arelatively small interval of--let <br>us say--0.12 of a semitone, at first may hear a<br>very slight indefinite difference between the two<br>tones, or even no difference at all.  But when the<br>same interval is repeated a great many times with <br>the subject deliberately focussing his attention on<br>the task of discerning a clear-cut interval, there <br>will almost invariably be reported an apparent<br>enlargement of the objectively constant interval.<br>UIsual;ly there is a maximum in this subjective<br>augmentation: *the maximum is reached<br>when this small interval has acquired the subjective<br>character of a semi-tone.*  The time necessary<br>for the attainment of this maximum increase varies<br>greatly with the individual, but so far not one <br>individual has been encountered who did not hear<br>the semi-tone-like quality after more or less<br>repetition." [Werner, H., "Musical 'Micro-Scales'<br>and 'Micro-Melodies,'" J. Pych., Vol. 10, 1940,<br>pp. 149-150]<br>In this paper Werner goes on to describe a set<br>of experiments in meldoic recognition performed<br>with intervals of "less than one-sixth of a <br>normal semi-tone (16.5 cents)."<br>Werner foudn a number of fascinating effects: <br>one which he called "the law of increasing <br>stabilization" mandated athat "if the subject should<br>be presented with an ascending-descending interval, <br>he will at first perceive the ascending phase as<br>subjectively larger than the one which descends."<br>Werner also found audible apradoxes--for example,<br>because the melodic patterns used tended to <br>acquire a gestalt quality of their own as well<br>as the effect caused by the pitch of the individual<br>notes "this leads to a paradoxical statement<br>frequently made by the [subjects] that even though<br>Tones 1 and 2 remain constant in character, <br>nevertheless the interval separating these tones <br>may audibly vary in size.  All this seems to prove<br>that it is not the position of the tones which is of<br>primary important and which creates the quality of<br>the interval. It would seem that it is the quality of <br>the interval which determines the position of the<br>tones in the micro-system." <br>Yet another fascinating effect was observed when <br>Werner played the ubjects a straight chromatic <br>cmirotonal scale versus a melody: "When the scale <br>such was given chromatically, i.e., step by step, <br>none of these subjects, providing that there were<br>completely ' in the system,' found any distinction<br>between te micro-scale and the normal piano scale. <br>Indivudal differences came to the fore when the<br>micro-melodies were compared to patterns of the<br>normal scale. Two of the subjects felt sure<br>that no difference existed.  One observed expressed <br>the feeling that it was as if she were sitting in a<br>puppet theater. 'If one keeps on looking at the puppets,<br>after a while they acquire the full siz eof human<br>beings!' The other two subjects felt a certain <br>difference." <br>This is a fascinating and to my knowledge one of the<br>only *subjective* records of naive observers' <br>reactionsn to microtonal melodies.  (By "naive" I<br>mean test subjects who weren't committed<br>microtonalists). <br>Moreover, Werner found that microtonal melodies<br>were perceived with considerable consistency<br>by the subjects, once they'd become used to hearing<br>them.  Observers could make reliable judgments<br>about whether two halves of micro-melody "fit"<br>together, or whether a melody formed an<br>antepenultimate closure leading to a cadence,<br>or whether the melody was perceived as<br>"empty" or not because it used primarily<br>members of the harmonic series.<br>Carol Krumhansl has done a great deal of work<br>with the "probe tone" method of studying<br>melodic perception.  Comparing her work to<br>Heinz Werner's, however, it seems to me that<br>Krumhansl's assumptions are crucially flawed.<br>For one thing, she assumed that when an observer<br>hears a 12-TET melody with one note missing<br>and then a series of notes off by  various twelfths<br>of a semitone, the observer willr eact according<br>to an innate sense of "tonality," rather than <br>according ot how s/he has been programmed by<br>a lifetime of listening to 12-TET.  <br>Second, Krumhansl assumes implicitly that no<br>systematic distinction can be made by test<br>subjects between one "mistuned" (tuned off<br>the target 12-TET note by some number of<br>twelfths of a semitone) note and another.<br>But Heinz Werner's article proves this is<br>clearly not so--and our own experience <br>indicates very clearly that observers can <br>easily be trained to hear intervals as small<br>(in my case, anyway_ as 1/100 of an octave.<br>In fact Jonathan Glasier reliably tuned Pep<br>Estavane's Harmonry Harp by ear to 1/100<br>of an octave intervals per string: he had no<br>trouble hearing a distinct difference twixt<br>adjacent tones, and he was reliably able<br>to detect which strings approximated members<br>of the harmonic series and which did not.<br>Third, Krumhansl seems to assume that <br>observers cannot tell whether the probe tone<br>is bouncing around between different circles<br>of fifths (each 1/12 of a semitone or 1/72<br>of an octave belongs to *different* circle<br>of fifths--and there are *six* different and<br>entirely incompatible circles of fifths in the<br>72-tone equal-tempered scale).<br>But my own experience indicates that this<br>assumption is probably untrue--and Werner's <br>evidence supports this contention strongly.<br>If Werner's subjects were able to hear <br>difrferences in the implied harmonies of<br>one 36-TET scale versus another, would <br>not Krumhansl's test subjects have made<br>similar judgments about one 72-TET scale<br>step versus another?<br>In short, Heinz Werner's article seems to me<br>a model of its kind.  It is amazing that this<br>article has almost never been cited in the<br>microtonal literature.  It blazes many new<br>trails and foreshadows quite a few later<br>developments.  In particular, Werner's <br>briliant idea of giving test subjects *months*<br>the get used to hearing micro-melodies <br>completely revolutionized test procedures<br>for microtonal melodies.<br>It is in fact shocking that psychoacoutic<br>and music psychology experiments continue<br>to be done today using micro-meldoies, but<br>*without* giving the subjects adequate time<br>to overcome the inevitable effects of <br>categorical perception which are known to<br>apply to any naive listener who hears an<br>entirely different tuning for the first time.<br>Heinz Werner's paper did not seem to garner<br>any attention...it appears to have dropped<br>into the sea of psychological literature and<br>vanished.<br>Yet it would fascinating to follow up on<br>Werner's experiments today, using modern<br>equipment, and do a second series of<br>experiments pushing further along the<br>lines Werner laid out. In paritcular it<br>would extremely interesting to compare<br>subject reactions to micro-harmonies<br>a well as micro-melodies, after a suitable<br>period of acclimitization by the <br>listeners.<br>This is a truly remarkable paper, and one <br>which every microtonalist would do well<br>to study.<br>Incidentally, there is one other paper by<br>Heinz Werner I've been able to track down--<br>"Uber Mikromeloik und Mikroharmonik," in<br>Zeitschrift f"ur Psychologie, 1926, pp. <br>74-128.  This probably explains the depth<br>and breadth of Werner's later paper.  Clearly<br>he cut his teeth on microtonality in the <br>European quartertone movement of the 20s,<br>then came to America as a refugee before<br>or during WW II.<br>It's a shame he never published anything else,<br>so far as I can tell.

"Out-of-tune" is the typical<br>description.<br>The solution, in my experience, is to fracture the<br>mislabelled "semitone" intervals in the 19-TET<br>approximation of the 12-TET diatonic scale into<br>1/19s of a tone.  Thus a typical melody in 19-TET<br>will proceed by whole steps which sound very<br>reaonable in combination with 12-TET.  Then<br>a constellation of 1/19-octave steps are used<br>to bridge the gap twixt the next "island" of<br>whole steps in the 19-TET approximation of<br>the diatonic scale.<br>This seems to work reasonably well *provided*<br>that 12-TET semitones and 19-TET 1/19s of<br>an octave don't play simultaneously.  If, instead,<br>these intervals "trade off" between different<br>players (the way good jazz players will trade<br>off playing flatted blues thirds), the 12 + 19<br>combo seems to work well.<br>Another trick that seems to work is to play<br>melodies full of familiar 12-like intervals<br>in 19-TET, but to go above or below the last<br>note of the melody by 1/19 of an octave.<br>This works well, by the way, for many <br>incommensurable ETs: 15 and 12, 14 & 17,<br>15 & 17, 19 & 22, etc.<br>Many ETs are, however, commensurable--<br>that is, one forms a subset of the other,<br>or both form gapped subsets of a much<br>higher division of the octave.<br>When combining 5-TET and 7-TET, for<br>instance, it is often useful to throw<br>in 35-TET chromatic passages.  This<br>emphasizes that the tiny intervals<br>heard between 5-TET and 7-TET pitches<br>that happen to occur vertically are not <br>accidental, but part of the coherent<br>35-TET scale.<br>The issue of combining non-just non-<br>equal-tempered scales with xen ETs,<br>or combining, say, all 3 different <br>classes of tuning simultaneously,<br>is more complex.  I'm still feeling<br>my way along in this regard. <br>--mclaren</div><h3><a id=3413 href="#3413">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/1996 9:22:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: More marvellous musical insights from<br>the musical cognitive elite<br>--<br>Without concern for how the music *sounds*,<br>no system of composition can long survive.<br>And the endeavour to keep a  brain-<br>dead theory of composition from perishing, <br>on life support, years after its rationale<br>has gone, can only lead to brain death.<br>The latest outbreak of this symptomatic<br>condition bursts forth in Perspectives of<br>New Music, Vol. 39, Nos. 1 & 2, 1995, <br>pp. 554-558.<br>The article is "Cheered By Battleship," by <br>James Boros. <br>It's quite something.<br>"It ended in an open shaftway, following <br>LBJ's example.

As always,<br>most of you won't like these opinions--<br>and, as always, many of you will claim<br>that these statements are false, <br>ignorant, untrue, delusional, etc.<br>As usual, this is incorrect and yet<br>another demonstration that most of<br>you have ruined your hearing by<br>listening to far too much rock<br>music or far too many concerts<br>of so-called serious electronic<br>music at far too high amplification<br>levels. (This proved a critical<br>probem at the 1992 ICMC concerts.<br>TA's often pumped up the volume so<br>loud that the entire audience cringed,<br>held their ears, and the speakers<br>distorted.)<br>A number of forum subscribers have<br>claimed that most of the music we<br>all hear is live, rather than <br>recorded. This claim can only be<br>explained as the result of mental<br>illness or hard drug usage, since<br>it is so indisputably contrary to <br>everyday reality. <br>"The pervasive assumption that<br>support for new music and its<br>composers equals support for<br>performances...needs questioning.<br>(..) Most music is heard at home, <br>via records, radio and printed<br>sheet music. Composers have been<br>getting little support for creation<br>or presentation of works via these<br>media to the many people who depend<br>on them." [Spiegel, Laurie, "A<br>Non-Performance Viewpoint," New<br>Music America '81 Festival program<br>booklet, page 49, 1981]<br>Since most music is heard at home<br>via CD, cassette or radio, this<br>means that the way in which microtonal <br>music is recorded is *at least* as<br>important as the microtonal music<br>itself.<br>First and most important is the issue<br>of how the recording is mixed. The hard<br>cold fact is that you can either mix<br>for headphones, or for speakers--but<br>you can't mix for both. A mix that<br>sounds best when heard over headphones<br>is likely to sound indistinct, with<br>an exaggerated sound stage when heard<br>over speakers.  Contrariwise, a mix<br>that sounds best when heard over<br>speakers will seem too dry and too<br>sharp-edged when heard over headphones.<br>Alas, there is no way around this<br>dilemma. You cannot mix so that the<br>recorded sound is optimal on *both*<br>headphones and speakers. <br>Unfortunately, even the most expensive<br>audiophile speakers sound utterly<br>completely 100% totally different from <br>headphones. There is no sonic comparison<br>whatever. This becomes especially clear<br>when you make binaural recordings using<br>mikes placed about as far apart as the<br>ears on a human head. A 2-mike binaural<br>recording will sound truly startling<br>in its realism when heard<br>over headphones, but it will sound<br>disastrously weird when you hear it<br>through a pair of speakers.<br>Headphones isolate one ear from the other;<br>speakers blend the output of both channels<br>in the air and throughout all reflecting<br>surfaces in the room. <br>The result?  Speakers usually tolerate far<br>less reverb in the mix. A subtle touch of<br>BBE or Aphex aural enhancement will also<br>greatly help the clarity of a mix<br>heard through speakers. Even drastic <br>processing like the Carver sonic holography<br>process will sound acceptable. But the same<br>"enhancements" will produce an unpleasant<br>in-your-face edginess and dryness when heard <br>over headphones.<br>Thus, you must decide which source you're<br>mixing for *before* you starting mastering<br>your CD or cassette.  Moreover, you must<br>stick with that decision. Nothing sounds<br>worse than one track of a CD optimized<br>for listening over speakers and another<br>optimized for listening over headphones.<br>--<br>The next issue is dynamic range. Headphones<br>take maximum advantage of a recording with<br>a large dynamic range, while speakers<br>cruelly punish a recording with vast dynamic<br>range. Over speakers, much of a xenharmonic<br>composition like William Schottstaedt's<br>"Water Music" is either inaudible or<br>ear-shattering...yet the same composition<br>becomes clearly audible when heard<br>over headphones.<br>A recording with large dynamic range pretty<br>much demands headphone listening (The<br>alternative is a whisper-quiet listening<br>environment with ultra-high-quality loudspeakers<br>in a place where the neighbors won't protest<br>jet-plane-takeoff sound levels. Very few<br>listeners have such a loudspeaker environment<br>available.).<br>Thus, wide dynamic-range xenharmonic recordings <br>intended to be heard over loudspeakers must,<br>as a practical matter, employ some compression.<br>Unfortunately, compression always changes the<br>sound of a composition. This is especially<br>noticeable in commercial pop music, where<br>the maximum dynamic range is about 5 dB.<br>In such recordings, changes in timbre take<br>the place of changes in loudness, and this<br>may require corresponding changes in <br>you orchestration of a piece of music with<br>a very wide dynamic range.<br>One salient point about compression:<br>it must be applied without regard for the<br>settings of the equipment, but with <br>concern only for whether the final result<br>approximates the original sound of the<br>live recording. My experience is that <br>drastic alterations are often required<br>to get a recording to sond like a live<br>performance.  Often, radical compression,<br>sonic enhancement, dynamic noise reduction<br>and gain riding are needed to produce a<br>recording which when heard over loudspeakers<br>approximates what you heard in live<br>performance.  Alas, loudspeakers are wildly<br>non-linear transducers whose measured response<br>curves bear no relation whatsoever to the<br>sound you hear.  (The reason is simple: graphs<br>of loudspeaker response vs. frequency give<br>data *only* on the magnitude of the frequency<br>response, *never* on phase response at that<br>frequency, and as Fourier's theorem tells us,<br>both magnitude *and* phase data are required<br>for a full reconstruction of the original <br>signal. Equally important, loudspeaker response<br>is measured in an anechoic chamber using a<br>microphone which stays in a fixed position <br>relative to the loudspeaker. In a real listening<br>situation, each listener will hear the loudspeaker<br>from a different position and in a different<br>sound-absorbing and sound-reflecting environment.<br>Thus, the graphs typically published in hi-fi<br>magazines are meaningless as an index of the<br>actual sound of a pair of loudspeakers. These<br>graphs are as ludicrous as a graph of the<br>reflectivity of 450 nm light from Rembrandt's<br>"The Night Watch" from a photomoter fixed 5<br>cm from the painting's surface as an indication <br>of the overall "look" of the entire painting.)<br>Each loudspeaker type (acoustic reflex,<br>ribbon, horn, electrostatic, etc.) and<br>each placement and each listening position<br>and set of amplifiers, recorders and preamps<br>produces a different overall "sound." <br>Using a vacuum tube amplifier as opposed to<br>a solid state amp will significantly change<br>the sound of a reproduced recording--changing the<br>loudspeakers from, say, Klipsch horns to <br>Magnaplanar IIIDs will transform the sound of<br>the recording to an almost unrecognizable<br>extent.<br>This brings up the issue of boom boxes. <br>Although it seems wildly insane, it remains<br>a fact that most of your prosepctive audience<br>will listen to the output of 50,000 dollar<br>computer music workstations or tens of thousands<br>of dollars of handcrafted xenharmonic instruments<br>or a roomful of microtonal synthesizers over 40 dollar<br>boom boxes. This is a development so weird<br>as to border on the psychotic, yet it<br>remains unquestionably true. Because of<br>the rush-rush-rush nature of our society,<br>most people listen to xenharmonic music<br>either on a boom box or in their car.<br>The best way to mix for this kind of<br>peculiar playback situation is on a<br>set of satellite loudspeakers with small<br>cheap tweeters and the subwoofer EQ'd<br>nearly off. This reproduces the extremely<br>poor frequency response and dynamic range<br>of the average boom box/car stereo.<br>A piece of microtonal music mixed for<br>boom box or car stereo playback must be<br>compressed to about 20 dB dynamic range.<br>Notice that this is not "20 dB of reduction<br>in dynamic range," I mean that the entire<br>range of the composition must be compressed<br>to fit within the 20 dB of useful dynamic<br>range available on the average cassette<br>deck. This means that if you start with<br>a composition which uses a dynamic range<br>of 96 dB in 16-bit linear DAT format, you<br>will have to compress the output of the<br>DAT recording by at least 76 dB since<br>(as we all know) most cassette decks<br>produce garbage output if the recording<br>level falls below -20 dB. Typical compressors<br>useful for most musical material include <br>the dbx 163x series.<br>This kind of bizarrely extreme 76 dB<br>compression will produce a large number of<br>unfortunate artifacts which cannot, alas,<br>be avoided.  The alternative is to refuse<br>to mix for cassette deck playback, which<br>means that your recording will (to most<br>people, whose hearing has been destroyed<br>by excessive volume levels and who seem<br>perfectly happy with the exercrable <br>sound reproduction afforded by a boom<br>box/car stereo) sound too reverberant,<br>indistinct or "muddy," and inaudible<br>throughout much of its length.<br>--<br>The next issue to bear in mind when <br>recording xenharmonic music is that<br>computer music requires an entirely<br>different mixing technique than <br>live music. Computer music typically<br>uses sine waves or other kinds<br>of synthetic tones that cut through <br>a listener's head like a knife;<br>typical recording levels for a<br>xenharmonic piece of computer music<br>should be at least 20 dB lower than<br>for live music. This is a classic<br>case of the Fletcher-Munson curve<br>at work, and when mixing computer<br>music you should always ignore<br>the meter levels.  Instead, play<br>back a live piece periodically<br>to get a general loudness comparison<br>and set the levels with complete<br>disregard for the meter readings.<br>--<br>Lastly, there remains the issue of Dolby<br>encoding. As Dolby Labs has admitted,<br>the Dolby decoding circuits of most<br>cassette decks are badly miscalibrated<br>at the factory, or simply left uncalibrated<br>entirely. If you doubt this, ask yourself:<br>when was the last time you saw an audio<br>techician or a sound man with a Dolby B<br>calibration tape?<br>Try: "never."<br>As a result, the poorly calibrated Dolby B<br>decoding circuits in most cassette decks<br>turn Dolby encoded recordings into mush.<br>When poorly adjusted, Dolby B acts as a<br>drastic low-pass filter.  And since<br>virtually all cassette decks use <br>uncalibrated or misadjusted Dolby B<br>encoding/decoding circuitry, this means<br>that the best solution is always to<br>*AVOID* Dolby encoding.<br>Dolby C works well if the same cassette<br>deck is used to play back the tape as<br>was used for recording. Otherwise,<br>Dolby C produces wretched artifacts.<br>In effect Dolby C is so cassette-deck-<br>specific as to prove useless in the real<br>world.  <br>Dolby Spectral encoding is an excellent<br>method of noise reduction which, alas,<br>is featured on almost no casette decks<br>because the fools at Dolby Labs overpriced<br>the technology outrageously on its <br>introduction. When DAT arrived, it proved<br>far cheaper than adding Dolby S to existing<br>30 ips reel machines, and so Dolby S never<br>caught on. Yet another example of "how<br>not to introduce new technology."<br>--<br>Because Dolby encoding (even when adjusted<br>with a factory-authorized calibration tape)<br>inevitably produces many unacceptable <br>artifacts in the source material during<br>playback, some hiss will be evident in all<br>your recordings (since any sane person will<br>avoid Dolby encoding like the plague). This<br>means that it's vital to push the levels<br>of the recording as high as they'll go during <br>cassette dubbing so as to minimize noise<br>during playback.<br>In my experience, the most important element<br>in a cassette dubbing chain is the source<br>quality--preferably DAT--and after that, the <br>cassette deck. This means that you will get far<br>more bang out of your bucks by spending them<br>on a good cassette deck than on a ton of<br>signal enhancement gear.<br>It remains a fact, alas, that Nakamichi still<br>makes the best cassette decks around. Avoid<br>the high-end Nakamichi decks and buy the<br>cheapest new model available. The high-end<br>Nakamichi cassette decks do such a freakishly<br>good job of reproducing the execrable audio<br>signal on the crappy cassette format that a <br>Nakamichi Dragon (for example) will delude<br>you into EQ'ing the high end of your recording<br>down much lower than it should be.<br>The best way to test your recording is to<br>make the copy on a Nakamichi deck and play it<br>back on a crappy K-Mart boom box, since this <br>is the way virtually everyone will listen to<br>your recordings.  Such grotesquely poor<br>quality playback will quickly bring to light<br>any EQ or reverb problems with the master<br>recording--generally you'll have to EQ<br>the high end up or add considerable amounts<br>of BBE or Aphex enhancement to make up for<br>the fact that the average boom box has<br>less bandwidth that a typical telephone.<br>The analog compact cassette might not be<br>the world's lowest-fidelity recording<br>medium; it's possible that Edison wax<br>cylinder recordings sounded worse. However,<br>this question remains open. It is possible<br>that the analog copmact cassette does actually<br>the worst possible audio fidelity of any<br>recording medium ever invented.<br>Regardless of the outcome of that issue,<br>it remains an obscene and outrageous fact<br>that we will reach the 21st century with<br>most people listening to microtonal music<br>on ultra-lo-fi analog audio cassettes<br>with lots of hiss, plenty of wow and<br>flutter, and enormous amount of distortion.<br>Thus it behooves us all to produce the best<br>possible cassette recordings of microtonal music...<br>a task akin to producing the best possible<br>buggy whips we can make.
