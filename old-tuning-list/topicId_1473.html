Here is the idea.  Suppose<br>that you are primarily interested in two intervals.  Classically<br>you might think of r11 and r22, but any pair will serve.  Then<br>you might think of dividing one of these intevals into equal<br>parts so as to produce a good approximation of the second.  To<br>decide how many parts leads you to the irrational quantity<br>qog r1)/(log r2) which you must then approximate by a rational<br>number.

I computed qg(r1)/log(r2) for every<br>r1 and r2 (in lowest terms) with denominator up to 10<br>and numerator not more then 10 greater then denominator.<br>Then I sorted the table by the magnitude of q.  Finally<br>I computed the difference between consecutive lines in order<br>to look for good isotempered pairs.  The table includes<br>the continued fraction partial quotients of each q.
