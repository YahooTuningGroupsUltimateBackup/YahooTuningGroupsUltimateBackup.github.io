My name is Pat Missin and I play several instruments, but my main<br>weapon is the humble harmonica, or rather many different harmonicas, which I<br>play in a variety of traditional and avant guarde styles. For the last ten<br>years or so, I have also worked on the repair and modification (mostly of my<br>own harps, for reasons of poverty and their ever-increasing price), but I<br>also service them for other people.<br><br>Most of my instruments are diatonic and I set them up in just, or slightly<br>tempered tuning, but some of them pose a few problems. Like the harmonium<br>that Helmholtz et al, used for their experiments, the harmonica produces<br>very strong combinational tones, some of which can sound quite unpleasant,<br>even on a well tuned harp. These tones are often unbearable on an equal<br>tempered harmonica, such as the standard chromatic instrument.<br><br>For those of you who do not know, the chromatic harmonica is based around<br>repeating groups of four holes, each with a blow note and a draw note. The<br>blow notes in each group are C, E, G, C and the draw notes are D, F, A, B.<br>When a button is pressed, another set of reeds is brought into play, tuned a<br>semitone above the first set, allowing a complete chromatic scale. (Actually<br>there are a few duplicated notes in each octave E# as well as F; B# as well<br>as C, but in equal temperament, these are to all intents and purposes F and<br>C.) The blow notes seem to cry out for a just major triad (on C and C#), but<br>the draw chord poses a bit more of a problem. D, F, A and B tuned as a G7<br>without a root, sounds great as a full chord in the key of C, but the<br>septimal seventh causes the individual intervals to sound horrible in, for<br>example, the key of F.<br><br>When the chromaatic is played in many different keys, I guess equal is an<br>obvious choice, but many players (Irish folk players, for example) use it as<br>a modal instrument, using the semitone button for ornamentations, but<br>sticking to a few closely related keys (in the case of Irish music on a C<br>harmonica, the favored modes would be C ionian, G ionian and mixolydian, D<br>aeolian and dorian). The presence of the notes D, F and A in the draw chord<br>suggest that it should be tuned towards D minor or F major. I've tried<br>various meantone ideas, but I wondered if any of you out there have any<br>other suggestions (other than "buy a synthesiser...").<br><br>Also, if you play all the notes on a C chromatic,  you get the folowing<br>sequence: C, C#, D, D#, E, E#, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, B#, C and C#; the<br>next octave starting again from C. That's sixteen notes to the octave - this<br>must suggest some ideas to someone out there - please let me know.<br><br>Pat Missin.<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 8 Jul 1996 07:49 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA12559; Sun, 7 Jul 1996 22:49:44 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 7 Jul 1996 22:49:44 -0700<br>Message-Id: <01I6T9SX43KI8YG49L@delphi.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>TUNING THE HARMONICA</h1><h3><a id=3171 href="#3171">ðŸ”—</a>Pat Missin &#x3C;patm@globalnet.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/1996 4:07:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>As a new subscriber to the tunings list, I guess I'd better introduce<br>myself.
