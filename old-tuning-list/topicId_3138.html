I picked up an Egyptian Oud recently that uses  <br>mother-of-pearl and laquer (sp?) on the fingerboard, and different from  <br>the lute, is performed with a plectrum (traditionally an Eagles feather)  <br>to double-pick in a very impulsive fashion.

I picked up an Egyptian Oud recently that uses  <br>mother-of-pearl and laquer (sp?) on the fingerboard, and different from  <br>the lute, is performed with a plectrum (traditionally an Eagles feather)  <br>to double-pick in a very impulsive fashion. With the right tension  <br>strings, you get a very clear tone without buzz because of the amount of  <br>energy imparted into the string. You do need to be "fretting" on the  <br>very tip of the finger, I must try the sarangi fingernail stopping.  <br>Interestingly, there is not a saddle like in a guitar.<br><br>I bought it because I liked the sound and felt it would aid playing  <br>alternative tunings, without having to build or commission a special  <br>guitar, resetting sliding frets etc, and could draw on lutherie  <br>experience of a traditionally fretless, plucked instrument. I hope over  <br>time it will aid training my intonational sense.<br><br>I was interested to read the Oud in the past has used frets, does  <br>someone have a reference or examples? Other Levant instruments like the  <br>Saz and Tar use tied on frets, which of course the Lute has used, the  <br>Bouzouki and I believe it's arabic cousin, the Buzuk, use hammered in  <br>frets.<br>---<br>Leigh                 Computer Science, University of Western Australia<br>Smith                 +61-8-9380-3778 leigh@cs.uwa.edu.au (NeXTMail/MIME)<br><br>Microsoft - never has so much been made by so few, by pushing so much  <br>of so little, on so many with so little resistance.</div>
