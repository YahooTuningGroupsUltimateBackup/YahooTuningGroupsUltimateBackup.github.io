Throughout his <br>               life he wrote lectures and essays that dealt with virtually <br>               every aspect of East European folk music. Many of those essays,<br>               previously scattered in specialty journals in four different <br>               languages, are collected here for the first time. All are <br>               concerned with that branch of musicology within which Bartok <br>               was most influential, and for which he is best known: research <br>               into folk music, or ethnomusicology. The volume includes a <br>               preface by editor Benjamin Suchoff, a leading expert on <br>               Bartok's music and writings. Suchoff examines Bartok's <br>               developing views on the folk-music traditions of Hungary, <br>               Romania, Slovakia, and the Arab world.<br>NOTE         Includes bibliographical references and index.<br>SUBJECTS     Folk music -- Europe, Eastern -- History and criticism.<br>             Folk dance music -- Europe, Eastern -- History and criticism.<br>OTHER AUTHOR Suchoff, Benjamin.<br>OTHER TITLE  Studies in ethnomusicology.<br>ISBN         0803242476 (cloth : alk. paper)<br><br>TITLE        Sammelbande fur vergleichende Musikwissenschaft / hrsg. von Carl <br>               Stumpf und Erich Moritz von Hornbostel.<br>EDITION      Nachdr. d.

I'm surprised that the list didn't mention the really huge (something like<br>seven-volume!) collection of Hungarian folk melodies that Bartok and Kodaly jointly<br>produced. I know this stuff because a) the materials are in the Florida State<br>University library (where I studied), b) I happen to be an ethnomusicologist and<br>pianist (and love Bartok's music), and c) my piano teacher, Edward Kilenyi, knew<br>Bartok personally. By the way, Bartok's extremely meticulous notations are not so<br>easy to read; he was very precise in how he heard and wrote down everything, and his<br>system of symbols for microtones (and other "non-standard" musical phenomena) seems<br>quite arcane, until you get used to it.All The Best,<br>Dr_Orient</div><h3><a id=8283 href="#8283">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;manynote@library.wustl.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/1998 7:17:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Fri, 24 Jul 1998, Dr_Orient wrote:<br>> Professor Hahn's list is good,<br><br>Hey, a promotion!

Throughout his <br>               life he wrote lectures and essays that dealt with virtually <br>               every aspect of East European folk music. Many of those essays,<br>               previously scattered in specialty journals in four different <br>               languages, are collected here for the first time. All are <br>               concerned with that branch of musicology within which Bartok <br>               was most influential, and for which he is best known: research <br>               into folk music, or ethnomusicology. The volume includes a <br>               preface by editor Benjamin Suchoff, a leading expert on <br>               Bartok's music and writings. Suchoff examines Bartok's <br>               developing views on the folk-music traditions of Hungary, <br>               Romania, Slovakia, and the Arab world.<br>NOTE         Includes bibliographical references and index.<br>SUBJECTS     Folk music -- Europe, Eastern -- History and criticism.<br>             Folk dance music -- Europe, Eastern -- History and criticism.<br>OTHER AUTHOR Suchoff, Benjamin.<br>OTHER TITLE  Studies in ethnomusicology.<br>ISBN         0803242476 (cloth : alk. paper)<br><br>TITLE        Sammelbande fur vergleichende Musikwissenschaft / hrsg. von Carl <br>               Stumpf und Erich Moritz von Hornbostel.<br>EDITION      Nachdr. d.

I'm surprised that the list didn't mention the really huge (something like<br>seven-volume!) collection of Hungarian folk melodies that Bartok and Kodaly jointly<br>produced. I know this stuff because a) the materials are in the Florida State<br>University library (where I studied), b) I happen to be an ethnomusicologist and<br>pianist (and love Bartok's music), and c) my piano teacher, Edward Kilenyi, knew<br>Bartok personally. By the way, Bartok's extremely meticulous notations are not so<br>easy to read; he was very precise in how he heard and wrote down everything, and his<br>system of symbols for microtones (and other "non-standard" musical phenomena) seems<br>quite arcane, until you get used to it.All The Best,<br>Dr_Orient</div><h3><a id=8283 href="#8283">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;manynote@library.wustl.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/1998 7:17:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Fri, 24 Jul 1998, Dr_Orient wrote:<br>> Professor Hahn's list is good,<br><br>Hey, a promotion!
