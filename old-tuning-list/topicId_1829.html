V7 resolves well to vi (minor) as well (i.e. up a major<br>second), and the augmented sixth chord (e.g. g - b - d - e#) - which is<br>another chord that I think would be incorrectly represented by a 4-5-6-7<br>tuning - resolves most effectively to a major or minor chord a *minor<br>second* below.<br><br>The stepwise resolution of the intervals making up the tritone in both<br>these chords is, I believe, the *critical* factor which determines their<br>resolution.<br><br><br>>                                           When a dominant seventh chord is<br>> suspended for a classical cadenza, it suffers little when tuned as 4:5:6:7<br>> and indeed, the stability of the chord enhances its contrast with the tonic<br>> triad. On the other hand, the suspension of a 16/9 (or 9/5) as the seventh<br>> introduces a tone dissonant to the rest of the chord, but not foreign to<br>> the scale.<br><br>If a dominant 7th chord is suspended for a while, then I think a case<br>can be made for a 4-5-6-7 tuning just to soften the dissonance, but then<br>how does the soloist tune his fourth scale note?

Can a singer, for instance, really be<br>expected to pitch the former interval accurately when the latter is so<br>common and so well-defined. In my experience 21/16 expressed as a<br>melodic interval sounds like an out-of-tune 4/3 (in the context of<br>common-practice tonal music).<br><br>> One often-raised objection to the septimal tuning is the narrow semitone<br>> (21/20) voice leading from the seventh to the third of the tonic.
