In fact, switching tunings on a channel during a sustained<br>note causes its pitch to change instantly, which I find a little<br>inconvenient.  I wish it would only apply the changed tuning to subsequently<br>triggered notes.

I could see that if the tables ran from<br>A-G#, but they don't - they run from C-B; that can make it clumsy to use the<br>ROM tunings as a starting place for a user scale, or to combine user and<br>factory tunings.<br><br>It *might* be possible to take advantage of a wider pallete of tunings by<br>sending SysEx data from the MIDI file during playback.
