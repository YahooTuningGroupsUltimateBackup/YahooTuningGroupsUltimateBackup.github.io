My formal musical<br>education is extremely small.  I taught myself the rudiments of music<br>theory from an old text book, and read Piston's book on orchestration<br>many many times.  I did pass O-level music as a spare time subject<br>when I was 16, but I did not do this very well.<br><br>My background is mathematics, with particular interest in logic.  My<br>first degree was Mathematics, but then I changed to computing which is<br>so much easier.  My PhD, 25 years ago, was in algebraic software and<br>its application to gravity waves and cosmology.  Since then I have<br>been an academic at 3 UK universities and at Salt Lake City.  I<br>continue to work in computer algebra and have retired from astronomy<br>on the death of my guru a couple of years back.  I have branched out<br>into parallel computing, and compilation, as well as tank warfare<br>simulation.<br><br>So what has this to do with Tuning?  Not much.  What I did not say in<br>that short biography is that I have been writing music at least since<br>aged 7 or 8, and as a teenager I struggled to write a piano concerto.<br>At university, in the face of professional musicians (my college had<br>an internationally known choir) I stopped trying, although I still<br>wanted to.  I continued being interested in music; increasingly<br>medaeval and post 1950-classical, and am a frequent attender at modern<br>music concerts.  With the faster computers (I began on valve computers<br>(tubes to North Americans) in the 1950s) I found Csound and ported it<br>to the PC, originally so I could return to composing.  I never learnt<br>to play a keyboard and so had no way of hearing my notated music.  <br><br>After a net-discussion with a guy called Ted Fitch (no relation) I<br>took part of his advice to break myself of writing terrible pseudo<br>Victorian tunes, and moved to non 12ET.  I have actually finished one<br>work in this style, before I discovered all this errudition on kust<br>and alternative tuning systems.  I continue to lurk here as I am<br>lamentably ignorant about so much, and many messages I simply fail to<br>understand.  I have not even grasped the underlying mathematics of<br>many posts.  So I suspect that I am not much use to the attempt to<br>pool knpwledge.<br><br>What I suppose I do know about is the use of Csound to realise<br>sounds.  The system has no problems with pitches, and is clearly<br>easier to tune than MIDI synths.  In a few minutes I intend to add new<br>features to make it even easier -- at least for equal tempaments.
