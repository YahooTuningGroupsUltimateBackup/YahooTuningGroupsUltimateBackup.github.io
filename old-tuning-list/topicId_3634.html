That key therefore produces a Bq#.<br>4.  A key next to the left fourth-finger G# key, which opens the hole of the<br>    pierced G# key thereby playing a Gq#.<br>5.  A key above the low D# that opens a separate, small hole on the opposite<br>    side of the tube from the low D# pad.  That of course is for a Dq#.<br><br>   It does not have any provisions for quartertones below the low D, nor in<br>the realm of the upper C#-D or C#-D# trill keys.  I also don't know how<br>they deal with quartertones in the higher registers, but presumably that's<br>just a matter of coming up with additional fingerings as would be necessary<br>anyway.</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>24TET Flute</h1><h3><a id=7916 href="#7916">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>5/25/1998 8:58:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I just got back from a flute convention/festival in Denton.
