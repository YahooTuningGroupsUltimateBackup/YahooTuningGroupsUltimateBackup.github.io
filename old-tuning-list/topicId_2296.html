It seems surprising because of the answer to your second<br>question:<br><br><br><br>>Strikes me a tuning FAQ ought to address the question, are integer overtone<br>>series natural or artificial, where do they come from?<br><br>   Harmonic partials come from vibrating systems with uniform and elastic<br>vibrating media bound by two immobile "nodes".  The most obvious example is<br>a vibrating string, the two nodes being the nut (or fret) and bridge.<br>Those systems can set up "standing waves", which resonate strictly at<br>harmonically-related frequencies.<br><br>   I would think that most seismic waves would not fit this model at all,<br>but instead would vibrate along the effectively infinite expanse of the<br>crust of the Earth.  But getting back to musical instruments...<br><br>   Systems that produce nonharmonic partials don't follow that scheme at<br>all, an example being a drum head.  Systems that produce NEAR-harmonic<br>partials almost always have that essential scheme, but the perfection of<br>one element or another is compromised.  High-register piano strings for<br>example, are not entirely harmonic because they are very stiff, and thus<br>compromise the elasticity requirement.<br><br>   Most wind instruments somewhat compromise the absoluteness of the nodal<br>points.  The vibrating medium, air itself, is an almost ideal (in this<br>sense of the word) vibrating medium unlike the high-register piano string.<br>The physical basis for this is somewhat more complicated to describe, so<br>bear with me here:<br><br>   In wind instruments, the wave is easiest viewed as an air-pressure wave<br>traveling along the axis of the tube, the nodes being the points where the<br>air-column is exposed to the open atmosphere.  At those points the air<br>pressure can't fluctuate very much.  Why?  Because, unlike within the tube<br>where the air molecules' movement is restricted to the confines of the<br>tube, any attempt to pressurize them in the open atmosphere will be<br>immediately thwarted by their freedom to move so as to disperse that<br>pressure.<br><br>   The compromise to the absoluteness of the nodes occurs right at the<br>opening to the atmosphere.  It's called an open-end effect, and it gets<br>even more complicated with woodwind-style toneholes.  The air molecules'<br>movement isn't sufficiently unrestricted to form a pure node until they get<br>somewhat outside the tube.  How far outside the tube they have to be<br>depends upon a great many factors including the geometry of the tube (e.g.,<br>its diameter and whether it's cylindrical or conical), the amplitude of the<br>wave moving them, and yes, the frequency of that wave as well.<br><br>   For a purely cylindrical tube like you'd find on a fife, the effective<br>nodal point is fairly predictable, lying outside the end of the tube about<br>0.6 times the diameter of the tube.  A flared bell like brass instruments<br>have tends to blur the exact placement of that nodal point much more than a<br>simple cut in the tube.  The effective vibrating length of the air column<br>therefore varies a bit more between harmonics in brasses than in woodwinds<br>or strings.<br><br>   But, as I've mentioned before on this list, I have quite a bit of direct<br>experience with the tones of orchestral instruments forced to exact<br>harmonic overtone structures, and I think it's important that these are -<br>in the big scheme of things - fairly subtle differences.  They are of the<br>magnitude that distinguishes a good simulation of an instrument from a bad<br>one, not ANYWHERE NEAR the sort that distinguishes, say, a flute from<br>trumpet.<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Denis.Atadan@mvs.udel.edu<br>Subject:  Tape Swap is like Soyulent Green<br>PostedDate:  11-08-97 20:50:23<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  11-08-97 20:50:22-11-08-97 20:50:23,11-08-97 20:48:47-11-08-97 20:48:47<br>DeliveredDate:  11-08-97 20:48:47<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564F0.00677A35; Mon, 11 Aug 1997 20:50:14 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08079; Mon, 11 Aug 1997 20:50:23 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 11 Aug 1997 20:50:23 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08075<br>Received: (qmail 21399 invoked from network); 11 Aug 1997 18:46:28 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 11 Aug 1997 18:46:28 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199708101900.PAA03640@copland.udel.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5956 href="#5956">ðŸ”—</a>James Kukula &#x3C;kukula@synopsys.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/12/1997 1:44:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>> Furthermore, a system with one<br>>>degree of freedom is pretty much constrained to move in a periodic fashion,<br>>>at least for bounded trajectories.<br>><br>>This would be true for autonomous systems -- that is, where the<br>>state of the system depends entirely upon its previous state,<br>>and not explicitly on time.

It seems surprising because of the answer to your second<br>question:<br><br><br><br>>Strikes me a tuning FAQ ought to address the question, are integer overtone<br>>series natural or artificial, where do they come from?<br><br>   Harmonic partials come from vibrating systems with uniform and elastic<br>vibrating media bound by two immobile "nodes".  The most obvious example is<br>a vibrating string, the two nodes being the nut (or fret) and bridge.<br>Those systems can set up "standing waves", which resonate strictly at<br>harmonically-related frequencies.<br><br>   I would think that most seismic waves would not fit this model at all,<br>but instead would vibrate along the effectively infinite expanse of the<br>crust of the Earth.  But getting back to musical instruments...<br><br>   Systems that produce nonharmonic partials don't follow that scheme at<br>all, an example being a drum head.  Systems that produce NEAR-harmonic<br>partials almost always have that essential scheme, but the perfection of<br>one element or another is compromised.  High-register piano strings for<br>example, are not entirely harmonic because they are very stiff, and thus<br>compromise the elasticity requirement.<br><br>   Most wind instruments somewhat compromise the absoluteness of the nodal<br>points.  The vibrating medium, air itself, is an almost ideal (in this<br>sense of the word) vibrating medium unlike the high-register piano string.<br>The physical basis for this is somewhat more complicated to describe, so<br>bear with me here:<br><br>   In wind instruments, the wave is easiest viewed as an air-pressure wave<br>traveling along the axis of the tube, the nodes being the points where the<br>air-column is exposed to the open atmosphere.  At those points the air<br>pressure can't fluctuate very much.  Why?  Because, unlike within the tube<br>where the air molecules' movement is restricted to the confines of the<br>tube, any attempt to pressurize them in the open atmosphere will be<br>immediately thwarted by their freedom to move so as to disperse that<br>pressure.<br><br>   The compromise to the absoluteness of the nodes occurs right at the<br>opening to the atmosphere.  It's called an open-end effect, and it gets<br>even more complicated with woodwind-style toneholes.  The air molecules'<br>movement isn't sufficiently unrestricted to form a pure node until they get<br>somewhat outside the tube.  How far outside the tube they have to be<br>depends upon a great many factors including the geometry of the tube (e.g.,<br>its diameter and whether it's cylindrical or conical), the amplitude of the<br>wave moving them, and yes, the frequency of that wave as well.<br><br>   For a purely cylindrical tube like you'd find on a fife, the effective<br>nodal point is fairly predictable, lying outside the end of the tube about<br>0.6 times the diameter of the tube.  A flared bell like brass instruments<br>have tends to blur the exact placement of that nodal point much more than a<br>simple cut in the tube.  The effective vibrating length of the air column<br>therefore varies a bit more between harmonics in brasses than in woodwinds<br>or strings.<br><br>   But, as I've mentioned before on this list, I have quite a bit of direct<br>experience with the tones of orchestral instruments forced to exact<br>harmonic overtone structures, and I think it's important that these are -<br>in the big scheme of things - fairly subtle differences.  They are of the<br>magnitude that distinguishes a good simulation of an instrument from a bad<br>one, not ANYWHERE NEAR the sort that distinguishes, say, a flute from<br>trumpet.<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Denis.Atadan@mvs.udel.edu<br>Subject:  Tape Swap is like Soyulent Green<br>PostedDate:  11-08-97 20:50:23<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  11-08-97 20:50:22-11-08-97 20:50:23,11-08-97 20:48:47-11-08-97 20:48:47<br>DeliveredDate:  11-08-97 20:48:47<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564F0.00677A35; Mon, 11 Aug 1997 20:50:14 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08079; Mon, 11 Aug 1997 20:50:23 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 11 Aug 1997 20:50:23 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08075<br>Received: (qmail 21399 invoked from network); 11 Aug 1997 18:46:28 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 11 Aug 1997 18:46:28 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199708101900.PAA03640@copland.udel.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5956 href="#5956">ðŸ”—</a>James Kukula &#x3C;kukula@synopsys.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/12/1997 1:44:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>> Furthermore, a system with one<br>>>degree of freedom is pretty much constrained to move in a periodic fashion,<br>>>at least for bounded trajectories.<br>><br>>This would be true for autonomous systems -- that is, where the<br>>state of the system depends entirely upon its previous state,<br>>and not explicitly on time.
