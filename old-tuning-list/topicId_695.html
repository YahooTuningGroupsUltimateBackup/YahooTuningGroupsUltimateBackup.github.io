Thanks, Hstick<br><br>Sorry, Neil, I was a bit free with my use of 'free'.  I meant it not in the<br>sense as in "free jazz", but a more societal "free", where people felt a<br>freedom between and amongst themselves, sharing all things (i.e. love,<br>music, etc.).  The freedom (implied or conjured up) during the Flower Power<br>decade, at least on paper, has a feel akin to the freedom (of info, from<br>regulation, etc.) that exists in part in the online community these days<br>(didn't 'The Well' spring up during those days as a community-based computer<br>resource?).

I hope I was clear that I didn't harbor<br>thoughts of ill-intent on Ben's part; I really am more puzzled (curious)<br>than upset at him (Kronos is another story).
