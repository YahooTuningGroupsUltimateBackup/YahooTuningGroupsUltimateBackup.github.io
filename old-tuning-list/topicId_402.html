The instruments are<br>kept behind glass (so you can't touch them), nevertheless you can still get a<br>very close view of them.  I have heard the Partch instruments in concert only<br>once (with a marred sound system), but this was my first opportunity to see any<br>of them up close and personal.  This exhibition is entitled "Metal Earth Wood<br>Styrofoam = Music" and runs until May 4.  It's free and open to the public<br>during normal library hours.<br><br>My understanding is that the rest of the Partch instruments are now residing at<br>Purchase College (part of SUNY) in Westchester County (New York) under the care<br>of Dean Drummond.
