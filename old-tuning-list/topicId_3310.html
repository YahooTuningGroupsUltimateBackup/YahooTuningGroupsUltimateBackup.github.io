The music is by<br>Tohru Takemitsu, and I believe it to be non-12--lots of sweeping, eerie<br>strings, etc.  It's an absolutely beautiful movie, too.  I couldn't<br>recommend it more.<br><br>I'm relatively new this list, and I find myself struggling to understand<br>the complexities of microtonality and the terminology you all use (I<br>don't have hardly any formal music training), but I always glean<br>something from the posts.
