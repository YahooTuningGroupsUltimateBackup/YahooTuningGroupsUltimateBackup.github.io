I apologize to Ken and any list members who had to listen<br>to it.<br><br>        On the question of fretted versus fretless basses for microtonal<br>music, for just intonation fretless is great, as you can tune to the beats<br>in real time. For equal tempered music the fretted bass is certainly<br>easier to start with, as the intervals take some getting used to. A<br>lined fretless is ideal if one has the resources to have a different<br>instrument for each tuning. At the first Microstock Microtonal Music<br>Concert I heard a cello played very well in 19tet, so with a great ear a<br>lined instrument is not necessary (although I am not giving up my lines).<br><br>John Starrett<br>http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Ken Wauchope's music</h1><h3><a id=7163 href="#7163">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/1998 10:26:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>All-<br>        I accidentally screwed up some of Ken Wauchope's MIDI work, "O vos<br>omnes" by Carlo Gesualdo which he performed and tuned to 1/3 comma<br>meantone.
