Moeck No 2084, Moeck <br>Verlag Celle. <br><br>I just recieved my copy, and it looks excellent.  All examples <br>are for conventional alto recorder, it includes a separate fingering <br>chart,  numerous 1/4 tone exercises,  a short work by Donald Bousted, <br>and a list of about 30 existing 1/4 tone compositions for <br>(or including) recorders.<br><br>Its about 50 pages altogether - and costs =A35 quid (pounds sterling) - <br>which is very good value.<br><br>2) Heard on the grapevine that Roland will release the S7700  in the <br>last quarter of  98 - a mega sampler/synth which combines the S7xx <br>sampler series with the JV1xxx synth - expandable to 128 Mb RAM. <br>I will certainly contact Roland to discuss its microtonal <br>capabilities, particularly the ideas of (1) on-board absulute pitch <br>meter (2) macro setup facilities for non-standard patches (3) the <br>number of 'partials' (key-groups) etc.<br><br>Anyone else interested in knocking on their door with microtonal <br>ideas?   <br><br>3) Akai will release the S6000 (?) at about the same time.

Auto tune rack is simple <br>to operate but extremely powerful in operation.  It comes complete <br>with pre-set scales, incl. major, minor and chromatic (DUUHH!) in any <br>key.  Want to make your own scales?  No problem, simply define any <br>combination of notes as a custom scale......... if you don't want <br>pitch correction to affect vibrato, slides, bends, etc you can simply <br>set Auto-Tune to ignore them  <br>*******END SALES BLURB**********<br><br>I've no idea whether this thing is any good, or how the custom scales <br>configuration works, but I can think of a number of applictions in <br>which this kind of thing might be useful to tuning-ers.</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Miscellaneous news</h1><h3><a id=7970 href="#7970">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Patrick Ozzard-Low&#x22; &#x3C;patrick.ozzard-low.itex@norfolk.gov.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/1998 10:48:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Dear Tuning -<br><br>some items of interest:<br><br>1) Just published: THE QUARTER-TONE RECORDER MANUAL by Kathryn <br>Bennetts, Donald Boustead and Peter Bowman.
