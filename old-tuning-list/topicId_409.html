JiCalc 4.2 runs under Hypercard <br>2.0 or above on the Mac. It is shareware and is available both from <br>the Mills ftp site and from the Just Intonation Network. Hypercard <br>readers do not appear to support all of the JiCalc functions, so the<br>HC 2.X application is essential to use these files.<br> <br>The files are JCA.sit.hqx, JCB.sit.hqx, JCC.sit.hqx, TC.sit.hqx and <br>a short non-binhex encoded readme file, JC/TC_README. The files may be <br>uncompressed and decoded with Expander, Unstuffit or similar programs.<br> <br>JCA and JCB have 400 tunings each and JCC 396. The TC file has 590<br>entries, most of them from my book, "Divisions of the Tetrachord." <br>The uncompressed and decoded files may be read with any word processor <br>or inserted into a JiCalc stack with the READALL command. I recommend <br>using multiple stacks renamed for each file, at least on the older, <br>slower Mac's. <br> <br>The scales are a mixture of JI, tetrachordal, CPS, tritriadic, tempered,<br>McLarenish, etc. and are not always fully documented as they represent <br>various research interests of mine over the last 8 or 9 years. Because <br>some early versions of JiCalc did not permit one to annotate entries, <br>some entries are rather cryptic. However, I think most will be of <br>interest to at least some of the Tuning List readers.<br> <br>In JiCalc, all scales, equally-tempered, non-octaval, non-Just, non-ET, <br>etc. must be expressed as ratios, either exact or approximate in the <br>case of tempered or other irrational intervals. The approximations are <br>usually within 0.1 cent and were generated by the use of Carter Scholz's algorithm or by Viggo Brun's version of the well-known Euclidean algorithm <br>for approximating irrationals. <br> <br>These four files contain more or less the same tunings as Manuel Op de <br>Coul's SCALA, though in a different format as his program can combine <br>cents with ratios. This resemblance is not entirely accidental; Manuel <br>and I have been exchanging scales by email. His program, however, is more<br>than just a tuning editor.<br> <br>JiCalc may be used to tune a number of popular synthesizers, particularly <br>those made by Yamaha and Ensoniq. Full-keyboard tuning is supported and <br>scales do not have to repeat at the octave (or at all). Adding new scales <br>to JiCalc is easy and the program comes with a very good help file. <br> <br> <br>--John<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 8 Mar 1996 19:40 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id KAA15097; Fri, 8 Mar 1996 10:39:59 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 8 Mar 1996 10:39:59 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9603081301.A27607-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2644 href="#2644">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/1996 7:30:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>The Interval Foundation was headed up by Jonathan and Elizabeth Glasier.<br>Last I heard, their ph# was (609) 238-3593.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 9 Mar 1996 04:32 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id TAA28870; Fri, 8 Mar 1996 19:31:32 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 8 Mar 1996 19:31:32 -0800<br>Message-Id: <960309032727_71670.2576_HHB60-11@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2662 href="#2662">ðŸ”—</a>xen@tiac.net (J.
