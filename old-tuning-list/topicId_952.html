I've been working <br>extensively on 22-tet on keyboard -- although it shares many features with <br>12, it requires a new notation system, unlike 19. The quantity of notes and <br>ideas is approaching book size. Once John Starrett sends me a 22-tet guitar, <br>I'm sure my progress will accelerate (I'm not a pro keyboardist). Maybe our <br>books will appear side-by-side someday!<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 30 Sep 1996 20:39 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07608; Mon, 30 Sep 1996 19:39:40 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06273<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA08680; Mon, 30 Sep 1996 11:39:38 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 30 Sep 1996 11:39:38 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199609301838.LAA08594@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>RE: new book available</h1><h3><a id=3704 href="#3704">ðŸ”—</a>PAULE &#x3C;ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/1996 11:15:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Neil, congrats on your new book and here's hoping it gets the next <br>generation of guitarists interested in microtonality.
