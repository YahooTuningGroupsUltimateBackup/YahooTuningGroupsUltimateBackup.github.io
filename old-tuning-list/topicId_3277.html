I think you are suggesting a<br>> very important viewpoint and it would be interesting to contrast this with,<br>> for example, the broader use of 'microtonal' by Johnny Reinhard.<br><br>   I don't personally know if Johnny and I particularly disagree on this<br>question.  And I think it's largely a matter of opinion really.  And of<br>degree.<br><br>   But in general, I was making stating a broader opinion:  If a<br>composition is performed entirely on instruments that produce pitch<br>relationships very much unlike 12TET, then it's clearly microtonal.  If a<br>composition is performed in entirely 12TET, then it's clearly 12TET music.<br>But what happens between those two extremes?<br><br>   If it's performed in 12TET except for one note, then I'd perhaps call<br>that one note microtonal, but I would not call the entire composition<br>microtonal.  Actually, I'd be more likely to call that one note simply "out<br>of tune".<br><br>   If it's played on, say, a piano whose A=440Hz key is 25 cents flat, but<br>all of the others play right on 12TET, then we're starting toward<br>microtonality.  But I'd still be more inclined to say that the instrument<br>is out of tune than that the composition is microtonal.<br><br>   If ALL "A"s were 25 cents flat, then we're a lot closer to being clearly<br>microtonal.  That would show a specific, consistent, and systematic<br>microtuning statement.  At that point I'd reserve judgement on whether the<br>composition is microtonal based upon how often "A"s are used.  If "A"s are<br>never used, then it's clearly 12TET, but if the composition is clearly<br>tonal in the key of A major, then I'd call it unequivocally microtonal.<br>Where we sit between those two extremes is somewhat iffy.<br><br>   Now, all "A"s being 25 cents flat is a specific, consistent, and<br>systematic microtuning statement, but I kinda doubt if it's a very<br>meaningful such statement.  If we base our detunings upon an audibly<br>meaningful formula, like quarter-comma meantone for example, then the<br>resulting music is clearly microtonal.<br><br>   So then, let me comment on your examples:<br><br><br><br><br><br>>(1) Klarenz Barlo's<br>>_C,ogluotobu"sis,letmesi_ which for long stretches uses 8 pitch classes<br>>from 12tet, but gradually introduces the 4 remaining pitch classes tuned,<br>>however, a quartertone lower. ... Is this piece microtonal only when the<br>>lowered pitches appear<br><br>   That would be my take on it, except that...<br><br><br><br><br>>- or is it microtonal at all, since the pitches appear only in scalar<br>>contexts with all intervals larger than semitones?<br><br>   Given that, I'd say that if pitches from the first group of 8 notes<br>appear as harmonies to those additional four, then that section is clearly<br>microtonal.  If not, then I'd have to hear how much memory of the other 8<br>pitches remain in my mind as I listen to the other four.<br><br><br><br><br>>_Concerto In Slendro_ which uses two different anhemitonic pentatonics in<br>>5-limit Just Intonation. This piece is 'macrotonal'.<br><br>   By the way, I used the word "microtonal" in its general sense of<br>non-12TET, even though I, ideally, would use it only for tunings the<br>majority of whose smallest scale-step sizes are smaller than 100 cents.<br><br><br><br><br>>From my point of view,<br>>this could be considered microtonal only when the tuning is compared to<br>>some other tuning.<br><br>   I would call it microtonal (again in that broad sense of the word)<br>because that comparison point is inherently 12TET.  I would not, however,<br>call it nontraditional, because (based upon your description anyway), it<br>doesn't use any nontraditional pitch relationships (e.g., neutral thirds,<br>or septimals).  But it would in my mind be microtonal on the grounds that<br>it could be rendered in 12TET approximation, but it would not sound as<br>"clean" as JI would make it sound.<br><br><br><br><br>(3) The Carillo String Quartet, where a single<br>>quarter-tone lower pitch is introduced as the seventh of a chord. Is this<br>>enough to be considered 'systematic'?<br><br>   If it's performed that way consistently for all such seventh chords and<br>those chords appear frequently throughout the composition, then I'd call<br>that systematic, and the composition microtonal.  But again, if that chord<br>happens at only one spot in the music, then it more likely to be perceived<br>only as an out-of-tune note.<br><br><br><br><br>   Getting back to generalities, it all ultimately comes down to the<br>impression that the music leaves on the audience.  If only a handful of<br>notes noticeably deviate from 12TET, the audience will perceive there to be<br>a problem with those one notes rather than there being something unusual<br>about the entire composition.  Quite frankly, they'll probably perceive<br>those notes as performance errors.<br><br>   If however a great many of the pitches are shifted from what they expect<br>(12TET), they'll have no choice but to conclude that the performer is doing<br>this intentionally, and that there's some sort of musical expression behind<br>it.<br><br>   If the detunings are consistent and systematic, then the audience has<br>the potential to see a clear musical expression behind those detunings.  If<br>the detunings are pretty much random, then they'll see chaos behind the<br>detunings.  Expressing chaos isn't necessarily undesirable of course, but<br>the audience won't likely perceive any purpose or underlying meaning behind<br>the detunings.<br><br><br>   So, to me anyway, a broader and more fundamental, but much less concise,<br>criterion for whether a composition or portion of a composition is<br>microtonal, is whether the audience perceives the proverbial "method to<br>your madness".  The "madness" being analogous with non-12TET tuning, and<br>the "method" being what you're trying to express by using an unusual<br>tuning.  I have no doubt that an audience *may* perceive a meaning to a<br>handful of "off" pitches, but I also have no doubt that that's vastly less<br>likely than when you use them more frequently and consistently.</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>tuners in Los Angeles area</h1><h3><a id=7361 href="#7361">ðŸ”—</a>Greg Schiemer &#x3C;gregs@mail.usyd.edu.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/1998 3:50:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>G'day,<br><br>Just a message to say I'll be presenting a paper at the IEEE LANMAN98<br>workshop in Banff 17th-20th May and I've been offered a flight returning<br><br>to Sydney via Los Angeles.
