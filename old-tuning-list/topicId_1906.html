Hanson's death from Neil in his <br>post this morning. Larry was a brilliant and creative theorist <br>who had been collaborating with Ervin Wilson since 1978. In addition <br>to his championing 34-tet and commissioning the guitar that Neil plays <br>so well, Larry independently invented a unique type of generalized <br>keyboard in 1942 for his wife Evelyn, a concert pianist. Although his <br>keyboard  was also intended for 53-tone equal temperament, the design <br>was different from Bosanquet's. <br><br>After the war, he called Loren Hammond of the Hammond Organ Company, <br>who, alas, showed little interest. Larry put his notes aside until <br>1977, when his daughte Chris came across them while helping him <br>straighten up some files. In 1978, Chris saw an article about Tom Stone <br>and his interchangeable fingerboard guitar in Rolling Stones magazine. <br>This article led to a meeting with Ervin Wilson, who was immediately<br>enthusiastic about Hanson's design.  Ervin pointed out that Larry's <br>keyboard could be construed as based on a two-interval pattern (MOS) <br>generated by cycle of 19 minor thirds. <br><br>At Ervin's urging, Larry published a definitive article on the keyboard <br>in Xenharmonikon 12 (1989), when Daniel Wolf was the editor. Erv prepared <br>drawings which showed how various equal temperaments and several forms <br>of Just Intonation (the 13-limit Ogdoadic Diamond and two 5-limit <br>triadic arrays) could be mapped over the array of keys. At this time,<br>Larry also invented a new type of digital shaped like interlocking, <br>block "7's" to facilitate fingering.<br><br>Larry also maintained his interested in the purely theoretical side of<br>xenharmonics. He was extremely good at finding relevant articles on <br>number theory in the Cal Tech Library (from which graduated in 1942),<br>and he applied his mathematical ability and computational skills to<br>many theoretical problems in tuning theory, usually in collaboration<br>with Ervin Wilson. He was a great resource for the xenharmonic community<br>and he will be greatly missed by all of us who knew him and worked with<br>him.<br><br>--John<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 27 Mar 1997 18:53 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA19646; Thu, 27 Mar 1997 18:53:37 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA19643<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id JAA23669; Thu, 27 Mar 1997 09:52:04 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 27 Mar 1997 09:52:04 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B1E680E1E120E.7823@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5217 href="#5217">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/1997 2:36:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Let me be a bit more clear about the problem:<br><br>The problem - or virtue, depending upon your outlook - with cavity<br>resonators is that the volume of the cavity can accomodate a wide frequency<br>range as long as the opening is properly adjusted.<br><br>Bill Colvig just builds big boxes, starts with a small hole and keeps<br>widening it until he reaches the pitch he wants.
