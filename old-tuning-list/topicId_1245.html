This is the third time I've written this message;  CompuServe<br>Information Manager keeps kicking the bit-bucket on me.  This message only<br>though.  Weird...)<br><br>   First of all, let me acknowledge right off that Brian has experience with<br>more nonoctave tunings than I do.  My nonoctave experience is mostly limited to<br>88CET tuning, although my experience with 88CET is fairly significant.  <br><br><br>Regarding coming close to an octave being sufficient to elicit the feeling of<br>octave equivalence:<br>   I absolutely agree with that, but I'd like to add that it doesn't <br>   necessarily mean that it will sound like a CORRECT octave.  Best I've been <br>   able to see, speaking in very overgeneralized approximations, an interval<br>   within about 75 cents of an octave will sound like an octave rather than <br>   having a musical meaning of its own.  And if it's more than, say, 10 cents<br>   off from a proper 2:1, it will sound pretty dreadfully out of tune.  That <br>   too is a big overgeneralization, and both of those generalizations apply <br>   only to approximately-harmonic timbres.  <br><br>   On a related note, Paul E recently pointed out that neither he nor I have <br>   been able to get a pitch-classing effect from a P12 (3:1).  I may have<br>   inadvertently misrepresented my findings there.  That is certainly true <br>   when it comes to compounding intervals by a twelfth, meaning that I haven't<br>   been able to find much similarity between, for example, a major third and a<br>   major fourteenth.  I have, however, been able to get a sense much like that<br>   of leading-tone resolution to other intervals, including the P5.  In doing<br>   that though, I have to avoid the tuning's closest representations of an <br>   octave, because aluding to the octave almost immediately destroys the sense<br>   the P5, or whatever, is the most "basic" interval.  <br><br><br>Regarding Enrique Moreno's (or Brian's attribution of Enrique Moreno's) view<br>that using traditional interval nomenclature for non-octave tunings' pitch<br>relationships:<br>   I can certainly see value in avoiding them.  When I was in the throes of <br>   devising my 88CET notation system, I initially devised an 88CET-specific<br>   interval nomenclature, but later decided that there really wasn't a whole<br>   lot of value to it, and that it was more likely to confuse than enlighten.<br>   But certainly a strong case can be made for avoiding classifying some <br>   intervals in terms of traditional nomenclature.  9:7 is probably in that <br>   category, in that it somewhat stretches the boundary between thirds and <br>   fourths.  I find it to be more clearly a third than a fourth, but there are<br>   certainly some contexts where it clearly has a fourth-like sound.  One is<br>   the scenario where you let a pickup note rise by a 9:7 into the opening<br>   downbeat in a moderate-to-fast-tempo melody.  That is probably a case of <br>   social conditioning:  it probably gives that fourth-like sensation (or it <br>   often does for me anyway), because that's a VERY common melodic use for a <br>   P4.<br><br>   But that brings to mind the first of two caveats to accepting Enrique's <br>   view that traditional nomenclature shouldn't apply to nonoctave tunings.<br>   Is this sort of social conditioning (this sort of sensation is a third, <br>   this sensation is a fifth, etc.) hopeless to try to overcome?  It is <br>   certainly deeply engrained.  <br><br>   My other caveat is that this sort of motivation for not applying traditional<br>   interval nomenclature to non-octave tunings' resources is not in any <br>   specific to non-octave tunings.  Any tuning that 9:7s (again, as an example)<br>   may benefit from avoiding classifying that interval as a third or a fourth.<br>   If his concern in particular is that you need to come up with a new set of<br>   interval nomenclature based upon the interval and its non-octave duplicates<br>   (e.g., coming up with a name for the sensation of Pierce-Bohlen's 9:7 and <br>   its 3:1-displaced equivalent, then I personally would be skeptical about <br>   the value in that, because I have only managed to get a pitch-classing <br>   effect from other intervals in very limited ways.  But then again, that may<br>   be partly due to the fact that, like Carlos' Alpha and Beta tunings, 88CET<br>   doesn't really have a natural interval of repetition (although its 7:4, <br>   3:2, 5:2, and 8:1, in order of decreasing preference, are good candidates).<br><br><br>Regarding Brian's question about how one goes about determining a non-octave<br>tuning's most consonant interval:<br>   Brian approached the question, appropriately I'd say, in terms of what <br>   intervals work for doubling.  In that regard, I have found that intervals<br>   that work for doubling are heavily dependent upon the intervals in the <br>   original chord.  In particular, most any interval that is "bland" compared<br>   to the other intervals in the chord seems to work fairly well for doubling.<br>   Even intervals as flavorful as a 5:2 seem to produce a quite satisfactory<br>   doubling effect for chords whose harmonies are comparatively complex, like<br>   7:6s or 11:9s for example.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 24 Nov 1996 23:12 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06177; Sun, 24 Nov 1996 23:14:25 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06239<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id OAA22606; Sun, 24 Nov 1996 14:14:22 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 24 Nov 1996 14:14:22 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961124221020_71670.2576_HHB43-8@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Thoughts on Brian M's Non-Octave Thoughts</h1><h3><a id=4137 href="#4137">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@CompuServe.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/24/1996 2:13:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>(Gag!
