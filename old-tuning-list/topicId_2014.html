Wow, I think I started an avalanche.  By the<br>way, I noticed to my dismay that I had used "ET-x" rather than the standard<br>"x-tET" in the Subject box; thanks for not criticizing my amateurishness.<br> I'm gonna get a little bolder this time out, hoping for the same level of<br>graciousness from you all.<br><br>The best reason given so far, in my judgement, is compatibility with the vast<br>majority of other musicians and their instruments:<br><br>>I still use ancient 12-ET when writing for piano, winds, etc., in order to<br>get music >performed by the majority of musicians. (Brian Belet)<br><br>But, of course, that would only apply to 12-tET.  This being a list on<br>alternate tunings to 12-tET, naturally all the x-tET discussions posted are<br>of the other, non-standard types.  It's those that are causing me to stroke<br>my beard.<br><br>The reasons given for those seem to me to boil down to "just to be<br>different," e.g.:<br><br>>  1. The approximations of basic JI intervals also sound interesting in<br>their own right.<br>>  2. These tunings provide a new, nontraditional compositional paradigm.<br>(Gary Morrison)<br><br>>...their structures, and widely differing ones at that, make a fascinating<br>musical-->and yes, expressive--difference. (Paul Rapoport)<br><br>Superficially, that seems rather like climbing a mountain "because it was<br>there," an admirable goal.  I could be wrong, but isn't it more arbitrary<br>than that, more like climbing to any old peak in a range when you could just<br>as well have been the first to reach the top of the tallest one?  Exploration<br>is fine, and it's always exciting, but it tends to do the most good for the<br>most people when it's guided by goals that are formed with an understanding<br>of the fundamental natural principles related to whatever is being explored.<br> For example, it would be possible to explore the possibilities of building a<br>house from East to West, but it just makes a lot more sense to build from<br>bottom to top - it works better for a reason: it takes into account the<br>natural forces relevant to the situation.<br><br>There is a natural order to the way pitches are generated by the oscillating<br>vibrations of objects.  For thousands of years musicians world-wide have<br>sought to match their tunings to this order.  As I understand it, ET first<br>came about because technology was insufficiently developed to make keyboard<br>and fretted instruments that would provide enough justly tuned pitches to<br>allow further progress in the direction of polyphony, without being<br>prohibitively cumbersome to play and expensive to build.  Wouldn't the<br>musicians and theorists of the Rennaissance have stuck with JI if they could<br>have?  ET is a compromise, however many steps you use to divide the octave,<br>or any other interval.<br><br>But then, any tuning system involves compromises.  Paul R. made the following<br>point:<br><br>>... you have true enharmonic equivalent pitches and intervals in equal<br>>temperaments, which you may get in just systems only by fudging things<br>>theoretically.<br>><br>>Then there is the practical problem in just systems of treating all notes<br>potentially >the same way.<br><br>While true, I would contend that these are ET-specific issues.  We're all<br>used to taking advantage of enharmonics, and of having uniform distances<br>between repeating intervals, because we grew up with ET.  (Close encounters<br>of the m3 kind?  Sorry :-) Bet I'm not the first to come up with that, huh?)<br> But they are not necessary, I think, to good music.  Why try to force<br>compositional techniques from one tuning system into another?  More to the<br>point, in what way does enharmonicity correspond to the way that sound<br>behaves in nature or to human perception of it?  Correct me if I'm wrong, no<br>one has discovered any correspondence; it merely provides the convenient<br>organizing principle of sustaining or reusing a pitch within a changing<br>harmonic context; still rather arbitrary to me.<br><br>Besides, "been there, done that."  By the late 19th century the potential of<br>those relationships had been thoroughly exhausted; some would even argue that<br>J. S. Bach exhausted it by himself.  Sure, we can hear how those same kinds<br>of things happen when other roots of various intervals are taken.  It's<br>different.  But different is not necessarily better.<br><br>>... there are plenty of disadvantages to equal temperaments as well. None of<br>which >means they are superior or inferior to anything overall.  (Paul R.)<br><br>> ... a partly valid and partly faulty premise ... that the only goal in<br>tuning pitches is >to get as close as possible to just intonation.  (Gary<br>Morrison)<br><br>Actually, as you now can see, my premise for suspecting that JI may be<br>superior to ET is not that one tuning system is the basis of judging the<br>value of others, but that nature is the best basis of judging any tuning<br>system.  Not saying you must accept that premise - whether or not you do<br>probably depends on the amount of relativism in your world-view.  (Aye,<br>there's the rub.)  But if correspondence with natural forces/principles can<br>be agreed upon as the basis from which the value of a musical theory is<br>measured, is the pursuit of more resonant polyphony not a loftier goal?  I<br>see JI as a way of picking up where we left off (read "went astray") in the<br>15th century, and re-continuing development of Western music in the direction<br>it had been heading up to that point, with the tools to do the job right this<br>time.<br><br>Speaking of tools, I must also accept Marion 's correction:<br><br>>>Finally, technology is giving us keyboards with virtually<br>>>continuous pitch possibilities, ...<br><br>>That is what the manufacturer's of these keyboards would like you to think,<br>but >actually, the pitch possibilities are far from continuous.  The<br>granularity is quite >coarse, both from the perspective of the relative pitch<br>perception capabilities of the >ear, and from the perspective of what is<br>possible to modern technology.<br><br>You're right.  And I should have known better than to state it so<br>imprecisely.  Most commercial "synths" (really little more than sample<br>playback devices, but all I have to work with) released over the past 2 or 3<br>years have user tuning tables with 1-cent resolution.  I have noticed that<br>there is always still some beating in JI chords played with pure waves, and<br>when I figured out how to do the calculations to find what the exact number<br>of cents difference from ET should be (I'd been tuning by ear for several<br>months), I saw why.<br><br>However, most of the time I'm triggering samples that have some amount of<br>loop artifact, and/or applying "chorus" effect, and/or using PM vibrato and<br>inflectional pitch bends for expressive purposes.  Under these circumstances<br>would finer resolution make a significant difference, do you think?  I'm<br>talking here about music for the masses, not theory for us mathematicians.<br>:-)  I've learned to discern 1-cent increments in a harmonic context, but my<br>wife, a trained pianist, has difficulty discerning between some JI triads and<br>the same chord in 12-tET even when differences of several cents are involved.<br> This makes me wonder how fine the resolution really needs to be for most<br>musical purposes.  Then again, when you get beyond triads, small tuning<br>differences really start to show.<br><br>Finally, I do hope that Marion is off the beam about laziness being a<br>frequent factor in choices over whether to study ET or JI.  Although, if I'd<br>heard that suggestion after spending a few days last month organizing<br>hundreds of ratios by various means, I'd probably have accepted that<br>explanation out-of-hand!  What's really maddening is having to use ET-based<br>synth tuning tables to produce JI scales.  If only more manufacturers would<br>make tables that allowed direct entry of ratios!  My scientific calculator is<br>still smoldering.<br><br>But his suggestion that "there is the perception that transcendental math is<br>'higher' than grubby old arithmetic"  is very interesting.  It's the sort of<br>thing sounds so intellectually superior; although, like Gary Morrison, I've<br>never heard anyone actually say that they believed it.<br><br>Hope I haven't really ticked anyone off with all this old-school thinking!<br>:-)<br><br>David J.
