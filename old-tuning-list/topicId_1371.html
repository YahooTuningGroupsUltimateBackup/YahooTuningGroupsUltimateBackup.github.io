On the other<br>hand, to say nothing might be considered antisocial in another sense: both<br>xenharmonic theory and mathematics could fall into disrepute and good<br>people could get confused. <br><br>There are, I think, two main issues that need clarification. Much of<br>Brian's article depends on his interpretation of the mod function and on<br>the relevance of the concepts of relative primeness and compositeness.<br>______<br><br>To begin, a group is not a group until a set is defined together with a<br>binary operation on the elements of the set that satisfies the group<br>axioms.  We must take it as read in Brian's article that the group under<br>consideration is the set of n-tet intervals measured in scale-steps<br>together with the binary operation of addition modulo n.  It is important<br>to mention this because other ways of defining a group in this setting are<br>possible.  (It is true, however, that other formulations may have<br>essentially the some group structure, even though the set elements and the<br>binary operation are defined differently.)<br><br>In speaking about the elements 5 and 7 in 12-tet, and also the elements 1<br>and 11, Brian claims that in modulo 12 arithmetic, 7 5 and 11 1.  This<br>is not true.  It is true that 12 5(mod7) and 12 7(mod5) but neither of<br>these facts is particularly helpful.  Closer to the mark is the fact that<br>5 -7(mod 12). <br><br>What is needed here is the idea of the 'inverse'. In this group 5 and 7<br>are each other's inverse, as are 1 and 11. <br><br>The significance of this is that an element and its inverse each generate<br>the same cyclic subgroup. In fact they generate the elements of the<br>subgroup in opposite order to one another. <br><br>It should be noted that the idea of 'order' in the sense of 'permutation',<br>is not intrinsic to groups.  Indeed, elements 1,5,7,11 generate exactly<br>the same subgroup, namely the group itself.  But the sequence in which the<br>elements appear in the process of generating the subgroup is different in<br>each case, as Brian points out. <br><br>Now, every element of a group generates a cyclic subgroup of some size or<br>other (always dividing n).  In the case of the particular type of group<br>that arises in the n-tet context, i.e. the cyclic groups of order n, the<br>size of the subgroup generated by a particular interval is n/d where d is<br>the greatest common divisor of n and the number of scale-steps in the<br>interval.  E.g. in 12-tet, the element 6 generates a subgroup of order 2,<br>the element 10 generates a subgroup of order 6, and 5 generates a subgroup<br>of order 12 - the whole group. <br><br>Clearly, if the number of scale steps in the generating interval is 1 or a<br>number relatively prime to n, the whole group will be generated.  Contrary<br>to Brian's assertion, the compositeness of the number of scale steps is<br>neither here nor there. <br><br>For example, in 16-tet, the 3-step interval generates the whole group but<br>so does the 9-step interval, notwithstanding the fact that 9 is composite. <br>Only the permutation of the elements is different: <br><br>0  3  6  9  12 15 2  5  8  11 14 1  4  7  10 13<br>0  9  2  11 4  13 6  15 8  1  10 3  12 5  14 7<br><br>Similarly, the number of different 'cycles of fifths' in an n-tet tuning<br>doesn't depend on the compositeness or otherwise of the numerical size of<br>the generating intervals.  It is their relative primeness to n that<br>counts.<br>__________<br><br>The full significance of Brian's post probably becomes apparent when read<br>in conjunction with the paper by Gerald J. Balzano: <br><br>The Group-theoretic Description of 12-Fold and Microtonal Pitch Systems; <br>Computer Music Journal, Vol. 4, No. 4, Winter 1980; MIT  <br><br>which, in turn, should be read in conjunction with an introductory text on<br>abstract algebra, if necessary. (The one by Frahleigh would be a good<br>choice.)<br><br>Brian's main thesis, if I have inferred it correctly, is that a<br>group-theoretic view can be helpful in making sense of the structural<br>possibilities in n-tet tunings.  In this I thoroughly concur. <br><br>I have to admit defeat in trying to unravel Brian's statements about<br>'tiling'. I suspect there is a connection here with the Balzano article.<br>It may be that the relevant essence is the fact that some cyclic groups<br>are isomorphic to direct products of smaller groups and some are not: the<br>group corresponding to 12-tet _is_ while the groups corresponding to<br>16-tet and 19-tet are not. (This seems to have a bearing on the kinds of<br>chordal relationships that can be found.)<br><br>PT<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 14 Dec 1996 20:37 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04192; Sat, 14 Dec 1996 20:39:41 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04226<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA28461; Sat, 14 Dec 1996 11:39:38 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 14 Dec 1996 11:39:38 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612141935.LAA29999@sunatg1><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4323 href="#4323">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/1996 10:24:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Jim Kukula's thoughts on similarities between rhythmic and frequency<br>proportions strikes me as creative thinking - applying ideas in one aspect<br>of music to another.  That's valuable.  <br><br>   I suspect though that pitch and rhythm are fundamentally different when<br>it comes to temperament.  Tempering pitches is meaningful because our ears<br>hear in a manner that could perhaps be described as simultaneously in<br>linear and logarithmic frequency scales.  <br><br>   For example, octaves have meaning both as 4/3s of a perfect fifth's span<br>of linear frequency, and also as (roughly) 12/7s of a perfect fifth's span<br>on a logarithmic frequency.  That first formulation relates those two<br>intervals by their JI, whole-number-ratio basis, and the second formulation<br>relates the two by their perceived pitch distance as is useful for weighing<br>them in building a scale.  <br><br>   While we'll all agree that fundamental rhythmic structures show very<br>clear proportions on a linear time or note-rate scale, I doubt if there is<br>much intuitive meaning to a logarithmic time or rate scale.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 15 Dec 1996 20:11 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04681; Sun, 15 Dec 1996 20:13:53 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04722<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA09527; Sun, 15 Dec 1996 11:13:51 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 15 Dec 1996 11:13:51 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3.0.32.19961215111011.0068b0f4@adnc.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4490 href="#4490">ðŸ”—</a>Matt Nathan &#x3C;mattn@ix.netcom.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/1997 7:31:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>PAULE wrote:<br>> <br>> Gary wrote,<br>> <br>> >I suspect though that pitch and rhythm are fundamentally different when<br>> >it comes to temperament.

On the other<br>hand, to say nothing might be considered antisocial in another sense: both<br>xenharmonic theory and mathematics could fall into disrepute and good<br>people could get confused. <br><br>There are, I think, two main issues that need clarification. Much of<br>Brian's article depends on his interpretation of the mod function and on<br>the relevance of the concepts of relative primeness and compositeness.<br>______<br><br>To begin, a group is not a group until a set is defined together with a<br>binary operation on the elements of the set that satisfies the group<br>axioms.  We must take it as read in Brian's article that the group under<br>consideration is the set of n-tet intervals measured in scale-steps<br>together with the binary operation of addition modulo n.  It is important<br>to mention this because other ways of defining a group in this setting are<br>possible.  (It is true, however, that other formulations may have<br>essentially the some group structure, even though the set elements and the<br>binary operation are defined differently.)<br><br>In speaking about the elements 5 and 7 in 12-tet, and also the elements 1<br>and 11, Brian claims that in modulo 12 arithmetic, 7 5 and 11 1.  This<br>is not true.  It is true that 12 5(mod7) and 12 7(mod5) but neither of<br>these facts is particularly helpful.  Closer to the mark is the fact that<br>5 -7(mod 12). <br><br>What is needed here is the idea of the 'inverse'. In this group 5 and 7<br>are each other's inverse, as are 1 and 11. <br><br>The significance of this is that an element and its inverse each generate<br>the same cyclic subgroup. In fact they generate the elements of the<br>subgroup in opposite order to one another. <br><br>It should be noted that the idea of 'order' in the sense of 'permutation',<br>is not intrinsic to groups.  Indeed, elements 1,5,7,11 generate exactly<br>the same subgroup, namely the group itself.  But the sequence in which the<br>elements appear in the process of generating the subgroup is different in<br>each case, as Brian points out. <br><br>Now, every element of a group generates a cyclic subgroup of some size or<br>other (always dividing n).  In the case of the particular type of group<br>that arises in the n-tet context, i.e. the cyclic groups of order n, the<br>size of the subgroup generated by a particular interval is n/d where d is<br>the greatest common divisor of n and the number of scale-steps in the<br>interval.  E.g. in 12-tet, the element 6 generates a subgroup of order 2,<br>the element 10 generates a subgroup of order 6, and 5 generates a subgroup<br>of order 12 - the whole group. <br><br>Clearly, if the number of scale steps in the generating interval is 1 or a<br>number relatively prime to n, the whole group will be generated.  Contrary<br>to Brian's assertion, the compositeness of the number of scale steps is<br>neither here nor there. <br><br>For example, in 16-tet, the 3-step interval generates the whole group but<br>so does the 9-step interval, notwithstanding the fact that 9 is composite. <br>Only the permutation of the elements is different: <br><br>0  3  6  9  12 15 2  5  8  11 14 1  4  7  10 13<br>0  9  2  11 4  13 6  15 8  1  10 3  12 5  14 7<br><br>Similarly, the number of different 'cycles of fifths' in an n-tet tuning<br>doesn't depend on the compositeness or otherwise of the numerical size of<br>the generating intervals.  It is their relative primeness to n that<br>counts.<br>__________<br><br>The full significance of Brian's post probably becomes apparent when read<br>in conjunction with the paper by Gerald J. Balzano: <br><br>The Group-theoretic Description of 12-Fold and Microtonal Pitch Systems; <br>Computer Music Journal, Vol. 4, No. 4, Winter 1980; MIT  <br><br>which, in turn, should be read in conjunction with an introductory text on<br>abstract algebra, if necessary. (The one by Frahleigh would be a good<br>choice.)<br><br>Brian's main thesis, if I have inferred it correctly, is that a<br>group-theoretic view can be helpful in making sense of the structural<br>possibilities in n-tet tunings.  In this I thoroughly concur. <br><br>I have to admit defeat in trying to unravel Brian's statements about<br>'tiling'. I suspect there is a connection here with the Balzano article.<br>It may be that the relevant essence is the fact that some cyclic groups<br>are isomorphic to direct products of smaller groups and some are not: the<br>group corresponding to 12-tet _is_ while the groups corresponding to<br>16-tet and 19-tet are not. (This seems to have a bearing on the kinds of<br>chordal relationships that can be found.)<br><br>PT<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 14 Dec 1996 20:37 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04192; Sat, 14 Dec 1996 20:39:41 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04226<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA28461; Sat, 14 Dec 1996 11:39:38 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 14 Dec 1996 11:39:38 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612141935.LAA29999@sunatg1><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4323 href="#4323">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/1996 10:24:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Jim Kukula's thoughts on similarities between rhythmic and frequency<br>proportions strikes me as creative thinking - applying ideas in one aspect<br>of music to another.

You'll see that they <br>fall into about 3 separate narrow bands, separated by wide bands in which<br>no tunes are played, something like the emission bands given off by elements <br>in a flame, if I might be so analogistic.<br><br>> >The problem with tempered rhythms is in their combination.

In fact, one could just switch<br>> to triplets suddenly, and later establish the basic pulse as an even number<br>> of these notes, without any drift occuring.<br><br>You might as well use real triplets or n-plets for each base tempo, and temper<br>only the relationships between base tempos when modulating. <br><br>On a related anecdote, I often hear drummers on recordings and those who <br>I play with live speed up when they play fills involving faster notes.<br>It's only the really good drummers who keep comfortably consistent<br>time no matter what rhythmic octave they are playing in. <br><br>Another anecdote, someone once wrote to me about the possibility of a software <br>module to process a quantized midi file to slow down the tempo at <br>parts where a real pianist would have to move one or both hands far across<br>the keyboard, the amount of slowing depending on the distance traversed,<br>to make the track more human-sounding.<br><br>There's also that process where you delay each note by a small amount relative<br>to the volume of the note, since some musicians who use their hands like percussion<br>players will bring their hands farther away from the instrument in preparation<br>for a harder striking, and take a little longer time to reach the instrument.<br>Good players will of course compensate for or avoid this unconcious habit<br><br>Matt Nathan<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 8 Jan 1997 19:27 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06012; Wed, 8 Jan 1997 19:30:37 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06005<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id KAA13951; Wed, 8 Jan 1997 10:30:25 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 8 Jan 1997 10:30:25 -0800<br>Message-Id: <32D3E6A5.2220@ix.netcom.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
