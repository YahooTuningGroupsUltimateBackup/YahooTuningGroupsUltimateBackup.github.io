We've been over this on the list<br>before, but here's here it goes again:<br><br>   BASICALLY fret positions can be calculated best measure from the bridge.<br> The first thing to do is measure the open string length.  That varies from<br>guitar to guitar, but it's typically about 65cm.  Next calculate the<br>frequency multiplier for adjacent steps in your tuning.  That is given by<br>the Nth root of 2, or the 22nd root of 2 for 22TET for example.  (That is<br>also the same as 2 raised to the 1/22 power, by the way, if your calculator<br>doesn't have a root key.)  The first fret position, again measured from the<br>bridge, is the open string length divided by that frequency multiplier. <br>The second fret position is the first fret position divided by that same<br>number.  The third fret is the second-fret position divided by that number,<br>and so forth all the way up the neck.  <br><br>   There is an important complicating factor though:  When you press a<br>string down to the fingerboard, you add tension to it, and that added<br>tension is greater for higher fret positions, meaning that you get sharper<br>as go up the neck.  To compensate for this, the usual procedure is to<br>adjust the bridge a little away from the nut.  This ensures that higher<br>frets endure a greater percentage lengthening, and thus flattening, than<br>lower frets.  This has two important ramifications:  <br>1.  You can't use the distance from nut to bridge for the open string<br>length.<br>    You instead have to measure from nut to octave fret and double that to <br>    get the theoretical open-string length.  <br>2.  Although it's easiest to CALCULATE the fret positions from the bridge, <br>    you're better off MEASURING them from the nut, since the bridge<br>position<br>    isn't trustable.  To measure them from the nut instead of from the<br>bridge,<br>    just subtract them from the open-string length.  <br><br>   A footnote to #1 above:  If you find that the octave fret mismatches the<br>octave-fret harmonic by much, you may want to compensate for that so get a<br>more ideal octave-fret position.  If the octave fret plays a little sharp<br>of the octave harmonic, you need to move the ideal octave-fret position<br>toward the nut.  But be VERY careful of moving it too much, you rarely need<br>to move it more than a millimeter or two.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 28 Jan 1997 18:02 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17678; Tue, 28 Jan 1997 18:02:36 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA17641<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA01413; Tue, 28 Jan 1997 09:02:29 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 28 Jan 1997 09:02:29 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701280908_MC2-104A-4D81@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>TUNING digest 967</h1><h3><a id=4688 href="#4688">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Adam B.
