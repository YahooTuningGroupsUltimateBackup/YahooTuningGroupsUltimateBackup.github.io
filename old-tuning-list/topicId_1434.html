I know of<br>Wesleyan Dissertations (all available through Interlibrary loan or<br>University Microfilms) in Karnatic Music by Tanjore Viswanathan (on Raga<br>Alapana), L. Shankar, and K.S. Subramanian, all excellent musicians. There<br>are also very interesting dissertations by American musicians who are/were<br>professional performers of Karnatic music including those by the late Jon<br>Higgins (on Barata Natyam) and David Reck.<br><br>Johnny Reinhard mentions the use of notation in Turkey. Notational skills<br>are indeed an element of prestige among musicians in Turkey, and the<br>country in full of little music stores where after hours instruction is<br>offered chiefly in music notation, but I think that it would be wrong to<br>attribute too great an emphasis to the use of notation. (It is strikingly<br>similar to the use of notation by Pop musicians in the States - something<br>that may be useful, is not strictly necessary, but does earn respect among<br>other musicians). In the large number of Turkish music concerts I have<br>heard - both classical and folk - I have never seen written music notation<br>on stage. In any case, notation would be of little use for the<br>formulaic-improvised Taksim. <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 26 Dec 1996 13:59 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03164; Thu, 26 Dec 1996 14:01:36 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03138<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id FAA15699; Thu, 26 Dec 1996 05:01:33 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 26 Dec 1996 05:01:33 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612261253.AA07219@felix.dircon.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>South Indian Music Dissertations/Notation in Turkey</h1><h3><a id=4409 href="#4409">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;106232.3266@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/26/1996 3:34:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Haverstick wondered about dissertations by Indian Musicians.
