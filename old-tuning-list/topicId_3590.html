The<br>5-limit<br>tritones provide a biting dissonance in the "dominant 7th" chord<br>that *demand* resolution onto the major or minor triad on the "tonic".<br><br>A perfectly tuned 4:5:6:7 chord is only a tiny bit less consonant<br>than a plain old 4:5:6 triad.  There's a big difference in the sound<br>and feel from the 3- and 5-limit "dominant 7th"s, provided they are<br>in perfect tune also.

That is, I don't think 64:45 can<br>> itself be a "target" but is instead close to several<br>> possible targets. Other notes in the chord can clarify<br>> which target that is, and in the case of dominant<br>> seventh chords, only 7:5 can fit with all the other<br>> ratios to define a simple "target chord".<br><br>[Monzo:]<br>I'm glad you didn't misinterpret me here: I should have<br>specified that the "target" would be a lower-prime/<br>lower-odd ratio.
