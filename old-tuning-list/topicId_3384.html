There is<br>information about this at their web sites, including forms. When I queried<br>BMI about this issue, they said that they could not make any exceptions<br>(even when no money changes hands) as long as the composers have assigned<br>their performance rights to BMI.

The only alternative, so far<br>as I know, is to get the composers to assign performance rights to you<br>directly. BMI and ASCAP performance rights are "non-exclusive," meaning<br>that composers have the right to assign performance rights to other parties<br>(i.e. you) on an individual basis. Thus if someone explicitly assigns you<br>those rights, you don't have to pay ASCAP or BMI.
