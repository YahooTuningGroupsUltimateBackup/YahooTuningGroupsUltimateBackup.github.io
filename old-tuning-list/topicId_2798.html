These two intervals are<br>conjunct, and are perhaps possible to sing by pure dead-reckoning, yet<br>not wide enough to be confused with adjacent pitches. The 31-tone equal<br>augmented tone is easily confused with the minor third in melody, but<br>given a harmonic context that supports it - the usual form of the minor<br>- the thing is possible. And yet as soon as one leaves the realm of<br>purely conjunct music, these two intervals become very difficult to<br>preserve melodically, vis-?-vis the tonic.<br><br>To add one or at most two pitch classes that require elaborate care to<br>use at all, and this at the enormous expense and trouble of using 31<br>tones in the octave, is veritably Horace's mountain laboring to bring<br>forth a mouse.<br><br>The only systems that _do_ add notably to the number of melodic pitch<br>classes in the octave are the 19-tone equal and those that very closely<br>approximate to it.<br><br>The difference between the number of heptatonic melodies expressible by<br>choosing from 19 pitch classes versus 12, is theoretically on the order<br>of 40 to 1 (not 70 to 1, as I stated earlier; I failed to omit the tonic<br>from the combination). But many factors - the requirement for a modicum<br>of consonance, the requirement that modes not bunch all their tones<br>together in one small region of the octave, etc - reduce the difference<br>to perhaps more like 10 to 1. Still, 10 to 1 is a vast melodic advance.<br>This is enough to partly explain why Arabs, Turks and Indians - who seem<br>to use approximations of the 1/3 tone in their popular melody - so often<br>find Western classical music melodically crude.

But this is doubtless the major factor.<br><br>Rock melody - and also chromatic Renaissance polyphony - non-Westerners<br>do not as a rule find crude or uninteresting.

The only thing that might have predisposed<br>me in some way to enneadecaphony (the 19-tone equal temperament) was the<br>fact, which I observed at the piano as a boy, that I could easily sing<br>two, but not three notes 'in between the white keys'. But I filed away<br>this knowledge as a mere curiosity; for obviously such a division would<br>have been an unequal 17-tone temperament, with all sorts of problems.<br>When I finally learned of the 19-tone equal it seemed to me rather<br>cowardly and insignificant to add only 7 tones to the 12-tone equal!<br>Also, I associated 19-tone equal with Costeley and Salinas, whom I<br>assumed would have quite superannuated criteria for selecting a<br>temperament. The less men know, the more arrogantly do they dismiss the<br>past, and suppose whatever they may find at random to be of<br>unimpeachable, precious value. I tended to think of 22- and 24-tone<br>equal as the initial minimalist systems, with a preference for the<br>latter, for I had been told so many times that 12-tone equal was<br>wonderful that I believed it.<br><br>In all of these assumptions I could not have been more wrong. The great<br>paradox here is that by proceeding beyond 19 equal tones in the octave,<br>we tend to return ourselves melodically to our diatonic and 12-tone<br>equal starting point, with perhaps one or two of the diatonic modes<br>improved enough so as to be usable, as compared to the very rough<br>12-tone versions, and perhaps some slight shadings without melodic<br>significance. But by exercising a little self-control and _stopping_ at<br>19 tones, we open up Western instrumental music to the chromatic and<br>enharmonic worlds - and also dramatically improve the diatonic modes,<br>making them more tonal and coherent both harmonically and melodically,<br>both as regards consonance and as regards dissonance. And we also<br>provide our singers with a temperament that can lead them through all<br>the chromatic and enharmonic possibilities, not just those that their<br>own unaided imaginations have devised.<br><br>All this was at least glimpsed 400 years ago by the great Francisco<br>Salinas, whom mankind will one day regard with the same awe that is now<br>reserved for a Newton or an Einstein.<br><br>Even if one is determined to remain within diatonicity, 19-tone equal<br>effects profound improvements over 12-tone equal. Take the much-maligned<br>locrian mode for example. In 12-tone equal the fourth degree of this<br>mode, the perfect fourth, is the only degree definitely related to the<br>tonic by a strongly consonant interval; the minor third and sixth are<br>markedly deteriorated.<br><br>As an example of the other degrees, take the second degree, a diminished<br>second. This is most directly related to the tonic via the disjunct<br>consonantal progression B-E(ascending)-C(descending). There are three<br>other methods of reaching C, using only consonances, but I refrain from<br>giving them. But the major third is severely weakened in the 12-tone<br>equal, so that the progression loses part of its force. This is what I<br>mean when I say - as I often do - that inferior temperaments 'weaken the<br>tonal fabric'.<br><br>I realize that some want their music to sound as random and inarticulate<br>as possible, and would be ashamed to win any kind of audience - and so<br>desire any kind of relation between the divers tones of music to be<br>abolished. I leave them to their folly. To argue with such people is<br>like trying to convince a sweet old Southern gentleman that he really is<br>not Napoleon.<br><br>In the 19-tone equal, on the other hand, the second degree of the<br>locrian is obtainable via two consonances neither of which is noticeably<br>rougher than just, or rather, the additional roughness is so small as to<br>impart brilliance, but not enough to weaken the mind's conviction that<br>consonances are present. The result is that even when the most severe<br>dissonances occur in the 19-tone equal locrian mode - and it has plenty<br>of them, enough to sate the most dissonance-loving person - these<br>dissonances 'hang together': they imply consonance, just as true<br>consonances can lead immediately to strong dissonances. But this is not<br>so for the 12-tone equal. There, two 'consonances' (such as two major<br>thirds) can create a theoretical strong dissonance, the augmented fifth,<br>that is acoustically a weak consonance.<br><br>This is one reason why the 12-tone equal, tolerable in the most<br>consonant diatonic modes, has such an oddly artificial, neutral effect<br>when used for the chromatic modes - many of the just harmonies are so<br>radically confounded that the tonal fabric is rent apart, and randomness<br>- the enemy of all musical order and expression - appears. Musical<br>randomness does not have an exciting, daring, aggressive, subtle,<br>pathetic or delicately esoteric effect. The effect is neutral,<br>frivolous, feeble, insincere, crude, and grovelling. The best examples I<br>know are from the chromatic Renaissance. Play over one of Gesualdo's<br>chromatic pieces in 12-tone equal. (Lassus' Prophetiae Sibyllarum will<br>do almost equally well.) Then play them again in 19-tone equal with an<br>octave stretch as I have instructed. The former versions are threatened<br>at every point with randomness; the latter are never so threatened. This<br>is the best I can do to make my point clear.<br><br>Finally, I would like to warn investigators of the 19-tone equal that<br>unless one stretches the octave as I have prescribed, or thereabouts,<br>the fifths (and twelfths) somewhat sour the harmony; in certain timbres<br>this is enough to be decidedly unpleasant. But if a tuning degree of<br>63.3 cents is used, with an octave of 1202.7 cents, the harmony is<br>extremely good. Also, the preconfigured 19-tone equal on the Yamaha<br>DX7-II with the E! sequencer does not work properly; it has a weirdly<br>mistuned sound the cause of which I have not been able to ascertain. The<br>user-configured 19-tone equal sounds fine.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Inquiry of Graham Breed<br>PostedDate:  16-12-97 10:57:17<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  16-12-97 10:55:16-16-12-97 10:55:17,16-12-97 10:54:56-16-12-97 10:54:57<br>DeliveredDate:  16-12-97 10:54:57<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656F.00367DF4; Tue, 16 Dec 1997 10:57:08 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA16680; Tue, 16 Dec 1997 10:57:17 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 16 Dec 1997 10:57:17 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA16674<br>Received: (qmail 1323 invoked from network); 16 Dec 1997 01:57:12 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 16 Dec 1997 01:57:12 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3496B312.542B@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Khroai, etc</h1><h3><a id=6657 href="#6657">ðŸ”—</a>Gregg Gibson &#x3C;ggibson@ww-interlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/16/1997 1:50:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Quite minute differences, on the order of 5-10 cents, can effect<br>dramatic, readily perceptible variations in harmony.
