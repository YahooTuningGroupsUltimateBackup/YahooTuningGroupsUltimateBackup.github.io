I have described it over the list as like "a fifth with an<br>>attitude".

I don't know if I can put<br>>those similarities into words any better than this:  As with 3:2 or 2:1,<br>>7:4 fuses pitches very tightly, and its lack of the sweetness of major and<br>>minor thirds and sixths makes it seem quasi-perfect.<br><br>I'd never thought about this before, but it is so true.
