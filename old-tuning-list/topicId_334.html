It's very easy to pinpoint the sound of a major triad in part<br>because we hear them all of the time.  But it's also easy to pinpoint because we<br>have a rich legacy of well-known chord progressions with well-understood effects<br>to relate it to.  <br><br>   What sorts of cadences would you build using 9:7s?  That's a tough question<br>to answer because the significance of a cadence is just as much cultural as it<br>is strictly musical.  By that I mean that the musical effect of a cadence is<br>based every bit as much upon how listeners greet it as it does upon how it<br>sounds.  How a cadence is used historically in well-known music is as important<br>as how it sounds in isolation.  <br><br>   The problem there clearly is that there's very little well-known music, in<br>Western tradition anyway, that uses 9:7s.  So we can only propose possibilities,<br>try to pinpoint best usages in real music, and then start using them that way so<br>that they'll start developing this sort of cadential personality.  <br><br>   One way to start in this effort, is to build upon tradition by adding 9:7s<br>into well-known cadences.  <br><br><br>+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+<br>|  Tip #14:                                                                  |<br>|     In the traditional resolution of a dominant seventh to tonic (an       |<br>|     authentic cadence), the leading tone can be made to rise from 5:4      |<br>|     above scale degree 5, through 9:7, then up to the tonic (4:3).
