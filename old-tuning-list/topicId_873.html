A<br>recent recording of the Balinese ritual 7-tone iron Gamelan Selonding (to<br>be more precise, a copy of a ritual instrument from the village of<br>Tenganan) provides a startling illustration of either (a) the range of<br>variation within the Saih 7 (Balinese pelog) conception or (b) grounds for<br>some reconsideration of the whole family of scales. <br><br>C. McPhee made two divisions of the Saih 7 family: that based upon the<br>Gambuh (a theatrical music apparently imported from East Java), from which<br>the more familiar large bronze ensembles derive their tunings, and that of<br>the Gamelan Gambang, with which he identifies the Gamelan Selonding<br>tunings. Like the G.Gambang, Selonding (the spelling is wildly variable) is<br>used in ritual practices; it is found almost exclusively in East Bali<br>(hence, furthest from Javanes influence) and nearly each village maintains<br>their own, and distinct, practice. Furthermore, McPhee identified two<br>tendencies in Balinese practice, on one hand towards an island-wide<br>standardization of tuning (in both pitch height & interval structure) and<br>on the other towards deviation. Selonding clearly falls into this category.<br><br>Two caveats before I proceed: (1) I am dealing with precious little<br>substantial data, much of that unclear about which instrument or register<br>is in question & attempts to fill in gaps have so far been met with little<br>success and (2) an iron gamelan, with relatively thin keys, is extremely<br>malleable, so all that follows may be for nought!<br><br>The usual model for Saih 7 is something like E F G A+ B C D.
