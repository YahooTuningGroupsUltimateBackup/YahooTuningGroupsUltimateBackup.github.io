Also, I just want to say that elitism in the arts is<br>really stinky, and has no place in the true artists life...music comes<br>from sound, and many of the great spiritual traditions state that sound<br>is a foundation of the very Universe...therefore, music belongs to<br>everyone, and indeed is part of everyone at the deepest level. I feel<br>musical talent is a wonderful gift, and is meant to be shared with as<br>many people as possible...many great artists have stated, at times,<br>that they feel as if their music is coming from somewhere else, that they<br>are not really DOING it, but they are only the vehicle for some higher<br>power...of course, I feel that is absolutely true, and I myself have had<br>the experience of seeing an idea come to me from beyond my teensy "self";<br>how, then, can it be "mine"? If it was given freely, then I feel it<br>should be shared freely as well...again, any whiff of elitism is wrong,<br>and has my utmost contempt...Hstick<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 27 Jul 1996 18:12 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA20604; Sat, 27 Jul 1996 09:12:12 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 27 Jul 1996 09:12:12 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199607271610.KAA04737@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>more Partch comments</h1><h3><a id=3324 href="#3324">ðŸ”—</a>bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G.
