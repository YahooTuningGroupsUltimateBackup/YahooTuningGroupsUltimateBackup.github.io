I now am certain of this fact -- 19tet sounds like<br>out of tune 12. Try this experiment. Record a pop tune in 19tet, and play<br>it for the man on the street. If he can tell you anything at all about<br>the tuning, it will be that it just sounds out of tune. And the funny<br>thing is, he is right! If the man on the street wanted music in other<br>temperaments than 12, don't you think he would have asked for it by now?<br><br>John Starrett<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Steven Rezsutek <rezsutek@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov><br>Subject:  Re: Reply 2 to Graham Breed<br>PostedDate:  15-12-97 18:40:20<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  15-12-97 18:38:17-15-12-97 18:38:18,15-12-97 18:37:58-15-12-97 18:37:59<br>DeliveredDate:  15-12-97 18:37:59<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656E.0060E248; Mon, 15 Dec 1997 18:40:10 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA16123; Mon, 15 Dec 1997 18:40:20 +0100<br>Date: Mon, 15 Dec 1997 18:40:20 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA16118<br>Received: (qmail 15511 invoked from network); 15 Dec 1997 09:40:13 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 15 Dec 1997 09:40:13 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199712151737.MAA07512@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Greg Gibson's latest</h1><h3><a id=6640 href="#6640">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/1997 9:10:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Hi Gang-<br><br>        I have been doing some experiments prompted by Greg's recent<br>posts about 19tet.
