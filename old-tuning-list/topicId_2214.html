In<br>my matrix representation, these conditions can be written:<br><br>                 ( 1 0  0)     (1 0 0) <br>                 ( 7 0 -3)H' (0 0 0)H<br>                 (-4 4 -1)     (0 0 0)<br><br>Where H is the metric of pitch space, and H' is its approximation<br>in 12tet.  To get H', you multiply the right hand side of the<br>equation by the inverse of the matrix on the left.  This general<br>method works for all ETs that approximate some kind of JI.  For<br>the perfect octave case, you only need the left hand column of<br>the inverted matrix and the number of steps in an octave is +/-<br>the determinant of the original matrix.  This will also be one<br>dimension of the cross product of the two zeroed intervals. It is<br>also the determinant of the square matrix formed by the zeroed<br>intervals without the octave column, and this will work for any<br>dimension.  So, it looks like I was thinking along the same lines<br>as Fokker.  Did he come up with any other stuff like this?
