Following Partch, I built Harmonic Cannons,<br>Xylophones, Bass Marimbas, metallophones, etc. I experimented<br>with electronic synthesizer controllers, and devised various<br>Fipple pipes and recorders. One of the most flexible instruments<br>I ever used is the Cosmolyra, built by Ivor Darreg. But I always<br>felt that I needed something even more expressive and<br>pitch-flexible for melodic work (my current tonal resources<br>include about 65 pitches per octave, in a matrix of 9 harmonic<br>series and 9 subharmonic series scales). <br><br>	Now, after all these years I have found an instrument that<br>promises to fulfill my needs. It is light weight, encompasses<br>the entire range of hearing in one sweep, allows the precise<br>intonation of any scales with infinite capacity for modulation<br>and transfer between scales, has loudness expression comparable<br>to that of the human voice, can be interfaced to control an<br>analog synthesizer , costs less than $200 and only requires two<br>hands to play. Only problem is, it takes a lot of practice!<br><br>	In late November of 1996, The Southeast Just Intonation Center<br>received a donation of a Theremin Kit from Paia Electronics, of<br>Edmond Oklahoma. It was offered partly so we could evaluate the Theremin as<br>a practical instrument for microtonal music, and partly as a resource for<br>the center, to be used in composition, performance and teaching.<br><br>It took about a weekend of work to assemble, <br>test and calibrate the kit. This included the wood finishing for the<br>case. Everything required was there, except for the wood finish.<br>One potentiometer was smashed in handling or shipping, but was<br>immediately replaced by next day mail when I informed John<br>Simonton (Paia's "honcho") by Email. The instruction manual was<br>very clear and complete, making the whole thing a pleasure to<br>do. Calibration was relatively easy. <br><br>	The Theremax (Paia's name for it's Theremin kit) has a number<br>of options that make it easy to customize. My first modification<br>was to put the pitch antennae on the left and the loudness<br>antennae on the right. This is opposite from the configuration<br>as played by Leon Theremin and Clara Rockmore, but made a lot of<br>sense to me, since it allowed me to transfer pitch/distance<br>skills already developed through cosmolyra, guitar and other<br>string instrument experience. The next change (which was<br>outlined as a possibility in the instructions) was to set up the<br>loudness antennae so that the instrument got louder as my hand<br>got closer to it. This is also reverse from the method that<br>Theremin and Rockmore used (Loudest when the hand is furthest<br>away  - off when touching the antennae ). In addition, the<br>Theremax has control voltage outputs for pitch, loudness and<br>velocity as well as a trigger and gate. This makes it very easy<br>to control an analog synthesizer with the Theremax.<br><br>	Then came the hard part: learning to play it. It seemed a<br>little clumsy at first. I had trouble holding my arms still<br>enough to get good control of the two parameters, pitch and<br>loudness. Eventually, I learned to rest my left wrist on the<br>case, to make my pitch hand more steady. I continued to do this<br>for several weeks as I got more fluid with it. I found that it<br>was easier to play precisely in the higher register, since it<br>required less hand movement. But by continuing to practice in<br>the low register as well (which required me to take my wrist off<br>of the case), my arm eventually got strong enough to remain<br>stable in mid-air.<br><br>	My practice sessions include warming up with sweeps and<br>effects, trills in various registers, bird songs  close to the<br>pitch antennae;  practice of various scales and thats; a drill<br>of playing a Subharmonic scale from top to bottom then a<br>harmonic scale from bottom to top, then going back to the<br>subharmonic scale, stopping on the next subharmonic and using it<br>for a fundamental for another harmonic scale, etc.; then I just<br>play every melody I can think of with as much precision and<br>expressiveness as possible. It is very easy to get distracted<br>from loudness while concentrating on pitch and vice-versa. I'm<br>learning to let my right hand do what my breath does on a wind<br>instrument. Kind of tricky, but it's developing.<br><br>	By Thursday, January 26th, I felt ready for a public<br>performance. I scheduled about 15 minutes in between the two<br>sets of an Exotic Music Ensemble concert, held at Gainesville's<br>historic Thomas Center, for a solo Theremin performance.  I was<br>interviewed on a local radio station on Tuesday, and a short<br>feature with a color picture of me playing the Theremax appeared<br>in the Wednesday Entertainment section of the Gainesville Sun<br>newspaper. This brought well over a hundred people to the<br>concert, which is a lot for that venue. It generated quite a bit<br>of interest, and I was much encouraged by all the people<br>standing up and cheering afterward.<br><br>	I feel that I have only scratched the surface of this<br>instrument's potential as a flexible and expressive microtonal<br>instrument. Next, I plan to experiment with interfacing the<br>Theremax to an analog synthesizer.
