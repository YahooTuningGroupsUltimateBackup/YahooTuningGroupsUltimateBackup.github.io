(Or more specifically, I claimed only that I<br>did not no of any such precedent.)  <br><br>   The example he cited was a word in another language that refers to SWNR<br>harmony, and that nominally translate to the English word "pure". <br>(Unfortunately I deleted that message, and don't recall either the language<br>or the word in that language.  Sorry.)<br><br>   After reflecting on that a bit, I've decided that he translated his<br>words incorrectly.  If a word like "just" has two or more meanings, you<br>must translate it according to the specific meaning you're using the word<br>for.  <br><br>   For example, the Spanish word "lengua" can have two English<br>translations:  "tongue" or "language".  Although in English "tongue" is<br>sometimes taken to mean "language", I would certainly not translate the<br>Spanish sentence "mi lengua esta rojo" as "my language is red".  <br><br>   Similarly, if I were translating a sentence in Spanish that uses the<br>word "pura" to refer to SWNR tunings, I would still translate it to "just",<br>because the sentence refers specifically to SWNR harmony, not to the<br>generic meaning of "pure".  That since the pre-existing English word for<br>SWNR tunings is "just", and there is no previous attribution in the English<br>language of that specific meaning to the word "pure".  (Or again, none that<br>I personally am aware of.)  <br><br>   Understand however that I have no problems with describing just<br>intonation as sounding pure.  That's fine because it DESCRIBES just<br>intonation, rather than devising an additional DEFINITION for "pure". <br>Adding a new definition to the synonym stew only risks novices thinking<br>that the two mean two subtly different things.  <br><br>   It also can lead to confusion when attempting to use "pure" for its<br>existing, general meaning.  Consider for example this sentence:  "Whereas<br>JI uses axiomatic definitions of thirds, fourths and fifths, meantone is<br>built purely upon a circle of fifths."  Without taking "pure" and "just" as<br>synonyms, people will correctly understand the sentence to mean that a<br>circle of fifths is the only underlying basis behind meantone tunings.  But<br>if we accept "pure" to be synonymous with "just", then people could<br>misinterpret that sentence to mean that meantone is synonymous with<br>pythagorean tuning.  <br><br>   So I personally think that we ought to accept the hand of vocabulary<br>cards the English language deals us whenever possible.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 2 Jan 1997 09:15 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06642; Thu, 2 Jan 1997 09:18:21 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06634<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id AAA02612; Thu, 2 Jan 1997 00:18:18 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 2 Jan 1997 00:18:18 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701020315_MC2-E30-FA9D@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Other Languages' "Pure" Meaning "Just"</h1><h3><a id=4461 href="#4461">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/1/1997 4:31:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Manuel refuted my claim that there is not historical precedent for<br>"pure" being synonymous with "just", refering to small-whole-number-ratio<br>(SWNR) pitch relationships.
