So we were stuck with it.<br><br>Does anyone recognize the method of tuning I've described?  Does it have a<br>name?<br><br>In the next couple of weeks or so, as I'm editing the recordings, I'm going to<br>try to find a relatively short snippet of the piano tracks that involves all<br>12 chromatic notes and make a Real Audio file out of it.  If any of you are<br>interested in hearing it, please post me off-list and I'll send it out to you<br>when I have it ready.  I'd appreciate any informed analysis.<br><br>David J.
