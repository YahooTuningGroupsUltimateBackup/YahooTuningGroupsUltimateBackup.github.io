In other words, in a diatonic scale, that is,<br>    one with steps of the sizes "tone" and "semitone", the interval<br>    structure of the four notes within a "perfect 4th" will contain<br>    one "semitone" and the rest are "whole tones".

In genera<br>    other than the diatonic, the tetrachord still encompassed the<br>    main identifying interval, be it a 6/5 in the chromatic, a<br>    5/4 in the enharmonic, or some other ratio of a "3rd".<br><br>2)  Ancient Greek was a tonal language, where the _pitch_  of a       <br>vowel affected its meaning (like modern Chinese).
