Upon watching<br>archers shooting a targets, do we assume from the distribution of<br>their arrows that they don't prefer hitting the bull's eye?"<br><br>I'd like to point out why Marion's analogy is out of kilter.<br>First, Marion's analogy presumes that the psychoacoustic test<br>results for interval preference are distributed like arrows that<br>miss a bull's eye.<br>This is incorrect.<br>Arrows that miss a bull's eye have a symmetric radical <br>distribution centered around the bull's eye.  The mean <br>value of the arrows' distribution is thus the center of <br>the bull's eye.<br>But all the psychoacoustic tests done over the last 130<br>years consistently show that the mean value for melodic<br>interval preference is skewed much higher than the target<br>small integer ratios--even though test subjects consistently<br>*hear the intervals as "pure" and "just."*<br>Vertical interval preference mean values are skewed slightly<br>less high, but still significantly higher than the values predicted<br> by the small integer ratio theory of consonance.<br>So let's change Marion McCoskey's analogy to reflect the actual <br>facts.<br>In that case, all the arrows would always be grouped toward the<br>top half of the bull's eye--but when the archers looked at them,<br>they would see *all* the arrows as being exactly dead center in the<br>bull's eye.   The archers could walk up, examine the arrows closely,<br>and they'd still report all the arrows as being dead center of<br>the bull's eye.<br>This correct analogy is bizarre and counterintuitive enough that<br>it captures the striking nature of the psychoacoustic results.<br><br>But these are not the only problems with the theory of consonance<br>according to small integer ratios.  J. Murray Barbour has pointed<br>out other evidence against the small integer theory in his 1938 <br>paper "Just Intonation Confuted," in Music and Letters,<br>Vol. 19, 1938, pp. 48-60, when he adduces evidence that the<br>tonal fusion of which Helmholtz spoke does not occur in the<br>way or for the small integer ratios Helmholtz's theory predicts:<br>"This extraordinary conclusion received complete and necessary<br>confirmation through experiments conducted by Guthrie and Morrill <br>at the University of Washington.  They used the impressive number<br>of 753 student observers and tested a far greater number<br>of intervals--forty-four within an interval slightly larger than<br>a fifth. The averages of such an array of judgments compel<br>respect.  The best fused of all intervals tested was a major third,<br>approximately the third of equal temperament, 2/3 comma sharper <br>than the just third. The preferred values for fifth and minor third<br>were similarly sharp. This report states emphatically that no<br>preference whatever was shown for just or for equally temered<br>intervals, and that slight resemblance exists between curves of<br>consonance and Helmholtz's theoretical curves.<br>"These experiments prove conclusively that Helmholtz and his<br>followers are wrong, that singers have no predeliction for the so-<br>called natural or just intervals, not even the major third (5/4), the <br>interval which most surely distinguishes just intonation from equal<br>temperament or the Pythagorean tuning."  [J. Murray Barbour, "Just<br>Intonation Confuted," Music and Letters, Vol. 19, 1938, pp.  58-63] <br>Further on, Barbour points out:<br>"Singers show no natural preference for these [just] intervals. They <br>are likely to overleap a desired pitch by a comma or more, after<br>having swooped up to it from a whole tone below.  They are<br>very fond of portamento.<br>"Athough the great lack of accuracy revealed in artistic singing<br>is mentioned here to destroy the myth that signers do use or<br>can use just intonation, it by no means follows that the<br>popular antithesis 'singers and musicians' is a truism. It is pointed<br>out in [Carl Stumpf's] Iowa study that although 'singers in the <br>physical sense are never on pitch, in another sense, the <br>perceptual, they are heard as on pitch.'" [J. Murray Barbour, "Just<br>Intonation Confuted," Music and Letters, Vol. 19, 1938, pp.  58-63] <br>Other  experiments from the 1990s show that "waves with the same<br>period can lead to average octave judgments that differ <br>consistently by more than half an octave, and that a substantial<br>component of many timbre differences is actually a tone-height<br>difference." [Patterson, R. D., Robert Milroy and Michael Allerhand,<br>"What is the octave of a harmonically rich note?" Contemporary<br>Music Review, 1993, Vol. 9, parts I & 2, pp. 69-81]<br>This flagrantly violates the small-integer doctrine.<br>You can try some simple experiments that destroy the credibility<br>of the theory of consonance according to small integer ratios<br>on your own if you have a  precise tunable synthesizer or Csound:<br>[1] Tune up the dyad 1: (sqrt(3/2)  i.e., the ratio<br>1: 1.2247449   <br>Starting at 320 Hz this would give a dyad with note<br>frequencies of 320 Hz, 391.91836 Hz.<br>Now tune up the dyad 45/32 and compare the two.<br>(Starting at 450 Hz this would give a dyad with note<br>frequencies of 320 Hz, 450 Hz.)<br>Because the ratio 45/32 is a much smaller ratio than<br>the irrational number (anathema to the mystic<br>numerology of small whole numbers) square root of 3/2,<br>the small-number consonance myth  predicts that <br>the  just intonation 45/32 tritone will sound more consonant<br>than the geometric-mean neutral third.<br>However, the irrational-ratio neutral third clearly sounds<br>much more consonant.<br>[2] Tune up 11/9 and compare it to 9/8.  Which sounds more<br>consonant?<br>The 9/8 uses smaller numbers and should please the ear more,<br>according to the smaller integer theory of consonance.  But<br>the 11/9 is clearly a more consonant interval. (Various forum<br>subscribers will predictably claim that the ear hears the 11/9<br>as a 5/4 or a 6/5 in this context.  That conflicts drastically<br>with Harry Partch's experience and prescriptions--namely, that<br>11-limit odentities and udentities are clearly and unmistakably<br>heard as unique intervals with distinctive sonic characteristics<br>entirely apart from the 5-limit odentities and udentities. Anyone<br>who has listened to Partch's music knows this to be true. If you<br>want to argue with Partch, you've got a real problem, because<br>you're now arguing against the acoustic reality of limits higher<br>than the 5-limit.)<br>[3] Tune up a second inversion 4:5:6 chord--that is, a just major<br>chord with a 4/3 in the bass, i.e., a 9:12:15 triad. Now compare it<br>with a 10:12:15 minor chord.<br>The 9:12:15 chord clearly wants to resolve to *something* because<br>the 4/3 in the bass sounds discordant, whereas the 10:12:15 triad<br>sits happily where it is, not requiring any resolution.<br>Harmonic theory for more than four hundred years has recognized<br>that a second inversion chord demands resolution--and yet <br>the progression of a 10:12:15 triad to a 9:12:15 triad clearly<br>sounds like a progression from consonance to dissonance, while<br>the progression of a 9:12:15 to a 10:12:15 triad clearly <br>sounds like a progression from dissonance to consonance.<br>Yet this violates the myth of consonance by small integer<br>ratios.<br>(If you want to *really* blow away the small whole number theory,<br>resolve a 9:12:15 second inversion major triad to an 18:22:27 <br>root-position neutral triad. Again, a dissonance audibly<br>goes to a consonance--yet the numbers go from small to<br>pretty damn large.)<br>[4] Tune up the ratio 3:5:7 and then tune up the ratio 18:22:27.<br>Which one sounds more consonant?<br>Clearly the neutral triad 18:22:27 sounds quite consonant, while<br>the 3:5:7  just  triad sounds quite dissonant. Again,<br>however, this violates the theory of consonance by small <br>integer ratios.<br>[5] Tune up the 7:5 and then tune up the ratio 11:9.  Which<br>dyad sounds more consonant?<br>Clearly the 7:5 tritone sounds much less consonant than the<br>11:9 neutral third, yet this too violates the theory of <br>consonance by small integers.<br>Many forum subscribers will claim that the ear approximates large<br>ratios by smaller ones automatically--this does NOT solve the<br>problem, for it simply puts us on the slippery slope.

" [Cazden, Norman, "The Definition  of Consonance <br>and Dissonance," International Review of the  Aesthetics <br>and Sociology of Music, 1980, Vol. 2, pp. 123-168]<br>Worse yet, the small whole number theory of consonance<br>has an shady and very unsavory past. <br>"In its most general axiomatic form, the Natural Law<br>theory states that consonance results from the ratios<br>of small whole numbers.<br>"Crystallization of that axiom was ascribed by his<br>disciples to Pythagoras, though undoubtedly its basis<br>has been widely known to acient civilizations.  However,<br>inseparably from the strictly musical relevance of the<br>principles, the magic of 'numbers come to life as music'<br>has long been linked more to the marvels of mystic<br>cosmologies and numerological speculations<br>than to any indications bearing on the practice of music<br>as an art. It is accordingly noteworthy that for the purposes<br>of speculative ventures devoted to wonderment over the <br>'harmony of the spheres,' the musical relevance tends ever<br>to remain remote and elementary. Typically their relevations<br>have applied more to the raw ingredients that are later<br>transformed into music, to tuning formulas or to the derivation <br>and naming of scale degrees, than to musical relationships<br>proper.  So tenuous and curiously pre-musical a handling is<br>retained down to the present day in the fanciful use of musical<br>metaphor that inspires the still extensive literature of<br>number mysticism, such as occasionally also entices <br>students with musical training and experience." [Cazden, Norman,<br>"The Definition of Consonance and Dissonance," International<br>Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music, 1980, Vol. 2,<br>pp. 123-168] <br>As J.

However,<br>inseparably from the strictly musical relevance of the<br>principles, the magic of 'numbers come to life as music'<br>has long been linked more to the marvels of mystic<br>cosmologies and numerological speculations<br>than to any indications bearing on the practice of music<br>as an art. It is accordingly noteworthy that for the purposes<br>of speculative ventures devoted to wonderment over the <br>'harmony of the spheres,' the musical relevance tends ever<br>to remain remote and elementary. Typically their relevations<br>have applied more to the raw ingredients that are later<br>transformed into music, to tuning formulas or to the derivation <br>and naming of scale degrees, than to musical relationships<br>proper.  So tenuous and curiously pre-musical a handling is<br>retained down to the present day in the fanciful use of musical<br>metaphor that inspires the still extensive literature of<br>number mysticism, such as occasionally also entices <br>students with musical training and experience." [Cazden, Norman,<br>"The Definition of Consonance and Dissonance," International<br>Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music, 1980, Vol. 2,<br>pp. 123-168] <br>As J. Murray Barbour put it, the theory of small whole number<br>ratios "has always been a beautiful theory. Its devotees have been<br>drawn chiefly from the ranks of mystics and philosophers--<br>mathematicians who knew no music and musicians who knew <br>no mathematics." [Barbour, J.
