It<br>is selling for $399 at Sam Ash.  The module has several different<br>present scales (pelog, "Arabic", just, etc.) and the ability, so I'm<br>told, to make your own microtonal scales, not limited to the 12-note<br>octave.  True?  Easy to use?  Fine tunable?  I'd appreciate any reports,<br>advice.<br><br>2) There was also a used Roland JV-1080 for $799.  It seemed a bit more<br>complicated to make user-defined scales.  Anyone out there with<br>experience with this module?  Thanks again...</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Korg X5 DR and Roland JV-1080</h1><h3><a id=7439 href="#7439">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Andrew L.
