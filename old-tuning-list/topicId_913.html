I hope you don't mind if I<br>forward them to the tuning list.  For any of you tuning listers who don't<br>already know, Bart Hopkin (barthopkin@aol.com) is the editor of Experimental<br>Musical Instruments magazine.  Here are some thoughts on your thoughts:  <br><br>> I don't know the context in which the question came up, ... the machine work<br>> involved in realizing a new valve design is pretty prohibitive for <br>> anyone without great expertise and a shop full of good equipment -- is that a<br>> factor here, or can we speculate freely about theoretically possible designs<br>> without worrying about who would actually build them? <br><br>   I was thinking in terms of having whatever equipment is necessary at hand.<br>I'm not sure about the person who posted the original query though.  <br><br><br><br>> Also, is the intent to have something which remains playable in 12, or<br>> can we start from scratch in designing a 19-tone instrument?  <br><br>   I personally was thinking in terms of something that is "upward compatible"<br>in a sense.  By that I mean something wherein the additional fingering<br>possibilities 19TET offers go down as a reasonably intuitive variant on<br>traditional fingerings.  So, to use one of my examples, separate right- and<br>left-hand valve sets would be fairly easy to adjust to, especially for those who<br>have played both trumpet and F.horn.  <br><br>   But there certainly is value in just plain starting over anew, which your<br>suggestion below addresses.  <br><br><br><br>> For a pure 19-tone trumpet, I'd be inclined to think of just having four<br>> valves, at 1, 2, 3 and 4 nineteenths <br>> of an octave.  In various combinations that would allow for the ten<br>> increments (actually yielding 11 scale <br>> steps) you need to fill in the diminished fifth between the "fundamental" and<br>> the next available overblown <br>> tone a fifth above.  There are tuning accuracy issues here, having to do with<br>> the fact that how much tubing <br>> you add to achieve a given drop in pitch depends on how long the tube was<br>> before pressing the valve, <br>> which depends on which valves were already pressed.  So you'd want to think<br>> through the intended <br>> fingerings and then calculate how much added tubing should be associated with<br>> each valve to arrive at the <br>> best compromises.  In light of that, it might turn out that, to optimise<br>> tuning accuracy, the fourth valve <br>> should add enough for 5/19 relative to some configuration of other pressed<br>> valvles. These tuning questions <br>> are a routine part of valved instrument design, and the situation is actually<br>> quite forgiving because brass <br>> instruments lend themselves well to being lipped into tune. The idea of four<br>> valves is quite natural and not <br>> difficult to play -- lots of low brass have 4, especially wide-bore<br>> instruments. <br>> The other option that strikes me is you could use a standard trumpet valving<br>> system, and then just add a <br>> fourth 1/19th valve.  This allows you to get close enough to all the tones in<br>> 19 that you could then bring <br>> them in tune with the little tuning slide with the finger ring.  Simple!  But<br>> what a drag to have to play such <br>> a thing.  <br>> Denny's idea of interchangeable valving sections strikes me as a reasonable<br>> and do-able one, though I <br>> spose it might be expensive.  <br>> Another tempting thought: would it be possible to set up the finger buttons<br>> so that they added tubing length <br>> by sliding slides rather than controlling valves that re-direct the air flow?<br>> Advantages: infinite variability <br>> (but they could be "notched" or have stoppers so that they click into desired<br>> positions.  These posibitions <br>> could be made adjustable.) Also, simpler construction for home builders.<br>>  Disadvantages: Leak-proof slides <br>> might be too stiff for easy operation.  Also, the "throw" of the button<br>> probably wouldn't be enough to move <br>> the slide far enough for the desired pitch drops.  You'd end up having to<br>> lever it up somehow, which would <br>> add a slew of potential problems. Oh well.
