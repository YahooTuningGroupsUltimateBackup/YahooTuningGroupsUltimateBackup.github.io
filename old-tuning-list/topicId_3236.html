Well, for one thing, they're<br>strictly audio CDs, mostly containing spoken quizzes.  They contain groups<br>of exercises, each group typically taking about 3-8 minutes, and each quiz<br>question taking about a 4-5 seconds total.  The answer is usually a pitch<br>that I must sing correctly, or a note name or chord type I must identify -<br>that sort of thing.  After a pause for me to answer the question, the CD<br>states the correct answer so that I can check myself.  I short, it's a CD<br>of me quizzing myself about various 88CET ear-training concerns.  Each<br>group of exercises has a few sentences explaining the nature of the<br>exercise.<br><br>   As an example, here is a pretty-much verbatim transcript of my narration<br>on a short fragment of these CDs:<br><br>          "Now let's do that same thing with absolute pitches.<br>           I'll play a first tone and name its pitch, then<br>           play a second that is one of the nontraditional<br>           thirds above or below the first. Your task is to<br>           identify the absolute pitch of the second tone.<br>           Here is an A.  [an A plays for about a second, then<br>           switches to the next higher C]  What is this pitch?<br>           [pause for about two seconds]  That's a C.  This<br>           is a B.  [a B sounds then changes to a D]  What is<br>           this? [pause for about two seconds]  That's a D."<br><br>The pauses of course are for me to answer the question, which I can check<br>when I announce the correct answer.  Some answers require more time to<br>formulate or simply to speak than others.<br><br>   And it continues that quiz with a few dozen more note pairs for about a<br>minute and a half, and then moves on to exercises on various other<br>intervals.<br><br>   There are also quizzes also about circle-of-fifths nomenclature,<br>nontraditional interval singing, pseudokey (I'll explain that concept<br>shortly) signatures, singing scales with correct note names, distinguishing<br>nontraditional thirds, and many other topics.</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>88CET Ear-Training CDs, Part 3</h1><h3><a id=7293 href="#7293">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>3/24/1998 6:55:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>But anyway, jumping back to the question at hand, if these "ear-training<br>CDs" aren't CD-ROMs, then what are they?
