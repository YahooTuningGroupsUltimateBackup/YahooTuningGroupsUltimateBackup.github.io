Apart from the most obvious works that evoke<br>strong emotional responses in me (Brusckner's 9th symphony, and in<br>particular the climax in the 3rd movement; Tristan and Isolde,<br>especially Act2; etc) the works that have caused me the largest<br>response seem totally other to the ones peopel have quoted.  <br><br>I remember listening to a Xenakis harpsicord piece based on group<br>transformations, and the effect of hearing the transformations,<br>following them as they unfolded, was deeply moving.  I had a similar<br>response to hearing Xenaki's Ikhoor for the first time.  For the kind<br>of emotional release that removes all stress, and internal tension,<br>nothing beats Birtwistle (Earth Dance or Secret Theatre).<br><br>I sometimes wonder if there are not two classes of people in this<br>respect.  The Unknown Public CD no. 08 is all about sensuality, but to<br>be the majority of the pieces are trite and sentimental.  I like<br>"spikey" music.  I like discords.  Can one really listen to barbershop<br>music for more than 5 minutes without feeling sick?<br><br>I have had a version of this discussion with a composer friend who was<br>comparing his music with my attempts.  He asserted that his was<br>emotional and personal, while mine was mathematical and cold -- he<br>meant this as a discription rather than a critisism.  My problem is<br>that to me my music is mathematical and intensely emotional.  It moves<br>me and excites me; why else would I write it?  Indeed the phrase<br>"mathematical and cold" seems to me an oxymoron.  When I was a student<br>my reaction to the Schroder-Bernstein theorem was emotional<br>excitement.  I would write out the proof for the pleasure of seeing<br>the result emerge.  I am not suggesting that everyone sees the world<br>this way; but some of us do.

Is a great theme somehow a<br><br>> great musical theorem and the musical development of the theme its proof?<br><br><br>   Musical math, to me, is a lot like any other form of applied math:  It's<br>a model of how our ears hear (or a collection of models actually).  That in<br>the sense that it's based upon experimental observation, and can be used to<br>predict structures that may prove musically useful - structures that would<br>have been hard to predict otherwise.  And as with any other model, its<br>predictions must be tested experimentally in real music.  <br><br>   As for proofs though...  That's probably be a pretty good analogy at the<br>level of musical form and, as John suggested, thematic development.  Most<br>classical forms, are designed to make the unfolding of the music not only<br>interesting and emotionally exciting, but also to take on a sense of<br>inevitability, indeed somewhat like a mathematical proof.  <br><br>   I doubt, however, if there's much similarity between mathematical proofs<br>and, for example, the whole-number-ratio notion of consonance.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 1 Jan 1997 21:43 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06378; Wed, 1 Jan 1997 21:46:43 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06376<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA27407; Wed, 1 Jan 1997 12:46:40 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 1 Jan 1997 12:46:40 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701011543_MC1-E20-3ABB@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4465 href="#4465">ðŸ”—</a>jpff@maths.bath.ac.uk</h3><span>1/2/1997 6:09:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Message written at 2 Jan 1997 12:33:42 +0000<br>In-reply-to: <199701011522_MC1-E20-3ABC@compuserve.com> (message from Gary<br>	Morrison on Wed, 1 Jan 1997 12:45:42 -0800)<br><br>(A slightly off-topic rambling rave from John ff....)<br><br>I have been reading these posts on emotional response with increasing<br>personal confusion.  Apart from the most obvious works that evoke<br>strong emotional responses in me (Brusckner's 9th symphony, and in<br>particular the climax in the 3rd movement; Tristan and Isolde,<br>especially Act2; etc) the works that have caused me the largest<br>response seem totally other to the ones peopel have quoted.  <br><br>I remember listening to a Xenakis harpsicord piece based on group<br>transformations, and the effect of hearing the transformations,<br>following them as they unfolded, was deeply moving.  I had a similar<br>response to hearing Xenaki's Ikhoor for the first time.  For the kind<br>of emotional release that removes all stress, and internal tension,<br>nothing beats Birtwistle (Earth Dance or Secret Theatre).<br><br>I sometimes wonder if there are not two classes of people in this<br>respect.  The Unknown Public CD no. 08 is all about sensuality, but to<br>be the majority of the pieces are trite and sentimental.  I like<br>"spikey" music.  I like discords.  Can one really listen to barbershop<br>music for more than 5 minutes without feeling sick?<br><br>I have had a version of this discussion with a composer friend who was<br>comparing his music with my attempts.  He asserted that his was<br>emotional and personal, while mine was mathematical and cold -- he<br>meant this as a discription rather than a critisism.  My problem is<br>that to me my music is mathematical and intensely emotional.  It moves<br>me and excites me; why else would I write it?  Indeed the phrase<br>"mathematical and cold" seems to me an oxymoron.  When I was a student<br>my reaction to the Schroder-Bernstein theorem was emotional<br>excitement.  I would write out the proof for the pleasure of seeing<br>the result emerge.  I am not suggesting that everyone sees the world<br>this way; but some of us do.  This does of course beg the question as<br>to whether I have this response because I am a mathematician (if only<br>a mediocre one) or whether I am a mathematicaian because I have this<br>response.<br><br>I have a vague memory of some work on tunings or on consonnance which<br>seemed to divide the population into those who heard the beating and<br>disliked it, and those who heard the beating and wanted it.<br><br>Oh well, back to lurking....<br><br>ohn<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 2 Jan 1997 15:54 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00606; Thu, 2 Jan 1997 15:56:51 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00604<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id GAA04047; Thu, 2 Jan 1997 06:56:45 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 2 Jan 1997 06:56:45 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.962093@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4475 href="#4475">ðŸ”—</a>Lionel Dotson &#x3C;ldotson@sprynet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/1997 2:32:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>jpff@maths.bath.ac.uk wrote:<br>> <br>> "spikey" music.
