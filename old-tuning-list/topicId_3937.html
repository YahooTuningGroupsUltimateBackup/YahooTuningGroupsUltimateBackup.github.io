Take 12tET on a conventionally<br>tuned piano.  If you number the piano keys left to right from 1 to 88, you<br>can just take the average (AKA the "arithmetic mean") of the two key numbers<br>to get the tone in question.<br><br>For example, take the C and E at the bottom (left) of a piano.  The C is the<br>4th key, and the E is the 8th key.  The "answer" becomes (4+8)/2, = 6.  The<br>6th note is D.<br><br>The geometric mean of the frequencies is the arithmetic mean of the note<br>numbers.  It works this way because as you go up from note to note, the<br>frequencies go up exponentially.  The math is kind of indirectly relying on<br>this property:<br>        S^(M+N) = S^M * S^N<br>where "*" means "times", and "^" means "to the (power of)".<br><br>Z is the "midpoint" between X and Y, in the sense that you want the interval<br>from X to Z to equal the interval from Z to Y.  As long as there is an even<br>number of semitones between X and Y, the Z will also be an integer.  But if<br>they're an odd number apart, Z will lie on a "quarter tone".  Examples:<br><br>  X            Y                                Z<br>  -   --------------------   --------------------------------------<br>  C   C (an octave higher)   F# (between the C's)<br>  C   G (a "fifth" higher)   E half-flat (halfway between E and Eb)<br><br>With Just Intonation it's the same math, but...
