I think your <br>observation that superparticulars are easier to tune relies on the existence <br>of difference tones, which actually beat against the virtual pitch in the <br>case of superparticulars (tuning is easy: just eliminate this beating). <br>However, I think you can modify the statement to say "an orchestra of <br>generic harmonic timbres played as a reasonably loud volume" without harming <br>your arguments.<br><br>Secondly, I find myself agreeing with much of your approach, especially <br>since I have included an algorithm for "evaluation of relative complexity," <br>exactly as you defined it, as an appendix of a paper that will appear in <br>Xenharmonikon. I'm relying on Goldstein's 1973 JASA paper, along with some <br>number theory, for this algorithm. I can provide you with details of the <br>algorithm if you like, but let me note that I have found that for listeners <br>with slightly above-average pitch resolution, the 12-tET minor triad will be <br>heard mainly as 10:12:15 and as 16:19:24, the winner depending on voicing, <br>and assuming the triad is in a register that puts some audible partials in <br>Goldstein's optimal frequency range. The latter assumption my algorithm <br>cannot do without, so it is only good for finding the "worst-case" or most <br>complex representations of a particular tuning's intervals and chords. If <br>your algorithm succesfully extends this to the case of arbitrary given <br>register, I will congratulate you. (I suggest you take a look at Goldstein's <br>paper if you haven't yet).<br><br>I would not be surprised if you are correct that 4:5:6 is happier than <br>10:12:15 since it requires less brain effort. However, I don't think it <br>makes much musical difference whether the minor triad is heard as 10:12:15, <br>or 16:19:24, or a combination of the two. My algorithm actually gives a <br>greater salience to the p5 alone than to the minor triad, suggesting that <br>the minor triad is actually heard most significantly as 2:x:3, where x is a <br>non-harmonic tone not integrated into the virtual pitch sensation evoked by <br>the 2:3. (Unfortunately, I have no justification for directly comparing a <br>2-note salience to a 3-note salience, but it seems to work fine.) The <br>salient musical properties of the minor triad relative to the major triad <br>are: (1) the p5 defining a clear root, which is not, however, reinforced by <br>the third, and (2) a similar level of roughness and beating as is found in <br>the major triad. The sadness of the minor triad is then due simply to its <br>greater harmonic indefiniteness, without any extra roughness that could <br>contribute "anger" or "fear" into the perception.<br><br> -Paul<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 25 Sep 1996 09:47 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA24127; Wed, 25 Sep 1996 07:43:44 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA26025<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id WAA04669; Tue, 24 Sep 1996 22:43:42 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 24 Sep 1996 22:43:42 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199609250543.WAA26562@si.UCSC.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>RE: Pitch spacings</h1><h3><a id=3667 href="#3667">ðŸ”—</a>PAULE &#x3C;ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/1996 7:40:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Daniel-<br><br>Firstly, let me note that your assumption that "we are listening to an <br>orchestra of sine waves" does not bode well for the perception of <br>subharmonic complexes as such, since, as you state, the subharmonic complex <br>is recognized "by guiding tone (the lowest pitch<br>common to the spectra of all pitches in the complex)."
