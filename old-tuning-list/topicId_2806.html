But one should remember that fretted instruments had been<br>tuned either in Pythagorean tuning or in an approximation of the 12-tone<br>equal tuning since the Middle Ages - perhaps since antiquity. The<br>possibility of using the 1/3 comma mesotonic (or the virtually identical<br>19-tone equal system,) whose invention is usually attributed to<br>Francisco Salinas (1571) , seems to have remained quite  unknown to most<br>composers, and never became widespread, probably through conservatism<br>and the attachment of musicians to the 12-tone keyboard.<br><br>As will shortly be seen, Guillaume Costeley (pronounce: coat-lay)<br>expressly states that he used an octave divided into equal 1/3 tones,<br>and also expressly refers to 19 pitches in the octave, in a preface of<br>1570, a year before Salinas mathematically defined the 1/3 comma<br>mesotonic, which is aurally absolutely identical to the 19-tone equal.<br>Probably this tuning was 'in the air', and both men independently<br>discovered slightly different ways of defining the same system. Costeley<br>finds the 19-tone equal far superior to any other tuning.<br><br>The relevant passage is printed in Les Ma?tres Musiciens de la<br>Renaissance Fran?aise, and precedes Costeley's celebrated chromatic<br>motet "Seigneur Dieu Ta piti?". I give a translation:<br><br>[After a greeting to his friends, and a general praise of music, there<br>follows:]<br><br>"Now I do not doubt that you gentlemen find it strange that I should<br>have exceeded in certain of my compositions the usual limits of the<br>tones [i.e. the diatonics plus C#, Eb, F#, G# or Ab, & Bb - he implies<br>that he has used Db, D#, E#, Fb, Gb,A#, B# & Cb in some of his<br>compostions, which exceed the usual limits of the mesotonic tuning then<br>prevailing on keyboards, and the usual limits of the pythagorean as<br>well] of which usual limits I am not ignorant.<br><br>"I reply to these possible criticisms, first, that I have wished to<br>provide the most excellent choristers of our Most Christian, Magnanimous<br>and most Royally Born King of FRANCE (whom may God long preserve among<br>us) with all that which might most please our Master. But I have done<br>this [i.e. added these new tones to music] without ever going out of the<br>key [this phrase admits of differing interpretations, but probably means<br>that by the use of 1/3 tones he can more exactly preserve the mode when<br>it has been modulated to a new key], and withal so that I might render<br>our music more airy [he probably means, more harmonious, or perhaps less<br>polyphonic and more dramatic, or else more freely modulated].<br><br>"As for the song that follows, I composed it 12 long years ago as an<br>experiment, to render more practical an idea that I had, which I hoped<br>should give a sweeter and more agreeable music than the diatonic,<br>provided it were well and skillfully handled. This new music has its<br>voices separated by intervals of one-third tone [instead of by unequal<br>fractions of a tone, or else by more or less equal semitones]. And this<br>[possibility] points up how far from perfection are the designs of our<br>organs and spinets, inasmuch as they have but 7 diatonics and 5<br>accidentals in the octave, whereas perfection requires not 5, but 12<br>accidentals, which a good workman [with a skilful] design can introduce<br>into the keyboard without making it unplayably complex. And when by<br>these equal 1/3 tones we dispose the diatonics and accidentals in their<br>natural order, we possess a marvelously new and pleasing instrument,<br>without which the song which I have composed for it cannot be played.<br><br>"By using this 19-tone instrument tuned by 1/3 tones, we can always<br>modulate [d?tonner] without discord [for the requisite accidental is<br>always present, just as it is on the 12-tone keyboards, but with far<br>less sweetness in the harmony, and the requisite accidental is by no<br>means available in the 1/4 comma mesotonic, unless it be carried to an<br>unmanageable 31 tones in the octave]. For we can always lower or raise a<br>note by 1/3 or 2/3 of a tone as needed [to fit the new key].<br><br>"There is no further need to speak of semitones, for in this tuning<br>there are none [he means, the chromatic and diatonic semitones are no<br>longer equal, the former being but half the width of the latter]. Our<br>lutes as usually tuned suffer from the same imperfection as our keyboard<br>instruments, although by its natural sweetness even the most delicate<br>ears rarely find anything amiss with it. [He means perhaps that good<br>players adjust the unequal semitones of the mesotonic as needed, it<br>being remembered that the lute's tones are not prolonged, which tends to<br>mask bad harmony - or perhaps he even means that lute-players used an<br>approximation of 12-tone equal temperament, though this is very<br>doubtful.] Therefore the perfect music such as I have suggested has not<br>been more practiced on the lute than on organs or spinets [despite the<br>lute's movable frets], for it imperatively requires the use of all the<br>1/3 tones. Well-played violins have the advantage over the<br>above-mentioned instruments in this regard, inasmuch as they can be<br>played justly without the division of the octave into any particular<br>intervals.<br><br>"Now the true difference between flats and sharps, between flats and<br>naturals, or between sharps and naturals, is 1/3 tone. For example,<br>between Bb and B is 1/3 tone, and between Eb and E is 1/3 tone again.<br>But on the other hand between F# and G is 2/3 tone. I have marked this<br>distinction whenever necessary for the sake of clarity. For most<br>musicians and singers have hitherto confounded sharps and flats. But<br>only when a G for example is twice flatted, is it the same as F#.<br><br>"As for all other information regarding this matter, I leave it sirs, to<br>your most reliable and equitable judgement, which will permit you to<br>benefit from my labors, both now and in the future.
