I've been using it for a while now<br>and you can't beat the resolution.  To me, it's a lot easier to use than<br>say Common Music or Lisp, but it depends on your goal.  MSP is really good<br>for Algorithmic stuff (ala Max), but not so good for score driven stuff<br>(ala Csound).  I've made a JI/flexitune software synth with MSP that has<br>pitch resolution to .001 cents.  You can ideally have resolution up to<br>0.000001 Hz, but I don't need THAT much resolution.
