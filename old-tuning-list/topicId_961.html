For two<br>pure tones in a typical register, there is no dissonance at the unison,<br>dissonance rises dramatically at a difference of about 1/12 tone,<br>maximal dissonance occurs at a difference of about 1/8 tone, and falls<br>off gradually to zero at a difference of about a minor third. Total<br>dissonance is defined as the sum over all pure tone pairs of the<br>pairwise dissonances. Therefore, for typical harmonic timbres, the most<br>dissonant interval of all is the unison detuned by 1/8 tone, since every<br>partial of one note is 1/8 tone away from an equally loud partial of the<br>other note. The second most dissonant interval is the octave detuned by<br>1/8 tone, since every partial of the higher note is 1/8 tone away from a<br>somewhat quieter partial of the lower note. The third or fourth most<br>dissonant interval is the perfect fifth detuned by 1/8 tone, since every<br>other partial of the higher note is 1/8 tone from an almost as loud<br>partial of the lower note. With inharmonic timbres such as found in the<br>gamelan, this last interval is not necessarily dissonant at all, since<br>there is nothing resembling a third harmonic partial in the tones (the<br>octave is produced, to a small extent, by the ear and/or brain --<br>witness phenomena such as second-order beating). If one looks at the<br>graphs of dissonance versus interval size for complex harmonic tones in<br>any of these references, one will see the highest peaks lying a very<br>short distance from the lowest troughs (the latter are at the simplest<br>ratios). These peaks are very narrow because all the pairs of partials<br>involved rise in dissonance as one approaches the peak, and they all<br>fall off in dissonance as one retreats from it. So these are examples of<br>your type (2) dissonance.<br><br>Now consider an interval such as 11/9. The 6th partial of the lower tone<br>is about 1/6 tone off the 5th partial of the higher tone, and the 5th<br>partial of the lower tone is about 1/6 tone off the 4th partial of the<br>higher tone. As one enlarges the interval, the former pair will fall off<br>in dissonance, while the latter pair will intensify in dissonance until<br>one is about 1/8 tone flat of a 5/4. Similarly there is both an increase<br>and a decrease in dissonance as one decreases the interval to about 1/8<br>tone sharp of a 6/5. Since the total dissonance is the sum of the<br>dissonances of the pairs of partials, there is a bit of a plateau of<br>total dissonance around 11/9. So this is an example of your type (1)<br>dissonance. This plateau is not as high as the peaks that flank the<br>simplest ratios. If the partials through the 11th are audible (as on a<br>piano), one can tune the 11/9 exactly by eliminating the beating.<br>However, the beatings between the 6th and 5th partials of the lower note<br>and the 5th and 4th partials of the upper nore will be more powerful and<br>therefore the 11/9 will represent a very minor local minimum of<br>dissonance at best.<br><br>One can also consider the virtual pitch/harmonic entropy component of<br>dissonance, which leads to similar conclusions.

For two<br>pure tones in a typical register, there is no dissonance at the unison,<br>dissonance rises dramatically at a difference of about 1/12 tone,<br>maximal dissonance occurs at a difference of about 1/8 tone, and falls<br>off gradually to zero at a difference of about a minor third. Total<br>dissonance is defined as the sum over all pure tone pairs of the<br>pairwise dissonances. Therefore, for typical harmonic timbres, the most<br>dissonant interval of all is the unison detuned by 1/8 tone, since every<br>partial of one note is 1/8 tone away from an equally loud partial of the<br>other note. The second most dissonant interval is the octave detuned by<br>1/8 tone, since every partial of the higher note is 1/8 tone away from a<br>somewhat quieter partial of the lower note. The third or fourth most<br>dissonant interval is the perfect fifth detuned by 1/8 tone, since every<br>other partial of the higher note is 1/8 tone from an almost as loud<br>partial of the lower note. With inharmonic timbres such as found in the<br>gamelan, this last interval is not necessarily dissonant at all, since<br>there is nothing resembling a third harmonic partial in the tones (the<br>octave is produced, to a small extent, by the ear and/or brain --<br>witness phenomena such as second-order beating). If one looks at the<br>graphs of dissonance versus interval size for complex harmonic tones in<br>any of these references, one will see the highest peaks lying a very<br>short distance from the lowest troughs (the latter are at the simplest<br>ratios). These peaks are very narrow because all the pairs of partials<br>involved rise in dissonance as one approaches the peak, and they all<br>fall off in dissonance as one retreats from it. So these are examples of<br>your type (2) dissonance.<br><br>Now consider an interval such as 11/9. The 6th partial of the lower tone<br>is about 1/6 tone off the 5th partial of the higher tone, and the 5th<br>partial of the lower tone is about 1/6 tone off the 4th partial of the<br>higher tone. As one enlarges the interval, the former pair will fall off<br>in dissonance, while the latter pair will intensify in dissonance until<br>one is about 1/8 tone flat of a 5/4. Similarly there is both an increase<br>and a decrease in dissonance as one decreases the interval to about 1/8<br>tone sharp of a 6/5. Since the total dissonance is the sum of the<br>dissonances of the pairs of partials, there is a bit of a plateau of<br>total dissonance around 11/9. So this is an example of your type (1)<br>dissonance. This plateau is not as high as the peaks that flank the<br>simplest ratios. If the partials through the 11th are audible (as on a<br>piano), one can tune the 11/9 exactly by eliminating the beating.<br>However, the beatings between the 6th and 5th partials of the lower note<br>and the 5th and 4th partials of the upper nore will be more powerful and<br>therefore the 11/9 will represent a very minor local minimum of<br>dissonance at best.<br><br>One can also consider the virtual pitch/harmonic entropy component of<br>dissonance, which leads to similar conclusions. I will discuss this if<br>you wish.</div>
