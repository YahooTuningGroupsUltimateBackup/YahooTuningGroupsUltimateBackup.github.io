My experience of Tibetan music has<br>been that of an intonationally flexible affair, with the instruments often<br>using very different tunings (with beats between instruments common) and<br>the voices adjusting their choice of melodic pitches to instrumental<br>reference pitches and perhaps to pitches found in harmonic spectra (i.e.<br>sometimes using a lower neighbor tone around an 8/7 below the reciting<br>tone).<br><br>The best scholarship, by the way, on Tibetan music, is that of Ter<br>Ellingson. (In fact, all previous work in the field is superseded). Tuning,<br>however, does not feature in Ellingson's work.
