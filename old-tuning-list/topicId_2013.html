Some of the experiments I discussed with <br>John Chalmers provide evidence for this belief. For example, John (in Tuning <br>Digest 1008) and I both heard that a chord tuned 0 400 720 was clearly <br>"better" than a chord tuned 0 372 720, even though the M3 and P5 are equally <br>false in both chords. (To refute an explanation based on a preference for <br>stretched intervals, use the first inversion of these chords.) Therefore it <br>matters whether you're using the best possible m3 in a particular tuning; <br>just using the best M3 and the best P5 does not guarantee the best major <br>triad. For example, try 64-tet. There the best perfect fifth is 37 steps, <br>and the best major third is 21 steps. Changing either of these by 1 to give <br>a better minor third of 17 steps improves the major triad. 64-tet is <br>actually an interesting tuning; it is the simplest equal temperament that <br>contains all "tonal" systems (defined according to my paper on 22-tET, the <br>systems are pentatonic, diatonic, and a new system first found in 22-tET and <br>described at length in that paper).<br><br>The above assumes that the "best" tuning of a major triad is 4:5:6, a <br>statement which causes little serious controversy. Unfortunately things are <br>not so simple for the minor triad. The 10:12:15 (or 1/6:1/5:1/4) tuning is <br>lowest in roughness, but for a typical root-position voicing, <br>(4:8:12:)16:19:24 will sound more stable. Gary Morrison has pointed out that <br>there can be two different types of consonance judgments operating at the <br>same time; I believe that one is based on roughness while the other is based <br>on various factors having to do with how well the tones fit into a single <br>harmonic series. 16:19:24 is typically still within the "dip" in the <br>roughness function whose local minimum is at 10:12:15, so 16:19:24 is still <br>less rough than just about any triad besides the major. To me a <br>root-position minor triad sounds out-of-tune as 10:12:15, although I think <br>12:15:20 (1/5:1/4:1/3) is a very sweet first-inversion minor triad.<br><br>So it is possible that the best thirds for the major triad are different <br>that the best thirds for the minor triad. It destroys a lot of the <br>mathematical beauty of 5-limit theory by bringing in the 19th harmonic, but <br>I have to let my ears be the final arbiter, and in this case they tell be <br>that the 19th harmonic is important.<br><br>A much-ignored study by Pierce and Roberts (I think; it's from the book <br>_Harmony and Tonality_) found that untrained listeners generally fall into <br>two categories, "pure" and "rich." The pure listeners liked just 4:5:6 and <br>3:5:7 triads better than versions of those chords where the middle tone was <br>displaced by +/-15 or +/-30 cents, while the rich listeners like the <br>15-cents-off versions of the chords best, with no particular preference <br>between a +15 and a -15 cent "error" However, for 10:12:15 (or 1/6:1/5:1/4) <br>chords, both classes of listeners preferred the version where the middle <br>tone was lowered by 15 cents. The authors of the article did not provide <br>much of an explanation of this phenomenon. Note that although the 15-cent <br>shift has about the same effect on roughness for both major and minor <br>triads, the listeners may have been motivated not so much by the small <br>differences in roughness but by a preference for harmonic series. The <br>preferred version of the minor triad is very close to 16:19:24, which has a <br>note octave-equivalent to the fundamental in the bottom voice. Thus in a <br>sense it better resembles a harmonic series than the "just" or 10:12:15 <br>minor triad. The rich listeners may have also been attracted to the beating, <br>which is on the order of 7 times per second for the +/- 15 cent versions of <br>all of these chords.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 5 May 1997 19:27 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05050; Mon, 5 May 1997 19:27:42 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05039<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id KAA05261; Mon, 5 May 1997 10:20:19 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 5 May 1997 10:20:19 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01510100af9364b96491@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5424 href="#5424">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>5/6/1997 6:43:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>It's certainly true, on my opinion and that of most others on this list,<br>that small whole-number ratios are the clearly basic navigational<br>guideposts in pitch space.

Across all responses, there was a strong preference for ET,<br>2.  Among those who scored highest on the raw pitch-acuity section of the<br>    test, there was strong preference for JI.  (The pitch acuity section had<br>    a series of pairs of tones separated by a comma, 13 cents, a quarter<br>    comma, and a skhisma, and the respondents were asked to state whether the<br>    second pitch was lower or higher than the first.)<br>3.  Many of those who preferred JI seemed to have more specific reasons, and<br>    just generally more thoughtful responses.<br><br>   His study also included comments about the nature of their preference<br>either way - whether they preferred it, for example, for having a "richer<br>sound".<br><br>   Dave Hill's address is "ascend11@aol.com".<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net<br>Subject:  Re: testing an experimental tuning program<br>PostedDate:  01-09-97 05:07:06<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  01-09-97 17:17:25-01-09-97 17:38:45,01-09-97 17:38:27-01-09-97 17:38:29<br>DeliveredDate:  01-09-97 17:38:29<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C1256505.0053F85A; Mon, 1 Sep 1997 17:17:10 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10252; Mon, 1 Sep 1997 05:07:06 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 1 Sep 1997 05:07:06 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09594<br>Received: (qmail 21014 invoked from network); 1 Sep 1997 03:07:02 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 1 Sep 1997 03:07:02 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541102b02f9b23ba22@[207.207.3.11]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
