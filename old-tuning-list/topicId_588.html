Their sum is major third (10/9 times 9/8 = 5/4).<br><br>Therefore, it is seen in the above string that between DO and<br>ME in a SCALE, there is NOT a major third interval (10/9 times<br>10/9 is 100/81 and not 5/4).<br><br>2. Chord<br><br>In a tonic major triad, the bass in root position is lowered by<br>the necessary interval (81/80, syntonic comma) so as to become a<br>major third beneath the median, which is a VERY IMPORTANT phenominon<br>in music. The dominant must similarily be lowered, unless this<br>dominant is in soprano.<br><br>Be surprised, therefore, that the octave between BASS and SOPRANO<br>in an SATB chord is not an octave, but an interval sized 81/40.<br><br>    The Tonic Major Chord<br>    =====================<br><br>        Perfect 5th<br>     __________________<br>    |                  |<br>    |                  |<br>   DO ------ ME ------ SO        DO<br>     maj 3rd   min 3rd<br>    |                            |<br>    |____________________________|<br><br>    This is 81/40,  not an octave, but bigger!<br><br>   DO and ME in Scale = 10/9 times 10/9  = 100/81  # Major 3rd<br>   DO and ME in Chord =  9/8 times 10/9  =  5 / 4  = Major 3rd<br>   (DO lowered by 81/80)<br><br>   ME and SO in Scale = 27/25 times  9/8 = 243/200 # Minor 3rd<br>   ME and SO in Chord = 27/25 times 10/9 =  6 / 5  = Minor 3rd<br>   (SO lowered by 81/80)<br><br>When DO happens to be in the alto, and ME in the Soprano: this<br>ME will not tolerate being comparatively so much lower (relative<br>to each other, or to the averaged pitch on the piano) than alto's<br>DO - when the major third is already small, now even smaller by a<br>comma.<br><br>Hence the soprano ME is adjusted upwards by the same sytonic<br>comma (81/80). For this reason, alto remains instead of being<br>lowered like the bass would have to. Now alto and soprano are in<br>tune as major third.<br><br>3. Cadence<br><br>It is eaily seen that in a subdominant chord of a major key, all<br>its component notes are already in tune. The tonic in the bass<br>need not be lowered as in the case of the tonic chord.<br><br>The DO in the subdominant chord need not be lowered. The DO in<br>the bass in a tonic chord must be.<br><br>Hence in the Plagal Cadence, the DO will contradict if remain in<br>a same lower part through both chords (unless this DO is in the<br>alto AND also the soprano is ME, which is raised).<br><br>This explains a very basic rule learned by every student studying<br>Harmony.<br><br>There are many other rules in traditional Harmony and Counterpoint<br>that may be similarly explained.<br><br>4. Modulation<br><br>When a major key modulates to its dominant, the fourth note raises<br>by a chromatic semitone of 25/24 becoming the seventh note.<br><br>The third note now becomes a bigger whole tone from the sharpened<br>fourth note than the required smaller whole tone needed between<br>the new sixth and seventh notes. It has to be raised by a comma<br>(81/80). So does the second note in becoming the fifth.<br><br>Hence in modulation of a major key to its dominant, three, not one,<br>notes need be adjusted in pitch.<br><br>5. Keys<br><br>The intonation of different keys is such that the largest<br>number of notes on the open strings of the violin can be<br>played in tune on the scale/chords.<br><br>Observe the following sequence that is derived from the major scale:<br><br>ME     TE     RE     FA     LA     DO     SO<br>   P5     mr3    mr3    Mj3    mr3     P5<br><br>P5 = Perfect 5th<br>mr3= Minor 3rd<br>Mj3= Major 3rd<br><br>Because perfect fifths and minor thirds are larger than averaged<br>intervals (as on piano), notes on the right are also relatively<br>higher than those on their left (except FA and LA which is major<br>third).<br><br>Hence we have more chances of finding in performance the dominant,<br>tonic and subdominant notes out of tune sounding too flat.<br><br>In particular, if the note SO is tuned accurately to, say, A 440,<br>which is the D major, all the other notes on the violin will<br>become lower than those corresponding notes on the piano. Hence<br>the D major is obviously a low key.<br><br>Brahms made an exception in his violin concerto. By going through<br>the D minor, he caused the subsequent D major to raise by a comma<br>in pitch. By doing so correctly one should find no trouble with the<br>subsequent double stops, nor passages in the second movement when<br>it modulates.<br><br>When A 440 become the LA as in C major, the open E string is<br>higher than required inside the scale, but good in the soprano of<br>a tonic major chord.<br><br>The F major is a dilemma. If A 440 and E 660 are in tune as<br>respectively the ME and TE, the whole F major is high and the<br>open strings G 195.56 is too low for RE, and open D 293.33 too<br>low for LA.<br><br>Or the G and D may be followed, leaving the A and E strings too<br>high.<br><br>As performing musicians commonly know, the F major IS high.<br><br>Beethoven made some exceptions. When the violin and piano swapped<br>their respective roles of soloist and accompaniment in the opening<br>of the Spring Sonata, the violin played in the lower pitch in<br>the lower string. If this has not happened, the Spring Sonata may<br>probably not sound like spring. Nor will it sound like spring if<br>a violinist does not observe such fact.<br><br>Unit used below is 1 / 4096 of a half-tone. Or, octave is divided<br>into 12 x 4096 equal divisions.

As the dominant key of F major, the note E in the scale is in<br>   tune on the open E string.<br><br>2. As the subdominant key of G major, the notes D and A in the<br>   scale are in tune on these open strings.<br><br>3. As the subdominant of the subdominant key of D major, the note<br>   G is in tune on the open G string.<br><br>The following analysis shows how Beethoven manipulated such<br>modulation:<br><br>At bar 239 of the first movement of the Violin Concerto, the<br>music is A major. At bar 247, it modulates to its simple A minor.<br>At bar 258, the note E in the chord C major is held by five<br>instruments. As previously explained, this top note being the<br>third of the (tonic) major chord, must be a comma higher.<br>However, this note is sustained from previously, and is not<br>possible to the open E string. The low E is in tune to the open G<br>string.<br><br>At bar 260, these two notes remain unchanged. The low E is then<br>sustained in the second violin until bar 264. Here, the chord<br>becomes a C major seventh. All notes must be in tune. The note C<br>in the bass is in tune with the sustained low E in the second<br>violin, and is also in tune to the open G string. This C is<br>sustained in the bass until bar 268. The chord becomes tonic C<br>major. The top note C must be higher than the C in the bass by a<br>comma. Hence the tonic C major is the one named (2) above, where<br>the note C is in tune to the open E string.<br><br>C. ---------<br><br>When proceeding from the first movement, ending in D major,<br>into the second movement, in G major, Beethoven took the necessary<br>steps to manipulated the intonation of his notes so that the<br>second movement will be played in adherence to the above table,<br>and when going back from G major to D major from the second to<br>the third movement.<br><br>Beethoven violin concerto 2nd mvt chord and melody analysis,<br>Bar 89 to 91.<br>     __________     ___________     _________                ______<br> G / Dim5 36/25 C#/chr.st 25/24 D / xn3 32/27 F \ ______ G#/ chr.st  A<br> |              |               |             |  mj6 5/3 |    25/24  |<br>B.otv 81/80    dim5 36/25     B.mj6 27/16   mn3 6/5  dim5 36/25   B.mn6 <br>81/50<br> |   __________ |               |             |          |           |<br> G /B.otv 81/80 G \ ___________ F \ _________ D --------- \ _______  C#<br> |              |   big wt 9/8  |   mn3  6/5  |       semitone 27/25 |<br>unison         mn3 6/5         mn3 6/5       otv 2/1                mj6 5/3<br> |   __________ |               |             |    ________________  |<br> G /B.mj6 27/16 E \ ___________ D \ _________ D  /          wt 10/9  E<br> |              |     B.wt 9/8  |   otv  2/1  |                      |<br>mj6 5/3        P5 3/2          mj3 5/4       mj3 5/4                P5 3/2<br> |              |   ___________ |             |                      |<br> Bb \__________ A / mn2  16/15  Bb ---------- Bb \ _________________ A<br>     mn2  16/15                    remain             semitone 27/25<br><br>The chords put in their "up-right" positions reveal the intervals<br>required:<br>         1.         2.                 3.            4.                5.<br><br>         G          G                  D            (G#)               A<br>   B.mj6<       mn3<           big mn3<          mn3<             Big4<<br>         Bb         E                  F             F                 E<br>     mn3<       mn3<               mn3<          mn3<              mn3<<br>         G          C#                 D             D                 C#<br>  unison<       mj3<               mj3<          mj3<              mj3<<br>         G          A                  Bb           Bb                 A<br><br>Note:<br><br>1.

As the subdominant key of G major, the notes D and A in the<br>   scale are in tune on these open strings.<br><br>3. As the subdominant of the subdominant key of D major, the note<br>   G is in tune on the open G string.<br><br>The following analysis shows how Beethoven manipulated such<br>modulation:<br><br>At bar 239 of the first movement of the Violin Concerto, the<br>music is A major. At bar 247, it modulates to its simple A minor.<br>At bar 258, the note E in the chord C major is held by five<br>instruments. As previously explained, this top note being the<br>third of the (tonic) major chord, must be a comma higher.<br>However, this note is sustained from previously, and is not<br>possible to the open E string. The low E is in tune to the open G<br>string.<br><br>At bar 260, these two notes remain unchanged. The low E is then<br>sustained in the second violin until bar 264. Here, the chord<br>becomes a C major seventh. All notes must be in tune. The note C<br>in the bass is in tune with the sustained low E in the second<br>violin, and is also in tune to the open G string. This C is<br>sustained in the bass until bar 268. The chord becomes tonic C<br>major. The top note C must be higher than the C in the bass by a<br>comma. Hence the tonic C major is the one named (2) above, where<br>the note C is in tune to the open E string.<br><br>C. ---------<br><br>When proceeding from the first movement, ending in D major,<br>into the second movement, in G major, Beethoven took the necessary<br>steps to manipulated the intonation of his notes so that the<br>second movement will be played in adherence to the above table,<br>and when going back from G major to D major from the second to<br>the third movement.<br><br>Beethoven violin concerto 2nd mvt chord and melody analysis,<br>Bar 89 to 91.<br>     __________     ___________     _________                ______<br> G / Dim5 36/25 C#/chr.st 25/24 D / xn3 32/27 F \ ______ G#/ chr.st  A<br> |              |               |             |  mj6 5/3 |    25/24  |<br>B.otv 81/80    dim5 36/25     B.mj6 27/16   mn3 6/5  dim5 36/25   B.mn6 <br>81/50<br> |   __________ |               |             |          |           |<br> G /B.otv 81/80 G \ ___________ F \ _________ D --------- \ _______  C#<br> |              |   big wt 9/8  |   mn3  6/5  |       semitone 27/25 |<br>unison         mn3 6/5         mn3 6/5       otv 2/1                mj6 5/3<br> |   __________ |               |             |    ________________  |<br> G /B.mj6 27/16 E \ ___________ D \ _________ D  /          wt 10/9  E<br> |              |     B.wt 9/8  |   otv  2/1  |                      |<br>mj6 5/3        P5 3/2          mj3 5/4       mj3 5/4                P5 3/2<br> |              |   ___________ |             |                      |<br> Bb \__________ A / mn2  16/15  Bb ---------- Bb \ _________________ A<br>     mn2  16/15                    remain             semitone 27/25<br><br>The chords put in their "up-right" positions reveal the intervals<br>required:<br>         1.         2.                 3.            4.                5.<br><br>         G          G                  D            (G#)               A<br>   B.mj6<       mn3<           big mn3<          mn3<             Big4<<br>         Bb         E                  F             F                 E<br>     mn3<       mn3<               mn3<          mn3<              mn3<<br>         G          C#                 D             D                 C#<br>  unison<       mj3<               mj3<          mj3<              mj3<<br>         G          A                  Bb           Bb                 A<br><br>Note:<br><br>1.
