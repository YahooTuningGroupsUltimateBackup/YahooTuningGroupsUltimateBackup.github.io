No way! The main reason we are able to generate<br>complex musical designs is aural memory. Because 12-tet has been pounded<br>into our brains since we were knee high to a grasshopper, we have an exact<br>aural memory of every sound this temperamnent can produce. We can organize<br>complex musical components in our heads because we already know what they<br>sound like and what they metaphorically convey to our audience. If we want<br>to compose pieces that demonstrate particular moods, there are very<br>well-defined aspects of 12-tet that we will emphasize over others to<br>produce the desired effects and we don't need to hear it to confirm our<br>intentions. This reaches to the heart of the frustrations associated with<br>Xenharmonic composition. Without an aural memory of the sounds, and thus<br>aesthetic implications inherent to a particular temperament, we are forced<br>to simply plunk down the notes and take what we get. It seems the tail is<br>wagging the dog here. As a composer, I delight in my ability to manipulate<br>sounds to effect a carefully controlled mood, but this is only accomplished<br>through the metaphorical power of established aesthetic parameters. What<br>metaphors to psychological attributes are (or can be) established by<br>tunings other than 12-tet?
