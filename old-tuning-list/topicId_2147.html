H. Lucy <br>copyright 1990 & 1994<br>This is an extract from "Pitch, Pi, and Other <br>Musical Paradoxes,<br>(A Practical Guide To Natural Microtonality)" - <br>ISBN 0-9512879-0-7<br> <br>You may think of scalemaking as some sort of esoteric <br>musical alchemy. This is near the truth, for as with alchemy<br>the intent may be to transmute something of little value into gold. <br>This may be in the form of a valuable piece of music. The process, <br>like chemistry, may be approached from two opposite directions: <br>starting from an existing scale and by analysis breaking it down <br>to its constituent parts to discover how it works, or by synthesis <br>constructing a scale using some form of recipe.<br> <br>First a few definitions:<br> <br>A scale is a series of notes which are used in a piece of music. <br>These may be identified by their musical names using the letters <br>A through G. Each of these letters may also be followed by any <br>number of sharp or flat symbols. For example the notes <br>D-E-F-G-A-B-C-D make a scale of D minor<br>Any scale may be transposed by changing the starting note which <br>will change the other note names and the key signature. If we <br>flatten all the notes of the scale of D minor by one Large <br>interval from D to C, we create a scale of C minor <br>C-D-Eb-F-G-A-Bb-C and the key signature now has two flats <br>(Bb and Eb). Our two examples here have shown us two scales, <br>D minor and C minor, which both use the same mode. This mode of <br>L-s-L-L-L-s-L is known as the minor, Dorian or Kafi mode. <br>The name is dependent upon whether you are using the English, <br>Greek or Indian names for the mode. <br> <br>A Mode is a sequence of intervals, which may be defined by <br>Large and small intervals. The sequence for the two minor<br> scales used in the examples above are both L-s-L-L-L-s-L, <br>which we described as the minor mode. This sequence of <br>intervals added together gives a total of five Large and <br>two small intervals, which gives us one octave. We can <br>therefore consider this pattern as circular. That is it <br>ends on the octave note above where it started. Using this <br>same circular sequence we could start it at any point and <br>each of the seven starting points gives us another mode. <br>In this case we can make all the Greek modes using this sequence, <br>which are the basis of Western music and harmony. These seven <br>different notes are contiguous on the spiral of fourths and fifths, <br>and arranged in pitch ascending order, give us a megamode. <br>This is the circular pattern from which the seven Greek modes <br>are derived. <br> <br>A Megamode is a circular sequence of intervals from which modes <br>are derived. The megamode of seven contiguous positions on the <br>spiral of fourths and fifths produce all the Greek modes. We <br>could describe this as an expanse of six steps which contains <br>seven notes. There is a comparable megamode of four steps which <br>produces five contiguous notes and generates five pentatonic scales.<br> <br> <br>1. List all the different notes which are used in the piece <br>regardless of octave.<br> <br>2. Arrange the note names in order of fourths (flats) in one <br>direction and fifths (sharps) in the other, leaving blank spaces <br>where notes are missing.<br>[Sequence ascending in fifths is: <br>Bbb Fb Cb Gb Db Ab Eb Bb F C G D A E B F# C# G# D# A# E# B# F## C## etc.]<br> <br>The fifth may be considered as the dominant, and the fourth as the <br>sub-dominant.<br> <br>3. Count the total number of steps between the fourthmost (flat) and<br>fifthmost (sharp) note. This is the extent of the string, or chain of<br>fourths/fifths (x).<br> <br>4. List the missing notes. Identify them by numbering the flatmost <br>as 1 and the following as ascending numbers moving through fifths.<br>Each of the missing notes may be defined as between 2 and x.<br> <br>5. The megamode may now be defined by the number of steps and <br>the position of the missing notes (m1, m2, etc.).<br> Eg. x  m1 m2 m3 and m4.<br> Therefore there are four notes missing in the sequence. <br>Therefore the extent is (x). So there are thirteen notes <br>of which four (m1 to m4) are missing leaving 13-4 9 notes. <br>In this case numbers 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12.<br> <br>6. The mode is determined by which of the notes is chosen as the <br>start of a sequence of ascending frequencies. This starting note<br> may be identified by stating its position on the chain of fifths. <br>For example, if the notes were six consecutive steps<br> Eg. F C G D A E B. These pitches could be arranged in seven<br> modes of different ascending pitch orders:<br> <br>(F) 1 (first note in chain) (Lydian) I,II,III,#IV,V,VI, and VII; <br>(C) 2 (2nd in chain) (Major or Ionian) I,II,III,IV,V,VI,and VII; <br>(G) 3 (Mixolydian) I,II,III,IV,V,VI,and bVII; <br>(D) 4 (Dorian) I,II,bIII,IV,V,VI,and bVII; <br>(A) 5 (Aeolian) I,II,bIII,IV,V,bVI,and bVII; <br>(E) 6 (Phrygian) I,bII,bIII,IV,V,bVI,and bVII; <br>(B) 7 (Locrian) I,bII,bIII,IV,bV,bVI, and bVII.<br> <br>7. The key of the scale and scale is determined by the tonal <br>center, which may defined as C,D,E,F,G,A, or B with the <br>appropriate sharps or flats. The scale may then be listed <br>in ascending frequency order by note name.  <br> <br>8. A scale or mode may therefore be defined as: <br> Number of steps in chain (x)/position(s) of missing notes  <br>(counted from fourths towards fifths)/Position of tonic <br>(counted from fourths towards fifths). <br>Eg. The scale and mode described as 5/25/3 could give the <br>notes F-G-D-E from the chain F-C-G-D-A-E. <br>Using the third note of the chain (G) as the starting note <br>giving a scale of G-D-E-F or the mode of I-V-VI-bVII.<br>  <br> <br> <br>Charles Lucy<br>lucy@hour.com<br>http://www.wonderlandinorbit.com/projects/lullaby<br>http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy<br>http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/lullaby<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 17 Jun 1997 09:24 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00605; Tue, 17 Jun 1997 09:24:32 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 17 Jun 1997 09:24:32 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00603<br>Received: (qmail 21366 invoked from network); 16 Jun 1997 08:41:11 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 16 Jun 1997 08:41:11 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199706160750.PAA00692@csnt1.cs.ust.hk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>ScaleCoding confusion (fwd)</h1><h3><a id=5649 href="#5649">ðŸ”—</a>Charles Lucy &#x3C;lucy@ilhawaii.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/1997 12:07:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>---------- Forwarded message ----------<br>Date: Wed, 21 May 1997 23:31:14 -1000 (HST)<br>From: Charles Lucy <lucy@lehua.ilhawaii.net><br>To: Bill Alves <alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu><br>Subject: ScaleCoding confusion<br><br>Bill;<br> <br>I appreciated your interesting and thoughtful posting about your <br>coding of modes and scales, yet I see the possibility of confusion <br>arising between our two different systems.<br> <br>In about 1989, John Gibbon, Jonathan Glasier, and I, worked together<br>to design a scalecoding system, and publicized it fairly widely <br>amongst musicians and music academics.
