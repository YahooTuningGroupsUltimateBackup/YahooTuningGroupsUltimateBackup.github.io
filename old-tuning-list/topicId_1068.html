If <br>someone wishes to devote his or her life to an alternate tuning system, and <br>that person is extremely talented, we may have a small step towards breaking <br>out of the 12-tet monopoly. The steps taken by those who have devoted <br>themselves to various incarnations of just intonation, or have worked <br>extensively with 19- or 31-tone equal temperament, have been, no disrespect <br>intended, tiny.

There are various systems of tuning in use, <br>mainly because melodies tend to gravitate around a set of fixed pitches, and <br>also to provide either a specification that all harmonies be just, or a <br>framework in which many usable harmonies are constructed from a small set of <br>melodically important tones. An additional feature of many systems is to <br>allow transposition. The problem, of course, is that these systems are <br>varied and theoretically incommensurable.<br><br>I must say that the tape of "Cosmic Rays" that Johnny sent me demonstrates <br>that his performers have an ability to reproduce the same dissonant <br>intervals at different pitch levels with amazing accuracy. Considering that <br>world-class string players such as Isaac Stern are often 50 cents out of <br>tune, I'm duly impressed. However, I am very skeptical that these <br>"quadratic-prime just" intervals are often played within 5-10 cents of their <br>written value, unless some trick of relating the beat frequency to the tempo <br>is used. My apologies if I am underestimating an obviously super-talented <br>ensemble, but for the rest of us, I doubt if jumping right into cents is the <br>best idea. 72-tet might be better as a first step, as it approximates <br>11-limit JI consistently in addition to containing standard 12-tet. On the <br>other hand, if one adopted 72-tet, distinctions of 1/4-septimal comma (such <br>as in my music) would require a bisection of the 72-tet steps. The result is <br>144-tet, which, as it happens, is still a consistent representation of <br>11-limit JI (the approximations are the same as in 72-tet). Alterations of <br>1/4-syntonic comma would require an additional bisection (the minimum to <br>perform Renaissance meantone, a wonderful tuning for all triadic diatonic <br>music), although there are those who like Renaissance music just fine in JI <br>or even 12-tet. But for the purists (like me), the final result is 288-tet, <br>or steps of just over 4 cents, which is the usual jnd or "just-noticeable <br>difference." It's too bad we're stuck with the lousy decimal system, as it's <br>mentally and physically easier to approximate bisections and a trisection <br>than the quintisections required by decimals.<br><br>If I had to train string players to play microtones, I'd have them learn <br>thirds of semitones (sixth-tones) first, using 7/4 and 7/3 as "landmarks," <br>and then I'd have them learn quartertones, using 11/8 and 11/6 and Arabic <br>scales as guides, and then show then how to fill in the missing <br>twelfth-tones by playing 5/4, 5/3, and 7/5 "just". Once they had <br>internalized the 72-tet system, I'd have them play along with electronically <br>recorded examples to fine-tune their abilities, and then to motivate further <br>divisions into halves and quarters with septimal and meantone musical <br>examples. The accuracy of the latter divisions would be questionable and <br>lots of electronic recordings would help, but in theory, at least, the <br>players would be familiar with 288-tet. To ask for finer gradations than <br>this seems utterly infeasible, as the distinctions can no longer be heard by <br>ear. Having been arrived at by an ear-training of successive bisections and <br>trisections, with reference to musical examples at each step, one would <br>expect far more accuracy from this system than by simply asking for cents <br>deviations (play a 37-cents-sharp b-flat!)<br><br>On fixed-pitch instruments, it may be that none of this is important, as <br>some sort of tablature can always be used. On the other hand, using one's <br>ear is important even on fixed-pitch instruments, so there may be some value <br>in trying to standardize a 72-tet notation with additional alterations for <br>half-way and quarter-way notes.<br><br>Besides Ezra Sims, Franz Richter Herf has published a 72-tet notation, but I <br>doubt the two are materially different.<br><br>Anyhow, seeing that Paul Rapoport is back with us, I'd like to continue my <br>discussion with him. Although for practical performing purposes there is no <br>question that Johnny is right that a single, all-encompassing, and <br>backwards- (or should I say sideways-) compatible system is desirable for <br>performance purposes, for theoretical and historical purposes other systems <br>may be more convenient. Although there is no doubt that to get a modern <br>player to play meantone, you need a different alteration for every scale <br>degree, meantone was once the default. In Paul Rapoport's scheme, as long as <br>a meantone tuning (such as 19-tet or 31-tet) is specified, no alterations <br>are needed to render a diatonic passage. But as the number of <br>pre-specifiable tunings approaches 171, the practical usefulness of his <br>notation for, say, string players, approaches mud.<br><br>Which brings me to the problems with Rapoport's notation viewed purely as a <br>theoretical tool. Here's something I wrote up on August 16:<br><br>Paul R.:<br>You are correct that your view of "best" commas in equal temperaments is <br>based on using 1:3 and 1:5 as the basic building blocks of a system (we are <br>ignoring octaves here). You are in good company here, but this is why I <br>object to this view (I'm playing devil's advocate against myself at every <br>question):<br><br>Q. Why do we treat 1:5 and 1:3 as basic and fundamental?<br><br>A. Because they are consonant.<br><br>Q. Are any other intervals consonant?<br><br>A. Yes, 3:5 is consonant.<br><br>Q. Is 3:5 just a by-product of building 1:5 and 1:3 from the same note?<br><br>A. No. It is inherently consonant, and needs to be tuned accurately.<br><br>Q. How do you know?<br><br>A. Listen.<br><br>Q. I'm not convinced. In a triad, don't the 1:5 and the 1:3 determine <br>consonance?<br><br>A. No. Compare triads in 15-tet and 20-tet, built from the best 1:3 and the <br>best 1:5. They have the same 1:3, and the 1:5 is better in 20-tet. However, <br>the 15-tet triad is clearly more consonant.<br><br>Q. I hear it, but how can that be?<br><br>A. The 3:5 is tuned much worse in 20-tet. In fact, there is a closer <br>approximation to 3:5 in 20-tet than the difference between the best 1:5 and <br>the best 1:3.<br><br>Q. Well, why not use that 3:5 in the triad?<br><br>A. Because then one of the other two intervals, which you defined as basic, <br>would have to change.<br><br>Q. But isn't it true that in any tuning, the 1:3 and the 1:5 determine the <br>best triad?<br><br>A. No. Besides 20-tet, try 11-tet and 14-tet. In all three tunings, you'll <br>find better triads.<br><br>Q. But those aren't even recognizable!<br><br>A. Ok, try 64-tet. There the best perfect fifth is 37 steps, and the best <br>major third is 21 steps. Changing either of these by 1 to give a better <br>minor third of 17 steps improves the entire triad.<br><br>Q. Well, who said there could be only one good triad in a system? I mean, <br>with a large number of notes, of course you're going to have a lot of good <br>triads! Can't they all be musically useful?<br><br>A. Yes, but when the "best" is really only third best, your system does not <br>come close to exhibiting the potential of each tuning.<br><br>Q. Isn't potential of the tuning something for the composer to discover?<br><br>A. The tonal resources of 64-tet are difficult enough to fathom. A notation <br>system which obscures the basic consonance-dissonance relations of the <br>tuning is not serving the interests of tonality.<br><br>Anyway, now it's October, and all I can add is that Rapoport's scheme might <br>be saved by having a more complex derivation of the "best" intervals, one <br>which would be based on finding the best triad rather than the best fifth <br>and major third. Here a criterion like mean-squared error might be useful, <br>but the fifth can tolerate a bit more mistuning than the thirds . . .<br><br> -Paul E.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 29 Oct 1996 00:17 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04613; Sat, 26 Oct 1996 15:14:50 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05672<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id GAA00010; Sat, 26 Oct 1996 06:14:47 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 26 Oct 1996 06:14:47 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199610261510.PAA26923@teaser.teaser.fr><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Universal notation</h1><h3><a id=3861 href="#3861">ðŸ”—</a>PAULE &#x3C;ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/1996 2:21:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Johnny Reinhard wrote,<br><br>>Re: systems, I don't believe there is any virtue in sticking to a<br>>particular system of tuning, per se.
