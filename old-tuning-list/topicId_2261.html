First, I do not have the time or<br>inclination to simply make posts to piss folks off...if I say it, I<br>definitely feel it. I do not make "veiled references"...I see no point in<br>mentioning the names of folks whose music I don't care for, because it is<br>NOT a personal issue with me. A person's character is not dependent on<br>their musical abilities...and yes, Beardsley, I DO have lofty standards,<br>and I don't see that as a bad thing. I expect a lot out of folks, and<br>that means me first. I have worked hard for many years to play my axe,<br>and I continue to do so. Thus, if I hear someone doodling instead of<br>playing, I am gonna call it straight. And, unfortunately, there IS a lot<br>of noodling and doodling in the microtonal field...(truth be told,<br>there's a lot of crappy 12eq music too, so it ain't just the<br>microdoodlists who suck); so, I say practice, and get better...nothing<br>wrong with that, either. Constructive criticism is OK by me, and I<br>constantly solicit it for myself, as well...I still take guitar lessons<br>when I need to. Life is full of non musical lessons, as well, and there<br>seems to be no end to these.<br>Also, I love theory...I have many theories about many things too,<br>including tunings. I think Erv Wilson is a great genius, and I don't care<br>if he plays or not...same with the late Larry Hanson. Yes, I would like<br>to see more theories of tunings translated into great music; again,<br>what's wrong with that? Perhaps my method of delivery occasionally rubs<br>some folks the wrong way...OK, no problem, I do talk blunt. But, again, I<br>do NOT attack out of spite, or ego. It's all for the art of music, and I<br>do my best to keep the personal junk out of it. It is risky second<br>guessing someone's intentions from a computer screen, however; Sorry, Mr.<br>B, but you were wrong about everything you guessed about me. Often, when<br>a person assigns incorrect motives to another, they are seeing that<br>person through their own personal traits and perhaps that is what<br>Beardsley did here...it's pretty common...Hstick<br><br><br><br>$AdditionalHeaders:  Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id C12564DB.00280396; Mon, 21 Jul 1997 09:17:03 +0200</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1> trolls on the forum</h1><h3><a id=5887 href="#5887">ðŸ”—</a> stick@dnvr.uswest.net</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Haverstick here...there's been a few comments about my recent posts, so I<br>thought I could explain myself.
