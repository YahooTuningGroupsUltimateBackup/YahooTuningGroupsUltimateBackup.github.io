In this case, the best <br>tuning would be 1/1 10/9 6/5 4/3 3/2 5/3 16/9 2/1, with chords 2/1 5/3 4/3, <br>4/3 10/9 8/9 (16/9 in the lower octave) and 3/2 6/5 1/1.<br><br>If the melodic pattern, T S T T T S T, is more important, then as Lydia <br>stated, one may take it as a mode of the JI C major scale (which is <br>the C mode of the E mode (Greek Dorian) of Ptolemy's Intense Diatonic genus<br>16/15 x 9/8 x 10/9). The scale is thus 1/1 10/9 32/27 4/3 40/27 5/3 16/9 <br>2/1, whose tuning may be adjusted to 1/1 9/8 6/5 4/3 3/2 5/3 16/9 2/1. <br><br>However, the scale may also be taken as a mode of the un-Greek natural <br>minor scale, generated by the tetrachord 10/9 x 9/8 x 16/15. In this case <br>the tuning is 1/1 9/8 6/5 27/20 3/2 27/16 9/5 2/1, the inversion of the<br>preceeding, and may be retuned as before to 1/1 9/8 6/5 4/3 3/2<br>5/3 9/5 2/1.<br><br>If the Didymos's diatonic 16/15 x 10/9 x 9/8 is employed, the scale<br>as a mode of the Greek Dorian is 1/1 9/8 6/5 4/3 3/2 27/16 9/5 2/1.<br>(There is less motivation to invert it as it is less harmonic than<br>Ptolemy's form.) One could even use the other Greek and Islamic<br>diatonic genera.<br><br>Or one could follow Safiyu-d-Din and the other Islamic theorists and <br>generate the scale from two identical tetrachords of the form T S T'<br>(or T' S T) where T and T' are any whole tone-like intervals and S whatever<br>completes the tetrachord. These Islamic theorists allowed all <br>permutations of the tetrachord to form scales. Thus from Ptolemy's and<br>Didymos's tunings we can get Phrygian-like scales with duplicated <br>tetrachords such as 1/1 10/9 32/27 4/3 3/2 5/3 16/9 2/1 and 1/1 9/8 6/5 <br>4/3 3/2 27/16 9/5 2/1.<br><br>The "Pythagorean" tuning 1/1 9/8 32/27 4/3 3/2 27/16 16/9 2/1 has the<br>advantage of being a "classical" mode generated by the 256/243 x 9/8 <br>x 9/8 tetrachord.

Could someone explain this to me so that I can set<br>>about (dis)proving it?<br><br>I know this whole business can be very confusing, but let me try to<br>explain this step by step.<br><br>First of all, as the title of this message indicated, I am talking about<br>odd-limit theory, as in Partch's original definition. The limit is<br>defined as the highest number needed in the representation of the<br>interval or chord after all factors of two are discarded (octave<br>equivalence is the justification for discarding them). This also agrees<br>with Ralph D. Hill's observation that every new odd number adds a new<br>quality, as well as a higher degree of tension, to a chord. I used to<br>believe (though I'm not sure in light of my recent obsevation here) that<br>a given style of music established a certain odd limit as the norm;<br>higher-limit chords will sound dissonant and need to resolve, while<br>lower-limit chords will sound incomplete. This is certainly applicable<br>to Common Practice and the 5-limit; 3-limit pentatonic examples are<br>easily constructed, and I believe I've taken a first step toward<br>realizing the 7-limit case (see my upcoming Xenharmonikon paper).<br><br>Now let us state what we mean by "representation." For an interval, this<br>is just a lowest terms ratio p/q; we can define this to be the frequency<br>ratio, in which case the period (or wavelength, string length, . . . )<br>ratio in lowest terms is just q/p. Either reprentation implies the same<br>odd limit for the interval.<br><br>Following Partch, we will define integer multiples from 1 to n of a<br>frequency to be an "n-otonality," and integer multiples from 1 to n of a<br>period (or wavelength, string length, . . .) to be an "n-utonality." So<br>we can define the otonality-limit as the lowest n for which a chord<br>(with all factors of 2 removed) is a subset of an n-otonality, and<br>similarly for the utonality-limit.<br><br>For a chord of 2 notes, the limit of the 1 interval in the chord is the<br>same as the utonality-limit and the otonality-limit of the chord. For<br>more than two notes, the otonal or utonal representations may differ in<br>complexity, in which case the simpler one is often chosen and the chord<br>is deemed as appropriate. For example, 10:12:15 is a "5-limit utonality"<br>and 4:5:6:7 is a "7-limit otonality." As Paul Hahn has pointed out, the<br>3-limit, 5-limit, and 7-limit are particularly easy cases to deal with,<br>since if all intervals of a chord belong to one of these limits, the<br>chord itself will belong to that limit either as an otonality or as a<br>utonality.<br><br>However, the 6th chord 12:15:18:20 has an otonality-limit of 15, a<br>utonality-limit of 15, but no interval is beyond the 9-limit. Kami<br>Rousseau's 6th chord 14:18:21:24 has an otonality-limit of 21, a<br>utonality-limit of 21, but again no interval is beyond the 9-limit. Paul<br>Hahn's example 18:22:24:33 has an otonality-limit of 33, a<br>utonality-limit of 33, but no interval is beyond the 11-limit.<br><br>It appears then that there is a new class of "saturated" chord beyond<br>the otonal and utonal chords that Partch envisioned. By saturated I mean<br>that no new notes can be added without increasing the odd-interval-limit<br>of the chord. I think this finding merits investigation as a natural<br>extension of Partch's work.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 23 Jun 1997 23:01 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05735; Mon, 23 Jun 1997 23:01:23 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 23 Jun 1997 23:01:23 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05728<br>Received: (qmail 26044 invoked from network); 23 Jun 1997 20:59:26 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 23 Jun 1997 20:59:26 -0000<br>Message-Id: <009B63B0DDB21546.5CEC@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5705 href="#5705">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>6/28/1997 11:18:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: "Paul H.

Could someone explain this to me so that I can set<br>>about (dis)proving it?<br><br>I know this whole business can be very confusing, but let me try to<br>explain this step by step.<br><br>First of all, as the title of this message indicated, I am talking about<br>odd-limit theory, as in Partch's original definition. The limit is<br>defined as the highest number needed in the representation of the<br>interval or chord after all factors of two are discarded (octave<br>equivalence is the justification for discarding them). This also agrees<br>with Ralph D. Hill's observation that every new odd number adds a new<br>quality, as well as a higher degree of tension, to a chord. I used to<br>believe (though I'm not sure in light of my recent obsevation here) that<br>a given style of music established a certain odd limit as the norm;<br>higher-limit chords will sound dissonant and need to resolve, while<br>lower-limit chords will sound incomplete. This is certainly applicable<br>to Common Practice and the 5-limit; 3-limit pentatonic examples are<br>easily constructed, and I believe I've taken a first step toward<br>realizing the 7-limit case (see my upcoming Xenharmonikon paper).<br><br>Now let us state what we mean by "representation." For an interval, this<br>is just a lowest terms ratio p/q; we can define this to be the frequency<br>ratio, in which case the period (or wavelength, string length, . . . )<br>ratio in lowest terms is just q/p. Either reprentation implies the same<br>odd limit for the interval.<br><br>Following Partch, we will define integer multiples from 1 to n of a<br>frequency to be an "n-otonality," and integer multiples from 1 to n of a<br>period (or wavelength, string length, . . .) to be an "n-utonality." So<br>we can define the otonality-limit as the lowest n for which a chord<br>(with all factors of 2 removed) is a subset of an n-otonality, and<br>similarly for the utonality-limit.<br><br>For a chord of 2 notes, the limit of the 1 interval in the chord is the<br>same as the utonality-limit and the otonality-limit of the chord. For<br>more than two notes, the otonal or utonal representations may differ in<br>complexity, in which case the simpler one is often chosen and the chord<br>is deemed as appropriate. For example, 10:12:15 is a "5-limit utonality"<br>and 4:5:6:7 is a "7-limit otonality." As Paul Hahn has pointed out, the<br>3-limit, 5-limit, and 7-limit are particularly easy cases to deal with,<br>since if all intervals of a chord belong to one of these limits, the<br>chord itself will belong to that limit either as an otonality or as a<br>utonality.<br><br>However, the 6th chord 12:15:18:20 has an otonality-limit of 15, a<br>utonality-limit of 15, but no interval is beyond the 9-limit. Kami<br>Rousseau's 6th chord 14:18:21:24 has an otonality-limit of 21, a<br>utonality-limit of 21, but again no interval is beyond the 9-limit. Paul<br>Hahn's example 18:22:24:33 has an otonality-limit of 33, a<br>utonality-limit of 33, but no interval is beyond the 11-limit.<br><br>It appears then that there is a new class of "saturated" chord beyond<br>the otonal and utonal chords that Partch envisioned. By saturated I mean<br>that no new notes can be added without increasing the odd-interval-limit<br>of the chord. I think this finding merits investigation as a natural<br>extension of Partch's work.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 23 Jun 1997 23:01 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05735; Mon, 23 Jun 1997 23:01:23 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 23 Jun 1997 23:01:23 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05728<br>Received: (qmail 26044 invoked from network); 23 Jun 1997 20:59:26 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 23 Jun 1997 20:59:26 -0000<br>Message-Id: <009B63B0DDB21546.5CEC@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5705 href="#5705">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>6/28/1997 11:18:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: "Paul H.
