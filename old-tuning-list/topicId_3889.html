Odin learns nine magic songs from a<br>	giant that enable him to win the mead of poetry for the gods;<br>	Heimdall has nine mothers; Hermod, Odin's son, journeys for nine<br>	nights in his attempt to win back the god Balder from Hel; the<br>	great religious ceremonies at the temple of Uppsala lasted for<br>	nine days in every ninth year, and required the sacrifice of<br>	nine human beings and nine animals of every kind.  Why nine was<br>	the most significant number in Norse mythology has not been<br>	satisfactorily explained, but belief in the magical properties<br>	of the number is not restricted to Scandinavia.  In _The Golden<br>	Bough_, J.G. Frazer records ceremonies involving the number nine<br>	in countries as widely separated as Wales, Lithuania, Siam and<br>	the island of Nias in the Mentawai chain.  Nine is, of course,<br>	the end of the series of single numbers, and this may be the<br>	reason why it symbolises death and rebirth in a number of<br>	mythologies; hence it also stands for the whole.<br><br>No luck yet on 31 though. 8-)><br><br>--pH <manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu> http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote<br>    O<br>   /\        "Churchill?
