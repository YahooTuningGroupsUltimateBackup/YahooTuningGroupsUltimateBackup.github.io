Mr. Erlich's "pitch set", as used above, is something very<br>different.  If I am not mistaken, he uses the term "pitch set" above to<br>touch on a model that describes a certain aspect of music:  Where harmony<br>and melody interact in a Special Way.<br><br>What is this Special Way?  Krumhansl, quoted by Mr. Erlich, seems to be<br>touching on it: "If chord construction is determined in some principled way<br>by scale structure, then this further serves to maintain the tonal<br>framework for encoding pitch information."<br><br>Most western classical music happens to work in this Special Way, and the<br>thing it uses to do it is the diatonic scale.  Mr. Erlich's goal, if I'm<br>not mistaken, is to find a new scale suitable for use in this Special Way.<br><br>To recap so far, I am using "Special Way" to mean a way of explaining<br>beauty in music from how melody and harmony are related, a construct<br>heretobefore unknown to music theory, at least at the level Mr. Erlich<br>takes it.  In his paper, it is called "Generalizing diatonicity".  I<br>suggest this is an unfortunate term, as it implies the diatonic scale,<br>which is exactly what he wants to replace, kind of how "octave" isn't a<br>good way to say "2/1", since it implies 12-tone...<br><br>>I think Schonberg may have been right that diatonicism had been played<br>>out, but in abandoning the concepts of tonality and scale he threw the<br>>baby out with the bathwater.<br><br>..Here, Mr. Erlich uses the words "tonality and scale" to mean Special<br>Way.  His post then translates: "I think Schonberg may have been right that<br>the diatonic scale has been exhausted as a tool for making music in the<br>Special Way, but he threw out the Special Way, which wasn't what was used up."<br><br>Now follows a review of his paper, which hopes, it seems, to show just how<br>the Special Way isn't used up, and just how you can tune an instrument<br>that'll make the Special Way seem as new as 1998.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The author starts by observing that the Western Music is 5-limit, and,<br>following the "music evolves up the harmonic series" thing, sets his sights<br>on the 7-limit.<br><br>He then defines a set of scales as candidates for representing the 7-limit.<br> These scales are assumed to be root of 2 equal-step tunings, with only one<br>pitch per 7-limit approximation.<br><br>The one pitch per approximation thing is necessary for the Special Way to<br>work, as far as I can tell.  I can't quite tell you how, but I have a gut<br>feeling it is, and since the Special Way is what we're after, I won't argue<br>it.  Besides, it keeps the size of the pitch set manageable.<br><br>The root of 2 part is understandable, considering that we need strong low<br>identies for our 7's to work.  This seems contradictory to the rule that<br>the higher identities are more sensitive to mistuning, since there are more<br>low-numbered fractions near them.  Indeed it is, and perhaps it is a<br>counterbalance to this principle.  The paper offers only that "octave<br>equivalence seems pervasive" and that it is "universally perceived, even by<br>some animals".<br><br>The matter of mistuning is far from clear, even touching back on our old<br>bone about unknowingly passing low-numbered ratios when measuring cent<br>detuning of an interval.  Paul's paper addresses this by making the<br>standard deviation in log-frequency detuning inversely proportional to the<br>limit of the interval.  Not ideal, but better than any other method I've<br>been able to think of, and good enough for root of 2 equal tunings from 12<br>to 31.<br><br>The equal-step part is the most dubious.  The Special Way has always been<br>based on temperament of some kind, and it seems that only Bog or God can<br>decide if all those schkissmas need to disappear for it to work, insomuch<br>as Mr. Erlich has never shown it.  He has mentioned, on this digest, some<br>modulatory effects that require two D's to be the same note, etc, but this<br>is a problem of trying to retune music already written.  That Special Way<br>music cannot be written for JI, complete with its own list of modulatory<br>effects impossible in a temperament, has not been demonstrated.<br><br>So the list of scales comes down to 22, 26, 27, and 31 tone equal temperament.<br><br>Then are listed criteria for determining a scale's usefulness for the<br>Special Way.  Since the Special Way is a relationship between a scale's<br>melodic and harmonic usefulness, the criteria are separated in these two<br>groups...<br><br>1. Melodic.  In Paul's paper we have maximal evenness and tetrachordality.<br>In Gibson-land, we have the melodic limen.  Jules Siegel proposed that the<br>intervals should get smaller as you go up the scale.  None of these<br>convince me in the least even that a scale can "work" melodically.  Maybe<br>the most useful thing I've heard for describing the melodic properties of a<br>scale is "symmetry".  I will accept, however, that the criteria used by Mr.<br>Erlich are, "enough to ensure an intelligible melodic framework".<br><br>2. Harmonic.  Now we're talking.  This is where the real relations between<br>melodic and harmonic are drawn...<br>   (a)"There exists a pattern of intervals" ... "which produces a complete,<br>consonant chord on most scale degrees"<br>   (b)"The majority of consonant chords have a root that lies" the best<br>approximation of a 3/2 "away from another consonant chord"<br>   (c)"A chord progression of no more than three consonant chords is<br>required to cover the entire scale"<br><br>..in what would be letter "d", Mr. Erlich makes use of a term I do not<br>understand: "characteristic dissonance".  He defines it to be any dissonant<br>interval that shares the same number of scale steps as a consonant<br>interval.  Shadings of dissonance aside, what kind of scale steps we<br>talkin'?  The example of the diminished 5th is given, but why it should be<br>considered a type of 5th, or why the P5 should not be considered a 7th is<br>not made clear.<br><br>   (e)The rarest intervals in the scale should be located next to notes in<br>the tonic chord.  Like leading tones.<br><br>What would be "f" makes use again of the term "characteristic dissonance".<br><br>The number of scales fitting these criteria is shown to be few.  Among them<br>are the 5-limit diatonic and the 3-limit pentatonic, two scales proven over<br>hundreds of years to be great for the Special Way.  While this shouldn't<br>come as much of a surprise, considering the author admits to basing his<br>criteria on the success of these scales, any time such a unique set of<br>properties can be found, they're probably worth looking into.<br><br>Finally, it is shown that the decatonic scale in 22TET fits the criteria well.<br><br>So has the paper provided a good definition of the Special Way?  Yes.  Has<br>it succeeded in convincing me that the Special Way is still good, and that<br>the 22TET decatonic scale is a fresh vehicle for it?  Without a doubt.<br>What it hasn't provided is a name for the Special Way.  Maybe "tonality" is<br>best, but I didn't use it because it has so many other meanings.</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Special Way</h1><h3><a id=6970 href="#6970">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@nni.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/1998 8:21:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Paul Erlich wrote...<br><br>>The 7-limit harmony in barbershop is not merely "stuck on" to the<br>>diatonic scale; it consists of dominant seventh chords which are >diatonic<br>in function and origin, and the 27-cent adjustments required >to achieve JI<br>are not large enough to disturb the essential >diatonicity of the music.<br><br>You're nitpicking what I meant by "Stuck on"?<br><br>>As for the pitch sets being different for melody and harmony, don't >tell<br>me that the sevenths of these dominant seventh chords never occur >in the<br>melody!<br><br>They do, but not often.
