Pierce-Bohlen tuning also has a 9:7 interval<br>approximation, and its approximation is very similar with 88CET's (about 4 cents<br>sharp).  There are many other tunings - octave-based or not - that also<br>approximate this interval, such as 11TET, 22TET, 25TET, 33TET, 36TET, 41TET, and<br>72TET.  <br><br>   Next time around I'll give you my first two tips about 9:7s.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 3 Jan 1996 23:13 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id OAA21156; Wed, 3 Jan 1996 14:13:36 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 3 Jan 1996 14:13:36 -0800<br>Message-Id: <0099BDB8EBC9FA63.60BE@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Who's Afraid of the Big Bad 9:7?, Part 1</h1><h3><a id=2426 href="#2426">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/1996 2:12:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>This is the first in a series of posts.
