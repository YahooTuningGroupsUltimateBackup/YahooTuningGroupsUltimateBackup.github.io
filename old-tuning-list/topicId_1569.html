It provides MIDI transfer<br>of tuning data to instruments that support alternative tunings,<br>specifically Yamaha DX-, TX-, and SY- units, the Emu Proteus series,<br>the Ensoniq EPS series, and the MIDI Tuning Spec.  It also plays<br>up to 8 simultaneous tones using Macintosh local sound.<br><br>This stack requires Hypercard 2.0 or higher.  Sound on PowerMacs<br>requires QuickTime 2.0 or higher and QuickTime Musical Instruments.<br><br>JI Calc 4.4 changes (1/1/97)<br>New features:<br>- Single version for PowerMacs and 680x0s.  Checks for QuickTime<br>  and Sound Manager; uses them if present, falls back to older<br>  Sound Driver routines if absent.<br>- "Lattice" card draws diagrams of tunings.<br>- String length and fret position calculations for all tunings.<br>  (Thanks to Steve Curtin and John Chalmers.)<br>- "Help" stack is now identified with JI Calc version number.<br>- Holding "shift" while clicking Clear clears only the lower part<br>  of each ratio field (results of calculations).<br>- Ear training feature no longer repeats an interval twice in a row.<br>- Write and Read functions use standard file dialogs.<br>Fixes:<br>- Slower MIDI transfers to avoid problems with some fast PowerMacs<br>  and some synths.  Failure to transmit SY-77/99 tuning names fixed.<br>- Cosmetic changes to interface, incorporating Steve Curtin's "fret pos"<br>  and John Chalmers's "string len" buttons.<br>- Write and Read bugs fixed.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 20 Jan 1997 13:15 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07579; Sat, 18 Jan 1997 04:36:05 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07862<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id TAA26809; Fri, 17 Jan 1997 19:35:58 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 17 Jan 1997 19:35:58 -0800<br>Message-Id: <32E0455D.E48@sprynet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4636 href="#4636">ðŸ”—</a>Matt Nathan &#x3C;mattn@ix.netcom.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/1997 7:14:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>John Chalmers wrote:<br>> <br>> Date: Fri, 17 Jan 97 10:13:56 CST<br>> From: Gary Morrison <garym@rex.sps.mot.com><br>> To: non12@deltanet.com<br>> Subject: Web-Page Space<br>> <br>>    I'm FINALLY kinda-sorta starting to look into (generic) internet<br>> suppliers now.

You should probably look into one of the larger<br>national ISP's, like Webcom. You might also want to consider getting a<br>domain name, like "garytunes.com," which would enable you to move from<br>one ISP to another without changing your address.

Many of the smaller<br>ones don't. You'll see how many people a day hit the site, where they're<br>from, and what pages they visited.

You should probably look into one of the larger<br>national ISP's, like Webcom. You might also want to consider getting a<br>domain name, like "garytunes.com," which would enable you to move from<br>one ISP to another without changing your address.
