The current operating systems for<br>these instruments does not change the pitch of currently sounding notes when<br>the intonation table is changed.  A forthcoming operating system upgrade may<br>change this to instantaneously change the pitch of all sustaining and<br>released notes when the intonation table is changed.  My questions are:<br><br>1.  How many members would like all notes to instantaneouly change in pitch?<br>2.  How many members would prefer to have the operating system remain as is<br>so that only new notes use the newly selected intonation table?<br><br>I have versed this as an either/or question because the K2000/K2500 User<br>Interface does not have space to select between the two options.  A feature<br>to select between instantaneous/new note only tuning would have to be a<br>"hidden function" and will take more time to implement.  In other words, if<br>the change IS implemented then current users who need the new notes only<br>version would not be able to upgrade their operating system.  Also, since the<br>K2000 is ROM based, it is unlikely that more than one operating system<br>upgrade will be released.  This is not an issue for the K2500 Flash ROM based<br>O.S.  No other aspects of the intonation handling will be changed with the<br>next upgrade.  It will still be limited to one system level intonation table<br>at a time.<br><br>I've used many intonation capable MIDI instruments, including the TX81Z,<br>DX7IIFD+E!, EPS, EPS-16 Plus and the K2500.  I believe the K2000/K2500 to be<br>one of the most flexible in this regard, and hope to help it continue to<br>evolve in its intonation capabilities.<br><br>If you have other requests for Kurzweil intonation features, I can't really<br>process them at this time but hope to do so at a future date.<br><br>Important:  If you send email directly to me, please use my Compuserve<br>account:  75023.2426@compuserve.com.  I will be moving in a few weeks from<br>Kurzweil in Massachusetts to a new job in  the southern U.S. and will not<br>receive any mail for the ycrdi.com address after that time.  I could be<br>offline as long as 3 or 4 weeks but hopefully will not lose any messages.

It is <br>true that in using other signs as accidentals in front of notes you may <br>get notes with conflicting directions, e.g. an up arrow but a down comma <br>of some other sort, or two of one and three of another.<br><br>But I don't see this as a conflict. Nor would I see it as precipitating<br>working out cents values. In JI music that is truly harmonic, each pitch<br>may come from another, so that the signs in front of the notes show this<br>relationship, and therefore how to tune the note, including whom and what<br>to listen to most closely in the ensemble. Certainly Ben Johnston's <br>notation works this way, despite whatever problems it may have. It <br>suggests to performers that they are in a sense performing relationships. <br>Cents notations to me suggest performing fixed values out of context.<br><br>If Johnny finds that performers have to calculate cents, then I wonder <br>whether performers faced with a cents-notated score for JI have to <br>determine relationships, since no one performs numbers (i.e. cents <br>values) in an absolute sense.<br><br>In the only piece of JI I have had performed, the (amateur) performers<br>were indeed initially confused by the signs, wanting to know just how flat<br>or sharp certain notes were. But what does "a little sharp" or "quite<br>flat" mean when all you want is certain notes to be in tune? I taught them<br>to hear the harmonic structures, I suppose with some success, and kept the<br>cents values for the preface to the score, for those interested. This<br>turned out to be fairly close to 0% of the performing group, even<br>including a math teacher. <br><br>But I emphasize I have not had a lot of experience with performers in JI; <br>where I live there is little opportunity for this kind of thing.<br><br>Paul Rapoport<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 28 Oct 1996 22:17 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07142; Mon, 28 Oct 1996 05:56:19 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04747<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id UAA14960; Sun, 27 Oct 1996 20:56:17 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 27 Oct 1996 20:56:17 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v03007801ae99f1681c91@[130.132.159.66]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3895 href="#3895">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Rapoport &#x3C;rapoport@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/1996 2:01:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>If I read a notation that says 969 for this note and 840 for that, unless<br>I know the theory and have memorized arbitrary numbers, these two mean<br>rather little.

Contrary to <br>what you might think, microtones are rather easily invoked by <br>professional players.  One would be hard pressed to tell whether a <br>microtone was played or a "normal" note.  I once played the slow movement <br>melody of the Mozart Bassoon Concerto a quartertone low during a lecture <br>in York, England and asked if anyone heard any microtones.  They answered <br>assuredly - not at all.  I then told them that each and every note was a <br>microtone and they were aghast.<br> <br>> >    That is far easier than performing from a 7th or 13th harmonic sort of<br>> > description, because with that you'd have think - in realtime, on the fly - "OK,<br>> > what's the root of this chord (that in itself is especially tough since any<br>> > realistic performance each performer will have PARTS, and not the whole<br>> > conductor's score)?  How does this note relate to that root?  How much flat is a<br>> > 13th harmonic from the closest 12TET pitch?"  Or similarly, in 17TET say, "OK,<br>> > what's the tonic now?  Which scale step is this note relative to that tonic?<br>> > How much sharp or flat is that 17TET note from the 12TET value that my<br>> > instrument is designed to play?"  <br>> <br>> I don't think so. In JI in particular, the relationships are important,<br>> and you may not have to have a score, although knowing where your note<br>> "comes from" is significant. It may come from a previously sounding note. <br>> And in a fair amount of JI, the number of different notes in a passage<br>> (however defined) may not be high, so that memorizing a relationship sign<br>> isn't difficult, and no more so than a cents value. I agree that it's not<br>> easy, and in ETs it's still harder. <br>> <br>> It won't take a sharp person to figure that I don't work with performers<br>> very often in this material, partly because all the notations are a<br>> problem, which reflects bigger problems in actually performing the music<br>> with all but the most dedicated and experienced performers. In the<br>> electronic case, the relationships in the score are paramount and then the<br>> cents variations are not helpful unless you've memorized their<br>> relationships--in which case why not use the relationships directly? <br><br>Wherein an instrument can utilize tabliture, use it.  Guitar chords or <br>Harry Partch Bass Marimba notation make sense because of the culture <br>surrounding those respective instruments.  Cents notation as I've <br>described it puts the player in the "ball park" so that they can <br>appreciate the relative qualities of specific intervallic relationships.<br><br>For instance: if you want a player to play a 5/4 above a C, <br>notate it as an E -14 and<br>the player will IMMEDIATELY understand the the traditional E is to be <br>approached at a lower pitch level, thereby aiding in the understanding of <br>placing the pitch _in relation_ to another.  If you want a player to play <br>a 5/4 above a C +10, then notate an E -4.  Players would see that the E <br>-4 is not so different than a traditional E, just shaded in a low direction.<br><br>If one uses cents combined with a basic quartertone notation, then it <br>will not be necessary to "teach" players much at all, which will more <br>than likely make them happier about participating in a new sonic <br>adventure.  I think it is incumbant upon a microtonal composer that is <br>writing for players to utilize the decades of learning that they have <br>invested in their careers.  They will realize the justice of the new <br>intervals.<br><br>Johnny Reinhard<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 5 Nov 1996 01:24 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00690; Tue, 5 Nov 1996 01:25:38 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00688<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id QAA05722; Mon, 4 Nov 1996 16:25:35 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 4 Nov 1996 16:25:35 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.961104161732.4156A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3912 href="#3912">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@CompuServe.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/1996 7:03:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> If more than a few cents variations are put in front of a performer, I'd<br>> guess that either it wouldn't make any difference, or it would be<br>> difficult, unless you want only gross approximations.<br><br>   Actually you might be surprised, because there are patterns you can use to<br>derive, and more importantly to remember, them.

Perhaps this isn't saying much, but I know<br>that I couldn't do it.  <br><br>   Let's assume that you have notation system that can augment each note-head<br>with information for both frequency-ratio relative to a tonic, and with the<br>choice of tonic itself (it would be pretty hopeless otherwise).  Let's also<br>assume that tonics don't wander (without cent-based notation that would utterly<br>hopeless although pretty feasible with it).<br><br>   The composition is notated in C Major.  Two bars back you saw a notated<br>tonic-shift to A, and somehow the notation somehow prescribes that to be a 5:3 A<br>relative to the C of the key signature.  You encounter a sequence of four<br>quarters in 4-4 time at 120bpm (a moderate pace of notes).  The notes are:<br><br>                C# with an 11 over it (meaning 11th harmonic of the A),<br>                D with a 4 over it (meaning the usual 4:3 to A),<br>                B with a 10 over it (meaning 10:9 to the A),<br>                F# with a 5 over it (meaning 5:3 to the A).<br><br>OK, let's play it now.  Here's what you think:<br><br>  "The shift to the A tonic happened four seconds ago, you got that, right?  It<br>was an A right, or was it D like the last time?  Yeah, A.  OK the first beat of<br>the is coming up measure;  better get the first note out.  A.  Let's see that's<br>a comma-shift upward.  No downward.  Downward, right.  Everything is shifted a<br>comma down from what the harmonics tell me.  First note C# as 11th harmonic.<br>11the harmonic is pretty much right on a quarter tone.  So does that mean that I<br>play a quartertone sharp or flat of a C#?  Flat, right flat; that's our<br>convention.  Wowwy, this half-second-long beat sure has gone by fast!  <br><br>   Whoah, that clarinet just played a real klinker on the half-beat there!<br>Should I adjust my pitch?  No, that's OK, that's pretty much what it sounded<br>like in our one-and-only rehearsal.  Never mind that; time's a-wastin';  I'd<br>better get back to get this C# out!  OK so we've got a quartertone flat of a C#,<br>so that's this fingering.  No wait, this is all relative to A, not C, so I have<br>to go down a comma from there.  I guess that would be this fingering instead.<br>Right.  OK ready to roll...  Now where's the beat?  Ooooookay, right ... NOW!<br>Switch fingerings.  <br><br>   How does it sound?  Ooop, a little flat.  Probably better lip it up a tad."<br><br>   That's a pretty full half-second of your life!  Those extra steps of<br>remembering how an 11th harmonic is tuned, and then offsetting that by how much<br>an A is tuned relative to a C sure would be great not to have to work out!  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 4 Nov 1996 19:16 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04848; Sat, 2 Nov 1996 23:04:12 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07099<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id OAA03806; Sat, 2 Nov 1996 14:04:08 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 2 Nov 1996 14:04:08 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9611021709.A7069-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5938 href="#5938">ðŸ”—</a>Jakob Draminsky Hojmark &#x3C;101710.2145@CompuServe.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/7/1997 5:38:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Hi, does anybody on this list have a good system for notation of 19-ET and 31-ET<br>in a way where you maintain the relation to the 12-ET pentagram?<br><br>Jakob Draminsky Hojmark<br>101717.2145@compuserve.com<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com<br>Subject:  RE: notation<br>PostedDate:  07-08-97 21:59:32<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  07-08-97 21:59:33-07-08-97 21:59:34,07-08-97 21:58:03-07-08-97 21:58:04<br>DeliveredDate:  07-08-97 21:58:04<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564EC.006DD0D0; Thu, 7 Aug 1997 21:59:28 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05621; Thu, 7 Aug 1997 21:59:32 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 7 Aug 1997 21:59:32 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05610<br>Received: (qmail 6173 invoked from network); 7 Aug 1997 19:59:26 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 7 Aug 1997 19:59:26 -0000<br>Message-Id: <c=US%a=_%p=Acadian-Asset%l=MARS-970807192327Z-2235@mars.acadian-asset.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5945 href="#5945">ðŸ”—</a>gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)</h3><span>8/11/1997 11:44:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I wouldn't know a 12-ET pentagram if it came up and bit<br>me on the nose.

It is <br>true that in using other signs as accidentals in front of notes you may <br>get notes with conflicting directions, e.g. an up arrow but a down comma <br>of some other sort, or two of one and three of another.<br><br>But I don't see this as a conflict. Nor would I see it as precipitating<br>working out cents values. In JI music that is truly harmonic, each pitch<br>may come from another, so that the signs in front of the notes show this<br>relationship, and therefore how to tune the note, including whom and what<br>to listen to most closely in the ensemble. Certainly Ben Johnston's <br>notation works this way, despite whatever problems it may have. It <br>suggests to performers that they are in a sense performing relationships. <br>Cents notations to me suggest performing fixed values out of context.<br><br>If Johnny finds that performers have to calculate cents, then I wonder <br>whether performers faced with a cents-notated score for JI have to <br>determine relationships, since no one performs numbers (i.e. cents <br>values) in an absolute sense.<br><br>In the only piece of JI I have had performed, the (amateur) performers<br>were indeed initially confused by the signs, wanting to know just how flat<br>or sharp certain notes were.

One easy example is forked<br>fingerings on woodwinds.  This is a little bit of an overgeneralization but it's<br>mostly true:  The more toneholes you close below the highest opened tonehole the<br>flatter that note gets.  Similarly on brasses, there are certain valve<br>combinations that are known to tend to be sharp or flat.  So the problem is<br>essentially one of quantifying and memorizing.  <br><br><br><br>> > ...  Which scale step is this note relative to that tonic?<br>> > How much sharp or flat is that 17TET note from the 12TET value that my<br>> > instrument is designed to play?"  <br>> <br>> I don't think so. In JI in particular, the relationships are important,<br>> and you may not have to have a score, ... so that memorizing a relationship<br>sign<br>> isn't difficult, and no more so than a cents value.<br><br>   Not too difficult you think eh?  Perhaps this isn't saying much, but I know<br>that I couldn't do it.  <br><br>   Let's assume that you have notation system that can augment each note-head<br>with information for both frequency-ratio relative to a tonic, and with the<br>choice of tonic itself (it would be pretty hopeless otherwise).  Let's also<br>assume that tonics don't wander (without cent-based notation that would utterly<br>hopeless although pretty feasible with it).<br><br>   The composition is notated in C Major.  Two bars back you saw a notated<br>tonic-shift to A, and somehow the notation somehow prescribes that to be a 5:3 A<br>relative to the C of the key signature.  You encounter a sequence of four<br>quarters in 4-4 time at 120bpm (a moderate pace of notes).  The notes are:<br><br>                C# with an 11 over it (meaning 11th harmonic of the A),<br>                D with a 4 over it (meaning the usual 4:3 to A),<br>                B with a 10 over it (meaning 10:9 to the A),<br>                F# with a 5 over it (meaning 5:3 to the A).<br><br>OK, let's play it now.  Here's what you think:<br><br>  "The shift to the A tonic happened four seconds ago, you got that, right?  It<br>was an A right, or was it D like the last time?  Yeah, A.  OK the first beat of<br>the is coming up measure;  better get the first note out.  A.  Let's see that's<br>a comma-shift upward.  No downward.  Downward, right.  Everything is shifted a<br>comma down from what the harmonics tell me.  First note C# as 11th harmonic.<br>11the harmonic is pretty much right on a quarter tone.  So does that mean that I<br>play a quartertone sharp or flat of a C#?  Flat, right flat; that's our<br>convention.  Wowwy, this half-second-long beat sure has gone by fast!  <br><br>   Whoah, that clarinet just played a real klinker on the half-beat there!<br>Should I adjust my pitch?  No, that's OK, that's pretty much what it sounded<br>like in our one-and-only rehearsal.  Never mind that; time's a-wastin';  I'd<br>better get back to get this C# out!  OK so we've got a quartertone flat of a C#,<br>so that's this fingering.  No wait, this is all relative to A, not C, so I have<br>to go down a comma from there.  I guess that would be this fingering instead.<br>Right.  OK ready to roll...  Now where's the beat?  Ooooookay, right ... NOW!<br>Switch fingerings.  <br><br>   How does it sound?  Ooop, a little flat.  Probably better lip it up a tad."<br><br>   That's a pretty full half-second of your life!  Those extra steps of<br>remembering how an 11th harmonic is tuned, and then offsetting that by how much<br>an A is tuned relative to a C sure would be great not to have to work out!  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 4 Nov 1996 19:16 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04848; Sat, 2 Nov 1996 23:04:12 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07099<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id OAA03806; Sat, 2 Nov 1996 14:04:08 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 2 Nov 1996 14:04:08 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9611021709.A7069-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5938 href="#5938">ðŸ”—</a>Jakob Draminsky Hojmark &#x3C;101710.2145@CompuServe.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/7/1997 5:38:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Hi, does anybody on this list have a good system for notation of 19-ET and 31-ET<br>in a way where you maintain the relation to the 12-ET pentagram?<br><br>Jakob Draminsky Hojmark<br>101717.2145@compuserve.com<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com<br>Subject:  RE: notation<br>PostedDate:  07-08-97 21:59:32<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  07-08-97 21:59:33-07-08-97 21:59:34,07-08-97 21:58:03-07-08-97 21:58:04<br>DeliveredDate:  07-08-97 21:58:04<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564EC.006DD0D0; Thu, 7 Aug 1997 21:59:28 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05621; Thu, 7 Aug 1997 21:59:32 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 7 Aug 1997 21:59:32 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05610<br>Received: (qmail 6173 invoked from network); 7 Aug 1997 19:59:26 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 7 Aug 1997 19:59:26 -0000<br>Message-Id: <c=US%a=_%p=Acadian-Asset%l=MARS-970807192327Z-2235@mars.acadian-asset.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5945 href="#5945">ðŸ”—</a>gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)</h3><span>8/11/1997 11:44:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I wouldn't know a 12-ET pentagram if it came up and bit<br>me on the nose.
