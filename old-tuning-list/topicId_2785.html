I can find no opposing example.  With 12 pitch<br>classes, then, the harmonic vocabulary is enhanced, with no reduction<br>in the number of genera that fulfil Gregg's criteria.  This is a<br>strange argument for 19 equal.  Gregg's replies are unconvincing:<br><br>> ... but the resulting modes conflate a number of<br>> aurally distinct modes into single, neutral modes, and lack much of the<br>> distinct melodic character of the 19-tone versions.<br><br>Which modes cease to be distinct?  Of course, the melodic character<br>will be different in different tunings, but that is not to say one is<br>superior to the others.  In good old 31 equal, you get the added bonus<br>of septimal chords, consonant or otherwise.<br><br>The other arguments are all specifically about 12 equal, and not the<br>infinity of meantone temperaments in which the genera also work.<br><br><br>To the more general argument:<br><br>> Hence, 19-tone equal gives rise to a powerful contrast between<br>> consonance and dissonance, both melodically and harmonically speaking.<br>> The effect is to give music a kind of elastic, forward impetus quite<br>> unknown in the 12-tone equal, which has a more static, uncertain<br>> esthetic.<br><br>This is a good description of 19 equal.  I can see the relevance to<br>rock music, but some of us like a bit more subtlety.  The consonances<br>are acceptable. but not that good.  Minor triads have a uniquely<br>bright sound, which may be a result of the good minor third.  The<br>dissonances something to behold.<br><br>> The prinicipal<br>> temperaments are 12- 19- 31- 43- 50- & 55-tone equal.<br><br>Gregg's dislike of non-meantone temperaments is well established.  As<br>an existentialist, I cannot agree, because I use and will continue to<br>use such temperaments.  However, his neglect of non-equal temperaments<br>is so far unjustified.  The obvious scale he's overlooking is<br>LucyTuning, whose 54 cent diesis is at the bottom of the melodic limen.<br>As the difference between 19 equal and LucyTuning is well below a<br>melodic limen, melodies will presumably remain distinctive after the<br>transition.  Singers should be able to make the distinctions if they<br>are trained with 19 pitch classes.  The advantage is that both melodies<br>and harmonies sound a lot better -- but there I go with my opinions<br>again.  So, Gregg, how about it?<br><br><br>Now, I'd just like to clear this up:<br><br>> To give some idea of just how immense this universe is - and remember<br>> these are _real_, usable resources, not purely theoretical, aurally<br>> imperceptible variations - compare the number of modes (I here use the<br>> term loosely merely to indicate a collection of seven notes used in a<br>> melody) consisting of 12 notes taken 7 at a time:<br>><br>> nCr   where n = 12   &   r = 7<br>> = 792<br>> with the number of modes consisting of 19 notes taken 7 at a time:<br>> nCr    where n = 19  &  r = 7<br>> = 50,388<br><br>Really, you should define modes relative to a tonic, so the numbers<br>get smaller.  With 12, you're choosing 6 from 11, which gives 462<br>modes. 19C6 is 12376.  The contrast is still striking.  Including<br>all the transpositions, you get 462*12=5544 and 12376*19=235144.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Re: Reply 3 to Graham Breed<br>PostedDate:  15-12-97 15:58:13<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  15-12-97 15:56:17-15-12-97 15:56:19,15-12-97 15:55:59-15-12-97 15:55:59<br>DeliveredDate:  15-12-97 15:55:59<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656E.00520AA3; Mon, 15 Dec 1997 15:58:03 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA15977; Mon, 15 Dec 1997 15:58:13 +0100<br>Date: Mon, 15 Dec 1997 15:58:13 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA15986<br>Received: (qmail 4430 invoked from network); 15 Dec 1997 06:58:04 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 15 Dec 1997 06:58:04 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541100b0ba70a28227@[207.207.2.39]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6650 href="#6650">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>12/15/1997 8:57:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>If the man on the street wanted music in other<br>>temperaments than 12, don't you think he would have asked for it by now?<br><br>   Well, that's one way to put it!<br><br>   I think it's fair to say that the music scene in general asks for new<br>tunings, but as for whether 19 is the best way to go ...
