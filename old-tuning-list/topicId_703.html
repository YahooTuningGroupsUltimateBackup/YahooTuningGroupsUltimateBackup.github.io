The implication of notating a minor third as a pythagorean <br>> minor third plus the "best" syntonic comma is that it should be the best <br>> minor third, i.e., closest to just. When a better minor third is available <br>> in the tuning, which happens in 20tET, and even 17tET which you describe on <br>> the fifth page of your paper, the notation will obscure this fact. So I <br>> object to your definition of a "best" comma.<br><br>"Best" has a strict mathematical, as opposed to musical definition. <br>Consequently, the most desirable musical result may conflict. Of course <br>you may rework the notation to reflect that. I chose not to, simply <br>because I was aiming at a general method. The method accounts for all the <br>usual notations of many ETs, such as 19, 22, 31, 43, 53, 72, and others, <br>including many not usually used. It also allows for an improvement in <br>Blackwood's notations in a few cases.<br><br>I disagree with Paul E. that there is an implication that the best minor<br>third is what he says. Obviously it will frequently emerge from the<br>complement of the M3 in the P5, but certainly in 20 it doesn't.<br><br>However, it does seem possible to build a notation out of various<br>intervals; using 1:3 and 1:5 is quite sensible, traditional, and powerful<br>(in terms of theory and explanatory adequacy). I look forward to an<br>article using, say, 1:3 and 3:5, but I think 1:5 is a better choice. <br><br>Let's look at 17. Assuming a starting point of D, the 5-unit m3 is F/.<br>What's wrong with that? Of course this is also F#\, reflecting the<br>important fact that this tuning contains a neutral third. In other words,<br>the M3 and m3 meet at 5 units. If you want a 282-cent m3, because it is a<br>few cents closer to the just 5:6, that's fine; it may be called F.<br><br>There is no more inherent reason to expect the m3 and M3 to "behave<br>properly" than there is for cycles of P5 or for the M3 and P5 together.<br>Some tunings, like 25 and marginally like 17, may have two minor thirds.<br>Tunings with large numbers of units in the octave may have several of<br>everything. I don't find this a fault of notation in general or of my <br>proposal.<br><br>In 20 there is the curious result that all the extant commas are an even <br>number of units, but it doesn't matter.<br><br>> Now I noticed there is a part of your paper where you give an example of <br>> defining a comma to be other than its "best" size, and show the problems <br>> that entails for notation. Though you refer to the alternate comma <br>> definition as the "disposition" of the tuning, as if it were a property of <br>> the tuning itself, one might infer from that discussion that the "best" <br>> comma size is the one to use. However, for tunings like 20tET which do not <br>> possess 5-limit consistency, this is not a clear-cut issue.<br>> <br>Tunings have many properties, all of which cannot be most clearly shown <br>at once. The discussion does not imply that the "best" size always works. <br>Quite the contrary. That is one point of the article. In some cases I <br>am unsure what to do about it. I intend a follow-up article at some time.<br><br>> The other commas you use derive from equivalences in 12tET, and therefore <br>> seem undesirable for a progressive microtonal notation.<br><br>In one sense this is true, viz. that the Pythagorean komma is 12v-7a, <br>where v is a P5 and a is an octave. That governs a lot, as that komma <br>figures in the others. But in another sense it's irrelevant, because I <br>have attempted to maintain some conventions, including heptatonic naming, <br>which are based on pre-12 considerations, as Paul E. shows, all in a 5-limit.<br>But I don't "measure" all tunings "in reference to 12-tET."<br><br>> In your notation, the syntonic comma is a natural expansion of the standard <br>> notation, so that the entire 5-limit just system can be expressed in terms <br>> of the Pythagorean scheme above. This works fine for tunings that are <br>> consistent within the 5-limit. But the other commas are measured as the <br>> difference between three major thirds and an octave, and so notating them as <br>> an alteration, rather than an essentially different note, implies an <br>> underlying dodecaphony, much as standard notation implies an underlying <br>> heptatonicism.<br><br>I don't think so. It implies setting up the 3-limit to take care of itself<br>(sharps/flats) and then seeing what happens with the 5-limit intervals in<br>terms of the octave, as Paul E. states. There's no 12 in there. By the <br>way, I am quite interested in nonstandard naming too, as a previous XH <br>article on 13-tET shows. Would Paul E. elaborate on notating something with <br>different notes? It's hard to see how he gets from commas to notes in the <br>quotation above.<br><br>What is "consistent within the 5-limit"? He may have something because, <br>on occasion, use of kommas others than syntonic seems a bit arbitrary. In <br>some cases it's fine, as in 31.<br><br>> Our present notation system was established long before 12tET became <br>> standard. If 19tET or 31tET had become standard instead, your basic set of <br>> non-syntonic commas would be quite different. If the practice of notating <br>> and differentiating syntonic commas in music had become standard, your set <br>> of other commas might have derived from equivalences in 22 or 34tET. You <br>> would have to argue that your set of commas comes solely from a <br>> consideration of the simplest small intervals in just intonation to justify <br>> this apparant reliance on 12tET equivalences.<br><br>In a sense this is true, with reference to the 12v-7a I mentioned <br>earlier. But that is possibly a simpler comma than 19v-11a, 31v-18a, <br>22v-13a, etc. Maybe we should go for 7v-4a?<br><br>The interesting question then becomes how do you build a general system, <br>let us say still on a 5 limit, without this one bit of 12 in it--a system <br>which is no more tied to anything than this one is? <br><br>> A final quibble: A positive tuning is customarily defined as one where g# is <br>> higher than a-flat, i.e., where the perfect fifth is larger than the 12tET <br>> fifth, not the just fifth as you state. Thus the sign of the pythagorean <br>> comma is the determining factor here, and so the customary definition would <br>> fit better into your own scheme.<br><br>This isn't a quibble, it's an outright error. It has been pointed out<br>before, and quite honestly I don't know how I let it get in there. Paul E.<br>is correct. <br><br>> You illustration of 171tET notation is interesting. A simpler tuning that <br>> has consistent and unique representations through the 16th harmonic is <br>> 111tET. For example, the sequence 16:15,15:14,14:13,13:12,12:11,11:10 is <br>> represented by 10,11,12,13,14,15 steps in 111-tET<br><br>This bears consideration, I believe.<br><br>I am grateful to Paul Erlich for his thorough consideration of my <br>article.
