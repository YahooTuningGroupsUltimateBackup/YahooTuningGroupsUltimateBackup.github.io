I'm sorry if it's <br>> not politically correct to identify the intellectual stumbling blocks of<br>> past civilizations.<br><br>I thought this old chestnut concerning Aristoxenus had been laid to rest; <br>clearly I was wrong. The adoption, in the 16th century of Aristoxenus as the <br>father of equal temperament tells us much about the ideas of 16th century <br>musici looking for antique sources to justify their intuitions about lute <br>and viol tunings, but it says little or nothing of value regarding the ideas <br>of Aristoxenus himself. In constructing his tetrachords, Aristoxenus accepts <br>both the 4/3 as the boundary of the tetrachord, and the 9/8 as the tone of <br>disjunction; if you doubt this, I suggest you read Aristoxenus, together <br>with Barker's footnotes. Now this leads to a contradiction in the <br>description of the various tetrachords: the diatonic, for instance consists <br>of two tones and a semitone, but since he has already accepted the 9/8 tone, <br>(9/8)^2 * sqrt(9/8) must equal 4/3, which they obviously do not. Don't take <br>my word for this; if you're short of time, might I suggest one passage in <br>particular: Elementa Harmonica, Book II, 56-7. Here Aristoxenus attempts to <br>give a practical proof that two-and-a-half tones equals a fourth, with a <br>proof that depends on tuning a fifth correctly; the fifth, however, must be <br>flat by a Pythagorean comma in order to make the proof work. But Aristoxenus <br>never indicates any such drastic flattening, nor does he even once, in the <br>whole treatise, ever suggest tempering intervals. Trying to pick your way <br>through this and other arithmetical contradictions can lead, I am convinced, <br>to only one honest conclusion: that Aristoxenus should be understood as <br>providing us with essentially vague, musicianly descriptions, which are <br>distorted if we begin to squint too hard at the details, and try to endow <br>them with more mathematical rigour than he ever countenanced -- this is the <br>problem with later apologists from Cleonides to the 16th century. <br>Aristoxenus himself implicitly encourages this attitude, when he states <br>that, in the manner of his teacher Aristotle, music theory should be <br>regarded as an autonomous discipline, relying on its own concepts rather <br>than being subordinate to, say, acoustics or to the arithmetic of the <br>rationals. I don't personally endorse this approach, but I don't think it's <br>intellectually dishonourable; but twisting Aristoxenus in directions he <br>never intended is a distinctly more dubious pastime.<br><br>If, for the sake of argument, we follow Aristotle and Aristoxenus in taking <br>music theory as an autonomous discipline, then of course we will think in <br>terms of adding or subtracting intervals, rather than multiplying or <br>dividing ratios. Aristoxenus's diatonic tetrachord, with its two equal-sized <br>tones, would appear to be nothing other than the standard Pythagorean <br>diatonic (the "ditonic diatonic" in Ptolemy's list) -- the only difference <br>being that Aristoxenus eschews the Pythagorean ratio description. In this <br>case, we can argue our way from Pythagoras to Aristoxenus along the <br>following path:<br><br>           9/8 * 9/8 * 256/243 4/3<br><br>           log(9/8) + log(9/8) + log(256/243) 4/3<br><br>           tone + tone + limma diatessaron (fourth)<br><br>and if we are to take Aristoxenus as a faithful reporter of contemporary <br>musicians' thinking, the limma was taken to be half of a tone, so:<br><br>           tone + tone + semitone fourth.<br><br>But we must note that this was the informal thinking of people who are <br>concerned with their art rather than with theoretical niceties; it was <br>certainly not a matter of sophisticated mathematical reasoning far in <br>advance of its time, involoving irrational quantities in the specification <br>of the semitone, whether (9/8)^(1/2) or 2^(1/12); nor does Aristoxenus <br>provide any such reasoning.<br><br>> I do agree that in most cases the diatonic scale existed without a<br>> standardized tuning. I believe that the creation of similar tetrachords <br>> was the only guiding principle in most cases, since I do not believe that<br>> 5-limit or higher ratios are relevant to purely melodic music. The 3-limit<br>> (and even 2-limit) approximations have a wide range of tolerance when<br>> harmony is not an issue, or when inharmonic instruments make the value of<br>> just intonation questionable.<br><br>What is a 2-limit approximation of a diatonic scale. The "2-limit" gives us <br>nothing but octaves. Or did you mean 2^1/x, in which case the "limit" <br>terminology is out of place.<br> <br>> What is "mystical" about Ptolemy is that he insisted on superparticular<br>> ratios and a geocentric universe with purely circular motions as if these<br>> were some sort of revealed truths. They ended up requiring exceedingly<br>> complicated models to approach the fairly simple realities. It is just as<br>> fair to criticize his views as it is to criticize Aristotelian physics.<br>> Where would the world be if no one had ever criticized Aristotelian<br>> physics? If a schoolteacher were to teach Aristotelian physics today, <br>> would it not be fair to criticize them? <br><br>Reading the first two books of Ptolemy's Harmonics certainly doesn't suggest <br>a mystical approach to the description of Greek tuning practices; Ptolemy <br>remains faithful to the approach he gives at the beginning: the testing of <br>all reasoning by empirical means. The superparticulars 2/1 (which is also <br>multiple) 3/2, 4/3 and 9/8 were not challenged by any Greek theorist; <br>Ptolemy reasoned that all melodics (i.e. conjunct intervals in tetrachords) <br>should similarly consist of superparticulars, on the assumption that an <br>observed pattern should not be thrown aside at the first hint of <br>uncertainty, but should be explored further to see if it will yield further <br>results that stand up to empirical testing. We can carry out this project <br>with greater rigour than Ptolemy, who could only rely upon his ears. But we <br>see in various places that he certainly didn't treat the superparticular <br>principle as a sacred truth: witness his readiness to grant that the intense <br>diatonic tetrachord used in singing was approximated by the still more <br>easily tunable ditonic diatonic, even though the latter involved a <br>non-superparticular ration (namely the 256/243). (Another of Ptolemy's <br>departures from any doctrinal presentation is the listing of the six tunings <br>customarily used in his time by practising musicians: four of the six <br>combine two different tetrachordal tunings.) <br><br>> Matt, you could be given a Mozart string piece which would have to descend<br>> by, say, seven commas from beginning to end, if it is to have all chords <br>> in just intonation and no comma shifts in sustained tones (this is <br>> actually a typical scenario). Even though the beginning and ending keys <br>> may be notated exactly, you would say that the piece ends in a distincly <br>> different key than it began. Would your analysis reflect the musical <br>> reality better than the traditional analysis? I think not! What if the<br>> piece was a keyboard piece?<br>> Forget it!<br><br>Leopold Mozart, being representative of a 17th/18th-century string playing <br>tradition, specified 1/6th-comma meantone as the tuning which expert players <br>should employ. His son, it seems, endorsed this (see the Chesnut article <br>"Mozart's Teaching of Intonation" in JAMS, c.1980 -- sorry about the vague <br>date), and with it the corollory of tuning flats higher than sharps that <br>mean-tone tunings share with just intonation. Since string players are <br>limited by the tuning of their open strings, they cannot incorporate any <br>irreversable comma shifts (as opposed to some local fluctuation), but the <br>use of any meantone tuning removes this problem, by means of their different <br>characteristic compromises. As for a Mozart keyboard piece, equal <br>temperament was in the process of supplanting well-tempered systems for <br>keyboards in the German-speaking lands during Mozart's lifetime -- what of <br>it. Just intonation of the type requiring comma shifts (i.e. prohibiting <br>intervals such as 40/27) has two obvious home grounds: a capella singing, in <br>which it can be employed intuitively, and in electro-acoustic music, where <br>it can be applied by calculation. Any other application requires special <br>efforts; Johnston string quartets, yes, but Mozart, no. <br><br>-- <br>Jonathan Walker<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 26 Feb 1997 15:56 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18649; Wed, 26 Feb 1997 15:56:33 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18675<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id GAA29788; Wed, 26 Feb 1997 06:54:09 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 26 Feb 1997 06:54:09 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.970226085326.27137D-100000@library><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>History of the Diatonic Scale - Aristoxenus and Ptolemy</h1><h3><a id=4891 href="#4891">ðŸ”—</a>kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk (Jonathan Walker)</h3><span>2/25/1997 11:51:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Manuel Op de Coul wrote:<br><br>> If the Greeks had not their <br>> absolutist Pythagorean/Platonic insistence on ratios in explaining <br>> everything, to the extent that the discovery of irrational numbers was a <br>> forbidden secret,would they not have progressed farther in mathematics and <br>> science?
