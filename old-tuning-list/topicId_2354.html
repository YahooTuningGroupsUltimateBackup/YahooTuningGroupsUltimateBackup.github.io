People who use ratio space are now on<br>familiar ground.  As this is a general way of writing pitch, H has<br>to be octave specific.

A scale is defined on a basis<br>using a matrix containing only integers.  Each note in a scale<br>must have a unique definition in terms of the basis.  That means<br>that no basis interval can be defined in terms of the other ones<br>using rational multiples.  A scale by this definition is a<br>discrete vector space.  Look up vector spaces to see how close the<br>analogy is.  The concept of basis of a musical scale has been<br>defined before, although not in terms of matrices.  This is all<br>very similar to group theory.  I have defined the basic dimension<br>of a scale as the number of intervals in its basis.  I think this<br>is the same as the dimension of the vector space, but I didn't<br>take good enough notes in my linear algebra classes to be sure.<br><br><br>A C major scale (not the only one) can be defined using t, s and p<br>as follows:<br><br>                C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C<br>                 t+p  t   s  t+p  t  p+t  s<br><br>This can be written using matrices:<br><br>                        (C)   (5 3 2)<br>                        (B)   (5 3 1)<br>                        (A)   (4 2 1)<br>                        (G)   (3 2 1)(t)<br>                        (F) = (2 1 1)(s)<br>                        (E)   (2 0 1)(p)<br>                        (D)   (1 0 1)<br>                        (C)   (0 0 0)<br><br><br><br>That covers JI.  For temperaments, the basis is defined on H using<br>fractions.  By "temperament" I mean a scale that approximates JI<br>using fewer notes.  Temperaments can be treated like JI if you<br>use an approximate matrix H' that pretends to be H, but is slightly<br>different.  As an example, 1/4 comma meantone can be defined as<br>follows:<br><br>                          (1 0 0   )    (1200)<br>                     H' = (1 0 0.25)H = (1897) cents<br>                          (0 0 1   )    (2786)<br><br>You can then redefine t, s and p in terms of H':<br><br>                   (t)   (1 -2  1)     (-1 0  0.5 )<br>                   (s) = (4 -1 -1)H' = ( 3 0 -1.25)H<br>                   (p)   (-4 4 -1)     ( 0 0  0   )<br><br>You can get the last matrix using standard matrix arithmetic.<br><br>Not surprisingly, the approximate syntonic comma comes out the<br>same as a unison in 1/4 comma meantone.  As t, s and p constitute<br>a basis for JI, t and s are a basis for a negative meantone.<br>Hence a meantone, or linear temperament, is a 2-D scale.  The<br>first two rows of H' also constitute a basis for a negative<br>meantone, so the third row can be defined in terms of these:<br><br>                                ( 1 0)<br>                           H' = ( 0 1)H'<br>                                (-4 4)<br><br>I explained how to define this matrix back in TD1132 (the second<br>of the digests numbered 1132).  Using it, you can approximate any<br>5-limit interval as a Pythagorean interval.  Any negative meantone<br>can be defined by the basis:<br><br>                         (t) = (-3  2)H'<br>                         (s)   ( 8 -5)<br><br><br><br>Matrices can also be used to describe scales that are not even<br>approximations of JI.
