When re-tuning, the samples of the note<br>numbers are used rather that the samples that would work with the pitch<br>setting.  31TET sounded very bad because high end and low end samples would<br>be used inappropriately.  At the web page of the Electronic Music Foundation<br>they ( http://www.emf.org/index.html ) are offering a Morpheus for $629 if<br>you join their organization ($100).  This is less than half the retail<br>price!  The Morpheus is a descendant of the Proteus line and as such accepts<br>the same SysEx messages.  Does anyone know if the corrected the problem of<br>sample shifting has been corrected?  Can anyone point me to an expert who<br>would know?
