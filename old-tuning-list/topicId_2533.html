I've<br>been told there will be a Partch premiere this year. Also, the Haverstick<br>band, with Ernie Crews on percussion and John Starrett on bass, will do a<br>set of music in 19 and 34 tone equal temps. Schneider will also give a<br>master class at Denver University, and Starrett and Richard Krantz will<br>do a talk on math and tunings at Metro State college.

I would love<br>to have a 22 tone axe to mess with...anybody got an extra they could part<br>with? As for 34, it is a very deep and profound tuning, and little<br>explored. The 3rds are only 2 cents off, the 5th is about 4cents sharp,<br>and almost all of the intervals are no more than 3 or 4 cents off of<br>perfect ratios. This gives 34 a very strong, though relaxed, sound that<br>resonates very well. It has 2 cycles of 5ths, and a cycle of major (and<br>minor) 3rds that  only resolves after going through 34 different<br>notes...this is a feature which I plan to explore soon in compositions,<br>and I am sure it will lead to some most unusual possibilities. As always,<br>each tuning has it's strengths and weaknesses, and the end result of<br>tuning theory is, hopefully, great music. The potential of a tuning<br>system is only as good as the artist working with it, and the logic of<br>the interval structure must be brought to life by a creative force...the<br>tools must be used in masterful ways.<br><br>   One more thing...Pat Metheny's new album, "Imaginary Days," features<br>him on fretless guitar in several places. I only heard it once, and what<br>I heard was great...now, is he just winging it by ear, or has he decided<br>to get into non 12 systems? I don't yet know, but I thought it was some<br>of the best playing I've yet heard of his...Hstick<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  DrewLesso@aol.com<br>Subject:  more loose thoughts<br>PostedDate:  18-10-97 07:07:10<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  18-10-97 07:06:23-18-10-97 07:06:24,18-10-97 06:07:06-18-10-97 06:07:07<br>DeliveredDate:  18-10-97 06:07:07<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256534.001C0B8A; Sat, 18 Oct 1997 07:06:19 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA20056; Sat, 18 Oct 1997 07:07:10 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 18 Oct 1997 07:07:10 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA20274<br>Received: (qmail 21225 invoked from network); 17 Oct 1997 22:07:06 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 17 Oct 1997 22:07:06 -0700<br>Message-Id: <971018010129_302845703@emout03.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Microstock 3 and various</h1><h3><a id=6295 href="#6295">ðŸ”—</a>Aline Surman &#x3C;stick@dnvr.uswest.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/1997 3:10:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On October 25, we'll be doing our annual Microstock gig, this year at<br>Swallow Hill Music Hall, 1905 S.
