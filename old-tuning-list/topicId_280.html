Just before last Xmas, <br>Brian Thomson posted some examples of sine-modulated equal temperaments. <br>SMET's are ETs in which the interval width is periodically varied to <br>improve the consonance of certain intervals, at least in the mode <br>starting on the note 0. Brian used the formula A*sin(pi*F*N/ET) where F is <br>the frequency (restricted to even numbers in this case), A is the <br>amplitude, N is the note index and ET is the number of notes per octave). <br>The phase is 0 at tone #0.<br>	I wrote a simple 1-D search program BASIC program and minimized <br>the sum of the abolute values of the errors between the closest SMET <br>notes and the JI intervals 3/2, 4/3, 5/4, 6/5, 5/3 and  8/5, a somewhat<br> different set than BT used. The summed absolute error, squared error, <br>mean deviation, variance  and standard deviations were computed in cents <br>for each SMET. Other evaluation and statistical functions could have beed <br>used, but these seemed appropriate to me.<br>	Results were obtained for the 12,15,17,19, 22, 24, and 31-tets. <br>The errors of some unmodulated ET's are small enough that "improvement" <br>is scarcely necessary and others are so inharmonic there is little point <br>as even drastic amounts of modulation do not really make much difference. <br> <br>ET		F		A		STD 	Un-MOD STD<br> <br>12		10		 0.132579	5.29859	12.05267	<br> <br>15		8		-0.240234 	4.69927	13.31584	<br> <br>17		10		 0.502893	5.53674	27.30851<br> <br>19		8		 0.1136078	0.48389	5.95502<br> <br>22		20		 0.1699097	2.94625	8.92950 <br> <br>24		10		 0.265158	5.29859	12.05267<br>		<br>31		18		 0.133739	1.467844 4.58336 <br> <br>A few caveats: the search program was somewhat sensitive to initial<br>conditions and although I set the acceptable summed error to be less <br>than 10 exp -7, even in double precision mode, I would not trust the<br>numbers past the 6th figure.

When<br>> you give only a "number of steps in an<br>> octave" and the number of steps between<br>> consecutive notes in the scale [as<br>> 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 for a standard major<br>> scale] you have something well-defined<br>> only in ET.<br><br>I wasn't aiming at them to be watertight definitions of scales. <br>Otherwise I could have listed them as such. To stay with your example,<br>you can have a major scale in many different tunings.<br>The utility of this notation is that it allows me to use it in<br>combination with a computer program and for instance <br><br>- have a mode-fitting algorithm operate on a given scale and look<br>if it's similar to a mode (of equal temperament) in the list,<br>- create a new scale from a mode by entering a different interval for <br>each amount of steps,<br>- select a subset from a given scale (not necessarily anyway near equal<br>temperament) using the mode name.<br><br>So rather than a set of exact scales it's meant to be an alternative<br>notation that can be employed for different purposes. I you have other <br>ideas I would be very interested to hear them.<br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 21 Jan 1996 23:51 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id OAA04266; Sun, 21 Jan 1996 14:51:23 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 21 Jan 1996 14:51:23 -0800<br>Message-Id:  <9601211447.aa10246@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
