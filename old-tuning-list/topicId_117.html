I believe these differential notes to be consciously produced<br>and considered as musically significant in Baka music. I even suspect the<br>melody formed by their succession to be the matrix of the polyphony -<br>different variations from the same patterns producing the same "virtual<br>bass line".<br><br>According to my measurements, the basic intervals used seem to be 7/6, or<br>267 cents (small minor third), 8/7, or 231 cents (large second), and 9/8,<br>or 204 cents (whole tone).<br><br>If intervals between degrees are determined by differential notes which can<br>change according to the musical context, the polyphony can produce<br>intervals very close from each other, but with a different function : 7/6 +<br>8/7 (498 cents, the perfect fourth) is only a few cents apart from 8/7 +<br>8/7 (462 cents) or 7/6 + 9/8 (471 cents); 7/6+7/6+8/7+8/7+9/8 (1200 cents,<br>the octave), from 7/6+8/7+8/7+8/7+9/8 (1164 cents), etc. This could explain<br>the often quoted presence of "major sevenths" in Pygmy polyphonies, which<br>have no place in a anhemitonic pentatonic scale.
