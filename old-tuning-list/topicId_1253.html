I have<br>studied with Paul Rapoport and James Tenney and done some of my own research.<br>I came into this as a guitar player who was always frustrated with the sound<br>of 12 tet. I've built a 19 tet guitar, a 50 stringed instrument (10 played,<br>40 sympathetic) with the Rankin fretboard system, a primitive electric cello,<br>retuned an accordion to 19tet and built a 12 foot long stringed instrument<br>for harmonics (with 8 strings it produces most of the Monophonic ratios). I<br>have played in a Gamelan group, played oud in an Arabic/Greek ensemble and a<br>Eastern European gypsy group. Lately 31tet has been my favourite. I have been<br>subscribing for a few months now but have been more concerned with<br>playing/writing/learning than replying. But what the heck, I do have two<br>things to add.<br><br>1)  Critical Band ( a group I am presently leading) is presenting a concert<br>Dec. 14, '96 at the Music Gallery, Toronto, Ont., Canada. On the bill will be<br>works by me, a selection of Partch's Li Po settings and works by Johnny<br>Reinhard (who is coming up for the concert) and by other members in the<br>group, Garnet Willis (instrument builder/composer) and Marc Sabat<br>(violin/adapted viola). We will be doing works in Just and 31 tet, maybe<br>other tunigs as well.<br><br>2) Reply to Daniel Wolf. I have built a few pickups, but don't know enough to<br>put out a pamphlet. However to make magnetic pickups all you need are<br>lacquered magnet wire (or speaker wire) a magnet and a bobbin. I've used #44 <br>wire(I think, I'll have to check on that) and a power drill on low speed to<br>wind the wire around a screw , then attached a strong magnet to it (which<br>magnetizes the screw). The pickups I made are low output and very small,<br>specific to an instrument of mine. I used somewhere around 5000-10000 winds,<br>but I think most guitar pickups use less. You could also contact<br>McDonald/Stewart (talk to a nearby music store with a repair department they<br>could show you catalogs) they stock a wide variety of pickups for different<br>instruments and one of them may be usable.<br>  <br><br>John Gzowski<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 26 Nov 1996 00:42 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07754; Tue, 26 Nov 1996 00:43:59 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07768<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id PAA10600; Mon, 25 Nov 1996 15:43:56 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 25 Nov 1996 15:43:56 -0800<br>Message-Id: <23961125222332/0005695065PK2EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Lurker Revealed</h1><h3><a id=4150 href="#4150">ðŸ”—</a>John_Gzowski@goodmedia.com (John Gzowski)</h3><span>11/25/1996 3:27:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Hello tuning enthusiasts<br><br>It sounded like the right time to join in the discussion, after the<br>invitation from Johnny Reinhard.<br>I am a performing musician/composer/instrument builder in Toronto.
