It doesn't<br>present any of those subtly but fascinatingly different sensations very clearly<br>to our ears.  So which sensation our ears will attribute to that chord is hard<br>to judge.  <br><br>   Marion's conclusion, again if I understood him correctly, is that that sort<br>of ambiguity complicates a systematic exploration.  We're all a lot better off<br>taking the simple, honest approach:  Just way exactly what we mean in the first<br>place - use the exact pitch relationship.  Perhaps later we can deal with the<br>effects of approximation.  <br><br>   That strikes me as a reasonable view.  But let me present another quite<br>different view.  <br><br>   That view is that when you play a B D F Ab diminished seventh chord in 12TET,<br>you ARE saying exactly what you mean.  If you present our ears with a stack of<br>ambiguous representations of 6:5, 7:6, or other minor third formulations, our<br>ears make no attempt to resolve the ambiguity.  I have no doubt at all that when<br>we present these sorts of interval distinction explicitly, our ears attribute<br>subtle meanings to them.  I also have no doubt that tuning systems that preserve<br>those distinctions are a very valuable area of musical pursuit.  But if you<br>avoid those distinctions, I don't see that our ears make a much effort to CREATE<br>them.  As far as I can tell our ears just view the intervals in that chord just<br>as a generic m3/A2 pitch relationship, without further detail.  Certainly I<br>doubt if we expend too much effort to create those distinctions over the course<br>of a fraction of the second that chords often sound in many realistic musical<br>applications.  <br><br>   And another factor is worth bearing in mind:  Our 12TET-oriented culture<br>presents the illusion that there are no such distinctions, such as between 6:5<br>and 7:6.  So the burden of proof, so to speak, is on us.  Our music has to<br>explicitly motivate its audience to make that distinction.  Certainly, as I<br>believe Marion is pointing out, that can be done more effectively in exact<br>representation rather than in equal-tempered approximation.  But I believe that<br>there is meaning to music that doesn't even attempt to make those distinctions.<br><br><br>   Meanwhile, there are certainly many clearly meaningful ways to group equal<br>temperaments for systematic exploration.  And these ambiguities are often at the<br>root of the meaningfulness of classifications.  For example, the "normal"<br>resolution of B D F Ab, is to have the B go up to C, the F go down the E, and<br>the Ab go down to G.  In the 1800s especially, a popular technique was to<br>suddenly reinterpret B D F Ab into B D F G#.  In that nomenclature the expected<br>resolution is to have the G# go up to an A, the D go down to a C#, and the F go<br>down to E.  This is one kind of "tritone substitution".  Because of the<br>nondistinct, ambiguous, equal distribution of the notes in that chord, you can<br>quickly but seamlessly - almost mysteriously - modulate from the key of C Major<br>to the somewhat remote key of A Major.  Or similarly to the much more remote key<br>of F# major.  <br><br>   Because of this ambiguity then, any equal-temperament of a multiple of four<br>steps per octave has the potential to be able to achieve this surprising and<br>musically useful effect.  And there are other useful bases for systematizing<br>equal temperaments, like multiples of five or seven, or tunings that have<br>traditional-sounding major scales, and so forth.  <br><br>   So, the distinction between whether just-intonation systems are easier to<br>systematically explore than equal-temperaments, probably boils down to what<br>sorts of musical effects you want to explore and thus interpret the results.  I<br>suppose that's not terribly surprising, is it?  If you're interested in<br>exploring the exciting distinctions between the septimal sensations of intervals<br>like 7:6 and 7:4 and their 5- or 11-limit counterparts, then you're best off<br>using those intervals in their most precise form.  But if you're interested in<br>exploring surprising contrapuntal effects that simplified, ambiguous<br>representations of chords make possible, then you're probably better off<br>thinking in terms of temperaments.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 23 Oct 1995 02:25 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id RAA01260; Sun, 22 Oct 1995 17:25:28 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 22 Oct 1995 17:25:28 -0700<br>Message-Id: <9510221827134@csst.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>JI vs. ET for Ease of Exploration</h1><h3><a id=2183 href="#2183">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/1995 2:58:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Marion wrote a very thoughtful reply to my question of why he finds just<br>intonation systems easier to explore systematically than equal-temperaments.
