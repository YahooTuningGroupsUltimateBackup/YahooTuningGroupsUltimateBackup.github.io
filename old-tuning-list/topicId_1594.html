I try as best I can to <br>follow the discussions on here, but I'm sad to state that it's all <br>entirely over my head.  I have been playing piano and guitar for quite a <br>few years now, and am interested in broadening my playing scope, which is <br>why I subscribed to this list originally.  Unfortunately, the discussions <br>are aimed more towards the advanced, seasoned composer, and leave very <br>little room for beginners who want to learn about this seemingly <br>interesting side of music composition (note this is not a criticism, <br>rather my perception of the goings-on). <br><br>I'm wondering if any of the list members would be able to give me a <br>slight introduction to the discussions of just intonation, microtonality, <br>etc., or perhaps a pointer to a web site or other resource where I could <br>learn more about this.  It would probably be best to e-mail me privately, <br>so as not to disturb the discussions on the list.  <br><br>I'm very excited to hear from someone who can basically get my feet wet <br>in this field.  I'm not asking for a semester-long course on the subject, <br>which I'm sure no one has the time for, rather some sort of introduction <br>that would help me understand these concepts.  Perhaps by showing <br>comparisons to more basic musical theory that I would be familiar with <br>could be a start.  <br><br>Anyway, if there's anyone on this list that would be gracious enough to <br>give me a little hand in the matter, please send me an e-mail.  I know <br>it's probably a long way off for me, but I'd love to contribute to the <br>discussions on here, as I am and always have been an extraordinary lover <br>of music.<br><br>Thank you for your time.<br>-Marc<br> <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 24 Jan 1997 04:58 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13615; Fri, 24 Jan 1997 04:58:12 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13652<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id TAA16662; Thu, 23 Jan 1997 19:58:08 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 23 Jan 1997 19:58:08 -0800<br>Message-Id: <32E84092.732A@interlinx.qc.ca><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Greetings to all</h1><h3><a id=4673 href="#4673">ðŸ”—</a>Marc Holbert &#x3C;holberm1@alpha.lasalle.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/1997 4:25:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Greetings to all on this list.<br><br>This is--rather obviously--my first post to this list, to which I've been <br>subscribed off and on for a few months now.
