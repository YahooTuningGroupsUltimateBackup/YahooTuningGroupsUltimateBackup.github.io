In his paper "The Uses<br>and Characteristics of Non-Just Non-Equal-Tempered Scales,"<br>1993. XH15:27-41, he generates one class of such scales <br>by taking a number (e, pi, etc.) converting it to cents<br>(1200*log(N)/log(2)) and sequentially dividing the cent<br>values by the original number. If pi is chosen, the initial<br>value is approximately 1982 cents, then 631, 201, etc. as each <br>term is divided by pi. He did not consider more than one such<br>cycle, that is adding multiples of 1982 to these numbers.<br><br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 22 Jun 1996 20:24 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA00357; Sat, 22 Jun 1996 11:24:49 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 22 Jun 1996 11:24:49 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960622112214.10122A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3108 href="#3108">ðŸ”—</a>jpff@maths.bath.ac.uk</h3><span>6/25/1996 2:23:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Message written at 24 Jun 1996 20:41:14 +0100<br>In-reply-to: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960623093101.10610B-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>	(message from John Chalmers on Sun, 23 Jun 1996 09:35:05 -0700)<br><br>May I ask a naive question about Ives' "Universe Symphony"?
