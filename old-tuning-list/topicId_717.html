Hiller was a chemist<br>by trade: apparently  Markov analysis is sometimes <br>applied to  the study of chemical reactions.  It is<br>essentially a rule-based random number sieve.<br>Markov analysis can be applied to note-groups<br>of zero length (zeoth-order analysis), length 1<br>(first-order analysis), length 2 (second-order<br>analysis), etc. Statistical analysis of a composition<br>as a first-order Markov process establishes the<br>probability of a given note following another<br>note-- for instance the probability that C will<br>follow D.  A first-order analysis can be run for<br>each of the 12 pitch-classes of 12-TET music,<br>giving a list of probabilities derived from an input <br>composition (or group of compositions).  However,<br>such analyses could just as easily be run for a non-12<br>set of notes--31-TET, 15-TET, Partch 43-note JI,<br>and so on.  Analyzing the composition as a second-<br>order Markov process establishes the probability<br>of a given note following two given previous notes;<br>a third-order Markov analysis yields the probability<br>of a given note following three previous notes--<br>and so on.<br>Thus "the process of composition consisted in<br>sequentially applying each random number generated<br>to the appropriate sets of rules.

At shorter time-scales the music sounds<br>like sample-and-hold white noise, while at longer<br>time-scales it sounds like a random bricolage of<br>precomposed sections.<br>Essentially the Markov analysis reduces the<br>generation of musical notes & phrases to a single<br>probability 0< x<1 plus a rule-set.  Thus, Markov <br>composition represents yet another example of the 20th<br>century's love of extreme reductionism.  In<br>this case, the conceit is that a musical composition<br>can be reduced to a set of unsigned probabilities<br>between 0 and 1 mated with some modus ponens<br>logic tree.<br>If this sounds ridiculous...well, so do many of the<br>ideas that have proven popular in the 20th century.<br>If someone told you that the world's 2 great <br>superpowers would go hog-wild for a nutty theory<br>known as "mutual assured destruction," damn near<br>bankrupt themselves building enough nuclear weapons <br>to vaporize the biophere and then tear all those bombs <br>apart and throw 'em out because they they finally <br>realized it was a terminally stupid idea to begin<br>with...well, hey--<br>Welcome to the 20th century, folks!<br>Markov analysis basically establishes the size of the<br>sieve through which random numbers will pass,<br>given some rule-set (i.e., the rule that if notes<br>X, Y, Z...U, V have already occurred, there is a<br>probability Q that note W will occur subsequently.)<br>The advantage of Markov compositional<br>processes is that [A] they can be scaled<br>up to the size of the entire composition (in<br>which case there's a finite probability that<br>the entire piece of music will occur) or down<br>to the level of the individual note.  Thus,<br>unlike many other compositional algorithms,<br>Markov analysis gives the composer some control<br>over the specific time-scale at which s/he works; <br>[B] Markov analyses of two radically different<br>musical styles of composition can be used<br>to "morph" from one compositional style<br>to the next, producing striking effects;<br>abnd [C] Markov analyses can prove useful in<br>dating and authenticating compositions by<br>generating a set of note and phrase probabilities<br>unique to each composer.<br>The disadvantages of Markov compositional<br>algorithms are [A] the process does not even<br>remotely model a composer's cognitive <br>functions;  I know of no composer who sets<br>up a bunch of predetermined rules and then<br>flips coins to see whether a note is  generated.  <br>(Well--no worthwhile composer.  There's always<br>Cage, of course.) This is so alien to the way humans<br>compose that it's bound to produce musically<br>unsatisfactory results; [B] The Markov algorithms<br>remove control of all but continuous "chunks"<br>from the composer.  To use an inapprropriate <br>term, Markov composition isn't random access--<br>its strictly sequential.  The Markov composer<br>never knows what's in measure 12 if it's<br>on measure 2. In the real world, a composer<br>will typically start by deciding what form<br>s/he will use--rondo, variations, canon, <br>etc.  Markov methods make it impossible for<br>the composer to control this highest level of<br>compositional order.  At the other extreme,<br>human composers will typically jump back and <br>forth in time, composing the end of piece<br>before the middle, making sketches, inserting <br>"extraneous" notes in themes or passages or<br>chord progressions--yet the theme or passage<br>or chord progression remains to listeners recog-<br>nizably thematic.  Markov processes are very brittle <br>in this regard.  Toss in one extraneous note, <br>require the analysis to jump discontinuously <br>in time from begining to end or vice versa and<br>the rule-set breaks and the Markov analysis<br>apart.  In particular, Markov processes cannot<br>handle or model a method of composition in which<br>the composer jumps discontinuosuly between<br>various points in time, forward then back,<br>&c. This is violently contradictory to both<br>human perception of music (we instantly jump back<br>in time via memory to the first appearance of<br>a theme the second time we hear it), and to the way<br>human composers handle themes and chord<br>progressions.  The final problem is that [D]<br>because Markov analysis operates only with<br>pitch classes, Markov analysis is completely<br>blind to the contour of a melody--yet this is<br>clearly the most important characteristic<br>of any melody.  Markov analysis is also utter<br>blind to the "orchestration" of a chord and<br>to the "contour" of the bass progression<br>of the set of chords used--thus Markov analysis<br>destroys the information of where the chord's <br>component notes are  distributed in the frequency <br>spectrum, and the specific melodic contour of<br>the bass note in those chords.  Now,  Stravinsky<br>clearly thought of one orchestration of a chord as <br>actually a different chord than another orchestration--<br>thus he typically said "I was glad to discover that<br>chord" when speaking of the Firebird.  Many composers<br>think this way.  But Markov analysis destroys this<br>information.<br>This is another way in which Markov<br>procedures are violently antithetical to the way<br>humans think about composition.<br>It's worth noting that the Markov algorithm is<br>the earliest compositional method used on <br>an actual computer.

Instead, Hiller <br>described his efforts as attempts to probe<br>the cognitive processes of the human mind.<br>The idea (a typcally grandiose early computer<br>dream) was that by modelling human music<br>composition, a series of computer programs<br>would gradually illuminate the process of<br>human musical thought to a greater and<br>greater degree, until finally the process<br>of composition as a mental activity was<br>fully understood.  At that point (it was fondly<br>imagined back in 1956) computer programs<br>could take over and produce music even<br>more interesting, even more inspiring, and<br>even more exotic and beautiful than any <br>human.<br>Typically, just the opposite has actually<br>happened.<br>Instead of illuminating the operation of<br>the human mind, computer composition<br>has pointed up how complex and imponderable<br>human compositional thought actually is.<br>Thus, what has actually happened with<br>computer composition is that a series of<br>musically godawful results inspired researchers<br>to grab a ragbag of mathematical procedures willy-<br>willy from other disciplines and press 'em into <br>service as compositional algorithms.  All of these<br>algorithms have so far *reduced* the composer's<br>control over one or another vital aspect of the <br>musical composition, rather than enhancing it.<br>The net result has typically been a series<br>of computer compositions about which as Max<br>Mathews remarked "the music tends to wander,<br>and with it the listener's attention."<br>--<br>What does all this have to do with non-12<br>tunings?<br>Because Max Mathews' Music V acoustic<br>compiler and its descendents allow<br>total freedom to choose pitches, <br>xenharmonic composers face what Wendy<br>Carlos calls "option paralysis."

It's<br>inherently attractive to let a computer<br>handle all the Dedalaean complexities<br>proferred by all those notes--thus one<br>might well understand why a composer<br>would prefer to have a computer handle<br>composition (or some aspect of composition,<br>such as, say, chordal accompaniment, or<br>melodic episodes) in 53 tones or 171<br>tones per octave.<br>--<br>Future generations will look back with wonder<br>and astonishment at the peculiarly 20th-century<br>conceit that computers could generate music<br>even remotely as interesting as a composition<br>written by a human.<br>People used to drink coal tar in the 1870s as a <br>cancer cure because there was a lot of coal<br>tar around, the oil business was glamorous, and<br>nobody could think of much else to do with coal<br>tar.  A lot of composers probably use computers<br>to make music nowadays for the same reason--<br>there are a lot of computers around, anything <br>connected with computers is automatically<br>glamorous and hi-tech, and the composers likely<br>can't think of anything better to do with their<br>PCs. <br>Thus algorithmic composition is fashionably<br>trendy nowadays, very chic, and highly "in,"<br>and it's yet another example of the kind of<br>musical tulipomania that has periodically deluded<br>groups of otherwise sane composers since 1948:<br>row-based serialism, pitch-class matrix methods,<br>aleatoric composition, neo-dadaism, and so on.<br>Algorithmic composition may well be another fad,<br>like the miniskirts of the 60s and the men's <br>platform shoes of the 70s. <br>Time will tell.<br>Because computer algorithms never permit the<br>composer to simultaneously control  large<br>and small time-scales of the composition,<br>and systematically prevent composers from<br>assigning emotional values to sets of chords<br>or notes, algorithmic computer composition has<br>never produced much music worth listening to.<br>Typical computer compositions fade in from nowhere<br> and fade out after some indetermine length of time,<br>giving the impression of sonic wallpaper.  Algorithmic<br>compositions can work very effectively as background<br>music, however.<br>The net musical result is generally a very low-quality <br>Muzak, or a particularly dull & repetitive kind of <br>fusion jazz.  This applies with especial<br>force to Tod Machover's computer-generated<br>hyperinstrument noodlingsm, although the problem<br>is endemic through the computer composition<br>field.<br>Why spend so many millions of man-hours and so<br>many trillions of CPU cycles to generate sub-par<br>Muzak and boring fusion jazz?  Well...why did so<br>many composers spend so many millions of<br>man-hours composing row-based serial music<br>in the 1940s and 1950s? As Charles Mackay<br>pointed out in his classic book "Extraordinary<br>Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds"<br>(1843): "Men, it has been said, think in herds,<br>and they go mad in herds, while they only<br>recover their senses slowly, and one by one."<br>The essential problem is one of mapping.  All<br>computer composition programs either sieve (from<br>the top down) or generate (from the bottom up) <br>random noise, then assign values to that subset<br>of random noise.  In the case of Markov-type and<br>other top-down noise-sieve algorithms, the mapping<br>is determined by the rule-set pre-entered by the<br>composer.  In the case of cellular automata and<br>MAX-type recursive shift-register  algorithms,<br>the mapping is out of the composer's control and<br>is determined by the emergent order of<br>the cellular automaton or that paritcular<br> topology of feedback shift register.<br>In both cases, the essential problem (other than the<br>fact that composer loses control over either the<br>very large or the very small time-scale in<br>a piece of music) is that no one has yet determined<br>how to meaningfully map a chord or note to an<br>emotional affect.  Thus the mappings have to date<br>been extra-musical and the results thus trivial.<br>There is no sign that the mapping problem will be<br>solved any time soon, since the same chord or note<br>can have *many* different emotional affects <br>depending on its context.  To determine what emotional<br>impact a chord or note will have, you have to *listen.*<br>And this, computers can't do. Lejaren Hiller addressed<br>this concern in his 1957 book "Experimental Music:"<br>"The composer is traditionally thought of as guided in<br>his choices not only by certain technical rules but<br>also by his `aural sensibility,' while the computer<br>would be dependent entirely upon a rationalization<br>and codification of the `aural sensibility.'"

In the case of cellular automata and<br>MAX-type recursive shift-register  algorithms,<br>the mapping is out of the composer's control and<br>is determined by the emergent order of<br>the cellular automaton or that paritcular<br> topology of feedback shift register.<br>In both cases, the essential problem (other than the<br>fact that composer loses control over either the<br>very large or the very small time-scale in<br>a piece of music) is that no one has yet determined<br>how to meaningfully map a chord or note to an<br>emotional affect.  Thus the mappings have to date<br>been extra-musical and the results thus trivial.<br>There is no sign that the mapping problem will be<br>solved any time soon, since the same chord or note<br>can have *many* different emotional affects <br>depending on its context.  To determine what emotional<br>impact a chord or note will have, you have to *listen.*<br>And this, computers can't do. Lejaren Hiller addressed<br>this concern in his 1957 book "Experimental Music:"<br>"The composer is traditionally thought of as guided in<br>his choices not only by certain technical rules but<br>also by his `aural sensibility,' while the computer<br>would be dependent entirely upon a rationalization<br>and codification of the `aural sensibility.'" [Hiller, L.,<br>Experimental Music," 1957]  To date, no such <br>rationalization and codification has proven <br>musically successful.<br>--mclaren<br><br> <br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 9 Aug 1996 21:06 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05065; Fri, 9 Aug 1996 21:06:38 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05062<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA12890; Fri, 9 Aug 1996 12:06:36 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 9 Aug 1996 12:06:36 -0700<br>Message-Id: <009A69BF00630380.055B@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
