They sound<br>> akin to some of the more sophisticated timbres that<br>> can be produced with an anlog synthesizer, but more<br>> ethereal and in some cases more "digital-sounding" than<br>> standard analog timbres.  In other cases, particularly<br>> the fractal waveforms, Dudon conjures up timbres whose<br>> only close relatives are timbres generated by elaborate<br>> computer algorithms.<br>> Jacques favors a tuning system which makes his pieces<br>> sound middle eastern; he also uses drones, drum-like<br>> timbres, and repeated tabla-type patterns generated from<br>> interfering and cross-rhythmed slowly rotating glass<br>> disks. (Dudon apparently uses some disks as "sequencer<br>> disks" at a slow rate of rotation, and other disks as<br>> "timbral" disks rotating much faster.  By using 6 or<br>> 7 different photodiodes and rotating disks, along<br>> with volume pedals to switch between the different<br>> timbres/sequences, Dudon can produce sonic tapestries<br>> of remarkable subtlety and sophistication.)<br>> For more about Dudon's just intonation tunings, see<br>> the 1/1 article "7 Limit Slendro Mutations," Vol. 8,<br>> No. 2, 1994.<br>> This CD is *highly* recommended.<br>> You can order one of these CDs from Jacques Dudon<br>> at Atelier d'Exploration Harmonique - les Camails,<br>> 83.340 LE THORONET - phone number 94.73.87.78<br>> --mclaren<br>> <br>> ------------------------------<br>> <br>> Topic No. 2<br>> <br>> Date: Sat, 15 Jun 1996 11:46:34 -0600 (MDT)<br>> From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>> To: tuning<br>> Subject: Re: TUNING digest 750<br>> Message-ID: <Pine.A32.3.91.960615113239.31867A-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>> <br>> Ladies and Gentlemen-<br>>         Yes it is true that the dyes are photosensitive, and will degrade<br>> in direct sunlight, but with proper care they should last between 50 and<br>> 100 years (according to manufacturer's accelerated aging tests).
