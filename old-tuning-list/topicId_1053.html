Thus, within the key of C, for example,<br>> Johnston*s fifths C/G and D/A are not both 3/2 intervals. Moreover,<br>> Johnston*s notation obviates the fact that the conventional staff notation<br>> is a perfectly natural vehicle for Pythagorean intervals.<br><br>Ben prefers a 5-limit syntonon diatonic default for two reasons, I think: he <br>chose to explore the 5-limit thoroughly before moving on gradually to higher <br>primes, so he devised his notation initially within a 5-limit environment, <br>while perfectly aware that it was extendable. Since these 1960s <br>"hyper-chromatic" works form the most "atonal" (faute de mieux) portion of <br>his oeuvre, the syntonon diatonic itself is not of importance on the aural <br>surface of the music, but it provided the 5-limit default he wanted. In <br>later works, especially from the neo-classical phase of the last ten years, <br>the syntonon diatonic is all the more clearly worth preserving as a default. <br>I would imagine also that Ben believes, like Zarlino, that the syntonon <br>diatonic is the ideal representation of the major scale/Ionian mode, towards <br>which singers at least will aim if unhampered by intonational distractions <br>from accompanying instruments (I would endorse this).<br><br>Ben absolutizes his notation in two ways: A = 440 is observed, even though <br>A+ = 440 would often remove the need for a great many plus and minus signs <br>from his scores; secondly, if I understand correctly, C is fixed as an <br>arbitrary 1/1 for notational purposes, regardless of the tonal centre of a <br>passage (if any).<br><br>Adam Silverman (or any other friends of Ben) is welcome to correct me if any <br>of the above details sound dubious or plain incorrect.<br><br>For my own theoretical purposes I remove these two anchors, and relativise <br>the system completely; since I'm dealing with modal or tonal music, 1/1 is <br>be identified with whichever letter-name is the modal final or tonal centre. <br>I would use a syntonon diatonic default for pieces dating from the late Ars <br>Nova or afterwards; earlier Ars Nova pieces have to be considered on their <br>merits with regard to their suitability for just or Pythagorean intonation; <br>Ars Antiqua I give a 3-limit default. In 5-limit Renaissance a capella <br>music, a further licence is the gradual sinking of the 1/1 pitch (which need <br>not happen quite so frequently as is usually maintained for JI <br>performances).<br><br>The notation can also be extended for the description of tempered systems <br>which are derived from the 5-limit, such as the meantone family of tunings; <br>other temperaments, such as certain 18th-century irregular temperaments (and <br>of course 12-TET) are better suited to a 3-limit default. The choice depends <br>on whether roots of the syntonic or the Pythagorean comma are employed in <br>the construction of the temperament; some tunings, such as Kirnberger II, <br>are ambiguous in this respect, and can be described in two ways. <br>Furthermore, aurally near-identical tunings will receive different <br>descriptions if their derivations are different: for instance 1/10-comma <br>meantone and 12-TET are extremely close approximations of each other, but <br>the former is properly describable in terms of (81/80)^(x/10) deviations <br>from the syntonon diatonic, while the latter is most certainly not.<br><br>Daniel Wolf again:<br> <br>> In very microtonal passages, pitch height may not match notational height. <br>> I have decided to accept this point in lieu of going to a further step and <br>> using a notation with  more than seven nominals, such as the <br>> twelve-nominal notation proposed by Wilson in Xenharmonikon.<br><br>Funny you should mention this, because one of the virtues of a 5-limit <br>notational default is that pitch height _will_ correspond to notational <br>height for much, much longer than a 3-limit default. This is a fairly big <br>gain to offset your objection to the contextualisation of interval sizes in <br>5-limit default notation. Still, I'm not determined, as I said above, to <br>defend a 5-limit default where it conflicts with the style of the music, or <br>with the derivation of a tuning system. Which brings us on to your next <br>point:<br><br>> I am not particularly attached to my notation but I do find it curious <br>> that so many people have made transcriptions of Partch scores in <br>> Johnston*s notation which goes against both the whole limit (factoring) <br>> idea of Partch, and Partch*s decided invertibility. Moreover, the <br>> instances in Partch*s music which are based upon the syntonic diatonic <br>> scale are minimal.<br><br>Adam Silverman will no doubt defend himself capably here, but I could make a <br>couple of comments. Ben's notation, like his music, quite deliberately works <br>within, and extends the very tradition that Partch largely spurned. The <br>staff notation used in that tradition was designed from the beginning for <br>vocal performers who, of necessity, had to be able to conceptualise the <br>sound in advance, in order to perform; instrumental performers were happy <br>with tablatures for centuries until these systems faded away for various <br>reasons in the 18th century. Since Partch concentrated heavily on <br>fixed-pitch instruments, he was at liberty to use tablatures, or otherwise <br>depart from the notational norm that he grew up with. The important use of <br>voices and strings in Ben's works, together with his desire to work within <br>that tradition renders his notation the best suited to his purposes.<br><br>Does it suit Partch though? This is one corner of the "authentic Partch" <br>debate, which I'd prefer not to enter (although I'll remind readers that if <br>we had always followed artists wishes, the Canterbury Tales and much of <br>Kafka's work would have been destroyed, to take two examples from a great <br>many -- and is recording really consistent with corporeality?). <br>Nevertheless, for those used to Ben's notation, the transcription of <br>Partch's scores offers considerable analytical leverage; it's not in every <br>case a plot to have performances on non-Partchian instruments. I can't see <br>that a 5-limit default creates any great obstacle to our understanding of <br>Partch, any more than a 3-limit default would -- if you're most familiar <br>with the former, and you haven't a pair of 5-limit tinted spectacles glued <br>to your face, what's the problem?<br><br>Daniel, since I'm not entirely sure I understand "Johnston's notation ... <br>goes against both the whole limit (factoring) idea of Partch, and Partch's <br>decided invertibility", could you please expand on this, so that I can be <br>certain of your objections?
