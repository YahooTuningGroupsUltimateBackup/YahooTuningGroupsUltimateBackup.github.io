His<br>_Ten_ is in 74ET and is 30 minutes long for 10 players and it sounds like<br>NYC traffic.  More specifically to your question: Kyle Gann is a<br>microtonalist critic for The Village Voice and regularly supports and<br>encourages tiny tone touching.  John Schaefer is station manager of WNYC<br>the now-independent important radio station with the award winning New<br>Sounds show, which he hosts and sends off to NPR...and a microtonal music<br>enthusiast.  WKCR has always had microtonal emphasis since my<br>involvement in 1981 and that of other key people (Frank Oteri, Charles<br>Passy, etc.)  The New York Times regularly features positive reviews about<br>microtonal groups and events (I blush at the exposure) and recall the<br>moving on of microtonal ethusiast critic Robert Palmer.  And there are<br>others like Roulette (run by microtonal composer David Weinstein), the<br>Kitchen (run by music curator and microtonalist Ben Neill), or<br>microtonalist Phill Niblock's series.

I'm sorry to<br>hear that things have fallen into a shabby state in San Diego.<br>Incidentally, Ivor Darreg was a one-man-institution if there ever was one<br>in San Diego and it is due to his Xenharmonicon that much of tuning theory<br>and early obscure writers on the subject from other lands first received<br>American exposure.<br><br><br>> >Time to stopping looking into the books and smell the coffee.

I could agree that the BB's choral<br>> harmonies were probably altered to be more in tune -- but what about the<br>> Farfiza/Vox/Other organs that they were playing (and gtrs, etc.)? Don't<br>> tell me Whitney has explicitly equipped her bands with Ensoniq gear, tuned<br>> to some slendro scale!<br><br>So many exclamations above.  Please don't reduce what I am saying to<br>farce.  While one always tunes to the instrument present that is most<br>inflexible to pitch, singers and wind players and fretless players are<br>never obliged to play only those set "ghetto" pitches.  Even slendro<br>allows for extra notes to its basic 5!  The piano is a 19th century<br>instrument, after all.<br><br>As a bassoonist playing regularly to Pink Floyd, I normally used just<br>thirds in order to harmonize along.  This is quite recognizeable to me<br>since I need to used my "special" fingerings in order to be in tune.<br>Miles Davis recordings likewise use microtones throughout, but usually<br>from a modal perspective where different fingerings are utilized.<br><br>I guess your reactions mean that you accept the microtonality of Odetta<br>(she does) or of Louis Armstrong (analyzed microtonally by Ezra Sims) or<br>Albert King (known for his emphasis of the 13th harmonic).  How about the<br>comma in the melody of Sinead O'Connor's Compare?<br><br><br>> >Globalization of world music brings in the microtonal musics of Bulgaria,<br>> >Egypt, India, Indonesia, et al.<br>><br>> Sure does, and I love it. Notice how much it changed Michael Bolton, Kenny<br>> G. and Aerosmith? Not to mention the Spice Girls...<br><br>I believe there a smile on your face, Jon when you say much of this, only<br>because of past exchanges.  Michael Bolton sings his share of microtones.<br>Kenny G plays them.  Maybe there's more in others yet unmentioned.  The<br>important thing here -- at least to me -- is that there is a soup of<br>interval useage out there in the real world of music, and that includes<br>pop.  (See a new article in an upcoming Whole Earth Magazine issue on<br>microtonal music mainstreaming of my authorship...and they called me!)<br><br>> >The pedigree of Charles Ives for theory, intentioin, and compositions<br>> >leads to microtone useage by composers Aaron Copland, Bela Bartok, Pierre<br>> >Boulez, Gyorgy Liggeti, Krzysztof Penderecki, et al.<br>><br><br>Pop musicians use the history of music as a jumping off point to further<br>reaches and even legitimitization of techniques.  The above gentleman<br>helped secure the use of microtones.  Didn't you know that the Grateful<br>Dead listened to Ives #4 before each live performance during an entire<br>year?  Or that they were financial supporters to the premiere of the Ives<br>Universe Symphony?<br><br><br>> Aaron Copland, microtonalist? Wow. That's like saying "Harry Partch,<br>> champion body-surfer"!<br><br>Copland used quartertones in some of his music and is thus listed in<br>numerous reference books.  These works include Dance Symphony, Ukele<br>Serenade, and Vitebsk.  The Copland Performance Fund has been a supporter<br>of the AFMM since its inception several years back, incidentally.<br><br><br>> >Right now in New York, microtones are mainstream.<br>><br>> We are talking about the occurring sounds emanating from the squeals of<br>> taxi brakes, no? (Wait, they use their horns, not their brakes...).  Being<br>> an out-of-towner, I can only keep up by reading the concert schedule in the<br>> "New Yorker", and the occaisional Village Voice. Nope -- looks like pretty<br>> much the old guard is still in charge. Please let us know (other than the<br>> AFMM festival and the odd Newband concerts) what constitutes "mainstream".<br><br>The almost pop John Cage loved the sounds you are teasing about.  His<br>_Ten_ is in 74ET and is 30 minutes long for 10 players and it sounds like<br>NYC traffic.  More specifically to your question: Kyle Gann is a<br>microtonalist critic for The Village Voice and regularly supports and<br>encourages tiny tone touching.  John Schaefer is station manager of WNYC<br>the now-independent important radio station with the award winning New<br>Sounds show, which he hosts and sends off to NPR...and a microtonal music<br>enthusiast.  WKCR has always had microtonal emphasis since my<br>involvement in 1981 and that of other key people (Frank Oteri, Charles<br>Passy, etc.)  The New York Times regularly features positive reviews about<br>microtonal groups and events (I blush at the exposure) and recall the<br>moving on of microtonal ethusiast critic Robert Palmer.  And there are<br>others like Roulette (run by microtonal composer David Weinstein), the<br>Kitchen (run by music curator and microtonalist Ben Neill), or<br>microtonalist Phill Niblock's series.  These people have been in place way<br>over a decade.<br><br>> >Denver, Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and other cities<br>> >provide microtonal institutions.<br>><br>> I will speak only to the middle one: hogwash. There is no microtonal<br>> institution here in San Diego, at least one that has *any* consequence on<br>> the populace of the locality, much less a wider influence. If you mean the<br>> Interval Foundation (if that is the name of Jonathan Glasier's<br>> group/coalition), then I respectfully report that it is in name only: I<br>> have seen just one concert, quite a few months back, there is no<br>> 'institution', and the quality of the music-making is not sufficiently<br>> breath-taking.<br><br>The name Harry Partch is etched in many minds as having been an<br>institution of San Diego.  How it is manifested since is another issue.<br>Interval, however, was very important for over a decade in providing<br>valuable information on microtonal music for over a decade.  I'm sorry to<br>hear that things have fallen into a shabby state in San Diego.<br>Incidentally, Ivor Darreg was a one-man-institution if there ever was one<br>in San Diego and it is due to his Xenharmonicon that much of tuning theory<br>and early obscure writers on the subject from other lands first received<br>American exposure.<br><br><br>> >Time to stopping looking into the books and smell the coffee.
