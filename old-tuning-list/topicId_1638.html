I just read an amazing<br>thing, I think in IEEE SPECTRUM, an engineering magazine. There's this new<br>kind of loudspeaker that's been invented. It's based on the fact that air is<br>a non-linear acoustic medium. Non-linear means that air isn't a perfect<br>spring, as you squeeze air it doesn't resist in exact proportion to how much<br>you squeeze. So the new loudspeaker takes advantage of this. It's composed<br>of two ultrasonic loudspeakers that each emit sound up around 200 KHz. Dogs<br>etc. can't hear way up there either. For all I know these may be the best<br>way to eliminate cockroaches! Anyway, the two ultrasonic speakers actually<br>play at somewhat different frequencies - for example, suppose one played at<br>200 KHz and the other at 201 KHz. What happens, when two oscillating forces<br>hit a nonlinear medium, is that new oscillations get induced at the sum and<br>difference frequencies. So new oscillations appear at 401 KHz and 1 KHz. Of<br>course 401 KHz is inaudible. But the 1 KHz... hey, where'd that sound come<br>from! <br><br>The IEEE Spectrum mentioned as I recall that Carver is involved in producing<br>a product based on this new invention.<br><br>Anyway, if you start with two frequencies and start taking sums and<br>differences:<br><br>a, b, a+b, a-b, a+2b, 2a-b, 2a+2b, 2a, 2b, 3a+b, etc.<br><br>somehow amazingly integers pop up. Now I'm not particularly enamoured of the<br>creationist view of the world, but I'll follow Haverstick at least to the<br>point that it looks like the integers are just somehow the way things are.<br><br>The ear itself is undoubtedly non-linear. I imagine that's why we can hear<br>"beat frequencies". <br><br>Anyway, my whole point is that just intonation need not be founded on the<br>frequencies of modes of oscillation of a string. Personally I don't think you<br>can find secure foundations for any conceptual system, though even insecure<br>foundations can be quite useful. The best foundation for just intonation,<br>seems to me, is just the way various pitch combinations sound to us<br>humans. Of course, our perception is also shaped by the conceptual systems<br>that have been used to construct our environment. But anyway if you look for<br>why humans might like simple ratios of frequencies, there are more answers<br>around than just strings.<br><br>Jim Kukula<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 8 Feb 1997 00:22 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29580; Sat, 8 Feb 1997 00:22:51 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29479<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id PAA00099; Fri, 7 Feb 1997 15:20:54 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 7 Feb 1997 15:20:54 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01510110af216906af77@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4746 href="#4746">ðŸ”—</a>Matt Nathan &#x3C;mattn@ix.netcom.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/1997 5:36:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Bill Alves wrote:<br><br>> However, if you're using a tuning system that does not replicate any<br>> particular interval, how do you specify pitches?

Do you just pick one pitch as the <br>> starting point and number them?  That seems rather awkward.<br><br>   Well, Bill posed that question in a very general way, but certainly not<br>an inappropriate way.  I'll suggest though that a better way to approach it<br>is to assume that you'll devise some sort of organization for the tuning. <br>Without some sort of organizational principle, it's chaos.  You have no<br>framework in which to compose.  <br><br>   Some would suggest that establishing a framework or underlying<br>organization is too restrictive for the freedom needed to compose<br>innovative new music.  I personally find the alternative too difficult a<br>nut to crack - there are too many possibilities for creativity to flourish.<br> I find that I have to break the problem down to something simpler before I<br>can get anything done.  <br><br>   So, generally speaking, I recommend organizing the notes not into spans<br>of octaves but into spans of something else.  For example, in the case of<br>88CET or Carlos' Alpha (78CET), you have good approximations to a 3:2 P5. <br>So, you in either of those tunings, you can organize their pitches into<br>patterns that repeat in fifths.  <br><br>   Were I working (so far I haven't yet) with my viola in 88CET, I would<br>almost certainly build music from the scale pattern 2 1 2 2 1 (i.e.,<br>whole-step, half-step, whole-step...) repeating in fifths.  That's very<br>convenient on the viola or violin since their open strings are fifths<br>apart.  (It's a little trickier on a 'cello since you run out of fingers.)<br><br>   But for most of my work, I instead organize 88CET pitches by a "cycle"<br>of perfect fifths wrapping within a subminor seventh (7:4 approximation). <br>That works out to a seven-step-per-cycle scale with the pattern 2 1 2 2 1 2<br>1, and I give them traditional letter names, in this case A B C D E F G A. <br>Any note and the next higher or lower tone of the same note name is a<br>subminor seventh apart rather than an octave apart.  There's an<br>inconvenience that G-A is a half-step, but I learned my way around it<br>pretty quickly.  I simply omit the G#/Ab key from the system.  <br><br>   After you do that, you have a complete system of pseudokeys and<br>pseudokey signatures.  Fifths look like what we normally think of as<br>sixths, so sharps add in the order of C# A# F# D# B#..., and flats add in<br>the order of Eb, Gb, Bb, Db, Fb...  So some of the pseudokeys work out to:<br><br>Gb: Gb A  Bb C  D  Eb F  Gb<br>Eb: Eb F  Gb A  B  C  D  Eb<br>C:  C  D  Eb F  G  A  B  C<br>A:  A  B  C  D  E  F  G  A<br>F:  F  G  A  B  C# D  E  F<br>D:  D  E  F  G  A# B  C# D<br>B:  B  C# D  E  F# G  A# B<br><br>   From that point you learn things analogously with how you'd learn things<br>in an octave-based tuning (pretty much rote but with auditory reinforcement<br>and memory), for example:<br>Intervals:  <br>   - Subminor third (~7:6) above the root is the third step in the scale,<br>   - Supramajor third (~9:7) is the fourth step in the scale,<br>   - The perfect fifth is the sixth step in the scale,<br>   - The major tenth is the fifth step in the second cycle of the scale,<br>etc.<br>Chords:<br>   - A supramajor third-stack triad is scale steps 1, 4, and 7.<br>   - A harmonic-series fragment (4:6:7:9:10:11:15) approximation can be<br>found <br>     at scale steps <br>     First cycle:  1, 6, <br>     Second cycle: 1, 4, 5, #6, <br>     Third cycle:  #3.  <br><br>   It becomes its own new world of its own with all new nomenclature,<br>possibly new notation, new harmony rules, and such.  But once you get to<br>know it, it makes as much sense as the traditional system.  In some cases<br>it's a similar kind of sense, and others it's a very different kind of<br>logic.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 8 Feb 1997 06:23 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29649; Sat, 8 Feb 1997 06:23:36 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29702<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id VAA15686; Fri, 7 Feb 1997 21:22:03 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 7 Feb 1997 21:22:03 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199702080015_MC2-10FE-B3F4@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4756 href="#4756">ðŸ”—</a>Brian Belet &#x3C;BBELET@SJSUVM1.sjsu.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/1997 6:07:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Fri, 7 Feb 1997 15:22:01 -0800 Bill Alves said:<br>>However, if you're using a tuning system that does not replicate any<br>>particular interval, how do you specify pitches?

So some of the pseudokeys work out to:<br><br>Gb: Gb A  Bb C  D  Eb F  Gb<br>Eb: Eb F  Gb A  B  C  D  Eb<br>C:  C  D  Eb F  G  A  B  C<br>A:  A  B  C  D  E  F  G  A<br>F:  F  G  A  B  C# D  E  F<br>D:  D  E  F  G  A# B  C# D<br>B:  B  C# D  E  F# G  A# B<br><br>   From that point you learn things analogously with how you'd learn things<br>in an octave-based tuning (pretty much rote but with auditory reinforcement<br>and memory), for example:<br>Intervals:  <br>   - Subminor third (~7:6) above the root is the third step in the scale,<br>   - Supramajor third (~9:7) is the fourth step in the scale,<br>   - The perfect fifth is the sixth step in the scale,<br>   - The major tenth is the fifth step in the second cycle of the scale,<br>etc.<br>Chords:<br>   - A supramajor third-stack triad is scale steps 1, 4, and 7.<br>   - A harmonic-series fragment (4:6:7:9:10:11:15) approximation can be<br>found <br>     at scale steps <br>     First cycle:  1, 6, <br>     Second cycle: 1, 4, 5, #6, <br>     Third cycle:  #3.  <br><br>   It becomes its own new world of its own with all new nomenclature,<br>possibly new notation, new harmony rules, and such.  But once you get to<br>know it, it makes as much sense as the traditional system.  In some cases<br>it's a similar kind of sense, and others it's a very different kind of<br>logic.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 8 Feb 1997 06:23 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA29649; Sat, 8 Feb 1997 06:23:36 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29702<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id VAA15686; Fri, 7 Feb 1997 21:22:03 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 7 Feb 1997 21:22:03 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199702080015_MC2-10FE-B3F4@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4756 href="#4756">ðŸ”—</a>Brian Belet &#x3C;BBELET@SJSUVM1.sjsu.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/1997 6:07:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Fri, 7 Feb 1997 15:22:01 -0800 Bill Alves said:<br>>However, if you're using a tuning system that does not replicate any<br>>particular interval, how do you specify pitches?
