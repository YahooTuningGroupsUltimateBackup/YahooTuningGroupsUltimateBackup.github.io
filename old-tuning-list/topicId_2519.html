This way at least there will be a bunch of<br>correct copies floating around.<br> It's not John's fault the wrong version is on the tape. He's just being nice.<br>But in my defense, I did e-mail John asking him whether or not all pieces were<br> just intoned. They just didn't sound different to me. But i thought well<br>maybe because they were performed on the Starrboard it was less obvious.<br>See, the Starrboard is a 12x12 matrix and indeed the fretts are spaced in<br>equal temperment. BUT in just tuning the strings are retuned to just tuning,<br>you can't move the fretts , however. So I thought well maybe there is just<br>something funky about the way John had to finger the pieces so that the JI<br>wasn't obvious. WRONG.<br>Anyway, John got back to me and said that they were just intoned. He of<br>course, was refering to the second tape of 2 tapes he had sent me not the<br>first one, which was the one I had recorded off of. I just got confused. This<br>was my fault. and I apologize again to John.<br>Fortunately all copies sent out from this point onward will have the correct<br>take on it.<br><br>Denis<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Subject:  the word microtone<br>PostedDate:  13-10-97 07:51:40<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  13-10-97 07:51:02-13-10-97 07:51:03,13-10-97 07:51:29-13-10-97 07:51:29<br>DeliveredDate:  13-10-97 07:51:29<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125652F.00202117; Mon, 13 Oct 1997 07:50:56 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14494; Mon, 13 Oct 1997 07:51:40 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 13 Oct 1997 07:51:40 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14751<br>Received: (qmail 8590 invoked from network); 12 Oct 1997 22:51:37 -0700<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 12 Oct 1997 22:51:37 -0700<br>Message-Id: <3441B46D.296F@dnvr.uswest.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>John Starrett and Tape Swap Damage Control</h1><h3><a id=6277 href="#6277">ðŸ”—</a>Denis.Atadan@mvs.udel.edu</h3><span>10/12/1997 12:43:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Hey folks,<br><br>As I've said, huge apologies to John for getting the wrong version of "Dance<br>of the Mermaids" on the swap.
