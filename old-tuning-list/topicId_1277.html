I'd prefer to<br>pass over it in silence but as Nietzsche has<br>said, silence can be interpreted as "ressentiment".<br><br>Here's Brian:<br><br>>"A speech has two parts.  You must state you case,<br>>and you must prove it.  You cannot either state your<br>>case and omit to prove it, or prove it without<br>>having first stated it."  This is clearly an alien<br>>concept to Eric Lyon and Greg Taylor: but to the<br>>rest of us, it's obvious. <br><br>At this point Brian provides no evidence for his charge,<br>but I have no doubt that it is forthcoming. Meanwhile<br>he will let the implication resonate with Tuning readers that<br>Gregory and I alone on this list are incapable of rational <br>argument while Brian demonstrates his erudition on<br>the subject of perfect fifths. Are we marginalized yet?<br><br><br><intervening discussion of fifths and consonance snipped><br><br>>Instead, we would find ourselves flailing like bugs<br>>stuck in yogurt, as Eric Lyon and Greg Taylor have<br>>done repeatedly on this tuning forum.  Without physical<br>>and psychoacoustic experiment to back up our claims,<br>>we would make foolish unproven statements which turn<br>>out to be nonsense--as Eric Lyon and Greg Taylor have<br>>done repeatedly on this tuning forum.<br><br>Once again an assertion without evidence. But I like the<br>yogurt metaphor, although personally I prefer granola to<br>bugs in my yogurt and other software.<br><br>>Fuzzy thinking and slipshod logic lead to a pervasive<br>>abuse of words, a wanton violation of their recognized<br>>meanings, a disdain and a contempt for precision <br>>in the use of the English language.<br>>To use a word so fundamental to the outlook of modern<br>>western culture as "experimental"  (in the way Cage <br>>does) and willfully pervert its recognized meaning is<br>>to grossly and culpably misuse the word "experimental."<br>>This, both Cage and Lyon have done by claiming that<br>>it means something other than its dictionary definition<br>>as soon as we kidnap the poor word "experiment," jam<br>>a hood over its head, stick a gun in its back, and <br>>frog-march it into the realm of modern music.<br>>Of course, if we want to make up the meaning of the<br>>words we use, we are certainly free to do so.<br><br>Great, something more solid than innuendo and gratuitous<br>personal attack. My response is that often the commonly<br>used dictionary definition of a word is different than<br>how it is used in a special community - sometimes the meanings<br>are contradictory but this doesn't cause a problem to people<br>who understand the context and are committed to trying to<br>understand each other. Most words have several dictionary<br>definitions per dictionary, all requiring further experience<br>in the real world in order to be understood.<br><br>Example: the word "fifth" which Brian discusses in detail.<br>If you tell the average person that the word "fifth" refers to<br>the ratio 3:2, they might wonder why it isn't 1:5. They then<br>need the additional context that the word is used here to measure<br>a musical interval with respect to degrees of the diatonic scale, rather<br>a volume of alcohol. If they are fairminded they won't automatically<br>assume that you're an idiot and incapable of basic mathematics<br>because you don't use the word "fifth" according to its commonly<br>accepted general usage. But if they are Brian, they would accuse you<br>of obfuscation. They would say "fifth has a commonly accepted meaning<br>which you confuse by stealing it for mere use in music. If<br>you want to accurately express the ratio of 2:3, you should call<br>that interval a threetwoed or maybe a twothreed." Fortunately<br>Brian does not write dictionaries.<br><br><br>>Eric Lyon himself touches on this important problem<br>>when he states "indeed the confusion of artistic and<br>>scientific methodologies is one major reason that <br>>many American university music departments have<br>>become somewhat inhospitable for artists." <br>>To put it bluntly, if you propose to use terms borrowed<br>>from the sciences you had better use them properly<br>>and with some  understanding.  Cage did not.<br>>Eric Lyon does not.  Most modern "music theorists"<br>>do not.<br><br>I generally do not use scientific terms to discuss music. When I<br>use a term such as the much maligned "experimental", I use it within<br>a specific 20th century compositional context. "Experimental music" is<br>more a statement of intent than a description. My personal intent is to<br>create music which takes me somewhere I haven't been before, using<br>every technique at my disposal including techniques I may need to invent. <br>If that doesn't sound much different than some earlier music such<br>as Gesualdo, Montiverdi or Bach, that's fine because I consider that<br>music "experimental" in its time. In my earlier post on experimental music, I <br>made clear the distinction between experiment in science and experiment in art. <br>I choose not to repeat it here. I admit that I often use terms with<br>much influence from their personal significance to me, since I'm much<br>more of an artist than a theorist, apparently converse to Brian's <br>orientation. Nonetheless, Brian is also well known for defining terms<br>at will to suit his own agenda.<br><br>In recent post, Brian discussed "computer generated music", and<br>chose to define it as the situation where a composer sets up a random<br>system and accepts the output from the program, direct to DAT. This<br>is a perfectly useless definition. I know many computer music<br>composers and not a single one works this way. Bill Schottstaedt<br>posted in reply, describing his methods which involve an interaction<br>between computer automated processes and his own tastes and<br>compositional judgment. In fact many computer music composers use<br>similar methods, myself included. Brian's reduction of computer music<br>to an absurd strawman demonstrates yet again his lack of understanding<br>of how a true composer actually works. You might as well reduce<br>American action expressionist painting to a guy taking a can of<br>paint and hurling it at the canvas. Or you could take white noise,<br>narrow bandpass filtered at 440Hz and say no, it's not a 440Hz tone, it's<br>just noise. In the real world of musical composition, the composer<br>is the filter, but Brian just doesn't get it.<br><br>>John Cage and his rivals at  Darmstadt, <br>>along with PIerre Boulez' group in Paris were,<br>>by dictionary definition, charlatans one and all.<br>>They spouted meaningless pseudo-scientific<br>>drivel, and  the intent of their "theories" appears<br>>to have been to obfuscate and impress, rather than to <br>>elucidate and specify.<br>>This is the charge made against John Cage in my<br>>topic 3 of TD 803, and the charge stands.  Eric<br>>Lyon has not refuted the charge, since clearly<br>>he does not understand the dictionary definition<br>>of "experimental" any better than John Cage<br>>did.<br><br>I actually didn't read that particular post. I do not<br>live and breathe to defend John Cage. I find some of<br>his ideas useful or provocative, and I find a small<br>fraction of his music excellent and of its time. Cage's<br>writings at their best are intended to stimulate the<br>reader to independent thought, not tell him/her what to<br>think. Brian next takes a series of Cage quotes out of<br>context to ridicule him. I'll just grab a couple.<br><br>>Cage writes:<br>>"Does being musical make one automatically stupid and unable<br>>to listen?  Then don't you think one should put a stop to studying<br>>music?  Where are your thinking caps?" [Cage, John, "Silence,"<br>>page 49]<br>>Let's see:<br>>Studying music must...therefore "make one automatically stupid."<br>>Right.<br><br>Here the literalist reads this as an anti-intellectual<br>statement. Instead, it seems to me that Cage is questioning<br>whether studying music according to an orthodoxy is the best<br>way to understand music. Brian will argue later that studying<br>at a university has destroyed my capacity for rational thought, so<br>therefore, Brian here agrees with his interpretation of Cage's statement:<br><br>>Studying music must...therefore "make one automatically stupid."<br><br><br>>"Musical habits include...the study of the<br>>timbres, single and in combination of a limited<br>>number of sound-producing mechanisms.  In <br>>mathematical terms these all concern discrete<br>>steps." [Cage, John, "Silence," page 9]<br>>Here Cage makes the ignorant blunder of<br>>claiming  that all sounds have spectra which<br>>can be described in "discrete steps."<br><br>Here as elsewhere, Brian demonstrates his lack of understanding<br>of one of the basic tools of timbral analysis - the Fourier transform.<br>All real world spectra are continuous if we consider the noise<br>component. However, they may all be *described as* the summation of<br>a bandlimited series of sine waves, each at a discrete harmonic frequency,<br>through sampling, windowing and FFT analysis, sometimes providing<br>information useful in understanding and manipulating timbre.<br>Cage is right, Brian is wrong. Further, Cage is critical of the<br>traditional use in music of sounds with harmonic as opposed to<br>noise spectra. So you have to have a bit of context about Cage's<br>involvement with percussion music and his program of widening the<br>tonal palette of composers to include noise and ambient sounds.<br>In that context, the shape of a harmonic spectrum is *relatively*<br>discrete compared to that of a noise spectrum. Brian is correct to<br>state that acoustic instruments have both noise and tone elements,<br>but the prevailing music theory at the time of Cage's writing was<br>still primarily concerned with relations among the tone component,<br>e.g. Schenker, 12 tone theory. So Cage was challenging readers to<br>go outside the orthodoxy and think about sound in different ways.<br><br>Brian follows with a diatribe on university profs and music<br>departments which I am really not qualified to respond to<br>other than that his information seems at least 10 years out<br>of date. Certainly Brian's claim about music professors being overpaid<br>or underworked is history in the new order of American<br>education funding. Perhaps someone on the list with current active <br>involvement in an American university can share their perceptions, either<br>as a student or professor. I'm sympathetic to some of Brian's<br>views on the university, but feel that the articulation needs<br>to be a bit more, shall we say, nuanced, in order to connect<br>with reality. <br><br><br>>Thus, it ill behooves me <br><br>(not that it stops him for 50 milliseconds)<br><br>> to criticize those like Eric Lyon<br>>and Greg Taylor, since they are merely the symptoms<br>>of the disease--namely, those "vast factories of junkthink" <br>>called  univerities.<br> <br>Like every artist, I am a symptom (but not just of the university)<br>and accept the compliment. Whether I am a disease is not for me to <br>judge but I have hopes.<br><br>Finally Brian avers:<br><br>>Cage's swindles and perversions of 12-TET<br>>music theory are the disease; microtonality is the cure.<br><br>Hallelujah!<br><br>Eric Lyon<br>eric@iamas.ac.jp<br>http://www.iamas.ac.jp/~eric<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 29 Nov 1996 07:38 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11549; Fri, 29 Nov 1996 07:40:36 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11628<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id WAA10549; Thu, 28 Nov 1996 22:40:34 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 28 Nov 1996 22:40:34 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199611290638.AA07013@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>McLaren - The Theorist as Irritant</h1><h3><a id=4179 href="#4179">ðŸ”—</a>Eric Lyon &#x3C;eric@cmlab.sfc.keio.ac.jp&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/1996 10:36:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Brian McLaren recently posted an attack on me<br>to which I reluctantly respond.
