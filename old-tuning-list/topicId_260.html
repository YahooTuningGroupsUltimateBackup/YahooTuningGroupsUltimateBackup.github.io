The K2000 is very powerful, but it's not<br>very easy to do exotic things on.  The ASR-10 is not as capable as the K2000<br>(although certainly not to be underestimated), but is FAR easier to use than the<br>K2000.  <br><br>   When it comes to using traditional keyboards for nontraditional tunings,<br>that's a big question.  As I think I've mentioned before, most people just map a<br>tuning to the keyboard linearly (adjacent keys on the keyboard going to adjacent<br>pitches in the tuning), mismatching octave boundaries of the keyboard to the<br>octave boundaries of the tuning.  I am in awe of people who can function that<br>way, because I just can't imagine being able to ignore the 7 ivory/5 ebony<br>structure that keyboard imposes.  Then again, I never claimed to be such a great<br>keyboardist;  I've done a lot more with woodwinds and guitar than keyboards.<br>But a lot of people do that quite well.  <br><br>   I prefer, personally, to map the keyboard so that (somehow) octave boundaries<br>in the tuning match octave boundaries on the keyboard, preferably in some<br>meaningful way.  (This sort of thing is very easy to do on the ASR-10, but<br>somewhat more difficult on the K2000, according to my informant.)  For example,<br>in 10TET, I map the keyboard so that adjacent Es and Fs play the same pitch, and<br>similarly with adjacent Bs and Cs.  That effectively gives the keyboard a 5<br>ivory/5 ebony structure, which is very natural for 10TET.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 4 Jan 1996 03:45 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id SAA04297; Wed, 3 Jan 1996 18:45:09 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 3 Jan 1996 18:45:09 -0800<br>Message-Id: <960104024051_71670.2576_HHB84-5@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>K2000 and ASR-10</h1><h3><a id=2431 href="#2431">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/1996 6:43:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Probably the main consideration when it comes to choosing between the K2000<br>and the ASR-10 especially for unusual tunings, based upon a collegue's<br>experience, is power vs. ease of use.
