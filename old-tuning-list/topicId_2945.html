And as such, I'll be prone to look upon the idea of a phonon<br>skeptically until it bonks me over the ears!<br><br>   When I think about the classic experiments for illustrating the<br>particle-wave duality of light, it's difficult for me to see any way to<br>apply them to sound.  I can't imagine any way for example, that you could<br>get a particle-like distribution from the famous "two-slit" experiment if<br>conducted with sound rather than light.  But presumably that just means<br>that I'm conducting an unrevealing experiment.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  RE: PLANCK CONSTANT<br>PostedDate:  31-12-97 06:07:43<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  31-12-97 06:05:27-31-12-97 06:05:28,31-12-97 06:04:50-31-12-97 06:04:51<br>DeliveredDate:  31-12-97 06:04:51<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125657E.001BF239; Wed, 31 Dec 1997 06:07:11 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA28547; Wed, 31 Dec 1997 06:07:43 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 31 Dec 1997 06:07:43 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA28557<br>Received: (qmail 16820 invoked from network); 30 Dec 1997 21:07:40 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 30 Dec 1997 21:07:40 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541100b0cf29e03cbf@[207.207.2.241]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6881 href="#6881">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>12/30/1997 9:07:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>>Gary, this is not correct. E = H nu applies to all energy quanta, whether in<br>>>the form of light, sound, or whatever. The quantum of light is the photon;<br>>>the quantum of sound is the phonon.<br><br>   If by this you mean that sound is conveyed by phonons in the same sense<br>that light is conveyed by photons, then the more I think about it, the less<br>I buy it.<br><br>   Everything about sound is governed by the laws of fluid (and solid)<br>mechanics.  And any mechanical interaction, viewed waaaaaaay down at the<br>sub/atomic atomic level, is ultimately electromagnetic in nature.<br><br>   Now there's normally no realistic value in studying sound at the<br>sub/atomic level, because everything about sound can be modeled many orders<br>of magnitude more simply at the macroscopic level of mechanics.  But still,<br>down at the level of fundamental forces, air-pressure is manifested by<br>collisions of air molecules, and any form of collision is carried out by<br>repulsion between the electrons in the outer shells of those molecules.<br>Electron repulsion is in turn carried out by photons.<br><br>   Or equivalently, the elasticity of the vibration of a string, a steel<br>string for example, is manifested at the sub/atomic level by the<br>distortions of crystaline lattices.  Crystaline lattices are, once again,<br>generated by electron attraction and repulsion, which again is conveyed by<br>photons.<br><br>   So sound is, at this otherwise not very interesting sub/atomic level,<br>ultimately conveyed by photons.  The invention of a new particle, the<br>phonon, seems to be no more than a pointless complication that side-steps<br>well-accepted physical models for no apparent reason.<br><br>   Now presumably I'm not catching on to something, so go ahead and tell me<br>what it is.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com><br>Subject:  Measures of Scale<br>PostedDate:  31-12-97 06:53:21<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  31-12-97 06:50:57-31-12-97 06:50:58,31-12-97 06:50:20-31-12-97 06:50:21<br>DeliveredDate:  31-12-97 06:50:21<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125657E.00201FCF; Wed, 31 Dec 1997 06:52:49 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA28410; Wed, 31 Dec 1997 06:53:21 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 31 Dec 1997 06:53:21 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA28539<br>Received: (qmail 18950 invoked from network); 30 Dec 1997 21:53:17 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 30 Dec 1997 21:53:17 -0800<br>Message-Id: <19971231055333937.AAA68@ascend519.nni.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6898 href="#6898">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>1/1/1998 11:25:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>>The reason for your<br>>>confusion is that nu is not wavelength -- it is angular frequency<br><br>   I just checked my ol' UT physics book.
