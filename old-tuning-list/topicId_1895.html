That's a perfectly<br>good mystery.  One could pose all kinds of suggestions for that.  Perhaps<br>one my propose, for example, that it is a means of testing the human will<br>to build tall buildings or to fly.  Or perhaps, from a very different<br>perspective, one might propose that it is impossible for a universe to even<br>exist without a force with the qualities gravity has.  That latter one<br>could possibly even blossom into a scientific theory, but for now it's<br>intriguing mysticism.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 26 Mar 1997 17:49 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18401; Wed, 26 Mar 1997 17:49:02 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18413<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id IAA03574; Wed, 26 Mar 1997 08:47:31 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 26 Mar 1997 08:47:31 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B1D95D4143F6F.5402@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Replies to Dan, Bruce</h1><h3><a id=5190 href="#5190">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/1997 11:32:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Dan: I was being more than a little facetious, a sin of mine,  when <br>I made the remarks about Western art music being anomalous.
