The instruments *did*<br>evolve, sometimes superseding the underlying rationality, but again in<br>service of expression.<br><br>So, knowing the instruments, Harry did most likely compose by working at<br>them.  I have said how Harry could play all his parts in at least *some*<br>fashion, and that is recollecting a man at the end of his life.  Take a look<br>at him playing the parts to "Daphne of the Dunes" ("Windsong") in the 'Music<br>Studio' film on Enclosures One.  That puppy could play!  And you also start<br>to get a feeling of just how visceral a performer he could be (and we<br>*should* be...).  But I'm off track again.  <br><br>So Harry would develop new parts for new pieces.  Unless he had decided to<br>have a Bass Marimba 2 city blocks long, he couldn't use 2 octaves of all 43<br>tomes, so he had to settle for a few well chosen bass notes.  The harmonic<br>canons, however, were a blank page each time he started fresh.  Remember,<br>they are sounding boxes with 44 (I think) strings on them.  To start, you<br>have 44 individual bridges you can place anywhere under the string.  This<br>sets up 'scales' and 'melodies' and 'clusters' of microtones, depending on<br>the bridge setup, that suggest many paths.  But since the bridges can be<br>placed *anywhere* between the two ends of the strings, it allows for the<br>following interesting option.<br><br>What a lot of people don't realize is that while a lot of Harry's 'melodies'<br>sprang from the sequential plucking of the strings, one after another, he<br>found great stuff on the OTHER side of the bridges too! It's hard to<br>describe, but here goes.  Let's say the individual bridges get closer to<br>the, um, pegboard side.  The pitch goes up the scale.  But since the entire<br>surface of the box is the sounding board, if you pluck the strings on the<br>other side of the bridges you would get a descending series of notes.  Fine<br>adjust both the bridge location and string tension and you can get both<br>sides to fall within your scale of choice!<br><br>These are the kind of creative games he went through.  I can tell you that<br>having performed on all but a couple of the instruments, even when the licks<br>were fiendishly difficult to execute, they *were* playable.  All the better,<br>because when you did master them it gave great satisfaction on stage.<br>Everything he wrote *laid* well on the instruments, from the double-sticking<br>for odd-rhythm groups (i.e.: RRLRL RRLRL RRLRLRL RRLRLRLRL RRLRL forms the<br>5-5-7-9-5 pattern for the 31/16 sections in "Daphne").<br><br>But I have gotten WAY off course.  Harry had an underlying theoretical<br>foundation upon which to build.  He knew the instruments well enough that he<br>could compose away from them, and did.  He combined experimentation<br>('improvising', if you will) on the instruments (to suss out new melodies,<br>harmonic motions and the like) with compositional 'imaging' in his head.  I<br>know that during composing "Dreamer" (his last work) he wasn't around the<br>instruments all the time, so he did *some* stuff in his head.  Certainly he<br>would sing texts, intone phrases and dream up ways to accompany them.<br><br>This has been a little laborious to answer -- sorry!  If anyone might have a<br>specific question I'll try to answer it, and I also will try to find out<br>more from the Mitchell-man about this subject.
