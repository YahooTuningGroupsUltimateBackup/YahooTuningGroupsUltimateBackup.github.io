MOS are generated by intervals which<br>do not divide the octave or other Interval of Equivalence evenly. They<br>are also characterized by a quasi-periodic pattern of two intervals<br>(A and B) whose sizes may have any proportion, but the most familiar<br>ones have  1/2 <= A/B <= 2 as these are Rothenberg-proper. The two<br>intervals A and B are arranged "maximally-evenly" (see papers by<br>John Clough and colleagues, Clampitt, Carey, Douthett et al.) and<br>any given M, there are several possible patterns such that the numbers<br>P of A and Q of B sum to M and have no common factors. Thus for<br>7 tone MOS (M=7), the possible patterns are 6A+1B (and 1A +6B),<br>5A+2B (2A +5B) and 4A+3B (3A+4B). In an N-tone ET, PA +QB = N,<br>and P +Q =M.  Both G and the complement of G with respect to the<br>IE generate the same MOS, though modally rotated. Hence one can<br>obtain the diatonic scale in 12-tet by a cycle of either 4ths or<br>5ths.<br><br>To find the Generator G of each class of MOS of M tones, I do the<br>following. For the simplest case where P= M-1 and Q =1, the limits<br>are 0 to N/M in cents or logs and from 0 to [N/M] where [] is the<br>integer <= N/M in the case of equal temperaments. The logic is that<br>if A/B were infinite and A>B, then B-> 0 and there would be only P=M-1<br>tones per octave (or IE). In the case of M=7, the largest possible<br>generator<br>would be 200 cents as that would yield 6 whole tones and a zero-width<br>interval for B. In the A+6B case, if G were infinitesimal, then there<br>would be 6 very small intervals of G and a large remainder. Hence for<br>the M-1, 1 type of MOS, G lies between 0 and Octave/(M-1).<br><br>For the 5A+2B=7 MOS case. the logic is similar. IF A/B is infinite, then<br>there are only 5 tones per octave (IE), if infinitesimal, then only 2.<br>Hence intervals between 600 and 720 cents generate 7-tone MOS of the<br>5A+2B and 2A+5B form. In 9-tet, G= 5 degrees or 666.667 cents and a<br>cycle of 5 degrees produces a MOS 1 1 1 2 1 1 2. The corresponding<br>scale in 12-tet is 2 2 2 1 2 2 (as ascending successive degrees).<br>The 4+3 scales are produced by cycles of neutral thirds (or 6ths) such<br>as 7 degrees of 24-tet.<br><br>To find the generator(s) of a particular class of MOS in a given<br>N-tone ET, one simply chooses the interval(s) which lie in the ranges<br>calculated above.
