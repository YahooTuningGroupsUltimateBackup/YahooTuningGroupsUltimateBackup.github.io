Either 12TET is a detour to an entropic<br>dead end, or it is a realized ideal.  One person's Stairway to Heaven is<br>another's Highway to Hell. <br><br>      It was not until deep exposure to the tunings of 1600-1850 that I was<br>aware of what 12 TET actually sounded like.  This was after many years of<br>tuning pianos in as close a 12TET as possible.   Several years ago, After a<br>weekend of Vallotti, (courtesy of my Sanderson and Owen Jorgensens big book),<br>  I sat down at a freshly, (Equally) tuned Steinway D, and the realization of<br>what I was hearing struck me like the proverbial ton of bricks. <br>   There is a distinct sound, a recognizable character to 12TET that I,( like<br>a fish NOT being told it is wet), had never really "grokked".  In comparison<br>to earlier tunings,  the 12TET has a very "buzzy" sound.  It sounds sterile<br>to me, and that ain't all bad.         That I was aware of a musical<br>character from this tuning, means, to me, that it is a valid aural<br>construction.  It will do things that other tunings will not.  This gives it<br>enough worth to keep it, and I wonder why some people are so opposed.  This<br>temperament is required for much of our music  composed in the last 150<br>years.  This is an important temperament! <br>     What I think lies at the hub of resistance to 12TET is the near total<br>domination of the musical scene by its convenience.  Whores, all of us;  we<br>pollute the thirds so that we need not call the tuner in when we modulate,<br>and excuse the lack of pure intervals by how artfully we display intellect<br>via the notes.  <br>      Well, there is more to music than intellect.  The effects of pure<br>intevals, and the contrasts available from them with tempered intervals,<br>affect us emotionally, not intellectually.  There are just some things that<br>cannot be said in 12TET.  The problem is in finding an audience for the<br>alternatives. Is this not where the microtonal world is, at the moment?  Is<br>this not where the HIP world limps along the road?  Are we not all searching<br>for audience? ( preferably one with the price of a CD in their pocket!).  <br>     Neil mentions often the need for more than "microdoodling".  I agree.<br> It is terrible when the same doodle infects a whole jazz scene; hours of<br>notes strung together, sustaining some sort of mood, but no real foundation<br>in there to take home as a new inspirational "puppy".   <br>      I would suggest that the chops a musican has are no more than<br>vocabulary.  Whether it is really MUSIC depends on what that musician chooses<br>to SAY with this vocabulary. Some of the most elegant, timeless phrases are<br>built with simple words,  (Remember Spiro Agnew?  I don't remember what he<br>did, just that the press needed dictionaries to understand what he was<br>saying.....) If sound doesn't "say" anything to me, I don't buy it, I don't<br>remember it, and I wish it would go away. <br>    So,  how do we best move the greater mass of music consumers away from<br>the status quo of 12TET?  By showing them that there are other things to<br>listen to, that don't require it,( or require something different).   It<br>means that more than a display of chops is needed.  There needs to be a<br>story, a structure. <br>      I can't help the microtonalists directly, as the 18th century is<br>calling me, but I will suggest that anything that presents an alternative to<br>12TET in an attractive manner will help us all.  I am hoping that a<br>reawakening of temperament awareness via the Classical composers will make<br>leaving 12tet a little easier.  Perhaps the fearful will more readily take<br>the leap away from "home" if they are jumping for something familiar, like<br>Beethoven. <br>       It may be too much to ask that the public embrace an "alien" tuning<br> that is used for music they have never heard, but God bless the multi-fret<br>and the zoom-wowie scalers and "math-monsters".
