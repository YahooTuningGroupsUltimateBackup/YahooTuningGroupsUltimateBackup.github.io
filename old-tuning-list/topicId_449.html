I have to use Lynx, which<br>prevents me from enjoying the graphics and color, but even<br>so, it is  most impressive.  I urge all of you with WEB access<br>to visit it ASAP.<br><br>It's a wonderful resource for microtonal music, Gamelan, and other<br>types of experimental and non-traditional musics, so check it out.  <br><br>FPM's philosophy and mission is best expressed in its own words: <br><br>	"Frog Peak Music is dedicated to exploring innovative <br>technologies <br>	and aesthetics of publication and distribution, and committed <br>	to the idea of availability over  promotion.  Member artists <br>	determine which of their own works are included in Frog Peak <br>	Music, and how  they are included. Frog Peak Music perpetuates <br>	and evolves the historical role of experimental independent <br>	publishing in the United  States. By doing so, it engenders a <br>	hospitable publication environment for its members, and provides <br>	an example of some of the ways that artists might control their <br>	own work in a non-commercial, non-hierarchical fashion, erasing 		<br>distinctions between artist and publisher."<br><br>The site  contains a complete catalogue of books, scores, recordings <br>and journals, including Balungan (published by the American Gamelan <br>Institute), and, all  modesty  aside,  Xenharmonikon and "Divisions of<br>the Tetrachord."  Back issues of Peter Garland's Soundings  and the <br>Lingua Press books are also available. (I've mentioned only a very few <br>of the items available)<br><br>Featured artists include Warren Burt, Ivor Darreg, Carter Scholz, <br>Lou Harrison, Phil Burk, Martin Bartlett, Ann LaBerge, Larry Polansky, <br>Dan Wolf, Gayle Young and  many, many others.  (Pace Brian, there<br>is even an Ivor Darreg subpage.)<br><br><br>To change the subject:<br><br>Mark Rankin called me last night to enquire if there was some way he <br>could post an "ad" or notice to some WEB or internet site. He sells kits <br>for converting 12-tet guitars (or other fretted instruments)  to <br>Interchangeable Fretboard instruments and  he also sells extra custom <br>fretboards. Anyway, does anyone know of such a site or list and its <br>location? Mark is also a JI performer and music theory bibliophile/<br>bibliomane. <br><br>--John<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 5 Jun 1996 07:20 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA13005; Tue, 4 Jun 1996 22:20:54 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 4 Jun 1996 22:20:54 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199606050519.XAA19219@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3011 href="#3011">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/1996 9:23:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Neil H. asks:<br>> ...come to think of it, has anyone<br>> out there done any research on Native American music? <br><br>   Sorry to zoom in on a small detail of your message, but I know only Susan<br>Rawcliff who's investigated and expounded upon native American ceramic<br>instruments.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 6 Jun 1996 06:24 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA28069; Wed, 5 Jun 1996 21:24:53 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 5 Jun 1996 21:24:53 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960606041700_71670.2576_HHB27-11@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3217 href="#3217">ðŸ”—</a>bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G.

Great<br>to have Pat on this forum...<br><br>Second, I've just been thinking of my old mentor in Kansas City, Ed Toler,<br>and remembering how he used to refer to his concept of playing as "10,000<br>Monkeys chattering at 10,000 typewriters"...well, that's how I am appro-<br>aching the tuning thing. I believe there can be an infinite number of<br>intervals and ways to use them. Another teacher of mine, George Keith,<br>always said to avoid becoming attached to any single concept of music;<br>he advised studying many different ways of expressing music, and draw<br>from them what suits you. I took that advice, so terms such as semitone,<br>scale, intervals, and whatever can all have myriad meanings, always<br>depending on the kind of EFFECT you are trying to create with the musical<br>tools at hand. So, with hundreds of billions of galaxies and stars <br>flying around out there, how many musical concepts could possibly exist?<br>To me, this is not idle thought...maybe the sounds of these scales are<br>floating around in the Universe, and perhaps some of these sounds can<br>be picked up by us...and, maybe there are sounds we will never hear, but<br>which could drive another order of beings into ecstasy.<br><br>I've long called my concept the Form Of No Forms, and this certainly<br>extends to tuning theory as well. All of the opinions I see on this<br>forum are noted and examined, and then eventually will filter into my<br>music somehow. I think the time is absolutely right for a new approach<br>to music, an approach wherein tunings are no big deal, and people may<br>actually move between tunings in a commonplace way. As the father of<br>a 7 year old girl, I see how powerful it can be to bring up a child<br>in the arts...to Neela, talk of music and tunings is commonplace; and,<br>I will never teach her that there are only 12 tones in music. So, I<br>believe that if we are persistent in trying to reach folks about the<br>brainwashing we all were given regarding music theory, we can change<br>it...it's really not too hard for people to understand...Hstick<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Date: Sun, 14 Jul 1996 09:15:11 -0700 (PDT)<br>From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com><br>To: tuning<br>Subject: Long post from McLaren<br>Message-ID: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960714091429.27133A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br><br>From: mclaren<br>Subject: The fracas on the tuning forum<br> circa digest 702<br>--<br>More than one correspondent has noted the hullabuloo<br>around tuning digest 702.  <br>John Chalmers incorrectly pointed out my "major error," <br>in a post itself seriously in error--my factual statement<br>that "Xenharmonikon is published and vetted outside<br>of academia" *was* factual, *is* factual, and *will be*<br>factual for the foreseeable future.  Then Paul Rapoport<br>chimed in, advising that "We need fewer hurricanes<br>from the Northwest" when apprised of the gross<br>inadequacy of his bibliographies  As will be shown in <br>a series of upcoming posts, "inadequate" does not even <br>*begin*  to describe Paul Rapoport's bibliographies.<br>Then we heard in rapid succession from  Paul Erlich,<br>who demonstrated a lack of  understanding of the <br>difference between entropy and randomness (the two <br>are *not* identical, especially when dealing with <br>information). And finally Greg Taylor chimed in--<br>of him no more need be said.<br>Whew!<br>That's a Mount Everest of misinformation.<br>So you'll pardon me if it takes a while to refute all<br>the nonsense, half-truths, gross errors, and outright<br>falsities.<br>Microtonality is difficult enough for newcomers, without<br>making it *more* difficult for them by feeding them<br>a bunch of errors--especially when those errors<br>are made by folks who purport to "correct" my<br>posts.<br>But the real issue here isn't so much errors, as<br>attitudes.<br>The words "crank" and "ravings" played a prominent<br>part in the posts around digest 702.<br>Even allowing for the natural excess of the flame warrior,<br>such language is inappropriate to this forum.  Paul Erlich<br>has been a prime mover in using this silly kind of language,<br>along with Gregory Taylor, and frankly it's embarrassing.<br>This kind of flame-war rhetoric doesn't belong on this<br>forum.<br>I've perused  700+ posts since the start of this forum, and <br>so far none of them can be fairly described as the work<br>of "cranks."  <br>Moreover, not one subscriber has struck me as "raving," <br>although various folks (again, notably Paul Erlich and<br>Gregory Taylor) do occasionally get their facts mixed up.<br>So the real question is:<br>Why is such violent and bizarre language used by<br>a handful of folks to describe my posts?<br>What emotions can I have stirred in otherwise<br>normal, well-adjusted, intelligent people to<br>cause them to post such wild accusations?<br>Well, ladies and gentlemen, here's the answer--<br>My posts have struck terror into the hearts of<br>the musical 12-ton-equal-tempered cognitive<br>elite (and their toadies) because the 12-TET <br>establishment is ready to collapse.<br>And guess what?<br>People with power (and their toadies) know something <br>that the rest of us tend to forget--<br>They know that small ideas have a way of <br>becoming large ones. <br>People in power go berserk when they encounter<br>even 1 dissenting voice...<br>--Because they know that order  which is imposed <br>by oppression  and by the crushing of dissent is a <br>very fragile kind of order indeed.<br>And this describes perfectly the state of America's<br>concert halls and conservatories.<br>One or two otherwise sensible forum subscribers have<br> tried to paint me as a "crank" for saying this.<br>They have described my statements in this regard as<br>"ravings."<br>Aside from the question of whether or not my<br>statements make sense (which you would not<br>expect from the "ravings" of a "crank"), let's<br>ask whether my opinions are in the minority...<br>Am I all alone in describing the way that the <br>12-TET Alice Tully Hall Lincoln Center <br>Juilliard Converatory establishment <br>oppresses people who try to step out the<br>sacred 12 tones...?<br>Here is what microtonalist Pauline Oliveros <br>has to say on the subject:<br>"An important issue is the marginalization<br>of our music. As far as the establishment is<br>concerned, we don't exist.  We can do anything<br>we want, in the margins.  But as soon as we<br>want to bring it before a larger audience, <br>we don't exist.  And that, to me, is<br>censorship." [Oliveros, Pauline, "Discussion One,"<br>Ear Magazine, 1991, pg. 22]<br>If my statements constitute the "ravings" of<br>a "crank," then Pauline Oliveros must be<br>raving as well.  Pauline Oliveros must also<br>be a crank.<br>In Tuning Digest 686, I pointed out that the<br>exhaustion of 12-TET theory had led to <br>a situation in which "As readers of [Perspectives<br>of New Music] well know, the once-respected <br>magazine has in the last few years descended <br>into a frenzied downward spiral of gibberish <br>which staggers the imagination and inspires <br>both terror and pity.  Terror, for the reputations <br>of the people who contributed to the infamous <br>1993 'Complexity' issue of PNM; and pity for <br>anyone who misguidedly paid money to read <br>this swill. Now, 'swill' might seem like a harsh <br>word.<br>"Perhaps.<br>"Perhaps not.<br>"You can judge for yourself." - mclaren<br>These, allegedly, were the "ravings" of a <br>"crank."<br>Purportedly, this was an example of my<br>"invective."<br>How about a second opinion?<br>How about seeing  what microtonalist<br>Trevor Wishart has to say on the subject?<br>"In its constant search for new modes of<br>expression, the Western classical music<br>tradition was...constrained by its very<br>concentration upon relationships of a <br>limited set of thus notatable `pitches,'<br>to extend the notatable field of harmonic<br>relationships to the limit. The final step<br>into a 12-tone and thence 'integral' serial<br>technique, rather than being a 'liberation'<br>from this restricted set tonality, must be<br>seen in historical perspective as the final<br>total capitulation to the finitistic permut-<br>ational dictates of a rationalized analytic<br>notation system, and the gateway to much<br>sterile rational formalism..." [Wishart,<br>Trevor, "Musical Writing, Musical Speaking,"<br>in "Whose Music? A Sociology Of Musical<br>Language," Ed. J. Shepherd, P. Virden,<br>G. Vulliamy and T. Wishart, Latimer, London,<br>1977]<br>Sounds like Trevor Wishart is saying the<br>same thing I'm saying.  So now when<br>Trevor Wishart speaks, *he* must be<br>"raving"  too.  He must also be a "crank."<br>And what else have I said to cause such<br>fear and loathing?<br>Let's see...<br>In a number of tuning digests, I've <br>pointed out the obvious fact that John Cage's <br>"music" is a con job produced by an<br>untalented con artist--stunts devoid of musical<br>value, obsessed with theory, exuding the<br>bitter taste of mud dragged up from the<br>bottom of an intonationally  dry well.<br>When they heard these statements, a remarkable<br>number of otherwise sensible folks raised their <br>voices in a shrill chorus, decrying my statement<br>of the obvious as the "ravings" of a "crank."<br>Thus, when Edward Fox writes in The Wire<br>Magazine: <br>"..."There are a lot of good reasons for listening<br>to [Morton Feldman's] music. For one, Feldman<br>was not a musical ideologue or a conceptualist.<br>In this he was very different from Cage, whose<br>music was almost entirely theoretical and based<br>on a cult of the personality of Cage. Much of<br>Cage is unlistenable now as a result. You can<br>*listen* to Feldman." [Fox, Edward, "Annihilated<br>Angel," The Wire, Issue 134, April 1995, pg. 38]<br>..Well, when Edward Fox speaks, he must be<br>spouting the "ravings" of a "crank."<br>And when TIME magazine writes in its obituary<br>of John Cage that "Finally there is the not at <br>all negligible matter of how the music sounds.<br>A  common philistine criticism of avant-garde<br>art used to be that small children banging on <br>pots and pans or flinging paint at a canvas could<br>have produced exactly the same effect. In Cage's<br>case, at least, this is very probably true... A<br>concert of Cage's noises is, by and large, as<br>much of a room emptier as it was when the<br>work was new; Cage may be the first important <br>artist whose work one wants neither to hear<br>nor see." [Walsh, Michael, "Sounds of Silence,'<br>Time, November 1 1993, pg. 88]<br>..Well, clearly, when TIME magazine writes<br>such things we must realize that *these* also<br>are the "ravings" of a "crank."<br>What is wrong with this picture, ladies and<br>gentlemen?<br>Do you get a sour taste in your mouth whenever<br>anyone who dares to disagree is labelled<br>a "crank" and described as "raving"?<br>I sure do.<br>That kind of logic smells bad--especially on<br>discussion thread which consistently maintains<br>the high standards of this one.<br>No, that kind of logic just doesn't parse.<br>For one thing, isn't it peculiar how many "cranks" are<br>"raving" exactly in the same manner?<br>And isn't it odd how much the so-called musical <br>cognitive elite (whose cognitive faculties are<br>in doubt) have to lose if they admit the obvious,<br>and agree that con artists like Cage have in<br>fact driven audiences away from concerts of<br>This is a most curious epidemic of madness--<br>huge numbers of people seem to have gone<br>insane, all at once.  And we're *all* making the same<br>cogent argument--the emperor's got no clothes.  <br>Modernism is dead.  Contemporary 12-TET academic <br>music has become obsessed with theory to the <br>exclusion of all else, elevating words above<br>mere sounds...<br>But then, I forget--these are the "ravings" of a<br>"crank."<br>In that case, when Ingram Marshall writes<br>"Modernism is an obsession with theory; it is<br>an obsession with both the object and idea<br>of art as self-referential.  Modernism begins<br>probably with Schoenberg and ends with, say,<br>Boulez and Cage." [Marshall, Ingram, "MODERNISM--<br>Forget it!" Soundings 11, 1981, pg. 74]<br>..Then Ingram Marshall must be "raving"--he must<br>also be a "crank." <br>And when Derek B. Scott writes in The Musical<br>Quarterly that "Schoenberg went so far as to<br>say: 'Nearly all the works nowadays generally<br>acclaimed...met, when still new, with a cold<br>or even hostile reception.' (..) Time and again<br>we are told of the existence of modern<br>masterpieces that lovers of music have<br>perversely refused to take to their hearts, but<br>that the day will surely come when these works <br>receive their just recognition.  However, the <br>question being asked now is, when indeed will<br>that day come?  One reads calmly Wilfrid Mellers'<br>assurance in 1968 that "Pli Selon Pli" 'will<br>establish itself as a crucial masterpiece of our<br>time.' Yet, Slonimsky's law of the forty-year<br>gap between the arrival of a masterpiece and its<br>general acceptance already has had to be doubled<br>in the case of Erwartung, the work Robert Craft<br>thought Schoenberg's masterpiece. This creates<br>a paradox for those who see longevity as a valuer<br>of 'great art,' for while The Mikado manages to<br>survive despite high-minded scorn, Erwartung<br>survives largely as a result of special pleading."<br>[Scott, Derek B. "Music and Sociology for the 1990s:<br>A Changing Critical Perspective," Musical Quarterly,<br>Vol. 74, No. 3, 1990, pg. 389]<br>..Then, clearly, these are *also* the "ravings" of a <br>"crank."<br>And when in the same article Scott points out<br>"It has taken a long time for a theory of musical<br>relativism to gain ground. A major reason for the<br>delay has been the amount of time consumed in the<br>futile search for an underlying coherent theory by<br>which modernism could be rationally explained and <br>understood when there should have been a recognition<br>that modernism had distingrated into irrationality,<br>failure, and irrelevance." [Scott, Derek B. "Music and <br>Sociology for the 1990s: A Changing Critical <br>Perspective," Musical Quarterly, Vol. 74, No. 3, 1990, <br>pg. 389]<br>..Then we must ask an uncomfortable question--<br>Can *all* these people be "cranks"?<br>Can so many cogent voices pointing out that modernism<br>is dead, 12-TET is exhausted, and it's time to move<br>on to something else... can *all* these people be<br>This is not a trivial issue.  <br>It doesn't have to do with me or with the lynch mob<br>that tried to string me up around digest 702 so<br>much as with the future of music.<br>The issue is important, ladies and gentlemen, and<br>I shall continue to bring it up again and *again*<br>and AGAIN on this tuning forum, because it is by<br>no means certain that microtonality represents <br>the future of music.<br>We know modernism is dead...  We know that composers<br>like Cage and Boulez killed 12-TET with a tidal wave<br>of narcissism, nihilism, and self-indulgence (to use<br>the exact words of the New York Times--presumably<br>the "ravings" of yet more "cranks")...<br>But there are *many* paths away from modernism.  One<br>path leads to microtonal expansion of melodic and harmonic<br>resources...others lead to a contraction--even<br>a reactionary impoverishment of melodic and harmonic<br>resources.<br>Thus, when Scott states "Throughout the 1980s criticism<br>was mounting from the political right and left, from<br>sociologists, ethnomusicologists and anthropologists.<br>The feeling that Western 'art music' was in crisis<br>pervaded many of the decade's articles: the title, for<br>example, of Michael Kowalski's article "The Exhaustion<br>of Western Art Mustic" speaks for itself... (..) It became<br>pointless to debate whether Boulez, Cage or Tippett<br>represented the way ahead for high culture since, to echo<br>a well-known song, those taking the high road had been<br>overtaken by those taking the low raod.  Even among the <br>middle classes and the 'educated'--and among 'serious'<br>musicians--attention has been drifting away from<br>contemporary high culture to popular culture.  The <br>attention which a television arts program would have <br>given to a major new work by Tippett in the 1970s<br>was more likely to be directed toward a new album<br>by Elvis Costello in the 1980s." [Scott, Derek B. "Music and <br>Sociology for the 1990s: A Changing Critical <br>Perspective," Musical Quarterly, Vol. 74, No. 3, 1990, <br>pg. 390] ...When he writes these words, there it is.<br>It's right  on the table.<br>Here's the crux of the dilemma, ladies and gentlemen.<br>Charlatans like Cage and Boulez have so throroughly<br>alienated audiences by miring 12-TET music in<br>a tarpit of masturbatory theory, that to many people <br>nowadays "serious" music means "meaningless idiocy <br>and endless theoretical claptrap."<br>There is *still* a chance to reclaim the dwindling<br>audience for modern music, but we're *not* going<br>to do it by remarking on the glamour of the <br>naked emperor's new clothes.<br>There's a good chance to revive modern music <br>even after the hatchet job performed on it by<br>Cage and Boulez and Babbitt and Ferneyhough--<br>the surge in popularity of Partch's music *proves*<br>that.  The popularity of the "Bang On A Can"<br>concerts (which include a substantial share of <br>non-12 music, from Arnold Dreyblatt's just intonation <br>"orchestra of excited strings" to Julia Wolfe's "Steam" <br>for Harry Partch's instruments and amplified flute, to<br>Annie Gosfield's 24-TET "The Manufacture of Tangled<br>Ivory") demonstrate that in spades.<br>People *will* come to listen to serious modern<br>music--unless we drive them away.<br>People *will* still listen to serious modern <br>music, as long as we don't insult their intelligence...<br>as the otherwise sensible Paul Erlich has insulted <br>*your* intelligence by trying to get you to believe <br>that I'm a "crank." <br>Music is going through a tectonic upheaval right now--<br>modernism is dead and in the process of collapsing...<br>but nothing has yet arrived to take its place. <br>If we don't insult our audience's intelligence,<br>microtonality might well be what comes out of<br>this tectonic upheaval.  <br>But there's no guarantee.<br>And so when people like the otherwise credible Paul Erlich<br>try to paint me as a "crank," or as mentally ill, or as<br>an amusing but fundamentally ignorant know-nothing,<br>it's simply foolish--what I'm saying makes too <br>much sense.  You know it.  I know it.  We all know it.<br>This, ladies and gentlemen, is not  a horse with <br>legs, as they say at Belmont Park.  <br>This pony won't run.  <br>The average person on the street knows that<br>what I'm saying is *exactly* true--modern music<br>ran into a rut, fell into a ditch, and lost touch<br>with both audiences *and* real passion,<br>real emotion, real fist-in-the-gut impact.<br>And that's why this issue is so terribly important<br>to this tuning forum.  <br>We have a window of opportunity here--a limited <br>one.  It won't last long.  <br>And if we microtonalists make the same mistake<br>the modernists made, and if we spiral down into<br>a dizzy abyss of sterile theory and obfuscatory<br>gibberish as James Boros has done, then microtonality <br>won't cut it.<br>People will turn away.  They'll listen to pop<br>rock, or rap, or some other kind of music...<br>They'll listen to music which lacks<br>the complexity and sophistication<br>of "serious" music, but which *doesn't* insult<br>their intelligence the way the productions of<br>Babbitt and Cage and Boulez did--they will<br>listen, instead, to music which *DOES* have <br>some real emotional impact.<br>So when a handful of otherwise reasonable folks<br>try to paint me as a "raving" "crank," they are setting<br>a very specific course for the musical future.<br>"Theory ueber alles!" is their watchword. "To hell<br>with what the music sounds like, let's have some<br>more diagrams!" <br>That's their message.<br>I contend that it's time to admit modernism is<br>dead.<br>I say it's time to admit that theory and diagrams<br>and equations have driven out  consideration of <br>what a piece of music actually <br>*sounds* like.<br>I say it's time to start over again.  Throw out<br>modernism, throw out the 12-TET Forte/Rahn/<br>Babbitt  pitch class matrix cliches, get<br>back to the acoustics and psychoacoustics of<br>music and sound--and renew "serious" Western<br>music by expanding its melodic and harmonic<br>resources xenharmonically.<br>Decide for yourself--are these the "ravings"<br>of a "crank"?<br>Think carefully.

As far as what Mr.<br>Gibson said about musicians writing for the masses, and not for the<br>exceptionally acute listeners...Gregg, when I write, I try and follow my<br>inner voice, the gift I have been given, whatever that may be. I am not<br>trying to write for anyone, although after a piece is conceived, I may<br>then try and decide if it is appropriate for one group or another. There<br>are some of my pieces that I would not play in a blues bar, for instance,<br>because they are inappropriate for that group of folks, at that time.<br>When I write using 34 tone equal temperament, I am aware that the<br>"masses' may not relate to it so well, but is that because of the<br>cultural training we all receive, or what? I feel that if a piece is good<br>and real, than the tuning is not the main issue...it's the end result. I<br>see no reason why the "masses," whoever they are, cannot like music in<br>any tuning, as long as the piece itself is valid. Which gets into some<br>interesting areas...are we writing music to try and please the largest<br>number of people possible (and from which culture, by the way...a large<br>group of Turkish folks may well relate totally differently to a<br>particular piece than a bunch of people from Alabama, I think), or are we<br>writing music that we feel needs to be written because we hear it that<br>way? Which musicians did you mean, anyway, when you said that "they"<br>write for the masses?<br>    Also, again on the issue of hearing teensy intervals, and are they<br>musically valid... I am sure that training is the issue here, not can we<br>hear small intervals. Of course we can...the old saw about people using<br>only 10% of their brains is very applicable in this case. I am confident<br>that, if people were brought up with the concept of intervals smaller<br>than 12 equal, we would find that most people could hear intervals<br>smaller than 12, 19, or whatever. Gregg, I would suggest that you look<br>into the music of Joe Manieri, for one...he uses 72 equal, and even<br>teaches this system, and claims that folks have little trouble with it,<br>once they are exposed to it. I also recommend listening to Johnny<br>Reinhard's string quartet, "Cosmic Rays, " which has comma intervals<br>throughout...I can hear them, and I am sure that anyone could, if given<br>the proper training and exposure...I am presently writing a 34 tone piece<br>that uses the comma interval (one 34 tone step, in this case) as the<br>primary interval of the piece, and have played it for several<br>folks...everyone can hear it, and I personally think it is essential to<br>the piece, and has a real haunting sort of effect. Why you believe what<br>you do is a mystery to me at this point; it is far removed from many of<br>the "microtonalists" I have gotten to know so far, but perhaps future<br>discussions will make your position clearer...Hstick  PS...also, to<br>dismiss tunings because they are "useless" reminds me of Duke Ellington's<br>comments about music in general...there's only two kinds of music, good<br>or bad.

Member artists <br>	determine which of their own works are included in Frog Peak <br>	Music, and how  they are included. Frog Peak Music perpetuates <br>	and evolves the historical role of experimental independent <br>	publishing in the United  States. By doing so, it engenders a <br>	hospitable publication environment for its members, and provides <br>	an example of some of the ways that artists might control their <br>	own work in a non-commercial, non-hierarchical fashion, erasing 		<br>distinctions between artist and publisher."<br><br>The site  contains a complete catalogue of books, scores, recordings <br>and journals, including Balungan (published by the American Gamelan <br>Institute), and, all  modesty  aside,  Xenharmonikon and "Divisions of<br>the Tetrachord."

Great<br>to have Pat on this forum...<br><br>Second, I've just been thinking of my old mentor in Kansas City, Ed Toler,<br>and remembering how he used to refer to his concept of playing as "10,000<br>Monkeys chattering at 10,000 typewriters"...well, that's how I am appro-<br>aching the tuning thing. I believe there can be an infinite number of<br>intervals and ways to use them. Another teacher of mine, George Keith,<br>always said to avoid becoming attached to any single concept of music;<br>he advised studying many different ways of expressing music, and draw<br>from them what suits you. I took that advice, so terms such as semitone,<br>scale, intervals, and whatever can all have myriad meanings, always<br>depending on the kind of EFFECT you are trying to create with the musical<br>tools at hand. So, with hundreds of billions of galaxies and stars <br>flying around out there, how many musical concepts could possibly exist?<br>To me, this is not idle thought...maybe the sounds of these scales are<br>floating around in the Universe, and perhaps some of these sounds can<br>be picked up by us...and, maybe there are sounds we will never hear, but<br>which could drive another order of beings into ecstasy.<br><br>I've long called my concept the Form Of No Forms, and this certainly<br>extends to tuning theory as well. All of the opinions I see on this<br>forum are noted and examined, and then eventually will filter into my<br>music somehow. I think the time is absolutely right for a new approach<br>to music, an approach wherein tunings are no big deal, and people may<br>actually move between tunings in a commonplace way. As the father of<br>a 7 year old girl, I see how powerful it can be to bring up a child<br>in the arts...to Neela, talk of music and tunings is commonplace; and,<br>I will never teach her that there are only 12 tones in music. So, I<br>believe that if we are persistent in trying to reach folks about the<br>brainwashing we all were given regarding music theory, we can change<br>it...it's really not too hard for people to understand...Hstick<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Date: Sun, 14 Jul 1996 09:15:11 -0700 (PDT)<br>From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com><br>To: tuning<br>Subject: Long post from McLaren<br>Message-ID: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960714091429.27133A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br><br>From: mclaren<br>Subject: The fracas on the tuning forum<br> circa digest 702<br>--<br>More than one correspondent has noted the hullabuloo<br>around tuning digest 702.  <br>John Chalmers incorrectly pointed out my "major error," <br>in a post itself seriously in error--my factual statement<br>that "Xenharmonikon is published and vetted outside<br>of academia" *was* factual, *is* factual, and *will be*<br>factual for the foreseeable future.  Then Paul Rapoport<br>chimed in, advising that "We need fewer hurricanes<br>from the Northwest" when apprised of the gross<br>inadequacy of his bibliographies  As will be shown in <br>a series of upcoming posts, "inadequate" does not even <br>*begin*  to describe Paul Rapoport's bibliographies.<br>Then we heard in rapid succession from  Paul Erlich,<br>who demonstrated a lack of  understanding of the <br>difference between entropy and randomness (the two <br>are *not* identical, especially when dealing with <br>information). And finally Greg Taylor chimed in--<br>of him no more need be said.<br>Whew!<br>That's a Mount Everest of misinformation.<br>So you'll pardon me if it takes a while to refute all<br>the nonsense, half-truths, gross errors, and outright<br>falsities.<br>Microtonality is difficult enough for newcomers, without<br>making it *more* difficult for them by feeding them<br>a bunch of errors--especially when those errors<br>are made by folks who purport to "correct" my<br>posts.<br>But the real issue here isn't so much errors, as<br>attitudes.<br>The words "crank" and "ravings" played a prominent<br>part in the posts around digest 702.<br>Even allowing for the natural excess of the flame warrior,<br>such language is inappropriate to this forum.  Paul Erlich<br>has been a prime mover in using this silly kind of language,<br>along with Gregory Taylor, and frankly it's embarrassing.<br>This kind of flame-war rhetoric doesn't belong on this<br>forum.<br>I've perused  700+ posts since the start of this forum, and <br>so far none of them can be fairly described as the work<br>of "cranks."  <br>Moreover, not one subscriber has struck me as "raving," <br>although various folks (again, notably Paul Erlich and<br>Gregory Taylor) do occasionally get their facts mixed up.<br>So the real question is:<br>Why is such violent and bizarre language used by<br>a handful of folks to describe my posts?<br>What emotions can I have stirred in otherwise<br>normal, well-adjusted, intelligent people to<br>cause them to post such wild accusations?<br>Well, ladies and gentlemen, here's the answer--<br>My posts have struck terror into the hearts of<br>the musical 12-ton-equal-tempered cognitive<br>elite (and their toadies) because the 12-TET <br>establishment is ready to collapse.<br>And guess what?<br>People with power (and their toadies) know something <br>that the rest of us tend to forget--<br>They know that small ideas have a way of <br>becoming large ones. <br>People in power go berserk when they encounter<br>even 1 dissenting voice...<br>--Because they know that order  which is imposed <br>by oppression  and by the crushing of dissent is a <br>very fragile kind of order indeed.<br>And this describes perfectly the state of America's<br>concert halls and conservatories.<br>One or two otherwise sensible forum subscribers have<br> tried to paint me as a "crank" for saying this.<br>They have described my statements in this regard as<br>"ravings."<br>Aside from the question of whether or not my<br>statements make sense (which you would not<br>expect from the "ravings" of a "crank"), let's<br>ask whether my opinions are in the minority...<br>Am I all alone in describing the way that the <br>12-TET Alice Tully Hall Lincoln Center <br>Juilliard Converatory establishment <br>oppresses people who try to step out the<br>sacred 12 tones...?<br>Here is what microtonalist Pauline Oliveros <br>has to say on the subject:<br>"An important issue is the marginalization<br>of our music. As far as the establishment is<br>concerned, we don't exist.  We can do anything<br>we want, in the margins.  But as soon as we<br>want to bring it before a larger audience, <br>we don't exist.  And that, to me, is<br>censorship." [Oliveros, Pauline, "Discussion One,"<br>Ear Magazine, 1991, pg. 22]<br>If my statements constitute the "ravings" of<br>a "crank," then Pauline Oliveros must be<br>raving as well.  Pauline Oliveros must also<br>be a crank.<br>In Tuning Digest 686, I pointed out that the<br>exhaustion of 12-TET theory had led to <br>a situation in which "As readers of [Perspectives<br>of New Music] well know, the once-respected <br>magazine has in the last few years descended <br>into a frenzied downward spiral of gibberish <br>which staggers the imagination and inspires <br>both terror and pity.  Terror, for the reputations <br>of the people who contributed to the infamous <br>1993 'Complexity' issue of PNM; and pity for <br>anyone who misguidedly paid money to read <br>this swill. Now, 'swill' might seem like a harsh <br>word.<br>"Perhaps.<br>"Perhaps not.<br>"You can judge for yourself." - mclaren<br>These, allegedly, were the "ravings" of a <br>"crank."<br>Purportedly, this was an example of my<br>"invective."<br>How about a second opinion?<br>How about seeing  what microtonalist<br>Trevor Wishart has to say on the subject?<br>"In its constant search for new modes of<br>expression, the Western classical music<br>tradition was...constrained by its very<br>concentration upon relationships of a <br>limited set of thus notatable `pitches,'<br>to extend the notatable field of harmonic<br>relationships to the limit. The final step<br>into a 12-tone and thence 'integral' serial<br>technique, rather than being a 'liberation'<br>from this restricted set tonality, must be<br>seen in historical perspective as the final<br>total capitulation to the finitistic permut-<br>ational dictates of a rationalized analytic<br>notation system, and the gateway to much<br>sterile rational formalism..." [Wishart,<br>Trevor, "Musical Writing, Musical Speaking,"<br>in "Whose Music? A Sociology Of Musical<br>Language," Ed. J. Shepherd, P. Virden,<br>G. Vulliamy and T. Wishart, Latimer, London,<br>1977]<br>Sounds like Trevor Wishart is saying the<br>same thing I'm saying.  So now when<br>Trevor Wishart speaks, *he* must be<br>"raving"  too.  He must also be a "crank."<br>And what else have I said to cause such<br>fear and loathing?<br>Let's see...<br>In a number of tuning digests, I've <br>pointed out the obvious fact that John Cage's <br>"music" is a con job produced by an<br>untalented con artist--stunts devoid of musical<br>value, obsessed with theory, exuding the<br>bitter taste of mud dragged up from the<br>bottom of an intonationally  dry well.<br>When they heard these statements, a remarkable<br>number of otherwise sensible folks raised their <br>voices in a shrill chorus, decrying my statement<br>of the obvious as the "ravings" of a "crank."<br>Thus, when Edward Fox writes in The Wire<br>Magazine: <br>"..."There are a lot of good reasons for listening<br>to [Morton Feldman's] music. For one, Feldman<br>was not a musical ideologue or a conceptualist.<br>In this he was very different from Cage, whose<br>music was almost entirely theoretical and based<br>on a cult of the personality of Cage. Much of<br>Cage is unlistenable now as a result. You can<br>*listen* to Feldman." [Fox, Edward, "Annihilated<br>Angel," The Wire, Issue 134, April 1995, pg. 38]<br>..Well, when Edward Fox speaks, he must be<br>spouting the "ravings" of a "crank."<br>And when TIME magazine writes in its obituary<br>of John Cage that "Finally there is the not at <br>all negligible matter of how the music sounds.<br>A  common philistine criticism of avant-garde<br>art used to be that small children banging on <br>pots and pans or flinging paint at a canvas could<br>have produced exactly the same effect. In Cage's<br>case, at least, this is very probably true... A<br>concert of Cage's noises is, by and large, as<br>much of a room emptier as it was when the<br>work was new; Cage may be the first important <br>artist whose work one wants neither to hear<br>nor see." [Walsh, Michael, "Sounds of Silence,'<br>Time, November 1 1993, pg. 88]<br>..Well, clearly, when TIME magazine writes<br>such things we must realize that *these* also<br>are the "ravings" of a "crank."<br>What is wrong with this picture, ladies and<br>gentlemen?<br>Do you get a sour taste in your mouth whenever<br>anyone who dares to disagree is labelled<br>a "crank" and described as "raving"?<br>I sure do.<br>That kind of logic smells bad--especially on<br>discussion thread which consistently maintains<br>the high standards of this one.<br>No, that kind of logic just doesn't parse.<br>For one thing, isn't it peculiar how many "cranks" are<br>"raving" exactly in the same manner?<br>And isn't it odd how much the so-called musical <br>cognitive elite (whose cognitive faculties are<br>in doubt) have to lose if they admit the obvious,<br>and agree that con artists like Cage have in<br>fact driven audiences away from concerts of<br>This is a most curious epidemic of madness--<br>huge numbers of people seem to have gone<br>insane, all at once.  And we're *all* making the same<br>cogent argument--the emperor's got no clothes.  <br>Modernism is dead.  Contemporary 12-TET academic <br>music has become obsessed with theory to the <br>exclusion of all else, elevating words above<br>mere sounds...<br>But then, I forget--these are the "ravings" of a<br>"crank."<br>In that case, when Ingram Marshall writes<br>"Modernism is an obsession with theory; it is<br>an obsession with both the object and idea<br>of art as self-referential.  Modernism begins<br>probably with Schoenberg and ends with, say,<br>Boulez and Cage." [Marshall, Ingram, "MODERNISM--<br>Forget it!" Soundings 11, 1981, pg. 74]<br>..Then Ingram Marshall must be "raving"--he must<br>also be a "crank." <br>And when Derek B. Scott writes in The Musical<br>Quarterly that "Schoenberg went so far as to<br>say: 'Nearly all the works nowadays generally<br>acclaimed...met, when still new, with a cold<br>or even hostile reception.' (..) Time and again<br>we are told of the existence of modern<br>masterpieces that lovers of music have<br>perversely refused to take to their hearts, but<br>that the day will surely come when these works <br>receive their just recognition.  However, the <br>question being asked now is, when indeed will<br>that day come?  One reads calmly Wilfrid Mellers'<br>assurance in 1968 that "Pli Selon Pli" 'will<br>establish itself as a crucial masterpiece of our<br>time.' Yet, Slonimsky's law of the forty-year<br>gap between the arrival of a masterpiece and its<br>general acceptance already has had to be doubled<br>in the case of Erwartung, the work Robert Craft<br>thought Schoenberg's masterpiece. This creates<br>a paradox for those who see longevity as a valuer<br>of 'great art,' for while The Mikado manages to<br>survive despite high-minded scorn, Erwartung<br>survives largely as a result of special pleading."<br>[Scott, Derek B. "Music and Sociology for the 1990s:<br>A Changing Critical Perspective," Musical Quarterly,<br>Vol. 74, No. 3, 1990, pg. 389]<br>..Then, clearly, these are *also* the "ravings" of a <br>"crank."<br>And when in the same article Scott points out<br>"It has taken a long time for a theory of musical<br>relativism to gain ground. A major reason for the<br>delay has been the amount of time consumed in the<br>futile search for an underlying coherent theory by<br>which modernism could be rationally explained and <br>understood when there should have been a recognition<br>that modernism had distingrated into irrationality,<br>failure, and irrelevance." [Scott, Derek B. "Music and <br>Sociology for the 1990s: A Changing Critical <br>Perspective," Musical Quarterly, Vol. 74, No. 3, 1990, <br>pg. 389]<br>..Then we must ask an uncomfortable question--<br>Can *all* these people be "cranks"?<br>Can so many cogent voices pointing out that modernism<br>is dead, 12-TET is exhausted, and it's time to move<br>on to something else... can *all* these people be<br>This is not a trivial issue.  <br>It doesn't have to do with me or with the lynch mob<br>that tried to string me up around digest 702 so<br>much as with the future of music.<br>The issue is important, ladies and gentlemen, and<br>I shall continue to bring it up again and *again*<br>and AGAIN on this tuning forum, because it is by<br>no means certain that microtonality represents <br>the future of music.<br>We know modernism is dead...  We know that composers<br>like Cage and Boulez killed 12-TET with a tidal wave<br>of narcissism, nihilism, and self-indulgence (to use<br>the exact words of the New York Times--presumably<br>the "ravings" of yet more "cranks")...<br>But there are *many* paths away from modernism.  One<br>path leads to microtonal expansion of melodic and harmonic<br>resources...others lead to a contraction--even<br>a reactionary impoverishment of melodic and harmonic<br>resources.<br>Thus, when Scott states "Throughout the 1980s criticism<br>was mounting from the political right and left, from<br>sociologists, ethnomusicologists and anthropologists.<br>The feeling that Western 'art music' was in crisis<br>pervaded many of the decade's articles: the title, for<br>example, of Michael Kowalski's article "The Exhaustion<br>of Western Art Mustic" speaks for itself... (..) It became<br>pointless to debate whether Boulez, Cage or Tippett<br>represented the way ahead for high culture since, to echo<br>a well-known song, those taking the high road had been<br>overtaken by those taking the low raod.  Even among the <br>middle classes and the 'educated'--and among 'serious'<br>musicians--attention has been drifting away from<br>contemporary high culture to popular culture.  The <br>attention which a television arts program would have <br>given to a major new work by Tippett in the 1970s<br>was more likely to be directed toward a new album<br>by Elvis Costello in the 1980s." [Scott, Derek B. "Music and <br>Sociology for the 1990s: A Changing Critical <br>Perspective," Musical Quarterly, Vol. 74, No. 3, 1990, <br>pg. 390] ...When he writes these words, there it is.<br>It's right  on the table.<br>Here's the crux of the dilemma, ladies and gentlemen.<br>Charlatans like Cage and Boulez have so throroughly<br>alienated audiences by miring 12-TET music in<br>a tarpit of masturbatory theory, that to many people <br>nowadays "serious" music means "meaningless idiocy <br>and endless theoretical claptrap."<br>There is *still* a chance to reclaim the dwindling<br>audience for modern music, but we're *not* going<br>to do it by remarking on the glamour of the <br>naked emperor's new clothes.<br>There's a good chance to revive modern music <br>even after the hatchet job performed on it by<br>Cage and Boulez and Babbitt and Ferneyhough--<br>the surge in popularity of Partch's music *proves*<br>that.  The popularity of the "Bang On A Can"<br>concerts (which include a substantial share of <br>non-12 music, from Arnold Dreyblatt's just intonation <br>"orchestra of excited strings" to Julia Wolfe's "Steam" <br>for Harry Partch's instruments and amplified flute, to<br>Annie Gosfield's 24-TET "The Manufacture of Tangled<br>Ivory") demonstrate that in spades.<br>People *will* come to listen to serious modern<br>music--unless we drive them away.<br>People *will* still listen to serious modern <br>music, as long as we don't insult their intelligence...<br>as the otherwise sensible Paul Erlich has insulted <br>*your* intelligence by trying to get you to believe <br>that I'm a "crank." <br>Music is going through a tectonic upheaval right now--<br>modernism is dead and in the process of collapsing...<br>but nothing has yet arrived to take its place. <br>If we don't insult our audience's intelligence,<br>microtonality might well be what comes out of<br>this tectonic upheaval.  <br>But there's no guarantee.<br>And so when people like the otherwise credible Paul Erlich<br>try to paint me as a "crank," or as mentally ill, or as<br>an amusing but fundamentally ignorant know-nothing,<br>it's simply foolish--what I'm saying makes too <br>much sense.  You know it.  I know it.  We all know it.<br>This, ladies and gentlemen, is not  a horse with <br>legs, as they say at Belmont Park.  <br>This pony won't run.  <br>The average person on the street knows that<br>what I'm saying is *exactly* true--modern music<br>ran into a rut, fell into a ditch, and lost touch<br>with both audiences *and* real passion,<br>real emotion, real fist-in-the-gut impact.<br>And that's why this issue is so terribly important<br>to this tuning forum.  <br>We have a window of opportunity here--a limited <br>one.  It won't last long.  <br>And if we microtonalists make the same mistake<br>the modernists made, and if we spiral down into<br>a dizzy abyss of sterile theory and obfuscatory<br>gibberish as James Boros has done, then microtonality <br>won't cut it.<br>People will turn away.  They'll listen to pop<br>rock, or rap, or some other kind of music...<br>They'll listen to music which lacks<br>the complexity and sophistication<br>of "serious" music, but which *doesn't* insult<br>their intelligence the way the productions of<br>Babbitt and Cage and Boulez did--they will<br>listen, instead, to music which *DOES* have <br>some real emotional impact.<br>So when a handful of otherwise reasonable folks<br>try to paint me as a "raving" "crank," they are setting<br>a very specific course for the musical future.<br>"Theory ueber alles!" is their watchword. "To hell<br>with what the music sounds like, let's have some<br>more diagrams!" <br>That's their message.<br>I contend that it's time to admit modernism is<br>dead.<br>I say it's time to admit that theory and diagrams<br>and equations have driven out  consideration of <br>what a piece of music actually <br>*sounds* like.<br>I say it's time to start over again.

As far as what Mr.<br>Gibson said about musicians writing for the masses, and not for the<br>exceptionally acute listeners...Gregg, when I write, I try and follow my<br>inner voice, the gift I have been given, whatever that may be. I am not<br>trying to write for anyone, although after a piece is conceived, I may<br>then try and decide if it is appropriate for one group or another. There<br>are some of my pieces that I would not play in a blues bar, for instance,<br>because they are inappropriate for that group of folks, at that time.<br>When I write using 34 tone equal temperament, I am aware that the<br>"masses' may not relate to it so well, but is that because of the<br>cultural training we all receive, or what? I feel that if a piece is good<br>and real, than the tuning is not the main issue...it's the end result. I<br>see no reason why the "masses," whoever they are, cannot like music in<br>any tuning, as long as the piece itself is valid. Which gets into some<br>interesting areas...are we writing music to try and please the largest<br>number of people possible (and from which culture, by the way...a large<br>group of Turkish folks may well relate totally differently to a<br>particular piece than a bunch of people from Alabama, I think), or are we<br>writing music that we feel needs to be written because we hear it that<br>way? Which musicians did you mean, anyway, when you said that "they"<br>write for the masses?<br>    Also, again on the issue of hearing teensy intervals, and are they<br>musically valid... I am sure that training is the issue here, not can we<br>hear small intervals. Of course we can...the old saw about people using<br>only 10% of their brains is very applicable in this case. I am confident<br>that, if people were brought up with the concept of intervals smaller<br>than 12 equal, we would find that most people could hear intervals<br>smaller than 12, 19, or whatever. Gregg, I would suggest that you look<br>into the music of Joe Manieri, for one...he uses 72 equal, and even<br>teaches this system, and claims that folks have little trouble with it,<br>once they are exposed to it. I also recommend listening to Johnny<br>Reinhard's string quartet, "Cosmic Rays, " which has comma intervals<br>throughout...I can hear them, and I am sure that anyone could, if given<br>the proper training and exposure...I am presently writing a 34 tone piece<br>that uses the comma interval (one 34 tone step, in this case) as the<br>primary interval of the piece, and have played it for several<br>folks...everyone can hear it, and I personally think it is essential to<br>the piece, and has a real haunting sort of effect. Why you believe what<br>you do is a mystery to me at this point; it is far removed from many of<br>the "microtonalists" I have gotten to know so far, but perhaps future<br>discussions will make your position clearer...Hstick  PS...also, to<br>dismiss tunings because they are "useless" reminds me of Duke Ellington's<br>comments about music in general...there's only two kinds of music, good<br>or bad.
