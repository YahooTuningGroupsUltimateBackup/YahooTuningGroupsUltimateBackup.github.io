Partch based his tunings on what he<br>called "primary tonalities".  That is, he stopped stacking like intervals<br>fairly early.

Partch's method is more in touch with the<br>harmonic series, but he wound up having to add in "secondary tonalities"<br>rather arbitrarily.

I think that by adding more dimensions<br>to the tonality diamond I can rid my model of a need for "secondary<br>tonalities".

No tuning can use the entire series, they must "start" and "stop"<br>somewhere.<br>  2. Each new prime member you include provides intervals you couldn't<br>get before.<br>  3. The even-number identities are all duple copies of lower odd-number<br>identities.<br>  4. Each higher odd-number identity gives you primary tonalities that<br>were secondary tonalities at the lower identity, that is, stand alone<br>intervals now appear that were compound intervals at a lower odd-number.<br>  5. When the start and stop notes of a mode bare ratio 1:2, then that<br>mode is a duple wide.<br>  6. A given duple of the series contains twice the number of notes as<br>the duple just below it: it contains all the notes in that previous mode<br>and a new note between each of the old ones.<br><br>Carl<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET><br>Subject:  Re: Consonance<br>PostedDate:  28-10-97 22:59:01<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  28-10-97 22:58:00-28-10-97 22:58:00,28-10-97 21:58:34-28-10-97 21:58:35<br>DeliveredDate:  28-10-97 21:58:35<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125653E.0078A960; Tue, 28 Oct 1997 22:57:56 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA30018; Tue, 28 Oct 1997 22:59:01 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 28 Oct 1997 22:59:01 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29753<br>Received: (qmail 27640 invoked from network); 28 Oct 1997 13:58:58 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 28 Oct 1997 13:58:58 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.95.971028165209.22086A-100000@u2.farm.idt.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Erlich's Issues</h1><h3><a id=6357 href="#6357">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@nni.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/1997 12:25:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>>>http://www.catalog.com/starrlab/uzone.htm<br>>><br>>>This site contains no price or ordering info.
