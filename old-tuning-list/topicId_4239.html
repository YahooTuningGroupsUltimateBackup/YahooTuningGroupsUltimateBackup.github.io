Indeed the year 1998 may be an<br>ideal time for this dialogue, since one of the earliest known<br>documents referring to the use of such compositions (possibly<br>Perotin's four-part organa _Viderunt omnes_ and _Sederunt principes_)<br>dates to 1198 or so.<br><br>Please let me begin by dissociating this specific question from the<br>matter of cross-cultural responses to the European-style triadic<br>harmony of a later period, fraught with very some very sensitive<br>cultural issues. Interestingly, for example, the magazine _Early<br>Music_ some years ago had an article on a Japanese delegation which<br>visited Venice somewhere around the 1580's, an era of early triadic<br>music in Europe, and may have found this polyphony an "interesting<br>toy" or the like.<br><br>Anyway, two people have offered comments which invite further<br>discussion. First Bill Alves:<br><br>> Medieval polyphony was something perfectly suited to the aesthetics<br>> of gothic church music, so it is little wonder that contemporary<br>> writers praised it, just as later writers praised the symphony<br>> orchestra, Bach's counterpoint, Mozart's melodies, or Beethoven's<br>> emotionalism. Yet I would hardly conclude that other cultures if<br>> exposed to Bach, Mozart, or Beethoven would gladly don their<br>> styles. One might also point out that the Medieval music refered to<br>> in those accounts certainly did not have "full chordal harmony" as<br>> we think of it.<br><br>One complication here is that some of "us" may have different<br>conceptions of just what "full chordal harmony" implies. To me, it<br>implies a texture which, when judged by the standards of a given<br>period, is saturated with the most complex stable sonorities<br>possible. It also implies to me at least three voices, as opposed to a<br>two-voice texture with simple intervals but not "chords."<br><br>To many people, "chords" are implicitly built in thirds, or must<br>consist of three distinct "pitch classes," so that I personally prefer<br>to use the terms "combination" or "multi-voice sonority" in a medieval<br>context in order to minimize confusion.<br><br>Whatever terms we prefer to use, Gothic harmony from Perotin onward is<br>based on a unit of stable saturation which I call the _trine_ after<br>Johannes de Grocheio (c. 1300), who refers to a _trina harmoniae<br>perfectio_ or "threefold perfection of harmony" based on a complete<br>sonority of three voices and intervals: outer octave, lower fifth, and<br>upper fourth (e.g. d-a-d'). Note that the octave counts as a "real"<br>interval, and indeed a full trine might be described as a harmonic<br>division of the octave. In term of string-ratios, we have 12:8:6, with<br>the differences between adjacent terms -- (12-8):(8-6) or 4:2 or 2:1<br>-- having the same ratio as that between the outer terms, 12:6 or 2:1.<br><br>For people on the list with geometric inclinations, it's interesting<br>that a cube has 12 edges, 8 corners, and 6 faces.<br><br>Gothic music of the era 1200-1420 or so is thus based on a texture in<br>which complete trines ideally alternate with unstable sonorities<br>considered in a given epoch and style to be apt and pleasing, whether<br>as cadential sonorities used in directed resolutions, or as<br>"coloristic" sonorities (e.g. g-b-d' or g-c'-d' in a 13th-century<br>style). To me, this is "full trinic harmony," whether or not one wants<br>to introduce the adjective "chordal."<br><br>Starting around 1420, there is a transitional period of about a<br>century from the early Dufay through Josquin, say, when the sonorous<br>ideal shifts from an alternation of stable trines and unstable<br>sonorities to a pervasive tertian sound. By around the time of<br>Jannequin and the early 16th-century Italian madrigalists, say the<br>1520's, we might speak of a "triadic" texture where sonorities with a<br>fifth divided into two thirds, or a sixth divided into a lower third<br>and upper fourth (e.g. c-e-g, c-e-a) are predominant. By the middle<br>of the century, theorists such as Vicentino (1555), Zarlino (1558),<br>and Tomas de Santa Maria (1565) are emphasizing this standard of full<br>sonority.<br><br>Note that either trinic or triadic sonority, although "full" in its<br>own terms, might sound quite "bare" to an enthusiast of modern jazz<br>or 11-limit just intonation, for example.<br><br>Of course, on this list, it seems obligatory to add that Pythagorean<br>intonation is nicely suited to the trinic harmony of the Gothic, while<br>5-limit just intonation or meantone nicely fits the triadic style of<br>the Renaissance.<br><br>In another post, Daniel Wolf remarked:<br><br>> Other musicians, however, have come round to a triadic basis after a<br>> deep consideration of the consequences suggested by particular<br>> musical materials. I am quite fond, for example, of polyphonic music<br>> in pythagorean intonation (c.f. Margo Schulter's postings to this<br>> list) or of Javanese slendro (which is pythagorean in structure but<br>> not intonation). But neither of these systems lends itself to<br>> completely independent (i.e. non-parallel) part writing in more than<br>> two voices, and the introduction of an additional consonant tone<br>> within the space of the fifth is terribly convenient in this<br>> regard.<br><br>Here I might comment that "completely independent" part-writing may be<br>defined differently in different eras and styles. Thus parallel fifths<br>and fourths are not seen as compromising the essential independence of<br>the parts in 13th-century trinic harmony as long as contrary motion<br>remains the general rule, and the same may be said for parallel thirds<br>and sixths in a 16th-century triadic context.<br><br>If three or more voices all move at the same time, it's inevitable<br>that at least two of them must move in similar or parallel<br>motion. However, one index of maximum "harmonic efficiency" in a<br>directed cadential progression might be the number of unstable<br>intervals that get resolved by conjunct or near-conjunct contrary<br>motion. Thus consider these 13th-century progressions:<br><br>        f'-g'                            d'-c'<br>        e'-d'                            b -c'<br>        c'-d'                            g -f<br>        a -g                             e -f<br><br>(m6-8 + m3-5 + M3-1 + m2-4)       (m7-5 + m3-1 + M3-5 + m3-1)<br><br>Each of these sonorities includes among its six intervals _four_<br>unstable ones each resolving by conjunct contrary motion; there are<br>also some parallel fifths and fourths which enrich the texture, just<br>as parallel thirds and sixths are common in later triadic cadences.<br><br>Also, while of course it is true that we cannot create any _stable_<br>sonority by adding a third voice "within the space of a fifth," we can<br>create some _relatively_ concordant sonorities by precisely this<br>method, as can be seen in Perotin and various 13th-century<br>repertories.
