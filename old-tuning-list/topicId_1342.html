In much music c.1500 the <br>wolf, even on a 12-note keyboard didn't necessarily constitute a great <br>problem, at least for the clavichord: if the piece to be played included <br>a G#, all was well; if it included an Ab, then the G#s could all be <br>retuned within a minute or two by conscientious players. The need for <br>both G# and Ab did not arise so often as to defeat the measures I have <br>mentioned above (the same problems and solutions were present for C# <br>versus Db etc.).<br><br>Now here is the point: a JI keyboard, such as Zarlino envisaged, would <br>also contain a wolf: i.e. a diminished sixth which the unwary player <br>might call upon to serve as a perfect fifth. But in addition to this, it <br>would contain a 40/27 -- a perfect fifth less a syntonic comma. Without <br>dividing the lower rank of keys -- i.e. our white keys today -- this <br>would appear between D and A if the Ptolemy sequence was chosen as the <br>basis of the tuning (as Zarlino wished). Leaving aside the question of <br>whether a JI keyboard is practicable (I would certainly say it isn't, <br>and that 1/4-comma meantone is the practical keyboard equivalent of <br>5-limit JI), we are left with a terminology problem: we have two <br>varieties of interval which are not what they seem from the layout of <br>the keyboard, namely the 40/27 and the diminished sixth (192/125).<br><br>Do we really want to use the same term "wolf" for these two very <br>different intervals? The 40/27 is a syntonic comma flat of a 3/2 perfect <br>fifth, while a 5-limit diminished sixth is 41 cents _sharp_ of a 3/2. To <br>complicate matters further, the established usage of wolf for a <br>diminished sixth in any open tuning/temperament allows it to be applied <br>legitimately to a range of intervals: e.g. the 3-limit diminished sixth <br>is 262144/177147, a Pythagorean comma _flat_ of a 3/2. So even leaving <br>aside meantone and its relatives, and various open irregular <br>temperaments used in the 16th and 17th centuries, we have a 5-limit wolf <br>41 cents sharp of 3/2 and a 3-limit wolf 21.5 cents flat of 3/2.<br><br>Dressing up a 40/27 in wolves' clothing, however many recent precedents <br>can be adduced, therefore seems a recipe for irretrievable theoretical <br>confusion.<br><br>-- <br>Jonathan Walker<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 15:48 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01830; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 15:50:48 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01833<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id GAA17779; Fri, 6 Dec 1996 06:50:45 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 6 Dec 1996 06:50:45 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612061449.XAA00821@judy.sfc.keio.ac.jp><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Crying "wolf".</h1><h3><a id=4268 href="#4268">ðŸ”—</a>kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk (Jonathan Walker)</h3><span>12/6/1996 6:31:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Joe Downing wrote:<br>> By the way: In Just Intonation, how do you avoid a wolf in a <br>> progression like the following: I V I  vi ii V I?
