However, the 5/4 is only a composite interval made up <br>of two melodics in the intense diatonic; it is only available as a melodic in <br>the context of the enharmonic tetrachord, and of the few sources we have, <br>there appears to be a consensus in favour of 5/4 as the leading ratio, which <br>is endorsed by Archytas, Didymus and Ptolemy, although they differ in their <br>division of the remaining pyknon. One of the grounds on which Ptolemy <br>objected to Archytas's divisions was the retention of 28/27 as the following <br>(i.e. lowest) interval in all three genera, a feature which was contrary to <br>practice (and thus unacceptable, in the context of Ptolemy, because it is <br>evidence of reasoning which has not been submitted to empirical testing). <br>Ptolemy also provides us with important evidence for a trend in favour of the <br>more tense tetrachords ("more tense" meaning that the mutable inner degrees <br>of the tetrachord were tuned higher in relation to the fixed outer degrees), <br>since he tells us that his enharmonic and soft chromatic, though constructed <br>in accordance with reason, were unfamiliar to experience (by his time), and <br>so the intense chromatic is the softest of all the tetrachords featured in <br>Ptolemy's careful description of the tunings that were actually used in his <br>time (it appears in the tropoi kithara tuning, mixed, of course, with the <br>even diatonic).<br><br>-- <br>Jonathan Walker<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 19:47 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA32181; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 19:47:47 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA31649<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id KAA19356; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 10:44:22 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 27 Feb 1997 10:44:22 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3315C527.58C9@cavehill.dnet.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>History of the Diatonic Scale</h1><h3><a id=4883 href="#4883">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>2/25/1997 12:44:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com><br><br>I do agree that in most cases the diatonic scale existed without a <br>standardized tuning.
