In 1989, Dvorak <br>wrote a column about CD-ROM technology that was just as negative - and <br>just as wrong -as his March 1996 column about CD-R. There is a reason behind <br>this animosity on Dvoraks part - it took him six months to successfully <br>install his first CD-ROM drive, by his own admission. As a result, he <br>dismissed the entire technology as worthless, which says more about <br>Dvorak than it does about CD-ROM or any of its related technologies.<br><br>Lets take your claims one-by-one.<br><br>1. The problem with the writeable CD technology is that you have to make an<br>`image' to be written to the disk. If you want to back up 650 MB, you <br>want to have another 650 MB on your hard disk empty to store the image, <br>which is then transferred to the CD-R.<br><br>---False. You have the option, supported by most if not all CD-R software<br>packages,to record "on-the-fly" from a virtual image. A virtual image <br>takes from 1% to 5% of the space of the data to be recorded, depending on <br>the software. Creating a virtual image is virtually transparent to the user<br> - you drag and drop the files to be included, then click on record.<br><br>2. You get *one shot at writing to the disk* from beginning to end. You <br>can do multiple sessions, but that's a *real hassle too.*<br><br>---False. When Dvorak says something is a "real hassle", what hes really <br>saying is "this is something I dont understand and wont spend five <br>minutes figuring out, let alone attempt to explain to you". Again, <br>depending on the software, creating multiple sessions is a simple <br>drag-and-drop, point-and-click operation. Its not rocket science.<br><br>3. If there's a  glitch, brownout, operating system hiccup, horribly <br>fragmented file, or any number of things, then the CD doesn't get burned, <br>and you end up with a *blown session.*  These are common, and *the result <br>is a totally useless disk* that must be discarded.<br><br>---False. Dvorak is right that any of these factors, or more likely, a <br>combination of them, can ruin a recording session by causing a buffer <br>underrun. It is not, however, a common occurence, it does not necessarily <br>render a disc useless, and it is certainly not unavoidable. In over six <br>years of using CD-R, I have never cut a coaster or had a buffer underrun. <br>It is certainly not unavoidable. In over six years of using CD-R, I have<br>never cut a coaster or had a buffer underrun.<br> <br>4. It takes a couple of hours to prepare your files to be burned into the <br>disk. If something changes, you have to start over.  And if your hard disk <br>isn't fast enough, you can't even burn the disk at all.<br><br>---False. You can prepare files for recording on CD-R in a matter of <br>seconds. A large dataset might take longer. A dataset intended for <br>distribution might take longer yet, but only because of normal <br>precautions that would be part of preparing any dataset for distribution: <br>virus checking, defragmentation, directory structure, file placement. <br>Most CD-R manufacturers recommend a minimum hard drive speed of 19 ms.<br><br>5. "One vendor told me that the quad-speed CD-ROM writers *were kept off the<br>market* because the system requirements were outrageous, and tolerances for<br>error was nil.<br><br>---False. This must have been a vendor of 2x CD-Recorders. 4x <br>CD-Recorders have been on the market since 1993, and they function <br>perfectly well on a 386 with 8MB RAM.<br><br>---In short, everything Dvorak says is wrong.<br><br>6. The test reported on this forum in which a 15-minute audio file was <br>written to CD-R is, alas, meaningless.  The acid test: how often does the <br>drive and disc combo produce a bad burn when a full 680 megs of audio <br>data are written non-stop to CD-R disk?<br><br>---Apparently not often enough to prevent numerous state, federal, and city<br>governments as well as legal firms from using CD-R as an archival medium for<br>irreplaceable data, or to prevent hospitals from using it to store permanent<br>medical records, or to prevent Jet Propulsion Laboratories from converting<br>irreplaceable data, or to prevent hospitals from using it to store permanent<br>medical records, or to prevent Jet Propulsion Laboratories from converting<br>their 9-track tape libraries of raw satellite data to CD-R. Apparently <br>not often enough to prevent sales of CD-Recordable drives from increasing <br>by a factor often in the past 12 months, or to prevent dozens of CD-R <br>service bureaus from basing successful businesses on creating quality <br>music and data CD-R discs by the thousands every month for their customers.<br><br>7. Reports suggest that the error rate right now is around 60%, depending <br>on the brand of CD-R disc.  That is, 6 out of 10 discs produce a bad burn <br>and a blowndisc which must be discarded.<br><br>---Id be very interested in seeing those "reports". It would be an amazing<br>contrast to the independent testing being sponsored by organizations such as<br>SIGCAT (Special Interest Group for CD Application Technology), OSTA (Optical<br>Storage Technology Association) and JPL. The OSTA prelimianry test results<br>impressed even those of us who knew CD-R was a reliable storage medium - it<br>showed disc reliability to be greater than 96%, regardless of the disc brand.<br> <br>8. Worse still, my gearhead friends inform me that the writeable CD <br>technology is so flaky that to get good results, people who burn their <br>own CDROMs must check the grapevine to see which brand name of writeable <br>CD-R disc has a bad error rate this month, and which manufacturer came <br>out with a good batch.  One month TDK writeable CD-R discs produced <br>near-100% bad burns, the next month it was Mitsui, the next month Sony... <br>And it changes from one month to the next.  You get the idea.<br><br>---I get the idea you or your gearhead friends are making this up. As <br>someone who has been burning her own CD-Rs, providing technical support <br>for other CD-R users, and writing about the technology for publication <br>since 1990, I can assure you this does not happen among "people who burn <br>their own CD-Rs". The media is relabeled and distributed by hundreds of <br>companies. There is no way of knowing whether a given disc was made in a <br>certain month, and often there is no way to tell who the original <br>manufacturer was. CD-R users couldn't exchange this information even if <br>they wanted or needed to. The problem these days isn't getting a certain <br>brand of media, it's getting any media at all. There is currently a <br>worldwide shortage of several months' duration, and every CD-R media <br>manufacturer is building new plants and adding production lines to keep <br>up with the increased demand, which far exceeded their wildest <br>expectations. This doesn't sound like evidence of a "flaky" technology<br>to me.<br><br>9. Worse still, many CD-R writeable drives will burn discs that other <br>brands of CD-ROM read-only drives cannot read. <br><br>---This would be more accurately expressed as "some CD-ROM drives are <br>incapable of reading some CD-R discs." This is not because there is <br>necessarily something wrong with the discs. It?s because some CD-ROM <br>drive manufacturers cut corners and narrow the required parameters within <br>which the drive will read to the point that some CD-R discs - as well as <br>many pressed CD-ROM discs - cannot be read, even though they are within <br>specifications. It is also not attributable to the drives that recorded <br>the discs. Recorders use a built-in Optimum Power Calibration before <br>every writing instance to ensure that what is recorded can be reliably <br>read by any CD-ROM drive or CD audio player that is capable of reading <br>within the full range of disc parameters.<br><br>10. Despite all the nonsense about the photoreactive dye lasting 10 <br>years, 20 years, 500 years, or what-have-you, the brutal reality is that <br>CD-R discs don't last very long.  A year, maximum.  Probably less.<br><br>---I have a backup of my hard drive on a CD-R disc recorded in 1990. It?s <br>still good, as are all the other discs I have recorded since then. I have <br>not lost one disc to age. The fact is that CD-R discs will probably last <br>longer than pressed CDs, because they use gold, rather than aluminum, as <br>a reflective layer. Aluminum tends to corrode due to reactions with <br>impurities in the polycarbonate and in the aluminum itself. Gold does <br>not. However long the data on CD-R lasts, whether it is 10 years or 300, <br>the fact remains that CD-R is the most durable medium ever developed for <br>the storage of data, with the possible exception of papyrus sealed in <br>clay jars.<br><br>11.  Fingerprints are permanent.  They cannot be burnished off.  Try to <br>do so, and you'll destroy the CD-R because you'll smudge the <br>photoreactive dye.<br><br>---Have you ever actually seen a CD-R disc?<br>Fingerprints can be wiped or washed off. I polish off fingerprints on my <br>pants leg. The dye - which is an organic dye polymer sensitive to a certain<br>wavelength of laser - is protected on one side by a 1.2mm thick layer of <br>clear polycarbonate (the same stuff used to make motorcycle helmets); on the <br>other by a thin layer of gold and a UV-cured lacquer, often with an <br>additional layer of protective coating and/or printable surface. Your <br>fingers will never come in contact with the dye layer.<br><br>12. The photoreactive dye is laid down in a single continuous spiral <br>track 1/10 the width of a human hair.  As the disc endures thermal stress <br>in winter and summer, the single continuous spiral track distorts and <br>finally becomes unreadable.<br><br>---The dye polymer is applied via spin coating over the entire surface of the<br>disc. Track pitch is 1.6 micrometers, the same as for pressed CDs, and <br>the track itself is .6 micrometers wide. On an unrecorded disc, the <br>spiral track is in the form of a "wobbled pregroove" molded, as a <br>sinusoidal wave with a .3 micrometer excursion, into the polycarbonate <br>itself. The pregroove guides the recording laser. The spiral track on a <br>recorded disc is composed of optical marks produced by a chemical change <br>and/or degradation in the dye layer.  "Thermal stress" is not a factor in <br>data loss as much as prolonged exposure to  extremely bright light, which <br>can theoretically, over a period of years, affect the <br>comparative reflectivity of marked and unmarked areas of the disc.<br><br>13. If the spiral dye channel is even microscopically off-center, the CD-ROM<br>drive will accumulate so many errors as the drive head runs from the inside<br>toward the outside fo the CD-R disc that the disc will be unreadable.<br><br>---The pregroove is molded into the disc and does not change or become <br>distorted. If the molded pregroove is microscopically off-center beyond the <br>allowed parameters, the affected disc will never make it out of the <br>plant, nor will the thousands of other discs pressed from the same mold.<br><br>14. Thus, unfortunately, the writeable CD technology is not ready for <br>prime time. I researched the technology 6 months ago:it was dismal.  <br>Packet-writing drives are now beginning to become available, but it <br>doesn't seem to have helped the abysmal error rate of the CD-R media, nor <br>has it helped lengthen the ridiculously short lifespan of dye-based CD-R <br>discs once burned. Those of you who are contemplating buying a CD-R <br>writeable drive to burn your own microtonal audio CDs would do well to <br>wait another 3-5 years.  Perhaps the technology will have been debugged <br>by then.<br><br>---I have been working with and researching CD-R technology for most of <br>the past seven years, and I am forced to conclude that your research is <br>what could more properly be described as "dismal" and plagued by an <br>"abysmal error rate".  If you depend on the baseless opinions of has-been <br>PC industry pundits, or the properly be described as "dismal" and plagued <br>by an "abysmal error rate".  If you depend on the baseless opinions of <br>has-been PC industry pundits, or the advertisement-driven mainstream PC <br>industry magazines for your information, in fact, Id have to say the <br>appropriate term for your CD-R research is "non-existent" - and your <br>"findings" are glaring proof of that.<br><br>You and John Dvorak could both benefit from doing some real research on CD-R.<br>I'd hate to think that someone might actually decide not to try CD-R <br>technology because he or she mistakenly thought you actually knew what <br>you were talking about.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Dana J.
