I have some personal experience with them though.<br><br>   Neutral thirds are usually (as far as I'm aware) taken to be 11:9 ratio<br>intervals.  11:9 turns out to be remarkably close to the square root of 3:2 -<br>remarkably for such a simple ratio that is.<br><br>   I wrote a short composition in 88CET tuning intended to explore neutral<br>thirds.  Four steps in 88CET (the nonoctave equal temperament whose primitive<br>step size is 88 cents) is pretty close to 11:9.  I don't have copies of that<br>composition on a web page or anything like that (yet anyway!), but I could<br>perhaps send you a cassette of it, or something to that effect.<br><br>   But based upon my own experiences with it, here are some relevant comments:<br>1.  Without a doubt, it's most valuable usage is for its own character, but<br>    like it or not, the most likely reaction to it is instead as an ambiguous<br>    third:  We're so used to classifying thirds as major or minor that most<br>    people, upon hearing a neutral third, will try to call it one or the other.<br>2.  That in itself is a powerful musical tool:  In that context the effect can<br>    can really tantalyze your audience, because they can hear the same<br>    interval ten times, and each time they hear it, their impression changes:<br>    "it's major... no, it's minor...  no, wait, it IS major..."<br>3.  If that is your musical goal, then a third slightly flatter than 11:9 is<br>    probably a better bet than 11:9 itself.  Although 11:9 is indeed quite<br>    close to the middle position between the two, our ears seem to<br>    gravitate more toward major than minor.  So to make it as difficult<br>    to decide as possible, you have to bias it toward minor a little bit.<br>4.  Neutral thirds, all in all to my ears at least, create an impression of<br>    ambiguity and indecisiveness.
