But, do you really think eq temps are "easier?" Boy, that opens up <br>a whole canful of ideas about music and expression; I mean, I guarantee <br>you that John Starrett's upcoming pieces on the forum CD are <br>extraordinarily difficult to play, even though they're in 19 eq, and <br>they're great music to boot. On the other hand, I've heard a BUNCH of <br>music in pure tunings that didn't take much skill or imagination to play.<br>If you mean that understanding pure tunings is on a higher level of some <br>sort, as opposed to the "simpler" eq temps, maybe. There is surely a <br>depth in the exploration of the harmonic series that approaches infinity; <br>how intellectual knowledge translates into music and sound is a whole <br>different ballgame, though. I'm not sure if my 34 tone eq temp guitar is <br>any "easier" to play than Rod Poole's 17 tone purely fretted axe. In <br>fact, Rod told me that even 22 notes was uncomfortable for him. So, pure <br>or tempered, "easy" is a tricky term to use regarding a choice of <br>instruments. People can surely have various reasons why they choose a <br>certain tuning system. As has been pointed out many times, <br>temperaments allow a musician to utilize a lot of chord changes, <br>while often, pure tunings are more modally oriented. I like and respect <br>any form of profound expression, chordal or scalar; I see the study and <br>application of different tuning systems one more tool in my musical bag.<br>I try to apply tunings much the same way I do modal ideas in my 12 tone <br>playing; as Ivor Darreg often pointed out, each system has it's own mood <br>or feel; this is absolutely correct. So, I will continue to study and <br>apply new concepts of tuning in an effort to improve my art. But, if I <br>want to expand on Coltrane's "Giant Steps," I'll bet, first of all, that <br>it is "harder" than snot to play, and is much better suited to an equal <br>temp (such as 19, where I have adapted it), than it is to a purely tuned <br>instrument...Hstick</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Equal temps are "easy"</h1><h3><a id=7819 href="#7819">ðŸ”—</a>Aline Surman &#x3C;stick@uswest.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/1998 9:25:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Hey Monzo...look, I know you're a sharp fellow, and I enjoy your <br>ideas.
