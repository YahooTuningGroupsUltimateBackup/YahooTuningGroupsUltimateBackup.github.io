But, do you really think eq temps are "easier?" Boy, that<br>> opens up  a whole canful of ideas about music and expression...<br><br>First off, here's the original statement I made [Monzo, TD 1415]:<br>>  I'll grant that equal temperaments are easy to hear in<br>> melodic terms, but, aside from the ratios they imply well<br>> or badly, they don't have much significance from a<br>>  _harmonic_  standpoint.<br><br>I posted to TD 1418 a quote from Ben Johnston which describes<br>how we prefer melodic intervals to be more-or-less equal.  My<br>point was that powers of 2 (which is how we calculate equal-<br>tempered scales) only have _harmonic_  significance in that<br>they represent or approximate ratios with higher prime factors.<br><br>> ...I mean, I guarantee you that John Starrett's upcoming pieces<br>> on the forum CD are extraordinarily difficult to play, even though<br>> they're in 19 eq, and they're great music to boot. On the other<br>> hand, I've heard a BUNCH of music in pure tunings that didn't<br>> take much skill or imagination to play...<br><br>Agreed.  The intonational vehicle one chooses certainly has a<br>determining influence on the music one creates, but I don't think<br>it has anything to do with quality -- that's a function of the musician's<br>talent.  Difficulty of playing is determined more by instrument<br>construction than by anything else -- if your axe is set up to give<br>you perfect ratios or perfect 12-eq steps, that's basically what<br>you'll get (excluding variations caused by bending, lipping,<br>understanding, research, etc.)<br><br>>...If you mean that understanding pure tunings is on a higher<br>> level of some sort, as opposed to the "simpler" eq temps, maybe...<br><br>The Johnston article describes four different types of scalar<br>order, and each one is more complex to understand than the last.<br>The mechanism for comparing equal intervals is #3, and that for<br>JI is #4.<br><br>> There is surely a depth in the exploration of the harmonic<br>> series that approaches infinity;...<br> <br>This is _EXACTLY_  the point I've been making about Schoenberg.<br>He stuck with 12-eq because JI opened up a world of possibilities<br>that he felt was just too vast to deal with on a practical level,<br>resulting in his compromise of accepting the use of all 12 tones<br>in the 12-eq scale as representing ratios thru a 13-limit.<br><br>> ...how intellectual knowledge translates into music and sound is a<br>whole <br>> different ballgame, though. I'm not sure if my 34 tone eq temp guitar<br>is <br>> any "easier" to play than Rod Poole's 17 tone purely fretted axe. In <br>> fact, Rod told me that even 22 notes was uncomfortable for him. So,<br>pure <br>> or tempered, "easy" is a tricky term to use regarding a choice of <br>> instruments.<br><br>As noted above, "easy" referred to a conceptual aspect of<br>intonation and not to any "real world" instrumental application.<br><br>> People can surely have various reasons why they choose a <br>> certain tuning system.<br><br>In the old days, they might cite the number of planets (ancient<br>Greeks) or sides on a cube (Zarlino)...<br><br>The reasons are as varied as people's personalities are<br>different,  _as long as they are aware that there is a choice_!!!<br><br>> As has been pointed out many times, temperaments<br>> allow a musician to utilize a lot of chord changes, <br>> while often, pure tunings are more modally oriented...<br><br>I'm glad you qualified this with "often".  I've heard this so many<br>times I think I'll puke the next time. <br><br>It's true that JI will bring out modal qualities well, as JI pieces<br>are usually "Monophonic" in Partch's sense.  That is, all<br>pitches in the pieces have a tendency to centralize one<br>specific reference pitch as an overall "tonic", while ETs<br>give the same chord/ interval patterns over and over again<br>on all their degrees, making  _exactly transposable_  chord<br>changes possible.<br><br>But as your qualification indicates, this is not always the case.<br>Much of the theoretical literature on JI is centuries (or even<br>millennia) old, and does not take into account the intonational<br>flexibility that we moderns have available to us.  It is possible<br>today to write music in JI that has all of the transposable,<br>modulatable stuff that ETs have.  In fact, it's always been<br>available to good a cappella singers.<br><br>> ... I like and respect any form of profound expression, chordal or<br>> scalar; I see the study and application of different tuning systems<br>> one more tool in my musical bag.<br><br>This is very similar to the viewpoint I'm coming around to regarding<br>the ability of Delta Blues musicians to play around with subtle<br>JI pitch inflections over a 12-eq foundation.<br><br>> I try to apply tunings much the same way I do modal ideas in my<br>> 12 tone playing; as Ivor Darreg often pointed out, each system<br>> has it's own mood or feel; this is absolutely correct...<br><br>Agreed.  One single listen to the complete set of Easley Blackwood's<br>"Microtonal Etudes", one each in an ET from 13-eq to 24-eq,<br> demonstrates quickly that each ET has a definite mood.<br><br> My personal opinion is that this is due at least in part to the<br>closeness<br>with which each of these various ETs approximates ratios of various<br>prime factors -- in keeping with my belief that each prime factor<br>has its own unique effect/ affect.  Various ETs approximate different<br>prime factors well or badly (12-eq is good for 3, OK for 5, mediocre<br>for 7, terrible for 11.  24-eq, on the other hand, is great for 11).<br><br>> ... So, I will continue to study and apply new concepts of tuning<br>> in an effort to improve my art...<br><br>That's the most important thing.<br><br>> But, if I want to expand on Coltrane's "Giant Steps," I'll bet, first<br>> of all, that it is "harder" than snot to play,...<br><br>I've learned it -- it  *is*  harder than snot to play.<br><br>> ... and is much better suited to an equal temp (such as 19,<br>> where I have adapted it), than it is to a purely tuned instrument<br>> ...Hstick<br><br>"Purely" here certainly means "Just".<br><br>I posted this a few weeks ago [Monzo, TD 1403:]<br>>  ... jazz harmony as it developed thru be-bop and beyond<br>> could not have happened without accepting *a priori* the<br>> 12-eq scale.
