You seem to be saying that the<br>closeness to 10/9 makes the tone more dissonant.  I say it is the amount<br>by which it deviates from 9/8 that is important.  The interval does sound<br>worse than a 5-limit one with similar mistuning.  I suggest this is<br>because mistuning adds dissonance to an interval, which will be more<br>noticeable the more dissonant it is to start with, until it becomes so<br>dissonant as to be incomprehensible.<br><br>Maybe "incomprehensible" isn't the right word there, but hopefully you<br>get the idea.<br><br>>>but three out of tune<br>>>intervals will still be worse than one.<br><br>>I was only making an analogy, not a direct comparison.<br><br>You provided the analogy, I provided the argument.  Naturally I give the<br>counter-argument as well.<br><br>>>I'll write the chord under discussion as Eb-G-A-C#.  The G-A interval<br>>>_is_ ambiguous as to 9/8 or 10/9 -- I made a mistake in my working<br>>>before.  The chord does sound worse in 31-eq than 1/5 comma meantone or<br>>>schismic temperament, probably because of the poor 9/8.  However, that<br>>>interval isn't so bad as to be unimportant.  I don't see that its<br>>>proximity to 10/9 makes it _more_ dissonant, but maybe nobody else does<br>>>either.  The chord sounds worse in golden meantone, implying that G-A<br>>>really should be 9/8 and not 10/9.<br><br>>Can you flesh out exactly how you see that one implies the other? Don't<br>>forget that the 28/25 is naturally closer to a 9/8 than a 10/9, so<br>>tuning it to a 10/9 means you've had to distort the other intervals<br>>more.<br><br>Golden and 1/5 comma meantone (or 43-equal) are roughly as good in the<br>7-limit.  So, any difference in this chord is likely to be a result of<br>the poorer 9-limit approximation to 9/8.  Between 31-equal and golden<br>meantone, it is less clear.  I generally find the 4-6-9 chord works in<br>31-eq, but not in golden meantone, suggesting the 9/4 is well enough<br>tuned in 31-eq, but not in golden.  However, I find 7-limit harmony<br>usually does work in golden.  So, if this chord is poor it's probably<br>because of the 9-limit interval.  To confirm this suspicion, I did this:<br><br>>>I find that G-Eb-A-C# and Eb-G-C#-A sound better than A-Eb-G-C# and<br>>>Eb-A-C#-G in 31-eq.  In golden meantone, they all have roughly the same<br>>>consonance.  I suggest this is because of the 9/4 vs 10/5.<br><br>>Come again?<br><br>That should have been 9/5 rather than 10/5.<br><br>If you stretch the tone to be a major 9th, it will be interpreted as a<br>9/4 rather than a 20/9.  If you make it a minor 7th, it will be a 9/5<br>rather than 16/9.  So, inversions with a major 9th should sound better<br>than those with a minor 7th if the 9-limit approximation holds.  I think<br>this is the case in 31-eq, although this is all subjective.  To be sure<br>it's the approximation to 9/8 and octave equivalents that's making the<br>difference, I tried in golden meantone, where the tone approximates the<br>less consonant 10/9 better.  Then, there was no contrast in dissonance<br>between the inversions.  So, the 9-limit approximation is probably<br>relevant in 31-eq.<br><br><br>>>The 31-eq 9/8 and 28/25 both being sharp is the most relevant thing<br>>>here.  Ideally, the tempered interval should be between the two just<br>>>ones for them to both be well tuned.<br><br>>Er, do you really think 28/25 is any kind of "just" interval in the<br>>sense of being a "target" you could really aim for without tuning the<br>>other intervals in the chord?<br><br>Firstly, I got sharp and flat mixed up there.  9/8 is flat in 31=, or<br>sharp in JI relative to 31=.<br><br>28/25 is just in the sense of being an integer ratio.<br><br>If the other intervals are just, the tone will be exactly 28/25.  We are<br>tempering the chord so that the tone looks more like 9/8.  If the tone<br>looks less like 9/8 this isn't a good way of tempering: we'd be better<br>off in JI.  So, taking this chord in isolation, there's no point in<br>tuning it to 31-eq.  However, if you have some other reason for using<br>31-eq, the chord does work.<br><br>Now, it may be that 28/25 _is_ perceived as a consonance it itself.<br>However, considering its proximity to 9/8 I see no way of testing this.<br><br>>>I need to do more listening to be sure of these things.
