The formula will vary <br>according to the just (beatless) interval which a tempered interval most <br>nearly approximates. Let's represent the just interval as "x/y", and <br>indicate the size of the tempered interval close to this as "t"; the <br>frequency of the lower pitch in  the interval t we shall call "f". In <br>this case the upper pitch of t will be ft. Take harmonic number y of the <br>upper pitch, which will have the frequency fty, and subtract from this <br>the harmonic number x of the lower pitch, which will have the frequency <br>fx, i.e. f(ty - x). A positive result means that the tempered interval <br>is sharper than the neighbouring just interval, and a negative result <br>will signify flatness.<br><br>To give an example: say you wish to find the rate at which the 12-TET <br>fifth above A = 220Hz beats. In this case x = 3, y = 2, t = 2^(7/12) and <br>f = 220. You will then have to calculate 220(2[2^(7/12)] - 3). The <br>result is  nearly -0.75, so you should listen for 3 beats every 4 <br>seconds.<br><br>I hope this enables you to complete your task, Lorenzo.
