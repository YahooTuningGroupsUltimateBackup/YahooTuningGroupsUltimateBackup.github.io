Were this so, then even the simplest<br>of our melodies would disintegrate into unrecognizable, essentially<br>different melodies every time a different singer rendered them. This<br>does happen if the singers are extremely unskilful, or simply bored with<br>the old melody, but never as a matter of course. For even skilled<br>singers occasionally stray from whatever tuning be taken as standard, by<br>at least a comma. Note in passing that this means the melodic limen -<br>the zone within which intervals retain a unique melodic character -<br>would be more than double a comma, for if a singer strays by so much as<br>half the melodic limen, he enters the melodic orbit, as it were, of the<br>adjacent degree of the temperament being used.<br><br>But let us grant, for the sake of argument, that we _could_ train<br>singers to reliably and continually make such hyperfine distinctions as<br>10-20-30-40 cents ? far beyond anything known to the Arabs or Indians<br>(known in practice not in theory) ? what would be the result?<br><br>Well, singers that actually do make such distinctions - though quite at<br>random - are not uncommon. In Western musical cultures they are said to<br>be 'tone-deaf', 'incapable of carrying a tune' etc. A rock or opera<br>singer so afflicted would be booed and hissed off stage within about 30<br>seconds.<br><br>It occurs to me that there might seem to be a logical inconsistency<br>between saying that listeners do not perceive a melody to be changed<br>until at least one of its notes has been changed by at least 55-60<br>cents, and then observing that listeners notice even smaller variations<br>and dislike them. But in fact there is no inconsistency; the human mind<br>seems to desire that melody consist of definite pitch classes, about<br>which there should be no doubt. If more than a very few notes of a<br>melody betray these expectations by threatening to careen into the<br>adjacent pitch class, the effect is heard as a mistuned interval. There<br>is an immense difference between hearing a variation in pitch, and<br>hearing a variation in pitch class and therefore in melody.<br><br>I do not wish to refer here to what non-Western musical cultures label<br>as 'non-music' or 'without tune' for despite my acquaintance with<br>certain of these cultures I certainly do not consider myself qualified<br>to pass judgement thereon, and I doubt if any Westerner is. But within<br>the Western musical culture, which no less in popular than in academic<br>music, is the dominant musical force of our time, the performer trained<br>to deliberately and continually make such 10-20-30-40 cent distinctions<br>- if this is possible, which I do not believe - would be hilariously<br>laughed at by the people. I doubt if even the cowed audiences of our<br>concert halls would refrain from giggling.<br><br>Perhaps some would be delighted to have another reason to consider the<br>populace morons, and themselves, great artists (unappreciated of<br>course.) But a musical culture which deliberately courts popular disdain<br>in so very aggressive a manner as deliberately singing like the<br>tone-deaf is... how to put it politely? gravely aberrant.<br><br>A more philosophical person might inquire: _why_ does the West, at<br>least, classify some people as 'unable to carry a tune'? Because in the<br>West at least - and this includes rock music no less than older music -<br>listeners expect most notes at any rate to possess a definite, memorable<br>pitch. Music in all the major musical cultures definitely consists of<br>more-or-less fixed pitches, not of pitches free to wander with the same<br>kind of freedom and endless pitch variety we associate with the spoken<br>voice - though even there there is no absolute freedom.<br><br>I do not wish to be dogmatic here; there seem to be elements of this<br>free variation of pitch in some of the 'ornaments' of Indian music, for<br>example. But even the most ornamented Indian melody stands worlds apart<br>from the free pitch variation of the spoken voice. But this free pitch<br>variation in music is what is implied by the assertion that 10-20-30-40<br>cent intervals can be melodically significant.<br><br>Without falling into such absurdities, it is possible to argue that the<br>melodic limen of 55-60 cents is incorrect, and the true limen is<br>(slightly) narrower (or wider.) In the literature one can find values<br>from the mid forties all the way up to nearly an equal semitone (the<br>latter group rather untrustworthy) depending partly on the pitch at<br>which the measurements are taken. It is possible that a people trained<br>from childhood to focus most of their musical attention on enharmonic<br>melody alone might score a few cents lower than a people accustomed to<br>pentatonic melody, say. It would be very impractical for music to set<br>the melodic limen so low that any very large part of a typical audience<br>could not readily identify melodic changes. In this respect the true<br>debate is not between the advocates of 19-tone equal and those of some<br>system with a larger number of degrees, but between the advocates of 19-<br>versus those of 12-tone equal. I am convinced that the melodic limen is<br>narrow enough so that the ~63 cent tuning degree of 19-tone equal does<br>always, save perhaps in the very low register (well outside the vocal<br>range), effect a change in melody when a given note of a melody is<br>flatted or sharped by this interval.<br><br>But to argue that the melodic limen is so narrow as virtually not to<br>exist, involves us in the severe logical and esthetic difficulties I<br>have referred to.<br><br>For all these reasons we can state categorically that the melodic limen<br>exists, and is not more than marginally susceptible of adjustment<br>downwards by training or special attainment.<br><br>More than casually related to the question of the melodic limen is the<br>determination of how many distinct pitches (or pitch classes) human<br>subjects can remember in a given melody. This number is finite, and<br>almost certainly lies between 5 and 9, apparently influenced by the<br>musical culture. The weight of the evidence favors a value of 7 or 8. I<br>trust I need not dig out the references to this experiment from my files<br>- it is a locus classicus. The human mind possesses marvelous powers of<br>discrimination, but the musician who continually demands that listeners<br>stretch their discriminatory powers beyond what is pleasurable (or<br>possible) for them will pay for his folly.<br><br>The best possible thing for a creative artist, you know, is to be hissed<br>at a few times. This concentrates the mind wonderfully, and purges the<br>understanding of many silly notions. Our poor rock musicians,<br>disrespected and for the most part ignored, have all had this privilege<br>of being called inventive names in public, which is one reason why they<br>are so very creative, and beloved by the common folk. They may suffer<br>personally because of this, but their art is basically sane and mature<br>(or as mature as it can be without the benefit of any coherent body of<br>theory or intonation to guide them.) Academic musicians on the other<br>hand live in a kind of cocoon, which they often try to break out of by<br>deliberately adopting the most esthetically bankrupt musical principles<br>they can find.<br><br>Both kinds of musician like to be thought daring and iconoclastic. But<br>the daring of a rock vocalist who shimmies his hips while occasionally<br>throwing in a 1/3 tone, all the while watching to see if the audience<br>likes him, and if he's going to eat that night... and the daring of the<br>safely tenured academic who demands that some singer screech like a cat<br>for a bunch of bored, vaguely offended symphony-goers, really have<br>nothing in common at all.<br><br>I have deliberately exaggerated to make a point. Academic musicians<br>possess advantages that popular musicians can never hope to have. But<br>the greatest advantage of all is an audience that worships your every<br>note. And this is denied to those who imagine themselves musical gods,<br>and ordinary people beneath notice.<br><br>How is all this relevant to tuning questions? The system of intonation<br>is one of the two or three most basic elements of music. It is not<br>chosen by people seeking to puzzle or shock, or even by lonely souls<br>experimenting with new systems in a vacuum. It is chosen by the culture<br>itself because creative musicians, in intimate contact with the people,<br>want and need that system of intonation. I am convinced our people need<br>the 19-tone equal temperament in order to express on instruments (and<br>hence more consciously and richly) what they are already expressing in<br>their songs. As a side-benefit, this temperament also gives us back our<br>own musical past, which 12-tone equal has grossly distorted and<br>ossified.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  A Parlor Trick<br>PostedDate:  13-12-97 22:36:20<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  13-12-97 22:34:28-13-12-97 22:34:29,13-12-97 22:34:11-13-12-97 22:34:13<br>DeliveredDate:  13-12-97 22:34:13<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656C.00768147; Sat, 13 Dec 1997 22:36:19 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14651; Sat, 13 Dec 1997 22:36:20 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 13 Dec 1997 22:36:20 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14656<br>Received: (qmail 22517 invoked from network); 13 Dec 1997 13:36:17 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 13 Dec 1997 13:36:17 -0800<br>Message-Id: <3493624F.6ED8@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Liminatory Fulminations</h1><h3><a id=6612 href="#6612">ðŸ”—</a>Gregg Gibson &#x3C;ggibson@ww-interlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/1997 12:52:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>In response to my statement that the melodic limen of music is 55-60<br>cents, and that universally for the human species in general (not for<br>aliens of course) several persons have, with varying degrees of impotent<br>outrage, asserted that people - or at least the musical elite - can be<br>trained to make essential melodic distinctions as fine as 10-20 cents.<br><br>I do not believe this for a moment.
