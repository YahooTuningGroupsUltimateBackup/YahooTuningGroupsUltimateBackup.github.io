Nevertheless, she said, pi is precisly<br>defined by mathematics to be "3.14159, plus as many more digits as you<br>have time to calculate".<br><br>"I think that it is the mathematicians that are being irrational, and<br>it is time for them to admit it," said Lawson.

"We need to return to some absolutes<br>in our society," he said, "the Bible does not say that the font was<br>thirty-something cubits.  Plain reading says thirty cubits.

"Pi is<br>merely an artifact of Euclidean geometry."   Humbleys is working on a<br>theory which he says will prove that pi is determined by the geometry<br>of three-dimensional space, which is assumed by physicists to be<br>"isotropic", or the same in all directions.<br><br>"There are other geometries, and pi is different in every one of them,"<br>says Humbleys.  Scientists have arbitrarily assumed that space is<br>Euclidean, he says.  He points out that a circle drawn on a spherical<br>surface has a different value for the ratio of circumfence to<br>diameter.  "Anyone with a compass, flexible ruler, and globe can see<br>for themselves," suggests Humbleys, "its not exactly rocket science."<br><br>Roger Learned, a Solomon Society member who was in Montgomery to<br>support the bill, agrees.  He said that pi is nothing more than an<br>assumption by the mathematicians and engineers who were there to argue<br>against the bill. "These nabobs waltzed into the capital with an<br>arrogance that was breathtaking," Learned said.  "Their prefatorial<br>deficit resulted in a polemical stance at absolute contraposition to<br>the legislature's puissance."<br><br>Some education experts believe that the legislation will affect the way<br>math is taught to Alabama's children. One member of the state<br>school board, Lily Ponja, is anxious to get the new value of pi into<br>the state's math textbooks, but thinks that the old value should be<br>retained as an alternative.
