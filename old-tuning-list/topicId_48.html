Marpurg,<br>however, was still wrong.  The passage in question here is, admittedly,<br>sloppy work on the part of Marpurg.  As anyone familiar with his work in<br>temperament knows, this is not characteristic of Marpurg's work, where he<br>is one of the most precise writers in 18th-century Germany.<br><br>>(It is curious to me that, while you insist the evidence is unambiguous,<br>>you resort to interpretations and speculations like this one and the one<br>>below.)<br><br>I have spent many years reading the primary sources.  In writing my<br>dissertation, I've read all of Marpurg, all of Kirnberger and everyone else<br>that dealt with tuning and temperament in Germany.  Undoubtedly, I've<br>missed some sources.  But not a lot, I trust.  Unlike today, when scientific<br>writing tends to adhere to the "stylus dragneticus," 18th-century German<br>scientific writing was very personal (there are exceptions) and one quickly<br>becomes almost "personally" familiar with the writer.
