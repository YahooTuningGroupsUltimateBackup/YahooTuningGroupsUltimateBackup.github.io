This rather remarkable composer was born in<br>Manchester in 1880 and died of cholera in Calcutta in 1939.<br>His works have been much forgotten. I read his name somewhere in the<br>New Grove and have one record (Quartetto Intimo, Quartetto Geniale,<br>Aquarelles). This information is from the booklet.<br>He wrote a wide range of music: 10 string quartets, a cello concerto<br>and sonata, symphonic poems, a concert opera, music for piano and<br>orchestra, 9 suites, theatre music, a gigantic World Requiem with 1200<br>singers and instrumentalists, and so on. He also published a book,<br>"Music To-day".<br>John Foulds was the first British composer to use quarter-tones, as<br>early as the 1890s. He had a deep fascination with oriental music,<br>especially from India. This led him to compose with ancient Greek<br>modes, nondiatonic scales and Hindu ragas, as in "Ghandarva-Music"<br>(1915-1926) for piano. Later he also wrote for ensembles of Indian<br>instruments and combination of Indian instruments with a western<br>symphony orchestra.<br>Perhaps for us the most interesting is the "Lyra Celtica" concerto for<br>wordless voice and orchestra (1920?), which features a microtonal<br>tuning of 22 tones to the octave (which anyone? srutis maybe).<br>There's no recording. Several of his works still await their first<br>performance. He wrote works in more traditional genres as well, which<br>show diverse influences as of Busoni, Scriabin and Bartok.<br>In 1935 he travelled to India, where he collected Indian folk-music,<br>became director of European Music for all-India Radio at Delhi,<br>created an orchestra from scratch, and began to work towards a musical<br>synthesis of the cultures of East and West.<br>The record above mentioned was made with assistance of the British<br>Music Society.
