Sure, that is an issue, but once we have a <br>tuning we like, can we COMPOSE something in it that is meaningful and <br>profound? For example, and I hope I do not insult anyone here, I have an <br>album by a pianist named Michael Harrison...he plays a piano tuned <br>purely, and has 24 notes to the octave. In the liner notes, he talks very <br>profoundly about the effects of pure tuning, and about his studies with <br>various people in the field of pure tunings, etc. Only problem for me is <br>this: on a musical, technical, compositional level, the album is <br>incredibly boring because of the lack of interesting compositions and <br>playing. The album seems to be composed of a few simple chordal motifs, <br>with song structures that sound, to me, like ideas a beginning guitarist <br>would come up with as he/she is discovering the harmonized major scale. <br>And again, I am only trying to be honest here...I do not want to insult a <br>fellow musician out of spite, or whatever...if I write something less <br>than inspiring, I would expect someone to say so as well.<br>    OK...so the tuning is marvelous, in tune, and all that...now, write <br>some music that is challenging, profound, and interesting on deep levels. <br>I, at this stage of my career, am not impressed by basic chordal <br>structures that sound like a beginning musician. The craft of composition <br>is deep and challenging, and is a subject that many folks have not done a <br>whole lot with. Simplicity is fine, but simple music does not necessarily <br>mean cliched or unimaginative. Again, that is my main complaint about a <br>lot of "just" music...it sounds like the composer is more fascinated with <br>the purity of the tuning, rather than the final result of the <br>composition.<br>    As far as tuning my 34 tone guitar...I approach this stuff fairly <br>intuitively, so here's what I do. I tune it like a regular 12 tone <br>instrument (as I do all of my guitars, 19 and 31 as well). This means the <br>following: the B string is in tune with the  two E strings, and is the <br>5th of said strings. When I play a G chord, the open B string is one <br>increment sharp (comma) to the G, so I have to flat this B by one fret to <br>be in tune on the G chord. Because of my background in blues (32 years), <br>many of the things I like to do involve riffs/patterns that are based off <br>of the "standard" 12 tone tuning...I don't want to mess with changing <br>that phenomenon at this stage of my career, so I work within that <br>framework...on 34, this is really tricky because of said comma, but it is <br>a personal choice, and works well for me...others may have better luck <br>with alternative ways of tuning...and what DOES Catler do, by the <br>way, when he tunes his axe?...Hstick<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 16 May 1997 16:27 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03868; Fri, 16 May 1997 16:27:23 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 16 May 1997 16:27:23 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03866<br>Received: (qmail 18923 invoked from network); 16 May 1997 14:27:19 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 16 May 1997 14:27:19 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.95.970516102415.27430A-100000@u3.farm.idt.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>which tuning is best/tuning in 34 eq</h1><h3><a id=5483 href="#5483">ðŸ”—</a>Aline Surman &#x3C;stick@dnvr.uswest.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/1997 6:28:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Once again, Finnamore's comments are very interesting, but to me, <br>the point is NOT which tuning resonates best with humanity (I am <br>paraphrasing his comments).
