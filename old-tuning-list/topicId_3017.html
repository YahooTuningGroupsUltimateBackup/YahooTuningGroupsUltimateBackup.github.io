Todd keehn of<br>Denver<br>>Colorado did the work. Todd does excellent work, unfortunately, last I<br>heard<br>>was carpal tunnel syndrome had slow his luthiership down to a crawl. In any<br>>case, the Strat sounds nothing like a classic Strat now. It got more<br>sustain<br>>and timbrally it's much more monochromatic and doesn't have that twang<br>fenders<br>>have. The P-bass still sounds and plays like a p-bass. I've lent these<br>>instruments to a number of excellent musicians and they really like them,<br>>also. The necks also were made with a flat radius.<br>><br>>I've also got a great double neck Gibson Lee steel guitar form the early<br>60's<br>>(I think from the early 60's) It has an amazingly warm sound. I run it<br>through<br>>a Hughes and Kettner Triamp into an old Rodgers tone cabinet (from the 50's<br>I<br>>think). The sound is so rich. I've got that thing usually tuned to and open<br>>19tet tuning.<br>><br>>On the synth side of things I've got a Kurzweil K2000 with a sampler.<br>That's<br>>also usually tuned to 19tet. It's a great synth but after playing around<br>with<br>>it for a couple of years I've got to say that digitally produced synth<br>music<br>>leaves me at best luke warm. Even guys that are really excellent with them<br>>like Brian Eno and the Orb or Tricky don't produce music with them that I<br>can<br>>really totally get into. And this is not a criticism of them at all it's<br>>a criticism of the instruments. It's a shame that we don't have acoustic<br>>instruments or electro acoustic instruments available to us more readily<br>and<br>>ones that are readily playable. In my opinion so much of music has nothing<br>to<br>>do with the tuning and has to do with the feel the musician puts behind the<br>>notes. Compare the sound of a great digital synth to a Hammond B-3 or a<br>>Wurlitzer electric piano and it's dissapointing. The Hammond or Wurlitzer<br>>tends to evince musical phrases and nuance but with the Kurzweil I always<br>have<br>>felt like I'm sitting behind a glass pane watching music arise in the next<br>>room. This, of course, is only my experience.<br>><br>>I've got bunch of other 12tet instruments but that's for another time.<br>><br>><br>>Denis<br>><br>>------------------------------<br>><br>>Topic No. 2<br>><br>>Date: Wed, 7 Jan 1998 15:07:06 -0500 (EST)<br>>From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA><br>>To: Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com><br>>Subject: Re: Hexany article, etc.<br>>Message-ID:<br><Pine.SOL.3.96.980107143730.24759B-100000@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA><br>><br>>I was afraid someone would ask what Musicworks 60 is, and I'd have to<br>>explain.

If the lead is singing the 7, then usually the<br>>tenor has the melody.  There are many songs where the melody contains no<br>>pitches outside the 3-limit.  What is important is that the melody is not<br>>really part of the voice leading in the traditional sense, except in the<br>>case of sustained notes.  Chords are built _on_ it.  What follows in this<br>>post may help to clear the issue up.<br>><br>>>>}I think that most people recognize that barbershop harmonies sound<br>>>>better than piano harmonies.  If you can hear the difference, doesn't<br>>>>that make it a "perceptually distinct pitch set"?

Mr. Erlich's "pitch set", as used above, is something very<br>>different.  If I am not mistaken, he uses the term "pitch set" above to<br>>touch on a model that describes a certain aspect of music:  Where harmony<br>>and melody interact in a Special Way.<br>><br>>What is this Special Way?  Krumhansl, quoted by Mr. Erlich, seems to be<br>>touching on it: "If chord construction is determined in some principled way<br>>by scale structure, then this further serves to maintain the tonal<br>>framework for encoding pitch information."<br>><br>>Most western classical music happens to work in this Special Way, and the<br>>thing it uses to do it is the diatonic scale.  Mr. Erlich's goal, if I'm<br>>not mistaken, is to find a new scale suitable for use in this Special Way.<br>><br>>To recap so far, I am using "Special Way" to mean a way of explaining<br>>beauty in music from how melody and harmony are related, a construct<br>>heretobefore unknown to music theory, at least at the level Mr. Erlich<br>>takes it.  In his paper, it is called "Generalizing diatonicity".  I<br>>suggest this is an unfortunate term, as it implies the diatonic scale,<br>>which is exactly what he wants to replace, kind of how "octave" isn't a<br>>good way to say "2/1", since it implies 12-tone...<br>><br>>>I think Schonberg may have been right that diatonicism had been played<br>>>out, but in abandoning the concepts of tonality and scale he threw the<br>>>baby out with the bathwater.<br>><br>>..Here, Mr. Erlich uses the words "tonality and scale" to mean Special<br>>Way.  His post then translates: "I think Schonberg may have been right that<br>>the diatonic scale has been exhausted as a tool for making music in the<br>>Special Way, but he threw out the Special Way, which wasn't what was used<br>up."<br>><br>>Now follows a review of his paper, which hopes, it seems, to show just how<br>>the Special Way isn't used up, and just how you can tune an instrument<br>>that'll make the Special Way seem as new as 1998.<br>><br>>---------------------------------------------------------------<br>><br>>The author starts by observing that the Western Music is 5-limit, and,<br>>following the "music evolves up the harmonic series" thing, sets his sights<br>>on the 7-limit.<br>><br>>He then defines a set of scales as candidates for representing the 7-limit.<br>> These scales are assumed to be root of 2 equal-step tunings, with only one<br>>pitch per 7-limit approximation.<br>><br>>The one pitch per approximation thing is necessary for the Special Way to<br>>work, as far as I can tell.  I can't quite tell you how, but I have a gut<br>>feeling it is, and since the Special Way is what we're after, I won't argue<br>>it.  Besides, it keeps the size of the pitch set manageable.<br>><br>>The root of 2 part is understandable, considering that we need strong low<br>>identies for our 7's to work.  This seems contradictory to the rule that<br>>the higher identities are more sensitive to mistuning, since there are more<br>>low-numbered fractions near them.  Indeed it is, and perhaps it is a<br>>counterbalance to this principle.  The paper offers only that "octave<br>>equivalence seems pervasive" and that it is "universally perceived, even by<br>>some animals".<br>><br>>The matter of mistuning is far from clear, even touching back on our old<br>>bone about unknowingly passing low-numbered ratios when measuring cent<br>>detuning of an interval.  Paul's paper addresses this by making the<br>>standard deviation in log-frequency detuning inversely proportional to the<br>>limit of the interval.  Not ideal, but better than any other method I've<br>>been able to think of, and good enough for root of 2 equal tunings from 12<br>>to 31.<br>><br>>The equal-step part is the most dubious.  The Special Way has always been<br>>based on temperament of some kind, and it seems that only Bog or God can<br>>decide if all those schkissmas need to disappear for it to work, insomuch<br>>as Mr. Erlich has never shown it.  He has mentioned, on this digest, some<br>>modulatory effects that require two D's to be the same note, etc, but this<br>>is a problem of trying to retune music already written.  That Special Way<br>>music cannot be written for JI, complete with its own list of modulatory<br>>effects impossible in a temperament, has not been demonstrated.<br>><br>>So the list of scales comes down to 22, 26, 27, and 31 tone equal<br>temperament.<br>><br>>Then are listed criteria for determining a scale's usefulness for the<br>>Special Way.  Since the Special Way is a relationship between a scale's<br>>melodic and harmonic usefulness, the criteria are separated in these two<br>>groups...<br>><br>>1. Melodic.  In Paul's paper we have maximal evenness and tetrachordality.<br>>In Gibson-land, we have the melodic limen.  Jules Siegel proposed that the<br>>intervals should get smaller as you go up the scale.  None of these<br>>convince me in the least even that a scale can "work" melodically.  Maybe<br>>the most useful thing I've heard for describing the melodic properties of a<br>>scale is "symmetry".  I will accept, however, that the criteria used by Mr.<br>>Erlich are, "enough to ensure an intelligible melodic framework".<br>><br>>2. Harmonic.  Now we're talking.  This is where the real relations between<br>>melodic and harmonic are drawn...<br>>   (a)"There exists a pattern of intervals" ... "which produces a complete,<br>>consonant chord on most scale degrees"<br>>   (b)"The majority of consonant chords have a root that lies" the best<br>>approximation of a 3/2 "away from another consonant chord"<br>>   (c)"A chord progression of no more than three consonant chords is<br>>required to cover the entire scale"<br>><br>>..in what would be letter "d", Mr. Erlich makes use of a term I do not<br>>understand: "characteristic dissonance".  He defines it to be any dissonant<br>>interval that shares the same number of scale steps as a consonant<br>>interval.  Shadings of dissonance aside, what kind of scale steps we<br>>talkin'?  The example of the diminished 5th is given, but why it should be<br>>considered a type of 5th, or why the P5 should not be considered a 7th is<br>>not made clear.<br>><br>>   (e)The rarest intervals in the scale should be located next to notes in<br>>the tonic chord.  Like leading tones.<br>><br>>What would be "f" makes use again of the term "characteristic dissonance".<br>><br>>The number of scales fitting these criteria is shown to be few.  Among them<br>>are the 5-limit diatonic and the 3-limit pentatonic, two scales proven over<br>>hundreds of years to be great for the Special Way.  While this shouldn't<br>>come as much of a surprise, considering the author admits to basing his<br>>criteria on the success of these scales, any time such a unique set of<br>>properties can be found, they're probably worth looking into.<br>><br>>Finally, it is shown that the decatonic scale in 22TET fits the criteria<br>well.<br>><br>>So has the paper provided a good definition of the Special Way?  Yes.  Has<br>>it succeeded in convincing me that the Special Way is still good, and that<br>>the 22TET decatonic scale is a fresh vehicle for it?  Without a doubt.<br>>What it hasn't provided is a name for the Special Way.  Maybe "tonality" is<br>>best, but I didn't use it because it has so many other meanings.<br>><br>>------------------------------------------------------------------<br>><br>>That's the review, and I would like to thank Mr. Erlich in advance for<br>>letting me quote his paper.  All material from the paper is in quotes,<br>>exactly as it appeared on John Starrett's web site.  All spelling mistakes<br>>are probably mine.  I encourage the reader to get the paper for himself, as<br>>it is well-written and highly self-explanatory (you wouldn't know it :~)<br>><br>>So, to wrap up: Is Barbershop music that uses the Special Way?  If so, what<br>>is the vehicle?  Diatonic, decatonic, or maybe JI complete with, as I say,<br>>"modulatory effects impossible in temperament?"<br>><br>>I say that Barbershop lies on the fence between using the Special Way and<br>>not.  In a pinch, I'd say it does use it.  If it does, it's diatonic, for<br>>sure.  It is *not* my JI Special Way.<br>><br>>Now comes the last issue.  Every time I make it, Mr. Erlich accuses me of<br>>not having understood his paper.  I hope that the above review will at<br>>least make it plain what I do and don't understand.<br>><br>>Is the Special Way the only way to make interesting music?  No.  Is there<br>>another way already demonstrated?  Yes.  I gave Barbershop and an excerpt<br>>of the YES tune "Sound Chaser" as examples of melody and chords coming from<br>>different pitch sets, as this is the most obvious way to rule out any<br>>Special Way effects.  But the Barbershop example really doesn't satisfy, as<br>>we've seen, and the YES example is brief.<br>><br>>Serialism is certainly devoid of the Special Way -- and no doubt there is<br>>good serialism to be done -- but it is also lacks consonance.<br>><br>>Far out avant garde music is certainly lacking of Special Way, if not other<br>>things.<br>><br>>Indian chamber music and Bagpipe music are good examples, but they stay<br>>inside one tonality, the fundamental of which is played on a drone.

Todd keehn of<br>Denver<br>>Colorado did the work. Todd does excellent work, unfortunately, last I<br>heard<br>>was carpal tunnel syndrome had slow his luthiership down to a crawl. In any<br>>case, the Strat sounds nothing like a classic Strat now. It got more<br>sustain<br>>and timbrally it's much more monochromatic and doesn't have that twang<br>fenders<br>>have. The P-bass still sounds and plays like a p-bass. I've lent these<br>>instruments to a number of excellent musicians and they really like them,<br>>also. The necks also were made with a flat radius.<br>><br>>I've also got a great double neck Gibson Lee steel guitar form the early<br>60's<br>>(I think from the early 60's) It has an amazingly warm sound. I run it<br>through<br>>a Hughes and Kettner Triamp into an old Rodgers tone cabinet (from the 50's<br>I<br>>think). The sound is so rich. I've got that thing usually tuned to and open<br>>19tet tuning.<br>><br>>On the synth side of things I've got a Kurzweil K2000 with a sampler.<br>That's<br>>also usually tuned to 19tet. It's a great synth but after playing around<br>with<br>>it for a couple of years I've got to say that digitally produced synth<br>music<br>>leaves me at best luke warm. Even guys that are really excellent with them<br>>like Brian Eno and the Orb or Tricky don't produce music with them that I<br>can<br>>really totally get into. And this is not a criticism of them at all it's<br>>a criticism of the instruments. It's a shame that we don't have acoustic<br>>instruments or electro acoustic instruments available to us more readily<br>and<br>>ones that are readily playable. In my opinion so much of music has nothing<br>to<br>>do with the tuning and has to do with the feel the musician puts behind the<br>>notes. Compare the sound of a great digital synth to a Hammond B-3 or a<br>>Wurlitzer electric piano and it's dissapointing. The Hammond or Wurlitzer<br>>tends to evince musical phrases and nuance but with the Kurzweil I always<br>have<br>>felt like I'm sitting behind a glass pane watching music arise in the next<br>>room.

Mr. Erlich's "pitch set", as used above, is something very<br>>different.  If I am not mistaken, he uses the term "pitch set" above to<br>>touch on a model that describes a certain aspect of music:  Where harmony<br>>and melody interact in a Special Way.<br>><br>>What is this Special Way?  Krumhansl, quoted by Mr. Erlich, seems to be<br>>touching on it: "If chord construction is determined in some principled way<br>>by scale structure, then this further serves to maintain the tonal<br>>framework for encoding pitch information."<br>><br>>Most western classical music happens to work in this Special Way, and the<br>>thing it uses to do it is the diatonic scale.  Mr. Erlich's goal, if I'm<br>>not mistaken, is to find a new scale suitable for use in this Special Way.<br>><br>>To recap so far, I am using "Special Way" to mean a way of explaining<br>>beauty in music from how melody and harmony are related, a construct<br>>heretobefore unknown to music theory, at least at the level Mr. Erlich<br>>takes it.  In his paper, it is called "Generalizing diatonicity".  I<br>>suggest this is an unfortunate term, as it implies the diatonic scale,<br>>which is exactly what he wants to replace, kind of how "octave" isn't a<br>>good way to say "2/1", since it implies 12-tone...<br>><br>>>I think Schonberg may have been right that diatonicism had been played<br>>>out, but in abandoning the concepts of tonality and scale he threw the<br>>>baby out with the bathwater.<br>><br>>..Here, Mr. Erlich uses the words "tonality and scale" to mean Special<br>>Way.  His post then translates: "I think Schonberg may have been right that<br>>the diatonic scale has been exhausted as a tool for making music in the<br>>Special Way, but he threw out the Special Way, which wasn't what was used<br>up."<br>><br>>Now follows a review of his paper, which hopes, it seems, to show just how<br>>the Special Way isn't used up, and just how you can tune an instrument<br>>that'll make the Special Way seem as new as 1998.<br>><br>>---------------------------------------------------------------<br>><br>>The author starts by observing that the Western Music is 5-limit, and,<br>>following the "music evolves up the harmonic series" thing, sets his sights<br>>on the 7-limit.<br>><br>>He then defines a set of scales as candidates for representing the 7-limit.<br>> These scales are assumed to be root of 2 equal-step tunings, with only one<br>>pitch per 7-limit approximation.<br>><br>>The one pitch per approximation thing is necessary for the Special Way to<br>>work, as far as I can tell.  I can't quite tell you how, but I have a gut<br>>feeling it is, and since the Special Way is what we're after, I won't argue<br>>it.  Besides, it keeps the size of the pitch set manageable.<br>><br>>The root of 2 part is understandable, considering that we need strong low<br>>identies for our 7's to work.  This seems contradictory to the rule that<br>>the higher identities are more sensitive to mistuning, since there are more<br>>low-numbered fractions near them.  Indeed it is, and perhaps it is a<br>>counterbalance to this principle.  The paper offers only that "octave<br>>equivalence seems pervasive" and that it is "universally perceived, even by<br>>some animals".<br>><br>>The matter of mistuning is far from clear, even touching back on our old<br>>bone about unknowingly passing low-numbered ratios when measuring cent<br>>detuning of an interval.  Paul's paper addresses this by making the<br>>standard deviation in log-frequency detuning inversely proportional to the<br>>limit of the interval.  Not ideal, but better than any other method I've<br>>been able to think of, and good enough for root of 2 equal tunings from 12<br>>to 31.<br>><br>>The equal-step part is the most dubious.  The Special Way has always been<br>>based on temperament of some kind, and it seems that only Bog or God can<br>>decide if all those schkissmas need to disappear for it to work, insomuch<br>>as Mr. Erlich has never shown it.  He has mentioned, on this digest, some<br>>modulatory effects that require two D's to be the same note, etc, but this<br>>is a problem of trying to retune music already written.  That Special Way<br>>music cannot be written for JI, complete with its own list of modulatory<br>>effects impossible in a temperament, has not been demonstrated.<br>><br>>So the list of scales comes down to 22, 26, 27, and 31 tone equal<br>temperament.<br>><br>>Then are listed criteria for determining a scale's usefulness for the<br>>Special Way.  Since the Special Way is a relationship between a scale's<br>>melodic and harmonic usefulness, the criteria are separated in these two<br>>groups...<br>><br>>1. Melodic.  In Paul's paper we have maximal evenness and tetrachordality.<br>>In Gibson-land, we have the melodic limen.  Jules Siegel proposed that the<br>>intervals should get smaller as you go up the scale.  None of these<br>>convince me in the least even that a scale can "work" melodically.  Maybe<br>>the most useful thing I've heard for describing the melodic properties of a<br>>scale is "symmetry".  I will accept, however, that the criteria used by Mr.<br>>Erlich are, "enough to ensure an intelligible melodic framework".<br>><br>>2. Harmonic.  Now we're talking.  This is where the real relations between<br>>melodic and harmonic are drawn...<br>>   (a)"There exists a pattern of intervals" ... "which produces a complete,<br>>consonant chord on most scale degrees"<br>>   (b)"The majority of consonant chords have a root that lies" the best<br>>approximation of a 3/2 "away from another consonant chord"<br>>   (c)"A chord progression of no more than three consonant chords is<br>>required to cover the entire scale"<br>><br>>..in what would be letter "d", Mr. Erlich makes use of a term I do not<br>>understand: "characteristic dissonance".  He defines it to be any dissonant<br>>interval that shares the same number of scale steps as a consonant<br>>interval.  Shadings of dissonance aside, what kind of scale steps we<br>>talkin'?  The example of the diminished 5th is given, but why it should be<br>>considered a type of 5th, or why the P5 should not be considered a 7th is<br>>not made clear.<br>><br>>   (e)The rarest intervals in the scale should be located next to notes in<br>>the tonic chord.  Like leading tones.<br>><br>>What would be "f" makes use again of the term "characteristic dissonance".<br>><br>>The number of scales fitting these criteria is shown to be few.  Among them<br>>are the 5-limit diatonic and the 3-limit pentatonic, two scales proven over<br>>hundreds of years to be great for the Special Way.  While this shouldn't<br>>come as much of a surprise, considering the author admits to basing his<br>>criteria on the success of these scales, any time such a unique set of<br>>properties can be found, they're probably worth looking into.<br>><br>>Finally, it is shown that the decatonic scale in 22TET fits the criteria<br>well.<br>><br>>So has the paper provided a good definition of the Special Way?  Yes.  Has<br>>it succeeded in convincing me that the Special Way is still good, and that<br>>the 22TET decatonic scale is a fresh vehicle for it?  Without a doubt.<br>>What it hasn't provided is a name for the Special Way.  Maybe "tonality" is<br>>best, but I didn't use it because it has so many other meanings.<br>><br>>------------------------------------------------------------------<br>><br>>That's the review, and I would like to thank Mr. Erlich in advance for<br>>letting me quote his paper.  All material from the paper is in quotes,<br>>exactly as it appeared on John Starrett's web site.  All spelling mistakes<br>>are probably mine.  I encourage the reader to get the paper for himself, as<br>>it is well-written and highly self-explanatory (you wouldn't know it :~)<br>><br>>So, to wrap up: Is Barbershop music that uses the Special Way?  If so, what<br>>is the vehicle?  Diatonic, decatonic, or maybe JI complete with, as I say,<br>>"modulatory effects impossible in temperament?"<br>><br>>I say that Barbershop lies on the fence between using the Special Way and<br>>not.  In a pinch, I'd say it does use it.  If it does, it's diatonic, for<br>>sure.  It is *not* my JI Special Way.<br>><br>>Now comes the last issue.  Every time I make it, Mr. Erlich accuses me of<br>>not having understood his paper.  I hope that the above review will at<br>>least make it plain what I do and don't understand.<br>><br>>Is the Special Way the only way to make interesting music?  No.  Is there<br>>another way already demonstrated?  Yes.  I gave Barbershop and an excerpt<br>>of the YES tune "Sound Chaser" as examples of melody and chords coming from<br>>different pitch sets, as this is the most obvious way to rule out any<br>>Special Way effects.  But the Barbershop example really doesn't satisfy, as<br>>we've seen, and the YES example is brief.<br>><br>>Serialism is certainly devoid of the Special Way -- and no doubt there is<br>>good serialism to be done -- but it is also lacks consonance.<br>><br>>Far out avant garde music is certainly lacking of Special Way, if not other<br>>things.<br>><br>>Indian chamber music and Bagpipe music are good examples, but they stay<br>>inside one tonality, the fundamental of which is played on a drone.

This is the issue much more than cost, since adding<br>>the extra resolution in their custom ICs would be insignificant in terms of<br>>design resources and transistors.  DSP or Virtual Modeling type instruments<br>>could do better though.<br>><br>>You have to remember that manufacturers need to make a profit in order to<br>>stay in business, and most provide the bare minimum of features that they<br>>can get away with.

Today's synthesizers support hundreds of<br>>patches/programs, doing it that way virtually hard codes the tuning into<br>>the sample set and increases your memory requirements exponentially.  I<br>>don't think there's much question that most users prefer separate tuning<br>>tables, the issues are:<br>><br>>Do you want octave based tables?<br>>Do you want keyboard based tables?
