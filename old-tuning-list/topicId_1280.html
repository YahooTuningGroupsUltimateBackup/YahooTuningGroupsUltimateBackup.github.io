There is considerable evidence on <br>this point.  Forkel reports that Bach himself had<br>nothing but contempt for composers who worked<br>*only* this way; he called them "knights of the <br>keyboard."  The manuscripts of his uncompleted<br>compositions (notably the final contrapunctus<br>in The Art of Fugue) show that Bach often composed <br>by writing contrapuntal strands one after the<br>other, changing them as they intertwined, moving<br>forward a few notes at a time.  This is typical of<br>the way people compose when they hear the music<br>in their heads and write it down as it works itself<br>out.<br>On the other hand, there is cirumstantial evidence<br>to indicate that some of Bach's best-known works<br>were originally improvisations.  The Little Fugue<br>in G minor appears to have been composed shortly<br>after Bach visited Buxtehude; during the visit, he<br>improvised on a subject given him by Buxtehude.<br>It seems likely that the Little Fugue was that<br>improvisation, written down (this theory is<br>Burney's but it sounds probable).  The "Wedge<br>Fugue" has much of the character of an<br>improvisation to me and appears to date from<br>the period when Bach was trying out new organs.<br>Because Bach was considered a trivial composer<br>but was widely respected as a virtuoso<br>organist, he was much in demand as the "acid<br>test" for a newly-built organ.  If Bach said it<br>passed muster, the organ-builder could be<br>sure that the new instrument would stand up<br>to anything a lesser organist could throw at <br>it.  A wedge-like theme on the pedals is<br>exactly what I'd use to "try out the lungs"<br>of a new organ, so the "wedge" fugue is<br>almost certainly an improvisation Bach<br>performed during one of his "tryouts" at<br>this period. We also know from Forkel that<br>Bach loved nothing better than to yank out<br>all the stops and shake the church with a<br>massive blast of block chords, and the F Major <br>prelude sounds to these ears like the ultimate<br>in bone-shaking mind-blowing block chord<br>dissonance, so the F major prelude & fugue<br>was probably also an improvisations he cranked out <br>during a particularly challenging organ tryout.<br>What does this have to do with xenharmonics?<br>Well, as it happens Partch was also an<br>inveterate improviser.  I'm very surprised<br>that no one seems to realize this.  Improvisation<br>was an integral element of Partch's small-<br>ensemble composition process.  (By small<br>ensemble, I mean the compositions which<br>did *NOT* demand staging and libretti;<br>in short *NOT* the late large theater works.)<br>We know for a fact (as has been reported on<br>this forum) that Partch improvised the vocal<br>lines in the Li Po songs and then wrote them<br>down to give performers something to go by.<br>We know for a fact (because Partch tells us so)<br>that "And On the Seventh Day Petals Fell In<br>Petaluma..." was improvised using two<br>tape recorders. First Partch performed an<br>improv he had polished and recorded it on<br>one tape recorder, then Partch listened<br>and performed an accompanying improvised<br>part along with the recorded part, the<br>result being recorded on the second Ampex<br>recorder.<br>Afterwards he wrote out the score, making<br>changes after the fact and re-recording them<br>so that overlaid duets would work as quartets.<br>Clearly Partch's score for "Petals" represents<br>the usual backtracking and transcription of<br> performance so beloved of 20th century<br>composers.  Stockhausen did this all the<br>time; his scores are pure scams produced<br>in retrospect, and Giacinto Scelsi hired a<br>guy to write out transcriptions of his<br>improvisations for him(!)  Scelsi couldn't<br>even read music, apparently.  <br>Partch used the same technique with more<br>layers (re-re-recording) for "Daphne of the<br>Dunes" and "WindSong."<br>It surprises me that no one realizes how<br>integral both magnetic tape and improvisation<br>were to Partch's compositional process.  In<br>fact, this process is essentially identical to<br>some of our work in the Southern California MIcrotonal<br>Group.  We often perform an improv, practice it and<br>practice it and practice it until we've got it<br>cold, then record it and overlay it digitally<br>with another performance produced by<br>listening to the recording & performing with<br>it over and over and over again. (Some of our<br>pieces are process compositions, but some<br>use the method described above.)<br>The main difference is that we don't bother<br>to write out scores of our performances, because<br>how the devil do you notate bowing tines<br>welded to a huge triangle of space alloy that<br>sits atop a balloon?  How do you notate bowing<br>the tine close to the weld, as  opposed to <br>far from the weld?  And what good would it<br>do, since who else has a triangle of space<br>alloy sitting atop a balloon to play the score<br>on, eh, boychik?<br>Neil Haverstick mentions jazz and the blues;<br>he makes a typically brilliant point when he<br>says that blues demand immense intonational<br>sophistication.  Just listen to Billie Holiday<br>singing "Lady Sings the Blues" in the 6 June<br>1956 recording.  When she hits the note for <br>"bad" in "Lady sings the blues/ she's so sad/<br>she's got them bad" even a zipperhead can hear<br>that this pitch is a just chromatic semitone<br>above the pitch for "sad" which is in turn a<br>diatonic semitone above the pitch for "blues,"<br>and that this is *intentional.*  This is no accident.<br>Lady Day wants us to *hear* the difference between<br>those tow semitones, she wants it to reach out and<br>grab us by the throats. <br>Anyone who thinks this does not require intonational<br>sophistication may want to see an audiologist.<br>The improvisation that takes place on the earlier<br>1937 recordings of Lady Day's standard songs<br>is of a piece with the way Partch composed, it's<br>exactly in line with Bach's improvsations. These<br>blues musicians are not doing anything exotic,<br>it goes wayyyyyyyy back to Bach and Buxtehude.<br>So, yes, Partch was an old blues player comping with<br>a tape of himself playing xenharmonic improvs.  Is that<br>any surprise?  Is that any break in the great chain of<br>master improvisers who became master composer?<br>So much for the "sacred unalterable  scores" of <br>Partch's music!<br>Incidentally, various folks have mentioned some<br>kind of dark vibe they get from Partch's music.<br>Huh????<br>Say *what*????<br>Partch's early music is luminous and radiant--<br>"Two Studies" shines like a gem, and "Petals"<br>is so cheerful and buoyant it sets a smile on<br>my face no matter how often I hear it.<br>The only Partch composition with a "dark vibe"<br>that comes to mind is the 1955 "Oedipus"...<br>But you have to understand where that <br>composition comes from.<br>Oedipus is about a man who seeks the truth<br>relentlessly and is destroyed by it, cast<br>out to wander homeless and alone.  Harry<br>Partch sought truth in musical intonation<br>relentlessly and for his crime he was cast<br>out by the Carnegie Foundation in the <br>midst of the Great Depression to wander<br>homeless and alone.  (As a public service,<br>someone should disinter the remains of the<br>members of the Carnegie Foundation who<br>committed this crime against humanity, and<br>defile their corpses in public.)<br>Partch spent the next 8 years in CCC camps<br>and convict camps--he was arrested many<br>times for vagrancy (the high crime of being<br>dirt poor).  In fact, Partch wrote "Barstow"<br>in 1941 in the Los Angeles Men's Convict<br>Camp. <br>This experience scarred him for life.  Partch<br>went within a period of 6 months from <br>hobnobbing with William Butler Yeats<br>and studying just intonation instruments<br>at the British Museum to cleaning out<br>sewers with his hands in a men's convict<br>camp.  No wonder "Oedipus" has a "dark vibe."<br>The wonder is that "Oedipus" manages <br>nonetheless to maintain a dark radiance<br>despite the suffering to which Partch gives vent--<br>yes, he opens a vein in his wrist and bleeds<br>into the score of that composition, but<br>that blood waters a singularly magnificent<br>tree.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 29 Nov 1996 17:50 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA12017; Fri, 29 Nov 1996 17:52:32 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11972<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id IAA12884; Fri, 29 Nov 1996 08:52:28 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 29 Nov 1996 08:52:28 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199611291152_MC1-C83-F68D@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Psot from McLaren</h1><h3><a id=4183 href="#4183">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/1996 7:46:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: improvisation, xenharmonic & otherwise<br>--<br>In Topic 2 of digest 804, Neil Haverstick mentioned<br>that "it's obvious that [Bach] could improvise on a very<br>high level, then go back and jot down a close <br>facsimile..."
