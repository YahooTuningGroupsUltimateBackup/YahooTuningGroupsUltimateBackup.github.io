Here's the news:<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>The American Composers Forum announces the forthcoming release of the final<br>part of its series chronicling the life and work of Harry Partch (1901-74),<br>one of America=B9s most extraordinary, yet central, composers.  Partch was a<br>self-taught musician, eclectic visionary, instrument-builder, microtonal<br>theorist, gay, sometime-hobo, who conceived and composed a Corporeal,<br>integrated, ancient ritual theater. Enclosure Five (innova 405), the final<br>(maybe) installment of this multi-media biography, is a 3-CD set focussing<br>on Partch=B9s works inspired by ancient Greece.  It includes important works<br>published here for the first time, reissues of out-of-print recordings, and<br>new performances.  With this issue, virtually the entirety of Partch=B9s<br>recorded ouevre is publicly available for the first time.  Taken with the<br>rest of the Enclosures series and the Harry Partch Collection on CRI, we<br>can now begin to assess Partch=B9s whole output.<br><br>Works include:<br>-  A reissue of Ulysses at the Edge with Jack Logan playing the trumpet<br>part originally intended for Chet Baker;<br>- Revelation in the Courthouse Park (after The Bacchae of Euripides), in<br>its original version recorded at the University of Illinois in 1960 and<br>excerpted on Partch=B9s own Gate Five records;<br>- King Oedipus, the culmination of Partch=B9s Speech-Music period, in its<br>original version using the translation by W.B. Yeats.  Although Partch<br>considered this his most important work (it took 19 years to write) and an<br>excellent performance (featuring the incomparable Allen Louw as Oedipus and<br>Rudolphine Radil [pupil of Mahler] as Jocasta), it was never released<br>because of a permission dispute;<br>- Miscellaneous short Speech-Music works: By the Rivers of Babylon<br>(reorchestrated from the version heard on Enclosure Two); Come Away, Death<br>from the lost collection, December 1942.  This work, for voice and guitar,<br>appears with the work by Douglas Moore that inspired Partch=B9s own setting;<br>and Minuet, a curious Baroque duet performed by Partch and his<br>then-student, Ben Johnston;<br>- The Bewitched (A Dance Satire) in a 1980 recording from Germany featuring<br>an extraordinary performance and recording of this major Partch work<br>(produced by Kenneth Gaburo for the Berlin Festival, with Danlee Mitchell,<br>music director and Isabelle Tercero as The Witch).<br><br>Partch=B9s own spoken introductions to two of the works are included as well<br>as an extensive booklet.  The Enclosures series, named after Partch=B9s last<br>contemplated work and released on the innova Recordings label of the<br>American Composers Forum, is the culmination of a 13-year endeavor by Dr.<br>Philip Blackburn, a Minnesota-based composer, performer, administrator and<br>scholar.  Inspired by Partch=B9s pioneering spirit and dearth of published<br>materials, Blackburn worked with the Harry Partch Foundation, colleague<br>Kenneth Gaburo, and many others to bring Partch=B9s singular voice to the<br>public, attempting to "let Harry speak for himself."<br><br>Ulysses Departs from the Edge of the World=20<br>(1971 Orion LP, Jack Logan, trumpet)<br><br>Revelation in the Courthouse Park<br>(1960, Gate 5 Records, Issue F)<br><br>Introduction to King Oedipus (KPFA-FM, 1954)<br><br>King Oedipus=20<br>(1952, Mills College premiere with W.B.
