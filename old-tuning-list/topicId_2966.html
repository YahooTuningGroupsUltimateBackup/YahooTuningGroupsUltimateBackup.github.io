Here's my concept, of course subject to<br>much change as needed. First, 10 people pitch in $200 apiece...there's<br>the basic cost of pressing 1000 discs. Each of these 10 people get a slot<br>on the CD, say 6 minutes, which makes for an hour of music. Then, each<br>person receives 100 CD's, to sell, send to press folks, or whatever. I<br>would volunteer to do the grunt work, such as getting liner stuff<br>printed, taking the DAT to be pressed, and such...there's a place here in<br>Denver where I got my discs done, and I have a killer graphics guy who<br>does all my printing, very reasonably. I think this can work; it's just a<br>matter of agreeing on a few details, putting a master DAT together, and<br>doing it. I am quite serious, and am ready to put my moolah in...anyone<br>who is interested, contact me, and we'll chat. By the way, I think a cool<br>cover would simply be the address of this site...it would get the point<br>across well.
