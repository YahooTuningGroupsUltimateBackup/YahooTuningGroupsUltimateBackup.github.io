It didn't take long before that lead to major, and minor triads, and<br>dominant seventh chords in certain voicings.  That is of course in addition to<br>the more obvious nontraditional chords.  Nevertheless, I was very surprised to<br>discover that 88CET can also produce traditional voice-leading between these<br>chords, and thereby traditional cadences.  Amazingly enough, within a few<br>constraints, 88CET can produce very convincing renditions of almost any kind of<br>traditional harmony - progressions of diatonic, secondary dominant,<br>borrowed-chord, and even many of the traditional chromatically-altered chords.<br><br>   Why would anybody ever want to produce traditional harmony 88CET?  We hear<br>traditional harmony everywhere around us, so why try to attempt that in 88CET?<br>Well, that's exactly why - traditional harmony is everywhere, so it has a very<br>strong musical weight to it, and we can use that weight to our advantage.  We<br>can use it for shock value for example - lull the audience into a false sense of<br>security with traditional harmony, and then bash them in the ears with a<br>supramajor triad.  Or we can use it for the exact opposite purpose - to<br>introduce nontraditional possibilities slowly, and gently acclimate them.<br><br>   But there's a more important general reason to use traditional harmony in<br>88CET:  Greater overall harmonic variety.  Exploring new harmonic possibilities<br>is very valuable, but there's no point in abandoning existing harmonies on<br>principle;  they're very useful and powerful musical ideas.  Also, on related<br>lines, exploring new harmony without a reference point in the traditional could<br>actually end up obscuring the character of the new harmony.  Harmonic character<br>I have found to be absolute only to a certain point;  without a reference point<br>in something familiar, all they hear is something nondescriptly weird.  And<br>pretty soon it's not even all that weird anymore.<br><br>   This is what I've mentioned before about "raising the ante":  If your music<br>continues long enough above 3 on a harmonic intensity scale of 1 to 10, 3 starts<br>sounding like 1.  Major tenths start sounding like perfect consonances,<br>subharmonic harmony starts sounding no more harmonically intense than major or<br>minor.  Dave Hill once demonstrated this in reverse.  He played me some music<br>from the earliest stages of the Renaissance, where thirds were still considered<br>enticing dissonances rather than basic consonances.  After you listen to music<br>built around open fifth chords for five minutes or so, you start hearing it like<br>they did:  They'll sing what has the harmonic impact of diminished seventh chord<br>in classical music (or modern popular music for that matter), and you almost<br>feel a chill going up your spine.  That until you listen carefully and notice<br>that it's just a major triad!  <br><br>   The effect of traditional harmony in 88CET I like to describe as "reverse<br>shock therapy".  Such harmonies become surprising in the same, but reverse,<br>sense that injecting supramajor thirds for example into traditional harmony is<br>surprising.  The effect is somewhat analogous with the idea of accent by<br>silence:  a quarter rest within a train of undifferentiated quarter notes is<br>accented.  <br><br>   On a more intellectual note, it's almost comical to produce such manifestly<br>"normal" effects in a tuning that is clearly derived with abnormality in mind.<br>I'm still amused that it was possible at all.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 16 Oct 1995 00:38 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id PAA29625; Sun, 15 Oct 1995 15:37:54 -0700<br>Date: Sun, 15 Oct 1995 15:37:54 -0700<br>Message-Id:  <9510151537.aa14798@cyber.cyber.net><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>88CET #20:  Traditional Harmony in 88CET</h1><h3><a id=2145 href="#2145">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/1995 10:42:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I noticed early-on in my investigation of 88CET that it could produce<br>traditional harmonies such as major and minor tenths, and of course perfect<br>fifths.
