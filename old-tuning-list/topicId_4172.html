Practice and theory<br>----------------------<br><br>Like the sophisticated Gothic theorists of the era 1200-1435 or so who<br>adapted Pythagorean traditions to complex techniques of polyphony,<br>Vicentino sought to adapt the traditions of Ptolemy and Aristoxenos to<br>the requirements of 16th-century polyphony. Also, like some of his<br>Gothic counterparts (e.g. Prosdocimus, 1413), he found that 12 notes<br>per octave were not enough.<br><br>Recognizing a keyboard temperament of 1/4-comma meantone with its pure<br>major thirds, or some approximation, as established "modern" practice,<br>Vicentino in fact defines the prevalent contemporary style as "mixed<br>and tempered music." Building on the usual 12-note meantone scale, and<br>seeking to implement the Greek diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic<br>genera on an _archicembalo_ or "superharpsichord" as we might now say,<br>he proposes an instrument with 36 or 38 notes per octave.<br><br>For this instrument he proposes two alternate tunings, one of them<br>providing a complete system of all three genera which seems<br>essentially the same as 31-tone equal temperament (31-tet), plus<br>either five or seven extra notes supplying pure fifths for some or all<br>of the basic diatonic notes.<br><br>The second tuning ideally uses 38 notes per octave: 19 notes to<br>implement the diatonic and chromatic genera, and another 19 to provide<br>pure fifths for these notes. Thus either system, while premised on<br>1/4-comma meantone or 31-tet with its somewhat narrow or "blunted"<br>fifths, can provide just fifths (and minor thirds) for at least some<br>commonly used sonorities which Zarlino (1558) describes as the<br>_harmonia perfetta_ of third and fifth above the bass, and Lippius<br>(1612) calls the _trias harmonica_ or "triad."<br><br>Bill Alves has done a fine article on Vicentino's modified just<br>intonation system for extended keyboards.[1] Additionally, a complete<br>English edition of his famous treatise of 1555 by Maria Rika Maniates<br>and Claude Palisca has now been published.[2] These sources may lend<br>some perspective to what follows.<br><br><br>-------------------------<br>2. Vicentino 24: a subset<br>-------------------------<br><br>At the end of the 20th century, one approach to a partial<br>implementation of Vicentino's system is to use two standard 12-note<br>keyboards, yielding a 24-note subset of his archicembalo tunings.<br><br>As it happens, his two alternative tunings for 36 notes seem to share<br>24 notes in common: the 19 diatonic and chromatic notes of 1/4-comma<br>meantone from Gb to B#; and five additional notes providing pure<br>rather than usual meantone fifths above G, A, C, D, and E. These five<br>notes are finals of the five natural modes most commonly used in<br>Renaissance music (D Dorian, E Phrygian, G Mixolydian, A Aeolian, and<br>C Ionian). Thus the availability of the just fifths D, E, G, A, and B<br>makes possible a pure _harmonia perfetta_ on the finals of these<br>modes, or as Lippius might say, a pure triad.<br><br>With Vicentino's instrument, the first 19 notes are arranged into<br>three "ranks." The first two ranks are equivalent to the white and<br>black keys of a usual 12-note meantone keyboard, while the third rank<br>supplies seven additional accidentals:<br><br>Rank 3: b#  db   d#     e#  gb    ab   a#     b#   <br>Rank 2:    c#      eb      f#    g#     bb<br>Rank 1:  c     d     e   f     g     a     b   c<br><br>The additional five notes providing pure fifths to c, d, e, g, and a<br>might be notated g5, a5, b5, d5, and e5. These notes apparently make<br>up the "sixth rank" of Vicentino's first tuning[3] (where the fourth<br>and fifth ranks provide the notes of the enharmonic genus, comprising<br>with the first three ranks a 31-note set essentially equivalent to<br>31-tet).<br><br>Thus our "Vicentino 24" subset looks like this:<br><br>Rank 6:  c5    d5    e5        g5    a5    b5  c5  <br>Rank 3: b#  db   d#     e#  gb    ab   a#     b#   <br>Rank 2:    c#      eb      f#    g#     bb<br>Rank 1:  c     d     e   f     g     a     b   c<br><br>The tones of Rank 6 (e.g. c5) are higher than their equivalents in<br>Rank 1 (e.g. c) by about 5.38 cents, the amount by which the fifth is<br>tempered in 1/4-comma meantone to obtain pure major thirds. This<br>difference is one of the senses in which Vicentino uses the term<br>"comma," a term with other interpretations to make life a bit more<br>interesting (and complicated) for modern readers and analysts.<br><br><br>----------------------------------<br>3. Implementation on two keyboards<br>----------------------------------<br><br>The "Vicentino 24" tuning which follows might be implemented either on<br>an acoustical instrument with two manuals (e.g. a harpsichord), or on<br>a synthesizer system of some kind supporting independent tunings for<br>two keyboards. Each keyboard might be supported by its own<br>synthesizer, or a multitimbral synthesizer such as the Yamaha TX-802<br>might support both keyboards through its "part-tuning" feature.<br><br>While 31-tet is the ideal tuning for Vicentino's complete scheme,<br>since it permits a closed system with the equal fivefold division of<br>the whole-tone he describes, 1/4-comma meantone should give<br>essentially the same results with our Vicentino 24 subset.<br><br>Generating the first 19 notes of this subset, corresponding to<br>Vicentino's first three ranks, can be accomplished on synthesizers<br>such as the TX-802 by selecting two transpositions of 1/4-comma<br>meantone (Yamaha's "MeanTone" preset). The first keyboard, in a<br>standard Eb-G# tuning with a "Wolf" fourth or fifth between these<br>notes, represents the 12 notes of his first two ranks, the seven<br>diatonic notes plus the five usual accidentals (c#, eb, f#, g#, bb).<br><br>The second keyboard, in a G-B# tuning, adds the seven accidentals of<br>the third rank -- five of these accidentals mapped to the black keys  <br>(db, d#, gb, ab, a#), plus e# and b# on the usual f and c keys.<br><br>On the TX-802, for example, the first Eb-G# keyboard would be selected<br>on the front panel as "MeanTone" with Yamaha's "key of C" specified;<br>the second G-B# keyboard is Yamaha's "key of E." A more general hint<br>for the TX-802's preset Pythagorean and meantone tunings: take the<br>Yamaha "key" and add an ascending minor third to find the lower note<br>of the Wolf fourth. Thus "key of F" means a Wolf at Ab-C#, and "key of<br>G" a Wolf at Bb-D#, etc.<br><br>While simply selecting these two preset 1/4-comma meantone<br>temperaments supplies 19 notes of our Vicentino 24 subset, we need to<br>custom-tune the remaining five notes of the second keyboard to get our<br>desired pure fifths. With synthesizer keyboards, the best approach<br>might be to tune these notes (c5', e5', g5', a5', b5') to the nearest<br>approximation of a perfect fifth above f, a, c', d', and e' on the<br>lower keyboard. This would call for intervals of 599 tuning steps on a<br>1024-tet synthesizer, 449 steps in 768-tet, etc.[4]<br><br>Here is a diagram showing the notes on the two keyboards in cents,<br>with c' as the point of reference:<br><br>      117.1   269.21             620.53    813.69    965.78<br>       db'      d#'                gb'       ab'       a#'<br> b#        d5'       e5'    e#'        g5'        a5'       b5'  b#'<br> -41.06   198.53    391.69 462.36     701.96     895.11  1088.27 1158.94<br> <br>Keyboard 2: G-B#, 1/4-comma (Yamaha "key of E") with modified "5" notes<br>Keyboard 1: Eb-G#, 1/4-comma (Yamaha "key of C")<br><br>     76.04     310.26          579.47     772.63     1006.84  <br>      c#'        eb'             f#'        g#'         bb'<br> _76.0|117.1_117.1|76.0_     _76.0|117.1_76.0|117.1_117.1|76.0_    <br> c'         d'         e'    f'         g'         a'         b'   c''<br> 0        193.16    386.31 503.42    696.58      889.74   1082.89 1200<br>    193.16     193.16   117.11   193.16    193.16    193.16   117.11 <br><br>It may be noted that in this 1/4-comma meantone implementation (with<br>five notes modified to provide pure fifths), accidental pairs such as<br>c#/db and d#/eb are a lesser diesis (128:125 or about 41.06 cents)<br>apart. In Vicentino's ideal scheme with five equal dieses to a<br>whole-tone, these accidentals would be separated by 1/5-tone, or half<br>of his minor semitone of 2/5-tone -- a "diesis" equal to one step in<br>31-tet, or about 38.71 cents.<br><br><br>--------------------------<br>4. Concluding observations<br>--------------------------<br><br>While Vicentino's full 31-tet system is required to obtain all of his<br>genera and intervals, even a 19-note or 24-note implementation can<br>reveal some interesting possibilities. For example, between db and e#<br>on the second keyboard (Vicentino's third rank), we find an interval<br>of about 345.25 cents in 1/4-comma tuning -- or 348.39 cents in<br>31-tet (9/31 octave).<br><br>Vicentino himself describes this interval as having an effect<br>somewhere between a minor and a major third, and states its<br>"irrational ratio" as approximately 5 1/2:4 1/2 -- or, converting to<br>an integer ratio, 11:9. He finds this a concordant and useful vertical<br>interval on the archicembalo, with its nature tending somewhat toward<br>the major third, a sonorous consonance lending a certain kindred<br>character to such an intermediate form.<br><br>In addition to being of interest from the viewpoint of Vicentino's own<br>theory and practice, a 19-note or 24-note subset of his archicembalo<br>can be also be helpful in playing some of the most adventurous works<br>of composers such as Gesualdo, who goes as far as E# and B#.<br><br>For Renaissance and early 17th-century music which goes beyond the<br>range of a 12-note meantone keyboard, but not quite this far, a more<br>moderate "split key" arrangement of two manuals might be easier<br>because it permits more unisons between the keyboards. Certain<br>chromatic works of Orlando di Lasso and Gesualdo, for example, might<br>have a range of Eb-A# or Ab-D# or the like, requiring only a couple of<br>nonunisonal notes between the two keyboards (e.g. Eb/D# and Bb/A#; or<br>Ab/G# and Eb/D#). Implementing this kind of arrangement for<br>synthesizer(s) might only require selecting two transpositions of a<br>preset 1/4-comma meantone option.<br><br>Incidentally, if one wants a _closed_ Renaissance meantone system with<br>19 or 24 notes per octave, then 19-tet (almost identical to 1/3-comma<br>meantone) is a logical choice. Here, one might choose 19-tet plus five<br>extra notes to provide pure fifths _below_ the virtually pure _minor_<br>thirds of this tuning.[5]<br><br><br>                            ---------------<br>                                 Notes<br>                            ---------------<br><br>1. This article by Bill Alves, originally appearing in _1/1: Journal<br>of the Just Intonation Network 5(No.2):8-13 (Spring 1989), is<br>available at http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/vicentino.html. It includes a<br>very helpful bibliography of material such as the extensive studies of<br>Henry Kaufmann.<br><br>2. Nicola Vicentino, _Ancient Music Adapted to Modern Practice_,<br>tr. Maria Rika Maniates, ed. Claude V. Palisca (New Haven: Yale<br>University Press, 1996).<br><br>3. One point of ambiguity is that Vicentino describes the keys of the<br>sixth rank as a "comma" higher than corresponding keys of the first<br>rank, a term which can have various meanings in his usage. Here it<br>seems reasonable to take the comma in question as the difference<br>between a 31-tet or 1/4-comma meantone fifth and a pure 3:2 fifth --<br>in other words, actually 1/4 of a syntonic comma. This reading nicely<br>fits in with Vicentino's description of the comma, cited by Alves, as<br>an interval which can "help a consonance." Alternatively, a "comma"<br>for Vicentino can also mean an interval of half an enharmonic diesis<br>or 31-tet step -- roughly 19 cents. Since adding a comma in this sense<br>to the usual tempered fifth of his system would yield a fifth of<br>about 716 cents, or 14 cents wider than just, the first interpretation<br>seems to me more likely.<br><br>4. Such a custom synthesizer retuning of the five notes on the second<br>keyboard supplying pure fifths would obviously be easier using a<br>computer-based program such as the brilliant Scala by Manuel Op de<br>Coul, or setting the tuning once on the synthesizer's front panel and<br>then saving it to a RAM cartridge or the like for repeated use.<br><br>5. Such pure fifths for 19-tet or 1/3-comma meantone are located a bit<br>less conveniently than in 31-tet or 1/4-comma meantone from the<br>viewpoint of usual Renaissance practice. In the latter case, for<br>example, b5' (about 5.38 cents above b' in 1/4-comma, 5.18 cents in<br>31-tet) serves as a pure fifth for the common sonority E-G#-B, often<br>sounded on the final of E Phrygian. In contrast, the tone we might<br>call b-5' in 19-tet (about 7.17 cents _below_ b' in 1/3-comma, or 7.22<br>cents in 19-tet) supplies the lowest tone of the somewhat unusual<br>sonority B-D#-F#, outside the most typical 16th-century meantone range<br>(Eb-G#) although it occurs in various adventurous works. The pure<br>sonorities supported by the other "just fifth" keys in 1/3-comma or<br>19-tet are more prevalent: d-5' (D-F#-A); e-5' (E-G#-B); g-5' (G-B-D);<br>and a-5' (A-C#-E).<br><br>Most respectfully,<br><br>Margo Schulter<br>mschulter@value.net</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Vicentino 24 tuning for two keyboards</h1><h3><a id=8776 href="#8776">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;M.

In Vicentino's ideal scheme with five equal dieses to a<br>whole-tone, these accidentals would be separated by 1/5-tone, or half<br>of his minor semitone of 2/5-tone -- a "diesis" equal to one step in<br>31-tet, or about 38.71 cents.<br><br><br>--------------------------<br>4. Concluding observations<br>--------------------------<br><br>While Vicentino's full 31-tet system is required to obtain all of his<br>genera and intervals, even a 19-note or 24-note implementation can<br>reveal some interesting possibilities. For example, between db and e#<br>on the second keyboard (Vicentino's third rank), we find an interval<br>of about 345.25 cents in 1/4-comma tuning -- or 348.39 cents in<br>31-tet (9/31 octave).<br><br>Vicentino himself describes this interval as having an effect<br>somewhere between a minor and a major third, and states its<br>"irrational ratio" as approximately 5 1/2:4 1/2 -- or, converting to<br>an integer ratio, 11:9. He finds this a concordant and useful vertical<br>interval on the archicembalo, with its nature tending somewhat toward<br>the major third, a sonorous consonance lending a certain kindred<br>character to such an intermediate form.<br><br>In addition to being of interest from the viewpoint of Vicentino's own<br>theory and practice, a 19-note or 24-note subset of his archicembalo<br>can be also be helpful in playing some of the most adventurous works<br>of composers such as Gesualdo, who goes as far as E# and B#.<br><br>For Renaissance and early 17th-century music which goes beyond the<br>range of a 12-note meantone keyboard, but not quite this far, a more<br>moderate "split key" arrangement of two manuals might be easier<br>because it permits more unisons between the keyboards. Certain<br>chromatic works of Orlando di Lasso and Gesualdo, for example, might<br>have a range of Eb-A# or Ab-D# or the like, requiring only a couple of<br>nonunisonal notes between the two keyboards (e.g. Eb/D# and Bb/A#; or<br>Ab/G# and Eb/D#). Implementing this kind of arrangement for<br>synthesizer(s) might only require selecting two transpositions of a<br>preset 1/4-comma meantone option.<br><br>Incidentally, if one wants a _closed_ Renaissance meantone system with<br>19 or 24 notes per octave, then 19-tet (almost identical to 1/3-comma<br>meantone) is a logical choice. Here, one might choose 19-tet plus five<br>extra notes to provide pure fifths _below_ the virtually pure _minor_<br>thirds of this tuning.[5]<br><br><br>                            ---------------<br>                                 Notes<br>                            ---------------<br><br>1. This article by Bill Alves, originally appearing in _1/1: Journal<br>of the Just Intonation Network 5(No.2):8-13 (Spring 1989), is<br>available at http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/vicentino.html. It includes a<br>very helpful bibliography of material such as the extensive studies of<br>Henry Kaufmann.<br><br>2. Nicola Vicentino, _Ancient Music Adapted to Modern Practice_,<br>tr. Maria Rika Maniates, ed. Claude V. Palisca (New Haven: Yale<br>University Press, 1996).<br><br>3. One point of ambiguity is that Vicentino describes the keys of the<br>sixth rank as a "comma" higher than corresponding keys of the first<br>rank, a term which can have various meanings in his usage. Here it<br>seems reasonable to take the comma in question as the difference<br>between a 31-tet or 1/4-comma meantone fifth and a pure 3:2 fifth --<br>in other words, actually 1/4 of a syntonic comma. This reading nicely<br>fits in with Vicentino's description of the comma, cited by Alves, as<br>an interval which can "help a consonance." Alternatively, a "comma"<br>for Vicentino can also mean an interval of half an enharmonic diesis<br>or 31-tet step -- roughly 19 cents. Since adding a comma in this sense<br>to the usual tempered fifth of his system would yield a fifth of<br>about 716 cents, or 14 cents wider than just, the first interpretation<br>seems to me more likely.<br><br>4. Such a custom synthesizer retuning of the five notes on the second<br>keyboard supplying pure fifths would obviously be easier using a<br>computer-based program such as the brilliant Scala by Manuel Op de<br>Coul, or setting the tuning once on the synthesizer's front panel and<br>then saving it to a RAM cartridge or the like for repeated use.<br><br>5. Such pure fifths for 19-tet or 1/3-comma meantone are located a bit<br>less conveniently than in 31-tet or 1/4-comma meantone from the<br>viewpoint of usual Renaissance practice. In the latter case, for<br>example, b5' (about 5.38 cents above b' in 1/4-comma, 5.18 cents in<br>31-tet) serves as a pure fifth for the common sonority E-G#-B, often<br>sounded on the final of E Phrygian. In contrast, the tone we might<br>call b-5' in 19-tet (about 7.17 cents _below_ b' in 1/3-comma, or 7.22<br>cents in 19-tet) supplies the lowest tone of the somewhat unusual<br>sonority B-D#-F#, outside the most typical 16th-century meantone range<br>(Eb-G#) although it occurs in various adventurous works. The pure<br>sonorities supported by the other "just fifth" keys in 1/3-comma or<br>19-tet are more prevalent: d-5' (D-F#-A); e-5' (E-G#-B); g-5' (G-B-D);<br>and a-5' (A-C#-E).<br><br>Most respectfully,<br><br>Margo Schulter<br>mschulter@value.net</div>
