The first one is my<br>"steel guitar" which is similar to Ivor Darreg's megalyra instruments.  I<br>corresponded with him while building it.  My "steel guitar" is a 1 X 6<br>board about 40 inches long with a 7 1/2 inch piece attached at right angles<br>to each end of the 40 inch board.  I have 9 guitar strings on one side of<br>the board and 5 bass guitar strings on the other side to prevent warping of<br>the board from the tension of the strings.  The tuning pegs are piano<br>tuning pegs in snugly drilled holes.  There are no frets; instead, layers<br>of cardboard and several paper clips to hold stiff paper boards with lines<br>to mark where frets would be.  I have a paper board for each of more than a<br>dozen tunings including equal tempered scales.  Painting lines on a "fret"<br>board beneath the strings can get very confusing when there are so many<br>tunings.  All of these fit interchangeably on ONE instrument.  I hold the<br>instrument across my lap and stop the strings with a noter bar in my left<br>hand and pick the strings with the fingers of my right hand.<br>	The second instrument is a mountain dulcimer built with moveable frets. <br>The fret board is mounted on shims, one on each end to allow wire loop<br>"frets" to be adjusted along the fretboard.  The dulcimer is played with<br>fingers or a noter to stop the strings in the conventional mountain<br>dulcimer manner.<br>	The third instrument is a kalimba or thumb piano with a resonator box with<br>very easily adjustable reeds of steel and bamboo strips.  I have not<br>calculated tuning charts as I have for the stringed instruments but an<br>electronic tuner reading in "cents" will work as long as you know the<br>frequencies needed.<br>	The fourth instrument is a panpipe.  It is a set of tubes of various<br>lengths and diameters attached into row and blown across the tops as you<br>would blow across a bottle.   Inside each tube is a snug-fitting cork that<br>can be pushed higher or lower inside the tube to tune the tubes.  These<br>tubes can be tuned with an electronic tuner also.<br>	My favorite equal tempered scale is 7TET.  It is a challenge because it<br>has so few tones but yet is unexplainably very interesting.<br>	ALITA MORRISON <essaim@texas.net></div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Instruments for non-12TET music</h1><h3><a id=7202 href="#7202">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Ed &#x26; Alita Morrison&#x22; &#x3C;essaim@texas.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/1998 1:14:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I have been reading the questions about non-12TET music and will describe<br>my instruments that work for playing non-12TET music.
