I don't believe that ANY metric can state categorically<br>that a 15/1 is more or less "consonant" than a 5/3, or a 15/8 than a<br>16/15, or a root-position major triad than a second-inversion triad, or<br>any such comparison, without carefully circumscribing its assertion by a<br>precise definition of what "consonance" means in its context.  (Tenney's<br>_History of 'Consonance' and 'Dissonance'_ is a valuable look at how<br>notions of "consonance" have changed over the centuries in European art<br>music.)  In designing a metric, there is an understandable tendency to<br>shuttle between number and intuition, to say "my ears tell me..." about<br>this quality, while also striving for quantitative objectivity.<br><br>Which is NOT to say that the quality can't be measured, or that the<br>design of metrics is therefore futile.  But it does seem inevitable that<br>any given metric will necessarily contain highly subjective decisions --<br>e.g. how to weight the various dimensions, whether or not it's octave<br>invariant, whether the limit-system is based on primes or odd numbers or<br>odd composites, et cetera -- decisions that carry with them theoretical<br>assumptions about the nature of harmony and tonality, tending to<br>radically simplify and somewhat falsify the processes by which we hear<br>and interpret.<br><br>I believe that a somewhat fuller and more useful description of<br>harmonicity might be reached by using a GROUP of metrics, each<br>descriptive of some particular aspect of pitch and harmonic space,<br>instead of seeking a single "best" metric for a quality as multivalent<br>and contextual as "consonance".<br><br>Various metrics based on small-number-ratio theories of consonance have<br>been discussed extensively on the list.  I would like to see more<br>discussion of what I consider "problem areas", the first two of them<br>psychoacoustic, the third a more general agenda:<br><br>1) Critical bandwidth.  Though there has been much discussion of octave<br>invariance, there has been little of critical bandwidth, which requires<br>that we bring absolute frequency, not just interval ratios, into any<br>metric that claims psychoacoustic validity.  (Sethares's extension of<br>Plomp-Levelt does this, and takes steady-state timbre into account as<br>well.)<br><br>2) Non-integers/approximations.  Small-number-ratio metrics fail with<br>irrationals.  E.g. 300001/200000 is much more "dissonant" than 3/2;<br>indeed, the closer the approximation, the more distant it's ranked by<br>any small-number metric.  The ear has a much more adaptable threshold. <br>Some metric that describes near-misses could be quite useful.  (Again,<br>by incorporating critical bandwidth, Sethares's metric avoids this<br>particular pitfall.  Tenney alludes to, but does not incorporate, a<br>"tolerance range" in his harmonic distance metric.)<br><br>3) Acculturation.  A catch-all by which I mean any sort of bias or<br>assumption or preference that may be hiding behind a veneer of<br>objectivity.  Octave-invariance has been discussed.  Some discussion of<br>where & how qualities become quantities might be helpful, e.g. the<br>importance of 5-limit intervals in tertial harmony.  Not that bias or<br>preference could or should be banished, but it ought to be identified.<br>Thus, a metric designed to describe the closeness of a pitch set to a <br>harmonic series might reasonably rank a 7/1 closer than a 3/2.  Et cetera.<br><br>The goal might be to arrive at some set of simple metrics that do not<br>confuse a multi-dimensional subjective quality like "consonance" with a<br>single quantitative measurement.  One could then choose the qualities<br>that one deems important and use those metrics appropriate to the<br>analytical or compositional task at hand.</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>RE: Basic dimensionality, and related issues</h1><h3><a id=5856 href="#5856">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.

I don't believe that ANY metric can state categorically<br>that a 15/1 is more or less "consonant" than a 5/3, or a 15/8 than a<br>16/15, or a root-position major triad than a second-inversion triad, or<br>any such comparison, without carefully circumscribing its assertion by a<br>precise definition of what "consonance" means in its context.  (Tenney's<br>_History of 'Consonance' and 'Dissonance'_ is a valuable look at how<br>notions of "consonance" have changed over the centuries in European art<br>music.)  In designing a metric, there is an understandable tendency to<br>shuttle between number and intuition, to say "my ears tell me..." about<br>this quality, while also striving for quantitative objectivity.<br><br>Which is NOT to say that the quality can't be measured, or that the<br>design of metrics is therefore futile.  But it does seem inevitable that<br>any given metric will necessarily contain highly subjective decisions --<br>e.g. how to weight the various dimensions, whether or not it's octave<br>invariant, whether the limit-system is based on primes or odd numbers or<br>odd composites, et cetera -- decisions that carry with them theoretical<br>assumptions about the nature of harmony and tonality, tending to<br>radically simplify and somewhat falsify the processes by which we hear<br>and interpret.<br><br>I believe that a somewhat fuller and more useful description of<br>harmonicity might be reached by using a GROUP of metrics, each<br>descriptive of some particular aspect of pitch and harmonic space,<br>instead of seeking a single "best" metric for a quality as multivalent<br>and contextual as "consonance".<br><br>Various metrics based on small-number-ratio theories of consonance have<br>been discussed extensively on the list.  I would like to see more<br>discussion of what I consider "problem areas", the first two of them<br>psychoacoustic, the third a more general agenda:<br><br>1) Critical bandwidth.  Though there has been much discussion of octave<br>invariance, there has been little of critical bandwidth, which requires<br>that we bring absolute frequency, not just interval ratios, into any<br>metric that claims psychoacoustic validity.  (Sethares's extension of<br>Plomp-Levelt does this, and takes steady-state timbre into account as<br>well.)<br><br>2) Non-integers/approximations.  Small-number-ratio metrics fail with<br>irrationals.  E.g. 300001/200000 is much more "dissonant" than 3/2;<br>indeed, the closer the approximation, the more distant it's ranked by<br>any small-number metric.  The ear has a much more adaptable threshold. <br>Some metric that describes near-misses could be quite useful.  (Again,<br>by incorporating critical bandwidth, Sethares's metric avoids this<br>particular pitfall.  Tenney alludes to, but does not incorporate, a<br>"tolerance range" in his harmonic distance metric.)<br><br>3) Acculturation.  A catch-all by which I mean any sort of bias or<br>assumption or preference that may be hiding behind a veneer of<br>objectivity.  Octave-invariance has been discussed.  Some discussion of<br>where & how qualities become quantities might be helpful, e.g. the<br>importance of 5-limit intervals in tertial harmony.  Not that bias or<br>preference could or should be banished, but it ought to be identified.<br>Thus, a metric designed to describe the closeness of a pitch set to a <br>harmonic series might reasonably rank a 7/1 closer than a 3/2.  Et cetera.<br><br>The goal might be to arrive at some set of simple metrics that do not<br>confuse a multi-dimensional subjective quality like "consonance" with a<br>single quantitative measurement.  One could then choose the qualities<br>that one deems important and use those metrics appropriate to the<br>analytical or compositional task at hand.</div>
