It is not one of<br>the temperaments discussed in his 1991 "Tuning," because he used only<br>English language sources for the later book. <br><br>  First tune a line of just fifths and fourths from C4 (middle C) to F3,<br>F3 to Bb3, Bb3 to Eb4, Eb4 to Ab3, Ab3 to Db4, Db4 to Gb4.<br><br>  Temper the third Bb3-D4 so that it is wide and beats at the same rate as<br>the third D4-F#4(Gb).  Then temper G3 so that it beats equally with both<br>C4 and D4 (narrow fifth, wide fourth). <br><br>  Temper A3 so that the third F3-A3 beats equally with the fourth A3-D4<br>(both intervals are wide).
