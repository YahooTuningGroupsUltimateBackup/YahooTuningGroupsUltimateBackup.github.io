Gregg says that you can't properly reproduce<br>many rock songs on the piano, because these songs are in 19-TET.  But it<br>is also obvious that the rock musicians are using a complex combination<br>of tuning systems, represented by the mix of diverse instrument timbres<br>and tempering inclinations.  If you listen to lots of music from<br>different parts of the world, like I do (since I teach "world music"<br>courses--and in this I include Western music!), you will be hard to be<br>convinced that all people around the world veer towards a common<br>temperament.  Close, maybe.  But the differences are critical; indeed it<br>is in large part due to these slender differences in timbre and tuning<br>that we can discern regional differences.  We are unfortunately not<br>close to a comprehensive study of how people around the world really<br>work with pitch systems.  Most studies from Seashore on are strongly<br>biased because of their Western-based sample.  The very perceptions of<br>musical identities of pitches and melodies seem to vary around the<br>world.  I noticed in my fieldwork in West Africa--and Gerhard Kubik has<br>published on this interesting phenomenon--that when harp and mbira<br>players retune their instruments (which, especially in the case of the<br>harps, go out of tune easily)--they sometimes come up with significantly<br>different tunings, changing what seems to be a "whole tone" scale, for<br>example, to something approximating a diatonic mode; and then they came<br>it is the "same tuning"!

I suggest, and I do not mean to chatise, because we<br>ethnomusicologists are also guilty, that most researchers in tuning and<br>temperament are too narrowly focussed on Western models to achieve<br>meaningful theoretical results.  An organized world study can be done;<br>but it is yet to be done.
