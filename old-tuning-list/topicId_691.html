Interestingly enough, I have found that most players can<br>only do one style well...very rarely do you find blues guys that can<br>play bop, or flamenco guys that can play blues, or classical folks that<br>can improvise competently. The level of ability required to play (or<br>sing) like BB King is surely the same as the ability to play Bach<br>or Beethoven, and the fact that you can sight read your butt off does<br>not mean that you can play "Crazy" by Willie Nelson worth a poot.<br>Believe me, I've been on many a gig where a bunch of jazz musicians<br>absolutely ruined some rockabilly tunes because they didn't have a <br>clue as to what the proper FEEL was.

There is much complex music, Schoenberg's serial music<br>being one prime example, that is almost totally devoid of any humanity<br>or passion, and much "simple" music, blues again being a good example,<br>that moves me to tears or joy.
