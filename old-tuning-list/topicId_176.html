The end.  The last one.  The last in my series on 88CET.  Of<br>course that doesn't mean that I will not be talking about it anymore, but it's<br>the last in this series serialized from my up-coming Xenharmonikon text.  In<br>this one, I'll present you some suggestions for what you might want to do with<br>88CET tuning.  <br><br>   Unlike Lucy or Yasser, or to some degree Partch, I certainly don't claim that<br>88CET provides a revolutionary new framework in which to study xenharmonics.<br>But it certainly is a distinctive-sounding tuning with some powerful<br>capabilities.  It's an efficient tuning in the sense that it provides a wide<br>variety of musical resources - traditional as well as nontraditional - from a<br>very small number of tones per octave.  <br><br>   88CET is certainly unusual, being a nonoctave-based, and having<br>nontraditional thirds.  As such, it takes time to get comfortable with it.  For<br>example, many find the 9:7 supramajor third very difficult to accept at first.<br>So, if you're looking for a tuning whose possibilities blossom into exciting new<br>music within a few hours, 88CET is definitely not for you.  But 88CET certainly<br>produces surprising, tantalizing, and unique results, probably more than<br>average, once you work your way over that hurdle.  <br><br>   If you're looking for a tuning that works nicely on traditional instruments,<br>then you're in luck for certain types of instruments, but not others.  It maps<br>very well to traditional keyboards, so it works great on electronic instruments.<br>It doesn't require you to spread an octave over a large span of the keyboard.<br>It can also map nicely to orchestral strings (21221 pattern spanning across a<br>perfect fifth), but it poses problems on many wind instruments.  <br><br>   Another question to ask is whether to approach 88CET using Bill Sethares'<br>mapped timbres or to leave the overtone spectra unmodified.  Probably the most<br>important criterion for answering that question is whether you want to compose<br>for the somewhat bell-like qualities of these mapped timbres or for more<br>traditional instrument qualities.  I have intentionally composed most of my<br>88CET work for simulations of traditional instruments, mostly to avoid changing<br>too many variables at once.  At this early stage in exploring a new tuning,<br>there is a risk of the music being perceived as "nondescriptly strange".<br>Perhaps with these traditional-timbral works available, audiences hearing music<br>with additional unusual qualities will be able to separate out what oddness is<br>due to tuning and what are due to other factors.  <br><br>   The second most important criterion for deciding whether to compose for<br>traditional or mapped timbres is whether you want to build your music around the<br>14-step pseudo-octave.  Clearly this significantly changes your approach to<br>harmonization.  <br><br>   But, whatever approach you take to 88CET, be patient, and try out the<br>particular ideas I've presented in these postings.  It's alien territory, so<br>it's easy to stumble upon some really dreadful discords.  It takes time to find<br>locate consonances, whether traditional or nontraditional, and figure out how to<br>use them.  But once you do, I think you'll find it an intriguing tuning.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 11 Nov 1995 23:39 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id NAA01001; Sat, 11 Nov 1995 13:39:20 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 11 Nov 1995 13:39:20 -0800<br>Message-Id: <951111213454_71670.2576_HHB6-5@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2309 href="#2309">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/12/1995 12:57:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Well John, it's pretty hopeless to ask a couple hundred tuning-heads to avoid<br>editorializing when somebody as authoritative as the Harvard guys say something<br>as ... "distasteful" I suppose ... as that!  <br><br>   Yeah, I've heard that Harvard definition of JI before ("any tuning that<br>incorporates five or more acoustically pure types of intervals within the<br>octave").  I personally doubt if it's refering to what it sounds like it's<br>refering, and it's certainly vague whatever it's refering to.  <br><br>   First of all, it never defined "acoustically pure".  "Equal to an untempered<br>small whole number frequency ratio" would be a reasonable guess, but of course<br>then they'd have to define "small".  <br><br>   Second, it doesn't define "types" of intervals.  Are the fifths from scale<br>steps 1-5 and 2-6 (regardless of their tuning) different "type"s, or is this<br>sort of typing independent of position in the scale?  If it's independent of<br>position in the scale, is the fifth from 7-11(4) - a diminished fifth - of the<br>same "type" as the other fifths?  Are all perfect consonances one type, major<br>another, and minor another?  <br><br>   Third, it doesn't clarify whether "within an octave" includes an octave or<br>not.  That sounds nit-picky I know, but if you've got four other than the<br>octave, you've got to know the answer.  <br><br>   Here's how I suspect that definition came about:  They got the number five<br>from the number of exact 3:2 perfect fifths in the circle forming the historical<br>Ptolemaic tuning.  In that tuning, the fifths between scale-degrees 4-8(1), 1-5,<br>5-9(2), 6-10(3), and 3-7 are exact 3:2 fifths.  7-11(4) is not perfect, and 2-6<br>is where the circle breaks by inserting a comma-flat fifth.  At that point, I<br>suspect they took that number 5 and, without thoroughly understanding the<br>question, wrapped what turned out to be deeply ambiguous words around it.  I'm<br>speculating here of course.  <br><br>   But let me make one very important point:  I suspect that it's difficult to<br>support the idea that the definition of just intonation has been invariant over<br>the centuries, and over the various schools of Western music.  JI enthusiasts,<br>and most others knowledgible of tuning ideas, take it to mean - essentially -<br>the opposite of temperament.  But one can probably argue fairly successfully<br>that the definition was far more narrow in earlier times.  I doubt if Ptolemy's<br>followers would have viewed Monophony as just intonation.  Considering that<br>(according to Dave Hill) Rameau rejected 7:4 as a basic harmonic building block,<br>I suspect that they probably would have viewed Monophony instead as more like<br>cacophony!  Fortunately for Partch fans like me, the realm of musical<br>possibilities is far more experimental nowadays.  <br><br>   (I'm sorry John;  I accidentally deleted your message before I got a chance<br>to answer - to you directly - the two specific questions you asked.  If you'd<br>like me to answer them specifically, please resend them to me personally.)<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 13 Nov 1995 03:26 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id RAA13689; Sun, 12 Nov 1995 17:26:12 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 12 Nov 1995 17:26:12 -0800<br>Message-Id: <951113011947_71670.2576_HHB42-1@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>88CET #25:  Recommendations</h1><h3><a id=2304 href="#2304">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/11/1995 1:37:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>This is it.
