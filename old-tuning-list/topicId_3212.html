I don't think even Jimi often took distortion to that<br>extreme. You would have to overdrive a transistor amp to get an idea of<br>the extreme distortion I'm talking about. Think of the distortion sound<br>in "Revolution" (fast version) by the Beatles. I think that's transistor<br>distortion. Vacuum tubes (or a simulation thereof) are the usual means<br>of effecting a distorted guitar sound and they have a way of letting the<br>individual notes ring through.</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Jimi Hendric chord</h1><h3><a id=7260 href="#7260">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.
