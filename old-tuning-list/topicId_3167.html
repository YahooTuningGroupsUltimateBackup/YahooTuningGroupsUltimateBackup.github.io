What's a comma?<br><br>   Here's the history:  The earlier "pythagorean" major scale was defined<br>by stacking exact 3:2-frequency-ratio perfect fifths:  one downward from<br>the root to define the subdominant (e.g., F in the key of C), and then five<br>upward to define, successively, the dominant (G), supertonic (D),<br>submediant (A), mediant (E), and leading tone (B).<br><br>   If you do that, you end up with an E defined as an 81:64 ratio (3:2 to<br>the fourth power, divided by 4 to drop it down into the octave where we<br>started) relative to the root.  81:64 however, beats against the more<br>intuitive 5:4 (i.e., 80:64) major third.  The pitch difference between the<br>two is the syntonic comma, a ratio of 81:80.<br><br>   The premises behind quarter-comma meantone are that:<br>1.  We want the mediant (the major third above the tonic) to be 5:4.<br>2.  We want all (true) perfect fifths to be the same size.<br>3.  We are willing to slightly compromise the ideality of the perfect fifth<br>    to make 1 and 2 possible.<br>So the quarter-comma meantone solution is to build a scale in a circle of<br>identical fifths that are not the ideal 3:2 ratio, but flat of that ideal<br>by 1/4 of that 81:80 comma.  That way, when you stack up each of four of<br>those quarter-comma flat fifths, you drop the pitch by 1/4 comma for the G<br>(in the key of C), 2/4 comma flat for the D, 3/4 flat for the A, and then<br>when you get to the E, you are 4/4 (i.e., 1) of a comma flat of that 81:64<br>major third, which is (by definition) the more ideal 5:4 major third.<br><br>   All meantone tunings are based upon a circle of consistent-sized fifths<br>(or more often a "broken" circle of fifths).  The difference between the<br>various meantone tunings is the size (i.e., tempering) of that fifth.  That<br>circle frequently starts on Eb, going on to Bb, F, C, G, etc., on to G#.<br>The circle is frequently broken at the diminished sixth between G# and Eb.<br>If that diminished sixth were treated as if it were a perfect fifth (e.g.,<br>as if it were G# to D#, or Ab to Eb, rather than G# to Eb), then it would<br>be perceived as the "wolf" fifth, because it's WAAAAYY out of tune from the<br>ideal 3:2 perfect fifth.<br><br>   The other solution is to continue the circle of fifths, allowing D# to<br>be a different pitch from Eb, or, going the other way, Ab to be a different<br>pitch from G#.  It turns out that, purely by mathematical luck, if you<br>continue that to a total of 31 fifths (knocking the pitches down by an<br>octave as needed to keep them within the original octave's span) you end up<br>very close to where you started - only about 6 cents off.  (A cent is a<br>unit of measurement for very small differences in pitch, one cent being<br>100th of the usual 12TET half-step.)  That's another way of saying the<br>31TET is extremely close to the completed quarter-comma meantone system.<br><br>   The coincidence between third-comma meantone and 19TET is even closer<br>still.  Third-comma meantone uses a fifth tempered down by 1/3 of a comma<br>so that the submediant (e.g. A in the key of C) has a 5:3 ratio relative to<br>the tonic rather than 27:16 as you would get if you were to use exact 3:2<br>perfect fifths.  It turns out that if you stack up 19 third-comma-flat<br>fifths (dropping pitches down by octaves as needed to keep the pitches in<br>same the octave as where you started), you end up less than 1 cent from<br>where you started!</div><h3><a id=7208 href="#7208">ðŸ”—</a>gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)</h3><span>3/8/1998 10:39:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Bob Lee wrote:<br><br>> Second question: I notice that the tuning above has the "in tune" fourths<br>> tuned to 502 cents.
