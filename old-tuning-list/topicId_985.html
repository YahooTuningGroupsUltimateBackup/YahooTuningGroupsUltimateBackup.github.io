Has your<br>feeling <br>> changed any?<br><br>	Yes. I "got it" one day, when I realized that *similarity* is not<br>octaveness, or "fifthness" or "twelfthness" or any *sensation* associated<br>with a common interval, but some sort of capacity of the mind to to switch<br>inner gears, to see the more abstract level within a pattern already<br>categorized. In other words, it is a cognitive operation, not a<br>psychoacoustical one. For <br>	That's why the main goal of the Stanford experiments was to establish if<br>trained musicians can have an *spontaneous* sense of expanded chroma given<br>the appropriate musical context --and if so, to what extent. In this sense,<br>and although I used some (heavily edited) sections of the book as a basis,<br>the final report's (dissertation) emphasis is on *categorical* perception,<br>rather than sensorial or process-oriented perception.<br>	It is the context, and only the context (a complete "meaningful" fragment<br>of complying music) what really triggers the possibility of "perceiving, if<br>you will, the hidden geometry which we call similarity, and which is the<br>subtance of --but goes beyond-- octaveness. What is fascinating about the<br>experiments (appart from being my magnus opus, of course, :) )is that<br>"similarity" "equivalence' or the like are never mentioned to the subjects,<br>who had to perform matching tasks without the use, benefit, or help of<br>pre-established verbal categories that could be associated in their minds<br>to an overlearned sensorial category (like "total similarity of tones" to<br>"octaveness"). <br>	Of course the twelfth (and multiples) has been an always-present interval<br>in the Western polyphonies, but again, only within the context of our usual<br>7 diatonic categories --and later chromatic inflexions. That's why the<br>tuning A-12 (12 equal divisions of powers of three) helps the unaware<br>listener to *decontextualize* the learned categorical system, and by<br>strictly avoiding approximations to powers of two the musical context (if<br>effective and complying) compells some sort of information-reduction<br>mechanism to re-categorize and "find" the solution.
