And I hope<br>you don't mind me returning to this subject.  But it seems important<br>to be clear about it...<br><br>As I understand Johnny's argument (of recent posts): if we provide<br>musicians at an early age with an ear and an understanding of<br>ATS, they would grow up being able to play in alternative systems<br>without too much difficulty.  This view is based on at least two main<br>points: firstly,  that good intonation depends on well-practised,<br>pre-emptive  anticipation  of the precise way each pitch is produced,<br>and is achieved through a combination of physical and aural memory<br>and intention: that is, no matter how well an instrument is designed<br>to produce a particular scale,  this interaction of memory and<br>intention is part and parcel of playing in tune in any given tuning<br>system.  (Earlier, I used the word 'instinctive' as shorthand as one<br>tends to do on this forum:  but it is not really an inappropriate<br>description of the intonational adjustments that are made in ensemble<br>- which is what I was referring to).  The point here is that<br>realising music in an ATS is really not so different from playing in<br>'12' (ie., performance practice of 12-ET, not the strict mathematical<br>notion),  given the time, ear and aptitude to learn a given system.<br>And, let me say - I have no doubt there is considerable truth in this<br>argument, having written at length supporting it elswhere.  However,<br>a second point is more controversial.  This is that all (or at least<br>very many) possible tones may be produced on a conventional woodwind<br>using a combination of embouchure, breath pressure and fingering, in<br>which (a) there is no loss of  tone quality, or at least none so<br>great as to be considered a problem, and (b) which are no more<br>difficult (or none so difficult as to imply loss of facility), than<br>those of 12-ET (ie., the tuning system for which the instrument(s)<br>are (nominally) designed).<br><br>However, while awareness and training in ATS, in schools and<br>conservatories is slowly increasing, there is a very long way to go.<br>As I see it, the profile of ATS in these institutions etc., would, no<br>doubt over a long period of time, be raised by the existence of<br>specially designed new instruments - especially if they play a part<br>in enabling rather beautiful music (in ATS) to be realised somewhat<br>more easily and accurately than (might) be the case on conventional<br>instruments.   In addition, some woodwinds seem to be more amenable<br>to ATS than others, and it is often easier to hear oneself when<br>playing solo or in a small chamber group than in larger ensembles or<br>the orchestra (ref., Johnny's remark about the Darreg duo etc.). And,<br>however many independent soloists there may be, there is certainly no<br>orchestra in existence today which could manage, or is likely of<br>being able to manage in the foreseeable future, complex works in<br>radical ATS  (Oh! please tell me there is such an orchestra, and that<br>it sounds like the Berlin Phil_.!).  New instruments, (if<br>successfully designed in an ATS which encouraged truly musical<br>results), would make a contribution to hastening this goal.  A great<br>deal of aural training will be needed to help players play in tune on<br>new instruments (just the same as on existing instruments) - but new<br>woodwind (and brass) will help the player in a way that existing<br>instruments will not, and aural skills will develop faster with new<br>instruments, because (a) the new instrument will help to confirm the<br>required pitch in the performer's ear, (b) the fingering will make<br>more sense (especially for `logical' or `rational' systems, if either<br>of  them turn out to be possible), and, hopefully, (c) tone quality<br>need not be compromised.<br><br>There is another  response that I'd like to make to Johnny's remarks,<br>because, while (I think) I understand what he's saying, I'd be<br>interested see how his way of looking at things accounts for<br>the following:  (1) If  the argument about being able to realise any<br>tuning system on a woodwind is true, why does it matter where the<br>tone-holes are placed on the instrument in the first placel? It<br>matters (surely?) because having the tone-holes in the right place<br>makes playing in tune easier. Do we agree that easier is a good<br>thing?  (2) Woodwind and brass players sometimes complain that an<br>instrument is unplayable.  This may (rarely) be because certain<br>tone-holes are badly  positioned (as in the famous story about the<br>Russian saxophone), or ill-designed valve draw lengths.  Or, because,<br>(for example), if a clarinet was built for non contemporary standard<br>pitch (A435 or A455), then, when the barrel is pulled out (or pushed<br>in) to tune to A440, the scale is virtually  unplayable.  (See O. Lee<br>Gibson, Clarinet Acoustics, p. 26).  In short, the positioning of<br>tone-holes or the length of valve draws, (relative to each other<br>and to the pitch level the instrument built for) make a difference<br>whether an instrument is considered playable by professional players.<br>(Of course, there will be other factors_).<br><br>Clearly, a virtuoso will be able to do much more with a defective<br>instrument than an amateur, perhaps, for an audience that doesn't know<br>any better, disguising the defects of the instrument entirely.  This<br>is, I think, not an unreasonable analogy to the situation of<br>performing ATS today.  And the amazing fact that performers such as<br>yourself  (Johnny), and many others can do this, makes me wonder<br>what MORE you would be able to achieve on an instrument which is<br>not, in effect, a `defective' instrument relative to whatever ATS you<br>are playing in.  In short, my position is of that there are<br>ADVANTAGES to building new woodwinds and brass for ATS  ( and I am<br>not really interested in disputing, as I tried to make clear earlier,<br>that ATS are to a certain degree POSSIBLE with conventional<br>instruments.  The degree is hard to define, it seems_)<br><br>I'm sure someone's going to disagree with something of this! - and<br>I look forward to it_.<br><br>with further apologies for length,<br><br>Patrick Ozzard-Low <br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Patrick Ozzard-Low" <patrick.ozzard-low.itex@norfolk.gov.uk><br>Subject:  Fenchaphones or Frenchaphones?<br>PostedDate:  25-11-97 16:02:18<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  25-11-97 16:00:49-25-11-97 16:00:49,25-11-97 16:00:50-25-11-97 16:00:51<br>DeliveredDate:  25-11-97 16:00:51<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125655A.00527795; Tue, 25 Nov 1997 16:00:45 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01924; Tue, 25 Nov 1997 16:02:18 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 25 Nov 1997 16:02:18 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01922<br>Received: (qmail 8548 invoked from network); 25 Nov 1997 07:02:13 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 25 Nov 1997 07:02:13 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199711251455.OAA09922@imail.norfolk.gov.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Woodwinds again...</h1><h3><a id=6493 href="#6493">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Patrick Ozzard-Low&#x22; &#x3C;patrick.ozzard-low.itex@norfolk.gov.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/1997 5:53:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Dear Tuning, and Johnny especially,<br><br>I hope the list will excuse a longer than average mail.
