May 21, 1997<br><br>Day 2 of AFMM's MicroMay began with a transcription <br>of Andrea Gabrieli's Vezzosa Filli, a piece for double <br>quartet of singers. The resonant St. Paul's Chapel<br>(at least a couple of seconds of reverb) was an additional <br>instrument, reinforcing the music with a glow. Vezzosa Filli <br>was perfect for this space. <br><br>sopranos - Meredith Borden,Piera F. Paine <br>altos - Adria Quinones, Elizabeth Lee <br>tenors - Brendan Glynn, Orlando Colon, <br>basses - Gabriel Mendlow, Andrew Clateman <br><br>Three pieces by John Dowland: Lachrimae, The Frog <br>Galliard, and Forlorn Hope Fancy were performed by Wim <br>Hoogewerf. Dowland's "personal tuning" uses<br>perfect ji thirds and fifths yet still contains some intervals <br>that enrich and color (IMHO) the tuning. Like the Gabrieli, <br>the ambient St. Paul's contributed to the<br>performance. <br><br>just intonation guitar - Wim Hoogewerf <br><br>Johnny Reinhard's Eye of Newt is another of his works <br>in polymicrotonality - where more then one tuning is used. <br>His technique of using more then one tuning<br>creates frequent unexpected changes in mood. Multiphonics <br>and singing through his alto recorder adds harmony to this potion. <br><br>alto recorder - Johnny Reinhard <br><br>Ei, Wie der Kaffee ist Suisse by J. S. Bach for <br>soprano, flute and harpsichord in Werkmeister III. A <br>wonderful piece that gives the soprano a chance to <br>sing about how wonderful coffee is. Unfortunately the <br>chapel drank this one up, obscuring the details. <br><br>soprano - Meredith Borden <br>baroque flute - Andrew Bolotowsky <br>harpsichord - Rebecca Pechefsky <br><br>One of the most anticipated events of the festival was <br>the NY premiere of the solo version of Harry Partch's <br>Barstow by John Schneider. The result of historical<br>research, Schneider had a custom guitar built based <br>on Partch's notes. Schneider released a version of <br>Barstow on Just West Coast - microtonal music for guitar and<br>harp (Bridge) a few years ago and he's refined his approach <br>since then. Now his Partchian sprechgesang is a bit more <br>approprate to the piece. <br><br>After the concert I asked Schneider about his future plans <br>for microtonal guitar recordings and was told that he's <br>planning to record or has unreleased recordings of<br>works by Partch (US Highball for guitar and voice), La Monte <br>Young (a newer composer supervised slower version of <br>Sarabande), more works by Lou Harrison and others including <br>his own compositions. <br><br>Partch monophonic-model guitar - John Schneider <br>                                                  <br>Shruti is the 22 interval scale of India and also the title <br>of Ganesh Anandan's contribution to the festival. He <br>played his homemade percussion, metal bars resting<br>on foam and resonators and then sang in a gruff overtone <br>style. NY premiere. <br><br>extended voice, original instruments - Ganesh Anandan <br><br>Andrew Culver's Architectonic Space placed the musicians <br>spatially around the chapel. The trumpet in the balcony, the <br>violin in the pulpit, the viola to the side near the pews and <br>so on. Culver's purely minimalistic held tones disregard the<br>obsessive rhythmic cells favored by most minimalists, the <br>primary influences seem to be John Cage and La Monte Young. <br><br>A Tuning Digest buddy said that listening to Architectonic <br>Space was like watching paint dry. I happen to like this kind <br>of zen minimalism, but think that the composer<br>missed a great opportunity to explore the rich resources <br>of higher limit just intonation systems. NY premiere. <br><br>alto flute - Andrew Bolotowsky <br>bass clarinet - Ron Kozak <br>bassoon - Johnny Reinhard <br>violin - Dan Auerbach <br>viola - Anastasia Solberg <br>cello - Jodi Beder <br>trumpet - John Charles Thomas <br><br>The Quarter tone Preludio a Colon by Julian Carrillo <br>also used occasional eighth tones. It's pieces like this <br>that spark up a festival like this, the tuning is so far out<br>that there's no doubt that it's not in the much too common <br>12 tone equal temperament. Icing on the cake! <br><br>soprano - Meredith Borden <br>flute - Andrew Bolotowsky <br>violins - Dan Auerbach, Tina Cho <br>viola - Anastasia Solberg <br>cello - Jodi Beder <br>24 tone equal temperament guitar - Wim Hoogewerf <br>96 tone equal temperament harp - Skip LaPlante <br>conductor - Johnny Reinhard <br><br>My picks: Barstow, Preludio A Colon and Eye of Newt. Not that there was<br>anything wrong with the other works. Just my personal highlights. <br><br>Stay tuned for more... <br><br>db <br>5/26/97 <br><br>Part one of this series of reviews is at url:<br>www.virtulink.com/immp/jux/j_index.htm<br><br>Information about the American Festival of Microtonal Music:<br>http://www.echonyc.com/~jhhl/AFMM/ <br><br><br>D a v i d   B e a r d s l e y .. dmb5561719@aol.com <br>      *            ..    *    ... .*             ....     *......   .<br>            ..*    I M M P  &  B i i n k!   m  u  s  i  c<br>. ..    *             ..                 ..           * ..             <br>J u x t a p o s i t i o n Ezine    *          . ..        *<br> . .*.. .           .. .     .    .*.   . . .     . ..       ..<br>      http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm<br>  . ..         .*..            . .. .           ..*.     .    ..   . *. <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 27 May 1997 01:07 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00734; Tue, 27 May 1997 01:07:50 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 27 May 1997 01:07:50 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00732<br>Received: (qmail 13101 invoked from network); 26 May 1997 23:07:47 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 26 May 1997 23:07:47 -0000<br>Message-Id: <Pine.BSI.3.91.970526130213.25258A-100000@lehua.ilhawaii.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>AFMM MicroMay '97 - May 21, NYC</h1><h3><a id=5548 href="#5548">ðŸ”—</a>DMB5561719@aol.com</h3><span>5/26/1997 11:43:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>American Festival of Microtonal Music <br>MicroMay '97 <br>Day #2: "Jewel" <br>Columbia University's St. Paul's Chapel <br>New York, N.Y.
