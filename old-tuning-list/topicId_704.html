It would have been interesting to hear Johnny's<br>comments on this Lincoln Center concert, but he has stated that he did not<br>attend it.<br><br>>The truth is that Partch decried recordings for their abstract nature, <br>>while creating the Gate 5 label for his music, an early an successful Indie.'<br><br>What on Earth is the point here?

If one takes a historical perspective on Partch's reasons for<br>recording, including the fact that some of the early Gate 5 recordings were<br>sold on a *subscription* basis, to underwrite productions of the works, one<br>can see that recordings for Harry were a 'means to an end', not a shortcut<br>or a quick buck.  And, though he continued to sell the Gate 5 recordings for<br>many years, it would be a stretch of monumental proportions to label <g> him<br>a "successful Indie".<br><br>>The truth is that their are many versions of Harry Partch's music where <br>>instruments are exchanged and different music is substituted (e.g. 3 <br>>versions of both Barstow and U.S. Highball).<br><br>Oh, please.  Is this a rational for substituting bassoon and calliope?<br>Sackbutts and bandoneons?  That Partch had more than one version of a given<br>work can traced more to the growth in his 'orchestral' pallette, through the<br>design and building of new instruments, than to any inherent<br>'wishy-washy-ness' on his part in terms of arrangement.  That growth-curve,<br>as both a composer and ensemble builder paralleled his expansion of both One<br>Voice and Corporeality in a long arc: <br><br>"I myself sang and played one instrument,often entirely alone, for some<br>sixteen years (1930-1947): Li Po poems, Biblical passages, hitchhiker<br>inscriptions, and the transcontinental freight-train trip, U.S. Highball.<br>Yet the step from those somewhat less than epic presentations to the<br>profound Sophocles drama, Oedipus, was to me most logical."

Does it follow then that the<br>differences between two evenings' performances of "Castor and Pollux" by the<br>Partch Ensemble are the equivalent to the differences between one of those<br>performances and one by the Garfield Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps?<br><br>Point Two: Ah, the rubber band analogy.  Johnny seems to take perverse<br>delight in one of Harry's less 'high-tech' construction methods; too bad --<br>it's fun changing those rubber bands.  Keeps ones' ego in check.  Reminds<br>you of the temporal nature of our life on the planet, or something.  But<br>seriously, from 1974 to 1987 there was no 'updating, replacing or improving'<br>done to the instruments, with one exception: a new Boo was constructed, but<br>it was done as a completion of a project that Harry himself had started (he<br>had experimented with the phenolic resin tubes himself, and was eager to<br>build a more durable instrument.

A cent is 1/100 of the traditional<br>half step, so indeed 200 cents/step would give you a wholetone scale, 50 would<br>give you a quartone scale, and so forth.  <br><br>   The formula for how to set your XP-50 for a "N"TET ("N" Tone-per-octave<br>Equal-Temperament) scale is 1200/N.  That comes from the fact that, since there<br>are 100 cents per half step, and 12 half-steps per octave, you get 1200 cents<br>per octave.  So if you want to split that octave up into 17 equal parts instead<br>of 12, you'll get 1200/17 = 70.6 (approx).  <br><br>   That much you appear to have figured out.  What you appear to be looking for<br>- how far off the resultant octaves will be - is pretty easy to figure out by<br>reversing that formula.  If you do 17TET for example as 70-cent steps, your<br>octave will have a size of 70 cents/step times 17 steps per near-octave, which<br>works out to 1190 cents per near-octave.  That then puts your near-octave 10<br>cents flat of the precise 1200-cent octave.  That's not great.  <br><br>   As for microtonal equal-temperaments to try, you correctly identified<br>several:  17TET, 24TET, and 31TET.  Most microtonal equal-temperament folks<br>agree though that the easiest equal-temperament to break into from our common<br>12TET heritage is 19TET.  As luck would have it, tuning 19TET as 63 cents per<br>step will give you a 1197-cent near-octave, which you'll probably close enough.<br>You can play a fairly traditional-sounding major scale in 19TET by making each<br>whole step span 3 19TET steps, and a half-step span 2 19TET steps.  <br><br>   Others you can try that are known to sound interesting 9TET (133 cents per<br>step), 7TET (171c), 22TET (54c, which unfortunately will give you a dreadfully<br>false octave), 34TET (35c), and 41 (29c, also a mediocre off octave).<br>(Curiously, 9TET and 7TET will give you that exact same 1197-cent near-octave<br>you'll get with a 63-cent approximation of 19TET.)<br><br>   Or if you want to try out the really strange stuff, you can try some of Wendy<br>Carlos' nonoctave tunings, notably "Alpha" at 78 cents per step, and "Beta" at<br>64 cents per step.  My current fascination is a nonoctave tuning of 88 cents per<br>step, which is the "88CET" tuning I keep droning on and on endlessly about.  I<br>don't recommend 88CET for beginners though;  I suspect you'll find it a very<br>difficult tuning to make sense of.  <br><br>   As for recordings to get a hold of, I definitely recommend three among many<br>others:<br>* Easley Blackwood's CD of 19 Etudes in equal-temperaments 13-24.<br>* If you're into popular genres, Neil Haverstick's album (cassette only left) <br>  of roughly 2/3 19TET, mostly R&B guitar.<br>* If you're into ambientish music, Ivor Darreg's CD has a good survey of various<br>  equal-temperaments.  <br><br>   And finally, as for microtonal guitar work, it turns out that the guitar is<br>an excellent instrument for exploring unusual tunings.  Not only is it a<br>versatile instrument as a whole, with a (frequently anyway) easy-going aura, but<br>your basic playing technique alters FAR less than keyboards when you switch from<br>one tuning to the next.  Although Neil Haverstick is one of the most virtuosic -<br>possibly THE most - microtonal guitarists out there (Jon Catler is certain<br>exceptionally good as well), many others use guitars as well.  Ivor Darreg had<br>guitars fretted to ever equal-temperament from 10 to 24 if I recall correctly.<br>I've used them as well, and Tom Stone even ran a (barely) for-profit company<br>that produced interchangeable-fingerboard guitars for many hears.  Unfortunately<br>they are defunct now, but ... aaargh I can't remember his name ... kinda-sorta<br>took it over.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 8 Aug 1996 08:03 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17240; Thu, 8 Aug 1996 08:02:26 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA17407<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id XAA28078; Wed, 7 Aug 1996 23:03:13 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 7 Aug 1996 23:03:13 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199608080600.AAA03838@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Reinhard Redux: Partch thoughts...</h1><h3><a id=3370 href="#3370">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Jonathan M.

As luck would have it, tuning 19TET as 63 cents per<br>step will give you a 1197-cent near-octave, which you'll probably close enough.<br>You can play a fairly traditional-sounding major scale in 19TET by making each<br>whole step span 3 19TET steps, and a half-step span 2 19TET steps.  <br><br>   Others you can try that are known to sound interesting 9TET (133 cents per<br>step), 7TET (171c), 22TET (54c, which unfortunately will give you a dreadfully<br>false octave), 34TET (35c), and 41 (29c, also a mediocre off octave).<br>(Curiously, 9TET and 7TET will give you that exact same 1197-cent near-octave<br>you'll get with a 63-cent approximation of 19TET.)<br><br>   Or if you want to try out the really strange stuff, you can try some of Wendy<br>Carlos' nonoctave tunings, notably "Alpha" at 78 cents per step, and "Beta" at<br>64 cents per step.  My current fascination is a nonoctave tuning of 88 cents per<br>step, which is the "88CET" tuning I keep droning on and on endlessly about.  I<br>don't recommend 88CET for beginners though;  I suspect you'll find it a very<br>difficult tuning to make sense of.  <br><br>   As for recordings to get a hold of, I definitely recommend three among many<br>others:<br>* Easley Blackwood's CD of 19 Etudes in equal-temperaments 13-24.<br>* If you're into popular genres, Neil Haverstick's album (cassette only left) <br>  of roughly 2/3 19TET, mostly R&B guitar.<br>* If you're into ambientish music, Ivor Darreg's CD has a good survey of various<br>  equal-temperaments.  <br><br>   And finally, as for microtonal guitar work, it turns out that the guitar is<br>an excellent instrument for exploring unusual tunings.  Not only is it a<br>versatile instrument as a whole, with a (frequently anyway) easy-going aura, but<br>your basic playing technique alters FAR less than keyboards when you switch from<br>one tuning to the next.  Although Neil Haverstick is one of the most virtuosic -<br>possibly THE most - microtonal guitarists out there (Jon Catler is certain<br>exceptionally good as well), many others use guitars as well.  Ivor Darreg had<br>guitars fretted to ever equal-temperament from 10 to 24 if I recall correctly.<br>I've used them as well, and Tom Stone even ran a (barely) for-profit company<br>that produced interchangeable-fingerboard guitars for many hears.  Unfortunately<br>they are defunct now, but ... aaargh I can't remember his name ... kinda-sorta<br>took it over.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 8 Aug 1996 08:03 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17240; Thu, 8 Aug 1996 08:02:26 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA17407<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id XAA28078; Wed, 7 Aug 1996 23:03:13 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 7 Aug 1996 23:03:13 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199608080600.AAA03838@freenet.uchsc.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
