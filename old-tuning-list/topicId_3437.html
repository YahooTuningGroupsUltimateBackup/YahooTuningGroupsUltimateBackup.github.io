People who, inspite of<br>what they know about the topic, simply don't have the interpersonal<br>communication skills to keep the exchange of info productive.  They are<br>constantly in the center of a flame war, and generally cause a lot of "noise".<br>When the signal to noise ratio goes up, lists begin to lose members that have<br>a low tolerance to trash talk, regardless of what they may have to offer.  <br><br>There is only one way to keep a group free of these type of people.  It is<br>simple, non-threatening, cheap,  and fast.<br><br>     Do not respond to the antagonists!!    When  trolls gets no response to<br>their postings, they will leave.   It works every time.<br>     This will take a little self-discipline, as it is natural to react when<br>insulted, but if the membership of a list ignores troublemakers,  they will<br>soon be free of them.  <br>  So,  don't fight fire with fire, fight it with silence.  <br>Regards, <br>Ed Foote</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Maintaining the list</h1><h3><a id=7637 href="#7637">ðŸ”—</a>A440A &#x3C;A440A@aol.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/2/1998 2:05:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Greetings all, <br><br>      Every list I have been on has had a troll or two.
