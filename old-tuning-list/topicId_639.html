If Mr. Reinhard has used a synth <br>(BTW, I am no stranger to synthesis/sampling, as I use it as part of my profession), then he has <br>either ignored or simply not comprehended a Partch truism, the first of a few of them that I will <br>propose:<br><br>   'The works of Harry Partch are much more than ratios and rhythms; that would be but a small <br>    facet of the entire picture.'<br><br>I realize that the largest common interest in this group is the study, use of and furtherance of <br>alternative tuning systems (alternative to the dread 12-TET); nonetheless, *any* person desiring to <br>perform Partch's work must surely realize the greater challenge - to present the work with all of <br>it's music, lyrics, theatrics, movement, and lighting elements, and even the *original <br>instruments*, in place.  Why?  Well, how about out of respect for the composer himself?  Tough as <br>it is to swallow, if you are performing Partch's music for any reason other than to *truly* bring <br>it to the light of day and share it with audiences, you are probably engaging in some form of <br>self-indulgence.  It is, quite simply, a matter of artistic integrity.  And if you don't want to <br>listen to me about appropriate performance practice, here's a direct quote from Harry himself:<br><br>"These two ideas -- the idea of a musical instrument, and the idea of music for it -- grew <br>simultaneously.  They always have; there has never been an exception to it.  Now, as for the music <br>itself.  It is almost always a dramatic idea.  I can't think of more than two, maybe three or four, <br>small things that I have done as studies; that is to say, a study just to use musical materials.  <br>There is always an idea -- perhaps only a mood -- but usually a dramatic idea."<br><br>With his simultaneous (albeit long-in-coming) development of both his compositions and an ensemble <br>of instruments to perform them on, Partch created a fairly unique niche for himself (as did, to a <br>certain extent, Mr. Darreg).  The Chromelodeon, with it's funky keys, the furious pumping to get <br>air in the bellows, the knee-swell lever, the way you diminuendo by letting the air out -- yes, <br>with meticulous programming you could get, probably, close to the same effect.  We all know how <br>good 'close' is.  You could not, however, get the music out of it that Partch created *for that <br>instrument* (bear in mind that Harry could play, to a great degree, all of the parts that he wrote <br>for his ensemble; incredible...).  What you would certainly be missing is the sweating and pumping <br>meted out by a good Chromelodeonist.<br><br>About those *more* and *fewer* performances: those of us who knew Harry could not be happier if <br>there are more performances of his music -- just so long as they are faithful to the _intent_ of <br>Partch himself.  If they are to be transcriptions or with jury-rigged substitute instrumentations, <br>then, frankly, they are NOT the music of Harry Partch, but 43-tones-to-the-octave white bread with <br>Olestra spread on it.<br><br>Finally, about the instrumental ensemble itself.  It should be obvious, with there being only one <br>group of instruments that Partch built, that their care, upkeep, transportation and correct playing <br>techniques be guided by people who know from experience how to deal with them.  During the years I <br>worked and played in the Ensemble, I can tell you that a week didn't go by without some sort of <br>repair or maintenance was required.  Every time we went on the road I sweat bullets that the <br>packing job we all did would keep them safe during transport; every new member into the group was <br>carefully taught not to play the Cloud Chamber Bowls with ball-peen hammers <g>, etc.  With a group <br>of instruments such as these, where they would be cared for, and who would care for them, had to be <br>a crucial decision.  Harry only had one set while he was alive, and until someone can make copies <br>(where at all possible) we have only one set.  It must stay with someone who knows what they are <br>doing with them, for now and for any future that they will have.  How many of you out there <br>actually watched Harry play the Bowls, or one of the Kitharas, or how to replace a light bulb on <br>the Mazda Marimba?  I though so...  Let us not forget: these instruments were Harry's private <br>property, to be left in the hands of the Harry Partch Foundation to ensure their care and <br>longevity.  They are not public artworks to be naively mishandled by well-meaning devotees.  No one <br>has any *right* to these instruments just because they are interested in the music itself.  These <br>matters were dealt with by Harry himself, as HE saw fit.  Who better to decide?<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Yikes - I've only addressed the first point (albeit a crucial one) so far.  I will stop for now and <br>continue with the "Li Po" settings.
