I am wondering<br>>whether Denny or any other contributor to this list would be interested<br>>in providing evidence for these last statements, as they apply to all<br>>musicians in all societies at all times, from the beginning of human<br>>(and animal?) history.

Your question has<br>stimulated discussion within our membership and has led us to make a<br>decision to modify the statement that you questioned.<br>        What is not apparent with the present wording, is that while some<br>just intonation composers (including Erv Wilson, Warren Burt, Brian McLaren<br>and myself) often use unconventional intervals with higher numbers in the<br>ratios of their frequencies (and as David Canright has shown, even the<br>intervals of equal temperaments can be measured in terms of frequency<br>ratios), this is not the practice of most just intonation enthusiasts (The<br>usual approach being to use the smaller number ratios).<br>        Also, while many musicians do strive for the most resonant<br>intonation of whatever intervals they may decide to use, this cannot be<br>shown to be universal.<br>        So, thanks to your interest we are (at least for now) abandoning the<br>assertion that "It is therefore the starting place from which all indigenous<br>musical traditions began" and will modify our web page accordingly.<br><br><br><br>Best wishes,<br><br>Denny Genovese<br>Director<br><br>Southeast Just Intonation Center            sejic@afn.org<br>World Harmony Project Inc.<br>PO Box 15464                                http://www.afn.org/~sejic<br>Gainesville, FL 32604  USA<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Manuel.op.de.Coul@ezh.nl<br>Subject:  web site<br>PostedDate:  08-08-97 18:24:11<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  08-08-97 18:24:17-08-08-97 18:24:18,08-08-97 18:22:46-08-08-97 18:22:46<br>DeliveredDate:  08-08-97 18:22:46<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564ED.005A1901; Fri, 8 Aug 1997 18:24:06 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06432; Fri, 8 Aug 1997 18:24:11 +0200<br>Date: Fri, 8 Aug 1997 18:24:11 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06421<br>Received: (qmail 3145 invoked from network); 8 Aug 1997 16:24:05 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 8 Aug 1997 16:24:05 -0000<br>Message-Id: <C12564ED.0058705B.00@notesrv2.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Just Intonation in World Music</h1><h3><a id=5942 href="#5942">ðŸ”—</a>sejic@nersp.nerdc.ufl.edu (World Harmony Project Inc.)</h3><span>8/7/1997 9:43:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Date: Sat, 02 Aug 1997 15:18:42 -0300<br>>From: "Andrew L.
