My friend HITOMI SHIMIZU is running a <br>rock band named SYZYGYS and is using organ (it's a curio) retuned under HARRY'<br>s 43-tone method. It sound really friendly <br>and that's the reason why I began to get rid of FLETS of my string instruments<br>. The other influence had been given to me by a post-minimalist(?)
