Here's a quote from Danielou's book which is very interesting <br>to me..."As noted by Raouf Yekta Bey, `Music, like the other mathematical <br>seciences, is a science whose laws are fixed and invariable. Just as two <br>and two make four in the East as well as in the West, the fundamental <br>laws of music apply at all times and for all peoples.`"<br>    I know I'm out of my element just a bit in the math end of things, <br>but the basic principles are the issue here. Forgive me if I didn't get <br>it quite right, but I believe Starrett said that the Harmonic series was <br>more of a mental construct than a physical reality, because nothing in <br>Nature vibrates precisely at the frequencies of the Harmonic series. If <br>this be the case, then what's all the fuss about "just intonation" in the <br>first place? However, the above quote by Bey seems to be pointing to some <br>profound issues about music, issues which I have been giving great <br>thought to in the last few months. I have a feeling that there ARE exact <br>mathematical correspondences in the very fabric of sound, correspondences <br>of deep significance, relationships that, in the "old" days (and maybe <br>even now), could be applied to healing and other forms of extra musical <br>activities. It's been mentioned here before, but various texts mention <br>rather "magical" occurences connected to certain musical sounds, as in <br>the Book of the Hopi (by Frank Waters), when the Hopi spiritual leaders <br>healed themselves of severe wounds by the beautiful sounds of their <br>flutes. Danielou also mentions scales that were used for healing in the <br>ancient Middle East, and don't forget the battle of Jericho, when blasts <br>from trumpets made walls collapse.<br>    For me, this is a serious pursuit, and one which I know next to <br>nothing about; but, I truly believe that there may be a lot more to music <br>than we know at this time. I believe it is quite possible that we (mainly <br>westerners and those influenced by our way of life) have lost a lot of <br>important knowledge pertaining to the foundations of sound, and how sound <br>can be used in more ways than just making music for our enjoyment or <br>entertainment. I believe that the Harmonic series is real, but perhaps <br>there's more to it than I know at this time. <br>    If it IS true, as Bey says, that the laws of music are "fixed and <br>invariable", than what are we really doing when we create temperaments <br>that deviate from the purity of these laws? Do we know, or care? Do we <br>even believe there is a Creator who created the Harmonic laws? Again, <br>this is no joke to me, and this is a subject that I think is worthy of <br>much thought and study, as it may have a direct relationship to our <br>existance in this world. I also have noticed that, at least up to this <br>time, this is probably the least talked about subject on this forum; or, <br>anywhere else, for that matter.
