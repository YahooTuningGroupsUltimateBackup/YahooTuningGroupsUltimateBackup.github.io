I<br>had a great time at the meeting and took a post-conference trip to Bangkok<br>for a couple of days and just got back to San Diego. As a result, I'm<br>(dis)oriented and somewhat decerebrate today. <br><br>On behalf of Phil Burk, Larry Polansky, Bill Sethares, and myself, I <br>would <br>like to especially thank Linus Liu for his hospitality and assistance. <br>Linus, who lives in the New Territories, took all of us to a store which <br>sells traditional Chinese musical instruments (as well as pianos and  <br>violins). The store is near the Sheung Wan MTR stop, but it is not very <br>obvious and we would have never found it on our own. Various of us bought <br>erhu_s, sho_s, and a gong (LP). P'ip'a_s, sheng_s, flutes, banjos and <br>other <br>instruments were available at quite low prices. <br><br>--John<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 30 Aug 1996 00:01 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06896; Fri, 30 Aug 1996 00:03:09 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06741<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id PAA16306; Thu, 29 Aug 1996 15:03:08 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 29 Aug 1996 15:03:08 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960829145852.18317B-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>ICMC, Tuning List, Linus Liu</h1><h3><a id=3492 href="#3492">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/1996 3:01:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I just returned from the ICMC 96 meeting in Hong Kong, where, I am happy to<br>report, more than a dozen members of the tuning list were present.
