I suspect that some of the rest of you<br>might want to ponder the following comments as well.<br><br><br><br>>  Differences in timbre are accounted for by the attack transient (which is<br>> what makes realtime pitch detection such a bear) and the relative<br>> strengths of harmonics in the sound.  Correct?<br><br>   For a given tone from that instrument, yes, those are definitely the main<br>factors.<br><br>   But I think that there are two factors that are equally important:  The<br>patterns of timbres (as defined by those attributes) across the entire<br>instrument, and how the instrument is performed.<br><br>   Along the first lines - or perhaps both lines - I have recently become<br>aware of a curious consideration with regard to synthesizing purely "fantasy"<br>timbres - timbres not intended to resemble anything we're particularly<br>familiar with:  It's a whole lot more difficult to do than most of us<br>realize.  Synthesizer programmers tend to think of the various instrumental<br>timbres as pillars of recognizability in a vast sea of timbral possibilities.<br><br>   I've found that the opposite is much closer to the truth:  Viewed as<br>individual tones, instrumental timbres are *anything but* narrow pillars in<br>timbral space.  There is instead a huge amount of variation in what we would<br>call, for example, a clarinet tone, and that varied gamut overlaps profusely<br>with flute, saxophone, trumpet, and even oboe tones.<br><br>   So our ears use several other cues to identify an instrument, not the<br>least of which is its timbral register content.  As an example, the fact that<br>saxophones have an especially prominent dulling of its timbre upon crossing<br>from notated C# to D (second space to second line) is a very big clue to our<br>ears that we're hearing a saxophone.  An instrument losing high-harmonic<br>content in their upper registers is a pretty strong clue that you're more<br>likely listening to a wind instrument than a string instrument.<br><br>   A closely-related, but probably even more important characteristic in<br>identifying an instrument, is its range.  Probably the deadest of giveaways<br>to suggest that you're listening to an electronic simulation of an instrument<br>rather than the proverbial real thing is playing a note out of its range,<br>especially below its range, since the lower-end of most instruments' range is<br>more clearly defined than the upper end.  This is one of the very few places<br>where a pianist actually has a disadvantage in composition:  They're used to<br>a continuous gamut spanning almost our entire range of hearing.  Instrumental<br>range limitations seem difficult to accept, whereas to performers of<br>orchestral instruments, that's just a normal fact of life.<br><br>   Another related rare case where pianists seem to be at a disadvantage in<br>composition, is in the concept of transposing instruments.  I remember it<br>once taking about five minutes to explain the concept to one of the best<br>musicians - a lifetime pianist - in one of my ear-training classes.  In her<br>defense, I should point out that she understood what I was describing almost<br>immediately, but promptly dismissed that idea as almost surely a<br>misunderstanding.  When she finally realized that she did indeed understand<br>my suggestion correctly the first time, she spent a few minutes convinced<br>that I kidding.<br><br>   Thankfully only occasionally, I sometimes hear another rather amusing dead<br>giveaway that you're actually using a sampled simulation of an instrument:<br>Failure to stick to a fixed complement of instrument parts.  I have heard, in<br>what was intended as an orchestral or small-ensemble simulation, duet of ...<br>flutes, say ... suddenly blossom into four or five just for couple notes or<br>so.  You can semiarbitrarily add notes to fill in harmony at will on a<br>keyboard instrument, but there's just no way that a symphony orchestra, or<br>most other ensembles, will hire three or four extra flutists just to play a<br>note or two here and there!  You have to think in terms of a predefined<br>combination of monophonic parts from the start.<br><br>   But anyway, another consideration that can make a lot of difference in<br>deciding what instrument we're listening to is how we play the instrument.<br>An extreme case of this is perhaps the Rhodes-style electric piano.  At its<br>theoretical basis, there's no reason at all why it should sound even mildly<br>reminiscent of a real piano:  As I understand it, they use - essentially -<br>tuning forks, whereas real pianos of course use courses of strings.  But even<br>though piano strings produce very complex overtone structures and tuning<br>forks put out almost exact sinewaves, the fact that it's being played<br>stylistically similarly with a piano reminds us so much of a piano that we're<br>fooled into thinking that it sounds kind of like a real piano.<br><br>   Granted, another big part of that electric piano illusion is due to the<br>fact that the two instruments' attack and envelope characteristics are<br>similar.  Even still though, a surprising amount of what we identify as<br>characteristic of a particular instrument are embodied in playing style.<br>Often these are things that go easily unnoticed:  As another example,<br>classical brass playing style doesn't allow for much vibrato.  The same is<br>true for classical clarinet style, but vibrato is fine for other woodwinds.<br>The result is that a saxophone can sound surprisingly brass-like by simply<br>playing a bright tone with no vibrato.  Since saxophone technique normally<br>uses plenty of vibrato, when you forego it, the effect starts to remind us<br>more of a brass instrument.<br><br>   The really unfortunate part of all this is that there's not very much room<br>for interpretation in our audience's ears.  You might be tempted to say,<br>"hey, I don't have to stick with exact simulations of acoustic instruments;<br>I'd like to instead use slight variations on them, like a violin without<br>vibrato so as not to pollute the beatlessness of just intonation".  I<br>reeeeeeally don't recommend that approach!  People are extremely picky about<br>such things.  If a tone you create sounds sufficiently like a violin, they'll<br>immediately say "AAAAACCCCK, where's the vibrato?!", and the result will be<br>something that they don't like.<br><br>   In summary then, I've found that, in coming up with electronic "fantasy<br>sounds" it's a lot more difficult than it might seem to *NOT* give people the<br>impression of it being a well-known instrument.  And if you invoke that<br>impression, you pretty much need to "go all the way" and reproduce that<br>instrument sound perfectly, or some people will get upset.<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1491<br>*************************</div><h3><a id=8551 href="#8551">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/1998 12:46:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I've just read through a copy of _Lou Harrison: Composing a World_ by Let=<br>a<br>Miller and Frederic Lieberman (Oxford University Press, 1998) and recomme=<br>nd<br>it -- and the accompanying audio cd -- without reservations.<br><br>The authors have made an elegant and entertaining read through the life a=<br>nd<br>works of this unique figure in the world's musical lanscape.
