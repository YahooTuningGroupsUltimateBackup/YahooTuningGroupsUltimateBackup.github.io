It has much better 7-limit approximations than 19et, and<br>>will even get you as close to the 11-limit as Harry Partch's own voice<br>>could (max. error 20.1 cents). 34et is not consistent beyond the<br>>5-limit.<br><br>There are a coupla problems here.  First, the author uses the cents<br>deviation method to compare 22et to various forms of JI.  While this can be<br>useful to say how far one interval is from another, it cannot be used to<br>compare the consonance of one interval to another.  Consonance is a factor<br>of the size the number in an intervals ratio.<br><br>For example.  An interval 16 cents flat of the sublime 6/5 has frequency<br>ratio 19723/16585.  This, of course, is our quite dissonant 12et minor<br>third.  An interval 18 cents flat of the 6/5 bears ratio 19/16.  It is a<br>very consonant minor third found in the duple 16-32 of the harmonic series<br>(or, to use Denny Genovese's excellent syntax: Mode 16 of the harmonic series).<br><br>Second, he is making a statement about the accuracy of Partch's voice.<br>There are so many ways to measure this (and I doubt any can be any good),<br>that this data is useless without knowing how it was measured.<br><br>Third, he says "max error 20.1 cents".  Here, he is probably referring to<br>22et, in which case the maximum is the kind of error to consider.  But, to<br>make his statement about getting as close as "Partch's own voice could"<br>work, he must use minimum error when referring to Partch's voice.  Partch<br>wouldn't sing with a minimum error of 20 cents if he was drunk.<br><br>Lastly, the author assumes that Partch was trying to imitate 11-limit<br>intervals when he sang.  This is the classic ploy of the<br>cents-deviation-user: get the intervals within the tuning error of a common<br>instrument and they might as well be the same.  If Partch thought this, he<br>too should be told that performance is divine; it doesn't imitate anything.<br><br>(Incidentally, I don't think Partch thought that.  He seems to be stretching<br>when he uses the fact that the higher identities are more sensitive to<br>mis-tuning against many ET's in Chapter 17 of Genesis, although this is also<br>an important consideration.)<br><br>To put it another way, and to touch upon the pop in microtones issue<br>(again!?), we might think music consisted of two parts: Composition and<br>Performance.  This can work even if the two take place simultaneously (as in<br>improvisation).<br><br>Composition is done within a framework, beit 12et, 11-limit JI, or even the<br>Alvian "free JI" (in this case the framework is Mr. Alves' style of using<br>ratios, and bravo to his cut on the tape swap).<br><br>Performance is done within a sound-making device.  Only on the sound-making<br>devices of keyboards and fretted strings are Composition and Performance<br>working with the same pitches.<br><br>The rest of the time, one of two things happen: Performance exceeds<br>Composition or Composition exceeds Performance.  In the case of Barbershop<br>singing, or in Reinhard's favorite Pink Floyd, the Performance is correcting<br>for the deficiencies used in the (12et) Composition.  In the case of<br>Stravinsky, Honeggar, and Shostakovitch, the Performance is mistuning the<br>Composition (which could sound as well as it controls your mind).<br><br>The point is that the finished product, music, is what it is.
