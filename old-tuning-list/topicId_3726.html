We talk about a <br>fixed temperament, such that, as Paul H put it:      <br><br>>An interval vanishes in a particular ET (or quasi-ET like a<br>>well-temperament) if it is represented by 0 scale degrees. <br><br>And we talk about a comma as an 'elastic' interval, the acceptable <br>leeway employed by a violinist or clarinetist when taking a tone <br>(for example) as either major (9/8) or minor (10/9) (the difference <br>between the two being 81/80) in different situations, or some <br>approximation of either.  A 'comma' is an anomaly <br>specifically resulting from combinations of just intervals (or <br>equivalent tempered intervals); it is also (more or less) the <br>ambit of an interval within which performers adjust their intonation <br>in certain circumstances.  Well, this is the way I've always thought <br>of it.  OK? <br><br>Therefore, going from what Pauls H and E wrote - is a  *disappearing* <br>comma something which belongs exclusively to the logic of a <br>temperament?  Or is the phrase 'disappearing comma' sometimes used <br>equally to refer to intonational 'disappearance' in commatic <br>performance adjustments?  ('disappearing' in the sense of 'going <br>unnoticed')? I'm not clear on this - and maybe that's why my question <br>wasn't clear to Paul E.  I wrote:<br><br>>>Could anyone tell me - is there a unique theoretical limit at which<br>>>a comma (of different kinds?) may be said to disappear?<br><br>Paul E replied:<br><br>>I don't understand this--can you rephrase?<br><br>I'll try.  Is there an historically accepted limit to the size of <br>what will work as an effective 'performance comma' - (that is, from a <br>traditional harmonic point of view)?  Is that a question which is too <br>subjective to worry about? I have always assumed it could not be more <br>than about 21-24 cents.  I've tried some experiments with various <br>conventional and unconventional progressions, and in differing <br>temperaments and timbres, but so far they are inconclusive.  <br><br>Now, the reason I started looking at this is because I have been <br>trying to work out some ideas about consistency.   It occurred to <br>me, as both Pauls reactions seem to confirm, that the ancient notion <br>of a 'comma' is (kind of) the original root of the idea of <br>consistency. <br><br>I know that the following has been discussed on the list before, but <br>I'll just try to explain what I was trying (unsuccessfully) to work <br>out.  Both Pauls have been very kind in explaining some of this to me <br>off-list. Paul H has also explained a simple algorithm to show <br>whether an n-ET is level-p consistent at the m-limit.  The algorithm <br>goes something like this: (I'm dumping a bit of pre-written stuff <br>here) -<br><br>(i) choose the n-ET and the m-limit to be considered; <br>(ii) list the intervals which belong to the primary m-limit; <br>(iii) find the primary m-limit interval which is least well<br>approximated by the chosen n- ET; <br>(iv) add this interval to itself until the deviation from its <br>intended equivalent is greater than (1200/2n) cents; call the number <br>of additions at this point t. <br>(v) then n-ET is level-(t-1) consistent at the m-limit. <br><br>Thus inconsistency occurs when the combination of t m-limit ratios <br>diverges by more than half a step in n-ET from the expected <br>consistent combination of n-ET scale-steps.  This corresponds to our <br>intuitive notion of 'consistency' in everyday terms.  But a more <br>stringent criterion (from the point of view of intonation) might be <br>substituted - for example, the criterion could be changed to 1/3rd of <br>a step (by changing (1200/2n) to (1200/3n)) (as has been discussed <br>before).  Obviously, doing this changes the meaning of 'consistency'. <br><br>If we replace the expression (1200/2n) with (1200 x 21506/10000n) we <br>might track 'consistency' relative to the sytonic comma - which I <br>have assumed is the traditionally acceptable ambit of intonational <br>wandering in 'commatic situations'.  But I wanted to know if my <br>assumption was grounded.<br><br>Well, that's an inconclusive explanation of what I was trying to get <br>at.  I found both Pauls' responses interesting - but unfortunately I <br>soon get into difficulties making sense of their maths. I'm sorry to <br>be a useless correspondent in this respect, and also sorry that I <br>don't have adequate time at the moment to try harder.  <br><br>However - I was particularly interested in this bit (by Paul E):<br><br>> commas constructed from n-limit intervals are uniquely defined in all <br>>tunings consistent within the n-limit.
