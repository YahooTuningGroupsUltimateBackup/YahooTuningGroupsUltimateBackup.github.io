I have almost all<br>>the materials (and cut to size), and this weekend I'll probably drill the<br>>sound holes and do the necessary sanding and gluing.  There are some<br>>things I'm hoping you'll be able to help me out with since I've never<br>>built an instrument before, and I know you have experience with these<br>>things (I've read twice, with increasing fascination, your article in 1/1<br>>on your gender barung adventure).<br>><br>>        I'm planning to glue my walnut bridges to the box.  Do you think I<br>>should bolt them instead?<br>>        I'm planning  to drill holes in them and pass my .012 piano wires<br>>through.  Do you recommend passing the wires over instead?<br>>        Should I just avoid any kind of tarnish or stain all together for<br>>acoustical reasons (which are priority for me), or are there some<br>>beautifying liquids out there that'll bring out the natural grain of the<br>>wood without effecting anything else?<br>>        The book suggests pop rivets to hold down the strings at one end.<br>>Would something else be better?<br>>        Is there a special way to tie piano wire to zither tuning pegs?<br>><br>>        Thank you very much for taking the time to read this and I look<br>>forward to your response.<br>><br>>                                        -Sam Torrisi<br>><br>><br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
