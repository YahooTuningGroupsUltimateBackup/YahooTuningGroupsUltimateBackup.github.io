For some<br>reason, he thinks that this is a momentous discovery, as most people, he<br>surmises, would expect primitive Neanderthals to tend to space things<br>equally. He adopts as one of his assumptions: "As we humans seem to show,<br>there is a history of a predisposition toward equality in measurements: The<br>distances between telephone poles; between pickets; between windows on<br>buildings in the architecture of all periods and cultures; between sidewalk<br>slabs; between inches; feet, yards, centimeters -- between ranks and files<br>of all types, etc. "<br><br>I don't see what any of this has to do with music. Is any Paleolithic art<br>symmetrical? Does any of it show equality in measurements? I see no reason<br>to think that Neanderthals would develop a music based on equal<br>measurements on flute holes even if they liked to arrange their caves or<br>other dwellings with the stone age equivalent of regular sidewalk slabs.<br><br>That aside, Fink seems to equate unequal with diatonic, for some reason<br>that I cannot quite fathom. Diatonic means to me a seven note scale with a<br>certain sequence of tones and semitones, the tones being about twice the<br>size of the semitones. Now, he has only four tones on this flute. He<br>postulates a sequence of tone, tone, semitone, which will fit into a<br>diatonic scale, sure, but also a pelog scale, the in scale of Japan,<br>certain non-diatonic Eastern European scales, plenty of non-diatonic ragas,<br>and so on. Unless one stretches one's definition of "diatonic" to include<br>all of these scales, I don't see any reason to suppose that Neanderthals<br>were or were not using diatonic melodies. Also, by admitting the<br>possibility of neutral thirds, he is stretching the term diatonic quite<br>far.<br><br>Fink apparently has another publication which I have not seen in which he<br>argues that the diatonic and anhemitonic pentatonic scales are the best<br>musical representations of the harmonic series (what he calls the "overtone<br>series"). I'm afraid I'm at a loss to understand why four, six, or<br>forty-three tones per octave can't also model the harmonic series, or how<br>neutral thirds fit into this scheme, but then I haven't read this other<br>paper.<br><br>Fink, like some other writers, argues for the historic precendence of just<br>intonation, based only on the beauty and naturalness of the harmonic<br>series. Now, I love the sounds of many JI intervals, and I use JI in my<br>music, but to say that it is therefore the fundamental basis for all music<br>is to misunderstand what art is. This is not to say that the harmonic<br>series plays no role in the evolution of musical systems, I believe it<br>plays a very powerful one, but for some cultures, so does the mystical<br>value of a length of pipe, the ability to transpose, the tension resulting<br>from temperament, and so on.<br><br>Which of these many criteria were important to the Neanderthals? I sure as<br>hell don't know, and I don't think one fragment of a bone flute will tell<br>us. Perhaps it was different for the Neanderthals in Spain, or for the<br>Neanderthals living a hundred or a thousand years earlier or later.

For some<br>reason, he thinks that this is a momentous discovery, as most people, he<br>surmises, would expect primitive Neanderthals to tend to space things<br>equally. He adopts as one of his assumptions: "As we humans seem to show,<br>there is a history of a predisposition toward equality in measurements: The<br>distances between telephone poles; between pickets; between windows on<br>buildings in the architecture of all periods and cultures; between sidewalk<br>slabs; between inches; feet, yards, centimeters -- between ranks and files<br>of all types, etc. "<br><br>I don't see what any of this has to do with music.

Now, I love the sounds of many JI intervals, and I use JI in my<br>music, but to say that it is therefore the fundamental basis for all music<br>is to misunderstand what art is. This is not to say that the harmonic<br>series plays no role in the evolution of musical systems, I believe it<br>plays a very powerful one, but for some cultures, so does the mystical<br>value of a length of pipe, the ability to transpose, the tension resulting<br>from temperament, and so on.<br><br>Which of these many criteria were important to the Neanderthals?
