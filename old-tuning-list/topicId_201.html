That presumably also explains why his name ends in "s" rather than<br>the Spanish spelling with "z".)<br><br>   Anyway, he's new to xenharmonics, and is interested in thoughts on<br>synthesizers and PC software for xenharmonic work.  He's currently thinking<br>about an Ensoniq TS-12 with Finale.  <br><br>   He's making a move soon, so if you folks have any insights or advice you'd<br>like to give him, drop him a letter (he doesn't have E-mail yet).
