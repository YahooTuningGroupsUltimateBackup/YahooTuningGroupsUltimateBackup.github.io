Let me further clarify my query with the following<br>questions:<br><br>        1) Where does the 1/20 of a cent figure come from?  Does that mean<br>that there are 2000 (or probably 2048) possible frequency divisions between<br>a musical half step?<br><br>        2) In the hypothetical scenario where the pitch bend range is set<br>to 100 cents under the "Common" page, and MIDI pitch bend messages are sent<br>using an external sequencer to produce every possible value in step size of<br>1 unit (0,1,2,3...   ...8189,8190,8191) from 0 to 8191, how many unique<br>pitch values will the K2000 produce?  Is it capable of producing 8192<br>unique values?  Is the figure dependent upon the initial frequency of the<br>note?<br><br>        3)  Would I be correct in assuming that pitch bend messages affect<br>the absolute output frequency in an exponential fashion as in the 12Tet<br>model?  What I mean is, if I played A440 and with a pitch bend value of 256<br>(and pitch bend range was set to 100 cents) would the output frequency in<br>Hertz be equal to 440((2^(1/12))^(256/8192))=440.7949Hz?<br><br><br>        thanks...<br><br><br>        -andrew<br><br>Safe Journey...<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 5 Nov 1996 03:16 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05988; Sun, 3 Nov 1996 19:04:24 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08809<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id KAA08031; Sun, 3 Nov 1996 10:04:21 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 3 Nov 1996 10:04:21 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961103175928_71670.2576_HHB64-10@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Pitch Bend Tuning</h1><h3><a id=3924 href="#3924">ðŸ”—</a>asouter@scf-fs.usc.edu (Andrew Souter)</h3><span>11/4/1996 6:11:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Friends,<br><br><br>        I am attempting to use pitch bend messages sent by sequencer to a<br>K2000 to set frequency output to conform to JI ratios in a more perfect<br>fashion than possible using Global software tuning or other cent based<br>methods.<br><br>        I sent the following message to the list last week:<br><br>>        This is a rather basic question I know, but does anyone know what<br>>the tuning resolution of the K2000?
