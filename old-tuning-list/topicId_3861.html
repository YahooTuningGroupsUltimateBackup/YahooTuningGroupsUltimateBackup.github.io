Thus a monochrome laser<br>printer can, strictly speaking, produce only black and white dots, not<br>intermediate shades. A synthesizer with 768 or 1024 steps per octave<br>can produce only these tones, not the precise intermediate values<br>required for a given tuning scheme.<br><br>In the case of the laser printer, we can gain the visual effect of<br>intermediate shades of gray by a process of _halftoning_: grouping<br>black and white dots into repeated patterns, or halftone cells,<br>produces an impression of gray shading.<br><br>Similarly, with a microtunable synthesizer, it is possible to mix<br>slightly different interval sizes in order to approximate an<br>intermediate value. Here I shall first give a simple example of this<br>technique in approximating Pythagorean tuning with a synthesizer such<br>as the Yahama TX81Z having 768 steps per octave, and then consider the<br>somewhat more intricate example of approximating 17-tone equal<br>temperament (17-tet) on a device with 768 or 1024 steps per octave.<br><br>A possible term for this technique is _nano-temperament_, the<br>deliberate variation of intervals by very small quantities, typically<br>on the order of one synthesizer tuning unit (e.g. 1.5625 cents on a<br>768-step device, or 1.171875 cents on a 1024-step device). Since<br>"microtonal" variations are often somewhat larger, for example the<br>5.38-cent tempering of the fifth in 1/4-comma meantone, the term<br>"nano-temperament" may be descriptive.<br><br>In fact, nano-temperament may be a useful technique in generating a<br>wide variety of temperaments, for example different shades of<br>historical and contemporary meantone. The following examples, which<br>focus on a Gothic or Xeno-Gothic worldview where fifths and fourths<br>are the primary harmonic intervals, should be taken as a reflection of<br>one side of the author's tastes, not of the scope of the technique<br>itself.<br><br><br>----------------------------------<br>1. Nano-temperament: A simple case<br>----------------------------------<br><br>The problem of approximating a classic Pythagorean tuning on a<br>synthesizer provides a ready introduction to nano-temperament. <br>Interestingly, this is a case where in practice nano-temperament seems<br>useful on a 768-step device but superfluous on a 1024-step device.<br><br>Let us first consider the latter device, where each discrete tuning<br>step is equal to 1200/1024 or 1.171875 cents. As it happens, 599 of<br>these steps produce an interval of 701.953125 cents, or only about<br>002 cents narrower than a pure 3:2 fifth (about 701.955 cents).<br><br>While one might suspect that the choice of 1024 steps per octave as a<br>standard has more to do with the binary status of this number as 2^10<br>(making the octave a convenient digital kilostep) than with a taste<br>for precise Pythagorean tuning, nevertheless this choice generates an<br>extraordinarily close approximation of a just fifth.<br><br>With the very popular standard of 768 steps per octave, however, the<br>approximation is not quite so close. Taking 449 steps of 1200/768 or<br>1.5625 cents, we produce a fifth of 701.5625 cents, or about .3925<br>cents narrow.<br><br>If we consider only a single fifth, this is a very reasonable<br>approximation, being about five times closer to just than 12-tet, in<br>which fifths are often considered "nearly pure."<br><br>If we consider other intervals generated from a series of such fifths,<br>however, then this small error becomes cumulative, possibly having<br>tangible effects on the aural quality of such intervals.<br><br>Let us consider, for example, the Pythagorean major third. In Gothic<br>and related contexts, this is an active interval, ideally having a<br>ratio of 81:64 (about 407.82 cents). Four fifths of 701.5625 cents,<br>however, produce a slightly narrow major third of 406.25 cents, or<br>about 1.57 (.3925 x 4) cents smaller than our ideal size.<br><br>Is this a distinction with a musical difference? At least one author,<br>Easley Blackwood, suggests a demarcation line at around 406 cents as<br>the point where major thirds become too active to serve pleasingly as<br>points of harmonic repose -- corresponding in regular tunings to a<br>fifth of around 701.5 cents.[1] Thus if we want the extra bit of<br>"edge" that would make our major third unequivocally Pythagorean and<br>active, some adjustment might not be out of place.<br><br>Fortunately, it is possible to make this adjustment simply by making<br>one fifth out of four an extra tuning step large: 450 steps rather<br>than the usual 499. This yields a fifth of 703.125 cents, or about<br>1.17 cents wide -- almost exactly correcting the error of the other<br>three fifths, each .3925 cents narrow.<br><br>Nano-tempering one fifth out of each four in our tuning chain thus<br>produces a major third equal to three 449-step fifths plus one<br>450-step fifth. From this sum of 1797 steps, we factor out two octaves<br>(1536 steps), arriving at a size of 261 steps, or 407.8125 cents, only<br>about 0.0075 cents from an ideal 81:64.<br><br>Curiously, this is the same result we get with four equal fifths of<br>599 steps on a 1024-step device, which yields a major third with a<br>size of (2396 - 2048) or 348 steps, also 407.8125 cents. Such an<br>outcome is not so surprising, since three steps on a 768-step device<br>are equal to four steps on a 1024-step device. Both results, in fact,<br>are equivalent to 87 steps in 256-tet.<br><br><br>---------------------------------------------<br>1.1. Pythagorean nano-temperament in practice<br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>Applying these techniques to an actual chain of fifths, we might<br>choose the following scheme for 768-step devices, with "s" and "l"<br>meaning small and large fifths respectively:<br><br>           l    s   s   s   l   s   s   s   l    s    s           <br>768     Eb   Bb   F   C   G   D   A   E   B   F#   C#   G#<br><br>                   s = 449#768 = 701.56  cents<br>                   l = 450#768 = 703.125 cents<br><br>A nano-temperament of this kind involves a slight compromise in the<br>quality of the fifths intentionally tuned a bit further from just in<br>order to compensate for cumulative errors in the other direction. Such<br>compromises, fortunately, are typically much milder than those<br>encountered in traditional kinds of temperament. Here each wide fifth<br>of 703.125 cents, although three times as far from pure as the other<br>very slightly narrow fifths, is still only about 1.17 cents or about<br>1/20 Pythagorean comma from just. At c'-g' (the fifth on middle C),<br>this tempering would produce one beat each 1.88 seconds or so.<br><br>It should also be noticed that while all major thirds will have as<br>generating intervals three small fifths and one large fifth, thus all<br>sharing the same nearly-ideal Pythagorean size, other intervals will<br>vary somewhat.<br><br>For example, major sixths or minor thirds may result either from three<br>small fifths, or from two small fifths plus one large one. The former<br>arrangement results in a slightly "subdued" interval about 1.17 cents<br>narrower than 27:16 in the case of M6, or wider in the case of m3. The<br>latter arrangement produces an even more slightly "super-vibrant"<br>interval just .3925 cents narrower than a precise Pythagorean tuning<br>in the case of M6, and the same amount narrower for m3.<br><br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Topic No. 3<br>2. Nano-temperament for 17-tet<br>------------------------------<br><br>Topic No. 4<br><br>One way of viewing 17-tet is as a kind of exaggerated Pythagorean<br>tuning. Fifths are equal to ten scale steps of about 70.588 cents, or<br>705.88 cents. Major thirds are equal to six steps, or 423.53 cents,<br>roughly midway between the Pythagorean 81:64 (407.82 cents) and the<br>9:7 form of some extended just intonation systems (435.08 cents).<br>While the question of what to do with the latter interval might have<br>many answers, an obvious one from a medievalist viewpoint is "Let it<br>expand to a fifth by conjunct contrary motion."<br><br>This scale also provides a minor seventh (14 steps) of 988.24 cents,<br>about a third of the way from the Pythagorean 16:9 (996.09 cents) to a<br>7:4 (968.83 cents). The major second (3 steps) of 211.76 cents is<br>likewise about a third of the way from a Pythagorean 9:8 (203.91<br>cents) to 8:7 (231.17 cents).<br><br>Translating a scale step in 17-tet into sythesizer tuning units, we<br>find that one scale step equals about 45.176 units on a 768-step<br>device, or 60.235 units on a 1024-step device. Thus the closest<br>approximation to a scale step is 45 tuning units on a 768-step device<br>or 60 units on a 1024-step device, in either case 70.3125 cents (about<br>276 cents narrow).[2]<br><br>To correct for this error, we might add an extra tuning step for every<br>four scale steps on a 1024-step device, or every six steps on a<br>768-step device:<br><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>         17-tet                   768-tet              1024-tet           <br>interval steps  cents     steps  cents    +/-     steps   cents   +/-<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Unison    0     0.000      0     0.000   0.000      0      0.00  0.000<br>m2        1    70.588     46*   71.875  +1.287     61*   71.484 +0.896 <br>A1        2   141.176     91   142.188  +1.012    121   141.797 +0.621    <br>M2        3   211.765    136   212.500  +0.735    181   212.109 +0.346<br>m3        4   282.353    181   282.813  +0.460    241   282.422 +0.069<br>A2        5   352.941    226   353.125  +0.184    302*  353.906 +0.965<br>M3        6   423.529    271   423.437  -0.092    362   424.186 +0.657 <br>4         7   494.118    317*  495.313  +1.195    422   494.531 +0.413<br>d5        8   564.706    362   565.625  +0.919    482   564.844 +0.138<br>A4        9   635.294    407   635.938  +0.644    543*  636.328 +1.034<br>5        10   705.882    452   706.250  +0.368    603   706.641 +0.759<br>m6       11   776.471    497   776.563  +0.092    663   776.953 +0.482<br>d7       12   847.059    542   846.875  -0.184    723   847.266 +0.207<br>M6       13   917.647    588*  918.750  +1.103    784*  918.750 +1.103<br>m7       14   988.235    633   989.063  +0.827    844   989.063 +0.827<br>A6       15  1058.824    678  1059.375  +0.551    904  1059.375 +0.551<br>M7       16  1129.412    723  1129.688  +0.276    964  1129.688 +0.276<br>8        17  1200.000    768  1200.000   0.000   1024  1200.000  0.000        <br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>For both 768-tet and 1024-tet devices, an asterisk (*) indicates that<br>the last scale step has an extra tuning unit: 46 units (71.875 cents)<br>in 768-tet, and 61 units (71.484 cents) in 1024-tet.<br><br>Adding what might be called an "intercalary" tuning unit every six<br>steps in 768-tet or four steps in 1024-tet (rather like a leap year)<br>gives a close approximation of 17-tet.[3] However, this simple pattern<br>does cause some intervals to vary from their ideal size by more than<br>half of a tuning unit.

Conclusion<br>-------------<br><br>The method of nano-temperament seems useful in a range of musical<br>contexts, for example in approximating various shades of meantone.<br>Since a meantone major third is derived from four fifths, it is<br>possible by varying the size of _some_ of these fifths by one tuning<br>unit to achieve shades of _average_ temperament only 1/4 tuning unit<br>apart. The major thirds will vary by an amount four times this size: a<br>single tuning unit.<br><br>In many ways, nano-temperament presents a kinder and gentler version<br>of usual tuning dilemmas: some intervals are might slightly less pure<br>in order to avoid larger discrepancies or inconsistencies. As the use<br>of synthesizers for historical and new scales and temperaments becomes<br>more common, this technique invites further exploration.<br><br><br>                       ---------------------<br>                               Notes<br>                       ---------------------<br><br>1. Easley Blackwood, _The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_<br>(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985), pp. 202-203. Blackwood<br>sets "the largest permissible fifth" for music where thirds are stable<br>intervals at about 701.5 cents.<br><br>2. Pythagorean tuning enthusiasts may take note that a 17-tet step of<br>70.588 cents is not far from three Pythagorean commas of around 23.46<br>cents, or 70.38 cents. As it happens, both 768-tet and 1024-tet give<br>an excellent approximation of this comma with 15 and 20 tuning units<br>respectively, either yielding 23.4375 cents.<br><br>3. This "intercalary" metaphor is much indebted to Guido d'Arezzo, who<br>compares an octave to a week: "Just as when seven days have elapsed we<br>repeat the same ones, so that we always name the first and eighth days<br>the same; so we always represent and name the first and eighth notes<br>the same way..." See Guido's _Micrologus_ (c. 1030?), translated in<br>Warren Badd, tr., Claude V. Palisca, ed., _Hucbald, Guido, and John on<br>Music: Three Medieval Treatises_ (Yale University Press: New Haven,<br>1978), at p. 61. Guido's metaphor has a special appeal because the<br>term "octave" is indeed used in the liturgical calendar to signify the<br>interval of a week. Given the complexities of calendar reform,<br>possibly comparing an interval tuned slighter wider (or narrower) than<br>the closest approximation on a digital device to a "leap year" is not<br>so inapposite.<br><br>Margo Schulter<br>mschulter@value.net<br>22 July 1998</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Nano-temperament</h1><h3><a id=8276 href="#8276">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;M.

Four fifths of 701.5625 cents,<br>however, produce a slightly narrow major third of 406.25 cents, or<br>about 1.57 (.3925 x 4) cents smaller than our ideal size.<br><br>Is this a distinction with a musical difference? At least one author,<br>Easley Blackwood, suggests a demarcation line at around 406 cents as<br>the point where major thirds become too active to serve pleasingly as<br>points of harmonic repose -- corresponding in regular tunings to a<br>fifth of around 701.5 cents.[1] Thus if we want the extra bit of<br>"edge" that would make our major third unequivocally Pythagorean and<br>active, some adjustment might not be out of place.<br><br>Fortunately, it is possible to make this adjustment simply by making<br>one fifth out of four an extra tuning step large: 450 steps rather<br>than the usual 499. This yields a fifth of 703.125 cents, or about<br>1.17 cents wide -- almost exactly correcting the error of the other<br>three fifths, each .3925 cents narrow.<br><br>Nano-tempering one fifth out of each four in our tuning chain thus<br>produces a major third equal to three 449-step fifths plus one<br>450-step fifth. From this sum of 1797 steps, we factor out two octaves<br>(1536 steps), arriving at a size of 261 steps, or 407.8125 cents, only<br>about 0.0075 cents from an ideal 81:64.<br><br>Curiously, this is the same result we get with four equal fifths of<br>599 steps on a 1024-step device, which yields a major third with a<br>size of (2396 - 2048) or 348 steps, also 407.8125 cents. Such an<br>outcome is not so surprising, since three steps on a 768-step device<br>are equal to four steps on a 1024-step device. Both results, in fact,<br>are equivalent to 87 steps in 256-tet.<br><br><br>---------------------------------------------<br>1.1. Pythagorean nano-temperament in practice<br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>Applying these techniques to an actual chain of fifths, we might<br>choose the following scheme for 768-step devices, with "s" and "l"<br>meaning small and large fifths respectively:<br><br>           l    s   s   s   l   s   s   s   l    s    s           <br>768     Eb   Bb   F   C   G   D   A   E   B   F#   C#   G#<br><br>                   s = 449#768 = 701.56  cents<br>                   l = 450#768 = 703.125 cents<br><br>A nano-temperament of this kind involves a slight compromise in the<br>quality of the fifths intentionally tuned a bit further from just in<br>order to compensate for cumulative errors in the other direction. Such<br>compromises, fortunately, are typically much milder than those<br>encountered in traditional kinds of temperament. Here each wide fifth<br>of 703.125 cents, although three times as far from pure as the other<br>very slightly narrow fifths, is still only about 1.17 cents or about<br>1/20 Pythagorean comma from just. At c'-g' (the fifth on middle C),<br>this tempering would produce one beat each 1.88 seconds or so.<br><br>It should also be noticed that while all major thirds will have as<br>generating intervals three small fifths and one large fifth, thus all<br>sharing the same nearly-ideal Pythagorean size, other intervals will<br>vary somewhat.<br><br>For example, major sixths or minor thirds may result either from three<br>small fifths, or from two small fifths plus one large one. The former<br>arrangement results in a slightly "subdued" interval about 1.17 cents<br>narrower than 27:16 in the case of M6, or wider in the case of m3. The<br>latter arrangement produces an even more slightly "super-vibrant"<br>interval just .3925 cents narrower than a precise Pythagorean tuning<br>in the case of M6, and the same amount narrower for m3.<br><br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Topic No. 3<br>2. Nano-temperament for 17-tet<br>------------------------------<br><br>Topic No. 4<br><br>One way of viewing 17-tet is as a kind of exaggerated Pythagorean<br>tuning. Fifths are equal to ten scale steps of about 70.588 cents, or<br>705.88 cents. Major thirds are equal to six steps, or 423.53 cents,<br>roughly midway between the Pythagorean 81:64 (407.82 cents) and the<br>9:7 form of some extended just intonation systems (435.08 cents).<br>While the question of what to do with the latter interval might have<br>many answers, an obvious one from a medievalist viewpoint is "Let it<br>expand to a fifth by conjunct contrary motion."<br><br>This scale also provides a minor seventh (14 steps) of 988.24 cents,<br>about a third of the way from the Pythagorean 16:9 (996.09 cents) to a<br>7:4 (968.83 cents). The major second (3 steps) of 211.76 cents is<br>likewise about a third of the way from a Pythagorean 9:8 (203.91<br>cents) to 8:7 (231.17 cents).<br><br>Translating a scale step in 17-tet into sythesizer tuning units, we<br>find that one scale step equals about 45.176 units on a 768-step<br>device, or 60.235 units on a 1024-step device. Thus the closest<br>approximation to a scale step is 45 tuning units on a 768-step device<br>or 60 units on a 1024-step device, in either case 70.3125 cents (about<br>276 cents narrow).[2]<br><br>To correct for this error, we might add an extra tuning step for every<br>four scale steps on a 1024-step device, or every six steps on a<br>768-step device:<br><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>         17-tet                   768-tet              1024-tet           <br>interval steps  cents     steps  cents    +/-     steps   cents   +/-<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Unison    0     0.000      0     0.000   0.000      0      0.00  0.000<br>m2        1    70.588     46*   71.875  +1.287     61*   71.484 +0.896 <br>A1        2   141.176     91   142.188  +1.012    121   141.797 +0.621    <br>M2        3   211.765    136   212.500  +0.735    181   212.109 +0.346<br>m3        4   282.353    181   282.813  +0.460    241   282.422 +0.069<br>A2        5   352.941    226   353.125  +0.184    302*  353.906 +0.965<br>M3        6   423.529    271   423.437  -0.092    362   424.186 +0.657 <br>4         7   494.118    317*  495.313  +1.195    422   494.531 +0.413<br>d5        8   564.706    362   565.625  +0.919    482   564.844 +0.138<br>A4        9   635.294    407   635.938  +0.644    543*  636.328 +1.034<br>5        10   705.882    452   706.250  +0.368    603   706.641 +0.759<br>m6       11   776.471    497   776.563  +0.092    663   776.953 +0.482<br>d7       12   847.059    542   846.875  -0.184    723   847.266 +0.207<br>M6       13   917.647    588*  918.750  +1.103    784*  918.750 +1.103<br>m7       14   988.235    633   989.063  +0.827    844   989.063 +0.827<br>A6       15  1058.824    678  1059.375  +0.551    904  1059.375 +0.551<br>M7       16  1129.412    723  1129.688  +0.276    964  1129.688 +0.276<br>8        17  1200.000    768  1200.000   0.000   1024  1200.000  0.000        <br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>For both 768-tet and 1024-tet devices, an asterisk (*) indicates that<br>the last scale step has an extra tuning unit: 46 units (71.875 cents)<br>in 768-tet, and 61 units (71.484 cents) in 1024-tet.<br><br>Adding what might be called an "intercalary" tuning unit every six<br>steps in 768-tet or four steps in 1024-tet (rather like a leap year)<br>gives a close approximation of 17-tet.[3] However, this simple pattern<br>does cause some intervals to vary from their ideal size by more than<br>half of a tuning unit.

Conclusion<br>-------------<br><br>The method of nano-temperament seems useful in a range of musical<br>contexts, for example in approximating various shades of meantone.<br>Since a meantone major third is derived from four fifths, it is<br>possible by varying the size of _some_ of these fifths by one tuning<br>unit to achieve shades of _average_ temperament only 1/4 tuning unit<br>apart. The major thirds will vary by an amount four times this size: a<br>single tuning unit.<br><br>In many ways, nano-temperament presents a kinder and gentler version<br>of usual tuning dilemmas: some intervals are might slightly less pure<br>in order to avoid larger discrepancies or inconsistencies. As the use<br>of synthesizers for historical and new scales and temperaments becomes<br>more common, this technique invites further exploration.<br><br><br>                       ---------------------<br>                               Notes<br>                       ---------------------<br><br>1. Easley Blackwood, _The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_<br>(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985), pp. 202-203. Blackwood<br>sets "the largest permissible fifth" for music where thirds are stable<br>intervals at about 701.5 cents.<br><br>2. Pythagorean tuning enthusiasts may take note that a 17-tet step of<br>70.588 cents is not far from three Pythagorean commas of around 23.46<br>cents, or 70.38 cents. As it happens, both 768-tet and 1024-tet give<br>an excellent approximation of this comma with 15 and 20 tuning units<br>respectively, either yielding 23.4375 cents.<br><br>3. This "intercalary" metaphor is much indebted to Guido d'Arezzo, who<br>compares an octave to a week: "Just as when seven days have elapsed we<br>repeat the same ones, so that we always name the first and eighth days<br>the same; so we always represent and name the first and eighth notes<br>the same way..." See Guido's _Micrologus_ (c. 1030?), translated in<br>Warren Badd, tr., Claude V. Palisca, ed., _Hucbald, Guido, and John on<br>Music: Three Medieval Treatises_ (Yale University Press: New Haven,<br>1978), at p. 61. Guido's metaphor has a special appeal because the<br>term "octave" is indeed used in the liturgical calendar to signify the<br>interval of a week. Given the complexities of calendar reform,<br>possibly comparing an interval tuned slighter wider (or narrower) than<br>the closest approximation on a digital device to a "leap year" is not<br>so inapposite.<br><br>Margo Schulter<br>mschulter@value.net<br>22 July 1998</div>
