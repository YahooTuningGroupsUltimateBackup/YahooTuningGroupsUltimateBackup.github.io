I gave in and bought my own <br>unit from Media Source- a package from Smart & Friendly with a 2x Sony <br>drive Adaptec SCSI Lite card, and EZCDPro software. I installed the software <br>and it worked perfectly as soon as I rebooted. I proceeded to back up all my <br>floppy software and the contents of my hard drive. I checked the discs, <br>and they all read perfectly (I have used media by TDK, Verbatim and Sony <br>so far). The one spooky thing is that until you close the disk, you get <br>an "error reading disk" message several times before the disk will read. <br>This is because, until the disc is closed, the CD reader checks <br>each track separately and doesn't see the CD as being there until it <br>checks the last track (& other stuff about which I know not).<br>	Then came the real test - recording music. I used my Windat <br>recorder to maked .wav files from some of my old cassettes (I even found <br>a usable recording of my high school band, and I'm 44 years old) and <br>created an archive the CDR. Success! All the files read properly. I <br>created several archives with no problems, and chose the ones I wanted to <br>place on an audio CD. These cuts I placed in a directory on my hard <br>drive. I then fired up EZCDPro and dragged and dropped the .wav file <br>icons into the window. I pressed record, and the machine whirred and <br>clicked away for about an hour(half an hour to do a test record, and half <br>an hour to record at double speed). I now have a perfectly functioning <br>and worthless CD chronicalling my musical development. Who wants to <br>hear my high school band back to back with noise music? <br>	I have since made a couple of collections of favorite cuts for my <br>wife and have experienced no problems. I am currently preparing the .wav <br>files from last year's Microstock festival, and should have CDs ready in <br>a couple of weeks.<br><br>	As to Brian M's concerns with the state of the art, I am in no <br>position to rebut his quoted experts as my personal sample size is too <br>small, but I believe he is being overly pessimistic. I can quote other <br>experts (no less expert than his) who will give a higher success rate for <br>CDR audio recordings. (If you want the quotes and sources, ask me and <br>I'll be glad to post them). <br>	Although CDR technology is not perfect (which one is?) it is <br>constantly being improved, and who cares if you burn a bad CD? Drop the <br>$7.00 and burn another one!! The point I am trying to make is that I can <br>now make my own CDs for an investment of $617.00 and $7.00 per disk. When <br>I send my music to a radio station they can play it on the air with no <br>hassle. When I give a CD to a friend, it won't jam in the cassette player <br>and wrap arount the spindle.<br>	Check out my web site at http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/ <br>for .wav file excerpts from Microstock 1.
