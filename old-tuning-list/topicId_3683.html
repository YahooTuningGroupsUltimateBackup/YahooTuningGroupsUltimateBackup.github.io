That seems to be<br>extremely unlikely at best, for two reasons.  First, "clarino" as I<br>understand it, and as the New Harvard dictionary seems to confirm, refers<br>to performance on a natural trumpet in the clarino (i.e., high) register.<br>That's the sort of playing we're familiar with, for example, in the Bach<br>Orchestral Suites, or the Brandenburg Concerti.<br><br>   But this almost certainly can't be played in the clarino register of a<br>trumpet;  it's much too low in pitch for that:  many notes go down in the<br>3rd- or 4th-harmonic range.  You'd probably have to go down to the<br>tenor-trombone range of fundamental before that would be possible.  And<br>even if you did attempt it on a tenor-trombone range fundamental, it would<br>almost certainly be too chromatic for that.<br><br>   Such a thing would be possible on a natural horn, partly because they're<br>playing higher harmonics, being that they're on an F fundamental, but more<br>importantly because they can adjust the pitch by cramming their right hand<br>in and out of the bell.<br><br>   The other reason why "Clarino in Eb" is highly unlikely at best, is that<br>in the liner notes to Christopher Hogwood's performance of this concerto,<br>he pointed out that Haydn wrote it for, essentially, a keyed bugle rather<br>than a natural trumpet.<br><br>   That's an interesting recording, by the way;  I recommend it.  Probably<br>the one of the more interesting things about it is the trumpeter had to<br>tongue each note;  possibly because slurs don't come out very well on a<br>keyed bugle;  I don't know.<br><br>   My guess would be that the editor, A. Goeyens, saw the part written for<br>Eb transposition, and assumed that it was a natural trumpet part, since<br>that's how natural brass parts are written (for use with an Eb crook).<br><br>   Anybody have any guesses on that?
