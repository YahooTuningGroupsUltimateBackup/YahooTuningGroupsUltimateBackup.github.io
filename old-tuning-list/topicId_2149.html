That Lucy's 1989 code is similar to Alves' demonstrates only the<br>obviousness of the procedure; the tenor of Lucy's recent letter to Alves<br>suggests that the notational similarity is, however, deceptive, in that the<br>two gentlemen are listening to very different aspects of scales, that Lucy<br>does not understand this, and thus the resemblance is ultimately<br>superficial.<br><br>I also beg to differ with Lucy's claim to priority for this code. It is<br>implicit in the work of Bosanquet and Yasser, and Erv Wilson taught me (and<br>perhaps Bill as well) in the mid seventies to design scales by using a MOS<br>notation which was vitually identical, including auxillary tones via<br>substitutions in the chain of generating intervals. Although I have dateddocuments from this study, Wilson was clear-headed enough to always insist<br>that such methods were obvious consequences of existing music theory and a<br>modest bit of set theory and I believe he would find expending much effort<br>into such a priority claim to be silly.  In addition, a close look at pitch<br>class theory will reveal work that is largely homologous with this, if<br>notated differently and towards different ends.<br><br>And that brings us to the crux of the matter: a code like this is nothingspecial in itself and certainly not worth arguing over priority claims.<br>There are an infinite number of alternative codings for the same<br>information, but the conceptual basis for the particular assemblage of<br>information chosen to be encoded is the critical point. On this basis, I<br>would assign priority here to Yasser.

The fact is, however, from an elementary<br>mathematical viewpoint, the lattice was already described in complete form<br>by alternative but non-graphic means elsewhere in the music theoretical<br>literature.
