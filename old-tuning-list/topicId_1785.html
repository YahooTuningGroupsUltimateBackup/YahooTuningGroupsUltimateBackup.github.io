Churn is too strong a <br>> word. What I can say is that after pianists that I work with have <br>> become acquainted with the difference in temperament for Beethoven,   <br>> they all prefer something other than ET.<br><br>I'm afraid that this, and much else that you've said, goes no further <br>than to say that well-temperament was a possibility for this music. But <br>I never argued with this. What I was asking you to do, rather, was to <br>back up your categorical statement that equal temperament was _not_ used <br>at all (as a keyboard tuning) in Germany/Austria c.1800. I suspect by <br>now that you said all you can on this matter, and I thank you for this. <br><br>My concern is simply that there is not so far any case which would <br>withstand scrutiny as an academic paper; since your interests are <br>practical rather than academic, you may not be worried by this. But it <br>will prove a difficult task, since at present revisionists such as <br>Rudolf Rasch, are (as Manuel Op de Coul reminded us) prepared even to <br>say that Bach might indeed have intended the WTK for equal temperament, <br>notwithstanding all that has been argued to the contrary. If respected <br>academics are still prepared to place ET (as a keyboard tuning) back <br>even as far as the 1720s, there is a great deal to be done before we can <br>hope to establish the counter-thesis that ET didn't begin to emerge as a <br>practical possibility (for keyboards) until at least a century later. <br>Whatever the merits of Rasch's case, there is a very long way to go <br>before the historical case for the prevalence of well-temperament into <br>the 19th century has been established. There are two routes by which we <br>can attack the consensual thesis that ET was well-nigh universal in <br>Germany/Austria by 1800: one is to provide convincing documentary <br>evidence to the contrary from contemporary sources (I've still seen <br>nothing in this respect); the other is to shift the burden of proof onto <br>those following the consensual thesis, by demonstrating that ET was so <br>far beyond the capabilities of 18th-century tuners that its supposed <br>establishment by 1800 is most improbable (you have said a couple of <br>things which move in this direction). Does anyone know of more material, <br>or can anyone suggest further arguments which would contribute to either <br>of these possible lines of attack? <br><br>> >Was Chopin (advocate of ET, as I've said before) less than<br>> >a true musician?<br>>       No, but Chopin was not composing music in the time of Mozart and<br>> Beethoven, I assume he cut his teeth on a lot less meantone than <br>> Beethoven, or Mozart.<br><br>Meantone? Yes, probably 1/6-comma from good string players, and on some <br>keyboards (it was Silbermann's choice), but I thought we were talking <br>about well temperament. Was this a typo?<br><br>In any case, would you agree then that for music which modulates freely, <br>but which remains locally diatonic in most passages (as in Beethoven), <br>well-temperaments are best, but where local chromaticism becomes more <br>prevalent (as in later Chopin), then equal temperament is more <br>satisfactory?<br><br>> (For a real treat, listen to his Opus 28 <br>> preludes performed on a DeMorgan temperament. It is a very different <br>> music indeed,  and it could have happened!)<br><br>Definitely a typo here (op. 39 Preludes "durch alle Tonarten"). The date <br>of composition is thought to have been 1789 -- certainly a later Bonn <br>work -- so the opus number, 39, is misleading in this respect. In this <br>case, even if (contrary to your view) ET was prevalent by 1800, there is <br>still a fairly high probability that in relatively provincial Bonn, well <br>temperament would still have been much in evidence at this date. Tuning <br>matters aside, I find it particularly interesting that the two preludes <br>traverse the circuit of keys in different ways: the first reaches C# <br>major by fifths, then manages to reverse all of this and more in a <br>wonderful chromatic passage to arrive on a genuine Db major (genuine in <br>the sense that it is not just a notational convenience), whereupon the <br>fifths sequence resumes until the final (genuine) C major is reached. <br>The second prelude, maintains the fifths sequence throughout, and passes <br>through the cycle twice, so removing changes due to notational <br>convenience, we pass from C major to A*# major. The first prelude even <br>manages to maintain a high level of inventiveness, and deserves to be <br>heard more often on the concert platform.<br><br>-- <br>Jonathan Walker<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 10 Mar 1997 18:30 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA00736; Mon, 10 Mar 1997 18:30:40 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00734<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id JAA29173; Mon, 10 Mar 1997 09:27:24 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 10 Mar 1997 09:27:24 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703101726.AA06357@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Was: Octo-tonal composing?
