Properly speaking, the Mathews/<br>Roberts studies on "pure" and "rich" listeners belong<br>to the subset of studies on music aesthetics.  Such studies are<br>seldom done nowadays because they are fraught with peril:<br>as John Chalmers points out, it's unclear whether a test of<br>interval preference indicates (A) cultural brainwashing<br>or (B) innate proclivity for this or that tuning.  This applies<br>to aesthetic "preference" studies of Asian, African, South<br>American tunings as well as to "preference" studies of<br>western 12-TET intervals.<br>I have seldom cited such aesthetic research because of<br>the potential problems.  In particular, Carol Krumhansl's<br>studies seem to be deeply flawed because of their<br>inherently aesthetic bent--Krumhansl talks about "western<br>tonal hierarchies," but it's not clear whether her data are<br>produced  brainwashing among the test subjects or <br>some innate supracultural tendency.  (Krumhansl's attempts<br>to address this issue raise more problems than they solve,<br>inasmuch as it's clear that Krumhansl actually believes that<br>Indian musicians use *exactly the same pitches* as the white<br>notes of a Western piano.  Put on *your* CD of Indian music,<br>and see if *you agree.*) Much of the bias could even be<br>generated by Krumhansl's test structure.  I'd like to see<br>Krumhansl's probe-tone tests repeated for high-limit JI<br>scales and exotic high-limit probe tones.<br>My guess is that the results would be *radically* different. <br>By contrast, the studies I have cited are *not* concerned with<br>preference.  I have not talked about "preference" since<br>tuning digest 28 (& if the word crept into my posts, it's the result <br>of my falling into bad habits--in any case I've endeavoured<br>strictly to avoid such prejudicial and inaccurate language).<br>Most psychoacoustic studies do not seek to uncover<br>"preferences."  Modern psychoacoustic studies are concerned,<br>rather, to compare what the *listener perceives* with<br>what the *instruments measure.*<br>To say (as Mathews and Roberts do in one single isolated<br>study) that some listeners prefer triads tuned with plenty<br>of beats while other listeners prefer triads tuned as<br>beatless as possible...well, that's one thing.<br>But to say, as 99.99999+% of modern psychoacoustic research<br>does, that listeners predominantly perceive the p5 interval<br>as "pure" when it is sharp of the just value by an average<br>of 5-7 cents for the "perceived" 3/2...<br>That's something *entirely* different.<br>Such studies make no claims about preferences.  <br>These studies do *not* say "such-and-such a tuning is<br>a true fifth," or "such and such a fifth sounds better<br>than another `fifth'."   They don't even say "such-and-such<br>interval is preferred by listeners."<br>That's a complete misunderstanding of the psychocaoustic<br>research.<br>Instead, what these studies say is that there is a significant<br>persistent  universal difference between classes of *perceived* <br>intervals and classes of *acoustically measured* intervals.<br>Such results have *nothing* to do with preferences.  <br>When Johan Sundberg points out that "it is important not<br>to confuse with the *perceptual* octave with the *acoustical*<br>octave," this is NOT a statement that the 2:1 is "better"<br>or "worse" than the 1215-cent octave.
