One is roughness, which has <br>a negative effect on perceived consonance. This is a phenomenon that occurs <br>when two or more partials are closer in pitch than the critical bandwidth. <br>Beating is a companion phenomenon to roughness, but the rate of beating is <br>not a good measure of the amount of roughness. A constant level of roughness <br>will imply higher rates of beating as the pitch of the stimulus increases. <br>In many studies with tones with inharmonic spectra, roughness is far and <br>away the more important determinant of consonance/dissonance judgments.<br><br>The other component is tonalness, which is positively related to perceived <br>consonance. It is the degree to which all the partials approximate a single <br>harmonic series. As has been discussed, the origin of this sensation is <br>complex and includes the phenomena of virtual pitch (which replaces a bunch <br>of partials with a best-fit fundamental and a timbre), combination tones <br>(artifacts of nonlinear distortion in our ears or in the sound-creating <br>mechanism), virtual pitch of combination tones and roughness of combination <br>tones. The relative importance of this component is clearly not a constant <br>but dependent on pitch level, volume level, etc.<br><br>Gary Morrison's observations make some sense when these two components are <br>viewed individually. Here's another example which I find musically useful <br>and clears up some of the misconceptions about "undertones."<br><br>In my favorite tuning of 22-tET, a dominant ninth chord might be tuned 0 4 7 <br>13 18 22 26. This approximates the just chord 8:9:10:12:14:16:18. Play this <br>chord in a moderately low register, and use a harmonic timbre. Now try <br>another dominant ninth chord, tuned 0 4 8 13 19 22 26. This approximates <br>what Harry Partch would call a "utonal" chord, with frequencies <br>1/18:1/16:1/14:1/12:1/10:1/9:1/8. Play this in the same register, and with <br>the same timbre, as the first chord. Which is more consonant? In one sense, <br>the first chord is more consonant; play it real loud (or with distortion) <br>and there will be no question. All the partials are within a single harmonic <br>series, plus or minus nine cents. But there is another, quite audible, sense <br>in which the second chord is ever-so-slightly more consonant. Observe that <br>the two chords contain exactly the same intervals. The difference is that <br>the smallest and most out-of-tune interval, 3/22 oct. (approximating a <br>10/9), is in a higher register in the second chord. This interval <br>contributes quite a lot of roughness to the chord, but the critical <br>bandwidth is wider in low registers, so putting the interval in a lower <br>register creates more roughness. This fact should be familiar to students of <br>orchestration.<br><br>The second chord, though consonant in a certain sense, does not conform to a <br>harmonic series. The simplest integral representation of this chord is <br>280:315:360:420:504:560:630. This is far beyond the range understood by our <br>virtual-pitch mechanism, as it corresponds to notes in the 8th-9th octave of <br>the harmonic series. There is no need to invoke an undertone series to <br>explain this chord, though; as we have seen, all the intervals here are <br>fairly simple and the roughest interval is in a high register. But if the <br>chord has nothing to do with a harmonic series, does that make it atonal?<br><br>Well, the determinant of the perceived root of a chord, other than the <br>lowest note in a particular voicing, is the virtual pitch sensation. It <br>operates perfectly well in the presence of distracting stimuli. Since the <br>simplest harmonics are usually the loudest, it is not surprising simple <br>ratios will be the most important for the virtual pitch phenomenon. Remember <br>that powers of 2 are octave-equivalent to the virtual pitch. A 3/2 (perfect <br>fifth) above the lowest note will greatly enhance the perception of the <br>lowest note as the root, while a 4/3 (perfect fourth) will destroy it. In <br>the absence of a perfect fifth, a 5/4 (major third) will enhance, and an 8/5 <br>(minor sixth) will destroy, the rootedness of a chord.<br><br>However, in this case we don't need to go that far, since both chords have a <br>3/2 above, and no 4/3 above, the lowest note. Therefore, the root of both <br>chords is well-defined, though it is certainly better-defined in the first <br>chord. To wit: if the lowest note, and the note a 2/1 (octave) higher, is <br>removed from both chords, the perceived root of the first chord remains the <br>now-missing note, while that of the second chord becomes quite ambiguous. <br>Transposing the note designated as 13/22 oct. or 1/12 (formerly 3/2 above <br>the lowest note) down a 2/1 makes it into the new root, since a 3/2 above it <br>occurs at the note 4/22 oct. or 1/16. Thus it is not atonal in that it has a <br>clear root, although it has at least one other potential root that can be <br>expressed through omission and octave-shifting.<br><br>To my ears, this second chord can be as useful to 9-limit harmony as the <br>minor triad is to 7-limit harmony, though more care may be required in <br>voicing, tuning, and orchestrating it. The complexity of its integral <br>representation signals that any combination tones will serve to turn this <br>chord into mush. But consonant it is, in a certain sense.<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 11 Sep 1996 07:27 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13081; Wed, 11 Sep 1996 07:29:28 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA12775<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id WAA28860; Tue, 10 Sep 1996 22:29:26 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 10 Sep 1996 22:29:26 -0700<br>Message-Id: <v01540b17ae5bfcab2c72@[131.172.160.53]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3600 href="#3600">ðŸ”—</a>jpff@maths.bath.ac.uk</h3><span>9/12/1996 6:27:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>For some reason or other I was interested in the idea of writing<br>another 60sec piece, so I attempted to obtain the sound file.
