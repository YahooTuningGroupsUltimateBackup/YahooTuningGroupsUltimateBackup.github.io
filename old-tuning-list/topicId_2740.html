Fokker's method is as I have stated. Read the references for<br>yourself. If you do not have access to Fokker's original texts, use<br>Mandelbaum.<br><br>2. Fokker could have used _no_ method to achieve equal weighting of<br>deviations of the consonances. The most _basic_ principle of<br>temperament, which is taught to all _beginners_ in this discipline, is<br>that there can be _no_ temperament which compromises the consonances<br>equally. This arises from the mathematics of the case. _Learn_<br>mathematics before you make such statements, which again, only show your<br>ignorance.<br><br>Now that I have administered the bitter pill, let me add a large<br>tablespoon of sugar. You are quite bright. You were led into this faulty<br>conclusion by assuming that the consonances are independent, and so,<br>vary independently when tempered. I use non-mathematical language here<br>deliberately. But in fact the consonances consist of three pairs, 5:4 &<br>8:5, 6:5 & 5:3, and 3:2 & 4:3, each of which pair varies as if it were a<br>single interval, so far as temperaments are concerned. Therefore, to<br>seek some system which shall weight deviations from the consonances<br>equally, even in the case in which the octave is itself tempered, is the<br>classic pons asinorum of temperament, for no such system can exist. Were<br>however, you to confine yourself to the narrower (but unfortunately,<br>perfectly irrelevant) objective of finding a tempered octave which<br>should deteriorate both of the members of each _pair_ of the consonances<br>equally, either from just or from their 19-tone equal values,<br>independent of the other two pairs, then, and then only, would your<br>objection be valid.<br><br>I advise you to study the cycle of 22-tone equal consonant fifths. See<br>if you can find a consonant third, four fifths above the tonic. If you<br>cannot (and you cannot) your arguments fall to the ground. I repeat that<br>when I was a beginner, I made the same mistake you are making.<br><br>Your assertion that the chromatic modes of 19-tone equal are just as<br>well expressible in 12-tone equal, could never be made by anyone who has<br>heard them, and extensively used them in music with any harmonic<br>element. Even in melody, and even insofar as the diatonic modes are<br>concerned, the 12-tone equal modes so deviate from the tonal fabric of<br>just intonation that they are very evidently deteriorated. But in the<br>chromatic modes, where the augmented tone is so much used, the<br>difference is enormous.<br><br>Finally, let me observe that the value of 1202.7 cents for the octave,<br>while apparently very precise, and possibly indicative that one person<br>may have copied the other without acknowledgement, actually follows from<br>the decision to round the 19-tone equal tuning degree, 63.16 cents,<br>upward by the nearest tenth of a cent. 63.2 cents gives an octave of<br>63.2 x 19 = 1200.8 cents. 63.3 cents gives an octave of 63.3 x 19 =<br>1202.7 cents. 63.4 cents gives an octave of 1204.6 cents. Back in the<br>early 90's I settled on the value of 63.3 cents as the value which seems<br>best when taken to the nearest tenth of a cent. Almost anyone who<br>thought of tempering the 19-tone octave would be led to 1202.7 cents as<br>the most eligible of the three values. I repeat that I have no interest<br>in disputing priority of this discovery. The true credit, insofar as it<br>belongs to anyone, belongs partly to Fokker, who to my knowledge at<br>least, first suggested tempering the octave with the purpose of<br>improving the other consonances. He therefore put the germ of this idea<br>in my own mind, and it is my habit to make occasional reference to this<br>as a kind of tribute. This is a very important discovery, for by it the<br>19-tone equal becomes virtually as smooth harmonically as the 31-tone<br>equal.<br><br>I bear you _no_ personal ill will. I myself _do_ sometimes make bad,<br>terribly embarassing mistakes. We all do. The best defense against<br>despising ourselves is to adopt an elaborately civil tone in all public<br>discourse.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Mandelbaum's Use of 31-tone Equal<br>PostedDate:  20-12-97 05:51:47<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  20-12-97 05:49:45-20-12-97 05:49:45,20-12-97 05:49:20-20-12-97 05:49:21<br>DeliveredDate:  20-12-97 05:49:21<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256573.001A82DE; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 05:51:30 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22468; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 05:51:47 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 20 Dec 1997 05:51:47 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22436<br>Received: (qmail 12002 invoked from network); 19 Dec 1997 20:51:44 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 19 Dec 1997 20:51:44 -0800<br>Message-Id: <349BB0D2.4BDC@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>to G.

Fokker's method is as I have stated. Read the references for<br>yourself. If you do not have access to Fokker's original texts, use<br>Mandelbaum.<br><br>2. Fokker could have used _no_ method to achieve equal weighting of<br>deviations of the consonances. The most _basic_ principle of<br>temperament, which is taught to all _beginners_ in this discipline, is<br>that there can be _no_ temperament which compromises the consonances<br>equally. This arises from the mathematics of the case. _Learn_<br>mathematics before you make such statements, which again, only show your<br>ignorance.<br><br>Now that I have administered the bitter pill, let me add a large<br>tablespoon of sugar. You are quite bright. You were led into this faulty<br>conclusion by assuming that the consonances are independent, and so,<br>vary independently when tempered. I use non-mathematical language here<br>deliberately. But in fact the consonances consist of three pairs, 5:4 &<br>8:5, 6:5 & 5:3, and 3:2 & 4:3, each of which pair varies as if it were a<br>single interval, so far as temperaments are concerned. Therefore, to<br>seek some system which shall weight deviations from the consonances<br>equally, even in the case in which the octave is itself tempered, is the<br>classic pons asinorum of temperament, for no such system can exist. Were<br>however, you to confine yourself to the narrower (but unfortunately,<br>perfectly irrelevant) objective of finding a tempered octave which<br>should deteriorate both of the members of each _pair_ of the consonances<br>equally, either from just or from their 19-tone equal values,<br>independent of the other two pairs, then, and then only, would your<br>objection be valid.<br><br>I advise you to study the cycle of 22-tone equal consonant fifths. See<br>if you can find a consonant third, four fifths above the tonic. If you<br>cannot (and you cannot) your arguments fall to the ground. I repeat that<br>when I was a beginner, I made the same mistake you are making.<br><br>Your assertion that the chromatic modes of 19-tone equal are just as<br>well expressible in 12-tone equal, could never be made by anyone who has<br>heard them, and extensively used them in music with any harmonic<br>element. Even in melody, and even insofar as the diatonic modes are<br>concerned, the 12-tone equal modes so deviate from the tonal fabric of<br>just intonation that they are very evidently deteriorated. But in the<br>chromatic modes, where the augmented tone is so much used, the<br>difference is enormous.<br><br>Finally, let me observe that the value of 1202.7 cents for the octave,<br>while apparently very precise, and possibly indicative that one person<br>may have copied the other without acknowledgement, actually follows from<br>the decision to round the 19-tone equal tuning degree, 63.16 cents,<br>upward by the nearest tenth of a cent. 63.2 cents gives an octave of<br>63.2 x 19 = 1200.8 cents. 63.3 cents gives an octave of 63.3 x 19 =<br>1202.7 cents. 63.4 cents gives an octave of 1204.6 cents. Back in the<br>early 90's I settled on the value of 63.3 cents as the value which seems<br>best when taken to the nearest tenth of a cent. Almost anyone who<br>thought of tempering the 19-tone octave would be led to 1202.7 cents as<br>the most eligible of the three values. I repeat that I have no interest<br>in disputing priority of this discovery. The true credit, insofar as it<br>belongs to anyone, belongs partly to Fokker, who to my knowledge at<br>least, first suggested tempering the octave with the purpose of<br>improving the other consonances. He therefore put the germ of this idea<br>in my own mind, and it is my habit to make occasional reference to this<br>as a kind of tribute. This is a very important discovery, for by it the<br>19-tone equal becomes virtually as smooth harmonically as the 31-tone<br>equal.<br><br>I bear you _no_ personal ill will. I myself _do_ sometimes make bad,<br>terribly embarassing mistakes. We all do. The best defense against<br>despising ourselves is to adopt an elaborately civil tone in all public<br>discourse.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Mandelbaum's Use of 31-tone Equal<br>PostedDate:  20-12-97 05:51:47<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  20-12-97 05:49:45-20-12-97 05:49:45,20-12-97 05:49:20-20-12-97 05:49:21<br>DeliveredDate:  20-12-97 05:49:21<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256573.001A82DE; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 05:51:30 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22468; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 05:51:47 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 20 Dec 1997 05:51:47 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22436<br>Received: (qmail 12002 invoked from network); 19 Dec 1997 20:51:44 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 19 Dec 1997 20:51:44 -0800<br>Message-Id: <349BB0D2.4BDC@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
