The harmonic series is a construct of our mathematical <br>> minds, modeling a phenomenon first observed with our nonlinear hearing <br>> mechanism, and later with lab instruments. <br><br>   I personally think that that, although essentially correct, is a bit of<br>an exaggeration.  <br><br>   First of all, a topic that made its rounds on the list recently:  To say<br>that (for example) guitars, orchestral strings, almost all woodwind tones,<br>and most brass tones, have exactly harmonic partials, is only slight<br>oversimplification.  The biggest departures from harmonic partials are<br>high- and mid-frequency noise components, from rosiny scrapes or breath<br>blowing through the tube.  <br><br>   If you force partials from those sorts of instruments to exact<br>harmonics, they take on a very clearly audible, but usually fairly subtle,<br>"robotic" crustiness.  To say that most orchestral instruments have exactly<br>harmonic partials is definitely not pure 100% unadulterated truth, but the<br>amount those instruments deviate from pure harmonic partials is FAR too<br>small to have any significant effect upon tuning considerations.  <br><br>   But that's not really a point I want to get too much into, and perhaps<br>it wasn't really John's main issue either.  <br><br>   I think it's worth pointing out that whatever framework you build your<br>compositional or psychoacoustical model of musical psychology upon, how you<br>defy that framework is every bit as important as how you use it.  <br><br>   I personally believe that Neil is mostly correct in at least one sense: <br>Aside from some very important exceptions (e.g., very low pitch range),<br>simple whole-number ratios usually predict quite accurately what our ears<br>view as significant.  They are the navigational bouys in the sea of tuning<br>possibilities.  <br><br>   BUuuuut...  I don't believe that pitch relationship being significant to<br>our ears means that we must ideally use it, any more than we should sail<br>into collision course with navigation bouys!  For example, intentionally<br>missing a 3:2 P5 by about 5 cents produces quarter-comma meantone, which to<br>my ears and those of many others, sounds really fantastic!  And it sounds<br>great not (only) because it hits a 5:4 right on, but even more so because<br>of the specific way that it misses 3:2.  <br><br>   Obeying well-known ground rules sows the seeds of expectation in your<br>audience's minds, but defying those rules is what makes your audience<br>listen!  Really brilliant music comes from cleverly and emotionally using<br>both expectation and defiance of expectation.  Simple whole-number ratios,<br>being a pretty good model of what is fundamentally meaningful to our ears,<br>are one example of such a means of using and defying expectation.  Regular<br>structures in a tuning system (like circles of fifths) are another, as are<br>consistency of meter and rhythm.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 11 Feb 1997 05:24 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01951; Tue, 11 Feb 1997 05:24:06 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01949<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id UAA20393; Mon, 10 Feb 1997 20:22:29 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 10 Feb 1997 20:22:29 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.970210210957.33691A-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4770 href="#4770">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>2/11/1997 6:52:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>         Paul Erlich's email system does not work right, and the MCI mail<br>> sysadmin is completely oblivious to the world.
