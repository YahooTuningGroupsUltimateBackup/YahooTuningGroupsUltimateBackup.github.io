Equal tunings with similar <br>accuracies to 19 and 34, but which represent the harmonic series <br>consistently through the 11th harmonic, are 22 and 31, respectively.<br><br>I assume that, not being a Harry Partch fan, you don't get anything out of <br>ratios of 7, 9, and 11. That's fine. Maybe your model for tuning is the <br>harmonic series only through the 5th harmonic (plus octave equivalence). <br>That's fine too. Someone else's model may be the diatonic scale with no <br>commas and smooth 5-limit triads, they would choose 19- or 31- or 50-tET. <br>Someone else might like 5-limit triads and huge commas; 15-equal is for <br>them. Someone else might like diatonic scales with thirds tuned 7:6 and 9:7; <br>they would love 22. (I have other reasons for loving it.) Another person <br>might like to combine two different diatonic scales, taking consonant triads <br>from either and consonant 7-limit additions from the other. 26-equal is for <br>them. Someone else might want to strecth as far up the harmonic series as <br>possible; they could go all the way through the 15th harmonic quite <br>accurately with 41.<br><br>Then there are those who don't like equal temperament, or don't like simple <br>ratios (i.e., they like dissonance), or both, or have other specific <br>desiderata. As long as these goals are perceptibly beautiful, and not merely <br>mathematically beautiful, they will gravitate towards some tuning over <br>others. Equal temperament is great for transposition, for "punning," and <br>fretted instruments, but some want no deviation from just ratios, while <br>others want to control these deviations compositionally. I believe that <br>dissonance can be beautiful, but as almost any tuning has plenty of <br>dissonances available, I find it important to find tunings where this <br>dissonance can be contrasted with consonance.
