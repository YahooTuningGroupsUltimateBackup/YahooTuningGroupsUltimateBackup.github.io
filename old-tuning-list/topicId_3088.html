I don't have a CD<br>Recorder myself and have no idea how much this would cost or how many audio<br>mastering studios support it.  This could also eat into our allotted track<br>times if we try to store bit map graphic files of a few scores or a lot of<br>photos.<br><br>John Loffink<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Andrew L.

If there is a little room left over<br>>on the<br>>tuning forum CD, it would be cool to include scores, photos, bio<br>>material, etc. Does anyone here have experience creating mixed media<br>>CDs?<br>><br>>John Starrett<br>><br><br>John, the type of CD your talking about is called a "mixed mode" CD or<br>"CD-ROM/XA". Putting graphic files, text and even MPEG-1 video is easily<br>done. Any current CD authoring software and burner should be able to<br>accomplish this task. The big deal about the XA format is that it writes<br>the data track after the audio tracks, otherwise you would put the CD in<br>an audio CD player and the first track would be computer noise that can<br>damage audio equipment..<br><br>I mastered CD's for 10 years at a large duplication house. Though I don't<br>master CD's anymore, I still work for a duplication house and could get<br>your CD's done for cost, or at least I will try, I have been discussing<br>this with Neil off the tuning list.<br><br>Also, keep in mind that a 74 min. CD can hold approx. 650 megs of data.<br>It is my personal experience that a CD that is filled to the outer rim<br>can have some playback problems on some drives.<br><br>John Menich<br>Failsafe Media Company<br><br>_____________________________________________________________________<br>You don't need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at http://www.juno.com<br>Or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed) <br>Subject:  Decatonic tuning and 7-limit lattices<br>PostedDate:  02-02-98 19:28:15<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  02-02-98 19:27:17-02-02-98 19:27:18,02-02-98 19:25:57-02-02-98 19:25:58<br>DeliveredDate:  02-02-98 19:25:58<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125659F.00655CAB; Mon, 2 Feb 1998 19:27:08 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05800; Mon, 2 Feb 1998 19:28:15 +0100<br>Date: Mon, 2 Feb 1998 19:28:15 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05801<br>Received: (qmail 14035 invoked from network); 2 Feb 1998 10:27:27 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 2 Feb 1998 10:27:27 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.875957@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
