Some <br>corrections....<br><br>1.  There is no such thing as a Kurzweil K3000.  You must be referring to <br>the K2500.<br>2.  It is very simple to do octave shifts of instruments.  Multiple pitch <br>tables are not necessary to do more than 17 notes per octave for a piano <br>range instrument.  If you need instruments with 250 discrete pitches, <br>assuming that they repeat by octaves, you can create the pitch table once, <br>copy the instrument and then merely shift the pitch by octaves to create <br>the full scale pitch range.  This is not possible with the Ensoniq series <br>of samplers however (see next item).<br>3.  The author seems to be mistaking the architecture of the Ensoniq series <br>with other manufacturers instruments as well.  The Ensoniq samplers cannot <br>store the program parameters (tunings, filter settings, etc.) separate from <br>the sample RAM.  This is one of the great weaknesses of the ASR-10.  The <br>other is the limitation of loading 8 instruments.  Kurzweil and I believe <br>E-mu and Akai can and do allow multiple program settings using a common set <br>of samples.  So all these calculations starting with a 32M sample bank and <br>then multiplying it by X times are wrong except for those using an Ensoniq. <br> To do the octave shifts one merely needs to copy a few hundred bytes of <br>program RAM and readjust the relevent parameter.<br>4.  The assumption is made that tuning tables are the only means of <br>creating a non-12 note scale on instruments without full scale tuning <br>tables.  This is correct only when talking about non-equally spaced scales. <br> For equal tempered scales on the Kurzweil K2000 and K2500, it is very easy <br>to adjust the keymap tracking parameter to a rough value so that the <br>individual samples track the pitch range they were intended for.  One then <br>adjusts one of the two available pitch modulation sources to fine tune the <br>pitch tracking to get a tuning accurate to +-1 cent over the entire MIDI <br>range.  Since the Kurzweil gives the pitch tracking modulation depth in <br>real units of cents, it is very easy to calculate the proper values for any <br>equal tempered scale, including non-octave repeating scales such as the <br>Carlos alpha, beta and gamma scales.  I recently gave an example of this to <br>a tuning list member for 19TET and I believe he forwarded those parameters <br>to this list.  On the Kurzweil instruments this is stored as a program <br>parameter in program RAM, not in sample RAM.  The K2000 and K2500 are <br>limited to 999 programs per instrument.  I believe this to be an adequate <br>number for most users even though you would have to use  separate programs <br>for the same sample set in 19TET and 31TET scales (but again, no extra <br>sample RAM).  Any one of these 999 programs are instantly available by a <br>MIDI extended program change message.  Multiple ET scales could even be <br>mixed within the same composition and sequence.  It takes a few minutes to <br>calculate the parameters for a new ET scale and about 30 seconds to program <br>each instrument.<br>5.  The K2500 and Emu EIV both allow 128M of sample memory.  The lowest <br>cost Kurzweil option is to get a K2500R (Rack) without the sampling option <br>for about $2500.  You don't need the sampling option to use samples, only <br>to do your own sampling from microphone, line or digital inputs!  The SIMM <br>slots and SCSI interface are on the basic unit.  30 pin 16Mx8 RAM is <br>currently running $95-$120, so the full 128Mbyte cost is less than $1000.   <br>Of course, the assumption that you need this much is entirely wrong.  Add <br>64M RAM, the Program RAM option, a SCSI CD-ROM drive, a 1 or 2 Gig hard <br>drive and several sample CD-ROMs and the total price ticket is $4000-$4500. <br> Yes, this is expensive, no doubt about it, but it is also one hellaciously <br>powerful system.<br>6. Software updates do occur, especially for the more expensive instruments,<br> so the situation is not entirely hopeless.  I urge everyone to contact the <br>manufacturers and request microtonal tuning capabilities.  Make sure they <br>know that your purchase decision is dependent upon this feature.  I am <br>personally working with Kurzweil on these matters and would love for other <br>manufacturers to be responsive as well.  One problem is that there is no <br>consensus as to what microtonal users want.  One user may want only a few <br>full keyboard tuning scales while another may want dozens of octave based <br>scales that can be selected on the fly for complex just intonation <br>modulations.  And let's be realistic, no mass market manufacturer will <br>support resolutions to .01 cents or better because the VLSI chips simply <br>aren't that accurate.  Users needing this accuracy will have to rely on <br>specialized systems like KYMA or the Justonics synthesizer.<br>  <br>For Marcus Hobbs:<br>The literate I've seen on the Ensoniq MR Rack says it has only one RAM <br>tuning table location.
