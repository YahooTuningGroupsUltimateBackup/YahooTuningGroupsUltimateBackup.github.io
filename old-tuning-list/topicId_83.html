Surely, they have been hung in size order, but it is wrong <br>to deduce the tuning implications by the mere 12 bell/chimes per octave.<br>Even solid metal loses it exact tuning after 2 thousand years.<br><br><br>Chin music made use of tuning modulations from Just <br>(harmonic-representing heaven), Pythagorean (open strings-representing <br>earth), and Stopped (fingers on the strings now heard in equal <br>temperament-representing people).<br><br>My surmise is that before the Mongol invasions outlawed Han Chinese <br>social theater and music, in effect raping it over hundreds of years, <br>there may have been microtonal activity in the form of multiple notes per <br>octave - past 12.  As a result of the Mongol invasions, pentatonicism as <br>the simplest means would dominate.  There is a Chinese word for a foreign <br>note outside the system.
