Does the Mac version of AOL software provide a web browser<br>(CompuServe's <br>    STILL doesn't, although they're close to providing it)?<br>2.  Does AOL provide any personal web-page space in their $20/month price?<br>3.  Does AOL's (Mac) software allow you to relocate your E-mail inbox in a <br>    different place on your disk hierarchy?  (That is, it presumably has a<br>    default place for putting incoming and outgoing mail, but does it allow<br><br>    you put them elsewhere if you'd prefer?)<br><br>   Please respond to me personally (not to the list) to keep the non-tuning<br>messages down.
