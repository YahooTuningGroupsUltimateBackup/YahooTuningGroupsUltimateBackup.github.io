Is it capable of producing 8192<br>unique values?  Is the figure dependent upon the initial frequency of the<br>note?<br><br>        3)  Would I be correct in assuming that pitch bend messages affect<br>the absolute output frequency in an exponential fashion as in the 12Tet<br>model?  What I mean is, if I played A440 and with a pitch bend value of 256<br>(and pitch bend range was set to 100 cents) would the output frequency in<br>Hertz be equal to 440((2^(1/12))^(256/8192))=440.7949Hz?<br><br><br>        thanks...<br><br>        -andrew<br><br>Safe Journey...<br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 15 Nov 1996 11:02 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11462; Fri, 15 Nov 1996 11:04:08 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11479<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id CAA18012; Fri, 15 Nov 1996 02:03:44 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 15 Nov 1996 02:03:44 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961115100106_71670.2576_HHB42-3@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
