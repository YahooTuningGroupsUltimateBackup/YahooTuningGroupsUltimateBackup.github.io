I have added the<br>following text to my personal webpage:<br><br>*** BEGIN QUOTED-WEBPAGE ***<br>   [The chart at the following URL] contains data on another concept which I call<br>   completeness. An ET is complete at a given harmonic limit if the basic<br>   intervals within that limit form a basis which spans that ET, if you<br>   think of the ET as a space or group. Example: 24TET is incomplete at<br>   the 5-limit because 5/4 is approximated by 8 steps and 3/2 by 14,<br>   which means no matter what combination of 5/4s and 3/2s (or 6/5s) you<br>   use, you can never generate those intervals which contain an odd<br>   number of steps.<br>   <br>   http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote/complete.txt<br>   <br>   So what do the numbers mean? Only those combinations of ET and (odd)<br>   limit have entries which are both consistent and complete. (I stopped,<br>   somwhat arbitrarily, at 300TET.) x/y means that the ET is x-level<br>   consistent at that limit (as in the above charts), and y is the<br>   diameter at which the ET is completed.<br>   <br>   So what, in turn, does diameter mean? If n-ET has diameter y at the<br>   m-limit, that means that there is at least one interval which requires<br>   combining y m-limit (primary) intervals to derive it, but no intervals<br>   which require more. Example: the primary intervals (consonances)<br>   within the 5-limit (the senario) are represented in 12TET by 3, 4, 5,<br>   7, 8, and 9 steps. 1 can be expressed as 4-3 (or 5-4, etc.), 2 by 5-3<br>   etc, and 6 by 3+3. (The derivations of 10 and 11 are analogous to<br>   those of their complements 2 and 1.) That completes the gamut of<br>   12TET, therefore the diameter of 12TET at the 5-limit is 2.<br>   <br>   A contrasting example: in 19TET, combinations of exactly 2 of the<br>   primary 5-limit consonances (5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14) give you all the<br>   rest except for 4 (and its complement 15). 4 does, however, have a<br>   ternary derivation (4=5+5-6), so the diameter of 19TET at the 5-limit<br>   is 3.<br>*** END QUOTED-WEBPAGE ***<br><br>The point, in case it isn't clear, of introducing a parameter like<br>diameter is that it gives us another measure by which we can compare<br>ETs, i.e. an ET with a small diameter will be more "comprehensible" to<br>the ear/mind, whereas an ET with a large diameter will have intervals<br>which are interpreted as more complex and difficult to hear.<br><br>--pH <manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu> http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote<br>    O<br>   /\        "Churchill?
