Homophone puns: In just intonation, where a single tone _has_ two (or<br>more) intonationally exact harmonic senses (vertical function), the<br>individual sense usually articulated in temporal sequence. In Partch's<br>Diamond each pitch may be taken in a minimum of two senses, and in Wilson's<br>Eikosany, a minimum of six senses. In Harrison's _free style_ , the number<br>of potential senses is unlimited.  <br><br>2. Heterophone puns: where a single tone _is taken_ in two (or more)<br>harmonic senses. There are two subtypes: (a) where a pitch has the<br>intonationally exact identity of only one of the senses, and for the other<br>senses is close enough (critical band anyone?) to be understood (tolerated)<br>in the false intonation; and (b) where the pitch has the exact frequency of<br>neither identity, but is understood (tolerated) in both senses. (The later<br>case suggests temperament, but also portmanteau methods - like freshman<br>sums, are useful just analogs to temperament - i.e. in the place of 9/8 and<br>10/9, use 19/17; some slendro tunings use a third degree tempered between<br>ca. 9/7 and ca. 4/3, thus ca. 13/10). <br> <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 14 Jan 1997 17:58 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA13650; Tue, 14 Jan 1997 18:02:10 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA13648<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA25893; Tue, 14 Jan 1997 09:02:01 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 14 Jan 1997 09:02:01 -0800<br>Message-Id: <85970114164658/0005695065PK1EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>A Typology of Intonational Puns</h1><h3><a id=4600 href="#4600">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;106232.3266@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/1997 4:38:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I propose the following classification of _intonational puns_:<br><br>1.
