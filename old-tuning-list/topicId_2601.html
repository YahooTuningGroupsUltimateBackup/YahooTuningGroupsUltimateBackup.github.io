Hykes, who has lived in<br>>France since 1987, is a principal pioneer in the ?chant? and ?healing<br>>sounds? movement worldwide. The founder of  the harmonic chant  with his<br>>group, the Harmonic Choir,  Hykes was the first Western artist to study<br>>and spread awareness of the Tibetan, Tuvan and Mongolian styles of chant<br>>often called ?throat-singing,? in which a singer produces both a<br>>fundamental note and soaring harmonics from the note?s harmonic series.<br>>(Harmonics, or overtones, are to musical sound what the pure colors of<br>>the spectrum are to light.)<br>><br>>Hykes will present a concert program of his works for harmonic chant,<br>>accompanied by percussionist Robert Mann,  followed by a participatory<br>>workshop, ?harmonic source teachings,? devoted to this contemplative<br>>chant practice he has developed over the past 22 years. The harmonic<br>>chant combines innovative use of the monophonic and polyphonic resources<br>>of Western chant with an original approach to the vibratory mathematics<br>>of vocal harmonics, taken as ?the DNA of melody, harmony and rhythm.<br>><br>>Hykes and his group, the Harmonic Choir, were Artists-in-Residence at<br>>the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York for  ten years, where<br>>he participated in the first-ever joint concerts with the Gyuto and<br>>Gyume monks.   Hykes began his exploration of the realm of sacred chant<br>>in Mongolia, Tibet and Tuva at the age of 21; in New York  in 1975 he<br>>founded the Harmonic Choir , the first western group devoted to<br>>performing original overtone-based chant and singing.  Pioneers in the<br>>field of contemporary sacred world music, Hykes and his Choir were the<br>>first Western musicians to deeply explore new possibilities for vocal<br>>music based on harmonics. A new sacred art both  contemplative and<br>>dynamic, Hykes? s harmonic chant has been performed to great acclaim<br>>with the Harmonic Choir and in solo performances in some 25 countries<br>>since 1975.   Invited  to France by the French Ministry of  Culture in<br>>1987, Hykes has worked with theater director Peter Brook and founded an<br>>international music center, near Paris. Hykes has contributed music to<br>>many films, including ?Meetings with Remarkable Men,? ?Ghost,? ?Dead<br>>Poets Society? and ?Baraka.? The 8th ?David Hykes and the Harmonic<br>>Choir? CD has just been released, entitled ?Breath of the Heart? (Fonix<br>>Music, Denmark; US distributor: White Swan, Boulder, Colorado).<br>><br>>Founded by Hykes in 1979,  the Harmonic Arts Society was  the first<br>>cultural  organization in the western world devoted to ancient and<br>>modern vocal music based on harmonics. HAS has organized many<br>>cross-cultural projects, including an evening Hykes co-hosted with the<br>>Dalai Lama.<br>><br>>Tickets for the full evening are $40 (concert/presentation only, $20)<br>>and are available at the School. of Healing Arts.
