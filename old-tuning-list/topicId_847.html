I used an authentic cadence<br>as an example because it is almost certainly the single most common chord<br>progression involving dominant seventh chords.  <br><br>   I may be mistaken here, but I think that authentic cadences aren't terribly<br>common in barbershop style.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 6 Sep 1996 19:28 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA25577; Fri, 6 Sep 1996 19:29:29 +0200<br>Received: from sun4nl.NL.net by ns (smtpxd); id XA25613<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by sun4nl.NL.net (5.65b/CWI-3.3)<br>	id AA16290; Fri, 6 Sep 1996 19:29:26 +0200<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id KAA22828; Fri, 6 Sep 1996 10:28:00 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 6 Sep 1996 10:28:00 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960906102341.27851A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Barbershop 7th</h1><h3><a id=3553 href="#3553">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/1996 7:07:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> > >   Now understand that I don't doubt for a moment that tuning the seventh<br>sharper produces a MORE satisfying resolution.
