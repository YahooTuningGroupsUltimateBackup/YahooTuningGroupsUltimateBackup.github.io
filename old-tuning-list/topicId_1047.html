You can tune "any" equal-temperament across all keys linearly (that is some<br>    completely consistent number of cents between each adjacent key up the <br>    keyboard).

You can retune the notes of the keyboard to arbitrary pitches with a key-<br>    map.  The problem is that you're limited to 12-tone-per-octave tunings.  <br>    Again 19TET in the frequently-used "linear" mapping of 63.16 cents between<br>    adjacent key is not possible.

I don't know if the K2x00 <br>    provides any means like the EPS/ASR's patch-select buttons of <br>    interactively switching between tuning tables though.<br><br>   The rather cumbersome solution is to turn each key into its own individual<br>sample playback, and adjust the pitch of each accordingly.  There is apparently<br>a program that helps you do that.  <br><br>   But again, I'm not knocking Kurzweil or the 2x00.
