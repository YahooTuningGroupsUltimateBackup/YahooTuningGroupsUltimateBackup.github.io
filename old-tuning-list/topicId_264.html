The K2000 is very powerful, but it is not<br>very easy to do exotic things on.  The ASR-10...is FAR easier to use than the<br>K2000.  <br>------------------------------<br>HF: First of all, I am not employed, and have not been employed, by any synth<br>manufacturer. And I do know that if Steve Curtin has any influence at Ensoniq,<br>that their instruments will continue to be alternate-tuning friendly. And I have<br>seldom decided in favor of ease of use if the thing I needed to do could only be<br>done by a counterintuitive product. [I did a difficult orchestral score using<br>Finale 1.0--penning the score and parts almost certainly would have taken less<br>time!]<br><br>I have never used an ASR-10, but I have used Ensoniq EPS samplers, various<br>Yamaha FM synths, the Roland D50, etc. [mostly late 80s technology]. The manuals<br>for those Yamaha & Roland machines were awful, and Ensoniqs manuals were<br>certainly far superior. However, especially in comparison to other synths of<br>1991 vintage, the K2000 has an unusually large LCD display and a generally<br>intuitive architecture, once you spend a little time with it. Its manual is<br>superb, including several tutorials, and the video that came with it was really<br>helpful for your first evenings with the instrument. However, the manual does<br>devote VERY LITTLE space to setting up alternate tunings [just a little on page<br>15-1]--something I hope Kurzweil has, or will, correct. [Any Kurzweil employees<br>listening out there?]<br><br>Since its <<root>> sounds are good samples and multisamples, with some very<br>impressive synthesis algorithms for processing [especially those analogish<br>filters], it is not nearly as difficult to coax naturalistic sounds out of this<br>device as with the various pre-physical modelling synths. If you present your<br>music to the public, this is an important consideration.<br><br>Personally, I found the majority of the K2000 features placed where you would<br>expect. If you are familiar with a competing manufacturers products, you will<br>need to take a little time getting familiar with Kurzweils particular<br>terminology, but it is not any more obtuse, and probably less so, than that of<br>their competitors. [If the manufacturers can agree on General MIDI, why are they<br>unable to standardize their terminology???]<br><br>If you use my software, or if you acquire the 5-53 ET piano program disk that is<br>out there, you can certainly set up adjacent-pitch to adjacent-key tunings with<br>no problem. <br>-------------------------------<br>GM: When it comes to using traditional keyboards for nontraditional tunings,<br>that is a big question.  As I think I have mentioned before, most people just<br>map a tuning to the keyboard linearly [adjacent keys on the keyboard going to<br>adjacent pitches in the tuning], mismatching octave boundaries of the keyboard<br>to the octave boundaries of the tuning.  I am in awe of people who can function<br>that way, because I just cannot imagine being able to ignore the 7 ivory/5 ebony<br>structure that keyboard imposes.  <br>-------------------------------<br>HF: I agree that adjacent-pitch to adjacent-key mappings are counterintuitive if<br>you plan to perform directly from your standard keyboard.  That is why I came up<br>with the Clavette microtonal keyboard controller while at the Institute of<br>Sonology--my preferred way to play the K2000 with alternate tunings.<br><br>However, if you do not have such a luxury at your disposal, with a little<br>head-scratching you can work out pitch-MIDI key relations in your sequencer, or<br>pitch-12keyboard relations for live performance. <br><br>If you have already taken the time to research and understand tuning theory to<br>any degree, you certainly do have the intelligence to work out these pitch-MIDI<br>key relationships.<br>----------------------------<br><br>GM: I prefer, personally, to map the keyboard so that [somehow] octave<br>boundaries in the tuning match octave boundaries on the keyboard, preferably in<br>some meaningful way.  [This sort of thing is very easy to do on the ASR-10, but<br>somewhat more difficult on the K2000, according to my informant.]  For example,<br>in 10TET, I map the keyboard so that adjacent Es and Fs play the same pitch, and<br>similarly with adjacent Bs and Cs.<br>---------------------------<br>HF: While my software currently does not allow for this, I will consider it for<br>a future release. In the meantime, it certainly CAN still be done on the K2000<br>with a little adjustment to my programs output.<br><br>Just remember that all semitone [ST] and cent offsets in the K2000 Keymap editor<br>are expressed as offsets from the expected standard 12ET pitch. So to get the<br>Kurzweil C4 [MIDI key 60] key to play C4 1/4-tone sharp, and to get key C#4 to<br>play the same pitch, type in:<br><br>key range: C4 to C4<br>ST: 0<br>cents: 50<br><br>key range C#4 to C#4<br>ST: 0<br>cents: -50			<br><br>Of course, to make sure the resulting tone sounds decent, you need to check that<br>your sample root is somewhere in the neighborhood of the resulting pitch. Or, if<br>you like purely synthetic timbres, use waveforms in place of sample roots, or<br>perhaps deliberately use the <<wrong>> sample roots if you like.<br><br>if you are a little patient, and can program your VCR [or could easily learn to<br>do so], you should NOT be scared away by the K2000 in terms of ease of use. But,<br>I am assuming you have some basic familiarity with tuning theory  as well as<br>rudiments of sound synthesis.<br><br>If programming synths really terrifies you, and if you just want to use canned<br>sounds and tunings, decide which <<cannings>> suit you best, and buy the synth<br>with the ones you want. The K2000 provides a number of historic pythagorean,<br>well, and just tunings, plus Carlos alpha and beta. I know that the Yamaha TX802<br>includes 1/4-tones, 1/8-tones, and also some other historic tunings.  I think<br>the Korg Wavestation, a synth with a cool vector synthesis system, also has some<br>built-in and 1 or 2 user-definable tunings.
