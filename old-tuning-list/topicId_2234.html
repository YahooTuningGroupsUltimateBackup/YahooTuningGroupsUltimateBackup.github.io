Third, von Helmholtz (p.321 of<br>Dover Edition) quotes Marpurg who quotes Kirnberger, a pupil of J.S.<br>Bach, that he required all major Thirds to be sharpened, and this can<br>only mean sharpened with respect to MT which is 14 cents flatter the ET.<br>This is important not only to show Bach's preferences, but to indicate<br>how clavier tuners probably tuned in ET as a practical matter at that<br>time (pre 1750). Furthermore, Bach's son Emanuel is quoted in 1753 as<br>declaring ET as 'required' for the 'true art of playing the clavier'.<br>3) There is no doubt that all the great masters of the classical period<br>considered ET to be the ideal.

They were not<br>brainwashed followers of popular enthusiasm but aesthetic leaders. I am<br>also happy to stand with them in disagreeing with the remark often made<br>here and elsewhere that ET is some sort of a 'compromise' system of<br>tuning. ET is certainly not and should not be considered in the same<br>league as MT which is a compromise. ET was a great discovery-both<br>aesthetic and scientific-and without it, Western music could not have<br>achieved its unique glory.
