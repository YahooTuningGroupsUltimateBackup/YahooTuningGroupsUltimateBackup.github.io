The traditional blues scale, most agree, is 6 notes (in C): C, Eb, F,<br>F# (Gb), G, Bb, C(1,b3,4,#4 (b5),5,b7,1).

This creates a tension which is an integral part of the very root of<br>blues. This tension is dealt with by bending notes: the 4th (I'm using<br>the Major scale as a reference) is bent up to the 5th, passing through<br>the b5th on the way; the Dom 7th is bent to the Root; the b 3rd is bent<br>to the Maj 3rd, which means that it can be played very pure if so<br>desired. But, there's more; the Maj 6th is bent to the Dom 7th, which<br>also means a very pure b7th can be played; the Maj 2nd is often bent to<br>the Maj 3rd as well, passing through the b 3rd on it's way. And, most<br>players have their own ways of doing all these bends, with their own<br>variations. In other words, every blues player is a composer/arranger<br>automatically, again unlike the current state of Western classical<br>tradition (but, early European musicians were composers/arrangers too).<br>No one can say just when to play a given bend; that's always improvised.<br>It's more like probabilities of where notes will appear, which links<br>blues deeply to Indian and Middle Eastern music, as well as quantum<br>physics.<br><br>2. What further deepens the blues is something my teacher, master jazz<br>man George Keith, once said: "blues is a feeling, and a set of chord<br>changes." This is quite true; this means that we can have a wide range of<br>blues styles, from the 1 chord vamps of John Lee Hooker to the complex<br>bop of Charlie Parker, with many stops in between, and they're ALL valid<br>and real.

You don't; you must somehow live the lifestyle of<br>the music.<br><br>The depth and complexity of the blues has greatly influenced much of 20th<br>century music. It fed the rock revolutions of the 1950's and '60's, and<br>is a common thread between rock, bluegrass, jazz, country, rockabilly,<br>folk, funk, and others. It is a great form of expression, and is quite<br>applicable to musics of the future as well. For example, 19 equal expands<br>very creatively and well on the 12 tone system of blues, and moves it<br>forward for the 1st time since Hendrix took Howlin' Wolf into the space<br>age.<br><br>    And yet, after all these years of playing it, I don't think I really<br>know the exact origin of the blues scale. Is it African (very likely)? As<br>I said, it is very Middle Eastern in many ways...does anyone out there<br>know for sure? I would appreciate any info on this<br>subject...thanks...Hstick<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed) <br>Subject:  septimal keys<br>PostedDate:  11-01-98 08:49:40<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  11-01-98 08:49:13-11-01-98 08:49:14,11-01-98 08:49:04-11-01-98 08:49:05<br>DeliveredDate:  11-01-98 08:49:05<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256589.002AF1A6; Sun, 11 Jan 1998 08:49:32 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA19615; Sun, 11 Jan 1998 08:49:40 +0100<br>Date: Sun, 11 Jan 1998 08:49:40 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA19629<br>Received: (qmail 4269 invoked from network); 10 Jan 1998 23:49:37 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 10 Jan 1998 23:49:37 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.108019@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=7020 href="#7020">ðŸ”—</a>wauchope@AIC.NRL.Navy.Mil</h3><span>1/13/1998 6:25:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> Hstick wrote:<br>> after all these years of playing it, I don't think I really<br>> know the exact origin of the blues scale.

When I<br>later tried to recreate the tuning from memory, this came close to<br>capturing the remembered effect:<br><br>	1/1  11/9  11/8  3/2  11/6  2/1<br><br>To get this sound out of a Western instrument, an early African<br>American would have had to approximate the elevenal ratios by bending<br>adjacent notes of the Western scale: major-minor third for the 11/9,<br>fourth-tritone for the 11/8 and major-minor seventh for the 11/6<br>(blues pianists get the same effect by hitting both notes at once).<br>These are the three "blue note" areas whose pitch fluctuates and bends<br>in blues performance, and so could result from the effort to reconcile<br>an African and Western tuning.<br><br>The neutral thirds would also explain the resemblance to Middle<br>Eastern music.  P.S. As Kathleen Schlesinger notes in _The Greek<br>Aulos_, primitive flutes drilled simply with equally-spaced finger<br>holes tend to produce undertonal scales, and it's been my experience<br>that such flutes often contain a neutral third -- possibly from the<br>undertonal sequence<br><br>	11/10  11/9  11/8  11/7  11/6  11/5<br><br>which might be closer to what that Bambara flute was actually up to.<br><br>Anyway, this is just one speculation -- there are many theories about<br>the origin of the blues scale and we'll probably never know for sure.<br><br>-- Ken Wauchope<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed) <br>Subject:  Re: MIDI/Audio wish list<br>PostedDate:  13-01-98 19:47:59<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  13-01-98 19:47:37-13-01-98 19:47:37,13-01-98 19:47:25-13-01-98 19:47:26<br>DeliveredDate:  13-01-98 19:47:26<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125658B.0067389B; Tue, 13 Jan 1998 19:47:55 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06037; Tue, 13 Jan 1998 19:47:59 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 13 Jan 1998 19:47:59 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06036<br>Received: (qmail 29224 invoked from network); 13 Jan 1998 10:47:45 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 13 Jan 1998 10:47:45 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.193993@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
