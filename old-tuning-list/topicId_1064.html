Further, it is<br>useful (not essential, but useful) when intervals are invariant under<br>transposition. For example: in the key of C, Johnston`s  d1 a1 has the<br>ratio of 40/27, which I would notate as d1 -a1, the minus indicating the<br>lowering of a by a syntonic comma. The minus sign is an immediate cue that,<br>(1) the interval is not pythagorean, but reduced by a comma, and (2) that<br>the interval ratio will have 5 in the  numerator and some factor of three<br>in the denominator.<br><br>(2) Regarding Adamï¿½s argument regarding the advantage of Johnstonï¿½s<br>notation because one may use Johnstonï¿½s players: In Germany, at least, the<br>only Just notation to have any currency is essentially what I have<br>described in the version promoted by Prof. Vogel in Bonn.  I reckon that<br>the number of musicians who have worked with Vogelï¿½s system is similar to<br>if not greater than the number who have worked with Johnstonï¿½s, and there<br>has been a great effort by his students to make and publish transcriptions<br>of classical repertoire into his notation (which raises some entirely<br>different issues as performance materials, but has no small interest as a<br>kind of functional analysis). If I were to present the arguments for and<br>against the individual systems to a large group of accomplished musicians,<br>my guess is that the interval invariance of pythagorean-based notations<br>would win out in terms of performer friendliness; it certainly wins out in<br>terms of analyst friendliness. (And if the Kronos does not want to learn<br>another notation, I am perfectly satisfied to stick with the Arditti).<br><br>(3) Lastly, I cannot but note that there has always been a sort of inertia<br>in the tuning community (akin to the inertia that left us with VHS and not<br>the superior Betamax technology). If some standard is set, there is a<br>tendency to treat it religiously. I recall conversations with devout<br>Partchians more than twenty years ago who felt it a sacrilege to use any<br>pitch standard than 1/1-196. I think that this attachment to the Johnston<br>notation is a further case in point. When I advocate an alternative, it is<br>only that, with its own specific advantages and disadvantages. I am<br>personally very attracted to Wilsonï¿½s notations with twelve nominals in<br>place of seven and a staff of alternating groups of two and three lines<br>(much like Hauerï¿½s _atonal_ notation), but I am not optimistic about the<br>prospects for finding performers willing to take that stretch.  <br><br>Daniel Wolf, Frankfurt<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 28 Oct 1996 18:17 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03686; Sun, 27 Oct 1996 05:05:30 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02855<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id VAA08077; Sat, 26 Oct 1996 21:05:28 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 26 Oct 1996 21:05:28 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9610262358.A11785-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Notation for Partch</h1><h3><a id=3857 href="#3857">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;106232.3266@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/1996 2:49:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>(1) My point is only that if one is interested in making a tonal analysis<br>of a Partch score from within the Partch perspective, that is locating a<br>given pitch, dyad, triad, tetrad etc within the diamond structure, then it<br>is useful (not essential, but useful) when the notation of the<br>transcription shows immediately how an interval is factored.
