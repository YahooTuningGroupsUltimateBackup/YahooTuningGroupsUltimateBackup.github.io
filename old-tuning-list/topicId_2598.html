A<br>brave attempt at a theory of diatonic, 7-limit harmony.<br><br>Now, back to picking his posts apart paragraph by paragraph:<br><br>>The harmonic entropy curve, like the Plomp-Levelt roughness curve for tones<br>>with harmonic partials, has local minima at small-integer ratios. It is<br>>standard in physics (and justified by calculus) to approximate any local<br>>minimum with a parabola. Therefore, near a just ratio, the change in<br>>dissonance is proportional to the squared detuning.<br><br>I don't have Plomp & Levelt's curve to hand, but I do have Kameoka &<br>Kuriyagawa's.  The minima don't look much like parabolas to me.  I<br>question this generalisation for physics as well, but that needn't<br>bother the rest of you.<br><br><br>A Farey series would be like a Partch even limit, right?<br><br>> These curves look remarkably like many of<br>> the Helmholtz/Plomp curves that were derived from completely different<br>> assumptions,<br><br>I'd guess any function that bears some relation to the overtone series<br>would produce a qualitatively equivalent curve.  The entropy method<br>then looks like a good way of going from functions of integer ratios<br>to a continuous curve.  There are lots of the former, of course -- the<br>Partch limit, LCM, generalised harmonic distances, or counting the<br>"filled" partials of the virtual pitch.<br><br>> How to<br>> weigh the various subsets' contributions to the probabilities of<br>> particular fundamentals in an overall analysis is unclear. Even without<br>> the consideration of subsets, there appears to be no mathematical theory<br>> of ratios of three of more numbers analogous to Farey theory, and no<br>> easy way to create one. Unlike roughness, tonalness is not merely<br>> concerned with pairwise interactions of tones but three-way and higher<br>> interactions as well. A mathematical model for it is out of my grasp at<br>> the moment.<br><br>It's crucial that a concordance theory be made to work for more than<br>dyads.  I think here that the entropy method will become rapidly<br>computationally intensive the more notes are involved.  I would try<br>this myself, but I've got software to write, and I might get a job<br>soon, so I don't really have the time ...<br><br>As a composer, I feel a theory of chords is more useful than one of<br>dyads.  Most useful of all, though, is a theory of chord sequences.<br>This is where lattices come into their own.  As a programmer, speed<br>and memory are important, so I'm planning to go for harmonic<br>distances if I ever get around to dynamic tuning.  I think a<br>Euclidian distance on a parallelogram lattice should include<br>approximations to both Partch limits and LCMs.<br><br><br>BTW, I had a flanger on when I did my listening experiment before,<br>which explains the unpleasentness of the 31TET 4:6:7.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  William Sethares <sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Subject:  consonance calculations<br>PostedDate:  04-11-97 21:11:56<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  04-11-97 21:10:56-04-11-97 21:10:57,04-11-97 20:11:20-04-11-97 20:11:21<br>DeliveredDate:  04-11-97 20:11:21<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256545.006ED8BB; Tue, 4 Nov 1997 21:10:44 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02476; Tue, 4 Nov 1997 21:11:56 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 4 Nov 1997 21:11:56 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02474<br>Received: (qmail 29649 invoked from network); 4 Nov 1997 12:11:51 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 4 Nov 1997 12:11:51 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199711042008.AA10088@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6390 href="#6390">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.

A<br>brave attempt at a theory of diatonic, 7-limit harmony.<br><br>Now, back to picking his posts apart paragraph by paragraph:<br><br>>The harmonic entropy curve, like the Plomp-Levelt roughness curve for tones<br>>with harmonic partials, has local minima at small-integer ratios. It is<br>>standard in physics (and justified by calculus) to approximate any local<br>>minimum with a parabola. Therefore, near a just ratio, the change in<br>>dissonance is proportional to the squared detuning.<br><br>I don't have Plomp & Levelt's curve to hand, but I do have Kameoka &<br>Kuriyagawa's.  The minima don't look much like parabolas to me.  I<br>question this generalisation for physics as well, but that needn't<br>bother the rest of you.<br><br><br>A Farey series would be like a Partch even limit, right?<br><br>> These curves look remarkably like many of<br>> the Helmholtz/Plomp curves that were derived from completely different<br>> assumptions,<br><br>I'd guess any function that bears some relation to the overtone series<br>would produce a qualitatively equivalent curve.  The entropy method<br>then looks like a good way of going from functions of integer ratios<br>to a continuous curve.  There are lots of the former, of course -- the<br>Partch limit, LCM, generalised harmonic distances, or counting the<br>"filled" partials of the virtual pitch.<br><br>> How to<br>> weigh the various subsets' contributions to the probabilities of<br>> particular fundamentals in an overall analysis is unclear. Even without<br>> the consideration of subsets, there appears to be no mathematical theory<br>> of ratios of three of more numbers analogous to Farey theory, and no<br>> easy way to create one. Unlike roughness, tonalness is not merely<br>> concerned with pairwise interactions of tones but three-way and higher<br>> interactions as well. A mathematical model for it is out of my grasp at<br>> the moment.<br><br>It's crucial that a concordance theory be made to work for more than<br>dyads.  I think here that the entropy method will become rapidly<br>computationally intensive the more notes are involved.  I would try<br>this myself, but I've got software to write, and I might get a job<br>soon, so I don't really have the time ...<br><br>As a composer, I feel a theory of chords is more useful than one of<br>dyads.  Most useful of all, though, is a theory of chord sequences.<br>This is where lattices come into their own.  As a programmer, speed<br>and memory are important, so I'm planning to go for harmonic<br>distances if I ever get around to dynamic tuning.  I think a<br>Euclidian distance on a parallelogram lattice should include<br>approximations to both Partch limits and LCMs.<br><br><br>BTW, I had a flanger on when I did my listening experiment before,<br>which explains the unpleasentness of the 31TET 4:6:7.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  William Sethares <sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Subject:  consonance calculations<br>PostedDate:  04-11-97 21:11:56<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  04-11-97 21:10:56-04-11-97 21:10:57,04-11-97 20:11:20-04-11-97 20:11:21<br>DeliveredDate:  04-11-97 20:11:21<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256545.006ED8BB; Tue, 4 Nov 1997 21:10:44 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02476; Tue, 4 Nov 1997 21:11:56 +0100<br>Date: Tue, 4 Nov 1997 21:11:56 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02474<br>Received: (qmail 29649 invoked from network); 4 Nov 1997 12:11:51 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 4 Nov 1997 12:11:51 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199711042008.AA10088@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6390 href="#6390">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.
