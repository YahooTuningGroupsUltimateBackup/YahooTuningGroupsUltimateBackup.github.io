(who was the first, where and when ?)<br> <br> There are other names related to the same, i.e. "mutable notes", "unfixed <br>scale", "by generations" that I believe I read them first in the Catgut <br>Acoustical Society Magazine in the '70s, and "Extended Reference".<br>(((( On T.D. 898 (from last Sunday) Adam commented about "Free JI", Thanks &<br>fine,.., and Brian mentioned a book from the internal collection of the CNRS<br>titled "Acoustique Musicale," from 1959, and its first article "The dynamism<br>of scales and consonances in the main acoustical systems and its influence <br>on the development of music" by Jacques Chailley. <br>The word "dynamism" has our "Dynamic-wandering" smell or we go on semantics ?<br>:-)> . )))).      <br> <br> Excuse me, Gary, the name of the Warren Creel article was not "Dynamic in <br>Music" as I said in my last e-mail (T.D 896) but "Extended Reference : An <br>Unrecognized Dynamic in Melody" Paul C. Boomsliter and Warren Creel (The <br>Journal of Music Theory, Spring 1963 . 7 : 1, A Yale School of Music <br>Publication), and it's not the same "Dynamic in Music" (that implies also and <br>historically "first" the change of volume) than "Dynamic in Melody".<br> <br> On 1 Dec. 1978 I read my paper on "Dynamic Gamut" in the ASA meeting held <br>in Honolulu and later W.
