Most of the<br>score is 12tet but there are a good number of places in the film where I used<br>a 23 tone scale based on the Fibonacci series.  Often times tetrads were<br>pulled out of this scale and laid over 12tet passages.  I also used in 2<br>places (about 3/4 of the way into the movie) a JI scale<br>(16-18-20-171-24-27-28-32) in a blues-oriented piece for large rhythm section,<br>string quartet, and violin section.  It's a fun movie.  Hope you all get a<br>chance to see it.  Opens August 28th in major theatres nationwide.<br>Xenharmonically yours,<br>Stephen James Taylor</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>New Film with Microtonal Score</h1><h3><a id=8353 href="#8353">ðŸ”—</a>&#x3C;KIBADACHI@aol.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/1998 11:58:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Just wanted to bring to your attention a new Warner Brothers film called WHY<br>DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE for which I wrote the music underscore.
