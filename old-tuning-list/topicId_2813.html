I shall have plenty of new things to say, so no one will be<br>bored.<br><br>When a note of a melody is raised or lowered by as much as 30 cents or<br>so - not coincidentally about half the melodic limen - the typical<br>careful listener begins to perceive that note as somehow vaguely<br>changed, as 'colored' or 'shaded', but the melody itself remains<br>unchanged.<br><br>The exact value depends slightly on whether the particular interval in<br>question is consonant or dissonant with the tonic, as well as on other<br>factors, notably the timbre of the instrument. It is well-known that<br>certain instruments producing a rich array of partials produce a more<br>clear conception of definite pitch in the minds of listeners than other<br>instruments of a harsher or more noiselike character.<br><br>According to Benade's hypothesis, which common experience certainly<br>supports, the mind can, even in monody, apparently perceive consonances<br>more exactly than dissonances.<br><br>As we sharp or flat the note by more than 30 cents or so, we begin to<br>convince an ever larger percentage of listeners that the note has not<br>merely been 'shaded' or 'colored' but essentially changed, and the<br>melody itself essentially altered. Those who imagine that audiences can<br>be taught to be more perceptive to the point of changing markedly the<br>point at which they consider the melody to be essentially changed,<br>certainly delude themselves; even peoples who treasure enharmonic melody<br>above all, such as the Arabs and Indians, never require  such superhuman<br>hypersensitivity of their audiences.<br><br>But even were it possible to acquire such godlike powers of<br>discrimination, we would only reduce music into a different art-form,<br>with quite a different mission, namely spoken speech.<br><br>By the time we have sharped or flatted a given note within a melody by<br>about 60 cents, we have - under typical musical conditions of confusion,<br>distraction and excitement - eliminated virtually all doubt in virtually<br>all listeners that the melody has been changed. To respect these limits<br>on human aural acuity is to produce music that may be good; to violate<br>these limits is to ensure that music will be in bad taste.<br><br>Not coincidentally perhaps, it so happens that singers cannot be trained<br>to reliably sing intervals closer than about 60 cents. That, for<br>example, the Greek theorists chose 56 cents and even slightly closer<br>intervals to tune instruments<br>enharmonically, suggests at most that there is sometimes a regrettable<br>tendency to tune instruments so as to produce slightly narrower<br>intervals than what singers can comfortably sing. Snobbery is a<br>universal human trait, and rarely produces anything very admirable.<br><br>Note also that there are real limits on a singer's ability to reliably<br>sing a long sequence even of 1/3 tones. A melody with four or five 1/3<br>tones in a row, even if it could be sung, which is doubtful, would<br>probably be apt only for some strange special effect. One of the<br>delightful paradoxes of the 19-tone equal is that, even though it has a<br>wider, slightly more readily-sung diatonic semitone than the 12-tone<br>equal (126.6 cents versus 100 cents) nevertheless the 19 system has a<br>far wider variety of chromatic modes, because its tuning degree is<br>narrower (63.3 cents versus 100 cents).<br><br>Returning however to my immediate subject: it is easy to confuse our<br>ears' ability to perceive a minute change in pitch of a given note<br>sounded successively, with our far less accurate ability to perceive a<br>note's having been changed in pitch _in a given melody_, where we have<br>nothing to compare that note to, except the tonic and the other notes of<br>the melody.<br><br>I wish to emphasize that the melodic limen seems to be affected but very<br>little by cultural environment. The modern Arabs are a good example.<br>Under both native pythagorean and heavy Western influence, the modern<br>Arab theorists have adopted 24-tone equal temperament to describe their<br>native melody. (They have also copied the 53-tone equal from the West,<br>which from their point of view at least gives an approximation to the<br>1/3 tone.)<br><br>The typical Westerner finds 24-tone equal less notionally threatening to<br>his theoretico-musical worldview than 19-tone equal or some other<br>system, and the Arabs have been greatly influenced by the modern West,<br>even in such intimate matters as sexual mores and the like.<br>Nevertheless, beginning as long ago as Villoteau (1809), whenever Arab<br>singers are studied, the evidence is quite impressive that they use, in<br>enharmonic melody, a range of close intervals much better described by a<br>1/3 tone than by a 1/4 tone. Various Westerners, beginning with Ellis (a<br>person not known for a particularly open mind), have attacked these<br>results in all sorts of ingenious ways.<br><br>But the fact is that singers of whatever culture find melodic intervals<br>as close as 50 cents very difficult to sing, and tend to substitute a<br>somewhat wider interval. This is not a very pleasing subject to the<br>typical modern Western musician, who usually finds even the idea of a<br>melodic 1/4 tone, much less a melodic 1/3 tone, alien to his habits of<br>theoretical thought, and this in spite of the fact that our _own_<br>popular singers deliberately use 1/3 tones all the time, at least since<br>the 60's ? but so far as I can discover, do not use 1/4 tones except by<br>accident.<br><br>In short, so strong is the insidious hold of the 12-tone equal on the<br>modern academic Western musician, that he would rather pretend that the<br>Arabs use the mythical vocal 1/4 tone, because this seems to be more in<br>theoretical conformity with the 12-tone equal, than admit that they use<br>something much closer to the 1/3 tone, which anyone can sing, but which<br>leads directly outside 12-tone equal to 19-tone equal temperament. There<br>really do seem to now exist certain Western musicians whose ear-training<br>at the piano has succeeded so well, alas, that they prefer the 12-tone<br>equal even to just intervals.<br><br>But such are not the musicians that screaming crowds try to tear to<br>pieces in a frenzy of adulation. It is the rock vocalists, who, at least<br>incipiently, use the tonality of the 1/3 tone, who enjoy _that_ godlike<br>destiny, which Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven in their day likewise<br>enjoyed.<br><br>And this is very ironic, you know, because the music of a Haydn even now<br>might have a far greater popular following than it does have, were it<br>played not in 12-tone equal, nor yet in what Haydn used to compose at<br>his keyboard<br>(a selection from 55-tone equal, it appears) but in the tonality which<br>the rock vocalists are steadily making ever dearer to the masses - that<br>of the 19-tone equal. And as it happens, the 19 system is far closer in<br>harmonic effect to what most of the classical composers used (at least<br>down to Beethoven), than is the 12 system. Beethoven, by the way, played<br>in 19-tone equal is a treat indeed.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Bob Lee" <quasar@wco.com><br>Subject:  19tet vs. meantone?<br>PostedDate:  17-12-97 07:23:39<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  17-12-97 07:21:38-17-12-97 07:21:39,17-12-97 07:21:17-17-12-97 07:21:17<br>DeliveredDate:  17-12-97 07:21:17<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256570.0022ED41; Wed, 17 Dec 1997 07:23:25 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17457; Wed, 17 Dec 1997 07:23:39 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 17 Dec 1997 07:23:39 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA17682<br>Received: (qmail 6600 invoked from network); 16 Dec 1997 22:23:35 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 16 Dec 1997 22:23:35 -0800<br>Message-Id: <01bd0ab3$f8e7b380$b25e04c7@default><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6676 href="#6676">ðŸ”—</a>Johnny Reinhard &#x3C;reinhard@IDT.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/1997 7:05:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Bradford Catler played just intonation pedal steel in my cello concerto<br>Odysseus last May.
