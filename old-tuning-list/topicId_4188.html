In a<br>14th-century setting, such intervals can be seen as an accentuated<br>expression of the usual cadential aesthetics as discussed by more<br>conventional theorists such as Prosdocimus (1413), and realized in<br>actual compositions of the period. <br><br>For these exponents of standard Pythagorean tuning, as for Marchettus,<br>thirds and sixths are "tolerable" but active intervals which "strive"<br>for resolution to stable 3-limit intervals by stepwise contrary motion<br>including efficient semitonal progressions (e.g. m3-1, M3-5, M6-8).<br>While a tuning based on the usual Pythagorean mathematics very nicely<br>serves this Gothic aesthetic, the "superwide" major thirds and sixths<br>of Marchettus and the "supernarrow" leading-tones suggested by his<br>division of the tone can be seen as a more dramatic manifestation of<br>the same musical feeling.<br><br><br>--------------------------------------<br>1. Marchettus, semitones, and cadences<br>--------------------------------------<br><br>Like conventional Gothic theorists, Marchettus expounds a<br>sophisticated technique of polyphony in which the octave (2:1), fifth<br>(3:2), and fourth (4:3) are stable concords, while the whole-tone<br>(9:8) is a basic element of melody. Thirds and sixths -- which many<br>theorists of the era describe as "imperfect concords" or "intermediate<br>concords," and Marchettus calls "tolerable discords" -- strive for<br>resolution by directed contrary motion to stable concords.<br><br>Both for conventional theorists of the epoch and for Marchettus, an<br>unstable third or sixth should approach as closely as possible the<br>stable concord toward which it tends. Traditional Pythagorean tuning<br>nicely serves this artistic ideal: it provides active thirds and<br>sixths, and narrow leading-tones for cadential resolutions such as<br>m3-1, M3-5, and M6-8.<br><br>In this system, the diatonic semitone or _limma_ (e.g. e-f or b-c') is<br>a compact 256:243 or ~90.22 cents, while the larger chromatic semitone<br>or _apotome_ is 2187:2048 or ~113.69 cents (e.g. c-c#, eb-e). Such a<br>tuning makes for efficient and expressive cadences. In the following<br>diagrams, numbers in parentheses show vertical intervals in cents, and<br>signed numbers show ascending or descending melodic motions:<br><br>   e  --  -204 -- d        g# --  +90 -- a       f#' --  +90 -- g'  <br> (294)           (0)     (408)         (702)   (906)          (1200)<br>   c# --   +90 -- d        e  -- -204 -- d       a   -- -204 -- g<br>  <br>   m3      -      1        M3      -     5       M6       -     8<br><br>In these progressions, the unstable m3 (32:27, ~294.13 cents), M3<br>(81:64, ~407.82 cents), or M6 (27:16, ~905.87 cents) is relatively<br>concordant, but has a definite "edge" adding impetus to the<br>resolution. One voice moves by what Mark Lindley[1] has aptly called<br>an "incisive" limma of 90 cents, and the other by a generous 204-cent<br>whole-tone (9:8).<br><br>Marchettus may have been motivated to devise a new division of the<br>whole-tone both in order to make these cadences even more dramatic and<br>efficient, and to make the intricate Pythagorean mathematics simpler.<br><br>He proposes a division of the 9:8 tone into "five parts," a proposal<br>which seems to permit of two interpretations. The first reading,<br>favored by Jan Herlinger, divides the tone into five _equal_ portions<br>of about 41 cents each.[2]<br><br>The second reading is suggested by a passage where Marchettus suggests<br>that the tone with its 9:8 ratio might be divided into "five parts" as<br>follows: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. This could be taken as a division actually<br>based on _1/9-tones_, very close as it happens to the ~22.64-cent<br>steps of 53-tone equal temperament (53-tet):<br><br>First reading (5 equal parts):     1/5    1/5    1/5    1/5     1/5<br>Second reading (5 unequal parts):  1/9  2/9     2/9     2/9    2/9    <br><br>David Lenson, in a study of 14th-century manuscript accidentals and<br>intonations available on the World Wide Web[3], favors this<br>interpretation.<br><br>As the more mathematically orthodox Prosdocimus will emphatically<br>assert a century later (1413, 1425), such even divisions of a ratio<br>such as 9:8 are _in no way_ possible using the integer mathematics of<br>Pythagorean just intonation -- or other integer ratio systems, one<br>might add. Rather, such divisions seem akin to the tradition of<br>Aristoxenos, who pragmatically recognized intervals such as<br>1/6-octaves although they cannot be expressed as integer ratios..<br><br>As flexible in his terminology as in his arithmetic, Marchettus<br>borrowed the names of the three Greek genera to describe three kinds<br>of semitones resulting from his division of the tone.<br><br>An _enharmonic_ semitone, corresponding with the usual Pythagorean<br>diatonic semitone found at mi-fa (e.g. e-f), has "two parts" out of<br>the five. In the 1/5-tone reading, this normal semitone would be equal<br>to 2/5-tone or ~81.56 cents; in the 1/9-tone reading, it might be<br>equal to two "parts" of 2/9-tone each, thus yielding a 4/9-tone<br>interval (~90.63 cents) virtually identical to the usual Pythagorean<br>limma of ~90.22 cents).<br><br>A _diatonic_ semitone, corresponding to the chromatic Pythagorean<br>semitone, has "three parts." If these parts are equal 1/5-tones, then<br>this semitone would be 3/5-tone or ~122.35 cents; in the 1/9-tone<br>reading, if we take these three parts as 1/9-tone, 2/9-tone, 2/9-tone,<br>then a 5/9-tone interval of ~113.28 cents, almost identical to the<br>Pythagorean apotome, results.<br><br>A _chromatic_ semitone, by which Marchettus prescribes a note should<br>be inflected before a cadence (e.g. amount by which cadential g# is<br>raised from g), has "four parts" out of five. In the 1/5-tone reading,<br>this means an interval of 4/5-tone or ~163.13 cents, leaving a<br>cadential leading-tone (e.g. g#-a) of only 1/5-tone or ~40.78 cents.<br>In the 1/9-tone reading, if we take one of the "four parts" as the<br>1/9-tone portion (2/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9), we get an interval of<br>7/9-tone or ~158.60 cents, leaving a leading-tone of 2/9-tone or<br>~45.31 cents.<br><br>Even in the latter reading, this scheme if taken literally results in<br>cadential semitones of only about 45 cents, and cadential major thirds<br>and sixths of about 453 cents and 951 cents respectively -- about<br>midway between a Pythagorean M3 and fourth, or M6 and m7!<br><br>While we have no way of being sure that such an intonation was not at<br>times used, one tempting interpretation is that Marchettus was<br>providing an easy-to-remember scheme for singers rather than an exact<br>mathematical formula. If we take his "enharmonic" and "diatonic"  <br>semitones as essentially equivalent to the Pythagorean limma and<br>apotome, then his narrow cadential leading-tone might be somewhat<br>narrower than the usual 90-cent limma but not quite so narrow as<br>1/5-tone or 2/9-tone.<br><br><br>----------------------------<br>2. A "quasi-7-limit" reading<br>----------------------------<br><br>By following the 1/9-tone reading of Marchettus's "five part" division<br>of the tone -- but defining the parts as 3/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 3/9 -- we<br>can arrive at an interesting result where cadential semitones are<br>equal to about 1/3-tone, and major thirds and sixth to ratios not far<br>from 9:7 and 12:7.<br><br>Thus our new "fivefold division" of the tone would be<br><br>"Parts":             1       2       3        4                5<br>           3/9       |  1/9  |  1/9  |  1/9   |      3/9       |<br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br>cents:   (Pyth)     67      90      114      137              204<br>         (53-tet)   68      91      113      136              204<br><br>----------------------<br>   3/9 = cadential (limma - comma)<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Topic No. 11<br>   4/9 = limma (mi-fa)<br><br>--------------------------------------<br>   5/9 = apotome (e.g. c-c#)<br><br>-----------------------------------------------<br>   6/9 = superapotome (e.g. c-c# in c-c#-d)<br><br>In this scheme, we get regular diatonic and chromatic semitones of<br>4/9-tone and 5/9-tone, almost identical either to the usual<br>Pythagorean limma and apotome, or to 53-tet semitones of 4/53 octave<br>and 5/53 octave. Additionally, we get a "supercompact" cadential<br>semitone of 3/9-tone, equivalent either to a limma minus a Pythagorean<br>comma or to 3/53 octave.<br><br>Let us see how the standard two-voice progressions discussed by<br>Marchettus and illustrated in his musical examples look when we apply<br>our leading-tone of 3/9-tone: <br><br>  e  --  -204 -- d        g# --  +67 -- a       f#' --  +67 -- g'  <br> (271)          (0)     (431)         (702)   (929)          (1200)<br>  c# --   +67 -- d        e  -- -204 -- d       a   -- -204 -- g<br>  <br>  m3      -      1        M3      -     5       M6       -     8<br><br>Here we arrive at a minor third of ~271 cents, close to 7:6; a major<br>third of ~431 cents, close to 9:7; and a major sixth of ~929 cents,<br>close to 12:7. These intervals, about a Pythagorean comma or 1/9-tone<br>closer to their stable goals than even the usual Pythagorean<br>intervals, seem to fit Marchettus's accentuated version of usual<br>14th-century cadential aesthetics.<br><br>In practice, of course, singers and players of non-fixed-pitch<br>instruments would doubtless vary in their cadential intonations. From<br>a xenharmonic perspective, here are some tunings suggesting the range<br>of possibilities:<br><br>                cadential m2   m3 (to 1)    M3 (to 5)   M6 (to 8)<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Pyth +/- comma     66.76        270.67       431.28       929.33<br>                limma-comma  32:27-comma  81:64+comma  27:16+comma<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>7-limit            62.96        266.87       435.08       933.13<br>                   28:27          7:6          9:7         12:7<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>53-tet             67.92        271.70       430.19       928.30<br>                 3/53 oct      12/53 oct    19/53 oct    41/53 oct<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>17-tet             70.59        282.35       423.53       917.64<br>                 1/17 oct      4/17 oct     6/17 oct     13/17 oct<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>These are only some convenient landmarks on the xenharmonic continuum;<br>for example, a more subtle stretching of a Pythagorean major third<br>cadencing to a fifth might result in an interval mentioned by Charlie<br>Jordon in Tuning Digest 1577 -- 14:11 (~417.51 cents), about 10 cents<br>wider than a usual 81:64 (~407.82 cents).<br><br><br>--------------------------------------<br>3. Marchettus as a Gothic Aristoxenian <br>--------------------------------------<br><br>In building his system, Marchettus (like Vicentino 230 years later)<br>uses both traditional integer ratios and a pragmatic division of the<br>tone into a small number of equal parts, whether we read this system<br>to be based on 1/5-tone or 1/9-tone.<br><br>This system, interestingly, appears to fit and indeed to accentuate<br>the aesthetic qualities of Gothic intervals and cadential progressions<br>as presented in actual compositions of the time as well as in the<br>writings of more orthodox Pythagorean theorists. Active major thirds<br>and sixths become yet more active in cadences arranged with the<br>supernarrow Marchettan leading-tones, and the release of their tension<br>in expansion to the stable fifth and octave becomes yet more efficient<br>and dramatic.<br><br>Thus the musical feeling of 13th-14th century Continental European<br>polyphony, while nicely agreeing with the mathematics of the<br>Pythagorean system, may be expressed through other schemes including<br>53-tet and the system of Marchettus (just possibly close<br>equivalents).<br><br>As art changes, the same basic mathematical scheme may also be<br>modified to serve new aesthetic requirements. Thus the division of the<br>tone into portions of 4/9-tone and 5/9-tone is a quite practical model<br>for either Gothic or Renaissance polyphony -- but with the normal<br>diatonic semitone shifting from the smaller to the larger portion as<br>vertical thirds and sixths become smoother, and leading-tones<br>consequently become wider (at or near 16:15).<br><br>Whether or not the "superwide" cadential major thirds and sixths which<br>Marchettus seems to favor actually approximated "7-limit" values,<br>considering this possibility may direct our attention to some of the<br>qualities of the Gothic harmonic aesthetic also nicely (albeit less<br>drastically) expressed by the usual Pythagorean values. The<br>exploration of the artistic territory sketched out by Marchettus --<br>however uncertain the interpretation of his division of the tone -- is<br>one of the main themes of neo-Gothic and Xeno-Gothic music.<br><br>                 <br>                      -----------------------------<br>                                 Notes<br>                      -----------------------------<br><br>1.

This could be taken as a division actually<br>based on _1/9-tones_, very close as it happens to the ~22.64-cent<br>steps of 53-tone equal temperament (53-tet):<br><br>First reading (5 equal parts):     1/5    1/5    1/5    1/5     1/5<br>Second reading (5 unequal parts):  1/9  2/9     2/9     2/9    2/9    <br><br>David Lenson, in a study of 14th-century manuscript accidentals and<br>intonations available on the World Wide Web[3], favors this<br>interpretation.<br><br>As the more mathematically orthodox Prosdocimus will emphatically<br>assert a century later (1413, 1425), such even divisions of a ratio<br>such as 9:8 are _in no way_ possible using the integer mathematics of<br>Pythagorean just intonation -- or other integer ratio systems, one<br>might add. Rather, such divisions seem akin to the tradition of<br>Aristoxenos, who pragmatically recognized intervals such as<br>1/6-octaves although they cannot be expressed as integer ratios..<br><br>As flexible in his terminology as in his arithmetic, Marchettus<br>borrowed the names of the three Greek genera to describe three kinds<br>of semitones resulting from his division of the tone.<br><br>An _enharmonic_ semitone, corresponding with the usual Pythagorean<br>diatonic semitone found at mi-fa (e.g. e-f), has "two parts" out of<br>the five. In the 1/5-tone reading, this normal semitone would be equal<br>to 2/5-tone or ~81.56 cents; in the 1/9-tone reading, it might be<br>equal to two "parts" of 2/9-tone each, thus yielding a 4/9-tone<br>interval (~90.63 cents) virtually identical to the usual Pythagorean<br>limma of ~90.22 cents).<br><br>A _diatonic_ semitone, corresponding to the chromatic Pythagorean<br>semitone, has "three parts." If these parts are equal 1/5-tones, then<br>this semitone would be 3/5-tone or ~122.35 cents; in the 1/9-tone<br>reading, if we take these three parts as 1/9-tone, 2/9-tone, 2/9-tone,<br>then a 5/9-tone interval of ~113.28 cents, almost identical to the<br>Pythagorean apotome, results.<br><br>A _chromatic_ semitone, by which Marchettus prescribes a note should<br>be inflected before a cadence (e.g. amount by which cadential g# is<br>raised from g), has "four parts" out of five. In the 1/5-tone reading,<br>this means an interval of 4/5-tone or ~163.13 cents, leaving a<br>cadential leading-tone (e.g. g#-a) of only 1/5-tone or ~40.78 cents.<br>In the 1/9-tone reading, if we take one of the "four parts" as the<br>1/9-tone portion (2/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9), we get an interval of<br>7/9-tone or ~158.60 cents, leaving a leading-tone of 2/9-tone or<br>~45.31 cents.<br><br>Even in the latter reading, this scheme if taken literally results in<br>cadential semitones of only about 45 cents, and cadential major thirds<br>and sixths of about 453 cents and 951 cents respectively -- about<br>midway between a Pythagorean M3 and fourth, or M6 and m7!<br><br>While we have no way of being sure that such an intonation was not at<br>times used, one tempting interpretation is that Marchettus was<br>providing an easy-to-remember scheme for singers rather than an exact<br>mathematical formula. If we take his "enharmonic" and "diatonic"  <br>semitones as essentially equivalent to the Pythagorean limma and<br>apotome, then his narrow cadential leading-tone might be somewhat<br>narrower than the usual 90-cent limma but not quite so narrow as<br>1/5-tone or 2/9-tone.<br><br><br>----------------------------<br>2. A "quasi-7-limit" reading<br>----------------------------<br><br>By following the 1/9-tone reading of Marchettus's "five part" division<br>of the tone -- but defining the parts as 3/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 3/9 -- we<br>can arrive at an interesting result where cadential semitones are<br>equal to about 1/3-tone, and major thirds and sixth to ratios not far<br>from 9:7 and 12:7.<br><br>Thus our new "fivefold division" of the tone would be<br><br>"Parts":             1       2       3        4                5<br>           3/9       |  1/9  |  1/9  |  1/9   |      3/9       |<br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br>cents:   (Pyth)     67      90      114      137              204<br>         (53-tet)   68      91      113      136              204<br><br>----------------------<br>   3/9 = cadential (limma - comma)<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Topic No. 11<br>   4/9 = limma (mi-fa)<br><br>--------------------------------------<br>   5/9 = apotome (e.g. c-c#)<br><br>-----------------------------------------------<br>   6/9 = superapotome (e.g. c-c# in c-c#-d)<br><br>In this scheme, we get regular diatonic and chromatic semitones of<br>4/9-tone and 5/9-tone, almost identical either to the usual<br>Pythagorean limma and apotome, or to 53-tet semitones of 4/53 octave<br>and 5/53 octave. Additionally, we get a "supercompact" cadential<br>semitone of 3/9-tone, equivalent either to a limma minus a Pythagorean<br>comma or to 3/53 octave.<br><br>Let us see how the standard two-voice progressions discussed by<br>Marchettus and illustrated in his musical examples look when we apply<br>our leading-tone of 3/9-tone: <br><br>  e  --  -204 -- d        g# --  +67 -- a       f#' --  +67 -- g'  <br> (271)          (0)     (431)         (702)   (929)          (1200)<br>  c# --   +67 -- d        e  -- -204 -- d       a   -- -204 -- g<br>  <br>  m3      -      1        M3      -     5       M6       -     8<br><br>Here we arrive at a minor third of ~271 cents, close to 7:6; a major<br>third of ~431 cents, close to 9:7; and a major sixth of ~929 cents,<br>close to 12:7. These intervals, about a Pythagorean comma or 1/9-tone<br>closer to their stable goals than even the usual Pythagorean<br>intervals, seem to fit Marchettus's accentuated version of usual<br>14th-century cadential aesthetics.<br><br>In practice, of course, singers and players of non-fixed-pitch<br>instruments would doubtless vary in their cadential intonations. From<br>a xenharmonic perspective, here are some tunings suggesting the range<br>of possibilities:<br><br>                cadential m2   m3 (to 1)    M3 (to 5)   M6 (to 8)<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Pyth +/- comma     66.76        270.67       431.28       929.33<br>                limma-comma  32:27-comma  81:64+comma  27:16+comma<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>7-limit            62.96        266.87       435.08       933.13<br>                   28:27          7:6          9:7         12:7<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>53-tet             67.92        271.70       430.19       928.30<br>                 3/53 oct      12/53 oct    19/53 oct    41/53 oct<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>17-tet             70.59        282.35       423.53       917.64<br>                 1/17 oct      4/17 oct     6/17 oct     13/17 oct<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>These are only some convenient landmarks on the xenharmonic continuum;<br>for example, a more subtle stretching of a Pythagorean major third<br>cadencing to a fifth might result in an interval mentioned by Charlie<br>Jordon in Tuning Digest 1577 -- 14:11 (~417.51 cents), about 10 cents<br>wider than a usual 81:64 (~407.82 cents).<br><br><br>--------------------------------------<br>3. Marchettus as a Gothic Aristoxenian <br>--------------------------------------<br><br>In building his system, Marchettus (like Vicentino 230 years later)<br>uses both traditional integer ratios and a pragmatic division of the<br>tone into a small number of equal parts, whether we read this system<br>to be based on 1/5-tone or 1/9-tone.<br><br>This system, interestingly, appears to fit and indeed to accentuate<br>the aesthetic qualities of Gothic intervals and cadential progressions<br>as presented in actual compositions of the time as well as in the<br>writings of more orthodox Pythagorean theorists. Active major thirds<br>and sixths become yet more active in cadences arranged with the<br>supernarrow Marchettan leading-tones, and the release of their tension<br>in expansion to the stable fifth and octave becomes yet more efficient<br>and dramatic.<br><br>Thus the musical feeling of 13th-14th century Continental European<br>polyphony, while nicely agreeing with the mathematics of the<br>Pythagorean system, may be expressed through other schemes including<br>53-tet and the system of Marchettus (just possibly close<br>equivalents).<br><br>As art changes, the same basic mathematical scheme may also be<br>modified to serve new aesthetic requirements. Thus the division of the<br>tone into portions of 4/9-tone and 5/9-tone is a quite practical model<br>for either Gothic or Renaissance polyphony -- but with the normal<br>diatonic semitone shifting from the smaller to the larger portion as<br>vertical thirds and sixths become smoother, and leading-tones<br>consequently become wider (at or near 16:15).<br><br>Whether or not the "superwide" cadential major thirds and sixths which<br>Marchettus seems to favor actually approximated "7-limit" values,<br>considering this possibility may direct our attention to some of the<br>qualities of the Gothic harmonic aesthetic also nicely (albeit less<br>drastically) expressed by the usual Pythagorean values. The<br>exploration of the artistic territory sketched out by Marchettus --<br>however uncertain the interpretation of his division of the tone -- is<br>one of the main themes of neo-Gothic and Xeno-Gothic music.<br><br>                 <br>                      -----------------------------<br>                                 Notes<br>                      -----------------------------<br><br>1.
