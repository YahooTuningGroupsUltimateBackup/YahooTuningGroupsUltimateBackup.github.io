It<br>is the Borg (a beautiful analogy that is used in the most recent Star Trek<br>movie). The Borg I feel represents the Western trend to define reality<br>objectively but it goes to such an extreme that the Borg is unaware of how<br>ugly it truly has become. The  American phenomenon is the best example of<br>this I can think of . Here in America, many feel it is their duty to spread<br>the American<br>lifestyle to rest of the world "for the rest of world's own good."   This is<br>because<br>many feel that our time saving, free and just democratic society that cures<br>diseases and allows people the ability to become vapid consumers is good for<br>the rest o' the world. This is the possible danger when the search for<br>truth/God, etc. becomes a quest for perfection and then, once perfection<br>is found, it becomes domination for "other less intelligent people's own<br>good."<br>Another possible extreme of truth seeking is the actionless doubter who is<br>stranded in rational thought (this is what is I see here on the list at<br>times). The doubter believes that to question knowledege is one of the<br>highest virtues. He (or she) constructs philosophical/mathematical houses<br>of cards and blows them over every once in a while. Eventually despair<br>sets in since it seems there is no point in anything since anything<br>created will eventually be destroyed. (I have seen this abyss one too many<br>times in my life). This abyss is probably skirted by those who search for the<br>"ultimate math" or the "ultimate musical scale(s)."  I feel that this is<br>the danger of extreme mentalism where all reality is filtered through<br>reason and then eventually discared for one reason or another. I feel that<br>it is because of these tendencies to go the extremes of rationalism<br>(i.e. the scientific method) that modernity has lost it's connection to<br>the spirituality of life itself.
