For the enharmonic, this procedure results <br>in 120 117 114 90 and 114/90 is 19/15. In the case of the chromatic,<br>120 114 108 90, and  108/90 is 6/5. His diatonic is the old Sumero-<br>Babylonian "Pythagorean" tuning.<br><br>I think E chose 120 for the open string because astronomers were <br>used to using base-60 notation (actually a form of decimally-coded <br>sexagesimal). Ptolemy's string lengths are all in base-60 as it would <br>have been the most familiar notation for expressing fractions,<br>which are cumbersome in the Greek and Roman numeral systems. <br><br>As for computing Aristo's parts as 30th roots of 4/3, I agree that<br>it would be difficult to extract the 5th root of 4/3 and I think<br>you may have the solution to why no known Greek theorist recorded<br>A's genera in ET. Still, use might have been made of the Mesolabium, <br>an instrument invented by Eratosthenes himself (Heath) (or Archimedes,<br>elsewhere) for just this type of problem. After the 5th roots were<br>approximated, it would have been relatively easy to compute the square <br>and cube roots of the segments.<br><br>Barbera also thinks that Aristoxenos meant 4/3 for the tetrachord <br>span and listed the roots for Aristo's main genera. However, if one <br>simply tries to approximate the divisions, it is possible to do so <br>with just square roots. The enharmonic may be described as two<br>successive intervals of the square root of 256/243 followed by a ditone<br>of 81/64 and the Intense chromatic as two square roots of 9/8 and 32/27.<br><br>One further thought, I am inclined to agree with you about Ptolemy<br>having observed 1:2 divisions in practice. His enharmonic still looks<br>artificial to me, mostly because the enharmonic was supposed to be<br>extinct in practice by his time. I suspect it was supplied by analogy<br>with the Soft Chromatic, which greatly resembles Archytas's chromatic, <br>and the Soft Diatonic and Intense Chromatic, both of which may be <br>descended from Aristoxenos's Soft Diatonic (100 150 250 cents) versus <br>22/21 x 12/11 x 7/6 (81 151 267) and 21/20 x 10/9 x 8/7 (85 182 231).<br>(I believe Winnington-Ingram had similar thoughts, but I don't have<br>his paper on Aristoxenos and musical intervals at hand). In 500 years<br>musical taste could have changed sufficiently that the 1:2 pyknon was<br>to be prefered in the non-diatonic genera (the stereotype soft diatonic<br>is just on the border between Chromatic and diatonic and sounds chromatic <br>to me most of the time).<br><br>Polychronios: Thanks for the source of the 68-tet division formerly<br>used in the Greek Orthodox liturgical music.

This follows from several reasonings.<br><br>I should probably mention that I have no vested interest in promoting <br>well-tempered systems over ET for music of this period (nor vice <br>versa), so I'll accept whatever arguments seem most convincing for the <br>dating of ET's emergence as a universally employed keyboard <br>temperament. (Since I haven't carried out any independent research in <br>this area, I'd prefer if someone else took over the discussion.)<br><br>>    I would agree that the Kirnberger II was not so popular. It would <br>> seem that Kirnberger's temperament was touted mainly by his <br>> personal supporters, and their agenda is suspect, (it was not that<br>> smooth of a temperament). To some extent, I believe McGeary<br>> has drawn his sights on a "straw man".<br><br>Kirnberger II is cruder (in construction and aesthetic effect) than <br>many other well-tempered schemes, so I would certainly agree that the <br>surprising degree of support it seemed to have gained in contemporary <br>treatises is suspect. Your comment about McGeary attacking a straw man <br>isn't quite fair though: McGeary's article is based on a survey of <br>contemporary keyboard treatises and related literature; most of these <br>writers endorse ET as a keyboard standard, but a substantial minority <br>mention Kirberger II. McGeary thus set himself the task of showing how <br>this was not such strong evidence in favour of K II's practical <br>popularity as it might seem -- indeed, far from it. If the treatises <br>McGeary examined had also included a wealth of material on other <br>well-tempered systems, then his focussing on K II would have been an <br>attack on a straw man; but on other well-tempered systems there is a <br>general silence among McGeary's sources, so I can't see that your <br>charge stands. You could of course argue that McGeary's sources might <br>have represented an ET vanguard, and that ordinary musicians (i.e. of <br>the kind which doesn't compile treatises) remained content with the <br>resources of their preferred well-tempered systems. This might well be <br>so, but the trouble is precisely that no written evidence was left by <br>such musicians, so McGeary has all the advantage here. Or do you have <br>any hard, historical evidence to counter his claims?<br> <br>> >From Jorgenson's research,  I offer the following quotes from <br>> Johann Joseph Loehr's book,> Uber die Scheibler'sche Erfindung <br>> uberhaupt und dessen Pianoforte-und Orgel-Stimmung insbesondere<<br>> <br>> "There never was a man capable of tuning  by a ear a pianoforte or <br>> an organ so as not to leave some inequality of temperament, and <br>> there never will be" and " {Equal Temperament} hitherto has not<br>> been possible....Before Mr. Scheibler's invention no<br>> such means existed by which even a tolerable<br>> equality of temperament could be obtained" [1836]<br><br>There is a logical problem here, which would seem to undermine its <br>usefulness for your argument: namely, we can always choose a margin <br>of error small enough to wrong-foot the best tuner, and if we set the <br>margin at 0, then of course no-one can tune flawless ET. But then <br>no-one can tune flawlessly according to any given well-tempered <br>system, or any given meantone system, or any tuning system whatsoever. <br>The argument above would thus appear to be quite empty. What you would <br>have to find is not evidence to show that ET was not achieved to <br>perfection, but rather that musicians/tuners were not _aiming_ for the <br>equality of all keys, but continued, rather, to favour some over <br>others. In other words, you will need to find contemporary evidence <br>not for inequality of results, but inequality of _intention_.<br> <br>> Again, according to Jorgenson, in 1850, ( I think),  A.J. Hipkins <br>> stated that the best tuners at the Broadwood factory "didn't tune l<br>> anything like equal temperament"<br><br>Same again (and I'll assume you aren't using documentation of English <br>practices to make any point concerning German practices at this time <br>or earlier). Was it simply that the Broadwood tuners were aiming at, <br>but not achieving equality, or were they deliberately retaining a <br>well-tempered scheme (or schemes)? Random inequalities don't count; <br>the required inequalities would tend towards 1/4-comma meantone at the <br>"white-keys" side of the "circle of fifths", and towards Pythagorean <br>at the other end (you would agree with this, I trust as a fair summary <br>of the general tendencies of well-tempered systems?).<br><br><br>> > ... in Germany during the second half of the 18th is because <br>> >piano tuning had largely become a task of professionals by the time <br>> >of theFrench/English changes, whereas many or most players were <br>> >capable of tuning their own pianos at the time the changes occured <br>> >in Germany. Am I right?<br>> <br>>   Yes, but that doesn't mean that they were using ET, which is <br>> about the most difficult temperament to tune. There were much easier <br>> ways to tune a non-restrictive temperament.<br><br>That wasn't my point. I was saying that I thought this was why we <br>should have evidence from professionals in the piano industry <br>concerning the changeover to ET in England and France, whereas our <br>evidence concerning Germany/Austria is less direct, and gives us only <br>a vague idea of dates. This _wasn't_ being offered as an argument to <br>establish the case that the Germans adopted ET earlier -- it was only <br>an auxiliary point.<br><br>>   There is no evidence that there was knowledge of test intervals <br>> in the 1700's.  Without the normal tests for interval width,  I <br>> would not be able to tune an acceptable ET today, and I have been <br>> tuning ET for the last 20 years at recording and broadcast n<br>> standards.<br><br>Doesn't the very name *gleichschwebende* suggest how they approached <br>the practicalities of tuning ET? I doubt, of course that they would <br>have achieved anything approaching the "recording and broadcast <br>standards" of the past twenty years, but as I have said, the random <br>inequalities resulting from tuning methods designed to achieve <br>something like ET will not serve your argument; only the intended <br>inequalities of well-temperament will do this.<br><br>> I don't think ET was possible, given the state of <br>> science in the 1700's.  ( Mersenne ratios didn't give much <br>> information that was of any use to piano tuning, did he?)<br><br>You could make much the same argument for meantone temperaments being <br>impossible in the 15th century, but we have corroborating evidence to <br>show that they did indeed employ such tunings then; the fact that no <br>adequate mathematical description of even 1/4-comma meantone appeared <br>until long after is irrelevant. Likewise, a knowledge of how to <br>extract the twelfth root of 2 (and the persistence to make the <br>burdensome calculations) didn't bother lute and viol players during <br>the following century: they were quite happy to use rational <br>approximations such as 18/17 for ET semitones, and relied upon natural <br>margins of error, and a little fudging to make (18/17)^12 arrive at <br>2/1. Something like ET was thus being practiced centuries earlier than <br>the time we are talking about (late 18th/early 19th centuries); the <br>reason why it wasn't adopted for keyboards at this stage was that <br>unlike lutes and viols, keyboard instruments were capable of tunings <br>which better suited musical needs: first the meantone systems, and <br>then the well-tempered. Even the fretted clavichord offered better <br>tuning possibilities than lutes or viols.<br><br>> >  Beethoven's well-known pronouncements on key<br>> > characteristics should not be taken to imply that he preferred <br>> >some variety of well-temperament, because he is also on record as <br>> >claiming that he could distinguish between C# major and Db major <br>> >(!), which, I need hardly say, is not a distinction that can be <br>> >made in any well-temperament.<br>> <br>> Hmmmm.  Is this a distinction that can be made in ET? I am not sure <br>> by what mechanism this last statement is supposed to support either<br>> direction.<br><br>I'm afraid you've missed my point entirely. I was saying that the  <br>pronouncements Beethoven made, well into his career, upon key <br>characteristics, might seem to indicate his continuing preference for <br>and use of well-temperament (for as long as he could hear any <br>difference). My point was that he also claimed to be able to <br>distinguish between Db and C# (and other such "enharmonic <br>equivalents") and this renders his other statements on key <br>characteristics useless as a supposed Beethovenian endorsement of <br>well-temperament. Of course the distinction can't be made in ET -- it <br>can't be made on any 12-notes per octave keyboard; this has nothing to <br>do with my point here. Whatever Beethoven's grounds for discerning key <br>characteristics might have been, they were more nebulous than the <br>intervallic patterns produced by well-temperaments (though as I said, <br>I don't doubt that well-temperament would have played a part in <br>suggesting such distinctions, alongside such matters as which keys <br>were most congenial for the various orchestral instruments, etc.).<br><br><br> <br>> >I would accept that Beethoven's notions concerning<br>> >key characteristics originated in part from the well-temperament <br>> >that he must have been familiar with in his youth, but if the <br>> >connection between the two had been of great importance to him, we <br>> >should expect him to have made statements on the lamentable erosion <br>> >of key characteristics through the adoption of equal temperament<br>> <br>>    This seems to beg the question.  If, in fact, there was no ET <br>> actually being tuned,  he would have made no statements about the<br>> erosion.<br><br>I'm not begging any questions because, as I thought I had made clear, <br>I was ASSUMING the consensus position, and contenting myself with <br>making various auxiliary points; I left it to McGeary to argue for the <br>main issue of when ET emerged in Germany/Austria. My discussion of <br>Beethoven was intended to make the point that _whatever was happening <br>tuning-wise in Germany/Austria_, these statements on key <br>characteristics will not serve to establish that Beethoven demanded <br>well-temperament for his pianos. This is a purely negative point: it <br>says nothing either way about which tuning he actually used. <br><br>>    These are all academic points,  There is very little hope of <br>> arriving at a definitive answer, However,   There is another <br>> compelling reason to doubt that Mozart and Beethoven composed their <br>> keyboard work on equally tempered pianos.<br>>    To investigate their music, one should play it in ET and well<br>> temperament, side by side, and compare.   I am presently working <br>> with several artists that are intimately familiar with this music.  <br>> When I introduced them to Well temperament, the one common response <br>> I got from them is that the music of the classical Germans makes a <br>> lot more sense when played in well temperament.<br><br>Look, lest we start arguing at cross-purposes, I think I should point <br>out that there are, as far as I'm concerned, two separate issues here. <br><br>1.  The first is the factual matter of what temperaments were actually <br>used at different times and places; insofar as we can arrive at any <br>conclusions on this, it will be on the basis of documentary sources. <br>On this issue, I am at present prepared to accept the view that ET had <br>become entrenched as a keyboard tuning in Germany/Austria by about <br>1800. If I ever encounter more powerful arguments to the contrary -- <br>again based on documentary evidence -- I shall change my views; but to <br>date I have not seen any such arguments. This has nothing to do with <br>any blind pro-ET bigotry; for instance, I do not doubt that, for <br>example, the "48" were intended for well-temperament and not for equal <br>temperament; because the evidence (including the title WTK!) clinches <br>the issue, I can afford to dismiss anyone who thinks otherwise as <br>simply ignorant of the relevant facts.<br><br>2. The second issue is that of our aesthetic preferences _today_ for <br>one tuning system over another for a given repertory. I am very glad <br>to hear of your work concerning the promotion of well-tempered systems <br>among professional pianists, and I wish you every success. However, <br>the fact that someone today, like yourself, is prepared to state a <br>preference for well-tempered Mozart or Beethoven neither establishes <br>any historical case, nor does such a preference require any historical <br>evidence to justify it. There are all sorts of ways we can devise to <br>refresh our perceptions of familiar repertoire -- and a change of <br>tuning is as good as any. Many of the performance practices labelled <br>as authentic have no historical basis; but this doesn't mean we should <br>abandon them (they may have succeeded in reawakening us to <br>over-familiar pieces) -- only that we should abandon the spurious <br>historical arguments we used to justify these performance practices.<br><br>Say we were to discover (not that I expect it) irrefutable evidence <br>that Beethoven (for as long as his hearing lasted) never encountered a <br>single well-tempered piano after 1800. What then? Should this stop us <br>from experimenting with well-temperaments in performances of his <br>post-1800 sonatas? Not in the least! If pianists need their confidence <br>bolstered by foundationless arguments, concerning the tunings <br>Beethoven would have heard, before they are prepared to try out a <br>well-tempered tuning, then I regret this. The only argument that <br>should be needed is that Beethoven would certainly have played on <br>well-tempered instruments at least in his youth, and that they are <br>certainly not blatantly inappropriate to his sonatas of the 1800s in <br>the way that, say, pelog and slendro tunings would. The performance of <br>the sonatas today in well-temperaments ought not to be made <br>conditional upon any historical proof that they actually _were_ ever <br>performed in well-temperaments; <br><br>In any case, Beethoven would have been used to hearing a variety of <br>tunings: well-temperament and ET on pianos, also probably 1/6-comma <br>meantone on organs; various efforts on strings running from <br>quasi-Pythagorean to 1/6-comma meantone, depending on the preferences <br>and proficiency of the players ... by the time we come to aging <br>cimbalom players in taverns, we should be able to accept that <br>Beethoven could not have fastened his designs upon any single tuning. <br>What of arrangements, such as that of the op.14/1 piano sonata for <br>string quartet? Would anyone suggest that Beethoven must have required <br>the quartet players to switch to well-temperament or ET? In any case, <br>orchestras are a graveyard for fine tuning sensibilities, and all the <br>more so in Beethoven's time. The musician in Beethoven's time could be <br>expected to display a tolerance for a variety of tuning systems, <br>reproduced with varying degrees of accuracy. Play Beethoven in a <br>well-temperament if you wish, but more importantly, play him well.<br><br>>  I prefer the Young or Prinz temperaments for the modern pianos, as <br>> the greatly increased overtones renders many of the other well temps <br>> to be harsh when more than three accidentals are involved.<br><br>Barbour says that Young's account of his No.1 includes a <br>miscalculation of Eb, which should form a true 4/3 with G#; do you <br>incorporate this correction?<br><br>> ... presently in the works is <br>> a CD of historical tunings on the modern concert grand. The record <br>> company has requested that I not divulge exactly what, yet, but this <br>> list will be the first place I will notify when given the go-ahead.<br><br>Ah, now this is interesting -- historical tunings divorced from <br>historical instruments.

I suspect it was supplied by analogy<br>with the Soft Chromatic, which greatly resembles Archytas's chromatic, <br>and the Soft Diatonic and Intense Chromatic, both of which may be <br>descended from Aristoxenos's Soft Diatonic (100 150 250 cents) versus <br>22/21 x 12/11 x 7/6 (81 151 267) and 21/20 x 10/9 x 8/7 (85 182 231).<br>(I believe Winnington-Ingram had similar thoughts, but I don't have<br>his paper on Aristoxenos and musical intervals at hand). In 500 years<br>musical taste could have changed sufficiently that the 1:2 pyknon was<br>to be prefered in the non-diatonic genera (the stereotype soft diatonic<br>is just on the border between Chromatic and diatonic and sounds chromatic <br>to me most of the time).<br><br>Polychronios: Thanks for the source of the 68-tet division formerly<br>used in the Greek Orthodox liturgical music.

This follows from several reasonings.<br><br>I should probably mention that I have no vested interest in promoting <br>well-tempered systems over ET for music of this period (nor vice <br>versa), so I'll accept whatever arguments seem most convincing for the <br>dating of ET's emergence as a universally employed keyboard <br>temperament. (Since I haven't carried out any independent research in <br>this area, I'd prefer if someone else took over the discussion.)<br><br>>    I would agree that the Kirnberger II was not so popular. It would <br>> seem that Kirnberger's temperament was touted mainly by his <br>> personal supporters, and their agenda is suspect, (it was not that<br>> smooth of a temperament). To some extent, I believe McGeary<br>> has drawn his sights on a "straw man".<br><br>Kirnberger II is cruder (in construction and aesthetic effect) than <br>many other well-tempered schemes, so I would certainly agree that the <br>surprising degree of support it seemed to have gained in contemporary <br>treatises is suspect. Your comment about McGeary attacking a straw man <br>isn't quite fair though: McGeary's article is based on a survey of <br>contemporary keyboard treatises and related literature; most of these <br>writers endorse ET as a keyboard standard, but a substantial minority <br>mention Kirberger II. McGeary thus set himself the task of showing how <br>this was not such strong evidence in favour of K II's practical <br>popularity as it might seem -- indeed, far from it. If the treatises <br>McGeary examined had also included a wealth of material on other <br>well-tempered systems, then his focussing on K II would have been an <br>attack on a straw man; but on other well-tempered systems there is a <br>general silence among McGeary's sources, so I can't see that your <br>charge stands. You could of course argue that McGeary's sources might <br>have represented an ET vanguard, and that ordinary musicians (i.e. of <br>the kind which doesn't compile treatises) remained content with the <br>resources of their preferred well-tempered systems. This might well be <br>so, but the trouble is precisely that no written evidence was left by <br>such musicians, so McGeary has all the advantage here. Or do you have <br>any hard, historical evidence to counter his claims?<br> <br>> >From Jorgenson's research,  I offer the following quotes from <br>> Johann Joseph Loehr's book,> Uber die Scheibler'sche Erfindung <br>> uberhaupt und dessen Pianoforte-und Orgel-Stimmung insbesondere<<br>> <br>> "There never was a man capable of tuning  by a ear a pianoforte or <br>> an organ so as not to leave some inequality of temperament, and <br>> there never will be" and " {Equal Temperament} hitherto has not<br>> been possible....Before Mr. Scheibler's invention no<br>> such means existed by which even a tolerable<br>> equality of temperament could be obtained" [1836]<br><br>There is a logical problem here, which would seem to undermine its <br>usefulness for your argument: namely, we can always choose a margin <br>of error small enough to wrong-foot the best tuner, and if we set the <br>margin at 0, then of course no-one can tune flawless ET. But then <br>no-one can tune flawlessly according to any given well-tempered <br>system, or any given meantone system, or any tuning system whatsoever. <br>The argument above would thus appear to be quite empty. What you would <br>have to find is not evidence to show that ET was not achieved to <br>perfection, but rather that musicians/tuners were not _aiming_ for the <br>equality of all keys, but continued, rather, to favour some over <br>others. In other words, you will need to find contemporary evidence <br>not for inequality of results, but inequality of _intention_.<br> <br>> Again, according to Jorgenson, in 1850, ( I think),  A.J. Hipkins <br>> stated that the best tuners at the Broadwood factory "didn't tune l<br>> anything like equal temperament"<br><br>Same again (and I'll assume you aren't using documentation of English <br>practices to make any point concerning German practices at this time <br>or earlier). Was it simply that the Broadwood tuners were aiming at, <br>but not achieving equality, or were they deliberately retaining a <br>well-tempered scheme (or schemes)? Random inequalities don't count; <br>the required inequalities would tend towards 1/4-comma meantone at the <br>"white-keys" side of the "circle of fifths", and towards Pythagorean <br>at the other end (you would agree with this, I trust as a fair summary <br>of the general tendencies of well-tempered systems?).<br><br><br>> > ... in Germany during the second half of the 18th is because <br>> >piano tuning had largely become a task of professionals by the time <br>> >of theFrench/English changes, whereas many or most players were <br>> >capable of tuning their own pianos at the time the changes occured <br>> >in Germany. Am I right?<br>> <br>>   Yes, but that doesn't mean that they were using ET, which is <br>> about the most difficult temperament to tune. There were much easier <br>> ways to tune a non-restrictive temperament.<br><br>That wasn't my point. I was saying that I thought this was why we <br>should have evidence from professionals in the piano industry <br>concerning the changeover to ET in England and France, whereas our <br>evidence concerning Germany/Austria is less direct, and gives us only <br>a vague idea of dates. This _wasn't_ being offered as an argument to <br>establish the case that the Germans adopted ET earlier -- it was only <br>an auxiliary point.<br><br>>   There is no evidence that there was knowledge of test intervals <br>> in the 1700's.  Without the normal tests for interval width,  I <br>> would not be able to tune an acceptable ET today, and I have been <br>> tuning ET for the last 20 years at recording and broadcast n<br>> standards.<br><br>Doesn't the very name *gleichschwebende* suggest how they approached <br>the practicalities of tuning ET? I doubt, of course that they would <br>have achieved anything approaching the "recording and broadcast <br>standards" of the past twenty years, but as I have said, the random <br>inequalities resulting from tuning methods designed to achieve <br>something like ET will not serve your argument; only the intended <br>inequalities of well-temperament will do this.<br><br>> I don't think ET was possible, given the state of <br>> science in the 1700's.  ( Mersenne ratios didn't give much <br>> information that was of any use to piano tuning, did he?)<br><br>You could make much the same argument for meantone temperaments being <br>impossible in the 15th century, but we have corroborating evidence to <br>show that they did indeed employ such tunings then; the fact that no <br>adequate mathematical description of even 1/4-comma meantone appeared <br>until long after is irrelevant. Likewise, a knowledge of how to <br>extract the twelfth root of 2 (and the persistence to make the <br>burdensome calculations) didn't bother lute and viol players during <br>the following century: they were quite happy to use rational <br>approximations such as 18/17 for ET semitones, and relied upon natural <br>margins of error, and a little fudging to make (18/17)^12 arrive at <br>2/1. Something like ET was thus being practiced centuries earlier than <br>the time we are talking about (late 18th/early 19th centuries); the <br>reason why it wasn't adopted for keyboards at this stage was that <br>unlike lutes and viols, keyboard instruments were capable of tunings <br>which better suited musical needs: first the meantone systems, and <br>then the well-tempered. Even the fretted clavichord offered better <br>tuning possibilities than lutes or viols.<br><br>> >  Beethoven's well-known pronouncements on key<br>> > characteristics should not be taken to imply that he preferred <br>> >some variety of well-temperament, because he is also on record as <br>> >claiming that he could distinguish between C# major and Db major <br>> >(!), which, I need hardly say, is not a distinction that can be <br>> >made in any well-temperament.<br>> <br>> Hmmmm.  Is this a distinction that can be made in ET? I am not sure <br>> by what mechanism this last statement is supposed to support either<br>> direction.<br><br>I'm afraid you've missed my point entirely. I was saying that the  <br>pronouncements Beethoven made, well into his career, upon key <br>characteristics, might seem to indicate his continuing preference for <br>and use of well-temperament (for as long as he could hear any <br>difference). My point was that he also claimed to be able to <br>distinguish between Db and C# (and other such "enharmonic <br>equivalents") and this renders his other statements on key <br>characteristics useless as a supposed Beethovenian endorsement of <br>well-temperament. Of course the distinction can't be made in ET -- it <br>can't be made on any 12-notes per octave keyboard; this has nothing to <br>do with my point here. Whatever Beethoven's grounds for discerning key <br>characteristics might have been, they were more nebulous than the <br>intervallic patterns produced by well-temperaments (though as I said, <br>I don't doubt that well-temperament would have played a part in <br>suggesting such distinctions, alongside such matters as which keys <br>were most congenial for the various orchestral instruments, etc.).<br><br><br> <br>> >I would accept that Beethoven's notions concerning<br>> >key characteristics originated in part from the well-temperament <br>> >that he must have been familiar with in his youth, but if the <br>> >connection between the two had been of great importance to him, we <br>> >should expect him to have made statements on the lamentable erosion <br>> >of key characteristics through the adoption of equal temperament<br>> <br>>    This seems to beg the question.  If, in fact, there was no ET <br>> actually being tuned,  he would have made no statements about the<br>> erosion.<br><br>I'm not begging any questions because, as I thought I had made clear, <br>I was ASSUMING the consensus position, and contenting myself with <br>making various auxiliary points; I left it to McGeary to argue for the <br>main issue of when ET emerged in Germany/Austria. My discussion of <br>Beethoven was intended to make the point that _whatever was happening <br>tuning-wise in Germany/Austria_, these statements on key <br>characteristics will not serve to establish that Beethoven demanded <br>well-temperament for his pianos. This is a purely negative point: it <br>says nothing either way about which tuning he actually used. <br><br>>    These are all academic points,  There is very little hope of <br>> arriving at a definitive answer, However,   There is another <br>> compelling reason to doubt that Mozart and Beethoven composed their <br>> keyboard work on equally tempered pianos.<br>>    To investigate their music, one should play it in ET and well<br>> temperament, side by side, and compare.   I am presently working <br>> with several artists that are intimately familiar with this music.  <br>> When I introduced them to Well temperament, the one common response <br>> I got from them is that the music of the classical Germans makes a <br>> lot more sense when played in well temperament.<br><br>Look, lest we start arguing at cross-purposes, I think I should point <br>out that there are, as far as I'm concerned, two separate issues here. <br><br>1.  The first is the factual matter of what temperaments were actually <br>used at different times and places; insofar as we can arrive at any <br>conclusions on this, it will be on the basis of documentary sources. <br>On this issue, I am at present prepared to accept the view that ET had <br>become entrenched as a keyboard tuning in Germany/Austria by about <br>1800. If I ever encounter more powerful arguments to the contrary -- <br>again based on documentary evidence -- I shall change my views; but to <br>date I have not seen any such arguments. This has nothing to do with <br>any blind pro-ET bigotry; for instance, I do not doubt that, for <br>example, the "48" were intended for well-temperament and not for equal <br>temperament; because the evidence (including the title WTK!) clinches <br>the issue, I can afford to dismiss anyone who thinks otherwise as <br>simply ignorant of the relevant facts.<br><br>2. The second issue is that of our aesthetic preferences _today_ for <br>one tuning system over another for a given repertory. I am very glad <br>to hear of your work concerning the promotion of well-tempered systems <br>among professional pianists, and I wish you every success. However, <br>the fact that someone today, like yourself, is prepared to state a <br>preference for well-tempered Mozart or Beethoven neither establishes <br>any historical case, nor does such a preference require any historical <br>evidence to justify it. There are all sorts of ways we can devise to <br>refresh our perceptions of familiar repertoire -- and a change of <br>tuning is as good as any. Many of the performance practices labelled <br>as authentic have no historical basis; but this doesn't mean we should <br>abandon them (they may have succeeded in reawakening us to <br>over-familiar pieces) -- only that we should abandon the spurious <br>historical arguments we used to justify these performance practices.<br><br>Say we were to discover (not that I expect it) irrefutable evidence <br>that Beethoven (for as long as his hearing lasted) never encountered a <br>single well-tempered piano after 1800. What then? Should this stop us <br>from experimenting with well-temperaments in performances of his <br>post-1800 sonatas? Not in the least! If pianists need their confidence <br>bolstered by foundationless arguments, concerning the tunings <br>Beethoven would have heard, before they are prepared to try out a <br>well-tempered tuning, then I regret this. The only argument that <br>should be needed is that Beethoven would certainly have played on <br>well-tempered instruments at least in his youth, and that they are <br>certainly not blatantly inappropriate to his sonatas of the 1800s in <br>the way that, say, pelog and slendro tunings would. The performance of <br>the sonatas today in well-temperaments ought not to be made <br>conditional upon any historical proof that they actually _were_ ever <br>performed in well-temperaments; <br><br>In any case, Beethoven would have been used to hearing a variety of <br>tunings: well-temperament and ET on pianos, also probably 1/6-comma <br>meantone on organs; various efforts on strings running from <br>quasi-Pythagorean to 1/6-comma meantone, depending on the preferences <br>and proficiency of the players ... by the time we come to aging <br>cimbalom players in taverns, we should be able to accept that <br>Beethoven could not have fastened his designs upon any single tuning. <br>What of arrangements, such as that of the op.14/1 piano sonata for <br>string quartet? Would anyone suggest that Beethoven must have required <br>the quartet players to switch to well-temperament or ET? In any case, <br>orchestras are a graveyard for fine tuning sensibilities, and all the <br>more so in Beethoven's time. The musician in Beethoven's time could be <br>expected to display a tolerance for a variety of tuning systems, <br>reproduced with varying degrees of accuracy. Play Beethoven in a <br>well-temperament if you wish, but more importantly, play him well.<br><br>>  I prefer the Young or Prinz temperaments for the modern pianos, as <br>> the greatly increased overtones renders many of the other well temps <br>> to be harsh when more than three accidentals are involved.<br><br>Barbour says that Young's account of his No.1 includes a <br>miscalculation of Eb, which should form a true 4/3 with G#; do you <br>incorporate this correction?<br><br>> ... presently in the works is <br>> a CD of historical tunings on the modern concert grand.
