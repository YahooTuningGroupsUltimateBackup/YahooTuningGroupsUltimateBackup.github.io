But if we could somehow control for<br>the width of the interval, I claim that 5:3 should be considered more<br>consonant than 15:1.

Aside<br>from second inversions, traditional theory deems major and minor triads<br>to be consonant, while all inversions of the triads 1:3:15 and 1:5:15<br>are considered dissonant. A 2-d triangular lattice therefore seems a far<br>better fit to traditional theory than a 2-d rectangular lattice.<br><br>To address Graham's questions: One way of constructing a lattice with a<br>useful metric is to make the length of each interval, according to a<br>"city-block metric," a monotonic function of its (odd) limit. James<br>Tenney and Graham have both proposed using log(n) as the length of each<br>step along the axis representing the factor n. The problem I have with<br>that is that m/n and m*n will both have a metric of log(m)+log(n).<br>Following traditional theory, Partch, and my own ears, I think that for<br>any odd number n, the ratios n/m or m/n, where m is an odd number less<br>than n, and arbitrary powers of 2 are allowed, are more consonant that<br>ratios involving odd numbers larger than n. The idea of a lattice and an<br>associated metric is to make the distance associated with a consonant<br>interval shorter than that associated with a dissonant interval. One way<br>to make the lattice my beliefs is to use isosceles triangles; the base,<br>representing 3:1, is given length log(3), while the sides, representing<br>5:1 and 5:3, are both given length log(5). One could also envision using<br>scalene triangles and giving 5:3 a longer length than 5:1 if one felt<br>that 5:1 was more consonant than 5:3. One could even preserve the<br>appearance of the rectangular lattice and allow a "short-cut" diagonally<br>through the block for 5:3, but not for 15:1. Then the length of 5:3<br>would be sqrt(log(3)^2 + log(5)^2), but 15:1 would still be<br>log(3)+log(2). This sort of representation just barely works because<br>sqrt(log(3)^2 + log(5)^2)9487 and the smallest compound interval<br>length is log(9)1972.<br><br>In the 5-limit case, the plane is filled by triangles. The right-side-up<br>triangles are major triads, and the upside-down triangles are minor<br>triads. In the 7-limit case, space is filled by tetrahedra and<br>octahedra. The right-side-up tetrahedra are 7-o tetrads, the upside-down<br>tetrahedra are 7-u tetrads, and the octahedra are Wilson hexanies. In<br>general, a lattice of mutually prime axes will have the property that<br>space is filled by all possible CPSs where the set of factors is the set<br>of axes. One of each of these CPSs fit together like pieces of a puzzle<br>to form an Euler genus that uses each factor exactly once. Since the<br>Euler geni fill the space, so do the CPSs.<br><br>When the axes are not mutually prime, as is the case when 9-limit ratios<br>are considered consonant, things get a little stranger since the same<br>note may appear in more than one place in the lattice. The easiest way<br>around this is to use the prime lattice and introduce a lot of<br>"shortcuts" corresponding to 9-limit and other odd ratios, but that<br>destroys the CPS-filling-Euler-genera-filling-space picture. However,<br>the usual otonal and utonal hypertriangles, the most compact structures<br>in these lattices, will fail to be the only saturated consonant entities<br>if the axes are not prime, so the CPS picture is not so useful in those<br>cases anyway . . .<br><br>Marion, I am using geometrical pictures to express my thoughts and your<br>LCM idea, as Graham pointed out, is equivalent to a particular<br>geometrical picture as well, a rectangular one where 2 is a distinct<br>factor that has its own axis, and the log of the LCM is just the<br>distance (according to the city-block metric) between the two most<br>distant points in the chord. In other words, the LCM is a measure of the<br>longest extent of the ROHS of a chord. Since I feel that a minor triad<br>is more consonant than a major seventh chord, I don't like this method<br>and would prefer instead to use the triangular lattice.
