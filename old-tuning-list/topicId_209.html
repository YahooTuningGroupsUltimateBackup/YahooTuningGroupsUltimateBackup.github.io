I have<br>heard plenty of music in non 12 tunings since I got involved 6 years<br>ago, but, and I say this sadly, I have heard very little GREAT music in<br>non 12. I think the art of composition is the highest pinnacle of a<br>musicians gift, and it seems to be mighty hard to come by.

In<br>fact, I daresay that it has been a lack of great pieces that has helped<br>contribute to the lack of acceptance by "ordinary" folks of "microtonal"<br>music. A lot of the music I've heard is rather cold and academic, remote<br>from humanity (Partch for sure), and just generally not the kind of<br>music that will MOVE someone deep in their spirit. Yes, the intellectual<br>part is fun and challenging, but it does not always translate into great<br>art.<br>    I am afraid, at times, that the intellectual theory of non 12 music<br>takes precedence over the making of great music...perhaps when that<br>changes, non 12 music will find a place in people's hearts, which is<br>where all great art eventually winds up...Hstick<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 2 Dec 1995 21:17 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA21697; Sat, 2 Dec 1995 11:17:15 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 2 Dec 1995 11:17:15 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199512021916.AA28049@mp.cs.niu.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>more Bach</h1><h3><a id=2353 href="#2353">ðŸ”—</a>neil.haverstick@csst.com (Neil Haverstick)</h3><span>12/2/1995 8:44:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Haverstick here...since all of the Bach discussions, I have been<br>listening to a lot of Bach's music, and as always, I come away<br>astounded.
