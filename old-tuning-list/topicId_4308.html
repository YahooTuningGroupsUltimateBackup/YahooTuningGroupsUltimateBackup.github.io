That's why I included this extra<br>description in every message, after ONElist's web instructions:<br><br>  You do not need web access to participate.  You may subscribe through<br>  email.  Send an empty email to one of these addresses:<br>    tuning-subscribe@onelist.com - subscribe to the tuning list.<br>    tuning-unsubscribe@onelist.com - unsubscribe from the tuning list.<br>    tuning-digest@onelist.com - switch your subscription to digest mode.<br>    tuning-normal@onelist.com - switch your subscription to normal mode.<br><br>That's all for now.  Go back to talking about tuning.  (Maybe I'll join in<br>on that again too, once the smoke settles.)
