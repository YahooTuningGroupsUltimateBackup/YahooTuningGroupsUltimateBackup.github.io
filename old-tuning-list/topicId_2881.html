[And<br>thanks for the music too, those few of you I have heard<br>in JIT recordings.]<br><br>That said, I have some comments regarding the recent<br>discussions with Gregg Gibson.<br><br>First, regarding the importance of the 55~60 cent melodic<br>identification concept. There have been maney good points made<br>about it, pointing out that larger values can also be ignored<br>(Bill Alves example of Happy Birthday in minor), smaller values<br>can be detected (88cet experiment showing contour or "aboveness"<br>and "belowness"), and I'll add my own experiment which is that,<br>at this time of year, I'll bet you many of the masses would<br>recognize "Jingle Bells" played by hitting two sticks together.<br><br>It seems that psychacoustically, the human listener is quite<br>willing and able to fix rather major tuning errors to "hear" a<br>melody properly.<br><br>However, the example of the high school band member playing<br>some notes thirty cents off shows that, despite his melody<br>being "recognizeable", when it is placed in a harmonic<br>context, these differences are very important.<br><br>That said, it seems that the differences that are important<br>harmonically are smaller than those in a melodic context. I<br>don't know the cent value or fraction of a tone, and, it is<br>sensitive to training and expectations as well.<br><br>Now to directly address some of Mr Gibson's comments.<br><br>><br>> On the list, I believe someone  by no means devoid of understanding <br>> said that "Gibson's preference for mean-tone temperaments is<br>> well-established" as if there are any others worth discussing (for<br>> long). Well, there is just intonation and Pythagoreanism, but they are<br>> not temperaments. There are 22- 29- 41- & 53-tone equal, but I do hope<br>> that by now I have explained why these 'temperaments' are valueless, for<br>> they cast out the consonant thirds from their tonal fabric as soon as<br>> one tries to preserve the consonant fifths.<br><br>I really don't understand this statement "cast out the consonant thirds".<br><br>	12TET  7  M4 ==  4 P5<br>	19TET  11 M4 ==  6 P5<br>	53TET  31 M4 == 17 P5<br><br>Is the "problem" that the 53TET (and others) has a choice of thirds to<br>use depending on context (in this run of 31 M4, we probably came close<br>to a variety of M4 that were diatonically correct to the original root,<br>if we built the equivalent of I, IV, V)?<br><br>Of course, this choice gives you lots of VERY consonant thirds, and,<br>using them when it is important harmonically (to fix audible beating)<br>does not mean we really care whether we hit them exactly melodically<br>(since we already have determined that melody can be a lot sloppier<br>than harmony).<br><br>> Finally, I wish to state again that the masses, although seemingly<br>> ignorant of and indifferent to tuning questions, are, like it or not,<br>> our masters. The most imperious dictator who ever lived, the haughtiest<br>> aristocrat who ever breathed, lives in nightmarish fear of popular<br>> ridicule. The people  our own, Western people especially  exert a<br>> potent influence, via popular melody and musical instrument makers (to<br>> name just two influences) on the choice of tuning, and on all music.<br>> Those who refuse to decide on a universal tuning, and consider the<br>> notion tyrannical, closed-minded, limiting, etc will merely have the<br>> choice of a universal tuning made _for_ them, most probably in favor of<br>> 12-tone equal, but one day, most probably, in favor of 19-tone equal.<br>> The latter should prima facie interest microtonalists more than the<br>> former.<br>><br><br>If one is going to advocate new tunings to the real<br>world, I am afraid that ANY tuning which cannot play with the<br>traditional instruments of the intended society in a manner<br>acceptable to that societies common practice will have a long<br>road to travel until adoption.<br><br>Since my intended society is "Western", a simple example is<br>instructive: "hey, lets try it up a half step".<br>A "new system of temperment" which has to retune the instrument<br>to meet this challenge won't make it in the "real world".<br><br>Similarly, there is a great deal of harmonically-oriented<br>music from the past two centuries which takes such advantage of<br>the capabilities of 12-tones per octave, that a real, viable new<br>tuning should be able to "add" to that body in a meaningful<br>manner, without asking the existing literature be changed.<br><br>This suggests a "new tuning" be a subdivisions of 12TET. I will go<br>ahead and choose some, given that I believe that the primary<br>deficiencies of 12TET are,<br>	1) bad major thirds<br>		(I don't mind 12TET minor thirds, probably<br>		because they are very close to 19:16...)<br>	2) important tones missing from the overtone series (bad<br>		approximations to 7's and 11's)<br><br>Improvements to the major third (vs 12TET) occur with 48, 60, and 72TET,<br>and for no subdivision before. This is ture for the minor third as well.<br>The 7:4 and 11:8 improve immediately even in quarter tones, but<br>"excellent 7's" occur with 36TET.<br><br>Ezra Simms is currently advocating 72TET (he approached it from a few<br>other directions) and has articles in Perspectives of New<br>Music (vol 29, their microtonal series) and Computer Music Journal<br>in recent years. As a REAL tuning system to advocate vs 12TET, this<br>one meets all the tests above.<br><br><br><br>..On the other hand, I'm not trying to change the "real world" to<br>use a "new tuning", but rather am interested in the sounds mentioned<br>above which are lacking in 12TET.<br><br>Regarding 19TET in particular, perhaps it is the last temperment which<br>preserves "sameness" of the "big" and "small" major seconds (9:8, 10:9).<br><br> 	major scale...<br><br>	12TET :  2 2 1 2 2 2 1<br>	19TET :	 3 3 2 3 3 3 2<br>	22TET :  4 3 2 4 3 4 2<br>	29TET :	 5 4 3 5 4 5 3<br>	41TET :	 7 6 4 7 6 7 4<br>	53TET :	 9 8 5 9 8 9 5<br><br>But... is that a good thing?

Well, there is just intonation and Pythagoreanism, but they are<br>> not temperaments. There are 22- 29- 41- & 53-tone equal, but I do hope<br>> that by now I have explained why these 'temperaments' are valueless, for<br>> they cast out the consonant thirds from their tonal fabric as soon as<br>> one tries to preserve the consonant fifths.<br><br>I really don't understand this statement "cast out the consonant thirds".<br><br>	12TET  7  M4 ==  4 P5<br>	19TET  11 M4 ==  6 P5<br>	53TET  31 M4 == 17 P5<br><br>Is the "problem" that the 53TET (and others) has a choice of thirds to<br>use depending on context (in this run of 31 M4, we probably came close<br>to a variety of M4 that were diatonically correct to the original root,<br>if we built the equivalent of I, IV, V)?<br><br>Of course, this choice gives you lots of VERY consonant thirds, and,<br>using them when it is important harmonically (to fix audible beating)<br>does not mean we really care whether we hit them exactly melodically<br>(since we already have determined that melody can be a lot sloppier<br>than harmony).<br><br>> Finally, I wish to state again that the masses, although seemingly<br>> ignorant of and indifferent to tuning questions, are, like it or not,<br>> our masters. The most imperious dictator who ever lived, the haughtiest<br>> aristocrat who ever breathed, lives in nightmarish fear of popular<br>> ridicule. The people  our own, Western people especially  exert a<br>> potent influence, via popular melody and musical instrument makers (to<br>> name just two influences) on the choice of tuning, and on all music.<br>> Those who refuse to decide on a universal tuning, and consider the<br>> notion tyrannical, closed-minded, limiting, etc will merely have the<br>> choice of a universal tuning made _for_ them, most probably in favor of<br>> 12-tone equal, but one day, most probably, in favor of 19-tone equal.<br>> The latter should prima facie interest microtonalists more than the<br>> former.<br>><br><br>If one is going to advocate new tunings to the real<br>world, I am afraid that ANY tuning which cannot play with the<br>traditional instruments of the intended society in a manner<br>acceptable to that societies common practice will have a long<br>road to travel until adoption.<br><br>Since my intended society is "Western", a simple example is<br>instructive: "hey, lets try it up a half step".<br>A "new system of temperment" which has to retune the instrument<br>to meet this challenge won't make it in the "real world".<br><br>Similarly, there is a great deal of harmonically-oriented<br>music from the past two centuries which takes such advantage of<br>the capabilities of 12-tones per octave, that a real, viable new<br>tuning should be able to "add" to that body in a meaningful<br>manner, without asking the existing literature be changed.<br><br>This suggests a "new tuning" be a subdivisions of 12TET.
