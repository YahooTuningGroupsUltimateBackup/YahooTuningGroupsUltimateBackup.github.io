It is true that other authorities give - very slightly -<br>unequal scales (Ellis, for example), and one, the quite untrustworthy<br>Westerner Danielou, constructs a highly unequal 22-tone<br>pseudo-pythagorean system, apparently out of thin air. Ravi Shankar, as<br>I recall, says he uses 22 pitches in the octave - I don't remember<br>whether equal, nearly equal, or unequal. Normally there would be no<br>melodic difference between using a slightly unequal and an equal<br>temperament, but since the tuning degree of 22-tone equal is at the edge<br>of the critical zone of 55-60 cents, it could possibly make some<br>difference in this case.<br><br>My own opinion, however, is that while the 22-tone equal does seem to<br>enjoy some instrumental use in India, the evidence - very scanty,<br>admittedly - supports 19-tone equal for Indian vocal music. So far as I<br>can determine - but I am no expert - Indian instrumentalists use a wide<br>variety of tunings, so if you are confused, join the club. The experts<br>seem to think that the Indians tried to use something very like 22-tone<br>equal in antiquity, but under Arab influence (ultimately Greek<br>influence?) gave it up in favor of pythagoreanism. The attitude of the<br>typical modern Westerner (at least until very recently) seems to be: why<br>don't those crazy Indians use God's gift to humanity, 12-tone equal<br>temperament... uhhh... they probably do... they just don't know it...<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Gregg Gibson <ggibson@ww-interlink.net><br>Subject:  Reply 2 to Graham Breed<br>PostedDate:  14-12-97 02:42:55<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  14-12-97 02:40:54-14-12-97 02:40:55,14-12-97 02:40:37-14-12-97 02:40:37<br>DeliveredDate:  14-12-97 02:40:37<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C125656D.00093B43; Sun, 14 Dec 1997 02:42:46 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14777; Sun, 14 Dec 1997 02:42:55 +0100<br>Date: Sun, 14 Dec 1997 02:42:55 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14774<br>Received: (qmail 29461 invoked from network); 13 Dec 1997 17:42:52 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 13 Dec 1997 17:42:52 -0800<br>Message-Id: <34939BE6.48CF@ww-interlink.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6655 href="#6655">ðŸ”—</a>Gregg Gibson &#x3C;ggibson@ww-interlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/1997 10:52:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Unequal tunings waste the melodic substance no less surely than equal<br>temperaments whose tuning degrees are either much narrower or much wider<br>than 60 cents or so.
