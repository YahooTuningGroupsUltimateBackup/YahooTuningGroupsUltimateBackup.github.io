I don't know<br>what tunings he used but I read in the booklet of the CD <br>	Spirit Festival with Lamentations & Village Burial with Fire<br>	Mode Records / New York<br>that he designed and built an instrument : the microxyl.<br><br>"The straight microxyls consist of 36 pieces of wooden dowel laid<br>over a resonating box - the total range of each microxyl is between <br>a 3/4 tone (150 cents) and a minor third (300 cents). Thus the interval<br>between the individual keys of each microxyl is between 4 and 8 cents. <br>The instrument is designed to be stroked, (not struck), and it's<br>resulting pitch-bending has the potential to be extremely expressive.<br>The idea behind this instrument was to represent the inner sadness <br>of the mourners. In contrast, the elliptical microxyl has a very<br>different, almost cosmic character -it has 45 keys whose individual <br>pitches from an elliptical curve, the intervals between 2 cents at the<br>bottom end and a perfect fourth at the top end.
