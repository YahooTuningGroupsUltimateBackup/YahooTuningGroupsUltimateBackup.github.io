Then, the<br>dimension of the vector space is the same as my definition of the<br>dimension of the scale.  I can talk about the "basic dimension of<br>the scale" if this will avoid confusion with other concepts of<br>scale dimension.  The logic being that the dimension is the<br>number of vectors that form a basis.<br><br>This works until transcendental numbers come into it.  Then, the<br>same basis can be defined using different primes:<br><br>     (x) (x/log(2) 0)(log(2)) (x/log(2) 0      )(log(2))<br>     (y)   (y/log(2) 0)(log(3))   (0        y/log(3)(log(3))<br><br>To avoid this ambiguity, the matrix defining a scale from its<br>basis must only contain integers -- or, at a stretch, rationals.<br>I think this covers all musically meaningful situations.  Any<br>counter examples?<br><br>Are people understanding this matrix stuff?  There was one<br>error a few posts back that John Chalmers spotted (I wrote a<br>chromatic semitone instead of a diesis) which may have<br>confused some of you.<br><br><br>A discussion on the interval 9/1 has resurfaced.  Partly, this<br>relates to scale dimensionality and partly to definitions of<br>consonances.  I will concentrate on the former.<br><br>To take Daniel Wolf's example:<br><br>>(1) I compose a piece consisting only of chromatically planed (parallel)<br>>Major ninth<br>>chords without fifths in just intonation. If the orchestration is such thlog(9) can be taken as a basis here.  It doesn't affect the<br>basic dimensionality.<br><br>and another:<br><br>>(4) Using a TX81Z (with a resolution of 1.56 cent deviations from 12tet),> I<br>>perform<br>>a melody based upon random walks over a lattice with two dimensions: 3s a>nd<br>>9s. The<br>>best approximation of 9 does not coincide with the best approximation of<br>>3^2. For all practical purposes, 3 and 9, in this temperament, are<br>>relatively prime.<br><br>3*3is a universal theorem.  If you are using an interval that<br>is not 2*log(3), that interval is not log(9).<br><br>The TX81Z uses 768TET tuning tables.  Any such table will be 1-D.<br>To what extent it approximates a higher dimensional scale is a<br>matter of interpretation.  In this case, though, I strongly<br>disagree with you.  On a TX81Z, 3/1 is 768*ln(3)/ln(2)17.2512<br>steps, approximated to 1217/768 oct.  9/1 is 768*ln(9)/ln(2)2434.5024.  The closest approximation is 2435/768 oct, but 3*3<br>gives 1217*2/768$34/768.  The latter is less accurate by<br>0.0024/768 oct 3.1 mu-oct (0.0038 c*nts) --  surely negligible<br>in comparison with the inaccuracy of both intervals.  I see no<br>problem in making the two consistent.<br><br>Daniel again:<br><br>>It>is interesting to hear how certain structures survive radically different>mappings intact as well as to hear what features are projected differentl>y<br>>under alternative intonations. Basic dimensionality is a precisely defined mathematical idea.<br>Music being a subjective thing, it makes more sense to define an<br>n-D scale in the abstract, and then approximate it for<br>performance, than to take a real life scale and try to assign a<br>dimension to it.<br><br>Paul Erlich wrote:<br><br>>Also, if 9/5 and 9/7 are to be used as distinctive harmonic entities (i.e.,<br>>consonances), and not only arising from 3*3/5 and 3*3/7, then it is useful to-<br><br>>include a 9-axis into the triangular lattice.<br><br>If the dissonance of a composite number is independent of its<br>factors, why use lattices at all?  If you do, though, this<br>would introduce a concept of harmonic dimensionality different<br>from scale dimensionality.  What I previously called "n-D<br>harmony" can be renamed "n-D JI" to avoid confusion here.<br><br>After introducing a term, I should define it.  A scale containing<br>only integer frequency ratios is a JI.  An n-D JI is then a JI<br>with a basic dimension of n.  This means a scale involving 11, but<br>not 7, is still a 4-D JI although it is not 7-limit, so the two<br>concepts are not equivalent.<br><br><br>On the concept of the prime limit: this is useful because it<br>states the resources available for scale construction.  Unlike<br>the Partch limit, 5 prime limit intervals can never take you out<br>of the 5 prime limit.  However, the prime limit is not a useful<br>measure of dissonance or even scale complexity.  Any interval can<br>be written as 3 prime limit, within the limits of human hearing.<br>It may be a very complex 3 prime limit interval, but it can<br>always be done.<br><br><br>On dissonance of composites in general:  it is much easier to form<br>consonant chords using composite numbers than prime numbers of<br>about the same size.  As an octave invariant example, 1:3:5:15<br>includes the interval 15/1.  Try finding an equally consonant 4<br>note octave invariant chord including 13/1.  If the consonance of<br>an interval reflects its propensity to form consonant chords, then<br>composites are more consonant than primes and, in some<br>circumstances, the metric should handicap high primes accordingly.<br>This brings us one step closer to octave invariance.<br><br>Paul also wrote:<br><br>>The assumption of exact octave equivalence, though it has some<br>>psychoacoustic basis, should be taken more as a conveniece than an exact<br>>truth.<br><br>Hey, he agrees with me!<br><br><br>An unrelated (or is it) point.
