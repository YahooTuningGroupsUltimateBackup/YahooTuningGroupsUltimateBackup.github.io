But perceptually, it is only<br>the simplest ratios which determine the character of an interval or<br>chord, even if the exact tuning is off by a sixth-tone or even a<br>third-tone. So the 3-(prime) limit description of the minor seventh<br>chord seems quite irrelevant despite its closeness, while the 5- and<br>7-(prime) limit descriptions both have some relevance, I feel, to the<br>way the 12-tET minor seventh chord is perceived, and the way it is often<br>performed on free-pitched instruments. In this context (namely, that of<br>describing individual sonorities), I believe the odd limit to be of more<br>utility. The odd limits of the aforementioned JI descriptions (whose<br>prime limits are 3, 5, and 7) are 81, 9, and 9, respectively. This gives<br>a much better idea as to the perceptual relevance of these descriptions<br>than the prime limit.</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>XH 17: Paul Erlich's response</h1><h3><a id=8426 href="#8426">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.
