In mathematics we have harmonic series as <br>contrasted with arithmetic series as well as geometric series. The harmonic<br>series is named after the musical harmonic series, since when looking at <br>the length of a string, or wavelength of the sound wave, or repetition time<br>of the waveform, the partials of a perfect string go as<br><br>1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/7, 1/8, 1/9, 1/10, . . .<br><br>So that is the harmonic series as known to mathematicians. This certainly <br>does not appear equally spaced in terms of human quantities like length and<br>time. So what is? What is the musical equivalent of the mathematical <br>arithmetic series<br><br>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10?<br><br>The answer: the subharmonic series! Subharmonics are integer multiples of <br>the string length, wavelength, or repetition time of the "fundamental." <br>(Note that I am not ascribing any musical significance to this fact).<br><br>Finally, consider the geometric series<br><br> . .x^-9, x^-8, x^-7, x^-6, x^-5, x^-4, x^-3, x^-2, x^-1, x, x^2, x^3, <br>x^4, x^5, x^6, x^7, x^8, x^9, . . .<br><br>where x>0 and x does not equal 1. Whether the units of measurement are <br>string length or wavelength or time period, as above, or frequency, as in <br>the 800:900:1000 Hz example, the result is the same: equal temperament! <br>Conversely, if you take the log of the above series, you get the integers, <br>so you can see that an equal temperament is equally spaced in log-frequency<br>or even log-length or log-time space.<br><br>Anyhow, it appears that from a physical point of view, the subharmonic <br>series is what most people would describe as "equally spaced," while <br>psychologically, since we hear pitch in log-frequency space, an equal <br>temperament is the tuning most likely to be heard as equally spaced.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 20 May 1997 16:04 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06132; Tue, 20 May 1997 16:04:27 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 20 May 1997 16:04:27 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06133<br>Received: (qmail 394 invoked from network); 20 May 1997 14:04:21 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 20 May 1997 14:04:21 -0000<br>Message-Id: <97051923410702/0005695065PK2EM@mcimail.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5534 href="#5534">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>5/23/1997 2:11:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>I'd also like to personally thank Neil Haverstick, Johnny Reinhard,<br>>Gary Morrison and Brian McLaren,<br><br>   Most welcome, sir!
