It doesn't apply, therefore, to higher<br>prime limits where the otonal matrix needn't be binary.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 26 Jun 1997 23:06 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA27907; Thu, 26 Jun 1997 23:06:54 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 26 Jun 1997 23:06:54 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA21122<br>Received: (qmail 13453 invoked from network); 26 Jun 1997 21:01:46 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 26 Jun 1997 21:01:46 -0000<br>Message-Id: <33B24B18@fsdsmtpgw.fsd.jhuapl.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5708 href="#5708">ðŸ”—</a>gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)</h3><span>6/29/1997 9:34:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Thanks, Paul, for thanking me for my proof from before.  It's<br>nice to know my work's being appreciated.  It's possible that<br>this message will arrive before the other one I'm sending<br>today.  Read that one first, or this one will make even less<br>sense!<br><br>The chords under discussion are: 12:15:18:20 and 14:18:21:24.<br>In otonal, non-reduced matrix form, these are:<br><br>        (2 0 1 0)          (3 1 0 0)<br>        (1 2 0 0)          (0 1 0 1)<br>        (0 1 1 0)H   and   (1 2 0 0)H<br>        (2 1 0 0)          (1 0 0 1)<br><br>They occupy the ROHSs (2 2 1 0)H and (3 2 0 1)H respectively.<br>The latter chord, which is the larger odd-limit chord, also<br>occupies the ROHS corresponding to the larger LCM.  It doesn't<br>matter what the LCMs are: just note that 2*7<5.  Neither is<br>a complete filling of the LCM, though, as neither contains<br>the root.  This is, incidentally, a criterion for the maximum<br>limit of the intervals being less than the limit of the<br>chord.<br><br>The next step is to look at the octave-reduced otonal<br>versions of the chords.  They are:<br><br>        (-3 1 1 0)         (-4 1 0 1)<br>        (-3 2 0 0)         (-3 2 0 0)<br>        (-2 0 1 0)H   and  (-2 0 0 1)H<br>        (-1 1 0 0)         (-1 1 0 0)<br><br>The two chords look very similar in this form.  Are they<br>complete?  The first is clearly a subset of the (x 2 1)H<br>otonality, or the Euler genus 3.3.5.  Here it is complete:<br><br>                    (-5 2 1)<br>                    (-3 1 1)<br>                    (-3 2 0)<br>                    (-2 0 1)H<br>                    (-1 1 0)                 <br>                    ( 0 0 0)<br><br>The chord being considered is a section of this, and<br>therefore a complete octave reduced (2 2 1)H chord, although<br>not the utonal or otonal one.<br><br>The octave reduced genus 3.3.7 is:<br><br>                   (-5 2 0 1)<br>                   (-4 1 0 1)<br>                   (-3 2 0 0)<br>                   (-2 0 0 1)H<br>                   (-1 1 0 0)                 <br>                   ( 0 0 0 0)<br><br>It can now be seen that the second chord is the complete<br>octave reduced (3 2 0 1)H chord above the root (-1 1 0 0)H.<br><br>I don't know the significance of all this.  I worked out<br>most of it as I was writing.  It does look interesting,<br>though.  I think the reason that both chords are above the<br>root (-1 1 0 0)H, or 3/2, is something to do with the<br>compositeness of 9. <br><br>                       Graham<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 29 Jun 1997 20:13 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA03959; Sun, 29 Jun 1997 20:13:28 +0200<br>Date: Sun, 29 Jun 1997 20:13:28 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA03954<br>Received: (qmail 4590 invoked from network); 29 Jun 1997 18:13:16 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 29 Jun 1997 18:13:16 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01541103afdca7a46951@DialupEudora><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5732 href="#5732">ðŸ”—</a>gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)</h3><span>7/2/1997 11:28:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I've got this almost completely sorted out now, and I don't even<br>need matrices to explain it.
