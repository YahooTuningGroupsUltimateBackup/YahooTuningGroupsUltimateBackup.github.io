I saw a question regarding the status of<br>McClain's work among people in the list. I have not studied all of his<br>work. All I can say is that in _The Pythagorean Plato_ he supplies the<br>only interpretation of certain numerological remarks by Plato, of which<br>I know of no other interpretation. I would not venture an opinion on<br>his interpretations in the other book that you mentioned, because I<br>totally lack the scholarship, as well as the interest. WRT his<br>reconstruction of Pythagorean-Platonic numeromusicology: suppose we<br>accept it; then the question would become what is the standing of<br>Pythagoras and Plato among the members of the list. I keep my distance<br>from Plato; he disparages tuning experiments and he says that imagined<br>music is better than music in reality. But I think that Pythagoras was<br>more open minded than his followers.<br><br>- George Kahrimanis, Queens, NY<br><br>______________________________________________________<br>Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com<br><br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Fred_Kohler@bc.sympatico.ca<br>Subject:  Re: TUNING digest 1140<br>PostedDate:  28-07-97 19:22:29<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  28-07-97 19:22:26-28-07-97 19:22:26,28-07-97 19:21:25-28-07-97 19:21:25<br>DeliveredDate:  28-07-97 19:21:25<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA v1.1 (385.6 5-6-1997)) with SMTP id <br>C12564E2.005F6DF4; Mon, 28 Jul 1997 19:22:20 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA23093; Mon, 28 Jul 1997 19:22:29 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 28 Jul 1997 19:22:29 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA23961<br>Received: (qmail 14399 invoked from network); 28 Jul 1997 17:22:09 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 28 Jul 1997 17:22:09 -0000<br>Message-Id: <199707281719.KAA00115@zorro.bctel.ca><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Ernest McClain</h1><h3><a id=5911 href="#5911">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;George Kahrimanis&#x22; &#x3C;george_kahriman@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/28/1997 7:41:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I am new in the tuning list.
