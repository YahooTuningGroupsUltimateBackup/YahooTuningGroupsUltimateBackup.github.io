I purchased the Vol.1 No.4 Spring 1990 issue of<br>PITCH because it has a 72-tone clarinet fingering chart by Ian<br>Greitzer.  I am having problems following this fingering chart<br>though.  I don't know what keys on the clarinet correspond to the<br>numbers on this fingering chart. I looked on a standard Rubank, Boheme<br>chart and the numbers did not correspond to the chart in PITCH.  Also,<br>there are several occasions where there is one fingering written<br>underneath several different pitches.  Does that mean that that<br>fingering is used for all those pitches?  If anyone has any<br>information about this fingering chart, how to get in touch with Ian<br>Greitzer, or how to find another fingering chart, let me know.
