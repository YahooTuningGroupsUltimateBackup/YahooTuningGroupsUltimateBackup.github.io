I suppose if one could weld tiny bearings of negligible moment of intertia to the ends of a wire, and then pull on the bearings to generate the string tension, one might be able to create the kind of boundary condition at the ends of the wire which would eliminate this effect.  However, if one did just this, most listeners would probably complain: "That doesn't sound like a real ....."  <br><br>	When one synthesizes musical tones by additive Fourrier synthesis this is exactly the kind of sound you get: perfectly harmonic, but somehow not quite believable.  Most listeners are used to, and tend to prefer, the sounds of real, anharmonic instruments which have these theoretically objectionable "defects", otherwise there wouldn't be so many synths on the market based on waveform sampling of "real" instruments rather than using Fourrier synthesis from harmonic partials - or so it seems to me.<br>								Clif Ashcraft<br><br>----------<br>From: 	James Kukula[SMTP:kukula@synopsys.com]<br>Sent: 	Friday, January 03, 1997 1:09 AM<br>To: 	aaaabb1@peabody.sct.ucarb.com<br>Subject: 	integral overtones<br><br><br>Natural systems have all sorts of wierd overtone sets.

I suppose if one could weld tiny bearings of negligible moment of intertia to the ends of a wire, and then pull on the bearings to generate the string tension, one might be able to create the kind of boundary condition at the ends of the wire which would eliminate this effect.  However, if one did just this, most listeners would probably complain: "That doesn't sound like a real ....."  <br><br>	When one synthesizes musical tones by additive Fourrier synthesis this is exactly the kind of sound you get: perfectly harmonic, but somehow not quite believable.  Most listeners are used to, and tend to prefer, the sounds of real, anharmonic instruments which have these theoretically objectionable "defects", otherwise there wouldn't be so many synths on the market based on waveform sampling of "real" instruments rather than using Fourrier synthesis from harmonic partials - or so it seems to me.<br>								Clif Ashcraft<br><br>----------<br>From: 	James Kukula[SMTP:kukula@synopsys.com]<br>Sent: 	Friday, January 03, 1997 1:09 AM<br>To: 	aaaabb1@peabody.sct.ucarb.com<br>Subject: 	integral overtones<br><br><br>Natural systems have all sorts of wierd overtone sets.
