CRI has kept his<br>music available for more than twenty years.  He's a back bone of our<br>catalogue not to mention the experimental tradition in American music.<br><br>When we reissued on CD The Bewitched, we made a flyer offering both our<br>Patch CDs plus three books by our about Partch and the video of The<br>Dreamer That Remains.  If you e-mail CRI, we can send you this flyer by<br>standard U.S. mail.  Of the three books offered (an annotated catalogue of<br>his works, Genesis of a Music, and Bitter Music), Genesis is out of print<br>when last we checked, but the other titles can be obtained still through<br>CRI.  <br><br>AND, we have plans to reissue the majority of Patch's remaining Gate 5<br>recordings on CD.  Gate 5 was Patch's own label wherein he recorded the<br>majority of his major works.  Our two CDs of recordings are drawn from<br>Gate 5 material.  Lots still remains -- many recordings not heard in<br>years.  I spent a weekend last spring with Danlee Mitchell, Patch's heir,<br>in San Diego reviewing the material.   That's all I'll say for now... It's<br>going to be a lot of work to get this done (two or three new CDs) with<br>proper notes and librettos, etc.  So, my guess is winter/spring of next<br>year will be the time to look for a major new Patch series on CRI.<br><br>Joseph Dalton<br>Managing Director<br><br>COMPOSERS RECORDINGS, INC.<br>73 Spring Street, Suite 506<br>New York, NY  10012-5800<br>phone 212.941.9673<br>fax 212.941.9704<br>e-mail:  CRInyc@aol.com<br><br><br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 23 Aug 1996 21:01 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA30183; Fri, 23 Aug 1996 21:02:46 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA30172<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA22737; Fri, 23 Aug 1996 12:02:45 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 23 Aug 1996 12:02:45 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199608231901.MAA04298@mailhub.Stanford.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3467 href="#3467">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Enrique Moreno&#x22; &#x3C;eig@ccrma.stanford.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Check it for yourself:<br><br>+ There is a Founder, who is the prophet for the Ultimate Truth<br>+ There is the Ultimate Truth and Ground of all things (namely, Just<br>Intonation)<br>+ There are the Disciples and many would-be initiates<br>+ There is a corpus of Sacred Writings <br>+ There is a book containing The Teachings<br>+ There are the Sacred Relics made by the Founder himself<br>+ There are ritual meetings to celebrate the Mysteries<br>+ There are Orthodox, Liberal, and Puritan Theologians<br>+ There are rival sister religions, and ancient pagan cults<br>+ There are detractors and persecutions of the faithful<br>+ There are also heretics who deny either the approved liturgy or the<br>validity of some crucial dogma<br>+ There are atheists who don't believe in the Ultimate Ground of all things<br>(let alone in the Master)<br>+ Item plus, there are skeptics who think that both believers and<br>unbelievers are right (or wrong)<br>+ There are converts and apostates, who have either found or lost their<br>faith in both the Ultimate Truth or its Prophet<br>+ There are also sympathizers and curious, who would like to know more<br>about the Master and the Ultimate Truth of all things<br>+ There are scientists who despise this religion and call it numerology<br>+ Item there are other scientists who uphold that this religion and science<br>are not at odds<br>+ There are zealots and counter-revolutionaries whose main objective is the<br>destruction of the hegemony of the 12-tone-equal-temperament, and who will<br>pragmatically ally with the faithful just to undermine the<br>12-tone-equal-temperament status quo. <br>+ Then there is the great and indifferent World at large, who immerse in<br>the darkness of 12-tone-equal -temperament doesn't even know about any of<br>the above (or care to know) <br><br>	There are also real religions ...  :)<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Topic No. 9<br><br>Date:     Fri, 23 Aug 1996 22:06 +0200<br>From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)<br>To: tuning<br>Subject: Announcement of radio programmes<br>Message-ID: <009A74C7D7F1C120.3321@vbv40.ezh.nl><br><br>Op maandag 26 augustus is er om 20.00 u. in het programma Supplement<br>op radio 4 een vier uur durend portret van de op 31 mei j.l. overleden <br>componist Ton de Leeuw.
