Kraehenbuehl and <br>Schmidt, inspired by Yasser, proposed an evolution proceeding from 5 to 7 to <br>12 to 22 to 41 tones per octave, corresponding with a harmonic limit that <br>increased from 3 to 5 to 7 to 11. They defined all the tones with just <br>ratios and defined the harmonic limit as the highest prime number used in <br>these ratios (thus they skipped 9). The evolution proceeds by interpolating <br>one new note into each of the larger steps of the previous system, first <br>using only the older harmonic limit. Then, once the newer system begins to <br>be used in its entirety, the next harmonic limit begins to cause new <br>"inflections" in the tuning of the older system to occur. Once the newer <br>harmonic limit takes effect, the process begins again. They saw jazz (this <br>was 1962) as approaching a 12-tone totality, with lots of 7-limit <br>inflections. There may be some truth to this. If they were right, we may <br>expect jazz musicians to begin to realize that the inflected 12-tone scale <br>has 10 "holes" in it, which they will begin to fill in. The problem with <br>this is, if you look at the table in my previous post, you see that two <br>different notes of the hyperchromatic scale are represented by ratios (4/3 <br>and 27/20, for example) that are separated by a syntonic comma (81/80). <br>Standard jazz harmonic formulae are still 5-limit in origin and so assume <br>that the syntonic comma occurs only as inflections of a single note. So <br>evidently this linear type of "evolution" is not going to get us to a <br>22-tone system. We need to "start from scratch," or at least "back up a <br>step" and then "leap forwards," in order to find a good 7-limit/22-tone <br>system.<br><br>I've been dropping hints here in case some lurker has been following my <br>posts. That was the biggest one yet. Tomorrow is my last day reading this <br>list for a while, and the day I send out my paper for publication. I <br>discovered the 7-limit/22-tone system that is the topic of the paper back in <br>'91, having only read Helmholtz, Yasser, and Partch. Then I got really <br>interested and started reading everything. Soon, thanks to John Starrett, <br>I'll have a nice 22-tone guitar, and all this theorizing will be supplanted <br>by an even more enjoyable activity. Anyway, I hope someone out there chooses <br>to contemplate these ideas over the next month, as it's always more exciting <br>to figure something out for yourself than to be told outright.
