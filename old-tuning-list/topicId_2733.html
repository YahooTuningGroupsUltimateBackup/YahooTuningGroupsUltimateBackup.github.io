What<br>are the requirements for such a system for the future?  I propose that they<br>should:  (Pitch Mapping) * be applicable to all and every musical instrument,<br>sound,<br>  and previous music.  * be able to map any interval to known levels of<br>precision.  * Avoid any bias towards any particular integer or rational<br>number sequence (Harmony, Scales, and Coding) * allow any number of<br>conceivable intervals and arrange additions in patterns<br>  of progressively increasing dissonance.  * be able to map scales in an<br>unambiguous way, which provides clear<br>  codification, analysis and synthesis; and plot consonance and dissonance<br>  in a simple way.  (Notation) * enable any music from the past, as well as<br>the future,<br>  to be interpreted, emulated, represented and played.  * be clear,<br>unambiguous and, evolving from traditional notation, which also<br>  express "harmonic" structure.  (Conversion) * provide a clear, logical, and<br>easy route for novices to evolve and<br>  progress beyond traditional musical education, notation, instruments,12tET,<br>  and other systems.  * easily reprocess existing midi files.  (Time) *<br>provide a compatible and related rhythm and tempo system.  (Color coding) *<br>contain a practical pitch to color system, for synaesthetic visual<br>  representation, for immediate scale, key, and pitch reference and training.<br>(Geometry) * move beyond Platonic solids to spherical conceptualisation.  I<br>believe that I have found such a universal system, with large (L) and small<br>(s) intervals, derived from pi;  and am continuing to develop its potential.<br>If you'd like to know more, please check out the LucyTuning websites starting<br>from http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy.  You may argue with my failure to conform<br>to classical acoustic theory, yet can anyone honestly claim that any other<br>tuning system can fulfill ALL these requirements?
