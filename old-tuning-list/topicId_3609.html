I don't know how many of you are moms and dads out there, but<br>those of you who are, are likely to have watched one or more of the<br>Disney animated musical of the last several years.  Over and over<br>again.  So you might be all too familiar with, for example, The Lion<br>King.  I have a tuning-related question concerning the opening song,<br>"The Circle of Life."  At the climactic cadence of the song, when the<br>singer reaches into his higher register to sing "IN THE circle......the<br>circle of lai----ifffee", the singer's tuning on the notes sung to "IN<br>THE" always seem problematic to me.  We are in a major key, and the<br>notes are: In (6) the (6) cir-(5) cle (3-2-1-_6-_5), the (_5) cir (4)<br>cle (3) of (2) lai (2)-aiffe (1).  The "6" note in the scale appears at<br>this point as the third in a subdominant chord.  It seems to me to be<br>somewhere between 6 and flat-6.  Has this caught the attention of any<br>parents-tuning specialist out there?  What note is actually being sung,<br>and what relationship does it have to the underlying notes?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Andrew "Daddy" Kaye</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>The Lion King!!</h1><h3><a id=7880 href="#7880">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Andrew L.
