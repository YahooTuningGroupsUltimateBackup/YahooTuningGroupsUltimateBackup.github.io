You can sort of imagine how it all goes together,<br>but some tips are that I threaded the guitar string through its own bead<br>to creat a loop that went around the screw. I put the screw in the side<br>angling down and the eye screws just in from the top (long) ends and<br>angled out so that the string would have more or less 18" of resonating<br>length. The autoharp peg was opposite the screw, also angled down. I<br>divided and marked the board in 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5...1/9 lengths and<br>when plucked on a table for resonance each of those nodes produces a<br>very clear partial up through the 9th. WHen the board is held to my ear<br>I can clearly hear through the 19th.

In virtually all dynamical<br>>systems which can behave chaotically, there is a phenomenon called<br>>period-doubling which describes the transition from stable, periodic<br>>behavior to chaotic behavior. As a relevant parameter of the system is<br>>increased from a stable to a chaotic value, the system repeats itself<br>>every 2, 4, 8, 16, . . . periods of the stable period. The transitions<br>>from one power of two to the next occur closer and closer together; the<br>>changes in parameter values required to produce each successive period<br>>doubling approach a decreasing geometric sequence with scaling =<br>parameter<br>>equal to the Feigenbaum constant (4.6692016091029 . . . ). This means<br>>that at a finite value of the parameter, the period will be infinite,<br>>i.e., we have chaos.<br>><br>>There may be many stages in the hearing process in which non-linear<br>>dynamics come into play. It would probably be counterproductive to =<br>allow<br>>this non-linearity to be enough to lead to chaos, while a parallel<br>>structure of processors with different, lesser degrees of non-linearity<br>>might actually aid in the recognition of pitch. It is known that when a<br>>(not too high) pitch is heard, there are neurons that fire at the same<br>>rate as the vibration rate of the pitch itself. Other neurons in the<br>>brain are known to have a non-linear response to their input from other<br>>neurons. Since a response non-linear enough to lead to chaos would<br>>essentially be destroying all frequency information, most of the =<br>neurons<br>>would oscillate at the input frequency or at octave equivalents below<br>>that frequency. Perhaps a certain, low octave range is where pitch<br>>judgments are actually made. Notice how very high tones seem ambiguous<br>>in pitch.<br>><br>>Whether this or the winding of the cochlea explains octave equivalence,<br>>there may have been evolutionary advantages conferred by the ability to<br>>reduce unimportant information and potential confusion from overtones =<br>by<br>>compressing pitch information to within one octave, which led to the<br>>brain or ear being designed the way they are.<br>><br>>As for the apparantly irregular "subharmonic" which Gary observed in =<br>the<br>>bassoon waveform, this can easily be explained by assuming some<br>>parameter of non-linearity (perhaps lip pressure) was hovering around a<br>>value at which an initial period doubling occurs. So the amplitude of<br>>this period-2 subharmonic could have been changing, and it could cease<br>>to exist for a while, returning again just as easily after either an =<br>odd<br>>or even number of period-1 oscillations.<br>><br>>Here's an observation about instrument or vocal "subharmonics": Beyond<br>>the onset of chaos, chaotic regions alternate (in a fractal pattern)<br>>with regions whose periods are non-power-of-two multiples of the stable<br>>period. The last of these subharmonic periods to occur, but the =<br>broadest<br>>in allowed parameter values, is period 3. So within a wide enough range<br>>of highly chaotic parameter values, one is likely to stumble upon<br>>period-3 behavior. Increasing the parameter value further leads to the<br>>period doublings, which in this case means period-6, period-12,<br>>period-24, . . . with the same Feigenbaum constant, and back to chaos.<br>>But decreasing the parameter leads directly back to chaos, via a<br>>phenomemon known as intermittency, where very nearly period-3 behavior<br>>persists for stretches of time, unpredictably alternating with =<br>stretches<br>>of chaotic behavior. (The same thing is true for every odd number above<br>>3, although the smallest parameter value needed to achieve a given odd<br>>subharmonic, and the range of parameter values in which it persists, =<br>are<br>>decreasing functions of that odd number). Therefore, assuming the<br>>parameter value varies smoothly with time, and at some times takes on<br>>values corresponding to simple period-1 vibration, the only =<br>subharmonics<br>>which can exist without chaos ever occuring are the subharmonics<br>>corresponding to powers of 2. Period-3 oscillation (or, to a lesser<br>>extent, periods of higher odd numbers) can be relatively common but<br>>cannot smoothly connect with simpler behavior.<br>><br>>------------------------------<br>><br>>Topic No. 11<br>><br>>Date: Tue, 05 May 1998 11:10:24 -0700<br>>From: Xou Oxno <xouoxno@virtulink.com><br>>To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>>Subject: Steve Vai in Guitar World. and other babbel...<br>>Message-ID: <354F5610.1289@virtulink.com><br>><br>>In my ever ending quest to effectively waste<br>>time more efficently, I found this program<br>>this morning and have managed to waste 4 hours so far.<br>><br>>Steve Vai in Guitar World.  http://www.guitarworld.com<br>><br>>Here's the original text:<br>><br>>VAI: I've done some kooky things that involved dividing=20<br>>up the fretboard.

In virtually all dynamical<br>>systems which can behave chaotically, there is a phenomenon called<br>>period-doubling which describes the transition from stable, periodic<br>>behavior to chaotic behavior. As a relevant parameter of the system is<br>>increased from a stable to a chaotic value, the system repeats itself<br>>every 2, 4, 8, 16, . . . periods of the stable period. The transitions<br>>from one power of two to the next occur closer and closer together; the<br>>changes in parameter values required to produce each successive period<br>>doubling approach a decreasing geometric sequence with scaling =<br>parameter<br>>equal to the Feigenbaum constant (4.6692016091029 . . . ). This means<br>>that at a finite value of the parameter, the period will be infinite,<br>>i.e., we have chaos.<br>><br>>There may be many stages in the hearing process in which non-linear<br>>dynamics come into play. It would probably be counterproductive to =<br>allow<br>>this non-linearity to be enough to lead to chaos, while a parallel<br>>structure of processors with different, lesser degrees of non-linearity<br>>might actually aid in the recognition of pitch. It is known that when a<br>>(not too high) pitch is heard, there are neurons that fire at the same<br>>rate as the vibration rate of the pitch itself. Other neurons in the<br>>brain are known to have a non-linear response to their input from other<br>>neurons. Since a response non-linear enough to lead to chaos would<br>>essentially be destroying all frequency information, most of the =<br>neurons<br>>would oscillate at the input frequency or at octave equivalents below<br>>that frequency. Perhaps a certain, low octave range is where pitch<br>>judgments are actually made. Notice how very high tones seem ambiguous<br>>in pitch.<br>><br>>Whether this or the winding of the cochlea explains octave equivalence,<br>>there may have been evolutionary advantages conferred by the ability to<br>>reduce unimportant information and potential confusion from overtones =<br>by<br>>compressing pitch information to within one octave, which led to the<br>>brain or ear being designed the way they are.<br>><br>>As for the apparantly irregular "subharmonic" which Gary observed in =<br>the<br>>bassoon waveform, this can easily be explained by assuming some<br>>parameter of non-linearity (perhaps lip pressure) was hovering around a<br>>value at which an initial period doubling occurs. So the amplitude of<br>>this period-2 subharmonic could have been changing, and it could cease<br>>to exist for a while, returning again just as easily after either an =<br>odd<br>>or even number of period-1 oscillations.<br>><br>>Here's an observation about instrument or vocal "subharmonics": Beyond<br>>the onset of chaos, chaotic regions alternate (in a fractal pattern)<br>>with regions whose periods are non-power-of-two multiples of the stable<br>>period. The last of these subharmonic periods to occur, but the =<br>broadest<br>>in allowed parameter values, is period 3. So within a wide enough range<br>>of highly chaotic parameter values, one is likely to stumble upon<br>>period-3 behavior. Increasing the parameter value further leads to the<br>>period doublings, which in this case means period-6, period-12,<br>>period-24, . . . with the same Feigenbaum constant, and back to chaos.<br>>But decreasing the parameter leads directly back to chaos, via a<br>>phenomemon known as intermittency, where very nearly period-3 behavior<br>>persists for stretches of time, unpredictably alternating with =<br>stretches<br>>of chaotic behavior. (The same thing is true for every odd number above<br>>3, although the smallest parameter value needed to achieve a given odd<br>>subharmonic, and the range of parameter values in which it persists, =<br>are<br>>decreasing functions of that odd number). Therefore, assuming the<br>>parameter value varies smoothly with time, and at some times takes on<br>>values corresponding to simple period-1 vibration, the only =<br>subharmonics<br>>which can exist without chaos ever occuring are the subharmonics<br>>corresponding to powers of 2. Period-3 oscillation (or, to a lesser<br>>extent, periods of higher odd numbers) can be relatively common but<br>>cannot smoothly connect with simpler behavior.<br>><br>>------------------------------<br>><br>>Topic No. 11<br>><br>>Date: Tue, 05 May 1998 11:10:24 -0700<br>>From: Xou Oxno <xouoxno@virtulink.com><br>>To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>>Subject: Steve Vai in Guitar World. and other babbel...<br>>Message-ID: <354F5610.1289@virtulink.com><br>><br>>In my ever ending quest to effectively waste<br>>time more efficently, I found this program<br>>this morning and have managed to waste 4 hours so far.<br>><br>>Steve Vai in Guitar World.  http://www.guitarworld.com<br>><br>>Here's the original text:<br>><br>>VAI: I've done some kooky things that involved dividing=20<br>>up the fretboard.
