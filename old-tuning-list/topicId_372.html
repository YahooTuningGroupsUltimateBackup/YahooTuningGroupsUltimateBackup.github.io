Hopefully, I'll have more to<br>say on some specific articles in subsequent posts. But first, a few comments on<br>John C.'s Notes & Comments section, specifically regarding mention of my XH web<br>pages:<br><br>1) My e-mail address has changed to xen@tiac.net (as should be obvious from the<br>   return address to this posting).  Any mail sent to my old address<br>   (pusey@remqhi.enet.dec.com) will either be lost or rejected outright.<br><br>2) The XH web pages are still at the same URL<br>   (http://www.tiac.net/users/xen/xh.html). In addition to the Tables of<br>   Contents for all issues of XH, there is also an Author Index and a Title<br>   Index for all articles. I recently updated these pages to include all the<br>   articles in XH 16.<br><br>3) As John C. mentions, I will be adding errata sheets for XH as they are<br>   submitted. However, as of this posting, I have not received *any* errata<br>   submissions -- not even from John C. (hint, hint).<br><br>4) Finally, John C. alludes to a glossary of xenharmonic terminology that I am<br>   planning to include on my web site.  I've been working on this off and on<br>   for well over a year now, but it is definitely a back-burner project.<br>   However, with sufficient prodding I will eventually release it for public<br>   consumption.<br><br>John<br><br>---<br>John G.
