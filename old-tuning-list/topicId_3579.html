I checked it in 12, but used 51 cents off for the 11/8 out of pure<br>mistake (51 - 4 = 43).  Okay, so you need consistency.<br><br>>>I will say that the 720 cent interval may function as the dominant in many<br>>>parts of that suite, but it does not function as a 3/2.  I cannot imagine<br>>>any two intervals more sharply contrasting in sound.<br>><br>>To me, the triads in 15-equal on the classical guitar sound almost as<br>>good as those in 12-equal.<br><br>Wow.<br><br>>No, certainly not alike. But I guess I should have said something in the<br>>paper about how in 12-tone equal temperament there is one and only one<br>>way of approximating any consonant ratio, and that is a property that<br>>adds a degree of simplicity that  musicians mayt be happy to give up.<br><br>I agree that we only want one way to approximate something in an equal<br>tuning, as long as we're using equal tuning to approximate.  But I do not<br>agree that the 1% rule determines which things are one.<br><br>>>Maybe I mis-understand what you mean by "power"<br>><br>>Yeah, something to the third power is a third power, not a power of<br>>three.<br><br>You lost me.

And I don't think that the sound of a triad will<br>submit to being predicted by such rules as "3/2 is more important in major<br>than minor triad".
