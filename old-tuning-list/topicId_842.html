Firstly the newpaper report I mentioned <br>made the mistake of mixing up "dissonant" with "out of tune" (vals).<br>The experiment contains the playing of two different unfamiliar<br>melodies of 35-second duration in a consonant and a dissonant version<br>for a total of four trials to 32 infants. A computer program<br>controlled a synthesizer. The dissonant version of the melody was<br>composed in parallel minor seconds and the consonant version of<br>parallel thirds. The babies were carefully monitored and showed more<br>fixation to the consonant version. <br>The conclusion was "Although less extreme forms of <br>consonance/dissonance might be subject to cultural influence, we <br>suggest that the human infant may possess a biological preparedness <br>that makes consonance perceptually more attractive than dissonance."<br>They wrote further that "it has been argued repeatedly that<br>consonance judgements are acquired through exposure to the music of a <br>particular culture", but that biological preparedness has never been<br>demonstrated. <br>I think only two intervals are not a broad basis to talk about<br>consonance and dissonance in general so one might conclude from this<br>experiment more cautiously that babies prefer parallel thirds over<br>minor seconds. <br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 12 Sep 1996 22:59 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA28957; Thu, 12 Sep 1996 23:01:24 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29190<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id OAA02038; Thu, 12 Sep 1996 14:01:23 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 12 Sep 1996 14:01:23 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960912165652.20202698@emuvax.emich.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Gamelan Selunding</h1><h3><a id=3548 href="#3548">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;106232.3266@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/1996 11:13:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Iï¿½m repreating a request I sent out to the Gamelan list:<br><br>Does anyone have tuning data (beyond Kunst and McPhee) on the Balinese<br>seven tone Gamelan Selunding (variations in spelling: Slonding, Salonding,<br>Selundung etc.)?<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 6 Sep 1996 09:51 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA24065; Fri, 6 Sep 1996 09:52:47 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA24003<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id AAA12578; Fri, 6 Sep 1996 00:52:45 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 6 Sep 1996 00:52:45 -0700<br>Message-Id: <009A7F61476FB720.1C2C@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3571 href="#3571">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/1996 9:52:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Interesting.

Zentner & Jerome Kagan: Perception of music by infants,<br>Nature, vol. 383, 5 september 1996, p. 29.<br>It is a letter to the editor. Firstly the newpaper report I mentioned <br>made the mistake of mixing up "dissonant" with "out of tune" (vals).<br>The experiment contains the playing of two different unfamiliar<br>melodies of 35-second duration in a consonant and a dissonant version<br>for a total of four trials to 32 infants. A computer program<br>controlled a synthesizer. The dissonant version of the melody was<br>composed in parallel minor seconds and the consonant version of<br>parallel thirds. The babies were carefully monitored and showed more<br>fixation to the consonant version. <br>The conclusion was "Although less extreme forms of <br>consonance/dissonance might be subject to cultural influence, we <br>suggest that the human infant may possess a biological preparedness <br>that makes consonance perceptually more attractive than dissonance."<br>They wrote further that "it has been argued repeatedly that<br>consonance judgements are acquired through exposure to the music of a <br>particular culture", but that biological preparedness has never been<br>demonstrated. <br>I think only two intervals are not a broad basis to talk about<br>consonance and dissonance in general so one might conclude from this<br>experiment more cautiously that babies prefer parallel thirds over<br>minor seconds. <br><br>Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.nl<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 12 Sep 1996 22:59 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA28957; Thu, 12 Sep 1996 23:01:24 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29190<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id OAA02038; Thu, 12 Sep 1996 14:01:23 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 12 Sep 1996 14:01:23 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960912165652.20202698@emuvax.emich.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
