Some European and Euro-American<br>counter-examples:<br><br>Irish folk music - especially unaccompanied Sean Nos singing - consistantly<br>demonstrates that leaps of major thirds are sung smaller than ditones and<br>that once a third has been established by the singer, an unequal infill<br>(i.e. 9:8, 10:9) is virtually inevitable. (The entire Schenker project rest<br>on an analogous insight - and Schenker's analyses of vii and ii chords<br>deserves another posting).  Alpine unaccompanied singing shares a tendency<br>towards higher limit intervals, including 7:6 minor third - possibly<br>imported from yodeling and alphorn playing. Scandinavian folk music shares<br>the five limit preference, with frequent comma shifts - while avoiding<br>comma sinking.

(A three-limit<br>realisation of pelog is impossible, I reckon.) The ''harmonic'' traditions<br>of the Asian steppe include a huge body of solo songs with consistant<br>intervals clearly outside of a three limit framework.

I would add<br>that it it also allows the reverse, so the greater the <br>vibrating surface area, the louder the instrument is and <br>the more sensitive to external sounds it is, so we hear<br>tubular bells resonate to coughs because of their surface <br>area coming and going, but we don't hear lone strings <br>(without a soundbox) resonate because of their surface<br>area coming and going. <br><br>Of course there are other factors too. A painting<br>has a lot of surface area but is not either<br>very stiff or very tense (as a drum head would be) <br>and absorbs the air vibrations, changing them <br>into heat via internal friction in the canvas.<br><br><br>Since writing the above, I've read further in the thread.<br><br>I will add that a sound box (like the body of a violin)<br>is designed not to have particular resonances, or at <br>least to have its resonances spread out into wide bands. <br>That's why you don't hear the violin body responding to <br>and sustaining particular notes when you sing while <br>muting the strings. <br><br>The strings are designed to have strong resonance <br>peaks which is why certain notes are sustained when <br>you sing while the strings left free to vibrate. <br><br>A sound box is also designed to be in good contact <br>with the vibrating element (violin string) so that <br>vibration can be conducted from the element to the <br>sound box and then to the air for us to hear. <br><br>Now, I know of no way to allow sound conduction in <br>one direction and not the other. Sound must conduct <br>mechanically from the sound box to the string just <br>as easily as from the string to the sound box. Also <br>sound must conduct as easily from the air into the <br>sound box as it does from the sound box into the air. <br><br>The sound box and string together then make a single <br>vibrating system, which is in good contact with the <br>air. It has the dual advantages of musically usable <br>high-peak resonances (the centers of these resonances <br>are even adjustable by stopping the string to <br>different lengths!) and good body-to-air contact <br>provided by the large surface area of the sound box. <br><br>Since sound is conducted equally well in both directions <br>between string and body, and equally well in both <br>directions between air and body, it makes sense to me <br>that when you sing, the air vibrations are picked up <br>only slightly by the string's small contact with the <br>air and more greatly by the body which then conducts <br>the vibration to the strings, but that the strings, <br>though having poor direct contact with the air, will <br>determine which notes the system as a whole resonates <br>best to. <br><br>Going back to the hanging chimes, each tubular bell<br>is a single system which has both large surface<br>area and definitive peak resonances (unlike a violin body).<br><br>Now, what do we tune these to? :)<br><br>Matt Nathan<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 12:42 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01758; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 12:42:16 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01689<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id DAA29154; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 03:40:04 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 27 Feb 1997 03:40:04 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199702270634_MC2-11D0-A111@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4911 href="#4911">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@library.wustl.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/1997 7:39:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Wed, 26 Feb 1997, Lydia Ayers wrote:<br>> >Yes, but tubes present orders of magnitude more surface area to be acted<br>> >upon by sound pressure than strings do.<br>> <br>> Yes, they do have more surface area, and they could even be seaid to<br>> contain their own resonators, since they are hollow.

I would add<br>that it it also allows the reverse, so the greater the <br>vibrating surface area, the louder the instrument is and <br>the more sensitive to external sounds it is, so we hear<br>tubular bells resonate to coughs because of their surface <br>area coming and going, but we don't hear lone strings <br>(without a soundbox) resonate because of their surface<br>area coming and going. <br><br>Of course there are other factors too. A painting<br>has a lot of surface area but is not either<br>very stiff or very tense (as a drum head would be) <br>and absorbs the air vibrations, changing them <br>into heat via internal friction in the canvas.<br><br><br>Since writing the above, I've read further in the thread.<br><br>I will add that a sound box (like the body of a violin)<br>is designed not to have particular resonances, or at <br>least to have its resonances spread out into wide bands. <br>That's why you don't hear the violin body responding to <br>and sustaining particular notes when you sing while <br>muting the strings. <br><br>The strings are designed to have strong resonance <br>peaks which is why certain notes are sustained when <br>you sing while the strings left free to vibrate. <br><br>A sound box is also designed to be in good contact <br>with the vibrating element (violin string) so that <br>vibration can be conducted from the element to the <br>sound box and then to the air for us to hear. <br><br>Now, I know of no way to allow sound conduction in <br>one direction and not the other. Sound must conduct <br>mechanically from the sound box to the string just <br>as easily as from the string to the sound box. Also <br>sound must conduct as easily from the air into the <br>sound box as it does from the sound box into the air. <br><br>The sound box and string together then make a single <br>vibrating system, which is in good contact with the <br>air. It has the dual advantages of musically usable <br>high-peak resonances (the centers of these resonances <br>are even adjustable by stopping the string to <br>different lengths!) and good body-to-air contact <br>provided by the large surface area of the sound box. <br><br>Since sound is conducted equally well in both directions <br>between string and body, and equally well in both <br>directions between air and body, it makes sense to me <br>that when you sing, the air vibrations are picked up <br>only slightly by the string's small contact with the <br>air and more greatly by the body which then conducts <br>the vibration to the strings, but that the strings, <br>though having poor direct contact with the air, will <br>determine which notes the system as a whole resonates <br>best to. <br><br>Going back to the hanging chimes, each tubular bell<br>is a single system which has both large surface<br>area and definitive peak resonances (unlike a violin body).<br><br>Now, what do we tune these to? :)<br><br>Matt Nathan<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 12:42 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01758; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 12:42:16 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01689<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id DAA29154; Thu, 27 Feb 1997 03:40:04 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 27 Feb 1997 03:40:04 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199702270634_MC2-11D0-A111@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4911 href="#4911">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@library.wustl.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/1997 7:39:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>On Wed, 26 Feb 1997, Lydia Ayers wrote:<br>> >Yes, but tubes present orders of magnitude more surface area to be acted<br>> >upon by sound pressure than strings do.<br>> <br>> Yes, they do have more surface area, and they could even be seaid to<br>> contain their own resonators, since they are hollow.
