However, I have <br>> had difficulty finding such a tuning written down. I would therefore be <br>> very grateful if someone could send me details of a Klezmer tuning and a <br>> composition written using it (I was told of this address by my teacher <br>> Tony Salinas).<br>> <br>> During my research into this subject (in the very few books that I have <br>> found which mention Klezmer) I have started to get the feeling that maybe <br>> Klezmer tuning is very close to equal temperament. I'm sure taht someone <br>> will know. If this is the case I would really appreciate if somebody <br>> could send me deatils of another Jewish tuning (such as a Greek, <br>> Iranian, Yemeni, Landino, Turkish etc tuning)  which is noticeably different <br>> from equal temperaemet.<br>> <br>> If someone does manage to help me I will more than be happy to send them a <br>> copy of my MIDI file when my project is complete.
