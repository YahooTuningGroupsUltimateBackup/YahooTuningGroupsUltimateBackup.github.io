Going against the grain somewhat, I have had it tempered to ascale where the interval 1 - 3 is exactly between 81/64 and 4/3, and the<br>fifths in the sequence 1 - 5 - 2 - 6 - 3 are each 713.25 cents. The<br>octaves, however, are _pleng_ (in tune). I had played around with severalJust intonations, but each of them favored one pathet over the others, and<br>split keys seemed to create unmanageable technical problems when playing<br>traditional repertoire. An interesting thing about the temperament I<br>settled on is that a set of pythagorean assumptions tempered in this way<br>leads to better representations of septimal intervals, which most of the<br>just gamelan in the US feature. The choices of _pleng_ octaves and 1-3 asmy "wolf" may well be points of discussion, but the tuning (as used on mygender) has aroused no particular comments from experienced players.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 31 May 1997 02:51 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05382; Sat, 31 May 1997 02:51:09 +0200<br>Date: Sat, 31 May 1997 02:51:09 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05371<br>Received: (qmail 27702 invoked from network); 31 May 1997 00:50:57 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 31 May 1997 00:50:57 -0000<br>Message-Id: <970530204711_-1162894512@emout09.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>a slendro gamelan</h1><h3><a id=5562 href="#5562">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/1997 12:56:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I have recently ordered a small slendro gamelan from Suhirdjan in<br>Jogyakarta.
