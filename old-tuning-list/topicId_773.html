I was tempted to enter the Partch fray early<br>on with words of wisdom (I'll bet every party involved believes theirs are<br>words of wisdom) but I thought that the battle would have been long<br>over by now.  It seems to be as acrimonious as ever, so here goes:<br><br>1)  How about agreeing that restrictions on transcriptions might be eased<br>up once there was a readily available body of "authentic" versions<br>available on CD?  It seems to me that the main objection is that<br>transcribed works are standing in for the real thing.  With the increasing<br>availability of Partch on record and in print [Revelation, Li Po, 4-CD set,<br>projected CRI release, publication of Bitter Music] it seems there's a<br>market.  Hopefully, there will be new recordings as well as re-released<br>early recordings.  Once a listener can refer to these there's less worry<br>about a transcription completely misrepresenting Harry's work. [That still<br>won't solve the corporeality problem, I know.]<br><br>2) In regard to the hording of the instruments I have the following story to<br>relate:<br>In 1977, when I lived in southern California, I found out that Partch's<br>instruments were being kept at San Diego State.  I drove down and<br>spoke with Danlee Mitchell and told him I was interested in Harry's music<br>and theories.  He didn't know me from Adam but he gave me access any<br>time I wanted to the instruments.  They were kept in two big<br>climate-controlled rooms.  Well, I guess they were big rooms, but they<br>were still plenty crowded.  He let me in, then left me alone with them.  I<br>still can't believe that kind of trust and generosity. There was a big pile of<br>scores in there, too.  I was a dumb kid, though, and made poor use of it. <br>It meant four hours on the road each time I visited, which meant I didn't<br>get there very often, and there was more than a bit of a learning curve,<br>so I didn't feel like I accomplished much while I was there.  I came 5 times<br>over a period of 3 months or so, then moved back east without a word. <br>So, Danlee, if you see this, thanks for the opportunity -- and sorry I blew<br>it.  It was wonderful, though, to be allowed so near to something that<br>otherwise could only have been legendary to me.<br><br>3)  About synthesizer substitutions.  Leaving aside corporeality and<br>theatrical presentation, it sounds like it should work.  What makes me<br>wary is a recording I have of Yankee Doodle Fantasy done on synth. <br>I've never heard any other version so I can't say where the fault lies -- I<br>don't know, that is, if it's a bad representation of Harry's music or if Harry<br>was having an off day -- but it makes me embarrassed for him every<br>time I hear it (not often).  If it was all the Partch I'd ever heard I sure<br>wouldn't want to hear any more.  But, then, I feel that way about Castor<br>and Pollux, so what do I know?<br><br>Bruce Campbell<br>campbeb@cesmtp.ccf.org<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 23 Aug 1996 06:45 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA27807; Fri, 23 Aug 1996 06:46:19 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA27973<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA12113; Thu, 22 Aug 1996 21:46:12 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 22 Aug 1996 21:46:12 -0700<br>Message-Id: <2.2.32.19960823044428.00674840@adnc.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3462 href="#3462">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Jonathan M.
