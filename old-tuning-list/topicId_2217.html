While I will not go so far as Vogel and proposeJust Intonations for works by these composers, I think the fact that the<br>tonal vocabulary for most works of Haydn or Mozart does not extend beyondthe resources of Meantone - and limits intonationally ''exotic'' chords to<br>the development sections, is highly suggestive.
