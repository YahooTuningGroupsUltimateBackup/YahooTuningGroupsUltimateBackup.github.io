A very stimulating evening indeed that included music by Harrison,<br>Partch, Arvo Part, Johnny Reinhard, George Zelenz, Esmaeel Tehrani, and Sasha<br>Bogdanowitsch.  All the pieces on the program had a great deal to offer.<br>Reinhard's performed his solo bassoon piece, DUNE, which expertly employed<br>innovative uses of multiphonics,  poly-microtonality, and extended<br>instrumental techniques.  Sasha Bogdanowitsch presented an ambitious 25 minute<br>chamber work in JI  featuring his exquisite vocal work.  The audience seemed<br>quite fascinated by the exotic language he created for the text.  He<br>accompanied each syllable with dance-like gestures that further expressed the<br>emotion inherent in the sung phrase.  Quite compelling.  The concert was<br>produced by John Schneider and was well attended.</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1> Microfest 4-19-98</h1><h3><a id=7567 href="#7567">ðŸ”—</a>KIBA DACHI &#x3C;KIBADACHI@aol.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/1998 10:35:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Just wanted to put in my 2 cents about the Microfest held in Los Angeles a<br>week ago.
