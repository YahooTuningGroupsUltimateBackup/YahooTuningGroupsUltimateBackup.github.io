Well, it's not impossible, in 22TET, to<br>construct a progression starting and ending on the same tonic, but which<br>relies upon a syntonic pseudocomma shift.  Perhaps for example, it could<br>pseudocomma shift the tonic down to where an A matches the original Ab, and<br>then "pun" between vi and bVI in a progression that lands you back at the<br>original tonic.
