I think I should state my opinion on this idea of his a<br>little bit more precisely.<br>1.  The essential idea he's getting at I don't by any means think to be<br>    ridiculous or anything like that.  If Gregg's suggestion can be summarized<br>    that there is a certain level of detail in pitch below which we view their<br>    melodic effects will be perceived as subtle flavorings of the same original,<br>    and above which they will be perceived as an essentially different melody,<br>    then my opinion is that it's an interesting concept.  Proposing that such<br>    a "limen" exists is a sign of insightfulness in that he's come up with an<br>    underlying concept I don't recall having been discussed on the list.<br>2.  It's an interesting concept that could perhaps become a useful rule of thumb<br>    for composers (e.g., if you're composing something under the assumption<br>    that the audience will hear at greater resolution than this, you probably<br>    won't get your idea across).<br>3.  Despite that, I think it's important to note that its area of direct appli-<br>    cability is fairly narrow.  (A narrow field of applicability doesn't neces-<br>    sarily imply unimportance.)  I say that based upon the examples he's given<br>    and the counterexamples others and I have suggested.  For example, this<br>    limen has potential applicability to comparatively familiar melodic<br>    structures like diatonic melodies, but it's more difficult to relate to<br>    microtonal melodic runs, or to melodies pulled from entirely nontraditional<br>    scales (e.g., 9TET, 8TET, 11TET, Pierce-Bohlen, and 88CET to name a few).<br>    Also, its direct applicability to other than melody seems somewhat limited<br>    as well.<br>4.  The idea is based upon an assumption of a fairly abrupt change in peoples'<br>    perception of tuning errors, that change being centered around the limen he<br>    proposes to be around 60 cents.  Tuning ... "surprises" I'll say ... smaller<br>    than 30 cents (i.e., to the nearest 60-cent-resolution point) will be viewed<br>    as coloring of the familiar melody, whereas tuning surprises larger than<br>    that fundamentally change the melody.  I'm inclined to think that the<br>    attitude change from melodic coloring to fundamental melodic change is a<br>    greatly more gradual one.  Standard melodic variation techniques and modal<br>    changes (for example) show clearly that melodies can undergo some extremely<br>    enormous permutations before our ears perceived them to be fundamentally<br>    different.  Given that recognizability of a melody blurs out that far, it<br>    seems surprising that there would be sharp, sudden changes in attitude<br>    toward subtle changes.<br>5.  He seems to suggest that the sub-30-cent coloring effects of a different<br>    rendition of a diatonic melody are comparatively unimportant.  I don't think<br>    that the distinction between a familiar melody rendered in, say, QC meantone<br>    vs. 19TET, vs. Ptolemiac JI are as audibly significant as the variations<br>    available across entirely nondiatonic frameworks.  But even still, I don't<br>    think it wise to underestimate the musical impact of those coloring effects.<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison) <br>Subject:  Partch CDs<br>PostedDate:  20-12-97 11:01:00<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  20-12-97 10:58:56-20-12-97 10:58:56,20-12-97 10:58:31-20-12-97 10:58:32<br>DeliveredDate:  20-12-97 10:58:32<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256573.0036D20F; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 11:00:43 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22578; Sat, 20 Dec 1997 11:01:00 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 20 Dec 1997 11:01:00 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22322<br>Received: (qmail 19134 invoked from network); 20 Dec 1997 02:00:52 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 20 Dec 1997 02:00:52 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01541108b0c0b90c552b@[207.207.2.115]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>A Higher-Level Comment on Gregg Gibson's Limen</h1><h3><a id=6739 href="#6739">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>12/20/1997 2:00:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I and several others have reacted skeptically to some of Gregg Gibson's<br>recent thoughts.
