Pretty disappointing<br>after listening to Crash Landing.<br><br>..and one more thing.  Last week after returning home from holiday<br>travels, I found in my mailbox the Tuning List Swap Tape.  It was my most<br>unusual Christmas present this year.  Amazing variety of material, giving<br>me a better glimpse into some of the charmingly psychotic minds<br>participating in this forum.  Thanks again to Denis, Gary, and whoever else<br>was involved...<br><br>kp<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  "Bob Lee" <quasar@wco.com><br>Subject:  Re: What do you play?<br>PostedDate:  03-01-98 17:41:38<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  03-01-98 17:39:13-03-01-98 17:39:14,03-01-98 17:38:33-03-01-98 17:38:33<br>DeliveredDate:  03-01-98 17:38:33<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256581.005B7803; Sat, 3 Jan 1998 17:41:01 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07348; Sat, 3 Jan 1998 17:41:38 +0100<br>Date: Sat, 3 Jan 1998 17:41:38 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07383<br>Received: (qmail 3579 invoked from network); 3 Jan 1998 08:41:35 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 3 Jan 1998 08:41:35 -0800<br>Message-Id: <01bd1865$185db5c0$795e04c7@quasar><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=6924 href="#6924">ðŸ”—</a>gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)</h3><span>1/4/1998 10:17:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Neil Haverstick apparently has:<br><br>>     19 tone electric, built by Starrett (whose is it, anyway?), with a<br>> Roland GR 300 guitar synth controller installed;<br><br>Does this mean you can use it to give MIDI input with 19 frets per<br>octave?<br><br>While I'm on a guitar tip, how practical would it be to set one up<br>with movable frets?<br><br>My stuff is:<br><br>AWE64 Gold soundcard<br>TX81Z synth module<br>DX21 performance synth<br>Studio 49 input keyboard<br><br>The 64G, naturally, lives in a PC, but that isn't mine.
