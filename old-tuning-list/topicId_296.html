For me, composing in alternate tunings is a very natural<br>extension of my personal self expression as an artist. I have always<br>loved music from all over the world, and have studied many styles out of<br>a great respect for those styles. And from playing those many styles for<br>30 years, I have arrived at a place as a performer and composer where I<br>feel comfortable drawing on whatever I need to form my own personal<br>style. If I play a piece that resembles an oud player, I am certainly<br>not trying to say that I am a Middle Eastern expert...I am saying that I<br>love that sound, and here's my take on it; I feel very honest about it.<br>My mentor Ed Toler in Kansas City (a real genius) used to jokingly say<br>that he played like 10,000 monkeys pecking away at 10,000<br>typewriters'''sooner or later, they'll write the bible...and that is my<br>philosophy as well. I allow myself to be affected by any sort of music<br>(or art, period), run it through the blender, and what comes out is<br>hopefully original and meaningful.<br>    So, other tunings are a very logical step for me in this process.<br>When I write a 19 tone blues, it's because I hear it that way; when I<br>learn a 34/oct modal tuning, it's my way of distilling all of the great<br>Indian/Arabic music I've heard into my own thing. And, this is how I've<br>presented other tunings to my students and friends, as a very simple,<br>natural thing to do...it's no big deal. I try to make music that relates<br>to all facets of my consciousness, from pretty and simple to weird and<br>dissonant, and in the process I feel blessed that most people who have<br>heard this music have responded in a positive way.<br>    Mike Bloomfield said something once in an interview that I never<br>forgot...he said that nice guys like John Sebastian make nice music, and<br>that whacked out folks like Paul Butterfield make whacked out music; how<br>true. And, if there is a gap in the "microtonal" scene between the folks<br>who participate in it and the "average" listener, it is because many of<br>the folks in this field are real genius, academic types, and much of the<br>music they make with other tuning systems is real genius, academic<br>sounding music, which mostly other genius academic types will<br>like...simple enough to me.<br>    Believe me, this is not any sort of judgement, only an observation.<br>My goal is to convince people that other tunings are valid for any type<br>of music, and can be used A> for more subtle shades of emotional<br>expression, and B> to relieve the incredible monotony of the 12/eq<br>system. For me, it is also an enormous kick in the ass to try to learn<br>other systems for the pure joy of the challenge, but if I couldn't<br>translate a tuning into real music, it wouldn't be worth much. I see no<br>reason why players from any style of music cannot use other tunings,<br>other than the simple fact that hardly anyone has ever been exposed to<br>anything other than 12/eq. I plan to change that, and, as I jokingly<br>say, try to bridge the gap between beer drinkers and geniuses (although<br>the two are not necessarily exclusive)...Hstick<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 22 Jan 1996 16:08 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA12581; Mon, 22 Jan 1996 07:08:17 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 22 Jan 1996 07:08:17 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.960122090558.16069C-100000@library><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Matt Puzan's post on composition</h1><h3><a id=2480 href="#2480">ðŸ”—</a>neil.haverstick@csst.com (Neil Haverstick)</h3><span>1/21/1996 10:38:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Haverstick here...Matt's post made me think about composition and why I<br>do it.
