It would seem like that<br>would have the most to do with its fingering system, and, best I know, the old<br>so-called Albert fingering system instruments are essentially gone at this point<br>throughout the world.  As far as I know, virtually all modern clarinets are<br>keyed in the Boehm system the entire world over.  <br><br>   That is not true, by the way, of the bassoon, and to a lesser degree not of<br>the oboe.  France, Spain, and a few other countries use a supposedly<br>Boehm-inspired French keying system on their bassoons.  Their bore and reed<br>dimensions, and their overall sound, are also different.  In the case of the<br>oboe, the Conservatory system is pretty much universal, best I know, but there<br>are manual, automatic, and semiautomatic (sounds like a gun eh?!) variants in<br>how they manage its double octave key scheme.  That in particular I imagine<br>would have ramifications effects upon multiphonics.  <br><br>   I understand that recently the flute has seen some enhancements to the now<br>ubiquitous Boehm system, under the heading of the Cooper system, but I don't<br>know the details of that.  <br><br>   Perhaps this fellow is claiming that, despite having the usual Boehm<br>fingering system, there are subtle differences in the dimensions used by his<br>particular German manufacturer that make multiphonics infeasible.  That strikes<br>me as a little surprising, but not impossible.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 16 Sep 1995 20:25 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA26718; Sat, 16 Sep 1995 11:25:28 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 16 Sep 1995 11:25:28 -0700<br>Message-Id: <950916182131_71670.2576_HHB42-6@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>clarinet microtones</h1><h3><a id=2001 href="#2001">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/1995 11:23:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>In the basic sense, I'm kind of surprised by this performer's claim that<br>multiphonics would be impossible on a German clarinet.
