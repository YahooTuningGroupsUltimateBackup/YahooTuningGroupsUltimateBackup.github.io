This is one of those non-auditory, "intellectual", memorization<br>exercises I mentioned earlier.  As powerful as it is to be able to conjure<br>up the sound of any 88CET interval in your mind at will, you still can't<br>tell what E up to G sounds like without the strictly intellectual knowledge<br>of what the interval between those two notes is!<br><br>   Without an octave to organize a tuning around, you have to choose some<br>other interval.  Two intervals stand out as most likely candidates, because<br>they are very intuitively basic to our ears, and because you can build<br>interesting scales around them.  The first such interval is the 3:2 perfect<br>fifth, and the second is the 7:4 subminor seventh.  As you can see from the<br>earlier-presented table of frequency-ratio approximations, in 88CET tuning<br>8 steps forms a perfect fifth, and 11 steps is a subminor seventh.<br><br>   Since this series is not basically about 88CET Music Theory, I'll just<br>say that using those two intervals to form a cyclic scale pattern of<br>2122121 (2 meaning two 88CET steps - a small whole step, and 1 meaning a<br>half step).  This 2122121 pattern repeat in 7:4s rather than octaves,<br>meaning that two As are not octaves 7:4s apart.  The pattern also maps<br>nicely to a traditional piano (or MIDI) keyboard if you imagine away the<br>G#/Ab key, and leave a half-step between G and A:<br><br>                  A#        C#     Eb       Gb<br>               A      B  C      D     E  F      G  A<br><br>On my 88CET MIDI instruments, I make the G#/Ab key play the same pitch as<br>the adjacent A key, but it doesn't really matter, since I never use that<br>key anyway.<br><br>   Perhaps skipping over the G#/Ab key seems odd, but this structure is<br>really a lot more intutive, audibly speaking, than not skipping the G#/Ab<br>key.  The entire 7+5 structure of a traditional keyboard corresponds to a<br>pattern of tritones wrapping within a span of a not-very-accurate neutral<br>seventh (11:6).  Perhaps you'll just have to listen to those two pairs of<br>intervals for yourself, but when you do, I think you'll have to agree that<br>3:2 and 7:4 are much more intuitive, simple, and meaningful to our ears<br>than 10:7 and 11:6!<br><br>   Once you establish this 2122121 pattern, you have a system of<br>"pseudokeys", each with its pseudokey signature.  Then again, they're not<br>like any key signature you've probably ever seen before though!  Although<br>these pseudokeys don't necessarily suggest a tonality (thus "pseudo"keys<br>rather than a true key), it turns out that they can be used that way.  When<br>you do use them to suggest a tonality, you promptly find that related keys,<br>even in as such a nontraditional tuning, are still fifths apart.  Since<br>this scale pattern is cyclic in fifths, you find that related keys have<br>pseudokey signatures that differ by a single sharp or flat.</div><h3><a id=7325 href="#7325">ðŸ”—</a>wauchope@AIC.NRL.Navy.Mil</h3><span>3/30/1998 6:23:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>By "higher bits" I meant the higher precision (finer tuning) bits, so<br>all but one of the remaining bits will always be correct after truncation.<br>It's that highest bit that can be compromised if you don't round off,<br>putting you one tuning step away from the closest possible value.<br><br>For example tuning an 8/5 calls for a pitch bend of +561 (13.7c) which<br>QT would truncate to +544 (32*17), giving you 13.28c.
