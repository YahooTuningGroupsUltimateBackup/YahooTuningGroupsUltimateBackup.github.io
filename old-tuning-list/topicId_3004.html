Todd does excellent work, unfortunately, last I heard<br>was carpal tunnel syndrome had slow his luthiership down to a crawl. In any<br>case, the Strat sounds nothing like a classic Strat now. It got more sustain<br>and timbrally it's much more monochromatic and doesn't have that twang fenders<br>have. The P-bass still sounds and plays like a p-bass. I've lent these<br>instruments to a number of excellent musicians and they really like them,<br>also. The necks also were made with a flat radius.<br><br>I've also got a great double neck Gibson Lee steel guitar form the early 60's<br>(I think from the early 60's) It has an amazingly warm sound. I run it through<br>a Hughes and Kettner Triamp into an old Rodgers tone cabinet (from the 50's I<br>think). The sound is so rich. I've got that thing usually tuned to and open<br>19tet tuning.<br><br>On the synth side of things I've got a Kurzweil K2000 with a sampler. That's<br>also usually tuned to 19tet. It's a great synth but after playing around with<br>it for a couple of years I've got to say that digitally produced synth music<br>leaves me at best luke warm. Even guys that are really excellent with them<br>like Brian Eno and the Orb or Tricky don't produce music with them that I can<br>really totally get into. And this is not a criticism of them at all it's<br>a criticism of the instruments. It's a shame that we don't have acoustic<br>instruments or electro acoustic instruments available to us more readily and<br>ones that are readily playable. In my opinion so much of music has nothing to<br>do with the tuning and has to do with the feel the musician puts behind the<br>notes. Compare the sound of a great digital synth to a Hammond B-3 or a<br>Wurlitzer electric piano and it's dissapointing. The Hammond or Wurlitzer<br>tends to evince musical phrases and nuance but with the Kurzweil I always have<br>felt like I'm sitting behind a glass pane watching music arise in the next<br>room. This, of course, is only my experience.<br><br>I've got bunch of other 12tet instruments but that's for another time.<br><br><br>Denis<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA><br>Subject:  Re: Hexany article, etc.<br>PostedDate:  07-01-98 21:13:05<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  07-01-98 21:12:39-07-01-98 21:12:40,07-01-98 21:12:34-07-01-98 21:12:35<br>DeliveredDate:  07-01-98 21:12:35<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256585.006F038D; Wed, 7 Jan 1998 21:13:02 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01599; Wed, 7 Jan 1998 21:13:05 +0100<br>Date: Wed, 7 Jan 1998 21:13:05 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01560<br>Received: (qmail 16941 invoked from network); 7 Jan 1998 12:13:02 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 7 Jan 1998 12:13:02 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.96.980107143730.24759B-100000@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Microtonal instruments</h1><h3><a id=6965 href="#6965">ðŸ”—</a>Denis.Atadan@mvs.udel.edu</h3><span>1/7/1998 11:51:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>It's been pretty interesting to see who plays what so here's my 2 cents-<br><br>I've got an electric guitar and bass both with warmouth necks in 19tet.
