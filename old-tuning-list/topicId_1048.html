This is more tedious<br>than the global intonation tables because you have to create a keymap for<br>each tuning and instrument.  You can store up to 999 keymaps and instruments<br>in a K2000/K2500.<br><br>You can also retune any instrument using the intonation table.  These tables<br>are limited to 12 note per octave scales.  Note however that the tonic itself<br>can be retuned, making just key modulations possible by selecting a new<br>scale.  Instruments will not glitch or turn off when a new intonation table<br>is selected.  The intonation table is effective globally to all instruments<br>and MIDI channels.  Currently, only new notes will be affected by an<br>intonation table change, not sustaining notes.  You could not use keymap<br>tunings and intonation table tunings realistically at the same time.  You can<br>store up to 255 intonation tables in a K2000/K2500.<br><br>2) The tuning precision is currently limited by software to 1 cent.  It is<br>closer to 1/20th of a cent in the hardware in most situations.  Transposing a<br>sample downwards 4-5 octaves or more reduces the tuning accuracy.<br><br>3) The K2000/K2500 have 16 MIDI channels.  Intonation tables apply to all the<br>channels at the same time.  Keymap tunings apply only to individual<br>instruments.<br><br>4) The Ensoniq EPS/EPS-16+/ASR-10 and Kurzweil K2000/K2500 are the only<br>full-fledged samplers that allow user friendly retuning.   Using an E-mu<br>sampler, for instance, requires creating a sample range for each key and<br>retuning each sample for the individual notes.  Very tedious.  The<br>EPS/EPS-16+/ASR-10 have no internal sounds, unless you count the Flash ROM<br>option for the EPS-16 + (up to 1Mbyte).  The Ensoniqs have 16 MIDI channels<br>but since you can load only 8 instruments at a time you are realistically<br>limited to 8 channels.  The Ensoniqs have an unlimited tuning range per<br>instrument, not limited to 12 note octaves or to the system or MIDI channel. <br>There are 8 pitch tables available per instrument, however, the sysex codes<br>to access them never worked so you're limited to 4 different pitch tables per<br>instrument by using the patch select buttons.<br><br>There may be a few obsolete (Yamaha, Peavey, etc.) and current (General<br>Music?) synthesizers with microtonal capabilities and small RAM options,<br>probably 2 Mbyte or less.
