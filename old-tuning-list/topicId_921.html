After<br>listening for a couple of seconds to the recorded message, I<br>immediately hung up.  I called my wife to see if she was playing a joke<br>and discovered the following:  There is a pager scam going on right<br>now.  Someone is sending pages to get folks to dial a # that costs $25<br>just to dial.  There is no warning so we had better get the news out to<br>everyone ASAP. The number is 809-404-5468.  Don't call it!<br><br>----- End Included Message -----<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 25 Sep 1996 10:24 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA21974; Wed, 25 Sep 1996 03:24:19 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA25750<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id SAA01520; Tue, 24 Sep 1996 18:24:16 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 24 Sep 1996 18:24:16 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199609250122.SAA01424@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Pager Scam</h1><h3><a id=3668 href="#3668">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/1996 8:03:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I hope you all will please forgive me for sending something over the tuning<br>list that is clearly not tuning-related.
