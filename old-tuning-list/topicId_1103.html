At least that is a scheme I remember someone<br>> proposed somewhere.  This seems to me quite a general technique that<br>> doesn't tie me to one machine. <br><br>   I know what you mean about it not tying you to one machine.  In two very<br>different ways though, it does tie you to one machine.  <br>1.  It pretty much ties you to one timbre since 12 (presumably you'd do all 12<br>    pitch classes) of your 16 channels will be tied up to play a single <br>    timbre.  Now I'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with composing<br>    in one or two timbres of course, but that is a limitation, be it desirable <br>    or not.  <br>2.  As far as I can tell from the MIDI spec, there is no standard amount of <br>    pitch deflection that a give amount of change in pitch-wheel value should<br>    produce.  I would not be surprised if there is a defacto standard, perhaps<br>    whatever the DX-7 does or something to that effect.  Similarly, I know of <br>    no guarantee that all instruments will bend pitch consistently with each<br>    other.  By that I mean that, best I can tell from the MIDI spec alone at<br>    least, some instruments could bend pitch in proportion to frequency, some<br>    in proportion to log frequency, and some in proportion to period, if they<br>    so desire.  Again, there may be a defacto standard that will save you.  <br><br>   Perhaps somebody will correct me if I'm wrong.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 6 Nov 1996 19:52 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05892; Wed, 6 Nov 1996 19:53:24 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05887<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id KAA08520; Wed, 6 Nov 1996 10:53:18 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 6 Nov 1996 10:53:18 -0800<br>Message-Id: <327F7DA6.3B43@mbox.vol.it><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3942 href="#3942">ðŸ”—</a>bf250@freenet.carleton.ca (John Sankey)</h3><span>11/6/1996 2:08:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Gary is correct in that the multi-channel technique I use reduces<br>the number of timbres available.

At least that is a scheme I remember someone<br>> proposed somewhere.  This seems to me quite a general technique that<br>> doesn't tie me to one machine. <br><br>   I know what you mean about it not tying you to one machine.  In two very<br>different ways though, it does tie you to one machine.  <br>1.  It pretty much ties you to one timbre since 12 (presumably you'd do all 12<br>    pitch classes) of your 16 channels will be tied up to play a single <br>    timbre.  Now I'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with composing<br>    in one or two timbres of course, but that is a limitation, be it desirable <br>    or not.  <br>2.  As far as I can tell from the MIDI spec, there is no standard amount of <br>    pitch deflection that a give amount of change in pitch-wheel value should<br>    produce.  I would not be surprised if there is a defacto standard, perhaps<br>    whatever the DX-7 does or something to that effect.  Similarly, I know of <br>    no guarantee that all instruments will bend pitch consistently with each<br>    other.  By that I mean that, best I can tell from the MIDI spec alone at<br>    least, some instruments could bend pitch in proportion to frequency, some<br>    in proportion to log frequency, and some in proportion to period, if they<br>    so desire.  Again, there may be a defacto standard that will save you.  <br><br>   Perhaps somebody will correct me if I'm wrong.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 6 Nov 1996 19:52 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05892; Wed, 6 Nov 1996 19:53:24 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05887<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id KAA08520; Wed, 6 Nov 1996 10:53:18 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 6 Nov 1996 10:53:18 -0800<br>Message-Id: <327F7DA6.3B43@mbox.vol.it><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3942 href="#3942">ðŸ”—</a>bf250@freenet.carleton.ca (John Sankey)</h3><span>11/6/1996 2:08:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Gary is correct in that the multi-channel technique I use reduces<br>the number of timbres available.
