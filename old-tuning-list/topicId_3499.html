As Gary Morrison points out...<br><br>>>Admittedly, 2 is a very special prime number,<br>>>in that it is the only one which is even (not odd), so<br>>>most likely, this fact can go a long way to explain<br>>>why we hear these similarities.<br>><br>>You think so?  2 is the only prime that's even, but is that really all<br>that >important?  3 is the only prime that's a multiple of 3, and 5 is the<br>only >prime that's a multiple of 5.<br><br>..this even applies to factors of 2.  That we consider intervals related<br>by factors of 2 to be more or less equivalent most of the time supports the<br>idea that prime-limit interval groups (not odd-limit, since 2 is even)<br>share subjective qualities.  Against this, Paul E. argues...<br><br>>"An arbitrary power of two produces an effect of equivalence." This must<br>>of course include the case where the power is zero, and the equivalence<br>>is greatest. The equivalence evidently falls off as the power increases.<br>><br>>But what about steely coldness? Is it there when the power is zero? Does<br>>a unison contain all potential interval qualities, to a greater degree<br>>than the intervals themselves? It would seem hard to argue that way.<br><br>..And I wonder if he is talking powers or factors.  Factors are involved<br>in the ratio of frequencies in a given interval, and powers are involved in<br>the stacking of any interval.  The idea is that adding a factor of 2 to an<br>interval produces a new interval with a certain "sameness" to the first,<br>because 2 is the "sameness factor".  And stacking any interval will produce<br>a new interval with a certain "sameness" to the first, simply because<br>stacking doesn't add any new factors of any kind. <br><br>If he's means what he says ("powers"), then his first paragraph is correct,<br>but his second is not, as "steely coldness" is an attribute of the factor<br>3, not the power 3.<br><br>If he means factors instead of "powers", then I suppose his whole thing is<br>correct.  Although I do not see why he insists on making the unison into<br>some kind of "white light", I am willing to oblige.  As far as factor<br>determines which partials line up, and all of the partials in a unison line<br>up, the analogy holds...<br><br>2 - sameness<br>3 - steely coldness<br>5 - sweetness<br>7 - flourescent lightingness<br>[etc]<br><br>Now since we've brought stacking up, I've said I agree with his first<br>paragraph (taken as writen ) in that equivalence does fall off as you<br>stack.  Paul offers...<br><br>>There seems to be a pervasive (mis)conception that, for<br>>example, an 81/64 pythagorean major third has some of the<br>>"strong/steely" characteristics of the perfect fifth and fourth, while<br>>the 5/4 just major third has a different, "sweet/emotional" character.<br>>Supposedly, this is due to the "character" of the prime numbers 3 and 5,<br>>respectively.<br><br>..except the particular example of 81/64 does not involve enough stackings<br>to take away the "3-ness" of the interval.  I don't know how many stacking<br>ya need, and it's probably different for every listener, for every timbre,<br>for every limit and for every musical context.  But if I'm breathing, I'm<br>not at a loss to hear the "3-ness" in the 81/64 or the "5-ness" in the 5/4.<br><br>Although Paul E. adds...<br><br>>To me, this sounds preposterous, as there seems to be no<br>>mechanism or reason for the auditory system to be performing prime<br>>factorizations.<br><br>..I doubt the current understanding of the auditory system (or, more<br>likely to be needed, the cognitive system that interprets the data) is<br>sufficient to declare the existence or non-existence of such a mechanism.<br>Talk of chaos theory notconvincing.<br><br>So, with the "ness" of the prime, non-odd 2 firmly in hand, we can get back<br>to the original point, shunning interval acoustics in favor of describing<br>music.  We have the fact that no stacking (powers) of an interval will<br>change the prime factors of the interval.  It will change the odd factors,<br>however.  That's the point.  Why is it musically significant?  Because in<br>music, we stack intervals.  And here's how it works.<br><br>Mideval music choral music has ratios of 3 and 9, but not of 5 or 7.  So is<br>it 9-limit?  Now you might say that we can just as well have music with 7's<br>and no 5's, creating an ill-defined prime limit.  And true, we can have<br>such a music, but we don't.  Except for isolated experiments with<br>fixed-pitch instruments (I believe Fokker did work with such tunings),<br>music has evolved by prime limit.  Pull out a CD of English tudor music, as<br>sung by the King's Singers, for example, and try to add the 7's.  You<br>won't.  They didn't, not for hundreds of years.  They've got ratios of 25<br>and everything else needed to modulate around the 5-limit, throwing commas<br>around like frisbees, but no 7's.  Barbershop's got 7's and 28's, and 63's<br>a-plenty.  And 9's, and 18's, and 27's.  But no 11's.  Never will you hear<br>an 11 used harmonically in Barbershop music.  And the first time you do,<br>you'll be hearing them again soon and often :~)<br><br>And that's the case for prime limit.  It's good because it describes music<br>made in JI.<br><br>~~~~~<br>(b)<br>~~~~~<br><br>In root of two equal temperaments, stacking CHANGES THE INTERVALS.  Except<br>when dealing with 2's, becuase they're just.  This means odds are  all fair<br>play.  Witness Paul Hahn's measurement of level 2 and greater consistency:<br>far from meaning he's on the "other side", it only makes sense at an odd<br>limit.<br><br>Because ET's make every interval in all the modes available to the 1/1<br>(like a tonality diamond does in Just Intonation), you can measure lots of<br>intervals just by looking at the primary intervals in each limit.  Say<br>you've got good 3/2's and good 7/4's, you can bet you'll have good 7/6's<br>too.  But that doesn't make the 6-7-9 triads consistant; there could be a<br>better 9/7 that isn't 3/2 minus 7/6.  So you need seperate consistency<br>measurements at both the 3 and 9 limits.<br><br>The reason, I suspect, that Paul Erlich fights for odd limits: He is a man<br>of equal temperaments :~)  The idea that 9's do not become harmonically<br>significan't until we have 7's does not hold in my experience.  Try playing<br>just 4-5-6-8-9 chords and see if the 9 doesn't serve the same purpose as it<br>does in a 4-5-6-7-8-9 chord.  I use lots of 9 in my 12-tone compositions<br>because it's so well represented in 12.
