I'm sending some off to local radio stations <br>(and Doctor Demento for my cuts) and I would be really surprised if we <br>don't get quite a bit of airplay. <br><br>John Starrett<br>http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Forum CD</h1><h3><a id=8522 href="#8522">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/26/1998 10:39:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>All-<br>	I just got my copy of the tuning forum CD that Neil Haverstick <br>produced, and it is really strong!
