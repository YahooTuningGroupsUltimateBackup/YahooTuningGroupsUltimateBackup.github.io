Long time listener, first time caller.<br><br>I'm hoping someone on the list can answer some gear questions for me.  I<br>have been working with the old Ensoniq EPS 16+ for some time now and am<br>quite comfortable with manipulating its tuning tables.  I am, however<br>being seduced by the sexy new ASR-X.  Its expandable to 34megs of sample<br>ram and has an on board synth.  What's really cool though, are the<br>alternate tunings built into it.  I didn't count them, but a brief glance<br>at the manual showed dozens.  Included were most of the popular ETs -<br>19,31,53 and many of the Carlos tunings.  Hell, even 88cet was in there<br>(kudos Gary) but I digress...Anyway, here is my problem:<br>For those of us who like to "roll their own" scales how easy is this<br>beast to work with.  What little I could infer from the manual stated<br>that you could have one user programmed scale at a time reside in RAM,<br>BUT it had to be done via a computer using the midi tuning standard.  My<br>questions:<br>Is this a good thing?  How does the resolution compare?  I've never<br>worked with the midi tuning standard so i'm clueless.  And finally, is<br>there a way to use more than one tuning at once, especially the user<br>programmed ones (oh, and what kind of computer program will I need).<br>The beauty of the previous generation of samplers (EPS, 16+, ASR10) was<br>that you could have many different scales reside in memory at the same<br>time.  And for someone like me( who is the self proclaimed village idiot<br>of micro tonality) this was great for comparing scales (it just doesn't<br>sink in when I read it, I have to hear the pitches and putz around with<br>them.  I guess it's a drummer thang...).  <br> Are the tunings from my EPS16+ upwardly compatible.
