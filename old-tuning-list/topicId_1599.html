There are instead three<br>separate mechanisms that you have to learn and apply separately.  The going<br>answer seems to be that these things are easy:<br>1. Tuning the interval between all adjacent keys equally to any multiple of<br><br>   2 cents.  All adjacent keys <br>2. Tuning the twelve notes of each C-C octave identically to just about <br>   anything.  Switching off between several such tables with SysEx messages<br>   is also easy.  These are strictly 12-tone tables though, and repeat only<br>   in exact octaves.  <br>3. Using a Max patch to retune every note on the fly according to what<br>might<br>   be called a "sample and hold" controller.  (It memorizes the<br>most-recently<br>   set value to ... I think it's something like controller #25 ... and you <br>   can then adjust a note's pitch based upon that.  It's sort of like pitch<br>   bend except that it has no effect upon notes already playing)<br><br>   Doing #1 to a finer resolution is also possible, but much more<br>difficult.  That is what you'd want if you wanted, for example, to map<br>19-tone equal-temperament linearly, meaning note-for-note/key-for-key<br>across the keyboard, mismatching octave boundaries of the tuning with<br>octave boundaries on the keyboard.  <br><br>   From what I've heard, I doubt if there's any way to tuning a K2x00 like<br>Partch's Chromelodeon, which uses an irregular spacing between keys<br>spanning across an octave of 43 keys.  Or similarly, my mapping for 88CET<br>tuning, wherein I use a linear, key-for-key/note-for-note mapping except<br>that I omit the G#/Ab key from that setup.  (Or to put it another way, the<br>gap between all pairs of adjacent keys is 88 cents, except that G#/Ab key<br>is tuned to the same pitch as its adjacent A key.)  That mapping would<br>probably not be possible on the K2x00, except through external computer<br>assistance (#3 above).  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 29 Jan 1997 21:28 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA18957; Wed, 29 Jan 1997 21:28:38 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA18907<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id MAA23187; Wed, 29 Jan 1997 12:25:33 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 29 Jan 1997 12:25:33 -0800<br>Message-Id: <93970129171339/0005695065PK4EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Cheap Explorations -- the Temporary Guitar</h1><h3><a id=4689 href="#4689">ðŸ”—</a>Steven Rezsutek &#x3C;steve@synapse.gsfc.nasa.gov&#x3E;</h3><span>1/27/1997 9:21:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>It was a busy weekend for me, but I now have a microtonal instrument<br>that is a bit less unwieldy than my keyboard.
