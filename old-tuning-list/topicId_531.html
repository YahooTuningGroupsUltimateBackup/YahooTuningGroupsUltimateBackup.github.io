I know that the "melody line" of each .mid is<br>repetitive, but I had to keep it that way, to change only one variable. The<br>whole point is to compare the sound, or mood, of each scales. I did not try<br>to show you which chord is best to harmonize a nTET melody, I wanted to show<br>you how each scale approximates members of the harmonic serie. The scales<br>are all ET's (for now), from 1TET to 21TET. I will post a notice on the list<br>when I write another lot. I intend to write all ET's up to 48, and will<br>accept your suggestions for any 'typical' just or njnet scale. If you think<br>you can help me improve the structure or content of each files, or if you<br>find errors, email me.<br><br>I would like to organize a GT for the North England region. All we hear<br>about on the list is Brian McLaren this, Brian that. He is a brilliant<br>musician, but he is the only one who talks! (this is exagerated, but you get<br>the point. We should all be posting to the list.) I'm 19/m, I live in<br>Quebec, I think the best place to meet would be Albany, NY. Anyway, all<br>those interested should send me a email, stating where you live and your<br>disponibilities for July-August 96. I will try to triangulate the* best<br>place for all of us. It will be up the person living closest to this meeting<br>point to find us a place to meet (a restaurant, whatever).<br><br>-Kami<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 2 Jul 1996 17:19 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA04682; Tue, 2 Jul 1996 08:19:24 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 2 Jul 1996 08:19:24 -0700<br>Message-Id: <1.5.4b12.32.19950702151252.00679bc0@interlinx.qc.ca><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Web page, Get together</h1><h3><a id=3142 href="#3142">ðŸ”—</a>Kami Rousseau &#x3C;kami@interlinx.qc.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/1996 8:01:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I would like to invite you all to check my homepage,<br>http://www.interlinx.qc.ca/~kami/<br><br>I wrote MIDI files that demonstrate the chromatic scale, trill and chord (up<br>to the "13th OTonal chord").
