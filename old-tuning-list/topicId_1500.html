I would define the limit as the largest<br>odd <br>> number that occurs in ratios that are considered consonant. <br><br>   I certainly agree with Dan Wolf that we ought to use the definition from<br>the person who coined the term, that being Harry Partch.  I was under the<br>apparently false impression that he defined it in terms of primes rather<br>than odds.  I confess that I have only read Genesis of a Music in<br>fragments, so I have every reason to believe that Dan Wolf must be correct<br>and I'm not.  <br><br>   But regardless of the definition of "limit", there are definitely two<br>different schools of thought here.  The premise that odd numbers rather<br>than primes outline various classes of harmony is based on the<br>well-accepted fact that octaves, or stacks of octaves, produce a sensation<br>of duplication, like that of a major tenth being practically the same<br>harmony as a major third.  <br><br>   Clearly then even whole numbers, all of which produce "octave<br>duplicates" of an odd number's harmonics, can have no<br>practically-meaningful effect on harmony.  Or to put it another way,<br>putting a single two into the product forming a numerator or denominator is<br>as good as putting in as many as you'd like.  <br><br>   The case for prime numbers rather than odds outlining new harmonies is<br>based on the idea that stacks of ANY small whole number produce similar<br>effects.  That is to say that, multiplying in one of three, for example, is<br>"as good" as adding in any number of threes.  <br><br>   That is not, however, in the sense that threes create a sense of<br>duplication like an octave, but that they create another characteristic<br>sensation.  As I understand it anyway, the more or less accepted<br>characteristic for three is that of a cold, logical simplicity, as<br>evidenced in the character of P4s and P5s.  <br><br>   Based upon this premise, then clearly the elements of sort of<br>classification are primes.  That in the sense that multiplying by a<br>composite is the same as multiplying by a product of primes, bringing in<br>each of their effects into the soup.  <br><br>   And the idea continues from there, again, as I understand it:<br> 2:  Duplication (i.e., pitch classing)<br> 3:  Cold, logical simplicity<br> 5:  Sweetness<br> 7:  A kind of Bluesy "Zap"<br>11:  Ambiguity, lost-in-space sensation<br><br>   My own personal opinion is that the prime approach is correct at its<br>root, but vastly oversimplified, and even still the biggest factor<br>determining the character of a chord is its width.  By that I mean that,<br>for example, M3s of ANY formulation are going to have a more similar<br>musical effect than any of them will have to a m7 for example.  I base that<br>statement partly on comparing the sensation of 27:16 and 5:3 M6s.  5:3<br>definitely has a sweetness that I don't hear in 27:16, regardless of their<br>similar size.  <br><br>   The oversimplification in the prime idea appears to be this:  The<br>ability to stack up an arbitrary number of any particular prime without<br>fundamentally changing the basic nature of the harmony, decreases rapidly<br>as you go up the series of primes.  <br><br>   By that I mean that you can stack up plenty of octaves before you break<br>two's characteristic sensation of duplication, but you can only stack a<br>handful of threes before you lose three's sensation of cold logic.  You can<br>probably only stack two or so fives before you lose its sense of sweetness.<br> You can only do one 7 or 11 best I can tell, meaning that 49 and 121 don't<br>carry on the sensation of 7 and 11 (respectively) at all.  I personally<br>have very little feel for 13, although certain Mayumi and Johnny Reinhard<br>to.  <br><br>   I suspect that this case of (more or less) diminishing returns is a<br>consequence of the size of the numbers in the ratio.  Generally speaking,<br>the larger the size of the numbers, the more difficult it is to associate a<br>characteristic feel to that harmony, and the greater the chances that<br>they'll be viewed instead as an out-of-tune rendition of a simpler pitch<br>relationship.<br><br>   From what I've seen, to find a distinct character to a ratio whose<br>numbers are larger than somewhere around 50 starts to become limited to<br>very specialized circumstances, like long sustained notes, harmonic or<br>melodic (but not both) presentation, carefully-chosen pitch ranges, pure<br>timbres, very little vibrato or other forms of fluctuation, and such.  I<br>can recall at least one episode where I could not attribute a character to<br>an interval - curiously I don't recall the interval other than that it was<br>fairly complex - wherein I had to resort to something like five minutes of<br>side-by-side comparison to the simpler interval that it sounded like an<br>out-of-tune rendition of.  That's obviously far beyond any realistic<br>expectation of an audience get excited about in a truly musical performance<br>situation!  <br><br>   That ease also depends on how wide in the big sense the interval is.  I<br>find it much more difficult to attribute a clear musical sensation to<br>intervals between a triple- and quadruple-octave than those between a<br>unison and an octave.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 5 Jan 1997 22:20 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA02046; Sun, 5 Jan 1997 22:23:16 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA02044<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id NAA25890; Sun, 5 Jan 1997 13:23:01 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 5 Jan 1997 13:23:01 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701051618_MC2-E48-35DC@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4572 href="#4572">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/1997 7:07:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Yes, Marion McCoskey (I think I got his last name right) uses LCM as a<br>measure of ... well, maybe not exactly dissonance ... but perhaps something<br>like "harmonic complexity".
