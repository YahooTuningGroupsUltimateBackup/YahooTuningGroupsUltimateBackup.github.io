Suddenly,<br>the "universally acknowledged" great composer<br>of the Baroque was someone different--someone<br>few average folks had heard of.<br>Around 1826, the "universally acknowledged canon<br>of Western musical masterworks" ran something<br>like this: Palestrina's motets and masses, <br>Haydn's symphonies &  quartets, Beethoven's<br>symphonies and quartets, Bach's fugues & organ<br>music, the piano sonatas and symphonies of<br>Spohr, Hanon and Czerny.<br>Mozart wasn't on the chart.  Nobody had heard of <br>Purcell other than a few antiquarian specialists. <br>Names like Ockeghem and Binchois and Jehan<br>Suzay and Baude Cordier were regarded as<br>mere curiosities...just as we regard Spohr,<br>Hanon and Czerny today.<br>Let's fast-forward to 1896.  Now the "great"<br>composers are: Bach, Brahms, Beethoven, Mendelssohn,<br>Wagner, Schumann, Chopin, Mozart, Saint-Saens, Gounod,<br>D'Indy, Cesar Franck, Richard Strauss, & of course Mahler.<br>Gosh.<br>The list has changed, hasn't it? <br>Names like Ravel and Debussy are oddly missing.<br>In fact, in musical textbooks as late as the 1920s<br>you can read that Debussy "certainly produced very<br>tuneful music, but he could not be called a great<br>composer."  Ravel was popular but not yet a "great<br>composer." The Mexican composers Chavez and<br>Falla weren't on the charts.<br>Let's fast-forward to 1926.<br>Suddenly those "great composers" Gounod and Faure<br>& D'Indy & Franck are gone.  They're minor footnotes.  <br>Suddenly Bach is "the greatest" of greats. The "great"<br>American composers are obvious: Edward Macdowell,<br>Charles Griffes, George Antheil, John Alden Carpenter.<br>But Charles Ives isn't even on the radar scope: ditto Carl<br>Ruggles. Gershwin is a schmuck pop composer, not<br>worthy of consideration by lovers of "serious" music.<br>Now let's move ahead to 1946:<br>Sudden Wagner has become invisible. But now<br>the harpsichord  revival has begun, and with it a <br>host of strange new  names who (it is suddenly  <br>discovered) are also  "great composers:" Girolamo <br>Frescobaldi, Diderik  Buxtehude, Giovanni Gabrieli, <br>Domenico Scarlatti. Of European composers,  the<br>"greatest" are Paul Hindemith and Igor Stravinsky.<br>The "great  American composers"  in 1946 were <br>well known by all--William Schuman, Roy Harris, <br>Roger Sessions, Randall Thompson, Walter Piston,<br>Wallingford Riegger, Carl Ruggles.<br>But now  George Antheil, John Alden Carpenter and<br>Charles Griffes have disappeared.<br>Let's fast-forward to 1966.<br>*Big* change. <br>Now Mozart is "greater" than any other "great"<br>composer--he's suddenly the greatest composer of<br>all (although a nonentity in the 1820s).  Brahms<br>in on the wane. Wagner and Mahler and Richard <br>Strauss have largely vanished, except for lip <br>service. Telemann has been rehabitated;<br>now he's a "great composer," ditto Vivaldi.<br>But Mendelssohn, Schumann, Scriabin, et al. are now<br>footnotes. <br>Aaron Copland has vanished--too tonal. Roy Harris<br>and Wallingford Riegger and Walter Piston are<br>gone.  Roger Sessions is barely visible, mainly because<br>of his later serial compositions. Paul Hindemith<br>is treated like the Ebola virus. But Charles Ives<br>is suddenly a "great composer."<br>And now there are a host of new "great composers:"<br>Schoenberg, Berg, Webern, Stockhausen, Boulez,<br>Cage.  These "great  composers" replace<br>the former cadre of "great composers:"<br>William Schuman, Roy Harris, Roger Sessions, Randall<br>Thompson, Walter Piston. The list of "great" <br>composers sure changes a lot, doesn't it?<br>Now let's fast-forward to 1996:<br>Schoenberg is being attacked daily in books like <br>"Schoenberg's Error" by Thompson (1992).  Berg and<br>Webern are still "great" composers, although their<br>music is very seldom played.  Stockhausen and Boulez<br>and Cage have vanished from the concert halls.<br>Instead, we have a new set of "great" composers--<br>except now they're an *old* set of "great" American<br>composers: Roy Harris,  William Schuman, Aaron <br>Copland, Carl Ruggles...all nonentities in 1966.<br>So what have we got here?<br>Is it not apparent that there is no uniform<br>canon of "musical masterpieces"?<br>It is not obvious that composers come into<br>fashion in one generation, go out of fashion in<br>another generation, come back into fashion,<br>then go out of fashion again...ad infinitum?<br>Georg Muffat was considered a great composer<br>who produced masterpieces in the late 17th<br>century.  If you mentioned "Apparatus Musico-<br>Organisticus" around 1700, anyone who knew<br>anything about "real" music would tell you it<br>was one of the greatest sets of compositions<br>in European history.<br>By 1850, Georg Muffat was out of fashion. If you<br>had mentioned "Apparatus Musico-Organisticus" <br>you'd get a strange look.<br>By 1950, Georg Muffat was a great composer again.<br>By 2050, will Georg Muffat be out of fashion?<br>Who knows?<br>But I'll give you 3-to-1 odds.<br>My point, simply, is that the idea of a uniform<br>canon of "recognized masterpieces" is a bizarre<br>notion concocted as best I can determine by<br>concert managers and symphony boards of <br>directors.  <br>Quite a few members of the younger generation <br>(like, say, moi) consider Mozart a no-talent <br>Muzak specialist [a superb technician, a godawful<br>musician] and Jehan Suzay and Petrus de Doldescalc <br>and Guillaume Binchois and Guillaume Dufay and<br>Josquin de Pres and Johannes Ockeghem to be<br>an apex of western music far more interesting<br>than the irremediable musical  desert between<br>1790 and 1890 (except for Beethoven and Saint-<br>Saens and Schubert, perhaps).<br>I've asked around among my friends, and most of<br>'em share my opinion--you could flush out 90%<br>of the 19th century like sewage and we wouldn't<br>miss it.  The 14th through the 18th centuries,<br>however were chock full of superb music, and<br>1890 through 1930 and about 1978 through the<br>present were also extremely fertile eras.<br>The point is, in today's ultraconnected Internet<br>media-soaked speed-of-light CD-ROM-archived<br>xerox-crazy fax-and-scanner world, the idea<br>that there is any ONE single "recognized canon"<br>of Western musical masterworks just doesn't<br>wash.<br>Nowadays, we all *create our own* musical<br>realities. <br>I have friends who can give chapter & verse on<br>the kinds of effects boxes Jimi Hendrix used, and <br>they "know" that the period from 1957-1969 is the<br>apex of Western music.  They compare notes,<br>and they all pretty much have the same "canon"<br>of musical "masterworks."<br>Other friends, who happen to be rabid xenharmonists,<br>"know" that an entirely different (and very strange) canon<br>of "recognized" musical "masterworks" is the TRUE<br>corpus of Great Western Music--yet their list of<br>"great" music is entirely different from the (to me) utterly<br>bizarre "canon" of "great" musical "masterworks" adored<br>by the age-55-age-75 crowd (3 B's, Mozart, Hanon, Czerny,<br>Faure, Carl Maria von Weber, Edward Elgar)...<br>And so it goes.<br>As we head for the 21st century at the speed of light,<br>the music departments of universities need to wake<br>up and realize that there's a very real question<br>as to whether colleges will even *exist* in any<br>recognizable fashion in 20 years. <br>In such a fluid globally connected Internet world,<br>everyone creates hi/r own informational reality...<br>And the notion of a single "canon" of recognized<br>Western musical "masterworks" just begins to<br>look like a bizarre hallucination.<br>To base university music curricula on such a<br>chimera seems the ultimate in faulty logic. Thus<br>I can see no reason whatever for college music<br>departments to fail to include the harmonic series,<br>the history of tuning, etc. in the curriculum--especially<br>when great works of music from prior eras (like<br>Johann Kuhnau's "Combat of David and Goliath,"<br>which deliberately uses the meantone wolf notes<br>in the "battle" section) cannot even be understood<br>without some consideration of the tuning involved.<br>--mclaren <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 9 Jul 1996 01:48 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id QAA01917; Mon, 8 Jul 1996 16:48:28 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 8 Jul 1996 16:48:28 -0700<br>Message-Id: <63960708234536/0005695065PK4EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>New Post from McLaren</h1><h3><a id=3177 href="#3177">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/1996 1:52:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: The idea of a "canon of recognized<br> masterworks" of Western music<br>--<br>Enrique Moreno with great acumen<br>pointed out that one of the greatest<br>obstacles to the adoption of microtonal<br>ideas (viz., the harmonic series as a<br>basis for music theory) in higher education<br>is that it would require music teachers<br>to throw overboard the "recognized"<br>canon of Western musical "masterworks."<br>This is a very convincing argument, until<br>you realize that there's no such thing.<br>Semiotics and sociology have taught us to<br>view critically institutions which purport<br>to purvey the truth.
