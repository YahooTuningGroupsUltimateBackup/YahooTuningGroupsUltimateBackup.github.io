Doing a bit of "free association", I recall working=<br> with a=0Agraduate student working with synthesized flute timbres based o=<br>n analysis of=0Arecorded flute notes played into a microphone (mono) and =<br>converted to 16 bit=0Asigned integer samples through a A/D converter at a=<br> 40 KHz sampling rate.<br><br>Although for the particular note - a D4 - we were working with the fifth=<br>=0Apartial was very prominent, we didn't hear it distinctly as a tone in =<br>its own=0Aright within the overall sound of the flute D4.  However, when =<br>I artificially=0Astrengthened that partial individually among the other p=<br>artials forming the=0Atotal sound, leaving the other partials as they had=<br> been (based on additive=0Aresynthesis of an analyzed flute note), we cou=<br>ld hear that partial's F#6 sound=0Aseparate from the overall sound.  Then=<br>, if we listened for it, we could=0Awithout difficulty hear the 5th parti=<br>al's F#6 tone individually within the=0Aoriginal accurately resynthesized=<br> flute note and I believe within the=0Arecording of the original flute no=<br>te (I'm not sure we tested that, but in any=0Acase those two sounds were =<br>very close - nearly indistinguishable and that=0Abeing the case it would =<br>seem unlikely that if the fifth partial could be=0Adistinguished in the a=<br>dditively resynthesized sound, it would be=0Aindistinguishable within the=<br> original recorded sound).<br><br>Thus when we listen to a sound, depending on the mind set with which we l=<br>isten=0Ato it, we may hear - very clearly and fully - a "whole" or "gesta=<br>lt" sound, or=0Awe may hear a "composite" sound within which, along side =<br>the "gestalt", we=0Aperceive individual "component" sounds.  I guess this=<br> isn't utterly different=0Ain essence from listening to a chord sung or p=<br>layed on a piano or other=0Amusical instrument - we easily hear the indiv=<br>idual notes of the chord, while=0Aat the same time we experience an effec=<br>t of the chord also as, in a way, a=0Asingle "gestalt".  However in the c=<br>ase of the chord, we tend to be much more=0Aaware of the individual compo=<br>nents of the chord and don't habitually think of=0Athe chord as a single =<br>entity in the same way we would think of a flute note=0Awithin which we c=<br>an, it we try to do it, distinguish individual component=0Atones and hear=<br> them as distinct from the overall sound of the note, which we=0Anormally=<br> hear as a single entity.<br><br>Another example of this is the case of listening to a piano note, note pa=<br>ir,=0Aetc.  There's a lot of beating going on - even if one stops all but=<br> one single=0Astring of a unison bank and the damper pedal is up so that =<br>all the other=0Astrings of the piano are mostly damped, frequently one ca=<br>n hear "false beats"=0Ain that single string.  I'm not a piano tuner - I =<br>admire them and may become=0Aone - and when my piano tuner hits note pair=<br>s and tells me he is listening to=0Awhat, say, the fourth partial is doin=<br>g, I feel a sense of frustration because=0AI am not hearing perceptively =<br>what he is hearing.  (Based on my experience=0Awith other things, I belie=<br>ve that if I made an effort - really applied myself=0Ato it - I could lea=<br>rn to hear the things he's listening for).  The point is=0Athat the "soun=<br>d behind the sound" of a piano note, note pair, chord, etc. is a=0Acompos=<br>ite of a great many sounds which might be distinguished within the=0Aover=<br>all sound if one were to focus one's attention in such a way as to=0Adist=<br>inguish a particular one of the many component sounds.<br><br>What this leads me to is an explanation for the fact that a particular tu=<br>ning=0Amay sound reasonably good on one musical instrument while it may s=<br>ound=0Aterrible on another musical instrument.  I'm thinking of my experi=<br>ence with=0Atwo pianos - an older one which I purchased second hand with =<br>a warm, not very=0Abright tone quality, on which I've found sixth comma M=<br>T temperament to sound=0Avery beautiful, if not harmonically clear, and a=<br> more "iron and steel" kind of=0AYamaha upright which I'm renting which h=<br>as a very bright tone quality with a=0Alot of sound in the high frequency=<br> region (I'd guess from 3 KHz up to 10 KHz=0Aor beyond), on which sixth c=<br>omma MT sounds harsh and strained and=0Adisappointing, although EQT sound=<br>s even harsher and "just awful" on that=0Apiano, which nevertheless has a=<br> very beautiful, pleasant, gentle sound in=0Aquarter comma MT.  The effec=<br>t is so striking that one finds it hard to resist=0Abelieving that the Ya=<br>maha engineers did a lot of careful testing of their=0Apiano and designed=<br> it from the ground up as an instrument meant to be tuned to=0Aquarter co=<br>mma MT, never intending that it should be misused by tuning it to=0AEQT. =<br> One could go on speculating that in their inner deliberations, the=0Aeng=<br>ineers and management had come to the conclusion that EQT would be around=<br>=0Afor such a short while longer that they could safely leave it out of t=<br>heir=0Acalculations :)<br><br>It would seem that a tuning such as sixth comma MT, while it will pull th=<br>e=0Abeat frequencies down below the dissonance "threshold" in lower parts=<br> of the=0Aaudio spectrum so that an instrument without an abundance of hi=<br>gh harmonics,=0Abut with quite a lot of sound lower more in the middle of=<br> the audio spectrum,=0Amight benefit greatly as a result of its tuning be=<br>ing changed from EQT to=0Asixth comma MT, will, with a very bright instru=<br>ment having a lot of its sound=0Ain the high frequency region, leave the =<br>dissonance beat frequencies in that=0Ahigh frequency part of the audio sp=<br>ectrum still high enough to be in the Plomp=0Adissonance region for beati=<br>ng frequencies so that the piano still sounds=0Ashrill and harsh even in =<br>sixth comma MT.<br><br>There are quite a few considerations which suggest this explanation.  The=<br>re is=0Aa quotation from around 1876 (I don't recall the source) to the e=<br>ffect that it=0A"takes a really modern piano to show up how bad EQT sound=<br>s".  If the earlier=0Ainstruments were much less bright than the later on=<br>es, it could be that, even=0Ain EQT tuning, they produced much less sound=<br> in frequency ranges where the=0Adissonance beat rates were fast enough t=<br>o be in the unpleasant range - which=0Aalso could help to explain why EQT=<br> gained such widespread acceptance.  We=0Ausually think of the guitar, pa=<br>rticularly a gut or nylon stringed one, as a=0Apleasingly melodious music=<br>al instrument, although until very recently, they=0Ahave been normally tu=<br>ned to EQT.  If the harmonies are not the clearest and=0Apurest, still th=<br>e instrument has a very pleasing sound.  Such nylon stringed=0Aguitars ha=<br>ve a mild not=96bright timbre and the dissonance beatings of EQT seem=0At=<br>o be below the dissonance threshold in the lower frequency ranges where m=<br>ost=0Aof the audio spectral energy of the guitar comes from.<br><br>In the case of the organ, however, particularly one with a bright timbre,=<br> the=0Adissonance beating of EQT will be very prominent.  William Pole re=<br>marked on=0Athe change which retuning from a mean tone temperament (Would=<br> this likely have=0Abeen fifth comma MT?): "The modern practice of tuning=<br> all organs to equal=0Atemperament has been a fearful detriment to their =<br>QUALITY OF TONE.  Under the=0Aold tuning an organ made harmonious and att=<br>ractive music, which it was a=0Apleasure to listen to, even though it mig=<br>ht be interrupted by a "wolf" now and=0Athen.  Now, the harsh thirds, app=<br>lied to the whole instrument=0Aindiscriminately, give it a cacophonous an=<br>d repulsive effect, which people are=0Aglad enough to run away from."  (f=<br>rom his Philosophy of Music 1879 edition, p.=0A153)  Earlier he had writt=<br>en (regarding the equal tempered scale) "...The most=0Aimportant errors a=<br>re those of the (ital.) THIRDS, which are considerably=0Awrong; and it is=<br> undoubtedly the fact that the major third is an interval in=0Aregard to =<br>which, from its prominent place in the major triad (the chord of=0Anature=<br>), the ear is peculiarly sensitive.  ON THE PIANOFORTE THIS IS NOT OF SO=<br>=0AMUCH CONSEQUENCE; but in the organ and harmonium, where the tones are=<br>=0Asustained, a moderately sensitive ear finds the equally=96tempered maj=<br>or third=0Avery harsh and disagreeable."<br><br>Pole finds that EQT doesn't have a seriously detrimental effect on the to=<br>ne=0Aquality of the piano, or he makes this concession re the piano in or=<br>der to=0Agive the impression that he is taking a fair, balanced approach =<br>in the face of=0Acriticism which he likely anticipates from advocates of =<br>EQT, who by 1879 in=0AEngland were increasingly coming to enjoy the taste=<br> of victory in their=0Aefforts to see the elegant, nifty 12 TET scale est=<br>ablished as the single=0Auniversal basis for music.  He attributes this t=<br>o the fact that the piano=0Anotes decay away fairly rapidly.  It seems to=<br> me that the pianos which he was=0Aused to hearing also had timbres which=<br> were much less bright than those of=0Asome of today's pianos.<br><br>I'd like to mention that I can count off at least ten people to whom I've=<br>=0Apresented contrasting examples of music played on the Yamaha upright i=<br>n EQT=0Aand quarter comma MT tuning who have very clearly and definitely =<br>indicated to=0Ame that they found the piano to sound "warmer" in quarter =<br>comma MT, to "sing"=0Ain that tuning.  Some have said that the piano soun=<br>ds like a fine expensive=0Ainstrument in quarter comma MT while it sounds=<br> like a cheap piano when in EQT=0Atuning.  One person writing anonymously=<br> in a listening research test which I=0Agave wrote: "I appreciate the sou=<br>nd of mean tone tuning; it's just different=0Aenough to be almost exotic.=<br>  I think it's just beautiful."  Although not all=0Apeople have agreed wi=<br>th me that there is a dramatic difference between the=0Asound of the pian=<br>o in EQT and in 1/4 comma MT, a great many people have - on=0Athe order o=<br>f half those who have heard the contrasting sounds - more than half=0Aof =<br>those with whom I've discussed the matter personally.<br><br>Getting to the matter of tuning and timbre of the piano, and of the "E=0A=<br>pluribus unum" phenomenon.  When one strikes a note, say a G4, with the p=<br>edal=0Adown - i.e. damper off the other strings, leaving them free to vib=<br>rate along=0Awith the struck bank of three unisons in this case, a very g=<br>reat number of=0Aindividual tones are produced.  First there are the sets=<br> of partials of each=0Aof the three G4 unisons.  Following the striking o=<br>f these strings, perhaps=0Afrom 20 to 30 or more (a third of all the stri=<br>ngs of the piano) strings/sets=0Aof strings are set into vibration, the t=<br>ime courses (amplitude and to some=0Aextent - I think within a range of 2=<br> cents or so - frequency envelopes) of=0Atheir sounds, each being compose=<br>d of a set of partials, being individual to=0Athe particular string.  Bel=<br>ow G4, the G3 string, the C3 string, the G2 string,=0Athe Eb2 string, and=<br> so on down will be set into vibration.  This can be=0Ademonstrated by qu=<br>ietly pressing, say, the C3 note so that its individual=0Adamper is lifte=<br>d off the C3 string pair without these strings being set into=0Avibration=<br>, and then striking the G4 note and releasing the key so that the G4=0Ast=<br>rings are then stopped.  One will continue to hear a reduced G4 tone unti=<br>l=0Aone releases the C3 key.  Above G4, one will be able to hear tones of=<br> variable=0Aloudness depending on tuning when any key for a note whose fu=<br>ndamental=0Afrequency is close to the frequency of one of the G4 partials=<br> is depressed and=0Aheld down and then the G4 is struck and the key for G=<br>4 then released.  Just=0Aplaying around with this roughly, I've found tha=<br>t when the tuned frequency for=0Athe upper string lies within about 5 to =<br>10 cents of the frequency of the lower=0Astring's partial corresponding t=<br>o that string, the upper string will begin to=0Avibrate.  The closer its =<br>tuned frequency to the frequency of an upper partial=0Aof the lower strin=<br>g, the louder will be its sympathetic vibration sound.<br><br>With the piano tuned to quarter comma MT temperament and with my piano tu=<br>ner's=0Ahaving used some "octave stretching" - perhaps amounting to nearl=<br>y 50 cents=0Aover the piano's 7 octave range - less in the piano's middle=<br> range, more at=0Athe low and high ends, I find that there are strong sym=<br>pathetic vibration=0Aresponses for strings at one or more octaves above t=<br>he lower string and for=0Astrings at 2 or 3 octaves plus a third above th=<br>e lower string (eight notes Eb,=0ABb, F, ... to E - no detectable respons=<br>es for notes at "wolf" thirds above B,=0AF#, C#, and G#).  The strings at=<br> 1 and 2 octaves plus a fifth above a lower=0Anote vibrate sympatheticall=<br>y but not very strongly, which seems to result from=0Atheir being tuned (=<br>nominally) 5.4 cents flat from just.  There are strong=0Aresponses for th=<br>e C# and G# strings 2 octaves and a seventh above Eb and Bb=0Arespectivel=<br>y when the latter are struck (nominally 3 cents flat from being=0Ajust 7/=<br>1 s above the lower notes).  With the piano in 12 TET, I have sometimes=<br>=0Afound weak responses for strings two octaves and an EQT (nominally 13.=<br>7 cents=0Asharp from just) major third above lower strings, and sometimes=<br> these=0Aresponses have been too weak for me to detect.<br><br>Well, all this opens up a "world" of things happening in the piano when e=<br>ven=0Aone single note is struck.  It occurs to me also that when strings =<br>are excited=0Ato vibrate in sympathy with a lower string, they in their t=<br>urn, albeit weakly,=0Awill exert some effect on the strings both above an=<br>d below them.<br><br>Even some of the physically low amplitude components of the overall sound=<br> -=0Adown 50 or 60 dB or more - could, depending on exactly where and wha=<br>t they=0Aare, have an appreciable effect on the piano's overall sound.  T=<br>he pattern of=0Athis "cloud" of relatively low amplitude components could=<br> have the effect of=0Acontributing a delightful, difficult=96to=96describ=<br>e, "feel" to the piano's=0Aoverall sound or it could fail to have such a =<br>potentially achievable effect or=0Aeven detract from the pleasantness of =<br>the instrument's sound.<br><br>Your observations re 1/6 comma MT and 1/9 comma MT on the digital piano,=<br>=0AGraham, help to fill in this field of data out of which we're trying t=<br>o=0Adiscern underlying patterns.

Just=0Aplaying around with this roughly, I've found tha=<br>t when the tuned frequency for=0Athe upper string lies within about 5 to =<br>10 cents of the frequency of the lower=0Astring's partial corresponding t=<br>o that string, the upper string will begin to=0Avibrate.  The closer its =<br>tuned frequency to the frequency of an upper partial=0Aof the lower strin=<br>g, the louder will be its sympathetic vibration sound.<br><br>With the piano tuned to quarter comma MT temperament and with my piano tu=<br>ner's=0Ahaving used some "octave stretching" - perhaps amounting to nearl=<br>y 50 cents=0Aover the piano's 7 octave range - less in the piano's middle=<br> range, more at=0Athe low and high ends, I find that there are strong sym=<br>pathetic vibration=0Aresponses for strings at one or more octaves above t=<br>he lower string and for=0Astrings at 2 or 3 octaves plus a third above th=<br>e lower string (eight notes Eb,=0ABb, F, ... to E - no detectable respons=<br>es for notes at "wolf" thirds above B,=0AF#, C#, and G#).  The strings at=<br> 1 and 2 octaves plus a fifth above a lower=0Anote vibrate sympatheticall=<br>y but not very strongly, which seems to result from=0Atheir being tuned (=<br>nominally) 5.4 cents flat from just.
