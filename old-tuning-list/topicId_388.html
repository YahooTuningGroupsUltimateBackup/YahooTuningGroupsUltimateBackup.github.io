Positive fifths are thus those<br>that are sharper than 700 cents, negative, less than 700 and positive <br>systems are those with positive fifths, etc. <br> <br>I think that J. M. Barbour was so committed to 12-tet that it is <br>not surprising that he sometimes thought of the perfect fifth as <br>having 700 cents. Thus, I view his definition of positive as sharper <br>than 3:2 rather than 7 degrees of 12-tet as a lapse, not a fundamental misunderstanding.  BTW, he did grudgingly admit that a piece by Bach<br>sounded magnificent in the 1/6th comma "meantone" tuning (notes to the<br>Musurgia series of didactic recordings he and Kuttner put put in the<br>60's).<br> <br>As for "doubly positive," see pages 60-63 of Bosanquet. _"A regular cyclic<br>system is of the rth order, negative or positive, if 12 fifths fall short <br>or exceed 7 octaves by r degrees of the system"_. Hence for 22-tet, <br>12 x 13 = 156  (12 x the 22-tet fifth) is two degrees of 22-tet sharper <br>than 7 x 22 =154. Therefore, 22-tet is a doubly positive system. <br> <br>R is thus the difference between the diatonic (5 Fifths) and chromatic <br>(7 Fifths) semitones in ET degrees or alternatively, the difference between<br>B# and C if the cycle is started on C. In other words, r is the number of<br>degrees in the Pythagorean ditonic comma in each ET (see Paul Rapoport's <br>article "The Notation of Equal Temperaments," in XH16, 1995). <br> <br>Another parameter useful for characterizing ET's is the number of degrees<br>in the apotome or Pythagorean chromatic semitone (the #) (Rapoport, XH16, <br>1995), i.e., 7 Fifths minus 4 Octaves. This quantity is the number of <br>degrees between C# and C, 1 in the case of 12 and 19-tets, 2 in 17, 24 <br>and 31-tets,  and 3 in 22, 29, 36 and 50-tets. To my knowledge there is <br>no accepted name  for this number as a parameter (Erv Wilson simply calls <br>the systems singulary, binary, ternary, etc. as the number is 1, 2, or 3, <br>etc., but it is essential to fitting various ET's to the Bosanquet or<br>multiple Bosanquet keyboards or rationally assigning accidentals (Wilson, <br>XH2, 1974;  Rapoport, XH16, 1995).  <br> <br>Of course, this discussion presumes 12-tet is the standard system. If one<br>were to base one's classification on 19-tet, for example, then "r" would<br>be calculated relative to the 19-tet fifth (19 Fifths -11 Octaves) and <br>the systems would be arranged according to their ditonic commas (12 Fifths <br>- 7 Octaves). Similarly, one might chose 17, 22, 31 or even 5 and 7 <br>(Wilson, XH3, 1975; XH1, 1974) as bases for notation and keyboards. <br>With less historical and musical justification, one might choose cycles <br>of other intervals than the 4th or 5th such as 5/4, 7/4 and a low number ET <br>which approximates them well.
