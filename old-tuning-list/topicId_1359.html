She lifts her hand: in a<br>holographic display she grabs points<br>in ratio space.  Sounds collide.<br>With her other hand she reaches out, <br>stretching and compressing the overtones<br>of the timbre.<br>Microlasers which detect the focal point<br>of her eyes allow her to control by the<br>direction of her gaze the path of<br>the tuning through N-dimensional space--<br>a superset of ratio space. The harmonies<br>and melodies of this unheard future<br>music issue from a DIN jack plugged<br>into the back of her neck. But for the<br>virtues of proprioceptive feedback, the<br>entire composition could issue from her brain.<br>Yet even here, in the microtonal future,<br>there is great virtue in using the body<br>in performance. This performer knows (as<br>David Gelerntner has pointed out) that we<br>think as much with our muscles as<br>with our minds: musical composition is a<br>matter of tactile feedback as well as<br>cerebration.  The story goes that<br>when Stravinsky used to take a break from<br>rehearsing his orchestral pieces he<br>would sit and outstretch his hands,<br>fingering imaginary patterns on a<br>nonexistant piano. Every so often,<br>he'd smile--discovering a new sound/<br>touch pattern.<br>This imagined future does not yet exist.<br>Someday, though, someone will create it.<br>Therefore it remains to us to prepare<br>ourselves by understanding as clearly<br>as possible the nature of the xenharmonic<br>landscape which we have entered, having <br>exited the 12-tone equal tempered<br>scale.<br>In the digital domain, discreteness (as they<br>say) is the better part of valor. But<br>discreteness applies not only to the bitstream<br>which nowadays makes up all the music we <br>hear on recordings and ever more of the <br>music we hear live: tunings are also<br>discrete, composed of dissociated atoms<br>of pitch which nonetheless cohere into<br>larger wholes.<br>How do the individual intervals of a tuning<br>form larger patterns? What is the nature<br>of those patterns, and what are their<br>similarities and differences to the<br>wider continuum of tunings of which<br>each intonation forms one specimen?<br>--<br>Group theory is a subject which has been<br>greatly underrated in music theory. Recently<br>some efforts have been made by Balzano (and<br>others) to relate concepts from group theory<br>to microtonal tunings, but these efforts have<br>been clouded by excessively complex language<br>and unduly obscurantist presentation.<br>In fact the basic ideas of group theory are<br>extremely simple--almost in proportion to<br>their power. Thus the ideas which I propose<br>to filch from group theory and apply to<br>the equal temperaments are practically<br>ludicrous in their extreme simplicity...yet <br>my experience with composing in the equal <br>temperaments from 5/oct through 53/oct now <br>convinces me that group theoretic concepts <br>are profoundly central to the musical behaviour <br>of the equal temperaments.<br>--<br>Balzano has pointed out in a convoluted way<br>that 12-tet exhibits unusual group theoretic<br>properties. For one thing, only 7 and 11<br>units (a word which will be used instead of<br>"scale steps" for the sake of brevity) of<br>12-tet are both non-composite and relatively<br>prime to the total number of pitches in the<br>temperament.<br>You may object that 5 and 1 units in 12-tet<br>are also non-composite and relatively prime<br>to the the total number of scale-steps<br>per octave.  In raising this objection,<br>you have forgotten that in dealing with<br>modulo 12 arithmetic, 7 = 5 and 11 = 1.<br>7 modulo 12 = 5, and  11 modulo 12 = 1.<br>Thus from a group theoretic standpoint<br>the 12-tet scale contains only 6 unique<br>intervals; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  Or alternatively<br>11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6. From the viewpoint of <br>modulo 12 arithmetic these two interval<br>sets are identical (albeit reversed in order).<br>Also from a group theoretic standpoint,<br>these two interval sets (once re-ordered)<br>exhibit identical transformation properties.<br>Moving through the 12 pitches by 1 scale<br>step at a time produces a resultant set<br>of scale-steps identical to moving through<br>the 1 pitches 11 scale steps at a time,<br>albeit in reversed order.<br>Let's see an example to convince the<br>doubters: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12=1<br> = (C) C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B C<br>Now 11 scale steps at a time:<br>1 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1=12<br>(C) B A# A G# G F# F E D# D C# C<br>--<br>It's obvious from examination of the<br>above lists that one is merely the<br>reflection of the other. More importantly,<br>the essential relationships between successive<br>members of these resultant sets is identical<br>in both cases: sucessive pitches of both sets differ<br>by 1 scale-step.  The only distinction is the<br>sign of the difference. +1 for 12 modulo 1,<br>-1 for 12 modulo 11.<br>This essential relational similarity indicates<br>that one resultant set is merely a trivial<br>linear transformation of the other set.<br>In effect, the two sets are identical from<br>the point of view of group theory.<br>--<br>The same is equally true of fifths/fourths.<br>In more formal terms, 12 modulo 5 =<br>12 modulo 7 with a sign change in the<br>relation between successive members of<br>the resultant set. The sign change is<br>irrelevant because it means only<br>that we ascend as opposed to descend<br>the circle of perfect fifths. From the<br>point of view of group theory, the direction<br>of travel around the circle of fifths is<br>inconsequential because it is the relationship<br>between successive members of the circle of<br>fifths which unqiuely defines this substructure.<br>--<br>Let me use that word again: substructure.<br>The whole point here is to reveal the substructures<br>hidden underneath the surface of each equal<br>temperaments like bones beneath the skin of<br>an artist's model. A good painter or sculptor or<br>draughtsman or photographer knows that it is<br>*not* sufficient to understand the play of light<br>and shadow on the surface of the human skin;<br>to accurately represent a human face, one must<br>understand and elocidate in a photo or with<br>a pencil or with a chisel on marble the<br>brathtakingly intricate framework of bone<br>which underlies the cheek and brow and chin.<br>So with intonations.<br>To understand a tuning deeply enough to use<br>it effectively, it is not sufficient to<br>grasp the mere surface of the tuning--<br>what kind of thirds it offers, what kinds<br>of triads, what the tuning's approximation<br>is to this or that member of the harmonic series,<br>whether harmonic 5, or 7, or 11, or 13, etc.<br>These are important issues...but they are<br>ultimately superficial. A tuning's "sound" and<br>function is crucially dependent on the<br>invisible substructure which lies beneath<br>(but controls in every way) the audible <br>exterior of the intonation.<br>This is where group theoretic concepts<br>come into play.<br>Returning to 12, we note that it boasts<br>several unique properties: for one thing,<br>the minor third = 3 units is prime,<br>yet a factor of the total (non-prime) number<br>of pitches. The major third = 4 units is<br>non-prime, a power of 2, and also a factor<br>of the total number of pitches. Moreover,<br>the perfect fifth = 7 units is prime<br>and not a multiplicative composite of either <br>the min 3rd or maj 3rd or the total number of<br>pitches in an octave...but 3 + 4 units =<br>7 units, so the minor plus major third<br>yields an interval which is relatively prime <br>to the total number of units per octave.<br>Lastly, the only other number of units<br>relatively prime to 12 is 1 (= 11).<br>What do these facts mean?<br>[1] Because 7 units ( = p5) is both<br>relatively prime to 12 and absolutely <br>prime, it means that there is only a  <br>single circle of fifths in this <br>temperament.<br>As a result, we can visit any pitch<br>in 12-tet by travelling around a<br>single circle of fifths. <br>[2] Because only 7 (=5) and 11 (=1)<br>units are relatively prime to the<br>total number of units per octave<br>AND non-composite, these are the<br>only two intervals which can<br>generate unqiue structural modes<br>in 12.  Triads moving up and down<br>by 7 units generate the major<br>scale in 12, while single pitches<br>moving up and down by 11 (=1)<br>units generates the chromatic<br>scale in 12.  These are the two<br>modal patterns which form the basis <br>of western 12-tet music.<br>[3] Because neither 3 nor 4 units<br>are relatively prime to 12,<br>moving by 3 or by 4 melodic<br>units generates a repeating<br>pattern which never changes.<br>Moving by 3 units up or down<br>yields only 4 pitches of 12,<br>while moving by 4 units up or<br>down yields only 3 pitches of<br>12.  Note that the union of<br>these two sets (C E G# and<br>C Eb GB Bbb= A)=<br>(C D# E F# G# A) does NOT<br>produce a structural melodic<br>mode. This means that progressions<br>by successions of minor thirds<br>or by successions of major thirds<br>(A) will not allow us to travel<br>to any desired pitch in 12 and<br>(B) will prove highly repetitive.<br>[4] Progressions by alternating<br>sets of 3 and 4 units *will*<br>allow us to visit any desired<br>pitch in the scale, and also<br>sketch out the well-known<br>Alberti Bass pattern--e.g.,<br>arpeggiated major or minor<br>triads.<br>--<br>These structural features<br>buried deep inside the 12-tet<br>scale are not necessarily<br>reproduced in other equal<br>temperaments. 12-tet is a peculiar<br>combination of extreme internal <br> symmetries (because all but<br>11 and 7 units of 12 produce<br>endlessly repeating cyclic<br>patterns which reiterate only<br>a few pitches out of 12) and broken<br>symmetries (because 3 + 4 = 7,<br>and 7 generates a constantly<br>changing pattern of 12 full<br>pitches, along with 1 = 11).<br>--<br>Thus 12 is an equal division<br>of the octave which stands<br>midway between extreme internal<br>symmetry and complete internal<br>asymmetry.<br>To get a feeling for this, let's<br>consider next an equal temperament<br>which exhibits very high internal<br>symmetry. 16, being a power of 2,<br>represents almost the uttermost<br>extreme in internal symmetry.<br>16 has a unit size of 75 cents<br>and as a power of 2, a lot of<br>factors: 2, 4, 8, 16. Only 1, 3, 5, <br>are non-composite *and* relatively <br>prime to 16. Notice that 7 = 9<br>modulo 16 and 9 is a composite number.<br>11 = 5 modulo 16, 13 = 3 modulo 16,<br>15 = 1 modulo 16.<br>Progression by 1 unit yields<br>the chromatic scale in 16-tet.<br>3 units, being also relatively<br>prime to 16, generates a chain of<br>16 pitches separated successively<br>by 225 cents. This is the 16-tet<br>equivalent of a whole-tone scale--<br>a thoroughly anti-tonal construct.<br>5 units = 375 cents and being<br>also relatively prime to 16, <br>progression by 5 units yields<br>16 successive pitches separated<br>from one another by 375 cents.<br>This structure has no analog in<br>western music. It is highly anti-tonal.<br>Notice several things: <br>[1] in 16-tet, 3/16 of the<br>intervals are relatively prime and<br>non-composite, while in 12-tet 2/12<br>of the interals were relatively prime<br>and non-composite. <br>[2] In 16-tet there is no such thing<br>as a "perfect fifth." So 16 lacks<br>the Alberti Bass coset pattern, as<br>well as modulation by perfect fifths<br>(the closest thing to a perfect<br>fifth in 16 is 9 units = 675 cents).<br>But the minor third in 16 = 4 units,<br>300 cents, while the major third =<br>5 units 375 cents. 4 + 5 = 9, which<br>alas does not sound *anything*<br>like a p5. So in 16 it is NOT true that<br>the major plus minor third = p5!<br>Moreover (unlike 12), the closest<br>interval to a perfect fifth is <br>composite and non-relatively-prime<br>to the total number of pitches in<br>the octave, while the major third<br>is non-composite and is relatively<br>prime to the total number of pitches.<br>This tells us that the major third<br>is very un-12-like, the "perfect fifth"<br>in 16 is very un-12-like, and only the<br>minor third IS 12-like. Moreover,<br>chord progressions are impossible<br>because the Alberti Bass pattern in<br>16 does not "fill the space" of<br>16-tet. Imagine 16-tet chromatic<br>pitches laid out in columns and the<br>3-unit pattern laid out in rows<br>and each of these planes transposed<br>up and down by 5 units. This is a<br>spatial representation of the 3<br>fundamental modal substructures<br>in 16-tet. A moment's visualization<br>will suffice to convince yourself<br>that a 2-D tiling of 4 x 5 units<br>repeated vertcally up and down endlessly<br>*cannot* fill all of our 16-tet <br>group theoretic space.  <br>A crystallographer would say that<br>our 16-tet modal 3-D space exhibits<br>no regular unit cell.<br>Notice the difference from 12-tet:<br>12 was a 2-D plane and it *did*<br>have a regular unit cell. Triangles<br>formed along the 1, 3, 4 coordinates<br>will completely tile 12-tet modal<br>space. Moreover, in 12-tet the maj 3rd<br>+ min 3rd = p5, whereas this is<br>*not* true in 16-tet.<br>So 16 is very different from 12<br>in group theoretic terms. My conjecture<br>is that the lack of a unit cell in 16's<br>modal 3-space indicates a strong conflict<br>between the melodic and harmonic functions<br>in 16.<br>--<br>Let's move on from 16's extreme internal<br>symmetries to a scale which lies at the<br>other end of the spectrum from 12...<br>Namely, 19. This division of the octave is <br>highly asymmetric because all of the intervals<br>in 19 form unrepeating non-interlocking<br>patterns. In 19, unlike 12, there are<br>19 different diminished 7th chords<br>(in 12 there are only 3 distinct dim 7th<br>chords).  Moreover, in 12 (as Paul<br>Rapoport has pointed out) the conventional<br>notation of the dim 7th tetrad does <br>violence to the acoustic reality of the<br>construct because any conventional <br>notation (C-E-Gb-Bbb, or E-Gb-Bbb-Dbb<br>or Gb-Bbb-Dbb-Fb or A-C-E-Gb, etc.)<br>implies the existence of a root, which<br>the dim 7th chord simply doesn't have<br>in 12-tet.<br>It floats free of any root...or, if you<br>prefer, all of its 4 pitches serves<br>equally as a root.  But in 19, a quartet<br>of stacked minor thirds *can* be<br>differentiated by root because transposing<br>to the next pitch upward inside a 19-tet<br>diminished 7th chord generates both a<br>different set of pitches *and* a different<br>set of pitch-names. In 19, Eb is not <br>just notationally but audibly different<br>from D#, and so dim 7th chords *do* have<br>entirely functional roots. In 19, dim 7th<br>chords *never* "float free" of the scale--<br>they are far more tonal--and far more<br>audibly consonant, from the standpoint<br>of both musical and sensory consonance.<br>Try playing a 19-tet dim 7th if your<br>fingers can stretch that far on a 19-tet<br>guitar. You'll be pleasantly surprised.<br>--<br>In 19, the p5 = 11 units, while the<br>minor third = 5 units and the major<br>3rd = 6 units. So in 19, the p5 is<br>both non-composite *and* relatively<br>prime to the total number of pitches<br>in the scale, while m3 + M3 = p5<br>(5 units + 6 units = 11 units).<br>This tells us that 19 is from a group<br>theory viewpoint somewhat similar in its <br>internal substructure to 12. Audible<br>results confirm this similarity:<br>because 19 matches 12 in many basic<br>respects and because 19 has a fine<br>approximation of the 3rd harmonic, <br>it's bound to sound somewhat 12-like.<br>However, 19 differs sharply from<br>12 in the sense that both the min 3<br>(5 units) and the Maj 3 (6 units) in<br>19 are relatively prime to the total<br>number of units in the octave (19).<br>(In 12, the min 3rd and maj 3rd are<br>both factors of the total number of<br>units in the octave = 12, not relatively<br>prime to 12 at all.)<br>This means that a cycling Alberti Bass <br>which moves up & down by major or minor<br>3rds in 19 will probably sound more<br>musically complex than a similar<br>pattern in 12 cycling by major or<br>minor thirds: the 12-tet version merely<br>moves up and down the same pitch subset,<br>while the 19-tet version constantly<br>moves to new pitches.<br>In 19, the fact that modulation by root<br>movement of maj 3rds *or* min 3rds allows<br>us to visit any possible pitch also raises<br>the possibility that triadic root <br>movement by 3rds (which sounds weak<br>and anemic in 12) might sound robust<br>and vivid in 19.<br>So 19 is somewhat 12-like, but not<br>entirely, from the group theoretic<br>viewpoint.<br>--<br>Moving on to 22, we note that the minor<br> 3rd = 6 units while the maj 3rd =<br>7 units. However the p5 = 13 units.<br>Here, we see some marked similarities<br>to 19 because the p4 is composite:<br>p4 = 13 modulo 22 = 9. The p5 = m3 + M3<br>(13 units = 6 + 7) and is prime, but the<br>major 3rd in 22 is both non-composite and<br>relatively prime to the total number<br>of pitches in the octave, whereas in<br>12 the maj 3rd (with 4 units) was<br>composite and a factor of the total<br>number of pitches in the scale.<br>Also in 12, both the p4 and p5 are<br>non-composite and relatively prime to<br>the total number of pitches in the scale--<br>but in 22 the p4 is composite yet relatively<br>prime to 22, while the p5 is both prime<br>and relatively prime to 22, suggesting<br>that in 22 the p4 is a much more slippery<br>and amibigous interval than in 12-tet.<br>--<br>Let's compare 12, 19 and 22 from<br>a group theoretic viewpoint:<br>19 contains major thirds with<br>symmetry properties more like<br>12's than 22, while 22's minor<br>thirds are more like 12's from<br>this highly abstract perspective. <br>19's major thirds are composite,<br>while 22's minor thirds are<br>composite.  Note, however, that<br>19 is more like 12 than 22<br>from this point of view--<br>because in 22 the number of units<br>in a minor third is composite<br>and the total number of pitches<br>in the scale is also composite--<br>and the 2 intervals have a<br>factor in common, 2. But 19<br>is a prime number and thus<br>non-composite, with no factor<br>in common with the number of <br>units in the 19-tet major<br>third of 6 units.<br>This raises the important<br>issue of symmetry-breaking,<br>which many subscribers didn't<br>seem to understand in a my<br>post touching on the subject<br>long ago & far away.<br>The idea is simple: movement<br>by a chain of major thirds (or<br>indeed cyclic successive motion<br>by *any* melodic interval) in<br>19 will always break melodic<br>symmetry because it will force<br>the composer to visit all 19<br>pitches in the scale. In 22-tet,<br>however, movement by minor thirds<br>will overlap with itself in<br>a self-limited entirely symmetrical<br>pattern.  If we imagine an equal<br>temperament as a circle of seats<br>around a dinner table, moving by certain<br>subsets clockwise around the table<br>(e.g., minor thirds in 22-tet) will<br>land us constantly in the same set of<br>seats over and over again. If<br>one diner leaves gets up & we shift <br>everyone clockwise by the amount<br>of the gap and reinsert the diner<br>who left at a new point, we merely <br>re-order a fixed subset of dinner<br>guests.  The roster of people in<br>that subset never changes.<br>If we try the same trick in<br>19-tet, we find ourselves having<br>to drag everyone at the dinner<br>table into the act. Our subset of<br>guests inevitably expands to <br>include all the people at the<br>dinner table.<br>Let's see the proof:<br>Moving up or down  by 6 units <br>in 22 gives<br>1 7 13 19 25 (=3) 31 (=9)<br>37 (=15) 43 (=21) 49 (=5)<br>55 (=11) 61 (=17) 67 (=1)<br>73 (=7) & so on, since we're<br>now repeating the subset<br>enumerated at the start ad <br>inifinitum.<br>As you can see, moving by<br>6 units (minor 3rd) in 22<br>never touches a subset of the<br>22-tet pitches: 2,4,6,8,10,12,<br>14,16,18,20,22. This generates<br>a gapped pattern which can<br>be rotated through the scale<br>by starting on another pitch<br>but whose internal substructure<br>*cannot* be changed (i.e., the<br>successive intervals twixt<br>members of the set cannot be<br>altered as long as we move<br>by a chain of minor thirds in<br>22).<br>By contrast, 19 is a prime number...<br>and consequently moving by a chain<br>of major thirds in 19 inevitably<br>yields not a subset of 19, but the<br>entire set of pitches in the<br>octave.<br>--<br>These group theoretic and abstract<br>algebraic considerations are especially<br>valuable becuase [1] they reveal musical<br>similarities between equal temperaments<br>which might on the surface seem different--<br>and these similarties in musicalpractice<br>turn out to be vividly and clearly audible;<br>for instance, recently these considerations<br>led me to turn a 9-tet composition into<br>a 15-tet compositions by expanding the<br>intervals by a fixed factor and calculating<br>the closest pitches in 15-tet. The result<br>was extremely successful from a musical<br>standpoint: both compositions sounded<br>nearly identical musically, yet distinguishable<br>in interesting ways (from an intonational <br>standpoint).<br>Why transfer a composition in 15-tet into<br>9-tet, rather than into 12-tet or 18-tet?<br>9 is more similar to 15 than to 12 or 18<br>from a group theoretic viewpoint because<br>9 and 15 are both multiples of 3 and<br>thus share identical major thirds of<br>400 cents. 12 and 18 also boast the<br>same 400-cent major thirds, but in 12<br>the 7-unit p5 is relatively prime to 12<br>as well as absolutely prime.<br>However, in both 9 and 15 the p5 (or<br>its closest approximation) is composite.<br>In 9-tet, the closest to the p5 is<br>5 units (remember that 5 modulo 9 =<br>4, composite) while the closest to the <br>p5 in 15-tet is 9 units (also composite). <br>The 9-tet min 3rd + maj 3rd = 2 units + <br>3 units = 5 units, while in 15-tet the minor<br>3rd + major 3rd = 4 units + 5 units = 9 units.<br>This means that in 15-tet, the major<br>3rd is prime but a factor of the<br>total number of pitches in the octave, while <br>in 9 the major third is also prime and <br>a factor of the total number of pitches<br>in the octave.<br>Conversely, in both 9 and 15 tet<br>the minor third is relatively prime<br>to the total number of pitches. This<br>is very different from 12, in which<br>both major 3rd and minor 3rd are<br>factors of the total number of pitches,<br>while the major third is prime<br>but the minor third is composite.<br>Likewise, 9 and 15 exhibit radically<br>different internal substructure from<br>18: in that temperament, the minor 3rd<br>+ major 3rd = 5 units + 6 units =<br>11 units, the closest approach to<br>the p5 (733.333 cents). <br>But notice that in 18, the major<br>third is a factor of the total number<br>of pitches as well as being composite,<br>while the minor 3rd is both prime<br>and relatively prime to the total<br>number of pitches. Thus both 18<br>and 12 are very unlike 9 and 15<br>in group theoretic terms: the<br>symmetry groups formed by chains<br>of major or minor thirds in 9 will<br>be much more like those formed in<br>15 than in either 12 or 18.<br>--<br>In my experience, the most important<br>audible properties of equal tempered<br>scales are: [1] the presence or<br>absence of recognizable fifths<br>according to Blackwood's criterion;<br>[2] the melodic substructure (whole-<br>tone scale, semitone scale, 1/3-tone<br>scale, 1/5-tone scale, etc.) of the ET;<br>[3] the group theoretic/abstract<br>algebraic substructure of the equal<br>temperament.<br>As controversial as it might sound,<br>in my experience the presence or<br>absence of precise approximations<br>of members of the harmonic series<br>is relatively unimportant in determing<br>how the equal temperaments function<br>musically--except when an equal <br>temperament has a "p5" so far away<br>from the 3rd harmonic as to sound<br>grossly and unremittingly dissonant.<br>(In general, the limit seems to be<br>685.4 < p5 < 720 cents. Again, this<br>is the Blackwood/Rasch criterion,<br>and it explains what one hears<br>in the ETs beautifully.)<br>Whether a perfect 5th is 720 cents<br>or 685.4 cents or 700 cents is<br>in my musical experience a trivial<br>consideration--regardless of the<br>exact degree of approximation of<br>the p5, all thse types of perfect<br>fifths sound entirely convincing<br>and functional in completely<br>effective musical ways when used<br>with the equal temperaments from<br>which they derive.<br>Thus, most of the work which has<br>been done theoretically about the<br>equal temperaments seems to be<br>musically irrelevant to and <br>almost completely disconnected from<br>what the ear actually *hears* in<br>musical terms in these equal<br>temperaments. In particular, theoretically<br>fascinating structures like Clarence<br>Barlow's harmonicity and David Rothenberg's <br>propriety appear to have no audible connection <br>whatever to any  any audible functional property of<br>the xenharmonic equal temperaments<br>which I have been able to ascertain.<br>Needless to say, all of these<br>statements will be greeted with the<br>utmost delight by the members of this<br>tuning forum.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 10 Dec 1996 23:24 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA21651; Tue, 10 Dec 1996 23:26:37 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00402<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id OAA00750; Tue, 10 Dec 1996 14:26:34 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 10 Dec 1996 14:26:34 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612102215.OAA00212@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>McLaren on Group Theory, etc.</h1><h3><a id=4294 href="#4294">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/1996 2:13:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: visions of the future<br>--<br>I have a vision.<br>In the darkness, a performer floats<br>weightless.

Recently<br>some efforts have been made by Balzano (and<br>others) to relate concepts from group theory<br>to microtonal tunings, but these efforts have<br>been clouded by excessively complex language<br>and unduly obscurantist presentation.<br>In fact the basic ideas of group theory are<br>extremely simple--almost in proportion to<br>their power.

For one thing, only 7 and 11<br>units (a word which will be used instead of<br>"scale steps" for the sake of brevity) of<br>12-tet are both non-composite and relatively<br>prime to the total number of pitches in the<br>temperament.<br>You may object that 5 and 1 units in 12-tet<br>are also non-composite and relatively prime<br>to the the total number of scale-steps<br>per octave.  In raising this objection,<br>you have forgotten that in dealing with<br>modulo 12 arithmetic, 7 = 5 and 11 = 1.<br>7 modulo 12 = 5, and  11 modulo 12 = 1.<br>Thus from a group theoretic standpoint<br>the 12-tet scale contains only 6 unique<br>intervals; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  Or alternatively<br>11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6. From the viewpoint of <br>modulo 12 arithmetic these two interval<br>sets are identical (albeit reversed in order).<br>Also from a group theoretic standpoint,<br>these two interval sets (once re-ordered)<br>exhibit identical transformation properties.<br>Moving through the 12 pitches by 1 scale<br>step at a time produces a resultant set<br>of scale-steps identical to moving through<br>the 1 pitches 11 scale steps at a time,<br>albeit in reversed order.<br>Let's see an example to convince the<br>doubters: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12=1<br> = (C) C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B C<br>Now 11 scale steps at a time:<br>1 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1=12<br>(C) B A# A G# G F# F E D# D C# C<br>--<br>It's obvious from examination of the<br>above lists that one is merely the<br>reflection of the other. More importantly,<br>the essential relationships between successive<br>members of these resultant sets is identical<br>in both cases: sucessive pitches of both sets differ<br>by 1 scale-step.  The only distinction is the<br>sign of the difference. +1 for 12 modulo 1,<br>-1 for 12 modulo 11.<br>This essential relational similarity indicates<br>that one resultant set is merely a trivial<br>linear transformation of the other set.<br>In effect, the two sets are identical from<br>the point of view of group theory.<br>--<br>The same is equally true of fifths/fourths.<br>In more formal terms, 12 modulo 5 =<br>12 modulo 7 with a sign change in the<br>relation between successive members of<br>the resultant set. The sign change is<br>irrelevant because it means only<br>that we ascend as opposed to descend<br>the circle of perfect fifths. From the<br>point of view of group theory, the direction<br>of travel around the circle of fifths is<br>inconsequential because it is the relationship<br>between successive members of the circle of<br>fifths which unqiuely defines this substructure.<br>--<br>Let me use that word again: substructure.<br>The whole point here is to reveal the substructures<br>hidden underneath the surface of each equal<br>temperaments like bones beneath the skin of<br>an artist's model. A good painter or sculptor or<br>draughtsman or photographer knows that it is<br>*not* sufficient to understand the play of light<br>and shadow on the surface of the human skin;<br>to accurately represent a human face, one must<br>understand and elocidate in a photo or with<br>a pencil or with a chisel on marble the<br>brathtakingly intricate framework of bone<br>which underlies the cheek and brow and chin.<br>So with intonations.<br>To understand a tuning deeply enough to use<br>it effectively, it is not sufficient to<br>grasp the mere surface of the tuning--<br>what kind of thirds it offers, what kinds<br>of triads, what the tuning's approximation<br>is to this or that member of the harmonic series,<br>whether harmonic 5, or 7, or 11, or 13, etc.<br>These are important issues...but they are<br>ultimately superficial. A tuning's "sound" and<br>function is crucially dependent on the<br>invisible substructure which lies beneath<br>(but controls in every way) the audible <br>exterior of the intonation.<br>This is where group theoretic concepts<br>come into play.<br>Returning to 12, we note that it boasts<br>several unique properties: for one thing,<br>the minor third = 3 units is prime,<br>yet a factor of the total (non-prime) number<br>of pitches. The major third = 4 units is<br>non-prime, a power of 2, and also a factor<br>of the total number of pitches. Moreover,<br>the perfect fifth = 7 units is prime<br>and not a multiplicative composite of either <br>the min 3rd or maj 3rd or the total number of<br>pitches in an octave...but 3 + 4 units =<br>7 units, so the minor plus major third<br>yields an interval which is relatively prime <br>to the total number of units per octave.<br>Lastly, the only other number of units<br>relatively prime to 12 is 1 (= 11).<br>What do these facts mean?<br>[1] Because 7 units ( = p5) is both<br>relatively prime to 12 and absolutely <br>prime, it means that there is only a  <br>single circle of fifths in this <br>temperament.<br>As a result, we can visit any pitch<br>in 12-tet by travelling around a<br>single circle of fifths. <br>[2] Because only 7 (=5) and 11 (=1)<br>units are relatively prime to the<br>total number of units per octave<br>AND non-composite, these are the<br>only two intervals which can<br>generate unqiue structural modes<br>in 12.  Triads moving up and down<br>by 7 units generate the major<br>scale in 12, while single pitches<br>moving up and down by 11 (=1)<br>units generates the chromatic<br>scale in 12.  These are the two<br>modal patterns which form the basis <br>of western 12-tet music.<br>[3] Because neither 3 nor 4 units<br>are relatively prime to 12,<br>moving by 3 or by 4 melodic<br>units generates a repeating<br>pattern which never changes.<br>Moving by 3 units up or down<br>yields only 4 pitches of 12,<br>while moving by 4 units up or<br>down yields only 3 pitches of<br>12.  Note that the union of<br>these two sets (C E G# and<br>C Eb GB Bbb= A)=<br>(C D# E F# G# A) does NOT<br>produce a structural melodic<br>mode. This means that progressions<br>by successions of minor thirds<br>or by successions of major thirds<br>(A) will not allow us to travel<br>to any desired pitch in 12 and<br>(B) will prove highly repetitive.<br>[4] Progressions by alternating<br>sets of 3 and 4 units *will*<br>allow us to visit any desired<br>pitch in the scale, and also<br>sketch out the well-known<br>Alberti Bass pattern--e.g.,<br>arpeggiated major or minor<br>triads.<br>--<br>These structural features<br>buried deep inside the 12-tet<br>scale are not necessarily<br>reproduced in other equal<br>temperaments. 12-tet is a peculiar<br>combination of extreme internal <br> symmetries (because all but<br>11 and 7 units of 12 produce<br>endlessly repeating cyclic<br>patterns which reiterate only<br>a few pitches out of 12) and broken<br>symmetries (because 3 + 4 = 7,<br>and 7 generates a constantly<br>changing pattern of 12 full<br>pitches, along with 1 = 11).<br>--<br>Thus 12 is an equal division<br>of the octave which stands<br>midway between extreme internal<br>symmetry and complete internal<br>asymmetry.<br>To get a feeling for this, let's<br>consider next an equal temperament<br>which exhibits very high internal<br>symmetry. 16, being a power of 2,<br>represents almost the uttermost<br>extreme in internal symmetry.<br>16 has a unit size of 75 cents<br>and as a power of 2, a lot of<br>factors: 2, 4, 8, 16. Only 1, 3, 5, <br>are non-composite *and* relatively <br>prime to 16. Notice that 7 = 9<br>modulo 16 and 9 is a composite number.<br>11 = 5 modulo 16, 13 = 3 modulo 16,<br>15 = 1 modulo 16.<br>Progression by 1 unit yields<br>the chromatic scale in 16-tet.<br>3 units, being also relatively<br>prime to 16, generates a chain of<br>16 pitches separated successively<br>by 225 cents. This is the 16-tet<br>equivalent of a whole-tone scale--<br>a thoroughly anti-tonal construct.<br>5 units = 375 cents and being<br>also relatively prime to 16, <br>progression by 5 units yields<br>16 successive pitches separated<br>from one another by 375 cents.<br>This structure has no analog in<br>western music. It is highly anti-tonal.<br>Notice several things: <br>[1] in 16-tet, 3/16 of the<br>intervals are relatively prime and<br>non-composite, while in 12-tet 2/12<br>of the interals were relatively prime<br>and non-composite. <br>[2] In 16-tet there is no such thing<br>as a "perfect fifth." So 16 lacks<br>the Alberti Bass coset pattern, as<br>well as modulation by perfect fifths<br>(the closest thing to a perfect<br>fifth in 16 is 9 units = 675 cents).<br>But the minor third in 16 = 4 units,<br>300 cents, while the major third =<br>5 units 375 cents. 4 + 5 = 9, which<br>alas does not sound *anything*<br>like a p5. So in 16 it is NOT true that<br>the major plus minor third = p5!<br>Moreover (unlike 12), the closest<br>interval to a perfect fifth is <br>composite and non-relatively-prime<br>to the total number of pitches in<br>the octave, while the major third<br>is non-composite and is relatively<br>prime to the total number of pitches.<br>This tells us that the major third<br>is very un-12-like, the "perfect fifth"<br>in 16 is very un-12-like, and only the<br>minor third IS 12-like. Moreover,<br>chord progressions are impossible<br>because the Alberti Bass pattern in<br>16 does not "fill the space" of<br>16-tet. Imagine 16-tet chromatic<br>pitches laid out in columns and the<br>3-unit pattern laid out in rows<br>and each of these planes transposed<br>up and down by 5 units. This is a<br>spatial representation of the 3<br>fundamental modal substructures<br>in 16-tet. A moment's visualization<br>will suffice to convince yourself<br>that a 2-D tiling of 4 x 5 units<br>repeated vertcally up and down endlessly<br>*cannot* fill all of our 16-tet <br>group theoretic space.  <br>A crystallographer would say that<br>our 16-tet modal 3-D space exhibits<br>no regular unit cell.<br>Notice the difference from 12-tet:<br>12 was a 2-D plane and it *did*<br>have a regular unit cell. Triangles<br>formed along the 1, 3, 4 coordinates<br>will completely tile 12-tet modal<br>space. Moreover, in 12-tet the maj 3rd<br>+ min 3rd = p5, whereas this is<br>*not* true in 16-tet.<br>So 16 is very different from 12<br>in group theoretic terms. My conjecture<br>is that the lack of a unit cell in 16's<br>modal 3-space indicates a strong conflict<br>between the melodic and harmonic functions<br>in 16.<br>--<br>Let's move on from 16's extreme internal<br>symmetries to a scale which lies at the<br>other end of the spectrum from 12...<br>Namely, 19. This division of the octave is <br>highly asymmetric because all of the intervals<br>in 19 form unrepeating non-interlocking<br>patterns. In 19, unlike 12, there are<br>19 different diminished 7th chords<br>(in 12 there are only 3 distinct dim 7th<br>chords).  Moreover, in 12 (as Paul<br>Rapoport has pointed out) the conventional<br>notation of the dim 7th tetrad does <br>violence to the acoustic reality of the<br>construct because any conventional <br>notation (C-E-Gb-Bbb, or E-Gb-Bbb-Dbb<br>or Gb-Bbb-Dbb-Fb or A-C-E-Gb, etc.)<br>implies the existence of a root, which<br>the dim 7th chord simply doesn't have<br>in 12-tet.<br>It floats free of any root...or, if you<br>prefer, all of its 4 pitches serves<br>equally as a root.  But in 19, a quartet<br>of stacked minor thirds *can* be<br>differentiated by root because transposing<br>to the next pitch upward inside a 19-tet<br>diminished 7th chord generates both a<br>different set of pitches *and* a different<br>set of pitch-names. In 19, Eb is not <br>just notationally but audibly different<br>from D#, and so dim 7th chords *do* have<br>entirely functional roots. In 19, dim 7th<br>chords *never* "float free" of the scale--<br>they are far more tonal--and far more<br>audibly consonant, from the standpoint<br>of both musical and sensory consonance.<br>Try playing a 19-tet dim 7th if your<br>fingers can stretch that far on a 19-tet<br>guitar. You'll be pleasantly surprised.<br>--<br>In 19, the p5 = 11 units, while the<br>minor third = 5 units and the major<br>3rd = 6 units. So in 19, the p5 is<br>both non-composite *and* relatively<br>prime to the total number of pitches<br>in the scale, while m3 + M3 = p5<br>(5 units + 6 units = 11 units).<br>This tells us that 19 is from a group<br>theory viewpoint somewhat similar in its <br>internal substructure to 12. Audible<br>results confirm this similarity:<br>because 19 matches 12 in many basic<br>respects and because 19 has a fine<br>approximation of the 3rd harmonic, <br>it's bound to sound somewhat 12-like.<br>However, 19 differs sharply from<br>12 in the sense that both the min 3<br>(5 units) and the Maj 3 (6 units) in<br>19 are relatively prime to the total<br>number of units in the octave (19).<br>(In 12, the min 3rd and maj 3rd are<br>both factors of the total number of<br>units in the octave = 12, not relatively<br>prime to 12 at all.)<br>This means that a cycling Alberti Bass <br>which moves up & down by major or minor<br>3rds in 19 will probably sound more<br>musically complex than a similar<br>pattern in 12 cycling by major or<br>minor thirds: the 12-tet version merely<br>moves up and down the same pitch subset,<br>while the 19-tet version constantly<br>moves to new pitches.<br>In 19, the fact that modulation by root<br>movement of maj 3rds *or* min 3rds allows<br>us to visit any possible pitch also raises<br>the possibility that triadic root <br>movement by 3rds (which sounds weak<br>and anemic in 12) might sound robust<br>and vivid in 19.<br>So 19 is somewhat 12-like, but not<br>entirely, from the group theoretic<br>viewpoint.<br>--<br>Moving on to 22, we note that the minor<br> 3rd = 6 units while the maj 3rd =<br>7 units. However the p5 = 13 units.<br>Here, we see some marked similarities<br>to 19 because the p4 is composite:<br>p4 = 13 modulo 22 = 9. The p5 = m3 + M3<br>(13 units = 6 + 7) and is prime, but the<br>major 3rd in 22 is both non-composite and<br>relatively prime to the total number<br>of pitches in the octave, whereas in<br>12 the maj 3rd (with 4 units) was<br>composite and a factor of the total<br>number of pitches in the scale.<br>Also in 12, both the p4 and p5 are<br>non-composite and relatively prime to<br>the total number of pitches in the scale--<br>but in 22 the p4 is composite yet relatively<br>prime to 22, while the p5 is both prime<br>and relatively prime to 22, suggesting<br>that in 22 the p4 is a much more slippery<br>and amibigous interval than in 12-tet.<br>--<br>Let's compare 12, 19 and 22 from<br>a group theoretic viewpoint:<br>19 contains major thirds with<br>symmetry properties more like<br>12's than 22, while 22's minor<br>thirds are more like 12's from<br>this highly abstract perspective. <br>19's major thirds are composite,<br>while 22's minor thirds are<br>composite.  Note, however, that<br>19 is more like 12 than 22<br>from this point of view--<br>because in 22 the number of units<br>in a minor third is composite<br>and the total number of pitches<br>in the scale is also composite--<br>and the 2 intervals have a<br>factor in common, 2. But 19<br>is a prime number and thus<br>non-composite, with no factor<br>in common with the number of <br>units in the 19-tet major<br>third of 6 units.<br>This raises the important<br>issue of symmetry-breaking,<br>which many subscribers didn't<br>seem to understand in a my<br>post touching on the subject<br>long ago & far away.<br>The idea is simple: movement<br>by a chain of major thirds (or<br>indeed cyclic successive motion<br>by *any* melodic interval) in<br>19 will always break melodic<br>symmetry because it will force<br>the composer to visit all 19<br>pitches in the scale. In 22-tet,<br>however, movement by minor thirds<br>will overlap with itself in<br>a self-limited entirely symmetrical<br>pattern.  If we imagine an equal<br>temperament as a circle of seats<br>around a dinner table, moving by certain<br>subsets clockwise around the table<br>(e.g., minor thirds in 22-tet) will<br>land us constantly in the same set of<br>seats over and over again. If<br>one diner leaves gets up & we shift <br>everyone clockwise by the amount<br>of the gap and reinsert the diner<br>who left at a new point, we merely <br>re-order a fixed subset of dinner<br>guests.  The roster of people in<br>that subset never changes.<br>If we try the same trick in<br>19-tet, we find ourselves having<br>to drag everyone at the dinner<br>table into the act. Our subset of<br>guests inevitably expands to <br>include all the people at the<br>dinner table.<br>Let's see the proof:<br>Moving up or down  by 6 units <br>in 22 gives<br>1 7 13 19 25 (=3) 31 (=9)<br>37 (=15) 43 (=21) 49 (=5)<br>55 (=11) 61 (=17) 67 (=1)<br>73 (=7) & so on, since we're<br>now repeating the subset<br>enumerated at the start ad <br>inifinitum.<br>As you can see, moving by<br>6 units (minor 3rd) in 22<br>never touches a subset of the<br>22-tet pitches: 2,4,6,8,10,12,<br>14,16,18,20,22. This generates<br>a gapped pattern which can<br>be rotated through the scale<br>by starting on another pitch<br>but whose internal substructure<br>*cannot* be changed (i.e., the<br>successive intervals twixt<br>members of the set cannot be<br>altered as long as we move<br>by a chain of minor thirds in<br>22).<br>By contrast, 19 is a prime number...<br>and consequently moving by a chain<br>of major thirds in 19 inevitably<br>yields not a subset of 19, but the<br>entire set of pitches in the<br>octave.<br>--<br>These group theoretic and abstract<br>algebraic considerations are especially<br>valuable becuase [1] they reveal musical<br>similarities between equal temperaments<br>which might on the surface seem different--<br>and these similarties in musicalpractice<br>turn out to be vividly and clearly audible;<br>for instance, recently these considerations<br>led me to turn a 9-tet composition into<br>a 15-tet compositions by expanding the<br>intervals by a fixed factor and calculating<br>the closest pitches in 15-tet. The result<br>was extremely successful from a musical<br>standpoint: both compositions sounded<br>nearly identical musically, yet distinguishable<br>in interesting ways (from an intonational <br>standpoint).<br>Why transfer a composition in 15-tet into<br>9-tet, rather than into 12-tet or 18-tet?<br>9 is more similar to 15 than to 12 or 18<br>from a group theoretic viewpoint because<br>9 and 15 are both multiples of 3 and<br>thus share identical major thirds of<br>400 cents. 12 and 18 also boast the<br>same 400-cent major thirds, but in 12<br>the 7-unit p5 is relatively prime to 12<br>as well as absolutely prime.<br>However, in both 9 and 15 the p5 (or<br>its closest approximation) is composite.<br>In 9-tet, the closest to the p5 is<br>5 units (remember that 5 modulo 9 =<br>4, composite) while the closest to the <br>p5 in 15-tet is 9 units (also composite). <br>The 9-tet min 3rd + maj 3rd = 2 units + <br>3 units = 5 units, while in 15-tet the minor<br>3rd + major 3rd = 4 units + 5 units = 9 units.<br>This means that in 15-tet, the major<br>3rd is prime but a factor of the<br>total number of pitches in the octave, while <br>in 9 the major third is also prime and <br>a factor of the total number of pitches<br>in the octave.<br>Conversely, in both 9 and 15 tet<br>the minor third is relatively prime<br>to the total number of pitches. This<br>is very different from 12, in which<br>both major 3rd and minor 3rd are<br>factors of the total number of pitches,<br>while the major third is prime<br>but the minor third is composite.<br>Likewise, 9 and 15 exhibit radically<br>different internal substructure from<br>18: in that temperament, the minor 3rd<br>+ major 3rd = 5 units + 6 units =<br>11 units, the closest approach to<br>the p5 (733.333 cents). <br>But notice that in 18, the major<br>third is a factor of the total number<br>of pitches as well as being composite,<br>while the minor 3rd is both prime<br>and relatively prime to the total<br>number of pitches. Thus both 18<br>and 12 are very unlike 9 and 15<br>in group theoretic terms: the<br>symmetry groups formed by chains<br>of major or minor thirds in 9 will<br>be much more like those formed in<br>15 than in either 12 or 18.<br>--<br>In my experience, the most important<br>audible properties of equal tempered<br>scales are: [1] the presence or<br>absence of recognizable fifths<br>according to Blackwood's criterion;<br>[2] the melodic substructure (whole-<br>tone scale, semitone scale, 1/3-tone<br>scale, 1/5-tone scale, etc.) of the ET;<br>[3] the group theoretic/abstract<br>algebraic substructure of the equal<br>temperament.<br>As controversial as it might sound,<br>in my experience the presence or<br>absence of precise approximations<br>of members of the harmonic series<br>is relatively unimportant in determing<br>how the equal temperaments function<br>musically--except when an equal <br>temperament has a "p5" so far away<br>from the 3rd harmonic as to sound<br>grossly and unremittingly dissonant.<br>(In general, the limit seems to be<br>685.4 < p5 < 720 cents. Again, this<br>is the Blackwood/Rasch criterion,<br>and it explains what one hears<br>in the ETs beautifully.)<br>Whether a perfect 5th is 720 cents<br>or 685.4 cents or 700 cents is<br>in my musical experience a trivial<br>consideration--regardless of the<br>exact degree of approximation of<br>the p5, all thse types of perfect<br>fifths sound entirely convincing<br>and functional in completely<br>effective musical ways when used<br>with the equal temperaments from<br>which they derive.<br>Thus, most of the work which has<br>been done theoretically about the<br>equal temperaments seems to be<br>musically irrelevant to and <br>almost completely disconnected from<br>what the ear actually *hears* in<br>musical terms in these equal<br>temperaments. In particular, theoretically<br>fascinating structures like Clarence<br>Barlow's harmonicity and David Rothenberg's <br>propriety appear to have no audible connection <br>whatever to any  any audible functional property of<br>the xenharmonic equal temperaments<br>which I have been able to ascertain.<br>Needless to say, all of these<br>statements will be greeted with the<br>utmost delight by the members of this<br>tuning forum.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 10 Dec 1996 23:24 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA21651; Tue, 10 Dec 1996 23:26:37 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00402<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id OAA00750; Tue, 10 Dec 1996 14:26:34 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 10 Dec 1996 14:26:34 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612102215.OAA00212@eartha.mills.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
