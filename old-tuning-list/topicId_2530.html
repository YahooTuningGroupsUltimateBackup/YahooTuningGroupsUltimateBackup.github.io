That's partially<br>because the existing musical terminology makes sense in 19et. Which<br>means, essentially, that traditional ways of composing and performing<br>music work in 19et.

But, as Neil points out, the diatonic b7ths are unbelievably far<br>from forming nice 7-limit tetrads, so dominant sevenths (and arguably<br>half-diminished sevenths) sound better in 12et than in 19et.<br><br>What Neil doesn't point out, and what I would recommend he explore in<br>his playing, is that using the #6th instead of the b7th leads to a much<br>better set of septimal intervals. For example, in 12et, playing a B and<br>an F together is ambiguous as to whether the root is G or C#. In 19et,<br>the root is much more clearly C#, while a B and an E# will evoke a root<br>of G. It sounds to me like Neil, when playing a blues in G or D, is<br>sticking to the diatonic F in some places where an E# might be much more<br>consonant. I very often hear blues or pop music which, if transposed to<br>the key of D, uses a septimal E# over the G (IV) chord, and slightly<br>less often I hear the #6 over the I chord. Weighing against the<br>acoustical superiority of the #6th is the familiarity and symmetry of<br>the traditional diatonic scale, and the fact that 19et's 7-limit<br>intervals often deviate from JI in the opposite direction than 12et's<br>approximations of the same intervals, leading to a very strong initial<br>"that's out-of-tune" reaction.<br><br>31et is just like 19et but more so (i.e., 7-limit intervals based on the<br>augmented sixth chord are nearly just; those based on the diatonic b7<br>are worse than 12et but not as bad as the same in 19et.) It also has<br>great 11-limit approximations.<br><br>22et is completely non-traditional. The fact that the product of four<br>perfect fifths does not approximate a 5:1 ratio throws a wrench into the<br>works. You have to scrap the usual notions about how to tune the guitar,<br>scales, chords, and keys (not to mention repertoire!), or at least<br>retreat to a much more bare-bones set of definitions in order to build<br>an understanding of the tuning back up. You can read my paper on John<br>Starrett's web site to see at least one approach. 34et is<br>non-traditional as well, but the inequality between major and minor<br>whole tones is much less noticeable than in 22et, and making a "comma"<br>adjustment, often necessary when trying to force traditional chord<br>progressions into non-traditional tunings, is more disturbing when the<br>adjustment is as large as 1/22 octave.<br><br>So 22et forces you to abandon much of what you have learned about how<br>music works. It has much better 7-limit approximations than 19et, and<br>will even get you as close to the 11-limit as Harry Partch's own voice<br>could (max. error 20.1 cents). 34et is not consistent beyond the<br>5-limit.<br><br>15et and 27et are also nice, non-traditional tunings. 26et is<br>"traditonal" in a sense but turns 12et's deviations from 5-limit JI<br>upside-down. 26et's leading tone of 138 cents (3/26 oct) is certainly<br>unusual-sounding, and it can even sound better to use a harmonically<br>false leading tone to get a more familiar interval of resolution (92<br>cents or 2/26 oct). But 26et has a nice way of introducing 7-limit<br>harmony (two diatonic scales tuned a half-octave apart will each contain<br>the 7-limit completion of all of the other's 5-limit triads!) and is<br>even consistent through the 13-limit. Finally, 29et is worth considering<br>since it is consistent all the way through the 15-limit.<br><br>If you want to get really non-traditional, try 24.6063et, which gives<br>you great approximations of all ratios of odd numbers through 13, but<br>forget about even numbers!<br><br>As for fingering, it does help if you already have calloused fingers,<br>otherwise your finger will just mash over several frets and probably<br>dampen the string's vibrations somewhat.
