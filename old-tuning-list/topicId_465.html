I suspect that Enrique nailed it right on the head:  Much of our music<br>education system seems backward-looking to innovators, because they're concerned<br>with understanding what's already out there at higher priority than (or at least<br>earlier in the curriculum than) what is possible for the future.<br><br>   And as mentioned earlier, the classic Harmony, Ear-Training, Counterpoint,<br>Orchestration, and such classes exist for the benefit of more musical<br>concentrations than composition majors.

I suspect that the most likely to get such things into<br>standard musical curricula, is to begin - and this has already started to a<br>limited degree - by recognizing the concept of a Sitar Major, or perhaps a<br>Gamelan major, at equal stature with a Piano or Violin major for example.  These<br>concepts exist to some degree as exotic specialties at the PhD or occasionally<br>MA levels, but to admit them as alternative meat-and-potatos theoretical<br>underpinnings will require that they be available at the BA level.<br><br>   That sort of effort will prove difficult to make accepted practice, we must<br>realize.  Andres Segovia fought one heck of battle to get the guitar recognized<br>as a legitimate instrument for Applied curricula.  Perhaps it's fair to argue<br>that that was then and this is now, and again with globalization of culture, it<br>just may work this time.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 9 Jun 1996 03:58 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id SAA24875; Sat, 8 Jun 1996 18:57:58 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 8 Jun 1996 18:57:58 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960608185549.18734A-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Music Education Priorities</h1><h3><a id=3034 href="#3034">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/1996 5:45:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Aha!
