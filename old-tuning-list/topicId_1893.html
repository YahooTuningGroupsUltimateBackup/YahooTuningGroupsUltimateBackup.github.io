The first is very near the skin and appears to be a<br>dark color (its true color is a flourescent red).  The second extends<br>about three inches from the body; the third extends, on the average, six<br>inches from the body.  The first field is simply the radiation of body<br>heat, i.e., infrared.  The second and third fields are the inner and outer<br>edges, respectively, of eight distinct energy fields oscillating within<br>this mixed range.  The prodominant color of the edge closest to the body<br>and of the outer edge have been observed to change continually as one<br>force cen ter (and therefore the color field of that particular center)<br>dominates the others.<br><br>This color phenomenon is characterized by the continual change in dominant<br>color brought about by the person turning towards different points of the<br>compass or moving to different geographic locations.  Thus no single color<br>dominates the total field for a ny great length of time.  In general, the<br>energy field around the human organism appears violet or bluish, but<br>fluctuates for various reasons. <br><br>Individual energy fields may be discerned at various parts of the<br>organism, such as the hands, elbows, shoulders, breasts, hips, knees,<br>feet.  Diseased areas give off distinctly separate radiation, usually in<br>the form of infrared.  It is interesting to no te that the human physical<br>organism is composed of chemicals, predominantly water, held together in a<br>state that is more representative of a liquid than of a solid. <br><br>The energy fields enveloping the physical organism may be, not the product<br>of the body's chemical components, but rather seperate electromagnetic<br>bodies with INDEPENDENT NERVOUS SYSTEMS that react to radiation.  This<br>relationship would make the human orga nism as much an electrical as a<br>chemical phenomenon.  Therefore, we can no longer regard the physical<br>chemical organism as more "real" than the non-physical electric organism. <br>On the contrary, we must in fact consider the visible or physical organism<br>as secondary to the invisible electromagnetic or cosmic/solar organism. <br>(Here is strong support for the old metaphysical view that the human<br>complex is more electric than chemical, more "spiritual" than physical.) <br>There is every reason to believe that the energy fields are the source of<br>life and may have the potential of surviving the death of the physical<br>organism.  The metaphysical question of immortality is bound up with these<br>fields. <br><br>Man is a photo-complex.  Photosensitization of the energy fields and the<br>ionization of the physical organism through the irradiation od sunlight<br>has certain therapeutic benefits.  The net result is an expanded state of<br>being through development of the psy chic attributes.  Metabolism is<br>regulated by the endocrine glands, which control the chemical processes<br>governing the generation of new cells and the destruction of old ones.  To<br>a high degree the endocrines are responsible for the continual health,<br>youth fulness, long life, and states of behavior of the organism.  While<br>traditional science adequately describes the process of metabolism and the<br>function of the endocrines, we must accept the possibility that these<br>glands are governed by forces outside the human organism: solar rythms. <br><br>States of health, youthfulness and longevity may be governed by built-in<br>clock systems determined by factors inherited from our parents; however,<br>the ability of an individual to alter endocrine regulation through certain<br>techniques is something new and unsuspected. <br><br>Although the fields are interrelated with the physical organism, they are<br>representative of a more refined cosmic body which requires<br>electromagnetic (not chemical) nourishment directly from the source of all<br>life, the sun.  The energy fields, I suspect, would therefore affect the<br>biophysical organism."(pp164-166) <br><br>This is getting long enough for now.
