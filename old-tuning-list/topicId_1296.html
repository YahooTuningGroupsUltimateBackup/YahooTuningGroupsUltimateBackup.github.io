Johnny Reinhard<br>has mentioned that the 5/4 supplanted the 81/64 throughout<br>the European continent during hte 15th century, and this is<br>correct (as usual) albeit scant of detail.  The full story is there's<br>good reason to believe that 5/4s were used as thirds as early<br>as the 12th century, but it took a long period of theoretical<br>and politcal struggle to force the hidebound Pythagorean-Boethian<br>hierarchy to accept the new intervals.  The struggle was pretty<br>much over by the 15th century, when these "new" 5/4 intervals<br>had become so commonplace that not even the textbook writers<br>tried to pretend that musical practice was based on Pythagorean<br>paradigms. Reminiscent of the struggle which goes on today to get<br>the hidebound post-Webern serialist/aleatorists like Daniel J.
