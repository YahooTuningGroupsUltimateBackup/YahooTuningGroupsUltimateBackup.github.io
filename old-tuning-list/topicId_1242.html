Is this an example<br>of "computer composition"?<br>Clearly not.<br>Let us then move on to consider a composer who<br>uses elaborate mathematics to generate timbres<br>and chords during the course of a composition.<br>Over his shoulder, the composer has an idiot<br>savant watching who observes which notes<br>the composer plays and calculates rapidly in <br>hi/r head the resulting notes and timbres <br>according to the composer's mathematical<br>procedures.  (One such prodigy, Johan Zacharias<br>Dase, boasted such astounding powers of <br>mental calculation that he calculated pi in<br>his head to 400 decimal places over the course<br>of 2 months.

To think of it another way, the elaborate<br>mathematics of the composer can surely be <br>boiled down to a set of charts and tables which<br>can be memorized.

The mathematics<br>recirculate, requiring some of the output to feed<br>back into the input.  Many millions of numbers must<br>be multiplied by weights, sieved with thousands<br>of rules, and random numbers must be generated<br>by multiple 32-bit numbers by one another to<br>obtain overflow and then shifting them right or<br>left by some larger number of bits.<br>This seems a clear case of "computer<br>composition" because the process is too elaborate<br>to be performed by any conceivable human in any<br>reasonable amount of time.<br>--<br>What do all these cases have in common?<br>Clearly, we make distinctions here depending<br>on the proportion of the computer's input to<br>the process of composition.  <br>If the proportion is very high, we can speak<br>meaningfully of "computer <br>composition."  If the proportion of computer<br>input is low, clearly we are talking<br>only about computer-aided composition.<br>Thus, true "computer composition" occurs only<br>when the process of composition *demands*<br>a computer and *exclusively* a computer. If a<br>human can perform the same operations, this<br>is not "algorithmic computer composition," it's<br>merely ordinary composition *aided by computer.*<br>This leads us to a clear distinction between <br>*computer-aided composition* and *algorithmic<br>computer composition.*<br>"Algorithmic computer composition" only occurs<br>when the overwhelming bulk of the compositional<br>process takes place in the computer.  <br>If most of the compositional process is human,<br>and the computer is used merely to keep track<br>of vectors in ratio space, or display morphological<br>shapes, etc., then we are clearly speaking of <br>"computer-aided composition."<br>My comments in my recent post referred *only* to <br>computer composition--that is, to composition in<br>which the composer sets up a computer program,<br>lets it go, and walks away.<br>Computer-aided composition is a whole different<br>kettle of fish, since it is de facto human composition<br>in which the computer is used as a convenient aid.<br>The line between the two is of course blurry; as<br>the proportion of human effort to computer<br>interpretation approaches 1:1, it becomes hard<br>to say whether the computer or the human is<br>composing.<br>My earlier comments should therefore not<br>be taken as an argument against the validity of<br>all composition involving computers, but rather<br>against the validity of compositions produced mainly<br>by unaided computer operations.  To put it bluntly,<br>winding up a computer and letting it spit out music<br>on its own didn't work in 1956 and has failed miserably <br>to produce any interesting musical results in the <br>ensuing 40 years.  Changing the number of tones per<br>octave does not promise to improve that track record.<br>However, computer-aided microtonal composition is<br>a wide-open field, and promises many fascinating<br>and aesthetically worthwhile results as new<br>approaches are tried and new algorithms developed.<br>In particular, computer *aided* composition might<br>prove very helpful in harmonizing a melody line in<br>an exotic microtonal intonation with too many notes<br>per octave for humans to navigate easily.<br>--mclaren <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 24 Nov 1996 18:45 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06149; Sun, 24 Nov 1996 18:46:42 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA05292<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA20801; Sun, 24 Nov 1996 09:46:40 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 24 Nov 1996 09:46:40 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9611241214.A27578-0100000@styx.ios.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4136 href="#4136">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@CompuServe.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/24/1996 2:12:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Perhaps this is a little frivolous, but let me also put in a plug for urging<br>lurkers to say "hi" and telling us all what you're interested in.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 24 Nov 1996 23:11 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06284; Sun, 24 Nov 1996 23:13:27 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06276<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id OAA22440; Sun, 24 Nov 1996 14:13:24 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 24 Nov 1996 14:13:24 -0800<br>Message-Id: <961124221017_71670.2576_HHB43-7@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4146 href="#4146">ðŸ”—</a>randy@tcm.mit.edu</h3><span>11/25/1996 9:53:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>As Johnny Reinhard and Gary Morrison have both extended this<br>invitation and since I have been feeling somewhat lurkish lately,<br>here's my introduction.<br><br>I've been following the tuning list since sometime in 1994.  I've been<br>interested in non-12tET tunings for about 10 years.  Discussions on<br>this list got me interested in non-12 ETs and non-octave tunings.  I<br>have recorded several hours of improvisations in various tunings on my<br>cranky old synth.  Whenever I read something about a new tuning that<br>strikes my interest, such as Mayumi Reinhard's Harmonic 13, I just<br>have to try it out to see what I can do with it.<br><br>I read Hindemith's "Craft of Musical Compositition" in the late 70s,<br>and it made a lot of sense to me at the time, but the discrepancy<br>between the harmonic series and its 12tET representation didn't hit me<br>until I tuned up some actual pitches on a synth in 1985.  I recorded<br>some pieces with harmonic series pitches and JI tunings around that<br>time.<br><br>I had heard some microtonal music during my college studies (in the<br>mid-70s; some Partch and Stockhausen and a few others) and some<br>"non-Western" musics (Gamelan, etc.), but I had always brushed it off<br>as being part of a fringe that didn't interest me much at the time.  I<br>even performed in a wind ensemble that tackeled a piece full of big<br>harsh quarter tone clusters.  So, some academics cover the topic even<br>if they aren't overly enthusiastic about it.  Enthusiasm (or lack of)<br>communicates a lot about the importance of a subject.<br><br>A couple of years ago, Brian McLaren sent me a copy of Ivor Darreg's<br>"Beyond the Xenharmonic Frontier."  My first listening to this music<br>drastically altered my musical perceptions - probably the single most<br>influential musical event for me in 10 years.  Since then I've been<br>playing with ETs, JIs and non-octave tunings on a regular basis.<br><br>Just because I don't post often, please don't get the wrong<br>impression.  I read every tuning digest, follow the discussions, and<br>try out many of the ideas presented.  If I don't participate in the<br>theoretical discussions, it's because I'm not so inclined to do the<br>scholarly research necessary to follow up on some of the ideas<br>presented and I find that I'm often lacking a means to communicate my<br>non-verbal ideas about them anyway.  One of the biggest limitations of<br>this forum is that ASCII is the only means available to represent<br>ideas.

If the proportion of computer<br>input is low, clearly we are talking<br>only about computer-aided composition.<br>Thus, true "computer composition" occurs only<br>when the process of composition *demands*<br>a computer and *exclusively* a computer. If a<br>human can perform the same operations, this<br>is not "algorithmic computer composition," it's<br>merely ordinary composition *aided by computer.*<br>This leads us to a clear distinction between <br>*computer-aided composition* and *algorithmic<br>computer composition.*<br>"Algorithmic computer composition" only occurs<br>when the overwhelming bulk of the compositional<br>process takes place in the computer.  <br>If most of the compositional process is human,<br>and the computer is used merely to keep track<br>of vectors in ratio space, or display morphological<br>shapes, etc., then we are clearly speaking of <br>"computer-aided composition."<br>My comments in my recent post referred *only* to <br>computer composition--that is, to composition in<br>which the composer sets up a computer program,<br>lets it go, and walks away.<br>Computer-aided composition is a whole different<br>kettle of fish, since it is de facto human composition<br>in which the computer is used as a convenient aid.<br>The line between the two is of course blurry; as<br>the proportion of human effort to computer<br>interpretation approaches 1:1, it becomes hard<br>to say whether the computer or the human is<br>composing.<br>My earlier comments should therefore not<br>be taken as an argument against the validity of<br>all composition involving computers, but rather<br>against the validity of compositions produced mainly<br>by unaided computer operations.  To put it bluntly,<br>winding up a computer and letting it spit out music<br>on its own didn't work in 1956 and has failed miserably <br>to produce any interesting musical results in the <br>ensuing 40 years.

I've been<br>interested in non-12tET tunings for about 10 years.  Discussions on<br>this list got me interested in non-12 ETs and non-octave tunings.  I<br>have recorded several hours of improvisations in various tunings on my<br>cranky old synth.  Whenever I read something about a new tuning that<br>strikes my interest, such as Mayumi Reinhard's Harmonic 13, I just<br>have to try it out to see what I can do with it.<br><br>I read Hindemith's "Craft of Musical Compositition" in the late 70s,<br>and it made a lot of sense to me at the time, but the discrepancy<br>between the harmonic series and its 12tET representation didn't hit me<br>until I tuned up some actual pitches on a synth in 1985.  I recorded<br>some pieces with harmonic series pitches and JI tunings around that<br>time.<br><br>I had heard some microtonal music during my college studies (in the<br>mid-70s; some Partch and Stockhausen and a few others) and some<br>"non-Western" musics (Gamelan, etc.), but I had always brushed it off<br>as being part of a fringe that didn't interest me much at the time.  I<br>even performed in a wind ensemble that tackeled a piece full of big<br>harsh quarter tone clusters.  So, some academics cover the topic even<br>if they aren't overly enthusiastic about it.  Enthusiasm (or lack of)<br>communicates a lot about the importance of a subject.<br><br>A couple of years ago, Brian McLaren sent me a copy of Ivor Darreg's<br>"Beyond the Xenharmonic Frontier."  My first listening to this music<br>drastically altered my musical perceptions - probably the single most<br>influential musical event for me in 10 years.  Since then I've been<br>playing with ETs, JIs and non-octave tunings on a regular basis.<br><br>Just because I don't post often, please don't get the wrong<br>impression.  I read every tuning digest, follow the discussions, and<br>try out many of the ideas presented.  If I don't participate in the<br>theoretical discussions, it's because I'm not so inclined to do the<br>scholarly research necessary to follow up on some of the ideas<br>presented and I find that I'm often lacking a means to communicate my<br>non-verbal ideas about them anyway.  One of the biggest limitations of<br>this forum is that ASCII is the only means available to represent<br>ideas.  It'll be a different world once we're able to include sounds<br>as fluently as we now use text.<br><br>Randy<br>************************************************************************<br>* Randy Winchester * randy@mit.edu * PO Box 1074, Cambridge, MA  02142 *<br>*       (617) 253-7431       *       http://web.mit.edu/randy/www      *<br>************************************************************************<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 25 Nov 1996 19:28 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07424; Mon, 25 Nov 1996 19:29:55 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07389<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id KAA05629; Mon, 25 Nov 1996 10:29:47 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 25 Nov 1996 10:29:47 -0800<br>Message-Id: <9611251828.AA13362@ ccrma.Stanford.EDU ><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4152 href="#4152">ðŸ”—</a>Steven Rezsutek &#x3C;steve@synapse.gsfc.nasa.gov&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/1996 4:12:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Johnny Reinhard writes:<br> > This is an open invitation for all those lurkers out there to step <br> > forward and introduce yourself.
