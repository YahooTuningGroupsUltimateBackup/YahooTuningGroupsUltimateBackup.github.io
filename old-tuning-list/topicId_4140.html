My twofold error was think<br>in terms of 16 _notes_ (actually 15 tuning intervals), and to write<br>"fifth" when "fourth" is correct (i.e. 15 fourths up or fifths down).<br><br>Now we move to a much more delicate question of definition and taste<br>raised in a post on "Mathematical explanation of consonance" from<br>monz@juno.com:<br><br>> How does one explain the fact that so many musicians who are less<br>> "well tuned" than us will find 12-equal "3rd"s to be consonant, for<br>> instance?  Most of us on this List wouldn't say that, but lots of<br>> other listeners would.<br><br>Personally, I might rephrase this a bit: "How does one explain the<br>fact that so many musicians ... apparently assume that 12-tet 3rds are<br>the 'ideal' and 'natural' versions of these intervals to use for all<br>periods and styles of music, as if no other tunings were known?"<br><br>This whole question could lead into lots of areas, and here I'll just<br>try to address a few.<br><br>First of all, as someone working mainly with just (3-based or<br>Pythagorean) and "semi-just" (1/4-comma meantone) tunings, and also<br>with 17-tet, I'd say that 12-tet 3rds can and do serve as full<br>consonances in triadic or post-triadic music, and have done so at<br>least since the middle of the 16th century, when 12-tet was already<br>being described as a standard tuning for the lute.<br><br>This doesn't mean that 16th-century musicians, who were likely _not_<br>generally accustomed to 12-tet but rather to 5-based just intonation<br>for voices and meantone approximations of it on keyboard, found a<br>12-tet third _ideally_ "concordant." Vincenzo Galilei, in his<br>_Fronimo_, speaks as both an accomplished lutenist and a tuning<br>theorist when he recognizes that major thirds with the standard 12-tet<br>fretting _are_ larger than the Renaissance ideal of 5:4, but<br>nevertheless finds them acceptably concordant.<br><br>Interestingly, he explains this acceptability by pointing to the<br>quality of the lute's strings, which tend to "soften" the sharpness of<br>these thirds. I don't know if this means a new trend with people<br>wearing t-shirts saying: _Vincenzo Galilei was a proto-Setharian_, but<br>he did distinguish between the timbre of a lute and a harpsichord<br>(customarily tuned in meantone), the latter being more intonationally<br>sensitive.<br><br>At the same time, he pokes a bit of fun at people who add _tastini_ or<br>"little frets" to the lute in order to get more just thirds. His<br>argument is basically: (1) These people often in practice wind up<br>playing intolerably out-of-tune fifths when the system gets too<br>complicated; and (2) A true virtuoso (like Galilei himself) doesn't<br>need such extra gadgets to impress an audience.<br><br>What we're dealing with, then, is what has been called "categorical<br>perception": in music, as in natural language, a vowel, consonant, or<br>harmonic consonance for that matter may vary somewhat in its<br>pronunciation or size and still be recognizable to the listener.<br><br>Differences between dialects of various languages might be analogous<br>to variations in tuning a "major 3rd," for example: it might be 386<br>cents in 5-based JI or 1/4-comma meantone, 379 cents in 1/3-comma<br>meantone or 19-tet (proposed in the 16th-century), 400 cents in<br>12-tet, or shift depending on the key between values ranging anywhere<br>from 386 cents to around 408 cents in the various well-temperaments<br>standard for harpsichords and soon also pianos during the era of about<br>1680-1880.<br><br>For a major third that the listener is expected to recognize as fully<br>concordant or stable in a Renaissance-Romantic setting, there do seem<br>to be outer tolerances. One line of demarcation is that an interval<br>much larger than the regular Pythagorean M3 (81:64 or 408 cents) may<br>be heard as a quite "dissonant" or "Wolvish" interval obviously "out<br>of tune." Another line, proposed by Easley Blackwood, is around 406<br>cents, the point where he feels that major thirds are just subdued<br>enough to form stable triads. By his standard, 12-tet is clearly<br>within this range.<br><br>However, "acceptable" and "ideal" are two different questions. For<br>16th-century music, I'd agree with Mark Lindley and _lots_ of attuned<br>listeners that 12-tet on an organ-like or harpsichord-like keyboard<br>would be a very serious compromise; which doesn't mean that one<br>couldn't enjoy the music, only that it would be an arrangement of<br>necessity rather than ideal beauty. In fact, I'd tend to stick pretty<br>much with 1/4-comma meantone (or 1/3-comma/19-tet for at least one<br>chanson by Costeley where it is explicitly indicated, and maybe<br>Zarlino's 2/7-comma for certain kinds of pieces), going to 13 notes<br>per octave or 15 or even 17 or 19 where required. Such are the<br>advantages of microtunable synthesizers.<br><br>Also, as has been pointed out by others in this thread, consonance is<br>a complex matter of stylistic expectations and "acclimatization" as<br>well as tuning ratios. In 13th-14th century European music, major<br>thirds are stylistically treated as "partial concords," and<br>Pythagorean tuning does a nice job of putting a bit of an accent on<br>the _partial_ in that statement. However, even if I played Perotin in<br>1/4-comma meantone with pure 5:4 major thirds, these intervals would<br>sound "_relatively_ concordant but unstable" to me, because this is<br>the musical definition of the language around 1200.<br><br>While I'd agree with 16th-century theorists that 5:4 and 6:5 are ideal<br>ratios for thirds in a style based on concordant triads, maybe a view<br>fitting my preference for Renaissance and Manneristic music as my<br>favorite triadic styles, lots of other approaches are possible. For<br>example, as Ed Foote has discussed, well-temperaments with their "key<br>color" exploit a subtle scale of microtonal consonance and dissonance,<br>and one I might add which seems based both on categorical recognition<br>(even a triad in one of the most remote keys is still recognizable as<br>a triad) and on tangible distinctions.<br><br>Having become acquainted with the experiments of Gary Morrison with<br>88-cet, for example, where even his "supermajor" thirds of 440 cents<br>(roughly 9:7) may successfully be treated as "consonant," I'd say that<br>there is indeed a xenharmonic continuum, and that 400 cents is just<br>one point on that continuum, neither especially bad nor necessarily<br>the best.<br><br>There are circumstances where 400 cents might be an ideal choice,<br>specifically late Romantic pieces which seem to assume a close<br>equivalence of all transpositions on the circle of fifths, and also<br>12-tone serialist works (yes, 11-tet serialism is a viable<br>alternative, too).
