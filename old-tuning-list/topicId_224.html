The fact that his ideas are presented with such <br>erudite precision makes it perhaps difficult to question such <br>scholarly thinking--in fact they are a marvel to read and <br>stimulating to the intellect.  We are fortunate that Brian <br>graces this forum with his thoughts.  Non the less, I am <br>concerned with the thrust of his argument.<br><br>	Perhaps I'm a bit "old fashioned", but I have always <br>been under the impression that this whole tuning business came <br>about with the effort to seek perfection or at least that which <br>is more perfect in an imperfect world--or, perhaps create order <br>out of chaos, or meaning and understanding out of the apparent <br>random senslessness of events in our lives and the inevitable <br>death of all that lives.  Put another way, we seem to be drawn <br>to attempt to link our experience with something beyond the <br>immediate--whether this be to establish a calender to predict <br>the seasons and reassure ourselves of better times during long <br>winter nights or laws and courts to better control or predict <br>relationships with the neighbors, or musical scales, to better <br>harmonize with the eternal.  Of course there are a great many <br>opinions as to what that perfection is, or perhaps more <br>accurately, what the best approximation of that perfection is <br>in this imperfect world.  Obviously we may never find <br>perfection here, or the Good, or Platonic forms or the <br>Archetypes of which this imperfect temporal world (Plato's <br>cave) in which we find ourselves is but a shadowy reflection. <br>But an element of the human spirit, or psyche if you will, <br>resides in this world and seeks to commune with the eternal.  I <br>believe that music is one of the main potential avenues of <br>expression of this Soul.  Music in its most sublime expression <br>is always a search for or expression of transcendance.  That <br>which does not is an intellectual or emotional masturbation.<br><br>	Can it be that that we have come to the brink of<br>nihilism with regards to tuning?  Is it possible for me to walk<br>around my room striking random objects to create bongs and<br>thugs and dinks with which I can then, with tremendous<br>mathematical insight, create some sort of algorithmic<br>justification for unifying this cacophany of tones into a<br>"musical" scale?  What possible value can be derived from such<br>an exercise?  Or is it more appropriate to generate a scale<br>from some imaginary number series?  irrational or<br>transcendental numbers?  Aren't we here, like Toad, "just<br>messing about in boats"?<br><br>	Non the less, I believe Brian's scholarship can be <br>interpreted at least 2 ways.  First, and perhaps expressing the <br>apparent thrust of Brian's own argument, that scientific <br>experimentation reveals that simple principles of acoustics <br>that seem to have been perhaps unconsciously taken for granted <br>for such a long time and formed the driving force behind 12 ET <br>do not adequately describe the phenomenon of hearing--that <br>hearing itself is an extremely complex process and that no <br>current model adequately describes all of the observable facts <br>of its processes.  And because of this there is no <br>justification for accepting one particular tuning system over <br>another--in fact many mathematical models exist for basing <br>tuning schemes.  Actually an almost infinite variety of tuning <br>schemes are available based upon concrete mathematical models.  <br>The impression left is that vast new worlds of exploration are <br>available for dabbling for the pioneering spirit.  But to what <br>end? I must ask myself.  Is there not some higher vision, other <br>than that it is new or different, that directs this thrust?<br><br>	I believe that it can be equally interpretted that the <br>scientific evidence merely demonstrates the imperfection of <br>this world and the imperfection of scientific measuring <br>devices, mental models, etc.  Is it a wonder that vibrating <br>strings or columns of air do not describe mathematically <br>"perfect" features, given molecular constraints, gravity, <br>friction, etc.?  It is equally unsurprising that the hearing <br>process in all its complexities does not hold to a simple model <br>due to the imperfection of its function.  This in no way, <br>though, proves that simple mathematical models are not the <br>templates which this "real world" imperfectly reflects.  Why <br>should not musical scale attempt to reflect how sound itself is <br>generated--not the imperfection as it manifests in the world <br>around us, but as it is described by a so called perfectly <br>vibrating body.  Could this somehow lead that part of the human <br>psyche which can respond to things perfect and eternal towards <br>a meaning beyond the apparent meaningless chaos that so often <br>confronts us here?<br><br><br>Bruce Kanzelmeyer<br><br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 16 Dec 1995 20:13 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id LAA16343; Sat, 16 Dec 1995 11:13:02 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 16 Dec 1995 11:13:02 -0800<br>Message-Id: <01BACBEA.4DCA4F80@mac15.emap.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Thoughts on Brian's posts</h1><h3><a id=2381 href="#2381">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Jo A.
