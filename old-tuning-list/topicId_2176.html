Don't worry if you<br>didn't get that last bit, folks, it isn't important!<br><br>Anyway, my main point in writing is to draw a comparison<br>between the odd-limit and the ROHS.  Referring to my last<br>message of a few days ago, the 7-limit clearly lies within<br>the ROHS (x 1 1 1)H where x can be anything, to give octave<br>equivalence.  This is the same as the Euler genus 3.5.7.<br><br>Not all the members of the genus 3.5.7 are within the 7-limit.<br>(3 -1 1 0)H, or 15/8, for a start.  For intervals within an<br>octave, though, the ROHS (2 1 1 1)H contains all 7-limit<br>intervals and only a few outside it -- (-1 1 1 -1)H or 15/14,<br>etc.  In otonal or utonal form, these exceptions disappear as<br>odd primes cannot appear in both the numerator and<br>denominator.<br><br>If you reduce your chord so that all the intervals are<br>within the first octave above the otonal root, the ROHS<br>(2 1 1 1)H is identical to the 7-limit.  The saturated<br>chord being:<br><br>             (-2 0 0 1)<br>             (-2 0 1 0)<br>             (-1 1 0 0)H<br>             ( 0 0 0 0)<br><br>The ROHS occupied by the largest interval within a chord will<br>always be the same as the ROHS occupied by the whole chord.<br>This is why the ROHS is superior to the odd limit from a<br>number theoretic point of view.  It is also why, IMHO, the<br>ROHS is the superior way of classing scales.<br><br>The equivalent utonal chord can be found by multiplying the<br>chord above by -1.  This is the same as arranging the notes<br>in the octave below the utonal root.  Where the otonal root<br>will always be (0 0 0 0)H, the utonal root is equal to the<br>ROHS with the octave term negated.  Therefore, the octave<br>reduced utonal (2 1 1 1)H chord is:<br><br>         (0  0  0  0)                    (-2 1 1 1)<br>         (1 -1  0  0)                    (-1 0 1 1)<br>         (2  0 -1  0)H (2 -1 -1 -1)H + ( 0 1 0 1)H<br>         (2  0  0 -1)                    ( 0 1 1 0)<br><br>For consistency with the odd-limit idea, only otonal and<br>utonal reductions are allowed.  This rules out octave reduced<br>(2 1 1 1)H, non 7-limit chords like the following:<br><br>                  (-2 0 1 1)<br>                  (-1 1 0 1)H<br>                  ( 0 1 1 0)<br><br>Hence o/utonal 7-limit chords are the same thing as o/utonal<br>octave reduced ROHSs.  Beyond the 7-limit, though, this<br>equivalence no longer holds, just as the two kinds of<br>odd-limit diverge.  As the odd-limit idea is itself an<br>extrapolation from conventional harmony, I would suggest<br>that the ROHS method is the best way of extending it to<br>higher primes.<br><br>The ROHS is also a useful way of categorising chord changes.<br>This is a very important subject, and one that is rarely<br>mentioned on the list.  However, I will not go into it today.<br><br>I suggest that the ROHS should also be emancipated from<br>octave reduction.  Then the interval 15/1 comes out as<br>less dissonant than 15/8.  My ears tell me that there is<br>some justification for this.  I don't go with octave<br>invariance, because different inversons of major triads<br>definitely sound different.  All the 'nice' versions of 4<br>note major triads fall within the ROHS (3 1 1)H.  The ones<br>that stay within (1 1 1)H also sound particularly nice.<br>However, the (2 1 1)H ones are not neccessarily better than<br>the (3 1 1)H ones.  There seems to be a premium on having the<br>root doubled.  The idea of root doubling, though, implies the<br>idea of octave invariance. I might some time get round to<br>extending Kameoka and Kuriyagawa's dissonance algorithm to 4<br>note chords to see if it sheds any light on this.<br><br>                        Graham<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 29 Jun 1997 18:34 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA17021; Sun, 29 Jun 1997 18:34:36 +0200<br>Date: Sun, 29 Jun 1997 18:34:36 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA16996<br>Received: (qmail 2093 invoked from network); 29 Jun 1997 16:33:47 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 29 Jun 1997 16:33:47 -0000<br>Message-Id: <memo.976637@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5718 href="#5718">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>7/1/1997 6:10:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Second, some of us evidently don't believe that octave equivalence (2:1, give<br>>or take a few cents :-) should be taken for granted ...
