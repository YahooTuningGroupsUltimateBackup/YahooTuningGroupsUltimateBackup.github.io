So the amplitude of<br>>> this period-2 subharmonic could have been changing, and it could cease<br>>> to exist for a while, returning again just as easily after either an odd<br>>> or even number of period-1 oscillations.<br><br>>This assumes the system is teetering in a bifurcation point, which is<br>>actually very unlikely.<br><br>Not unlikely at all! Look again at a bifurcation diagram -- there is<br>quite a large range of values where the period-2 behavior has a<br>relatively constant amplitude, but at one end of this range the<br>amplitude suddenly decreases and period-1 behavior ensues. If the<br>bassoonist is trying to keep within this range, say because he is trying<br>to play as loud as he can and octave subharmonics don't bother him but<br>chaos does, the parameter will likely take on just such a range of<br>values.<br><br>>I'd guess the amplitude of the subharmonic is<br>>chaotic.

Similar things might occur with<br>>differential equations of 2 parameters for all I'd know.<br><br>Actually, a differential equation needs to have at least 3 parameters<br>for chaos to occur. However, the picture along whichever of the<br>parameters is responsible for chaos will be the good old bifurcation<br>diagram.
