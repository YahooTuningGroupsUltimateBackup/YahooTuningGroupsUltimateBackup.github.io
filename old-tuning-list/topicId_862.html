The book of Allen Forte had have an important influence in France<br>impulsed by the IRCAM people. It has completely masked the works<br>of a French musicologue Edmond Costere who had published a<br>theory very closed to pitch set theory. <br>E. Costere : Lois et styles des harmonies musicales, Paris, Paris, 1954.<br>E. Costere : Mort ou transfiguration de l'harmonie, Paris, PUF, 1962.<br><br>2. Ronald Bruce Smith said that Magnus Lindberg is the only IRCAM<br>composer that had a knowledge of Forte's theory. Many others composers<br>(Tristan Murail, Hugues Dufourt, Jean-Yves Bosseur etc....)<br>perfectly know the Forte's theory, but they don't used in their <br>own compositions. Magnus has said (I can't remember where but I have read it)<br>that he used the pitch set theory in his compositions. Perhaps the book<br>had been introduce in France by IRCAM. I remember, I had bought it in<br>the St-Paul-Meanneapolis Fine Arts Museum Book store and have not<br>seen it before in France.<br><br>3. The "objet sonore" is a concept of Pierre Schaeffer and electro-acoustic<br>music, born in the GRM (Groupe de Recherches Musicales), not really a "friend"<br>of the IRCAM because they have to deal with the same pie... Messiaen, Dutilleux<br>and Boulez don't refer to the "objet sonore".<br><br>4. If IRCAM had opened "les nouveaux espaces", "a rather large and impressive <br>extension to their building in Beaubourg" said Smith, IRCAM has also always been<br>in crisis. Many people think that IRCAM has imposed his esthetics in the french<br>developpement of the music, had marginalized many other musical institutions<br>and eat to much money for what they do.

I just<br>don't think the diatonic scale, or even the major mode, was derived this<br>way.<br><br>>My paper is an attempt to find a set of pitches<br>>which, like the diatonic scale, stands up on a melodic basis alone, but<br>>leads as naturally to 7-limit harmony and 7-limit tonality, as the diatonic<br>>scale leads to 5-limit harmony and tonality, and (if you believe Yasser was<br>>on the right track) as the pentatonic scale leads to 3-limit harmony and<br>>tonality.<br><br>I look forward to your paper.
