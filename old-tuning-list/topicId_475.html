He has written articles<br>on 16th- and 17th-century intonation which qualify as<br>definitive, and he's written a book which stands alone<br>as a reference on the tuning of lutes & other antique<br>fretted instruments.<br>Alas, this book is a disappointment in several respects,<br>though it has much to recommend it.<br>The problems with "Mathematical Models of Musical<br>Scales" are many and varied.<br>To summarize:<br>[1] The book starts with a distinctly polemical slant<br>and never lets up.<br>[2] Instead of using the standard measurement of cents,<br>Lindley and Turner-Smith inexplicably choose to use<br>millioctaves (1/1000 of an octave).  Worse, they<br>introduce confusing and bizarre temrinology: "flog," <br>set membership symbols, Boolean logic symbols, etc.<br>Such symbology and terrinology would prove dense<br>but reasonable reading for a mathematics paper--<br>but for a music paper, this kind of mathematical <br>arcana is damned hard to read and extract any <br>musical meaning from.<br>In particular, it's almost impossible to shift gears<br>from sentences like "A mapping which is both 1-1 *and*<br>onto is called a bijection or a 1-1 correspondence. A<br>bijection of a set X *to itself* is called a <br>permutation of X." to sentences like "In 18th century<br>French keyboard tuning, one or two major thirds (Db-F,<br>Ab-C) were larger than pure by a little more than 2% of<br>an octave, although people at the time said these <br>particular 3rd were harsh and in fact meantone<br>temperaments had originally come into use because 15th-<br>century organists considered unacceptable a major 3rd<br>(comprising two 9:8 whole tones) which is larger than<br>pure by a little *less* than 2% of an octave."<br>[3] Throughout the book, Lindley and Turner-Smith<br>consistently disparage and belittle non-12 <br>divisions of the octave.  Typical is the following:<br>"However in the 1550s a talented French composer,<br>Costeley, wrote a song for the 19 divisions, and in <br>1577 a Spanish theorist, Salinas, showed how to <br>tune it on a keyboard instrument by using the pure<br>major 6ths and minor 3rd of 1/3-comma meantone<br>temperament.  Experimentation went on in the 17th<br>century and since, but posterity has judged the<br>system unsatisfactory."  This will come as a<br>surprise to many of the members of this tuning<br>forum, who are at present engaged in composing <br>and performing music in the 19-tone equal<br>temperament.  In fact 19-TET is the most common,<br>almost the closest in sound to 12-TET of the "teen"<br>temperaments (22-TET is closer), and perhaps the <br>easiest to use of the < 20 TET equal temperaments. <br>[4] Despite the title, the overwhelming thrust<br>of this book is a consideration of general mathematical<br>models of the musical scales used from the 15th through<br>the 18th centuries.  Lindley and Turner-Smith do not,<br>despite the implication of their title, consider<br>the musical ramifications of systems such as <br>Harry Partch's extended just intonation, Enrique<br>Moreno's non-octave scales, Mandelbaum's multiple<br>divisions of the octave, or my own non-just non-<br>equal-tempered tunings.<br>To dilate on these points:<br>[1] The polemical slant.  The reader gets hit between<br>the eyes with the first sentence of the introduction:<br>"We reject the ancient Pythagorean idea that music<br>somehow 'is' number, and we show how to design<br>mathematical models for musical scales and<br>systems according to some more modern principles."<br>[Lindley, Mark, and Ronald Turner-Smith, "Mathematical<br>Models of Musical Scales," Orpheus, Bonn 1993,<br>Page 7]<br>This passage contains two statements which are<br>open to serious debate.  First, the authors reject<br>categorically the Pythagorean idea of "numerus<br>sonorus" in favor of an emprical Aristoxenian <br>definition of intervals and of music. <br>But the debate twixt Pythagorean and Aristoxenian<br>views on the nature of music has raged since the<br>beginning of Western music and no one has *ever*<br>succeeded in resolving the question.<br>Despite Lindley/Turner-Smith's efforts to paint<br>the Pythagorean viewpoint as "mystical" and<br>"unscientific," the fact remains that the Pythagorean<br>view is the basis of Western theoretical science.<br>In fact the Pytahgorean view ought to be called<br>the "theoretical science" view, since it encapsulates<br>and perfectly expresses all the ideals held by<br>scientific pure theorists: in the view of the pure<br>theorist, an infallible test of whether a mathematical<br>theory accurately models the real world is the<br>degree of mathematical beauty and "elegance" which<br>the theory exhibits.  Pure theorists typically reject<br>a scientific model of reality whose mathematics are<br>ugly and messy yet whose predictions are in good<br>accord with experiment, in favor of a scientific model<br>of reality whose mathematics are elegant and gorgeous<br>yet whose predicitions have not been tested yet, or<br>don't fall quite as close to experimental numbers.<br>There is good precedent for this.  The final elaboration<br>of the Potelamic epicycle model of the universe in<br>the 16th century produced excellent agreement with<br>astronomical observations of the movements of the<br>planets.  But scientists rejected the model of <br>Ptolemaic epicycles in favor of the Copernican <br>model largely on the basis of the mathematical<br>ugliness and complexity of the Ptolemaic system,<br>versus the simplicity and elegance of the <br>Copernican.<br>In modern times the best expression of the pure<br>theoretical (AKA Pythagorean) viewpoint is<br>given by Einstein: he was once asked what he would<br>have done if a phsyical experiment had contradicted<br>his theory of special relativity, and he answered<br>by saying that he would have felt sorry for the<br>dear Lord.<br>"Time and again the passion for understanding has<br>led to the illusion that man is able to comprehend<br>the objective world rationally, by pure thought,<br>without any empirical foundations--in short, by<br>metaphysics. I believe that every true theorist is a <br>kind of tamed metaphysicist, no matter how pure<br>a 'positivist' he may fancy himself.  The metaphysicist<br>believes that the logically simple is also the real.<br>The tamed metaphysicist believes that not all that<br>is logically simple is embodied in experienced<br>relatiy, but tha the totality of all sensory experience<br>can be 'comprehended' on the basis of a conceptual<br>system built on premises of great simplicity.<br>The skeptic will say that this is a 'miracle creed.'<br>Admittedly so, but it is a miracle creed which has<br>been borne out to an amazing extent by the<br>development of science." [Einstein, Albert,<br>"Ideas and Opinions, Pg. 333: originally from<br>"Scientific American," Vol. 182, No. 4, April, 1950]<br>This strain of Western thought is so fundamental<br>to rational inquiry that it is untenable to dismiss<br>the Pythagorean viewpoint as cavalierly as Lindley<br>and Turner-Smith have, just as it untenable to<br>cavalierly define *all* of music in terms of<br>the Pythagorean viewpoint that intervals<br>are numbers, thus numbers are simple ratios and<br>thus the simplest ratios are the most audibly<br>consonant, quod erat demonstrandum (yet dead<br>wrong).<br>As I've pointed out in prior posts, the strict<br>extreme hard-line Pythagorean viewpoint<br>fails when it encounters reality, since<br>the 3:5:7 triad demonstrably sounds less<br>consonant than the 4:5:6 triad--yet the<br>integers of the 3:5:7 triad are obviously<br>smaller.  A cadence which ends with a 4/3<br>in the bass is universally proscribed in all<br>Western harmony texts as a dissonance<br>to be avoided in favor of a 4:5:6 triad in<br>root position as the preferred final chord--<br>yet the 4/3 is clearly a smaller interval<br>than the 3/2.  And so on.<br>The Pythagorean hard-line view on musical<br>consonance and auditory perception also<br>fails the test of experiment, since 130<br>years of psychoacoustic tests have shown<br>no evidence of small-integer-ratio detectors<br>in the human auditory system, and  systematic<br>evidence that intervals not described in<br>terms of small whole number ratios are<br>heard as "pure" and "perfect consonances,"<br>while the purportedly "true" and "natural"<br>small-integer ratio intervals are universally<br>heard as "impure," "too narrow," "out of tune,"<br>and "flat."<br>The debate twixt Pythagorean (pure theorist)<br>and Aristoxenian (applied experimental science)<br>viewpoints is ongoing.  It represents a fundamental<br>dichotomy at the heart of Western culture.  It <br>cannot be resolved.<br>For Lindley and Turner-Smith to dismiss this<br>fundamental dichotomy at the heart of Western<br>culture with a wave of their hands is astonishing.<br>One would have thought a scholar of Lindley's <br>range and depth would recognize that <br>this ongoing debate twixt two schools of thought<br>is essential to the health of Western music.<br>Over the centuries the debate has shifted from<br>one side to the other, then back again, as new<br>evidence and new mathematics come to the fore.<br>At present the pendulum is swinging toward the<br>Aristoxenian extreme with the discovery that<br>even the most linear physical laws exhibit<br>unpredictably chaotic behavior.  However, recently<br>Ed Witten and others succeeded in demonstrating<br>that all of the five competing models of superstring<br>theory are subsumed under one overarching model.<br>If Witten and company can find a way to generate<br>actual numbers from superstring theory, the<br>pendulum may swing back to the Pyhagorean <br>extremum.<br>And so it goes in music.  With the collapse of<br>Helmholtz's theory and the findings of Ward,<br>Corso, Pikler, Sundberg and many others, grave<br>doubts have been cast on the advisability of<br>viewing music in terms of small whole numbers<br>as an adequate explanation of how we hear and<br>how we compose.  However, future experimental<br>evidence or future mathematical results might<br>shift the burden of proof back onto the Fetis-Ward-<br>Burns-Corso contingent who view harmony as<br>mostly a matter of brainwashing and "consonance"<br>and "dissonance" are largely learned habits.<br>The point is that the musical and cultural debate<br>is ongoing and never-ending, and it *cannot* be<br>prestidigitated away as Lindley and Turner-Smith<br>have sought to do.<br>The second problem with Lindley's and Turner-<br>Smith's argument is the implication that "modern"<br>methods of analyzing and generating musical scales<br>somehow equals "better." There is no evidence<br>for this.  Newer musical methods are not necessarily <br>"better" than older music.  Moreover,<br>the entire notion of the musical utility of *this* or<br>*that* mathematical method is cyclic.  Just intonation<br>and equal temperament periodically come into<br>and go out of fashion.  This has happened throughout<br>the history of Western music, and will doubtless<br>happen again. <br>[2] John Chalmers has already expressed doubts<br>about the wisdom of using non-standard units of<br>musical measurement such as the millioctave.<br>For my part, let me point out that it is as confusing<br>as encountering speed limit signs which give<br>numbers of furlongs per fortnight when<br>your speedometer is calibrated in miles per hour.<br>It is simply incomprehensible to me why Lindley<br>and Turner-Smith would choose to use a non-<br>standard unit of musical interval measurement.<br>[3] Lindley's and Turner-Smith's negative attitude <br>toward musical intonations with more than 12<br>pitch classes must be understood in context.<br>They are probably simply saying that there is<br>little historical precedent for such usage; but<br>this is mainly a question of technology, rather<br>than aesthetics or musicality.  In the era of<br>wooden machines (viz., the piano, the harpsichord)<br>it would have been impossibly difficult &<br>expensive to build a 5-octave instrument with<br>31 equal tones to the octave.  If such an instrument<br>could have been built, its keys would have been<br>too narrow to be fingered; and the instrument<br>itself would have been too mechanically complex<br>and too fragile to survive an actual performance.<br>Today, however, with digital tehcnology, other<br>intonations than 12 equal tones to the octave<br>can easily be had.  <br>Since Lindley and Turner-Smith's book is largely<br>an historical study (despite the title), its<br>dismissive attitude toward > 12 pitch classes<br>constitutes a judgment of practicality rather<br>than intrinsic worth, and so ought not to be taken <br>as the final word musical composition in <br>non-12 tunings--especially for *modern* <br>composers with access to retunable<br>digital instruments.<br>[4] The title of the book is probably overly<br>ambitious.  It would be better if the book had<br>been called "Mathematical Models of Musical<br>Scales from the Common Practice Period of<br>Western Music."  Within that context, the book <br>works very well.  In particular, the footnotes<br>and musical examples are superb.  Lindley<br>reveals the true range of his scholarship in<br>the footnotes and appendices--which make<br>more interesting reading than the rest of <br>the text.<br>All in all, this is a book recommended for those<br>interested in historical intonation with a<br>heavily partisan bias (toward emprical<br>science, away from pure theory). <br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 9 Jul 1996 22:30 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id NAA14751; Tue, 9 Jul 1996 13:30:35 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 9 Jul 1996 13:30:35 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960709202707_101655.321_IHN235-1@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3191 href="#3191">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/1996 2:07:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: Equal-beating chromatic scale<br>--<br>In vol. 29, No. 4 of the Journal of the<br>Acoustical Society of America, April<br>1957, A.

He has written articles<br>on 16th- and 17th-century intonation which qualify as<br>definitive, and he's written a book which stands alone<br>as a reference on the tuning of lutes & other antique<br>fretted instruments.<br>Alas, this book is a disappointment in several respects,<br>though it has much to recommend it.<br>The problems with "Mathematical Models of Musical<br>Scales" are many and varied.<br>To summarize:<br>[1] The book starts with a distinctly polemical slant<br>and never lets up.<br>[2] Instead of using the standard measurement of cents,<br>Lindley and Turner-Smith inexplicably choose to use<br>millioctaves (1/1000 of an octave).  Worse, they<br>introduce confusing and bizarre temrinology: "flog," <br>set membership symbols, Boolean logic symbols, etc.<br>Such symbology and terrinology would prove dense<br>but reasonable reading for a mathematics paper--<br>but for a music paper, this kind of mathematical <br>arcana is damned hard to read and extract any <br>musical meaning from.<br>In particular, it's almost impossible to shift gears<br>from sentences like "A mapping which is both 1-1 *and*<br>onto is called a bijection or a 1-1 correspondence. A<br>bijection of a set X *to itself* is called a <br>permutation of X." to sentences like "In 18th century<br>French keyboard tuning, one or two major thirds (Db-F,<br>Ab-C) were larger than pure by a little more than 2% of<br>an octave, although people at the time said these <br>particular 3rd were harsh and in fact meantone<br>temperaments had originally come into use because 15th-<br>century organists considered unacceptable a major 3rd<br>(comprising two 9:8 whole tones) which is larger than<br>pure by a little *less* than 2% of an octave."<br>[3] Throughout the book, Lindley and Turner-Smith<br>consistently disparage and belittle non-12 <br>divisions of the octave.  Typical is the following:<br>"However in the 1550s a talented French composer,<br>Costeley, wrote a song for the 19 divisions, and in <br>1577 a Spanish theorist, Salinas, showed how to <br>tune it on a keyboard instrument by using the pure<br>major 6ths and minor 3rd of 1/3-comma meantone<br>temperament.  Experimentation went on in the 17th<br>century and since, but posterity has judged the<br>system unsatisfactory."  This will come as a<br>surprise to many of the members of this tuning<br>forum, who are at present engaged in composing <br>and performing music in the 19-tone equal<br>temperament.  In fact 19-TET is the most common,<br>almost the closest in sound to 12-TET of the "teen"<br>temperaments (22-TET is closer), and perhaps the <br>easiest to use of the < 20 TET equal temperaments. <br>[4] Despite the title, the overwhelming thrust<br>of this book is a consideration of general mathematical<br>models of the musical scales used from the 15th through<br>the 18th centuries.  Lindley and Turner-Smith do not,<br>despite the implication of their title, consider<br>the musical ramifications of systems such as <br>Harry Partch's extended just intonation, Enrique<br>Moreno's non-octave scales, Mandelbaum's multiple<br>divisions of the octave, or my own non-just non-<br>equal-tempered tunings.<br>To dilate on these points:<br>[1] The polemical slant.  The reader gets hit between<br>the eyes with the first sentence of the introduction:<br>"We reject the ancient Pythagorean idea that music<br>somehow 'is' number, and we show how to design<br>mathematical models for musical scales and<br>systems according to some more modern principles."<br>[Lindley, Mark, and Ronald Turner-Smith, "Mathematical<br>Models of Musical Scales," Orpheus, Bonn 1993,<br>Page 7]<br>This passage contains two statements which are<br>open to serious debate.  First, the authors reject<br>categorically the Pythagorean idea of "numerus<br>sonorus" in favor of an emprical Aristoxenian <br>definition of intervals and of music. <br>But the debate twixt Pythagorean and Aristoxenian<br>views on the nature of music has raged since the<br>beginning of Western music and no one has *ever*<br>succeeded in resolving the question.<br>Despite Lindley/Turner-Smith's efforts to paint<br>the Pythagorean viewpoint as "mystical" and<br>"unscientific," the fact remains that the Pythagorean<br>view is the basis of Western theoretical science.<br>In fact the Pytahgorean view ought to be called<br>the "theoretical science" view, since it encapsulates<br>and perfectly expresses all the ideals held by<br>scientific pure theorists: in the view of the pure<br>theorist, an infallible test of whether a mathematical<br>theory accurately models the real world is the<br>degree of mathematical beauty and "elegance" which<br>the theory exhibits.  Pure theorists typically reject<br>a scientific model of reality whose mathematics are<br>ugly and messy yet whose predictions are in good<br>accord with experiment, in favor of a scientific model<br>of reality whose mathematics are elegant and gorgeous<br>yet whose predicitions have not been tested yet, or<br>don't fall quite as close to experimental numbers.<br>There is good precedent for this.  The final elaboration<br>of the Potelamic epicycle model of the universe in<br>the 16th century produced excellent agreement with<br>astronomical observations of the movements of the<br>planets.  But scientists rejected the model of <br>Ptolemaic epicycles in favor of the Copernican <br>model largely on the basis of the mathematical<br>ugliness and complexity of the Ptolemaic system,<br>versus the simplicity and elegance of the <br>Copernican.<br>In modern times the best expression of the pure<br>theoretical (AKA Pythagorean) viewpoint is<br>given by Einstein: he was once asked what he would<br>have done if a phsyical experiment had contradicted<br>his theory of special relativity, and he answered<br>by saying that he would have felt sorry for the<br>dear Lord.<br>"Time and again the passion for understanding has<br>led to the illusion that man is able to comprehend<br>the objective world rationally, by pure thought,<br>without any empirical foundations--in short, by<br>metaphysics. I believe that every true theorist is a <br>kind of tamed metaphysicist, no matter how pure<br>a 'positivist' he may fancy himself.  The metaphysicist<br>believes that the logically simple is also the real.<br>The tamed metaphysicist believes that not all that<br>is logically simple is embodied in experienced<br>relatiy, but tha the totality of all sensory experience<br>can be 'comprehended' on the basis of a conceptual<br>system built on premises of great simplicity.<br>The skeptic will say that this is a 'miracle creed.'<br>Admittedly so, but it is a miracle creed which has<br>been borne out to an amazing extent by the<br>development of science." [Einstein, Albert,<br>"Ideas and Opinions, Pg. 333: originally from<br>"Scientific American," Vol. 182, No. 4, April, 1950]<br>This strain of Western thought is so fundamental<br>to rational inquiry that it is untenable to dismiss<br>the Pythagorean viewpoint as cavalierly as Lindley<br>and Turner-Smith have, just as it untenable to<br>cavalierly define *all* of music in terms of<br>the Pythagorean viewpoint that intervals<br>are numbers, thus numbers are simple ratios and<br>thus the simplest ratios are the most audibly<br>consonant, quod erat demonstrandum (yet dead<br>wrong).<br>As I've pointed out in prior posts, the strict<br>extreme hard-line Pythagorean viewpoint<br>fails when it encounters reality, since<br>the 3:5:7 triad demonstrably sounds less<br>consonant than the 4:5:6 triad--yet the<br>integers of the 3:5:7 triad are obviously<br>smaller.  A cadence which ends with a 4/3<br>in the bass is universally proscribed in all<br>Western harmony texts as a dissonance<br>to be avoided in favor of a 4:5:6 triad in<br>root position as the preferred final chord--<br>yet the 4/3 is clearly a smaller interval<br>than the 3/2.  And so on.<br>The Pythagorean hard-line view on musical<br>consonance and auditory perception also<br>fails the test of experiment, since 130<br>years of psychoacoustic tests have shown<br>no evidence of small-integer-ratio detectors<br>in the human auditory system, and  systematic<br>evidence that intervals not described in<br>terms of small whole number ratios are<br>heard as "pure" and "perfect consonances,"<br>while the purportedly "true" and "natural"<br>small-integer ratio intervals are universally<br>heard as "impure," "too narrow," "out of tune,"<br>and "flat."<br>The debate twixt Pythagorean (pure theorist)<br>and Aristoxenian (applied experimental science)<br>viewpoints is ongoing.  It represents a fundamental<br>dichotomy at the heart of Western culture.  It <br>cannot be resolved.<br>For Lindley and Turner-Smith to dismiss this<br>fundamental dichotomy at the heart of Western<br>culture with a wave of their hands is astonishing.<br>One would have thought a scholar of Lindley's <br>range and depth would recognize that <br>this ongoing debate twixt two schools of thought<br>is essential to the health of Western music.<br>Over the centuries the debate has shifted from<br>one side to the other, then back again, as new<br>evidence and new mathematics come to the fore.<br>At present the pendulum is swinging toward the<br>Aristoxenian extreme with the discovery that<br>even the most linear physical laws exhibit<br>unpredictably chaotic behavior.  However, recently<br>Ed Witten and others succeeded in demonstrating<br>that all of the five competing models of superstring<br>theory are subsumed under one overarching model.<br>If Witten and company can find a way to generate<br>actual numbers from superstring theory, the<br>pendulum may swing back to the Pyhagorean <br>extremum.<br>And so it goes in music.  With the collapse of<br>Helmholtz's theory and the findings of Ward,<br>Corso, Pikler, Sundberg and many others, grave<br>doubts have been cast on the advisability of<br>viewing music in terms of small whole numbers<br>as an adequate explanation of how we hear and<br>how we compose.  However, future experimental<br>evidence or future mathematical results might<br>shift the burden of proof back onto the Fetis-Ward-<br>Burns-Corso contingent who view harmony as<br>mostly a matter of brainwashing and "consonance"<br>and "dissonance" are largely learned habits.<br>The point is that the musical and cultural debate<br>is ongoing and never-ending, and it *cannot* be<br>prestidigitated away as Lindley and Turner-Smith<br>have sought to do.<br>The second problem with Lindley's and Turner-<br>Smith's argument is the implication that "modern"<br>methods of analyzing and generating musical scales<br>somehow equals "better." There is no evidence<br>for this.  Newer musical methods are not necessarily <br>"better" than older music.  Moreover,<br>the entire notion of the musical utility of *this* or<br>*that* mathematical method is cyclic.  Just intonation<br>and equal temperament periodically come into<br>and go out of fashion.  This has happened throughout<br>the history of Western music, and will doubtless<br>happen again. <br>[2] John Chalmers has already expressed doubts<br>about the wisdom of using non-standard units of<br>musical measurement such as the millioctave.<br>For my part, let me point out that it is as confusing<br>as encountering speed limit signs which give<br>numbers of furlongs per fortnight when<br>your speedometer is calibrated in miles per hour.<br>It is simply incomprehensible to me why Lindley<br>and Turner-Smith would choose to use a non-<br>standard unit of musical interval measurement.<br>[3] Lindley's and Turner-Smith's negative attitude <br>toward musical intonations with more than 12<br>pitch classes must be understood in context.<br>They are probably simply saying that there is<br>little historical precedent for such usage; but<br>this is mainly a question of technology, rather<br>than aesthetics or musicality.  In the era of<br>wooden machines (viz., the piano, the harpsichord)<br>it would have been impossibly difficult &<br>expensive to build a 5-octave instrument with<br>31 equal tones to the octave.  If such an instrument<br>could have been built, its keys would have been<br>too narrow to be fingered; and the instrument<br>itself would have been too mechanically complex<br>and too fragile to survive an actual performance.<br>Today, however, with digital tehcnology, other<br>intonations than 12 equal tones to the octave<br>can easily be had.  <br>Since Lindley and Turner-Smith's book is largely<br>an historical study (despite the title), its<br>dismissive attitude toward > 12 pitch classes<br>constitutes a judgment of practicality rather<br>than intrinsic worth, and so ought not to be taken <br>as the final word musical composition in <br>non-12 tunings--especially for *modern* <br>composers with access to retunable<br>digital instruments.<br>[4] The title of the book is probably overly<br>ambitious.  It would be better if the book had<br>been called "Mathematical Models of Musical<br>Scales from the Common Practice Period of<br>Western Music."  Within that context, the book <br>works very well.  In particular, the footnotes<br>and musical examples are superb.  Lindley<br>reveals the true range of his scholarship in<br>the footnotes and appendices--which make<br>more interesting reading than the rest of <br>the text.<br>All in all, this is a book recommended for those<br>interested in historical intonation with a<br>heavily partisan bias (toward emprical<br>science, away from pure theory). <br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 9 Jul 1996 22:30 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id NAA14751; Tue, 9 Jul 1996 13:30:35 -0700<br>Date: Tue, 9 Jul 1996 13:30:35 -0700<br>Message-Id: <960709202707_101655.321_IHN235-1@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3191 href="#3191">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/1996 2:07:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: Equal-beating chromatic scale<br>--<br>In vol. 29, No. 4 of the Journal of the<br>Acoustical Society of America, April<br>1957, A.
