Pythagorean systems based on pure fifths<br>or fourths, with various modifications, occur in many world musics<br>from China and India to Persia. Scholars such as Ervin Wilson have<br>begun to draw some connections which may lead to a richer<br>understanding of cross-cultural xenharmonics.<br><br>(3) Just intonation (JI). Pythagorean tuning is not only a system of<br>just intonation with a very long history, but also an amazingly<br>successful system not only ideally suited to much Gothic music but<br>inviting "Neo-Gothic extensions" approximating intervals in 5-based<br>and 7-based systems.<br><br>(4) N-tet and related systems. Like equal temperaments such as 17-tet,<br>Pythagorean tuning tends to have a non-tertian focus quite distinct<br>from "classical" European music of the post-Gothic era. Also, like<br>these systems, it has sometimes been dismissed as "purely<br>mathematical, not musical," or denounced as "intolerably dissonant."<br>Fortunately, the growing recognition promoted by xenharmonicists such<br>as Ivor Darreg that _all_ n-tet's have a potential for beautiful music<br>may lead to a more just appreciation of Pythagorean tuning also.<br><br>Now for the musical linkage of Pythagorean tuning, a 3-based JI<br>system, and both 5-based and 7-based systems.<br><br>This linkage involves two bridges, the first well known and the second<br>perhaps a bit more obscure -- but obvious once John Chalmers called it<br>to my attention.<br><br>These bridges are the regular schisma, and what I term the _septimal<br>schisma_, which permit extended Pythagorean tunings to emulate<br>intervals of 5-based and 7-based JI systems. While the use of these<br>intervals is, of course, at the discretion of the composer or<br>performer, one application is to supplement the basic 3-based<br>Pythagorean intervals with two new "flavors" of unstable intervals<br>which can serve as diversions or impel directed cadential action<br>toward stable octaves, fifths, and fourths.<br><br>The regular schisma of 32805:32768 or about 1.95 cents, as many<br>readers will be aware, is a bridge to a quasi-5-based world. It is the<br>difference between the Pythagorean comma (531441:524288, about 23.46<br>cents) and the syntonic comma (81:80, about 21.51 cents) which<br>separates a number of basic 3-based intervals from their 5-based<br>counterparts. <br><br>Possibly less well known, the septimal schisma of 33554432:33480783 or<br>about 3.80 cents is a bridge to a quasi-7-based world of<br>"superefficient" cadences and third-tone steps.
