That is because a<br>stack of four fifths lands you a major third above where you started:  C G<br>D A E.  If those fifths were exactly just, then you'd arrive at an 81:64<br>ratio, which is a syntonic comma (81:80) sharp of the idea 5:4.  So the<br>quarter-comma meantone solution to that problem is to compromise the P5<br>down by 1/4 of a comma so that when you stack up 4 of them you end up 4/4<br>of a comma flat of 81:64, which is of course 5:4.  <br><br>   Similarly, third-comma meantone is devised to temper the 27:16 major<br>sixth down to the cleaner-sounding 5:3.  <br><br>   As you've probably heard by now, 31TET is virtually identical with<br>quarter-comma meantone, and 19TET, for all realistic purposes, *IS*<br>third-comma meantone.  If you stack up 31 quarter-comma flat fifths you<br>land only 6 cents off from where you started, and if you stack up 19<br>third-comma flat fifths you land only about 1 cent off.  <br><br>   So what about fifth-comma meantone?  As with sixth-comma meantone, that<br>is probably best characterized as well temperament.  That particular size<br>of fifth was probably chosen more to generally equalize tuning errors<br>within a 12-toned framework, rather than to make any particular interval<br>sound accurate.  That in the sense that whether a 243:128 major seventh is<br>really all that much more harmonically unpleasant than 15:8 major seventh<br>(a comma flatter) or than any major seventh for that matter, is pretty<br>marginal.  <br><br>   Or relative to the tonic anyway; 15:8 is of course is mediant of the<br>dominant, so perhaps one could argue it that way.  Perhaps one could argue<br>that fifth comma meantone was devised to make the third of V-chord just in<br>the same sense that third-comma meantone makes the IV-chord just.  That<br>combined with the fact that the total error between the third of I (the<br>mediant) and the third of V (the leading tone) is smaller that way.  In the<br>quarter-comma meantone case, the mediant's error is 0 and the leading<br>tone's is 1/4 comma, whereas in fifth-comma meantone a total error of 1/4<br>comma, the mediant's is 1/5 comma, and the leading tone's is 0, a total of<br>1/5 comma.  <br><br>   But I think that when you add to that formulation the error in the third<br>of the IV-chord (the submediant), and also consider the effects upon minor<br>keys, I suspect that the well-temperament explanation may be more<br>realistic.  Well anyway, fifth- and sixth-comma meantone definitely<br>straddle the boundary between well temperaments and classic meantones.  By<br>the pure definition, they're certainly meantone tunings, but their<br>motivation seems to match more closely that of well temperaments.  <br><br>   Oh, by the way, I think that Switched-On Bach 2000 has some fifth-comma<br>meantone on it.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 2 Feb 1997 18:31 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22655; Sun, 2 Feb 1997 18:31:02 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22633<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id JAA05971; Sun, 2 Feb 1997 09:27:58 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 2 Feb 1997 09:27:58 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199702021224_MC2-10AB-B182@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Meantone Explanation</h1><h3><a id=4711 href="#4711">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/1997 4:29:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Somebody asked me about the exact meaning of fifth-comma meantone. <br>Those of you who are new to unusual tunings might find this useful<br>information.  <br><br><br>              -----------------------------------------------<br><br><br>   The usual definition of an nth-comma meantone would be something like "a<br>tuning based upon a circle of identical-sized fifths tuned flat of the 3:2<br>by 1/n commas, wrapping within an octave".  <br><br>   Assuming that you use the syntonic comma in that definition, as opposed<br>to the pythagorean comma, then quarter-comma meantone is devised to create<br>a just 5:4 at the sacrifice of the accuracy of the 3:2.
