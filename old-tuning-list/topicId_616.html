This is strongly linked to timbre, though, and<br>breaks down before you get to 81/64.<br><br>The good intervals in equal temperaments don't usually<br>constitute anything like an odd limit.  It's generally more<br>efficient to say how well different primes are approximated.<br>For exactness, state the signed errors, and you can work<br>other intervals out from that.<br><br>Incidentally, it seems to me that the concept of level-n<br>consistency is closely related to the recently defined<br>radius of the scale.  If you want to use all the notes in<br>a radius 2 scale, it helps if it's level-2 consistent as well.<br><br><br>OCTAVE INVARIANCE<br>-----------------<br><br>There are (at least) three different concepts involved here,<br>which need to be distinguished for the discussion to progress:<br><br>1) The idea that harmony is unchanged if notes are transposed<br>  independently in octaves.<br><br>2) The practice of giving notes related by octaves the same name.<br><br>3) The practice of defining scales within an octave, and<br>  repeating them in other octaves.<br><br>In all cases the choice of the octave as an invariant interval<br>is not an arbitrary one.

I won't do so in detail today, as it is<br>outside the brief of this list (we all now how to tune octaves!)<br><br>If the ear/brain complex has a hard-wired mechanism for<br>octave reduction, this would relate to the 10:12:15 vs<br>16:19:24 tuning of a minor triad.<br><br>Personally, I see no way in which intervals an octave apart<br>can be considered "the same" and my brother agrees with me.<br>I'm sure people can convince themselves otherwise, the same<br>way they learn to hear the "3-ness" in a sharp major third.<br><br><br>TEMPERAMENT<br>-----------<br><br>Joe Monzo again:<br><br>> I think a large part of the reason Schoenberg stuck with the<br>> 12-Eq scale was because he realized intuitively that within the<br>> vastly expanded resources of his implied 13-Limit, were he to<br>> work in just-intonation, the number-play involved could quickly<br>> become a bottomless pit from which his musical inspiration would<br>> never again emerge into the light of day.  Then again, I also<br>> think he wanted to make use of the ambiguities made possible<br>> by a comparison of so many close ratios on the one hand and<br>> their nearby 12-Eq equivalents on the other.<br><br>Then again, perhaps Schoenberg had a piano.<br><br>> I refuse to accept an equal-temperament because it makes<br>> modulation "easy" or (excuse me while I laugh) "possible".<br><br>Where were you when Gregg Gibson was stomping all over the<br>list?  Temperaments do make modulation easier, and this is<br>important.  If this is a personal decision, though, it's fair<br>enough.<br><br>> The only reasons I can see for accepting any equal-temperament<br>> is that it is easier to play on most instruments, and, as I stated<br>> in another post to this issue, the study of the interplay between<br>> JI and ET in the same piece is becoming more and more interesting<br>> to me.<br><br>That sounds too dogmatic to me, perhaps it wasn't intended<br>to be.  Other reasons are:<br><br>1) You like the sound of it.<br><br>  The only reason you need.<br><br>2) It simplifies notation.<br><br>  If a piece of music makes sense in JI, good musicians will<br>  work this out from staff notation, if you point out the<br>  difference between G# and Ab.  (If there are a lot of<br>  Pythagorean intervals, Erv Wilson's positive notation is more<br>  useful.)  Bad musicians won't be helped by precise tuning<br>  indications.  If the music doesn't make sense, who cares<br>  how it's played?<br><br>3) It allows ambiguous chords.<br><br>  I remember you (Monzo, TD1403) agreeing that the chord<br>  below only works in meantone.  Did you really mean to imply<br>  (above) that this isn't a use for temperament?<br><br>                 A---E---B<br>                      \ / \<br>                       G---D---A<br><br>4) You can't be bothered to work out the ratios.<br><br>  As implied in the Schoenberg paragraph, most<br>  composers don't want to worry about ratios.  They want a<br>  resourceful scale to compose in.  Give them a meantone, and<br>  they'll find good harmonies in it.  They might even give<br>  them to musicians who'll render them in JI.  Do you really<br>  expect the composer to sit and work out where the commas<br>  should be?<br><br><br>POPULAR MUSIC<br>-------------<br><br>Drew Skyfyre wrote:<br><br>> In an interview I just saw on TV,in which they discussed briefly,their <br>> middle eastern/oriental explorations,Jimmy Page said of their new <br>> album,Walking into Clarksdale,(I quote from memory)<br>> "The Oriental stuff was done by a guy called Tim from Transglobal <br>> Underground (a British dance music outfit) who plays an Oriental keyboard <br>> that plays microtones."<br><br>Cool!

Fortunately, 7-limit systems _can_ be represented<br>> in three dimensions.<br><br>We can, of course, work with as many dimensions as we like<br>by using coordinate geometry.  It is easer to "understand"<br>scales when you can visualise them, though.  You can specify<br>ambiguous chords as a superposition of different matrices.<br>I think this has application in a dynamic tuning program.<br><br>> Graham leaves his 7-factor-ratios unconnected by<br>> any lines to the 3- and 5-limit ratios.  If I replace<br>> the ratios with the prime-factor notation that I use,<br>> and connect the 7-ratios in a manner similar to others,<br><br>Usually, I connect all 5-limit planes in this fashion.  I<br>don't usually do that with three planes in a diagram, because<br>it gets too cluttered with lines.  If I were to, it would<br>look something like this:<br><br><br>                  B-----------F#<br>                 / \         / \<br>                /   \   Ab  /   \<br>               /     \ / \ /     \<br>              /   E#----------B#  \<br>             /     \ / \ / \ /     \<br>            G-------\---D---/-------A<br>             \     / \ / \ / \     /<br>              \   Fb--\---/---Cb  /<br>               \     / \ / \     /<br>                \   /   G#  \   /<br>                 \ /         \ /<br>                  Bb----------F<br><br>>From the way the lines cross, you can see which plane is<br>supposed to be the highest, and so reconstruct it in three<br>dimensions in your mind.  Ideally, each plane would be a<br>different colour.  The structure is a regular dodecahedron,<br>or something like that.<br><br>I find it easier to understand the scales with conventional<br>names.  There's no need for prime factorisation, because it's<br>implied by the lattice.<br><br><br>PRIME VS ODD LIMIT<br>------------------<br><br>The most paradoxical chord from an odd limit perspective I<br>find is 4:6:9.  I think of it as extended 3-limit, because<br>it's the fifths that give it it's character.  It is also<br>highly octave specific.  It sounds more consonant<br>(concordant) than a major triad in root position, but<br>transpose it to 8:9:12 and it's clearly more dissonant.<br><br>There may be ways the ear relates to prime factors.  Different<br>overtones will be reinforced, and the difference tone pattern<br>may change.  This is strongly linked to timbre, though, and<br>breaks down before you get to 81/64.<br><br>The good intervals in equal temperaments don't usually<br>constitute anything like an odd limit.  It's generally more<br>efficient to say how well different primes are approximated.<br>For exactness, state the signed errors, and you can work<br>other intervals out from that.<br><br>Incidentally, it seems to me that the concept of level-n<br>consistency is closely related to the recently defined<br>radius of the scale.  If you want to use all the notes in<br>a radius 2 scale, it helps if it's level-2 consistent as well.<br><br><br>OCTAVE INVARIANCE<br>-----------------<br><br>There are (at least) three different concepts involved here,<br>which need to be distinguished for the discussion to progress:<br><br>1) The idea that harmony is unchanged if notes are transposed<br>  independently in octaves.<br><br>2) The practice of giving notes related by octaves the same name.<br><br>3) The practice of defining scales within an octave, and<br>  repeating them in other octaves.<br><br>In all cases the choice of the octave as an invariant interval<br>is not an arbitrary one.  (1) I would argue with, if taken as a<br>fundamental principle.  I won't do so in detail today, as it is<br>outside the brief of this list (we all now how to tune octaves!)<br><br>If the ear/brain complex has a hard-wired mechanism for<br>octave reduction, this would relate to the 10:12:15 vs<br>16:19:24 tuning of a minor triad.<br><br>Personally, I see no way in which intervals an octave apart<br>can be considered "the same" and my brother agrees with me.<br>I'm sure people can convince themselves otherwise, the same<br>way they learn to hear the "3-ness" in a sharp major third.<br><br><br>TEMPERAMENT<br>-----------<br><br>Joe Monzo again:<br><br>> I think a large part of the reason Schoenberg stuck with the<br>> 12-Eq scale was because he realized intuitively that within the<br>> vastly expanded resources of his implied 13-Limit, were he to<br>> work in just-intonation, the number-play involved could quickly<br>> become a bottomless pit from which his musical inspiration would<br>> never again emerge into the light of day.  Then again, I also<br>> think he wanted to make use of the ambiguities made possible<br>> by a comparison of so many close ratios on the one hand and<br>> their nearby 12-Eq equivalents on the other.<br><br>Then again, perhaps Schoenberg had a piano.<br><br>> I refuse to accept an equal-temperament because it makes<br>> modulation "easy" or (excuse me while I laugh) "possible".<br><br>Where were you when Gregg Gibson was stomping all over the<br>list?  Temperaments do make modulation easier, and this is<br>important.  If this is a personal decision, though, it's fair<br>enough.<br><br>> The only reasons I can see for accepting any equal-temperament<br>> is that it is easier to play on most instruments, and, as I stated<br>> in another post to this issue, the study of the interplay between<br>> JI and ET in the same piece is becoming more and more interesting<br>> to me.<br><br>That sounds too dogmatic to me, perhaps it wasn't intended<br>to be.  Other reasons are:<br><br>1) You like the sound of it.<br><br>  The only reason you need.<br><br>2) It simplifies notation.<br><br>  If a piece of music makes sense in JI, good musicians will<br>  work this out from staff notation, if you point out the<br>  difference between G# and Ab.  (If there are a lot of<br>  Pythagorean intervals, Erv Wilson's positive notation is more<br>  useful.)  Bad musicians won't be helped by precise tuning<br>  indications.  If the music doesn't make sense, who cares<br>  how it's played?<br><br>3) It allows ambiguous chords.<br><br>  I remember you (Monzo, TD1403) agreeing that the chord<br>  below only works in meantone.  Did you really mean to imply<br>  (above) that this isn't a use for temperament?<br><br>                 A---E---B<br>                      \ / \<br>                       G---D---A<br><br>4) You can't be bothered to work out the ratios.<br><br>  As implied in the Schoenberg paragraph, most<br>  composers don't want to worry about ratios.  They want a<br>  resourceful scale to compose in.  Give them a meantone, and<br>  they'll find good harmonies in it.  They might even give<br>  them to musicians who'll render them in JI.  Do you really<br>  expect the composer to sit and work out where the commas<br>  should be?<br><br><br>POPULAR MUSIC<br>-------------<br><br>Drew Skyfyre wrote:<br><br>> In an interview I just saw on TV,in which they discussed briefly,their <br>> middle eastern/oriental explorations,Jimmy Page said of their new <br>> album,Walking into Clarksdale,(I quote from memory)<br>> "The Oriental stuff was done by a guy called Tim from Transglobal <br>> Underground (a British dance music outfit) who plays an Oriental keyboard <br>> that plays microtones."<br><br>Cool!
