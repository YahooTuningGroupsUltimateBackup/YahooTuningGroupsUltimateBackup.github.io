During the interview he happens to<br>compare the general quality of the Crimson discussion list with that of our<br>own tuning list.  I'm sure the Crimson/Fripp fans on the list will find<br>this especially interesting.  (I also noticed Mr. Gunn includes a link to<br>the JI Network on his web page.)<br><br>The complete interview can be found at:<br><br>http://www.innerviews.org/inner/gunn2.html<br><br>--------<br>(excerpt)<br>..As far as mailing lists like Elephant Talk, the thing about them is<br>theres no standard of operating. Theres no qualifcation for entry. Anyone<br>can say anything, and they can use a fake name to do ittheres no<br>accountability. ... Theres always the hope for us that the standard could<br>be raised [on Elephant Talk] so that some real dialogue can take place. On<br>the other hand, I subscribed to a mailing list for people who do microtonal<br>tunings, and the level of discussion there was infinitely more accountable<br>and interesting than anything Ive read on Elephant Talk.<br>-------<br><br>Is Trey Gunn still on the list?  I would be extremely curious to know if he<br>has done any microtonal guitar work!  Likewise for anyone else in the<br>Crimson/Fripp/Guitar Craft circle...<br><br><br>Kris Peck<br>(still the very proud father of Lydia Jazz Peck, born 6/15/98)</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Trey Gunn gives tuning list a thumbs up</h1><h3><a id=8360 href="#8360">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Kris Peck&#x22; &#x3C;kpeck@wavetech.net&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/1998 4:27:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Hey list,<br>I noticed a mention of the tuning list the other day in an interview with<br>touch guitarist Trey Gunn (Chapman Stick, Warr Guitar), probably best known<br>for being a member of King Crimson.
