To satisfy my own curiousity, I decided to try it<br>in several tunings back to back, and see how they compared.<br>[Actually, I had done I-IV-ii-V-i the first time.

I found<br>12 to be somewhat blunt and somewhat jarring in impact, yet sharp or<br>edgy in quality; metal chains came to mind.  19 on the other hand,<br>sounded sweet and lush, and suggested rain forest or some other dense<br>vegetation.  This makes me wonder whether 19 is "better" for diatonic<br>music that 12?  [I know there's plenty of more complex music that<br>could be done in both, but I'm not there yet, as I'm still slowly<br>working my way toward musicianship.]<br><br><br>Next up was 22.  I used the tones necessary to construct a proper<br>minor triad, and, as I was about to discover in a big way, this<br>resulted in comma shifts in both outer voices, which is what Paul was<br>hoping to illustrate to me.  The result, as I described it to him last<br>week, was "as close as a sound has ever come to conveying nausea to<br>me".  The first time I heard it, the sensation was almost physical,<br>and this was true on a couple of repeated listening as well, if I were<br>relaxed and letting myself get lost in the sound.  If I were being<br>more the engineer about it, is simply sounded disturbing and out of<br>tune.<br><br><br>Lastly was the solution I had worked out in solving the puzzle Paul<br>had given me.  By taking the ii as a diminished triad, everything fell<br>nicely into place.  The overall effect was pretty close to what I felt<br>in the 12 or 19 versions, but there was more contrast, and an added<br>tension I hadn't heard before.  Rather that wet, lush forest, this was<br>a semi-alien landscape, not sparse by any means, but more intense, and<br>with a broader spectrum of colors.  I described it to Paul as being<br>like a cactus garden, but there's more to it than that.  I guess this<br>is what it feels like to discover a "new" world, as opposed to a<br>different rendition of familiar things?<br><br><br>Since then, I followed up and tried the progression in 5-limit JI as<br>well. It was not nearly so bad as the comma-ridden version in 22, more<br>like a sour grape in a fruit salad, but the comma shift still made the<br>chords sound "wrong" somehow.  I presume it was more tolerable because<br>the commas were only half as large as in the 22TET rendition.  Can<br>anyone offer an explanation for this?<br><br><br>I'm sure this is old hat for most of you, but I got quite a first hand<br>education from it, and I'm hoping it'll result in some discussion<br>nonetheless.
