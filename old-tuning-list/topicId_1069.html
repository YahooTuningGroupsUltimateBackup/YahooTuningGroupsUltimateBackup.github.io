I'm perfectly happy with cents measurement <br>wherever it may be appropriate, and with the size of the unit (although <br>I can still hear beating easily enough at mid-range frequencies with a <br>quarter cent difference). If I was treating one of Ben Johnston's scores <br>as data for a MIDI rendering, and cents values were required by the <br>program used, then I wouldn't have the least worry about such a <br>translation -- computers won't attach any theoretical significance to <br>the way the data is presented. For computers, we are concerned with <br>input and output only; but composers have every right to concern <br>themselves with more than this in scores for human performers. While you <br>may not think so for Ben's notation, how would you react to a <br>publisher's proposal to dispense with flats, double flats and sharps in <br>a new edition of, say, Beethoven's piano sonatas, leaving single sharps <br>only to produce the same result, on the grounds that all these <br>superfluous accidentals were merely "a personalized mythology of <br>meanings of relationships" (to quote you)? After all, a G#-C-D# chord <br>will sound no different on the piano than an Ab-C-Eb chord, so why not <br>end this proliferation of accidentals?<br><br>> Ben Johnson once wrote a piece for me for bassoon and tuba. We spent <br>> so much time deciphering the notation into cents that valuable <br>> rehearsal time was lost.  The piece was performed beautifully in tune, <br>> but perhaps at a third too slow, or more.<br><br>Don't misunderstand me -- I have great admiration for careful performers <br>of Ben's music, and I wouldn't be surprised if your performance was <br>more accurate than many others which didn't involve cents translations <br>during rehearsal. This still misses the theoretical point I was making: <br>Ben wishes to notate the relationships to show the intervallic structure <br>of the piece -- call it Platonizing if you like. He has said in public <br>(perhaps someone can remind me where) that of course the expected <br>accuracy of intonation will vary from one passage to another: for <br>instance, the fast semiquaver runs in the 9th Quartet, with inflections <br>up to the 31-limit, will never be played at tempo with painstaking <br>accuracy, nor does it matter, since the notes pass by too quickly for <br>any listener to notice. But since Ben chooses to notate the pitch <br>relationships precisely, the acceptable margin of vagueness is a matter <br>for performers to determine sensitively.<br><br>I'd be fascinated to know whether Ben participated in your rehearsals, <br>and if so whether he commented on the cents translation. If he was <br>there, I wouldn't expect him to have objected -- why endanger a premiere <br>(and a good one at that, no doubt)? Composers have to be pragmatists at <br>some point, while theorists (like me) have the luxury of following <br>through all logical consequences faithfully. In this case, Ben (like <br>many extended JI composer) is making a statement in his notation that <br>pitch need not merely be regarded as a continuum, from which pitches are <br>selected on an arbitrary, subjective basis (again this is the old <br>Ptolemy vs. Aristoxenus battle).<br><br>I understand your desire that a lingua franca be settled upon for <br>microtonal notation, but I offer these theoretical reflections in order <br>to point out that this is only one possible priority -- those <br>participating on the tuning list (or in the AFMM) don't necessarily form <br>one big happy family, but perhaps, rather, opposing parties who have <br>found a modus vivendi in order to pool resources. Even the word <br>"microtonal" is not necessarily a label happily accepted by all working <br>within JI.<br> <br> 00:49:34 -0500<br>Adam B.

Dan's system (an I <br>> understand it) uses sharps and flats (double sharps, etc.) for an <br>> ever-extensible Pythagorean chain, and applies + and - only for the .<br>> intervals on the 5-plane Therefore, the 5-relationship of any major <br>> chord built on an uninflected pitch will be followed by a -.  I <br>> haven't used Dan's notation because it wasn't very practical to study <br>> with Ben and confuse him with a very similar yet different notation.  <br><br>The 3-limit default is surely the much more obvious system -- it is far <br>more readily understood by musicians unfamiliar with JI, who will find <br>the  complications of 5-limit default notation forbidding or even <br>senseless at first. I very much doubt that Ben would have adopted a <br>5-limit notation without having considered the 3-limit alternative, so <br>I'm uneasy about Adam's treatment of the latter as if it were something <br>new that would have "confused" Ben. Barbour, for instance, settled on a <br>3-limit default without hesitation in *Tuning and Temperament*. I use a <br>5-limit default for music that I consider to be 5-limit (say, Josquin); <br>if I were dealing with much earlier music, I would readily switch to a <br>3-limit default. Whether Ben should have retained his 5-limit notation <br>after he had moved beyond the 5-limit in his own compositions is another <br>question, which I think only Ben himself could answer. The alternative <br>would have been to fall back to a 3-limit notation (congenial enough for <br>a string quartet composer) from the 4th quartet onwards. Ben would no <br>doubt object that our intuitive grasp of the major and minor scales <br>falls within the 5-limit, and not the 3-limit; if this is so, then it is <br>most natural to ask performers to inflect from this 5-limit default. <br>(This is also intended as a reply to Daniel Wolf's points.)<br><br>>Similarly, in my string quartet, I use A+=400<br>> (while Ben always uses A=440)<br><br>I'm glad to hear it; as I said, this, in conjunction with C=1/1, <br>inevitably results in a great many minus signs which could easily be <br>avoided.<br><br>> A tricky situation (one of the thorny<br>> sides of this notation) is that in music that I have analyzed as <br>> 5-limit (such as Lassus, Gesualdo, Palestrina, even Chopin), it can <br>> drop by 7 or 8 commas in a short piece.<br><br>I've dealt with this matter in my article in mto2.6 ("Intonational <br>Injustice") -- you might look at "Diatonic Ficta" by Margaret Bent <br>(*Early Music History* Vol. 4) to see why a gradual descent in pitch was <br>not a problem for a capella polyphony of the 15th/16th centuries (she <br>doesn't deal specifically with syntonic comma shifts though, but I know <br>that she is happy to include them within the scope of her arguments).<br><br>Adam, thanks for your comments on signatures, and on Partch's choice of <br>intervals -- I'd very much like to discuss signatures in greater detail <br>off-list in the near future.<br><br>-- <br>Jonathan Walker<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>mailto:kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk<br>http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~walker/<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 29 Oct 1996 07:17 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA05490; Sun, 27 Oct 1996 01:19:04 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06226<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id QAA06299; Sat, 26 Oct 1996 16:19:01 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 26 Oct 1996 16:19:01 -0700<br>Message-Id: <2.2.32.19961026231649.00687914@adnc.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>TUNING digest 878</h1><h3><a id=3862 href="#3862">ðŸ”—</a>kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk (Jonathan Walker)</h3><span>10/28/1996 9:30:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Johnny Reinhard (Sun, 27 Oct 1996)<br><br>> Please understand this as a salve to understanding.  1200 points on a<br>> line representing an octave is a continuum.
