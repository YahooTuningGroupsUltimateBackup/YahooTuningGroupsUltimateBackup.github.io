Randomness is simply lack of predictability of outcome. We  <br>sometimes perceive as random, totally predictable events (a recording of psuedo-random numbers  <br>mapped to pitch (predictible since it will be the same each time)), so what we are often judging from an  <br>aesthetic view is not randomness but the flux of information in a piece of music - as well as our ability to  <br>observe patterns in this flux. Different people have different thresholds for information, thus music with  <br>very high information density in rhythm, harmonic complexity, tuning structure and so forth will be  <br>interpreted by some people as noise.

Because indeterminacy refers not to randomness, but to lack of  <br>pre-determination of elements of a musical performance. It is clear that almost all music has elements of  <br>indeterminacy. Bach's scores do not specify the rate, depth and pitch bend pattern for vibrato, nor the  <br>deciBel intensity level for each instrument, nor the precise size and dimension of the performance hall, nor  <br>tuning in Hz or cents nor hundreds of other of factors contributing to a successful realization of the score.  <br>What is striking about Cage's indeterminate music is that most aspects of the performance are  <br>indeterminate, particularly aspects which have previously been composer-predetermined such as pitch,  <br>rhythm and instrumentation. Rather than follow the 20th century trend towards hyperspecification  <br>(perhaps most extreme in Ferneyhough's scores), what Cage did is provide contexts and attracted  <br>phenomenal musicians such as David Tudor and Gordon Mumma to help realize his designs.  Cage was  <br>well aware of the difference between performances by artists of this caliber and indifferent hacks and  <br>spoke of "disciplined" performers much as Morton Feldman did with his wisecrack "my boys are  <br>everywhere". While I do not admire Cage taking the lion's share of credit for inherently cooperative  <br>ventures, I enjoy the successful outcomes from his activities. Mclaren describes the music as garbage.  <br>Fine, that's his opinion. To me, Tudor's prepared piano performance of Variations II sounds poetic,  <br>sinuous and terrifying. It does not sound "random", suffused as it is with performer sensitivity, focus and  <br>vision. <br><br><br>Eric Lyon<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 23 Jan 1996 22:21 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id NAA02914; Tue, 23 Jan 1996 13:21:53 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 23 Jan 1996 13:21:53 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9601231648.B22544-0100000@email.ir.miami.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>TUNING digest</h1><h3><a id=2485 href="#2485">ðŸ”—</a>eric@cmlab.sfc.keio.ac.jp (Eric Lyon)</h3><span>1/22/1996 11:50:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I very much enjoyed Brian Mclaren's recent posting on Cage's music.
