After spending years trying<br>to divine as much as possible what Schoenberg had in mind<br>as regards chromaticism, intonation, ratios, 12-eq, and<br>pantonality (his term for what most of us know as<br>his "free atonality" period), I have come to the conclusion<br>that what Schoenberg meant in referring to "problems"<br>is that given the acceptance of the 12-eq scale as a<br>compositional medium, there are _many_ different ratios<br>(both higher-prime "overtone" relationships in vertical <br>sonorities as well as traditional 3- and 5-limit relationships<br>in melodic movement) that can be represented<br>by each 12-eq pitch-class, and the composer's task<br>is to understand what those rational relationships sound<br>like (and also to understand their psychological and<br>emotional effects) and how to represent those sounds<br>(and feelings) by notes available in the 12-eq scale.<br><br>The relevant passage is quoted below:<br><br>> Schoenberg [Theory of Harmony,1911, English trans.,<br>> 1978, p.25, in reference to the 5-limit diatonic major scale]:<br>><br>> This scale is not the last word, the ultimate goal of music,<br>> but rather a provisional stopping place.  The overtone series,<br>> which led the ear to it, still contains many problems that<br>> will have to be faced.  And if for the time being we still<br>> manage to escape those problems, it is due to little else<br>> than a compromise between the natural intervals and our<br>> inability to use them -- that compromise which we call<br>> the tempered system, which amounts to an indefinitely<br>> extended truce.<br><br>Monzo:<br>I will continue the quote from this spot because it is<br>pertinent to the discussion we've been having of Schoenberg<br>[p. 25 and 26]:<br><br>> Schoenberg:<br>> This reduction of the natural relations to manageable<br>> ones cannot permanently impede the evolution of music;<br>> and the ear will have to attack the problems, _because<br>> it is so disposed_.  Then our scale will be transformed into<br>> a higher order, as the church modes were transformed into<br>> major and minor modes.  Whether there will then be quarter<br>> tones, eighth, third, or (as Busoni thinks) sixth tones, or<br>> whether we will move directly to a 53-tone scale that Dr.<br>> Robert Neumann has calculated, we cannot foretell.<br>> Perhaps this new division of the octave will even be<br>> untempered and will not have much left over in common<br>> with our scale.  However that may be, attempts to compose<br>> in quarter or third tones, as are being undertaken here and<br>> there, seem senseless, as long as there are too few<br>> instruments available that can play them.  Probably,<br>> whenever the ear and imagination have matured enough<br>> for such music, the scale and the instruments will all at<br>> once be available.

The 2nd Quartet is nominally in F# minor but is <br>> usually considered Schoenberg's first 'atonal' work (whatever that <br>> means).  <br>> <br>> I say 'whatever that means' because in many so called 'atonal' works <br>> (obviously not all),  tonality is very much _implied_but_not_stated_ <br>> but also, which is confusing, frequently shifting and ambiguous.  <br>> This is one reason why atonality can generate such tension: <br>> sometimes so much that it immediately and continually collapses.  <br>> Many listeners find this incomprehensible, and/or frustrating.  Other <br>> listeners, who don't feel the implicit tonality of  'atonal' works,  <br>> either don't enjoy them at all, or seem to listen in radically <br>> different way (focussing on texture, colour etc).   <br>> <br>> > As regards the possibilities of 11- or 13-equal, <br>> <br>> Tune your keyboard/soundcard/piano to 11-ET;  doodle around a bit, <br>> and write a melody (or harmonise a melody) using at least all 11 <br>> chromatic notes; distil this material to an 11 note row from <br>> which it may be derived; write out the conventional (44) permutations <br>> of the row; then try to compose a piece with this material using <br>> harmonic timbres...  After that experience, try arguing that <br>> Schoenberg could have been able to write as fluently and rewardingly <br>> as he did, given his millieu, experience, aesthetic projects etc.     <br>> <br>> >  Applying these<br>> > rules in 19-eq would give entirely different results, as it's<br>> > easier to avoid keys without using all 19 notes.  Did Schoenberg<br>> > ever consider this?<br>> <br>> Pass.  Does anyone know if  S had any further correspondence with <br>> Yasser not already mentioned on the list?<br>> <br>> But I'm not entirely clear about your argument.  Having written quite <br>> a bit of (what you would probably call) 'serial' and 'atonal' music <br>> in 19-ET I am very aware of how difficult it is to structure a 19 <br>> note series that works well - I tend to use series of less than 19 <br>> notes.  But whether this supports the _principle_ (?) behind your <br>> point I don't know. <br>> <br>> > "The Berg Violin Concerto is said to be the first fully serial<br>> > concerto, though it has many tonal twists to it.  The soloist<br>> > announces the series, a succession of rising thirds, topped by<br>> > a tritone: G, Bb, F#, A, C, E, G#, B, C#, Eb, F."<br>> <br>> This should read:  G, Bb,***D***, F#, A, C, E, G#, B, C#, Eb, F."<br>> <br>> You can see immediately that this row contradicts at least one <br>> of your definitions of atonal (not that you said it is atonal, but <br>> it is often called atonal music).  It's sort of dodecaphonic tonal <br>> atonal.  But in my experience the violin concerto would not normally <br>> be called a 'serial' work.  You are right that the term  serial is <br>> (of  course) derived from the series, but the term 'serial' is <br>> commonly retained for music in which the serial principle is applied <br>> to other parameters ('total serialism' merely being an extreme <br>> instance of this).  For example, Schoenberg Op 25 might be called the <br>> first dodecaphonic work, rather than the first 'serial' work - which <br>> would normally refer something written in the 40's.  <br>> <br>> However, maybe someone on the list could identify when the terms <br>> 'series' and  'serial' were first applied?     <br>> <br>> > I think Wozzeck................... as a whole is atonal.<br>> <br>> Do you think it does not have stunning tonal passages? Like <br>> Marie's Lullaby?  Do you think the end is 'tonal' or 'atonal'?  What <br>> in your view is the point of making the verbal distinction? <br>> <br>> But maybe we're getting off-topic, and should take this elsewhere?<br>> <br>> Patrick O-L</div>
