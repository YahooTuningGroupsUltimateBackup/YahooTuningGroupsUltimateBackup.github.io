Sharpening a third slightly from pure lets the<br>tuner know two things,  how tempered the interval is, and on which side of<br>pure.  It makes for easier tuning, but there is considerable difficulty in<br>getting them all the same.

This is important, because the<br>greatest keyboard works composed so far seem to have come from the period in<br>which the tuning underwent its most rapid changes.  Can any list of composers<br>compare with those that worked between 1700 and 1850?

ET is certainly not and should not be considered in the same<br>>league as MT which is a compromise. ET was a great discovery-both<br>>aesthetic and scientific-and without it, Western music could not have<br>>achieved its unique glory. <br><br>      Hmmm.  I tune equal temperaments for a living.  I think I know the<br>relationships in a 12TET backwards and forwards on at least a hundred<br>different pianos, ( yes, the aural sizes of the thirds are different on<br>different sizes of instruments, 9' pianos beat faster than spinets).  I<br>consider ET to be a compromise, because there is something lacking.  That<br>something is the pure interval.  <br>      There is something physiologically important about being subjected to<br>pure intervals, and the dissonance of the tempered intervals is useful in<br>providing a context for this appreciation.   With 12TET, there is no textural<br>difference, and the context must come from without. <br>     ET is a great developement, but the unique glory of Western Music was<br>formed before it was firmly in place.  I personally see ET as more of an<br>entropic, dead-end detour, than a realized ideal of musical perfection. <br>     As to the temperaments used by the past?  In 1780, a piano performance<br>would have been followed by a discussion on the tuning, comparing the beauty<br>of certain keys with the resulting damage elsewhere.  We need to hear the<br>music played in more than just the ubiquitous ET of today, and then, just<br>like the theorists of old, we need to debate how the music sounds best. <br><br>Regards, <br>Ed Foote <br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn.  .  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 14 Jul 1997 14:52 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA09034; Mon, 14 Jul 1997 14:52:44 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 14 Jul 1997 14:52:44 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09838<br>Received: (qmail 25485 invoked from network); 14 Jul 1997 12:52:03 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 14 Jul 1997 12:52:03 -0000<br>Message-Id: <970714084913_-1694853526@emout03.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Historical Temperaments</h1><h3><a id=5845 href="#5845">ðŸ”—</a>A440A@aol.com</h3><span>7/14/1997 4:20:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Ed Remler writes:<br><br>>Prior to the publication by Mersenne of the correct frequency ratios<br>>for ET in 1636 it would have been practically impossible to tune in ET.<br>>Subsequent to that time it spread through continental Europe.<snip> the<br>history >of the use of beats to tune in ET is<br>>unknown to me, but exact rules for ET tuning are relatively unimportant.<br><br>      I must respectfully disagree.
