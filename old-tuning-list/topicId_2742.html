The archlute or theorbo were common<br>bass continuo instruments and thus were often paired with a harpsichord.<br><br>But in regards to this question and Neil Haverstick's original question<br>about Bach jamming with Weiss, let's do a brief reality check. Given what<br>we know about tuning practices of the time, which did not include counting<br>beats, as Ed Foote reminds us, there was undoubtedly a significant margin<br>of error for any tuning, let alone some circulating temperament with no<br>pure intervals other than the octave.<br><br>Leaving aside the special case of the organ, these were workaday musicians<br>who probably "touched up" the tuning of their harpsichords pretty much<br>every day. I can tell you from experience that you're not going to spend 45<br>minutes every day getting every interval at the top end of the keyboard<br>exact (if indeed that were possible). The story that Bach could tune his<br>harpsichord in 15 minutes is thus completely believable though still<br>impressive.<br><br>Now, the difference between pure and ET thirds is about 15 cents. If you<br>consider that most thirds in most temperaments of the period are going to<br>be compromised in the direction of ET, they are going to be frequently in<br>the range of 5 to 10 cents away. In a treble register, this is within the<br>margin of error of even good singers, fretless strings, and woodwinds.<br>(Remember that these are not modern woodwinds, either.) The margin of error<br>grows, of course, with the size of the ensemble and speed of the piece. (By<br>the way, the seeming beat-spotlighting character of the long consonances in<br>slow movements is mostly an illusion: performers at that time would<br>improvise filler and ornaments in such occasions.)<br><br>In this context, the practical differences between temperaments like some<br>of Neidhardt's and Marpurg's and ET are angels dancing on the head of pin.<br><br>This is not to say that temperament was not important to Bach or that he<br>couldn't hear the difference, but that it is a matter of degree of<br>acceptability in practical music making. If I had been present when he and<br>Weiss jammed, I'm sure that, in the wonder of the music of the moment, a<br>few acoustical beats here or there would probably be the last thing on my<br>mind.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.

The archlute or theorbo were common<br>bass continuo instruments and thus were often paired with a harpsichord.<br><br>But in regards to this question and Neil Haverstick's original question<br>about Bach jamming with Weiss, let's do a brief reality check. Given what<br>we know about tuning practices of the time, which did not include counting<br>beats, as Ed Foote reminds us, there was undoubtedly a significant margin<br>of error for any tuning, let alone some circulating temperament with no<br>pure intervals other than the octave.<br><br>Leaving aside the special case of the organ, these were workaday musicians<br>who probably "touched up" the tuning of their harpsichords pretty much<br>every day. I can tell you from experience that you're not going to spend 45<br>minutes every day getting every interval at the top end of the keyboard<br>exact (if indeed that were possible). The story that Bach could tune his<br>harpsichord in 15 minutes is thus completely believable though still<br>impressive.<br><br>Now, the difference between pure and ET thirds is about 15 cents. If you<br>consider that most thirds in most temperaments of the period are going to<br>be compromised in the direction of ET, they are going to be frequently in<br>the range of 5 to 10 cents away. In a treble register, this is within the<br>margin of error of even good singers, fretless strings, and woodwinds.<br>(Remember that these are not modern woodwinds, either.) The margin of error<br>grows, of course, with the size of the ensemble and speed of the piece. (By<br>the way, the seeming beat-spotlighting character of the long consonances in<br>slow movements is mostly an illusion: performers at that time would<br>improvise filler and ornaments in such occasions.)<br><br>In this context, the practical differences between temperaments like some<br>of Neidhardt's and Marpurg's and ET are angels dancing on the head of pin.<br><br>This is not to say that temperament was not important to Bach or that he<br>couldn't hear the difference, but that it is a matter of degree of<br>acceptability in practical music making. If I had been present when he and<br>Weiss jammed, I'm sure that, in the wonder of the music of the moment, a<br>few acoustical beats here or there would probably be the last thing on my<br>mind.<br><br>Bill<br><br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>^ Bill Alves                                      email: alves@hmc.edu ^<br>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/ ^<br>^ 301 E.
