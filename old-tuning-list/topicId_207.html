He heard it once, and declared that he would never go<br>back to equal temperament.  <br>       Very interesting responses. The guitar players all love the increased<br>harmony available in the purer keys. ( actually, any key with less than 4<br>accidentals). <br>       There was one demo session where the singer *had* to sing in F#, and<br>there was a lot of eyebrows raised;  yes, it did sound out of tune, but the<br>piano player was not posessed of an 18th century tonal education, so there<br>was no question of him working within the temperament.<br>       I have found it very interesting  the way different people register<br>the difference in sound.  Approx.  30% of the musicians notice the increased<br>purity in the simpler keys, and approx. the same number notice the increased<br>dissonance in the more tempered keys, there are some that don't notice<br>anything until it is pointed out to them, and a very few pianists that<br>instantly recognize the aural palette and can grasp what effect composers<br>were, by manipulation of key character, seeking .<br>      I would really like to hear from anybody else that is currently working<br>on a temperament crusade,  I really think there is more interest in the topic<br>than the current dialogue indicates. <br>regards, <br>Ed Foote<br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn.     <br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 1 Dec 1995 07:33 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id VAA24895; Thu, 30 Nov 1995 21:33:09 -0800<br>Date: Thu, 30 Nov 1995 21:33:09 -0800<br>Message-Id: <951201053027_71670.2576_HHB46-6@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2354 href="#2354">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Leger &#x3C;t90mjl1@cs.niu.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>12/2/1995 11:17:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I'd like to get a copy of your 88CET demo.
