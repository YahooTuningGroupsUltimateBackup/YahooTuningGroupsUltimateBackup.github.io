Nice uniform strings<br>will generate integer overtones. Nonlinear systems - systems with distortion,<br>like overdriven loudspeakers - also seem to generate integer overtones.<br><br>Systems with just one degree of freedom seem to be constrained to move<br>periodically, which forces integer overtones, as has already been pointed<br>out. One degree of freedom means a two dimensional phase space (the space of<br>combinations of position and velocity). In three or more dimensions one can<br>embed arbitrary graphs, but in two dimensions the possibilities are cut back<br>severely. In a similar way it seems like the trajectory of a simple<br>oscillator just doesn't have the topological freedom to fold around in<br>strange ways. I might well be wrong about this. (I should hunt around in the<br>literature but most of that stuff goes way over my head!)<br><br>But the tendency of nonlinearity to create integral overtones seems to go<br>beyond one dimensional systems. In a relatively calm ocean, waves of all<br>different frequencies run over each other freely. But once waves start<br>cresting, then distinct shapes start to appear and move through space<br>together. This sort of phase coherence is again a periodic motion that<br>implies integer overtones.<br><br>It does seem that nature has a certain prejudice in favor of integers!<br><br>Actually our common use of integers to count distinct objects seems related<br>to the kind of phase coherence created by nonlinearity. Nonlinearity makes<br>things clump together and split apart, and that's why there are things to <br>count. (And to do the counting!) Huh, and that's really the root of the<br>distinction between digital and analog circuitry - digital circuits use<br>distortion to make nice distinct pulses.
