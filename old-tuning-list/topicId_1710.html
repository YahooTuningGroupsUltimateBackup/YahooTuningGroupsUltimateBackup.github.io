In the Appendix of her book, Schlesinger talks<br>about the work of Elsie Hamilton, an Australian woman from Adelaide, as the<br>first composer to take up and use Schlesinger's version of the Greek modes<br>in 1916.

She had scores of short pieces in JI by Hamilton and a<br>booklet by Hamilton which summarises Schlesinger's system and describes her<br>own application of it to contemporary music making.<br><br>Last Thursday (Feb 20th) I went over to Gloucestershire with a colleague of<br>mine, fellow composer and alternative tunist James D'Angelo to meet the<br>Woods in their stone built cottage in the Cotswold Hills (real<br>picture-postcard-esque). As well as giving us photocopies of the scores and<br>articles, they also showed us a monochord marked in the Harmoniai<br>(Schlesinger's Greek modes)and Mrs Wood got us to tune her lyre for her to<br>play a short study by Elsie Hamilton in JI. We didn't tune it right and the<br>piece didn't come off too well but next time we go back we'll do it better<br>with the intention of making a recording. They were so pleased to hear that<br>there was interest in Elsie Hamilton's work after all this time.(I mentioned<br>the Internet and interest from people in the US and all over the world).<br><br>>From what I was told, Elsie Hamilton went back to Australia in the fifties<br>and presumably died there. If there are any tuning list members in Australia<br>who would like to help with tracking down scores, information etc could they<br>please get in touch so that we can co-ordinate efforts.
