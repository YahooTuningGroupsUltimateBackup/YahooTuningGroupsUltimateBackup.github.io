But its musical<br>>significance may be slight.<br><br>   I'm inclined to expect something more like the reverse.  Lucy's belief<br>that pi has anything to do with tuning, best I can tell, holds marginal<br>interest at best both scientifically and musically.  Still, in my admittely<br>brief experimentation with LucyTuning, it struck me as an interesting<br>tuning with definite musical possibilities.<br><br>   But I should qualify that by saying that it strikes me as one of a long<br>list of interesting tuning possibilities, and at a quick glance, it seems<br>to me to be somewhere in the lower middle priority-wise of that list.<br><br><br><br><br>>For most of us, the difference between the "cooked" [tempered] and the natural<br>>[just] version is so slight that it becomes lost in the idiosyncracies of<br>>performance.<br><br>   I believe that to be both thoroughly true, and thorougly false in two<br>different ways.  Anybody who has played an indefinite-pitch instrument<br>(e.g., virtually all orchestral instruments) can easily confirm that the<br>pitch-biasing imperfections of these instruments, combined with the time<br>and attention limits of normal-speed music, make it extremely difficult to<br>precisely perform in, for example, 12TET vs. QC meantone, much less the<br>subtle variations of different well temperaments.  There's not doubt in my<br>mind that that's true in all but sustained chords, and I think it's<br>important for mathematical theorists to bear that in mind.<br><br>   But there are very important limits to that argument.  Firstly,<br>sustained chords certainly do occur occasionally in normal-speed music, and<br>they probably get the most attention in the audience's mind, at least when<br>it comes to how the tuning affects them.  Second, there certainly are<br>plenty of definite-pitched, and at least much-more-definite-pitched,<br>instruments out there.  Guitars and pianos are extremely common examples of<br>these, along with electronic instruments.<br><br>   But certainly the most important caveat to this argument, is that it<br>applies only to distinguishing temperaments (or not) of traditional pitch<br>relationships, and entirely ignores nontraditional pitch relationships.<br>The difference between, for example, a 9:7-frequency-ratio supramajor third<br>and a normal major third is very easily audible in normal-speed music.<br>Also, that large a pitch discrepancy from "normal" tuning (nearly a<br>quartertone) is well outside the semirandom deviations due to instruments'<br>pitch indefiniteness.<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 9 Jun 1997 10:05 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA27067; Mon, 9 Jun 1997 10:05:05 +0200<br>Date: Mon, 9 Jun 1997 10:05:05 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA29068<br>Received: (qmail 25201 invoked from network); 7 Jun 1997 15:07:18 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 7 Jun 1997 15:07:18 -0000<br>Message-Id: <970607110506_-1396943546@emout17.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5616 href="#5616">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/1997 2:47:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Ed Foote wrote:<br><br>''    I don't know if I can agree with this.

Is it just coincidence that the more prevalent   <br>12TET has become the more string players and singers have used vibrato?<br><br>Also, the same people will accept such thirds as will accept chamber   <br>music with piano and strings, using an equally-tempered piano.  In this   <br>case, either 1) the strings match the piano and the audience finds those   <br>14 cent wide 3rds just fine, or 2) the strings continue to play with more   <br>pure intervals (compared to each other) and the audience doesn't notice   <br>that they're not in tune with the piano.<br><br>In concerts that have pieces both for strings alone and for strings with   <br>piano, I have never heard the audience talking about the temperament(s)   <br>used.

I think that there is a misconception.<br><br>Temperaments are only necessary on those instruments which are tuned prior<br>to playing.  Those instruments which are tuned AS they are played will<br>always search for beatless intervals (or as close as time and skill<br>allow.)<br><br>The brass sections in any major orchestra are very good at finding just<br>major thirds, for instance.  You'll find that the gorgeous full sound of a<br>low brass section usually occurs when the tuning is as close to just as<br>the skill of the performers allows.<br><br>Likewise, I don't know of any choir that could conscientiously sing in<br>'werckmeister III' or 'Vallotti.'  They simply listen to each other, and<br>find as beatless a sound as they can get.<br><br>String players tune to PERFECT fifths, rather than tempered fifths, with<br>one exception: some cellists (and fewer violists) will tune to tempered<br>fifths in chamber music featuring a piano.  This is because their low C<br>string is three fifths away from their tuning note of A, and the<br>difference between the C which is three fifths lower than A, and the<br>tempered C is quite noticeable.  (Schoenberg did ask that his string<br>players tune to tempered fifths, but I don't know anyone who does this<br>now.)<br><br>I reiterate: Tempering is only necessary for those instruments which are<br>tuned prior to playing (keyboards,fretted instruments.)<br><br>Joe Downing,<br>Chair, Composition/Theory<br>Syracuse University School of Music<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 20 Jun 1997 19:00 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01467; Fri, 7 Feb 1997 00:59:04 +0100<br>Date: Fri, 7 Feb 1997 00:59:04 +0100<br>From: <tuning@eartha.mills.edu><br>Message-Id: <9702062359.AA01467@ns.ezh.nl><br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA00357<br>Apparently-To: <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl><br><br>Received: (qmail 24214 invoked from network); 20 Jun 1997 16:54:38 -0000<br>Message-Id: <970620124726_845562056@emout16.mail.aol.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5667 href="#5667">ðŸ”—</a>smith@cnmat.cnmat.berkeley.edu (Ronald Bruce Smith)</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Joe Downing wrote:<br>>I reiterate: Tempering is only necessary for those instruments which are<br>>tuned prior to playing (keyboards,fretted instruments.)<br>><br>Thank you for stating this so eloquently.

Still, in my admittely<br>brief experimentation with LucyTuning, it struck me as an interesting<br>tuning with definite musical possibilities.<br><br>   But I should qualify that by saying that it strikes me as one of a long<br>list of interesting tuning possibilities, and at a quick glance, it seems<br>to me to be somewhere in the lower middle priority-wise of that list.<br><br><br><br><br>>For most of us, the difference between the "cooked" [tempered] and the natural<br>>[just] version is so slight that it becomes lost in the idiosyncracies of<br>>performance.<br><br>   I believe that to be both thoroughly true, and thorougly false in two<br>different ways.  Anybody who has played an indefinite-pitch instrument<br>(e.g., virtually all orchestral instruments) can easily confirm that the<br>pitch-biasing imperfections of these instruments, combined with the time<br>and attention limits of normal-speed music, make it extremely difficult to<br>precisely perform in, for example, 12TET vs. QC meantone, much less the<br>subtle variations of different well temperaments.

Firstly,<br>sustained chords certainly do occur occasionally in normal-speed music, and<br>they probably get the most attention in the audience's mind, at least when<br>it comes to how the tuning affects them.
