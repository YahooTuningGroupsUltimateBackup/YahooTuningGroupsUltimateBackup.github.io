I got a note from someone on the list who I've<br>never met who seems to have remembered me as an idjit who<br>spends his time trying to explain critspeak PoMo stuff that Brian<br>disses in English (MOI?), and who has taken me to task for not<br>bothering to explain deconstruction ("Forget this sociolinguistic<br>crap", quoth he). Can you imagine some poor soul who might<br>actually *care* about this stuff enough to ask about some<br>cockamamie term like "deconstruction" that's not even been<br>in the recent McLarenist quiver? I've suggested that the boy<br>take a hot toddy and sit down with a copy of Harry Partch's<br>"Genesis of a Music" until things return to normal (there's<br>no substitute for the Great Books, after all). In the meantime,<br>I can imagine that there's some bearing between an attempt<br>to define deconstruction as a method (small "d") and Brian's<br>recent pronouncements on what X "means." So I'll do it quietly<br>and then go away to contemplate Neil Haverstick's comments<br>on matter and spirit.<br><br>The term is actually pretty old - it dates from the late 60s<br>and early 70s. The name was given by Jacques Derrida.<br>I suppose that if there's a "method" to it (and this<br>is a bit of a problem, since we're talking about a<br>*collection* of ISMs rather than a single orthodoxy),<br>it would more or less look something like this:<br><br>1. Find what seems to be a simple binary opposition<br>in a given text, and demonstrate that the opposition is<br>not merely linguistically described as an "other", but<br>rather as a "lesser other" or hierarchial pair. One might<br>try this with a pair of "others" in J. Murray Barbour as<br>a stretch - provided you could collapse the whole book's<br>polemics into ET and "those other things." [which are<br>always described according to the degree to which they<br>approach ET].<br><br>2. Do something which tries to tease out the language<br>which, in the guise of "mere description" or "style",<br>could actually be shown to be doing something else. The<br>usual way that deconstruction goes about doing this<br>involves "playing" with the language itself - using<br>semantic ambiguity or some other kind of linguistic<br>feature (an etymology which can be read two ways, for<br>example) to do so. Lots of folks who claim to "do"<br>deconstruction argue a lot about whether this part of<br>it is "created" or "discovered" (that is, whether or not<br>the problem is that one is merely teasing out something<br>which is already present in the language itself, but I<br>hope you sort of get the idea. As an example, one might<br>seize on some lengthy bit of McLarenist fulmination which<br>kept referring to "harmony," in some form, and then refer<br>constantly to the term in its "social" context - making<br>the point that McLaren's use of language in describing those<br>positions with which he is in disagreement [the usual<br>calls for the banishment of anyone he personally doesn't<br>happen to like] is the language of banishment and<br>obliteration...putting the "harm" in "harmony", as it<br>were...in fact, suggesting that his position has nothing<br>to *do* with harmony.<br><br>3. Having had one's fun with subverting and monkeying with<br>the original "real" meanings of things, one returns to the<br>more serious business of reworking the original stealth<br>hierarchy one started with in a way which preserves more<br>of a sense of difference. The first time I heard the stuff<br>done rather than listening to one of my colleagues oafishly<br>parody it, I was pretty surprised that there actually *was*<br>something beyond the wordplay. Simply put, I think it often<br>goes something like this:<br><br>"The language at work here has as a major goal the notion<br>of convincing you that there's a simple connection between<br>'words' and 'things', so that you'll accept a bunch of other<br>metaphysical baggage amenable to the arguer's position.<br>I think that's misleading - I think that the best we can<br>do is to remind ourselves that *any* attempt at the use<br>of language will do that - even *mine.* The best one does<br>in that case is to remind ourselves that *all* of us deal<br>with language as an intersubjective phenomenon -<br>intersubjective in the way that music is, if you will. The<br>best system is the one which reminds us that language tends<br>first and foremost to wind up referring to itself and the<br>score of other possible meanings as much or more than to<br>"things in the world."<br><br>That's really more or less all one does. While I don't care<br>for the technique personally, I think this is a reasonably<br>fair and balanced account of how it more or less works. What<br>I appreciate about the position and method itself is the sense<br>that it explicitly deals with the "imbedded" nature of language -<br>that is, it seeks at its best to remind us that language in a<br>given piece of writing as often as not isn't merely about a set<br>of denotative meanings. And, as you can imagine, most decon<br>types don't spend their time berating you for not using a<br>dictionary definition.<br><br>Let a hundred phrases bloom,<br>Gregory<br><br>_<br>I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited.
