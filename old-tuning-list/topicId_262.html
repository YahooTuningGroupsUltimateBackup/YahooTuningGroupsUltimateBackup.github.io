In turn, octave similarity is the fundamental axiom of traditional Western tonal  <br>and modal harmony and music theory. In previous work on new tuning systems by Bohlen and by Mathews, Pierce, et al., a new tuning was suggested in  <br>which a basic exponential cycle k produces intervals given by k^(1/13), when k = 3. The concept of equal temperaments with intervals given by  <br>k^(1/n) [where k = 3, 5,6,7...N, n and m, are natural numbers not equal to  x^y (where x, y = 1,2,3 ... N)] is generalized and elaborated upon. <br><br>	The resulting tunings, called "expanded tunings" are consequently organized according to the mathematical coherence given by the periodicity  <br>of k. However, the *perceptual* organization of such tunings may seem unclear, since, in the absence of powers of two (octaves), perceptual  <br>similarity would have to be elicited by k-type intervals (termed "morenoctaves" in the context of an expanded tuning), which, at first hand, seems  <br>theoretically possible in light of the the various similitudes between octave and k-interval perception/repetition rate, similar patterns in  <br>Terhardt's proposed Pitch Processor, and harmonic rate coincidence. Since neither Mathews, Pierce et al. nor any other researchers have investigated  <br>the question of perceptual similarity when k > 2, precise definitions of the problems of chroma spaces and octave and perceptual similarity are  <br>analyzed in the light of: 1) the newly proposed families of expanded tunings, 2) their practical meaning in terms of music composition, 3) current  <br>research on related psychoacoustical-cognitive problems, 4) three experiments specifically designed to explore for the first time the plausibility  <br>of cognitive coherence in all expanded tunings (expanded chromas). To accomplish these goals, the class of expanded tunings is explained as a class  <br>of log-based equal tunings derived from the relationships implied in the harmonic series, and the main theoretical properties of these unexplored  <br>musical tuning systems explained. <br><br>	A review of the literature reveals furthermore that, psychoacoustically, there is no reason to reject the similarity of morenoctaves  <br>provided that certain conditions hold ï¿½ for example, that a tuning based on the similarity of morenoctaves does not contain close approximation to  <br>octaves. In reference to composition with these systems, solutions to practical problems are proposed. A system to implement expanded tunings using  <br>current technology is explained, and problems concerning the notation of music in expanded tunings are examined. The use of color, for example, is  <br>proposed as a solution to the dissociation between pitch class and pitch name in tunings with more or less than twelve classes. <br><br>	In order to illustrate the practical meaning of expanded chromas in reference to music composition, and compositional problems, several  <br>originally composed musical examples are examined, and related problems to composition discussed. The abstract dimensionality of pitch is next  <br>discussed in the light of current models, and a new geometrical, basic three-dimensional model of pitch ï¿½ instead of the traditional two-dimensional  <br>one ï¿½ is proposed as a better means to represent expanded chromas. <br><br>	A paradigm of empirical research, based on this model is explained in relation to the problem of obtaining experimental evidence for the  <br>cognitive reality of expanded chroma, and the assumptions necessary for the specific design of a main experiment and two secondary ones are  <br>examined. <br><br>	The results of three experiments (described herein) show that, among trained musicians, subjects have a spontaneous relative sense of  <br>expanded chroma because statistically, they are capable of recognizing the similarity of harmonic functions of a fragment of music in expanded  <br>tunings under the operation of rigid transposition and ï¿½ with much more difficulty ï¿½ under the operation of rigid chord inversion. This means that  <br>perception of the dimension of chroma in music ï¿½ hitherto unexplored ï¿½ is a capability of the human mind, and that expanded tunings can be coherent.<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 4 Jan 1996 05:21 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id UAA06590; Wed, 3 Jan 1996 20:21:07 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 3 Jan 1996 20:21:07 -0800<br>Message-Id: <9601040419.AA18880@ ccrma.Stanford.EDU ><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Free copies of my doctoral dissertation on expanded tunings</h1><h3><a id=2433 href="#2433">ðŸ”—</a>eig@ccrma.stanford.edu (Enrique Moreno)</h3><span>1/3/1996 7:13:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Dear Friends of The Tuning Forum,<br><br>	I'd be happy to send a copy of my recently completed doctoral dissertation (see abstract below) to any interested person on this list.
