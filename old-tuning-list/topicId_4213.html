One set consists of 5 octaves of steel<br>bars with solenoid strikers controlled by a standard mechanical keyboard<br>(Harp/Celesta Bells).  There is also another complete set of 5 octaves of<br>"Flemish Bells."  Both are amplified via magnetic pickups and tube<br>amplifieres through large out door PA speakers.  Following completion of<br>the restoration, the instrument will be installed in a small bell tower, as<br>yet to be constructed.<br><br>Other features of the instrument include a mechanical roll player complete<br>with timers and about a dozen paper player piano type rolls.<br><br>I am close to completing a draft of the tuning and am hoping that members<br>of the list will be able to offer feedback about what I have developed. <br>The tuning was developed with Quattro Pro 8.0 and I will be converting it<br>to various formats (html, excel, etc.) and making the files, along with<br>documentation, available on my website within a week.<br><br>If anyone out there is interested in providing feedback, please let me<br>know.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Darren Burgess<br>Gainesville, FL</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>New List Member Introduction</h1><h3><a id=8847 href="#8847">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Darren Burgess&#x22; &#x3C;dburgess@acceleration.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/18/1998 6:43:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Greetings,<br><br>Darren Burgess here from Gainesville, FL.
