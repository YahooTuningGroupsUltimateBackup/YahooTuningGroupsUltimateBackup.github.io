It preceded the third historically and seems<br>to be more central in world music than the major third, which seems to have<br>become more important in western polyphonic music than elsewhere.  I've had<br>the experience of playing and listening to recordings of music played on a<br>piano in three roughly equidistant tunings: 12 TET (fifths 2.0 cents flat,<br>thirds 13.6 cents sharp), sixth comma mean tone (MT) (fifths 3.6 cents flat,<br>thirds 7.2 cents sharp), and quarter comma MT (fifths 5.4 cents flat, thirds<br>just).  My overall impression is that in 12 TET, the piano has a<br>characteristic "fine old burnished" sound - very lively with a lot of beating.<br>To me, the beating and shrillness considerably detract from the pleasantness<br>of the piano's sound.  When the piano is tempered to sixth comma MT, the sound<br>is more relaxed.  The major and minor triadic harmonies seem more natural<br>sounding and to me they sound better, warmer.  Nevertheless, after having<br>become used to hearing the piano in quarter comma MT, the sixth comma MT music<br>still sounds somewhat strained and harsh to me, while it sounds to me much<br>more harmonious and pleasant in quarter comma MT.<br><br>When I listen closely to the piano's sound in these different tunings, I can<br>discern in both the 12 TET and sixth comma MT music a subtle "liveliness"<br>resulting from a lot of fast pulsatings in the sound.  The effect is to give<br>the sound a roughness or harshness which takes away from the pleasantness and<br>somehow in a way the clarity of the music.  By contrast, in the quarter comma<br>MT tuning, there seems to be an almost complete absence of a certain "brand"<br>of this "liveliness" which gives me a kind of sense of relief, as though the<br>air had been cleared of smoke or as though the fog on my windshield had<br>evaporated.<br><br>Now there's another kind of inharmoniousness which remains in the quarter<br>comma MT tuned piano.  Now it's there and now it's not.  Sometimes fourths in<br>the bass seem to be a bit unpleasant.  The fifths are a little flatter than<br>would be ideal - not really nice and crisp.  But by comparison with the sharp<br>thirds temperaments, the piano sounds absolutely beautiful.  The triadic<br>harmonies are really sweet sounding while in 12 TET they sound strained and<br>labored and pinched, and the same holds to a somewhat lesser degree for the<br>sixth comma MT.<br><br>I've thought about this and tried to figure out why these temperaments affect<br>the sound of the piano I'm working with in this way.<br><br>I've just listened to some of Bill Sethares' fascinating music on a CD which I<br>just received from him.  There is a delightful harmonious smooth feel to much<br>of the sound, and believe it or not, there's something about it reminiscent of<br>the way my piano sounded when it was in quarter comma MT - a very pleasant<br>freedom from roughness giving the music a feel of clarity and definition.<br><br>This makes me think that the beating and trembling which results from<br>mistuning plays a big part in marring the sound of mistuned music.  It may be<br>that some kinds of beating actually enhance the music's sound.  But the<br>tremulous, fast and I believe largely synchronous, coherent, and piercing<br>beating which mistuned thirds in particular give to the piano's sound seem to<br>me to be really detrimental to the sound.<br><br>If I listen for beating in the music of the piano tuned to quarter comma MT, I<br>can hear some waviness.  Generally it is not prominent and doesn't impose<br>itself on my attention.  It doesn't seem to give the sound any noticeable<br>"muddiness".<br><br>I thought about the beating phenomenon.  Looking at a simple case, with<br>fifths, the third partial of the root will beat against the second partial of<br>the mistuned fifth above it and the beat rate will be proportional to the<br>product of the frequency of the root note, the number 3, and the degree of<br>mistuning in cents.  In the case of mistuned thirds, the fifth partial of the<br>root will beat against the fourth partial of the mistuned third above it and<br>the beat rate will now be proportional to the product of the frequency of the<br>root note, the number 5, and the degree of mistuning in cents.<br><br>I've done some spectral analysis of piano string partials and I've found that<br>for notes in the vicinity of middle C, the partials are quite strong up past<br>the 10th or 20th or so.  I believe that it is not totally missing the mark to<br>suggest that there will be a tendency for a mistuning of thirds by X cents to<br>cause beating with a beat frequency 5/3 times the beat frequency which results<br>from a mistuning of fifths by X cents.<br><br>I'm sure the matter is more complex than the above simplified picture would<br>imply, but it would be in line with my impressions that mistuning of thirds<br>seems to me to be more deleterious to piano music's sound than mistuning of<br>fifths.<br><br>Somewhat related to this is my sense that in quarter comma MT piano music, the<br>narrowness of the minor thirds (they are theoretically narrow by 5.4 cents in<br>this tuning) impresses itself on my attention somewhat more than the<br>narrowness of the fifths, also by 5.4 cents, in harmonic contexts.
