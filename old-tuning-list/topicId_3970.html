I'm<br>figuring how you did it to use next time.David Finnamore asked about the<br>name centaur. At the time I first tuned this pump organ to a five limit<br>tuning that I found really not  very satisfying for what I wanted. So I<br>worked out Centaur with these 7cap intervals which kept your  5cap .just<br>major scale I thus saw it as a mixture of two different animals<br>respectfully. This was 1977. I recently found out that about this time<br>that the Chiron, a body between a planet and an asteroid was discovered<br>( iknew nothing of this!). It was by the name "Chiron" which came to me<br>(in a manner I wish not to disclose publicly) that I found this out.<br>That Chiron was the centaur teacher and guide of Jason and Hercules, I<br>find interesting since I came up with this tuning as a "guide" and<br>teaching method for these 7cap intervals. Just as interesting would be<br>the inversion of subharmonic version of this scale that I have never<br>tuned up since I rarely work in electronics. I used this scale for over<br>ten years along side Wilsons Cps tunings and never tired of it. Finally<br>I need to tune up another tuning that shared some of the reeds and stop<br>using it. Hopefully when I find another Estey Organ this will be the<br>first tuning I will do!
