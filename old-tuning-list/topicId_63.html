Forgive me if you've already seen it.  <br><br>   Until now in this series of postings, I've dealt mostly with nuts and bolts<br>of 88CET:  basic resources, notation systems, and pragmatic considerations of<br>mere existence in a nonoctave world.  Now it's time to start moving a bit closer<br>to actual composition.  <br><br>   First of all, as I'll explain in later postings, you actually can produce<br>traditional harmony in 88CET, despite its utterly alien nature.  But for now,<br>I'll concentrate on the underlying considerations of composition in 88CET's more<br>native nontraditional domain, differ from those of traditional composition.  <br><br>   Some underlying premises of composition don't change at all.  The<br>compositional technique of inventing a melody and harmonizing it certainly still<br>makes sense.  The harmonies end up different, but that basic approach still<br>works fine.  Chorale-style block chords still make sense.  The various species<br>of counterpoint still have perfectly good meaning in 88CET.  Many of the basic<br>concepts of form, such as architectonic (hierarchical) structure and open vs.<br>closed form, still apply, but some of the more sophisticated ideas have more<br>complicated ramifications.  <br><br>Tonality, Phrasing, and Cadences<br><br>   Not surprisingly, chord sonorities are very different.  You can't, within the<br>realm of nontraditional harmony anyway, pull an authentic cadence from Western<br>Culture's standard bag of tricks, to create the impression of finality, or the<br>deceptive cadence to create a surprise.  <br><br>   The obvious question to ask then, is how this affects phrasing.  Can you<br>create a sense of finality or harmonic surprise through other means? If not,<br>then can you present the sensation of partial and complete rest harmonically, or<br>are you always in a harmonic limboland? <br><br>   One fact is certain - people do have tonal memory - they can tell when they<br>hear a pitch repeated.  Tonality does not have to be reinforced harmonically or<br>contrapuntally by tendency-tone resolution for your audience to sense a return<br>to an original pitch.  I was surprised to discover that you can create the<br>sensation of a tonal center in absence of pitch classes.  Beginning and ending a<br>rhythmically complete phrase on the same note creates a clear sense of return<br>(certainly at least, in the absence of other factors deliberately confusing this<br>sensation).  Ending the phrase on the same chord voicing adds to this effect,<br>even if tendency-tone resolution doesn't reinforce it.  Tonality can revolve<br>around a single pitch rather than an entire pitch class.  <br><br>   Similarly, ending a well-formed phrase on a different pitch from where it<br>begins will create a sense of modulation.  But that sense of modulation will<br>only be a weak one, as will a merely melodically reinforced tonality.  Releasing<br>harmonic tension at phrase endings strengthens a sense of tonality enormously.<br>Obviously I'm not saying anything new here.  <br><br>   Perhaps to some of you, the idea that I would concern myself with tonality in<br>a totally new domain like 88CET, seems pointless.  Tonality certainly isn't any<br>sort of requirement, but it's certainly not pointless.  It's a powerful tool.<br>In either case, exploring harmonic tension and progression is valuable.<br><br>   So are there dissonant-to-consonant resolutions in nontraditional 88CET<br>harmony that can serve this purpose?
