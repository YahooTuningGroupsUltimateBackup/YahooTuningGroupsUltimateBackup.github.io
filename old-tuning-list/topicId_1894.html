Historically there have been two basic ideals<br>for choosing models:<br>1.  Is it useful?<br>2.  Is it simple?<br><br>   The first one is essentially says that a Scientific model is "good" if<br>it sets the groundwork for useful technology.  Cast in a mildly cynical<br>light, this could be characterized the old addage about the winners writing<br>the history books:  If a theory produces positive effects upon your life,<br>then it is more likely to become accepted, and accepted also as the basis<br>for the next advance.  <br><br>   The second one harkens back to the ancient Greeks.  It says that a good<br>model depends on the smallest number of axioms, but the largest number of<br>interactions between those axiomatic elements.  <br><br>   To illustrate by extreme case, consider a vibrating air column, say of a<br>flute.  Conceptually, I could precisely describe how it vibrates by taking<br>each individual air molecule in the tube, and describe its movement through<br>the tube, down to the nanosecond of time and the millionth of a millimeter,<br>and beyond.  Once I've described the movement of the first air molecule, I<br>then then choose another air molecule, and describe its movement, and so<br>forth for each of the untold quadrillions of air molecules in the tube.<br><br>   That would be an unfathomably, mind-bogglingly complicated model, but<br>there's no denying that it would exactly describe the air column's<br>vibrations to form a flute sound. <br><br>   The other extreme is to describe the air column by rule.  You model it<br>in terms of air pressure, density and temperature, and how they interact to<br>propagate sound waves through a tube.  That model, altough certainly not<br>trivial, describes a flute tube in terms of less than a dozen measurable,<br>verifiable quantities.  It is therefore many quadrillions of times more<br>simple than the other model.  <br><br>   Is that second model a better model?  It almost certainly is if you're<br>interested in describing more than one particular flute tube, if you're<br>interested in a model that can be described in writing in a book small<br>enough to fit into the known universe, or if you're interested in a model<br>whose underlying concepts can be adapted to other types of instruments. <br>But is it INHERENTLY better?  Can you be completely certain that every<br>single human being that will ever trod this earth will agree that it's a<br>better model?<br><br>   Well...  I suppose one could claim that my choice of the second sort of<br>model as inherently better is based upon mysticism, or perhaps upon<br>prejudice.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 25 Mar 1997 03:51 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14309; Tue, 25 Mar 1997 03:51:36 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14342<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id SAA18086; Mon, 24 Mar 1997 18:50:00 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 24 Mar 1997 18:50:00 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199703242146_MC2-133A-C1C9@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>One More Thought on Mysticism and Science</h1><h3><a id=5188 href="#5188">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MorriSonics@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/1997 6:49:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I realize that this Science and Mysticism topic may perhaps be getting a<br>tad old to some of us, and perhaps had "iffy" value on the tuning list, but<br>I'd like to one more comment following from Bruce K.'s comment that the<br>axioms (axia? - whatever) of science can be thought of as mystically<br>chosen:<br><br>   One of the axioms of Science is what defines a "good" model of ... well,<br>whatever you're modeling.
