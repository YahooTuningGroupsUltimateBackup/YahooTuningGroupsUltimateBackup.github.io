But before I comment on this I would<br>like to observe that the three most usual forms of the modern<br>(post-Baroque) minor scale are present among these 28 chromatic modes.<br>John Chalmers, in a private communication, has commented on this to me<br>(I hope I do not misrepresent him), and it is certainly a very<br>intriguing circumstance that I have long since noticed.<br><br>But to return to the matter of playing these in 12-tone equal. Yes, this<br>is of course possible, but the resulting modes conflate a number of<br>aurally distinct modes into single, neutral modes, and lack much of the<br>distinct melodic character of the 19-tone versions.<br><br>For an example of what I mean, take the most common form of the minor<br>scale (on C for convenience):<br><br>C D Eb F G Ab B C<br><br>This can be played in 12-tone equal, but loses much of its piquancy<br>thereby. This is partly because the highly characteristic augmented tone<br>Ab-B is confounded with the minor third. Historically, the 'minor scale'<br>derived much of its attractiveness from the use of the mesotonic, which<br>preserves the augmented tone close to the just values (there are<br>several). I have elsewhere referred to the fact that this is one of the<br>few respects in which 31-tone equal is melodically quite distinct from<br>12-tone equal. But 19-tone equal is still more distinct.<br><br>Again, to give a better idea of exactly why one cannot adequately play<br>chromatic modes in 12-tone equal, let me offer up Yasser's old (but very<br>good) analogy between 12-tone equal and 7-tone equal. One can reproduce<br>the seven diatonic modes in 7-tone equal, but they are merged into a<br>single, neutral mode, for 7-tone equal has no semitones. This is very<br>much what occurs when a chromatic mode such as C D Eb F G Ab B C is<br>played in 12-tone equal - it is largely sterilized of its unique modal<br>flavor, because the two species of semitones are confounded.<br><br>Indeed, even the _diatonic_ modes are severely enfeebled in 12-tone<br>equal, both because this temperament has such poor consonances, and<br>because its dissonances are not intense enough to provide the requisite<br>tension between consonance and dissonance, which is (within a suitably<br>tempered, coherent, closed system) what propels music forward both<br>melodically and harmonically.<br><br>Paul Ehrlich asserts that 22-tone equal is the only path to escape<br>diatonicism. Not so. His categorical attitude is refreshing, but 22-tone<br>equal is not a temperament at all, but a mere tuning artefact that<br>reproduces the worst defects of just intonation. Not that I wish to<br>question the validity of the just ratios as standards for musical<br>thought.<br><br>The two principles that constitute genuine alternatives to diatonicism<br>are:<br><br>1) The chromatic genus, where harmony is required. I have defined the<br>four modal genera comprising 28 modes that have enough consonant chords<br>on enough degrees (4 of 7) to be  harmonically usable in chromaticism.<br>Here is as good a place as any to remark that there are two additional<br>chromatic genera that possess consonant chords on 4 of the 7 degrees<br>(none have consonant chords on 5 or 7 of the degrees, and only the<br>diatonic has such chords on 6 of the degrees):<br><br>C _Db_ E F G A B C<br>C Db Eb F G Ab _B_ C<br><br>These however each contain a degree (underlined) that is a member of no<br>consonant chord within the modal genus, and therefore the modes of these<br>modal genera (scales) could never be established in harmony.<br><br>2)the enharmonic genus, where harmony is not an important element. This<br>involves the use of 1/3 tones, which are never written in our music, but<br>which fill the living rock melos of our people. No theorist should ever<br>presume to discount the importance of what the musically untutored<br>produce from their own melodic inspiration. They stand in need of our<br>guidance, but we also of theirs.<br><br>The 19-tone equal temperament _alone_ can give access to either of these<br>two genera, just as it alone gives adequate access to the diatonic<br>genus. This follows from the principle of the melodic limen, and from<br>the incredibly close harmonic congruence between just intonation and the<br>19-tone equal.  I have not leisure here to treat this in the depth that<br>it deserves, but would like to observe something that I do not believe<br>has ever been clearly noticed before. If the consonances of the senario<br>are each taken as new tonics, we arrive at 19 just intervals within the<br>octave:<br><br>1:1 25:24 16:15 10:9 9:8 16:15 5:4 32:25 4:3 25:18 36:25 3:2 25:16 8:5<br>      5:3 16:9 9:5 15:8 48:25 2:1<br><br>These are the intervals that singers can actually sound accurately<br>singing pure consonances, although there is some debate concerning the<br>ability to reliably distinguish between the commatically separated<br>species of tones. Of these, the 19-tone equal merges the minor and major<br>tones, and also the two species of minor seventh, and intercalates the<br>augmented tone/diminished third and the augmented sixth/diminished<br>seventh. Thus this temperament directly corresponds to the most<br>fundamental intervals of just intonation. No other temperament enjoys<br>such a direct correspondence, although the 31- and 50-tone (_not_ the<br>17- 22- 43- or 53-tone) equal are next in the sequence.<br><br>Finally, on a lighter note, Carl Lumma was somewhat incoherent in his<br>remarks.
