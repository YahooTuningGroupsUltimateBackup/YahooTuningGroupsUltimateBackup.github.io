I make my samples in CPS, not cents<br>so if one is starting with a base freq of 440 then multiplying by 3/2,<br>5/4...27/16....3645/2048...etc., the amount of decimal places obviously<br>varies.

If you hear beating/phasing between a<br>given pair of frequencies, then something's off. <br><br>To answer your second question, yes, I am talking - at least in my case -<br>about sustained tones.
