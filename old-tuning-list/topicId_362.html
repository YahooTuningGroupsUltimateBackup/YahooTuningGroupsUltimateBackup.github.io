There seems to be a<br>"hyperrealism" effect that comes from the double nature of a tuning like,<br>say, 88CET.  The double nature is that the tuning is "close enough" to<br>sound fairly "normal" is one wants.  The basic feelings involved in chord<br>progressions, voice leading, cadence, etc, can be close enough to normal to<br>pass for familar.  In fact, wholly normal progressions can be created.  The<br>effect of this is to bring the listner into a familar world -- not<br>something strange and uncertain, but the concrete "reality" of "normal<br>music".  The traditional music effects involving expectation, tension,<br>release, consonance and dissonance, are in effect.  But 88CET is not 12TET,<br>and in addition to "normal" (ie, 12TET-like) sonorities, one can also<br>create a wide range of unfamilar and unusual sounds.  The quality of these<br>ranges from sounding like "slightly wrong 12TET" to "wholly dissonant" (in<br>fact, sounding "more than possibly dissonant").  And the effect of these<br>non-12TET sounds depends on their particular relation to 12TET.  If one<br>sticks a slightly "off" sound into a more or less 12TET-like framework, the<br>result is, of course, a feeling of "offness in an otherwise clear world.<br>"Normalacy" is given an edge, which can feel slightly unsettling, unstable,<br>wrong, or poignant.  If the unusual is brought out more, there is a feeling<br>of modulation *from* "normal musical reality" into an unfamilar and<br>disruptive world.  Sustained exploration of the more radically non-12TET<br>aspects of a tuning like 88CET tend toward the abstract.  When the listener<br>cannot relate their experience to 12TET, if the links between this musical<br>world and one's traditional world are few, the whole experience becomes<br>"abstract".  It becomes more on par with "noise as sound" (ie, each sound<br>has to be taken "as is", without the large rich body of tradition, which<br>colors and concreticizes most music we hear).  Therefore, it is the<br>transistional areas *between* 12-TET-like and fully non-12TET-like that are<br>most interesting to me.  And it is in this area where the term<br>*hyperrealism* seems appropriate.<br><br>It was my experience of some specific effects regarding 88CET that made me<br>think of the relation to hyperrealism (a link to photorealism and computer<br>graphics in my mind).  For example, I noticed when one write blaring<br>consonant "triumphant" chords in 88CET, it is easy to make use of slightly<br>"off" consonances, like the "major octave".  One of the features of<br>88CET is that is has no octave or 2 octave intervals (only multiples of 3<br>octaves).  Instead, it has two intervals that sit on either side of the<br>octave, what I will call a minor octave and a major octave.  Played alone,<br>they both sound awful.  They are very dissonant and produce ugly beatings.<br>But within the context of a loud triumphant chord (especially in a<br>"blaring" timbre), perhaps at the end of a major key cadence, a chord with<br>a major octave sounds very consonant, even thought the off octave is<br>clearly audible.  The result, rather than dissonance, is the feeling of<br>unstability in the consonance, and the "stretched" nature of the octave<br>makes it sound as if the music cannot quite contain itself and "oversteps"<br>its goal a little.  This feeling of "over-eagerness" is an example of my<br>interpreation of hyperrealism: The music is not simply running through<br>traditional progressions and cadences like other music -- it is doing it<br>with such force as to strain the intervals themselves!  So it is not an<br>"alternate tuning" one heard with these slight "offnesses", but music on<br>the verge of losing control, that is, hyper-expressive music.<br><br>This "on the verge of being out of control" is a major feature of this use<br>of 88CET (or many other alternate tunings).  When a more or less "normal"<br>chord progression is "interrupted" by a few "unusual chords" before<br>returning to "normalacy", the result can be a feeling of actual loss of<br>control.  What was progressing alright suddenly veered off into "wrongness"<br>for a moment.  It shows that the illusion of "everything being normal" is<br>just that -- an illusion.  And it shows that the music is quite capable of<br>"going dreadfully wrong".  This effect can be used to give a sense of<br>struggle and energy -- as if the music itself is truggling to maintain<br>"normalacy", but cannot always do it, and sometimes loses its grip, so to<br>speak.  This "struggle" between "everything going as expected" and<br>"everything going dreadfully wrong" is *the* main feature of my interest in<br>alternate tunings. The give and take between the expected and the<br>unexpected is what breathes life into music, it has always been.  This is,<br>in part, the force behind the long exploration of dissonance in Western<br>music.  But today, even the most glaring dissonances of 12TET sound glaring<br>and dissonant in a familar and expected manner.  It is a tuning that has<br>been so thoroughly explored and listend to over the last several centuries<br>that today it is near impossible to bring out some new and strange harmony<br>in it.  And this "saturation" of 12TET in our culture, the overwhelming<br>bias for 12TET music that we are programmed for from a very young age, is<br>exactly the situation in which a tuning like 88CET can work like magic.<br>For this is a bias that is so ingrained that most people are not even aware<br>that there are alternatives!  The experience of 88CET in such a situation<br>can be practically paradoxical.  It can be the destroyer of paradimes.<br>People on this tuning forum have occasionally expressed a desire to "spread<br>the word" of alternate tunings.  This seems to be a feeling that the<br>general ignorance of alternate tunings is detrimental to the work of<br>composers exploring alternate tunings.  I would like to suggest that the<br>degree of understanding of alternate tunings among general listeners is,<br>more or less, unimportant.  The use of alternate tunings is not a *style*,<br>like be-bop or techno (although styles might require alternate tunings<br>(like gamelon music)) -- it is a tool, more like the use of a new musical<br>instrument, like the saxophone.  People might like the sound of a<br>saxophone, or of an altnerate tuning, in an abstract, non-musical sense.<br>But until good music is written with new tools, there is no impetus to<br>listen to music written with these tools.  One might "spread the word" of a<br>new tool to composers, but as far as listeners are concerned, one wants to<br>spread "good music", regardless of the tools.  And the point is that new<br>tools often make it easier for compoers to write good music.  The new tools<br>allow the exploration of new sonorities, new discoveries, they allow easier<br>access to that magical zone between expected and unexpected music.  All too<br>often, music that is "different" in some specific way is advertised as<br>such, thereby limited the appeal of the music to people who are interested<br>in that certain characteristic of the music.  A good example of this is<br>"gay music".  For a gay musical act to cross over and become successful at<br>large is seen as a rare and sought after phenomenon.  Good music is not<br>good because of one particular aspect, be it its lyrical meaning, its<br>instrumentation, or its tuning.  Good music transcends its various<br>characteristics -- and to advertise one or another characteristic of it is<br>to miss the point entirely, to reduce the music to some *non-musical*<br>aspect of limited interest.  Why play music for someone and say beforehand,<br>"listen to this weird tuning", thereby focusing them *away* from the deeper<br>aspect of good music?  John Coltrane is not particularly interesting<br>because he played the saxophone, he is interesting because his music<br>*works*.  And it works in a way that, while fundamentally tied to<br>instrumentation, transcends it.<br><br>But to return to the discussion of 88CET, there are a few more examples of<br>hyperreality that I would like the mention.  If *hyperreal* means "more<br>real than real", then it is an appropriate word to describe musical events<br>that "go beyond" what they are "supposed" to do.  Chord progression and<br>modulation in 88CET seem to display this kind of thing often.  Because of<br>the asymmetrical octave nature of 88CET, chord progression tend to sound<br>relatively normal, but might end up someplace unexpected -- either too high<br>or too low.  An upward modulation that somehow ends up "too high", or a<br>downward modulation that ends up "too low", but otherwise sounding more or<br>less like its "expected to", resulted in a sense of skewed musical space.<br>A feeling of "going beyond normal", being realer than real.  These feeling<br>would not be as poignant as they are if it were not for our overwhelming<br>bias for 12TET dimensions.  And that is the effect of this "skewing of<br>musical space" -- poignancy.  If done well, this technique can increase the<br>particular mood, be it triumphant, bittersweet, or whatever -- if the<br>harmonies are "going a little beyond" the expected, so too will the emotion<br>-- the music will be "overly expressive".  Suddenly old techniques of<br>harmonies -- basic cadences, passing tones, suspensions, etc -- are free of<br>their 12TET incarnations (those basic "licks" our culture is saturated with<br>beyond the point of cliche) and useful once again as basic building blocks<br>of new sounds.<br><br>One final reason why I enjoy working in 88CET so much -- the exploration of<br>uncharted realms.  What a joy to work with progressions and modulation that<br>have never been heard before.  To be a participant in the discovery of an<br>entirely new world.  People seem to think that in today's modern world<br>there is nothing left to explore.  People seek out the deepest, most remote<br>caves and underwatern trenches in search of the "lost frontier".  The same<br>feelings of this lost frontier are perceivable in the arts.  Was not art<br>brought to (and beyond) the ultimate frontiers in the 1960s?  Is not art<br>today retrospective and lost?  How could this be when unthinkably vast<br>realms of totally unexplored musical worlds lie at our feet, asking for<br>pioneers?  And this in the field of alternate tunings alone.  There are<br>similar vast frontiers visible in electronic music, to name just one other<br>example.  Just as the heliocentric theory and thetheory of evoultion<br>redefined our notions of the Earth and humanity as small subsets of<br>infinities of possibility, so too have alternate tunings (And electronics,<br>etc) redefined western music, placing it within a small set dwarfed by the<br>infinity of possibility.  And who says it is difficult to be original??  If<br>the unexplored was any more obvious, it would be biting our legs.<br><br><br>-- <br>Paul Fly                      |   Our deeds travel with us from afar<br>pfly@nyx.cs.du.edu            |   And what we've been makes us what we are<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 25 Feb 1996 21:59 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA15195; Sun, 25 Feb 1996 12:58:52 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 25 Feb 1996 12:58:52 -0800<br>Message-Id: <960225205536_71670.2576_HHB46-4@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2583 href="#2583">ðŸ”—</a>gxla12@udcf.gla.ac.uk (Kerr Jamieson)</h3><span>2/27/1996 6:31:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Re David B.

It seems like no even centimeter mark ever exactly<br>aligns with any even inch mark, other than at the zero-point of ruler of course.<br>(Actually, you will find two that exactly align if you had a 2.54m-long ruler.<br>But in the case 7:4s and 3:2s, they will absolutely NEVER exactly align.)<br><br>   That's similar with the fact that a circle of just perfect fifths never<br>exactly closes.  No power of 3:2 is ever exactly equal to any power 2:1.  As it<br>happens, a stack of seven octaves is not far from a stack of twelve fifths, the<br>error being the Pythagorean comma (about 23.5 cents).  The basis for 12TET<br>tuning is that you can distribute that error evenly across all those fifths and<br>land exactly on seven octaves up.  But those would no longer be exact 3:2s<br>anymore.  <br><br>   And, as it turns out, a stack of eight 7:4s is about as tall as a stack of<br>eleven 3:2s, the error being about 29 cents out of about 7750 cents.  If you<br>approximate those ratios as does 88CET tuning (7:4 at 968 cents rather than<br>968.826 cents, and 32 at 704 cents rather than 701.955 cents), the two stacks<br>end up the same height.  But as with the circle of fifths, those are no longer<br>exact representations of 7:4 and 3:2 harmonies.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 28 Feb 1996 17:30 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA18141; Wed, 28 Feb 1996 08:30:01 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 28 Feb 1996 08:30:01 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9602281255.A28144-0100000@ra.isisnet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Some thought on alternate tunings</h1><h3><a id=2576 href="#2576">ðŸ”—</a>pfly@nyx.net (Paul Fly)</h3><span>2/25/1996 8:14:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I have been exploring alternate tunings via synthesizers for about 1/2 year<br>so far (mainly 19 tone and 88CET so far).

Why play music for someone and say beforehand,<br>"listen to this weird tuning", thereby focusing them *away* from the deeper<br>aspect of good music?  John Coltrane is not particularly interesting<br>because he played the saxophone, he is interesting because his music<br>*works*.  And it works in a way that, while fundamentally tied to<br>instrumentation, transcends it.<br><br>But to return to the discussion of 88CET, there are a few more examples of<br>hyperreality that I would like the mention.  If *hyperreal* means "more<br>real than real", then it is an appropriate word to describe musical events<br>that "go beyond" what they are "supposed" to do.  Chord progression and<br>modulation in 88CET seem to display this kind of thing often.  Because of<br>the asymmetrical octave nature of 88CET, chord progression tend to sound<br>relatively normal, but might end up someplace unexpected -- either too high<br>or too low.  An upward modulation that somehow ends up "too high", or a<br>downward modulation that ends up "too low", but otherwise sounding more or<br>less like its "expected to", resulted in a sense of skewed musical space.<br>A feeling of "going beyond normal", being realer than real.  These feeling<br>would not be as poignant as they are if it were not for our overwhelming<br>bias for 12TET dimensions.  And that is the effect of this "skewing of<br>musical space" -- poignancy.  If done well, this technique can increase the<br>particular mood, be it triumphant, bittersweet, or whatever -- if the<br>harmonies are "going a little beyond" the expected, so too will the emotion<br>-- the music will be "overly expressive".  Suddenly old techniques of<br>harmonies -- basic cadences, passing tones, suspensions, etc -- are free of<br>their 12TET incarnations (those basic "licks" our culture is saturated with<br>beyond the point of cliche) and useful once again as basic building blocks<br>of new sounds.<br><br>One final reason why I enjoy working in 88CET so much -- the exploration of<br>uncharted realms.  What a joy to work with progressions and modulation that<br>have never been heard before.  To be a participant in the discovery of an<br>entirely new world.  People seem to think that in today's modern world<br>there is nothing left to explore.  People seek out the deepest, most remote<br>caves and underwatern trenches in search of the "lost frontier".  The same<br>feelings of this lost frontier are perceivable in the arts.  Was not art<br>brought to (and beyond) the ultimate frontiers in the 1960s?  Is not art<br>today retrospective and lost?  How could this be when unthinkably vast<br>realms of totally unexplored musical worlds lie at our feet, asking for<br>pioneers?  And this in the field of alternate tunings alone.  There are<br>similar vast frontiers visible in electronic music, to name just one other<br>example.  Just as the heliocentric theory and thetheory of evoultion<br>redefined our notions of the Earth and humanity as small subsets of<br>infinities of possibility, so too have alternate tunings (And electronics,<br>etc) redefined western music, placing it within a small set dwarfed by the<br>infinity of possibility.  And who says it is difficult to be original??  If<br>the unexplored was any more obvious, it would be biting our legs.<br><br><br>-- <br>Paul Fly                      |   Our deeds travel with us from afar<br>pfly@nyx.cs.du.edu            |   And what we've been makes us what we are<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 25 Feb 1996 21:59 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id MAA15195; Sun, 25 Feb 1996 12:58:52 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 25 Feb 1996 12:58:52 -0800<br>Message-Id: <960225205536_71670.2576_HHB46-4@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=2583 href="#2583">ðŸ”—</a>gxla12@udcf.gla.ac.uk (Kerr Jamieson)</h3><span>2/27/1996 6:31:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Re David B.

It seems like no even centimeter mark ever exactly<br>aligns with any even inch mark, other than at the zero-point of ruler of course.<br>(Actually, you will find two that exactly align if you had a 2.54m-long ruler.<br>But in the case 7:4s and 3:2s, they will absolutely NEVER exactly align.)<br><br>   That's similar with the fact that a circle of just perfect fifths never<br>exactly closes.  No power of 3:2 is ever exactly equal to any power 2:1.  As it<br>happens, a stack of seven octaves is not far from a stack of twelve fifths, the<br>error being the Pythagorean comma (about 23.5 cents).  The basis for 12TET<br>tuning is that you can distribute that error evenly across all those fifths and<br>land exactly on seven octaves up.  But those would no longer be exact 3:2s<br>anymore.  <br><br>   And, as it turns out, a stack of eight 7:4s is about as tall as a stack of<br>eleven 3:2s, the error being about 29 cents out of about 7750 cents.  If you<br>approximate those ratios as does 88CET tuning (7:4 at 968 cents rather than<br>968.826 cents, and 32 at 704 cents rather than 701.955 cents), the two stacks<br>end up the same height.  But as with the circle of fifths, those are no longer<br>exact representations of 7:4 and 3:2 harmonies.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 28 Feb 1996 17:30 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA18141; Wed, 28 Feb 1996 08:30:01 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 28 Feb 1996 08:30:01 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9602281255.A28144-0100000@ra.isisnet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
