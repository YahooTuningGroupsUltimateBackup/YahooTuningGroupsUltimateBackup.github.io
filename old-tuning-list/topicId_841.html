The very position of the frets are according to<br>one ninth of a skhisma, resulting two sizes of commas. The bigger is about one<br>and a half times wider than the smaller, and are 12 per Oct.<br> <br>  Somebody asked me why I used this temperament and not 53 TET because the<br>latter seems to be more simple than the former and is practically the same in<br>practice. When I had the first DINARRA made I thought that the bigger spaces<br>would help to see and find the proper fret to play, and in practice it helped<br>a little. But the great improvement in order "to see" the notes was to paint<br>the semitonic frets with colors according to a system. Yet I think the bigger<br>spaces help us a little ("in" , "one before" or "one after" ) and on the other<br>hand they are connected in some cases to the harmonic 7.<br>  <br>  In May 1995 I published the book "Principios de la Gama Dinamica" (in<br>Spanish) where I included a Chapter (about 30 ps., 7 figs., 2 flow sheets and<br>three computer programs) including the way to calculate the fret positions<br>according to the physics. There is a BASIC program for PC.<br>  The parameters are<br>     The length of the chord, <br>     the "heights" between the chord and the plane of the fretboard, <br> and the height of the frets. <br> <br>  It may be adapted for other temperaments.<br>  <br>  The Dinarra strings are tuned just as for a Guitar, with some occasional<br>variation (E, A, D, G, B, E , in commas Base-A,  31- 0- 22 (or 23)- 45- 9-<br>31).   <br> <br>  Acoustic Dinarras have a warm sound because there are many notes that make<br>"echo" (sympathetic resonance) with one or several other open strings. When an<br>acoustic guitar is refreted in a DINARRA the change of the emotional message<br>of the sound is immediate and really incredible !!. It is necessary to<br>experience the change for better understanding. Even more so, in time the wood<br>of the instrument is reeducated giving out a very warm sound.<br> <br>  Well, if you need more information I'll be happy to oblige.<br> <br>--Eduardo<br> <br>  <br>Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi           E-mail : esabat@chasque.apc.org<br>Simon Bolivar 1260                Phone: (05982) 78 09 52<br>11300 Montevideo                  FAX :  (05982) 29 83 91 (Automatico)<br>Uruguay  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 6 Sep 1996 08:11 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA23731; Fri, 6 Sep 1996 08:13:02 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA23691<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id XAA12084; Thu, 5 Sep 1996 23:13:00 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 5 Sep 1996 23:13:00 -0700<br>Message-Id: <199609060210_MC1-958-2AF@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=3556 href="#3556">ðŸ”—</a>alves@osiris.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)</h3><span>9/6/1996 11:56:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Does anyone have tuning data (beyond Kunst and McPhee) on the Balinese<br>>seven tone Gamelan Selunding (variations in spelling: Slonding, Salonding,<br>>Selundung etc.)?<br><br>Since seeing your post on the gamelan list, I looked through Ernst<br>Schlager's _Rituelle Siebenton-Musik auf Bali_, probably the most<br>comprehensive study of selonding yet published.
