The size of the discrepancy is much larger, especially in the case of <br>    22TET (somewhat less so in the case of same effect in 34TET), than a<br>21.5c<br>    real syntonic comma.  In 53TET, however, this is not the case at all.  <br>2.  A real comma scenario can give rise to an (theoretically) indefinitely<br>    large sequence of pitch changes.  That is easiest to see in the<br>wandering<br>    tonic case:  If in the JI scenario you let the tonic drop by a syntonic<br>    comma and repeat that progression over and over each time dropping by <br>    81:80, you'll never quite creep down to precisely any pitch within the <br>    original "source scale" (as Steve aptly called it).  In the case of<br>22TET<br>    or 34TET on the other hand, you'll never create any pitches that are<br>not<br>    already in within your original set of 22 or 34 pitch classes.  <br>I personally agree that these important-enough reasons to merit using the<br>term "pseudocomma" instead of comma.  Others may disagree or maybe not.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 20 Jan 1997 21:38 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA09795; Mon, 20 Jan 1997 21:41:42 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA09808<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id MAA03150; Mon, 20 Jan 1997 12:41:39 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 20 Jan 1997 12:41:39 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.A32.3.91.970120133404.29406A-100000@tiger.cudenver.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4649 href="#4649">ðŸ”—</a>Mark Nowitzky &#x3C;nowitzky@pacificnet.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/1997 1:12:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Hi Gary,<br><br>In Tuning Digest 961, topic 1, you wrote:<br>>   I hear say that ".AU" files, which I THINK is a file format that Sun<br>>invented, are (losslessly) compressed.
