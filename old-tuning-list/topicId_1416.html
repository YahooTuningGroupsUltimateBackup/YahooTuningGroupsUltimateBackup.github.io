The nine-minute work has, however, a largely harmonic texture,<br>in which the individual modes are assigned to each of six small orchestras<br>distributed around the stage. Rhythmic coordination ranges from all six<br>ensembles together, groups or single ensembles coordinated, and<br>uncoordinated solo playing.  <br><br>Barlow's work is not microtonal per se, but it does seem to be a very<br>effective translation of the harmonicity and tonality functions used in his<br>Autobus piece into a very large orchestral work. It is essentially a four<br>movement symphony - with cross fades between movements, acoustical grafitti<br>c/o Bruckner and Stravinsky, and an extraordinary piano cadenza that sends<br>the work out in the grand style (with a slight nod to Frank Sinatra:<br>Barlow, saying to the whole symphonic tradition: I did it my way!)<br><br>Barlow has published an extended analysis of the work in the Feedback<br>Papers (Cologne).<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 21 Dec 1996 18:47 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA22289; Sat, 21 Dec 1996 18:50:23 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22288<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA07265; Sat, 21 Dec 1996 09:50:20 -0800<br>Date: Sat, 21 Dec 1996 09:50:20 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612211249_MC2-DC5-E22C@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4384 href="#4384">ðŸ”—</a>Matt Nathan &#x3C;mattn@ix.netcom.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/1996 2:00:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Gary Morrison wrote:<br> <br>>    As I was wading through my past messages, I came upon those I sent<br>> regarding the question of whether there's value in systematizing tunings.<br>> That as opposed to playing whatever pitch you need at the moment.<br><br>Those aren't mutually exclusive.

Matt is concentrating in particular on tuning systems that<br>have an indefinite number of pitches, like JI or meantone tunings.  <br><br>   Those are systems though.  In meantone, you always choose notes on a<br>circle of a fixed-sized fifth, and similarly in 5-limit JI you always make<br>major triads take the form of 4:5:6 (or with one or more notes<br>octave-displaced).

Picking pitches chaotically makes it more difficult to create a<br>sensation of inevitability and thus logical resolution in a cadence.  <br><br>   The traditional form of tritone resolution (leading tone upward, and<br>seventh down) is based largely upon the hindsight-obviousness of resolution<br>by half-steps to a quintessentially less discordant interval.  A lot of<br>what makes that so much sense, is simply that 12-toned systematics<br>convinces us that half steps are the smallest possible pitch difference. <br>The fact that the tritone is so dissonant and yet so close a consonant,<br>makes us hear that resolution and say "ah yes, how could we ever imagine it<br>otherwise".  That's a lot of what makes that resolution satisfying.  <br><br>   Similarly, in science, the best-accepted ideas are ones that have a<br>sense of hindsight-obviousness.  Scientists, and to a fair degree musical<br>audiences, like hindsight-obvious relationships between pre-known elements.<br> It's much harder to deal with something that requires you to accept an<br>all-new axiomatic idea.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 23 Dec 1996 18:48 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01542; Mon, 23 Dec 1996 18:51:24 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01535<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id JAA25422; Mon, 23 Dec 1996 09:51:21 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 23 Dec 1996 09:51:21 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199612231228_MC1-DC3-5B92@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4395 href="#4395">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/1996 9:54:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Ooo.  I'd better stop babbling about this, but there's one other<br>equally-important consideration about systematizing tuning:  And that is to<br>what degree your nonsystematization is based upon chaos or exception.  <br><br>   To illustrate by extreme example, sticking with a strict system for all<br>but one note can sound very awkward.  That's kind of like sticking a note<br>from an electric guitar in the middle of a string quartet!

I'm suggesting that it's a simpler organizing <br>principle to consider the audio spectrum as the pitch resource rather than any individual pitch system which <br>must then be forced into all duties including analytic. The latter is something that bugs me about Charles <br>Lucy's claims for his (adopted) system, which I told him in conversations when I met him. He says the Lucy <br>system can be used to approximate other scales of the world. My question is: Why bother; why not just use the <br>scale you're trying to approximate? Tuning systems are guides into the infinite resource, they are not that <br>resource. They provide a way of drawing individual choices from the daunting infinity of possibilites; a way <br>to get started. I'm interested in tuning systems because each suggests a way of hearing, and I enjoy hearing <br>in different ways. I am however just as interested in drawing pitches from the infinite resource using my ear <br>and inspiration, and analyzing it later if need be. Beauty often has an underlying mathematical structure, and <br>mathematical structure often appears beautiful, as Joseph Schillinger pointed out, which probably says <br>something about the construction of mind.

Certainly each system has its own<br>strengths and weaknesses for each sort of expression.  <br><br>   I'm refering to systems in the sense of choosing pitches for a<br>composition based on a clearly-recognizable (more or less consciously) set<br>of pitch relationships.  That could, for example, take the form of an<br>equal-temperament paradigm.

Many of the more exciting musical devices composer's disposal<br>come from devising brilliant ways of "stretching the limits".
