No problem there; I have always <br>felt criticism is a useful tool to progress as artists, and I have had my <br>share. I come from a very hard school of learning; my teachers did not <br>believe in being polite, but they were fair. When I began studying <br>jazz/theory in 1976, I recall a gig I did where both of my teachers came <br>to the job, sat there for several hours, and took a whole page of notes <br>on my playing...I was petrified, and embarrassed, because I knew they <br>were going to let me have it the next day, and they did. Not one of the <br>notes was favorable; the whole page involved things I was doing wrong, <br>and was expected to improve on...so, I worked very hard to get better, <br>and I did.

Well, boo hoo for me...I survived, and learned some things <br>as well. When I criticize, it is never meant to hurt on a personal level; <br>but, we're humans with feelings, so feelings do get involved. If one <br>is critical out of a desire to get the best possible out of someone, <br>that's OK by me. If one is critical out of spite, jealousy, or anger, <br>it's nonsense, and has no place anywhere, in my opinion. My feelings <br>about poor microtonal music are genuine and heartfelt. I want to hear <br>great music, and I especially feel that in the field of microtonality, we <br>need all the great music we can get. So, if my criticisms are not <br>appreciated, that is not surprising. All I can say is, I am much harder <br>on myself that I will ever be with anyone else; I will also be as honest <br>as possible.<br>    As far as Will Grant's comments about where are we going, I can say <br>that I want to produce music that speaks from deep and profound places, <br>and that will last the years. That's not so easy to do, and I have no <br>idea if I will achieve that goal. I do know, again, that it takes a lot <br>of very hard work, practice, and some sort of intuitive knowledge about <br>which way to achieve said goal. I feel blessed that I have no problem <br>with seeing the path I want to follow. Will said that someone told him to <br>"be yourself"...that's the only advice I could give, either.
