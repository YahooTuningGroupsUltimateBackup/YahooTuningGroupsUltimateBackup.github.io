He was Paul Rapoport's<br>teacher, and if anyone should be familiar with Blackwood's<br>articles and texts, you'd think Paul would be.<br>But not so.  Paul Rapoport incomprehensibly leaves out <br>*the most important* of Blackwood's articles on <br>equal temperaments:<br>[1] Blackwood, Easley.

This is so<br>obviously the *opposite* of the truth that it beggars<br>description.<br>To continue:<br>Paul Rapoport cites Viggo Brun's 1961 article, presumably<br>because Brun defines the properties of various classes<br>of equal temperaments using continued fractions.  But Rapoport<br>*fails* to cite Brun's *english-language* article on the same<br>subject: <br>[1] Brun, Viggo,. "Euclidean Algorithms and music theory," <br>L'esnseignement Mathematique Revue Internationale, <br>tome X, fasc. 1-2, 1964, pp. 125-137.<br>And because Paul Rapoport *fails* to cite this vital<br>article, he *also* neglects to cite the *other* important<br>articles which characterize equal temperaments using<br>continued fraction methods, all cited in the bibliography of<br>Brun's english-language 1964 article:<br>[2] Brun, Viggo.

"Die Harmonielehre der Ptyahgoreer,"<br>Hermes, Vol. 78, pp. 163-199<br>And since Rapoport cites one of Brun's continued fraction<br>articles,  why doesn't  he cite James Murray Barbour's <br>article "Music and Ternary  Continued Fractions," American <br>Mathematical Monthly, LV, 1948, pg. 545?  <br>Brun himself cites the Barbour article in the biblio of his<br>(Brun's) 1964 article. <br>Barbour's article covers nearly exactly the same ground as <br>Brun's--and if Brun's article is necessary, why is not Barbour's<br>article also necessary?<br>On the subject of continued fractions, the article "Musical Scale<br>Construction: the Continued Fraction Compromise," Utilitas<br>Mathematica, Vol. 42, pp. 97-113, 1992, is an even more<br>important source.  Yet Paul Rapoport blatantly ignores it.<br>Why?  <br>Is there some good reason for doing so?<br>Moritz Drobisch's book "Uber Musikalische Tonbestimmung und<br>Temperatur," Leipzig, Widmannsche Buchhandlung, 1852,<br>covers much the same ground.  Yet Paul Rapoport *also* fails<br>to cite this work.<br>Jacques Dudon's "La gamme doree: Un temperament inegal<br>issue du nombre d'or," in the collection "Nombre d'or<br>et Musique," 1987, pp. 147-157,  uses similar continued<br>fraction methods of sieving scales to obtain results similar<br>to Douthett, Drobisch, Blackwood, Barbour, Fokker, Hall,<br>Kronerup, et al.  Yet Paul Rapoport *fails* to cite *this* <br>important source as well.<br>Speaking of Kornerup--<br>Thorwald Kornerup used exactly the same methods as<br>Barbour, Brun and Douthett to classify tuning systems<br>in 4 different articles: "Acoustic Valuation of Intervals,"<br>Thorwald Kornerup, Translated by Jean Ferguson, Copenhagen,<br>Aschehoug Forlag, 1934; "Von der Urform 5-Toniger Skalen zu<br>den Golden Tonen Elekstrischer Instrumente," Kopenhagen,<br>1931; "Kornerup, Throwald, "Die Hochteilung der Oktave,"<br>Kopenhagen, 1930; "Die Vorlaufer der gleichschwebende <br>Temperaturen mit 19 oder 31 Tonen in der Oktave," Translated<br>from Danish to German by P. Friedrich Paulsen, Copenhagen,<br>J. Joergensen, 1930.<br>Why did Paul Rapoport fail to cite *these* equally important<br>sources on classifying equal temperaments?<br>Scanning Paul's bibliography, we find yet another GROSS<br>oversight--Donald Hall's name does not appear.  Yet Hall<br>has written four *important* articles on the classification of<br>equal temperaments: <br>[1] Hall, Donald. "Acoustical Numerology and Lucky Equal <br>Temperaments," American Journal of Physics,  Vol. 56, 1985<br>[2] Hall, Donald. "Quantitative Evaluation of Musical Scale Tuning," <br>American Journal of Physics, Vol. 42, 1974. pp. 543-552<br>[3] Hall, Donald. "The Objective Measurement of Goodness-of-<br>Fit for Tunings and Temperaments," Journal of Music Theory,<br>Vol. 17, pp. 274-290, 1973<br>[4] Hall, Donald. "A Systematic Evaluation of Equal Tempermaents <br>Through N=612," Interface, Vol. 14, 1985, pp. 61-73<br> --<br>This is a *criminal* oversight, since it leads the unwary<br>reader to believe that Don Hall has nothing to say about<br>equal temperaments--when he in fact has a great deal<br>to say about 'em.<br>--<br>Since Paul Rapoport's article deals specifically with the notation<br>of equal temperaments, you'd expect that he'd cite other<br>basic texts on xenharmonic notation.  For example, Ivor Darreg's<br>Xenharmonic Bulletin No. 6, 1975, devoted *entirely* to<br>non-12 notation. <br>Or "Notation for Non-Twelve," Ivor Darreg, Interval, <br>Spring-Summer 1980, Vol. 1, pg. 12 "Notation For <br>Non-Twelve - part 2," Ivor Darreg, Interval,<br>Fall 1980, pg. 7<br>At the very least, you'd expect Rapoport to cite Xenharmonic<br>Bulletin 5, 1975, by Ivor Darreg (the crucial bulletin in<br>which Ivor first wrote about the "moods" or "sounds" or<br>"sonic fingerprints" of each of the equal temperaments),<br>or Xenharmonic Bulletin 10, 1988, in which Ivor wrote<br>an exhaustive commentary on the advantages & disadvantages<br>of most of the tunings between 5t and 53 tones per octave.<br>--<br>And Paul Rapoport cites *not one single reference* by<br>Ivor Darreg.  This is beyond belief.  It's like writing an<br>article about visual art without mentioning painting.<br>It's incomprehensible.<br>And guess what?<br>It gets *worse*.<br>--<br>The veritable library of xenharmonic source<br>materials Paul Rapoport *should* have<br>cited and *didn't* include:<br>Joseph Wu"rschmidt, "Die Rationellen Tonsysteme<br>in Quinten-Terzengewebe," Zeitschrift fu"r Physik,<br>Vol. 2, 1920, pg. 89 (The first systematic discussion of<br>the very subject of Paul's article!--Equal temperaments<br>characterized by the "web of thirds and fifths.")<br>R.H.M.

"Circles<br>of Fifths," Xenharmonikon 15, Autumn 1993; McLaren, B.<br>"The Microtonal Notation Mess," Unpublished manscuript,<br>1989.<br>So let's count up the total number of sources cited in<br>Paul Rapoport's so-called "bibliography:" the grand total<br>is 9.<br>Yes, count 'em...9.<br>Now let's count up the total number that *weren't* cited<br>but *should have been.*<br>THAT total comes to 67.<br>Let me repeat that: Paul Rapoport should have cited sixty-seven<br>more references than he did.<br>Predictably, Paul Rapoport will claim that "he didn't have time"<br>to do a full biblio.  This is obviously false, since many of us<br>would have rapidly and efficently supplied the references to<br>him if he'd sent us a pre-print of the article.  <br>Again, predictably, Paul Rapoport will claim that the Journal<br>of Music Theory doesn't allow extensive bibliographies.  This<br>is provably incorrect, since many articles (viz., Lindley,<br>"Mersenne on Keyboard Tunings," 1980, etc.) cite lists of<br>bibliographic sources many pages in length.<br>Moreover, no journal ever turned down a music theory article<br>because the biblio was too long.  That's nonsense.  It just<br>doesn't happen.  And even if did (which is preposterous), Paul<br>could simply stand by his guns and publish the article in a<br>journal will *does* allow extensive bibliographies--and <br>there are plenty of those.<br>No...the excuses don't wash. The only question now is whether<br>Paul Rapoport's bibliographies are so grossly inadequate because<br>(A) he just don't care, or (B) Paul deliberately wants to give<br>a false, inaccurate and slanted picture of microtonality to<br>his readers.<br>--<br>To call Paul's bibliography "incomplete" is like calling<br>what happened to the Titanic "a boating accident."  And to<br>call Paul's virtually nonexistent list of sources "adequate,"<br>as Paul presumably does, requires a capacity for fabulation<br>so hallucinatory as to make Terence McKenna balk.<br>---<br>Why does all this matter...?<br>It's well to remember the importance of bibliographies.<br>Bright-eyed students receive their first impetus & much of<br>their sense of direction for future study from a bibliography. <br>Control the biblio & to a large extent you control the students'<br>education. A bibliography is the message in a bottle which<br>a wise music theory author sends out to readers not yet<br>born: a good bibliography can start an entire career, revolutionize<br>an entire field of study.  Just think of Partch--turned on to <br>Helmholtz by a note in a bibliography.  Just think of the many <br>composers and theorists turned on to Partch's "Genesis Of A <br>Music" because of a mention in a bibliography.<br>Here's why this issue matters, ladies and gentlemen:<br>A crassly inadequate bibliography is tantamount to censorship.<br>It gouges out the eyes of the prospective student and punches<br>icepicks into hi/r ears.  An incomplete bibliography is a crime<br>against the future, a *savage chainsaw abortion* of nascent<br>microtonal composers while they're still in the womb.<br>Paul, don't you realize that people like Kami Rousseau and<br>Matthew Puzan read your bibliographies and search out the<br>references you cite?  By refusing to cite sources of basic<br>importance, you prevent these up-and-coming microtonalists<br>from discovering their heritage. You drive them into the arms<br>of the  likes of Paul Griffiths--who stated "If polytonality and<br>microtones offered limited extensions to musical possibility,<br>atonality opened vast new realms." [Griffiths, Paul, "A Concise<br>History of Avant Garde Music: from Debussy to Boulez," <br>New York & Toronto, Oxford University Press, 1978, pg. 40]<br>Ye gods!<br>Since post-Webern atonality is now dead as a <br>steamrollered cockroach, and microtonality is<br>continuing to gather steam as a world-wide trend...<br>wow!  Is it possible get any more  foolishly WRONG than <br>good old Paul  Griffiths???<br>And THIS guy (who, in a 1994 review, called  the superb composer<br>Ivan Vyshnegradsky "almost insane") is STILL the "new music <br>reviewer" for the New Yorker!!!<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 19 Jul 1996 18:26 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA05944; Fri, 19 Jul 1996 09:26:05 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 19 Jul 1996 09:26:05 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960719091504.27262B-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Part 2 of McLaren's Biblio Post</h1><h3><a id=3267 href="#3267">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/1996 9:21:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Paul Rapoport's grossly deficient bibliographies,<br> part 2 of 2<br>--<br>The last post exposed in detail the deceptive nature<br>of Paul Rapoport's inadequate bibliographies.

This is so<br>obviously the *opposite* of the truth that it beggars<br>description.<br>To continue:<br>Paul Rapoport cites Viggo Brun's 1961 article, presumably<br>because Brun defines the properties of various classes<br>of equal temperaments using continued fractions.  But Rapoport<br>*fails* to cite Brun's *english-language* article on the same<br>subject: <br>[1] Brun, Viggo,. "Euclidean Algorithms and music theory," <br>L'esnseignement Mathematique Revue Internationale, <br>tome X, fasc. 1-2, 1964, pp. 125-137.<br>And because Paul Rapoport *fails* to cite this vital<br>article, he *also* neglects to cite the *other* important<br>articles which characterize equal temperaments using<br>continued fraction methods, all cited in the bibliography of<br>Brun's english-language 1964 article:<br>[2] Brun, Viggo.

"Die Harmonielehre der Ptyahgoreer,"<br>Hermes, Vol. 78, pp. 163-199<br>And since Rapoport cites one of Brun's continued fraction<br>articles,  why doesn't  he cite James Murray Barbour's <br>article "Music and Ternary  Continued Fractions," American <br>Mathematical Monthly, LV, 1948, pg. 545?  <br>Brun himself cites the Barbour article in the biblio of his<br>(Brun's) 1964 article. <br>Barbour's article covers nearly exactly the same ground as <br>Brun's--and if Brun's article is necessary, why is not Barbour's<br>article also necessary?<br>On the subject of continued fractions, the article "Musical Scale<br>Construction: the Continued Fraction Compromise," Utilitas<br>Mathematica, Vol. 42, pp. 97-113, 1992, is an even more<br>important source.  Yet Paul Rapoport blatantly ignores it.<br>Why?  <br>Is there some good reason for doing so?<br>Moritz Drobisch's book "Uber Musikalische Tonbestimmung und<br>Temperatur," Leipzig, Widmannsche Buchhandlung, 1852,<br>covers much the same ground.  Yet Paul Rapoport *also* fails<br>to cite this work.<br>Jacques Dudon's "La gamme doree: Un temperament inegal<br>issue du nombre d'or," in the collection "Nombre d'or<br>et Musique," 1987, pp. 147-157,  uses similar continued<br>fraction methods of sieving scales to obtain results similar<br>to Douthett, Drobisch, Blackwood, Barbour, Fokker, Hall,<br>Kronerup, et al.  Yet Paul Rapoport *fails* to cite *this* <br>important source as well.<br>Speaking of Kornerup--<br>Thorwald Kornerup used exactly the same methods as<br>Barbour, Brun and Douthett to classify tuning systems<br>in 4 different articles: "Acoustic Valuation of Intervals,"<br>Thorwald Kornerup, Translated by Jean Ferguson, Copenhagen,<br>Aschehoug Forlag, 1934; "Von der Urform 5-Toniger Skalen zu<br>den Golden Tonen Elekstrischer Instrumente," Kopenhagen,<br>1931; "Kornerup, Throwald, "Die Hochteilung der Oktave,"<br>Kopenhagen, 1930; "Die Vorlaufer der gleichschwebende <br>Temperaturen mit 19 oder 31 Tonen in der Oktave," Translated<br>from Danish to German by P. Friedrich Paulsen, Copenhagen,<br>J. Joergensen, 1930.<br>Why did Paul Rapoport fail to cite *these* equally important<br>sources on classifying equal temperaments?<br>Scanning Paul's bibliography, we find yet another GROSS<br>oversight--Donald Hall's name does not appear.  Yet Hall<br>has written four *important* articles on the classification of<br>equal temperaments: <br>[1] Hall, Donald. "Acoustical Numerology and Lucky Equal <br>Temperaments," American Journal of Physics,  Vol. 56, 1985<br>[2] Hall, Donald. "Quantitative Evaluation of Musical Scale Tuning," <br>American Journal of Physics, Vol. 42, 1974. pp. 543-552<br>[3] Hall, Donald. "The Objective Measurement of Goodness-of-<br>Fit for Tunings and Temperaments," Journal of Music Theory,<br>Vol. 17, pp. 274-290, 1973<br>[4] Hall, Donald. "A Systematic Evaluation of Equal Tempermaents <br>Through N=612," Interface, Vol. 14, 1985, pp. 61-73<br> --<br>This is a *criminal* oversight, since it leads the unwary<br>reader to believe that Don Hall has nothing to say about<br>equal temperaments--when he in fact has a great deal<br>to say about 'em.<br>--<br>Since Paul Rapoport's article deals specifically with the notation<br>of equal temperaments, you'd expect that he'd cite other<br>basic texts on xenharmonic notation.  For example, Ivor Darreg's<br>Xenharmonic Bulletin No. 6, 1975, devoted *entirely* to<br>non-12 notation. <br>Or "Notation for Non-Twelve," Ivor Darreg, Interval, <br>Spring-Summer 1980, Vol. 1, pg. 12 "Notation For <br>Non-Twelve - part 2," Ivor Darreg, Interval,<br>Fall 1980, pg. 7<br>At the very least, you'd expect Rapoport to cite Xenharmonic<br>Bulletin 5, 1975, by Ivor Darreg (the crucial bulletin in<br>which Ivor first wrote about the "moods" or "sounds" or<br>"sonic fingerprints" of each of the equal temperaments),<br>or Xenharmonic Bulletin 10, 1988, in which Ivor wrote<br>an exhaustive commentary on the advantages & disadvantages<br>of most of the tunings between 5t and 53 tones per octave.<br>--<br>And Paul Rapoport cites *not one single reference* by<br>Ivor Darreg.  This is beyond belief.  It's like writing an<br>article about visual art without mentioning painting.<br>It's incomprehensible.<br>And guess what?<br>It gets *worse*.<br>--<br>The veritable library of xenharmonic source<br>materials Paul Rapoport *should* have<br>cited and *didn't* include:<br>Joseph Wu"rschmidt, "Die Rationellen Tonsysteme<br>in Quinten-Terzengewebe," Zeitschrift fu"r Physik,<br>Vol. 2, 1920, pg. 89 (The first systematic discussion of<br>the very subject of Paul's article!--Equal temperaments<br>characterized by the "web of thirds and fifths.")<br>R.H.M.

This is obviously false, since many of us<br>would have rapidly and efficently supplied the references to<br>him if he'd sent us a pre-print of the article.  <br>Again, predictably, Paul Rapoport will claim that the Journal<br>of Music Theory doesn't allow extensive bibliographies.  This<br>is provably incorrect, since many articles (viz., Lindley,<br>"Mersenne on Keyboard Tunings," 1980, etc.) cite lists of<br>bibliographic sources many pages in length.<br>Moreover, no journal ever turned down a music theory article<br>because the biblio was too long.  That's nonsense.  It just<br>doesn't happen.  And even if did (which is preposterous), Paul<br>could simply stand by his guns and publish the article in a<br>journal will *does* allow extensive bibliographies--and <br>there are plenty of those.<br>No...the excuses don't wash. The only question now is whether<br>Paul Rapoport's bibliographies are so grossly inadequate because<br>(A) he just don't care, or (B) Paul deliberately wants to give<br>a false, inaccurate and slanted picture of microtonality to<br>his readers.<br>--<br>To call Paul's bibliography "incomplete" is like calling<br>what happened to the Titanic "a boating accident."  And to<br>call Paul's virtually nonexistent list of sources "adequate,"<br>as Paul presumably does, requires a capacity for fabulation<br>so hallucinatory as to make Terence McKenna balk.<br>---<br>Why does all this matter...?<br>It's well to remember the importance of bibliographies.<br>Bright-eyed students receive their first impetus & much of<br>their sense of direction for future study from a bibliography. <br>Control the biblio & to a large extent you control the students'<br>education. A bibliography is the message in a bottle which<br>a wise music theory author sends out to readers not yet<br>born: a good bibliography can start an entire career, revolutionize<br>an entire field of study.  Just think of Partch--turned on to <br>Helmholtz by a note in a bibliography.  Just think of the many <br>composers and theorists turned on to Partch's "Genesis Of A <br>Music" because of a mention in a bibliography.<br>Here's why this issue matters, ladies and gentlemen:<br>A crassly inadequate bibliography is tantamount to censorship.<br>It gouges out the eyes of the prospective student and punches<br>icepicks into hi/r ears.  An incomplete bibliography is a crime<br>against the future, a *savage chainsaw abortion* of nascent<br>microtonal composers while they're still in the womb.<br>Paul, don't you realize that people like Kami Rousseau and<br>Matthew Puzan read your bibliographies and search out the<br>references you cite?  By refusing to cite sources of basic<br>importance, you prevent these up-and-coming microtonalists<br>from discovering their heritage. You drive them into the arms<br>of the  likes of Paul Griffiths--who stated "If polytonality and<br>microtones offered limited extensions to musical possibility,<br>atonality opened vast new realms." [Griffiths, Paul, "A Concise<br>History of Avant Garde Music: from Debussy to Boulez," <br>New York & Toronto, Oxford University Press, 1978, pg. 40]<br>Ye gods!<br>Since post-Webern atonality is now dead as a <br>steamrollered cockroach, and microtonality is<br>continuing to gather steam as a world-wide trend...<br>wow!  Is it possible get any more  foolishly WRONG than <br>good old Paul  Griffiths???<br>And THIS guy (who, in a 1994 review, called  the superb composer<br>Ivan Vyshnegradsky "almost insane") is STILL the "new music <br>reviewer" for the New Yorker!!!<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Fri, 19 Jul 1996 18:26 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id JAA05944; Fri, 19 Jul 1996 09:26:05 -0700<br>Date: Fri, 19 Jul 1996 09:26:05 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.91.960719091504.27262B-100000@delta1.deltanet.com><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
