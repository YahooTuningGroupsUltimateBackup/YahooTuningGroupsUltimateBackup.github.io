While I do not have<br>the scholarly background of a lot of the folks on the forum, I<br>nonetheless have a great curiosity to learn as much as possible about<br>subjects that interest me. Thus, I want to pose a few questions<br>regarding the great German, and hopefully some of you real smart types<br>out there will further my education by your answers. Here goes...<br>1. Since Bach called his great keyboard work "The Well Tempered<br>Clavichord" (or was it Clavier?), wouldn't that imply that it was<br>composed in well, not equal, temperament? Am I overlooking something<br>here? 2. Bach composed a number of works for lute, and was, I have read,<br>friends with the great lutenist Sylvius Leopold Weiss ( they supposedly<br>jammed together on one occasion)...I am supposing lutes were tuned in<br>equal temperament, since they had straight, not staggered, frets, and<br>I am thus assuming that Bach composed these works in equal<br>temperament...am I in the ballpark? 3. Bach composed a number of solo<br>violin and cello suites...since these were for unaccompanied<br>instruments, could the performers have used pure intervals when they<br>played them? Or, since some of the pieces had chords in them, which must<br>be next to impossible to finger on these instruments, were they meant to<br>be equal tempered as well? Would a performer back then ever mix<br>temperaments in a performance (of course, I mean in a solo work)?<br>    I get a feeling from Bach that he was a practical man, and that the<br>ideas he presented in his works were the most important issue, not the<br>execution, per se. In other words, the aforementioned solo violin pieces<br>are so difficult on violin (and so much more playable on guitar, for<br>example) that one wonders why he wrote them for this instrument in the<br>first place. Perhaps his inner world was so rich in musical voices that<br>he didn't really care about the medium on which these ideas were<br>expressed.<br>    Of course, we're all supposing, to one degree or another, just what<br>happened back then, but it is fun to speculate. I am looking forward to<br>some responses to my questions, so have at it...and don't forget to come<br>to Denver for the MICROSTOCK festival on October 21st...see you, Hstick<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 28 Sep 1995 11:22 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id CAA15350; Thu, 28 Sep 1995 02:22:39 -0700<br>Date: Thu, 28 Sep 1995 02:22:39 -0700<br>Message-Id: <0099711D0E0BF5FF.28CB@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>the Bach wars</h1><h3><a id=2064 href="#2064">ðŸ”—</a>neil.haverstick@csst.com (Neil Haverstick)</h3><span>9/27/1995 11:41:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Haverstick here...I must confess that I am greatly enjoying the<br>ongoing Bach debate...Bach is a personal favorite of mine, and I feel<br>that he is the greatest "western" composer to date.
