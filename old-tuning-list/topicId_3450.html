That is, some wolf-less tunings clearly give more consonance to the<br>more commonly played keys. The more foreign keys, while still playable,<br>have relatively more dissonant intervals. This gives pieces in foreign keys<br>a very different affect or mood that Baroque composers were often<br>preoccupied with.<br><br>However, there are other temperaments in which the "preference" for a<br>particular key is minor, and the comma is distributed more or less<br>symmetrically around the circle of fifths. Of course a precisely equal<br>distribution would be equal temperament, but I'm thinking here of Neidhardt<br>or Marpurg, whose temperaments, according to Barbour, "all keys are pretty<br>much alike, whether nearer to C major or F# major."<br><br>So, if your point is that a composer will write the same music whether the<br>temperament is 12TET or 12TET-like, I would have to add the above criterion<br>(symmetrical distribution of dissonance) to your two conditions on the<br>definition of 12TET-like. However, I think with that added condition it<br>applies much more to post-Baroque music than Baroque.

That is, some wolf-less tunings clearly give more consonance to the<br>more commonly played keys. The more foreign keys, while still playable,<br>have relatively more dissonant intervals. This gives pieces in foreign keys<br>a very different affect or mood that Baroque composers were often<br>preoccupied with.<br><br>However, there are other temperaments in which the "preference" for a<br>particular key is minor, and the comma is distributed more or less<br>symmetrically around the circle of fifths. Of course a precisely equal<br>distribution would be equal temperament, but I'm thinking here of Neidhardt<br>or Marpurg, whose temperaments, according to Barbour, "all keys are pretty<br>much alike, whether nearer to C major or F# major."<br><br>So, if your point is that a composer will write the same music whether the<br>temperament is 12TET or 12TET-like, I would have to add the above criterion<br>(symmetrical distribution of dissonance) to your two conditions on the<br>definition of 12TET-like.
