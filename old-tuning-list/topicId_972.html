Everything left though, he concluded, should have truly<br>fundamental effects.  My immediate response to that was, "why do you conclude<br>that there are no other fundamental effects associated with other primes other<br>than 2's duplication effect?  Why should we rule out the possibility that powers<br>of three or of five have a distinctive effects of their own?"  <br><br>   The second regard in which I can relate to your conclusion that other<br>intervals can have moderate duplicating effects, is with regard to my search in<br>88CET for pitch relationships that can function for note-doubling.  I described<br>my conclusions in my series on 88CET, but the short version is that that is - to<br>a large extent anyway - a matter of the doubling interval needing only to be<br>more "bland" than the other intervals.  For example in a comparatively<br>harmonically simple chord like a major triad, you can't get a doubling effect<br>from fifths.  Our ears perceive the result as a basically different harmony,<br>like a seventh or ninth chord.  But if you start with a more complex and intense<br>harmony, like a 7:9:11 chord, doubling a note by a much more easy-going,<br>simpler-sounding harmony like a fifth (or even a major tenth, perhaps<br>surprisingly) doesn't seem to have much effect on the overall character of the<br>chord.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 5 Oct 1996 20:25 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA14430; Sat, 5 Oct 1996 19:27:14 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA14426<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id LAA17123; Sat, 5 Oct 1996 11:27:12 -0700<br>Date: Sat, 5 Oct 1996 11:27:12 -0700<br>Message-Id: <961005182241_71670.2576_HHB44-6@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>To Gary, Paul E, Re: non-octave scales</h1><h3><a id=3729 href="#3729">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@CompuServe.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/5/1996 11:25:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> under certain strict conditions (in<br>> which the partial structure of the tones is more or less irrelevant),<br>> powers of 3 (and possibly of 5) do replicate the smilarity condition<br>> eliceted by powers of 2 in tonal or modal polyphony. <br><br>   Aha!
