Acrobat Reader is available free from<br>www.adobe.com and is available for most computer platforms.<br><br>JIN members who want to participate in this experiment should email me their<br>addresses at jinetwk@dnai.com (DO NOT RESPOND TO THE TUNING LIST). The files<br>may be sent as attachments to email or by placing them on a<br>password-protected directory on the JIN web site. If you have a preference<br>as to how to receive the files, be sure to include that information in your<br>message.<br><br>Note: there is no plan at this time to discontinue the print version of 1/1,<br>but net distribution would allow U.S. readers to receive the journal as much<br>as two months before it arrives via third class bulk mail. (1/1 would still<br>be mailed to all U.S. subscribers because a minimum mailing of 200 is<br>required to meet the bulk mailing requirements.) If net distribution is<br>successful, it might be possible to have a lower-priced net-only<br>subscription for subscribers outside the U.S. (international subscriptions<br>rates are high because of the cost of airmail).<br>==========================================================================<br>David B.
