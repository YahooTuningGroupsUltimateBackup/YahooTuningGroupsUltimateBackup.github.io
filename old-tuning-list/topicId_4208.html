What I meant was<br>that that tuning has eight good triads starting on Eb and <br>continuing by fifths through Bb, F, C, G, D, A, and E.  It has<br>eight good minor triads starting on C and continuing by<br>fifths through G, D, A, E, B, F#, and C#.  It has two quite<br>consonant seventh chords Eb G Bb C# and Bb D F G#.  The <br>just tuning scheme has just major triads on Eb, Bb, and F <br>and on G, D, and A.  It has just minor triads on G, D, and A <br>and on B, F#, and C#.
