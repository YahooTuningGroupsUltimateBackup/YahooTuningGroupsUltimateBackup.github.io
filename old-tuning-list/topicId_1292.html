This message is merely in response to a message asking<br>quiet subscribers such as myself to speak up. Well, I'm a high-school<br>student in Toronto with a rather expansive taste in music and a powerful<br>obsession for musical theory. What better a place to read up on the<br>avant-garde than here! Up until now, I've been quitly trying to take in<br>what information I can understand, and any relevant WWW links, live music<br>listings or discography that apply. But today I read this lengthy,<br>loquacious and rather hypocritical "essay" by Brian McLaren, and am<br>suddenly inspired to speak out against such self-justifying crap. Just a<br>few comments:<br>        Perhaps he should reread his words, and make sure that he doesn't<br>contradict himself. His commentary on Aristotle and authoritative<br>knowledge contradict his quoting of Aristotle and other authorities within his<br>writing.<br>        He lacks a sense of redundancy; he writes long essays whose length is<br>only justified by the repetition of his ideas over and over again.
