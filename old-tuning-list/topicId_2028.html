This is one of those subjects that never<br>seems to end.

However, individual musical ideas within such a paradigm are <br>>likely to employ simple sets of fixed pitches, ....<br><br>Brilliant analysis.  That's an issue I hadn't thought of at all, even though<br>I have experienced the repercussions of it.  It's by far the best reason I<br>have heard for pursuing ETs other than our beloved 12-tone.  But I've even<br>found a great deal of pleasure in simple JI scales, usually diatonic.  I<br>never try to play music composed for 12t-ET in a JI scale - I can't quite see<br>the point of that.  I usually just fiddle till I get the feel of it and know<br>a little about how each member functions, and then improvise.  Even with<br>7-note diatonic JI scales the results tend to be very much more satisfying<br>than with 12t-ET.  I'm convinced I'll be able to record some<br>commercially-viable material that way in the near future.  "JI - it's not<br>just for theorists anymore!"<br><br>>Just Intonation has no "puns", or notes <br>>taken in two different senses, and typical JI theory does not admit punning.<br>>...<br>>any single microtonal tuning will, by increasing pitch resources, <br>>lead to an unimaginable new universe of moods and sensations.<br><br>I think you may have rebutted yourself, there.  With all the unexplored<br>possibilities of various tuning systems, who needs puns?  Sure, they're<br>helpful for doing certain things.  So, do other things - whatever the<br>functions of the tuning at hand provide.  Easier said ... ;-)<br><br>>as long as the ET is _consistent_ within the particular <br>>harmonic limit you are trying to represent, _accurate_ enough to represent <br>>it, and does not have notes too close to each other (34 is just barely OK in<br><br>>this last respect), the dichotomy between consonance and dissonance is <br>>unambiguous and you have all the benefits of extended harmony enjoyed by JI <br>>of that harmonic limit (I speak of odd-, not prime-number, limits here).<br><br>A quick set of questions from my ignorance of standard terms: By "34 is just<br>barely OK", do you mean 34 cents?  If so are those 100ths of the x th-root,<br>where xof ET divisions of whatever interval; or are "cents" always the<br>1200th root of the octave?  Or perhaps you mean 34t-ET?<br><br>In any event, a very intriguing point and perspective.  However, while you do<br>enjoy the benefits of extended harmony, you still don't enjoy the benefits of<br>heart-stopping in-tune-ness.  The first time I played with a Phrygian JI<br>scale I had distilled from a series of<br>prime-number-series-numerator-over-power-of-two-denominator ratios (there's<br>probably a more concise and standard way to indicate that - hopefully you get<br>the drift) I had chills for a week.  I had the feeling that it was prompting<br>some sort of "life-force" to well up within me.  (Boy, that sound's weird,<br>but I can't think of a better way to describe it.)  It's still one of my<br>favorites.  I'm not very experienced with ETs other than 12t but, from what I<br>have heard and experimented with, you just can't get that same sort of primal<br>response to the music from an ET-derived scale.<br><br>The scale I referred to runs thusly: 1:1 (no kidding!), 17:16, 19:16, 4:3,<br>3:2, 51:32, 57:32.  I put the 57:32 on note #11 and add 7:4 on note #10 so I<br>can throw that shocker in where appropriate.  The note numbers refer to a 12t<br>keyboard.  I found that harp or other ringing plucked-string sounds tend to<br>draw a good vibe out of this scale.<br><br>>...some non-just tuning, <br>>perhaps even an ET, might be the best way to work out harmonizations and <br>>developments of a given idea.<br><br>True enough.  Depends on the idea.  If you start with some seed of a musical<br>scheme that guides you by its nature in the direction of an ET for its best<br>realization, great.  That seems a bit self-evident, though.  Am I missing<br>your point?  I don't suppose you're gonna help Marion make his previous point<br>by saying that most ideas are easier to work out in an ET?<br><br>In a #1063 posting, I explain in more detail there why I think JI scales are<br>more promising in the long run.<br><br>>Does the existing [12t-ET] repertoire have enough diversity to provide a <br>>lifetime of listening enjoyment of the most transcendent and sublime sort? <br><br>I'll never forget the state of mystical transport that I was in after hearing<br>a live performance of Brahm's Requiem when I was in school.  I was affected<br>similarly by performing, as part of a choir, Bach's Christmas Oratorio and<br>several pieces by Mendelssohn.  But I'm beginning to find that there is even<br>more power in music with "pure," resonant chords and scales.  It seems that<br>there is more potential there, and I believe that is because it reflects more<br>closely the way that we are made.<br><br>As to diversity - I'm torn there.  So many musicians seem to have given up on<br>the idea of harmonic originality, choosing the easier route of sonic shock<br>value (e.g., Nirvana).  But just when you think you've heard it all, some<br>genius comes up with a gem that was lying right in front of our eyes (or<br>ears) all the time.  (Jerry Rafferty's changes, simple as they were - mostly<br>triadic, still blow my mind.)  How much longer can that go on?  Hard to say.<br> But clearly, we can improve our chances with any system that expands our<br>choices.<br><br>Just tune it!<br><br>David J.

From my personal experience, I find it<br>more efficient for a beginner to concentrate on mastering (singing,<br>dictating, and tuning up) _intervals_, and then contructing collections of<br>pitches (among them tetrachords, hexachords, and proper scales) and only<br>then locating modes within the collections. I find too often that young<br>musicians focus on ''scales'' which are simply not directly relevant to a<br>lot of real musics. Most music that I know tends to focus locally on<br>collections smaller than scales (something I learned first by listening to<br>Stravinsky and Sibelius, but then reconfirmed in my ethnological work), and<br>music that makes even the most simple modulations will soon depart from the<br>limits of a single scale.  <br><br>(One caveat to the above: if the student is interested in learning a music<br>based upon a fixed drone pitch (as in Karnatic or Hindustani musics), then<br>one begins directly with the modes as fixed melodic types, each with fixed<br>ornamentation, and the abstract study of intervals is less relevant.)<br><br>In the west, the modal traditions are defined rather more coarsly than on<br>the Indian subcontinent, and modal melodic types are not fixed to<br>particular ornaments nor may they be assigned single intonations. Indeed,<br>the modes - like the genera of the classical tetrachords - are broadly<br>defined and invariant to specific tunings; and in polyphgonic settings may<br>indeed require a larger number of exact pitches. Perhaps it is most<br>efficient to retain a definition of the modes in terms of ''whole steps''<br>and ''half steps''?  From my experience it is centainly sufficient to limit<br>the practice to the four most common modes (dorian, phrygian, lydian, and<br>mixolydian), to focus on the tetrachords and hexachords from which they are<br>built, and precisely tuning the intervals within these smaller units. This<br>kind of practice should then also be sufficient for tonal repertoire as<br>well (by recombining the tetra- or hexachords). <br><br>Daniel Wolf<br>Frankfurt<br><br>DR DANIEL WOLF / MATERIAL PRESS / FRANKFURT AM MAIN<br>http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/DJWOLF_MATERIAL<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 20 May 1997 16:03 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06130; Tue, 20 May 1997 16:03:28 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 20 May 1997 16:03:28 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06128<br>Received: (qmail 216 invoked from network); 20 May 1997 14:03:18 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 20 May 1997 14:03:18 -0000<br>Message-Id: <97051922242521/0005695065PK5EM@mcimail.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5518 href="#5518">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Collins, Gordon&#x22; &#x3C;CollinG@f3groups3.fsd.jhuapl.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/1997 11:33:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Daniel Wolf wrote:<br><br>>Gordon Collins wrote:<br>><br>>''But the church modes have not been *used* in all that time, <br>>either as a basis for theory or as a basis for practical music.''<br>><br>>- a remark which I cannot follow at all, unless one wishes to limit ''music<br>>theory'' and ''practical music'' to what what happened in art music in<br>>German-speaking countries (and even there (here, I should say)), there is<br>>plenty of ''modal'' music to be found in both ''composed'' and folk<br>>traditions.<br><br>Well, if you take my comment out of the context of this thread, then it does <br>need qualification.

Composers learned with Fux<br>well into the nineteenth century (and again in the late twentieth century:<br>indeed, the fashionable Schenkerian training is fundamentally Fuxian), and<br>the further one gets from the German repertoire the more one is likely to<br>encounter ''modal'' practices.

If the example of contemporary vernacular idioms is at all<br>relevant, one may be easily persuaded that modulating, functional tonality<br>held a leading position for a limited time in only a select repertoire, and<br>the greater part of music heard has been modal since - as my great<br>grandfather put it - Hector was a pup.<br><br>You wrote:<br><br>''By the 18th century, the theorists had caught up with the composers...''<br><br>For an alternative reading of the relationship between composers and<br>theorists, the chapter on ''Professional Theorists and their Influence'' in<br>Milton Babbitt's _Words about Music_ is certainly worth a look. We tend<br>nowadays to place theorists and composers in fixed positions with regard to<br>one another, and this simply does not bear up historically. In considering<br>any single theorist, one must be very careful to distinguish the aims and<br>limits of his (sadly, not often _her_) work and the audience to which the<br>work is addressed. One must often pry deeply to decide if a theoretical<br>work is descriptive or prescriptive, or if it is historical or speculative.<br>And then one must evaluate the influence - if any - that a work has had on<br>real music making. The persistance of species, modal counterpoint as an<br>element of musical training well into eras when the fashionable idiom was<br>very different is, on one hand, a testament to the value of the training in<br>the development of general musicianship, but is perhaps an expression of<br>deeper structural connections among repertoires whose material surfaces are<br>radically different. This is a point that intonational theorists and<br>microtonal composers desperately need to consider in detail (and is<br>fundamentally connected to the constant plea by list members for better<br>compositions!): devising new musical materials - a tuning, for example - is<br>not difficult at all; devising ''interesting'' or ''effective'' or<br>''convincing'' or ''musical'' ways of using those materials is extremely<br>difficult.   <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 21 May 1997 22:40 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07148; Wed, 21 May 1997 22:40:07 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 21 May 1997 22:40:07 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07141<br>Received: (qmail 6304 invoked from network); 21 May 1997 20:40:03 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 21 May 1997 20:40:03 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01510100afa89b251782@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5520 href="#5520">ðŸ”—</a>alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)</h3><span>5/21/1997 1:40:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Daniel Wolf wrote:<br>>>Even if you intend to limit the definition of the church modes to their<br>>>treatment under species counterpoint, then you must account for the fact<br>>>that composing in various modes has been a continuous and central part of<br>>>musical training in the western classical tradition.<br>><br>Gordon Collins replied:<br>>By the 18th century, the theorists had caught up with the composers in<br>>accepting the consolidation of several modes into the major and minor keys.<br>>I don't see how you can claim that the church modes continued to be<br>>"central" to that music.

And as Dan points out, many<br>European folk songs are in diatonic modes other than major or minor.<br><br>I don't see why refering to major and minor as modes is misleading. In my<br>definition of modes in the European tradition, they include at least the<br>following defining characteristics:<br><br>1) A tuning system, though it may be somewhat flexible as long as the<br>general pattern of intervals (below) remains recognizable.<br><br>2) A subset of pitches from that tuning system, or, put another way, a<br>pattern of intervals. (In the European tradition this means the diatonic<br>set.)<br><br>3) A tonal center within that subset.<br><br>Given that there are seven pitches in the diatonic set, there are thus<br>seven possible diatonic modes, of which major and minor are only two. I<br>don't see how they are different than the other diatonic modes. (Well, the<br>existence of multiple "minor scales" is a rather arbitrary theoretical<br>construction that has more to do with harmony and counterpoint than modes<br>per se. I don't think the altered scale degrees fundamentally change the<br>impression of diatonicism -- see below.)<br><br>In other non-European (or earlier European) traditions, there are<br>theoretical pitch constructions that roughly correspond to "mode," but they<br>often involve further defining characteristics. Thus, you can either<br>jettison the term "mode" (as many do), or augment the definition with some<br>of these other defining characteristics:<br><br>4) A range.<br><br>5) Characteristic melodic motives.<br><br>6) Characteristic methods of ornamentation ("ornamentation" here defined<br>broadly).<br><br>7) A further hierarchy of pitches or other categorization of pitch<br>functionality.<br><br>8) Extramusical associations.<br><br>As long as we're on the subject:<br><br>Some modes have what I would call "auxiliary tones" (though they are not<br>usually part of what defines a mode as I see it). I think of them as tones<br>that lie outside of the pitch set that are used more or less as occasional<br>passing tones or temporary substitutes for notes in the pitch set for<br>various musical reasons (such as the sharpened leading tone in minor). I<br>sometimes compare the pitch sets of various modes using a shorthand<br>notation:<br><br>Number of pitches in the tuning system/number of pitches in the<br>subset/number of commonly used auxiliary tones.<br><br>(Note: I should qualify the below numbers with the statement that the<br>distinction between auxiliary tones and other pitch inflections is not<br>always clear, that when a pitch is within or outside of the pitch set is<br>likewise sometimes a subjective judgment, and that the use of modes<br>depends, of course, on the music itself, so understand that these are<br>generalizations.)<br><br>Thus traditional diatonic modes are:<br><br>12/7/0<br><br>Minor with sometimes a raised seventh or sixth scale degree:<br><br>12/7/2<br><br>Pelog patet:<br><br>7/5/1<br><br>Slendro patet (most of the time):<br><br>5/5/0<br><br>Chinese pentatonic modes (according to some theoretical sources):<br><br>12/5/2<br><br>Defining raga this way gets tricky, depending if you think of a 12 or 22<br>pitch tuning system and which tones are "auxiliary."

If the diatonic scale is in pythagorean intonation, there is<br>a convenient MOS at 12, but the number of pitches available through<br>modulations by fifths in either direction is potentially infinite. The<br>Javanese modes are similar in that the temperament of the metallophones<br>settles on 5 or 7 pitches (or pitch areas - as the instruments tend not to<br>be tuned to exact unison or octaves, which must affect the<br>''digestability'' (thank you, Klaerentz Barlough) of the temperament), but<br>this restriction need not be applied to voices and instruments of variable<br>pitch. I would classify the auxillary tones differently for the Javanese<br>modes as well with Slendro as 5/4/1 + 4 miring (in between) pitches. I hear<br>pelog as 7/5/0 with the use of pitches 3 and 4 in pelog nem/lima being<br>heard as real modulations and the gender bem (which has no key 4) being an<br>example of idiomatic instrumental realization and not a modal auxillary<br>pitch (there is something similar in Gagaku when the wind instruments play<br>''wrong'' pitches when the core melody contains a tone not available on the<br>instrument).

Interestingly, consecutive pieces in Karnatic recitals - or<br>between sections of a single Raga Malaka - often stand at one ''key<br>signature'' distance from one another thus reinforcing the ''12-ness'' of<br>the system, and some recitalists like to include one strategic disjunction<br>in the series (i.e. to a mode two or more accidentals away or to one that<br>doesn't correspond to a diatonic possibility). Thus you will often hear<br>Kalyani (with Ma #) next to Sankarabharanam (no sharps or flats). The<br>subject of the consecutive ragas in a program or within a Raga Malaka seems<br>not to have received any attention.

This made an intonationally interesting<br>effect however, in that three pitches were well defined as consonant to the<br>drone, and the remaining were defined by their melodic distance from these<br>pitches, not by their harmonic consonance or dissonance. <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 22 May 1997 15:42 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07733; Thu, 22 May 1997 15:42:27 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 22 May 1997 15:42:27 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07738<br>Received: (qmail 21150 invoked from network); 22 May 1997 13:42:23 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 22 May 1997 13:42:23 -0000<br>Message-Id: <97052121352506/0005695065PK2EM@mcimail.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>RE: Why x-ET?</h1><h3><a id=5433 href="#5433">ðŸ”—</a>DFinnamore@aol.com</h3><span>5/9/1997 12:07:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>David, Let's discuss more if you like this topic as much as I.<br><br>Thanks for the invitation, Paul!

From my personal experience, I find it<br>more efficient for a beginner to concentrate on mastering (singing,<br>dictating, and tuning up) _intervals_, and then contructing collections of<br>pitches (among them tetrachords, hexachords, and proper scales) and only<br>then locating modes within the collections. I find too often that young<br>musicians focus on ''scales'' which are simply not directly relevant to a<br>lot of real musics. Most music that I know tends to focus locally on<br>collections smaller than scales (something I learned first by listening to<br>Stravinsky and Sibelius, but then reconfirmed in my ethnological work), and<br>music that makes even the most simple modulations will soon depart from the<br>limits of a single scale.  <br><br>(One caveat to the above: if the student is interested in learning a music<br>based upon a fixed drone pitch (as in Karnatic or Hindustani musics), then<br>one begins directly with the modes as fixed melodic types, each with fixed<br>ornamentation, and the abstract study of intervals is less relevant.)<br><br>In the west, the modal traditions are defined rather more coarsly than on<br>the Indian subcontinent, and modal melodic types are not fixed to<br>particular ornaments nor may they be assigned single intonations. Indeed,<br>the modes - like the genera of the classical tetrachords - are broadly<br>defined and invariant to specific tunings; and in polyphgonic settings may<br>indeed require a larger number of exact pitches. Perhaps it is most<br>efficient to retain a definition of the modes in terms of ''whole steps''<br>and ''half steps''?  From my experience it is centainly sufficient to limit<br>the practice to the four most common modes (dorian, phrygian, lydian, and<br>mixolydian), to focus on the tetrachords and hexachords from which they are<br>built, and precisely tuning the intervals within these smaller units. This<br>kind of practice should then also be sufficient for tonal repertoire as<br>well (by recombining the tetra- or hexachords). <br><br>Daniel Wolf<br>Frankfurt<br><br>DR DANIEL WOLF / MATERIAL PRESS / FRANKFURT AM MAIN<br>http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/DJWOLF_MATERIAL<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 20 May 1997 16:03 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA06130; Tue, 20 May 1997 16:03:28 +0200<br>Date: Tue, 20 May 1997 16:03:28 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA06128<br>Received: (qmail 216 invoked from network); 20 May 1997 14:03:18 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 20 May 1997 14:03:18 -0000<br>Message-Id: <97051922242521/0005695065PK5EM@mcimail.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5518 href="#5518">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Collins, Gordon&#x22; &#x3C;CollinG@f3groups3.fsd.jhuapl.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/1997 11:33:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Daniel Wolf wrote:<br><br>>Gordon Collins wrote:<br>><br>>''But the church modes have not been *used* in all that time, <br>>either as a basis for theory or as a basis for practical music.''<br>><br>>- a remark which I cannot follow at all, unless one wishes to limit ''music<br>>theory'' and ''practical music'' to what what happened in art music in<br>>German-speaking countries (and even there (here, I should say)), there is<br>>plenty of ''modal'' music to be found in both ''composed'' and folk<br>>traditions.<br><br>Well, if you take my comment out of the context of this thread, then it does <br>need qualification.

Composers learned with Fux<br>well into the nineteenth century (and again in the late twentieth century:<br>indeed, the fashionable Schenkerian training is fundamentally Fuxian), and<br>the further one gets from the German repertoire the more one is likely to<br>encounter ''modal'' practices. You'll find plenty of examples in French,<br>English, Spanish, Northern, and Eastern European art musics, and Schumann -<br>to go to the center of the German tonal repertoire was extremely fond of<br>modal writing. (I don't know quite what to say about the German chorale<br>tradition where old, distinctively modal melodies are harmonized tonally -<br>this is still a standard exercise for music students). Above and beyond<br>this, the folk repertoires tend to be either only exceptionally or<br>nominally tonal! If the example of contemporary vernacular idioms is at all<br>relevant, one may be easily persuaded that modulating, functional tonality<br>held a leading position for a limited time in only a select repertoire, and<br>the greater part of music heard has been modal since - as my great<br>grandfather put it - Hector was a pup.<br><br>You wrote:<br><br>''By the 18th century, the theorists had caught up with the composers...''<br><br>For an alternative reading of the relationship between composers and<br>theorists, the chapter on ''Professional Theorists and their Influence'' in<br>Milton Babbitt's _Words about Music_ is certainly worth a look. We tend<br>nowadays to place theorists and composers in fixed positions with regard to<br>one another, and this simply does not bear up historically. In considering<br>any single theorist, one must be very careful to distinguish the aims and<br>limits of his (sadly, not often _her_) work and the audience to which the<br>work is addressed. One must often pry deeply to decide if a theoretical<br>work is descriptive or prescriptive, or if it is historical or speculative.<br>And then one must evaluate the influence - if any - that a work has had on<br>real music making. The persistance of species, modal counterpoint as an<br>element of musical training well into eras when the fashionable idiom was<br>very different is, on one hand, a testament to the value of the training in<br>the development of general musicianship, but is perhaps an expression of<br>deeper structural connections among repertoires whose material surfaces are<br>radically different. This is a point that intonational theorists and<br>microtonal composers desperately need to consider in detail (and is<br>fundamentally connected to the constant plea by list members for better<br>compositions!): devising new musical materials - a tuning, for example - is<br>not difficult at all; devising ''interesting'' or ''effective'' or<br>''convincing'' or ''musical'' ways of using those materials is extremely<br>difficult.   <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 21 May 1997 22:40 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07148; Wed, 21 May 1997 22:40:07 +0200<br>Date: Wed, 21 May 1997 22:40:07 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07141<br>Received: (qmail 6304 invoked from network); 21 May 1997 20:40:03 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 21 May 1997 20:40:03 -0000<br>Message-Id: <v01510100afa89b251782@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5520 href="#5520">ðŸ”—</a>alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)</h3><span>5/21/1997 1:40:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Daniel Wolf wrote:<br>>>Even if you intend to limit the definition of the church modes to their<br>>>treatment under species counterpoint, then you must account for the fact<br>>>that composing in various modes has been a continuous and central part of<br>>>musical training in the western classical tradition.<br>><br>Gordon Collins replied:<br>>By the 18th century, the theorists had caught up with the composers in<br>>accepting the consolidation of several modes into the major and minor keys.<br>>I don't see how you can claim that the church modes continued to be<br>>"central" to that music.

And as Dan points out, many<br>European folk songs are in diatonic modes other than major or minor.<br><br>I don't see why refering to major and minor as modes is misleading. In my<br>definition of modes in the European tradition, they include at least the<br>following defining characteristics:<br><br>1) A tuning system, though it may be somewhat flexible as long as the<br>general pattern of intervals (below) remains recognizable.<br><br>2) A subset of pitches from that tuning system, or, put another way, a<br>pattern of intervals.

I<br>don't see how they are different than the other diatonic modes. (Well, the<br>existence of multiple "minor scales" is a rather arbitrary theoretical<br>construction that has more to do with harmony and counterpoint than modes<br>per se. I don't think the altered scale degrees fundamentally change the<br>impression of diatonicism -- see below.)<br><br>In other non-European (or earlier European) traditions, there are<br>theoretical pitch constructions that roughly correspond to "mode," but they<br>often involve further defining characteristics. Thus, you can either<br>jettison the term "mode" (as many do), or augment the definition with some<br>of these other defining characteristics:<br><br>4) A range.<br><br>5) Characteristic melodic motives.<br><br>6) Characteristic methods of ornamentation ("ornamentation" here defined<br>broadly).<br><br>7) A further hierarchy of pitches or other categorization of pitch<br>functionality.<br><br>8) Extramusical associations.<br><br>As long as we're on the subject:<br><br>Some modes have what I would call "auxiliary tones" (though they are not<br>usually part of what defines a mode as I see it). I think of them as tones<br>that lie outside of the pitch set that are used more or less as occasional<br>passing tones or temporary substitutes for notes in the pitch set for<br>various musical reasons (such as the sharpened leading tone in minor). I<br>sometimes compare the pitch sets of various modes using a shorthand<br>notation:<br><br>Number of pitches in the tuning system/number of pitches in the<br>subset/number of commonly used auxiliary tones.<br><br>(Note: I should qualify the below numbers with the statement that the<br>distinction between auxiliary tones and other pitch inflections is not<br>always clear, that when a pitch is within or outside of the pitch set is<br>likewise sometimes a subjective judgment, and that the use of modes<br>depends, of course, on the music itself, so understand that these are<br>generalizations.)<br><br>Thus traditional diatonic modes are:<br><br>12/7/0<br><br>Minor with sometimes a raised seventh or sixth scale degree:<br><br>12/7/2<br><br>Pelog patet:<br><br>7/5/1<br><br>Slendro patet (most of the time):<br><br>5/5/0<br><br>Chinese pentatonic modes (according to some theoretical sources):<br><br>12/5/2<br><br>Defining raga this way gets tricky, depending if you think of a 12 or 22<br>pitch tuning system and which tones are "auxiliary."

Interestingly, consecutive pieces in Karnatic recitals - or<br>between sections of a single Raga Malaka - often stand at one ''key<br>signature'' distance from one another thus reinforcing the ''12-ness'' of<br>the system, and some recitalists like to include one strategic disjunction<br>in the series (i.e. to a mode two or more accidentals away or to one that<br>doesn't correspond to a diatonic possibility). Thus you will often hear<br>Kalyani (with Ma #) next to Sankarabharanam (no sharps or flats). The<br>subject of the consecutive ragas in a program or within a Raga Malaka seems<br>not to have received any attention.

In fact, however, I found it fairly<br>easy to sing because the ''difficult pitches'' were all neighbors of tones<br>in a major triad, which is easy to sing against a drone, and all of the<br>gamakas (ornaments) reflected this. This made an intonationally interesting<br>effect however, in that three pitches were well defined as consonant to the<br>drone, and the remaining were defined by their melodic distance from these<br>pitches, not by their harmonic consonance or dissonance. <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 22 May 1997 15:42 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07733; Thu, 22 May 1997 15:42:27 +0200<br>Date: Thu, 22 May 1997 15:42:27 +0200<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07738<br>Received: (qmail 21150 invoked from network); 22 May 1997 13:42:23 -0000<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 22 May 1997 13:42:23 -0000<br>Message-Id: <97052121352506/0005695065PK2EM@mcimail.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
