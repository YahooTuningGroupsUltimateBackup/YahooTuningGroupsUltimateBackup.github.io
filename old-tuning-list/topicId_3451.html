It's consistent to the 9-limit, so it ought to be okay for<br>some septimal harmony, yes?  Let's take a 4:5:6:7 tetrad and move to<br>another 4:5:6:7 tetrad so that the 6 of the first tetrad becomes the 7<br>of the second.  If we voice everything so that all voices move as little<br>as possible, the 7 of the first moves down by a 64/63, the 6 holds, the<br>5 moves up by a 36/35, and the 4 moves up by a 15/14.
