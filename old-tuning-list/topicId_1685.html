He spent many years<br>in India - 1939-1955, something like that. He and his friend had the<br>most Hindu of the palaces along the Ganges in Benares, so the Indian<br>government would bring guests there to give them a flavor of authentic<br>India. So he tells the story, anyway.<br><br>There's a great musical story. He built some kind of instrument for<br>experimenting with alternative tuning systems, something like that. This was<br>in WW2. The British sent some secret agents over to investigate, they were<br>worried that the thing was a spy contraption of some kind. <br><br>Danielou wrote another book about music - it's not listed in the Inner<br>Traditions publication, but I saw the book in MIT's library. It was some kind<br>of examination of the social and political forces making it difficult for<br>traditional music and traditional non-tempered tuning systems to survive. For<br>example the introduction of the harmonium to India by the British screwed<br>things up. Sorry I forget the title of this book.<br><br>After Danielou returned to Europe he ran the UNESCO program of recording<br>traditional music from around the world. I remember seeing those LP's years<br>ago. Never bought any. Now I regret it! It would be great to see those<br>recordings made available again. Maybe if the US pays its dues? Of course<br>they'll probably require dissolution of UNESCO before they (we) pay. <br><br>The Labyrinth of the autobiography's title has to do with Marsilio Ficino's<br>Academy, a seed of the Renaissance. Danielou ended up living on the site of<br>Ficino's academy. Thomas Moore's THE PLANETS WITHIN: THE ASTROLOGICAL<br>PSYCHOLOGY OF MARSILIO FICINO has a chapter on Music of the Soul: The Well<br>Tempered Life. I think the folks on this mailing list would quickly set him<br>straight about his choice for a chapter title!<br><br>Rene Guenon was perhaps the greatest advocate of "traditional wisdom" in this<br>century. He doesn't seem to take a musical perspective, however. <br><br>Another curious advocate of traditional musical wisdom is Marco Pallis. His<br>PEAKS AND LAMAS is a delightful travelogue. He trapeses around the Himalayas,<br>perhaps this was in the 1950's, I'm not sure. But he & his buddies hauled<br>around their fiddles and put on concerts of old English music for the<br>villagers. What a scene! I have one LP, ENGLISH CONSORT OF VIOLS, on<br>Turnabout  - the notes on the back are signed by Marco Pallis, I imagine he <br>also performs but it doesn't seem to say. Anyway I love to play the record<br>and imagine some high mountain village, all the families gathered to hear the<br>wild foreigners and their music.<br><br>Jim Kukula<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 18 Feb 1997 12:49 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA10425; Tue, 18 Feb 1997 12:49:07 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA10427<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id DAA17825; Tue, 18 Feb 1997 03:46:51 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 18 Feb 1997 03:46:51 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.91.970218113935.22082B-100000@kali><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Danielou</h1><h3><a id=4822 href="#4822">ðŸ”—</a>James Kukula &#x3C;kukula@synopsys.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/1997 10:54:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>For those who have enjoyed Alain Danielou's MUSIC AND THE POWER OF SOUND, I'd<br>recommend his autobiographical THE WAY TO THE LABYRINTH.
