If we want to look at the full chord, Kami's is a <br>21-limit utonality or 21-limit otonality, which I agree is more complex than <br>the 12:15:18:20, which is only a 15-limit utonality or otonality.<br><br>But psychoacoustically, and this should be evident to a listener, these <br>chords are no more dissonant that a 9-limit utonality.

The common overtone is there but doesn't make the <br>chord more consonant. Once again, I don't believe in dualism. So even though <br>the 6th chords above may seem to demand explanation in terms of the 15- and <br>21-limit, I would say, if you admit utonalities at all, then both those <br>chords are 9-limit chords, no higher.<br><br>I wonder if there are any 7-limit analogues to these chords (i.e., chords in <br>which each interval is within the 7-limit but the chord as a whole is in a <br>higher limit).
