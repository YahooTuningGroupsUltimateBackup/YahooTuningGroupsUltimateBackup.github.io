They are not independent intervals. So what? Yes, optimizing on 3/2 <br>and 5/4 guarantees a pretty good 5/3. But optimizing on 3/2 and 6/5 <br>guarantees a pretty good 5/4. However, these optimizations lead to different <br>tunings, neither of which is as optimal (under our assumption) as using all <br>three. Who cares about independence?<br><br>John, under your optimization, the tuning of 6/5 (cents(3/2)-cents(5/4)) is <br>as important as that of 15/8 (cents(3/2)+cents(5/4)). I would argue that the <br>tuning of the 15/8 is unimportant, while the tuning of the 6/5 is very <br>important. At the very least, 6/5 should be included in the optimization <br>with a smaller weight than 3/2 and 5/4, but I prefer to give it full weight.<br><br>>In triads, one has both a major third and a minor third and<br>>adjusting either the fifth or the major third adjusts the minor third<br>>as well. There are only two degrees of freedom, not three, which reduces<br>>to one in meantone-like tunings or their positive analogs.<br><br>This is what made it possible to make this a one-dimensional minimization <br>problem.

See below.<br><br>>We were both talking about<br>>meantone-like tunings which form their major thirds as 4 fifths up,<br>>their major sixths as 3 fifths up and their minor thirds as the difference<br>>between the fifth and the major third, which is equivalent to taking<br>>the minor third as 3 fifths down. If the fifth is greater than 700 cents,<br>>these relations no longer hold in any meaningful sense.<br><br>True, but the original objective ("consonance") function is expressed <br>independently of these relations. In the space of meantone tunings, these <br>relations can be used to make the problem into a one-dimensional problem. <br>But in general, it can only be reduced to a two-dimensional problem, since, <br>as you point out, there are two independent intervals (any two can be chosen <br>without affecting the result.) For example, would you not agree that just <br>intonation gives better triads than any meantone tuning?<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Thu, 6 Mar 1997 00:28 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA07198; Thu, 6 Mar 1997 00:28:32 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA07230<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id PAA11634; Wed, 5 Mar 1997 15:23:34 -0800<br>Date: Wed, 5 Mar 1997 15:23:34 -0800<br>Message-Id: <009B0D4425FA3EA0.6234@vbv40.ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Reply to John Chalmers/Lst Sqr Tun (Paul E)</h1><h3><a id=4997 href="#4997">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)</h3><span>3/5/1997 3:25:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com><br><br>>My Variant of Paul's 696.0743748037858<br>>TF(6*F+40*T+30*MS+110*OCT)/256<br><br>Could you explain how this is derived?
