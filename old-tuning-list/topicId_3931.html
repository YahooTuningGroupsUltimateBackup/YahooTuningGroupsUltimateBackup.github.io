We shall also encounter an even smaller quantity<br>for which I tentatively propose the name of "Artusi's scintilla," if<br>it doesn't already have a name familiar to a specialist in<br>nomenclature such as Manuel Op de Coul.<br><br>At the outset, please let me caution that this tuning may be more fun<br>as a thought experiment than as a scheme to implement on a harpsichord<br>or the like, due to the very large number of just intervals which<br>would have to be tuned with requisite precision.<br><br>Also, while I'm not sure if the complete 5-limit scale given below has<br>been published, once one is familiar with the concept of a "schisma<br>fifth" (described by Owen Jorgensen, for example), the rest of the<br>scheme is easy to formulate -- although not necessarily to tune on an<br>actual instrument.<br><br><br>-----------------------------<br>1. The solution in a nutshell<br>-----------------------------<br><br>To devise a just 5-limit tuning that divides the octave into 12<br>_virtually_ equal parts, we need only two just intervals as basic<br>ingredients. The first is the Pythagorean schisma major third<br>(8192:6561, about 384.36 cents) derived from a chain of eight pure<br>fourths up or fifths down. This 3-limit interval is smaller than a<br>pure major third (5:4, about 386.31 cents) by precisely a schisma<br>(32805:32768, about 1.95 cents).<br><br>Our second interval is a 5-limit minor third (6:5, about 315.64<br>cents).<br><br>When combined, these intervals generate a "schisma fifth" of<br>16384:10935 -- about 700.00128 cents. For the slight discrepancy of<br>some 0.00128 cents between this fifth and a true 700 cents, I propose<br>the term "scintilla of Artusi" -- a scintilla, possibly a new category<br>in tuning theory, being somewhat smaller than a typical comma or<br>schisma.<br><br>Using this schisma fifth as a generating interval, we can achieve an<br>_almost_ closed chain of 12 such fifths which will produce a<br>_virtually_ pure octave. The slight variance of this octave from a<br>true 2:1 -- the proposed "Wilsonian comma" -- is equal to an interval<br>of <br><br>        2923003274661805836407369665432566039311865085952:<br>        2922977339492680612451840826835216578535400390625<br><br>or approximately 0.015361 cents -- just 12 times the size of Artusi's<br>scintilla, of course.[2]<br><br><br>-----------------------<br>2. Intervals and ratios<br>-----------------------<br><br>Here are the intervals for this 5-limit just tuning, listed in the<br>order they arise from a chain of 12 fifths. Note that in a 12-note as<br>opposed to open spiral tuning, where octaves are tuned to a pure 2:1,<br>our 12th fifth would be a Wilsonian comma narrow of 700 cents.<br><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Note  Interval                        Ratio/<br>                                     (Cents)      <br>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br> c     Unison                          1:1                  <br>                                    (0.000000)<br><br> g       5                         16384:10935            <br>                                   (700.001280)<br><br> d       M2                         134217728:<br>                                    119574225        <br>                                   (200.002560)<br><br> a       M6                       2199023255552:<br>                                  1307544150375<br>                                   (900.003840)<br>                               <br> e       M3                     18014398509481984:<br>                                14297995284350625<br>                                   (400.005120)<br> <br> b       M7                    295147905179352825856:<br>                               156348578434374084375<br>                                   (1100.006400)<br><br> f#     A4/d5                2417851639229258349412352:<br>                             1709671705179880612640625<br>                                    (600.007680)<br> <br> c#     A1/m2               19807040628566084398385987584:<br>                           18695260096141994499225234375<br>                                    (100.008961)<br><br> g#     A5/m6             324518553658426726783156020576256:<br>                         204432669151312709849027937890625              <br>                                    (800.010241)<br><br> d#     A2/m3           2658455991569831745807614120560689152:<br>                        2235471237169604482199120500833984375<br>                                    (300.011521)<br><br> a#     A6/m7         43556142965880123323311949751266331066368:<br>                      24444877978449625012847382676619619140625<br>                                   (1000.012801)<br> <br> e#     A3/4        356811923176489970264571492362373784095686656:<br>                    267304740694346649515486129568835535302734375<br>                                    (500.014081)<br> <br> b#      8        5846006549323611672814739330865132078623730171904:<br>                  2922977339492680612451840826835216578535400390625<br>                                   (1200.015361)<br>_____________________________________________________________________<br><br><br>Maybe these intervals, like the Pythagorean schisma third of 8192:6561<br>which plays a vital role in making this tuning possible, suggest a new<br>trend for just intonation in the 21st century: "Large integer ratios<br>are beautiful."[3]<br><br><br>                             ----------<br>                                Notes<br>                             ----------<br><br>1. See Mark Lindley, _Lutes, viols and temperaments_ (Cambridge:<br>Cambridge University Press, 1984), pp. 84-92, for a very witty account<br>of Artusi's intonational views expressed in the course of his<br>controversy with Claudio Monteverdi, including translations of some<br>choice passages. Artusi's demand that valid divisions of the tone for<br>voices be made "with known and specified rational numbers" (_con<br>certi, & determinati numeri rationali_) is quoted and translated at<br>pp. 91-92.<br><br>2. Artusi's scintilla may be formally defined as the difference<br>between a schisma (about 1.95372 cents) and 1/12 of a Pythagorean<br>comma (about 1.95500 cents, the amount by which fifths are narrowed in<br>12-tet).<br><br>3. While Pythagorean schisma thirds occur in Arabic and Persian as<br>well as medieval European theory and practice, our schisma fifth<br>scheme would require an amount of tuning calculated to make extended<br>Pythagorean tunings look simple. To derive _each_ of the 11 schisma<br>fifths in a 12-note scheme, we would need to tune a series of 8 pure<br>fifths defining a schisma M3 up or m6 down, plus a pure m3 up or M6<br>down. These alternatives would permit one to remain within a chosen<br>bearing octave such as c'-c''.<br><br><br>Most respectfully,<br><br>Margo Schulter<br>mschulter@value.net<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1511<br>*************************</div><h3><a id=8415 href="#8415">ðŸ”—</a>DFinnamore@aol.com</h3><span>8/27/1998 12:18:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Thanks to Margo Schulter for the paper in TD 1513!

See Mark Lindley, _Lutes, viols and temperaments_ (Cambridge:<br>Cambridge University Press, 1984), pp. 84-92, for a very witty account<br>of Artusi's intonational views expressed in the course of his<br>controversy with Claudio Monteverdi, including translations of some<br>choice passages. Artusi's demand that valid divisions of the tone for<br>voices be made "with known and specified rational numbers" (_con<br>certi, & determinati numeri rationali_) is quoted and translated at<br>pp. 91-92.<br><br>2. Artusi's scintilla may be formally defined as the difference<br>between a schisma (about 1.95372 cents) and 1/12 of a Pythagorean<br>comma (about 1.95500 cents, the amount by which fifths are narrowed in<br>12-tet).<br><br>3. While Pythagorean schisma thirds occur in Arabic and Persian as<br>well as medieval European theory and practice, our schisma fifth<br>scheme would require an amount of tuning calculated to make extended<br>Pythagorean tunings look simple. To derive _each_ of the 11 schisma<br>fifths in a 12-note scheme, we would need to tune a series of 8 pure<br>fifths defining a schisma M3 up or m6 down, plus a pure m3 up or M6<br>down. These alternatives would permit one to remain within a chosen<br>bearing octave such as c'-c''.<br><br><br>Most respectfully,<br><br>Margo Schulter<br>mschulter@value.net<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>End of TUNING Digest 1511<br>*************************</div><h3><a id=8415 href="#8415">ðŸ”—</a>DFinnamore@aol.com</h3><span>8/27/1998 12:18:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Thanks to Margo Schulter for the paper in TD 1513!  I found it thought<br>provoking and informative, especially the parts about regarding the consonance<br>of an interval as a point on a spectrum rather than a binary choice.<br><br>That's helped me make more sense of a set of 7-(prime)limit, 12-tone/2:1<br>tunings, the heptatonic subsets of which I've been exploring for use with what<br>might be thought of as neo-/Xeno-Medieval/Gothic/Rennaissance compositions<br>(for lack of more concise term :-).  Those tunings are built of five<br>alternating 21:20s and 15:14s, with two 256:243s sandwiched in here and there<br>to fill out the octave.  Note that 9:8 can be divided into 21:20 and 15:14.<br><br>Here's my 2-cents-worth on a few minor points from the paper:<br><br>>Thus while both 13th-century and 18th-century Western European music<br>>are harmonically oriented, they are "harmonic" in very different ways,<br>>differing in their historical tunings, stable and unstable interval<br>>categories, and directed cadences. Curiously, certain scales such as<br>>53-tet can provide an excellent fit with _either_ harmonic system.<br><br>That may not be as surprising as it seems.  I think that the more finely you<br>divide the octave, the more likely it is that you will have "an excellent fit"<br>with a set of relatively smaller (in terms of tones per octave) systems when<br>one system's  prime limit encompasses the other's, as in the case of Western<br>18th century 5-limit and 13th century Pythagorean.<br><br>>most complex prime number<br><br>Is it accepted practice to refer to primes as "complex"?  Aren't primes, by<br>definition, the simplest whole numbers?
