This is a bass-clarinet (concert) C# at about 139Hz.<br>2.  It is clearly not COMPLETELY periodic, despite the fact that the tone<br>    itself sounds almost completely unvarying.<br>3.  If you look at the heights of various peaks and troughs in the waves, you<br>    will see that they vary by now means randomly.  As the red, hand-drawn<br>    curve shows, there's a definite periodicity to the depth of the lowest<br>    trough.  That frequency does not seem to match the fundamental or any other<br>    harmonic present in the wave.  (This fact is easier to see when you zoom<br>    out on the wave a little more.)<br>4.  Since the entire wave does not move up and down with this curve, this can't<br>    be due to a subharmonic.  (Also, it was run through a subsonic filter before<br>    being drawn here, and this particular pitch is in the lowest register of<br>    the bass clarinet, so it subharmonics are inherently unlikely.)<br>5.  A slightly-detuned upper partial seems to be the only possible explanation<br>    for this sort of motion of that lower trough, as well as the other peaks<br>    and troughs.<br>6.  It is sampled at 44.1KHz, which works out to about 317 samples per cycle.<br>7.  It is displayed at about 3 1/2 samples per pixel.<br>8.  A Fourier analysis shows that the highest harmonic that is loud enough to<br>    have any chance of being visible on this display is the 38th, which has a<br>    frequency of about 5.3KHz.<br>9.  That 38th harmonic is represented by about 8 samples, so it should have<br>    no problem whatsoever being accurately represented here.<br>10. If you zoom in on the wave closer, you find that all of the various wiggles<br>    are accurately represented here.  None have been spacially aliased by<br>    insufficient display resolution, for example.<br>11. The troughs circled in green MAY reflect the peaks and troughs of a high<br>    harmonic walking through that particular slightly-lower-harmonic-dictated<br>    trough.  I'm not sure of that by any means though.</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Orchestral-Instrument Aperiodicity</h1><h3><a id=7543 href="#7543">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>4/24/1998 7:18:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Any of you folks who are interested in the discussion on slight<br>aperiodicities (i.e., not quite exact harmonic overtone structures) in the<br>tones of orchestral instruments might want to check out:<br><br>        http://lonestar.texas.net/~mr88cet/tuningStuff/BClarWave.GIF<br><br>(I hope that URL works;  I confess that I'm still a little new to web stuff.)<br><br>   Some things are notable considerations in or about this picture:<br>1.
