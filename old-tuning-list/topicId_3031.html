It suggests that if you've got a certain amount of<br>tempering to do, you should do it more on the low identities.<br><br>Yet the high identities rely on the low ones for context in music.  High<br>identities work in a tonality, and its the lower identities that play the<br>bigger role in establishing tonality.  That's idea B.  It's the cons to<br>tempering the lower identities more.

This seems quite a bit more elegant to me.  Truth be<br>told, elegant was what I was trying to avoid.  I said that I left out the<br>inversions to reveal structure in the scale.  Maybe this was misleading.  I<br>didn't pick the approximations as a scale.  I was just trying to show what<br>you might wind up hearing if you're not careful.<br><br>Carl<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  jpff@maths.bath.ac.uk<br>Subject:  Re: Our instruments<br>PostedDate:  11-01-98 20:14:36<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  11-01-98 20:14:11-11-01-98 20:14:12,11-01-98 20:14:02-11-01-98 20:14:02<br>DeliveredDate:  11-01-98 20:14:02<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C1256589.0069A6AE; Sun, 11 Jan 1998 20:14:28 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA26563; Sun, 11 Jan 1998 20:14:36 +0100<br>Date: Sun, 11 Jan 1998 20:14:36 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA26596<br>Received: (qmail 17668 invoked from network); 11 Jan 1998 11:14:34 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 11 Jan 1998 11:14:34 -0800<br>Message-Id: <E0xrSpX-0000x0-00@wallace.maths.bath.ac.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=7022 href="#7022">ðŸ”—</a>gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)</h3><span>1/13/1998 10:49:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Bob Lee wrote:<br><br>> I had always assumed that 7/5 was the natural ratio for an augmented fourth,<br>> and that 10/7 was the natural ratio for the diminished fifth.

The difference between 10/7 and<br>7/5 is only 35 cents.  7/5 is chosen as the augmented fourth<br>because it's the smaller.
