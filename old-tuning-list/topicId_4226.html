Some of these are quite interesting, rich and complex. <br>> <br>> MAN ON THE STREET: It's hard to escape the influence of [recent] history. <br>> Whether desirable or not, the truth is that most audiences and people in<br>> general interpret new experiences in terms of what they already know. <br>> <br>> Would you, as the composer, close up shop at this point and just write in<br>> 12tET?  How do you *know* that an audience (and we should all distrust<br>> this collective noun) is responding to the "triad-ness" of a piece, or its<br>> "12tET-ishness" or some other element?  When you come right down to it,<br>> why should you even draw an audience's attention to "microtonality" at<br>> all?  Should the audience care?  If so, why ... since historically(?) <br>> general(?) audiences(?) haven't had the foggiest idea about the<br>> intricacies or simplicities of the tuning they were hearing?<br>> <br>> Further, don't you unnecessarily pigeonhole yourselves when you have a<br>> "microtonal festival"? And don't such festivals confuse the audience (and<br>> worse, the critics who are always looking for convenient labels) into<br>> believing there is such a thing as "a microtonal composer" or a<br>> "microtonalist school"  when, as we've seen just on this list, there's a<br>> stunning variety of ways to compose with an astounding variety of<br>> microtonal pallettes?  (I'm playing devil's advocate in all of this, and<br>> would rather argue the other side -- but I think none of these questions<br>> is inconsequential.)<br>> <br>> Returning to the difficulties of trying to override historical (or any<br>> other kind) of prejudice, I'm reminded of the 19th(?) century astronomer,<br>> Maria Mitchell, who noted, "If the earth had waited for a precedent, it<br>> never would have turned on its axis." <br>> <br>> Steve Soderberg<br>> <br>> PS: Please don't any literalists who may be lurking out there think I'm<br>> anti-triadic! My response to my own question is that, in the context of<br>> the complexities of 20th century music, it's a matter of texture.  In<br>> fact, one of the interesting things about the particular pentachords<br>> generated with the Erlich string that I noted in an earlier post is that<br>> they can be broken into third-order maximally even triads.  Thus, the<br>> pentachords can be viewed as forming an architechtonic layer BETWEEN the<br>> scale and the triads... an interesting "composing out" possibility for<br>> mega scale structures such as this.<br>></div>
