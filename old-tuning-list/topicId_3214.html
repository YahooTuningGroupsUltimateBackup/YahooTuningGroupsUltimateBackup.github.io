He built the harpsichord used in the performance.  This<br>instrument has a resonant, crystalline sound.  There is another in the<br>room which functioned as the lobby, which has a unique shape great for a<br>small space.  The audience numbered about 55 people.<br><br>The atmosphere intended was more of a party than a concert.  It was<br>wonderful to have great performances by talented musicians in such a<br>casual and informal setting.  It's the first time I've ever sat through a<br>four-hour concert without dozing off.  And that it was free speaks to the<br>devotion these people have to their art (the musicians were paid).<br><br>It must be stated from the outset that *these* ears were listening<br>especially for intonational accuracy.  Before anyone's performance is<br>critiqued, let it be said that everyone involved deserves much applause<br>for their effort and ability in providing such a delightful (and<br>delightfully *long*) evening of musical enjoyment free of charge. <br>(Donations were encouraged, and well deserved.) <br><br>Johnny Reinhard, well known among "tuning people" as director of the<br>American Festival of Microtonal Music (each spring in New York) and<br>tireless champion for the causes of correct intonation and of what he<br>calls polymicrotonality - that is, an unbridled willingness to experiment<br>with various different tunings (sometimes all in the same piece), acted<br>as tuning consultant and also played bassoon in the orchestra.<br><br>Although tunings (especially temperaments) are usually calculated<br>starting from C, there was no standard reference frequency in use at the<br>time these pieces were composed -- Ellis' Appendix to Helmholtz' "On the<br>Sensations of Tone" lists standard frequencies for A in these countries<br>at that time ranging from  376 Hz to 455 Hz.  So Reinhard's solution was<br>to tune to A=440 Hz (our modern standard reference frequency), and<br>calculate the Werckmeister temperament from A.  He described it by saying<br>that F# is tuned a 12-equal "minor third" (300 cents) down from A, and<br>every other note is from 2 to 12 cents sharper than 12-equal, C being the<br>sharpest.<br><br>Overall, the Werckmeister III tuning gave the music a sweetness and<br>softness it wouldn't have had in the usual 12-equal tuning.  It was<br>beautifully appropriate for these virtually unknown, and so joyously<br>resuscitated, Baroque selections.  Please -- let us hear all of Bach's<br>glorious music in its proper tuning! (The rendition of "Ei, Wie der<br>Kaffee ist Susse" from Bach's "Coffee Cantata" done at last year's AFMM<br>"Jewel" concert by Meredith Borden, Andrew Bolotowsky -- two of tonight's<br>performers -- and Rebecca Pechefsky, was a knockout!)<br><br>The first opera presented was indeed written when Mozart was a 9-year-old<br>(1765), and each subsequent opera was written earlier than the one<br>before, the last one dating from 1710.  Elaine Comparone led the ensemble<br>from the harpsichord more than ably.<br><br>The opening selections came from "Tom Jones" by Francois Andre'Dancian<br>Philidor.  After a lively Overture came a male trio singing a hunting<br>song, then a "Drinking Quartet" which was a capella.  Aaron James<br>displayed a beautiful voice with a full, round tone, typical operatic<br>vibrato, and not particular sensitivity to the tuning, although he did a<br>decent job.  Oreen Zeitlein also projected well.  <br><br>The slow movement of the "Sinfonia" from Tommaso Traetta's "Ippolito ed<br>Aricia" was particularly beautiful --  Cornelius Dufallo's sweet violin<br>lead was gorgeous.  None of the singers could be faulted.  Meredith<br>Borden's coloratura soprano was a standout, with her not-too-wide vibrato<br>(praise her!) and a limpid grace.  While blending in perfectly with the<br>instruments, she was yet able to project above them without increasing<br>her volume -- a tough feat, and probably mostly attributable to her<br>excellent intonation.  (She gets a lot of practice as a member of<br>Birdhouse, the group headed by Jon Catler.)  Phillip Anderson's<br>intonation was even better in the next piece.  Before he sang, Elaine<br>called our attention to his phrasing, which was indeed flawless.<br><br>Comparone called the selections from J. Bodin de Boismortier's "Don<br>Quichotte chï¿½z la Duchesse" "the most charming music of the evening" --<br>it was that.  The ending of Scene 3 was lovely -- Mary Hurlbut's<br>*soprano* provided the *bass* for a quintet that included the 2 flutes<br>and 2 violins.<br><br>Following the first of two intermissions, Anderson's aria from Leonardo<br>Vinci's "Didone Abbandonata" was a kind of Baroque Italian equivalent to<br>the Clash's "Should I Stay Or Should I Go" -- a feature of the pieces<br>selected for performance was their dramatic or fun element; several of<br>the pieces referred in some way to getting drunk, quite in keeping with<br>the general ambience of the evening.  Marshall Coid's aria from Act 2 was<br>given the most dramatic presentation of the evening; his counter-tenor<br>was the match of any female alto I've heard. <br><br>In the next opera, Marshall also displayed his talent as a violinist,<br>playing the solo part from the "Concerto" which opened the Telemann opera<br>"Der Neumodische Liebhaber Damon".  This piece (and in general, this<br>opera) had harmonies and modulations all over the place, and predictably,<br>this is where the Werckmeister III tuning really showed its stuff.<br><br>The 2 violins frequently played unison passages that were just far enough<br>away from exact unison to be a bit grating to the ears.  I'm familiar<br>with Tom Chiu's work with AFMM, so I suspect that it was Cornelius<br>Dufallo who was slightly off.  Cornelius, however, had a glowingly warm<br>tone and phrasing.<br><br>In the middle of Zeitlin's aria "Liebe Mich" in the Telemann, was an<br>incredibly gorgeous passage where the strings played sustained G-major<br>and D-dominant-7th chords against the harpsichord's arpeggios -- the<br>intonation was sublime.<br><br>Constantinos Yiannoudes had *great* projection, and lots of excitement. <br>Mary Hurlbut's vibrato was rather wider than the other singers, and not<br>as much to my taste, at least for music of this period.<br><br>I was not surprised to read in Joel Hess's biography that he is "an<br>accomplished linguist" -- his enunciations and pronunciations were<br>exemplary.  Both singing and playing in his Telemann aria were exquisite,<br>Johnny Reinhard giving his bassoon a real microtonally-inflected workout.<br><br>The Telemann was overall the most satisfying of the operas presented. <br>(By the way, were the Timpani also meticulously tuned to Werckmeister<br>III? chuckle, chuckle...)  After this, the largest-conceived work of the<br>evening, came the second intermission.<br><br>Reinhard Keiser's "Croesus" (a singe-spiele) concluded the concert. <br>Again, the slow movement of the Sinfonia was beautifully played by the<br>strings and harpsichord.  This points out the difficulty the winds have<br>adjusting to non-12-equal tunings.  Those who had the hardest time with<br>tuning were the horns:  the two horn players struggled valiantly --<br>against the nature of their modern valved instruments to produce 12-equal<br>or just/overtone pitches -- to play in Werckmeister III, adding a<br>piquancy (at best, really tasty, at worst, still quite interesting) to<br>every passage in which they had a part.  Also having some difficulty were<br>the oboes, 1st violin, and viola.  Jennifer DeVore and Mathew Fieldes did<br>okay on cello and bass, and Johnny Reinhard, Tom Chiu and Andrew<br>Bolotowsky displayed excellence in staying with the harpsichord's fixed<br>tuning.<br><br>Reinhard's facial muscles must have been sore as hell the following<br>morning from the exercise they got the night before.  In the slow intro<br>to "Hoffe Noch" (Keiser) his bassoon was a beautiful bass (in unison with<br>cello and harpsichord) to the higher parts played by the violins, viola<br>and harpsichord.  In this aria, Bolotowsky and Chiu also displayed their<br>prowess as microtonal flautist and violinist.  The ensemble supporting<br>Mary Hurlbut here consisted only of harpsichord, cello, 2nd violin,<br>flute, and bassoon.  I would say that because of the microtonal<br>experience of Reinhard, Chiu, and Bolotowsky, this was the most<br>well-tuned (or should I say well-tempered?) piece of the evening.<br><br>"Ich Sa' Ich Bau" was a duet beautifully matching Phillip Anderson and<br>Constantinos Yiannoudis.  There were some bizarre chord changes in<br>Constantinos's aria "Muss Ich" which sounded *really* spacy in<br>Werckmeister III.  Joel Hess's next aria was very funny, and sounded<br>great with the accompaniment of only harpsichord, bass, cello, and viola,<br>and in Hess's next aria, he emerged from the wings singing "Brill, brill"<br>as the salesman huckstering his wares.  His voice displayed well the<br>"sharpness" I heard in the instruments, and although his voice was<br>thinner than those of the other singers, every time he came out he<br>performed with a verve and exhilaration that were infectious. <br>Yiannoudis' rendition of "Die Flamme Steigt" was accompanied nicely by<br>harpsichord and strings only.  His voice is large -- sounds like it would<br>project easily in a big opera house.  The final piece was a chorus which<br>brought all of the singers out.<br><br>This was a unique musical evening, and one must extend many thanks to<br>Robert Buecker for making it possible.<br> <br>   Joseph L.

But the general gist is that they are<br>tunings that were explored during (roughly) the mid-17th through mid-19th<br>centuries.  They are, in a very approximate sense, about equally well in<br>tune in across all keys.<br><br>   That "very approximate sense" is in contrast to meantone, which sound<br>identical in all keys until you could bang into the "wolf fifth", at which<br>point they're dreadfully out-of-tune.  Well temperaments don't do that, but<br>they don't sound the same in every key either.  And some keys definitely<br>sound more "out of tune" than others, but not to anywhere NEAR the kind of<br>extreme you encounter with the wolf fifth.</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Review of SoHo Baroque Opera Concert in New York</h1><h3><a id=7263 href="#7263">ðŸ”—</a>monz@juno.com (Joseph L Monzo)</h3><span>3/19/1998 8:38:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>March 19, 1998  --  by Joe Monzo<br><br>Review of WHEN MOZART WAS A NINE YEAR OLD<br>Presented by SoHo Baroque Opera Company<br>New York City -- Monday, March 16, 1998<br><br><br><br>Humorously called by harpsichordist Elaine Comparone "A Review, not a<br>Pastiche", this free 4-hour concert, the third and final one in a series<br>that was open to the general public (but very limited in terms of space),<br>presented selections from six practically unknown French, Italian, and<br>German Baroque operas, utilizing Werckmeister III temperament, one of the<br>so-called "Well Temperaments" (the tunings Bach intended for the<br>"Well-Tempered Clavier").<br><br>The concert was held in the loft which is both home and workshop for<br>Robert Beucker.

It's 12-tone, right?<br><br>   Yes, well-temperaments are, as far as I can tell, strictly 12-toned.<br><br>   Best I can tell, there's no single definition that covers them all.<br>There have been dozens of them.  But the general gist is that they are<br>tunings that were explored during (roughly) the mid-17th through mid-19th<br>centuries.  They are, in a very approximate sense, about equally well in<br>tune in across all keys.<br><br>   That "very approximate sense" is in contrast to meantone, which sound<br>identical in all keys until you could bang into the "wolf fifth", at which<br>point they're dreadfully out-of-tune.  Well temperaments don't do that, but<br>they don't sound the same in every key either.  And some keys definitely<br>sound more "out of tune" than others, but not to anywhere NEAR the kind of<br>extreme you encounter with the wolf fifth.</div>
