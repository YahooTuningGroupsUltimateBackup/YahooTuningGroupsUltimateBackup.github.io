Mr. Wilson has made a forty-year study in the area of musical<br>temperament which follows an ongoing thread of research and<br>experimentation, really from the dawn of Western Music. The Uath-72 is a<br>1990's rendition of the Bosanquet Generalized Keyboard built in the late<br>19th century. Bosanquet's original design was a takeoff on the standard<br>mechanical piano action, modified to present several ranks of keys<br>organized in levels or tiers. Generally speaking, deviations in pitch from<br>the standard 12-tone Equal Temepered pitches were organized into the<br>successive ranks of black and white keys. A full discussion of the<br>background of this instrument and the study of tunigs and temperament is<br>beyond the scope of this paper. The modern electronic version of the<br>keyboard configures the ranks into a flat 2-dimensional planar array of<br>keys. The onboard computer, the MIDI interface and the availability of<br>programmable synth engines all conspire to yield a truly programmable<br>instrument which may be retuned with a button press or two rather than a<br>week with a piano technician's tuning hammer!"<br><br> Their web address is http://www.catalog.com/starrlab/ for more<br>information.
