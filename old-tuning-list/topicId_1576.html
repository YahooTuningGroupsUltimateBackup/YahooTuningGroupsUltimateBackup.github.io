What bothers me is that while I could easily<br>> sense the shift in tonic if I were to hum it from the beginning of the<br>> progression in order to focus on it, I didn't seem to be all that<br>> bothered by it if I just listened to the chords as they were.<br><br>   Wandering tonics of course are one of my big fascinations in this field<br>of unusual tunings, so I always enjoy hearing impressions of how they<br>affect people.  Thanks for describing that impression.  <br><br>   The first time I heard a wandering tonic was, something like about 10<br>years ago, when I programmed it into Dave Hill's setup at FSU's Center for<br>Music Research.

So the effect of "normal,<br>normal, normal, normal ... yeah yeah same ol' stuff, ... HUH?!  How the<br>hell did we get here??!!" is a bit more mysterious than on 22TET.

In a purely JI scenario, the<br>tonic would wander up by 36:35, which is quite a bit more than the 81:80<br>downward wander of the comma-shift mentioned earlier.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 20 Jan 1997 14:15 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA08657; Sun, 19 Jan 1997 16:19:51 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA08676<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id HAA15443; Sun, 19 Jan 1997 07:19:47 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 19 Jan 1997 07:19:47 -0800<br>Message-Id: <199701190506_MC1-F65-745E@compuserve.com><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Steve's Thoughts on Commas and Pseudocommas</h1><h3><a id=4643 href="#4643">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@CompuServe.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/1997 10:40:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> This was all the more<br>> puzzling in light of Pauls explanation to me that I had created the<br>> _same amount of shift_ that I was trying to avoid when I used the<br>> borrowed tone in my experiments.
