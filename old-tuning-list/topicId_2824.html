Are you seriously suggesting that the melodic difference limen<br>is the single most important aspect in choice of tuning? I can think of<br>three counterarguments...<br><br>(1) Melody is only one aspect of musical performance.

Often, this is intentional. The "flat" blues third may<br>not give a "new" melody, but it sure does give a new feeling to the<br>music. Such feelings are a *very* important aspect of many kinds of<br>music, and may be of any size that is perceptible, not just those sizes<br>that create "new" melodies.<br><br>(3) Even if we grant the melodic difference limen at 1/3 tone, this<br>says nothing about 19-tet per octave (or per stretched pseudo-octave<br>as you prefer). Indeed, the octave of a note is *not* a substitute for<br>that note in a melody. There is a paper (Diana Deutsch in Music<br>Perception, I believe) in which simple melodies such as Yankee<br>Doodle are played with the octaves of the notes scrambled up. Most<br>people cannot recognize the melodies, though they can follow them<br>once they are told what the melody is "supposed" to be. Thus melodic<br>concerns cannot be used to justify *any* scale based on the octave.<br><br>>I do _not_ believe it is possible to be inspired in 13-<br>or 20-tone equal; the lack of even the shadow of any possible musical<br>order is too great.<br><br>Humbug. Ask people who have composed in these scales (I am one,<br>and there are others, both on and off this list). Inspiration is<br>something that can strike at any time, in any tuning. The notion of an<br>"impoverished" scale is equally foolish. Different scales have<br>different stories to tell.

I have composed several<br>pieces (one was on the ill fated 19 for the 90's collection, another is<br>on my forthcoming Xentonality CD). In my opinion the best feature of<br>19-tet is how familiar everything is. Hence, yes Bob Lee, it might be<br>fun to tune a steel guitar that way. 19-tet makes a great bridge into<br>alternative tunings, and it may well be useful as a tool for "seducing"<br>people, for introducing them to the whole idea that non-12-tet music<br>exists. But let's not get carried away.
