In fact, Danielou describes step sizes ranging from 19.6 to 29.6 as<br>being "commas" of 20 cents, and step sizes ranging from 21.5 to 29.6 as<br>being "disjunctions" of 32 cents.<br><br>I should point out, too, that actual tuning ratios are not found in Indian<br>music theory until the late 17th century, and that it is rare to find two<br>treatises that agree.
