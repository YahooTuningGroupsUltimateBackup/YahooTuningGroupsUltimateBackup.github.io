I think I understand<br>>>Meantone now, but I keep seeing references to Well.  It's 12-tone, right?<br><br>     Yes, Well temperament generally refers to the 12 note division of the<br>octave.  <br>Meantone tuning, ( which got its name long after it was no longer used, I<br>think),  display little key color, as most of the usable keys are tuned alike,<br>with the last 1/3 of the combinations absorbing all of the comma.  Keys are<br>really harmonious or really bad.<br>    Well temperament, on the other hand, spread the comma out far enough to<br>make even the worst keys acceptable to the 17th and 18th century ears.  The<br>elegance of a well temperament was judged by how even a tonal palette<br>resulted, and the difference of tempering in the thirds provided what I have<br>labeled a "Harmonic Toolbox" for the composers of the era.  They would select<br>a key for particular harmonic character to fit their composition. <br>     There were quite a few meantone tunings that spread the comma beyond the<br>first four fifths:  there was 1/5 comma, 1/6, etc.,  all of which gradually<br>tempered more and more of the intervals.  If I had to make a hard edge<br>distinction, I would say that a well temperament provided a variety of<br>tempering in the root tonic thirds, in a progression demonstrated by<br>modulating by fourths or fifths, with no third tempered by more than a<br>syntonic comma.  The more accidentals, the more dissonance in the thirds.  The<br>Young,(1799) has the F#-C# third at 21.5 cents, but that is the limit.  Some<br>of the earlier well temperaments had several thirds that were tempered this<br>much, but no more.  <br>     The well temperaments were, of course, hijacked by those that touted the<br>'doctrine of affections", or the "Character of the Keys", etc.  These<br>philosophies had their origin in Plato and his buddies idea of "Ethos", and<br>through the ages, whatever was current was fair game for "proof".  <br>     I have written a long piece for all of this, which can be found at <br>http://www.airtime.co.uk/forte/history/edfoote.html<br>   If you want to hear well temperament on a modern Steinway, email me off<br>list for an address, and I can send you ordering info.  <br><br>Regards, <br>Ed Foote <br>Precision Piano Works<br>Nashville, Tn.</div><h3><a id=7283 href="#7283">ðŸ”—</a>mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)</h3><span>3/22/1998 6:37:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>>Okay, I'm starting to get the gist of what well temperaments are all about,<br>>but I don't really see how they are constructed.<br><br>   I don't claim to be the kind of expert that, for example Ed Foote is,<br>but from what I understand, you specify a well-temperament in terms of how<br>many (pythagorean) commas you temper each fifth.<br><br>   The premise of a 12 toned scale is that a stack of twelve fifths, which<br>would bring you from (for example) a Ab all the way around to a G#, should<br>land you on what is conceptually the same note.
