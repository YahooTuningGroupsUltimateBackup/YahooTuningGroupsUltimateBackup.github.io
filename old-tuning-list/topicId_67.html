So if a typical authentic cadence were represented a drop in<br>harmonic tension of 3 to 1, on a hypothetical scale of 0 to 10, then some of<br>these may represent a reduction in harmonic tension from 5 to 3.  I like to call<br>this "raising the ante" - we're still reducing tension, but at higher overall<br>level.  <br><br>   But anyway, there certainly are interval resultions that can propel 88CET<br>nontraditional cadences somewhat analogously with how tritone resolution propels<br>some traditional cadences.  The 9:7 supramajor third can resolve outward to a<br>perfect fifth, or a minor sixth.  That latter case requires two voices to<br>resolve outward by whole-step.  Still, it is perhaps more powerful nevertheless<br>because it moves from a startling dissonance to a warm, poignant consonance,<br>rather than to a cold, bland interval like a perfect fifth.  Here is an example<br>of this sort of raised-ante resolution (recall my notation system presented<br>earlier):<br>                                        G<br>                                    F<br>                                    C     <br>                                        Bb<br><br>                                        G<br>                                    F<br>                                    C<br>                                        B<br><br>(This consists of two supramajor thirds separated by an off-fourth, resolving to<br>a perfect fifth below a minor sixth separated by a whole-step.  It has a<br>slightly deceptive-like taste.  <br><br>   The curious-sounding 15:7 minor ninth can resolve outward to the 19:8 minor<br>tenth, or 5:2 major tenth.
