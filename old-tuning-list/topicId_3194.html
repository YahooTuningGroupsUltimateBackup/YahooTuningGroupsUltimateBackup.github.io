An article on new discoveries about the Sun talks <br>about how the Sun has moving sound waves inside it that cause the whole <br>star to throb with the sound waves pulsations..."These oscillations, <br>which can be tens of kilometers high and travel a few hundred meters per <br>second, arise from sounds that course through the solar interior. The <br>sounds  are trapped inside the sun; they cannot propagate through the <br>near vacuum of space.(Even if they could reach Earth, they are too low <br>for human hearing.) Nevertheless, when these sounds strike the Sun's <br>surface and rebound back down, they disturb the gases there, causing them <br>to rise and fall, slowly and rhythmically, with a period of about 5 <br>minutes..."   then, "The surface oscillations are the combined effect of <br>about 10 million separate notes-each of which has a unique path of <br>propagation and samples a well defined section inside the Sun. So to <br>trace the star's physical landscape all the way through...we must <br>determine the precise pitch of all the notes."
