I'm interested in describing<br>the parameters of tuning that operate in solo unaccompanied singing. A<br>number of years ago, I looked at this in the songs of several women singers<br>from central Java, Indonesia.  Now I'm looking at unaccompanied solo song<br>in various styles of euro-american-world music.  Can anyone direct me to a<br>publication that gives a table of the cent values that operate in a<br>just-tuned scale, in comparison, say, to other scales?  I have the<br>marvelous table called "Microtonal Music," which was "coordinated by Tui<br>St. George Tucker, Robert Jurgrau, and Johnny Reinhard," that appeared on<br>cover of Ear Magazine East 7/5 (11-1/1982-83).  Have there been any<br>critiques of this table, or has it been superceded?<br>Thanks,  M Hatch</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>TUNING digest 1341</h1><h3><a id=7164 href="#7164">ðŸ”—</a>mfh2@cornell.edu (martin hatch)</h3><span>3/2/1998 10:31:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I recently enrolled in the tuning digest list.
