However I'm still not completely convinced<br>that the intonation of the 5/3 and 6/5 are as important as the <br>that of 3/2 and 5/4, but even if it is, there are not independent<br>intervals.  In triads, one has both a major third and a minor third and<br>adjusting either the fifth or the major third adjusts the minor third<br>as well. There are only two degrees of freedom, not three, which reduces<br>to one in meantone-like tunings or their positive analogs.<br><br>Since the differences between the fifths and thirds of these tunings are<br>measured in fractions of a cent, the question is rather moot for <br>synthesizer users at the moment, though Csound and Kyma may have the<br>required resolution.<br><br>Another question is whether the sum of the squared or even absolute <br>errors <br>is the proper measure of out-of-tuneness. Errors in the flat direction <br>may be more serious than sharp ones, but both our techniques conflate <br>the two.<br><br>I thoroughly agree that the triads of 15-tet are more consonant than<br>those of 10-tet, but this is not relevant. We were both talking about<br>meantone-like tunings which form their major thirds as 4 fifths up,<br>their major sixths as 3 fifths up and their minor thirds as the difference<br>between the fifth and the major third, which is equivalent to taking <br>the minor third as 3 fifths down. If the fifth is greater than 700 cents,<br>these relations no longer hold in any meaningful sense.  <br><br>In the case of 10-tet, the major third is 360 cents and is non-cyclic<br>with respect to the fifth. It is also the same as the minor third. In<br>15-tet, there is a non-cyclic minor third of 320 cents and a n-c major<br>third of 400. The cyclic "thirds" of both tunings are 240 and 480 cents,<br>a whole tone and a fourth, so neither would be used in triads. <br><br>There is also the question of how one weights the intervals, whether or<br>not one includes the major sixth/minor third in the mix. By varying the<br>weights, one can bias the tuning towards any of the intervals, though I<br>think both mine and Paul's can be defended. <br><br>I've appended a list of my tunings with their error analyses along with<br>Paul's and a few novel and historical ones.<br><br>Tuning/Errors:		   Squared Errors (EX2):<br><br>JC  LST35 again696.8946974308664 <br>TF(2*F+ 8*T+ 16*OCT)/34 <br>E35.060303

However I'm still not completely convinced<br>that the intonation of the 5/3 and 6/5 are as important as the <br>that of 3/2 and 5/4, but even if it is, there are not independent<br>intervals.  In triads, one has both a major third and a minor third and<br>adjusting either the fifth or the major third adjusts the minor third<br>as well. There are only two degrees of freedom, not three, which reduces<br>to one in meantone-like tunings or their positive analogs.<br><br>Since the differences between the fifths and thirds of these tunings are<br>measured in fractions of a cent, the question is rather moot for <br>synthesizer users at the moment, though Csound and Kyma may have the<br>required resolution.<br><br>Another question is whether the sum of the squared or even absolute <br>errors <br>is the proper measure of out-of-tuneness. Errors in the flat direction <br>may be more serious than sharp ones, but both our techniques conflate <br>the two.<br><br>I thoroughly agree that the triads of 15-tet are more consonant than<br>those of 10-tet, but this is not relevant. We were both talking about<br>meantone-like tunings which form their major thirds as 4 fifths up,<br>their major sixths as 3 fifths up and their minor thirds as the difference<br>between the fifth and the major third, which is equivalent to taking <br>the minor third as 3 fifths down. If the fifth is greater than 700 cents,<br>these relations no longer hold in any meaningful sense.  <br><br>In the case of 10-tet, the major third is 360 cents and is non-cyclic<br>with respect to the fifth. It is also the same as the minor third. In<br>15-tet, there is a non-cyclic minor third of 320 cents and a n-c major<br>third of 400. The cyclic "thirds" of both tunings are 240 and 480 cents,<br>a whole tone and a fourth, so neither would be used in triads. <br><br>There is also the question of how one weights the intervals, whether or<br>not one includes the major sixth/minor third in the mix. By varying the<br>weights, one can bias the tuning towards any of the intervals, though I<br>think both mine and Paul's can be defended. <br><br>I've appended a list of my tunings with their error analyses along with<br>Paul's and a few novel and historical ones.<br><br>Tuning/Errors:		   Squared Errors (EX2):<br><br>JC  LST35 again696.8946974308664 <br>TF(2*F+ 8*T+ 16*OCT)/34 <br>E35.060303
