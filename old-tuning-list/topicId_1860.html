It has subsequently been proven (through inherited<br>planetary configurations) that the pre-existing nature of the child<br>chooses this moment rather than the position causing the child to be<br>something.  So the child sort of says "this signal is my cue".<br><br>I agree that you will find very little benefit from astrology as it is<br>practiced.<br><br>-- Ray Tomes -- rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz -- Harmonics Theory --<br>http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 18 Mar 1997 21:38 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04981; Tue, 18 Mar 1997 21:38:53 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04959<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id MAA01327; Tue, 18 Mar 1997 12:32:35 -0800<br>Date: Tue, 18 Mar 1997 12:32:35 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.3.95.970318122539.23230A-100000@equinox><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=5140 href="#5140">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Jo A.
