They rise to <br>distinction solely by the magnitude of <br>their  incompetence.<br>In shocking contrast, the most learned and<br>profoundly insightful minds of post-war music<br>theory barely even register on the academic<br>radar scope: Harry Partch, Ben Johnston, <br>David Doty, James Tenney, Ivor Darreg,<br>Easley Blackwood, Rudolf Rasch, Augusto<br>Novaro, Adriaan Daniel Fokker, Paul <br>Rapoport, Ivan Wyschnedgradsky.<br>These are strong claims, demanding strong<br>proof.  So let's examine one of the princes<br>of post-war music theory, Milton Babbitt,<br>in his own words.<br>--<br>Babbitt writes:<br>"And still, the structure of the harmonic<br>series does not supply a basis for the<br>status of the minor triad in tonal music. <br>It either dissonantly 'contradicts' it<br>or requires the invocation of still further<br>assumptions of intervallic permutation<br>or numerology." [Babbitt, Milton, "The<br>Structure and Function of Musical Theory,"<br>The College Music Symposium, Vol. 5,<br>Fall 1965]<br>Let us leave aside the hypocrisy of Mr.<br>Pitch Class Matrix complaining about<br>"still further assumptions of intervallic<br>permutation or numerology."  For Milton<br>Babbitt to gripe about "numerology"<br>is a like a prostitute complaining about<br>public immorality.<br>Instead, let us merely take note of Babbitt's<br>shocking ignorance--for Hugo Riemann answered <br>his objection to the harmonic series as basis<br>for western music in 1906, fully sixty<br>years before Babbitt's article appeared<br>in print. Riemann pointed out that the<br>minor triad is generated by inverting<br>harmonics 4, 5, 6  to produce<br>1/4, 1/5, 1/6, which when multiplied by<br>the lowest common denominator yield<br>overtone series members 10, 12, 15.<br>Babbitt's bizarre fixation on the harmonic<br>*overtone* series to the utter exclusion of<br>the *subharmonic* series reveals both his<br>shallowness as a theorist and his pervasive<br>ignorance.  Any second- or third-year<br>music student should have been exposed<br>to Riemann.  Where was the sainted Milton<br>Babbitt when he should have been taking<br>notes as an undergraduate?  Is *this*<br>the low standard to which professors are<br>held at Princeton?  <br>Milton Babbitt goes on to follow his previous <br>howler about the harmonic series with an even <br>more startling display of quackery:<br>"And yet, the succession of intervals in the<br>overtone series does not correspond to the <br>categorization of 'consonant' and 'dissonant,'<br>even in relative terms, whether one asserts <br>the independent assumption of adjacency<br>or of relation to the first partial. Under<br>the former criterion, the fourth would be<br>termed more consonant than the major<br>third; under the latter, the minor seventh<br>and major second would be termed more<br>consonant than the major or minor sixth, <br>or the minor third." [Babbitt, Milton, op cit., <br>1965]<br>This is an astounding display of<br>circular logic.  Because members of the<br>harmonic series cannot be characterized<br>according to the limited criteria of 12-tet<br>tuning, Babbitt concludes that the harmonic <br>series is neither "consonant" nor "dissonant" and <br>thus is not musically useful.<br>Say WHAT?<br>The harmonic series simply requires <br>*different* criteria of consonance and<br>dissonance than 12-tet.  But this in no<br>way renders the harmonic series *useless*<br>as a source of music.  It merely demands that<br>we toss out our limited 12-tet definitions<br>of "consonance" and "dissonance" when we<br>compose with the harmonic series.<br>Amazingly, Babbitt continues to heap shame <br>on himself,  writing: "The concepts of <br>consonance and dissonance have induced<br>centuries of a comedy of methodological<br>errors, from the rationalistic stage, <br>through the so-called 'experimental<br>stage,' without it having been clear or<br>inquired at any time as to the object of<br>the rationalizing or the experimentation.<br>Clearly, this is because consonance and<br>dissonance are context dependent tonal<br>concepts; it is impossible to assert that<br>an interval is consonant aurally, since it <br>always can be notated as dissonant, and<br>this notation reflects a possible context."<br>[Babbitt, Milton, op cit., 1965]<br>We can only conclude that Babbitt  never read <br>Helmholtz; we know this because he is utterly<br>UNfamiliar with the elementary and clear-cut<br>criterion of sensory consonance as defined<br>by Helmholtz.  This criterion allows us to<br>classify *ANY* vertical structure as<br>"consonant" or "dissonant" (in purely sensory<br>terms) contrary to Babbitt's ignorant<br>and false claim that "it is impossible to<br>assert that an interval is consonant<br>aurally."   Helmholtz's definition easily<br>allows us to define which intervals are<br>"consonant aurally" because Hemlholtz's theory deals <br>with nearby partials interfering with each other<br>to cause beats--this same idea was elaborated <br>by Plomp and Levelt in their classic paper <br>"Critical Bandwidth and Consonance" published<br>*the same year* as Milton Babbitt's article.<br>So not only was Babbitt unaware of Helmholtz's <br>work, he was *also* utterly ignorant of *modern*<br>acoustics and  psychoacoustics.<br>This is typical of the worst traditions of <br>modern "scholarship:" read nothing outside<br>your tiny subspeciality.  Ignore the real<br>world.  Write only book about books <br>about books. <br>Even so, it's astounding and mind-boggling <br>that someone could graduate with a PhD in<br>music--much less rise to the position<br>of professor at Princeton--without ever<br>reading Helmholtz's Tonempfindungen or<br>leafing through a copy of the Journal of<br>the Acoustical Society of America.<br>But we've still not plumbed the full depths<br>of Milton Babbitt's ignorance.<br>In a stunning display of slovenly logic,<br>Babbitt confuses willy-nilly  the *radically* <br>different concepts of musical consonance, <br>sensory consonance, and musical discordance.<br>You don't need to be a scientist to understand<br>the musical importance of making a sharp<br>distinction between these different ideas.  Norman<br>Cazden was no scientist, yet he wrote with deep<br>insight about these issues in his 1959 article<br>"Musical Intervals and Simple Number Ratios,"<br>Journal of Research in Music Education, Vol. 7,<br>1959, pp. 197-220.<br>Easley Blackwood is no scientist, but *he* <br>understood the musical importance of these<br>ideas: Blackwood makes an exquisitely precise <br>distinction between  musical  consonance and <br>musical discordance in his  article "Modes<br>and Chord Progressions in the Equal Temperaments,"<br>Perspectives of New Music, Vol. 29, No. 2, 1992,<br>pp. <br>These two far less famous music theorists <br>understood quite well this distinction...yet<br>Milton Babbitt didn't understand it at all.<br>Amazing.<br>Just amazing.<br>Having demonstrated his ignorance of acoustics<br>and psychoacoustics, Milton Babbitt damages his <br>reputation even further by writing:<br>"One can continue with the overtone follies,<br>with what having the overtone series commits<br>one to eat [!], but perhaps it is necessary only to<br>point out that a theory...of representative<br>works of the 18th and 19th centuries undoubtedly<br>would include the concepts of the major and<br>minor triad as definitional...  These concepts hardly<br>suggest the postulation of an overtone series as<br>a master concept entailing them." [Babbitt, Milton,<br>op cit, 1965]<br>This is one of the most astounding displays of<br>fractured logic in post-war music theory.<br>After all, once you climb the overtone series you<br>have by definition exited western music...so why<br>must you retain such western concepts as "major"<br>and "minor"?<br>Babbitt never bothers to address this issue. It's<br>obvious that he didn't even understand it--the<br>concept that "major" and "minor" might be<br>artifacts of 12-tet simply lay beyond his grasp. <br>He was too ignorant or too incompetent even to <br>realize that it *was* an issue.<br>Second:<br>Can a professor of music at Princeton actually<br>have failed to recognize that the subharmonic<br>series can be viewed as nothing more than the<br>application of an elementary linear function<br>to the harmonic series?  <br>Take the inverse of the harmonic series. You<br>get the subharmonic series.<br>This is nothing more than a composition of<br>functions.  <br>It's simple.  <br>It's obvious.  <br>For heaven's sake, both Hugo Riemann and Max<br>Meyer both pointed this out in classic music <br>theory texts, and Henry Cowell strongly hinted<br>at building chords out of subahrmonics in his<br>1930 text.  All three of these well-known western<br>music theorists used a transformation of the overtone<br>series to explain the minor mode in western<br>music.<br>And yet these basic well-worn classic texts of music <br>theory are unknown to Milton Babbitt...<br>How can this be?<br>At this point we must ask: How did this man get <br>a doctorate in music?<br>How in God's name did Milton Babbitt pass his <br>doctoral oral examination?  Why wasn't he flunked<br>out?<br>It's unbelievable.<br>Untaught, untutored, unschooled, unlettered, <br>unedified, unenlightened, unread: these are the <br>words which describe Milton Babbitt.  <br>Remember those 7-Up commercials for "The <br>UnCola"?<br>Milton Babbitt is the "UnScholar."<br>--<br>Hear the Word, ladies and gentlemen.<br>The Prophet has Spoken.<br>William Alves and Denny Genovese, you've<br>received the Law From Princeton.
