That's why<br>I've been taking up the real saxophone recently - so that I can try to regain<br>the raw performance skill I've lost over the last several years of theorizing<br>and composing.  <br><br>   Second, I would take Neil's concern one step farther in one particular<br>direction:  Some of us will just have to accept that we're not cut out for<br>certain types of musical pursuit, and take some other form of microtonal<br>pursuit.  I have to accept that that may even end up applying to me with regard<br>to producing CDs of my music.  I haven't given up by any stretch of the<br>imagination, and am thus improving my chops in order to remedy that particular<br>problem.  <br><br>   Whether and when to give up is something that each of us has to decide for<br>himself, the hard part being figuring out how to take constructive criticism.<br>It's very easy to either give up entirely, rather than doing the hard work of<br>locating the SPECIFIC problem and fixing it.  And on the other end of spectrum<br>it's easy also to ignore the criticism entirely, which is usually a very bad<br>idea.  The difficulty of that task is compounded by the fact that SOMETIMES<br>(although not often), some constructive criticism really SHOULD be ignored<br>entirely or serve as a sign that you really should COMPLETELY give.  <br><br>   But perhaps even more important is, if you do give up on performing,<br>composing, or whatever, to find some other area where you CAN contribute.  <br><br>   Third, I think it's important to note the difference between Neil's criticism<br>here and some of the other postings with a critical tone (and no, I'm not<br>refering to any single person here).  Neil's critique has carefully avoided<br>mentioning specific names in this public forum.  He has clearly reserved that<br>for person-to-person direct communication.  He also clearly mentioned his own<br>weaknesses as well, that he's primarily a performer over a theorist.  Neil has<br>also taken that fact into account in his own persuits too:  He hasn't created<br>any new tuning systems that I know of, but has instead exploited his true<br>talent, which is performance.  That's admirable.  <br><br>   Fourth and finally, I think it's important to follow up critiques of this<br>sort with specific person-to-person critique.  I say that because this sort of<br>posting is bound to raise a lot of questions in peoples' minds in addition to<br>Neil's main aim, which is to ask us to just generally practice our trade more<br>than trade it.  A lot of people are probably asking "hmmm... who is thus and so<br>sentence in particular refering to?"  So I hope that he and others will do an<br>effective follow-up as well.  <br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 3 Dec 1996 02:35 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA28055; Tue, 3 Dec 1996 02:37:02 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA26667<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id RAA17596; Mon, 2 Dec 1996 17:37:00 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 2 Dec 1996 17:37:00 -0800<br>Message-Id: <v01510106aec8b1f793dc@[134.173.37.15]><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>about that Brian McLaren in Tuning digest 893...</h1><h3><a id=4214 href="#4214">ðŸ”—</a>DMB5561719@aol.com</h3><span>12/1/1996 9:06:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>In early November I had rushed surgery to remove<br>a large agressive cyst from my left thigh.
