Stephen aptly points<br>out that in the diatonic case, this is often done using the I, IV, and V<br>chords. Another important example is I, II, and V; also I, IV, and VII<br>is often found in dorian or mixolydian rock music. All of these are<br>examples of three consecutive chords in a chain of fifths. Many rock<br>tunes, however, are based on three consecutive chords in the scale, such<br>as VI, VII, I in minor. So I don't view it as a great disadvantage that<br>my scale isn't covered by the tonic, subdominant, and dominant chords.<br>In fact, I recently stated on the List (with regard to my contest to<br>find another diatonic-like scale) that the property of coverability by<br>three consonant chords was not very important to me. In fact, I only<br>included it in my paper as a way of ruling out overly "complicated"<br>scales, such as 14 out of 26-tET, which I would otherwise have to<br>consider. I am now very happy to consider it, even though the (lack of)<br>clarity with which 4 or 5 chords might project a set of 14 notes clearly<br>presents a formidable compositional challenge.<br><br>Another property is that in the diatonic scale, any two triads can be<br>linked using only common tones and single-step-motion voice leading<br>(this was pointed out by Agmon). This is not true for the tetrads in the<br>decatonic scale. However, common practice music does not always progress<br>in this simple way -- passing tones and leaps are quite common, and<br>without them, one would have very little freedom in realizing a chord<br>progression or harmonizing a melody. So again, my scale posesses no<br>great disadvantage -- certain chord progressions will necessitate<br>passing tones or leaps. Decatonic melody will therefore be more active<br>than diatonic melody, in line with the greater number of tones that need<br>to be kept fresh in the mind of the listener.<br><br>As for "hypertones", I'm sure some very interesting music could be made<br>using this principle, particularly if each hypertone is associated with<br>a particluar timbre. But I would still want to make sure that the<br>ordinary "tones" making up the hypertones were forming good melodies, or<br>at least not forming awkward ones, since we are in some sense wired up<br>for speech recognition, and the human voice can only produce tones (i.e.<br>a fundamental and its harmonics, plus noise), not hypertones.</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>RE: Hypertones, counterset & other weird microanimals (fwd)</h1><h3><a id=8945 href="#8945">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Paul H.
