If<br>it were legal to sell pure dioxin, the ads would<br>call it "pure" and "natural," and would state that<br>"2 of 3 customers prefer dioxin because it's <br>scientifically formulated, new and improved."<br>--<br>Let me go into some detail on each of these slippery<br>words/phrases:<br>[1] "In tune" is obviously meaningless.  This phrase<br>basically means "the intonation I like."  If you <br>substitute "the intonation I like" instead of "in tune,"<br>you elicit the real meaning of the sentence.  For<br>example: "Meantone thirds are in tune, as opposed<br>to the out-of-tune thirds of 12-tone equal <br>temperament." <br>This actually means: "Meantone thirds use a tuning<br>I like, as opposed to the thirds of 12-tone equal<br>temperament whose tuning I don't like."<br>By converting what should be a statement of<br>subjective musical opinion into what seems like<br>an acoustic edict, the phrase "in tune" creates<br>an infinite number of unnecessary arguments about<br>nothing very significant.<br>[2] "Consonance"/"Consonant"/"Dissonance"/"Dissonant"<br>This slippery pair of antitheses has at least 6<br>different meanings: "consonant" can mean "what I<br>like," or "lack of audible roughness in the partials,"<br>or "musically not out of place" or "musical" or <br>"concordant" or "schematically/logically<br>consistent with a given system."  The classical Greeks<br>used the last definition: to the Greeks, a note which<br>was "consonant" was a note generated logically and <br>systematically from the genus and the tonos which <br>produced it.  This is a meaning radically different <br>from most current definitions of the word<br>"consonant."<br>Very often "consonant"/"dissonant" are used merely<br>as statements of musical enjoyment.  Thus one<br>often hears "Webern's music is horribly dissonant,"<br>which actually nothing more than "I don't like it,"<br>or conversely (mainly in modern music journals) <br>"such-and-such a composition employs wonderful<br>dissonances" (which means nothing more than<br>"most people don't like it, but I do.")  <br>Probably the most extreme statement of this latter<br>aesthetic was made by John Zorn: "Grinding, horrible,<br>hideous noise--those are four of the highest <br>compliments I can receive."  There are two radically<br>opposed aesthetics in today's avant garde music--<br>one  elevates whatever the pop music mass audience<br>hates most vehemently as the "best" music, the other <br>elevates whatever tone combinations exhibit the<br>greatest sensory consonance as the "best" music.<br>The former is exemplified by industrial music <br>(viz., Einsturzende Neubauten, Michael Myers, <br>Nocturnal Emissions, Skinny Puppy, etc.)<br>the latter by the purist just intonation advocates<br>(viz., David B. Doty, Harry Partch, Ben Johnston,<br>Dane Rudhyar, etc.)<br>It is well to bear in mind that most music falls<br>somewhere in between these two extremes, and<br>thus the terms "consonant"/"dissonant" will <br>almost always be used confusingly in 2, 3, 4 or<br>more senses at once.<br>[3] "Prefer"/"Preference"/"Preferred"<br>It's amazing how often this term pops up in<br>the last 700 posts of this tuning digest.  You<br>find it almost everywhere, in  5 different<br>meanings: [1] "what I like" [2] "most logically<br>consistent with a given system" [3] "most<br>sensorily consonant" [4] "most musically <br>appropriate" [5] "mathematically simplest."<br>It should be clear that arguments involving<br>the terms "preferred intervals" or "pitch<br>preference" will almost always use the<br>word in different senses.  Such arguments<br>are thus not only unresolvable, but usually<br>meaningless as well.<br>[4] "pure"  This is an obviously sense-free<br>qualifier.  It can be defined to some degree<br>in chemistry--otherwise it's just a buzz-word,<br>especially where aesthetics is concerned.<br>[5] "natural"  This word is used in at least<br>6 senses when discussing musical tuning:<br>[1] "technically impractical" [2] "small<br>integer ratio" [3] "resulting from the<br>mathematical solutions of small<br>perturbations of linear one-dimensional<br>physical oscillatory systems" [4] "consistent<br>with western music from 1500 A.D. - 1880 A.D."<br>[5] "mathematically simplest" [6] "what<br>I like"<br>The term is almost always used in 3 or 4<br>different senses at once.  During my lecture<br>on non-just non-equal-tempered tunings, I<br> start out by blowing across the top<br>of a metal tube stopped at the botton with<br>one finger.  A flute-like note results.<br>"That's natural," I tell the audience.  Then I<br>hold the tube by a node and hit it with a<br>hammer. "That's unnatural."<br>At this point the audience begins to titter.<br>Then I repeat the process: blow across the<br>tube. "We can talk about this.  It's natural."<br>Then hit the tube.  "We can't talk about<br>this.  It's unnatural."<br>Most of the audience is now staring with<br>poached-egg eyes and looking at one<br>another,  wondering when this crazy person <br>will be dragged offstage.<br>This shock effect exploits the schism<br>between many conflicting usages of the<br>term "natural."  Of course,   harmonic<br>series tones generated by a one-dimensional <br>oscillator (viz., an end-stopped tube with<br>an airflow across the open end--those who<br>claim this oscillatory system is not one<br>dimensional  need to learn some physics,<br>and check the rotational symmetry of the<br>wave equation solutions which collapses the<br>eigenvalues down to a 1-D case) and the non-<br>just non-equal-tempered inharmonic series<br>generated by a  struck metal tube <br>are both equally "natural."  <br>It makes no sense to speak of one type of<br>physical oscillator or set of partials as<br>"natural," and another type of physical<br>oscillator or set of partials as "unnatural."<br>Any set of partials generated by the physical<br>acoustics of vibrating bodies is de facto<br>natural, since that set of vibrational modes is<br>generated in accord with the natural laws<br>of physical acoustics.  The term "unnatural" <br>doesn't even parse when speaking<br>of physical acoustics--a sound would have<br>to be produced by violating the laws of<br>physics in order to be "unnatural."  Since no<br>such sound can be produced, the term is<br>semantically null.<br>"Natural" is essentially a Victorian buzz-word<br>when applied to the arts.  It should be relegated<br>to ads for feminine hygiene products.<br>[6] "Modern"/"Progress"/"Science"/"Scientific"<br>are also Victorian buzz-words.  These terms<br>are used instead of the more subjective and<br>thus logically indefensible phrase "what is<br>less easy to understand" or "what is more<br>complicated."<br>The late 20th century is characterized by a<br>unique confusion between quantity and quality.<br>To my knowledge, no other era or culture has<br>so persistently conflated "more  X" with<br>"better X."  (X can be anything you like.)<br>Thus, in  late 20th century music, "more <br>mathematical music " means "better music."<br>"More incomprehensible music theory" means<br>"better music theory."  This has carried over<br>to microtonality: "Higher limit JI" usually means<br>"better JI."   "More nearly harmonic series<br>ratios" usually means "Better ratios."  "More <br>unfamiliar tuning" usually means "better tuning." <br>Thus "modern" plays on the bizarrely late-20t<br>hentury delusion that newer = worthwhile,<br>and more = better.<br>Lou Harrison has turned the misuse of the Victorian<br>buzz-word "modern" on its head by pointing out<br>"how much we've lost since Boethius."  Harrison's<br>usage so completely deflates the buzz-word  <br>"modern" that it becomes difficult to regard<br>such words as anything but propaganda. <br>(Even so, the buzz-word misuse of "modern" persists. <br>I myself have been told by tenured academics that my<br>music isn't of interest because "it isn't modernistic<br>enough" or "it doesn't reflect a modernist sensibility."<br>To them this is brutal criticism: to me,  high praise.<br>Son cosas de la vidas...)<br>[7] "Rational"/"Irrational"   This is a mathematically<br>precise but also perfidiously subtle example of<br>an otherwise-meaningful term misused persistently by<br>proponents of just intonation.  By calling a tuning<br>"rational" such proponents invidiously imply that the<br>tuning is "more sane" or "more sensible" than<br>equal temperament, meantone, et al.  This can most<br>clearly be seen in the title of the cassette "Rational<br>Music For An Irrational World."  The words "rational"<br>and "irrational" are used simultaneously in their<br>mathematical and psychological senses, creating<br>endless confusion.<br>[8] "improved"/"better"  This is obviously meaningless.<br>Every cheapjack ripoff piece of junk sold by late-night<br>TV hucksters is "new and improved."  The same is<br>true of tunings--"better" is simply senseless <br>when applied to an intonation, except as an indication<br>of personal emotional attachment.<br>[9] "musical"/"unmusical"  This is a truly insidious<br>buzz-word because it has at least 4 meanings:<br>[1] "the tuning sounds good to me" [2] "the tuning<br>fits in with my mathematical/historical/performance<br>prejudices" [3] "the tuning is ingeniously constructed"<br>[4] "the tuning is consistent with 12-TET conventions"<br>12-TET has been called both "musical" and "unmusical."<br>Just intonation has been called both "musical" and<br>"unmusical."   Perhaps it would be better to substitute<br>the phrase "osmotic" for "musical."  This would make<br>completely clear the inanity of the term when applied <br>to intonation.<br>[10] "Mathematical"/"Experimental"  The former term <br>is almost always used instead of the phrase "fits<br>with the mathematical system I prefer to use to<br>generate my particular tuning."  As such, the term<br>is a statement of personal aesthetic pleasure or<br>displeasure camouflaged as  a statement of scientific <br>rigor (or lack thereof).<br>The latter term is a vague means of indicating a<br>desire to be seen as somehow in step with the sciences,<br>and thus "modern," "mathmatical," ad nauseum.  In<br>practice, a composer or artist or dancer has foudn that<br>s/he can do anything at all and justify it by claiming<br>that it's "experimental."  Thus, pirouetting onstage naked<br>with gefilte fish on your head is idiotic if you do it<br>sans explanation:  but if you call it "experimental," suddenly<br>pirouetting onstage naked with gefilte fish on your head <br>acquires a profound new quasi-mathematical pseudo-<br>scientific significance.<br>[11] "New"/"Novel"/"Unique" and [12] "Old"/"Old-fashioned"<br>/"Outmoded"  are essentially identical or<br>antithetical (synonym/antonym) to "modern."<br>Just as meaningless. Very few intonational ideas<br>or methods are new--someone somewhere has used<br>all ideas and methods before.   For example, <br>Llewellyn S. Lloyd scooped me by proposing the idea<br>of an "inharmonic series" that's just as natural<br>as the "harmonic series" in a 1941 article in JASA.<br>It's almost impossible to invent anything truly new.<br>Thus the term is itself largely a misnomer. In any<br>case, as with "modern," the real intent is to disguise<br>an aesthetic opinion as an historical fact.<br>[13]  "history of music"/"music"  This is a subtle<br>but pervasive distortion.  Writers typically<br>talk about "the intonation of music," the "twelve<br>notes of the musical scale," and so on.  These<br>phrases are a priori gibberish.  There are many<br>musics throughout the world, and throughout<br>history.  To which music does "the musical scale"<br>or "the conventions of music" refer?  Is the<br>music theorist discussing the tuning of the Kwaiker<br>xylophone?  Or the bonangs of the Javanese gamelan?<br>Is the music writer talking about Western music<br>ca. 1400 after Walter of Odington introduced the 5/4 <br>into music theory?  Or is the writer talking about<br>Western Music in the classical Greek period, when<br>genera and tonoi were the mode of discourse and<br>vertical harmony had no significance?<br>Without further qualifiers, "music" is a term<br>so broad as to include virtually every acoustic<br>phenomenon in the circumambient universe. <br>[14] "harmonic" and "harmony" are used in 4<br>different completely contrary senses: [1]<br>harmonic can mean "member of harmonic series,"<br>or [2] "consonant harmony" or [3] "concordant" or<br>[4] "recognizably similar to 12-TET vertical<br>triadic structures."  <br>The term "harmony" can be used to mean "sounds good<br>to me" (the tones maketh a sweete harmony <br>together), or "vertical musical structure" or<br>"concordant" or "sensory consonance."  Many of<br>the unresolvable and fruitless controversies in<br>music theory stem from the unfortunate fact that<br>the english language uses the same word both<br>to indicate an acoustic fact (vertical simultaneous<br>tones) and an aesthetic judgment (sounds lovely).<br>[1] "concord"/"discord"  There is no agreement<br>as to what these words mean.  They've been<br>used in at least 5 different senses: <br>[1] "musically conventional" [2] "sensory consonance"<br>[3] "within the mode" [4] "within the scale"<br>[5] "sounds good to me"<br>There is some consensus growing that "concord"<br>ought NOT to mean "sensory consonance," but this<br>does not clear up the vast confusion created by<br>the other 4 possible overlapping meanings of<br>the term.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 12 Aug 1996 17:39 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11053; Mon, 12 Aug 1996 17:39:16 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11066<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA24295; Mon, 12 Aug 1996 08:39:13 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 12 Aug 1996 08:39:13 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9608121135.A22177-0100000@email.ir.miami.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Another post from Brian</h1><h3><a id=3398 href="#3398">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/12/1996 8:08:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>From: mclaren<br>Subject: weasel-words in the discourse about tuning<br>--<br>As Sir Joshua Reynolds pointed out,  "there is no expedient<br>to which man will not resort to avoid the real labour of<br>thinking."

Of course,   harmonic<br>series tones generated by a one-dimensional <br>oscillator (viz., an end-stopped tube with<br>an airflow across the open end--those who<br>claim this oscillatory system is not one<br>dimensional  need to learn some physics,<br>and check the rotational symmetry of the<br>wave equation solutions which collapses the<br>eigenvalues down to a 1-D case) and the non-<br>just non-equal-tempered inharmonic series<br>generated by a  struck metal tube <br>are both equally "natural."  <br>It makes no sense to speak of one type of<br>physical oscillator or set of partials as<br>"natural," and another type of physical<br>oscillator or set of partials as "unnatural."<br>Any set of partials generated by the physical<br>acoustics of vibrating bodies is de facto<br>natural, since that set of vibrational modes is<br>generated in accord with the natural laws<br>of physical acoustics.  The term "unnatural" <br>doesn't even parse when speaking<br>of physical acoustics--a sound would have<br>to be produced by violating the laws of<br>physics in order to be "unnatural."  Since no<br>such sound can be produced, the term is<br>semantically null.<br>"Natural" is essentially a Victorian buzz-word<br>when applied to the arts.  It should be relegated<br>to ads for feminine hygiene products.<br>[6] "Modern"/"Progress"/"Science"/"Scientific"<br>are also Victorian buzz-words.  These terms<br>are used instead of the more subjective and<br>thus logically indefensible phrase "what is<br>less easy to understand" or "what is more<br>complicated."<br>The late 20th century is characterized by a<br>unique confusion between quantity and quality.<br>To my knowledge, no other era or culture has<br>so persistently conflated "more  X" with<br>"better X."  (X can be anything you like.)<br>Thus, in  late 20th century music, "more <br>mathematical music " means "better music."<br>"More incomprehensible music theory" means<br>"better music theory."  This has carried over<br>to microtonality: "Higher limit JI" usually means<br>"better JI."   "More nearly harmonic series<br>ratios" usually means "Better ratios."  "More <br>unfamiliar tuning" usually means "better tuning." <br>Thus "modern" plays on the bizarrely late-20t<br>hentury delusion that newer = worthwhile,<br>and more = better.<br>Lou Harrison has turned the misuse of the Victorian<br>buzz-word "modern" on its head by pointing out<br>"how much we've lost since Boethius."  Harrison's<br>usage so completely deflates the buzz-word  <br>"modern" that it becomes difficult to regard<br>such words as anything but propaganda. <br>(Even so, the buzz-word misuse of "modern" persists. <br>I myself have been told by tenured academics that my<br>music isn't of interest because "it isn't modernistic<br>enough" or "it doesn't reflect a modernist sensibility."<br>To them this is brutal criticism: to me,  high praise.<br>Son cosas de la vidas...)<br>[7] "Rational"/"Irrational"   This is a mathematically<br>precise but also perfidiously subtle example of<br>an otherwise-meaningful term misused persistently by<br>proponents of just intonation.  By calling a tuning<br>"rational" such proponents invidiously imply that the<br>tuning is "more sane" or "more sensible" than<br>equal temperament, meantone, et al.  This can most<br>clearly be seen in the title of the cassette "Rational<br>Music For An Irrational World."  The words "rational"<br>and "irrational" are used simultaneously in their<br>mathematical and psychological senses, creating<br>endless confusion.<br>[8] "improved"/"better"  This is obviously meaningless.<br>Every cheapjack ripoff piece of junk sold by late-night<br>TV hucksters is "new and improved."  The same is<br>true of tunings--"better" is simply senseless <br>when applied to an intonation, except as an indication<br>of personal emotional attachment.<br>[9] "musical"/"unmusical"  This is a truly insidious<br>buzz-word because it has at least 4 meanings:<br>[1] "the tuning sounds good to me" [2] "the tuning<br>fits in with my mathematical/historical/performance<br>prejudices" [3] "the tuning is ingeniously constructed"<br>[4] "the tuning is consistent with 12-TET conventions"<br>12-TET has been called both "musical" and "unmusical."<br>Just intonation has been called both "musical" and<br>"unmusical."   Perhaps it would be better to substitute<br>the phrase "osmotic" for "musical."  This would make<br>completely clear the inanity of the term when applied <br>to intonation.<br>[10] "Mathematical"/"Experimental"  The former term <br>is almost always used instead of the phrase "fits<br>with the mathematical system I prefer to use to<br>generate my particular tuning."  As such, the term<br>is a statement of personal aesthetic pleasure or<br>displeasure camouflaged as  a statement of scientific <br>rigor (or lack thereof).<br>The latter term is a vague means of indicating a<br>desire to be seen as somehow in step with the sciences,<br>and thus "modern," "mathmatical," ad nauseum.  In<br>practice, a composer or artist or dancer has foudn that<br>s/he can do anything at all and justify it by claiming<br>that it's "experimental."  Thus, pirouetting onstage naked<br>with gefilte fish on your head is idiotic if you do it<br>sans explanation:  but if you call it "experimental," suddenly<br>pirouetting onstage naked with gefilte fish on your head <br>acquires a profound new quasi-mathematical pseudo-<br>scientific significance.<br>[11] "New"/"Novel"/"Unique" and [12] "Old"/"Old-fashioned"<br>/"Outmoded"  are essentially identical or<br>antithetical (synonym/antonym) to "modern."<br>Just as meaningless. Very few intonational ideas<br>or methods are new--someone somewhere has used<br>all ideas and methods before.   For example, <br>Llewellyn S. Lloyd scooped me by proposing the idea<br>of an "inharmonic series" that's just as natural<br>as the "harmonic series" in a 1941 article in JASA.<br>It's almost impossible to invent anything truly new.<br>Thus the term is itself largely a misnomer. In any<br>case, as with "modern," the real intent is to disguise<br>an aesthetic opinion as an historical fact.<br>[13]  "history of music"/"music"  This is a subtle<br>but pervasive distortion.  Writers typically<br>talk about "the intonation of music," the "twelve<br>notes of the musical scale," and so on.  These<br>phrases are a priori gibberish.  There are many<br>musics throughout the world, and throughout<br>history.  To which music does "the musical scale"<br>or "the conventions of music" refer?  Is the<br>music theorist discussing the tuning of the Kwaiker<br>xylophone?  Or the bonangs of the Javanese gamelan?<br>Is the music writer talking about Western music<br>ca. 1400 after Walter of Odington introduced the 5/4 <br>into music theory?  Or is the writer talking about<br>Western Music in the classical Greek period, when<br>genera and tonoi were the mode of discourse and<br>vertical harmony had no significance?<br>Without further qualifiers, "music" is a term<br>so broad as to include virtually every acoustic<br>phenomenon in the circumambient universe. <br>[14] "harmonic" and "harmony" are used in 4<br>different completely contrary senses: [1]<br>harmonic can mean "member of harmonic series,"<br>or [2] "consonant harmony" or [3] "concordant" or<br>[4] "recognizably similar to 12-TET vertical<br>triadic structures."  <br>The term "harmony" can be used to mean "sounds good<br>to me" (the tones maketh a sweete harmony <br>together), or "vertical musical structure" or<br>"concordant" or "sensory consonance."  Many of<br>the unresolvable and fruitless controversies in<br>music theory stem from the unfortunate fact that<br>the english language uses the same word both<br>to indicate an acoustic fact (vertical simultaneous<br>tones) and an aesthetic judgment (sounds lovely).<br>[1] "concord"/"discord"  There is no agreement<br>as to what these words mean.  They've been<br>used in at least 5 different senses: <br>[1] "musically conventional" [2] "sensory consonance"<br>[3] "within the mode" [4] "within the scale"<br>[5] "sounds good to me"<br>There is some consensus growing that "concord"<br>ought NOT to mean "sensory consonance," but this<br>does not clear up the vast confusion created by<br>the other 4 possible overlapping meanings of<br>the term.<br>--mclaren<br><br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 12 Aug 1996 17:39 +0200<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA11053; Mon, 12 Aug 1996 17:39:16 +0200<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA11066<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id IAA24295; Mon, 12 Aug 1996 08:39:13 -0700<br>Date: Mon, 12 Aug 1996 08:39:13 -0700<br>Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9608121135.A22177-0100000@email.ir.miami.edu><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div>
