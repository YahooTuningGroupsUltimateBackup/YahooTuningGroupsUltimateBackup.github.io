I just wanted to announce this Spring's University of<br>Michigan Digital Music Ensemble concert.  It wil be held in Mcintosh<br>Theatre at the School of Music in Ann Arbor, Michigan March 28th and 29th<br>at 8:00pm.  This year's concert is based around an article that appeared<br>in the June issue of Wired:  The "Long Boom".  This article detailed the<br>possible track that the world and technology will take in the next 30<br>years.  The concert will have several parts that deal with the different<br>sections of the article.  Nanotechnology, Cloning, Politics, etc.  Of<br>special note to the list will be a 19-TET Blues piece, in the bent of<br>Hstick, inspired by genetics/cloning.  The piece includes dancers,<br>improvisors, and interactive elements between dancers, musicians and the<br>audience.  A very cool show to be sure.  Please email if you have any<br>questions.  Oh, it's FREE. :)<br><br>Later,<br><br>Alex Ruthmann<br><br>**************************************************************************<br>*                                    * "Information is not knowledge,    *<br>*                                    *  Knowledge is not wisdom,         *<br>* Alex Ruthmann                      *  Wisdom is not truth,             *<br>* sruthman@umich.edu                 *  Truth is not beauty,             *<br>* http://www.umich.edu/~sruthman     *  Beauty is not love,              *<br>*                                    *  Love is not music and            *<br>*                                    *  Music is THE BEST." -Frank Zappa *<br>**************************************************************************<br>*         Horn Performance and Performing Arts Technology Majors      	 *<br>*   Undergraduate Research Assistant in Frank Zappology and Schlepping   *<br>*          University of Michigan-Ann Arbor -- School of Music           *<br>**************************************************************************<br><br><br>SMTPOriginator:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>From:  Polychroni Moniodis <UPB_MONIODIS@ONLINE.EMICH.EDU><br>Subject:  Melograph?<br>PostedDate:  13-02-98 15:31:59<br>SendTo:  CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>ReplyTo:  tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>$MessageStorage:  0<br>$UpdatedBy:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=coul1358/OU=AT/O=EZH,CN=Manuel op de Coul/OU=AT/O=EZH<br>RouteServers:  CN=notesrv2/OU=Server/O=EZH,CN=notesrv1/OU=Server/O=EZH<br>RouteTimes:  13-02-98 15:31:07-13-02-98 15:31:09,13-02-98 15:29:03-13-02-98 15:29:03<br>DeliveredDate:  13-02-98 15:29:03<br>Categories:  <br>$Revisions:  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl ([137.174.112.59]) by notesrv2.ezh.nl (Lotus SMTP MTA SMTP v4.6 (462.2 <br>9-3-1997)) with SMTP id C12565AA.004FBDD3; Fri, 13 Feb 1998 15:30:59 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA01715; Fri, 13 Feb 1998 15:31:59 +0100<br>Date: Fri, 13 Feb 1998 15:31:59 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA01713<br>Received: (qmail 4994 invoked from network); 13 Feb 1998 06:27:45 -0800<br>Received: from localhost (HELO ella.mills.edu) (127.0.0.1)<br>  by localhost with SMTP; 13 Feb 1998 06:27:45 -0800<br>Message-Id: <01ITIY69TEEC90N20J@ONLINE.EMICH.EDU><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Microtonal/Digital Music Concert</h1><h3><a id=7128 href="#7128">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;A.....&#x22; &#x3C;sruthman@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/1998 4:25:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Hello everyone.
