After reading the excellent historical and <br>geographical overview of microtonality in the US by Brian McLaren:<br><br>   http://w3.teaser.fr/~daschour/usa.html<br><br>   ..., I've decided to disband the little triple-just mailing list I <br>started and to start another specifically for just intonation in general <br>(as opposed to various equal-tempered non-12-tone scales, and non-just, <br>non-equal-tempered scales), since that's the area that I'm most <br>specifically interested in.<br><br>   This will provide a smaller and more specific alternative to the <br>Mills College alternate tunings mailing list. I think the whole field <br>really suffers from a lack of publicity and public relations, and being <br>a publicity wonk myself, I definitely want to do something about that. <br>So I'll be publicizing this new mailing list on 8 usenet newsgroups, and <br>my publicity notices will also include links to the Mills College <br>alternate tunings mailing list page at the Just Intonation web site (for <br>those who aren't aware of it's existance), the introduction to just <br>intonation at the same web site, as well as Brian McLaren's article. <br><br>   Hopefully, this will kill 3 birds with one stone, and be in the best <br>interests of everybody. <br><br>   I also want to create a just intonation-specific web page with more <br>precise links to specific articles than there are at the Just Intonation <br>web page. As long as I'm going to be doing all this research for my own <br>use, I might as well create an archive of links to the best writings on <br>just intonation on the web while I'm at it. Please let me know by <br>private e-mail which articles on the web you think are the best <br>regarding just intonation.
