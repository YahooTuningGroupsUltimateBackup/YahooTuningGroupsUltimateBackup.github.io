The core sequence we<br>developed at Wesleyan in the mid-eighties (but sadly never implemented due<br>to the tragic death of Jon Higgins) envisaged a four course sequence, each<br>lasting a semester, each with a specific model repertoire, and an<br>associated intonation (the titles were very broadly drawn and for the<br>fourth course never really settled upon):<br><br>(1) _Melody_, using chant and other monophonic repertoire, primarily<br>Pythagorean.<br>(2) _Counterpoint_, especially _15th_ century, introduction of just triadic<br>intervals.<br>(3) _Tonality_, Bach Chorales and Preludes, and Mozart Sonata movements,<br>introduction to and consequence of instrumental (keyboard) techniques,<br>including temperaments.<br>(4) _Chromaticism and Serialism_, generalization of variation techniques,<br>including fugue, resources of equal temperament.<br><br>Beyond this sequence, advanced courses in contemporary or experimental<br>music, in special topics within classical western repertoire, and in other<br>repertoires would be offered.  <br><br>My experience with University-level music students on both sides of the<br>ocean, and with the level of musicianship within the tuning community has<br>convinced me that it is better to go deep rather than broad when it comes<br>to intonation. An intellectual encounter with 15 (let alone 50) tuning<br>_systems_ within 15 weeks is of limited practical value - as is the study<br>of modal counterpoint learnt at the tempered piano keyboard. I think that a<br>course of study where the musicianship and musical intellect are developed<br>simultaneously will leave the student musician with the tools required to<br>explore further repertoire - and further systems of intonation - or to<br>compose new repertoire - and design appropriate tunings - with greater<br>command, and I daresay, more musicality.   <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sat, 23 Nov 1996 00:53 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA04680; Sat, 23 Nov 1996 00:54:50 +0100<br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA04695<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl> id PAA01975; Fri, 22 Nov 1996 15:54:48 -0800<br>Date: Fri, 22 Nov 1996 15:54:48 -0800<br>Message-Id: <45961122231554/0005695065PK2EM@MCIMAIL.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4121 href="#4121">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@CompuServe.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/1996 2:05:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>> I'll have to try these different modes out!
