You bet your butt I am not putting out CD's only to<br>think of reaching a small, select group of my peers...I see "microtonal"<br>music as the only viable way for "western" music to go, so I am doing my<br>darndest to reach anyone I can...being a guitarist is a great advantage<br>in this regard, as it is probably the "pop" axe of choice in the world<br>today, especially with younger folks...I have had great success here in<br>Denver with reaching a wide spectrum of people with these (to most<br>people) new musical concepts. I went to my church gig sunday, and there<br>on the bulletin board was a newspaper article about yours truly and the<br>Microstock festival...people all over town are getting curious, and in a<br>very natural way...this, I feel, is good.<br>    I feel we are put on this Earth to DO something, so my goals are<br>high...I won't be happy (I am happy, actually...that's just a figure of<br>speech) until the tyranny of 12 equal tones is forever demolished...I<br>believe that there are many many ways to tune and play, and I plan to<br>let people know that this is OK<br>    Sorry to ramble...of course a CD should be killer, both musically<br>and in a marketing sense...for better or worse, we live in a very<br>"market" oriented world, so I don't mind taking the challenge...how can<br>one honorably market a good product without being like a used car<br>salesman? I hope to keep working on that question, and I plan to record<br>as much as possible, and educate as much as possible too, but in a<br>peaceful way...I agree with Gary...why spend thousands of buckos unless<br>you really mean it to be successful? Of course, one must always account<br>for other people's paths as well, so if someone wants to put out a CD<br>for other reasons, more power to them...this is a good subject to<br>discuss...Hstick<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Tue, 7 Nov 1995 06:31 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id UAA07873; Mon, 6 Nov 1995 20:31:40 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 6 Nov 1995 20:31:40 -0800<br>Message-Id: <951107042733_71670.2576_HHB56-7@CompuServe.COM><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Gary Morrison's post on why CD's</h1><h3><a id=2272 href="#2272">ðŸ”—</a>neil.haverstick@csst.com (Neil Haverstick)</h3><span>11/6/1995 5:08:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Haverstick here...I was very glad to see Morrison address the<br>motives behind putting out recordings...I have been a "microtonalist"<br>for mere 6 years, but a guitarist/performer for 30, and I think that my<br>background of playing zillions of freelance gigs, from blues jazz and<br>country to Symphony Pops concerts to avant garde atonal stuff has been a<br>wonderful thing as I approach the problem of bringing alternate tunings<br>to "ordinary" folks.
