The<br>notes Ab, F# and Eb will seek to resolve by moving a minor second<br>(diatonic semitone) in the direction of their alteration (this being the<br>usual resolution of a chromatic note). Furthermore in the first version<br>of the augmented sixth, the augmented fourth between Ab and D is highly<br>dissonant (the meantone aug4, which is very close to 7/5, only seems to<br>be consonant when it is part of a 4-5-6-7, 5-6-7, or 4-5-7 chord).<br><br>The spelling of bIIaug6 in C major would be Db-F-G-B or Db-F-Ab-B. Once<br>again a highly chromatic chord in C major - the first has an augmented<br>fourth with the bass, the second has two chromatic notes.<br><br>For these reasons it is unlikely that an augmented sixth can function as<br>a tonic, despite its consonance.<br><br>So, if a consonant (virtually 4-5-6-7) chord can be used as an aug6th<br>chord why not use a 4-5-6-7 chord as a dominant (or indeed secondary<br>dominant)?<br><br>The augmented sixth chord sounds like a 4-5-6-7 chord by *chance*, there<br>is no design here. The origin of this chord was not the result of a<br>quest to maximise the consonance of a dominant seventh type chord, but<br>to serve as a chromatic substitution for (alteration of) the second<br>inversion of the dominant 7th whose *bass* note is a chromatic semitone<br>above the aug6th's root (that, at least, is the conventional explanation<br>for its origins).<br><br>To actively choose 4-5-6-7 for a (secondary) dominant 7th, is to quite<br>consciously introduce another note foreign to the major scale. In C<br>major the 7/4 of the dominant chord is a note more than 27 cents below<br>F, and as we have seen is well represented (in meantone) by the<br>augmented 6th E#. If composers really wanted to minimise the dissonance<br>of the dominant seventh, it would not have been beyond the notational<br>possibilities of the time to spell G7 as G-B-D-E#. But no composer does<br>this (unless of course the chord resolves *as an aug6th* (i.e. to F#<br>major).<br><br>To use this aug6th with the dominant chord consistently, one would have<br>to reconstruct the C major scale as an 8 note scale - C, D, E, E#, F, G,<br>A, B. But this E# only functions as a useful consonance in the G7 chord<br>- it is a note which can only serve in one chord position (7/4 type<br>seventh) in one chord (the 4-5-6-7 chord whose root is G).  All the<br>other notes can serve as root, third or fifth (and seventh etc.) except<br>for F - which can't be a fifth, and B - which can't be a root.<br>Furthermore it is only related to the other scale notes as a 7-limit<br>ratio when the very foundation of the major (and minor scales) are the 3<br>and 5-limit ratios of the major and minor triads. It is therefore a<br>somewhat superfluous and *unintegrated* note with respect to the C major<br>scale.<br><br>To use this extra-scalic E# (#3) is, therefore, a conscious and explicit<br>device which is useful for only one purpose, and that purpose is to<br>minimise the natural dissonance of the dominant seventh chord.<br><br>BUT, it is important to remember that it should not be the purpose of a<br>tuning system to remove all dissonance. Dissonance is the driving energy<br>of music. In counterpoint the alternation of consonance and dissonance<br>is fundamental to good form, and indeed without dissonance, creativity<br>is, perhaps, impossible. In relation to a quite different discussion on<br>the MTO-List, Nicholas Meeus wrote on 6th March 97:<br><br>> I used to claim, when teaching the history of medieval<br>> music, (and I was neither the first nor the only one to do so) that the<br>> status of composer originated when dissonances came to be accepted as<br>> possible intervals in composition. To write a consonant counterpoint<br>> against a borrowed cantus firmus is but an automatic application of a<br>> limited set of rules. To admit dissonances in the counterpoint is to give<br>> oneself the freedom that transforms an act of ordinary craftmanship into<br>> one of original creation. In this way, dissonances are the most essential<br>> aspect of a composition. Yet, throughout the history of our music,<br>> dissonances have indeed been presented as "supplementary" and<br>> "unessential".<br><br>Alternative tunings enable us to create strange and wonderful<br>consonances not available to 5-limit tuning, but at the same time it is<br>quite wrong to use tuning to eradicate all dissonances where-ever we<br>find them. Dissonance must be embraced not discarded.<br><br><br>> when I play around <br>> in meantone, I often go to the augmented sixth and don't resolve -- it's a <br>> nice bridge from 5-limit to 7-limit harmony.<br><br>This is certainly an intriguing idea, and it makes one wonder if any<br>classical composers or theorists of the time were aware of, or<br>discussed, the unexpected consonance of the aug6th chord.<br><br>Andrew Milne<br>Islington<br>London<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 16 Mar 1997 17:30 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA30148; Sun, 16 Mar 1997 17:30:19 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA30147<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id IAA23131; Sun, 16 Mar 1997 08:28:39 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 16 Mar 1997 08:28:39 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.95.970316112617.13110A-100000@u2.farm.idt.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>Einstein, linear temps</h1><h3><a id=5062 href="#5062">ðŸ”—</a>John Chalmers &#x3C;non12@deltanet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/1997 10:39:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>I had forgotten Bose-Einstein statistics, which is strange<br>because I had just read recently of the observation of interference<br>between two Bose-Einstein condensates and an "atom" laser.<br><br>I do believe that it is accepted that Einstein wasted the last<br>years of his career on an attempt to unify electromagnetism and<br>gravity while ignoring the strong and weak nuclear forces.<br><br>Following up Paul Erlich's suggestion, I have computed<br>the LST SQR positive tunings with 7/6 and 5/3 in addition<br>to 3/2, 5/4, and 7/4.

All the<br>other notes can serve as root, third or fifth (and seventh etc.) except<br>for F - which can't be a fifth, and B - which can't be a root.<br>Furthermore it is only related to the other scale notes as a 7-limit<br>ratio when the very foundation of the major (and minor scales) are the 3<br>and 5-limit ratios of the major and minor triads. It is therefore a<br>somewhat superfluous and *unintegrated* note with respect to the C major<br>scale.<br><br>To use this extra-scalic E# (#3) is, therefore, a conscious and explicit<br>device which is useful for only one purpose, and that purpose is to<br>minimise the natural dissonance of the dominant seventh chord.<br><br>BUT, it is important to remember that it should not be the purpose of a<br>tuning system to remove all dissonance. Dissonance is the driving energy<br>of music. In counterpoint the alternation of consonance and dissonance<br>is fundamental to good form, and indeed without dissonance, creativity<br>is, perhaps, impossible. In relation to a quite different discussion on<br>the MTO-List, Nicholas Meeus wrote on 6th March 97:<br><br>> I used to claim, when teaching the history of medieval<br>> music, (and I was neither the first nor the only one to do so) that the<br>> status of composer originated when dissonances came to be accepted as<br>> possible intervals in composition. To write a consonant counterpoint<br>> against a borrowed cantus firmus is but an automatic application of a<br>> limited set of rules. To admit dissonances in the counterpoint is to give<br>> oneself the freedom that transforms an act of ordinary craftmanship into<br>> one of original creation. In this way, dissonances are the most essential<br>> aspect of a composition. Yet, throughout the history of our music,<br>> dissonances have indeed been presented as "supplementary" and<br>> "unessential".<br><br>Alternative tunings enable us to create strange and wonderful<br>consonances not available to 5-limit tuning, but at the same time it is<br>quite wrong to use tuning to eradicate all dissonances where-ever we<br>find them. Dissonance must be embraced not discarded.<br><br><br>> when I play around <br>> in meantone, I often go to the augmented sixth and don't resolve -- it's a <br>> nice bridge from 5-limit to 7-limit harmony.<br><br>This is certainly an intriguing idea, and it makes one wonder if any<br>classical composers or theorists of the time were aware of, or<br>discussed, the unexpected consonance of the aug6th chord.<br><br>Andrew Milne<br>Islington<br>London<br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Sun, 16 Mar 1997 17:30 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA30148; Sun, 16 Mar 1997 17:30:19 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA30147<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id IAA23131; Sun, 16 Mar 1997 08:28:39 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 16 Mar 1997 08:28:39 -0800<br>Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.95.970316112617.13110A-100000@u2.farm.idt.net><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div>
