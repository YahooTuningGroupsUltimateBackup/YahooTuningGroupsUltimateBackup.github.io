In particular,<br>arpeggios, or step-wise runs spanning more than a third, almost always require<br>nontraditional chords or nontraditional progressions of traditional chords in<br>their harmonizations.  These pose problems because they call out pitch<br>relationships, notably thirds, other than the traditional diatonic ones.<br>Obviously that makes convincing diatonic harmony very challenging.  <br><br>   For example, let's suppose that you've established a certain C as the tonic,<br>and built what I guess could be called a C-major chord around it:<br>How do you harmonize the E a neutral third above it appearing right after it?<br>Do you call it scale-degree traditional diatonic scale degree 3 or flat 3?<br>Obviously this is not a problem for nontraditional harmony, but traditional<br>harmony requires that it masquerade as some diatonic function.  <br><br>   Audiences can be "tricked" into accepting this E as diatonic more easily than<br>you might think, because of a phenomenon I jokingly call "relativistic<br>voice-leading".  This is the perfect embodiment of the idea of functional<br>harmony - the idea that how a pitch is perceived is based on how it moves within<br>the counterpoint, more than its absolute pitch.  In another sense, it<br>illustrates why modulation works:  You can convince people that some new pitch<br>is now the tonic, if you make the step below it sound like a leading tone, and<br>resolve that pitch up to the new tonic in a well-understood way.  <br><br>   But in 88CET's relativistic voice-leading requirement, a given pitch is ONLY<br>understandable as a particular traditional diatonic role in terms how it relates<br>to the previous chord.  Since that E falls between two diatonic roles, your<br>audience will only be able to extrapolate a diatonic role for it by hearing that<br>E's usage (or adjacent pitches) in the previous chord.  <br><br>   This has a huge effect on the melodic harmonization process.  In traditional<br>harmonization of a melody, you automatically know what function a given melodic<br>pitch will have just by knowing its pitch.  In the key of C, a B has to be<br>perceived as a leading tone (provided of course that it truly is B rather than a<br>C-flat or an A-double-sharp).  In 88CET traditional harmony on the other hand,<br>there is no way to know without filling in the intervening harmony what function<br>a given pitch will perform.  <br><br>   Arpeggiation in a melody, also good for making melodies sound interesting,<br>causes problems because they usually outline close-triadic harmony.  Since<br>88CET's close-triadic harmonies are inherently nontraditional, you can't<br>harmonize those fragments traditionally.  <br><br>   With rapid step-wise motion and arpeggiation unavailable, it seems like only<br>uninteresting melodies that gravitate around a single pitch - can be harmonized<br>traditionally.  Luckily that isn't true after all.  Here are some melodic<br>formulas that get around these constraints:  <br>1.  Leap upward by either sixth, followed by slow step-wise motion downward to<br>    return to the tonic.  Leaps of a sixth, as Tamino's first aria in Die<br>    Zauberflote illustrates so marvelously, have a debonair, poignant<br>    demeanor.  <br>2.  Leap upward by a perfect fifth, followed by slow step-wise resolution to<br>    the tonic.  This has a much less poignant quality, but often works.  <br>3.  Either of these in retrograde;  the latter in reverse seems more effective <br>    to my ears, probably because it outlines the tonic triad.  <br>4.  Leap upward by tritone, followed by slow step-wise resolution to the<br>    tonic.  This has a more mysterious effect.  <br>5.  Any of the above in inversion.  <br>6.  Hover around the tonic for a while, leap upward by a fifth or sixth and <br>    hover there for a while, leap back down to the tonic vicinity.  <br><br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Wed, 18 Oct 1995 12:52 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id DAA01710; Wed, 18 Oct 1995 03:51:38 -0700<br>Date: Wed, 18 Oct 1995 03:51:38 -0700<br>Message-Id: <009980E0B8F59336.5ABA@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>88CET #21:  Melodies and Voice-Leading</h1><h3><a id=2158 href="#2158">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;71670.2576@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/1995 12:23:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Continuing with considerations for playing traditional harmony in 88CET...<br><br>   The most important constraint to producing traditional harmony in 88CET is<br>that the properties generally regarded as producing interesting melodies in any<br>tuning, don't lend themselves to traditional harmonization.
