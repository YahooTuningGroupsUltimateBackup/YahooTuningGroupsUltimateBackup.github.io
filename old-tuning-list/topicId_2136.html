I find this a fine auxillary notation, but since Iconsider the rational relationships to be an essential part of a work's syntactic content, chose to limit this usage to an auxiallary role. (I<br>admit to one great exception: my second String Quartet uses cent-deviation<br>notation; the sixteen strings are tuned to octave multiples of the first<br>sixteen primes, and - aside from natural harmonics - are unstopped, a<br>pythagorean basis for the notation seemed to be beside the point.
