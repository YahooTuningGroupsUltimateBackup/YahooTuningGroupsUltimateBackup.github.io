I think this is an earth-shaker!<br><br>   The short summary is that it's a very thorough and detailed<br>investigation of the interrelationships between tuning and timbre.  Both at<br>a theoretical and practical level.  And I say theoretical and practical<br>both in the musical and psychoacoustic senses of the words.  It comes with<br>a CD of auditory illustrations of the phenomena he describes.  You<br>essentially hold the CD on pause as you read the book, and when you get the<br>cue from the text, you hit the play button for that particular band.<br><br>   The book opens with a really killer illustration, I think:  After<br>quoting several "authoritative" comments about how fundamental the octave<br>is to our ears, he shows how easy it is to construct an only slightly<br>contrived-sounding timbre that makes an exact 2:1-frequency-ratio octave<br>sound utterly horrendous, and 2.1:1 ratio sound as though it were an<br>octave!<br><br>   I haven't read it cover-to-cover yet, but two things are apparent to me<br>from what I have read about it:<br>1.  This book is one of a very few I've read that very clearly breaks basic<br>    new ground in the field of unusual tunings.<br>2.  This book brings together the all-too-often separated fields of just<br>    intonation and temperament into a realm where they can be related to one<br>    another on equal terms.<br><br>   Here's the info:<br><br>Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale<br>by William A.
