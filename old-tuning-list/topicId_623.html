The Bohlen-Pierce <br>scale (13 notes per 3:1 ("tritave") or 8.2 notes/octave), whether or not <br>"tritave" intervals acquire an "equivalence" quality, is a fine tuning to <br>explore such music, as Randy Winchester's music proves. The consonant <br>intervals within one tritave here are 3:5 (6 steps), 3:7 (10 steps), and 5:7 <br>(4 steps), and supposedly their "inversions", 9:5 (7 steps), 9:7 (3 steps), <br>and 15:7 (9 steps), plus the 3:1 itself (13 steps). The maximum error here <br>is 6.5 cents, for the 5:3 and 9:5 approximations.<br><br>What if we wanted to extend this idea to 11-limit intervals? The first <br>really good solution is 39 notes per tritave, or 24.6 notes per octave: a <br>triplication of the Bohlen-Pierce scale. The largest error remains 6.5 <br>cents, but we gain the 11:9 (7 steps), 11:7 (16 steps), and 11:5 (28 steps) <br>and their tritave inversions and extensions.<br><br>How about 13-limit intervals? The Triple-Bohlen-Pierce scale still works, <br>without increasing the maximum error! 13:11 (6 steps), 13:9 (13 steps), 13:7 <br>(22 steps), and 13:5 (34 steps) are the new intervals here. That gives us 1 <br>5-limit, 2 7-limit, 3 11-limit, and 4 13-limit intervals, plus their <br>inversions, plus the tritave iteslf, for 21 consonant intervals out of 39. <br>These are 54% odds that two notes selected randomly by a monkey will be <br>consonant. The odds for the Pierce scale itself are the same, <br>7/13=21/39=54%.<br><br>In the world of octave scales, the odds of finding a consonance in 12-note <br>tuning are slightly better, 7/12=58%, but out-of-tuneness should weigh <br>against it. Otherwise, we could even allow a 9-note tuning and get 78% odds! <br>Maybe that's why a lot of composers have been successful with 9tet (not to <br>suggest that they're monkeys, of course). Other octave scales have worse <br>odds: if all 7-limit intervals and their octave inversions are allowed, the <br>odds are 48% in 27 and 42% in 31. If all 9-limit intervals are allowed, the <br>odds are 46% in 41 and 41% in 46. A 58-note tuning gives the monkey 50% odds <br>of hitting an 11-limit interval or its inversion, dropping to 40% for 72 <br>notes. With 87 notes to play with, the monkey would be within the 13-limit <br>47% of the time, dropping to 44% in a 94-note equal temperament.<br><br>Phew. All the tuning-limit combinations considered in the last paragraph are <br>both consistent and unique including octave inversions, which seems fair <br>since the Pierce and triple-Pierce scales satisfy the corresponding <br>properties for tritaves. I read them off columns 5 and 7 of my table in TD <br>781 #2, which is mostly read off Manuel's new table.

In fact, <br>quantizing a sawtooth wave to n levels eliminates all harmonics that are <br>multiples of n times the fundamental frequency.
