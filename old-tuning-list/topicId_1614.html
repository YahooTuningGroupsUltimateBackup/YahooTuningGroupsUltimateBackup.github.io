Is this some special<br>> tuning concept or is it just your word for a flexible JI that hovers<br>> around 440?<br><br>   Lucy tuning is a meantone temperament devised and promoted by Charles<br>Lucy.  Lucy periodically appears on the tuning list, by the way.  After<br>Lucy devised his tuning, he discovered that a fellow named Harrison had<br>previously devised it.  (I think Harrison was British from somewhere around<br>the turn of the century, but I'm not sure of that.)<br><br>   As with any meantone temperament, LucyTuning built upon a circle of<br>fifths.  The size of the fifth is such that the major third works out to<br>1/pi of an octave (352 cents), in the same sense that 12TET is based upon a<br>fifth such that the major third is 1/3 of an octave.  That puts the P5 at<br>about 695.5 cents, which means that it's somewhat similar with 88TET (not<br>to be confused with 88CET).  A stack of 88 LucyTuned fifths fails to close<br>the circle by only about 3 cents.<br><br>   It turns out that LucyTuning is a very close approximation to Erv<br>Wilson's "metameantone", which is a meantone tuning whose approximation to<br>a 4:5:6 triad (specifically in that voicing only) has equal beat<br>frequencies in its major and minor third intervals.  <br><br>   Your guess that LucyTuning might be a form of JI is amusingly ironic<br>(not that I'm criticizing you, of course, since you had no information on<br>it).  It's ironic in that Lucy has been critical of the<br>small-whole-number-ratio basis for tuning.  He claims in his book that<br>small whole-number ratio pitch relationships are meaningful only because<br>they approximate LucyTuned pitch relationships.  Lucy promotes his tuning<br>as a new basis for evaluating tuning as a whole.  <br><br>   Not surprisingly, some JI enthusiasts have reacted very negatively to<br>Lucy's book and his ideas in general.  They have complained not only from<br>the perspective of meantone being the ultimate basis of tuning, but also<br>based upon how he promotes his ideas.  In particular, Lucy apparently sells<br>his book for somewhere around $300, and provides some sort of consulting<br>service.  I don't know for sure, but I get the impression that he more or<br>less copyrights the tuning, suggesting that you can't use it without his<br>permission, or something like that anyway.  <br><br>   A couple years ago or so, I posted the results of a semiscientific<br>experiment I did comparing LucyTuning to several other tunings.  I<br>concluded that it struck me as a decent tuning, but I failed to detect<br>anything fundamental about it that would make it a revolutionary basis for<br>tuning principles.  I also concluded that JI was clearly a far more<br>auditorially intuitive basis for tuning.  LucyTuning struck me personally<br>as only one of a wide variety of possible alternative tunings.  It was<br>interesting, but I doubt if it'll make it to the top of my list of tunings<br>to explore within my lifetime.  But I'd encourage others to make up their<br>own minds.  <br><br>Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 3 Feb 1997 00:36 +0100<br>Received: by ns.ezh.nl; (5.65v3.2/1.3/10May95) id AA23053; Mon, 3 Feb 1997 00:36:22 +0100<br>Received: from ella.mills.edu by ns (smtpxd); id XA22918<br>Received: from  by ella.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	 id PAA17768; Sun, 2 Feb 1997 15:33:11 -0800<br>Date: Sun, 2 Feb 1997 15:33:11 -0800<br>Message-Id: <memo.980688@cix.compulink.co.uk><br>Errors-To: madole@mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@ella.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@ella.mills.edu</div><h3><a id=4726 href="#4726">ðŸ”—</a>Matt Nathan &#x3C;mattn@ix.netcom.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/1997 10:42:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'>Hello Charles,<br><br>We met in Los Angeles a number of years ago and I showed you<br>the graphics for a tuning-generation program I was designing <br>on the Amiga computer.<br><br>> As I see/hear it "harmonics" beat. <br><br>By definition, "harmonics" don't beat. <br><br>The more inclusive term "partials" is now used to describe<br>the sine wave components of timbre, whether those partials<br>are harmonic (relating in whole numbers) or inharmonic.<br><br>> To hear and appreciate this beating, it is crucial that<br>> instruments should be tuned as precisely as possible.<br><br>You seem to be confusing the beating within a single<br>note due to inharmonicity of partials with the beating<br>between two or more notes in various intervalic<br>relationships.
