I'd guess the amplitude of the subharmonic is<br>chaotic.  Or, the subharmonic is entirely chaotic but appears to be order<br>1/2 at certain times.  If the subharmonic comes from something like<br>Duffing's equation, it will probably arise in the tube, and so be isolated<br>from parameters like lip pressure.
