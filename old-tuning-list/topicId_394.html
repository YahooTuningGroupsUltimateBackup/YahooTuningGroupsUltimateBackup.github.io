Of course, I know <br>about the user table, and to send the bend before note on; it still <br>doesn't work in legato passages.  I don't understand why a sysex tuning <br>table command can change all of the pitches instantly, but the pitch bend <br>control takes so much time (it makes my string quartet sound like a <br>jaw-harp quartet). I can only guess that this <br>is built in for people who want to hear the gliss, and not for people who <br>simply want to set the bend at a microtonal level. By the way, I also <br>tried setting my bend capability in the Proteus at an octave, so that I <br>would change pitches only by a couple hundred units rather than a couple <br>thousand.  This didn't work well either.<br>Adam<br>asilverm@email.ir.miami.edu<br><br>Received: from eartha.mills.edu [144.91.3.20] by vbv40.ezh.nl<br>           with SMTP-OpenVMS via TCP/IP; Mon, 4 Mar 1996 16:43 +0100<br>Received: from  by eartha.mills.edu via SMTP (940816.SGI.8.6.9/930416.SGI)<br>	for <coul@ezh.nl> id HAA26854; Mon, 4 Mar 1996 07:42:33 -0800<br>Date: Mon, 4 Mar 1996 07:42:33 -0800<br>Message-Id: <0099ED71E7C85798.C6C6@ezh.nl><br>Errors-To: madole@ella.mills.edu<br>Reply-To: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Originator: tuning@eartha.mills.edu<br>Sender: tuning@eartha.mills.edu</div><a href="/old-tuning-list">back to list</a><h1>pitch bend</h1><h3><a id=2622 href="#2622">ðŸ”—</a>&#x22;Adam B.
