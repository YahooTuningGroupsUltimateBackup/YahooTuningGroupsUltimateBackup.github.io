(my copy is a draft)</p><p>Kassel notes that an outline sketch of the Preface from<br/>the 2nd edition of _Genesis of a Music_ [Partch 1974] gives<br/>dates for the drafts of _Genesis_ which are a bit more<br/>accurate than those published in the book:</p><p>  1927-28<br/>  1930<br/>  1934-35<br/>  1940-41<br/>  1944<br/>  1945-46<br/>  1947</p><p>_Genesis_ was finished in 1947, but not copyrighted and<br/>published until 1949.  (This finally clears up the confusion<br/>about *that*.)  So the proper citation for the 1st edition<br/>is &quot;Partch 1949&quot;.  The early title was _Exposition of Monophony_.</p><p>None of these early drafts were known to exist, until a<br/>1933 draft of Partch&apos;s _Exposition_ came to light in 1983,<br/>when it came into Jonathan Glasier&apos;s possession.  Excerpts<br/>from it were published in his journal _Interval_:</p><p>  Glasier, Jonathan. 1983.<br/>  &quot;Early Partch Work -- Part 1: Manuscript, Keyboard<br/>     Design Charts Uncovered&quot;.<br/>  _Interval_, Volume 4, Number 2, pp. 6-7.</p><p>  Partch, Harry.  1984.<br/>  &quot;Exposition of Monophony, Part II: Early Draft of<br/>    Harry Partch&apos;s Book Written 1928-1932&quot;.<br/>  _Interval_, Volume 4, Number 3, pp. 8-9.</p><p>I&apos;m encouraging Jonathan now to try to find the actual<br/>manuscript, because I&apos;m *very* interested in reading the<br/>whole thing.</p><p>While Jonathan originally called this a &quot;first draft&quot; of<br/>Partch&apos;s book, Kassel has traced its history to find that<br/>this manuscript is actually the *5th* draft Partch wrote,<br/>giving this plausible history from dates written in Partch&apos;s<br/>own hand in the margins:</p><p>draft  date   location</p><p>  1    1928  San Francisco<br/>  2    1920  New Orleans<br/>  3    1931  San Francisco<br/>  4    1932  Visalia, CA<br/>  5    1933  Los Angeles</p><p>Kassel, p 39:</p><p>&gt; What Glasier possesses then is the 1933 final draft of<br/>&gt; _Exposition_, to which Partch appended &quot;two notarized<br/>&gt; pages from the 1928 draft&quot;.</p><p>I will follow Kassel in referring to this document as<br/>&quot;Partch 1928/33&quot;.</p><p>Kassel indicates (p 42) that Partch had already decided<br/>on an &quot;expansion of consonance&quot; to the 11-limit by 1928.</p><p>Here is a Scala file of the scale inscribed on the<br/>fingerboard of Partch&apos;s Adapted Viola.  This is the<br/>earliest extant record of a Monophonic scale designed<br/>by Partch.</p><p>(And please note that this scale is quite different from<br/>&quot;partch_29.scl&quot; already in the Scala archive, which is a<br/>listing of pitches available in the 11-limit Tonality Diamond.)</p><p>------ begin Scala file -----<br/>! partch-29-av.scl<br/>!<br/>29-tone JI scale from Partch&apos;s Adapted Viola 1928-30<br/> 29<br/>!<br/> 33/32<br/> 21/20<br/> 15/14<br/> 12/11<br/> 10/9<br/> 8/7<br/> 7/6<br/> 6/5<br/> 11/9<br/> 5/4<br/> 9/7<br/> 4/3<br/> 11/8<br/> 7/5<br/> 10/7<br/> 16/11<br/> 3/2<br/> 14/9<br/> 8/5<br/> 18/11<br/> 5/3<br/> 12/7<br/> 7/4<br/> 9/5<br/> 11/6<br/> 28/15<br/> 40/21<br/> 64/33<br/> 2/1<br/>------ end Scala file --------</p><p>Partch also used ratios which were to approximated by interpolation<br/>between the ones indicated.  From Partch 1928/33, p 37:</p><p>&gt; There are 29 indications for ratios within the 2/1 (octave),<br/>&gt; corresponding to my 1928 theory of the more essential tones.<br/>&gt; The other ratios were comparative to these.</p><p>Kassel notes that while 9/8 and 27/16 are two of the open<br/>strings on the Adapted Viola, those ratios are not present<br/>in the scale inscribed on the fingerboard.  This leads<br/>Kassel to speculate (p 51):</p><p>&gt; 9/8 is especially crucial to Monophony, not only as the<br/>&gt; just major second of the diatonic scale but as the<br/>&gt; &quot;9 Odentity&quot; [9-limit component] of the consonant<br/>&gt; hexad that constitutes the &quot;Overtonality&quot; or &quot;Otonality&quot;<br/>&gt; (major key) built on 1/1.  9/8 also serves in its own<br/>&gt; right as one of the basic &quot;1-Odentities&quot; (fundamentals)<br/>&gt; in Monophony.  This evidence suggests that, in 1928,<br/>&gt; Partch had not yet established the 11-limit consonant<br/>&gt; hexad as the structural basis for Monophony&apos;s pitch gamut.</p><p>Then follows Kassel&apos;s footnote:</p><p>&gt; This would support the idea that Partch&apos;s lost 1920&apos;s<br/>&gt; string quartet attempted to impose just intonation onto a<br/>&gt; traditional polyphonic or homophonic texture built on a<br/>&gt; scale, and that he had yet to settle upon a system of<br/>&gt; just intonation derived from a single fundamental<br/>&gt; (i.e., Monophony).</p><p>The following scale is already in the Scala archive and<br/>matches exactly the one given in Kassel 1996:</p><p>------ begin Scala file -----<br/>! partch_37.scl<br/>! 37-tone JI scale from 1931-32 draft of Partch&apos;s &quot;Exposition&quot;<br/>From &quot;Exposition on Monophony&quot; 1933, unp. see Ayers, 1/1 vol.9(2)<br/> 37<br/>!<br/> 49/48<br/> 33/32<br/> 22/21<br/> 16/15<br/> 12/11<br/> 11/10<br/> 10/9<br/> 9/8<br/> 8/7<br/> 7/6<br/> 6/5<br/> 11/9<br/> 5/4<br/> 14/11<br/> 9/7<br/> 4/3<br/> 11/8<br/> 7/5<br/> 10/7<br/> 16/11<br/> 3/2<br/> 14/9<br/> 11/7<br/> 8/5<br/> 18/11<br/> 5/3<br/> 12/7<br/> 7/4<br/> 16/9<br/> 9/5<br/> 20/11<br/> 11/6<br/> 15/8<br/> 21/11<br/> 64/33<br/> 96/49<br/> 2/1<br/>------ end Scala file --------</p><p>About this, Kassel (p 83) states:</p><p>&gt; As the chapter called &quot;History of the 37&quot; in the 1933 draft<br/>&gt; [i.e., Partch 1928/33] seems likely to have been based on<br/>&gt; a similar one in the previous draft, it may be concluded<br/>&gt; that, by 1932, Partch favored a 37-tone scale over the<br/>&gt; 29-tone scale found on the Adapted Viola.</p><p>Then Kassel immediately continues:</p><p>&gt; The following incorporates the two scales; note that the<br/>&gt; 37-tone scale (like its predecessor) is symmetrical around 1/1:</p><p>Then Kassel tabulates the combination of these two scales and,<br/>guess what?... ends up with a 41-tone scale!</p><p>------ begin Scala file -----<br/>! partch-41combo.scl<br/>!<br/>41-tone JI combination from Partch&apos;s 29-tone and 37-tone scales<br/> 41<br/>!<br/> 49/48<br/> 33/32<br/> 22/21<br/> 21/20<br/> 16/15<br/> 15/14<br/> 12/11<br/> 11/10<br/> 10/9<br/> 9/8<br/> 8/7<br/> 7/6<br/> 6/5<br/> 11/9<br/> 5/4<br/> 14/11<br/> 9/7<br/> 4/3<br/> 11/8<br/> 7/5<br/> 10/7<br/> 16/11<br/> 3/2<br/> 14/9<br/> 11/7<br/> 8/5<br/> 18/11<br/> 5/3<br/> 12/7<br/> 7/4<br/> 16/9<br/> 9/5<br/> 20/11<br/> 11/6<br/> 28/15<br/> 15/8<br/> 40/21<br/> 21/11<br/> 64/33<br/> 96/49<br/> 2/1<br/>------ end Scala file --------</p><p>I&apos;ll have more to say on this when I get more time,<br/>and after I&apos;ve secured a copy of Lydia Ayres&apos;s article<br/>from _1/1_.

Upon re-reading the description in the dissertation,<br/>it seems very possible that Partch himself had written exactly<br/>what Kassel prints:</p><p>&gt; [Kassel 1996, p 39]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In handwritten marginalia on the manuscript of _Exposition_,<br/>&gt; Partch lists another series of dates (presumably of completion)<br/>&gt; for drafts of this treatise (Partch 1933, [ii]): [32]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1928 (San Francisco: #1)<br/>&gt; &gt; 1930 (New Orleans: #2)<br/>&gt; &gt; 1931 (San Francisco: #3)<br/>&gt; &gt; 1932 (Visalia, CA: #4)<br/>&gt; &gt; 1933 (Los Angeles: #5)<br/>&gt;</p><p>And there&apos;s a footnote:</p><p>&gt; [32]  The five drafts mentioned here would have preceded<br/>&gt; the &quot;third draft&quot; (1934-35) mentioned in Partch 1974, vii.</p><p>Kassel states with such assurance that these *are* &quot;dates<br/>for drafts of this treatise&quot;, and in the footnote he so<br/>plainly says &quot;The five drafts mentioned here&quot;, that I&apos;m<br/>inclined to believe that what I quoted above *is* exactly<br/>what Partch wrote.</p><p>But even if Partch wrote only the years, this reasoning makes<br/>sense to me.  If Partch wrote those dates in this draft<br/>intentionally to *be* in this draft, then they can&apos;t mean<br/>anything else but the dates of earlier drafts.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks Monz for all the detective work!</p><p>Glad you enjoyed it, Joe.

You look at a<br/>pattern, you can do it with one hand, you can therefore do it with<br/>the other, they are both equally valid, and if one is less<br/>comfortable then you work on it more until the opportunity right<br/>before your eyes -- mirrored motions, O and U played with<br/>(essentially) equal ease -- becomes the norm.

He may very well have been right handed, but he would<br/>also have known that it would be just as easy to do the opposite, and<br/>would have written accordingly. NONE of this is answering your<br/>question as to whether O or U predominated, and I doubt the mechanics<br/>of the instruments could give a valid answer.
