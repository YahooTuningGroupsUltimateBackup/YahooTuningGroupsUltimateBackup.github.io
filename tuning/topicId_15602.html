Is there any way, though, to make the semi-opaque faces a<br/>&gt;bit more opaque.  One can see through them, but not too well.  I<br/>&gt;think a more opaque face would make the figures even more exciting...</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>I&apos;m still keeping both on the go because the transparent tetrahedra<br/>make quite a difference. However they don&apos;t go so well with the text<br/>at present when the shape is turning.</p><p>As you&apos;ll see, I&apos;ve now made the faces completely opaque.</p><p>It is v. easy to change and I&apos;ll prob. do some more experimentation<br/>of various effects later on (one can also add textures if one wants)</p><p>I wonder if I should make them a little transparent, just slightly so.</p><p>Or alternatively, making them very transparent, so one can see through<br/>fairly clearly, like dark blue glass.</p><p>I&apos;ll see later what ideas arise when I come back to them again fresh<br/>after a spell working on FTS 1.09.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
