I tend to call those where L  &gt; s &gt; L-s as being &apos;meantone&apos;-like, and those where L &gt; L-s &gt;s as being pythagorean. Looking for a moment at two nominals (white notes), the former inserts the black keys in the order sharp-flat (ascending), and the latter as flat-sharp (ascending). The case where L-s = s inserts only one black note, enharmonically sharp and flat.</p><p>What interests me is that we have a scale, viz: LsLsLsLLs, say, and we are looking to deriving a tuning for it. The simple approach is to assign steps of an EDO to it, like L= 2 and s=1. But what about determining a tuning that does not result in an EDO? We can choose to find the generator, in terms of L and s steps (in this case LsLsLsL), but how could one arrive at the narrowest and largest possible values for this interval without destroying the scale?</p><p>The sharps and flats way of looking at a scale gives rise to a stave, and clefs and key signatures, which are independent of the tuning. Just as we can write diatonic music and render it with 12 or 19 or 17 or 31 EDO (subject to some interesting effects of this translation), so we must be able to do with other scales. To write the music chained to a specific EDO locks out the possibility that it could be rendered with a different tuning. We should be thankful that western stave notation permits this possibility: what would we have done by adopting a 12-note notation sometime in the past?</p><p>The above scale is the 9 from 14 that Carl put on the list again. We can envisage a keyboard for it, and derive a (simple) harmonic structure. But how else may we tune it? L=3 s=2, this sets the scale as belonging to 23EDO. Setting L=3 and s=1, we get 19EDO. Other EDOS are possible for different values of L and s, but the 14EDO representation is the simplest. The possibility of writing a work on a stave devised for the LsLsLsLLs scale and then realising it in 14, 23 or 19 could give new insights into microtonal tunings of this scale. We could choose a scale that belongs to an EDO that contains multiple scales, and head off in different directions, merely by reinterpreting the tuning. 34EDO is particularly interesting in this respect.</p><p>This may be obvious to many on the list, but perhaps we should try to invoke microtones without the requirement for complexity that baffles the nontheoretical musician. What the scale with two notes is meant to do is act as a starting point for the exploration of tuning, merely through nominals, sharps and flats.</p><p>Mark</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2005 1:03:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mark,</p><p>What you&apos;re talking about is very familiar to many of us through the<br/>work of Erv Wilson.</p><p>It appears that my decatonic scales don&apos;t fit into this scheme of<br/>yours at all.
