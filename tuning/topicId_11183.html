The onboard software has<br/>facilities for configuring the instrument as a MIDI controller using buttons<br/>and an LCD screen.  The controller itself has sophisticated zoning<br/>capabilities that allow you to configure it for multiple keymaps in a very<br/>flexible way.</p><p>The external Wintel based software is used to make it easier to manage the<br/>complexity of configuring the controller for microtonal use.  There is a<br/>basic tuning editor that can load and save Scala format .scl files and<br/>support for Proteus 1/2/3 series, Proteus 2000 (Audity), Ensoniq MR Rack and<br/>KR-76 and any other MIDI Tuning Standard synths.  Note that Kurzweil series<br/>and Kyma can be programmed to work well with the Uath but the external<br/>tuning setup software currently does not support then specifically.<br/>Numerous algorithms for filling the keymaps with MIDI notes and channels are<br/>provided.</p><p>The software, currently in beta 1.0, is a work in progress that like a good<br/>web page will probably never be finished.  I hope to be porting it to the<br/>Java platform next year so that any computer supporting Sun&apos;s new Java 2<br/>sound specification can be used.</p><p>If you have any questions regarding the Uath or its setup editor that may be<br/>of general interest I will be happy to answer them on the list, otherwise<br/>email me privately.</p><p>-Fred</p><p><a href="mailto:fred.kohler@telus.net">fred.kohler@telus.net</a></p></div>
