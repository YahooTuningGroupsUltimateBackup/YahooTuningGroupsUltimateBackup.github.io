The subject says<br/>...,&amp; another page&quot;, well, I meant to add that I&apos;ve begun collecting<br/>info for a microtonal keyboard home page. Not a Loffink clone,<br/>but rather a collection of info &amp; links to the world of microtonal<br/>keyboards, like the guitar page in preparation. Soon as I have the<br/>guitar thing up, I&apos;ll get on with the keyboard page and let you<br/>know what I&apos;ve got and you can all chip in.</p><p>The guitar page should be up in a few days. I&apos;ll probably quickly<br/>spruce it up a bit, soon as I get some feedback, and more info.<br/>Did I mention it&apos;s not going to be fancy with a lot of graphics,<br/>etc.</p><p>I&apos;ll also post a complete &quot;pre-press&quot; list of the guitarists a couple<br/>of days before I put up the page, so anyone get in some additions.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Drew</p></div>
