The piano is in 12-tET, but the sax can tune in JI<br/>&gt;adaptively.  So pianest plays an ET C, and the sax plays a JI note<br/>&gt;above it.  Then pianist plays an ET F#, and sax plays JI note above<br/>&gt;it--I think adaptive JI melody above ET harmony is actually the most<br/>&gt;common tuning heard in popular music today.</p><p>    Though 87-98% eminiently ;) disposable &amp; excremental, it can be argued<br/>that some Pop Musics chief virtue is it&apos;s willingness to experiment with new<br/>music/sound technologies and ideas.<br/>    I think some pop music is 12tET, quasi-12tET, semi-JI and nonJI/nonET<br/>(nonJI/nonET i.e. digital sampling of noises &amp; playin&apos; them as tonalities,<br/>Industrial/Techno music performance dj-ing, electric guitar hum, feedback and<br/>distortion, using scrap metal percussion and power tools as musical sound/noise<br/>tools - not just percussively and timbrally, also tonally.... ad infinitum).<br/>    Sometimes strange tonalities/scales/modes can be heard in WorldBeat<br/>Techno &amp; Trance (but it seems more for exoticism&apos;s sake than real substanstive<br/>musical depth)... But some Ambient music (esp&apos;ly Robert Rich) is of much higher<br/>quality.</p><p>---<br/>Hanuman Zhang, _Gomi no sensei_ [Master of junk]<br/>&amp; Gatherer of Extremely Enlightening Knowledge (or GEEK, for short ;)</p><p>    &quot;To live is to scrounge, taking what you can in order to survive.
