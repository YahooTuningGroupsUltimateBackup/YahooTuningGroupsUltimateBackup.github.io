In my experience this is one of the more<br/>&gt; intriguing equal temperaments, far more musically interesting than the<br/>&gt; numbers would indicate.  In that regard, 33 falls into the same class as<br/>&gt; 9, 10, 20, 21, 26 and 27 tones per octave: these are all overlooked<br/>&gt; equal temperaments with plenty to offer but very little publicity in the<br/>&gt; theoretical literature.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=25889 href="#25889">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2001 5:58:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; David Finnamore and I were both wowed recently by Herman&apos;s<br/>&gt; 33-EDO version of &quot;Pachelbel&apos;s Canon&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just came across something in a private email from Brian McLaren<br/>&gt; that echoes our sentiments (the capital letters are merely the<br/>&gt; result of output from an old BASIC program):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; FOR + 1/2 COMMA MEANTONE, THE CLOSEST EQUAL TEMPERAMENT IS:<br/>&gt; &gt; 33  TONES / OCT = .2927074432373047  CENTS FROM + 1/2  COMMA<br/>MEANTONE</p><p>Yes, but Herman&apos;s version was not the 1/2-comma meantone usage of 33-tET . . . instead, it<br/>used major thirds of 400 cents.

Even though<br/>the thirds are flatter than the 12-TET thirds are sharp, it does sound<br/>interesting. I added it to my web page under the meantone section.</p></div>
