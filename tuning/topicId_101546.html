(The 9/8 may be between the two 4/3s, or above or below.) This concept has a straightforward generalization to intervals of quasi-equivalence other than 4/3, but these examples are all for the original version with 4/3.</p><p>Clearly any MOS of a temperament with octave period and whose generator is a tempered 4/3, including for example meantone, mavila, and father, is omnitetrachordal. However, there are also omnitetrachordal scales associated with linear temperaments whose generator does not represent 4/3, or whose period is not an octave.</p><p>The following MODMOSes are omnitetrachordal. The temperament names given are merely examples, in that any other temperament with the same structure and the same mapping of 4/3 will also work. For example, Injera[6] LsLsss is omnitetrachordal because it has the same structure as pajara.</p><p>Pajara[6] LsLsss<br/>Pajara[8] LssLssss<br/>Liese[9] LssLsssss<br/>Pajara[10] LsssLsssss (pentachordal decatonic)<br/>Mohajira[10] LLLsLLLsLs<br/>Liese[11] LsssLssssss<br/>Pajara[12] LLLLsLLLLsLL<br/>Shrutar[12] LsssLsssssss<br/>Liese[13] LssssLsssssss<br/>Tetracot[13] LLLssLLLssLss<br/>Shrutar[14] LssssLssssssss<br/>Tritonic[15] LssssLsssssssss</p><p>Note that these are not the most general omnitetrachordal scales, which may not even be rank 2. For example, the pentachordal decatonic pattern, LsssLsssss, could be generalized to LabaLababa where a and b may be different. I believe that omnitetrachordality implies rank &lt;= 3 but I have no proof of this.</p><p>I derived these by hand, because I have no way to mathematically generate all possible omnitetrachordal scales yet. It&apos;s good to have nontrivial examples though.</p><p>Many of these scales are well known, but some are novel. Of particular note is the Liese[9] MODMOS, whose tetrachords strongly resemble those of the ancient Greek enharmonic genus. Thus this scale could be viewed as a filled-in or regularized version of the enharmonic scale.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=101548 href="#101548">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2011 8:37:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Call a scale &quot;omnitetrachordal&quot; if, within any octave span, the pattern of steps within one (tempered) 4/3 is replicated exactly in another 4/3, and the octave is filled in by a 9/8 which may be divided into smaller steps arbitrarily.</p><p>Has anyone ever tried concocting omni-thirds scales, three identical divisions of 5/4 plus the diesis?</p></div><h3><a id=101549 href="#101549">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2011 10:48:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Sep 5, 2011 at 10:09 AM, Keenan Pepper &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note that these are not the most general omnitetrachordal scales, which may not even be rank 2.

This subperiod isn&apos;t infinite in<br/>extent like an actual period, but is repeated only as many times as it<br/>can fit within the period.</p><p>I&apos;ve since gotten the formula even simpler, so here it is:</p><p>1) Pick a sub-period (let&apos;s say 4/3).<br/>2) Pick an MOS generated by that sub-period (let&apos;s say 2L3s).<br/>3) Pick a generator, and make sure that this generator is smaller than<br/>the smallest interval in the MOS (let&apos;s say a semaphore-tempered<br/>28/27, which is also 64/63).<br/>4) Take your MOS and copy and paste it shifted over by the generator.<br/>5) Do #4 as many times as you want, but only as long as the total<br/>number of generators you&apos;re shifting by doesn&apos;t end up being larger<br/>than the side of the smallest interval in #2</p><p>If you screw up #5 and shift too much, to keep it omnitetrachordal<br/>you&apos;ll have to wrap all of the &quot;overstretched&quot; notes around into the<br/>other sub-periodic cells, and if you keep doing this until you get to<br/>an omnitetrachordal scale you&apos;ll end up doing the whole thing again<br/>with just the next-largest choice of MOS in #2.</p><p>This will generate, I think, rank-3 parallelodahsdfh periodicity<br/>blocks, but I&apos;m not sure if there might be an exception to that. I<br/>conjecture that it will and that a correspondence exists between<br/>omnitetrachordal scales and rank-3 periodicity blocks, just like one<br/>exists between MOS&apos;s and rank-2 periodicity blocks. The question of<br/>how rank-2 scales might be viewed as tempered versions of the above<br/>blocks, kind of how blackwood[10] can be viewed as a tempered version<br/>of pythagorean[5] with a generator of 81/80 and then with 256/243<br/>eliminated, is something I&apos;m leaving open as I&apos;m not quite sure if my<br/>conjecture is too overreaching.</p><p>It&apos;s noteworthy that a lot of temperaments generate omnitetrachordal<br/>scales that aren&apos;t related to the MOS series in the temperament at<br/>all. For example, semaphore in 19-equal has an omnitetrachordal scale<br/>at 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 4 1 2, which is 10 notes. It can be viewed as a<br/>chromatically altered version of &quot;semaphore[10]&quot;, despite that<br/>semaphore[10] isn&apos;t an MOS. It&apos;s what you get if you take the 1 2 1 3<br/>1 3 1 3 1 3 near-MOS of semaphore and sharpen the 5th, 6th, 9th, and<br/>10th degrees of the scale.</p><p>These scales might be described as forming &quot;moments of<br/>omnitetrachordality,&quot; but something like &quot;moment of sub-symmetry&quot;<br/>might be better in that it doesn&apos;t form the unfortunate acronym MOO.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101550 href="#101550">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2011 10:53:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Has anyone ever tried concocting omni-thirds scales,<br/>&gt; three identical divisions of 5/4 plus the diesis?</p><p>The tripod scale (or 9 note marvel hobbit) is one such.<br/>Also, various MOS scales in magic temperament (7, 10, 13,<br/>16, 19, or 22 notes).</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=101556 href="#101556">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2011 1:22:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve since gotten the formula even simpler, so here it is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) Pick a sub-period (let&apos;s say 4/3).<br/>&gt; 2) Pick an MOS generated by that sub-period (let&apos;s say 2L3s).<br/>&gt; 3) Pick a generator, and make sure that this generator is smaller than<br/>&gt; the smallest interval in the MOS (let&apos;s say a semaphore-tempered<br/>&gt; 28/27, which is also 64/63).<br/>&gt; 4) Take your MOS and copy and paste it shifted over by the generator.<br/>&gt; 5) Do #4 as many times as you want, but only as long as the total<br/>&gt; number of generators you&apos;re shifting by doesn&apos;t end up being larger<br/>&gt; than the side of the smallest interval in #2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you screw up #5 and shift too much, to keep it omnitetrachordal<br/>&gt; you&apos;ll have to wrap all of the &quot;overstretched&quot; notes around into the<br/>&gt; other sub-periodic cells, and if you keep doing this until you get to<br/>&gt; an omnitetrachordal scale you&apos;ll end up doing the whole thing again<br/>&gt; with just the next-largest choice of MOS in #2.</p><p>Once I realized that it was allowed for some notes of the shifted copies to be coincident, I could see how this generated most of the scales I came up with.
