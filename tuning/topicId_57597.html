Mindful of our recent discussions about John<br/>Harrison using logs to determine frequency-size relations<br/>for bells, I took logs of both variables and plotted them.</p><p>With the assumption that the measurement for A is wrongly<br/>transcribed, and should instead have been 277 mm, all the<br/>frequencies are very nearly proportional to the inverse<br/>square of the length.  The fit of the data is extremely good,<br/>as can be seen by the coefficient of determination being<br/>almost 1.</p><p>Interestingly, the last post in Tom&apos;s page has Dave Chapman<br/>mentioning this exact law, which is useful confirmation.</p><p>If you&apos;d like to make yourself a set of wind chimes, note that<br/>each chime should be suspended at about two-ninths the way<br/>from the end.  (More exactly, so the length is 4.55 times the<br/>distance of the suspension point from the end.)  There are<br/>recipes on the page for constructing two sets of chimes, one<br/>an octave higher, from (US) standard 10-foot lengths of<br/>3/4-inch copper pipe.  As we&apos;ve been all-metric in Oz for<br/>decades, I&apos;m not sure what the standard lengths are, tho we<br/>do use 19mm copper pipe, very nearly 3/4&quot;.</p><p>Spreadsheet attached, in Excel 2000 format.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya<br/>------------------------------------------------<br/>      Yahya Abdal-Aziz<br/>      <a href="mailto:Yahya@MelbPC.Org.Au">Yahya@MelbPC.Org.Au</a><br/>      Melbourne PC User Group<br/>      Member 1075<br/>      Convener, Graphics Interest Group<br/>      Convener, Music Interest Group<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.7.3 - Release Date: 15/3/05</p></div>
