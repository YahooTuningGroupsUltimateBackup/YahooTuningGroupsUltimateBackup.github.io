Yes indeed. As I was working on the .TUN widnow in FTS today, I&apos;ve just added it experimentally to Fractal Tune Smithy for the next release (3.0), as a check box, so users can switch it on if they want.</p><p>Right now, FTS can only send it to other copies of itself to keep the tuning in sync  - but as it would be so easy for soft synths that support .tun to add it in, the idea is that if it is of interest, it could gradually spread as users ask soft synth programmers for the feature - just as the .TUN format itself spread.</p><p>Yes had a look at that link - that&apos;s the sort of thing I mean&apos;t - FTS also does something similar but does it with the pitch bend methods or MTS sysexes. For synths that don&apos;t support those methods but  can be .TUN tuned then it would let you do the same thing with them too.</p><p>I.e. it&apos;s particularly useful for exploring the &quot;Paratactical&quot; tunings of the tuning list blurb :-).</p><p>I may post to kvraudio after the release. I&apos;m a bit pre-occupied with the programming right now.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p><p>&gt; Sounds interesting. Each synth would have to support it?
