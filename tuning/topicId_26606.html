Nevertheless,<br/>I&apos;ll proceed. I&apos;ll put my own observations in square brackets.</p><p>Here&apos;s the abstract:</p><p>&quot;In this study, the relationship between the degree of tempering of<br/>musical intervals and the subjective purity was determined for fifths<br/>and major thirds. The intervals were presented in isolation, that is,<br/>they were not given in a musical context. For two simultaneous<br/>complex tones the relationship  between subjective purity and<br/>tempering could be described by exponential functions. These<br/>functions were obtained both for ratings on a 10-point equal-interval<br/>scale and for subjective distances derived from preference data<br/>collected by means of the method of paired comparisons. To verify to<br/>what extent subjective purity had been determined by interference of<br/>nearby harmonics, the spectral content of the tones was varied. For<br/>both the fifths and the major thirds, interference of the various<br/>pairs of nearly coinciding harmonics was canceled by deletion of the<br/>even harmonics of the higher tone. This deletion resulted in higher<br/>purity ratings, the effect being most prominent for the major third.<br/>A further reduction of the potential interference between harmonics<br/>was still more effective: for simultaneous sinusoidal tones,<br/>subjective differences between pure and tempered intervals were much<br/>smaller than for complex tones. Purity ratings for simultaneous<br/>sinusoids presented at a low sound level were about equal to the<br/>ratings for successive tones. The purity ratings were compared with<br/>dissonance patterns predicted by models for tonal<br/>consonance/dissonance. Only in a few conditions do the patterns<br/>predicted by the model of Plomp and Levelt resemble the rating<br/>patterns obtained, and the dissonance patterns predicted by the model<br/>of Kameoka and Kuriyagawa are at variance with the purity ratings in<br/>all conditions. Suggestions for revision of the models are given.&quot;</p><p>In the introduction, Vos cites his previous research about the<br/>_discriminability_ between pure and tempered intervals. He found,<br/>among other things, that (a) discrimination performance decreases<br/>with increasing sum of p and q (where the pure ratio is p/q); (b)<br/>that (not surprisingly) discriminability is poorer the smaller the<br/>amount of tempering; and (c) that this difference is especially<br/>pronounced for short tone durations (where, I&apos;m guessing, the<br/>intervals with small amounts of tempering fail to complete a full<br/>beat and thus sound completely pure). This study, though, will not be<br/>about discriminability, but about &quot;subjective purity&quot;.</p><p>Vos begins by mentioning some previous studies that relate to the<br/>evaluation of tuning systems. In</p><p>Rasch, R. A. &quot;Description of regular twelve-tone musical tunings&quot;,<br/>JASA Vol. 73 #3 (1983), pp. 1023-1035,</p><p>three measures were used to represent the concept of subjective<br/>purity: quadratic mean tempering, linear mean tempering, and maximum<br/>tempering. The measure of linear mean tempering implies that even a<br/>very small amount of tempering will affect the subjective purity. The<br/>measure of maximum tempering assumes that the worst interval in a<br/>piece of music is the only factor that need be considered when<br/>assessing its subjective purity. [Quadratic mean tempering, as a<br/>measure of purity, represents a compromise between these sets of<br/>assumptions.]</p><p>In</p><p>Hall, D. E. &quot;The objective measurement of goodness-of-fit for tunings<br/>and temperaments&quot;, _Journal of Music Theory_ vol. 17 (1973), pp. 274-<br/>290,</p><p>this quadratic relationship between tempering and &quot;undesirability&quot; is<br/>assumed, but he mentions two possible caveats to this approach. The<br/>first is that some people find just intervals to be &quot;insipid&quot; while<br/>finding slightly tempered intervals to possess greater &quot;warmth&quot;. In</p><p>Roberts, L. A., &amp; Mathews, M. V. &quot;Intonation sensitivity for<br/>traditional and nontraditional chords&quot;, JASA vol. 75 (1984), pp. 952-<br/>959,</p><p>it was found that this effect is important for at least a subset of<br/>the listeners studied. The second caveat is that for intervals<br/>tempered by a large amount [more than about 27 cents, according to<br/>the graph in Vos&apos; article], where the beats are too rapid to be heard<br/>individually, &quot;undesirability&quot; may no longer have any strong<br/>relationship with the amount of tempering, and be roughly constant<br/>instead. Vos concludes this section by noting that neither Hall nor<br/>Rasch attempted to pursue the idea that the effect of tempering<br/>depends on the _kind_ of musical interval, which would suggest using<br/>unequal weights for the different intervals in the purity analysis of<br/>tunings.</p><p>I&apos;ll continue next time with &quot;The Rationale of the Experiments&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=26621 href="#26621">ðŸ”—</a>Mats &#xFFFD;ljare &#x3C;oljare@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/2/2001 3:41:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Goldsmith, David S. &quot;An Electronically Generated Complex Microtonal System &gt;of Horizontal and Vertical Tonality&quot;, Journal of the Audio Engineering &gt;Society vol. 19 no. 10, Nov. 1971, pp. 851-858.</p><p>This must be the paper on 16-tet.I&apos;d like to see this,really strange title though...</p><p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/> MATS &#xFFFD;LJARE<br/> <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/mo/oljare">http://www.angelfire.com/mo/oljare</a></p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a href="http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></p></div><h3><a id=26622 href="#26622">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/2/2001 3:51:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Next Vos discusses the complex effect of musical context on the<br/>perception of roughness and intonation.</p><p>Shackford, C. &quot;Some aspects of perception&quot;, _Journal of Music Theory_<br/>vol. 5 pp. 162-202, vol. 6 pp. 66-90, 295-303</p><p>finds that the musical functions of the intervals, whether a piece is<br/>tonal or atonal, and the specific ways in which diminished fifths and<br/>augmented fourths are resolved, all seem to influence the intonation<br/>behavior of string players. Vos claims [quite sensibly] that detailed<br/>knowledge of the relationship between tempering and purity for<br/>isolated intervals may faciliate [provide a basis of reference for?]<br/>the interpretation of Shackford&apos;s results.</p><p>Vos&apos; hypothesis for his experiments is that subjective purity of<br/>isolated intervals depends both on the sensation of beats and<br/>roughness, and on the perception of the actual size of the interval.<br/>Specifically, Vos found in previous research that for temperings<br/>larger than about 25 cents, the _direction_ of tempering could be<br/>identified (wide or narrow), so he hypothesizes that for such<br/>deviations, the subjective purity will be low _regardless_ of the<br/>spectral content of the tones.
