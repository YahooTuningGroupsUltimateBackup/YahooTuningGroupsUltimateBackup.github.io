This seems highly<br/>unlikely for several reasons.<br/>    First, Carter Scholz wrote a routine for JICalc<br/>which sounds pitches when the user clicks on specific<br/>points in the ratio-space representation of a tuning.<br/>This upgrade to JICalc appeared, if memory serves,<br/>someime around 1993.<br/>     However, shortly thereafter Carter Scholz wrote<br/>a much more comlex HMSL program which he used to realize<br/>his composition LATTICE 3327. Carter&apos;s program uses real-<br/>time calculations and multiple MIDI channels to send<br/>out pitch-ebnd messages which retune successive notes<br/>of a DX7II equipped witht he E! board to any desired<br/>point in a 7-dimensional ratio space.<br/>      Moreover, Carter&apos;s HMSL program not only generates<br/>pitches corresponding to those ratio-space coordinates in<br/>7 dimensions, it also uses a variety of different metrics<br/>to evaluate so-called &quot;harmonic complexity&quot; in 7-D ratio space.<br/>The user can choose which metric is used by hitting keys<br/>on the computer keyboard.<br/>      Lastly, Carter&apos;s HMSL program navigated 7-D ratio<br/>space according to gradients which pointed in the direction<br/>of &quot;more complexity&quot; (using the current measure) or &quot;less<br/>complexity&quot; and also by specifying the general algorithm.<br/>If memory serves, drunakrd&apos;s walk and Levy flight and several<br/>others were the choices available.<br/>      -----<br/>      Doubtless others prior to Carter Scholz in late 1993<br/>did these sorts of things. My vague suspicion is that the<br/>League of Automated Composers did something like this on<br/>their KIM-1s back the late 1970s, but an early computer composer<br/>at a university in British Columbia did something similar even<br/>earlier using real-time FM on a PDP-11.<br/>      ------<br/>      The important point, however, remains that whomever<br/>invented this particular wheel, the wheel itself has 4 sides<br/>and is made out of marshmallow. This wheel don&apos;t work, kiddies.<br/>      My own experience with using Csound to realize various<br/>precompositional studies in ratio space around 1994 gave rise<br/>to the dark suspicion that ratio space metrics bore no audible<br/>relationship to anything the human ear can hear.<br/>      Subsequent double-blind listening tests, using a Turbo Pascal<br/>program which renamed and scrambeld audio files and wrote a record<br/>of the new names to a text file which could be examined later,<br/>clinched my suspicion that ratio space involves mathematical<br/>chimerai which do not relate to anything the human ear can hear.<br/>       Consequently, manipulations of departed mathematical ghosts<br/>in ratio space prove musically meaningless. Ratio space itself<br/>constitutes an ignis fatuus as far as actual music is concerned --<br/>a delusion with no discernible relation to either the roughness<br/>of intervals, pitch height, logarithmic interval width, or any<br/>other known property of msuical intervals or individual musical<br/>pitches.<br/>       NOTA BENE: Representations of TUNINGS in ratio space can<br/>exhibit some useful info -- for instance, you can see quickly whether<br/>the JI tuning is subharmonic or harmonic or symmetrical (viz., has as<br/>many utonal as otonal pitches), etc.<br/>        However, in terms of extracting useful musical info via<br/>mathematical operations in ratio space, this is not possible, any<br/>more than it is possible to turn lead into gold by chanting various<br/>incantations, or to detect the luminferous ether with the proper<br/>arrangement of interferometers and mirrors.<br/>        Fokker&apos;s introduction of 3-D ratio space followed the much<br/>earlier use of 2-D ratio space by Hugo Riemann and other German<br/>theorists even earlier in the 19th century.  As far as illustrating<br/>abstract properties of musical *SCALES*, these diagrams had some<br/>limited use and served some very limited purporse.<br/>        When people unwisely moved on from diagramming scales to<br/>trying to use ratio space to compose music or extract information<br/>about actual musical properties of intervals, the whole enterprise<br/>headed into the ditch and wound up spinning its wheels in the mud.<br/>        Some people periodically claim &quot;Oh, no, I create music using<br/>ratio space lattices...&quot;  Experience has shown that ratio space<br/>diagrams and/or lattices represent a debilitating hurdle, rather than<br/>a facilitating tool which helps people compose music. The proof is<br/>clear and straightforward -- all the people who avoid using ratio<br/>space compose much more music than the people who try to use ratio<br/>space to compose music. This is no coincidence. Ratio space<br/>represents a roadblock, a pothole on the road to composition, as much<br/>of a conceptual barrier to composing music as the notion of<br/>phlogiston was to creating a valid science of thermodynamics.<br/>---------<br/>--mclaren</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/2001 12:00:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;       The important point, however, remains that whomever<br/>&gt; invented this particular wheel, the wheel itself has 4 sides<br/>&gt; and is made out of marshmallow.

Distance in the lattice doesn&apos;t reflect<br/>perception, at least for triangular lattices.   Tenney complexity<br/>is the only simple metric for JI that seems to work well enough<br/>to mean anything, and its visualization as a lattice metric<br/>would require... thinking about volumes in an octave-specific<br/>rectangular lattice, I guess... or city block distance on an<br/>octave-specific rectangular lattice whose rungs are scaled by<br/>the log of their vector class (&apos;zthat right, Paul?)?</p><p>&gt;        Consequently, manipulations of departed mathematical ghosts<br/>&gt; in ratio space prove musically meaningless.
