I&apos;m a fretless bass guitar player<br/>who&apos;s considering taking up oud/barbat as well. I also come up with ideas<br/>for exotic musical instruments (I&apos;d love to be able to build a fretless bajo<br/>sexto/oud hybrid).</p><p>I came up with a &quot;unjust intonation&quot; or &quot;ill-tempered&quot; scale last night, and<br/>retuned some Beethoven MIDI files with interesting results. It&apos;s a<br/>distortion of 12-tone:</p><p>C 1/1<br/>Db 28/27<br/>D 10/9<br/>Eb 7/6<br/>E 11/9<br/>F 4/3<br/>Gb 11/9<br/>G 3/2<br/>Ab 14/9<br/>A 5/3<br/>Bb 7/4<br/>B 11/6<br/>C&apos; 2/1</p><p>So it&apos;s a mixture of 3&apos;s, 5&apos;s, 7&apos;s and 11&apos;s. The inspiration: Arabic and<br/>Iranian scales with the quarter-step flat E and B, and other notes lowered<br/>by syntonic and septimal commas to smooth it out.</p><p>Which leads to what should I call quintal, septimal and undecimal intervals<br/>in terms of colors. I call Pythagorean notes &quot;black&quot;, 5-limit notes &quot;red&quot;<br/>(or &quot;brown&quot;), 7-limit notes &quot;green&quot;, and 11-limit notes &quot;blue&quot;. But I&apos;m<br/>thinking of reversing &quot;green&quot; and &quot;blue&quot;. What do you think?</p><p>I&apos;m experimenting with a 41-tone 11-limit scale right now. I had been doing<br/>so much with 53-tone 5-limit before...</p><p>~Danny~</p><p>God creates; Mankind discovers.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2003 4:16:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Heya Danny,</p><p>&gt;I was a member of this list as a beginner a long time ago,</p><p>Remember that.</p><p>&gt;and made a fool of myself, so I left so I could study on my own...</p><p>Don&apos;t remember that.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m soon to move to Austin, TX with my newlywed wife,</p><p>Congrats on both accounts.
