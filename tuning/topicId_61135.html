Recall that<br/>Bach&apos;s time for tuning a whole harpsichord was 15 minutes.

Therefore, there could never be a<br/>situation where Bach arrives at a key that *requires* retuning. Why<br/>spend time on what is unnecessary?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Now, Ozan&apos;s original point was about the *organ* where there are<br/>&gt; &gt; indeed no works in C# major and very few which modulate anywhere near<br/>&gt; &gt; that key.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which suggests he was not so willing to experiment with keys in an<br/>&gt; instrument with a fixed tuning.

Or that Bach&apos;s preferred organ tuning was *different*<br/>from the harpsichord tuning. Or that due to the stinginess of the town<br/>council he never did get an organ tuned just how he wanted it. Or any<br/>number of reasons. You can&apos;t really deduce anything from organ to<br/>harpsichord or vice versa.</p><p>There is a famous report of Bach playing on a Hildebrandt organ around<br/>1740 in which he played successive movements in D minor, E flat minor<br/>and E minor. [In, of course, the same tuning.] This was unheard-of at<br/>the time in organist circles. Hildebrandt was the most modern and<br/>advanced organ builder who actually consulted with Bach about tuning.<br/>We can deduce with some certainty that very few, or zero, organs<br/>before then had a really circular tuning which would allow this. That<br/>didn&apos;t prevent Bach from tuning his harpsichord in such a way as to<br/>allow playing the WTC all the way through.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=61318 href="#61318">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2005 1:41:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; you&apos;d end the WTC about a semitone and a half above<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the starting pitch!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Only if you assume Bach was incompetent.</p><p>&gt; It is you who is making the assumption that Bach was unable or<br/>&gt; unwilling to tune in a way that *did not need* retuning between each<br/>&gt; piece.</p><p>No, I merely am suggesting it&apos;s possible that he sometimes did.<br/>Assuming that if he were to do such a thing he&apos;s end up a semitone and<br/>a half off is assuming he would retune incompetently.
