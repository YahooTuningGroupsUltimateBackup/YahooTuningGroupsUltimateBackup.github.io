(and others which I&apos;ve deleted) and posed the question</p><p>&gt; &gt;Which would singers/strings/winds &quot;naturally&quot; tend to,<br/>&gt; &gt;and which as a composer or director would you coerce<br/>&gt; &gt;them to tennd to?<br/>&gt;</p><p>to which John Link replied...</p><p>&gt; My conjecture is number 2), to which could be added a D at 9/8 to make it<br/>&gt; even more stable:<br/>&gt;</p><p>and Paul Ehrlich answered...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would use (3) if I wanted to be conventional though (1) would have a nice<br/>&gt; &quot;periodicity buzz&quot; reinforcing the tonic. I think it is helpful (as I was<br/>&gt; just explaining to Jim Savage) to look at all the intervals within the chord<br/>&gt; -- looking at just the ratios relative to the root obscures what is<br/>&gt; happening wih all the other intervals.</p><p>Bingo. I plugged them in last night and played with them and the issue<br/>was that ALL the fifths and major thirds were important, and other things<br/>(like &quot;Cminor&quot;) less so.</p><p>The crux of the problem is that there is an augmented triad. B D# G and<br/>D# is punning Eb. The tuning I ended up preferring was</p><p>1/1  3/2   [*]   15/8   45/32</p><p>where [*] is 15/16*sqrt(8/5) (which is pretty close to 19/16 and closer<br/>to 32/27).</p><p>I believe that singers would somehow &apos;minimize&apos; the errors across all the<br/>notes, which starts suggesting a temperment. In fact 12tet has a great<br/>solution to both &quot;fifths&quot; and &quot;augmented triads&quot;.</p><p>53 equal has a minor third available between 6/5 and 7/6, somewhere<br/>in the 13/11, 19/16, 32/27 region. This also perfectly bisects the span<br/>of 3/2 to 15/8. So in 53tet the notes would be</p><p>0 31 53+13 53+48 106+26</p><p>or in cents</p><p>0<br/>702<br/>1200+294<br/>1200+1087<br/>2400+589</p><p>For what its worth, the pitch 26 in 53 is &quot;most likely to be heard<br/>as&quot; a 7/5 which is an interesting identity in 53, 15/8*3/2=7/5.</p><p>thanks.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3>Paul H.

I think that this kind of chord may be mask few<br/>different chords, those chords depend of chord before and chord after<br/>it. I don&apos;t work on this chord before today, but I think it&apos;s an<br/>interesting subject.<br/>I can imagine this example :<br/>between a I&#xFFFD; chord and a IV&#xFFFD; chord it may be an altered note (#G in C<br/>major), we suppose that first chord is &quot;4-5-6&quot; (C-E-G), and second chord<br/>is &quot;3-4-5&quot; (C-F-A)<br/>it gives :</p><p>18--20</p><p>15--16</p><p>12--12</p><p>then G-A is 18-20</p><p>I think it&apos;s coherent to say that G is &quot;19&quot;</p><p>then the augmented triad is &quot;12-15-19&quot;</p><p>12-15 is far of tempered intonation, but 15-19 is just near temperered<br/>third (if I remember well, a little bit bigger, 409 cents?).</p><p>What do you think of this example? did you ever try to ear it?

Is that the solution to an<br/>&gt; optimization problem that you posed?</p><p>The augmented triad was formed by 3/2 15/8 [*] (3/2).</p><p>The 8/5 comes from (3/2)/(15/8). The root seemed like a sensible cut<br/>point (splitting the error on both major thirds), and hte 15/16 steps<br/>it down to the proper point relative to the 15/8.</p><p>&gt; How do you think the chord would tune if a D were added at 9/8, as I<br/>&gt; suggested in order to increase stability?<br/>&gt;</p><p>The 9/8 certainly is &quot;in the pocket&quot; with all tones EXCEPT for [*]. I<br/>don&apos;t think the complexity of the semitone will warrant [*] becoming<br/>a more abrasive major third by slipping in either direction.</p><p>Just to show the range of values we&apos;re dealing with, the three<br/>choices I thought were &quot;making it&quot;, shown with the &quot;minor third&quot;<br/>they are, and the major thirds they create. To my ears, having one<br/>of the major thirds climb up the hill more than offset whatever<br/>plaeasurable effect is given by the other side climbing down the<br/>hill, which is why I ended up preferring the &apos;root&apos;.</p><p>                     major thirds<br/>&quot;Eb&quot;       value   from 15/8 and 3/2<br/>19/16      1.1875   1.267   1.2632<br/>32/27      1.1852   1.264   1.2656<br/> [*]       1.1859   1.2649  1.2649</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
