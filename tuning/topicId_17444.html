My wife, one of the biggest non-techies in the world, became hooked on hers because of those values -- she is now able to record rehearsals, practice, concerts of her quartet, *all* without my assistance and have fairly high-quality, indexed and accessible discs to listen to and study.</p><p>There is /no/ comparison in the quality of the recordings: DAT wins hands down every time. But it you are recording for &apos;documentary&apos; or study purposes, the low-cost factor and ease of use far outweigh the downside of the lossy compression that the MD format utilizes.</p><p>I originally thought to get her a portable DAT, but size, cost (never having caught on with the public, DAT remains a format for professional and very serious amateur recording, and therefore there has never been reason for pricing to be driven down -- not to mention the more mechanical the format, the larger the unit, higher battery drain, etc.)</p><p>I use two different DAT machines in-house and the MD for fun. I&apos;ll reply to Jacky about the specs for xfer off-list, and hope I haven&apos;t taken up too much bandwidth on this non-tuning topic...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div>
