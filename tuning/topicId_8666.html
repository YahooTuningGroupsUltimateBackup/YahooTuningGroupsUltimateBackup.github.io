First, the sheer volume says that<br/>this feller has been hard at work; makes me feel like I need to get on<br/>it a bit more. But, the volume of music wouldn&apos;t matter if it wasn&apos;t any<br/>good, and from my first listens, there&apos;s some really valid stuff here.<br/>Microtonal Music Volume 6 has some lovely pieces; not only are there<br/>some very exotic tunings represented (such as 43 and 641 limit JI,  and<br/>modes of a tube), but the compositions themselves are very<br/>creative...it&apos;s very futuristic sounding electronic synth music. The<br/>synth programming itself is quite good as well...very rich sounding<br/>timbres, with a lot of variety.  There are six volumes of various micro<br/>tunings, including a CD with a short cut in every ET from 5-53, discs<br/>with more examples of unusual tunings, including modes of a sphere and<br/>the 33rd root of 5,  and a 5 volume set of piano works titled 240 Piano<br/>Pieces, featuring ET&apos;s 5-53 again, but with each tuning being<br/>represented by 5 piano compositions...yow. There&apos;s a lot more, too,<br/>including a disc featuring some of the San Diego crew in various<br/>performing combinations.<br/>    I would be surprised if I liked every single piece by the time I<br/>listen to it all, but the overall scope of this collection is very<br/>broad, with a lot of microtonal variety. I am delighted to see the music<br/>being documented on CD, as that, to me, is what it&apos;s all about...theory<br/>in practice. McLaren&apos;s address is 2462 S.E. Micah Place, Corvallis,<br/>Oregon, 97333-1966-17. He has been quite generous in sharing his music<br/>with me over the years, and I imagine if folks write him expressing<br/>interest, he&apos;d share with you, too...check it out, it&apos;s worth the<br/>effort...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=8675 href="#8675">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2000 4:03:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Tuners1<br/>    I wholly agree with Neal.
