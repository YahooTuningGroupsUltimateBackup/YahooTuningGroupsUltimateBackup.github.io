This is just my opinion, but 15/8 and 5/3 are both a third from<br/>a fifth, and are the same distance from 1/1 (along with 16/15 and 6/5).<br/>Consider the chords - maj7 and 6. They certaintly have different flavors,<br/>but one is not more dissonant than the other. Besides, I designed my system<br/>not to be so much a measure of consonance as a measure of how much<br/>modulation one would need to do to &quot;get there&quot;.</p><p>Stay Tuned,<br/>    Keenan</p></div>
