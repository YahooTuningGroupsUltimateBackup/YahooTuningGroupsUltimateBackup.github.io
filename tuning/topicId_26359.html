How does it work?</p><p>The variable length idea of course won&apos;t work if the<br/>order of the messages can be changed.</p><p>I know that sometimes the order of messages in a midi file<br/>can be shuffled in transmission as Quicktime did that for<br/>the order of a sequence of note ons and note offs specified<br/>as simultaneous in one of my midi files. The file had<br/>a note that was switched on and then immediately switched<br/>off in the same time moment, so it was a situation one<br/>wouldn&apos;t ordinarily encounter, and I was grateful for<br/>Quicktime for highlighting the bug that lead to my program<br/>doing that.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
