Two other gods pair to produce the ideal complement to<br/>&gt; the ratio of Itar to akkan (15:14): these are the second<br/>&gt; number for Anu, 21 and the number for ama, 20. Their<br/>&gt; ratio 21:20 gives 84.47 cents, which added to the ratio<br/>&gt; of 15:14 = 119,44 cents, adds up exactly to 203.91 cents.<br/>&gt; This is the so-called Pythagorean tone which equates to<br/>&gt; the Greek ratio of 9:8.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is clear, therefore that in spite of the fact that the<br/>&gt; Greek Pythagorean tone was a fundamental ratio in their<br/>&gt; harmonic series of 12:9:8:6, the structure of their semitones<br/>&gt; was not as simple as the Babylonian system.</p><p>I am extremely interested in all this, having done a lot of<br/>research into (and speculation on) Sumerian and Babylonian<br/>tuning theory.

In this case, the whole-tone<br/>of ratio 9:8 has its terms multiplied by 5 so that the ratio<br/>becomes 45:40, and a division represented by 42 is inserted<br/>between them, to produce an upper ratio of 45:42 = 15:14<br/>and a lower ratio of 42:40 = 21:20.</p><p>My hypothesis is that the Greek division of semitones was<br/>indeed originally as simple as the Babylonian, and in fact<br/>may have actually *been* the Babylonian. It was the later<br/>theories of Pythagoras (or the pythagorians, if in fact<br/>Pythagoras is a mythical person, which he may have been)<br/>which mandated that all ratios be based on factors of only<br/>2 and 3, which limited their construction of semitone division<br/>to the now well-known pythagorean ratios.</p><p>For my own insight into the earliest known Greek<br/>writings on tuning division, see my paper on Philolaus<br/>in _Xenharmonikon 18_, portions of which appear in this<br/>webpage:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/philolaus.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/philolaus.aspx</a></p><p>BTW, it&apos;s probably better to migrate this whole discussion<br/>to the main tuning list, as this one is supposed to be focused<br/>on the actual making of microtonal music. So i&apos;ve cross-posted<br/>this post to the main list, and encourages response to go there.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2007 4:24:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I am extremely interested in all this, having done a lot of<br/>&gt; research into (and speculation on) Sumerian and Babylonian<br/>&gt; tuning theory.
