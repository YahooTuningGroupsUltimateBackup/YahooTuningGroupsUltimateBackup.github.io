One<br/>would have to go to 7-limit tonal-ji to find those intervals from the tonic.<br/>In 7-limit tonal-ji there are no less than 20 intervals from the tonic.<br/>But it is fairly clear to me that these intervals are seldomly or more<br/>likely never used in common practice classical music.</p><p>I started with a blank page when creating my theory, focussing on tuning and<br/>logic behind tuning only.<br/>I took the position beforehand that normal harmonic theory must be wrong<br/>since it can&apos;t do JI properly.<br/>If others have failed the past centuries / millenia in decribing working JI,<br/>then I&apos;m not going to succeed with thesame line of thinking used up till<br/>now.<br/>Since I beleif tuning to be the basis of music and that music is perfect,<br/>then normal harmonic theory must have errors, is my line of reasoning.<br/>I think these kinds of things we&apos;re talking about now are the errors of<br/>normal harmonic theory in naming these chords and putting them in correct<br/>location relevant to the tonic.<br/>This is what I belief is the main error of normal harmonic theory, the often<br/>wrong placement of the tonic and the resulting wrong determining of<br/>modulations etc.</p><p>When I say there is no II7 chord, it&apos;s mainly a name thing.<br/>In my theory one can play exactly thesame thing as in normal harmonic<br/>theory, only the tonics and modulations become different.<br/>And as a result one can play the thing in tonal-ji in perfect tune.<br/>Something impossible with normal harmonic theory as it produces out of tune<br/>music.<br/>Normal harmonic theory isn&apos;t mathematically consistent.

I do wish to achieve something in my life that I hold important<br/>and that has become JI. Further my main other hope is simply that music<br/>theory and JI progresses, wether this is due to my research or to anybody<br/>elses research is irrelevant to me.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=85298 href="#85298">ðŸ”—</a>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2009 7:33:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>(this thread has gone another direction but I reply here to Ozan&apos;s<br/>message on19th of november) -</p><p>Dear Ozan,<br/>I am not certain to understand your question, so please ask again if<br/>I missed the point !<br/>Anyway I realize I have done some shortcuts in my initial message<br/>(below), that I will try to develop now - in my limited english.</p><p>When I say, in my comment on 64 : 75 : 88 : 104 : 128 : 192  as a<br/>differentially-coherent recurrent sequence :<br/>&gt; &quot;and so on where x^2 = 8(x - 1) that has 4 - 2^(1/2) =<br/>1,171572875254 as solution&quot;<br/>That&apos;s a langage shortcut.<br/>75 - 64 = 11,<br/>88 - 75 = 13<br/>104 - 88 = 16<br/>128 - 104 = 24<br/>and the same is found for many differentially-coherent similar series<br/>(such as 35 : 41 : 48 : 56 : 64 etc.), that verify<br/>Hn = 8H(n-1) - 8 H(n-2)<br/>where H(n-2), H(n-1), Hn , etc. are successive terms of one series<br/>(ex: 88 = 600 - 512,    then 104 = 704 -600,    128 = 832 - 704, etc.)<br/>Now if many whole numbers series verify this precise algorithm, there<br/>is only one solution x = Hn  / H(n-1)  that does it for all terms<br/>together, which means that  in a serie such as :  1  :  x  :  x^2  :<br/>x^3 ... :  x^n,<br/> x satisfies the equation  x2 = 8x - 8<br/>and this is  x = 4 - 2^(1/2) = 1,171572875254</p><p>But  the various Hn  / H(n-1)  ratios do not need to equal x  to be<br/>coherent intervals in the series, nor even to converge towards x :<br/>75/64,  88/75,  104/88 ... actually diverge rapidly away from x.</p><p>Now, scales differential coherence properties certainly do not need<br/>that a scale follows a recurrent sequence,<br/>(as 64 : 75 : 88 : 104 : 128 : 192 does).<br/>However many traditional scales, more than we think, can be found in<br/>various differentially-coherent recurrent sequences.<br/>Let&apos;s take one simple example with a basic harmonic scale :<br/>1/1<br/>9/8<br/>5/4<br/>3/2<br/>7/4<br/>2/1<br/>This pentatonic scale can be resumed as 5 : 6 : 7 : 8 : 9 : 10<br/>and is a highly -c scale, but can be qualified as trivial, and evenboring ! - because all differentials mostly focus on one term and its<br/>octaves, (here 8, and more rarely 6) :<br/>class (n-1) = 1<br/>class (n-2) = 2<br/>class (n-3) = 3 (better)<br/>class (n-4) = 4</p><p>Despite its class (n-1) intervals (2nds) being very unequal, here is<br/>one recurrent series that includes the scale :<br/>32 : 36 : 40 : 48 : 56 : 64 : 73 : 83 : 99 : 113 : 129  (the 6 first<br/>6 terms resume to 8 : 9 : 10 : 12 : 14 : 16)<br/>Hn = H(n-1) + 1/4 H(n-5)<br/>(= Slendra, or x^5 = x^4 + 1/4, solution 1.1452994122)</p><p>Its class (n-2) intervals are more even and here is another recurrent<br/>series that includes the scale,<br/>and two possible algorithms :<br/>3 : 4 : 5 : 7 : 9 : 12 : 16 : 21 : 28 : 37 : 49 ...
