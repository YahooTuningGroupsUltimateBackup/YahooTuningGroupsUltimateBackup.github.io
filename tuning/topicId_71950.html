The enthusiasm demonstrated by our audiences was a sign<br/>that<br/>our mission to promote the composition, performance and study of<br/>microtonal<br/>music is a viable one. To the many of you who helped with the 2006-2007<br/>season, we wish to extend our deepest gratitude.</p><p>The founder of BMS, Joseph Maneri, retired from the New England<br/>Conservatory<br/>of Music  this spring after almost forty years of tireless and<br/>passionate<br/>teaching of harmony, counterpoint, improvisation, and, of course, his<br/>legendary microtonal course -- the only one of its kind in the country.<br/>His<br/>teaching has inspired a host of composers, improvisers, performers and<br/>teachers.  We are thrilled to announce that NEC has appointed composer<br/>Julia<br/>Werntz, BMS Artistic Director and member of the Northeastern University<br/>faculty, to take over Joe&iuml;&iquest;&half;s classes in microtonal composition and<br/>performance, and thus continue to introduce this vital musical language<br/>to<br/>young musicians.</p><p>We are happy to report that the Boston Microtonal Society was recently<br/>awarded a prestigious grant from the French-American Fund for<br/>Contemporary<br/>Music (FACE), in partial support of our upcoming fall program, &iuml;&iquest;&half;The<br/>French-American Link,&iuml;&iquest;&half; celebrating that connection in microtonal music<br/>by<br/>French composers Alain Bancquart (member of BMS board of directors),<br/>Pascale<br/>Criton, Jean-Francois Charles, Franck Yeznikian, and Americans Jason<br/>Eckhardt, Julia Werntz, and myself.  We hope to be able to host some of<br/>the<br/>composers during the week of the concert to work with our players, and<br/>also<br/>to enable their participation in a symposium at one of our local<br/>universities.</p><p>As we prepare for the 2007-2008 concert series, we would like to ask you<br/>to<br/>join us by contributing to our annual fund. The FACE grant represents an<br/>important part of our season budget, but your financial support is<br/>urgently<br/>needed in order for us to bring our projects to fruition.
