The second El Paso Microhoot went well and was<br/>fun.  Not too well-organized, but enjoyable nevertheless.</p><p>All three of my presentations (lecture on Robert Johnson,<br/>lecture on Sumerian tuning, and performance of _Spider_,<br/>which was repeated on Saturday) were quite successful.<br/>Bill Wesley&apos;s presentation on his interval/emotion theory<br/>was really outstanding, IMO.</p><p>Harold Fortuin&apos;s segment, entitled &quot;Split-Key Soup&quot;,<br/>included a pointed and very funny social satire piece<br/>combining Dizzy Gillespie&apos;s _Night in Tunisia_ with<br/>_Bali H&apos;ai_, in 22-equal, and also several other original<br/>compositions as well as Clavette transcriptions of an<br/>archicembalo piece by Vicentino, a piano piece by Mandelbaum,<br/>and a guitar piece by Darreg.</p><p>Stephen James Taylor presented an ambitious new piece<br/>that was very good, as well as the film-clips we saw in<br/>April at Microfest.  Kraig Grady gave several excellent<br/>improvs.  Jonathan Glasier gave a good workshop on overtone<br/>singing, as well as a couple of pieces/improvs with Bill,<br/>one of which (_Aftermath_) was quite good.</p><p>Barbara Hero and Robert did their usual gig, Erv demonstrated<br/>the harmonic series on the tubulong in one talk and discussed<br/>Pascal&apos;s Triangle in another, Scott Hackelman explained his<br/>clavichord and played a nice Indian piece, and Ed Borasky<br/>presented Dave Keenan&apos;s Tumbling Dekany in 3-D (interesting),<br/>and his own _When Harry Met Iannis_, an algorithmic stochastic<br/>piece based on rules derived from aspects of Partch&apos;s and<br/>Xenakis&apos;s work.  I think that covers everything.</p><p>It was good to see everyone there!  Looking forward to<br/>the next microtonal get-together, which rumor right now<br/>has scheduled for Oregon sometime next year.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=29978 href="#29978">ðŸ”—</a>Ed Borasky &#x3C;znmeb@aracnet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/6/2001 9:57:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>[snip]</p><p>&gt; It was good to see everyone there!  Looking forward to<br/>&gt; the next microtonal get-together, which rumor right now<br/>&gt; has scheduled for Oregon sometime next year.</p><p>That is the hope, anyhow :-) Now that there are *two* Oregon<br/>microtonalists, it seems like a good idea. My piece is available on<br/>the web at</p><p>  <a href="http://www.borasky-research.net/HarryIannis.mp3">http://www.borasky-research.net/HarryIannis.mp3</a></p><p>with a PowerPoint wrapper at</p><p>  <a href="http://www.borasky-research.net/HarryIannis.htm">http://www.borasky-research.net/HarryIannis.htm</a></p><p>On another note, I&apos;m looking into the possibility of a<br/>microtonal &quot;jam&quot; over the Internet. The MPEG-4 Structured<br/>Audio &quot;sfront&quot; pre-processor now has some primitive capabilities of<br/>this nature. See</p><p>  <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lazzaro/sa/sfman/user/network/index.html">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lazzaro/sa/sfman/user/network/index.html</a></p><p>for the (extremely) gory details. Most of the publicly-available SAOL<br/>instruments use MIDI control, and can be (fairly) easily hacked to<br/>honor pitch bends. Once I get a little free time, I&apos;ll post these<br/>hacked instruments.<br/>--<br/>&quot;Suppose that tonight, while you sleep, a miracle happens Â– you wake<br/>up tomorrow with what you have longed for! How will you discover that<br/>a miracle happened? How will your loved ones? What will be different?<br/>What will you notice? What do you need to explode into tomorrow with<br/>grace, power, love, passion and confidence?&quot; -- Michael Hall, PhD</p><p>M. Edward (Ed) Borasky<br/>Relax!
