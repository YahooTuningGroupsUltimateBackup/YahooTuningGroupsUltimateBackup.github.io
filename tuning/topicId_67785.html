It was partly motivated by the observation that many scales in the SCALA archive are trivalent, and many are also quadrivalent, or more.</p><p>I had the idea of a generator involving two intervals such as 5/4 6/5 alternating,<br/>1/1 5/4 3/2,<br/>which you then repeat as:<br/>1/1 5/4 3/2 15//8 9/8 45/32 27/16<br/>which is where the scale you found on the tunesmithy site comes from.<br/>That is trivalent, as you can check in Scala.</p><p>If you continue a bit further you get another trivalent &quot;moment of symmetry&quot; at seventeen notes.</p><p>So the method produces a few trivalent scales, but is only moderately successful.</p><p>You can read more about my alternating generators method here:<br/><a href="http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/fts_help/More_scales.htm#mos">http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/fts_help/More_scales.htm#mos</a></p><p>Dan followed another line of investigation which was far more successful and he could produce many trivalent scales to order. However I got busy with programming and he took a long break not long after so the discussion got rather broken off, and I can&apos;t say I understand his method quite yet. Also since then I have been so pre-occupied with programming FTS and particularly the upcoming FTS 3.0 release that I have done little by way of further scales explorations.</p><p>I added that programming to FTS as part of the process of investigation. I see that II didn&apos;t explain the situation properly in the help. I just explained how the option in FTS works. To give the context properly, I should have explainedhat what I  was describing is just one of two current candidates for a notion of Hyper MOS, and give the reader some pointer to Dan&apos;s more successful method</p><p>Anyway, he is the one to ask, as I think his version is probably a better candidate for the label &quot;Hyper MOS&quot; as it is more successful at generating trivalent scales.</p><p>This is Dan Stearn&apos;s Eureka post about his Hyper MOS method:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/16585">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/16585</a><br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/19361">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/19361</a></p><p>Then it got taken up again on the tuning-math list in a discussion of &quot;Tribonacci scales&quot;. But I hadn&apos;t got the time to follow the discussion there either.</p><p>I hope I get a chance to get back to this some time. It would be great to program Dan&apos;s method as well as mine.</p><p>He also had an interesting conjecture that every trivalent scale with an even number of notes has to contain an irrational interval, and later I think he concluded that it has to be a subset of an n-et as well, so if that is so, the rational hyper-mos&apos;s have to have an odd number of notes.</p><p>Unfortunately I haven&apos;t go tthe time to join in discussing it at present either. But if anyone feels they could summarize the conclusions and describe it to me -  the construction algorithm for his scales - sufficiently so that I can program it, then I&apos;m interested to program it in FTS, and should do to complement my own less successful method. Or later once I have the time to read it all up and get  up to date with it. Also I wonder if it might be in Scala by now?</p><p>Meanwhile anyway I&apos;ll add a note to the help and to the window in FTS to make it clear that Dan Stearns method exists and is probably a better candidate for the term &quot;hyper MOS&quot;</p><p>Robert</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: Wednesday, October 25, 2006 11:50 AM<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Digest Number 4177</p><p>  Welcome to the Alternate Tunings Mailing List.<br/>  Messages In This Digest (6 Messages)<br/>    1a.

What do you think?</p><p>    Sounds good, except I don&apos;t like the part about the fundamental&apos;s<br/>    absolute pitch. First off, what happens if it isn&apos;t a power<br/>    of 3? Secondly, I don&apos;t think performers (or composers) need<br/>    to know this. There&apos;s no way a bass is going to be able to say,<br/>    &quot;Oh, 3129/8080, I was a bit flat there, wasn&apos;t I?&quot;</p><p>    Performers are more likely to be interested in which note<br/>    remain unchanged or nearly unchanged between chords. They<br/>    can then tune pure to it/them. For nearly unchanged notes,<br/>    yes I agree plenty of mileage could be gotten out of only one<br/>    type of &quot;nearly&quot;. I like drawing lines to make the common<br/>    tones obvious. Then one doesn&apos;t even have to read music (or<br/>    both clefs) to know that he&apos;s got to match the bari&apos;s previous<br/>    pitch. Dotted lines make a good nearly, with perhaps a plus<br/>    or minus sign above them to indicate direction.</p><p>    That takes care of shifts. Drift I think is best shown as a<br/>    cumulative cents offset from concert pitch. Every time the<br/>    offset changes direction -- say it&apos;s been going flat and<br/>    starts going sharp -- the current offset should be printed<br/>    above the barline. Say we start out at A=440, go 20 cents<br/>    flat every other bar for 5 bars, then go 20 cents sharp every<br/>    other bar for 5 bars and end on A=440. The notation would<br/>    show &quot;-100&quot; above the 6th barline and &quot;+-0&quot; above the last<br/>    barline. The point is that this is something that should<br/>    happen naturally if one tunes pure and respects the shifts<br/>    notation (above). It&apos;s just there as a check so you can<br/>    troubleshoot whether you&apos;re going flat &apos;cause you&apos;re tired<br/>    or because the composer/arranger intended it.</p><p>    -Carl</p><p>    Back to top Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post<br/>    Messages in this topic (10)<br/>    1c.

I observed that 34 is the only tuning that has both a<br/>    good 5/4 and 5/3 and also has the Archytas comma tempered out in the<br/>    upward jump of the fifth between 7/4 and 4/3 (at 0:27-0:28). But I<br/>    can&apos;t say that it&apos;s clearly my favorite for that reason, because I<br/>    also liked 46 and 68 better than the others.</p><p>    In the paper, I didn&apos;t mean to give the impression that wide fifths<br/>    are necessarily better melodically under all circumstances -- I was<br/>    writing specifically about a diatonic scale, where wide fifths result<br/>    in significantly narrower-than-12ET diatonic semitones. Several<br/>    times in the paper (pp. 59, 74, 75), I made statements to the effect<br/>    that chromatic semitones in 31-ET could be used to enhance the<br/>    melodic effect of that (narrow-fifth) tuning, so the size of the<br/>    fifths is, under more general circumstances, beside the point.</p><p>    If your tuning has dozens of tones/octave, you then have<br/>    opportunities to alter the mood on the fly by making subtle<br/>    substitutions in your scale subset, so it&apos;s not wise to draw<br/>    conclusions too quickly about one of these tunings vs. another.</p><p>    --George</p><p>    Back to top Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post<br/>    Messages in this topic (9)<br/>    3.

It is a very simple, one-liner type proof.</p><p>If the scale has 2n degrees, the inversion of every interval of n degrees also consists of n degrees. Since there is more than one  interval in each interval class, you have one interval of n degrees which isn&apos;t its inversion. That leaves only one more interval in the interval class to find if the scale is trivalent, so that remaining interval must be its own inversion, so must be the midpoint.
