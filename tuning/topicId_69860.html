I&apos;ll still be improving on<br/>history, of course.  Just not as much.  :)</p><p>I started with Werckmeister&apos;s pure octaves.  This assumption<br/>can easily be changed later if desired.</p><p>Then I decided there would only be two kinds of 5th.<br/>Using 3 or more will get you more shades of contrast, but<br/>no new colors (basic ways of making the compromise).

But how to distribute these on the<br/>chain of fifths?</p><p>Here I used two constraints: 1. The scale must have at<br/>least one 3rd audibly better than ET. and 2. The scale<br/>must not have any 3rds &gt; 404 cents.  You might not think<br/>that Pythagorean thirds sound like ass, but I do.</p><p>I used these constraints to get the number circular<br/>permutations down to something manageable.  Then I looked<br/>at the 3rds in Scala.</p><p>Not all patterns produced unique patterns of thirds.  In<br/>these cases I chose scales having their best 7:4 on keys<br/>with better thirds.</p><p>I used Scala to rotate the scales into historical &apos;good<br/>keys&apos; position.  Not all scales had good transitions<br/>along the chain of fifths, and those were discarded.</p><p>The following four scales is the result:</p><p>! 12_lumma_5thcomma[246].scl<br/>!<br/> 1/5-comma SLSSLLLSLLLS temperament.<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 99.609<br/> 199.218<br/> 298.827<br/> 393.744<br/> 502.737<br/> 597.654<br/> 697.263<br/> 796.872<br/> 896.481<br/> 1000.782<br/> 1095.699<br/> 2/1<br/>!<br/>! 2 x 394-cent 3rds on F C.<br/>! 4 x 398-cent 3rds on Eb Bb G D.<br/>! 6 x 403-cent 3rds elsewhere.</p><p>! 12_lumma_5thcomma[327].scl<br/>!<br/> 1/5-comma SSSLSLLLSLLL temperament.<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 94.917<br/> 194.526<br/> 294.135<br/> 393.744<br/> 498.045<br/> 592.962<br/> 697.263<br/> 796.872<br/> 891.789<br/> 996.090<br/> 1091.007<br/> 2/1<br/>!<br/>! 3 x 394-cent 3rds on F C G.<br/>! 2 x 398-cent 3rds on Bb D.<br/>! 7 x 403-cent 3rds elsewhere.</p><p>! 12_lumma_6thcomma[1335].scl<br/>!<br/> 1/6-comma SSSLSLLSLLLS temperament.<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 98.045<br/> 196.090<br/> 298.045<br/> 396.090<br/> 501.955<br/> 596.090<br/> 698.045<br/> 796.090<br/> 894.135<br/> 1000.000<br/> 1094.135<br/> 2/1<br/>!<br/>! 1 x 392-cent 3rd on F.<br/>! 3 x 396-cent 3rds on Bb C G.<br/>! 3 x 400-cent 3rds on Eb D E.<br/>! 5 x 404-cent 3rds elsewhere.</p><p>! 12_lumma_6thcomma[2226].scl<br/>!<br/> 1/6-comma SSSSLLLSLLLS temperament.<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 98.045<br/> 196.090<br/> 298.045<br/> 392.180<br/> 501.955<br/> 596.090<br/> 698.045<br/> 796.090<br/> 894.135<br/> 1000.000<br/> 1094.135<br/> 2/1<br/>!<br/>! 2 x 392-cent 3rds on F C.<br/>! 2 x 396-cent 3rds on Bb G.<br/>! 2 x 400-cent 3rds on Eb D.<br/>! 6 x 404-cent 3rds elsewhere.</p><p>I&apos;m not aware of anything like this having been done<br/>before (though I&apos;d guess it has), but I feel pretty good<br/>about it.</p><p>I&apos;m also not aware of any historical temperaments using<br/>these patterns.

In<br/>&gt; these cases I chose scales having their best 7:4 on keys<br/>&gt; with better thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I used Scala to rotate the scales into historical &apos;good<br/>&gt; keys&apos; position.

I&apos;ll still be improving on<br/>&gt; &gt; history, of course.  Just not as much.  :)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I started with Werckmeister&apos;s pure octaves.  This assumption<br/>&gt; &gt; can easily be changed later if desired.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Then I decided there would only be two kinds of 5th.<br/>&gt; &gt; Using 3 or more will get you more shades of contrast, but<br/>&gt; &gt; no new colors (basic ways of making the compromise).  I<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth it for the complexity it adds.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To get enough contrast from ET without going too close<br/>&gt; &gt; to meantone, 1/5- and 1/6-comma systems are basically the<br/>&gt; &gt; only games in town.  But how to distribute these on the<br/>&gt; &gt; chain of fifths?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here I used two constraints: 1. The scale must have at<br/>&gt; &gt; least one 3rd audibly better than ET. and 2. The scale<br/>&gt; &gt; must not have any 3rds &gt; 404 cents.  You might not think<br/>&gt; &gt; that Pythagorean thirds sound like ass, but I do.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I used these constraints to get the number circular<br/>&gt; &gt; permutations down to something manageable.  Then I looked<br/>&gt; &gt; at the 3rds in Scala.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not all patterns produced unique patterns of thirds.  In<br/>&gt; &gt; these cases I chose scales having their best 7:4 on keys<br/>&gt; &gt; with better thirds.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I used Scala to rotate the scales into historical &apos;good<br/>&gt; &gt; keys&apos; position.  Not all scales had good transitions<br/>&gt; &gt; along the chain of fifths, and those were discarded.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The following four scales is the result:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 12_lumma_5thcomma[246].scl<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt;  1/5-comma SLSSLLLSLLLS temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt;  12<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt;  99.609<br/>&gt; &gt;  199.218<br/>&gt; &gt;  298.827<br/>&gt; &gt;  393.744<br/>&gt; &gt;  502.737<br/>&gt; &gt;  597.654<br/>&gt; &gt;  697.263<br/>&gt; &gt;  796.872<br/>&gt; &gt;  896.481<br/>&gt; &gt;  1000.782<br/>&gt; &gt;  1095.699<br/>&gt; &gt;  2/1<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 2 x 394-cent 3rds on F C.<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 4 x 398-cent 3rds on Eb Bb G D.<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 6 x 403-cent 3rds elsewhere.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 12_lumma_5thcomma[327].scl<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt;  1/5-comma SSSLSLLLSLLL temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt;  12<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt;  94.917<br/>&gt; &gt;  194.526<br/>&gt; &gt;  294.135<br/>&gt; &gt;  393.744<br/>&gt; &gt;  498.045<br/>&gt; &gt;  592.962<br/>&gt; &gt;  697.263<br/>&gt; &gt;  796.872<br/>&gt; &gt;  891.789<br/>&gt; &gt;  996.090<br/>&gt; &gt;  1091.007<br/>&gt; &gt;  2/1<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 3 x 394-cent 3rds on F C G.<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 2 x 398-cent 3rds on Bb D.<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 7 x 403-cent 3rds elsewhere.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 12_lumma_6thcomma[1335].scl<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt;  1/6-comma SSSLSLLSLLLS temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt;  12<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt;  98.045<br/>&gt; &gt;  196.090<br/>&gt; &gt;  298.045<br/>&gt; &gt;  396.090<br/>&gt; &gt;  501.955<br/>&gt; &gt;  596.090<br/>&gt; &gt;  698.045<br/>&gt; &gt;  796.090<br/>&gt; &gt;  894.135<br/>&gt; &gt;  1000.000<br/>&gt; &gt;  1094.135<br/>&gt; &gt;  2/1<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 1 x 392-cent 3rd on F.<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 3 x 396-cent 3rds on Bb C G.<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 3 x 400-cent 3rds on Eb D E.<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 5 x 404-cent 3rds elsewhere.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 12_lumma_6thcomma[2226].scl<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt;  1/6-comma SSSSLLLSLLLS temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt;  12<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt;  98.045<br/>&gt; &gt;  196.090<br/>&gt; &gt;  298.045<br/>&gt; &gt;  392.180<br/>&gt; &gt;  501.955<br/>&gt; &gt;  596.090<br/>&gt; &gt;  698.045<br/>&gt; &gt;  796.090<br/>&gt; &gt;  894.135<br/>&gt; &gt;  1000.000<br/>&gt; &gt;  1094.135<br/>&gt; &gt;  2/1<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 2 x 392-cent 3rds on F C.<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 2 x 396-cent 3rds on Bb G.<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 2 x 400-cent 3rds on Eb D.<br/>&gt; &gt; ! 6 x 404-cent 3rds elsewhere.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not aware of anything like this having been done<br/>&gt; &gt; before (though I&apos;d guess it has), but I feel pretty good<br/>&gt; &gt; about it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m also not aware of any historical temperaments using<br/>&gt; &gt; these patterns.

The scale must have at<br/>&gt; &gt; least one 3rd audibly better than ET. and 2. The scale<br/>&gt; &gt; must not have any 3rds &gt; 404 cents.  You might not think<br/>&gt; &gt; that Pythagorean thirds sound like ass, but I do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like Pythagorean thirds, but in the case of a general<br/>&gt; purpose 12WT, I think they&apos;d have to be in the context of<br/>&gt; a very embossed tuning, which means you&apos;d have to have<br/>&gt; an equal amount of truly 5/4ish thirds to balance them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, at a certain point going for &quot;highly embossed&quot;,<br/>&gt; a person needs to stop piddling with 12 and just stick in some<br/>&gt; split keys, in my opinion.</p><p>Or go with a generalized keyboard, in mine.
