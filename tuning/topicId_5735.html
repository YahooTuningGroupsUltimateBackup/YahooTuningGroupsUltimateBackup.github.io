I find that illogical. The only<br/>reason the JI ratios come about in the first place is in order to make<br/>certain intervals as consonant as possible. If an ET makes those intervals<br/>consonant, then why worry about the dissonant intervals (like 32/27, 40/27,<br/>etc.)? If those intervals are not represented by their best approximations<br/>to JI, who cares? Approximating JI only matters when it gives you a sense of<br/>how consonant your intervals are going to be.</p><p>On the other hand, if you&apos;re trying to find out whether the ET has a<br/>_melodic_ representation of the diatonic scale, I would ask you to consider<br/>this: Would anyone say that the pseudo-Pythagorean diatonic scale in<br/>53-equal fails melodically? I don&apos;t think so. In that case, it&apos;s clearly not<br/>consistency with the 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3,<br/>15/8, 2/1 that determines melodic viability.</p><p>As I see it, the diatonic scale is generally (in common practice music)<br/>associated with a harmonic limit of 5. 15-, 26-, 27-, and 43-equal are<br/>consistent within that harmonic limit. But 15 and 27 (and 22, 29, 34, 41)<br/>have a LMsLMLs structure, while 26 and 43 (and 12, 19, 31) have a LLsLLLs<br/>structure. Only the latter are appropriate for common-practice music since<br/>the former totally screw up a I-vi-ii-V-I or I-IV-ii-V-I progression (i.e.,<br/>trying to use all the common tones leads to a pitch drift downward by one<br/>degree of the tuning). So I would really deem 15, 22, 27, 29, 34, and maybe<br/>41 (though there you might not notice the drift) to be truly inconsistent<br/>with the diatonic scale in common practice, while 12, 19, 26, 31, and 43<br/>would be truly consistent with it. Of course this is a different type of<br/>consistency that the type used in the context of harmonic limits, but it is<br/>a more appropriate way of judging consistency with a certain usage of a<br/>scale, rather than divorcing the scale from its usage and pretending that it<br/>was one big chord, which is essentially what you&apos;re doing, as Carl has been<br/>trying to tell you.</p><p>Please excuse my unfriendly tone, Dan, I&apos;m very stressed-out at the moment<br/>and I want you to know that I greatly appreciate your coming to my defense<br/>in recent weeks.
