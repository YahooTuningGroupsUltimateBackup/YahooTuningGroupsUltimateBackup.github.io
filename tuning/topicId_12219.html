Hardly, I would say.</p><p>Recently I found myself improvising a kind of two-voice counterpoint<br/>with a pentatonic scale in 27-tone equal temperament (27-tet), with<br/>lots of fifths and octaves, imaging that I was hearing the _gender_ in<br/>a Javanese or Balinese gamelan playing in _slendro_ (something like<br/>5-tet, maybe not so far from 27). The &quot;vibraphone&quot; timbre maybe fit<br/>this effect -- I originally chose it for a Setharean smoothening<br/>of this scale as a neo-Gothic hypermeantone.</p><p>The JI (3-limit) version is beautiful, as is the 27-tet version, as is<br/>the actual _slendro_ (varying from gamelan to gamelan, with 5-tet only<br/>one possible generalized approximation).</p><p>The last I checked, the universe is based not only on the simple<br/>arithmetic of the harmonic series, but also on inharmonicity, and also<br/>more generally on the &quot;language&quot; of differential equations, a language<br/>we express using many irrational as well as rational qualities<br/>(including, for example, Euler&apos;s e).</p><p>More generally, it has been asked whether there is a kind of natural<br/>or possibly cultural &quot;trend&quot; toward JI. From experience, I would say<br/>(and hope) that there may be a trend toward diversity _including_ not<br/>only JI systems in the standard sense but what I&apos;d call JR (standing<br/>for Just Ratio) systems -- systems with _some_ just intervals, maybe<br/>judiciously mixed with tempered ones.</p><p>Playing Gothic music in Pythagorean JI -- using only integer ratios --<br/>is a great joy for me. Here there are generally no daunting comma<br/>problems even using a simple 12-tone tuning, and not too much larger<br/>tunings can overcome the problems that might occur in a few<br/>experimental pieces which go beyond a 12-note range. Since the<br/>syntonic comma isn&apos;t an issue for this kind of music, the familiar<br/>arguments for temperament in 5-limit or higher music don&apos;t apply.</p><p>However, both as someone who plays and as someone who likes to<br/>theorize, I have found that a familiar theme can invite variations.<br/>Thus my exploration of what I call &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; tunings, especially<br/>hypermeantones with fifths wider than pure.</p><p>In other words, playing in a very beautiful JI system has led me to<br/>experiment with temperament. It&apos;s not necessarily of matter of &quot;I&apos;d<br/>like to do this particular musical trick but can&apos;t,&quot; but rather, &quot;What<br/>might it sound like if I somewhat accentuate _this_ aspect of the<br/>tuning by altering the size of this or that interval a bit...?&quot;</p><p>To me, different just and tempered intervals might be compared to<br/>primary and mixed colors. Why not a musical palette including both<br/>kinds of colors -- not to mention that Pythagorean and other JI<br/>systems themselves in effect achieve &quot;virtual temperament&quot;  by<br/>generating complex ratios which might be heard as variants of simpler<br/>ones.</p><p>For example, a Pythagorean major third is 81:64, and in Gothic or<br/>similar musics is at once unstable and relatively concordant. However,<br/>might this be heard in effect, for example, as a 19:15 (about 1.42<br/>cents larger?) -- and a major seventh at 243:128 likewise as a 19:10<br/>(larger by the same amount)? The 81:64-19:15 resemblance occurred to<br/>me when I first ran into a mention of the latter interval and its<br/>size, while someone posted a while ago on the 243:128/19:10<br/>resemblance.</p><p>Please let me express my special admiration and awe for those of you who<br/>indeed practice what I call &quot;polyhedral&quot; JI, building intricate<br/>multidimensional lattices from various prime factors, and using these<br/>artful geometries to make beautiful music.</p><p>At the same time, I would like to suggest that one can value just<br/>intervals -- simple or complex -- and use them _in combination_ with<br/>tempered ones to develop often somewhat simpler and more &quot;regular&quot; or<br/>symmetrical systems with many shades of concord and tension.</p><p>We can weave the intonational fabric around some just ratios while<br/>filling out the design with a &quot;patchwork&quot; of tempered intervals. The<br/>two categories need not be antagonistic -- they _can_ get along quite<br/>nicely.</p><p>One technical aside: as a player of Renaissance music, I can confirm<br/>that the syntonic comma problem with 5-limit JI isn&apos;t limited to<br/>major/minor tonality or its 18th-20th century manifestations. It also<br/>hits you where you live if you happen to be playing a 16th-century<br/>piece in Dorian, Mixolydian, or any other mode which happens to call<br/>for concordant fifths at both G-D and D-A. Yes, I&apos;ve played a keyboard<br/>with two versions of D which can solve this problem -- and sometimes<br/>the comma shifts aren&apos;t at all unpleasing, but it&apos;s a demanding art<br/>even for many quite simple pieces. Thus I don&apos;t disagree with Zarlino<br/>when, after describing such an experimental keyboard, he found<br/>temperaments for fixed-pitch instruments much more practical for this<br/>music.</p><p>Temperaments need be neither equal nor regular, of course, and I would<br/>tend to associate Bach with the well-temperaments described by theorists<br/>such as Werckmeister (who also recognized 12-tet as a possibility). As<br/>Paul Erlich has noted, the documented history of 12-tet goes back (in<br/>Europe) to the lutes of the 16th century, and musicians recognized that<br/>different timbres might call for different temperaments. Thus Vicenzo<br/>Galilei championed 12-tet on the lute, and found it in theory the most<br/>perfect tuning, but preferred 2/7-comma meantone on harpsichord despite<br/>the resulting &quot;defect&quot; (in his view) that Ab could not be equivalent to<br/>G#, etc., as on the lute.</p><p>In my view, the &quot;problem&quot; with 12-tet is not as a tuning but as a<br/>universal standard. Any other kind of tuning placed in this<br/>unfortunate role -- including polyhedral JI lattice systems -- would<br/>be subject to different but similar objections.</p><p>People on the list, you are all precious to me. May we have<br/>stimulating arguments, but in friendship and mutual appreciation.</p><p>In friendship,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
