Then could some one, or anyone<br/>   &gt; please explain to me the difference between TONAL music<br/>   &gt; and MODAL music.</p><p>From one point of view, &quot;tonal&quot; music is any music with a feeling for<br/>a main &quot;center&quot; or &quot;place of repose,&quot; so that different modes or<br/>scales might be taken as expressing alike some form of &quot;tonality.&quot;</p><p>However, the term &quot;tonality&quot; as applied to Western European music<br/>history typically refers especially to the kind of styles based on<br/>major and minor keys favored roughly from around 1670 to 1900, in<br/>contrast to other styles of organization.</p><p>The term &quot;modality&quot; is often applied to generally to all Western<br/>European music from the medieval era (say about 500-1420) to the<br/>earlier 17th century. Sometime around 1630-1670, changes in style<br/>occur leading to major/minor tonality. These changes involve not only<br/>the emergence of new patterns of harmony, but the restriction of many<br/>beautiful harmonic progressions common in earlier 16th-17th century<br/>practice.</p><p>Starting around the era of Debussy at the turn of the 20th century,<br/>both modal and tonal currents have played a part in European and<br/>related traditions, along with other movements such as Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>pantonality (all notes considered equally &quot;central&quot;) or &quot;concrete&quot;<br/>music outside traditional relations of pitch (I invite correction on<br/>my use of &quot;concrete&quot;).</p><p>In traditional European music histories, to sum up, all music before<br/>some point or transitional era around the 17th century is considered<br/>&quot;modal,&quot; with the &quot;tonal&quot; era underway by around the era of Corelli<br/>and Werckmeister, say 1680.</p><p>However, the concept of &quot;mode&quot; often tends to focus on the choice of a<br/>scale or melodic pattern, whether in European music or in other world<br/>musics. It is interesting that European writers of the 13th and 14th<br/>centuries, for example, often tend to focus mainly on the vertical<br/>aspects of writing for two or more voices: for example, the choices of<br/>stable or unstable intervals and sonorities, and the desire for rich<br/>or complete concords.</p><p>To emphasize the vertical aspects of 14th-century music, I have<br/>proposed the term &quot;focality,&quot; which could be defined as the tendency<br/>of an unstable sonority to resolve to a stable one via certain<br/>standard progressions involving semitonal melodic motion. Obtaining<br/>these progressions often calls for altering or inflecting the steps of<br/>a diatonic mode.</p><p>Both in its 14th-century and modern forms, focal harmony takes as a<br/>basic stable sonority the complete _trine_, built from three voices<br/>forming the intervals of outer 2:1 octave, lower 3:2 fifth, and upper<br/>4:3 fourth. Using a notation with C4 as middle C, for example, we<br/>might write a complete 2:3:4 trine on D as D4-A4-D5.</p><p>A piece in the &quot;focality of D,&quot; to use a 21st-century rather than<br/>medieval term, will take a trine on D as a main center, and at the<br/>same time often have melodic lines following the diatonic tones of the<br/>mode or octave species D-D, often known as the Dorian mode in medieval<br/>and later naming systems.</p><p>However, while such a piece might be described as in &quot;the Dorian mode<br/>on D,&quot; the patterns of focal harmony will routinely call for inflected<br/>notes such as C# and G# in regular cadences. For example, consider<br/>these typical progressions, the first a favorite 14th-century<br/>conclusion, and the second a four-voice variation very popular in some<br/>21st-century focal styles:</p><p>                                  C#5    D5<br/>         C#5    D5                B4     A4<br/>         G#4    A4                G#4    A4<br/>         E4     D4                E4     D4</p><p>      (M6-8 + M3-5)       (M6-8 + M3-5 + m3-1 + M2-4)</p><p>Each cadence combines a set of two-voice resolutions in which an<br/>unstable interval such as a major third or sixth progressions to a<br/>stable interval such as a fifth or octave. Likewise, in the second<br/>progression, the middle minor third contracts to a unison while the<br/>upper major second expands to a fourth.</p><p>Obtaining these focal progressions requires the accidentals G# and C#,<br/>which typically would contrast with the usual diatonic tones G and C<br/>of the D mode, adding variety to the music and also further emphasis<br/>to the cadence.</p><p>Here I should add that focal harmony is typically based either on<br/>Pythagorean intonation with pure fifths and fourths, or on modern<br/>systems where the fifths are gently tempered in the wide direction.</p><p>Scholars such as Christopher Page, drawing on the teaching of<br/>Marchettus of Padua (1318), have suggested that medieval ensembles may<br/>often have tuned their cadential major thirds and sixths somewhat<br/>wider than Pythagorean, producing very effective narrow semitones<br/>smaller than the already rather compact regular step of 256:243<br/>(~90.22 cents). In modern fixed-pitch systems, this is a very common<br/>performance practice, with these cadential thirds and sixths often at<br/>or near ratios of 9:7 (~435.08 cents) and 12:7 (~933.13 cents), for<br/>example.</p><p>Thus one could say that a piece &quot;is in the Dorian mode on D,&quot; and also<br/>that &quot;it is mainly centered on the focality of D,&quot; the latter often<br/>implying the use of altered notes to obtain vertical intervals such as<br/>major thirds and sixths expanding to fifths and octaves (E4-G#4 before<br/>D4-A4, E4-C#5 before D4-D5).</p><p>More specifically, one could say that a piece with final cadences such<br/>as those above is in &quot;the focality of D intensive,&quot; with the term<br/>&quot;intensive&quot; meaning that the focal progressions involve _ascending_<br/>semitonal motion.</p><p>In contrast, a piece centered on D might close with final cadences<br/>like these:</p><p>                                  C5     D5<br/>         C5     D5                Bb4    A4<br/>         G4     A4                G4     A4<br/>         Eb4    D4                Eb4    D4</p><p>      (M6-8 + M3-5)       (M6-8 + M3-5 + m3-1 + M2-4)</p><p>Here the unstable and stable vertical intervals are identical, but the<br/>resolutions involve _descending_ semitonal motion in some of the<br/>voices. Such motion is sometimes termed &quot;remissive,&quot; so that we might<br/>a piece with a final cadence of this variety as written or improvised<br/>&quot;in the focality of D remissive.&quot;</p><p>The contrast between intensive and remissive progression is a vital<br/>element in 14th-century forms where a remissive cadence typically<br/>signals an internal cadence with more to follow, while an intensive<br/>cadence is more conclusive.</p><p>From a traditional historical perspective, the vertical and<br/>organizational style of the 14th century is &quot;modal&quot; simply because it<br/>is quite different from 17th-19th century tonality. However, many of<br/>the most important differences relate not only to the choice of a<br/>diatonic scale, but to the basic patterns of vertical sonority and<br/>resolution. Thus thirds and sixths are active intervals in a<br/>14th-century approach, but stable and restful in 18th-century<br/>tonality, with the first approach suggesting Pythagorean intonation or<br/>the like, and the second some kind of adaptive ensemble intonation or<br/>keyboard temperament approximating ratios of 5:4 and 6:5.</p><p>The situation with 21st-century focal harmony -- and possibly also<br/>medieval focal harmony in certain times and places -- becomes yet more<br/>complicated because of the creative and enriching influence of Near<br/>Eastern traditions with their wealth of neutral steps and intervals.</p><p>The result, to borrow a phrase from Julia Werntz, is often a &quot;highly<br/>inflected surface&quot; where the diatonic modal structure is altered not<br/>only by standard 14th-century inflections available within a 12-note<br/>Pythagorean tuning or the like, but a range of fine intonational<br/>nuances.</p><p>Also, the concept of &quot;mode&quot; in this type of music can embrace Near<br/>Eastern patterns based on neutral or &quot;semineutral&quot; intervals,<br/>sometimes treated as a main basis for melodic and harmonic<br/>progressions, and sometimes as motives or patterns mixed with medieval<br/>European diatonic modes.</p><p>One feature shared in common by focal and tonal harmony alike, in<br/>contrast to some more &quot;gentle&quot; modal styles, is the systematic use of<br/>semitonal motion as a feature of the most compelling vertical<br/>cadences.</p><p>In focal harmony, such directed progressions seek a stable trine<br/>(2:3:4), with expansion from major third to fifth and major sixth to<br/>octave especially characteristic.</p><p>In tonal harmony, directed progressions traditionally seek a stable<br/>triad (4:5:6), with the stepwise resolution of a diminished fifth to a<br/>major third, or of an augmented fourth to a minor sixth, as especially<br/>definitive of a key center. This use of &quot;tritone tension&quot; is something<br/>on which Paul Erlich has often focused in his printed publications and<br/>informative articles here.</p><p>One feature of both focal and tonal harmony is that an unstable<br/>sonority can prompt the expectation of a given resolution, creating<br/>the opportunity for a composer artfully to _avoid_ the expected<br/>directed progression, engaging the listener&apos;s sustained interest.</p><p>Sarah Fuller has written with consummate vision and skill on this<br/>point regarding the style of Guillaume de Machaut (1300-1377), and the<br/>recognition of a &quot;focal&quot; category of harmony might encourage more of a<br/>focus on such techniques both in medieval music and in related modern<br/>styles.</p><p>Considering focal harmony as a distinct category might lend some<br/>perspective to usual historical dialogues about &quot;modality&quot; and<br/>&quot;tonality.&quot;</p><p>For example, a contrast is typically drawn between 16th-century<br/>&quot;modality&quot; and 18th-century &quot;tonality,&quot; a contrast indeed reflecting<br/>some important distinctions of style not only regarding the choice or<br/>definitions of scales, but preferences regarding vertical progressions<br/>and the treatment of concord/discord.</p><p>At the same time, both types of styles have certain common<br/>assumptions: the treatment of thirds and sixths as the richest stable<br/>concords, ideally with sizes at or near 5-based ratios; and the<br/>avoidance for the most part of parallel fifths and octaves, an<br/>important factor in constraining the choice of progressions.</p><p>Focal harmony in a 14th-century or 21st-century style is quite<br/>different, with its trinic standard of stable concord, and its use of<br/>other types of tuning systems and interval sizes -- with modern<br/>textures often favoring thirds at or near 9:7 and 7:6, for example.</p><p>Since I&apos;ve said quite a lot here, why don&apos;t I invite your questions or<br/>comments?</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
