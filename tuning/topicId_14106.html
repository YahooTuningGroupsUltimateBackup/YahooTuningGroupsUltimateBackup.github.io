The page<br/><a href="http://members.tripod.com/vismath1/spinadel/">http://members.tripod.com/vismath1/spinadel/</a> defines it as the<br/>(sqrt(13)-1)/2 above, while the page<br/><a href="http://www.mi.sanu.ac.yu/vismath/kappraff/kap4.htm">http://www.mi.sanu.ac.yu/vismath/kappraff/kap4.htm</a> has another definition<br/>that opens up a whole new dimension of possibilities -- which include the<br/>constants that <a href="http://members.tripod.com/vismath1/spinadel/">http://members.tripod.com/vismath1/spinadel/</a> would call the<br/>Copper mean and the Nickel mean.</p><p>But I take it you&apos;re interested in the ratios that relate to sqrt(2)-1 in<br/>the same way as the noble ratios relate to phi. In other words, the ratios<br/>whose continued fraction representations end in all 2s. It appears, from the<br/>above page, that we should call these the &quot;Pell&quot; means, or ratios, or<br/>whatever. The proper scales generated by these numbers always have L/s =<br/>sqrt(2), and obey the following recursion:</p><p>n(s(new)) = 2*n(L(old)) + n(s(old))<br/>n(L(new)) = n(L(old)) + n(s(old))</p><p>In the Hahn/Breed case, the silver Pell, (or what<br/><a href="http://members.tripod.com/vismath1/spinadel/">http://members.tripod.com/vismath1/spinadel/</a> calls &quot;THE&quot; Silver mean)<br/>pseudo-Pythagorean case, the first two examples of this are -- first you<br/>have the octave divided into just a fourth and a fifth, in the ratio L/s =<br/>sqrt(2). Then the fifth is broken down into two major seconds and a minor<br/>third, and the fourth is broken down into a major second and a minor third,<br/>and you have a pentatonic scale. These two new intervals are in the ratio<br/>L/s = sqrt(2). Then the minor third is broken down into two diatonic<br/>semitones and one chromatic semitone, and the major second is broken down<br/>into one diatonic semitone and one chromatic semitone, and you have a<br/>chromatic scale. These two new intervals are in the ratio L/s (chromatic<br/>semitone to diatonic semitone) = sqrt(2). Next you get a 29-tone scale, a<br/>70-tone scale, and so on.</p><p>Notice that we skip the 3-, 7-, 17-, 41-, 99-, etc. scales in this process<br/>-- the improper MOSs, with s/L = sqrt(2)-1. That&apos;s what differentiates this<br/>Pell process from the noble process. For the Pell generators, you get two<br/>different types of scale division, which alternate with one another. The<br/>first type is like the noble type:</p><p>n(s(intermediate)) = n(L(old))<br/>n(L(intermediate)) = n(L(old)) + n(S(old))</p><p>i.e., each old large step is divided into one new large and one new small<br/>step, and each old mall step remains undivided, becoming a new large step;<br/>but unlike the noble case, here the ratio L/s changes from sqrt(2) to<br/>sqrt(2)+1 [=1/(sqrt(2)-1)]. The second type is the &quot;opposite&quot;:</p><p>n(s(new)) = n(L(intermediate)) + n(s(intermediate))<br/>n(L(new)) = n(L(intermediate))</p><p>i.e., each old large step is divided into one new large and one small step,<br/>and each old small step remains a small step (kind of the obvious way of<br/>&quot;remedying&quot; the impropriety) -- the large step, previously sqrt(2)+1 times<br/>as large as the small step, is split into a small step (1 times as large as<br/>the small step) and a less-large step (sqrt(2) times as large as the small<br/>step).</p><p>And the process begins again.</p><p>So the overall sequence of MOS scales, in this case</p><p>2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 17, 29, 41, 70, 99 . . .</p><p>but it would be different for another Pell generator, obeys an alternating<br/>recursion:</p><p>*******************************<br/>if n is even, S(n+1)=S(n)+S(n-1)<br/>if n is odd, S(n+1)=S(n)+S(n-2)<br/>*******************************</p><p>_OR_, we can consider _just_ the &quot;intermediate&quot;, improper MOSs (3, 7, 17,<br/>41, 99, etc.), and ignore the proper ones. First we have two perfect fourths<br/>and one major second, in the ratio L/s = sqrt(2)+1. Then the perfect fourth<br/>is broken down into two major seconds and a minor second, and the major<br/>second remains intact, giving a diatonic scale with L/s = sqrt(2)+1. Then<br/>the major seconds are broken down into two minor seconds and a &quot;komma&quot;, and<br/>the minor second remains intact, giving a 17-tone &quot;medieval Arabic&quot; scale<br/>with L/s = sqrt(2)+1. And so on.</p><p>The sequence of improper scales</p><p>3, 7, 17, 41, 99 . . .</p><p>obeys the recursion S(n+1)=2*S(n)+S(n-1), which is, you may recall, the same<br/>recursion as the sequence of proper scales</p><p>2, 5, 12, 29, 70 . . .</p><p>Hope this helps and maybe someone can now justify Dan&apos;s amazing math.</p><p>Another Pell generator would be the one that divides the octave into the<br/>proportion sqrt(2) : 1, 848.53 cents. Aside from an initial few with extreme<br/>L/s values, the MOS scales generated by this generator alternate between L/s<br/>= sqrt(2) and L/s = sqrt(2)+1 and have cardinalities</p><p>2, 15, 17, 19, 36, 53, 89 . . .</p><p>which obey the general Pell recursion</p><p>*******************************<br/>if n is even, S(n+1)=S(n)+S(n-1)<br/>if n is odd, S(n+1)=S(n)+S(n-2)<br/>*******************************</p><p>For a final example, I&apos;ll choose to divide the octave into the proportion<br/>sqrt(2)+3 : 1, or 928.15 cents. The sequence of scales alternating between<br/>L/s = sqrt(2) and L/s = sqrt(2)+1 is:</p><p>4, 5, 9, 13, 22, 31, 53 . . .</p><p>which obey the general Pell recursion</p><p>*******************************<br/>if n is even, S(n+1)=S(n)+S(n-1)<br/>if n is odd, S(n+1)=S(n)+S(n-2)<br/>*******************************</p><p>Okay, enough Pell-icans for now . . .</p></div><h3><a id=14118 href="#14118">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2000 4:45:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul!<br/>    If such things are gold, bronze and Silver, must we conclude that JI and ET are Lead ;-)</p><p>&quot;Paul H.

Not quite as immediately appealing sounding &apos;ey,<br/>but maybe it&apos;s a better term? I don&apos;t know... Anyway, here&apos;s a<br/>generalized Silver (or whatever) generator algorithm for all scales<br/>that have Myhill&apos;s property within a given periodicity where L/s = S:</p><p>X = P/((b+S*d))*(a+S*c)</p><p>where &quot;P&quot; = any given periodicity, &quot;S&quot; = sqrt(2), &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;/&quot;d&quot; =<br/>the adjacent fractions of a given Ls index, and &quot;X&quot; = the generalized<br/>Silver generator</p><p>Note that the weighted generator of any Metallic constant &gt;1.5 gives<br/>an improper scale, and that any weighted generator of any metallic<br/>constant &lt;1.5 gives a strictly proper scale, and that MC = 2 (i.e., a<br/>weighted generator of the Metallic constant 1.5) is the ET, MOS<br/>generator (2x+y and x+2y on the Stern-Brocot tree where x and y are<br/>generalized as L and s).</p><p>Perhaps this family of MGs (Metallic generators) can be generalized<br/>for all scales that have Myhill&apos;s property within a given periodicity<br/>where L/s = MC as:</p><p>X = P/((b+MC*d))*(a+MC*c)</p><p>where &quot;P&quot; = any given periodicity, &quot;MC&quot; = any continued fraction<br/>constant &gt;0, &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;/&quot;d&quot; = the adjacent fractions of a given Ls<br/>index, and &quot;X&quot; = the generalized Metallic generator</p><p>So continued fraction constants converging on zero represent the<br/>&quot;limit&quot; of one border of a given Ls index (&quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot; as b/1200*a), and<br/>continued fraction constants converging on infinity represent the<br/>&quot;limit&quot; of the other border of a given Ls index (&quot;c&quot;/&quot;d&quot; as d/1200*c).</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>I don&apos;t really care for the &quot;Metallic&quot; term (i.e., Metallic constants,<br/>Metallic generators) aesthetically. Anyone have any better &quot;sounding&quot;<br/>suggestions that are still theoretically &quot;sound&quot; (in other words ones<br/>that don&apos;t cause any friction with another terms existing meaning<br/>here)?</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
