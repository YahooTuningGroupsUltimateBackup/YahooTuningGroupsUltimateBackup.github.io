This is done all the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;time and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;has nothing to do with melody, nothing to do with direction.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;You&apos;re correct.  But I&apos;m not talking about C Major.<br/>&gt;&gt;If an F Major chord appears in a C-Minor context,  I&apos;ll argue that most<br/>&gt;&gt;of<br/>&gt;&gt;the time,  it means something is happening directionally.  I.e.,  that A<br/>&gt;&gt;is going to lead to B.    (Or you&apos;re hearing something exceptional).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sorry, Chris, I meant C minor.  And yes, there can easily be a major IV<br/>&gt;with an FAC triad, if only for cadence purposes.  best, Johnny<br/>&gt;</p><p>Exactly, but that&apos;s a situation which is about linearity above all.  the F<br/>&quot;Major&quot; arises only by the accident,  that some voice is moving upwards<br/>through melodic minor,  through an A natural.  the A is leading to B . . .<br/>I&apos;d be willing to bet that 95% of the time, an A-natural in c minor is<br/>leading to B.  . .yes,  it may be harmonized in an F Major triad,  but<br/>that triad is leading to a G triad,  and the A is leading to a B. .  .it<br/>does have to do with melody, and direction . .  The only time an F Major<br/>triad would appear would be for  linear reasons . . that voices moving<br/>through melodic minor happened to form a  &quot;modal mixture&quot; triad.</p><p>There may be a few exceptions, but I&apos;m willing to bet that before 1800,<br/>certainly, they&apos;re exceedingly rare.</p><p>By the way,  I am reminded of a particular Bach chorale,  where there are<br/>like 4 parallel Dominant 7ths (in 6/5 inversion) in a row. . .it sounds<br/>like Debussy!  really amazing . . and it&apos;s thanks to melodic minor.</p><p>BTW, Johnny,  I enjoy your Bach CD very much.  It&apos;s lovely.</p><p>CB</p></div><h3><a id=58732 href="#58732">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>5/24/2005 7:40:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 5/24/2005 10:19:06 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:chris@music.columbia.edu">chris@music.columbia.edu</a> writes:<br/>I&apos;d be willing to bet that 95% of the time, an A-natural in c minor is<br/>leading to B.<br/>First off, thanks for the kind comments on the AFMM Bach CD.</p><p>But back to the topic: if even 5% of the time there is a major IV chord in<br/>minor without a direct melodic minor orientation, it would support my contention<br/>that minor has 9 notes.</p><p>I believe this is the reasons all the colorful, chromatic works are based in<br/>minor: there are more notes to work with on a regular basis.</p><p>all best, Johnny</p></div>
