Problems<br/>&gt; aside this ensemble gets around and so therefore would the new tuning. It wouldn&apos;t be ready in a<br/>&gt; week though and recording would take longer. Normally performances are videoed so these could be<br/>&gt; streamed. For quicker results best try a midi person. But post the details and I&apos;ll try to sell<br/>&gt; the idea to the boss man.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>5/11/2001 12:23:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Although Keenan 21<br/>&gt; MOS provides more than enough material for a lifetime.
