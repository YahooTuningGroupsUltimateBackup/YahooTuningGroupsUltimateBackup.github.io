If anybody would like to advise Don as regards the bouncing problem I&apos;m sure he&apos;d be very grateful.</p><p>While I&apos;m here: Hello and good wishes to all. I suppose many of you will know that CNMI (Centre for New Musical Instruments) has been completely inactive for about two years now.  That is a long story, which I won&apos;t bore you with, but to all those of you who know me, a part of the reason I&apos;ve been out of contact for such a very long time has been due to the utter frustration of dealing with a university/institution which ought to have been bombed instead of Iraq, and indeed the degree of now seemingly wasted effort that I put into it.  Such is life.  I am hoping in future to put a different set of pieces together, and will certainly inform on any developments.  Also, when I have a new computer at home I&apos;ll be contacting some of you....</p><p>Meanwhile, please do not let the above colour the good news from Don pasted below - I especially recommend Don&apos;s website to you.</p><p>all best wishes,</p><p>Patrick</p><p>*****************************<br/>MESSAGE FROM DON:</p><p>Dear Tuning List,<br/>I would like to inform members of the new Microtonal Projects website:<br/><a href="http://www.microtonalprojects.co.uk">http://www.microtonalprojects.co.uk</a></p><p>The site is, as will be quite clear, still under construction, although its long term aims are, hopefully, apparent.</p><p>Although Microtonal Projects is primarily concerned to promote microtonal activities in the UK, composers, performers, researchers and instrument builders worldwide are invited to join our Network.</p><p>Sell-through CDs, books and scores have been negotiated through Tutti: it is hoped to establish a very focussed catalogue of solely microtonal items for sale on-line, all major credit cards accepted, with free shipping worldwide.  We are seeking professionally produced goods to sell &#xFFFD; please send us an email for more information.</p><p>For those in the UK please see the Events section for information on:</p><p>Steve Altoft&apos;s concert on 6 November, 2004 (St. Cyprian&apos;s Church, London): Steve will be playing microtonal trumpets in 24 and 19 divisions, and<br/>UK MicroFest 1 (18-19 March, 2005, St. Cyprian&apos;s Church, London) for which contributions are still sought for &apos;window&apos; sessions (details on the site, see events then UK MicroFest 1).</p><p>Finally, we are in search of a range of good quality articles on diverse subjects for the &apos;Resources&apos; section: in the course of time, these will be grouped into various categories.  There will be an emphasis on practical rather than theoretical approaches and we are particularly keen to have input from performers who have mastered microtonal techniques on conventional instruments, or who play new or adapted instruments.</p><p>I hope this will be of interest and that some on this list will be inspired to contribute.</p><p>Donald</p><p>Dr Donald Bousted<br/>75 Canbury Avenue<br/>Kingston-upon-Thames<br/>Surrey KT2 6JR</p><p>Tel: +44(0)20 8546 1424<br/>Mob: 07801 492926</p><p>e: <a href="mailto:info@microtonalprojects.co.uk">info@microtonalprojects.co.uk</a></p><p><a href="http://www.donaldbousted.co.uk">http://www.donaldbousted.co.uk</a><br/><a href="http://www.microtonalprojects.co.uk">http://www.microtonalprojects.co.uk</a></p></div>
