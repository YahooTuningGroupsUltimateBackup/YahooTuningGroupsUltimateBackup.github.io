Maybe I should have tried it first, but I<br/>&gt; have the prejudices of an algebraist.</p><p>Yes of course :-).</p><p>I can well understand the appeal of algebra - greatly enjoyed what I did of it<br/>as an undergraduate - group theory mainly and Galois theory. I did just a bit<br/>of galois theory for the geometry research but it wasn&apos;t my own idea, just<br/>followed a method suggested by a professor at the univ to prove the irrationality<br/>of certain expressions I needed to show were irrational.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
