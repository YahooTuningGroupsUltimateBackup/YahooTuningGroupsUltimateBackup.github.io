A shadow is cast on the wall by the spring. There are positions to &gt; which you can move the spring so that it will  cast a shadow on the wall, &gt; which resembles a sine wave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You could measure the shadow, and map the topology of the shadow.<br/>&gt;  or you could map the topology of the spring.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am suggesting that the advocates of whole number ratios, are mapping<br/>&gt; the &quot;shadow&quot;; whereas John &apos;Longitude&apos; Harrison was mapping the<br/>&gt; &quot;spring&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some people enjoy chasing shadows.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have fun!</p><p>*************************************</p><p>Hello Jeremy and Everyone,</p><p>Your usage of the term &quot;topology&quot; somehow struck a chord with my gut feeling about &quot;non-deterministic&quot; scales, as I call them, practiced by performers on non-fretted, non-keyboard instruments. To me the term &apos;topology&apos; accomodates a sophisticated level of fuzziness that appears to have the potential of simulating what goes on in the mind of a legendary performer of, say the violin, in the way of &quot;dynamic&quot; scales being created in real time as the piece is being played.</p><p>When I first looked at a book on Western music while I was in Turkey and saw the frequency layout for the piano keyboard given to several decimal place accuracy, my immediate reaction was a &quot;wow !&quot;. I said to myself, &quot;musicologists in the West must have nailed down the standard piano scale with such great accuracy&quot;.</p><p>Then I happened to look at Carl Seashore&apos;s book &quot;Psychology of Music&quot; (1938) and read the following observations on page 207:</p><p>&quot;. . . we note the following course of pitch intonation:</p><p>A plays the second note 0.15 of a tone sharp, B plays it true {he is referring to two violin players A and B}; A plays the third note true, B plays it 0.05 sharp; A plays the fourth note true, B plays it 0.2 of a tone sharp; A plays the fifth note true, B plays it 0.1 flat; A plays the sixth note 0.05 sharp, B plays it true; A plays the seventh note true, B plays it 0.05 flat; A plays the eight note 0.1 sharp, B plays it true.</p><p>This may suffice as a guide for the reading of phrasing through pitch. The melody is, of course, set by the composer. The player&apos;s interpretation consists in the adoption of a scale, for example, the natural scale, and then deviating from this for artistic values.&quot;</p><p>As you can imagine I was totally confused. I had the piano scale on one hand, accurate to several decimal places in Hz, and then Seasore&apos;s measurements on the violin, displaying deviations in the order of 30 cents from the tempered scale. The violin player deviating from an &quot;adopted&quot; scale -- I thought &quot;the scale&quot; was set in stone centuries ago by musical giants -- for artistic reasons was the most intriguing part for me.</p><p>However, the performer making up an ever-changing, dynamic scale at the micro level during the course of a performance made a lot of sense to my pedestrian instincts. The practice would allow the musician unfettered freedom of expression, at the micro level within certain norms, to reflect the ever-changing impressions in his/her inner soul. Furhermore, the performer would have the freedom of playing the same piece on &quot;different&quot; dynamic micro scales for each performance, to reflect the mood of his/her spiritual universe at that moment.</p><p>When I started making measurements on performances by master musicians of traditional Turkish music, I was swept off my feet to discover exactly the same practice, at a much bolder level.</p><p>If what I have said up to this point is sensible and coherent, -- I would not bet on it -- then the mathematical concept of &quot;topological spaces&quot; in some general sense might serve as a potentially useful &quot;setting&quot; for formulating, and hopefully characterizing, such structures found in performances, but not mentioned explicitly in theoretical constructs.</p><p>With regard to the &quot;spring&quot; analogy, I am not certain at this point to even speculate on whether the topology of the said &quot;made-up scales&quot; would represent the &quot;spring&quot; itself or its projection onto some subspace of the &quot;musical imagery&quot;, as Carl Seashore puts it, embedded in the individual performer&apos;s soul.</p><p>Can Akkoc</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>New DSL Internet Access from SBC &amp; Yahoo!</p></div>
