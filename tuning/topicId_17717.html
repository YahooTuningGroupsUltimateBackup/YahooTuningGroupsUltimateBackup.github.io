I&apos;m not sure there&apos;s an easy answer, but retro is not hip<br/>to those trying to be original, and go where no one has yet gone. And,<br/>with the incoming political bunch, I expect the mood of the country to<br/>go even more conservative and backwards....which means, folks who do<br/>creative art should try even harder to do their best work, as an<br/>antidote to the reactionary times ahead. Miles had a great quote, while<br/>referring to those jazzers who were just replaying all the bop licks<br/>from 40 years earlier...&quot;It&apos;s like going to bed with an old person who<br/>even smells old...&quot;<br/>    I look to the folks on this list, as well as others around the globe<br/>who are like minded, to forge ahead into the future, and do something<br/>profound and meaningful, and bring mystery and beauty to music once<br/>again...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=17721 href="#17721">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I&apos;m perfectly willing to accept both<br/>approaches.  The Burns PBS documentary, with its emphasis on<br/>the *historical* aspects of the development of jazz, clearly<br/>follows this &quot;classical&quot; approach.</p><p>-monz</p></div>
