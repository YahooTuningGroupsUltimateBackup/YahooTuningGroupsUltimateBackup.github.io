I don&apos;t give a rat&apos;s ass about the book, and would rather spend my time reading other stuff. Keep the discussion going, by all means, because I think it is of importance to others on the list, but maybe we could just title the message in a clear manner, and that way I (and others, I suspect) could avoid it entirely!</p><p>Thanks a lot,<br/>Jon</p></div>
