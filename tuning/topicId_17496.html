I find that I want to do a little<br/>&quot;deep listening&quot; but the video INSISTS on presenting information to<br/>me, so I don&apos;t get quite as far into the sounds....</p><p>Just a perception that others may or may not find interesting...</p><p>HOWEVER, from the point of view of &quot;cultural delivery&quot; the video is<br/>ESSENTIAL.  Bill would NEVER have been on any mass site with just<br/>audio.  Forgetabouddit.  It&apos;s a visual culture... audio won&apos;t cut it.</p><p>So, from a marketing perspective, aside from the fact that the video<br/>is so terrific, it is ESSENTIAL to have the video.</p><p>However, I still believe the AUDIO perception works best in just a<br/>dark room....</p><p>_______ ____ _____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
