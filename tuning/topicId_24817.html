It does seem that my<br/>answers are not liked by some.  The frustration is clearly on the side of<br/>insecurity.  As a result I come off as cocky because I am not insecure.<br/>That&apos;s part of the professional&apos;s stance.  I like to come off nonchalant in<br/>performance.</p><p>Rather than condemn, try as Paul mentioned, to realized that even if I was<br/>deluded and could only hear with a 2 or 3 cent accuracy, it still is not much<br/>of a difference to what I say I am doing, because people can&apos;t or don&apos;t<br/>register much of the difference, unless they count beats over time.</p><p>Even if I was deduced to be one way or the other, I&apos;d still just be one<br/>person in a sea of musicians.  It will prove nothing. For me to give you a<br/>perfect recording.  But it sounds like you don&apos;t really want a human being to<br/>play your music after all.  You wouldn&apos;t be the first person to distrust<br/>performers in playing their music.  Stick to your electronics because you can<br/>believe in them more.  People make mistakes and perhaps shouldn&apos;t be trusted.<br/> It&apos;s time for machines to play chess.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@orphonsoul.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2001 7:34:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 6/10/01 8:06 PM, &quot;<a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I come off as cocky because I am not insecure.</p><p>Nah it&apos;s just your being from BROOKLYN.<br/>BOYYYYYYYYYYYY</p></div>
