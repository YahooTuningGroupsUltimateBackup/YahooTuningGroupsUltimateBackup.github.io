If people are making music, I<br/>think it should be available to a wider audience, not just<br/>other microtonalists.  And it shouldn&apos;t be a discussion list<br/>at all.  It should be a store, maybe with a comments system.<br/>But you&apos;ll have to get someone to shell out almighty sums<br/>like $6/month for a domain..... good luck.  I&apos;m preparing<br/>myself to keep clicking through multiple ads and giving<br/>out my e-mail address to get music.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
