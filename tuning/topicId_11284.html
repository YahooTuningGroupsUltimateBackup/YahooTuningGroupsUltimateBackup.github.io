Can anyone help out?</p><p>Hello! Help me, please!</p><p>Some time ago, if I am not mistaken, in corporation &quot;Motorola&quot; was<br/>created the unique musical instrument - &quot;Scalatron&quot; (in 1975) with<br/>31-tones equal temperament (31- step by division of an octave).</p><p>I would like to know - continue now works on creation of similar musical<br/>instruments? This direction can have brilliant continuation - on a modern<br/>microelectronic technological basis. If you can help to me, I would like<br/>to contact to the representatives, to anyone, known to you of<br/>corporation, for more detailed statement of some ideas in this plan.</p><p>Beforehand to you is grateful.</p><p>Gennadiy KOGUT.</p><p><a href="mailto:gennadiy@kiev-page.com.ua">gennadiy@kiev-page.com.ua</a></p><p>     Also, except for possible server downtime, this URL is correct for<br/>the radio show <a href="http://132.194.200.113:8000">http://132.194.200.113:8000</a>, although some players prefer<br/><a href="http://132.194.200.113:8000">132.194.200.113:8000</a> plain.<br/>    Someone expressed concern that my show<br/>may be encouraging mp3 piracy, since I am broadcasting music without the<br/>express permission of some of the artists involved. Let me assure you that<br/>I am following the rules of ethical broadcasting. The music I am<br/>broadcasting has either been sent to me with the understanding that I<br/>would make the mp3 files freely available, or is published by a record<br/>label, in which case it comes under the copyright act of some year or<br/>other. In any case, I have an internet broadcasting licence (cheap at only<br/>$20.00!), I am playing no artist more than 3 times an hour on average, and<br/>each broadcast lasts more than 5 hours, and dem&apos;s de rules. RIAA is still<br/>hashing out the royalty schedule, so it may be that I will have to stop<br/>broadcasting commercial CDs if they want too much.</p><p>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
