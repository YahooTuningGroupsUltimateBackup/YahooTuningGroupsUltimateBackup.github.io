A 7-limit major tetrad is, in just intonation, a 4-element chord with the interval ratios 7:6:5:4, sounding roughly like a dominant seventh chord (that&apos;s why it has a good use in bluesy music). In 22EDO, this is a chord with the pattern 7 steps, 6 steps and 5 steps, or stacked 0-7-13-18. The point is that in 22EDO, the minor-seventh-like interval formed by 18 steps is a quite good approximation for the interval ratio 7/4, making the chord distinctly more consonant than in 12EDO.</p><p>&gt; The main chord pattern is based off of this construct (from bottom<br/>&gt; to top)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bb, Eb, G, D in 12 TET so that translates to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5 steps, 4 steps, and 7 steps in 22 EDO as intervals or<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as the &quot;scale steps&quot;  0, 5, 9, 16  stacked vertically in 22 EDO.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hmm - aren&apos;t these numbers the numbers of steps in 12EDO? I think Bb-Eb-G-D in 22EDO steps is 9 steps, 7 steps and 13 steps, isn&apos;t it?</p><p>So it seems my guess was quite wrong.

I&apos;m still pretty ignorant of the<br/>&gt; &gt; finer points of tuning and wouldn&apos;t know a 7-limit chord if it hit<br/>&gt; &gt; me. But perhaps you (or someone else) can help in this respect.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was using terminology from Paul Erlich&apos;s paper on 22EDO (<br/>&gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-decatonic.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-decatonic.pdf</a>). A 7-limit major<br/>&gt; tetrad is, in just intonation, a 4-element chord with the interval ratios<br/>&gt; 7:6:5:4, sounding roughly like a dominant seventh chord (that&apos;s why it has a<br/>&gt; good use in bluesy music). In 22EDO, this is a chord with the pattern 7<br/>&gt; steps, 6 steps and 5 steps, or stacked 0-7-13-18. The point is that in<br/>&gt; 22EDO, the minor-seventh-like interval formed by 18 steps is a quite good<br/>&gt; approximation for the interval ratio 7/4, making the chord distinctly more<br/>&gt; consonant than in 12EDO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The main chord pattern is based off of this construct (from bottom<br/>&gt; &gt; to top)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bb, Eb, G, D in 12 TET so that translates to<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 5 steps, 4 steps, and 7 steps in 22 EDO as intervals or<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; as the &quot;scale steps&quot; 0, 5, 9, 16 stacked vertically in 22 EDO.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmm - aren&apos;t these numbers the numbers of steps in 12EDO? I think Bb-Eb-G-D<br/>&gt; in 22EDO steps is 9 steps, 7 steps and 13 steps, isn&apos;t it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So it seems my guess was quite wrong. Strange, I was sure I heard a minor<br/>&gt; seventh in the first chord of your piece.<br/>&gt; Gotta try out this chord myself...<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; Hans Straub<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=84977 href="#84977">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2009 9:29:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Hans,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The  way I&apos;m doing this is playing a 12 TET guitar that has a midi<br/>&gt; pickup.<br/>&gt; The midi then goes to pianoteq which is running with a 22 EDO<br/>&gt; tuning.
