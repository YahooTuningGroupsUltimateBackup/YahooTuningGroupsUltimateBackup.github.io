This discussion may<br/>raise some basic issues not only about the compromises of keyboard<br/>tunings as they may influence singers and performers on other<br/>non-fixed-pitch instruments, but about how ideals for intonation may<br/>vary along with the stylistic context.</p><p>In writing on these subjects, I should make clear my own orientation<br/>and biases: my main focus in on medieval, Renaissance, and Manneristic<br/>music of Europe during the era of around 1200-1650, an era in which<br/>3-limit and 5-limit just intonation (JI) systems define the vocal<br/>ideal. For keyboards, 3-limit JI (Pythagorean) systems are the norm<br/>during the medieval era, with meantone coming into vogue around 1450<br/>and serving as one index of the transition from late medieval to early<br/>Renaissance style often taken to begin around the era of the young<br/>Dufay (c. 1420).</p><p>Here I might emphasize that my views on this music -- my &quot;Top 40&quot; as<br/>it were -- derive not only from reading treatises, as important as<br/>these are, but from many years of listening, playing, and<br/>improvising. It also fair to point out that my intense interest in<br/>intonational issues is quite recent, and that many people here have<br/>far more experience in such issues than I can claim. My special<br/>interest has been in the techniques of medieval and Renaissance<br/>verticality: the ways in which three or more voices form vertical<br/>combinations and progress from one combination to the next.</p><p>While the treatment of sonorities around 1600 featuring bold use of<br/>the seventh is a topic for an article in itself, I would like here to<br/>set a framework for such an article by considering some general<br/>issues.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Tonality and verticality in Western European music<br/>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>From my perspective, an important observation about &quot;tonality&quot; in<br/>Western European music is that major-minor key tonality is only one of<br/>several historical styles providing material for today&apos;s practices --<br/>along with more recent developments beginning around the epoch of<br/>Debussy (c. 1900).</p><p>If we survey the history of Western European composition for three or<br/>more voices, starting around 1200 with the epoch of Perotin -- about<br/>800 years of history -- we find that the era of major-minor key<br/>tonality (often called the &quot;common practice period&quot;) runs roughly from<br/>Stradella or Corelli to Wagner, let us say 1670-1900. This era covers<br/>something like 230 years out of our 800 years -- only about 25%-30% of<br/>the total.</p><p>Of course, the term &quot;tonality&quot; can mean different things to different<br/>people. While the idea of a vertical center, corresponding for example<br/>to a modal final, can be just as relevant to Gothic as to Classic<br/>music, the stable and unstable sonorities and progressions defining<br/>this &quot;centrality&quot; can vary radically. Each system is just as &quot;natural&quot;<br/>as another -- or, from another viewpoint, each is equally a product of<br/>art and style.</p><p>-------------------------------------<br/>2. Combinative vs. chordal approaches<br/>-------------------------------------</p><p>One way of distinguishing medieval-Manneristic practice of the era<br/>1200-1650 or so with the &quot;tonal&quot; practice of 1670-1900 might contrast<br/>the &quot;combinative&quot; vs. &quot;chordal&quot; nature of these practices -- both<br/>approaches playing a significant role in 20th-century practice and<br/>theory.</p><p>In a combinative approach, the &quot;elementary&quot; units are two-voice<br/>intervals and progressions, which are artfully combined or united to<br/>form compelling multi-voice sonorities and cadences. This approach<br/>applies roughly from Perotin through Monteverdi, and is reflected, for<br/>example, by the remark of Agostino Agazzari in 1607 that to master the<br/>new art of continuo playing, a performer must be familiar with the<br/>rule of counterpoint calling for progression to &quot;the nearest<br/>consonance.&quot;</p><p>In such a combinative approach, not only the plurality of modes or<br/>octave-species but the rich vocabulary of vertical progressions often<br/>lead to a delightful variety and fluidity of motions -- in<br/>16th-century styles, for example, to diverse progressions of the bass<br/>by seconds, thirds, fourths, and fifths. As the Monteverdi brothers<br/>point out in their manifesto of 1607, the same year as Agazzari&apos;s<br/>treatise, a piece may move through a variety of modes.</p><p>By around 1670 or 1680, however, a new practice has emerged in which<br/>the &quot;elementary&quot; units seem to be not intervals, but chords forming<br/>keys, a paradigm codified by Rameau (1722) and his successors. This<br/>paradigm remains the norm until the epoch of Debussy around 1900, when<br/>&quot;post-tonal&quot; (including &quot;neo-modal&quot;) approaches begin to set the<br/>direction of much new music.</p><p>While the era of 1670-1900 is often called the &quot;common practice<br/>period,&quot; a better term might be &quot;last common practice period,&quot; since<br/>after around 1900, there seem to be a number of competing models: for<br/>example the neo-modality of Debussy or Bartok or Vaughan Williams; the<br/>12-tone pantonalism of Schoenberg; various approaches using a range of<br/>equal temperaments (n-tet&apos;s) and extended JI systems, etc.</p><p>These newer styles may draw both on the medieval, Renaissance, and<br/>Manneristic heritage of intervals, combinations, and modes; and on the<br/>late Baroque, Classic, and Romantic heritage of chords and keys.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------<br/>3. Concords, discords, and dual-purpose sonorities<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>In considering intonational ideas as well as the pragmatic compromises<br/>which may be required for keyboard tunings and the like, we should<br/>focus on the stylistic expectations which can color intonational<br/>preferences.</p><p>For example, to a singer of 16th-century polyphony, a pure 5:4 major<br/>third might serve as one definition of ideal &quot;concord,&quot; and likewise a<br/>7:4 minor seventh to a singer of barbershop harmony.</p><p>However, from a 13th-century Continental European perspective, a major<br/>third of _any_ proportion is an inherently unstable interval, although<br/>a _relatively_ blending one. Tuning this interval as a Pythagorean<br/>ditone, equal to two 9:8 whole-tones or 81:64, fits both the melodic<br/>regularity of the music and the &quot;dual-purpose&quot; nature of this vertical<br/>interval, neither stable nor urgently discordant.</p><p>From a 16th century perspective, where a 5:4 major third is regarded<br/>as a richly stable concord (like a 3:2 fifth in Gothic practice), the<br/>81:64 tuning would be out of place, indeed &quot;discordant&quot; not only in an<br/>acoustical sense with its prominent beating, but in a _stylistic_<br/>sense with its beating in a place where smooth and restful blending is<br/>desired.</p><p>From this same 16th-century perspective, however, a 7:4 minor seventh<br/>may have an effect similar to that of a minor seventh at around 16:9<br/>or 9:5, or at the intermediate tunings between these latter ratios<br/>likely on a 12-tet lute or a meantone keyboard -- a clear discord,<br/>serving as a moment of urgent tension rather than independent euphony<br/>or &quot;concord.&quot; To propose that either vocal intonation or keyboard<br/>tunings be altered in order to maximize the acoustical consonance of<br/>this interval may seem less than intuitively obvious from this<br/>stylistic viewpoint.</p><p>For a performance of 20th-century music based on relatively concordant<br/>or even stable sonorities involving minor sevenths, and arguably also<br/>for some later 19th century pieces where pervasive seventh sonorities<br/>may be felt to _approach_ stability, a 7:4 tuning becomes as &quot;natural&quot;<br/>as the ideal tuning of a Gothic fifth at 3:2 or a Renaissance major<br/>third at 5:4. Indeed, pianist Dave Hill has very aptly used the<br/>augmented sixths available on an instrument tuned in a 12-note version<br/>of 1/4-comma meantone to approximate the 7:4 minor seventh in a<br/>rendition of the Blues.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------<br/>4. Nature and style: trines, triads, tetrads, etc.<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>Mother Nature sets some parameters and constraints on musics and<br/>tuning systems, but it is the musicians who determine style.</p><p>Thus Mother Nature has established a state of affairs where, in most<br/>timbres at least, a 5:4 major third will be smoothest in theory and<br/>practice, and an 81:64 major third much more &quot;beatful,&quot; with other<br/>alternatives such as 1/6-comma meantone or 12-tet falling somewhere<br/>between in their &quot;restful&quot; or &quot;active&quot; effect. However, it is musical<br/>style which may help to determine which effect may be more fitting.</p><p>A very crude possible outline of the standards of stability in<br/>European and related compositional practices might be something like<br/>the following, with examples of saturated sonorities indicated using a<br/>&quot;MIDI-like&quot; system of notation where C4 is middle C, and higher<br/>numbers show higher octaves.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Era       Rough dates     Sonority/           String/Frequency<br/>                          Ideal tuning        ratios<br/>=======================================================================<br/>Trinic    1200-1450       Trine (D3-A3-D4)    6:4:3/2:3:4<br/>                          3-limit<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>         (Transition, c. 1400-1450: modified Pythagorean tuning<br/>          with some schisma thirds and sixths near 5-based ratios)<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Early     1450-1670       Triad (G3-B3-D4)    15:12:10/4:5:6<br/>tertian                   5-limit<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>         (Transition, c. 1640-1670: late modal/combinative style<br/>          leads to chordal/key system as modified meantone leads to<br/>          well-temperaments)<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Later     1670-1900       Triad (G3-B3-D4)    15:12:10/4:5:6<br/>tertian                   5-limit<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>        (Transition, c. 1840-1900: late Romantic style uses<br/>         pervasive seventh chords as dual-purpose sonorities,<br/>         possibly inviting 7-limit interpretations)<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&quot;Modern&quot;  1900-?         Various choices:<br/>                         e.g. tetrads<br/>                         G3-B3-D4-F4          105:84:70:60/4:5:6:7<br/>                         E3-G3-B3-D4           21:18:14:12/12:14:18:21<br/>                         E3-A3-D4-G4           64:48:36:27/27:36:48:64<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>This table may reflect two artistic processes in various periods. The<br/>first is a stylistic tendency to treat certain unstable intervals as<br/>more and more independently euphonious until they eventually become<br/>stable concords -- or, as in the 20th century, until the distinction<br/>of stability/instability may itself yield place to other concepts.</p><p>The second process is a tendency for intervals attaining a status of<br/>independent euphony or even stability to invite a more acoustically<br/>blending intonation, in contrast to the more &quot;active&quot; or complex<br/>ratios which may have previously prevailed.</p><p>These tendencies do not apply in a simple or linear fashion to all<br/>eras and intervals, of course.  Thus, although unstable, combinations<br/>such as G3-D4-A4 (9:6:4) or G3-C4-F4 (16:12:9) are evidently often<br/>deemed relatively concordant &quot;dual-purpose&quot; sonorities in the music of<br/>Perotin around 1200, but treated as clear discords in Renaissance<br/>style around 1500. As it happens, these sonorities receive an ideally<br/>euphonious tuning in medieval Pythagorean intonation, in contrast with<br/>the greater compromises of Renaissance meantone -- and the &quot;near-pure&quot;<br/>intonation of 12-tet on 20th-century keyboards in an era where these<br/>quintal/quartal sonorities are treated as &quot;concordant&quot; and even<br/>stable.</p><p>------------------------------------------------<br/>5. Intonational ideals and pragmatic compromises<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>In discussing &quot;Mother Nature&quot; and style, we might distinguish between<br/>two factors: (1) The musical and intonational ideals of a given period<br/>or style; and (2) The specific compromises which may be required in<br/>tuning fixed-pitch instruments, for example.</p><p>While the element of compromise involved in most fixed-pitch tunings<br/>is well-recognized, the room for differences in intonational ideals<br/>themselves may be an equally important factor influencing vocal<br/>tunings as well as keyboard tunings. Let me consider a striking<br/>example that seems to fit with my own experience.</p><p>In 1555, as part of his treatise on the adaptation of the Greek<br/>chromatic and enharmonic genera to modern practice, Nicola Vicentino<br/>surveys the intervals available on his archicembalo or &quot;superharpsi-<br/>chord&quot; dividing each whole-tone into five parts.</p><p>Here we have an intrepid musical explorer by no means bashful in<br/>reporting, for example, that he finds the &quot;proximate minor third&quot; a<br/>diesis (about 1/5-tone) wider than the usual meantone minor third,<br/>which he describes as approximating a ratio of &quot;5-1/2:4-1/2&quot; (11:9),<br/>as rather concordant.</p><p>However, Vicentino finds what might be called the &quot;minimal seventh&quot; a<br/>diesis narrower than the usual minor seventh (e.g. Eb-C# in a usual<br/>12-note meantone tuning) -- very close, we might note, to 7:4 -- as<br/>quite dissonant, more so than the &quot;proximate major sixth&quot; a diesis<br/>larger than major (e.g. C#-Bb), which we might add is not far from<br/>12:7.</p><p>Indeed in a typical 16th-century setting where sevenths are typically<br/>treated quite cautiously, with the suspension the most prominent<br/>conventional usage, a near-7:4 minor seventh may suggest another<br/>flavor of dissonance rather than any obvious &quot;concord.&quot; This statement<br/>may also hold for the late combinative style of the early 17th<br/>century, where bold seventh combinations are a kind of &quot;special<br/>effect&quot;; and even for 18th-century style, where combinations of this<br/>kind are set in deliberate contrast to restful concord.</p><p>Similarly, the late 16th-century theorist Vincenzo Galilei, himself a<br/>radical theorist and noteworthy advocate of bold seventh combinations,<br/>declares that just as nature has made intervals such as a 2:1 octave<br/>consonant, so nature has made other intervals such as a 9:5 seventh<br/>dissonant.</p><p>Thus to seek a 7:4 minor seventh in a Renaissance or Manneristic<br/>setting seems to me a less than obvious ideal, unless one is<br/>experimenting with creatively anachronistic elements.</p><p>In contrast, if we ask why all concords on a 16th-century meantone<br/>keyboard are not pure -- fifths and minor thirds, for example, in a<br/>1/4-comma tuning -- then the pragmatics of keyboard tuning with a<br/>limited number of fixed pitches per octave may be of special<br/>relevance. Theorists such as Zarlino recognize this distinction when<br/>they write that voices lean toward the pure ratios of JI (in this era<br/>5-limit JI), while keyboard instruments generally are tempered by<br/>irrational ratios in deference to practical considerations.</p><p>Even in the case of voices or other flexible-pitch instruments,<br/>intonational ideals may be in tension. For example, singers of the<br/>late 15th century may well have gravitated at once to the newer ideal<br/>of smooth vertical thirds and sixths, and to the older ideal of narrow<br/>cadential semitones. This dilemma might occur in a passage such as the<br/>following</p><p>    G4     F#4 G4<br/>    D4  D4     D4<br/>    B4  A3     G3<br/>... G3  D3     G2</p><p>Here we have a suspension in the highest voice of 7-6 in relation to<br/>the tenor, leading to a cadential progression of M6-8 -- and also a<br/>4-3 (or 11-10) suspension between this voice and the bass. From the<br/>viewpoint of tertian euphony -- a concern reflected in this epoch by<br/>the adoption of meantone for keyboards -- the suspended fourth should<br/>resolve to a smooth major third with the bass (and major sixth with<br/>the tenor) tuned as pure as possible.</p><p>Thus the G4-F#4 resolution in this voice might from this viewpoint<br/>involve a semitone of 16:15, or ~112 cents, permitting a resolution<br/>from a 4:3 fourth (or 8:3 eleventh) with the bass to a pure 5:4 major<br/>third (or 5:2 major tenth) -- and likewise from a 16:9 minor seventh<br/>to a pure 5:3 major sixth with the tenor.</p><p>However, with freely intoning voices as well as meantone keyboards,<br/>such pure or near-pure thirds and sixths imply rather wide cadential<br/>semitones. In medieval practice, where active and unstable thirds and<br/>sixths are the norm, narrower diatonic semitones for voices and<br/>keyboards alike are practical, at or near the Pythagorean 256:253 (~90<br/>cents). In Renaissance practice, the shift to meantone on keyboards<br/>suggests more generally an intonational ideal in which smoothly<br/>blending thirds and sixths become a priority, with diatonic semitones<br/>accordingly widened.</p><p>However, as Mark Lindley notes, a survey of theoretical writings<br/>around 1500 on the topic of large and small semitones may suggest not<br/>only a certain degree of confusion to be expected in such a<br/>transitional era, but also an artistic ambivalence about changing<br/>intonational ideals.</p><p>&quot;Mother Nature&quot; -- and the applicable mathematics -- remain the same;<br/>styles and artistic choices change.</p><p>------------------------------------------------<br/>6. Intonational pluralism in theory and practice<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>Like the participants on this Tuning List, 16th-century theorists<br/>often note the plurality of tunings and temperaments in actual use. A<br/>typical categorization might go like this:</p><p>         1. VOICES. Theorists such as Zarlino regard just<br/>            intonation as natural for voices, in contrast<br/>            to the temperaments customary for fixed-pitch<br/>            instruments. In such an ideal scheme, the<br/>            concordant intervals of Zarlino&apos;s _senario_<br/>            (with ratios defined by the &quot;sonorous numbers&quot;<br/>            or integers from 1 to 6, plus the minor sixth<br/>            at 8:5) tend always to occur in their pure<br/>            ratios; other intervals such as whole-tones<br/>            (9:8 or 10:9) or minor sevenths (9:5 or 16:9)<br/>            may vary in size.</p><p>         2. LUTES. By around 1545, a 12-note tuning in<br/>            equal semitones is regarded as &quot;standard&quot;<br/>            for these fretted instruments, although<br/>            certain more complicated tunings might<br/>            sometimes be applied.</p><p>         3. KEYBOARDS. Meantone tuning with narrowed<br/>            fifths is regarded as the norm, with<br/>            1/4-comma tuning (pure 5:4 major thirds)<br/>            evidently one common choice and Zarlino&apos;s<br/>            2/7-comma tuning (major and minor thirds<br/>            equally compromised) another.</p><p>In keeping with these standards, writers note, for example, the<br/>intonational difficulties of managing an ensemble where lutes and<br/>keyboards sound together.</p><p>Also, as we might expect, there are some contrasting views both about<br/>what people _are_ singing and playing in practice, and about what they<br/>_should_ be singing or playing.</p><p>Thus Vincenzo Galilei, while agreeing with his former teacher and<br/>frequent adversary Zarlino that there are three categories of tuning,<br/>argues that unaccompanied voices in fact tend toward a kind of<br/>intonation with equal whole-tones (&quot;interval consistency,&quot; as Paul<br/>Erlich might say) somewhat closer to a keyboard than to a lute. In<br/>other words, he proposes that voices lean to a kind of meantone<br/>temperament not too far from 2/7-comma, which he agrees with Zarlino<br/>in preferring for keyboards.</p><p>Vicentino suggests two possible paradigms, both realized in his<br/>archicembalo tunings. For his &quot;enharmonic&quot; music using novel melodic<br/>and sometimes also vertical intervals based on dieses or fifthtones,<br/>he urges singers to take his instrument (in its 31-tone division of<br/>the octave) as the norm. However, his alternative tuning would provide<br/>a basis for what has here been termed &quot;adaptive JI,&quot; with very slight<br/>shifts from a usual meantone intonation in order to make concords pure<br/>-- fifths and minor thirds as well as major thirds (already at 5:4 in<br/>a 1/4-comma temperament).</p><p>One curious statement by Zarlino about the comma seems of special<br/>interest here[1]:</p><p>          &quot;This interval would be very annoying to the listener,<br/>           more so because such an interval is not heard in<br/>           voices, which can tune intervals higher or lower<br/>           as desired and through this bring perfection to<br/>           any composition. This is not true with artificial<br/>           instruments, because art can never equal nature.<br/>           Voices do tend to approximate more closely those<br/>           instruments that are tuned to the Pythagorean<br/>           steps, in which these minute intervals are not<br/>           present, than those that are perfectly tuned in<br/>           accord with the perfection of the harmonic numbers.<br/>           Thus it might be said that temperament is more<br/>           useful to the musician than perfect tuning. For<br/>           scientific purposes the latter is more useful<br/>           because from it the true ratio of each interval<br/>           may be determined, and, most important, because<br/>           voices (as I have said elsewhere) seek the<br/>           perfection of intervals.&quot;</p><p>It might be argued, for example, that a system of &quot;adaptive JI&quot; like<br/>that of Vicentino or Erlich combines some traits mentioned by Zarlino<br/>and Galilei. Vertical intervals are pure, while melodic intervals are<br/>_almost_ uniform, varying by only 1/4 syntonic comma or ~5.38 cents if<br/>the tuning is based on 1/4-comma meantone, for example.</p><p>-------------<br/>7. Conclusion<br/>-------------</p><p>To say that &quot;Mother Nature&quot; dictates musical style or intonation would<br/>be rather like saying that the laws of physics dictate architectural<br/>style. Nature indeed in each case offers a range of structural and<br/>aesthetic choices while imposing certain limitations, but the<br/>architect or musician operating within a certain cultural background<br/>and setting selects from among these choices.</p><p>One problem in generalizing about intonational ideals over an era such<br/>as the Western European key tonality period of around 1670-1900 is<br/>that such an era includes many epochs and stylistic currents. While<br/>Vivaldi and Wagner are often seen as belonging to the same &quot;common<br/>practice,&quot; I would not necessarily assume that the same aesthetics of<br/>tuning for minor sevenths would apply to both composers and epochs.</p><p>From another point of view, the practices of 1670-1900 represent only<br/>what I call the &quot;later tertian&quot; era of composed European music; the<br/>Gothic multi-voice polyphony of 1200-1420, for example, represents an<br/>era of around equal duration.</p><p>One advantage of the Tuning List is that we can indeed compare<br/>practices and intonations, thus getting a wider view of what nature<br/>permits and artistic choice may favor.</p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>----</p><p>1.Gioseffo Zarlino, _The Art of Counterpoint: Part Three of Le<br/>Istitutioni harmoniche, 1558_, trans.
