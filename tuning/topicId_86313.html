If so, that would match my suspicion.</p><p>  However, I didn&apos;t see any experiment on the wiki as to determining at what point the brain starts clustering too many close notes in a chord together as &quot;noise&quot; and not picking up any the additional notes/tones added.  So, personally, I experimented with chords to see how much I could cluster tones before they started to &quot;mute/&apos;mask&apos; each other out&quot; from being too close.  And I came up with the following chords</p><p>1) C D G A B C (5 tone)<br/>2) C D E G A B C (6)<br/>3) C D E F G A B C (all 7)</p><p>     It seems to me some of the patterns are that<br/>A) Any more than 5 unique tones per octave begins to &quot;blur&quot; IE 1 and 2 barely sound any different<br/>B) There seems to be a limit to how many half-steps you can use in a chord the second half-step in the third chord blurs so much you can barely even hear it<br/>C) I wonder if, for example, the brain hears multiple root tones in 1 via virtual pitch and still can handle it fairly well...but by around 2 or 3 it is handling so many virtual pitches it partly gives up and &quot;forgets&quot; to hear much of the F.</p><p>    Of course, I&apos;d be eager to hear if anyone has done a more formal experiment concerning this sort of thing, especially concerning psychoacoustics of several notes close together (as opposed to just 2 note ala Plomp and Llevelt).  Any ideas?</p><p>   The greater application I&apos;m looking for in tuning is would it maximize consonance for large chords to, say, distribute small intervals within a chord in a certain fashion and/or should we have a note-per-octave limit system to help us gauge the consonance of a chord?</p><p>_,_._,___</p></div><h3><a id=86320 href="#86320">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2010 10:40:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>You are welcome</p><p>Register is crucially important with clusters - more so than &quot;normal&quot;<br/>chords.</p><p>(Though much of what many post seems to ignore register I find register is<br/>vitial to many observations of the quality of a chord as well as spacing)</p><p>And.. please explain the meaning of &quot;root tones&quot; in the context of clusters.</p><p>And Mike, the next place to stop with regard to tone clusters and their<br/>musical meaning is</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Ruggles">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Ruggles</a></p><p>and listen here:</p><p><a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?hl=en&source=hp&q=youtube+carl+ruggles&oq=&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=SaB1S9bmGoWMNqrWzZcP&sa=X&oi=video_result_group&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CBAQqwQwAA#">http://video.google.com/videosearch?hl=en&source=hp&q=youtube+carl+ruggles&oq=&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=SaB1S9bmGoWMNqrWzZcP&sa=X&oi=video_result_group&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CBAQqwQwAA#</a></p><p>This music is all about texture in my opinion.

I can&apos;t for the life of me figure<br/>how it is so gloriously consonant&quot;</p><p>A few hints I noticed to how he may have managed it:</p><p>A)     If there are 5 notes between 1/1 and 9/8, it&apos;s reasonable to assume many of the tones are close enough together to form a chorus effect...in which case the brain combines two slightly different tones into one.  Also note: Plomp and Llevelt&apos;s roughness experiment noted two sine waves actually get more consonant when extremely close (IE within under 15 cents of each other).</p><p>B)   He says specifically &quot;The trick here is that I made the beating proportional to the pitch.  In other words, the highest note beats at the fastest rate&quot;.  This also makes sense: Plomp and Llevelt&apos;s dissonance curves show critical band gets smaller at higher frequencies IE tones can be closer together.  On another level, it makes sense as the beating between two tones creates its own tone (which is the rate of beating).<br/>   So if you have the tones 200hz and 300hz the beating rate is 100hz....and if you also have 400hz and 450hz the beating rate is 50hz.  So the tones you hear are 50,100,200,300,400,450...giving the impression of a 1:2:4:6:8:9 chord from &quot;only&quot; 4 notes.  My guess is he&apos;s doing something quite similar.</p><p>C) In general, the ear becomes more tolerant of dissonance when notes are split binaurally (another trick Dave Seidel appears to exploit).  This is easy enough to try yourself: put on headphones and play the chord C E F G A C in both ears.  Now play C E G in one ear and F A C in the other...much clearer isn&apos;t it?</p><p>&gt;&quot;I wonder if there is an optimum frequency for a chord to sound clear, cause even a 4;5;6 sounds like mud when played too low.&quot;<br/>   So do I...honestly that question is at least partly beyond me.  I do know the critical band at low frequencies (on Plomp and Llevelt&apos;s curve) is quite wide and that causes the mind to have more trouble distinguishing tones at very low frequencies.  But I swear there is also an emotional/psychological aspect I don&apos;t understand IE why does the exact same chord (IE 4:5:6) have different moods when played at different root pitches?</p><p>&gt;&quot;So maybe close clusters can sound shimmering and consonant in their optimum frequency without &apos;interference from other notes.&quot;</p><p>    Indeed, maybe there is a loophole in there somewhere that can give more options through which to achieve consonance (at least mathematically).   It seems putting close clusters in the right places can bring focus to one of the two close tones, rather than come across as two separate clashing tones.</p><p>  What I really find interesting about the experiment is the idea of creating the illusion of tones via beating that are not actual notes in the chords (as in my 200hz 300hz...example above).  I figure this could be used to give the illusion of larger chords without much of the added dissonance usually associated with larger chords.</p></div><h3><a id=86363 href="#86363">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2010 10:17:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris&gt;&quot;bitonality is actually a bit hard to do<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytonality">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytonality</a>&quot;</p><p>If I read that correctly, polytonality has to do with the use of two different keys simultaneously.<br/>My example of the chord<br/>  18:21:24:26:28<br/>........being split by the mind into<br/>    6:7:8   (summarizing 18:21:24)<br/>        and<br/>      12:13:14 (summarizing 24:26:28)<br/>...assumes the chord   18:21:24:26:28 is in just one key (albeit a rather &quot;high limit&quot; one).<br/>So I doubt it fits into the polytonallity paradigm.  I&apos;m assuming if a chord is too high-limit (JI-wise) and complex for the brain to handle it tries to split it up into lower-limit sections and interpret it as such.<br/>   And if the brain can&apos;t figure a way to split it up...I figure it takes it as noise and/or &quot;lack of resolve&quot;.</p><p>  I also figure a 18:21:24:25:28 chord would be enough to confuse the brain as the 24:25:28 part can&apos;t be digested/divided into a lower limit form since even though 24 and 28 can be divided evenly by 2, 25 can not.  I could be wrong but so far, of all the chord types I&apos;ve tried I found the brain starts having trouble when it can&apos;t reduce a chord into parts of around the twelfth harmonic or less (IE 13/12)...and 25/24 would obviously be beyond that.</p></div><h3><a id=86365 href="#86365">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forr&#xF3; &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2010 11:15:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 13 Feb 2010, at 3:17 PM, Michael wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris&gt;&quot;bitonality is actually a bit hard to do<br/>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytonality">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytonality</a>&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I read that correctly, polytonality has to do with the use of &gt; two different keys simultaneously.</p><p>Not exactly.

In other words, the highest note beats at the fastest rate&quot;.&nbsp; This also makes sense: Plomp and Llevelt&apos;s dissonance curves show critical band gets smaller at higher frequencies IE tones can be closer together.&nbsp; On another level, it makes sense as the beating between two tones creates its own tone (which is the rate of beating).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; So if you have the tones 200hz and 300hz the beating rate is 100hz....and if you also have 400hz and 450hz the beating rate is 50hz.&nbsp; So the tones you hear are 50,100,200,300, 400,450.. .giving the impression of a 1:2:4:6:8:9 chord from &quot;only&quot; 4 notes.&nbsp; My guess is he&apos;s doing something quite similar.</p><p>C) In general, the ear becomes more tolerant of dissonance when notes are split binaurally (another trick Dave Seidel appears to exploit).&nbsp; This is easy enough to try yourself: put on headphones and play the chord C E F G A C in both ears.&nbsp; Now play C E G in one ear and F A C in the other...much clearer isn&apos;t it?</p><p>&gt;&quot;I wonder if there is an optimum frequency for&nbsp;a chord to sound clear, cause even a 4;5;6 sounds like mud when played too low.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; So do I...honestly that question is at least partly beyond me.&nbsp; I do know the critical band at low frequencies (on Plomp and Llevelt&apos;s curve) is quite wide and that causes the mind to have more trouble distinguishing tones at very low frequencies.&nbsp; But I swear there is also an emotional/psycholog ical aspect I don&apos;t understand IE why does the exact same chord (IE 4:5:6) have different moods when played at different root pitches?</p><p>&gt;&quot;So maybe close clusters&nbsp;can sound shimmering and consonant in their&nbsp;optimum frequency without&nbsp;&apos;interference from other notes.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, maybe there is a loophole in there somewhere that can give more options through which to achieve consonance (at least mathematically) .&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems putting close clusters in the right places can bring focus to one of the two close tones, rather than come across as two separate clashing tones.</p><p>&nbsp; What I really find interesting about the experiment is the idea of creating the illusion of tones via beating that are not actual notes in the chords (as in my 200hz 300hz...example above).&nbsp; I figure this could be used to give the illusion of larger chords without much of the added dissonance usually associated with larger chords.</p><p>michae</p><p>      __________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Yahoo!7: Catch-up on your favourite Channel 7 TV shows easily, legally, and for free at PLUS7. <a href="http://www.tv.yahoo.com.au/plus7">www.tv.yahoo.com.au/plus7</a></p></div><h3><a id=86475 href="#86475">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2010 7:58:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Also try smearing<br/>fabc (there is a minor second Michael!!)<br/>df#ga (and another!!)&quot;</p><p>Very cool...it will be interesting to delve further into why these work considering the standard &quot;minor seconds are illegal in chords&quot; credo upon most musicians.

In music school they teach you major, minor, augmented, add2 &amp; diminished triads, similar constructs with 7th tones added on...and then things like 9ths where they virtually always insist on having the &quot;minor second&quot; an octave plus a minor second away from the root tone.</p><p>   It&apos;s just my general frustration with the minor second not being takes seriously as an interval within the context of most non-avant-garde musicians.
