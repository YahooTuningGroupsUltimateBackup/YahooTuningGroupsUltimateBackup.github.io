I came up with this idea last night; I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s been proposed before, and I found nothing in a Web search.</p><p>We&apos;re probably all aware of Golden meantone, which defines the major second as being ~1.618034 times the size of a minor second in scale terms; if the period is 2/1, the generator is 696.214470 cents. But there&apos;s another consonant found as a limit in a number series similar to Fibonacci&apos;s but different, called the Padovan sequence:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padovan_sequence">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padovan_sequence</a><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_number">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_number</a><br/><a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/templarser/padovan.html">http://members.fortunecity.com/templarser/padovan.html</a></p><p>The first numbers in the series are 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, 28, 37, 49, 65, 86, 114, 151, 200. The ratio betwen a member and the previous approaches the plastic number (p), approximately 1.324718.</p><p>I came up with a tetrachord which consists of a major second, then a neutral second 1/p the scale size of the major second, then a minor second 1/p the scale size of the neutral second. The entire series of intervals, each 1/p the size of the previous:</p><p>Perfect fourth: 498.044999 cents<br/>&quot;Major&quot; third: 375.963047<br/>Minor third: 283.806107<br/>Major second: 214.238892<br/>Neutral second: 161.724155<br/>Minor second: 122.081953<br/>Augmented prime (sharp/flat): 92.156939<br/>Third tone: 69.567215<br/>Quarter tone: 52.514737<br/>... etc.</p><p>The &quot;major&quot; third is better thought of as a semi-major third lying in-between 16/13 and 5/4, approximated very well by 41/33. I nicknamed the 0-214-376-498 tetrachord &quot;plastic Rast&quot;.</p><p>For the octave-period linear temperament, the fifths-generator is 706.205294 cents (or 493.794706 if you prefer fourths). The list of equal temperaments with their fifths:</p><p>7/4, 10/6, 12/7, 17/10, 22/13, 29/17, 39/23, 51/30, 68/40, 90/53, 119/70, 158/93, 209/123, 277/163, 367/216, 644/379, 853/502, 1130/665...</p><p>I strongly recommend 209-EDO which has a P4 of 86 steps, a sM3 of 65, a m3 of 49, a M2 of 37, a n2 of 28, a m2 of 21, and so on (see the list of Padovan numbers again).</p><p>I&apos;m going to play around with these for a while; you can do the same.</p><p>~Danny~</p></div><h3><a id=67198 href="#67198">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2006 7:14:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel A.

To start out with, we have a regular<br/>tuning. The generators can be given as 2^s, 2^m and 2^L, so we have a<br/>group of rank 3. To get a temperament, we want approximations. To<br/>start out with, we have the octave and the fifth approximated. If you<br/>also give approximations for 5/4 and 7/4, you have a rank four group<br/>being approximated by a rank three tuning, so now you can analyze it<br/>as a temperament.</p></div>
