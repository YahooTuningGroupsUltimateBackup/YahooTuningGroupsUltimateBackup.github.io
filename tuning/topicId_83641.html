My above JI scale (and yours as well to an extent) seem to point to the idea of at least consonant 7 note per octave chords that are impossible in traditional diatonic JI.

In fact it is &gt;because&lt; (and not in spite of) theory that I&apos;m<br/>&gt; coming to this conclusion.  In addition the whole statement about B and C or<br/>&gt; E and F never being used on the same octave in combination in chords was a<br/>&gt; take off Carl&apos;s saying that to me.

But consonant it isn&apos;t no.<br/>But so many chords aren&apos;t consonant.<br/>I think the only consonant chord is 1/1 5/4 3/2 and it&apos;s way more consonant<br/>offcourse as 1/1 3/1 5/1<br/>I beleive Rameau (still have to finish that book) thinks 1/1 5/4 3/2 is the<br/>only consonant chord too and dissonance starts with the V7 chord 1/1 5/4 3/2<br/>16/9 (though not sure if he agrees on this beeing 16/9 perhaps he thought it<br/>should be 225/128)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Whether less consonant reverse harmonic segments appear in actual music<br/>&gt; nonetheless is irrelevant.&quot;<br/>&gt;   But is it?  Is it really &quot;ok&quot; to just settle for the fact we can never<br/>&gt; use B5 and C5 or E5 and G5 together to make a consonant chord?  You made a<br/>&gt; very relevant statement about reverse harmonic series&apos; sounding considerably<br/>&gt; worse than regular ones...and I was simply giving an example of how reverse<br/>&gt; harmonic series pose a significant obstacle to chord theory (IE they force<br/>&gt; you to avoid certain intervals religiously in making good-sounding chords).<br/>&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t think consonance and good sounding are equal. I think extremely<br/>dissonant chords can be very good sounding if in the right musical context.</p><p>Also don&apos;t think JI is for diatonic music only.<br/>Though chromatic music is even harder to translate in JI than diatonic<br/>music.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;The thread was about the difference in consonance between 1/1 5/4 3/2 and<br/>&gt; for instance 1/1 6/5 3/2.&quot;<br/>&gt;   Right...and you brought up a great point (the terrible sound of a<br/>&gt; reversed harmonic series) and I brought up a possible application of your<br/>&gt; point.  Is that really such a crime?<br/>&gt;</p><p>No crimes commited on this list except perhaps by me yesterday posting too<br/>many messages without thinking :)</p><p>Would be great to have you back in JI land though! :)<br/>I myself am thinking now that the best way to figure out JI is to start with<br/>normal 12tet classical music and try to translate it to JI.<br/>Some music works out perfectly easily, other music gives trouble and this is<br/>where i think the most can be learned by solving the trouble.</p></div><h3><a id=83672 href="#83672">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2009 1:46:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Btw Michael, I think the most consonant 8-notes per octave is 2 &gt;series of 4<br/>&gt; notes connected by pure fifths, one a pure third apart from the other.1/1<br/>&gt; 3/2 9/8 27/16<br/>&gt; 5/4 15/8 45/32 135/128<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can actually play all notes together in very consonant ways, &gt;but not in<br/>&gt; one octave.<br/>&gt; play for instance 1/1 3/2 9/4 27/8 5/1 15/2 45/4 135/8<br/>&gt; nice huh :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here the interval matrix:<br/>&gt;  1/1    : 135/128 9/8   5/4   45/32 3/2   27/16 15/8    2/1<br/>&gt;  135/128: 16/15   32/27 4/3   64/45 8/5   16/9  256/135 2/1<br/>&gt;  9/8    : 10/9    5/4   4/3   3/2   5/3   16/9  15/8    2/1<br/>&gt;  5/4    : 9/8     6/5   27/20 3/2   8/5   27/16 9/5     2/1<br/>&gt;  45/32  : 16/15   6/5   4/3   64/45 3/2   8/5   16/9    2/1<br/>&gt;  3/2    : 9/8     5/4   4/3   45/32 3/2   5/3   15/8    2/1<br/>&gt;  27/16  : 10/9    32/27 5/4   4/3   40/27 5/3   16/9    2/1<br/>&gt;  15/8   : 16/15   9/8   6/5   4/3   3/2   8/5   9/5     2/1<br/>&gt;  2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; you can take it even further to 12 tones like this:<br/>&gt; 1/1 3/2 9/4 27/8 5/1 15/2 45/4 135/8 25/1 75/2 225/4 675/8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or 16 tones:<br/>&gt; 1/1 3/2 9/4 27/8 5/1 15/2 45/4 135/8 25/1 75/2 225/4 675/8 125/1 375/2<br/>&gt; 1125/4 3375/8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nice pattern huh :)<br/>&gt; You can continue this from 1 hertz to above hearing and nowhere do &gt;2 tones<br/>&gt; sound together with a beating ratio of greater than X/8.<br/>&gt; All sound much better than doing these things pythagorean.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s a very nice pattern indeed, very smooth sounding.
