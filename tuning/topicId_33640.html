What all this means is that we may express everything in the 11-limit as a product of the above intervals, to powers which are determined by applying the various &quot;vals&quot; such as h7 or -v5 to the rational number q in question.<br/>Here h7 is the normal 7-et mapping, and v5 is the mapping<br/>(&quot;5-adic valuation&quot; being the technical name of it) which sends 5 to 1 and everything else to 0. Hence a number q in the 11-limit can be expressed as</p><p>q = (9/8)^h7(q) (2187/2048)^(v5(q)-h2(q) (81/80)^(-v5(q))<br/>(64/63)^(-v7(q)) (33/32)^v11(q)</p><p>The first two basis intervals, the major tone and the apotome, together give us the 3-limit, and can be used therefore to notate a<br/>Pythagorean scale. The scale 1-9/8-81/64-4/3-3/2-27/16-243/128<br/>in this manner can be expressed as</p><p>1 [0 0] C<br/>9/8 [1 0] D<br/>81/64 [2 0] E<br/>4/3 [3 -1] F<br/>3/2 [4 -1] G<br/>27/16 [5 -1] A<br/>243/128 [6 -1] B</p><p>By adding floor((2 h7(q)+1)/7) to the second number, we get a system where C-B goes [0 0], [1 0], [2 0], [3 0], [4 0], [5 0], [6 0]. We now may produce a Pythagorean system for the 3-limit; if we have<br/>[U, V] we reduce U modulo 7, and write C-B as the reduction ranges from 0 (C) to 6 (B). We then take floor(U/7)+4, and we have the IPN standard octave number. Finally, V simply gives the number of sharp or flat symbols: positive V gives us so many sharps, and negative V so many flats.</p><p>We now add symbols for 81/80, 64/63 and 33/32, which can be George&apos;s, Manual&apos;s, or whatever we prefer. I modified Manual&apos;s system, since<br/>the backslash symbol \ is a control character, and using 7 for a septimal comma conflicts with the IPN standard notation for octaves, which uses arabic numerals also. I have my notation program at the moment set to use # for sharp, b for flat, + for 81/80 up, - for<br/>81/80 down, &gt; for 64/63 up, &lt; for 64/63 down, and Manual&apos;s ^ for 33/32 up and v for 33/32 down. The Genesis scale of Partch notated in this manner would be:</p><p>1   C4<br/>81/80   C4+<br/>33/32   C4^<br/>21/20   D4b+&lt;<br/>16/15   D4b+<br/>12/11   D4v<br/>11/10   D4b+^<br/>10/9   D4-<br/>9/8   D4<br/>8/7   D4&gt;<br/>7/6   E4b&lt;<br/>32/27   E4b<br/>6/5   E4b+<br/>11/9   E4b^<br/>5/4   E4-<br/>14/11   F4&lt;v<br/>9/7   E4&gt;<br/>21/16   F4&lt;<br/>4/3   F4<br/>27/20   F4+<br/>11/8   F4^<br/>7/5   G4b+&lt;<br/>10/7   F4#-&gt;<br/>16/11   G4v<br/>40/27   G4-<br/>3/2   G4<br/>32/21   G4&gt;<br/>14/9   A4b&lt;<br/>11/7   G4&gt;^<br/>8/5   A4b+<br/>18/11   A4v<br/>5/3   A4-<br/>27/16   A4<br/>12/7   A4&gt;<br/>7/4   B4b&lt;<br/>16/9   B4b<br/>9/5   B4b+<br/>20/11   B4-v<br/>11/6   B4b^<br/>15/8   B4-<br/>40/21   B4-&gt;<br/>64/33   C5v<br/>160/81   C5-</p><p>In order to go from something notated in this way to a rational number as ordinarily expressed, simply reverse the process, and obtain the exponents [a, b, c, d, e] which allow you to calculate</p><p>q = (9/8)^a (2187/2048)^b (81/80)^c (64/63)^d (33/32)^e</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2002 9:53:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; We now add symbols for 81/80, 64/63 and 33/32, which can be George&apos;s, Manual&apos;s, or whatever we prefer.
