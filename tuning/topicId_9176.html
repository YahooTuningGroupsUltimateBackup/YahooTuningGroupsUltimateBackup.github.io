In fact _all_ intervals are different, while this isn&apos;t<br/>guaranteed in Optimal Golomb Rulers. However with the Fibonacci<br/>series a lot of intervals can be very close together, while the<br/>differences in OGRs are evenly spaced. Here&apos;s an example of a<br/>Fibonacci scale, by Brian McLaren, Xenharmonikon 13, 1991.<br/>First 9 Fibonacci terms reduced by 2/1.<br/> 17/16 5/4 21/16 89/64 3/2 13/8 55/32 2/1</p><p>John Link wrote:<br/>&gt; For what _musical reason would one want such a thing?</p><p>Well if there is a musical reason for wanting maximally even scales I<br/>don&apos;t see why there couldn&apos;t be one for wanting maximally uneven<br/>scales. But this raises a philosophical question: what is considered<br/>a musical reason and what not? Clearly choosing a particular scale<br/>influences the music, so there&apos;s a musical reason. I think even if a<br/>composer can legitimise his/her choices in a musical meaningful way,<br/>there is no need for it. History is full of composers who have put<br/>things in their music without apparent musical effect. For example<br/>Bach, who has put numbers like 3, 14, 41, etc. in his music but this<br/>can only be counted and not heard.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2000 1:13:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Manuel Op de Coul:]<br/>&gt;But this raises a philosophical question: what is considered a<br/>musical reason and what not?
