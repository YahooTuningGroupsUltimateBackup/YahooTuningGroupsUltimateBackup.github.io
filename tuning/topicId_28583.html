The &quot;What<br/>key are we in *now*?&quot; question is only sometimes correctly answered by the<br/>key signature, and there&apos;s no good way of implying tonal function without<br/>writing Roman numerals (which are annoying and carry the implication of<br/>Western Art Music anyway). This notation also sucks for serial music. (Is<br/>there anything it&apos;s good for other than the preservation of tradition?)</p><p>&#x9;*For example (all in the key of C):<br/>&#x9;the C and E of a major triad are obviously in 5:4<br/>&#x9;but the E in a Emi7b5 (here as a so-called ii of ii) is 81:64 from C<br/>&#x9;So: Two notes named E two different intonations, two different functions.</p><p>&#x9;Well, I&apos;m rambling a bit, but my question is:</p><p>&quot;Has anybody thought of a new nomenclature and notation for pitch names which<br/>is focused on indication of tonal function rather than &apos;absolute&apos; pitches?&quot;</p><p>&#x9;(2) It seems that triads have a simple kind of number generating thang going<br/>on. The tonic triad can be generated by making use of the first two primes, 3<br/>and 5 against 1, forming 1/1, 3/2 and 5/4. A dominant seventh (I&apos;m assuming<br/>7-limit here, I don&apos;t want to start anything :) ) can just make use of the<br/>next prime up, forming 3/2, 5/4 and 7/4. Seems simple so far. Where do other<br/>types of extensions come from? Say the maj7 chord for example on the tonic<br/>(and because I refer to jazz &apos;common practice&apos; not to Broadway or pop music<br/>symbols, this is not a voicing, but a full chord. It includes 9th and 13th<br/>and possibly a #11th in its set of available voicing notes). Is this a<br/>superimposition of different triads or dom7th sets on top of each other? The<br/>15/8 &quot;maj7th&quot; is an especially interesting note. It is perfectly consonant<br/>with the 3rd and 5th (in relationships 3/2 and 5/4 respectively) but so<br/>dissonant with the root of the chord (and sounds so good).<br/>&#x9;I&apos;m really, in a round-about way asking if anybody understands why jazz<br/>voicings and chords make sense, and what are their ideal tunings. Are there<br/>any interesting treatises on the subject?</p><p>&#x9;Just so you guys and gals know where I&apos;m coming from, perhaps I should<br/>describe my background. I&apos;ve been playing electric and double bass for a few<br/>years now and just recently I&apos;ve taken playing bass on semi-professionally. I<br/>studied Jazz at York University in Toronto for two years and since moving to<br/>Halifax, I&apos;ve started studying music at Dalhousie, which is a much more<br/>&apos;Western Art Music&apos; kind of place. In addition to Jazz, my interests are<br/>mainly in Klezmer and Bluegrass as well as pretty much any kind of good<br/>music.</p><p>- --<br/>- --Ad[dy]<br/>Halifax, NS<br/>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br/>Version: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)<br/>Comment: For info see <a href="http://www.gnupg.org">http://www.gnupg.org</a></p><p>iD8DBQE7sOZqw6hBgsFnYr4RAhhlAJ9T0sy/GBcZyHo/uxyrGKeA22Oe2ACeO59A<br/>cduDW6iOVQpanAK+ikK0Nhc=<br/>=rllS<br/>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----</p></div><h3><a id=28584 href="#28584">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/2001 1:54:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Adam S.

There&apos;s not likely<br/>any musician around who thinks this way in common practice jazz. I&apos;m just<br/>deciding on the function of the Emi7b5 chord and making sure that the E is<br/>correctly chosen for a &quot;two of two&quot; chord.

It seems like both those intervals don&apos;t work out so<br/>well against some of the other intervals in the chord.</p><p>&gt; We&apos;ve discussed on this list in the past how many jazz chords are a<br/>&gt; result of tempered tuning.</p><p>  Can&apos;t there be some sort of polytonal explanation for this? Jazz chords are<br/>all built in stacks of thirds up to the 13th partial (I&apos;m sorry about using<br/>that word, I know it has multiple definitions), sometimes omitting notes<br/>because of the clash (I mean that a G13 chord does not include the 11th in<br/>the voicing, though that note may be used melodically).

But if<br/>the 5/3 sixth is in there, I think the sharp 11th will have a<br/>tendency to come in at a 5:3 above the 5/3, i.e. at 25/18.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; We&apos;ve discussed on this list in the past how many jazz chords are<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; result of tempered tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Can&apos;t there be some sort of polytonal explanation for this?

I believe that the equivalence of 5:4 and 81:64 in<br/>&gt; our tuning system is absolutely fundamental to how Western music,<br/>&gt; since the Renaissance and most definitely in jazz, works. I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; believe one can fruitfully try to make distinctions between the two<br/>&gt; in existing Western repertoire, though of course one is free to start<br/>&gt; from a whole new set of principles (as some West-Coast JI composers<br/>&gt; have) and fruitfully exploit these differences.</p><p>   Because, we already discuss the aforementioned Emi7b5 moving to Dmi in the<br/>key of C and other such things as tonsizations, I&apos;m not sure I understand how<br/>the confounding of these intervals is fundamental to the music we&apos;re<br/>discussing. Just because we&apos;ve played these intervals the same for years<br/>doesn&apos;t nessessarily mean that we are doing things in the most aestheticially<br/>pleasing way.<br/>   Either way, I agree that even talking about these things as separate<br/>requires us to be distanced from the music which has been played/written for<br/>(and conceived in) 12tET. I&apos;m more interested in examining this topic for the<br/>music I am to create, rather than to retroanalyze.<br/>   Maybe I&apos;m missing an essential element here. What is resolution? Do<br/>pitches contradictory to the tonality need to fall or rise by a particular<br/>distance like 16/15 (in C: B-C, Db-C, Ab-G, F-E) for progression to occur? I<br/>mean all of this in a harmonic context; I am deriving these notes from<br/>standard progressions like F to C, G7 to C, Dbaug.6 to C, etc.</p><p>&gt; To understand where I&apos;m coming from, I&apos;d suggest a book like _The<br/>&gt; Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_ by Easley Blackwood.</p><p>  It&apos;s in the Nova Scotia university library network. I&apos;ll get to it.</p><p>&gt; I like 11/8 a lot, but it&apos;s not at all a jazzy sound, since the<br/>&gt; interval from the root is as far from 12-tET as you can get. But if<br/>&gt; the 5/3 sixth is in there, I think the sharp 11th will have a<br/>&gt; tendency to come in at a 5:3 above the 5/3, i.e. at 25/18.</p><p>&gt; Not really . . . the 13th partial only has one definition as far as I<br/>&gt; know. What definitions do you have in mind?</p><p>  Well, I&apos;m referring to the confounding of the difference between<br/>chord/scale partial and harmonic series partial. In Jazz, we usually refer to<br/>chord/scale elements as partials (1s, 3s, 5s and b7 are lower partials; the<br/>major 7th, 9s, 11s, 13s are upper partials). Because these ideas are<br/>sometimes close and use the same types of numbers I don&apos;t think it&apos;s wise to<br/>use the same term for both things (but I did anyway in that case; shame on<br/>me).</p><p>&gt; The stacked triad explanation is fine, but quite different from a<br/>&gt; harmonic-series explanation in terms of partials, and will tend to<br/>&gt; require some tempering if carried past the 9th. Let me ask you this:<br/>&gt; do you have a way of actually tuning up chord of arbitrary intervals<br/>&gt; and listening to them? If so, that will help us immensely in<br/>&gt; communicating about these matters.</p><p>   I have lots of exploring to do, of course. This topic is new to my field<br/>of interest, and there don&apos;t seem to be too many musicians around which know<br/>much about other tunings than the one they think that they are required to<br/>play in. I&apos;ve have met a few interested in the topic and I&apos;m trying to drum<br/>up a little community of interest.<br/>   Currently, I&apos;ve just been using my *very* rudimentary understanding of<br/>CSound to generate sine wave realizations. It&apos;s a really slow way of doing<br/>that kind of thing though. Is there any quick software for Linux that is good<br/>for that sort of thing? I tried Scala once, but it seemed to rely on me<br/>having a MIDI keyboard present to hear examples.</p><p>&gt; Of course not -- you brought up the major seventh chord 1/1 5/4 3/2<br/>&gt; 15/8, which is an excellent example where you have 5 consonant<br/>&gt; intervals and just 1 dissonant interval.</p><p>&gt; Absolutely -- but if the JI realization of a chord has more<br/>&gt; dissonances than the tempered realization of a chord, then why use<br/>&gt; the JI realization at all? The usual assumption is that JI will make<br/>&gt; the chord more consonant -- but in these cases, it won&apos;t (though it&apos;s<br/>&gt; usually possible to find a temperament better than 12-tET).</p><p>   I don&apos;t know if looking for increased intra-chordal consonance is what I<br/>need nessessarily (though it would certainly be a goal in some musical<br/>circumstances). If I&apos;m already comfortable with the pitch set of an altered<br/>dominant chord played simultaneously (in 12tET, I mean), which contains what<br/>amounts to a pile of dissonances (b9, b13, b10) against its core dom7b5<br/>tetrad, then I don&apos;t nessessarily need to keep them all consonant with each<br/>other in some parallel JI pitch universe. I do appreciate your argument,<br/>though; it has caused me to re-consider my goals in this channel of my music<br/>study.</p><p>- --<br/>- --Ad[dy]</p><p>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br/>Version: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)<br/>Comment: For info see <a href="http://www.gnupg.org">http://www.gnupg.org</a></p><p>iD8DBQE7skMMw6hBgsFnYr4RAmOcAJ4tbbfITOC4g4hscpef/m7ugwrYNgCfch5R<br/>6GYBCR6ZxMm4ZZAiXkeCb0M=<br/>=g08T<br/>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----</p></div><h3><a id=28640 href="#28640">ðŸ”—</a>Adam S.
