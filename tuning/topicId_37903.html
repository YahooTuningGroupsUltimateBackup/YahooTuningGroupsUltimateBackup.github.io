Espectially<br/>the 11 identities.</p><p>P says abaout 113EDO:</p><p>Many of these degrees would of course be meaningless except in modulations 7<br/>to fifty 3/2s removed, and if we tossed out the degrees required by distant<br/>modulations we would have left about 43 just ratios, the number of degrees<br/>in the Monophonic fabric.</p><p>Partch then goes on to describe a means of hearing a 2cent &apos;falsity&apos;. In<br/>other words, even a 2 cent drift from Just was considered &apos;false&apos; and so,<br/>dismissed.</p><p>It does seem thought, that P considered 53 as a &apos;halfway house&apos;, whereby a<br/>great many intervals can be rendered closer to just, yet retain the ability<br/>for free modulation.
