The<br/>following was just released by Producer Mike Thorne of The Stereo Society.<br/>Johnny</p><p>&quot;Some of you will have missed our April/May Newsletter.  In anticipation of<br/>our releases, we&rsquo;re changing a lot of what we do, sometimes awkwardly,<br/>including our E mail procedures.  Just in case, you&rsquo;ll find the April note<br/>repeated at the end of this one.</p><p>&quot;Our first release in a while is of Johnny Reinhard&rsquo;s new landmark<br/>realization of Ives&rsquo; Universe Symphony, and is scheduled for July 4th in<br/>honor of the &lsquo;father of American music&rsquo;.  Before him, composers in the<br/>United States were cowed by the European traditions.  Ives, by blowing it<br/>all apart, encouraged a following generation of adventurous music-makers to<br/>experiment and innovate.  His music still sounds radical today.</p><p>&quot;This huge piece, for 74 musicians and lasting 64 minutes, is almost half for<br/>pure percussion (14 players).  This ear candy anticipates explorations by<br/>others much later.</p><p>&quot;We have been quietly adding many Ives-related pages to the site, including<br/>some interesting graphics for download.  For those of you who don&rsquo;t know too<br/>much about the man, start with the three short sections of the Ives Primer,<br/>then wander off elsewhere.  You will find many articles, including two by<br/>Johnny Reinhard, listed our Ives home page.</p><p>To the Ives Primer Part One:<br/><a href="http://www.stereosociety.com/ivesprim1pers.html">http://www.stereosociety.com/ivesprim1pers.html</a><br/>To the Ives Downloads page:<br/><a href="http://www.stereosociety.com/ivesdownloads.html">http://www.stereosociety.com/ivesdownloads.html</a><br/>To Charles Ives&rsquo; home at the Stereo Society:<br/><a href="http://www.stereosociety.com/ives.html">http://www.stereosociety.com/ives.html</a></p><p>&quot;More details of the release in the next newsletter, along with a guide to<br/>the newly revamped site.
