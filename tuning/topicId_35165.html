They used to catalogue and distribute your scores<br/>and parts free of charge and basically manage your output in the name of<br/>promoting Scottish based musicians. That was until some pinhead of an<br/>accountant came along and decided that it would be a good idea to charge<br/>for this service at which point I and no doubt others withdrew our<br/>support.</p><p>Anyway here&apos;s what&apos;s new in Scottish music. A &apos;new&apos; opera (it seems to<br/>be part of the deal that &apos;well known&apos; composers here have to do one -<br/>must be career development.) and a new &apos;string quartet.&apos; Yes, and all in<br/>a well known tuning system. Maybe I&apos;m missing something but haven&apos;t we<br/>heard plenty of these already? Whatever happened to the underground? Is<br/>postmodernism an excuse for conservatism and a windfall for the<br/>corporate music industry? Do I really care? B*gger them all say I. End<br/>of rant!</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div>
