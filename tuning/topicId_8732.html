This was<br/>the response I sent to the author:</p><p>************************************************************************<br/>Hello, Stephen --</p><p>I very much enjoyed this web page,<br/><a href="http://www.oneskull.dircon.co.uk/3.6.04.htm">http://www.oneskull.dircon.co.uk/3.6.04.htm</a>, and I&apos;m sure many people will<br/>find it useful as an introduction. I thought I caught a few errors, though,<br/>and after consulting with early (esp. Pythagorean) tuning expert Margo<br/>Schulter, have a few corrections to suggest:</p><p>Your page says,</p><p>&gt;The earliest is PYTHAGOREAN tuning, which seems to have been in use up to<br/>the end of the 16th century. Almost all the &gt;fourths and fifths are dead in<br/>tune, and the entire comma is &apos;dumped&apos; on one interval (according to Arnaut<br/>de Zwolle between &gt;F and B flat), which is therefore unusable. This tuning<br/>is easy to explain and to execute, but it leaves a lot of the notes of &gt;the<br/>scale in quite odd positions. It is quite satisfactory for music written in<br/>the old &apos;modes&apos; that preceeded the major and &gt;minor scales, provided there<br/>is no modulation whatever.</p><p>Pythagorean tuning gave way to meantone tuning around 1480, and even early<br/>Renaissance music calls for sweet thirds that Pythagorean could not provide.<br/>Except in a few cases:</p><p>Margo wrote,</p><p>&apos;As far as de Zwolle (c. 1440), that should read &quot;between F# and B&quot; (or,</p><p>more strictly, between Gb and B). It&apos;s a reference to the tuning with</p><p>written sharps placed at the flat end, for certain prominent schisma</p><p>thirds, with which we&apos;re both acquainted. . . .[As for] tuning with a Wolf<br/>at F-Bb</p><p>. . . given that Bb is an integral part of the gamut (_musica recta_), such<br/>a tuning</p><p>wouldn&apos;t seem too practical for the general repertory. given that Bb is an</p><p>integral part of the gamut (_musica recta_), such a tuning wouldn&apos;t</p><p>seem too practical for the general repertory.&apos;</p><p>The schisma thirds are actually diminshed fourths in Pythagorean -- in de<br/>Zwolle&apos;s scheme, D-F# (strictly, D-Gb), A-C# (strictly, A-Db), E-G#<br/>(strictly, E-Ab), and B-D# (strictly, B-Eb). These are only a schisma (2<br/>cents) off the perfect 5:4 tuning. Similarly for minor thirds F#-A, C#-E,<br/>and G#-B. So one could almost play music in A major as if it were meantone<br/>using de Zwolle&apos;s Pythagorean, except that one would have to avoid the<br/>B-minor triad, as B-F# is the wolf fifth and B-D is Pythagorean. Similarly,<br/>C#-minor works if one avoids the B-major triad. I know major and minor keys<br/>hadn&apos;t been invented yet, I&apos;m just trying to get the benefits and<br/>limitations of de Zwolle&apos;s system across.</p><p>As for modulation, once you&apos;ve decided to use the schisma thirds, then you<br/>are correct that no modulation is possible -- in fact, one can&apos;t even do<br/>everything one wants to in even _one_ key. But the schisma thirds were not<br/>used before 1420, and the &quot;old &apos;modes&apos;&quot; were simply seven consecutive notes<br/>on the Pythagorean chain. So for hundreds of years through 1420, it would<br/>have been correct to say that the old modes were available with as much<br/>modulational freedom as meantone tuning would subsequently confer on them or<br/>on the major scale.</p><p>Also, the major/minor system dates no earlier than about 1600, so music was<br/>written in the &quot;old &apos;modes&apos;&quot; in the 1500s and yet called for the sweet<br/>thirds of meantone -- Pythagorean would not do. That seems to contradict<br/>your statement above.</p><p>Finally you wrote,</p><p>&gt;EQUAL TEMPERAMENT. This very obvious solution has been known since 350 BC<br/>(!)</p><p>The first correct mathematical description of equal temperament was by<br/>Prince Chu Tsai-y&#xFFFD; in 1596, and shorly thereafter in the West. You must be<br/>referring to Aristoxenus, who may have agreed with the concept of equal<br/>temperament (which is controversial) but certainly did not provide any way<br/>of tuning it.</p><p>I hope this has been of interest to you and that you will consider revising<br/>your web page.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Paul Erlich</p></div>
