Results plotted in graphs<br/>similar to the ones on Paul Erlich&apos;s site:</p><p><a href="http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Erlich/index.htm">http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Erlich/index.htm</a></p><p>Also, here are my responses to several posts related to this same site:</p><p>&gt; [Glen Peterson:]<br/>&gt; &gt;I have also been wondering if I even consider &quot;fourths and fifths&quot; to<br/>&gt; be consonant or dissonant.  They are almost neither.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Paul Erlich:]<br/>&gt; &gt; If a fifth is not consonant, what is?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Dan Stearns]<br/>&gt; &quot;fourths and fifths&quot;  occupy some<br/>&gt; indeterminate zone between (overtly) &apos;sweet&apos; and &apos;sour.&apos;</p><p>Well put.  They somehow sound too plain to my ears to get that feeling of<br/>consonance.  Maybe consonance is the wrong word?  Which brings me to...</p><p>&gt; [Paul Erlich:]<br/>&gt; Roughness, tonalness, and difference tones are the three major<br/>&gt; pyschoacoustical phenomena responsible for the preference for<br/>small-integer<br/>&gt; ratios.</p><p>Have I got this right?</p><p>Roughness = Proximity to a small whole number ratio creates a tension called<br/>roughness.  i.e., 301/200 will be heard as a mistuned 3/2.</p><p>Tonalness = How closely the interval fulfils the ear&apos;s desire for completion<br/>of a harmonic series of tones.</p><p>Difference tones = The difference between two pitches creates another pitch.<br/>Most noticeable in with high frequency pitches played closely together.</p><p>If I&apos;m on the right track, then what does this mean, &quot;For sine waves, simple<br/>integer ratios no longer minimize roughness, but they still maximize<br/>tonalness?&quot;  I would think that, &quot;For sine waves, Tonalness is less of a<br/>factor, because there is no harmonic series in the actual tones.  Roughness<br/>and difference tones still have an effect.&quot;</p><p>What about, &quot;Simple-integer ratios come into the picture because if the<br/>heard tones are to be understood as harmonic overtones of some missing<br/>fundamental or root, they must form a simple-integer ratio with one<br/>another.&quot;  If this is true, why are simple integer ratios so powerful with<br/>sine waves?  Why does Utonality make any sense at all?</p><p>I had a 23 note JI glass organ for a while,</p><p><a href="http://www.organicdesign.org/Glen/Instruments/Glass_Organ/glass_organ.html">http://www.organicdesign.org/Glen/Instruments/Glass_Organ/glass_organ.html</a></p><p>the tone of which had a very profound fundamental, and weak partials in<br/>various patterns.  My experience in playing it was that Otonalities and<br/>Utonalities were equally consonant, except with high notes close together<br/>where difference tones were audibly harmonizing with the Otonalities, and<br/>not with the Utonalities.</p><p>---<br/>Glen Peterson<br/>30 Elm Street North Andover, MA 01845<br/>(978) 975-1527<br/><a href="http://www.OrganicDesign.org/Glen/Instruments">http://www.OrganicDesign.org/Glen/Instruments</a></p></div>
