That is specifically my interest in<br/>exploring pitch more precisely.<br/>So, I am the source. As for what pitch people use here in Japan, it&apos;s<br/>basically like I said, there are the notes which are wanted at around<br/>75cents flat, and there are all the other notes which are being used<br/>generally at 12toneET values. That is the basis.<br/>Then in actuality, it varies from instrument to instrument. With<br/>strings, many players tune their strings poorly, more so than I would<br/>expect in any other country. So a great many people simply play out of<br/>tune. The professionals though, generally play in tune more or less as<br/>I have described. Then there are flutes. On them you have the open<br/>holes, and shaded holes. The 75cent flat notes are produced by shading<br/>holes, and most people play them sharp actually, even as much as<br/>100cents sharp of the western equivalent (making them 125cents sharp!)<br/>Those with good pitch control but ears habituated to western music<br/>sometimes will play at the western pitch, thus 25cents too sharp. By<br/>the way, I am saying 25cents as a rather rough figure. That would be<br/>very acceptable. Some people play some music with these pitches<br/>50cents low instead of 25cents low. Most people consider that too low,<br/>but I like it.<br/>As for the other notes, some are made using finger shading (in which<br/>case they vary depending on the ability of the player), and some of<br/>them are open holed. For the open holed notes, a very good player can<br/>control the pitch to what he desires, which is usually the same as<br/>12toneET as I said. For everyone else, the pitch is just the product<br/>of their way of blowing combined with the instrument. Many instruments<br/>have pitches up to 40cents off, randomly. 10 or 15 cents would be<br/>quite common. The older instruments are more out of tune than the<br/>newer ones.<br/>So, it is a modern trend for the instrument makers to attempt to make<br/>them precisely in tune. Since this is a very difficult job, makers<br/>vary in success at this. Anyway, these makers have mostly never heard<br/>that any tuning exists other than 12toneET. In fact they may never<br/>have heard of 12toneET, just like most people in the west also. But<br/>use it, just like people in the west. Since I am graced with the<br/>knowledge that 12toneET is out of tune, I am now trying to make my<br/>instruments in tune.</p><p>So, in summary, we have all be playing more or less out of tune, for<br/>hundreds of years, and I am trying to find a way to help us play in<br/>tune. In practice it doesn&apos;t matter so much even. But since people<br/>nowadays are getting so fussy about pitch (the people who buy our<br/>instruments), then rather than let that shape everything into<br/>12toneET, I though we should better find a more fitting solution.</p><p>In this search, yes I am asking for people&apos;s personal musings,<br/>solutions, likes. If they make sense to me, and sound good, I might<br/>accept them. So I am very grateful to hear your suggestions and<br/>reasons. This is all about instrument making.</p><p>Thank you<br/>Justin</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Poletti&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The recent posts are very interesting, but one thing is seriously<br/>&gt; lacking: sources!
