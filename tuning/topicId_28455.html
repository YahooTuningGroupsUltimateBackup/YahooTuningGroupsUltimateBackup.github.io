For a long time,<br/>I have had inadequate time to follow the discussions on this list.  Now,<br/>when I try to get back into it, I find it virtually impossible to follow.<br/>The main reason is the one Mr. Austen cited: a typical post seems to consist<br/>of many lines cut and pasted from previous messages, often with many<br/>generations of  &gt;&gt;&gt; and badly wrapped lines, followed by a few lines of new<br/>material.  This posting style, in addition to making the digests<br/>unnecessarily bulky, is very difficult to read.  The notable exception is<br/>Margo Schulter, whose posts are always well considered, well written, and<br/>carefully formatted.  They have a beginning, a middle, and an end, unlike<br/>the &quot;blaterstream&quot; that fills most of the list.</p><p>If you have something worthwhile to say, why not take some time to say it<br/>clearly?  Remember, you&apos;re not just exchanging email with the person whose<br/>post your replying to, you&apos;re writing to a forum with 400+ readers.  It may<br/>be that some of you are saying something significant,  but I&apos;m damned if I<br/>can tell.</p><p>--DBD<br/>==========================================================================<br/>David B.

Always put a clear and specific title ( subject ) for the discussion,<br/>which may be suitable for all expected replies.<br/>2. Always reply to the message with the same subject, so the reader can<br/>organize these messages by his e-mail application ( if he is using one )<br/>then he can follow the discussions.<br/>3. Change the subject when and only when you are opening a new discussion<br/> ( and if replying to a specific message put the whole section from the<br/>message<br/>you are replying to ).</p><p>Since some time I&apos;ve opened a discussion about &quot;MIDI files and tunings&quot;, it<br/>was all about how to make microtonal with MIDI files and MIDI devices, now<br/>it is all about ???</p><p>Rami Vitale</p></div>
