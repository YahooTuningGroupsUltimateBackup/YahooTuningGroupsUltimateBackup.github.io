I meant the diatonic scale of Western musical practice,<br/>&gt; since the advent of 5-limit harmony in the late 15th century. All<br/>&gt; _practical_ tuning systems for this music have tempered out the<br/>&gt; 81:80. There is no difference between 9/8 and 10/9, not only<br/>&gt; physically in these tunings, but also conceptually in the music<br/>&gt; itself, that is, 99% of the common-practice and Renaissance<br/>&gt; repertoire. This point has been made exceptionally well by Daniel<br/>&gt; Wolf here in the past.</p><p>Oh, you meant a *tempered* 5-limit scale!

Or<br/>is the presence of the 5th harmonic or a 5-limit interval in the<br/>scale (while everything else may have been fiddled with) reason<br/>enough to call the whole thing &quot;5-limit&quot;?

He primarily meant, &quot;all<br/>intervals using ratios with odd numbers up to and including 5 are<br/>considered consonant; other ratios are considered dissonant&quot;. Others<br/>after Harry Partch have tended to use &quot;limit&quot; to refer to the highest<br/>_prime_ number in a tuning system, rather than the highest _odd_<br/>number in a consonant chord. But this is a departure from Partch&apos;s<br/>primary usage. When the question is one of verticality, I think the<br/>odd specification makes a lot more sense than the prime one (since<br/>you can approximate _any_ interval with arbitrary accuracy using 5-<br/>prime-limit ratios -- thus the prime limit doesn&apos;t really tell you<br/>anything about the kind of harmonic sounds a composer may wish to<br/>use). Hope that answers your question.</p><p>&gt;(An answer to this, and<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll stop nagging...)</p><p>Please, keep nagging . . . I love it!</p></div>
