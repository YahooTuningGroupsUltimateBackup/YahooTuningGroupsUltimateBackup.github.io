Are you absolutely certain that it can be tuned by the MIDI<br/>Tuning Standard?  Not all synths can be tuned this way with SCALA.</p><p>Providing you have the correct synth selected (I didn&apos;t see the M5)<br/>you should be able to create a MIDI file for your synth simply by<br/>going:</p><p>SEND/FILE filename.mid (name your file, obviously and use a .mid<br/>extension)</p><p>Then you play this file at a very slow tempo (16 beats per measure<br/>for the TX81Z) and the tuning tables will change to reflect the MIDI<br/>tuning data in your .mid file.</p><p>The person to ask is the inventor, Manuel Op de Coul, who is usually<br/>on this list but may be out of town at the moment.</p><p>I can send you his e-mail address if you inquire directly off list.</p><p>Good luck.  SCALA works great with the TX81Z and is a great mind and<br/>ear-opener!</p><p>best,</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=38767 href="#38767">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2002 9:01:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_38740.html#38759">/tuning/topicId_38740.html#38759</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;decuritiba&quot; &lt;decuritiba@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_38740.html#38740">/tuning/topicId_38740.html#38740</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi there, this is Alex, I&apos;ve installed Scala about two weeks ago<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m still having problems sending the Scales to my synthesizer.<br/>Now<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m looking for help on this message groups :)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I got a korg N5, now I don&apos;t know much about how scala sends the<br/>&gt; &gt; scales to the synths, I set the synth to MIDI Standard Tuning and<br/>&gt; &gt; nothing happened.

You<br/>can get one used for as little as $150 and they&apos;re all over the<br/>place, at least here in the US.  I have two of them.</p><p>Of course, it&apos;s hardly a &quot;state of the art&quot; device, but it has some<br/>marvellous bell sounds that, when processed, are truly amazing.</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
