They&apos;re jazzy standards, and to my ear, great stuff!  See if<br/>you don&apos;t agree it&apos;s surprising that separate notes in separate voices<br/>could all be crammed into 15 available midi channels (plus the drum<br/>channel).  I never thought I&apos;d hear these sequences retuned till I had<br/>32 channels available, so this is a VERY pleasant surprise to me!  Some<br/>other sequences, including a nice version of &quot;In the Mood&quot;, did overflow.</p><p>To download, go to <a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/</a>, change into<br/>the JMids directory, and download three files there:</p><p>   <a href="http://nyny.zip">nyny.zip</a> &quot;New York, New York&quot;, three tunings<br/>   <a href="http://sanFran.zip">sanFran.zip</a> &quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&quot;, three tunings<br/>   <a href="http://fly2moon.zip">fly2moon.zip</a> &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;, three tunings</p><p>I&apos;ve included the original 12-tET, 5-limit adaptive, and 7-limit<br/>adaptive.  The adaptive tunings all use fairly rigid vertical springs.<br/>I don&apos;t want to flood everybody with too many versions, but I can make<br/>softer vertical versions if anyone&apos;s interested; this would be more like<br/>the spring set I&apos;m using for piano-only sequences now, with less<br/>horizontal motion than the rigid set has.</p><p>Try the seven; this IS 20th century music!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>David Finnamore &#x3C;daeron@bellsouth.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/2000 1:24:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve just uploaded first examples of adaptive tuning on multi-voice<br/>&gt; sequences.

Your suggestion is very interesting,<br/>something my program is not capable of doing at present but certainly<br/>possible.</p><p>I think maybe I shouldn&apos;t have used the rigid vertical springs I did;<br/>my own ear is so used to &quot;ungrounded piano&quot; that it doesn&apos;t shock me<br/>any more, but I do agree that retuning of horns, winds, and strings is<br/>less jarring than piano (and perhaps vibes as well...)</p><p>I&apos;m going to send you a coupla versions off-list with a more usual<br/>balance of spring coefficients; things are more grounded overall.<br/>Please let me know what you think.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/3/2000 11:09:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John,</p><p>Congratulations on your first multitimbral sequences!  The stiffer<br/>springs sound great, while multiple timbres add a world of life,<br/>regardless of tuning.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
