Hello to the new folks!</p><p>YESSSSS</p><p>This actually sounds very slighty weird and un-barbershop-like because everything is in such precise JI and there&apos;s no vibrato or anything. Even when a really good barbershop quartet is ringing a chord and perfectly locked in, there&apos;s still some kind of modulation, at least on a multiple-second time scale - if not from slight mistuning, then from vibrato.

It was a quick recording relatively speaking. The mechanical type sound is certainly more due to the artifacts of the tuning adjustment than only to the tuning itself.</p><p>In case you missed it, I posted a link a long while back of my whole treatise on barbershop tuning with other audio recordings. And I&apos;ve done a handful of these recordings over the years, just mostly with preexisting arrangements.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;AWolf&quot; &lt;wolftune@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://blog.wolftune.com/2012/08/copyingisfun2.html">http://blog.wolftune.com/2012/08/copyingisfun2.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My new arrangement was done with my awareness of tuning issues.
