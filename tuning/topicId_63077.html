All i&apos;m saying is that it&apos;s silly of you<br/>to imply that B, M, and B were incompetant, which is<br/>clearly the implication i got from what you wrote.</p><p>Anyway,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bill Flavell&quot; &lt;bill_flavell@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And the number one culprit is theological monotheism,<br/>&gt; which is seen in the ridiculous attempt to elevate a<br/>&gt; single theory/model (the harmonic series and the 12-tone<br/>&gt; &quot;technique&quot; being the most obvious examples) into a<br/>&gt; one-dimenional, non-heirarchized panacea-ick strait<br/>&gt; jacket in which to imprison music. All the time trying<br/>&gt; to avoid the hard work and loving contemplation that is<br/>&gt; necessary to try and understand what music actually is<br/>&gt; or possibly might become.</p><p>I&apos;m hoping that you won&apos;t follow in the footsteps of<br/>many other microtonalists and start ranting against<br/>Schoenberg for the role he played in the establishment<br/>of 12-edo monotheism during the 1900s.</p><p>Schoenberg&apos;s own theoretical writings clearly show that<br/>he was interested in the *search* for the &quot;truth&quot;, and<br/>at the points in _Harmonielehre_ where he explains the<br/>derivation of both the major and chromatic scales from<br/>the overtone series, he puts in his disclaimer that<br/>he is using &quot;the possibly incorrect overtone theory&quot;.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
