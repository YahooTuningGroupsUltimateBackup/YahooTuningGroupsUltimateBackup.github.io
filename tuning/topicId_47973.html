I have<br/>been offline for many years now--was here back in the early 90&apos;s when<br/>listserv was at Mills College and processed email throu an old .edu<br/>unix account.  I have been fascinated with alternative music for most<br/>of my conscious life--influenced by Gurdjieff and Rudolf Steiner, to<br/>name a couple.  Was recently layed off my &quot;day job&quot; and have been job<br/>hunting--but this morning sat down and jotted down a few principles<br/>for a New Music--I am curious if there may be others who may share my<br/>sentiments and would like to provoke a little discussion as to what<br/>we can really do about it.  I&apos;m not completely nuts--have been<br/>involved in music as an avocation most of my life--currently a member<br/>of the Reno Philharmonic, a horn player--hence my fascination with<br/>harmonic overtones!!  Hope this is not too long a post but curious if<br/>there is any relevant feedback.  Thanks,</p><p>Bruce</p><p>Principles of a New Music</p><p>1.&#x9;The Fundamental tone upon which a musical scale is based<br/>determines the Nature of the scale producedthe Intervals of a scale<br/>are of secondary importance and reinforce or disintegrate the Nature<br/>of the Fundamental.  These Fundamentals are directly related to<br/>Elements of the Eternal.  Music is experienced in Time but points to<br/>that which is outside of Time.<br/>2.&#x9;The Intervals of a musical scale shall be based upon a<br/>universal phenomenonthat a vibrating body, which is the basis of all<br/>sound production, produces a fundamental tone and harmonic tones<br/>based upon the laws of physics and the nature of the body itself,<br/>which determines the timbre and quality of the sound producedthis<br/>phenomenon is the universality of the principles of the harmonic<br/>overtone series and expresses itself through simple number theory of<br/>mathematics.<br/>3.&#x9;Harmonic overtone theory reflects universal principles of<br/>Relationship between all phenomena, Eternal as well as humanthis<br/>model is to the Sense of hearing as the quest for union with God is<br/>to the Soul.<br/>4.&#x9;Music based on these principles can lead humanity to an<br/>experience of the universalwithin this music we can understand our<br/>place in the Universe.<br/>5.&#x9;There is no reason to continue being constrained by a musical<br/>scale devised centuries ago.  It was a profound development for that<br/>time and has lead the West into the modern age, but must now be let<br/>go and understood as the limiting constraint to the advancement of<br/>the human Spirit that it is.  We should not fall into the trap of<br/>merely seeking another scale, arbitrarily designed by our limited<br/>intellect.<br/>6.&#x9;The quality of the sound environment that we live in has<br/>become so degraded and impure, cluttered by the &quot;noise&quot; of the<br/>machines we have produced, stimulated by the sound environment of<br/>the &quot;even-tempered&quot; scale we have been immersed in for centuries.  It<br/>will be difficult for the human spirit to cut through the quagmire we<br/>have created for ourselves.  Men and Women of Vision must work<br/>together to strike the chord that will awaken, will sympathetically<br/>vibrate to consciousness, the Spirit of Good that lays dormant in<br/>every person.  To this end I dedicate my life.</p><p>Bruce Kanzelmeyer</p></div><h3><a id=47974 href="#47974">🔗</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2003 1:23:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Greetings to all--<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hope some of the old timers of this list are still active.<br/>&gt;I have been offline for many years now--was here back in the early<br/>&gt;90&apos;s when listserv was at Mills College and processed email throu<br/>&gt;an old .edu unix account.</p><p>Welcome back!  I joined in &apos;97, and there are more than a few<br/>here who predate me.</p><p>&gt;currently a member of the Reno Philharmonic, a horn player--hence<br/>&gt;my fascination with harmonic overtones!!</p><p>Always good to have a horn player around.  I played trumpet for<br/>a number of years, and often fooled around on the horn.  It&apos;s a<br/>marvelous instrument.</p><p>&gt;Principles of a New Music<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1.&#x9;The Fundamental tone upon which a musical scale is based<br/>&gt;determines the Nature of the scale producedthe Intervals of a scale<br/>&gt;are of secondary importance and reinforce or disintegrate the Nature<br/>&gt;of the Fundamental.

We should not fall into the trap of<br/>&gt;merely seeking another scale, arbitrarily designed by our limited<br/>&gt;intellect.</p><p>When I came to this list I very much had the view of the piano as<br/>&apos;88 drums&apos;, and I basically wanted a bigger kit.  But at some point,<br/>I&apos;ve become convinced that I want not only a bigger kit, but also<br/>different scales.</p><p>&gt;6.&#x9;The quality of the sound environment that we live in has<br/>&gt;become so degraded and impure, cluttered by the &quot;noise&quot; of the<br/>&gt;machines we have produced,</p><p>Tell me about it.  I enjoyed a weekend away from noise once and it<br/>took a full day to set in but my ears were virtually ringing with<br/>silence.  It seriously lowered my blood pressure.</p><p>&gt;stimulated by the sound environment of the &quot;even-tempered&quot; scale<br/>&gt;we have been immersed in for centuries.</p><p>This is where I differ from many here -- I don&apos;t think we&apos;re<br/>immersed in it.  I think that, outside of piano and guitar music,<br/>most everything sounds much better than 12-tET.  I think we&apos;re<br/>immersed in the diatonic scale and &lt; 11-limit harmony, and those<br/>are the things I&apos;m interested in turning out.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
