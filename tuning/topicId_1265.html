My wife, Jody Diamond, teaches part-time at the local alternative school,<br/>The Runnemede School, where my daughter is in second grade. As a class project<br/>for the 1-2s, since they&apos;re studying Greece, they decided to build monochords.<br/>They&apos;re done, and they even did a little &quot;performance&quot; with them. The kids<br/>build them all by themselves, with some help from a few parents, and they&apos;re a<br/>kind of modified Colvig design, using clothespins as moveable bridges, guitar<br/>tuning pegs, and two measuring strips (one with prime divisions, other with 100<br/>divisions) printed out by an architect parent with access to a CAD machine.<br/>They&apos;re really a success, and now the kids are studying fractions (while<br/>listening to them) and starting to do all sorts of cool stuff. Nice to<br/>indoctrinate them early into experimental intonation I guess!</p><p>lp</p></div><h3>alves@xxxxx.xx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>3/5/1999 10:07:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;They&apos;re really a success, and now the kids are studying fractions (while<br/>&gt;&gt;listening to them) and starting to do all sorts of cool stuff.
