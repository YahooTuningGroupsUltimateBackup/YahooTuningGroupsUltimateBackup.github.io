An excellent post and absolutely not out of context. This is exactly<br/>&gt; the sort of thing we are discussing.</p><p>&gt; Thats a wonderful analogy between drawing a squigly line to represent<br/>&gt; something and actually showing an accurate model of something. I couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; agree more.</p><p>&gt; What would be your thoughts then on taking longer pieces and doing an<br/>&gt; analysis of them. Does it need to be multiple performances of the same work,<br/>&gt; or would it be significant to do longer songs measuring all the way through.</p><p>&gt;        Or perhaps several songs measuring the average accuracy compared to<br/>&gt; the notated score? I dont think it will be possible to get hundreds of<br/>&gt; recordings of the same work if nothng else for practical reasons, but it<br/>&gt; might be possible to get many recordings and scores of different songs that<br/>&gt; fit certain criteria dont ya think? How many works, or minutes, or notes, or<br/>&gt; what have you, do you think would be necessary to analyze in order to come<br/>&gt; out with evidence that is statistically significant?</p><p>&gt; This post was great because it discussed really making models of this sort of<br/>&gt; thing. I would love to discuss this more.</p><p>Easiest thing would be if one has a piece with notes that are notated<br/>to differ by a single cent. Then one could use them as Bernouilli trials<br/>using a simple true / false test - either the one that is supposed to<br/>be higher in pitch is, or is not. Then, if one can find, say, 36 such examples,<br/>and at least 27 have the one that is notated higher played higher, one<br/>can conclude that it is highly statistically significant. If 24 do, then<br/>it is still pretty significant at the 95 % level.</p><p>The more accurately the notes are actually played, the smaller the sample<br/>one will need.</p><p>I&apos;m sure one could also do a more refined analysis using less notes,<br/>but stats isn&apos;t my maths subject area - could ask a statistician for help.</p><p>Bernouilli trials however are simple and an easy technique to apply.</p><p>What I could do sometime is to do a zip of some midi clips for anyone who<br/>wants to to test their own pitch resolution for listening to music.<br/>That way round is particularly easy to do.</p><p>I&apos;d just do a clip of 0 cents followed by n cents, or vice versa, for<br/>all values of n from 1 to n, say.</p><p>Then do 100 random copies of each one, put it in a zip, and leave out<br/>the key that tells you which clip is a copy of which original (but leave<br/>in the original of each clip, so that one can try those first, and try to<br/>train oneself to hear the distinction - that is okay to do, and won&apos;t invalidate<br/>the results). I have a program that does any desired number of random copies<br/>of any clip and at the same time makes a key to them that one can look up later<br/>to find out which is which. (Could also include the program in the zip for<br/>anyone who wants to make more random copies).</p><p>Then another zip with the &quot;solutions&quot;.</p><p>Then to test oneself, try one better than the best resolution one is sure<br/>one can hear, and test as many of the clips as one has time<br/>for, and then find out how many one got right, and then do the easy<br/>calculation to find out the significance of the result:</p><p>if n = number of clips tested, find<br/>s=sqrt(n/4)</p><p>then anything further than 3*s from the mean is highly significant,<br/>and more than 2*s is also very significant at 95 % level.</p><p>Maybe one could do a poll too, and then we could possibly find out<br/>what is the minimum pitch resolution of the Tuning List population<br/>- without actually finding any individual&apos;s pitch resolution.</p><p>I&apos;m curious to know what can be achieved in the way of pitch resolution for<br/>hearing!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Nicely put. But, as you see, after reflection and more<br/>&gt; &gt; experiments, I still think it is within reach of amateurs<br/>&gt; &gt; to learn play beyond what they can actually hear!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Then by doing so, or attempting to do so, maybe their hearing can<br/>&gt; &gt; get refined to finer pitch discrimination too, over a period of time.</p><p>&gt; Great stuff Robert!  My point with wind instruments wasn&apos;t that you couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; play small intervals. Surely this would vary from instrument to instrument<br/>&gt; and player to player. On a side note, Ben Johnston told me a few days ago<br/>&gt; that he stopped giving microtonal fingerings to performers, for wind inst,<br/>&gt; because if his performers used the ones he gave they would always be slightly<br/>&gt; different pitches than his intention, and so he therefore stopped giving<br/>&gt; alternate fingerings and made players find the fingerings on their own. I<br/>&gt; dont know how long hes been doing this.</p><p>Actually that was in reply to Jon Szanto&apos;s post. Yes, that makes sense.</p><p>Perhaps giving a fingering intended for a range of notes may be more<br/>appropriate than a single fingering for each note? E.g. the idea of<br/>giving one fingering intended for about five distinct microtonal notes.</p><p>Kind of turns things a bit on their head. On recorder we are used to having<br/>alternate fingerings of notes. Now, one also has alternate microtonal<br/>notes for fingerings as well!</p><p>&gt; cent on some instruments. Certainly it might be possible on others. I would<br/>&gt; also guess it would be much more difficul to play small microtones on a<br/>&gt; violin than a double bass obviously because the string length is much shorter<br/>&gt; and then requires smaller finger moves. Is it still possible however???, well<br/>&gt; maybe it sure might be....<br/>...</p><p>I&apos;m also interested to know if 1200-tet is possible on the violin. Some<br/>time since I did much in the way of practicing string instrument, but<br/>I have a feeling it might be, by micro adjusting position of finger,<br/>maybe rolling it very slightly or something.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=24806 href="#24806">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2001 4:06:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Easiest thing would be if one has a piece with notes that are notated<br/>&gt; to differ by a single cent.</p><p>I think you should forget that.
