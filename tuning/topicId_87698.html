If the ratio you enter gives a negative result but might be within 13.5784 cents (128/127) of a &apos;good&apos; interval try adding 1 to (or subtracting 1 from) both the numerator and denominator and see if the new ratio can be simplified. Now enter the simplified ratio into the calculator. If the result is positive then the strength of the original ratio is the strength of the simplified ratio multiplied by:<br/>(13.5784 - x)/13.5784 where &apos;x&apos; is how much out of tune (in cents) the simplified ratio is with the original ratio.</p><p>I&apos;ve had to cut a few corners but the end result should serve as a &apos;rough guide&apos; to consonance.</p><p>John.</p></div>
