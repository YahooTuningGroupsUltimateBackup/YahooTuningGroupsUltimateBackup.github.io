I know nothing about<br/>accordions but I wonder whether the reeds are tuned separately but when<br/>they are sounded together the slight acoustic coupling between them is<br/>enough to pull them closer together in pitch. Perhaps the reeds have a very<br/>low Q.</p><p>[Brett Barbaro]<br/>&gt;Thanks! That&apos;s interesting and helpful. I think the answer for &quot;tolerance<br/>of mistuning&quot;<br/>&gt;is not some function that increases and then decreases for higher limit<br/>ratios. I think<br/>&gt;the answer is a very sensitive function of musical context. Manuel&apos;s<br/>perceptions may be<br/>&gt;right in some contexts, field of attraction may be more relevant in other<br/>contexts, but<br/>&gt;typically different intervals will play different roles and not be<br/>strictly comparable<br/>&gt;as if the only difference between them were a numerical one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So, I think I can safely say that for two-voice Renaissance and Baroque<br/>music, where<br/>&gt;thirds and sixths greatly outnumber fifths (and fourths are considered<br/>dissonant),<br/>&gt;something close to 2/7-comma meantone would be optimal. In other<br/>situations, moving<br/>&gt;toward Pythagorean would be more appropriate.</p><p>Well of course. But I thought you were the one who started talking about<br/>optimal diatonics as if such a thing had meaning outside a specific musical<br/>context. And I think it does. There are things one cares about across many<br/>musical styles. But in fact I assumed you were talking about using it for<br/>new music and understood that your only consideration was that all the<br/>conventionally consonant diatonic intervals *sounded* as close to Just as<br/>possible.</p><p>Of course I agree with</p><p>[Manuel Op de Coul]<br/>&gt;One can speak about region of tolerance only in a broad manner because<br/>&gt;many factors play a role like the timbre, register, note duration, etc.</p><p>[Ara Sarkissian]<br/>&gt;... Correct me if i<br/>&gt;don&apos;t understand this right, but your scheme would place more importance in<br/>&gt;tuning the highest &quot;limit&quot; presented in a system, whereas the other<br/>&gt;emphasizes the lowest &quot;limit&quot; represented. That is, if the strict error is<br/>&gt;our measuring stick for the moment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For me, it makes sense to have the higher numbers presented more<br/>&gt;accurately, since i can either sense a fifth or i can&apos;t, the 3:2 being so<br/>&gt;fundamentally engraved/engrained/inbrained in my head. But then again, if<br/>&gt;the most &quot;familiar&quot; intervals (lowest ones) are off, then there&apos;s no hope<br/>&gt;in getting any sense out of a piece of music. So there has to be a balance<br/>&gt;somehow. It seems the attainment of this very balance has been the goal of<br/>&gt;theorists for a while now... So each scheme pulls towards the higher/lower<br/>&gt;&quot;limits&quot; to be approximated. To achieve a balance, perhaps you can somehow<br/>&gt;(and here i show my artist&apos;s badge, not that of a theorist!) merge the two<br/>&gt;? SOMEHOW ? Otherwise it seems we&apos;re just going in circles...<br/>&gt;but it&apos;s a fun circle nonetheless.</p><p>I&apos;m very pleased to have an artist agree with me.</p><p>So Brett (or anyone), what&apos;s actually wrong with using &quot;some [weighting]<br/>function that increases and then decreases for higher limit ratios&quot;. If we<br/>are to have a rule-of-thumb weighting scheme at all, it seems better than<br/>the two conflicting alternatives.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.

I assume<br/>that, for a given dyad (that closely approximates a medium complexity<br/>ratio), it is dominated by the difference in the frequencies with which<br/>each note approximates the dyad&apos;s guide tone (lowest coinciding harmonic,<br/>LCM). For example, for the otonal triad 6:8:11 the same number of cents<br/>mistuning in any dyad (of course these are not possible simultaneously)<br/>will lead to beat rates in the following proportions.<br/> 6:8  6:11 8:11<br/>(2:3)<br/> 24   66   88 =<br/> 12   33   44</p><p>For the corresponding utonal triad 1/11:1/8:1/6 (= 24:33:44) they are<br/> 6:8  6:11 8:11<br/>(2:3)<br/> 132  264  264 =<br/> 1    2    2</p><p>I suppose we could say that since this is the component that is important<br/>for the more complex ratios, where utonal chords are highly dissonant<br/>anyway, we should use the otonal version. But then which inversion should<br/>be considered. If we go to 8:11:12 we get<br/> 8:12 11:12  8:11<br/>(2:3) (6:11)<br/> 24   132    88 =<br/> 12   66     44</p><p>Twice the emphasis on errors in the 6:11. So I guess we only consider the<br/>lowest numbered inversion. But notice that two intervals with the same<br/>odd-limit 6:11 and 8:11 have different beat sensitivities in the 6:8:11<br/>chord. In proportions of 6 to 8.</p><p>Incidentally this relates to the problem of optimally tempering the 6:8:11<br/>into lumma&apos;s scale.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>Brett Barbaro &#x3C;barbaro@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/1999 1:06:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Me, Dave Keenan]<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;So Brett (or anyone), what&apos;s actually wrong with using &quot;some [weighting]<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;function that increases and then decreases for higher limit ratios&quot;.
