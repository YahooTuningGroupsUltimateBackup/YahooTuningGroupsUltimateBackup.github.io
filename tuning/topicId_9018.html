I had not read your message of TD 556.6 since I get the tuning<br/>list email in digest form, and my TD 556.9 post was not in reference to<br/>that. I&apos;m sorry for any misunderstanding that may have resulted from the<br/>relative timing of our respective emails.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p></div>
