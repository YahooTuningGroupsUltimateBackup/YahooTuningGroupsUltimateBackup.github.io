I should be clearer-but forget that it is wrong to<br/>assume that y&apos;all will know what I mean if it&apos;s the first time for you on a<br/>topic.  This goes both for the &quot;microtone&quot; thread and the J.S. Bach tuning<br/>discussion.</p><p>While in grad school at Columbia University I was asked to write 2 papers for<br/>an M.Phil. on the way to a PhD in ethnomusicology (I already had an M.M. in<br/>bassoon).  Each paper was for a class that would then be expanded upon.  They<br/>were &quot;Bach&apos;s Tuning&quot; and &quot;Phenomenology and Its Application to Microtonality.&quot;</p><p>The gist of the Bach paper is that 12TET was foreign to baroque Thuringia,<br/>while Werckmeister was practically a friend of the Bach family.  The &quot;Bach&apos;s<br/>Tuning&quot; article (published in PITCH I:2) is the basis for the &quot;Microtonal<br/>Bach&quot; radio show Mr. Sprague was so kind to mention.  This paper was warmly<br/>approved, however the phenomenology paper was deemed outside the realm of<br/>ethnomusicology.</p><p>It turns out that I took the &quot;wrong&quot; position on phenomenology.  I was<br/>&quot;supposed&quot; to debunk Husserl and the earnest attempts he made at describing<br/>difficult to describe phenomena.  The topic was givien to me by my advisor<br/>for he thought (correctly) that it would help focus and define the area that<br/>was to be my life&apos;s work.</p><p>Phenomenology required meditation and a series of tools to apprehend a<br/>particular phenomenon, in this case &quot;microtonality.&quot;  After 3 years, the most<br/>profound result produced from my good-intentioned project was that there is a<br/>big difference between  &quot;cross-cultural&quot; descriptions and &quot;culturally-based&quot;<br/>descriptions.</p><p>It&apos;s very difficult to be objective about this.  If 12TET is considered<br/>inevitable (as in a destiny) or as a universal (like the English language?)<br/>then it will be hard to imagine12TET as 11-comma meantone, or tempered<br/>Pythagorean, or tempered 5-limit Just Intonation, or evened-out Irregular<br/>temperament, or simply a multiple division of the octave by the number 12.</p><p>From attempting to think and believe &quot;cross-culturally&quot; even 12TET is<br/>microtonal since it is microtonally distinct from any &quot;essence&quot; of<br/>microtonality.  Essences (as opposed to &quot;accidents&quot;) are what makes a<br/>phenomenon a phenomenon.  The overtone series is an essence, in this sense.<br/>By slicing pitch to fit a temperament one is using &quot;microtonal&quot; skills at<br/>100%.</p><p>This lead to &quot;all music can be considered microtonal from a cross-cultural<br/>perspective.  Culturally, it is more limited to notes smaller than the dieses<br/>of the system (namely, the semitone).</p><p>Oh, Egyptian Maqam uses a neutral third: is that not microtonal?  Guess not,<br/>according to Daniel speaking in &quot;old Academese.&quot;</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/1999 5:46:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny<br/>i appreciate the clarification. and i respect yr point of view. I do not get the<br/>list in digest so i just pop in and comment on topics that sound interesting and<br/>try to avoid the more heavy theory oriented stuff because frankly I am more<br/>intersted in JI concerns, which I find a rather simple procedure to apply. It<br/>seems that the conceptualities and phenomenologies is where things get a little<br/>mixed up. So contrary to my original attitude towards commenting and condemning<br/>all other opinions i simply have chosen to pick specific points to chat about and<br/>the search for a new &quot;word&quot; is the portion i found interesting and did not mean to<br/>lessen nor corrupt the discussion you and DWOlf were chatting through.</p><p>blessings and light to all<br/>p.s. I would still love to send you some music someday to maybe be considered for<br/>you&apos;re festival i have heard so much about<br/>Pat</p></div>
