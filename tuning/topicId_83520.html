(logarithmic)<br/>4) (1/PHI)^x + 1 and then taking the results and subtracting them from 2 to get a few extra notes as a &quot;reverse golden section&quot;(Temes formula, which I also use)</p><p>   I have found 3) to be the most dissonant formula, it produces almost exclusively ratios like 1.53 and 1.30 whose harmonics are within 1.015-1.049 (IE roughly the zone of maximum harmonic entropy) relative to higher harmonics in the scale.</p><p>   I have noticed 2), meanwhile, includes virtually every possible PHI-related note combination, both consonant, dissonant, and assonant. It ends up using inversions of PHI ratios (IE inverting the chord 1/PHI, 1, PHI, 2/PHI, PHI^2) to cover the entire 36TET scale with only a few cents error vs. PHI.  So 36TET seems like an ideal basis for PHI scales.  However, there are two major problem: one is that several of the 36 notes have harmonics within a sour 1.015-1.049 interval from either the nearest harmonics of another note in a chord or a tone in the scale on a subsequent octave...so you need to do a lot of searching by ear to find non-dissonant sounding tone combinations.</p><p>   Meanwhile 1), phi^x/2^y can produce any note in any of the scales above with tremendous accuracy, plus more (it&apos;s basically an infinite spiral with an infinite number of tone)...but there&apos;s no way to choose which notes to use except by ear which makes it fairly unrealistic to use (at least if your goal is to use a combination of consonance and assonance in your scales to avoid dissonance).</p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>   4) Seems like the best bet to me by far after trying to compose with all 4 of these methods.  It takes a strategic subset of 2) (36TET) where in just about any combination of its 8 or so tones only one or two possible combinations of tone out of the 8 will be dissonant or fall with the 1.015-1.049 (so it mathematically solves most of the possible dissonance problems and produces either consonance or assonance for a huge majority of note combinations).<br/>&lt;&lt;</p><p>   Another problem (which Chris notes...and effects all PHI-based scales which use PHI exactly or near-exactly in intervals), it that PHI itself sounds a bit dissonant as an interval (so long as you use a harmonic timbre).<br/>   This means you can&apos;t play one phi-tave up from a note without nasty beating (although all the other intervals sound fine as does two PHi-taves up).  I know this from experience because I&apos;ve tried it several times.<br/>  Using 1.625 (13/8...about 7 cents off from PHI) gives virtually the same tone color yet alleviates most of the harsh beating that the root and PHI played at once cause.  So I think it is fair to say it can help alleviate dissonance in most PHI scales without effecting the sound or symmetries in any notice-able way.</p><p>-Michael</p></div>
