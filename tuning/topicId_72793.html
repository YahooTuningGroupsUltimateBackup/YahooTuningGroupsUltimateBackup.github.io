There is no link I<br/>&gt; could find anywhere at all going from the main page. Listening<br/>&gt; should be it, but it has something else.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Listening it is. The link I sent is there, the first link on the page.<br/>Not very conspicuous, that&apos;s true. There sure is potential for<br/>improvement of the navigation and menu structure. There is just no<br/>need to discuss this here - just do it!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is great how you can program a directory A to Z on the same page.<br/>&gt; It is also not obvious how to change the main directory on the left<br/>&gt; with wikispaces, which means that it is restricted to the ones with<br/>&gt; the knowledge ( which I  do not have!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Knowledge is the keypoint, indeed - the help system of wikispaces is<br/>not the clearest one... How to create an automatic table of content is<br/>decribed on <a href="http://www.wikispaces.com/wikitext">http://www.wikispaces.com/wikitext</a> - but you have to sort<br/>of stumble over it...</p><p>As for the navigation bar on the left, there is a link &quot;edit<br/>navigation&quot; on the bottom. After clikcing that, you can edit the<br/>navigation bar as any page.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for having to ask a person for a link, it is polite, but it is<br/>&gt; time consuming when you intend to do do so much stuff. Everyone I<br/>&gt; asked told me of course  share my info which is why I am placing it<br/>&gt; on the internet. I say the same to everyone<br/>&gt; now and save anybody asking me about my page. Is there a way to save<br/>&gt; asking everyone individually?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I would say: asking permission to place a link to a site ist not<br/>necessary - sites are in the web to get attention anyway. Asking<br/>permission to copy content, however, is.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are 3 microtonal festivals in US, one in UK, that I know of,<br/>&gt; which happen on a yearly basis at the least. This is important.  ...<br/>&gt; I think it is important as an option that the reader can click on<br/>&gt; the main menu (ideally A to Z to save time ) on Festivals /<br/>&gt; Organizations or Institutions / Performances / Performers / ... etc<br/>&gt; ... in order to find what he/she  wants quickly and effectively<br/>&gt;</p><p>Sure, good idea. But not need top ask permission here - just do it!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Xenharmonics is a very well cultivated term among microtonalists in<br/>&gt; the same way that the Katakana<br/>&gt; and Hiragana script made japanese language so unique.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; QUESTION TO THE MICROTONAL WIKI COMMUNITY<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If at the moment you want to make things easy for the new<br/>&gt; microtonalists to come, why do you want<br/>&gt; to use a language that is restricted to the microtonal community as<br/>&gt; the tittle of the page and link to page?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not a very useful keyword for the new comers<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Microtonal and microtonality are words that are recognized among<br/>&gt; non-microtonal musicians or music lovers, so why don&apos;t we use them<br/>&gt; if what we want is to promote it and inspire new generations???<br/>&gt;</p><p>Possibly &quot;microtonal&quot; is the better term than &quot;xenharmonic&quot;.</p><p>Personally, however, I do not think that the name does matter that<br/>much. When you go to <a href="http://www.wikispaces.com">www.wikispaces.com</a> and search for &quot;microtonal&quot;,<br/>you get hits to the xenharmonic wiki as well. I am biased, of course,<br/>because I have already put quite some amount of work into the<br/>xenharmonic one... In any case, one point is: of the three microtonal<br/>wikis, the xenharmonic one is has currently the largest amount of<br/>content, so moving that one would be the most work...</p><p>&gt; Hans, Jacob and wiki community, this is my reformed proposal. If you<br/>&gt; want to expand your work together<br/>&gt; for the benefit of the new generations to come and giving the new<br/>&gt; comers the choice of the kind of<br/>&gt; sources they wants to go for, this is how I would extend it (please<br/>&gt; correct me if I am missing the point):<br/>&gt;</p><p>I see only one open point: which wiki it should be.</p><p>As for the rest: It is good ideas you outlined. There is just no need<br/>to propose - again: just do it!<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div>
