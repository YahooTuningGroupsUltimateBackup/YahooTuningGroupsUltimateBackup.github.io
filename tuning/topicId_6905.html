I think you are perfectly safe. I like your stuff, and I<br/>&gt;&gt;hope you will let me post some.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, the problem is you have to give them your email address to listen<br/>&gt;to anything on their site. I guess I could give them an old address I<br/>&gt;haven&apos;t used in years or a completely bogus one and see if that works. I<br/>&gt;just don&apos;t like web sites that set up unnecessary barriers that you have<br/>&gt;to give them personal information to get through.</p><p>Yes, that is bothersome. I have several email addresses through altavista<br/>and netscape that I use when I don&apos;t want to read spam. Horray<br/>for free email!
