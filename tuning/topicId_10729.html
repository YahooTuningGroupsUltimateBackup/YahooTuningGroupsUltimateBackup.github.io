(but &apos;thanks&apos;<br/>nonetheless...)</p><p>The Dictionary has since been expanded vigorously several times,<br/>and restructured so that each definition is a separate page.<br/>This format results in much faster loading, and also allows me<br/>the space to expand each definition as I please; I evision some<br/>of them to be quite long indeed at some future time, most likely<br/>by adding to the definitions links which point to longer essays<br/>on various aspects of the subject.  My objective is to eventually<br/>seamlessly integrate all my webpages with the Dictionary entries.</p><p>In addition, during my recent period of moving and settling I&apos;ve<br/>accumulated quite a backlog of corrections, mainly thanks to<br/>Paul Erlich, and so much of the Dictionary is currently in<br/>another process of revision, with entries being uploaded a<br/>just a few at a time.</p><p>I must also admit guilt myself of leaving this old version on<br/>my own site alongside the newer one.  At some point I&apos;ll get<br/>around to changing that page so that it points to the correct<br/>address; which, BTW, is</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/">www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/</a></p><p>This is the only address which should be considered correct,<br/>unless and until a mirror site is created which matches exactly<br/>the one I maintain.  Offers to do that are welcome if anyone&apos;s<br/>interested.  Perhaps the person who created the above-quoted<br/>site would like to update it and gain my approval.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
