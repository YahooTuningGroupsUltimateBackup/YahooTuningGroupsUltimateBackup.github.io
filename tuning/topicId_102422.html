I really want to hammer this out.</p><p>I&apos;ve been doing this microtonal thing for a long time now, I have tons of experience writing music in lots of different tunings, tons of experience debating the intricacies of various theories and practices, and tons of experience trying to apply different tuning approaches to what I consider contemporary styles of music.  I figure, it&apos;s time to stop meandering from tuning to tuning, throwing tons of money at luthiers to outfit me with a larger and larger variety of incompatible instruments.  It&apos;s time to start really developing a praxis around one specific tuning--become fluent in its notation, get a set of matching instruments, and really stake my claim as a theorist that *this* tuning above all others embodies the direction that I think music should go in.  It needs to be a tuning that I can reasonably expect other people to embrace on a decently large scale.  This means it needs to work in some analogous way to the current meantone/pythagorean/12-TET paradigm, but be different in enough key ways that it can solve some compositional problems that the current paradigm totally fails at, problems which a substantive number of musicians are actually troubled by.</p><p>First, I think we all need to remember that meantone is a theoretical construct that in practice actually manifests as a variety of tuning systems.  It encompasses 12-TET as manifested on the straight frets of a guitar and (perhaps) the fingerings of the brass and woodwinds (which I don&apos;t understand in-depth and are apparently somewhat intonationally-flexible); adaptive Pythagorean- or 5-limit JI with a tempered skeleton, as manifested on free-pitched instruments like voice and strings; interlaced transposed segments of the overtone series, as manifested on horns, and the stretched &quot;equal&quot; tunings of pianos and tuned percussion instruments.  Any tuning system that would hope to succeed meantone would have to work similarly--it would need to be representable in an equal temperament of reasonable size that it could work on a guitar and (probably) a dedicated keyboard, but also not so far off from some JI system that it could not be performed by an ensemble of free-pitch instruments.  It would be best if it even had some direct relationship to the overtone series, such that horn players could follow a similar method of transposing and interlacing harmonic series segments, without sounding too far off from the tempered tunings being played on the other instruments.</p><p>This is actually quite a list of constraints.</p><p>My point of departure is first to look at what problems are actually bothering composers and performers today.  The obvious one is &quot;lack of novelty&quot;--see, for instance:</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krDxhnaKD7Q">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krDxhnaKD7Q</a><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ</a></p><p>Musicians are starting to laugh at the fact that everything is starting to sound the same.  Yay!</p><p>Another problem is that 12-TET can&apos;t really do those wacky &quot;quarter-tones&quot; that are all over these funky &quot;Eastern&quot; scales--quarter-tone frets are cropping on some Ibanez guitars, for instance:</p><p><a href="http://www.ibanez.co.jp/oriental/Features.html">http://www.ibanez.co.jp/oriental/Features.html</a></p><p>And there are guys like Trey Spruance using modified guitars to approximate some Middle Eastern scales:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Chiefs_3">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Chiefs_3</a></p><p>And there&apos;s also the problem that leads an awful lot of people into microtonality, namely the intonational inaccuracy of 12-TET.  There are just too many names to name here, so I won&apos;t even bother.</p><p>The first problem, the problem of novelty, is the easiest to solve, because literally *every* non-12-TET tuning offers *something* new.  Witness the plethora of tunings that have actually been used in music by at least one composer--do we even know definitively how many tunings have been composed in by microtonalists in the last century?</p><p>The second problem, of incorporating Eastern scales, suggests tunings with neutral intervals atop some sort of Pythagorean-esque back-bone.  In the ET corner, we&apos;re looking at 15, 16, 17, maaaaybe 19, 22, 24, 26, 27, 29, 31, 34, and 36.  15 and 16 are the least Pythagorean in structure, having the weakest 3/2&apos;s.  19 can pull off some pseudo-Middle-Eastern sounds with, perhaps, MODMOS&apos;s of Negri or Magic or something, but lacks the neutral 2nds and 3rds of the other tunings.  22 can do the neutral 2nd thing but not the neutral 3rd.  Ditto 29.  26 is pushing the boundary of neutraldom with its wide minor 2nds and narrow major 3rds--maybe not quite there.  34 takes all its neutral intervals from 17.  So, 17, 24, 27, 31, and 36 are probably the best bets for solving this problem.</p><p>The third problem, of intonational inaccuracy, is also closer to solution in all of these--if we leave out the 5th harmonic, both 17 and 24 are quite accurate on the rest of the 13-limit, with 17 having a decent edge.  Among temperaments of the 2.3.7.11.13 subgroup, only 36 is more accurate, and it&apos;s not by much.  27 and 31 are both very good on the full 13-limit, 5th harmonic and all.  We might as well kick 36 and 24 off the list, since 17 does so well on the 2.3.7.11.13 subgroup and is so very much simpler.</p><p>So, we are left with three ETs--17, 27, and 31.  31 is the most accurate but also the largest; questions of feasibility on physical instruments aside, it also poses a large conceptual and pedagogical challenge.  It is an immense leap from 12 to 31, and the new varieties of chords, scales, accidentals, key signatures, etc. are *orders of magnitude* beyond what most musicians are accustomed to.  The learning curve is very steep.  People have been advocating for it for centuries, but it hasn&apos;t caught on, most likely because of this huge increase in complexity over 12-TET.  It is very susceptible to that old chestnut, &quot;why even bother with fixed pitches?  Just go free intonation, if you&apos;re going bother with that many notes.&quot;</p><p>27, at only four fewer notes than 31, is susceptible to similar problems.  It might appeal to some intrepid musicians, most likely virtuousos or those who use isomorphic keyboards, but for those on guitar, brass, tuned percussion, woodwinds, voice, and strings, it is unlikely to be very appealing.</p><p>This leaves 17.  Economical, accurate, and lacking only in the ratios of 5.  The loss of the ratios of 5 is significant, no doubt--but it is compensated for by ratios of 7, 11, and 13.  It even has a half-assed sort of backwards-compatibility via the diatonic scale, which is probably good enough for rock music.  If the whole purpose of adopting a new tuning is to move in a new direction, especially an Eastern-influenced one incorporating higher members of the harmonic series, then loss of full 5-limit backwards-compatibility shouldn&apos;t be a big deal.</p><p>Of course, we should also remember that 17-equal is just a convenience, a point of departure.  In practice, in more organic settings, there is plenty of room for push-and-pull, through adaptive JI that might sneak some ratios of 5 back in, or through a circulating temperament such as that proposed by George Secor that gets more intervals closer to JI.  Or we could take one of the nice rank-2 temperaments supported in 17, like bleu, maqamic/mohaha, huxley, or machine, and do up an optimized 17-note MOS--since 17 is already pretty accurate, it should be close enough to &quot;play nicely&quot; with a more optimal form of itself.  The &quot;17&quot; is just the kernel of the system, much like how 12 is the kernel of our current intonational practices.</p><p>So that&apos;s my case for 17.  I think it&apos;s pretty solid...obviously it&apos;s not the be-all, end-all of tunings, but it&apos;s the one I think is best-suited for large-scale deployment.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2012 12:16:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I like everything you wrote, although I wouldn&apos;t rule out 19 and 22 as<br/>well.

I really want to hammer this out.</p><p>Hi Igs,</p><p>I&apos;m really intrigued by your thoughts here (and also a week later, in msg. #102748), because they&apos;re very similar to ones I had after working with microtonality and alternative tunings for about 12 years.  When I got my Scalatron about a year earlier, I thought that 31-equal was going to be the wave of the future, but I soon realized that it might be too many tones to be conveniently implemented on some instruments, i.e., too cumbersome and/or costly.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve been doing this microtonal thing for a long time now, I have tons of experience writing music in lots of different tunings, tons of experience debating the intricacies of various theories and practices, and tons of experience trying to apply different tuning approaches to what I consider contemporary styles of music.  I figure, it&apos;s time to stop meandering from tuning to tuning, ...  It&apos;s time to start really developing a praxis around one specific tuning--become fluent in its notation, get a set of matching instruments, and really stake my claim as a theorist that *this* tuning above all others embodies the direction that I think music should go in.  It needs to be a tuning that I can reasonably expect other people to embrace on a decently large scale.  This means it needs to work in some analogous way to the current meantone/pythagorean/12-TET paradigm, but be different in enough key ways that it can solve some compositional problems that the current paradigm totally fails at, problems which a substantive number of musicians are actually troubled by.</p><p>I suspect that you wouldn&apos;t be happy with just a single tuning, because I&apos;ll guarantee that you&apos;ll be frustrated by its shortcomings.  Instead, I would recommend that you settle on two or three different tunings that collectively possess all of the properties you&apos;re seeking.  If you work with one for a while and then work with another, I think you&apos;ll find the change refreshing.</p><p>&gt; ...  Any tuning system that would hope to succeed meantone ... would need to be representable in an equal temperament of reasonable size that it could work on a guitar and (probably) a dedicated keyboard, but also not so far off from some JI system that it could not be performed by an ensemble of free-pitch instruments.  ...</p><p>I would say that we should not look for a *successor* to meantone so much as an *alternative* that could compete with it.</p><p>&gt; Musicians are starting to laugh at the fact that everything is starting to sound the same.  Yay!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another problem is that 12-TET can&apos;t really do those wacky &quot;quarter-tones&quot; that are all over these funky &quot;Eastern&quot; scales ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And there&apos;s also the problem that leads an awful lot of people into microtonality, namely the intonational inaccuracy of 12-TET.  ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first problem, the problem of novelty, is the easiest to solve, because literally *every* non-12-TET tuning offers *something* new.  Witness the plethora of tunings that have actually been used in music by at least one composer--do we even know definitively how many tunings have been composed in by microtonalists in the last century?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The second problem, of incorporating Eastern scales, suggests tunings with neutral intervals atop some sort of Pythagorean-esque back-bone.  ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The third problem, of intonational inaccuracy, is also closer to solution in all of these--if we leave out the 5th harmonic, both 17 and 24 are quite accurate on the rest of the 13-limit, with 17 having a decent edge.  Among temperaments of the 2.3.7.11.13 subgroup, only 36 is more accurate, and it&apos;s not by much.  27 and 31 are both very good on the full 13-limit, 5th harmonic and all.  We might as well kick 36 and 24 off the list, since 17 does so well on the 2.3.7.11.13 subgroup and is so very much simpler.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, we are left with three ETs--17, 27, and 31.  31 is the most accurate but also the largest; questions of feasibility on physical instruments aside, it also poses a large conceptual and pedagogical challenge.  ...  People have been advocating for it for centuries, but it hasn&apos;t caught on, most likely because of this huge increase in complexity over 12-TET.  ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 27, at only four fewer notes than 31, is susceptible to similar problems.  It might appeal to some intrepid musicians, most likely virtuousos or those who use isomorphic keyboards, but for those on guitar, brass, tuned percussion, woodwinds, voice, and strings, it is unlikely to be very appealing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This leaves 17.  Economical, accurate, and lacking only in the ratios of 5.  The loss of the ratios of 5 is significant, no doubt--but it is compensated for by ratios of 7, 11, and 13.  It even has a half-assed sort of backwards-compatibility via the diatonic scale, which is probably good enough for rock music.  If the whole purpose of adopting a new tuning is to move in a new direction, especially an Eastern-influenced one incorporating higher members of the harmonic series, then loss of full 5-limit backwards-compatibility shouldn&apos;t be a big deal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, we should also remember that 17-equal is just a convenience, a point of departure.  In practice, in more organic settings, there is plenty of room for push-and-pull, through adaptive JI that might sneak some ratios of 5 back in, or through a circulating temperament such as that proposed by George Secor that gets more intervals closer to JI.</p><p>Bingo!  You&apos;ve just unlocked the door to the solution you&apos;re seeking.  Reasonable-number EDO&apos;s (for my purposes, that would be &lt;24) won&apos;t deliver the intonational accuracy you&apos;re seeking, whereas &gt;5-limit JI with a reasonable number of tones/octave doesn&apos;t offer unlimited (or even generous) ability to transpose.  When I consider the number of 12-tone circulating temperaments that have been devised over the last several centuries, I&apos;m amazed that hardly anyone else other than myself (I know only of Margo Schulter &amp; Joe Monzo) has worked with any sort of non-12 circulating temperament.</p><p>&gt; Or we could take one of the nice rank-2 temperaments supported in 17, like bleu, maqamic/mohaha, huxley, or machine, and do up an optimized 17-note MOS--since 17 is already pretty accurate, it should be close enough to &quot;play nicely&quot; with a more optimal form of itself.  The &quot;17&quot; is just the kernel of the system, much like how 12 is the kernel of our current intonational practices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So that&apos;s my case for 17.  I think it&apos;s pretty solid...obviously it&apos;s not the be-all, end-all of tunings, but it&apos;s the one I think is best-suited for large-scale deployment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs</p><p>I would consider 17 to be the ideal number of tones for a meantone alternative.  However, I&apos;d be looking for alternatives to my 17-WT, because I think the omission of prime 5 is going to be a deal-breaker for some folks.  (BTW, I would insist on having an alternative 17-tone tuning with a full 15-odd limit, with less error than 31-equal, as one of my alternatives, and it would also have to offer free modulation.

Instead, I would recommend that you settle on<br/>&gt; two or three different tunings that collectively possess all of the properties you&apos;re seeking.  &gt; If you work with one for a while and then work with another, I think you&apos;ll find the change &gt; refreshing.</p><p>Oh, of course--I highly doubt I&apos;ll ever be a one-tuning kinda guy, but I would like to settle enough on a flagship tuning (or rather, family of related tunings that could all share a common music theory, despite a host of intonational differences) that I can promote and teach.  I have been pruning my stable of microtonal guitars--31, 22, and 19 are all gone (much to Carl and Gene&apos;s chagrin), as well as 15 and 18, while 13, 16, 17, 20, and 23 remain, with the smallest three holding the strongest gravity for me as an instrumentalist.  But I&apos;ve been doing a lot of work with subgroup temperaments, and might trade out one of these for a different tuning depending on my findings.  In any case, though, 17 is a tough number to beat, both among the ETs and among the unequal temperaments.  Good ETs make good unequal temperaments, after all....</p><p>&gt; I would say that we should not look for a *successor* to meantone so much as an<br/>&gt; *alternative* that could compete with it.</p><p>Yeah, I was using Carl&apos;s words.  I doubt meantone and 12-TET will ever be replaced, and I think the key to finding an alternative is not trying to find a tuning that does what meantone does *AND* does something different, but just focus on doing really well in the areas that meantone does poorly.</p><p>&gt; Bingo!  You&apos;ve just unlocked the door to the solution you&apos;re seeking.  Reasonable-number &gt; EDO&apos;s (for my purposes, that would be &lt;24) won&apos;t deliver the intonational accuracy you&apos;re &gt; seeking, whereas &gt;5-limit JI with a reasonable number of tones/octave doesn&apos;t offer<br/>&gt; unlimited (or even generous) ability to transpose.  When I consider the number of 12-tone &gt; circulating temperaments that have been devised over the last several centuries, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; amazed that hardly anyone else other than myself (I know only of Margo Schulter &amp; Joe<br/>&gt; Monzo) has worked with any sort of non-12 circulating temperament.</p><p>It&apos;s really a very elegant solution, and I anticipate that having a spectrum of 17-note tunings that range from equal-but-inaccurate (allowing for the invocation of a variety of rank-2 temperaments, just like how 12-TET allows the invocation of meantone, diminished, augmented, pajara, 6-EDO, etc.) to optimized rank-2, to circulating well-temperaments that offer a large variety of near-Just harmonies, will make an overall **17-tone** meta-system more broadly appealing.   Rather than focusing on finding a single tuning that tries to fit everyone&apos;s desiderata, it strikes me that finding a meta-system with a spectrum of instantiations that share a common musical logic is a much more sensible approach.</p><p>&gt; I would consider 17 to be the ideal number of tones for a meantone alternative.</p><p>Yay!  I have to say I agree, if for no other reason than my 17-tone guitar is by far the easiest to play.

Sleep well, take care of yourself, make a full recovery, and then blow all our minds with a new 17-tone WT.</p><p>It&apos;s over 30 years old, not a WT, and I&apos;ve posted it here before (probably more than once).  There&apos;s a qualification regarding that &quot;free modulation&quot; (which I should perhaps change to &quot;free transposition&quot;, which may not be quite the same thing) that I don&apos;t think you will fully appreciate until I present some examples (one of which is meantone alternative 1b, below).  It&apos;s important for you to understand how I arrived at the end result, so I need to take it one step at a time.</p><p>Without further ado, here&apos;s the first meantone alternative.  It&apos;s 10 approximately equal tones per octave, but it&apos;s not a temperament (hence the change in subject line from &quot;circulating temperaments&quot; to &quot;circulating tunings&quot;):</p><p>1/1  13/12  7/6  5/4  4/3  45/32  3/2  13/8  7/4  15/8  2/1</p><p>You wrote (msg #102748):<br/>&gt; And here&apos;s why I&apos;m suddenly interested in this: much of the divide in this group (and the community at large) centers around disagreements about the relative importance of concordance vs. simplicity.</p><p>Lo and behold, this first meantone alternative is both very simple (only 10 tones/octave) and very concordant (strictly JI)!  The idea of approximating an EDO with JI (instead of vice-versa) is something I thought of in the 1970&apos;s.  You may remember that I previously posted this link (more than once) to a short story I wrote to describe the rationale behind this approach, with some examples at the end:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/blarney.txt">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/blarney.txt</a></p><p>About the only criticism I can think of is that 10 tones is too simple.  Okay.  I haven&apos;t tackled the problem of approximating 15-EDO with small-number rational tones, but perhaps others reading this would like to go for it.</p><p>In case someone decides to map these tones onto a conventional keyboard and is concerned about having two vacant keys per octave, then you can add 9/8 and 5/3 to the above, which maps nicely to 12:</p><p>1/1  13/12  9/8  7/6  5/4  4/3  45/32  3/2  13/8  5/3  7/4  15/8  2/1</p><p>If you do that, you&apos;ll discover that you have a chain of fifths from 4/3 to 45/32 (F to F#, if C=1/1), with a false fifth between 9/8 and 5/3.  If you temper out the 80:81 comma (which could be done by tempering only 9/8 and 5/3 to make three 1/3-comma fifths, leaving the 10-tone rational tuning intact), you then have a usable diatonic scale in two keys (1/1 and 3/2), which would allow you to play a &quot;limited&quot; (actually rather extensive) amount of (simple) conventional music.</p><p>In summary, with 10 tones (meantone alternative 1a) you have free transposition, and with 12 tones (meantone alternative 1b) you have a multi-purpose tuning (the 10 tones of alternative 1a, the 8 tones in a chain of fifths, and 12 tones providing 13-limit harmony with no 11&apos;s).  I allow the property of free transposition to be a feature of a tuning if a majority subset of the tuning has that property.</p><p>One thing I miss in this tuning is prime 11, but I&apos;ll be sure to include that in meantone alternative 2 -- coming soon!</p><p>Stay tuned!</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2012 7:25:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Without further ado, here&apos;s the first meantone alternative.

But I&apos;m sad to say I&apos;m not sold on the scale as-is, for it suffers the same flaws that drove Western music away from meantone toward increasingly-equal temperaments (namely, the presence of wolves).</p><p>However, 10-ET is not a very accurate tuning in its own right, so finding a JI approximation to it should be more of a challenge than, say, 12-ET, 19-ET, 22-ET, or 17-ET.

I like them a lot, but I&apos;m trying to look at things from the perspective of &quot;compositional problems&quot;--i.e. a meantone alternative should not just do things that meantone can&apos;t, it should do things that a decent proportion of musicians *wish* an intonation *could* do.  Some of my wishes are probably not, strictly speaking, representative of a sizable proportion of musicians!</p><p>Before I go any further, I&apos;d like to summarize what we think those wishes might be.  In our microtonal community different persons have differing requirements for a tonal system, and where there are multiple requirements (e.g., concordance, simplicity, transposability, harmonic limit), the order of importance will differ.  The primary emphasis in our Tunings groups seems to be on transposability, which generally does not adequately address the concerns of those who give concordance and simplicity higher priority.</p><p>You said that you have higher hopes for what I&apos;ve done about finding approximations to 12-ET, 19-ET, 22-ET, or 17-ET, so you should be pleased to know that this is the approach I&apos;ll be taking with my remaining proposals.  Since you have 12-ET and 19-ET in that list, those proposals will support meantone, which may be important to some folks, while others may not care.</p><p>As my goal, I have set the harmonic limit at 15-odd and maximum complexity at 22 tones/octave.  (I also have some options with more complexity that I&apos;ll present, as alternatives to 31-, 41-, and 46-equal.)</p><p>I have also set a goal that concordance within the 15-odd limit in the best (3 or more) keys of the tuning to be comparable to (and preferably better than) 31-equal.  The rationale for wanting at least 3 keys in high concordance is that in JI it requires 8 tones for a single 15-limit otonal ogdoad (i.e., 8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15), at least 5 more tones for a second ogdoad, and at least 5 more for a third ogdoad, which puts us in the ballpark of 18 tones (tempering may reduce this number slightly).  If we don&apos;t have at least as many good keys as in JI, then the effort is probably not justified.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; 1) The objective is to construct a multi-purpose tuning in which different subsets of tones<br/>&gt; &gt; may collectively function differently from one another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah.  That wasn&apos;t quite what I was initially proposing, but it may indeed be a desirable objective.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2) Each of those subsets should consist of more than half of the tones in the tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Care to elaborate on the reasoning behind this?</p><p>If you start with a tuning consisting of a tempered circle of fifths (of n tones, not necessarily equal) and desire a 15-odd harmonic limit, then as long as that circle is 22 tones or less, you&apos;re going to be missing one or more primes.  The missing prime(s) can be supplied by adding more (m) tones to the tuning, but complexity increases as m gets larger.  If you add enough tones, you might be able to achieve free transposition (e.g., if you end up with two circles of fifths), but that comes at the cost of doubling the complexity.  A better strategy is to add the missing prime(s) only for the best keys of the tuning.  One subset of tones will therefore consist of the original circle of tempered fifths (which offers free transposition), while another subset will consist of the tones that are members of one or more otonal ogdoads.  The higher the percentages of tones in each subset, the more successful the result.</p><p>Those extra tones outside the circle will probably not map neatly into modulo m+n, such that the resulting set of tones will probably not be a constant structure.  This is more of a theoretical than a practical problem, since I&apos;ve found that there are ways of mapping such tunings to a (Bosanquet generalized) keyboard or of arranging them conveniently in lateral rows on pitched percussion.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 3) One of those subsets should offer free modulation or transposition, without the<br/>&gt; &gt; requirement that transposed intervals be exactly the same size.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How could we have free modulation if we&apos;re limited to a subset of the tuning?</p><p>Free modulation within a subset is still free modulation, with the caveat that you avoid the tones outside the subset.  Think of it as enjoying a meal in a fine restaurant, where you skip one particular food that&apos;s not to your liking.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Okay, then.  I&apos;ll stick with tunings in which the fifths (or &quot;fifths&quot;) aren&apos;t excessively<br/>&gt; &gt; mistuned (or &quot;mistuned&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That will probably please the greatest number of people.

I have been pruning my stable of microtonal guitars--31, 22, and 19 are all gone (much to Carl and Gene&apos;s chagrin), as well as 15 and 18, while 13, 16, 17, 20, and 23 remain, with the smallest three holding the strongest gravity for me as an instrumentalist.  But I&apos;ve been doing a lot of work with subgroup temperaments, and might trade out one of these for a different tuning depending on my findings.  In any case, though, 17 is a tough number to beat, both among the ETs and among the unequal temperaments.  Good ETs make good unequal temperaments, after all....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would say that we should not look for a *successor* to meantone so much as an<br/>&gt; &gt; *alternative* that could compete with it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, I was using Carl&apos;s words.  I doubt meantone and 12-TET will ever be replaced, and I think the key to finding an alternative is not trying to find a tuning that does what meantone does *AND* does something different, but just focus on doing really well in the areas that meantone does poorly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bingo!  You&apos;ve just unlocked the door to the solution you&apos;re seeking.  Reasonable-number<br/>&gt; &gt; EDO&apos;s (for my purposes, that would be &lt;24) won&apos;t deliver the intonational accuracy you&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; seeking, whereas &gt;5-limit JI with a reasonable number of tones/octave doesn&apos;t offer<br/>&gt; &gt; unlimited (or even generous) ability to transpose.  When I consider the number of 12-tone<br/>&gt; &gt; circulating temperaments that have been devised over the last several centuries, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; amazed that hardly anyone else other than myself (I know only of Margo Schulter &amp; Joe<br/>&gt; &gt; Monzo) has worked with any sort of non-12 circulating temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s really a very elegant solution, and I anticipate that having a spectrum of 17-note tunings that range from equal-but-inaccurate (allowing for the invocation of a variety of rank-2 temperaments, just like how 12-TET allows the invocation of meantone, diminished, augmented, pajara, 6-EDO, etc.) to optimized rank-2, to circulating well-temperaments that offer a large variety of near-Just harmonies, will make an overall **17-tone** meta-system more broadly appealing.   Rather than focusing on finding a single tuning that tries to fit everyone&apos;s desiderata, it strikes me that finding a meta-system with a spectrum of instantiations that share a common musical logic is a much more sensible approach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would consider 17 to be the ideal number of tones for a meantone alternative.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yay!  I have to say I agree, if for no other reason than my 17-tone guitar is by far the easiest to play.  Easier even than 19 was, and oddly easier than 15 and 16<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, I&apos;d be looking for alternatives to my 17-WT, because I think the omission of<br/>&gt; &gt; prime 5 is going to be a deal-breaker for some folks.  (BTW, I would insist on having an<br/>&gt; &gt; alternative 17-tone tuning with a full 15-odd limit, with less error than 31-equal, as one<br/>&gt; &gt; of my alternatives, and it would also have to offer free modulation.  Impossible?  Not if you &gt; think outside the box.  Wait &amp; see!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The full 15-odd-limit, less error than 31, free modulation, and only 17 notes?

To get this in 17 tones, something must be tempered out.  17-ZRT is the offspring of a marriage of my 1/5-comma temperament extraordinaire:<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/scl/Secor1_5TX.scl">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/scl/Secor1_5TX.scl</a><br/>with my 17-tone well-temperament:<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/scl/secor17wt.scl">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/scl/secor17wt.scl</a><br/>such that both 80:81 and 63:64 are tempered out.  There are six (rationally approximated) 1/5-comma fifths in a chain of fifths from C to F# and a (rational) chain of ten fifths averaging around 5 cents wide from Ebb (=C#) to C.  (There is a wide wolf fifth between F# and C#, which I&apos;ll discuss below.)</p><p>Taking C=1/1, in 17-ZRT there are 15-limit otonal ogdoads rooted on F, C, and G.  If you&apos;re willing to cut some slack with the intonation, you also get a complete one on D (7 and 11 suffer most) and a partial one (lacking 13) on Bb (5 suffers most; however, the 6:7:9:11 approximation, with F=6, is excellent!).</p><p>3) less error than 31?</p><p>Taken overall, I&apos;d say that 17-ZRT is competitive with 31-equal.  Some odd harmonics (3, 9, 11, 13) are better, the others (5, 7, 15) not as good.  At any rate, it&apos;s a lot better than 12-equal.</p><p>In 31-equal there are 5 sizes of 3rds: subminor, minor, neutral (or middle), major, and supermajor.  17-ZRT also has all of these (and more!), but there are only 3 sizes (which I&apos;ll refer to, relatively, as small, medium, and large) in any given key.  Here&apos;s the &quot;zany&quot; part: the small thirds approximate 6:7 in 9 keys, 5:6 in 5 keys, and 13:15 in 3 keys; the medium thirds approximate neutral (or middle) 3rds (9:11 or 13:16) in 10 keys, 5:6 in 3 keys, and 4:5 in 4 keys; the large thirds approximate 7:9 in 10 keys, 4:5 in 5 keys, and 10:13 in 2 keys.  As you go around the circle of fifths, the intonation changes drastically.  Observe that the (5-limit) major and minor 3rds (and 6ths) each occur in more than one relative-size-class.  (As you&apos;ll see below, this can be a rather useful property of the tuning.)</p><p>4) free modulation?</p><p>There&apos;s a complete circle of 17 fifths, so you can transpose anything from one key to any other.  However, no two intervals of the same number of degrees of 17 are tuned exactly alike, and some of these intervals sound quite different (e.g., major becomes supermajor, subminor becomes minor, neutral becomes major or minor, etc.).  Note, however, that in conventional harmony, a modulation from a major key to a minor key is still a modulation, even if the sizes of the intervals in the scale change.  Thus, in 17-ZRT it is possible to make the claim that there is free modulation.</p><p>And there are still other features in addition to the four above.</p><p>5) conventional 5-limit harmony?</p><p>Yep, it&apos;s there (as 1/5-comma meantone, which has significantly less error than 12-equal) in 3 major keys (F, C, &amp; G) and 3 minor keys (D, A, &amp; E).</p><p>In the minor keys, you have the option of using dominant 7th chords with either middle 3rds (approximating 4:5) or large 3rds (wider than 7:9).  The large 3rds are quite dissonant relative to 5-limit harmony and resolve very effectively (both melodically and harmonically) to the tonic minor triad (or to a final major triad with picardy 3rd).  I discussed this at some length in my 17-tone well-temperament paper (beginning on p. 73, alias p. 19 in the pdf file):<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/Secor17puzzle.pdf">http://anaphoria.com/Secor17puzzle.pdf</a><br/>A lot of other things in that paper regarding 17-WT will also apply to 17-ZRT; e.g., virtually all of the chord progressions in Figures 5 and 6 will work, so this should be a good tuning for Margo Schulter&apos;s neo-Medieval music.</p><p>I mentioned above that there&apos;s a wide wolf 5th between F# and C# in the circle of 17 fifths.  If you omit the tones in the circle from C# to E# (note: E#=Gb, also E#=F^), you&apos;ll get a circle of 12 fifths with a narrow wolf 5th between F# and Db (Db=C^).  You&apos;ll get an E-major scale if you use Db, Ab, and Eb as the 3rds of A, E, and B, respectively, but there will be a false 5th between F# and Db (the narrow wolf in the 12-circle), as occurs in the supertonic triad in strict JI.  Also note that in the 12-circle all of the neutral 3rds and 6ths are gone.</p><p>I attempted to eliminate the wide wolf 5th in the 17-circle by distributing the error among several consecutive 5ths, but I was not happy with the result.  The prime 13 tones were too low in pitch, with the 8:13 approximations sounding more like minor 6ths than neutral 6ths; also, the 3rd of the D-major triad was a full pythagorean comma wide, and I still ended up with a couple of 5ths about 16 cents wide, which is not too good.  I decided that it would be better to keep the two wolf fifths (the wide one in the 17-circle and the narrow now in 12, each with F# as the root), inasmuch as either of these could be used for a shock effect.  With proper marketing, a defect can be turned into a feature!</p><p>6) incorporating Eastern scales?</p><p>Yep!  There are plenty of neutral (or middle) intervals in 17-ZRT.  All of the middle 3rds on Bb, F, C, G, and D are neutral 3rds, and the small 3rds on Bb, F, C, and G are all subminor 3rds, so there will be an ample number of 6:7:9:11 tetrads that can be used for non-12 harmony.  (That&apos;s just in the &quot;common&quot; keys.  You can also go to the far side of the 17-circle, where there are no major or minor 3rds.)</p><p>So that&apos;s my Meantone Alternative #1.  (In case this one doesn&apos;t get rave reviews, I have some other alternatives in the pipeline.)</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2012 12:19:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; After working on a couple of new ideas for the past several weeks, here&apos;s the new tuning that I completed last Friday.

Such scales would probably be Rothenberg improper, and 5/4 would be represented inconsistently as sometimes 6 steps and sometimes 5 steps (similarly 6/5 would be sometimes 5 steps and sometimes 4 steps).</p><p>III) Temperaments with a circle of fifths, one side of which is like schismatic (using the 17p val), and the other side superpyth. These temperaments would consistently represent both 5/4 and 6/5 as 5 steps, leading to the interesting phenomenon that as you modulated through different keys, the thirds would gradually change from major to neutral to minor, and then back again. Supermajor and subminor thirds would always be available as 6-step and 4-step intervals respectively.</p><p>IV) Temperaments with a circle of neutral thirds, one side of which has flat fifths and tempers out 81/80 (like &quot;mohaha&quot; temperament), and the other side of which has sharp fifths and more resembles &quot;beatles&quot; temperament. In these temperaments 5/4 and 6/5 would consistently be represented as 6 steps and 4 steps respectively (i.e. the 17c val).</p><p>I wrote these category descriptions before really looking at your temperament&apos;s interval inventory in detail, and it appears that it falls squarely into category II (despite the wolf fifth making it not-really-circulating, or circulating only in a loose sense, if you prefer). Your widest 5-step interval is 912/725, or 397.263 cents, and your narrowest 6-step interval is 203/162, or 390.583 cents.

The wolf fifth is a deal-breaker for me. I wouldn&apos;t even call this a circulating temperament because of it.</p><p>F#-C# is almost exactly 13:20, which is pretty dissonant by itself.  But if you add another tone a small (A) or medium-sized 3rd (A^) above the F#, the resulting triads actually sound halfway decent.  (But adding the large 3rd, A#, 461 cents, retains the tension!)  Given that there&apos;s so much variation in the sizes of the 3rds, I don&apos;t think it inappropriate to have a wolf 5th in the mix.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;ll go back to the drawing board and see if I can come up with an 11-limit circulating temperament of 17 fifths.</p><p>&gt; 2. I thought we were talking about meantone alternatives, but the part of this temperament that has good 5-limit harmony is meantone-based.</p><p>A portion of it would have to be meantone-based in order to have the A function as both prime 5 of root F and odd 9 of root G.  But that doesn&apos;t disqualify it from being a meantone alternative, if only for the fact that the meantone feature is restricted to only a few keys.  I think that lack of at least some meantone capability and/or prime 5 would be a deal-breaker for some folks.</p><p>&gt; 17-tone circulating temperaments are very attractive, and I can see room for at least four different categories of them:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I) Temperaments that don&apos;t even attempt to approximate the prime 5 at all. These would be much closer to 17edo than the other alternatives, because 17edo is such a good no-5s temperament to begin with.</p><p>But of course!  I designed something I call a 17-tone well-temperament way back in 1978:<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/scl/secor17wt.scl">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/scl/secor17wt.scl</a><br/>It&apos;s fully explained in this paper:<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/Secor17puzzle.pdf">http://anaphoria.com/Secor17puzzle.pdf</a></p><p>One way to get prime 5 is to add another 17-WT circle of fifths 600 cents apart from the first one.  That gets you a 17-limit tuning that&apos;s near-optimal for pajara (with optional expanded harmonic limit) in 10 different keys:<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/scl/secor34wt.scl">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/scl/secor34wt.scl</a></p><p>However, 34 tones is considerably more than Igs wanted for a meantone alternative.  But, as an alternative to 31-equal, it&apos;s a viable option, and since it&apos;s 17-limit, it&apos;s also a nice alternative to 46-equal (Mike B. take note!).</p><p>While I&apos;m on the subject of circulating alternatives in the 30-tone neighborhood, here&apos;s a 29-tone &quot;HTT&quot; 15-odd-limit circulating temperament (no wolf fifths!) that has error so low (in 6 different keys) that it sounds like JI:<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/scl/secor29htt.scl">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/scl/secor29htt.scl</a><br/>And to drive home the point, here&apos;s a recording of a live performance from 1975 using this tuning on a generalized-keyboard Scalatron:<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/improv29.mp3">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/improv29.mp3</a><br/>If you&apos;re trying it out with Scala&apos;s chromatic clavier, enter the command &quot;set nota sahtt&quot;.</p><p>I also have a 17-tone (non-circulating) version of this &quot;HTT&quot; tuning (15-odd-limit in 3 different keys), in case anyone is interested.</p><p>&gt; II) Temperaments with a circle of fifths, one side of which is like meantone (using the 17c val), and the other side of which therefore has much wider fifths, like superpyth (using the 17p val). Such scales would probably be Rothenberg improper, and 5/4 would be represented inconsistently as sometimes 6 steps and sometimes 5 steps (similarly 6/5 would be sometimes 5 steps and sometimes 4 steps).</p><p>My response is below.</p><p>&gt; III) Temperaments with a circle of fifths, one side of which is like schismatic (using the 17p val), and the other side superpyth. These temperaments would consistently represent both 5/4 and 6/5 as 5 steps, leading to the interesting phenomenon that as you modulated through different keys, the thirds would gradually change from major to neutral to minor, and then back again. Supermajor and subminor thirds would always be available as 6-step and 4-step intervals respectively.</p><p>Okay, this is worth looking into.  I&apos;ll check it out.</p><p>&gt; IV) Temperaments with a circle of neutral thirds, one side of which has flat fifths and tempers out 81/80 (like &quot;mohaha&quot; temperament), and the other side of which has sharp fifths and more resembles &quot;beatles&quot; temperament. In these temperaments 5/4 and 6/5 would consistently be represented as 6 steps and 4 steps respectively (i.e. the 17c val).</p><p>That&apos;s also worth a try.</p><p>&gt; I wrote these category descriptions before really looking at your temperament&apos;s interval inventory in detail, and it appears that it falls squarely into category II (despite the wolf fifth making it not-really-circulating, or circulating only in a loose sense, if you prefer).</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s part of the zaniness (as is the not-really-circulating circle of 12 fifths without neutral 3rds).</p><p>&gt; Your widest 5-step interval is 912/725, or 397.263 cents, and your narrowest 6-step interval is 203/162, or 390.583 cents. This means it&apos;s Rothenberg improper and has an inconsistent mapping of 5/4 as sometimes 5 steps and sometimes 6 steps, as I suspect all good meantone/superpyth combinations will.</p><p>Yes, another zany &quot;feature&quot; that drives the theorist up the wall, but which could be very useful to a composer.  The ability to do one or two special things in a given key that can&apos;t be done in most of the other keys can make this a very versatile tuning, full of surprises.</p><p>I was interested in some feedback about whether I was successfully representing all of the 15-odd-limit intervals, particularly in the 3 main keys (F, C, G), but also elsewhere.  Looking at the numbers to check the amount of error is one thing, but a listening test may tell a different story.  For example, plus-error is more tolerable for major 3rds and harmonic 7ths than minus-error.</p><p>--George</p></div>
