The basic<br/>element of the Progression of Musical Cells is note Do = 1 followed by<br/>the schisma which is cell number 1 of the 612 elements of the<br/>progression that ends on 2Do = 2.<br/>The interesting progression feature is that 37 tone frequencies of the<br/>Pythagoras and Aristoxenus extended scales emerged together with all<br/>the Piagui scale tone frequencies and the K and P semitone factors.<br/>It is remarkable that the perfect fifths and fourths of any cell that<br/>is obtained by multiplying the cell frequency by 1.5 or 1.33333....<br/>reproduces other cell frequency values with exactness.<br/>The set is expanded cyclically each (9/8)(1/2) = 1.0606601717...<br/>The schisma M and the other two commas (J and U) work cyclically to<br/>determine a theoretical infinite number of octaves.<br/>The schisma M seems to be a natural constant that perfects harmony.</p></div>
