He<br/>also spoke of the error in this &quot;wolf&quot; as being by a &quot;diaschisma&quot;,<br/>which is defined later as about &quot;half a minor semitone&quot; or<br/>about 36 cents if the minor semitone is taken as the step<br/>between notes at a 6/5 minor third and a 5/4 major third above<br/>a fixed lower note (cent value for ratio 25/24 is app. 72 cents).<br/>This is approximately the error in the wolf fifth of quarter<br/>comma mean tone temperament.  Elsewhere in the encyclopedia,<br/>the author states that on the piano, the major thirds in the<br/>keys of, I believe, D, A, and E are tuned sharper than the<br/>major thirds in the flat keys are tuned, suggesting a well<br/>temperament being used for the piano.  The encyclopedia was<br/>published in an almost unchanged 2nd edition in 1880 with<br/>an identical entry for &quot;Bearing Notes&quot;.</p><p>In a piano tuning manual by Cree published in 1907, the author<br/>stated that it was only within the previous 50 years that EQT&apos;s<br/>acceptance had become universal and that even at that time (1907)<br/>some tuners tuned to favor the flat keys - i.e. reduce the<br/>sharpness of the major thirds in those keys - because most<br/>popular music was written in the flat keys and many of the<br/>people who owned pianos played little but popular music.</p><p>As recently as 1911, Arnold Schoenberg, in the first edition of<br/>his Harmonielehre (Treatise on Harmony), wrote of 12-EQT as<br/>representing only a temporary truce in music required by the<br/>limitations of musical instruments of that time, predicting<br/>that ultimately music based on the overtones would inevitably<br/>prevail (because of its basis in nature).  He removed passages<br/>in which he expressed these opinions from his second edition<br/>of Harmonielehre published in 1920.</p><p>In the first edition of Groves Dictionary of Music and Musicians<br/>published in England in 1895, the author of the artical on<br/>temperament PROPOSES the reintroduction<br/>of mean tone and just intonation, at least for occasional use to<br/>&quot;relieve the monotony of equal temperament&quot;, which suggests that<br/>by 1895 equal temperament had become well established in England.<br/>He does mention, I just remembered, that reminders of the earlier<br/>mean tone system could be found - some country churches where the<br/>organs were still in mean tone temperament, etc.</p><p>Also, in his translation of Helmholtz &quot;On the Sensations of Tone&quot;<br/>published in 1885, Ellis speaks of having visited Spain in 1880<br/>and found that most of the organs there were in mean tone<br/>temperament.</p><p>I have gotten an impression that up until between about 1910 and<br/>1920, there was an appreciable school of thought among musicians<br/>and music theorists that just intonation was essentially the<br/>real musical tuning and that equal temperament was an approximation<br/>to just intonation.  Then, at some point, more musicians and<br/>musical theorists began to view tuning as something almost<br/>arbitrary, so that if a convention such as 12-EQT were adopted<br/>and people were trained to that system, it would be equal as<br/>a standard for musical tuning to just intonation and, since<br/>musicians were training to 12-EQT rather than just intonation,<br/>12-EQT was in fact the true tuning and not just intonation.</p><p>Even though this latter attitude seems to be widespread among<br/>more traditional music theorists at present, I believe it is<br/>incorrect, because the psychological impact of chords and also<br/>musical steps (in my opinion) changes appreciably with tuning<br/>changes of as little as a few cents, so that although a person<br/>might, by training, feel that 12-EQT was the correct tuning and<br/>that, say, just intonation was out-of-tune, that person would<br/>definitely hear a difference between the sounds of chords, steps,<br/>and music in 12-EQT and just intonation.  Because of the &quot;hard<br/>wiring&quot; of that person&apos;s brain, there would be, in addition to<br/>the feelings of correctness or incorrectness brought about<br/>by the sounds of the chords, an emotional impact which would<br/>be independent of the judgments aroused through training<br/>resulting from the specific impacts of the whole sounds in<br/>all their complexity, a significant part of which would be<br/>related to the pitch relationships between the notes sounding -<br/>their frequency ratios, how close these were to integer<br/>ratios, etc.</p><p>In the 1895 Groves Dictionary, the author states that the<br/>adoption of 12-EQT was a good thing, &quot;at least for trade&quot;.<br/>I have the feeling that commercial interests of the later<br/>19th century and early 20th century and later played a role larger<br/>than appreciated in convincing the musical establishment<br/>and the general public that 12-EQT was optimal as the<br/>tuning for all music (at least instrumental music) and<br/>that using just intonation or mean tone temperament wouldn&apos;t<br/>really bring any benefit or be advisable at all.  As those<br/>who had extensive familiarity with mean tone temperament<br/>music and just intonation music (string quartets at one<br/>time if a writer in 1877 is to be believed) died off, it<br/>became increasingly easy to induce musicians and the<br/>general public to believe in 12-EQT as the best possible<br/>tuning for music without anyone raising any objections<br/>to this.</p><p>Dave Hill, Borrego Springs, CA</p></div><h3><a id=17420 href="#17420">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
