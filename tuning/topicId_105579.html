I use to play around with Parncutt&apos;s subharmonic matching routine from his 1987 paper, but I don&apos;t have my notes with me.  You mean, why is it 5, instead of 4?  Me too, I&apos;m not sure his approach is valid, given the mutliple &apos;weighted&apos; candidate roots it gives.  I think a gestalt process is simpler:  if you have a patter of 3rds (5-6-9), then it&apos;s natural to extend the pattern down, or up, to the other 3rds.  There&apos;s such a fixation on the harmonic series pattern in studying chord perception...but the harmonic series itself is equally spaced before it reaches our ear.  It&apos;s harmonicity is a partly a product of our logarithmic middle ear...a fun topic to ruminate over</p><p>-Kelly</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Dec 18, 2012, at 11:48 PM, kellyjohnson5001 &lt;kellyjohnson5001@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; regarding the root of the chord, I&quot;m sure you&apos;re all familiar with Richard<br/>&gt; Parncutt&apos;s 1987 paper &quot;the root of a chord&quot;?
