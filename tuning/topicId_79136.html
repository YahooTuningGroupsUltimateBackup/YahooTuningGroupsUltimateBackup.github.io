The only thing overly technical about standard tracking interfaces I can think of is learning the hexadecimal commands.<br/>   If you know what you are doing with a tracker you can easily get 96th-note timing accuracy.  If you use alternative tempo parameters in addition to this, you can get over 256th note accuracy.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The sad thing is most people just take the default drum-machine-like pattern setting (1/16th note timing) and say &quot;1/16th notes are too robotic...therefore tracking is robotic&quot; and don&apos;t bother to learn the advanced timing/speed settings.&lt;&lt;&lt;  Try speed setting 1 for 1/96th note timing.<br/>   Or if you need even more timing accuracy just double or even quadruple the tempo for up to 384th note accuracy (tempo range is 0 to 512 on many trackers).</p><p>   If you need more or feel an overwhelming urge to &quot;humanize&quot; your tracks or lots of automated arpeggio or automated &quot;after-touch&quot; settings...you need to go to MIDI.  But if you are willing to automate very little trackers are just as powerful in most ways.</p><p>   But, for example, look at the tracker Re-Noise: countless ambient and neo-classical tracks have been composed with that.  When you think about it, software such as Reason and Fruity Loops is often the same way: they like to have you make drum-machine style timing by default, but can be coaxed into doing just about anything if you know how to use them.</p><p>-Michael</p><p>******************************************************************</p><p>--- On Mon, 11/10/08, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: Microtonal tracker software?<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Date: Monday, November 10, 2008, 4:49 PM<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael Sheiman<br/>&gt; &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ----Open mpt has native microtonal support<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;       It does...and I use it a lot...plus it is<br/>&gt; also open-source and<br/>&gt; supports VST and Direct-X plug-ins.
