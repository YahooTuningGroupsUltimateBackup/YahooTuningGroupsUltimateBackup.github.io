If the octave is a generator,<br/>&gt; the other generator will be a sharp 27/25 of size about 3^(1/13); if<br/>&gt; we want to use 3 as an equivalence instead, we get a period of<br/>&gt; 3^(1/13) as a generator, and can use the octave as the other<br/>&gt; generator, hence we get the same generators looked at two different<br/>&gt; ways. If we get rid of 2 altogether, we don&apos;t have a linear<br/>&gt; temperament, but an equal temperament, obtained by dividing 3 into 13<br/>&gt; equal parts.</p><p>1. could you enlighten me a bit more about &quot;bohpier&quot;? I&apos;m not sure if I got<br/>the idea.</p><p>2. I&apos;m not sure about where you got octaves. As far as I could find out,<br/>none of the commas which can be tempered out come from 2/1.</p><p>3. Actually, I managed to find three possible generators usable for the<br/>linear tempering of BP (leaving the period at 3/1, of course). First (and I<br/>think this is the most &quot;powerful&quot; version), to temper out 245/243, the<br/>optimum generator is &quot;(15/7)^(1/3)&quot; which flattens both 7/3 and 5/3 by 1/3<br/>of that, allowing a pure 7/5. Then, to temper out 3125/3087, the optimum<br/>generator is &quot;(7/3)^(1/5)&quot; which sharpens the 7/5 and flattens the 5/3 by<br/>1/5 of that, allowing a pure 7/3. And finally, to temper out 16875/16807,<br/>the optimum generator is &quot;(27/5)^(1/5)&quot; which makes both 7/3 and 7/5 sharper<br/>by 1/5 of that, allowing a pure 5/3. -- Interestingly, if you choose any of<br/>these as a generator (and 3/1 as a period), the resulting scales look all<br/>very similar if you stack 12 of them (i.e. make a 13-tone scale). Even<br/>better, they all meet the condition of &quot;two intervals per class&quot;. They only<br/>differ in the numbers of large and small intervals.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
