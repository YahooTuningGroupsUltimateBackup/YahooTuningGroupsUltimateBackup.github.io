Our first goal here<br/>will be a linear stretch which will leave the symmetry of the scale<br/>intact.</p><p>Nine Tone, 5 Limit, Inversionally Symmetrical JI Scale<br/>Ratio       Cents           Consecutive<br/>1/1         0.000           0<br/>9/8         203.910         203.910<br/>6/5         315.641         111.731<br/>5/4         386.314         70.672<br/>4/3         498.045         111.731<br/>3/2         701.955         203.910<br/>8/5         813.686         111.731<br/>5/3         884.359         70.672<br/>16/9        996.090         111.731<br/>2/1         1200.000        203.910</p><p>Let&apos;s stretch the above familiar JI scale by .428 cents, to slightly<br/>augment each degree proportionally. We can do this by creating a<br/>stretch table, where we simply multiply .428 cents by numbers 1-9,<br/>then add these values to each successive scale degree. The table<br/>looks like this:</p><p>              Cents<br/>1.000         0.428<br/>2.000         0.856<br/>3.000         1.284<br/>4.000         1.712<br/>5.000         2.14<br/>6.000         2.568<br/>7.000         2.996<br/>8.000         3.424<br/>9.000         3.852</p><p>So we&apos;ll add these values to our 5 Limit scale to obtain:</p><p>Cents              Consecutive<br/>0<br/>204.338            204.338<br/>316.497            112.159<br/>387.598            71.100<br/>499.757            112.159<br/>704.095            204.338<br/>816.254            112.159<br/>887.355            71.100<br/>999.514            112.159<br/>1203.852           204.338</p><p>One can see that the stretched scale maintains its original symmetry,<br/>and remains with 3 step sizes, but is wider by 3.852 cents at the<br/>2/1. This is a nice scale too, and I invite folks to try it out to<br/>let me know what you think. Hopefully my JI friends out there won&apos;t<br/>banish me to the wastelands for the blasphemy of stretching our<br/>beloved 5 Limit JI. I think you may be surprised at how nice it<br/>sounds though. My interest here parallels my love of Gamelan, and<br/>these are attempts to transform a tuning to include subtle beating,<br/>like that found in a Gamelan scale.</p><p>Now for fun, let&apos;s look at a more severe stretch, using the same<br/>method, but this time with a 1.67 cents stretch:</p><p>Cents              Consecutive<br/>0<br/>205.580            205.580<br/>318.981            113.401<br/>391.324            72.342<br/>504.725            113.401<br/>710.305            205.580<br/>823.706            113.401<br/>896.049            72.342<br/>1009.450           113.401<br/>1215.030           205.580</p><p>Here we&apos;ve stretched the octave by 15.030 cents, and have more<br/>radically altered the original scale.</p><p>Next installment: Applying a &quot;Curved Stretch&quot; to a scale.</p><p>Thanks, and happy stretching!</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=20394 href="#20394">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/2001 9:18:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jacky Ligon wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt;Let&apos;s stretch the above familiar JI scale by .428 cents, to slightly<br/>augment each degree proportionally.

The difference here is that we<br/>will wish to make the scale have larger steps at the lower end of the<br/>tuning, which grow progressively smaller toward the middle of the<br/>scale, then in a reverse order; grow larger toward the top of the<br/>scale. I&apos;ve read about this kind of tuning in regard to Piano Stretch<br/>Tuning, as well as Gamelan, where a similar logic may be used across<br/>several octaves - or in the case of Gamelan metallophones - about a 2<br/>octave range. Here we&apos;ll use our familiar 5 Limit mode over a 2<br/>octave range as an example. As follows:</p><p>Ratio          Cents                Consecutive Intervals<br/>1/1            0.000<br/>9/8            203.910              203.910<br/>6/5            315.641              111.731<br/>5/4            386.314              70.672<br/>4/3            498.045              111.731<br/>3/2            701.955              203.910<br/>8/5            813.686              111.731<br/>5/3            884.359              70.672<br/>16/9           996.090              111.731<br/>2/1            1200.000             203.910<br/>               1403.910             203.910<br/>               1515.641             111.731<br/>               1586.314             70.672<br/>               1698.045             111.731<br/>               1901.955             203.910<br/>               2013.686             111.731<br/>               2084.359             70.672<br/>                 2196.090             111.731<br/>                 2400.000             203.910</p><p>Applying the stretch to this scale is a two step process, where we<br/>first add a &quot;curved series&quot; to each scale degree, then secondly, we<br/>compress the overall tuning (to be explained).</p><p>An important note is that the curve one chooses may be of many<br/>varieties (a simple linear approach is also good).

To do this<br/>we&apos;ll have to use 8.1 cents multiplied by 1-18 to obtain our<br/>compression table, looking like this:</p><p>8.1<br/>16.2<br/>24.3<br/>32.4<br/>40.5<br/>48.6<br/>56.7<br/>64.8<br/>72.9<br/>81<br/>89.1<br/>97.2<br/>105.3<br/>113.4<br/>121.5<br/>129.6<br/>137.7<br/>145.8</p><p>So now we simply subtract these values from the above, which gives us<br/>a stretched octave of 1215.100 cents, and our final tuning:</p><p>Cents                Consecutive Intervals<br/>0<br/>229.810              229.810<br/>354.441              124.631<br/>430.014              75.572<br/>541.645              111.631<br/>742.455              200.810<br/>849.086              106.631<br/>913.659              64.572<br/>1018.290             104.631<br/>1215.100             196.810<br/>1411.910             196.810<br/>1516.541             104.631<br/>1581.114             64.572<br/>1687.745             106.631<br/>1888.555             200.810<br/>2000.186             111.631<br/>2075.759             75.572<br/>2200.390             124.631<br/>2430.200             229.810</p><p>You&apos;ll notice here, that the inversional symmetry of our scale has<br/>not been corrupted by this process, which lends itself to very<br/>orderly behavior as one plays across the range.  Of course our 5<br/>Limit template scale, which this tuning is generated from, has been<br/>totally transformed. Interestingly though, this takes on an<br/>incredibly &quot;Gamelan-like&quot; quality, which is unbelievable sweet and<br/>expansive. I prefer this on a metallophone timbre, and have played it<br/>extensively on a vibraphone patch to pleasing effect. There is<br/>something truly magical about the infinite possibilities of what one<br/>can do with this technique. An obvious transposition of this, would<br/>be to use an inverted curve to compress the octave, but I&apos;ll leave<br/>that to the experimentalists out there to try (I&apos;ve tried it and like<br/>it, but somehow prefer stretched rather than compressed octaves for<br/>this).</p><p>If Dan Stearns or Jeff Scott (or anyone for that matter) can show a<br/>more formal method of doing this, the Paeans will issue forth<br/>immediately.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=20404 href="#20404">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2001 5:53:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20388.html#20397">/tuning/topicId_20388.html#20397</a></p><p>&gt; In message:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_20388.html#20388">/tuning/topicId_20388.html#20388</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We looked at how we may apply a linear stretch to a JI Scale<br/>&gt; (and masterfully expanded upon by microtonal semi-deity Dan<br/>&gt; Stearns), to tune a few cents away from JI (ironically something<br/>&gt; advocated by former list member, Paul Erlich); our purpose being<br/>&gt; to introduce subtle beating - or natural &quot;chorusing&quot; - into a<br/>&gt; well known 5 limit mode.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Today let&apos;s take a look at how we may use a similar logic to<br/>&gt; apply a &quot;Curved Stretch&quot; to the same mode.

Somehow, I WAS able to copy it in Internet Explorer,<br/>and<br/>got the page.  Since it is so short, I am reproducing it below, if<br/>you don&apos;t mind:</p><p>Sunday, March 25, 2001</p><p>On Another Scale Altogether<br/>MicroFest&apos;s organizers are expanding the annual event to take<br/>advantage of growing Western interest in the alternate pitches of<br/>microtonality.</p><p>By JOSEF WOODARD</p><p>     &quot;In the cracks&quot; is the operative phrase for microtonal music.<br/>This is music with notes and scales that fall between those of<br/>conventional Western music, which assigns 12 pitches to an octave.<br/>Tuning systems outside of that norm can strike many ears as weird,<br/>even heretical. Never mind that a variety of musical schemes have<br/>existed in other parts of the world since time immemorial.<br/>     Poetically enough, the culture of microtonal music too tends to<br/>fall between the cracks of existing institutional and performance<br/>channels. But that may be changing. Microtonality has been sneaking<br/>into wider consciousness through world music and such rock artists as<br/>Sonic Youth, as well as through underground scenes where<br/>experimentalism and self-determination rule.<br/>     John Schneider--microtonal performer and composer, Pierce<br/>College<br/>music professor and founder-director of MicroFest, an annual<br/>celebration of microtonality--has been in a good position to note the<br/>widening world of unconventional tuning. &quot;Everybody I talk to, all of<br/>a sudden, says, &apos;I know about that music.&apos; In every musical<br/>community,<br/>there&apos;s somebody who has gone micro,&quot; he laughs.<br/>     Fittingly, this year, MicroFest will also widen its reach. The<br/>kickoff, April 6-8, will include concerts and an academic-style<br/>conference, and there will be four performance events around the area<br/>in May that will also carry MicroFest sponsorship.<br/>     The centerpiece of the April festival, organized by Harvey Mudd<br/>College assistant music professor Bill Alves, a participant in<br/>previous festivals, will be a tribute to Northern California composer<br/>Lou Harrison. Harrison is arguably the best-known microtonal composer<br/>in the world. He will give a keynote address April 7, the night<br/>before<br/>a concert of his music, which will include the world premiere of a<br/>piece he wrote in 1935, at age 17. The work is scored for eight<br/>stringed instruments in quarter tones.<br/>     MicroFest&apos;s expanding profile in Southern California is no<br/>fluke.<br/>Microtonal events have taken place around the country, including the<br/>American Festival of Microtonal Music in New York, run for the last<br/>17<br/>years by bassoonist Johnny Reinhard. But Southern California was home<br/>to two influential early U.S. experimenters in alternate tunings,<br/>John<br/>Cage and especially Harry Partch, a patron saint of this subculture.<br/>Partch, who was born in Oakland and lived in many places around Los<br/>Angeles and San Diego later in his life, constructed his own musical<br/>universe out of a personalized 43-tones-to-the-octave scale and<br/>elaborate handmade instruments to make it manifest. The May MicroFest<br/>events include a Partch centennial celebration, in conjunction with<br/>UCLA, and features an instrument &quot;petting zoo,&quot; a performance, panels<br/>and screenings of two films about Partch.<br/>     Now, says Alves, in addition to &quot;the Harry Partch heritage,&quot;<br/>Southern California is home to microtonal theorist Erv Wilson and<br/>one-time Partch collaborator Jonathan Glazier, who runs the Sonic Art<br/>Gallery in San Diego. The delightfully eccentric microtonal prophet<br/>and instrument-maker Ivor Darreg, who died in 1994, operated out of<br/>his home in Glendale. Other avid microtonalists here include<br/>players--mostly percussionists--and composers Kraig Grady, Ron George<br/>and Rod Poole, each of whom is putting together MicroFest concerts.<br/>     Schneider sees the strength of the microtonal community in these<br/>parts as a natural result of both the experimental tradition, on the<br/>one hand, &quot;and the influence of the incredible ethnic salad&quot; here, on<br/>the other. &quot;The fact is that West Coast musicians have always felt<br/>somewhat apart from East Coast tradition, which itself is beholden to<br/>European tradition. We&apos;re about as far away as you can get from<br/>Europe. Part of the reason people are here is that they&apos;re looking<br/>for<br/>another way. And because of our proximity to the Pacific Rim, that<br/>influence, I think, is very strong.&quot;<br/>     Schneider got the festival bug after joining Reinhard for a<br/>festival in Denver called Microstock. He says, &quot;I got to thinking,<br/>&apos;Why not here?&apos; &quot;<br/>     In 1997, MicroFest began at Pierce College in Woodland Hills<br/>with<br/>just one concert. From the beginning, Schneider wanted the festival<br/>to<br/>showcase music from different stylistic quarters. Concerts have<br/>included the Indonesian gamelan and Persian music, alternate-tuned<br/>folk music and experimental composers such as Ben Johnston, who<br/>studied with Partch in the &apos;50s and whose music was featured in last<br/>year&apos;s festival.<br/>     Schneider defines microtonality&apos;s appeal for musicians as &quot;a new<br/>toy box.&quot; &quot;For us in the West, it&apos;s like, what are all these colors?&quot;<br/>says Schneider, who hosts the radio program &quot;Global Village&quot; on<br/>KPFK-FM (90.7). &quot;But a lot of Western musicians don&apos;t have a handle<br/>on<br/>what to do with these things, because it is new material. I always<br/>find it instructive to turn to traditions who have had [these<br/>tunings]<br/>for centuries, if not millennia.&quot;<br/>     Schneider&apos;s long-range goals for MicroFest include building a<br/>complete set of reproductions of Partch&apos;s instruments--he has created<br/>three so far; starting a touring MicroFest ensemble; and creating a<br/>MicroFest record label, &quot;a focal point for the dissemination for<br/>microtonal music.&quot;<br/>     It was Alves who pushed to add a conference to the festival this<br/>year, and raised funds to help it happen. Most of the papers will<br/>come<br/>from microtonal practitioners rather than professors per se.<br/>According<br/>to Alves, &quot;The academic universe, at least in the United States, as a<br/>generalization, doesn&apos;t have very much interest in microtonal music.<br/>I&apos;m not sure why that is, except for the inherent conservatism of the<br/>academy. Of course, it was much more conservative back when Harry<br/>Partch was beating his head up against it.&quot; Among the topics: &quot;Visual<br/>Music: A Graphic Appreciation of Partch&apos;s Tuning,&quot; &quot;Making the<br/>Recorder Microtonal&quot; and &quot;Navigating the Infinite Web of Pitch<br/>Space.&quot;<br/>     As a composer, Alves&apos; own path to a belief in alternate tunings<br/>included a passionate interest in Indonesian music. He spent time<br/>studying the gamelan in Java, and had instruments built to his<br/>specifications there, which he will perform with April 6.<br/>     Alves admits that the esoterica involved in microtonality can<br/>lead to a certain cultishness. But, he says, &quot;I certainly hope that<br/>people look upon microtonality and alternate tunings as something<br/>serious and something that is not just what a couple of crackpots are<br/>doing in California.&quot;<br/>     The papers at the festival, he says, will mostly appeal to the<br/>initiated, but the performances should make converts to the cause.<br/>     &quot;We&apos;ve been hearing this tuning system with 12 notes for so<br/>long,&quot; he says, &quot;it&apos;s only natural that we fit things to it. But once<br/>you start to train yourself to listen out of that, to hear the<br/>harmonies for what they are instead of for what they aren&apos;t, it can<br/>make music a more wonderful experience.<br/>     &quot;Microtonality is not a style but it certainly does lend to the<br/>composer new avenues of exploration,&quot; he continues. &quot;It can lead to<br/>new ways of thinking about music and new ways of hearing music.<br/>That&apos;s<br/>one of the most startling things that people discover when they start<br/>getting into this. They begin to hear [typical 12-tone tuning] as a<br/>kind of gray, monochrome music that doesn&apos;t offer the<br/>wonderful-sounding pure chords or very expressive nuances of pitch or<br/>other potentials that other tuning systems can offer.&quot;</p><p>* * *</p><p>     On the Schedule for MicroFest 2001 April 6-8<br/>     &quot;Conference and Festival of Music in Alternate Tunings,&quot; at the<br/>Claremont Colleges.
