This<br/>is a stretch, since I&apos;ve been accustomed to 30 odd (let me tell you)<br/>years composing at the instrument.</p><p>It&apos;s over.  Only the tunable MIDI keyboard now... the piano is just not<br/>flexible enough.  The neighbors also dislike the piano, which is one<br/>sensible thing about them.</p><p>I have an idea for this process... that probably many of you are already<br/>using.  The principle is to use the MIDI keyboard as a kind of<br/>TABLATURE... practically in the &quot;guitar&quot; sense.</p><p>In other words, in order to minimize the &quot;extra baggage&quot; that would go<br/>with trying to figure out how to notate microtonality... let&apos;s say a<br/>scale in 19 tones per octave, for example, I simply notate literally on<br/>the staff what I am playing on the MIDI keyboard.</p><p>LATER, I will do the &quot;translation&quot; process of figuring out what the<br/>12-tET notes really are.  Why do I have to do this?? Well, the answer is<br/>obvious, unless one is strictly writing electronic music which, I<br/>personally believe, should never be notated unless it is accompanying<br/>other live instruments.</p><p>The &quot;translation&quot; to 12-tET is, of course, not really difficult at<br/>all... not much different than transposing the traditional &quot;transposing<br/>instruments&quot; in part copying.</p><p>All we need to do is find the 1/1, which is Scala is always &quot;middle C&quot;<br/>or 261.63HZ.  From there, Scala makes it very clear through the simple<br/>&quot;Show&quot; command what all the cents values are.  One can easily<br/>&quot;translate&quot; the MIDI tablature notation to &quot;real&quot; 12-tET pitches for<br/>traditional instruments.</p><p>Of course, practically each pitch will have a cents value minus or plus<br/>over it... but that will be a new &quot;performance practice&quot; for traditional<br/>instruments performing microtonality.</p><p>Curiously enough, sometimes I am finding that the Scala scale does not<br/>transmit &quot;middle C&quot; 261HZ to the &quot;middle C&quot; on my MIDI keyboard.  Does<br/>anyone know why that is??  Fortunately, I can use a &quot;tuning meter&quot; to<br/>figure out where 261HZ really is, and I can go from there in translating<br/>my &quot;tablature keyboard&quot; notation to &quot;real&quot; 12-tET notation.</p><p>Are other people working this way, also??  The advantage, I believe, is<br/>that one can just write notes down on paper that we are used to... and<br/>not worry about all the pitch/performance particulars until LATER.  That<br/>way, the compositional process is not impeded... and, let&apos;s face it,<br/>we&apos;re used to writing notes down on paper from a keyboard, so better<br/>leave the &quot;translation&quot; to a later stage...</p><p>I guess the real question is whether traditional instrumentalists can or<br/>will really play this stuff.  I was heartened in listening to a huge<br/>performance recently in Alice Tully Hall of Earle Brown&apos;s music...  The<br/>instrumentalists were asked to do a LOT of things... harmonics, unusual<br/>techniques, etc., so I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that asking performers<br/>to think of a semitone as 100 steps in cents is really not such a big<br/>deal after all.  Certainly the strings and vocalists can learn to do<br/>this division in cents.  And, of course, the brass instruments may<br/>already have the required pitches in their spectra of harmonics.  The<br/>woodwinds may be more problematic... and this is why we may need to<br/>concentrate on more &quot;fingering charts&quot; for them...</p><p>Personally, I feel this &quot;new&quot; way of working will make my composing MUCH<br/>less 12-o-centric.  For example, a recent piece I wrote for Johnny<br/>Reinhard was in 1/8 tones.  Personally, I feel the piece was quite<br/>successful... but I still have the lingering feeling that some of the<br/>1/8 tones were &quot;elaborations&quot; of 12-tET pitches that I couldn&apos;t help but<br/>give predominance... at least in the back of my mind, due to the<br/>accustomization.</p><p>But, what would it be like to compose at a keyboard where I didn&apos;t have<br/>the vaguest idea of what the notes were!!  Much better, I believe.</p><p>We&apos;ll see how this goes.  At least I&apos;m not sitting at the piano anymore,<br/>which is, I believe, a BIG accomplishment...</p><p>_____________ ______ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=10302 href="#10302">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2000 5:01:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, 28 May 2000, Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; In other words, in order to minimize the &quot;extra baggage&quot; that would go<br/>&gt; with trying to figure out how to notate microtonality... let&apos;s say a<br/>&gt; scale in 19 tones per octave, for example, I simply notate literally on<br/>&gt; the staff what I am playing on the MIDI keyboard.</p><p>As you may have guessed, this is such an old idea that there is a body of<br/>literature arguing against it.  Harry Partch, who generally used tablatures of<br/>his own devising, did notate modified keyboard instruments this way for<br/>performance.</p><p>&gt; LATER, I will do the &quot;translation&quot; process of figuring out what the<br/>&gt; 12-tET notes really are.  Why do I have to do this?? Well, the answer is<br/>&gt; obvious, unless one is strictly writing electronic music which, I<br/>&gt; personally believe, should never be notated unless it is accompanying<br/>&gt; other live instruments.</p><p>Translate to 12-tET?  The very thought of it!  And electronic music should<br/>never be notated?  I disagree there as well.  Partly because somebody else may<br/>need to understand it one day.  Or you might even need to convert it to use a<br/>different synthesizer.  Or live, electronic instruments may be accompanying<br/>each other.</p><p>&gt; The &quot;translation&quot; to 12-tET is, of course, not really difficult at<br/>&gt; all... not much different than transposing the traditional &quot;transposing<br/>&gt; instruments&quot; in part copying.</p><p>It would be nice if the computer could do this sort of thing automatically.<br/>Unfortunately, I&apos;m not aware of any that do.  There are some open source<br/>sequencers out there now, although I haven&apos;t looked at modifying them yet.  The<br/>idea would be that you could have a common format for the score, and then print<br/>out each part in a tablature specific for that instrument.  Or the music could<br/>be published electronically, and people could choose their favourite notation<br/>to view it in.  Much like you can choose to view a MIDI file in either piano<br/>roll or staff notation.</p><p>&gt; All we need to do is find the 1/1, which is Scala is always &quot;middle C&quot;<br/>&gt; or 261.63HZ.</p><p>I think you&apos;ll find that Scala chooses the 1/1 at &quot;middle C&quot; such that A is 440<br/>Hz.  Unless you tell it otherwise.</p><p>&gt; Of course, practically each pitch will have a cents value minus or plus<br/>&gt; over it... but that will be a new &quot;performance practice&quot; for traditional<br/>&gt; instruments performing microtonality.</p><p>This is another old argument, but I prefer the idea of using a notation that<br/>fits the tuning.  Like staff notation with &quot;quartertone&quot; shifts for meantone,<br/>or 12-note notation with comma shifts for schismic (or even JI).  I think there<br/>is some evidence that performers do find the 12-tET with cent deviations<br/>easier, but I don&apos;t know how that scales down to less technically proficient,<br/>non-specialists.  The fact this remains controversial shows why it would be so<br/>good not to choose, and publish the music in a mutable, electronic way.</p><p>&gt; Curiously enough, sometimes I am finding that the Scala scale does not<br/>&gt; transmit &quot;middle C&quot; 261HZ to the &quot;middle C&quot; on my MIDI keyboard.</p><p>See above.  You need to use a keyboard map file to change the reference note<br/>from a to C.</p><p>&gt; Are other people working this way, also??  The advantage, I believe, is<br/>&gt; that one can just write notes down on paper that we are used to... and<br/>&gt; not worry about all the pitch/performance particulars until LATER.  That<br/>&gt; way, the compositional process is not impeded... and, let&apos;s face it,<br/>&gt; we&apos;re used to writing notes down on paper from a keyboard, so better<br/>&gt; leave the &quot;translation&quot; to a later stage...</p><p>Yes, I generally write the music as it looks on the keyboard.  But I also<br/>choose 12 note octaves so that it roughly corresponds to what I hear.  With my<br/>meantone guitar, I use a modified guitar tablature with &quot;quartertone&quot; shifts.<br/>When I use my 12-note fourth keyboard mapping, I either use a similar 12-note<br/>octave notation, or write it as it looks.  If I wrote stuff down for that<br/>mapping a lot, I suspect I&apos;d move to the former idea.  It&apos;s closer to how I<br/>think when I play it.</p><p>There&apos;s stuff on my website about this.  Try<br/><a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/schismic.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/schismic.htm</a></p><p>&gt; I guess the real question is whether traditional instrumentalists can or<br/>&gt; will really play this stuff.

I&apos;ll just repeat,<br/>for those too thick too catch it the first two times, that it would be really<br/>cool for the computer to automatically generate a tablature for the woodwinds<br/>based on whatever format you use for the score.  If we talk about this enough,<br/>perhaps somebody will write the program for us.</p><p>&gt; Personally, I feel this &quot;new&quot; way of working will make my composing MUCH<br/>&gt; less 12-o-centric.  For example, a recent piece I wrote for Johnny<br/>&gt; Reinhard was in 1/8 tones.

But just try writing 12-o-centric music in<br/>5- or 7-tET!  Both of them fit a traditional keyboard really well.</p><p>&gt; But, what would it be like to compose at a keyboard where I didn&apos;t have<br/>&gt; the vaguest idea of what the notes were!!  Much better, I believe.</p><p>So long as it&apos;s a good tuning on there.  Not that it&apos;s that easy to find a bad<br/>tuning (I have experimented with random tunings, and they work quite well, at<br/>least melodically).  Ideally, the theory would give you a scale (static or<br/>otherwise) and you use you ears from there.</p><p>Another idea is to use the sequencer as a guide to rhythm.  Play in the music<br/>as you think it should sound, then work out how to fit it to the staff.  Adjust<br/>the sequenced notes to match what you&apos;ve written, and see if any subtlety is<br/>lost.  That should discourage you from using rhythmic patterns that look good<br/>on paper.  Although instrumentalists are already used to working around these.</p><p>                                     Graham</p></div>
