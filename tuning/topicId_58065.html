But the red keys fall way back now, making it plenty difficult<br/>&gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; reach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They do look short on second look; I have them as one-third the length of<br/>&gt; white keys. That&apos;s why I need to build a non-playing octachordal model to<br/>&gt; get the design right. I&apos;m leaning towards the thumb-key version.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thumb-keys may pose more problems than they solve.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I see. But for those like me who prefer pythagorean thirds to pure<br/>thirds,<br/>&gt; &gt; it will become a nuisance after a while. What do you think about<br/>splitting<br/>&gt; &gt; E<br/>&gt; &gt; and B by the belly into two portions?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I didn&apos;t think about that. You mean a horizontal division of the key, so<br/>&gt; that the upper part plays B-natural and the lower part plays B half-flat<br/>or<br/>&gt; comma-flat?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Right!</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m kind of afraid that the whole keyboard itself may have to be done from<br/>&gt; scratch. I&apos;m not really a fan of generalized keyboards like Bosanquet&apos;s. I<br/>&gt; want something that&apos;s similar enough to ordinary Halberstadt to ease<br/>&gt; transition, and not something like Partch&apos;s Chromelodeon which spreads out<br/>&gt; an octave of notes out over more than two octaves of keys, because I&apos;d<br/>like<br/>&gt; to be able to play normal chords with the right hand and octaves with the<br/>&gt; left.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That&apos;s also an issue I prioritize with microtonal keyboards.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I would vote personally for the Ultratonal Piano that can individually<br/>&gt; &gt; tune<br/>&gt; &gt; each tone corresponsing to the 12 keys per octave in ordinary pianos.<br/>The<br/>&gt; &gt; pedals actually don&apos;t serve to tune, but to reset a scale configuration<br/>&gt; &gt; designated to one of the seven keyboard regions. It is the pitch-benders<br/>&gt; &gt; right beneath the thumbs that do the trick. The tuning pins ought to be<br/>&gt; &gt; locked before the device is installed to prevent loss of string tension.<br/>&gt; &gt; Also, the entire set of pitches need to be reduced by a semitone for<br/>&gt; &gt; optimum<br/>&gt; &gt; operational range. The maximum amount each key can be altered will be<br/>&gt; &gt; about<br/>&gt; &gt; a semitone in each direction. That allows plenty room for hundreds of<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll have to look at the PDF real good. Please let me know if you ever<br/>make<br/>&gt; an English translation.</p><p>Sure, I&apos;ll let you know firsthand.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; As long as you have a total pitch-bend of one semitone, you&apos;re in good<br/>&gt; shape. Somebody posted on Tuning-L a long time ago that someone else came<br/>up &gt; with the idea of sending an electrical current through certain strings<br/>in<br/>&gt; order to heat them, slightly lowering their pitch.</p><p>I heard about such a thing, but hardly think it will work. Application of<br/>heat to the material will weaken the fabric of the strings, and cause them<br/>to snap in loud passages.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s an article somewhere... but you know how Yahoo! Groups archive<br/>&gt; search is; it&apos;s near impossible to find anything from more than a few<br/>months<br/>&gt; past.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, now I see that the new interface does not display Turkish characters!<br/>Maybe we should move the whole thing to another platform or a neatly<br/>organized forum with e-mail support.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Thank you for the compliments! Neva Ceng-i Harbi is a Mehter piece from<br/>at<br/>&gt; &gt; least 250 years ago. The Piano arrangement is that of a folk song from<br/>&gt; &gt; Aegea<br/>&gt; &gt; I think. The piece I intended for a piano and two kemenchas is based on<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; theme given to me by the legendary Turkish kemencha performer Ihsan<br/>Ozgen.<br/>&gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; have several other compositions, but I never had time to make them<br/>&gt; &gt; presentable. Maybe in due course...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I came across this page:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.goldenhorn.com/display.php4?content=records&page=ghp019.html">http://www.goldenhorn.com/display.php4?content=records&page=ghp019.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; while Googling for kemen&iuml;&iquest;&half;e, and it mentions Ihsan &iuml;&iquest;&half;zgen (is the first &apos;I&apos;<br/>&gt; dotted?). I always get the instrument confused with the Iranian kamancheh,<br/>&gt; which you know is quite different in shape.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll listen to the sound samples real soon.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ihsan Ozgen is my elder colleague whom I see often on the Istanbul Technical<br/>University Turkish Conservatory grounds. That&apos;s where I currently pursue my<br/>doctorate career.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p></div><h3><a id=58108 href="#58108">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2005 8:12:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[encoding changed to UTF-8 because I mixed Turkish and Icelandic characters]</p><p>Hello Ozan.

In my Ultratonal Piano (tm) design, a 3 times 12-row set of pitch-benders corresponding to the Halberstadt keys per octave are controlled by the thumb as the pianist plays on. This way, each tone of an acoustic piano can be bent a semitone up or down just as it is done with MIDI pitch-benders today.</p><p>The Haba 36-tone piano built by August F&ouml;rster is truly a monstrous machine, which I would love to get my paws on, but unfortunately lack the means to. Is there anyway I can get close to this model?</p><p>The Fokker keyboard design is also very interesting. But I&apos;m a fan of Halberstadt and have little difficulty playing such chords as C-G-Bb-C-E since I have quite large hands.</p><p>On second thought, I conclude that 31tET is not the best of choices for Maqam Music.
