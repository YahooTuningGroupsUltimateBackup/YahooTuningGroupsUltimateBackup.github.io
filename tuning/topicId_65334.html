It strings all manner of<br/>&gt; major-7th and dominant-9th chords together,<br/>&gt; one after another ... thus, breaking all the rules.<br/>&gt; And most importantly, it sounds beautiful.<br/>&gt; Yeah, but with Satie (&amp; Debussy and Stravinsky...) we&apos;re really no longer in common practice land. A number of things are different here -- Satie doesn&apos;t stick to four voices, planing (massively parallel voice leading), reduced importance for authentic cadences, and going beyond a strict triadic (including diminished and augmented) + seventh (including augmented sixths and diminished) chordal lexicon. But it is also interesting to consider how Satie and his contemporaries did, in fact, stay consistent within their own rule sets. Satie&apos;s Rosicrucian music, for example, consistantly inverts the identities of the intervals in terms of consonance or dissonance.</p><p>(BTW I&apos;ve heard barbershop singers sometimes use planing as well -- sliding up or down on a particular chord voicing as a special effect. I have the impression that they keep this well in reserve -- with overuse considered to be bad form, and certainly not as desirable as voice leading with contrary motion).</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=65348 href="#65348">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2006 5:58:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Wolf &lt;djwolf@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (BTW, the single fact about voice leading that impresses<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; me the most is that, in four voices, it&apos;s impossible to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; follow any of the standard rules sets and have two<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; complete 7th chords in a row).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmm, that&apos;s interesting.

Because of the already tough<br/>job of being exceptionally precise in blend and tuning and stability<br/>for the goal of strong, expanded chords, there is a point where things<br/>that may be theoretically possible are simply too hard for even the best<br/>quartet to perfect.  If the bass were on a 5 or 7 identity, it makes tuning<br/>harder because the other parts have far fewer overtones from the bass<br/>to match their notes to (because I&apos;m assuming if the bass is on the 5<br/>idenity, we aren&apos;t doubling it and losing the other identities).</p><p>If there were more than 4 parts, this might get easier.  But for the<br/>2, 3, and 7 identities to learn to match overtones from a low 3<br/>identity note is probably beyond realistic capabilities of most even<br/>very good singers.  It would require the singer with the 2 identity to<br/>come out and have the bass and other parts tune to that.  And this<br/>does happen!</p><p>However, if years of hard work is required to master barbershop<br/>harmony as is, then telling each part that they have even more work<br/>to do isn&apos;t going to be easy.  If the basses get used to 2 and 3<br/>identities, then they learn that feel and relation within the chords.<br/>Baritones get used to harmonizing to the bass (and also to the chord<br/>overall).  If you put the baritone on a 2 identity and the bass on a 5,<br/>then you are asking them to switch their mode of thinking.  You&apos;re<br/>asking the baritone to be strong and support the chord, while the<br/>bass carefully tunes to the baritone.  Simple deductions will show<br/>you that a singer who is required to master both these modes of<br/>harmonizing will have more work to do and it will be a greater<br/>challenge.</p><p>That is all aside from the simple fact that lower identities lower in<br/>the chord will always produce a simpler, easier blend and tuning.</p><p>Then on top of all of that, add the issue that the basses learn to<br/>sing pythagorean notes in order to make the fifths resolution<br/>patterns work, and then you&apos;re dealing with a bass who is used to<br/>always singing around 81/64 (for example), and all of a sudden<br/>asking them to sing 5/4.  The tenors (and really all the upper parts)<br/>have been practicing singing 5/4s over the bass forever.  There<br/>is simply no way that it will be easy for any quartet to make these<br/>tuning shifts in their thinking that easy.</p><p>And again, add to that point that the 5 identity or 7 identity bass<br/>note chords will never blend as easily or simply and you&apos;ve got<br/>a real problem trying to teach a quartet what it is they are listening<br/>for and how much consonance to really expect.</p><p>Oh, and Carl&apos;s voice range issue as far as inverted chords in low<br/>ranges is there too.</p><p>Anyway, I can clearly tell you that the basses on roots and fifths<br/>rule was not decided by theorists, it was discovered as the case<br/>after analyzing what woodshedding quartets were doing for<br/>the most part.  And these rules are not followed totally strictly<br/>either.  The tag for &quot;Wild Irish Rose,&quot; among the most sung songs<br/>of all has one chord with the basses on the 5 identity (and I can<br/>tell you though that it is often, possibly majority of the time, sung<br/>wrong or poorly, though it is nice when done right).</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=65369 href="#65369">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2006 9:55:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; If there were more than 4 parts, this might get easier.

Nobody said first<br/>inversion chords were &quot;awful.&quot;</p><p>Simply put, it is basic acoustics that defines that 1st inversion chords<br/>are harder to justly tune and blend than second inversion.  That<br/>doesn&apos;t mean they are awful or worse.  But very little common practice<br/>music puts emphasis on expanded, tightly tuned harmonic structures<br/>anywhere near as much as in barbershop.  Fact is, barbershoppers<br/>could easily sing first inversion chords, if they simply accept that<br/>they won&apos;t blend very well and will sound much less consonant than<br/>the normal chords barbershoppers go for.  But most barbershoppers<br/>want to focus on getting all the chords blended and get that expanded<br/>sound.</p><p>Besides, how much common practice music actually differentiates at<br/>all between pythagorean and harmonic intervals?  Since most common<br/>practice music is not as precisely harmonically tuned as barbershop,<br/>the less perfectly harmonically tuned root position chord isn&apos;t as<br/>extremely consonant as so is less different from the 1st inversion.</p><p>Another angle:  in barbershop, the chords are so harmonically tuned<br/>that when the bass is on the fifth of the chord, it doesn&apos;t sound that<br/>much like a classical second inversion chord, because the expanded<br/>harmonic sound blends everything together and we can even still<br/>sense the fundamental missing low root note.  Common practice<br/>music generally thinks in terms of voice-leading that is based<br/>on perceiving each part as its own line.  In well done barbershop,<br/>the bass isn&apos;t meant to be heard as a distinct polyphonic part, but<br/>rather the entire quartet is heard as almost one sound.</p><p>A tangential question would be: how common is it in classical<br/>repertoire for organ to have an organ tone that includes a particularly<br/>low third in the tone structure?  Since barbershop quartets try to<br/>become one sound, it is almost more fair to compare the blend<br/>of the quartet to the varying tones of an organ, more than comparing<br/>each singer to polyphonic parts of a classical composition.</p><p>Additionally, the bass in barbershop is almost never on the fifth<br/>of a major triad.  The bass is only on the fifth of seventh chords.  So,<br/>whereas in common practice music, 1st inversion is common on<br/>triads, barbershop sticks just to root position.  That isn&apos;t contradictory,<br/>just simpler even.</p><p>I doubt that you can find an example of a cappella common practice<br/>music that *both* has lots of 1st inversion chords and also has anything<br/>similar to the barbershop focus on harmonic blend as opposed to<br/>polyphonic melodic focus.  But if you can, I&apos;d be curious to hear it.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div>
