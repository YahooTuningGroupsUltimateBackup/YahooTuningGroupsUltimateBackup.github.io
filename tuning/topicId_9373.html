Perhaps some of you tuners have already<br/>blazed this trail?</p><p>First of all, I&apos;m working on a Macintosh, usually my G3 PowerBook, with no<br/>special sound hardware.  (I also have an ancient Mac IIfx with the original<br/>Sound Accelerator card and DAT I/O, but I doubt if anything supports that kind<br/>of ancient history anymore.)  What I&apos;d like is software that allows me to plug<br/>my synth into the audio input of my G3 PowerBook, punch a record button on the<br/>software, play the sounds, punch a stop button, then save it as an MP3.  Simple!</p><p>Can anybody recommend such a program or system of programs?  Thanks a bunch!</p></div>
