I have also just<br/>recently started digging around in Joe Monzo&apos;s tuning dictionary and found the<br/>word _pain_ defined with reference to distance [of deviation from ideal]<br/>squared.  <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/pain.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/pain.htm</a></p><p>My own theory or view of tuning has a bit in common with these two concepts.<br/>It is mainly concerned with the fact that an arbitrary pitch seems to form a<br/>recognisable interval with some other pitch, even when there is a substantial<br/>deviation from a perfect/just interval.  Compare this with the fact that any<br/>object in nearby space is within the gravitational fields of Earth, our sun and<br/>the moon; it is therefore under the influence of at least three heavenly<br/>bodies.  If this object is not involved in a stable orbit, one of either the<br/>sun, moon or Earth will drag it towards itself depending on whose field<br/>strength is strongest at the location of the object in question.  So even<br/>though the object was located at an arbitrary point, and not standing firmly<br/>upon one of the heavenly bodies, it still formed a clear association with one<br/>of them.</p><p>The gravitational attraction to a heavenly body (or anything for that matter)<br/>is proportional to the mass of the body, and indirectly proportional to the<br/>square of the distance away from the body.</p><p>I consider the realm of tuning as a one dimensional space where distance is<br/>measured in cents, and the heavenly bodies are the rational intervals situated<br/>at points along on a straight line.  I regard the mass of each body as being<br/>the number of common harmonics shared between the pitches forming the rational<br/>interval, which is inversely proportional to the numerator; a perfect fourth<br/>(4/3) has half the number of common harmonics as the interval of an octave<br/>(2/1).  (Others on this list have stated a preference for the geometric mean of<br/>the numerator and denominator as a measure of an intervals consonance.)<br/>Instead of measuring a force of gravitational attraction (in Newtons), I have a<br/>unit that I have been calling _uncertainty_ which is equal to the numerator<br/>when the interval is just, and gets higher according to the amount of pain.<br/>Any arbitrary point along the line representing the space will have rational<br/>intervals nearby which all engage in a gravity-like tug-of-war over that point.<br/>The one having the lowest uncertainty wins, and that value becomes the measure<br/>of uncertainty of that point.  I have been scaling pain so that the point at<br/>49.9 cents is claimed by unity but the point at 50.1 cents is pulled away by<br/>another.  I chose a switchover point of 50 cents because I _assume_ my ears&apos;<br/>pitch selectivity/fussiness/personal-taste/whatever-it&apos;s-called has been formed<br/>by 12tET.  Someone who is more fussy/selective would choose to have pain affect<br/>uncertainty more strongly.  I realise a carefully executed experiment would<br/>provide me with a more honest pain scaling factor, but for now I am not willing<br/>to sacrifice music/art/play time for psychology/science/research time.  Maybe I<br/>will later.</p><p>I am currently using a linear array of uncertainty values to compute the<br/>comparative strength or deficiency of equal temperaments.  I saw a plot of<br/>step-per-octave vs deficiency by Wendy Carlos in Keyboard magazine [Nov 1986<br/>page 65], but it only regarded maj and min chords with and without flattened<br/>sevenths.  I am interested in a more general indication of anything sweet that<br/>a given n-tET can offer.  What I have seen so far seems to support the method<br/>since all the obvious ones stand out: 12, 19, 22, 31, 34, 53tET, and also<br/>88CET.  (I am particularly glad that last one stood out as I quite like the<br/>sound of Gary Morrison&apos;s contribution to the list CD.)</p><p>If you plot uncertainty on a graph where my one dimensional space is the<br/>horizontal axis, you will see a series of convex parabolas (positive<br/>curvature). Some are low and wide, many are high and narrow. You have to get<br/>pretty close to the narrow ones to be caught in their fields, but the wide<br/>ones have huge fields that are difficult to get away from. Roughly translated<br/>this means that you can be a fair way off 702 cents but despite the pain still<br/>be convinced that it is a fifth, but get a relatively small distance away from<br/>316 cents and you end up leaving minor third space and being captured by some<br/>other interval.</p><p>I am now contemplating using the series of parabolas as a means of selecting<br/>rational intervals to form scales.  If you picture them as buckets catching<br/>objects dropped from above, the objects will settle at rational interval<br/>points.  Imagine 13 equally spaced objects (representing 12 steps) falling into<br/>an octave wide series of parabolic buckets, you would be provided with 12<br/>pitches to tune a synth to.  If the pain scaling factor used to produce the<br/>graph is altered so that the &quot;buckets&quot; are wider, there will be less of them as<br/>the more obscure ratios are overcome by the stronger ones.  You would still get<br/>the same number of pitches (assuming the buckets are not ridiculously large)<br/>but they will be more unevenly spaced and give more normal sounding chords.  Of<br/>course you don&apos;t have to drop 13 objects but any number you please.  Just space<br/>them evenly.</p><p>I welcome any comments and/or criticisms.</p><p>DARREN McDOUGALL<br/>Australia</p></div><h3><a id=17853 href="#17853">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2001 4:32:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Darren, your scheme sounds very similar to Paul E&apos;s concept of Harmonic<br/>Entropy.

Bill&apos;s<br/>examples use &quot;2.1 stretched&quot; octaves and/or timbres.  I take this to<br/>mean that, if a note&apos;s fundamental is at 100 Hz, its next higher<br/>(in)harmonic will be at 210 Hz.  That&apos;s 1284.47 cents instead of<br/>1200.00, so the logarithmic stretch factor is 1.0704.

They would imply a fuzziness to any<br/>&quot;virtual fundamental&quot;, and, as far as I can tell, don&apos;t provide much<br/>guidance in forming the best possible intervals between notes.  On the<br/>other hand, alignment of partials is easy and consistent; for example,<br/>a major third would be stretched from 386.31 cents to 413.51 cents.<br/>Starting from 100 Hz, that would be a note at 126.98 Hz; two stretched<br/>&quot;octaves&quot; above that is 4.41 x 126.98 = 559.98, exactly in alignment<br/>with the stretched partial above 100 Hz.</p><p>When I listen to the example that has both stretched timbres and<br/>stretched scale, the alignment seems just right.
