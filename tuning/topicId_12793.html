That&apos;s just not good contrapuntal<br/>practice!</p><p>One of the reasons I like the Wendy Carlos<br/>Harmonic series scale so much is that by<br/>writing non-contrapuntal pieces you can<br/>have that effect as a momentum-creating<br/>force...</p><p>Why don&apos;t you get that Tuning Punks group<br/>(is that Jon?) to post MP3&apos;s of your FP so<br/>that we could hear it?
