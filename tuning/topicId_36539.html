But there&apos;s still a bit of favouritism for the 7-<br/>limit<br/>&gt; over 11.  A chord involving 10:7 will probably involve other more<br/>&gt; comprehensible 7-limit intervals.

It&apos;s all<br/>provisional, but<br/>&gt; there have to be strict rules for the counterpoint.

If you want<br/>to use multiple-12 notation it might make more sense to base it around a<br/>diatonic scale instead of the decimal one.</p><p>All the examples are within the standard Blackjack.</p><p>The rules aren&apos;t that difficult, so I can go over them.  I&apos;ve already<br/>given the consonance levels.  Mostly Fux&apos;s instructions carry over.  The<br/>extra rule is that you can&apos;t move directly between consonances 1 and 3 if<br/>you want them both to sound like consonances.  Unless you really want to.<br/>Probably you shouldn&apos;t hang around in consonance 3 for too long either.</p><p>There are rules about preserving the integrity of the decimal scale.  The<br/>simple rule is that the only intervals found within the decimal scale can<br/>be used.  They&apos;re all a number of secors plus an optional quomma.  This is<br/>the bit that gets difficult if you change the notation.</p><p>To add variety, if three notes are all in rising or falling pitch<br/>sequence, it doesn&apos;t matter if the interval between the second and the<br/>third one is non-decimal, so long as those between the first note and the<br/>other two are.  So 0-1^-2 (C Dv D&gt;) is allowed.  As this is still<br/>restrictive, I&apos;m thinking about allowing the narrowed secors, like 1^-2<br/>(Dv D&gt; or C C#-), in any context.  They can&apos;t be confused with unisons.<br/>But you also have to think about decimal intervals over longer melodic<br/>spans then.  So 0^-1-2v (C&gt; Db+ D) wouldn&apos;t be allowed in a fast passage<br/>as the illegal 0^-2v (C&gt; D) becomes too obvious.  Sticking to Blackjack<br/>mostly avoids this anyway.</p><p>There are other cases where Fux applies special rules to &quot;steps&quot;.  Any<br/>interval of 1 decimal step is a &quot;step&quot;.  3 decimal steps can always be<br/>divided into two unequal &quot;steps&quot;, so in 0-2-3 (C D&gt; Ev) or 0-1-3 (C Db+<br/>Ev), 0-2 (C D&gt;) and 1-3 (Db+ Ev) are &quot;steps&quot;.  But a pair of two decimal<br/>steps, like 0-2-4 (C D&gt; F&lt;), aren&apos;t &quot;steps&quot;.</p><p>Parallel motion and the like should be avoided with all consonance 1<br/>intervals.  That includes 5:2.  You should also avoid using the same<br/>consonance twice in close succession, to give the sense of variety.  You<br/>could even try to avoiding a move from consonance 3 to consonance 2 by<br/>parallel motion.</p><p>Special case rules apply at cadences, and I didn&apos;t really work out how<br/>they should be translated.  Probably you should end on a perfect<br/>consonance by stepwise contrary motion.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=36617 href="#36617">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2002 1:29:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p>&gt; There are other cases where Fux applies special rules to &quot;steps&quot;.<br/>Any<br/>&gt; interval of 1 decimal step is a &quot;step&quot;.  3 decimal steps can always<br/>be<br/>&gt; divided into two unequal &quot;steps&quot;, so in 0-2-3 (C D&gt; Ev) or 0-1-3 (C<br/>Db+<br/>&gt; Ev), 0-2 (C D&gt;) and 1-3 (Db+ Ev) are &quot;steps&quot;.</p><p>does this follow from the fux rules? what does fux say about this? it<br/>would seem to be &quot;illegal pentatonicism&quot; in a diatonic context -- no?</p></div><h3><a id=36618 href="#36618">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2002 5:58:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_36539.html#36614">/tuning/topicId_36539.html#36614</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All the examples are within the standard Blackjack.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>***Hi Graham!</p><p>You must be using the *older* F-C-G Blackjack key, yes?? since<br/>several of the pitches you mention aren&apos;t in &quot;my&quot; current C-G-D-A<br/>key...  ??</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3><a id=36620 href="#36620">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2002 6:23:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_36539.html#36572">/tuning/topicId_36539.html#36572</a></p><p>&gt; In-Reply-To: &lt;aa2fh4+kb4l@e...&gt;<br/>&gt; jpehrson2 wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Graham, I guess, was just employing a rather &quot;loose&quot; definition,<br/>i.e.<br/>&gt; &gt; 2 notes per 1 in the bass, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, I&apos;m employing a very strict definition but, because it&apos;s<br/>adapted to<br/>&gt; decimal notation, not identical to Fux&apos;s.

It&apos;s wider than the traditional tuning of a major second.  In<br/>Palestrina&apos;s day it was well approximated by the diminished third of<br/>keyboard tunings.  But it doesn&apos;t seem to have been exploited as such.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s considered a &quot;mild dissonance&quot; in 12-tET music, isn&apos;t it??</p><p>It&apos;s a dissonance, plain and simple.  But it isn&apos;t in 12-tET.  Much the<br/>same as 7:4, which is in consonance 2.  Traditional harmony only<br/>recognises 5-limit consonance, and everything else is lumped together as<br/>dissonance.  16th-17th Century examples are interesting, in that only a<br/>few kinds of dissonance were actually used.  But they weren&apos;t the 7-limit<br/>chords that are hidden away in meantone.  So harmony as observed by<br/>Palestrina and taught by Fux doesn&apos;t deal with the 7-limit at all.</p><p>Looked at another way, the 12-equal dissonances can all be thought of as<br/>9-limit intervals.  Well, except for minor seconds and major sevenths<br/>which would have to be 15-limit.  So the consonance/dissonance cutoff for<br/>traditional harmony is roughly between the 5-limit and the 9-limit.  You<br/>don&apos;t have to consider the 11-limit because it&apos;s outside the notation.</p><p>Miracle temperament is excellent in both the 7- and 11-limits, but nothing<br/>special in the 5-limit.  So the obvious way to cut it up is for the<br/>7-limit to be consonant and the rest of the 11-limit to be dissonant.<br/>Intervals outside the 11-limit would be extreme dissonances, not to be<br/>used harmonically unless you really want to.</p><p>If you want only 5-limit consonance, you&apos;re better off staying in<br/>meantone.  Remember that the first species can only use consonances.  So<br/>for the system to make sense on its own terms I had to increase the set of<br/>consonances.  I don&apos;t follow the simple 7-limit cutoff because when you<br/>reach that level of complexity you do have to consider octave specificity.<br/> I also allowed the 4 secor interval to be a &quot;respectable&quot; dissonance<br/>because it&apos;s a prominent interval in the tuning, and sounds okay to me<br/>despite being outside the 11-limit.

It&apos;s wider than the traditional tuning of a major<br/>second.  In<br/>&gt; Palestrina&apos;s day it was well approximated by the diminished third<br/>of<br/>&gt; keyboard tunings.  But it doesn&apos;t seem to have been exploited as<br/>such.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s considered a &quot;mild dissonance&quot; in 12-tET music, isn&apos;t it??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a dissonance, plain and simple.  But it isn&apos;t in 12-tET.  Much<br/>the<br/>&gt; same as 7:4, which is in consonance 2.  Traditional harmony only<br/>&gt; recognises 5-limit consonance, and everything else is lumped<br/>together as<br/>&gt; dissonance.  16th-17th Century examples are interesting, in that<br/>only a<br/>&gt; few kinds of dissonance were actually used.  But they weren&apos;t the 7-<br/>limit<br/>&gt; chords that are hidden away in meantone.  So harmony as observed by<br/>&gt; Palestrina and taught by Fux doesn&apos;t deal with the 7-limit at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Looked at another way, the 12-equal dissonances can all be thought<br/>of as<br/>&gt; 9-limit intervals.  Well, except for minor seconds and major<br/>sevenths<br/>&gt; which would have to be 15-limit.  So the consonance/dissonance<br/>cutoff for<br/>&gt; traditional harmony is roughly between the 5-limit and the 9-<br/>limit.  You<br/>&gt; don&apos;t have to consider the 11-limit because it&apos;s outside the<br/>notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Miracle temperament is excellent in both the 7- and 11-limits, but<br/>nothing<br/>&gt; special in the 5-limit.  So the obvious way to cut it up is for the<br/>&gt; 7-limit to be consonant and the rest of the 11-limit to be<br/>dissonant.<br/>&gt; Intervals outside the 11-limit would be extreme dissonances, not to<br/>be<br/>&gt; used harmonically unless you really want to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want only 5-limit consonance, you&apos;re better off staying in<br/>&gt; meantone.  Remember that the first species can only use<br/>consonances.  So<br/>&gt; for the system to make sense on its own terms I had to increase the<br/>set of<br/>&gt; consonances.  I don&apos;t follow the simple 7-limit cutoff because when<br/>you<br/>&gt; reach that level of complexity you do have to consider octave<br/>specificity.<br/>&gt;  I also allowed the 4 secor interval to be a &quot;respectable&quot;<br/>dissonance<br/>&gt; because it&apos;s a prominent interval in the tuning, and sounds okay to<br/>me<br/>&gt; despite being outside the 11-limit.

That it can in<br/>decimal counterpoint (and the 7 from decimal MOS) is a break with<br/>diatonicism.

The diatonic steps will translate to 16:15, 10:9 or 9:8<br/>(maybe even 25:24 or 8:7).  As decimal interval classes, these are either<br/>1 or 2 steps.  However, 2 decimal steps can get a larger than a typical<br/>diatonic step, to cover 8:7 and 7:6.  So to balance this, I don&apos;t allow<br/>two 2-step intervals in a row to both translate as diatonic steps.  That<br/>means two steps can still be a third, which keeps the spirit of the<br/>passing dissonance rule.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what to do about isolated 2-steps where a diatonic step is<br/>expected.  Now I&apos;m using a 7 note scale, probably based on that.  I didn&apos;t<br/>get as far as appoggiaturas in the free decimal examples.  Possibly they<br/>would make more sense resolving by single decimal steps.</p><p>1 or 2 decimal steps being a contrapuntal step is also consistent with 1<br/>or 2 chromatic steps being a diatonic step.  I&apos;m treating the fuzzy<br/>decimal scale as a chromatic because it&apos;s too big and too shapeless to be<br/>a diatonic.</p><p>The increased number of dissonances, and complexity of the rules, is a<br/>looser translation.  I felt it was the only way of treating the decimal<br/>scale on its own terms.  You can twist the scale to give lots of 5-limit<br/>intervals, but then it really will end up sounding diatonic.</p><p>Fux uses step size for other rules.  Leaps greater than a minor sixth are<br/>forbidden (I broke this in a recent example, should fix it) except for<br/>octaves in a particular context, and leaps greater than a third are enough<br/>to obscure parallel fifths in another context.  As &quot;steps&quot; are generalized<br/>by their size, the same can be done for these other cases.  If diatonic<br/>steps were mapped to decimal steps, I&apos;d have to decide whether leaps<br/>should be illegal if greater than 5 or 8 (10-2) steps.</p><p>The pattern 8-0-1 counts as consecutive steps by my rule.  The 8-0<br/>interval approximates 7:6 and the 0-1 approximates 15:14, so the whole 8-1<br/>approximates 5:4.  In meantone, that&apos;d be C-D#-E, including an augmented<br/>second which lies outside the diatonic scale, and is rarely used as a<br/>melodic interval in 16th century music.  So the generalisation of diatonic<br/>steps still gives results that would be impossible in a diatonic context,<br/>because it is framed in terms of decimal steps.  A more direct translation<br/>would have been to allow 0-2v as a step, but rarely 0-2 and never 0v-2.</p><p>                         Graham</p></div>
