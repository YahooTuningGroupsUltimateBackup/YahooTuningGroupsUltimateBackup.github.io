This is<br/>the first time I&apos;ve tried it out and now you can hear some music, if you<br/>like. I&apos;ve made an almost improvised piece of music yesterday and I&apos;ve tried<br/>to retune it in various ways. I&apos;ve stored it all in a regular PKZip archive.<br/>There you&apos;ll find MIDI files and then some scales. The MIDI files starting<br/>their names with &quot;m&quot; contain the music from yesterday, the ones starting<br/>with &quot;c&quot; are just some chords, scales, and short harmonic cadences. The ones<br/>with a &quot;12&quot; in their names are in 12_EDO, the ones a &quot;ji&quot; in their names are<br/>5-limit JI versions retuned with &quot;euler.scl&quot;, the ones with &quot;jimin&quot; are<br/>retuned with &quot;mmswap.scl&quot; (5-limit JI with major and minor harmonies<br/>swapped), and the ones with &quot;odd&quot; are versions retuned with &quot;odd12.scl&quot; (I<br/>was inspired by the discussion on BP you were leading some weeks ago).</p><p>OK, here&apos;s the link:</p><p><a href="http://download.yousendit.com/98C497C2A711E1D9">http://download.yousendit.com/98C497C2A711E1D9</a></p><p>Petr</p><p>PS: Haresh, where did you find out about that?
