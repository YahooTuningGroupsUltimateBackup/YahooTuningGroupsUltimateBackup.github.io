I am looking to perform a piece in 12ET, that has<br/>&gt;&gt;the two manual of the harpsichord tuned a quarter-step different (lower I<br/>&gt;&gt;think).  I don&apos;t have any tuning equipment and have always tuned by ear,<br/>&gt;&gt;does anyone have any suggestions on how I should go about this.<br/>Well, here&apos;s the way I was taught to do it. Let&apos;s assume that you&apos;ve tuned<br/>the higher-pitched manual and can lay a decent equal temperament. I first<br/>tune one note, say a C or an A, on the lower-pitched instrument fo that the<br/>beats between it and the standard C are a bug&apos;s-ass quicker than the beats<br/>between it and the B. Then I tune one tempered octave on the lower-pitched<br/>instrument. Now for the ear test. On the lower instrument play an ascending<br/>pattern: C E flat, C sharp E, d f, etc., in other words, ascending minor<br/>thirds ascending chromatically.<br/>On the higher keyboard you simultaneously play _descending Major seconds<br/>ascending chromatically: D C, E flat D flat, E D, etc. If the two<br/>instruments are truly a aquartertone apart you shoule hear a harmonic<br/>interval that is 5 quartertones wide ascending by quartertones. I can&apos;t<br/>vouch for the _mathematical precision, but musically, you can really hear<br/>when that progression is consistent.<br/>As for ferreting out the 11th that Paul&apos;s talking about, I don&apos;t think I<br/>could do that by ear and anyway, could I really depend on the string&apos;s<br/>harmonics to be true enough to use that as my reference? Interesting idea,<br/>though.<br/>Here&apos;s Paul&apos;s comments again. &gt;<br/>&gt;How do you tune 12tET by ear? Assuming you can really do that accurately,<br/>&gt;the usual approach is to tune the quarter-tone flat F# to the 11th harmonic<br/>&gt;of the normal C three octaves lower (you&apos;ll only be 1 cent off true<br/>&gt;quartertones if you do this right).
