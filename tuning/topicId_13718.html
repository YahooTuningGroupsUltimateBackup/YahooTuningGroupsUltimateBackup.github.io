I&apos;ve started to fantasize about a 22tet guitar.</p><p> &gt;How does someone go about doing an etude in<br/> &gt;&apos;all EDOs from 5 to 53&apos;? Or working with<br/> &gt;a various just pitch sets with between 20<br/> &gt;and 40 pitches per octave?</p><p>        I don&apos;t.  My brains can&apos;t manage that just yet.</p><p> &gt;Building and/or tuning instruments<br/> &gt;and/or using tuning tables and seeing the<br/> &gt;&apos;12-of-N&apos; seems like an impossible<br/> &gt;way to get a clear enough aural image of<br/> &gt;your resources such that you can freely<br/> &gt;invent (imagine) the music you can make.</p><p>        Well, in some ways this is true.  However, my own feeble<br/>mental capabilities require some limit to the sonic palate or I<br/>quickly get overwhelmed.  It&apos;s also relevent that my own interest in<br/>microtonalism is due to an extensive exposure to Arabic and Turkish<br/>classical and pop music.  I tend to think in terms of modes, and I<br/>develop this modal thinking in a quite self-conscious way when I&apos;m<br/>playing with a tuning system I&apos;m wanting to turn into a song or five.<br/>Thus, &quot;The Divisions of the Tetrachord&quot; has been a constant companion<br/>for almost a year now.  Anyway, here&apos;s a rough outline of how I<br/>proceeded when I decided I wanted to add a little 11-flavor to what I<br/>was doing, mostly to get some of the neutral intervals so popular in<br/>middle-eastern and central-asian musics:</p><p>        First, I *started* with a system I had some previous exposure<br/>to, the so-called Centaur tuning you can find at the Anaphorian<br/>Embassy&apos;s web site (<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/centaur.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/centaur.html</a> - gifs).<br/>This is a nice 12-of-N mapping for people just starting to push<br/>themselves beyond the 5-limit into 7.  I still prefered to keep most<br/>of the tuning intact, again, to ease my way, so I fiddled with Db/C#<br/>until I got a nice netral second (several options are available) and<br/>then I built a major scale on top of that, which displaced F# and Ab.</p><p>        At this point I run off to my Python library boringly called<br/>Ratio (<a href="http://www.execpc.com/~wsannis/ratio.html">http://www.execpc.com/~wsannis/ratio.html</a>), and make use of<br/>some new features not yet made public.  First, I dump the 12-of-N<br/>tuning out into offset-from-12tet so I can go wrangle one of my<br/>software synths into the correct tuning.  Also, I have code which will<br/>print out a full table of all the inter-note ratios which can be<br/>enlightening and finally I run some routines which run through the<br/>system looking for known chords of 3 and 4 notes.  These get scribbled<br/>out on a notecard which is set up in my line of sight next to the<br/>monitor.  *The notecard is often ignored*!</p><p>        Once I get a synth retuned, I just start dorking around.  This<br/>may take weeks. :) However, I spend most of the initial time working<br/>out the melodic possibilities of a scale.  In particular I choose<br/>7-of-12 subsets for modes and work out cadential patterns I like and<br/>think sound convincing, certain note relationships I think are<br/>interesting and otherwise just try to internalize the possibilities of<br/>system.  Finally, I experiment with taking melodies and &quot;transposing&quot;<br/>them between different modes.  Sometimes this works, often it does<br/>not.</p><p>        Finally, I start playing more systematically with the harmonic<br/>possibilities of a system, especially the 7-of-12 systems.  This is<br/>where that notecard sometimes comes in handy, though of course I&apos;m<br/>perfectly happy to try things not on that card, as I discovered about<br/>a month ago when I discovered I accepted a wolf fifth as acceptable<br/>when used to build a &quot;major&quot; chord, or at least something much like<br/>one.  I tend to think more in terms of counterpoint, so I have this<br/>obsession in keeping the outer voices (bass and soprano) of<br/>multi-voice passages in whatever mode I&apos;ve chosen, though I&apos;ll let the<br/>middle voices go where they want to get strong harmonic patterns.  At<br/>this point there is going to be some serious tension between the<br/>melodic cadential (sp?) figures and the harmonic possibilities of a<br/>system.  For example, I really like to descend by a half-step (for<br/>various values of half-step) to the tonic of a mode.  Interesting,<br/>wild things happen as I try to make these two competing goals work<br/>together.</p><p>        Finally, I have various stylistic things to fall back on to<br/>help me organize what I&apos;m doing.  I&apos;m a huge fan of various forms of<br/>electronica... dance music basically, though a number of artists have<br/>moved well beyond anything remotely danceable.  So, I play with time<br/>varying timbre via filters a lot, which can have quite an impact on<br/>how a tuning is perceived for tolerably obvious reasons.  Also, I will<br/>adopt various Industrial tricks, in particular those of Haujobb/Daniel<br/>Myer who has this fascinating habit of taking small (4-8 bar)<br/>melodic/sound &quot;cells&quot; and playing them off each other as the song<br/>develops.  As has been noted elsewhere on this list, in particular by<br/>Margo Schulter, context is incredibly important.  I&apos;ve found this<br/>technique *very* productive and I end up with more adventurous<br/>harmonies that I would otherwise, since I tend to be fairly<br/>conservative in that regard when noodling around on an instrument.  So<br/>for me, composition is, with apologies to Edison, 2% inspiration and<br/>98% serendipity, a sonic voyage of discovery with my songs little<br/>intonational travelogs.</p><p>        I&apos;m not sure how helpful this is.  My main point is that I<br/>think that if you&apos;re just starting out in microtonality you should<br/>perhaps start with the 12-of-N sets just to get a handle on some basic<br/>realtionships first.  Some composers can handle huge pitch sets and<br/>can negotiate the quantum realm of the comma effectively, but I assume<br/>most of them have been at this a bit longer than me. :) However, I<br/>think the tuning charts and the text for Kyle Gann&apos;s music are also an<br/>instructive approach to choosing your pitches when you go beyond 12<br/>(<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/complist.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/complist.html</a>), in particular<br/><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/Custune2.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/Custune2.html</a>.  I&apos;m not ready to make<br/>that step yet, and may never given my own musical preferences.</p><p>--<br/>wm</p></div><h3>Paul H.

The keyboard layout I<br/>recommend in my paper (skipping the Es) maps two keyboard octaves to one<br/>acoustical octave, so I was really happy to get my 88-key controller, giving<br/>me just over 3 1/2 octaves. On my 7-string guitar, I have almost 4 1/2<br/>octaves. I can play a lot of chords on the guitar that I could never play on<br/>that keyboard mapping -- and vice versa. Nonetheless, both interfaces are<br/>very logical (to me) and it&apos;s not hard to find a lot of good ideas by just<br/>noodling around on either -- since it&apos;s an ET, any intervals you start an<br/>idea with will always be available from any given note, so extending ideas<br/>generally comes easily (unless you&apos;re tied to diatonic preconceptions of how<br/>chords will connect . . .).</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/28/2000 12:40:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, rmcgowan@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13743">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13743</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; How do YOU compose, or investigate a new set of<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning materials for composition or improvisation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve always been interested in this question, too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I use Scala (or hand-cranking) to do a full-keyboard tuning on the<br/>TX81Z (or whatever), then sit at a keyboard and improvise with it,<br/>trying out the different intervals and melodic steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I almost never tune in &quot;N of M&quot; -- for example, in 19 tET, I don&apos;t<br/>typically choose 12 of 19, I would tune all 19 notes.

Over at the other list, they are discussing rhythm/pitch relationships in<br/>composition to which I have added my tuppenceworth. My two basic premises have always been to<br/>simplify  resources and to learn from the past. I&apos;ve just resurrected one of my JI pieces<br/>called Just Vespers  which uses a very simple but beautiful mode, Ptolemy&apos;s Malakon Diatonic.<br/>This goes  1/1   21/20   7/6   4/3   3/2   63/40   7/4   2/1.  I used JI Calc to send it to my<br/>sampler, an ASR - 10.  I benefit from singing the scale as much as possible which is what I<br/>did for about a week.
