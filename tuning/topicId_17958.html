My involvement with new<br/>pianos has been only through reading and with my own instruments, to<br/>date of questionable conception (otherwise I work on old pianos). I<br/>think as these threads suggest it&apos;s not an immediate thing to make a<br/>good - no, I guess flawless design for a new piano, as it should be<br/>whether fixed or adaptive. If I&apos;m able, I plan to visit Patrick and<br/>Lewis at CNMI in late February also when I&apos;ll get some measurements from<br/>the unusual little antique grand piano I mentioned. I figure it&apos;s a<br/>great starting point, since I won&apos;t need a plate cast, also I&apos;ve spent<br/>the past year planning hopefully so I&apos;ll avoid some of the problems I&apos;ve<br/>run into with past projects.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.library.rncm.ac.uk/hwm12.htm#K">http://www.library.rncm.ac.uk/hwm12.htm#K</a> 16&gt;<br/>Robert Wornum &quot;Pocket Grand Pianoforte&quot;, 1836. This has a fixed tuning,<br/>six octaves of twelve keys each where the stringing scale is designed<br/>for equal tension, strongly implying 12tET. A bunch of clues, including<br/>a larger version (expanded compass!) suggest the whole design is<br/>generated from few parameters, yet what really distinguishes it from<br/>other wood framed grands is that it&apos;s built like an upright - backposts<br/>run uninterrupted the full length of the strings making a much stronger<br/>structure; to achieve this, it&apos;s kind of upside down with the strung<br/>portion hinged to a base/action bed along the spine. It&apos;s very pretty,<br/>besides.</p><p>Unfortunately, my friend Sy who would have helped greatly with Ed&apos;s<br/>muscle car unit of pedal steel research, died a couple days ago.</p><p>Clark</p></div><h3><a id=17960 href="#17960">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2001 12:54:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;<a href="http://www.lgu.ac.uk/mit/cnmi/">http://www.lgu.ac.uk/mit/cnmi/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Just went there; neat site!!
