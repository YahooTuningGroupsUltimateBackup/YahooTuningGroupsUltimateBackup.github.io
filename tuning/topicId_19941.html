And I do believe that if you<br/>can patent a chair with a bell attached to the side for<br/>use in calling your servants, you should definately be<br/>able to patent tunings which are a lot more work in terms<br/>of desigcn and cleverness. (The issue of whether *either*<br/>should be patentable is a different issue.)</p><p>Of course enforcing tuning patents nowadays might be<br/>well-nigh impossible, just as it was for patented chairs<br/>with bells  150 years ago. But doing so could be a helluva<br/>lot of fun from a vanity standpoint!!</p><p>And patents only last 17 years so the worst case scenario<br/>(meganational tuning consortiums having the force of law<br/>to tell us what we can and cannot compose) is not too<br/>bad.... {BEGIN OT] Although they are trying to increase<br/>this length dramatically by international treaty. Since<br/>international law that is ratified as a treaty is legally<br/>equivalent to a Constitutional Amendment in the US, this<br/>could be a serious problem in many areas. By to way, to be<br/>truly terrified by this whole treaty thing, go read the<br/>ratified GATT treaty then check out the policing,<br/>regulatory and legislative powers granted to the WTO --<br/>folks, this document supercedes the US Constitution<br/>because it is a treaty! The entire Bill of Rights has been<br/>nullified and it is only a matter of time before the US<br/>Supreme Court confirms that! Your Congressmen who passed<br/>this BS are traitors who should hanged if I wasn&apos;t a<br/>pacifist! [END OT]</p><p>Hey -- the May&nbsp;14,&nbsp;1996 / June&nbsp;30,&nbsp;1994 Yamaha patent on<br/>19 tone equal temperament (US5516981: &quot;Musical instrument<br/>tuned in nineteen note temperament scale&quot;) will run out in<br/>2013 so we can start using it then without licensing<br/>fees!!! (No kidding - they also patented the standard<br/>historical 19 note split key keyboard and put what could<br/>be a diagram of a 16th century instrument in their patent<br/>application as if no one had ever seen such a thing<br/>before!! Be sure to check out their patent claims on the<br/>19tET trumpet, flute and guitar!!!!)</p><p>- Jeff</p><p>Disclaimer: &quot;Although the above is true to the best of my<br/>knowledge and limited understanding, I am not a licensed<br/>attorney and none of this should be construed as legal<br/>advice. Consult an attorney before proceeding.&quot;</p><p>Appendix:</p><p>Don&apos;t worry friends, Yamaha will never be able to enforce<br/>their claim since their claim that there was no prior art<br/>can easily shown to be false.</p><p>And it is a really good thing that such a manufacturer of<br/>really great instruments (rather than musical toys) has an<br/>interest in alternative tunings.</p><p>However it is likely that all this means is that if any<br/>little guys try to resurrect the split key keyboard,<br/>they&apos;ll get their pants sued off by Yamaha. I just wish<br/>Yamaha would get off their butt and use their damn patent<br/>because I would start saving immediately to buy a cool<br/>19-tone split key MIDI keybord, especially if it had<br/>Yamaha&apos;s smooth and fast as a harpsichord key action<br/>combined with the ergonomically far superior Roland style<br/>lateral pitch bend lever...)</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/8/2001 11:51:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;J Scott&quot; &lt;xjscott@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/19958">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/19958</a></p><p>&gt; Hi Joseph!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Me:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; ...isn&apos;t it true that there is a patent<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; category for musical tunings?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Disclaimer: &quot;The above statements are only hypotheses.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Good one...
