The method is to mix a few tracks of my<br/>voice singing. As I&apos;ll probably make the layers in a &quot;destructive&quot; manner,<br/>I&apos;ll not be able to extract the individual parts. But nevertheless, luckyly,<br/>I&apos;ll still have the chance to listen to the already recorded parts while<br/>singing a new one. To get some interesting results out of it all, I thought<br/>it would be a good idea to approximate anything else than 12-EDO. I have<br/>already come with a few ideas of what tunings to choose; but anyway - do you<br/>have any ideas of what tuning you&apos;d like me to try to sing in? I&apos;ll collect<br/>as many ideas of yours as I can and I&apos;ll tell you how I got it finally. The<br/>recording should be ready at the begining of July, I believe.</p><p>Looking forward to the discussion.</p><p>Regards.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>mikal haley &#x3C;chipsterthehipster@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2007 9:48:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[ Attachment content not displayed ]</p></div><h3>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2007 10:41:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mikal wrote:</p><p>&gt; you might want to save the layers as you go.</p><p>Well, at this time, I&apos;m not sure what recording device I will have to use.<br/>But anyway I don&apos;t use software for recording. For some simpler musical<br/>ideas, I use an old-fashioned four-track tape recorder. For higher-quality<br/>music, I use an eight-track MD recorder. Either way, extracting the<br/>individual tracks would mean recording them one at a time from the MD or<br/>from the tape to the PC simply with analog means.</p><p>&gt; i would want to hear the construction and deconstruction process.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>mikal haley &#x3C;chipsterthehipster@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2007 11:32:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[ Attachment content not displayed ]</p></div>
