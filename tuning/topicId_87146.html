Once I knew a few chords and could fool around with the blues scale I had no desire to delve further into guitar playing. The maths behind music though caught my imagination and since 1995 I&apos;ve spent an average of at least six hours a day either at my computer programming or thinking about the maths behind music.</p><p>I know next to nothing about the prevalent theories of Just Intonation. I bought Doty&apos;s Primer a few years ago but to be honest I couldn&apos;t quite grasp a lot of the ideas there so I just ploughed on on my own.</p><p>As I said before, my system does not use or depend on prime numbers.</p><p>Since I first made contact with other members of the Just Intonation community (January of this year) I have learned a great deal more and my book will need some revising. At this point though, I still think my formulae have some merit and I also think that even if the formulae are wrong, my 12 key tuning system (NPT) is the best possible 12 key tuning system that has two different tonics of equal strength (1/1 and 3/2). One tonic works better for ascending music and the other for descending music, see chapter 7 of my book.</p><p>If you haven&apos;t done so already I would urge you to read chapters 4, 6 and 7 of my book and let me know what you think of my reasoning.</p><p>My formula for melody is 2/x + 2/y and (If I&apos;m right) any melodic interval with a value of 1.0 or higher is a Major melodic interval. So any interval 1/n will have a minimum value of 2.0, so yes, all 1/n intervals, in melody, should be strong.</p><p>John</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2010 4:18:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 2 April 2010 00:24, jfos777 &lt;jfos777@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Graham,</p><p>&gt; Since I first made contact with other members of the Just Intonation community (January of this year) I have learned a great deal more and my book will need some revising.

It depends on your<br/>own ranking of consonances, which you haven&apos;t cross checked with<br/>anybody else.  And once you have a ranking the formula&apos;s useless<br/>anyway.

It would be nice to have 7/4, but it&apos;s<br/>nicer to have 9/5.  Then the only question is why 15/14 and 7/5 are<br/>still in there because they don&apos;t work with anything else.  They don&apos;t<br/>even work with each other because the 7 comes in the numerator of one<br/>and the denominator of the other.

From this I deduced that there must be a mathematical formula for consonance that uses the numbers in the ratio. I *have* crossed checked the formula with John Chalmers whom I wrote to in January. He said: &quot;your consonance functions ... seem to reproduce qualitatively, at least, my subjective feelings about sensory consonance&quot;. He even went as far as to program my functions in BASIC to test them and seemed enthusiastic about them.</p><p>You said that once you have a ranking then the formula is useless anyway. It isn&apos;t, the formula is incorporated into my formula for identifying the strength values (and key notes) of chords.</p><p>You also said that I don&apos;t consider chords of more than 2 notes. I do, see chapter 10 &quot;Harmony &amp; Chords&quot;. I even have formulas for identifying the key chord of a group of chords and the &quot;progression&quot; value of two chords. I also have 5 classifications of chords which are based on my consonance formulas.</p><p>I also have a chapter on Melody and Scales which has some new ideas.</p><p>Chapter 14 deals with stretch tuning and is one of the more intriguing chapters if you want to take a look.</p><p>As regards the 12 keys per octave (and not more or less than 12) I said before that, on a guitar, if extra frets are included then a lot of barre chords would be harder to play. For me, 12 is the golden mean between simplicity and complexity. Also, for someone making the transition from 12 key Equal Temperament to my 12 key Natural Pan Tuning, the transition should be relatively simple.</p><p>You said:&quot;if you&apos;re going to exclude 4/7, why keep any 7s at all?&quot; Good question. I excluded 7/4 because it &quot;goes with&quot; very few other notes and 9/5 is more versatile and is almost as strong. I kept the 7/5 however because there is no other note between 4/3 and 3/2 that is more versatile (except perhaps 10/7 but 7/5 goes better with 1/1 than 10/7).</p><p>My convention of writing intervals x/y (where x&lt;=y) where the numerator is less than the denominator is clearly confusing. When I began I used this way of writing intervals because on a piano or guitar the lower notes are to the left and the higher notes are to the right. I didn&apos;t know that this was not the norm. For me 5/7 is the same as 7/5 when describing an interval (which may or may not contain the tonic, 1/1). When writing the pitches of a scale however then obviously the numerator should be higher than the denominator.</p><p>Leaving the 7/5 orphaned...Within an octave range going up and down, 7/5 &quot;goes with&quot;: 3/4, 4/5, 9/10, 1/1, 2/1, 12/5, 5/2 and 8/3. All these intervals have a &quot;harmony value&quot; of 0.75 or higher. That&apos;s nine intervals excluding the octaves and unison, not too bad.</p><p>You said &quot;Oh, wait, we do have 4/7 now? p.32&quot; Yes we do, but not among intervals that contain the tonic. 4/7 does occur a few times among some intervals that don&apos;t contain the tonic.</p><p>Yes Natural North is the same as Natural Pan.</p><p>Going up, 15/14 goes with: 3/2, 5/3, 15/8 and 2/1 and goes with a few other notes going down.</p><p>I use 15/14 instead of 16/15 because (i) some of the more unusual and exotic (not found in ET) intervals occur, (ii) 15/14 goes better (in melody) with 1/1 than 16/15 but (iii) most importantly, with 15/14, the notes between 1/1 and 1/2 (Natural North) are the mirror image of the notes between 3/2 and 3/1 (Natural South). 1/1 and 3/2 are both tonics. So you have two strong temperaments of equal strength (both contained in one system) and one is the inverse of the other (herein lies the symmetry). As I said, one temperament is better for ascending music and the other for descending music.</p><p>Melody? again, see my chapter on melody and scales.</p><p>Thanks for the elaborate and considered reply,</p><p>John.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 2 April 2010 00:24, jfos777 &lt;jfos777@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Graham,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Since I first made contact with other members of the Just Intonation community (January of this year) I have learned a great deal more and my book will need some revising.

It&apos;s<br/>easy to optimize the frets for the easiest chords.  The point of barre<br/>chords is that you can play them anywhere on the neck, which is always<br/>a problem with an unequal fretting.  To get all chords working, you&apos;re<br/>looking at circular temperaments, which there&apos;s a lot of history of.</p><p>&gt; You said:&quot;if you&apos;re going to exclude 4/7, why keep any 7s at all?&quot;<br/>&gt; Good question.

But, fair enough, I think that 7/5 gives you a<br/>full 4:5:6:7:8:9 chord, but with the tonic as 5 instead of 4.  So it<br/>earns its keep as long as you don&apos;t care about modulation.</p><p>&gt; Going up, 15/14 goes with: 3/2, 5/3, 15/8 and 2/1 and goes with a<br/>&gt; few other notes going down.</p><p>These would give &quot;utonal&quot; chords.  The whole chord written as<br/>frequency numbers doesn&apos;t look simple, so I think it&apos;d score badly by<br/>your formulas.</p><p>&gt; I use 15/14 instead of 16/15 because (i) some of the more<br/>&gt; unusual and exotic (not found in ET) intervals occur,<br/>&gt; (ii) 15/14 goes better (in melody) with 1/1 than 16/15 but<br/>&gt; (iii) most importantly, with 15/14, the notes between 1/1 and 1/2<br/>&gt; (Natural North) are the mirror image of the notes between<br/>&gt; 3/2 and 3/1 (Natural South). 1/1 and 3/2 are both tonics.<br/>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>Sure, but why care about this &quot;mirror image&quot; business when chords<br/>don&apos;t follow it, and you don&apos;t get any modulation?
