(Maybe it was in 2.04,<br/>too, and I never used it... :)</p><p>There are some other changes in the text to amplify and/or clarify:</p><p>_______________<br/>SCALA FOR DUMMIES</p><p>Hi Wally,</p><p>Well, let&apos;s get started.  Being a &quot;dummy&quot; myself, I am eminently<br/>suited to writing the SCALA &quot;dummies&quot; article.  Who else is going to<br/>do it??  (Not Manuel, that&apos;s for sureÂ… :) [Manuel, this is a joke;<br/>please feel free to &quot;correct&quot; anything I do hereÂ…]</p><p>I&apos;m presuming you&apos;ve downloaded and installed the software.</p><p>It&apos;s here:</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/downloads.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/downloads.html</a></p><p>Good job! (If that&apos;s not the case, please contact me offlistÂ… I also<br/>apologize to some of the old-time tuners for this rudimentary SCALA<br/>info, but maybe it will be of help to somebody else just &quot;lurkingÂ…&quot;)</p><p>You also should download the SCALA tuning files, which are also on<br/>that page.  SCALA is very easy to install, since Manuel has a<br/>new &quot;routine&quot; that does it pretty easily.  You don&apos;t even have to<br/>reboot!  How&apos;s that for a good start!</p><p>Anyway, once SCALA 2.5 is up and running, you need to know some very<br/>basic commands.  You can try the so called tutorial by typing in<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/tutorial">@tutorial</a>, and follow along with that, but if you are as stupid as I<br/>am, you&apos;ll only understand part of that.</p><p>How about trying some elementary SCALA commends, just so we can get<br/>this thing to start working:</p><p>First type in  DIR into the little box at the bottom.  You guessed<br/>it!  That will show you the directory of files that is in the root<br/>directory.  Just like in old DOS, you can type in CD also to change<br/>directories.  Let&apos;s just for now save everything in the root<br/>directory for starters.</p><p>Once you type DIR, you will see a very few sample files in the root.<br/>One is called ptolemy.scl!  Guess what!  This is a just<br/>scale.  &quot;Just&quot; what you&apos;re looking for!</p><p>Type in the little box at the bottom:  LOAD PTOLEMY.SCL.  That&apos;s how,<br/>obviously, you get the scale in there!!!  It says now &quot;Intense<br/>Diatonic&quot; so we know we&apos;re on the right track.</p><p>However, in order to see anything, you have to type another command<br/>in the bottom box:</p><p>SHOW</p><p>Try it!  You&apos;ll like it!  What you see now is the just ratios, their<br/>equivalents in cents, and their interval name, according to Manuel&apos;s<br/>ingenious interval naming system.</p><p>That&apos;s quite a bit right there for analysis.</p><p>However, if like some, you stress the &quot;anal&quot; in your &quot;analysis&quot;<br/>please type in:</p><p>SHOW DATA</p><p>Whoaboy!  I told you that was dangerous.  HOWEVER, the more you look<br/>at it, the more sense it will make.  Stuff like number of intervals,<br/>most common intervals.  I guarantee there is absolutely nothing more<br/>you will ever want to know about this scale.  This is indeed &quot;all the<br/>things you wanted to know about Scale but were afraid to ask!&quot;</p><p>OK, bro, we have now loaded in a scale and analyzed it.  With the new<br/>developments in SCALA  2.5 we can even HEAR it!  You don&apos;t even have<br/>to have MIDI set up, you can use your sound card!</p><p>Type SHOW again, just so we can get back the basic scale:</p><p>Now take your mouse and click on ANALYZE at the very top of the SCALA<br/>menu.  You will see something called &quot;Chromatic Clavier.&quot;  Click it<br/>on, and there is your scale!  You have to set the NOTATION down below<br/>to make sure it makes sense for your scale, but once you have done<br/>that, you have the scale right in front of you for playing!!!  You<br/>can just use your mouse to play the pitches!</p><p>If you want triads or chords, just hold down your SHIFT key!  What a<br/>tool, man! (Hit the space bar to silence the notes).  Note that you<br/>can view and play more than one octave of the scale, if you choose.<br/>For just scales, you can also play a &quot;tonality diamond&quot; as a menu<br/>selection from the &quot;Analyze&quot; toolbar.</p><p>OKÂ… now lets assume you have a MIDI keyboard set up to your<br/>computer.  Lucky guy!  I bought mine used, too.</p><p>At the menu at top, use your mouse and go TOOLS, RELAY MIDI, and set<br/>it to RELAYING ON.</p><p>Now you can just sit at your MIDI keyboard and play the scale and<br/>various chords.  It&apos;s all you need for an aural analysis.</p><p>Now, you mentioned that you were interested in creating your own<br/>scales to work with.  Not such an outlandish conception, since that&apos;s<br/>why most of us are doing this.</p><p>What you need to know is the SCALA command:</p><p>INPUT</p><p>Try it.  First of all, it asks you the number of notes in your<br/>scale.  Well, how many do you have?</p><p>Then just start entering in ratios in the typical fashion n/n.<br/>When you&apos;re finished, type in, logically SHOW again, and there is<br/>your completed scale.  Then you can play it with the chromatic<br/>clavier or, even better, with your MIDI keyboard to your heart&apos;s<br/>content!</p><p>Now here is an important point to remember:</p><p>If you want a ratio just type in a number.  If you type in just 386,<br/>for example, it will become the ratio 386/1!</p><p>However, if what you really meant was the cents value, you must use a<br/>decimal point:  386.. (I actually have a decimal point there, before<br/>the period)</p><p>Then, SCALA will recognize that as an &quot;irrational&quot; or tempered value,<br/>if it happens to be that.</p><p>You can MIX both kinds of input data, ratios and tempered values,<br/>just by including that little decimal point at the end of the<br/>irrational ones.</p><p>Don&apos;t forget to save your work.</p><p>Type SAVE and give your SCALA file a name.  The program adds the .scl<br/>extension automatically.</p><p>The traditional older SCALA DOS program had several commands<br/>to &quot;adjust&quot; a given scale, such as INSERT and REPLACE, to insert or<br/>replace pitches in your scale.  You can still use those by typing in<br/>the little command line box at the bottom (yes, the box we&apos;ve been<br/>typing in up to now). However, Manuel has a new graphic edit feature<br/>(choose edit with your mouse from the big toolbar at top of SCALA).<br/>In this new edit screen you can change the pitches of your scale,<br/>adding, replacing, whatever, and actually hear the changes in the<br/>scale.  What an enhancement!</p><p>Now lets clear your screen, so we can have more fun:</p><p>Type CLS</p><p>Although I know you aren&apos;t specifically interested in this, I will<br/>show you how to easily create an equal-tempered scale.  Easy.</p><p>Let&apos;s say we want 72 equal:</p><p>Type in the little box at the bottom:</p><p>EQUAL 72</p><p>Voila!  That&apos;s all there is to it.  Don&apos;t forget to type in SHOW or<br/>you won&apos;t see anything!!!</p><p>Once you press return a few time so you get the entire scale, you can<br/>go to  ANALYZE at the top menu and play the &quot;Chromatic Klavier.&quot;<br/>Isn&apos;t 72 fun!  It&apos;s the best scale in the world (biased value<br/>judgment hereÂ…)</p><p>Ok, while you&apos;re at it, try the TRIAD PLAYER in the same menu.  Wow!<br/>What have they been smoking in the Netherlands??!</p><p>Now I would like to do a little exercise in loading in, analyzing and<br/>copying the text of SCALA files.  After all, Manuel has accumulated a<br/>million scale files, and it&apos;s well worth it to take a look at some of<br/>the scales that other people have created before you!</p><p>In order to implement this, it&apos;s best to use the little included<br/>routine that Robert Walker added to SCALA.  Robert Walker&apos;s<br/>additional code is now part of the SCALA program. You are welcome to<br/>try to load in a scale on an IBM computer by simply going FILE OPEN<br/>by using your mouse at the top of the screen.</p><p>Sounds logical, yes?  However, I wouldn&apos;t recommend that!  :) Why?<br/>Well, Manuel has created this program using UNIX code, and the<br/>opening function is supposed to work across several platforms.  As a<br/>result, it doesn&apos;t work very well in the IBM platform.  Try it, and<br/>you&apos;ll see.</p><p>Instead, type the following into the little box at the bottom:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OPEN">@OPEN</a></p><p>Robert Walker wrote this.  You will see it open a little Windows<br/>dialogue box that will let you choose your file.  This is the best<br/>way with an IBM.</p><p>However, there is one more step.  You must type:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/O">@O</a>  in the SCALA box at the bottom (That&apos;s an ohhh, not a zero) after<br/>you have selected your scale in the dialogue box.</p><p>Then don&apos;t forget to type SHOW or you won&apos;t see anything.</p><p>Now you have opened and loaded in a scale, and you can analyze it<br/>using SHOW, or in incredible detail, using SHOW DATA.</p><p>If you want to save your window text, so you can view it in a text<br/>editor or wordprocessor, you can use another routine written for<br/>SCALA by Robert Walker (also now part of the program).</p><p>First enter</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/C">@C</a></p><p>in the SCALA command-line box at bottom.</p><p>Then enter</p><p>SHOW, so there&apos;s something that will be copied.</p><p>Finally, enter in</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/COPY">@COPY</a></p><p>Now, the text with your tuning information is in your Windows<br/>clipboard, so all you have to do is go EDIT PASTE (or Ctrl-V) to<br/>paste it into MS Word, the Tuning List postings, or whatever.</p><p>Of course, once you have your scale opened and analyzed, you can hear<br/>it right away, chords and everything using Manuel&apos;s new MIDI-<br/>interactive features.</p><p>Well, this is the basic tour.  There are many other wonderful and<br/>detailed things that SCALA can do, which you&apos;ll see if you browse in<br/>the HELP file that comes up if you click on HELP in the top SCALA<br/>menu.</p><p>Keep in mind that you can also tune external synths by setting the<br/>synthesizer type and sending a MIDI tuning file to the synth tables<br/>or by playing the tuning file into the synth tables using a<br/>sequencer.  I do that with my TX81Zs all the time, and that is,<br/>frankly, my basic microtonal composing tool.</p><p>Between Manuel, myself and other people on this list, you should have<br/>all the answers you need.  It might take a little while for some<br/>responses, but probably you won&apos;t have to wait too long.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=39178 href="#39178">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>10/2/2002 4:27:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph, thanks for your eloquent contribution.

Try it, and<br/>&gt;you&apos;ll see.</p><p>Actually I&apos;ve done quite some work on the open file dialog since<br/>you first tried it. And to make up for the absent Windows look and<br/>feel, I&apos;ve added advanced features that the Windows one doesn&apos;t have.<br/>For example, type Ctrl-O to open the dialog, then type &quot;pt&quot; in<br/>front of the file name box, so that it says &quot;pt*.scl&quot;.<br/>Then hit the Tab key. The filename is now complete. You only need<br/>to hit Enter to open it. Or if it&apos;s not the right file, then<br/>the list has been shortened to only show the files beginning<br/>with &quot;pt&quot;.<br/>Another feature: if you click on the file list to move the focus<br/>to it, and then press some letter key, the first filename beginning<br/>with that letter will be selected. You can then use the cursor keys<br/>to move up and down.<br/>Perhaps the biggest advantage is to be able to see the description<br/>without opening the file.<br/>It&apos;s also considerably faster than the Windows dialog now.</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
