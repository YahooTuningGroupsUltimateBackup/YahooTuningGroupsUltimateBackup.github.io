Subramaniam; shruti, by Alain Danielou, Swami<br/>Prajnananda and several others.  It is a question of how we prefer to<br/>represent the Sanskrit sound, as in the English word &quot;shrewd&quot;, for<br/>transliteration into the Roman alphabet.</p><p>Definitions: Lack of standardisation is the hallmark of Sanskrit<br/>terms.  Shruti has been variously translated as: microtone,<br/>microtonic interval, interval, step etc. It is mainly determined<br/>through fine auditory perception or grasp.  The number of sounds<br/>falling within a scale is infinite; but the number which can be<br/>differntiated (or perceived, or grasped) as musically useful, is 22.<br/>These 22 shruti-s are further grouped into five classes, bringing in<br/>the aesthetic concept that a shruti is not only an auditory<br/>perception, but also a distinct expression to the listener&apos;s mind.<br/>There is a broad agreement that shruti-s are not equal; that the<br/>seven notes are the sounds selected from among these 22 shruti-s;<br/>that each note is established on its first shruti; that shruti-s can<br/>be reproduced on a string instrument, in terms of various vibrating<br/>lengths; that shruti-s can, therefore, be stated in terms of<br/>frequencies, though Indian music, being truly modal, is built on the<br/>relationship of sounds with the tonic (also called the reference<br/>note, key etc.).<br/>References: The earliest mention appears to have been made in Bharat<br/>muni&apos;s Natyashastra (about 500 B.C.).  Later references include<br/>Narada of Shiksha (1st century A.D.), Kohala (quoted in Brihaddeshi)<br/>Dattila&apos;s Brihaddeshi, and several later works.</p><p>Remarks: Shruti is a part of tonal concept.  Talented singers use<br/>shruti-s, regularly and unknowingly, as part of their musical<br/>repertoire.  Quite often, even the raga-s have their notes<br/>established on shruit-s, rather than the usual notes.  For example,<br/>the &quot;komal Re&quot; (Db, if C is the tonic) of the raga Todi, is really a<br/>microtone, lower than the usual location of &quot;komal Re&quot; on the Indian<br/>scale.  Even the singers of a capella, use the notes of the harmonic<br/>scale, not the notes of the tempered scale; this is because of<br/>absence of accompaniment on piano or any instrument with fixed,<br/>tempered scale.  So, singing correct microtones comes naturally to<br/>the voice of a talented singer.</p><p>Haresh BAKSHI &lt;<a href="mailto:hareshbakshi@hotmail.com">hareshbakshi@hotmail.com</a>&gt;</p><p>----------------------------<br/>Haresh BAKSHI<br/><a href="http://www.SoundOfIndia.com">www.SoundOfIndia.com</a><br/>4771 Silverberry LN NW<br/>ACWORTH  GA  30102-3559  USA<br/>Tel: (678) 354-4678<br/>-----------------------------</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/24/2000 5:11:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, hareshbakshi@h... wrote:</p><p>&gt; For example,<br/>&gt; the &quot;komal Re&quot; (Db, if C is the tonic) of the raga Todi, is really<br/>a<br/>&gt; microtone, lower than the usual location of &quot;komal Re&quot; on the<br/>Indian<br/>&gt; scale.</p><p>According to the usual (Wilson, Ramanthan, etc.) 5-limit<br/>specification of the srutis, which can be seen as a 22-tone<br/>periodicity block<br/>(<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/srutipblock.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/srutipblock.htm</a>), Todi That<br/>would be</p><p>1/1 256/243 32/27 45/32 3/2 128/81 243/128 1/1</p><p>while the usual &quot;komal Re&quot; is usually given as 16/15 or a tempered<br/>tone between 16/15 and 135/128, rather than 256/243.</p><p>Is this what you are referring to?</p><p>I am curious as to how this specification of Todi comes about -- I am<br/>skeptical as to an acoustical derivation, since on a lattice of<br/>consonances it would be highly disconnected, while a stricly<br/>Pythagorean derivation of this and other Thats would fail to account<br/>for the presence of 45/32, unless this is taken as a schismatic<br/>shorthand for 1024/729 (which would mean that an interval of 10<br/>srutis was being used to approximate a consonant one of 9<br/>srutis) . . . ?</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>12/26/2000 3:10:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Haresh BAKSHI wrote:</p><p>&gt; The spelling:  sruti (the first letter &quot;s&quot; as the diacritical Roman<br/>&gt; symbol) has been used by Sir Monier-Williams, Walter Kaufmann, Ashok<br/>&gt; Da Ranade, L.

I am sure more and more Indian musicians will try<br/>to appreciate, and even adopt -- as I am trying to do -- this<br/>methodology to get more gleanings from this vast subject.</p><p>From your response to my posting, it appears to me that I have<br/>created confusion by writing about the &quot;lower Re in Todi&quot; etc.  I<br/>should have mentioned that I was referring to the RAGA Todi, not<br/>the &quot;thaat&quot; Todi.  A &quot;thaat&quot; is a scale, the 7-note ladder.  We have<br/>10 thaat-s.  With the note C as the tonic, they are, in natural scale<br/>(not tempered scale): Names: Bilawal, C-D-E-F-G-A-B; Khamaj, C-D-E-F-<br/>G-A-Bb; Bhairav, C-Db-E-F-G-Ab-B; Kafi, C-D-Eb-F-G-A-Bb; Asavari, C-D-<br/>Eb-F-G-Ab-Bb; Bhairavi, C-Db-Eb-F-G-Ab-Bb; Kalyan, C-D-E-F#-G-A-B;<br/>Marwa, C-Db-E-F#-G-A-B; Poorvi, C-Db-E-F#-G-Ab-B; Todi, C-Db-Eb-F#-G-<br/>Ab-B.  The thaat-s are the raw material from which raga-s are<br/>formed.  The thaat-s are bereft of any aesthetic value by themselves;<br/>they are NEVER performed on the stage.  Now, it so happens that we<br/>have raga-s which have the same names as the thaat-s.  Thus to a<br/>performing Indian musician like me, &quot;Todi&quot; refers to the raga Todi,<br/>NOT the thaat Todi.  This is how I confused one with the other.  I<br/>apologize, and stand corrected.  So, then, what is a raga?  Let me<br/>recapitulate some basic tenets:</p><p>The concept associated with the term&quot; raga&quot; is highly developed and<br/>complex.  It defies any definition or description. We can, at best,<br/>enumerate some of the characteristics of the raga.  Even then its<br/>concept eludes us.  The only way to grasp the concept of the raga is<br/>to listen to its development over prolonged periods of time and<br/>repeatedly.  It is like learning a new language:  However enjoyable,<br/>it requires consistent and continuous effort.  Let us take up some of<br/>the characteristics of the raga:<br/>1.  The raga must be aesthetically pleasing.  It must delight the<br/>heart of the listener.  It must be capable of existing in its own<br/>right, as an individual entity, with unique aesthetical value.<br/>2.  The development of a raga is. in principle, constant attainment<br/>of aesthetic tensions, followed by resolutions, through various<br/>degrees of sonance (consonance and dissonance).  This is achieved by<br/>the use of the permissible notes, singly or in combination, through<br/>the movements in three octaves.  This is, of course, all, and only,<br/>improvisation.  There are regulations that govern these movements.<br/>3.  Basically, a raga is capable of being developed into an infinite<br/>number of melodic patterns, following certain guidelines.<br/>4. A raga should be capable of being classified into one of the thaat-<br/>s.<br/>5. A raga cannot be formed out of less than 5 notes.  &quot;Sa&quot; [C] has to<br/>be present as the reference note.  Both &quot;Ma&quot; (the fourth) and &quot;Pa&quot;<br/>(the fifth) cannot be simultaneously omitted from the raga.  So, it<br/>must have the following notes: SA; one of the Re [D] or Ga [E]; Ma<br/>[F] or Pa [G]; one of the Dha [A] or Ni [B], Further, if only one of<br/>the Ma/Pa is present, the raga must include either both Re and Ga, or<br/>both Dha and Ni, so as to achieve a total of 5 notes.<br/>5. It cannot include two states [out of the three possible states:<br/>shuddha (natural), komala (flat), and teevra (sharp)] of same note<br/>consecutively.<br/>6.  The raga must follow the time theory.  This means that a raga can<br/>be performed only at its stipulated time of the day (or night, or a<br/>season of the year).  And so on and on..........</p><p>Coming back to the point.  It would appear to me, that this forum<br/>chiefly concerns itself with tuning and temperament (as its name,<br/>obviously, suggests).  This would involve treatment of microtones and<br/>thaat-s, but definitely, not raga-s.  Is this correct? I want to know<br/>the the line of demarkation.</p><p>Even if it is so, it does not in any way make it less important for<br/>Indian music.  Since time immemorial, hair-splitting has been<br/>Indians&apos; national pastime -- especially the never-ending and futile<br/>type.  It is time for  more and more Indian musicians to get thorough<br/>exposure to new ideas and new methodologies of research.  By the way,<br/>do I have here the dubious distinction of being the only Indian<br/>musician on the Tuning list? -- I hope not.</p><p>In the next posting,  I hope to give a summary of &quot;standard Indian<br/>text-book type&quot; treatment of the subject of shruti.<br/>With regards,</p><p>Haresh BAKSHI<br/><a href="http://www.SoundOfIndia.com">www.SoundOfIndia.com</a><br/>Acworth  GA  30102-3559</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2001 8:17:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, hareshbakshi@h... wrote:</p><p>&gt; In the next posting,  I hope to give a summary of &quot;standard Indian<br/>&gt; text-book type&quot; treatment of the subject of shruti.</p><p>I&apos;m looking forward to it, and I hope it gives more insight into my question than the various books<br/>I&apos;ve seen (such as those named in the footnotes of my paper).</p></div><h3>hareshbakshi@hotmail.com</h3><span>1/20/2001 11:51:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, graham@m... wrote:<br/>&gt; Haresh BAKSHI wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The spelling:  sruti (the first letter &quot;s&quot; as the diacritical<br/>Roman<br/>&gt; &gt; symbol) has been used by Sir Monier-Williams, Walter Kaufmann,<br/>Ashok<br/>&gt; &gt; Da Ranade, L.

Hindi does not have provision for the dual form -- we have<br/>to use the plural form instead.  India has 20 major languages and 500<br/>dialects.  Most of those have their roots in Sanskrit.  I can travel<br/>less than 300 miles and reach another state whose popular language I<br/>do not know.  Hindi and English are the common &quot;bridges&quot; for people<br/>in 25 different states, each with its own language. The people in the<br/>villages use the regional dialect mostly.
