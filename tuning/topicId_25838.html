By the way,<br/>it was George Z. who wrote originally, I must say that I&apos;ve liked the<br/>mp3&apos;s &apos;n&apos; stuff he&apos;s posted quite a bit, actually. . .</p><p>&gt;&gt; I try to keep abreast of different musical communities--computer<br/>&gt;&gt; music, tuning, serial modernism, folk-rock-singer-songwriter<br/>&gt;&gt; people,  etc. etc.<br/>&gt;&gt;[snip]<br/>&gt;&gt; And yet they all use mathematical description to talk and think<br/>&gt;&gt; about what they&apos;re doing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t agree with that last statement in the least. All? All with<br/>&gt;great world musics, from many cultures, discussing their music in<br/>&gt;mathematical terms? Great music from non-professionals? Folk musics?</p><p>I think so.  What I was trying to say was that any time you&apos;re keeping<br/>track of a beat, rhythmic patterns, or what scale-note you&apos;re singing, or<br/>any number of seemingly simple musical tasks, I&apos;m sure at least some of<br/>these are thought of in a way that we would call &quot;mathematical&quot;, even in<br/>the most non-professional remotely located folk musician.  And if these<br/>simple tasks, than probably some more complex ones as well.</p><p>So that it seems that if one attacks &quot;talking about math&quot; in music, one is<br/>really attacking simply &quot;talking about new math,&quot; which, because it is<br/>unfamiliar, naturally is discussed more than &quot;math&quot; that we know<br/>well, like how to count or conduct in 4/4, and so on.  Hence 4/4, or<br/>7-scale degrees, or what-not, is labeled &quot;intuition&quot; or &quot;gut&quot;<br/>But, just like 4/4, any new idea, which may appear at first as an<br/>emotionless page of number-charts, might eventually be learned and become<br/>part of our intuition, and acquire emotional significances, and so on.</p><p>(I remember when I was a kid, and scores looked like so many shopping<br/>carts.  though I wondered why some of them had 4 pairs of wheels.)</p><p>&gt;I think the converse point is not about escaping. Where to you,<br/>&gt;George appears to want to &quot;escape&quot; from the tyranny of the numbers,<br/>&gt;I&apos;d hazard a guess that to him and others, many people actively<br/>&gt;*hide* under a blanket of theorems, postulates, and measurements,<br/>&gt;hoping that being able to prove the piece of music will make it<br/>&gt;worthy.</p><p>Yah, I agree with that.  I guess it seems like here we are, in the year<br/>2001:  Most of the music-world agrees with the fact that a piece is not<br/>&quot;proven&quot; to be good by it&apos;s methodologies, techniques, or generative<br/>scales, rows or what-not.  So I was kind of assuming that as a common<br/>opinion.</p><p>On the other hand, some (maybe even a lot of) music that moves me WAS<br/>composed under some wacky, often extremely elaborately worked out, often<br/>artificially constructed, discipline.  I&apos;m not saying the work is great<br/>because of the discipline itself, but because of the combination of the<br/>discipline AND the innate musical sensibility, and expressive sensibility<br/>of the composer(s).  Xenakis is a good example.</p><p>Because of these historical precedents, which sometimes consisted of<br/>&quot;systems&quot; or &quot;techniques&quot; that took years to work out (the tuning list<br/>itself is less than 10 yrs old, no?), and yet eventually bore fruit in<br/>some cool music, I&apos;m uncomfortable in knocking those who are nerding out<br/>generating new materials, which at first blush seem to have little to do<br/>with solid musical results.</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/29/2001 6:05:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sorry for any condescention in my previous post. . .</p><p>I&apos;m sure it wasn&apos;t intended, but everyone is very sensitive these<br/>days; likewise, I hope people will point out if I&apos;ve stepped on toes<br/>or over the line.</p><p>&gt; So that it seems that if one attacks &quot;talking about math&quot; in music,<br/>&gt; one is really attacking simply &quot;talking about new math,&quot; which,<br/>&gt; because it is unfamiliar, naturally is discussed more than &quot;math&quot;<br/>&gt; that we know well, like how to count or conduct in 4/4, and so on.</p><p>This, with your illustration that followed, is a very good point. It<br/>may be that once a mathematical or numerical structure becomes so<br/>ingrained as to be &apos;un-talked-about&apos;, such as a simple 3/4 meter, it<br/>becomes transparent and essentially _not_there_. When I referred to<br/>world musics and similar, this is mainly how I see it, and while<br/>there is much Balkan and eastern European music that is rhythmically<br/>quite complex, I can&apos;t picture at any point in it&apos;s development<br/>musicians sitting around and rumminating on the time signatures the<br/>wat that numerical information is debated here.</p><p>It may be just degrees of all of these items that we are talking<br/>about; I can certainly understand GZ&apos;s not wanting to bath in the<br/>numbers, and I do believe that a lot of music has been made far more<br/>intuitively than what comes down around here.</p><p>That said, what comes down around here is different, and is (for<br/>those who are interested) fine in these respects.</p><p>&gt; But, just like 4/4, any new idea, which may appear at first as an<br/>&gt; emotionless page of number-charts, might eventually be learned and<br/>&gt; become part of our intuition, and acquire emotional significances,<br/>&gt; and so on.</p><p>I agree to the possibility. I also believe that much music can be<br/>made, not ignorant of these qualities (where the term &quot;ignorance&quot; is<br/>applied negatively) but unaware. Or even uncaring.</p><p>&gt; Most of the music-world agrees with the fact that a piece is not<br/>&gt; &quot;proven&quot; to be good by it&apos;s methodologies, techniques, or generative<br/>&gt; scales, rows or what-not.  So I was kind of assuming that as a<br/>&gt; common opinion.</p><p>Curious! That actually makes me feel better, because I still get the<br/>feeling around here that a lot of stuff has to pass a final exam<br/>before it gets taken seriously...</p><p>&gt; Xenakis is a good example.</p><p>Xenakis is a *great* example. But I confess that, unlike a lot of<br/>other musics, I must take his in small batches. Which maybe is fine,<br/>too.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m uncomfortable in knocking those who are nerding out<br/>&gt; generating new materials, which at first blush seem to have little<br/>&gt; to do with solid musical results.</p><p>Yep, yep, yep. And while I&apos;m completely with you on that, I want<br/>those &quot;nerding out&quot; people to respect the serious and committed music<br/>of people that don&apos;t proceed in a like manner, but find inspiration<br/>and ingredients from less measurable elements.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>P.S. What was with the subject line?</p></div>
