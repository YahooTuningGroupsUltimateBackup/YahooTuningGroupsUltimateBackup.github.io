Just sampling the Chromeldeon or retuning a<br/>pre-set &quot;reed organ&quot; sample is not going to be an adequate replacement for<br/>one of Partch&apos;s organs. In particular, the swell levers are extremely<br/>difficult to replace, and Partch&apos;s scoring uses the swells, octave stops,<br/>and the low-pressure sounds of large (keyboard-chromatic) clusters at<br/>essential moments.</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &lt;<a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Saturday, July 01, 2000 11:46 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Partch and the Chromelodeon</p><p>&gt; Somehow the &quot;authenticity&quot; issue is challenged once again with the<br/>following<br/>&gt; by Harry Partch in the Enclosures series (p.120 from a letter by Partch to<br/>&gt; Lucie and Larry Marshall).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; December 23, 1949 -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;With the steam heat and thermostats of Madison I managed to keep the<br/>&gt; Chromelodeon in pretty good tune 8 months of the year.  Here, it is almost<br/>&gt; heartbreaking.  If I could tune it at one temperature then at least I<br/>could<br/>&gt; profit by experience.  But it takes seven days working about ten hours a<br/>day<br/>&gt; (this time--and I actually hurried), so even that is impossible.  Which<br/>&gt; reinforces the need either for an electronic tone or a reed made out of<br/>some<br/>&gt; alloy less susceptible to temperature changes than brass?  Are you<br/>beginning<br/>&gt; to see why I become so aggravated when anyone suggests that I devote my<br/>&gt; lifetime to the parthenogenetical dropping of strange musical<br/>instruments?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Elsewhere Partch describes the chromelodeon as &quot;unmusical&quot; and swears it<br/>off<br/>&gt; for future compositions.
