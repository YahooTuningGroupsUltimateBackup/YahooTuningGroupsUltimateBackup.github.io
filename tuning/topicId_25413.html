In the examples I gave, it has a size<br/>between around 15 cents and 27 cents.</p><p>This interpretation does leave us with the complication that this<br/>interval will sometimes be closer to 1/12 tone, and sometimes to 1/6<br/>tone. However, the &quot;smallest interval&quot; theme may provide at least some<br/>common meaning.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
