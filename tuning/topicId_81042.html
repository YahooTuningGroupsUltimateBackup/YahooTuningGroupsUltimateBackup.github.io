(this is not what I wish to discuss here now)<br/>&gt; But the 7th harmonic is still a little bit open, though I&apos;m allmost &gt; ready to see the 7th as an overtone only and not part of the &gt; musical structure.<br/>&gt; So without getting into higher harmonics, can anybody give me a &gt; musical JI example of the 7th harmonic?<br/>&gt; Preferably 2 chords played one after another of which 1 contains &gt; the 7th, preferably linked to a key/mode.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Up till now I had a little bit of hope for 8/5 2/1 12/5 14/5 -&gt; 3/2 &gt; 15/8 9/8 3/1<br/>&gt; But everywhich way I look it looks like it should be 8/5 2/1 12/5 &gt; 45/16 -&gt; 3/2 15/8 9/8 3/1<br/>&gt; Transposed down by 3/2 it is: 16/15 4/3 8/5 15/8 -&gt; 1/1 5/4 3/2 2/1<br/>&gt; Making the 7th chord 1/1 5/4 3/2 225/128<br/>&gt; Mode is what I call an extended mode. 1/1 16/15 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 &gt; 15/8 2/1 (subset)<br/>&gt; Which is made up of 2 of either the following base modes one &gt; transposed by 4/3:<br/>&gt; harmonic minor: 1/1 9/8 6/5 4/3 3/2 8/5 15/8 2/1<br/>&gt; and/or: 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 15/8 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Other examples I&apos;ve confirmed of not beeing the 7th harmonic are:<br/>&gt; 3/2 15/8 9/8 8/3 -&gt; 1/1 3/2 2/1 5/2<br/>&gt; dominant 7th here is 1/1 5/4 3/2 16/9<br/>&gt; mode is major: 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8<br/>&gt; or: 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 15/8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another example I&apos;ve confirmed that is not constructed with the &gt; harmonic 7th is the diminished 7th chord which is:<br/>&gt; 1/1 6/5 45/32 27/16<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s another reason I distrust the 7th harmonic now.<br/>&gt; The most basic keys / modes are 5-limit for sure.<br/>&gt; Harmony can be seen as arising by playing 2 or more melodies &gt; against eachother in what is called counterpoint.<br/>&gt; This way it seems impossible to me that a 7 limit harmony can arise &gt; from playing several 5-limit melodies at once.<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think one can distort the melodies for the benefit of more &gt; harmonious 7-limit harmony.<br/>&gt; So either the melodies or atleast one of the melodies of the &gt; counterpoint has to be a 7-limit melody.<br/>&gt; The only other possibility i see is that all are 5-limi melodies &gt; but 1 of the melodies is constantly in a 7th harmonic relation to &gt; the other 5-limit melodies.<br/>&gt; So no 7th in normal classical music it seems from the above?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also thought I&apos;d need the 7th intervals in arabic music, but I &gt; find I can explain it perfectly within 5-limit. (I&apos;ll dedicate a &gt; new thread to this soon)<br/>&gt; Also expected it to explain chromatic note sequences but now see &gt; the way this can be contructed from 5-limit much better.<br/>&gt; So why should the 7th harmonic have a place in the structure of &gt; music and in musical tuning?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes 1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4 does seem more consonant to me than for &gt; instance 1/1 5/4 3/2 16/9 or 1/1 5/4 3/2 225/128 or 1/1 5/4 3/2 9/5.<br/>&gt; It seems logical to me that 1/1 5/4 3/2 225/128 gets it consonance &gt; from beeing so close to 1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4.<br/>&gt; But perhaps consonance in this way isn&apos;t relevant to actual music.<br/>&gt; And this consonance of just one chord is countered by the dissonant &gt; modulations and interval steps the 7th gives.<br/>&gt; Perhaps music is a 3 dimensional form. Primes 2, 3 and 5 making the &gt; structure and the 7th has no musical function and is only a &gt; harmonic overtone?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not trying to get anybody off their faith or use of the 7th &gt; with this message.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m really only trying to find it out for myself, openminded and &gt; would really like a contructive discussion on this.<br/>&gt; Thanks!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marcel</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2009 10:30:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I played 6:7:9 three cents sharp, what would I perceive it as?

The harmonic series begins with an octave. Great, so we&apos;ll choose this as the period. Then there&apos;s a fifth and a fourth. Okay, let&apos;s choose this as our basis for working with scales. When you start combining and chaining these, sooner or later, you&apos;ll find an interval that is only ~21.5 cents away from the next one in the harmonic series -- i.e. 5/4. Because we want to get rid of this &quot;out-of-tune&quot; interval, we&apos;ll replace the &quot;mathematically correct&quot; 81/64 with 5/4 and, similarly, 32/27 with 6/5. So no we don&apos;t have one size of, for example, a major second, we&apos;ve got two. This means there&apos;s not only one correct size of a major second, there are AT LEAST two (9/8 and 10/9). And we&apos;re not working with only 3-limit intervals anymore, we&apos;ve got the 5-limit set. And now, a similar situation occurs. Combining and chaining the whole lot of 5-limit intervals which we have at our disposal, sooner or later, we&apos;ll quickly get to another interval which is just under 8 cents away from another one in the series. And, again, because we don&apos;t want this &quot;out-of-tuneness&quot;, we&apos;ll replace 225/128 with 7/4, 45/32 with 7/5, and 75/64 with 7/6. So now we find that there is neither one, nor there are two, but AT LEAST four sizes of major seconds in JI (9/8, 10/9, 28/25, and 125/112). And we can&apos;t say that one of them is the &quot;correct&quot; one and the other are not, because, simply, every harmonic progression may have different requirements. If you should find 7-limit intervals &quot;invalid for common-practice music&quot; for the reasons you gave, then you&apos;d have to find 5-limit intervals invalid in just the same way. -- BTW: Before you start arguing about my suggestions, please have a look at &quot;parizek_7lqmtd2.scl&quot; in Manuel&apos;s scale archive and try playing around with it for a while.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>caleb morgan &#x3C;calebmrgn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2009 2:37:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m watching with admiration as Mike hits softball after softball out of the park, here.</p><p>Yes, you are patient, Mike.</p><p>On Feb 13, 2009, at 3:54 AM, Mike Battaglia wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Sure it&apos;s valid.

But when people take the time to give you examples, &gt; webpages,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and literature references to something like fundamental placement &gt; of a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; harmonic series, you can&apos;t expect people to be happy if you just &gt; bat<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; them away with some remark about how the whole thing is &gt; &quot;improbable&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and how we&apos;re all just so stupid that we believe what science &gt; says and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; you&apos;re the only one smart enough to think differently.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No you&apos;re not patient.<br/>&gt; &gt; You have your own idea of how things should work and beleive in it &gt; like the<br/>&gt; &gt; bible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s like I eat toast every morning for breakfast, and you come along<br/>&gt; and start expounding on that toast is invalid for breakfast. The only<br/>&gt; thing that&apos;s valid is bread. Whenever I eat toast, I&apos;m really only<br/>&gt; eating burnt bread. Then I say &quot;I like toast&quot; and you say &quot;give me a<br/>&gt; precise example in which toast functions properly in breakfast.&quot; So I<br/>&gt; say &quot;well, it&apos;s good if you&apos;re eating eggs.&quot; Then you go &quot;yes, but I<br/>&gt; can&apos;t tell if you&apos;re really eating toast or just burnt bread. Give me<br/>&gt; a more precise example and explain precisely how the toast fits into<br/>&gt; breakfast.&quot; So I say &quot;well, you can use the toast to dip into the egg<br/>&gt; yolk if it&apos;s sunny side up.&quot; And your response is always something<br/>&gt; like &quot;that situation will never come up. it&apos;s impossible. The egg yolk<br/>&gt; would have to be undercooked to dip anything in it, and that&apos;s<br/>&gt; unhealthy. You are completely lost, and probably morbidly obese from<br/>&gt; eating so many eggs.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I say &quot;this whole discussion is pointless, I like eating toast, and<br/>&gt; that&apos;s that, what other requirement could there be?&quot; then you get on<br/>&gt; about &quot;that&apos;s a great attitude. Let&apos;s all just assume things work<br/>&gt; because they work and not figure out the order and you have a bad<br/>&gt; attitude and something about darwin and you better go get your head<br/>&gt; examined because you must be screwed up to like toast since didn&apos;t you<br/>&gt; hear me say a million times toast is overcooked bread?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now when someone comes along and says your god may not exist you get<br/>&gt; &gt; frustrated when you can&apos;t give good enough arguments for you your &gt; god would<br/>&gt; &gt; exist.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ROFL, why should I sit here and argue about whether or not I like<br/>&gt; something that I like? If you come along with some argument about how<br/>&gt; it&apos;s &quot;invalid&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;doesn&apos;t work&quot; or something, but I like it,<br/>&gt; what arguments do I need to make? &quot;I LIKE IT. IT&apos;S GOOD. MAKE MIKE<br/>&gt; HAPPY. GIVE WARM FUZZY FEELING ALL OVER.&quot; What are you going to say,<br/>&gt; &quot;no it doesn&apos;t?&quot; &quot;It&apos;s out of tune?&quot; Should we just argue back and<br/>&gt; forth over whether or not it sounds &quot;good?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This seems to me to be the reason you get so extra pissed off.<br/>&gt; &gt; Btw the previous discussion about beating has virtually nothing to &gt; do with<br/>&gt; &gt; this discussion.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve done some analysing on your example eventhough it was very &gt; unclear and<br/>&gt; &gt; not the exact example i asked for.<br/>&gt; &gt; But i&apos;can show it should indeed be 75/64 not 7/6.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll post it tomorrow, i&apos;m off to bed now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve given you examples. Other people have given you examples. If you<br/>&gt; want to develop an appreciation for 7-limit music, try spending more<br/>&gt; than 3 seconds with some of these songs before making snap judgments<br/>&gt; about them. Or go write some of your own 7-limit music and then maybe<br/>&gt; you&apos;ll be the one who figures out precisely how it works.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps also a personal servant might be useful in giving you the<br/>&gt; exact example you want, formatted precisely to your personal needs,<br/>&gt; without mention of any overtones higher than 7, and at your beck and<br/>&gt; call. My example was plenty clear to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Marcel<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2009 3:21:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Euler liked 7 limit intervals hundred of years ago.

The harmonic series begins with an octave. Great, so<br/>&gt; we&apos;ll choose this as the period. Then there&apos;s a fifth and a fourth. Okay,<br/>&gt; let&apos;s choose this as our basis for working with scales. When you start<br/>&gt; combining and chaining these, sooner or later, you&apos;ll find an interval that<br/>&gt; is only ~21.5 cents away from the next one in the harmonic series -- i.e.<br/>&gt; 5/4. Because we want to get rid of this &quot;out-of-tune&quot; interval, we&apos;ll<br/>&gt; replace the &quot;mathematically correct&quot; 81/64 with 5/4 and, similarly, 32/27<br/>&gt; with 6/5.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it works like this.<br/>81/64 is not replaced by 5/4.<br/>You can play 81/64, but it has a different musical meaning. When you play<br/>81/64 you can modulate to different things, play a different melody or do<br/>different chord progressions.<br/>81/64 and 5/4 are not just 2 different tunings of the same musical structure<br/>in my opinion.<br/>They&apos;re 2 different musical structures.<br/>This becomes apparent mosly because of the 2 different notes lead to<br/>different things.<br/>Especially 32/27 is very much used in common practice music. And it is a<br/>different note with a different musical meaning from 6/5.</p><p>&gt; So no we don&apos;t have one size of, for example, a major second, we&apos;ve got<br/>&gt; two. This means there&apos;s not only one correct size of a major second, there<br/>&gt; are AT LEAST two (9/8 and 10/9). And we&apos;re not working with only 3-limit<br/>&gt; intervals anymore, we&apos;ve got the 5-limit set. And now, a similar situation<br/>&gt; occurs. Combining and chaining the whole lot of 5-limit intervals which we<br/>&gt; have at our disposal, sooner or later, we&apos;ll quickly get to another interval<br/>&gt; which is just under 8 cents away from another one in the series. And, again,<br/>&gt; because we don&apos;t want this &quot;out-of-tuneness&quot;, we&apos;ll replace 225/128 with<br/>&gt; 7/4, 45/32 with 7/5, and 75/64 with 7/6.</p><p>Well I don&apos;t agree this is how we&apos;d get to the 7/4 7/5 7/6 etc.<br/>But yes I have been expecting the 7/4 7/5 7/6 to have a unique musical<br/>function and to lead to new chord progressions etc.<br/>But I can&apos;t find it, and can&apos;t make them to work in normal chord<br/>progressions.</p><p>So now we find that there is neither one, nor there are two, but AT LEAST<br/>&gt; four sizes of major seconds in JI (9/8, 10/9, 28/25, and 125/112). And we<br/>&gt; can&apos;t say that one of them is the &quot;correct&quot; one and the other are not,<br/>&gt; because, simply, every harmonic progression may have different requirements.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for the neutral seconds you&apos;ll hopefully find more logic<br/>in 27/25 and 800/729 (making 32/27 together, either can come first).<br/>No need to bring in 7-limit.</p><p>&gt; If you should find 7-limit intervals &quot;invalid for common-practice music&quot;<br/>&gt; for the reasons you gave, then you&apos;d have to find 5-limit intervals invalid<br/>&gt; in just the same way.</p><p>No I never said this is the way I find my 5-limit intervals.<br/>I have a system for this which is not picking close to 12-tet or something<br/>like that.</p><p>&gt; -- BTW: Before you start arguing about my suggestions, please have a look<br/>&gt; at &quot;parizek_7lqmtd2.scl&quot; in Manuel&apos;s scale archive and try playing around<br/>&gt; with it for a while.</p><p>Here&apos;s one of my own 7-limit scales I&apos;ve been playing with:<br/>1/1 36/35 21/20 16/15 15/14 35/32 10/9 9/8 8/7 7/6 6/5 5/4 9/7 21/16 4/3<br/>48/35 7/5 10/7 35/24 3/2 32/21 14/9<br/> 8/5 5/3 12/7 7/4 16/9 9/5 64/35 28/15 15/8 40/21 35/18 2/1<br/>And I really do have a lot of experience with the 7th harmonic.

And it is a different note<br/>&gt; with a different musical meaning from 6/5.</p><p>I think you&apos;re trying to link two things which may not necessarily have much to do with each other. This &quot;link&quot; started to appear in actual music, if I&apos;m not mistaken, during the 16th century when a new element occured which was totally unknown to music before -- a &quot;chord&quot;. But even sooner, music could quite happily contain &quot;trines&quot; (is that what they were called then?) like C-E-G or A-C-E. At that time, the &quot;model&quot; syst&eacute;m of intonation was still Pythagorean. Now, I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a similar term in English, but Czech has a term of something like &quot;tonal gender&quot;, which means the property that ordinary chords can be either major or minor -- i.e. have either a major or minor &quot;tonal gender&quot;. Since the first serious introduction of 5-limit intervals into music, the ratios of 2 and 3 have determined the &quot;fundamental tone&quot; according to the theory of classical harmony, and the ratios of 5 have determined the &quot;tonal gender&quot;. But weren&apos;t there things similar to the &quot;tonal gender&quot; even before 5-limit intervals were seriously in use?</p><p>&gt; Well I don&apos;t agree this is how we&apos;d get to the 7/4 7/5 7/6 etc.<br/>&gt; But yes I have been expecting the 7/4 7/5 7/6 to have a unique musical function and to lead<br/>&gt; to new chord progressions etc.<br/>&gt; But I can&apos;t find it, and can&apos;t make them to work in normal chord progressions.</p><p>If you cared more about difference tones and fundamental frequencies and similar things, you&apos;d find that there ARE some even in quite ordinary harmonic progressions. To give an example, I&apos;ll suppose the tone of C2 to have a frequency of 64Hz (just about a quartertone lower than today&apos;s C2). Okay, let&apos;s say we want to tune a progression of two intervals in JI, E3-A#3 followed by D3-B3. According to strict 5-limit rules (with no verification by actual listening), the frequencies should be 160-225Hz (i.e. 45/32) and 144-240Hz (5/3). BUT ... Now here comes the fact that not only difference tones are important in our listening but the second order difference tones as well, particularly the lower one of the two (don&apos;t know about you, but I can often clearly, VERY clearly, spot them in sounding intervals). In the case of the augmented fourth, the proper difference tone is 65Hz and the lower second difference tone is 95Hz (you see, these two make something like a mistuned fifth). In the case of the major sixth, the proper difference tone is 96Hz and the lower second difference tone is 48Hz (an exact octave). What does this mean? First, this means that you will probably find it &quot;harmonically convincing&quot; if you add a fifth of C2-G2 to the E3-A#3 and also add an octave of G1-G2 to the D3-B3, which results in the augmented fourth being used in a totally different way than in, for example, dominant 7th resolutions (you see, the &quot;fundamental tone&quot; in dominant 7th chords would be F# according to classical harmony, but here it clearly is C). And secondly, when you want to find an &quot;acoustically convincing&quot; way to tune this chord progression, most probably you&apos;ll use 160-224Hz for E3-A#3 (i.e. 7/5) instead of 160-225Hz (45/32). The chord progression simply is of 7-limit origin, not 5-limit.</p><p>&gt; If you&apos;re looking for the neutral seconds you&apos;ll hopefully find more logic in 27/25 and<br/>&gt; 800/729 (making 32/27 together, either can come first).<br/>&gt; No need to bring in 7-limit.</p><p>I was not speaking of neutral seconds or thirds at all.</p><p>And one other point. If you really want to find a different &quot;musical&quot; meaning for 7-limit intervals compared to 5-limit ones in a similar way 5-limit intervals have different meaning than 3-limit ones, the only option I can think of right now is to use 3D temperaments and not 2D ones. This means that you would have to tak&eacute; a completely new view on harmony which the classical theory of harmony had never considered (bear in mind that meantone is a 2D temperament and lots of harmonic concepts have developed from temperaments similar to that). Good examples of 3D temperaments may be, I think, the &quot;breed&quot; temperament (which I think Graham must have thought of among the first ones because why would it be called like that then) or the recent suggestions of mine which I was calling &quot;anti-orwell&quot; and &quot;ragismatic&quot;.

What I did was come up with a lattice for 11-limit harmony in miracle temperament and note that it could be used more generally.  Gene wrote music with it -- I forget if it&apos;s 7- or 11-limit.</p><p>Anyway, I don&apos;t agree with your point.  2D temperaments are fine for 7-limit intervals.  Perhaps meantone is too simplistic but even then there&apos;s adaptive tuning (manual or otherwise) and tempered timbres.  I&apos;m going with magic now.   That&apos;s good enough for 9-limit chords to make sense.  With tripod notation support in LilyPond it happens that I can experiment with 3D marvel temperament by thinking about magic temperament with correct spellings.  That may improve the tuning.  The view will still follow magic though.</p><p>One of the implications of magic is that you have three different triads: major, minor, and subminor.  The difference in the thirds between major and minor is the same as between minor and subminor.  And there&apos;s one very simple cadence where a subminor resolves onto a major with the same root.  I don&apos;t like this as a standard minor to major because the step&apos;s too small.</p><p>Marvel temperament implies the relationships Marcel keeps talking about, 75:64 and so on.  So I have no opinion about what the &quot;true&quot; logic of these intervals is.  You can give the subminor triad an extended 5-limit rationalization if it appeals to you.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3>William Gard &#x3C;billygard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2009 8:04:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t DO anything with the 7th harmonic (besides parralel chords which<br/>&gt; never end), that&apos;s the kind of example I&apos;m asking for, what to do with the<br/>&gt; 7th harmonic that warrants it&apos;s existence in musical structure.<br/>&gt; No example has yet been given to me and I can&apos;t find one myself.

The 7-limit<br/>version has a firm locked sound that no other tuning offers. I can even remember the<br/>striking difference in my head.</p><p>As for hearing a melody sound off when you try to tune it to 7-limit, I found a similar<br/>experience when I created a MIDI of the 5-limit major scale. The 3rd, 6th and 7th degrees<br/>sounded audibly flat, even though they resulted in tighter sounding triads when used to<br/>make chords. The major scale tuned to 3-limit sounds more in tune as a single melody<br/>line.</p><p>In the polyphonic architecture chords are the consequence of simultaneously sounding<br/>melodies, and the chord tuning is a consequence of what melody notes happen to be<br/>heard together. And that&apos;s most likely how harmony started. But in homophonic<br/>architecture the tables are turned, and the melody tuning is subject to the implied<br/>harmonies. Chances are if you were imagining these harmonies while singing the melody<br/>unaccompanied, you would unconsciously bend your pitches to tune to the harmony that<br/>the melody seems to describe. For instance, tuning the 4th scale degree to a 4/3 if it<br/>sounds like the root of a subdominant chord, or tuning it to a 21/16 if it sounds like the<br/>7th of a dominant chord.</p><p>You did describe an out-of-tune sound when 7-limit tunings are used in music. But<br/>remember that much modern music bases its very charm on bending the pitch on purpose<br/>(C.F. You Light Up My Life). When it comes to a capella styles that have as their basis the<br/>formation of &quot;locked in&quot; chords, it is part of the very style to &quot;bend&quot; the notes to make the<br/>vertical sonorities sound straight, particularly in the case of barbershop.</p><p>Now when I just sing up the scale without regard to a supporting harmony, it will most<br/>likely follow a 3-limit tuning. For the entire 25-note chromatic scale (to include all<br/>chromatic intervals) can be generated with just a chain of pure 5ths. But the chords<br/>generated in that system will produce harshly wide major 3rds and 6ths. If you sing the<br/>major scale while mentally accompanying it with the chords I-V-I-IV-I-IV-V-I, you will<br/>most likely bend the pitches toward the 5-limit tuning.</p><p>Billy</p></div><h3>justin_tone52 &#x3C;kleisma7@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2009 9:00:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Kraig,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Euler liked 7 limit intervals hundred of years ago.

Marcel had trouble finding 7-limit in *common practice music*.</p><p>I for one am interested in 7-limit and beyond precisely because it opens a world of new harmonic possibilities to explore beyond common practice music. It seems to me the problem Marcel has might be comparable to a problem some Early Renaissance musician might have had with 5-limit. In the conventional music before the Renaissance, 3-limit prevailed. So, if that was taken as a standard, then 5-limit music was not &quot;valid&quot; (to use Marcel&apos;s word) at that time. It is somewhat hopeless to argue with such an attitude...

The 3rd, 6th<br/>&gt; and 7th degrees<br/>&gt; sounded audibly flat, even though they resulted in tighter sounding triads<br/>&gt; when used to<br/>&gt; make chords. The major scale tuned to 3-limit sounds more in tune as a<br/>&gt; single melody<br/>&gt; line.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hmm I had a different experience.<br/>For me only the 6th degree sounded too low when play the 5-limit major<br/>scale.<br/>But I found out why that was.<br/>I was playing it like this 1: C 1/1,  2: D 9/8,  3: E 5/4,  4: F 4/3,  5: G<br/>3/2,  6: A 5/3,  7: B 15/8,  8: C 2/1<br/>Now how I was playing it was with a steady rhythm, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8<br/>This rhythm I was subconsciously dividing in 1 2 3 4 1(5) 2(6) 3(7) 4(8)<br/>When playing this way my ear was expecting 5 6 7 8 to be a perfect<br/>repetition of 1 2 3 4.<br/>This works on a normal piano offcourse and my guess is many people are used<br/>to hearing the scale like this when they play it like this.<br/>This is why the 7th degree sounded too low for me, I was expecting A 27/16.<br/>So the way I naturally heared the major scale when playing like this was not<br/>actually the real major scale but a scale made up of the first part of the<br/>major scale then a modulation of 3/2 up and then again that first part.<br/>But when I take rhythm and modulations and other things into account, I&apos;ve<br/>found that 5-limit gives exactly the perfect melodies I hear in my head and<br/>allways heard in my head.<br/>I don&apos;t beleive melody is 3-limit natually, and much research has been done<br/>which shows melody is naturally at least 5-limit.</p><p>&gt; In the polyphonic architecture chords are the consequence of simultaneously<br/>&gt; sounding<br/>&gt; melodies, and the chord tuning is a consequence of what melody notes happen<br/>&gt; to be<br/>&gt; heard together. And that&apos;s most likely how harmony started. But in<br/>&gt; homophonic<br/>&gt; architecture the tables are turned, and the melody tuning is subject to the<br/>&gt; implied<br/>&gt; harmonies. Chances are if you were imagining these harmonies while singing<br/>&gt; the melody<br/>&gt; unaccompanied, you would unconsciously bend your pitches to tune to the<br/>&gt; harmony that<br/>&gt; the melody seems to describe. For instance, tuning the 4th scale degree to<br/>&gt; a 4/3 if it<br/>&gt; sounds like the root of a subdominant chord, or tuning it to a 21/16 if it<br/>&gt; sounds like the<br/>&gt; 7th of a dominant chord.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well one could see it another way.<br/>Melody beeing 5-limit or 7-limit naturally, which gives many different<br/>structures and possibilities that are close together.<br/>All these different possibilities are actually different melodies with<br/>different musical meaning.<br/>It is when you play chords that you simply limit the number of possibilities<br/>and therefore give clearer meaning / view to the melody.<br/>So chords don&apos;t make the melody, they just shine a light on which melodies<br/>are beeing played.<br/>I&apos;m not saying this is the way it is, only giving an alternative<br/>explanation.<br/>Perhaps you are right about melody beeing retuned for the sake of chords,<br/>but it does not have to be this way it seems to me.</p><p>&gt; You did describe an out-of-tune sound when 7-limit tunings are used in<br/>&gt; music. But<br/>&gt; remember that much modern music bases its very charm on bending the pitch<br/>&gt; on purpose<br/>&gt; (C.F. You Light Up My Life). When it comes to a capella styles that have as<br/>&gt; their basis the<br/>&gt; formation of &quot;locked in&quot; chords, it is part of the very style to &quot;bend&quot; the<br/>&gt; notes to make the<br/>&gt; vertical sonorities sound straight, particularly in the case of barbershop.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well this is one way to look at it.<br/>Another way to look at it is that in harmony the notes that are beeing<br/>bended by a comma are actually not thesame note in the underlying harmonic<br/>structure.<br/>For example: when playing 1/1 5/4 3/2 -&gt; 6/5 3/2 9/5 does 5/4 go down by<br/>25/24 or can you say that the musical structure is so that 1/1 goes to 6/5<br/>and 5/4 goes to 3/2 etc.<br/>And that this still hold when playing an inversion of 6/5 3/2 9/5 like for<br/>instance 2/1 5/2 3/1 -&gt; 9/5 6/5 3/2.<br/>I tend to see for instance the syntonic comma 81/80 in thesame way. The note<br/>doesn&apos;t slide by 81/80 but another new note from a different location comes<br/>to 81/80 off the other note (which is in itself off to a new location).<br/>This could also explain why 1/1 5/4 3/2 -&gt; 1/1 6/5 3/2 sounds so bad. Yet<br/>the above example doesn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; Now when I just sing up the scale without regard to a supporting harmony,<br/>&gt; it will most<br/>&gt; likely follow a 3-limit tuning. For the entire 25-note chromatic scale (to<br/>&gt; include all<br/>&gt; chromatic intervals) can be generated with just a chain of pure 5ths. But<br/>&gt; the chords<br/>&gt; generated in that system will produce harshly wide major 3rds and 6ths.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hmm I don&apos;t think the pure 5th chromatic scale is how music works on the<br/>basic level you mean.</p><p>&gt; If you sing the<br/>&gt; major scale while mentally accompanying it with the chords<br/>&gt; I-V-I-IV-I-IV-V-I, you will<br/>&gt; most likely bend the pitches toward the 5-limit tuning.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes agreed.

This &bdquo;link&quot; started to appear in actual music, if I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not mistaken, during the 16th century when a new element occured which was<br/>&gt; totally unknown to music before -- a &bdquo;chord&quot;. But even sooner, music could<br/>&gt; quite happily contain &bdquo;trines&quot; (is that what they were called then?) like<br/>&gt; C-E-G or A-C-E. At that time, the &bdquo;model&quot; syst&eacute;m of intonation was still<br/>&gt; Pythagorean.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ah yes I agree they were tuning to pythagorean system, but I don&apos;t think<br/>their music was pythagorean.<br/>Just like we now use 12tet but I beleive the actual underlying way music<br/>works is pure JI, I beleive the old music, and all music has allways been<br/>pure JI no matter how you tune it. It&apos;s just that when you tune it<br/>differently you&apos;re out of tune.</p><p>Now, I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a similar term in English, but Czech has a term<br/>&gt; of something like &bdquo;tonal gender&quot;, which means the property that ordinary<br/>&gt; chords can be either major or minor -- i.e. have either a major or minor<br/>&gt; &bdquo;tonal gender&quot;. Since the first serious introduction of 5-limit intervals<br/>&gt; into music, the ratios of 2 and 3 have determined the &bdquo;fundamental tone&quot;<br/>&gt; according to the theory of classical harmony, and the ratios of 5 have<br/>&gt; determined the &bdquo;tonal gender&quot;. But weren&apos;t there things similar to the<br/>&gt; &bdquo;tonal gender&quot; even before 5-limit intervals were seriously in use?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes I beleive there was tonal gender before the music theory progressed a<br/>little a recognized this.<br/>Btw I don&apos;t beleive 3/2 allways determines the fundamental tone.<br/>It depends on the musical context.<br/>I for instance beleive that 1/1 6/5 3/2 can have different origins.<br/>One beeing an inversion of 1/1 5/4 5/3, where the fundamental of 1/1 6/5 3/2<br/>is actually 6/5.<br/>And one beeing the &quot;mirror&quot; of 1/1 5/4 3/2 - 1/1 6/5 3/2 which has it&apos;s<br/>fundamental as 1/1.<br/>They appear at different places in JI and have different meaning.</p><p>&gt; If you cared more about difference tones and fundamental frequencies and<br/>&gt; similar things, you&apos;d find that there ARE some even in quite ordinary<br/>&gt; harmonic progressions. To give an example, I&apos;ll suppose the tone of C2 to<br/>&gt; have a frequency of 64Hz (just about a quartertone lower than today&apos;s C2).<br/>&gt; Okay, let&apos;s say we want to tune a progression of two intervals in JI, E3-A#3<br/>&gt; followed by D3-B3. According to strict 5-limit rules (with no verification<br/>&gt; by actual listening), the frequencies should be 160-225Hz (i.e. 45/32) and<br/>&gt; 144-240Hz (5/3). BUT ... Now here comes the fact that not only difference<br/>&gt; tones are important in our listening but the second order difference tones<br/>&gt; as well, particularly the lower one of the two (don&apos;t know about you, but I<br/>&gt; can often clearly, VERY clearly, spot them in sounding intervals).<br/>&gt;<br/>Ohmy, are we talking about difference tones (nonlinear distortion) or<br/>beating here :)<br/>I&apos;m not getting into this discussion again haha<br/>But I beleive I still have not heard a single difference tone, though have<br/>heard beat notes and it&apos;s not clear how they behave in chords, beleive<br/>someone is still investigating this on this list.</p><p>&gt; In the case of the augmented fourth, the proper difference tone is 65Hz and<br/>&gt; the lower second difference tone is 95Hz (you see, these two make something<br/>&gt; like a mistuned fifth). In the case of the major sixth, the proper<br/>&gt; difference tone is 96Hz and the lower second difference tone is 48Hz (an<br/>&gt; exact octave). What does this mean? First, this means that you will probably<br/>&gt; find it &bdquo;harmonically convincing&quot; if you add a fifth of C2-G2 to the E3-A#3<br/>&gt; and also add an octave of G1-G2 to the D3-B3, which results in the augmented<br/>&gt; fourth being used in a totally different way than in, for example, dominant<br/>&gt; 7th resolutions (you see, the &bdquo;fundamental tone&quot; in dominant 7th chords<br/>&gt; would be F# according to classical harmony, but here it clearly is C). And<br/>&gt; secondly, when you want to find an &quot;acoustically convincing&quot; way to tune<br/>&gt; this chord progression, most probably you&apos;ll use 160-224Hz for E3-A#3 (i.e.<br/>&gt; 7/5) instead of 160-225Hz (45/32). The chord progression simply is of<br/>&gt; 7-limit origin, not 5-limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>You make it sound nice and appear fairly logical.<br/>But how can you get these kinds of things from difference tones or beat<br/>notes?<br/>Since surely when you play the above things in some inversion or transpose a<br/>few of the notes by an octave for instance, you will get totally different<br/>difference tones / beat notes which would imply a totally different<br/>structure according to your reasoning above?<br/>I don&apos;t beleive difference tones / beat notes are at the ground of music the<br/>way you descrbe it now and I dont find it a convincing appeal for the 7th<br/>harmonic.<br/>Maybe you are indeed on to something relevant to music in a way, I don&apos;t<br/>know, but the way described now doesn&apos;t make me think this is a solid<br/>theory.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If you&apos;re looking for the neutral seconds you&apos;ll hopefully find more<br/>&gt; logic in 27/25 and<br/>&gt; &gt; 800/729 (making 32/27 together, either can come first).<br/>&gt; &gt; No need to bring in 7-limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was not speaking of neutral seconds or thirds at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And one other point. If you really want to find a different &bdquo;musical&quot;<br/>&gt; meaning for 7-limit intervals compared to 5-limit ones in a similar way<br/>&gt; 5-limit intervals have different meaning than 3-limit ones, the only option<br/>&gt; I can think of right now is to use 3D temperaments and not 2D ones. This<br/>&gt; means that you would have to tak&eacute; a completely new view on harmony which the<br/>&gt; classical theory of harmony had never considered (bear in mind that meantone<br/>&gt; is a 2D temperament and lots of harmonic concepts have developed from<br/>&gt; temperaments similar to that). Good examples of 3D temperaments may be, I<br/>&gt; think, the &bdquo;breed&quot; temperament (which I think Graham must have thought of<br/>&gt; among the first ones because why would it be called like that then) or the<br/>&gt; recent suggestions of mine which I was calling &bdquo;anti-orwell&quot; and<br/>&gt; &bdquo;ragismatic&quot;. If you want, I can post some interval sizes and mappings for<br/>&gt; the temperaments. Maybe you would find your answer somewhere there. What&apos;re<br/>&gt; you saying?<br/>&gt;</p><p>These are real temperaments (tempered tunings) you&apos;re referring to right?<br/>Not pure JI?<br/>I&apos;m not interested in any tempered tuning, only in pure JI.<br/>Thanks for the offer though!</p><p>I&apos;ve allready experimented a lot with different pure JI 7-limit scales over<br/>the past years, also very large scales, so this is not the issue.<br/>As for different musical meaning for 7-limit intervals and a completely new<br/>view on harmony (and melody).<br/>Yes I think you may be right in this.<br/>My original question was about both these things. It was about 7-limit not<br/>beeing right in normal common practice music, and about if and how then the<br/>7th harmonic should be used in music.<br/>I don&apos;t know much about 2D and 3D. I allways figured 5-limit to be 3D in a<br/>way with the octaves beeing 1 dimension, the 3/2 etc beeing the 2nd<br/>dimension and the 5/4 / 6/5 etc beeing the third dimension. 7-limit would be<br/>4D then.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2009 11:12:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Justin,</p><p>I can think of several nice chord progressions in the 7-limit:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1:<br/>&gt; 63/32--2/1<br/>&gt; 27/16--7/4<br/>&gt; 45/32--3/2<br/>&gt; 9/8----1/1<br/>&gt; (notice the small voice-leading in the top two voices)<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is the same as an earlyer example.<br/>It is parallel chords which does not make clear any underlying musical<br/>structure.<br/>And it can also be<br/>9/8 45/32 27/16 2/1 -&gt; 1/1 5/4 3/2 16/9 for instance.</p><p>2: (a sort of I-IV-V-I but using the 7th harmonic)<br/>&gt; 7/4----12/7---49/32--3/2<br/>&gt; 5/4----9/7----21/16--5/4<br/>&gt; 1/1----1/1----63/32--1/1<br/>&gt; 1/1----8/7----7/4----1/1<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; 3: (a sort of I-IV-II-V-I)<br/>&gt; 7/4----12/7---32/21--49/32--3/2<br/>&gt; 5/4----9/7----4/3----21/16--5/4<br/>&gt; 1/1----1/1----40/21--63/32--1/1<br/>&gt; 1/1----8/7----32/21--7/4----1/1<br/>&gt;</p><p>What&apos;s your reasoning behind making these 7-limit?<br/>As this can all be played perfectly in 5-limit where it&apos;ll sound much beter<br/> / more natural, and make musical sense.<br/>I&apos;ll give the 5-limit examples of the above later.</p><p>&gt; 4: Anything making use of specific 7-limit structures such as the 1-3-5-7<br/>&gt; hexany:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7/4----7/4<br/>&gt; 5/3----7/4<br/>&gt; 35/24--3/2<br/>&gt; 5/4----5/4<br/>&gt; 7/6----5/4<br/>&gt; 1/1----1/1<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ok so this is 1/1 5/4 5/3 + 1/1 5/4 3/2 only shifted upwards by 7/6, then<br/>1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4<br/>I can&apos;t tell, may very well be 7-limit indeed.<br/>But you could do something similar in 5-limit aswell in many different ways<br/>for instance 1/1 32/27 5/4 40/27 5/3 16/9 -&gt; 1/1 5/4 3/2 16/9<br/>But both don&apos;t make much musical sense to me and sound extremely dissonant.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5: Anything making use of microtonal melodies on top, such as 16/15 10/9<br/>&gt; 9/8 8/7 7/6 6/5 128/105 or something similar<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6: While not strictly 7-limit, Harry Partch&apos;s tonality flux (8/7 10/7 12/7<br/>&gt; moving to 7/6 7/5 7/4) is a noteworthy chord progression using 7-limit<br/>&gt; intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and there are several others that can be used.

It&apos;s that the way you say it is as<br/>though everyone is stupid. If you have a new idea about JI, feel free<br/>to post it. If it&apos;s frustrating to you that people are making small<br/>comma-adjustment errors, then post something about it. Sure. If you<br/>take the attack and insult people from the getgo on the matter, people<br/>won&apos;t be receptive.</p><p>Also, if you post anything about how it&apos;s impossible to get 7-limit JI<br/>to form any coherent musical structure, expect a lot of dissent,<br/>especially when a lot of us here enjoy 7 and 11-limit music, and not<br/>just naively because we&apos;re hearing huge 5-limit modes.</p><p>For example, I particularly love the neutral 11 chord:</p><p>C Ev G Bv D F#v<br/>Where the C-Ev dyad is 9:11 and the C-G is 3:2.</p><p>At first I heard that chord as being musically useless and out of<br/>tune, sounding like a bastardized version of both major and minor. It<br/>would &quot;flip back and forth&quot; in my mind between the two. Now, however,<br/>I find it to be an extremely beautiful and complicated chord, and I&apos;m<br/>using it extensively in the string quartet I&apos;m writing. I&apos;m sure there<br/>are 5-limit intervals that lie close to 9:11, but I also like the way<br/>that 9:11 resonates. Why should I not assume those two characteristics<br/>in tandem mean that 9:11 is the right interval for what I want? It<br/>certainly seems to fit the bill for my uses, and it only sounds &quot;out<br/>of tune&quot; if you don&apos;t like the sound of the neutral triad, which not<br/>everyone does, as it&apos;s pretty out there.</p><p>&gt; I think maybe for a very small part i also say it to build up an<br/>&gt; expectation, as I&apos;m excited about the music converted to JI i will post<br/>&gt; later on this list.<br/>&gt; I no way am I full of myself.

You listened<br/>to it for 2 seconds and you responded with how I write &quot;crappy out of<br/>tune music&quot; and how I should &quot;get my ears checked&quot; and that it &quot;serves<br/>no musical purpose&quot;. They weren&apos;t my compositions, but rather Aaron<br/>Johnson&apos;s.</p><p>He&apos;s one of my favorite microtonal composers ever, so for me to see<br/>you write it off like that is extremely irritating. I&apos;ve learned a lot<br/>about 7-limit structure from studying some of the stuff he&apos;s done -<br/>his &quot;Melancholic&quot; was the first piece that got me into hearing the<br/>difference between subminor triads and minor chords, and his &quot;Lost in<br/>Appalachia&quot; was one of the first pieces that got me into hearing what<br/>a 6:7:9 triad could sound like as the tonic of a piece of music.</p><p>But what irritated me more than anything was your attitude towards the<br/>whole thing. You didn&apos;t suggest tuning something differently, and what<br/>you did say you said in the most insulting way possible. You said he<br/>wrote crappy out of tune music, that we were all &quot;completely lost,&quot;<br/>that only you seem to know how to &quot;do JI right&quot;, etc. These are all<br/>personal attacks. How do you expect people to act?</p><p>I apologize for responding with a personal attack of my own. I wanted<br/>you to see how your statements were being interpreted by others.</p><p>&gt;&gt; And for the record, yes, if you&apos;re trying to fit everything into a<br/>&gt;&gt; 5-limit modal structure, 7-limit intervals will likely be<br/>&gt;&gt; comma-adjusted substitutes for what should be 5-limit intervals. If<br/>&gt;&gt; your goal is to develop a 7-limit framework for music, try starting<br/>&gt;&gt; with a 7-limit modal structure from the beginning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you! Finally at least a little bit recognition and sense.<br/>&gt; Nobody else here seems to accept that view.<br/>&gt; Yes I&apos;ve tried 7-limit modal structure from the beginning.<br/>&gt; It doesn&apos;t make sense for common practice music, and I don&apos;t know how it<br/>&gt; would work in any other way.</p><p>Well, 7-limit intervals aren&apos;t going to fit into a 5-limit modal<br/>structure because a 5-limit modal structure is 5-limit by definition.<br/>Septimal intervals introduce new commas: sorting these out is a new<br/>challenge. Common practice music does utilize some pretty &quot;out&quot;<br/>5-limit structures, such as 75/64 and so on. It is mostly 5-limit<br/>except for a few instances, and to try and substitute 7/6 in for 75/64<br/>is simply not going to sound good.</p><p>I don&apos;t see why this means that 7/6 ALWAYS has to be 75/64.</p><p>On the other hand, try a mode like:</p><p>D E F&lt; G&lt; A B C&lt; D</p><p>Where notes like F&lt;, G&lt;, and C&lt; are tuned a septimal comma flat, so<br/>that the D-C is a perfect 7/4. You can then make a chord like:</p><p>D F&lt; A C&lt; E G&lt; B</p><p>Which is a bunch of stacked alternating 6:7 and 7:9 thirds.</p><p>I like that scale: it&apos;s sort of a &quot;septimal dorian&quot; scale. There are<br/>some interesting sounds there, and I don&apos;t see any reason why the<br/>7/6&apos;s there should be 75/64&apos;s. Sure, you could come up with a 5-limit<br/>mode that has a few comma adjustments and sounds similar, but I don&apos;t<br/>see why that should be a prerequisite for being musically valid.</p><p>Of course, at first it&apos;s going to sound like all of the minor thirds<br/>are flat. Getting it to sound like chords that simply have a different<br/>tonality from 6:5 chords is a sort of trick that I haven&apos;t figured out<br/>quite how it works yet, but I&apos;m starting to get the hang of it.</p><p>&gt; Everything I try I can&apos;t seem to escape the 5-limit modal stucture, unless I<br/>&gt; use 7-limit or higher limit purely as overtones at which point there&apos;s not<br/>&gt; much musical structure but mainly making &quot;sound effect&quot;.<br/>&gt; The way I started 5-limit vs 7-limit thread was truly an honest question of<br/>&gt; which I hoped to get examples that would convince me the 7th harmonic has a<br/>&gt; place in musical structure.</p><p>5-limit intervals were once overtones that only existed to make sound<br/>effects. Music evolved from that. How did that happen, exactly? I<br/>suspect the answer will provide some clues to see how a more complex<br/>and exotic type of music could evolve from 7-limit intervals.</p><p>I think that 5-limit intervals evolve into what is commonly called<br/>&quot;music&quot; once chord progressions are added - not only do we have<br/>chords, but we&apos;ve come up with a pleasing way to lead themselves into<br/>one another. This, mixed with phenomena such as the priming effect -<br/>that an Eb major played before a C-G dyad will cause the C-G dyad to<br/>take on a subtle &quot;minor&quot; quality due to the memory of the Eb -<br/>generally comprise what we call &quot;music&quot;.</p><p>None of these things are really related inherently to &quot;music&quot; -<br/>rather, they are psychological phenomena that we&apos;re making use of, and<br/>the end result is something we call &quot;music.&quot; So when you say that<br/>7-limit intervals might have no relevance to &quot;musical structure,&quot; I<br/>say that musical structure is an emergent property of several<br/>intersecting psychological and psychoacoustic phenomena, and that the<br/>inclusion of 7-limit intervals will create its own musical structure.</p><p>Another interesting time to use 7:4: if you&apos;re landing on a major<br/>chord, and that major chord isn&apos;t the I chord, but rather something<br/>else - something unstable, like a bVI chord or a II chord or something<br/>- putting a 7:4 on top of the chord to make it a 4:5:6:7 is often a<br/>very nice effect. It causes an extremely strong fundamental to jump<br/>out, which only makes it want to resolve even more.</p><p>I mentioned II7 because the 7/4 on top of the II7 chord will<br/>definitely be a septimal comma flat of the tonic. Nonetheless, I hear<br/>that as a different note - it&apos;s close in pitch to the tonic, but it<br/>isn&apos;t the tonic. Small comma shifts can be used to extremely<br/>interesting melodic effect.</p><p>Another thing that started to make higher-limit intervals work for my<br/>predominantly 5-limit ear was to play them a bit softer than the rest<br/>of the intervals in the chord - that way you get the feel of the<br/>&quot;quality&quot; of this new chord without having the comma shift sticking<br/>out at you like a sore thumb. It also puts it on a different &quot;level&quot;<br/>than the rest of the harmony, which I find useful.</p><p>Note also that comma-adjusted intervals are only &quot;out of tune&quot; if you<br/>don&apos;t like them - a few of the examples that you said sound &quot;out of<br/>tune&quot; have grown on me over time and I now hear them as simply being<br/>more complex.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2009 1:55:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mike,</p><p>Thanks for taking the time and troube to write your email.</p><p>you responded with how I write &quot;crappy out of<br/>&gt; tune music&quot; and how I should &quot;get my ears checked&quot; and that it &quot;serves<br/>&gt; no musical purpose&quot;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m sorry for saying such things.<br/>I guess I said it after an allready started argument after which I felt<br/>personally attacked and not taken seriously.<br/>But I should not have said those things like that.

It&apos;s<br/>&gt; just that when you tune it differently you&apos;re out of tune.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure what you mean by &bdquo;pure JI&ldquo; but please bear in mind that 14th century musicians were not thinking about the 5-limit dimmension and therefore were not considering an 81/64 to be a &bdquo;mistuned&ldquo; 5/4 or whatever; because they were not considering 5-limit factors to be &bdquo;valid for music&ldquo;. The first ideas about 5-limit factors were mentioned during the 15th century when musicians discovered the Pythagorean diminished fourth which is just about 2 cents away from 5/4.</p><p>&gt; I for instance beleive that 1/1 6/5 3/2 can have different origins.<br/>&gt; One beeing an inversion of 1/1 5/4 5/3, where the fundamental of 1/1 6/5 3/2 is actually 6/5.<br/>&gt; And one beeing the &quot;mirror&quot; of 1/1 5/4 3/2 - 1/1 6/5 3/2 which has it&apos;s fundamental as 1/1.<br/>&gt; They appear at different places in JI and have different meaning.</p><p>Excuse me, you are confusing &bdquo;bass tone&ldquo; and &bdquo;fundamental tone&ldquo;. According to classical harmony, if you play C2-E3-A3-E4, then the bass tone is C and the fundamental tone is A. And if you play E2-E3-C4-A4, then the bass tone is E and the fundamental tone is also A. So the position of the fifth (no matter if it&rsquo;s a falling fourth or a rising fifth) DOES determine the fundamental tone.</p><p>&gt; But I beleive I still have not heard a single difference tone, though have heard beat notes<br/>&gt; and it&apos;s not clear how they behave in chords, beleive someone is still investigating this<br/>&gt; on this list.</p><p>You know what? Just for your experience, I&rsquo;ve made a recording of two pairs of interval progressions. The two recordings are essentially the same, only the first of them is &bdquo;dry&ldquo; and the second one has some reverb added. I think that you can know what I&rsquo;m talking about when you listen to these examples. Here they are:<br/>#1: <a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/7linyb">www.sendspace.com/file/7linyb</a><br/>#2: <a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/0hgkuu">www.sendspace.com/file/0hgkuu</a></p><p>&gt; You make it sound nice and appear fairly logical.<br/>&gt; But how can you get these kinds of things from difference tones or beat notes?<br/>&gt; Since surely when you play the above things in some inversion or transpose a few of the<br/>&gt; notes by an octave for instance, you will get totally different difference tones / beat notes<br/>&gt; which would imply a totally different structure according to your reasoning above?</p><p>Okay, in case of relative frequencies of 5 and 7, the proper difference tone is 2 and the lower second difference tone is 3. In case of 7 and 10, they are 3 and 4, respectively. Is that such a radical change?</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t beleive difference tones / beat notes are at the ground of music the way you descrbe<br/>&gt; it now and I dont find it a convincing appeal for the 7th harmonic.<br/>&gt; Maybe you are indeed on to something relevant to music in a way, I don&apos;t know, but the<br/>&gt; way described now doesn&apos;t make me think this is a solid theory.</p><p>Okay, this is where we differ significantly. I couldn&rsquo;t agree with your view unless you gave me evidence why it doesn&rsquo;t work. For me it has always worked perfectly and it has confirmed lots of classical harmony concepts to me. And remember, this is not something I&rsquo;m making up somewhere in mi mind just to have something to say, this is my description of what I can hear.</p><p>&gt; These are real temperaments (tempered tunings) you&apos;re referring to right?<br/>&gt; Not pure JI?<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not interested in any tempered tuning, only in pure JI.</p><p>You are apparently not thinking about one very important fact. The only musical concept (concerning common-practice music) which has its origins in 5-limit JI is the concept of single chords as usable musical elements. But a vast majority of properties in Baroque and classical harmony has its origins in meantone temperaments, not in JI, and people would never have found them meaningful and thought of using them in music if meantone temperaments had not been known of. And then, there were many many harmonic progressions favored in romanticism which musicians would probably never have thought of if there were no circular temperaments. You can&rsquo;t directly say that every harmonic progression or structure has its origin in JI because it doesn&rsquo;t have. For most of Baroque and classical music, the model for harmony was the meantone temperament, which means that the comma we are tempering out here is 81/80. But you can, of course, come up with totally different models for harmonic structures, once you choose a different comma to be tempered out -- which is exactly what I did about a year ago when I made &bdquo;Run Down The Whistle&ldquo; -- I think even you heard it then, didn&rsquo;t you?</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>William Gard &#x3C;billygard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2009 9:39:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&lt;&lt;&lt; Excuse me, you are confusing bass tone&quot; and fundamental tone&quot;.

Even though they were not<br/>aware of this themselves.<br/>I also find it probable that people didn&apos;t tune very exact to 81/64 in that<br/>time, and that choirs for instance would have surely sung 5/4 even though<br/>they thought it was 81/64.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I for instance beleive that 1/1 6/5 3/2 can have different origins.<br/>&gt; &gt; One beeing an inversion of 1/1 5/4 5/3, where the fundamental of 1/1 6/5<br/>&gt; 3/2 is actually 6/5.<br/>&gt; &gt; And one beeing the &quot;mirror&quot; of 1/1 5/4 3/2 - 1/1 6/5 3/2 which has it&apos;s<br/>&gt; fundamental as 1/1.<br/>&gt; &gt; They appear at different places in JI and have different meaning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Excuse me, you are confusing &bdquo;bass tone&quot; and &bdquo;fundamental tone&quot;. According<br/>&gt; to classical harmony, if you play C2-E3-A3-E4, then the bass tone is C and<br/>&gt; the fundamental tone is A. And if you play E2-E3-C4-A4, then the bass tone<br/>&gt; is E and the fundamental tone is also A. So the position of the fifth (no<br/>&gt; matter if it&apos;s a falling fourth or a rising fifth) DOES determine the<br/>&gt; fundamental tone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes very possible I&apos;m confuning names as I&apos;m not good with names.<br/>Though I don&apos;t mean merely the bass. Maybe I mean root as Billy described<br/>but then think E C A can have 2 functions (or more) in music, with different<br/>roots as I described before.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But I beleive I still have not heard a single difference tone, though<br/>&gt; have heard beat notes<br/>&gt; &gt; and it&apos;s not clear how they behave in chords, beleive someone is still<br/>&gt; investigating this<br/>&gt; &gt; on this list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You know what? Just for your experience, I&apos;ve made a recording of two pairs<br/>&gt; of interval progressions. The two recordings are essentially the same, only<br/>&gt; the first of them is &bdquo;dry&quot; and the second one has some reverb added. I think<br/>&gt; that you can know what I&apos;m talking about when you listen to these examples.<br/>&gt; Here they are:<br/>&gt; #1: <a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/7linyb">www.sendspace.com/file/7linyb</a><br/>&gt; #2: <a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/0hgkuu">www.sendspace.com/file/0hgkuu</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>I&apos;m sorry but I&apos;m at my girlfriends house where I can only access google /<br/>google mail but not the rest of the internet. (wireless paid internet that<br/>lets you search google but then you have to pay to access those pages,<br/>luckily this also allows me to see gmail.)<br/>I will check them on sunday when I get back home.</p><p>&gt; You make it sound nice and appear fairly logical.<br/>&gt; &gt; But how can you get these kinds of things from difference tones or beat<br/>&gt; notes?<br/>&gt; &gt; Since surely when you play the above things in some inversion or<br/>&gt; transpose a few of the<br/>&gt; &gt; notes by an octave for instance, you will get totally different<br/>&gt; difference tones / beat notes<br/>&gt; &gt; which would imply a totally different structure according to your<br/>&gt; reasoning above?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay, in case of relative frequencies of 5 and 7, the proper difference<br/>&gt; tone is 2 and the lower second difference tone is 3. In case of 7 and 10,<br/>&gt; they are 3 and 4, respectively. Is that such a radical change?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t beleive difference tones / beat notes are at the ground of music<br/>&gt; the way you descrbe<br/>&gt; &gt; it now and I dont find it a convincing appeal for the 7th harmonic.<br/>&gt; &gt; Maybe you are indeed on to something relevant to music in a way, I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know, but the<br/>&gt; &gt; way described now doesn&apos;t make me think this is a solid theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay, this is where we differ significantly. I couldn&apos;t agree with your<br/>&gt; view unless you gave me evidence why it doesn&apos;t work. For me it has always<br/>&gt; worked perfectly and it has confirmed lots of classical harmony concepts to<br/>&gt; me. And remember, this is not something I&apos;m making up somewhere in mi mind<br/>&gt; just to have something to say, this is my description of what I can hear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; These are real temperaments (tempered tunings) you&apos;re referring to right?<br/>&gt; &gt; Not pure JI?<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not interested in any tempered tuning, only in pure JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are apparently not thinking about one very important fact. The only<br/>&gt; musical concept (concerning common-practice music) which has its origins in<br/>&gt; 5-limit JI is the concept of single chords as usable musical elements. But a<br/>&gt; vast majority of properties in Baroque and classical harmony has its origins<br/>&gt; in meantone temperaments, not in JI, and people would never have found them<br/>&gt; meaningful and thought of using them in music if meantone temperaments had<br/>&gt; not been known of.<br/>&gt;<br/>I can agree only because of practical reasons meantone has been good but<br/>beleive the underlying way music works is JI, also for music written in<br/>meantone.</p><p>&gt; And then, there were many many harmonic progressions favored in romanticism<br/>&gt; which musicians would probably never have thought of if there were no<br/>&gt; circular temperaments. You can&apos;t directly say that every harmonic<br/>&gt; progression or structure has its origin in JI because it doesn&apos;t have. For<br/>&gt; most of Baroque and classical music, the model for harmony was the meantone<br/>&gt; temperament, which means that the comma we are tempering out here is 81/80.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes but just because they used meantone doesn&apos;t mean the reason meantone<br/>works isn&apos;t because of JI.<br/>Meantone I see as playing pure JI out of tune, and it has the great benefit<br/>for the composer that he/she doesn&apos;t have to think about commas etc, making<br/>certain music much easyer (and other music impossible, like arabic music)</p><p>&gt; But you can, of course, come up with totally different models for harmonic<br/>&gt; structures, once you choose a different comma to be tempered out -- which is<br/>&gt; exactly what I did about a year ago when I made &bdquo;Run Down The Whistle&quot; -- I<br/>&gt; think even you heard it then, didn&apos;t you?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>No I didn&apos;t hear it, can you send the link, I&apos;ll be able to hear it<br/>tomorrow.<br/>Marcel</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2009 2:46:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Marcel wrote:</p><p>&gt; Yes but just because they used meantone doesn&apos;t mean the reason meantone works isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; because of JI.</p><p>If you tak&eacute; the often discussed example of the &bdquo;C a d G C&ldquo; triads, you&rsquo;ll realize that you have to temper out the syntonic comma if you want to preserve at least one common tone in consecutive chords and you don&rsquo;t want to end up lower than where you started.

If harmony were based on 5-limit JI, then 18th or 19th century musicians would never ever have thought of such harmonic progressions. 12-equal is usable for both of these examples because it tempers out both 81/80 and 128/125. BUT .. There are lots of other commas and dieses which aren&lsquo;t tempered out in 12-equal and therefore they can be effectively used in music only if we use a different tuning than 12-equal.

B-D-F-A can be used as a &quot;true&quot; half-diminished 7th because it can<br/>cadence down a fifth, making B the root. It can also be a minor 6th chord, making D the<br/>root.

But can you give me an example of a 5-limit JI harmonic progression which doesn&apos;t include any commatic shifts and where the first and last chord are the same?

And if you<br/>want to use an equal temperament as a meantone, forget 19-tone; get busy<br/>with 31-tone. That&apos;s best for approximating 11-limit.</p><p>&gt; So then I thought, ok the 7th harmonic is notes outside a mode, a mode<br/>&gt; is 5-limit and 7-limit makes chromatic music.<br/>&gt; But then after working things out more I found chromatic music works<br/>&gt; perfectly and makes perfect sense in 5-limit.<br/>&gt; So then I posted on this list saying I don&apos;t know about the 7th<br/>&gt; harmonic anymore, can someone give an example that shows how to use<br/>&gt; it.<br/>&gt; Still haven&apos;t gotten an answer that makes me say a convinced yes this<br/>&gt; is the 7th harmonic in a musical structural / tonality way similar to<br/>&gt; 5-limit.<br/>&gt; That it has been so hard for others to give a convincing example makes<br/>&gt; me even more sombre about the 7th harmonic.</p><p>It took me *years* to bust my brain out of thinking in terms of 12 equal<br/>temperament. I still have trouble telling 7/4 from 16/9 and 9/5 and I<br/>have perfect pitch. (12/11 from 9/8 or 10/9 is no problem.) So it&apos;s a<br/>lot of work.</p><p>I personally use the prime 7 in a few ways:</p><p>1. as a basis for augmented intervals, if I&apos;m in a major key or mode.<br/>I&apos;ve discussed augmented sixth chords here; a German sixth could be 1/1<br/>5/4 3/2 7/4. Two chords could contain two 7-otonal ratios: the French<br/>sixth would be 1/1 5/4 7/5 7/4, and a chord with an augmented fifth and<br/>six I&apos;ve seen called a &quot;Russian sixth&quot; would be 1/1 5/4 14/9 7/4. I&apos;ve<br/>used a mixture of augmented and major in &quot;blues major&quot; scales such as<br/>1/1 7/6 5/4 4/3 3/2 7/4 15/8 2/1. Inversely, I can put seven in the<br/>denominator as diminished intervals and call these &quot;yellow&quot;: 1/1 16/15<br/>6/5 9/7 3/2 8/5 9/5 27/14 9/4 12/5 could be a type of maqam Saba Zamzama<br/>(replace 16/15 with 12/11 for regular Saba).</p><p>2. for &quot;hollow&quot; scales, including pentatonic. 1/1 7/6 4/3 3/2 7/4 2/1<br/>vaguely approximates slendro, and a lot of African music is often<br/>pentatonic. Again, this has blues connotations - blues came from Africa<br/>after all. (So I&apos;d recommend listening to Robert Johnson with your Harry<br/>Partch, and also Umm Kalthoum for Arabic music and 11-limit.)</p><p>3. in the resolved seventh chord, 1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4, which is a staple of<br/>barbershop music, which has been discussed here very recently. The<br/>conventional dominant seventh, which has 16/9 or 9/5 on top instead, has<br/>to resolve to something, typically a major chord on 4/3 in a V7-I<br/>cadence. 7/4 as a seventh should be understood as a &quot;subminor seventh&quot;<br/>in this context rather than an augmented sixth, so the ratio plays a<br/>dual role.</p><p>But anyway, you just need practice, and a lot of it. It&apos;s a major sea<br/>change from 12-tone equal, which is really a modified Pythagorean scale<br/>and not even 5-limit.</p><p>~D.</p></div><h3>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2009 8:17:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, 2009-02-24 at 10:06 -0600, I wrote:</p><p>&gt; And if you<br/>&gt; want to use an equal temperament as a meantone, forget 19-tone; get busy<br/>&gt; with 31-tone.

And if you<br/>&gt; want to use an equal temperament as a meantone, forget 19-tone; get busy<br/>&gt; with 31-tone. That&apos;s best for approximating 11-limit.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well first the 7th before I&apos;m willing to try higher primes :)</p><p>&gt; It took me *years* to bust my brain out of thinking in terms of 12 equal<br/>&gt; temperament. I still have trouble telling 7/4 from 16/9 and 9/5 and I<br/>&gt; have perfect pitch. (12/11 from 9/8 or 10/9 is no problem.) So it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; lot of work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I personally use the prime 7 in a few ways:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. as a basis for augmented intervals, if I&apos;m in a major key or mode.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve discussed augmented sixth chords here; a German sixth could be 1/1<br/>&gt; 5/4 3/2 7/4.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I have really strong reasons to beleive the german sixth is 1/1 5/4 3/2<br/>225/128.</p><p>&gt; Two chords could contain two 7-otonal ratios: the French<br/>&gt; sixth would be 1/1 5/4 7/5 7/4, and a chord with an augmented fifth and<br/>&gt; six I&apos;ve seen called a &quot;Russian sixth&quot; would be 1/1 5/4 14/9 7/4. I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; used a mixture of augmented and major in &quot;blues major&quot; scales such as<br/>&gt; 1/1 7/6 5/4 4/3 3/2 7/4 15/8 2/1. Inversely, I can put seven in the<br/>&gt; denominator as diminished intervals and call these &quot;yellow&quot;: 1/1 16/15<br/>&gt; 6/5 9/7 3/2 8/5 9/5 27/14 9/4 12/5 could be a type of maqam Saba Zamzama<br/>&gt; (replace 16/15 with 12/11 for regular Saba).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. for &quot;hollow&quot; scales, including pentatonic. 1/1 7/6 4/3 3/2 7/4 2/1<br/>&gt; vaguely approximates slendro, and a lot of African music is often<br/>&gt; pentatonic. Again, this has blues connotations - blues came from Africa<br/>&gt; after all. (So I&apos;d recommend listening to Robert Johnson with your Harry<br/>&gt; Partch, and also Umm Kalthoum for Arabic music and 11-limit.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3. in the resolved seventh chord, 1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4, which is a staple of<br/>&gt; barbershop music, which has been discussed here very recently. The<br/>&gt; conventional dominant seventh, which has 16/9 or 9/5 on top instead, has<br/>&gt; to resolve to something, typically a major chord on 4/3 in a V7-I<br/>&gt; cadence. 7/4 as a seventh should be understood as a &quot;subminor seventh&quot;<br/>&gt; in this context rather than an augmented sixth, so the ratio plays a<br/>&gt; dual role.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Do you mean that the 7th here doesn&apos;t need to resolve to anywhere?<br/>Yes I agree that if it&apos;s a true 7/4 I&apos;d expect it to be usable as a final<br/>chord.</p><p>But anyway, you just need practice, and a lot of it. It&apos;s a major sea</p><p>&gt; change from 12-tone equal, which is really a modified Pythagorean scale<br/>&gt; and not even 5-limit.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oh I really can&apos;t agree to 12tet beeing based on pythagorean :)<br/>I see it as 5-limit.<br/>But thanks for the advice and agree that the 7th must be a very different<br/>thing from normal music as we&apos;re used to.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2009 9:05:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, 2009-02-24 at 17:24 +0100, Marcel de Velde wrote:</p><p>&gt; I find 27/25 a perfectly good neutral second.

It no doubt<br/>&gt; works better with the a tense interval like 81/64 (and there<br/>&gt; may be melodic reasons to choose it also), but 5/4 would work<br/>&gt; too.  The grammar of the music creates the expectation that it<br/>&gt; must resolve, which is what musical dissonance is: an interval<br/>&gt; that must resolve.  Besides, since 3/2 is the most concordant<br/>&gt; of all intervals, any other interval is more tense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>I think one needs a bit more theory as to what dissonances are doing<br/>in music in the first place. If they were random dissonant sounds<br/>whose only function was to contrast with consonant ones then indeed<br/>the exact tuning would hardly be important, rather it would vary with<br/>the tastes of the performers.</p><p>However in classical (post-medieval) harmony one has the rule that<br/>*dissonances must be prepared* - meaning, of two notes sounding<br/>dissonantly together, one must be held over from a previous<br/>consonance. Notes that begin together must be consonant.<br/>This means that the values of all dissonant intervals in classical<br/>harmony are in practice determined by *differences between consonant<br/>intervals*.<br/>(In fact this is true in classic medieval harmony too: the &apos;imperfect&apos;<br/>consonances of thirds and sixths are determined by sums/differences of<br/>perfect 4ths and 5ths in a more or less fixed scale. However, there is<br/>no rule against unprepared dissonance.)</p><p>A very simple example: C-E-G -&gt; C-D-G -&gt; B-D-G<br/>(common notes from one chord to the next are tied over).<br/>The dissonance C-D is determined by the consonances C-G and D-G.</p><p>But compare C-E-G-G -&gt; C-D-F-A -&gt; B-D-F-G -&gt; C-C-E-G<br/>- now C-D is determined by the new consonances C-F, C-A and A-D: C is<br/>the dissonance here, the new tones D-F-A must be consonant together.<br/>So the second, as a dissonance in JI, is either 9/8 or 10/9.<br/>(You could ask: why must C-F be consonant? - the only answer I have<br/>is, because it&apos;s a fourth. In practice, a singer could not pitch F any<br/>other way than as a consonant - not necessarily just! - 4th from C.)<br/>Now in the third chord F is the dissonance - but where can the pitch<br/>of G come from? Certainly not from holding over D, then we would end<br/>up a comma flat (assuming JI consonances).<br/>The &apos;classical&apos; JI procedure a la Marcel would be to take G from C -<br/>and shift D upwards such that F now makes a dissonant third with D. We<br/>already know that tied-over *consonances* have to be shifted by commas<br/>to keep JI on an even keel, if we accept that we would be are safe<br/>home. One can perhaps justify shifting tied-over consonances in common<br/>practice by thinking that the singer or player listens some newly<br/>entered tones and adjusts the pitch to produce consonant intervals<br/>with them.</p><p>But can tied-over dissonances always be kept exactly the same pitch,<br/>as would be convenient for singers? Adjusting pitch, by ear, by any<br/>controlled amount to produce a *dissonance* with new tones is more<br/>difficult, if not impossible.<br/>Consider<br/>G-C-E -&gt; F-A-E -&gt; F-A-D -&gt; E-G-D -&gt; E-G-C<br/>how, in practice, can the 4th chord be tuned from the previous one?<br/>Marcel would no doubt want the middle part to find a G (C*3/2) which<br/>is dissonant with all of the previous tones A,D(10/9),F, and should<br/>cause the held-over D to get jolted up to (9/8)...</p><p>So even the classical principle that dissonant intervals are<br/>determined by tied-over notes from previous consonances, cannot be<br/>preserved in JI (assuming we don&apos;t accept comma-drift).<br/>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2009 5:43:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

Background: Modern standard note frequencies in Hertz &gt; (Hz [= vib/sec])<br/>&gt; Note the following approximate modern concert pitch levels of a<br/>&gt; chromatic scale beginning one octave below A = 440 Hz. Some qin<br/>&gt; players today insist that the first (lowest) string on a qin should be<br/>&gt; tuned to this modern concert C (262 Hz on this chart). However, there<br/>&gt; is no historical evidence to support this claim.&quot;</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; hmm, that sounds similar as my own old piano:<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; obtained from the 5ths-circle</p><p>Yes, probably.  Theoretical Chinese tunings have been Pythagorean for a long time now.  The imperial authorities specified Pythagorean tuning and you can understand that theorists weren&apos;t going to openly disagree with it.  There may be clues to other tunings buried in the literature but I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s any insight to be gained in digging them out.  Actual intonation, especially in folk music, is frequently a long way from Pythagorean, and has probably always been so.  There are plenty of flexible-pitch instruments (including the guqin) and the bureaucrats probably didn&apos;t know and didn&apos;t care what noises they made.</p><p>This is an interesting page:</p><p><a href="http://www.silkqin.com/08anal/intn.htm">http://www.silkqin.com/08anal/intn.htm</a></p><p>The author plainly knows what he&apos;s talking about, knows about just intonation, and has studied the primary sources.   Maybe he places too much emphasis on fixed intonation, but never mind that.  If anybody wants to study more there are references and more explanations on the site.  There&apos;s written music going back to the Ming Dynasty, and some more recent notation with exact pitch specifications.

Some of<br/>&gt; these, however, are actually alternate names for the same tuning. A<br/>&gt; single tuning can have several different names depending on which<br/>&gt; system the composer was taught and used; an additional confusion is<br/>&gt; caused by the fact that two different tunings can share the same<br/>&gt; name. For example, huangzhong diao c &#x8;i;&#x3;i&#x10;&#x18;h*?/<br/>&gt; i;&#x4;i&#x12;&#x1F;h0&#x3;c &#x9; could mean either &quot;lower first<br/>&gt; string and tighten fifth string&quot; (e.g. Shenqi Mipu, etc), &quot;lower<br/>&gt; third string&quot; (e.g. Qinxue Lianyao), or normal tuning (e.g. Mei&apos;an<br/>&gt; Qinpu). Another potentially confusing problem is the naming of some<br/>&gt; of the tunings which may have misleading names, like the ruibin<br/>&gt; tuning. Ruibin is the name of the Chinese pitch which Western<br/>&gt; equivalent is &quot;Fb&#x19;/&quot;, but that note does not appear or is used<br/>&gt; in the tuning, and so it is difficult to explain the logic in th<br/>&gt; e naming....&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That looks like a Wikipedia copy.

The months give a pitch ordering.  The ordering in the text looks like the spiral of fifths.  The numbers I take as string lengths.</p><p>As <a href="http://www.emus.cn/?9087/viewspace-6443.html">http://www.emus.cn/?9087/viewspace-6443.html</a> states, there are two subharmonic series fragments in these string lengths.  76:72:68:60 simplifies as 19:18:17:16:15 and 60:57:54:51:48:45:42 simplifies as 20:19:18:17:16:15:14.

Even if the tonic&apos;s different I don&apos;t see a 43.  Note however there are some numbers here linked to the Qin dynasty, with a 43 where Huaninazi has a 42:</p><p><a href="http://www1.ihns.ac.cn/members/dainianz/yueli.htm">http://www1.ihns.ac.cn/members/dainianz/yueli.htm</a></p><p>Here&apos;s the original text with some words translated.  The character &#x4E3B; means &quot;own/to host/master/lord/primary&quot; so this is the relationship between a note and a month.  The character &#x6578; could be &quot;to count/number/figure/to calculate/several/frequently/repeated&quot; so ths describes the numbers (presumably string lengths).  &#x4E0B;&#x751F;, for what looks like progression by fifths, could be &quot;born under&quot;.
