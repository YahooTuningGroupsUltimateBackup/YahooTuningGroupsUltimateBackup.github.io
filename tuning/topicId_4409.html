My reply is late because a holiday and other<br/>things came in between.<br/>For lack of a better one, the term pseudo-Myhill&apos;s property was<br/>chosen by me. Scales with this property can be considered<br/>normalized scales with Myhill&apos;s property which didn&apos;t have pitches<br/>in ascending order. With normalized I mean pitches brought within<br/>the octave (or other interval of equivalence) and sorted.<br/>For example take a 9-tone Pythagorean scale with generator 3/2.<br/>In Scala:<br/>PYTHAGOREAN<br/>9<br/>2/1<br/>5<br/>3/2<br/>0<br/>SHOW SCALE (shows pitches, they are not in ascending order)<br/>SHOW DATA (shows Myhill&apos;s property)<br/>NORMALIZE<br/>SHOW DATA (shows pseudo-Myhill&apos;s property)</p><p>So it&apos;s kind of a degenerate form of Myhill&apos;s property. In terms<br/>of intervals it means that interval class (generic interval) number<br/>one doesn&apos;t have exactly two sizes, but three. The largest one<br/>(in the example: 9/8) is equal to the smallest one (256/243) plus<br/>the middle one (2187/2048). Other interval classes don&apos;t have to have<br/>3 sizes.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div>
