I just started a couple of weeks ago, a<br/>collaboration with four other composers in other parts of the country<br/>(US) that is very similar to your concept. I call this &quot;The Creative<br/>Collective&quot;. We all use Sonic Foundry Acid as our common software<br/>program. It works in this way: At one of the collective member&apos;s<br/>locations a start-up track will be generated in Acid. The loops and<br/>Acid file is uploaded to a central server, where all the other<br/>members are able to go and download the file. Then each one of the<br/>members creates a folder of between 5-10 megs of loops to contribute<br/>to the original piece and their own unique recreation of the Acid<br/>Composition; this is then Zipped into a single file and uploaded to<br/>the server, where the other members can get it as well. This way we<br/>only have to pass the new loops to the server along with the new Acid<br/>file in order for each of the members to be able to play the entire<br/>piece as it evolves. The primary difference between your approach and<br/>mine, is that you do all the final mixdowns - but at each of the<br/>participating Collective member&apos;s locations is a full studio with<br/>everything needed to do the master mixdowns, so we decided that the<br/>location that generates the start-up track(s) will be the one that<br/>mixes down the piece. We hope to generate a CD in this manner, and so<br/>far the music is really coming along very well. I had thought about<br/>inviting this kind of collaboration in this forum as you have, but it<br/>would necessitate that all agree on some kind of common tuning<br/>structure - and there are issues with having the gear it takes to do<br/>this too. I have been reluctant to do this because I know that many<br/>here are very busy with their own research and composition projects<br/>as evidenced by all the music out on their sites and on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>. It<br/>is an intriguing concept though, and it is my hope that some of us<br/>might at some future time be interested in such a musical union.</p><p>Good Luck to you in this endeavor.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Jacky</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Manuel Marino&quot; &lt;vanethian@t...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But i&apos;ll soon represent a new band called &quot;The Virtual Networking<br/>Music<br/>&gt; Project&quot;... and there will be artists from everywhere in the<br/>world...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the songs will be made of midi pieces or waves sent my each of the<br/>artists<br/>&gt; interested, then mixed up in my 24 tracks digital studio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The idea is to create a place where all artists from all genres can<br/>meet and<br/>&gt; mix different styles and ideas... electronic and classical artists,<br/>rock and<br/>&gt; soul music, new age and ethnic.. and so on...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you interested?<br/>&gt;</p></div>
