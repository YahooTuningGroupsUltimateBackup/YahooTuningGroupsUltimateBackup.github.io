Perhaps some of the younger list members<br/>can say more about it.</p><p>It may seem from the above that I didn&apos;t enjoy myself...<br/>far from it!  After the inital acclimation period, where<br/>I really thought to myself &quot;this is definitely *not* my<br/>groove&quot;, I loosened up and danced a lot, broke out in a<br/>serious sweat, and really had a great time.</p><p>... Now I&apos;m praying that the impending blizzard that will<br/>reach Philadelphia on Friday night won&apos;t leave me stranded<br/>here, because I&apos;m ready to return to the warm California sun...</p><p>-monz</p></div>
