I believe<br/>also, from your posts, that you enjoy quartertone notation as a basic<br/>practice... Are you suggesting using BOTH systems??</p><p>But that would be a personal preference.  For me, I believe mixing<br/>the two different systems would be confusing to the performer.</p><p>In other words, for me, personally, there would either be<br/>&quot;quartertone +/- &lt;26&quot; notation OR &quot;12-tET +/- &lt;51&quot; notation, not both<br/>in the same piece...</p><p>But hey!  Some jazz musicians don&apos;t even use notation at all!  How<br/>about that!<br/>___________ ______ ___ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
