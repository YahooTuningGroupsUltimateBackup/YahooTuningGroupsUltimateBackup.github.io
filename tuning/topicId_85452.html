As an example, if you have 3/2 as your generator you then have a 4:5:6 triad, but if you generalize this and suppose the generator is a 11/6 in place of the 3/2, you&apos;d get a 12:17:22 &quot;triad&quot; (and a nice 7-note scale, as well).</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m intrigued but I&apos;m not sure I understand you correctly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you saying you can produce all triad for say 17deo or... say all just<br/>&gt; triad for say melodic minor 12 edo?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d be very interested in the 17 edo case.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Mon, Dec 28, 2009 at 11:01 PM, daniel_anthony_stearns &lt;<br/>&gt; daniel_anthony_stearns@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; for anyone who might be interested, several years ago i came up with a<br/>&gt; &gt; simple method to create harmonic series triadic identities and subsequent<br/>&gt; &gt; 2-D lattices given any, initiating and random 1-D generator.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Lately i was looking at it again, and noticed that it always gave results<br/>&gt; &gt; that were &quot;proper&quot; (according to Rothenberg, Balzano, et al).<br/>&gt; &gt; Though i understand how it works very well, I&apos;m not sure how to explain all<br/>&gt; &gt; this without confusion as i&apos;m not mathematically versed.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, should anybody be interested just ask for a random n-note scale,<br/>&gt; &gt; and i&apos;ll give you the generalizations resulting triad and scale starting at<br/>&gt; &gt; its simplest generator, as well as its possible temperaments.
