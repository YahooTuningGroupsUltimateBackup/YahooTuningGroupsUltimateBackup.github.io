Many people<br/>on this forum are better acquainted than I with most of them; I&apos;m not an<br/>expert on any. Such a temperament is typically constructed of at least<br/>one chain of tempered &quot;fifth&quot; intervals, the chains being anchored apart<br/>by integer multiples of a certain anchor separation increment. Among<br/>proportional beating temperaments already extant I happen to like George<br/>Secor&apos;s Hi-Tol 29. Which do you like?</p><p>Equal or proportional beating effects, played on instruments whose<br/>voices have harmonic timbres, including strings, woodwinds &amp; free reeds,<br/>can sound impressive. Synchronized beating really makes an unjust chord<br/>cohere! For the improviser or composer using such a temperament, certain<br/>keysig-specific moods &amp; colors are set by the beat rates, which are<br/>knowable in advance.</p><p>Mark L. Vines here, posting from near Austin, Texas, USA. Late in 2010<br/>through yesterday I either discovered, or else independently<br/>rediscovered, a few temperaments with equal beating septimal tetrads<br/>like 4:5:6:7 or 8:9:14:15 in some of their keysigs. I stumbled across<br/>their ingredients while seeking across the mathemusical landscape for an<br/>unrelated goal; my find a lucky happenstance that now has me pitching<br/>uncomfortably high above my actual competence level in the metatuning<br/>field.</p><p>Perhaps if I briefly describe three of these temperaments, you<br/>mathemusical metatuning people would please graciously tell me whether<br/>any or each of them has already been used or published &amp;, if so, by<br/>whom. They have, respectively, 10, 22 &amp; 27 tones per 2/1 &quot;octave.&quot; I<br/>haven&apos;t found these temperaments in the Scala archive but, then again,<br/>it&apos;s a big archive &amp; my search techniques could be faulty. If possible,<br/>please point us to published evidence of any prior use or claim.</p><p>Kindly also point out any mistake you may find in my work. Also, please<br/>forgive my D-centric notation systems, which do little more than crudely<br/>tag the notes according to the chain in which each belongs. Letter<br/>naturals, flats &amp; sharps are assigned only to notes from the origin or<br/>zero-anchor chain. Ups, downs &amp; their doubles, denoted by slash,<br/>backslash &amp; graphemic substitute characters, are assigned only to notes<br/>from corresponding nonzero-anchor chains.</p><p>In case I discovered any of these temperaments first, I refer to them as<br/>my ovovo temperaments, recalling their beating tetrads as I first heard<br/>them, in reed organ voice, rather like ovovovovovo....</p><p>We&apos;ll start with ovovo10.

Many people<br/>on this forum are better acquainted than I with most of them; I&apos;m not an<br/>expert on any. Such a temperament is typically constructed of at least<br/>one chain of tempered &quot;fifth&quot; intervals, the chains being anchored apart<br/>by integer multiples of a certain anchor separation increment. Among<br/>proportional beating temperaments already extant I happen to like George<br/>Secor&apos;s Hi-Tol 29. Which do you like?</p><p>Equal or proportional beating effects, played on instruments whose<br/>voices have harmonic timbres, including strings, woodwinds &amp; free reeds,<br/>can sound impressive. Synchronized beating really makes an unjust chord<br/>cohere! For the improviser or composer using such a temperament, certain<br/>keysig-specific moods &amp; colors are set by the beat rates, which are<br/>knowable in advance.</p><p>Mark L. Vines here, posting from near Austin, Texas, USA. Late in 2010<br/>through yesterday I either discovered, or else independently<br/>rediscovered, a few temperaments with equal beating septimal tetrads<br/>like 4:5:6:7 or 8:9:14:15 in some of their keysigs. I stumbled across<br/>their ingredients while seeking across the mathemusical landscape for an<br/>unrelated goal; my find a lucky happenstance that now has me pitching<br/>uncomfortably high above my actual competence level in the metatuning<br/>field.</p><p>Perhaps if I briefly describe three of these temperaments, you<br/>mathemusical metatuning people would please graciously tell me whether<br/>any or each of them has already been used or published &amp;, if so, by<br/>whom. They have, respectively, 10, 22 &amp; 27 tones per 2/1 &quot;octave.&quot; I<br/>haven&apos;t found these temperaments in the Scala archive but, then again,<br/>it&apos;s a big archive &amp; my search techniques could be faulty. If possible,<br/>please point us to published evidence of any prior use or claim.</p><p>Kindly also point out any mistake you may find in my work. Also, please<br/>forgive my D-centric notation systems, which do little more than crudely<br/>tag the notes according to the chain in which each belongs. Letter<br/>naturals, flats &amp; sharps are assigned only to notes from the origin or<br/>zero-anchor chain. Ups, downs &amp; their doubles, denoted by slash,<br/>backslash &amp; graphemic substitute characters, are assigned only to notes<br/>from corresponding nonzero-anchor chains.</p><p>In case I discovered any of these temperaments first, I refer to them as<br/>my ovovo temperaments, recalling their beating tetrads as I first heard<br/>them, in reed organ voice, rather like ovovovovovo....</p><p>We&apos;ll start with ovovo10.

Many people<br/>&gt; on this forum are better acquainted than I with most of them; I&apos;m not<br/>an<br/>&gt; expert on any. Such a temperament is typically constructed of at least<br/>&gt; one chain of tempered &quot;fifth&quot; intervals, the chains being anchored<br/>apart<br/>&gt; by integer multiples of a certain anchor separation increment. Among<br/>&gt; proportional beating temperaments already extant I happen to like<br/>George<br/>&gt; Secor&apos;s Hi-Tol 29. Which do you like?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Equal or proportional beating effects, played on instruments whose<br/>&gt; voices have harmonic timbres, including strings, woodwinds &amp; free<br/>reeds,<br/>&gt; can sound impressive. Synchronized beating really makes an unjust<br/>chord<br/>&gt; cohere! For the improviser or composer using such a temperament,<br/>certain<br/>&gt; keysig-specific moods &amp; colors are set by the beat rates, which are<br/>&gt; knowable in advance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mark L. Vines here, posting from near Austin, Texas, USA. Late in 2010<br/>&gt; through yesterday I either discovered, or else independently<br/>&gt; rediscovered, a few temperaments with equal beating septimal tetrads<br/>&gt; like 4:5:6:7 or 8:9:14:15 in some of their keysigs. I stumbled across<br/>&gt; their ingredients while seeking across the mathemusical landscape for<br/>an<br/>&gt; unrelated goal; my find a lucky happenstance that now has me pitching<br/>&gt; uncomfortably high above my actual competence level in the metatuning<br/>&gt; field.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps if I briefly describe three of these temperaments, you<br/>&gt; mathemusical metatuning people would please graciously tell me whether<br/>&gt; any or each of them has already been used or published &amp;, if so, by<br/>&gt; whom. They have, respectively, 10, 22 &amp; 27 tones per 2/1 &quot;octave.&quot; I<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t found these temperaments in the Scala archive but, then again,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s a big archive &amp; my search techniques could be faulty. If<br/>possible,<br/>&gt; please point us to published evidence of any prior use or claim.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kindly also point out any mistake you may find in my work. Also,<br/>please<br/>&gt; forgive my D-centric notation systems, which do little more than<br/>crudely<br/>&gt; tag the notes according to the chain in which each belongs. Letter<br/>&gt; naturals, flats &amp; sharps are assigned only to notes from the origin or<br/>&gt; zero-anchor chain. Ups, downs &amp; their doubles, denoted by slash,<br/>&gt; backslash &amp; graphemic substitute characters, are assigned only to<br/>notes<br/>&gt; from corresponding nonzero-anchor chains.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In case I discovered any of these temperaments first, I refer to them<br/>as<br/>&gt; my ovovo temperaments, recalling their beating tetrads as I first<br/>heard<br/>&gt; them, in reed organ voice, rather like ovovovovovo....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;ll start with ovovo10. Has anyone else used or published this<br/>&gt; temperament or a close relative already?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; nickname: ovovo10<br/>&gt; full name: vines_ovovo10eb5w6w7<br/>&gt; 10 key signatures per 2/1 &quot;octave&quot;<br/>&gt; chain link span 719.339096 cents<br/>&gt; 2 chains anchored at 0 &amp; 1 times 375.798846 cents<br/>&gt; 3 step sizes, near 102, 105 &amp; 137 cents<br/>&gt; 4:5:6:7 proportional beating in all 5 letter natural keysigs<br/>&gt; (C, G, D, A, E)<br/>&gt; 4:5:6:7 equal beating in 1 of those keysigs (D)<br/>&gt; 4:5:6 equal beating in 3 keysigs (C, G, D)<br/>&gt; 4:6:7 equal beating in 4 keysigs (G, D, A, G-down)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ovovo10<br/>&gt; keysig D4, edited Scala readouts:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0:          1/1           D<br/>&gt; 1:        137.121 cents   E\   En<br/>&gt; 2:        238.678 cents   E<br/>&gt; 3:        375.799 cents   G\   Gn<br/>&gt; 4:        480.661 cents   G<br/>&gt; 5:        617.782 cents   A\   An<br/>&gt; 6:        719.339 cents   A<br/>&gt; 7:        856.460 cents   C\   Cn<br/>&gt; 8:        961.322 cents   D<br/>&gt; 9:       1098.442 cents   D\   Dn<br/>&gt; 10:          2/1           D          1 octave<br/>&gt; |<br/>&gt; Base frequency : 293.0000 Hertz<br/>&gt; Beat frequencies of 5/4          3/2          13/8         7/4<br/>&gt; 0:  0.000:       -8.8709       8.8709       35.2150     -8.8709<br/>&gt; 1:  137.121:     -38.6990      9.6021      -38.6990     -9.6021<br/>&gt; 2:  238.678:     -6.9889       12.1293      48.8510     -10.1822<br/>&gt; 3:  375.799:     -44.4196      13.1291     -44.4196     -11.0215<br/>&gt; 4:  480.661:     -11.7097      11.7097      46.4842     -16.8501<br/>&gt; 5:  617.782:     -51.0832      12.6749     -61.3640     -18.2390<br/>&gt; 6:  719.339:     -9.2254       13.4406      53.3556     -13.4406<br/>&gt; 7:  856.460:     -58.6344      14.5485     -58.6344     -14.5485<br/>&gt; 8:  961.322:     -15.4569      15.4569      61.3597     -22.2423<br/>&gt; 9:  1098.442:    -72.5708      16.7310     -81.0012     -24.0757<br/>&gt; 10:  1200.000:    -17.7418      17.7418      70.4300     -17.7418<br/>&gt; Total abs. beats  : 317.6588     128.2929     529.3838     149.0729<br/>&gt; Average abs. beats: 31.7659      12.8293      52.9384      14.9073<br/>&gt; Highest abs. beats: 72.5708      16.7310      81.0012      24.0757<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now for ovovo22.

Fascinating, persuasive evidence you&apos;ve presented there. My<br/>experience agrees with you on a key point: equal beating makes beating<br/>more noticeable, not less. Seems highly probable now that your case<br/>against equal beating consonance has merit. I was only claiming<br/>coherence for eb, not full consonance, but the evidence you cite<br/>supports you even there to some degree. I&apos;d still commend the ovovo22<br/>temperament to your attention, however. Its best 4:5:6 major triads<br/>don&apos;t beat anywhere near as rapidly as they do in the other ovovo<br/>temperaments; equal beating in ovovo22 occurs instead in its best<br/>keysigs at 8:9:14:15, where the beating is quite audible in a<br/>synthesized instrumental voice of harmonic timbre.

Real-world ensembles (you mentioned woodwinds) do<br/>&gt; not have the intonation control necessary to perform in<br/>&gt; particular temperaments like this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * When auditioned with carefully synthesized sustained chords,<br/>&gt; proportional-beating makes beats MORE noticeable because the<br/>&gt; minima and maxima of individual beats often become aligned.<br/>&gt; You may like this but most find beating undesirable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * In one survey of major triad tunings, which included a<br/>&gt; variety of simple-proportion beat rates as well as golden-<br/>&gt; and silver-ratio beat rates (maximally irrational), what<br/>&gt; predicted listener preference was good old error from just<br/>&gt; intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * The above goes for sustained chords.  In polyphonic music<br/>&gt; at typical tempi -- even when synthesized -- the effect is<br/>&gt; inaudible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * Proportional-beating tunings are very seductive (on paper)<br/>&gt; to many tuning theorists (including myself).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>manuphonic &#x3C;manuphonic@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2011 4:09:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here (in cents) are the main ovovo tetrads of interest:<br/>8:9:14:15 equal beating from ovovo22:<br/>215.844629<br/>984.155371<br/>1095.439360<br/>4:5:6:7 proportional beating from ovovo22:<br/>387.517045<br/>707.922315<br/>984.155371<br/>4:5:6:7 equal beating from ovovo27:<br/>393.056073<br/>713.177722<br/>973.644278<br/>4:5:6:7 equal beating from ovovo10:<br/>375.798846<br/>719.339096<br/>961.321809<br/>Thanks for looking into this!<br/>==<br/>Mark L.

They can be of many different kinds also, and<br/>with various applications.<br/>I have been myself investigating in several hundreds of such equal-<br/>beating and proportional beating tunings, notably in very<br/>concentrated areas where I could experience, and several times in<br/>blind test situation, very different specific musical colors, even<br/>between very close generators. It&apos;s clear to me.<br/>Such extended fifths eq-b tunings you can find among those I included<br/>in the African, Persian, and Indonesian sections of the Ethno 2<br/>collection, and other eq-b tunings, available in my folder in the TL<br/>files. I invite you for example to check the Soria tuning (Persian<br/>folder), discussed in this list in its 17 and 19 notes versions, with<br/>a 705.5685 c. generator, that has triple equal-beating of fourths,<br/>septimal minor thirds with  7ths harmonics everywhere, and much more.<br/>I have a preference myself for the rational versions issued from the<br/>algorithm whenever possible, as the beatings of chords in different<br/>keys will be also in proportional beating between them, but both<br/>techniques have their utility.<br/>If I understand well, what you do here is different, I call it<br/>&quot;ribbon&quot; temperaments, that is the cumulation of 2 or 3 chains (of<br/>extended fifths, in your case), transposed by a specific interval,<br/>here a major third, tuned to be in equal beating with the other<br/>intervals ? I have to hear how it sounds, but that&apos;s a good idea.<br/>Of the temperaments you posted, two have known generators to me :</p><p>ovovo27 has a very famous slendro generator, that I used in the<br/>triple eq-b natt&eacute;.scl tuning (Ethno2 /Indonesian folder) ; it is also<br/>well known by the mathematicians in its complementary fourth as the<br/>first Pivot-Vijayaraghavan number, 1.3247179572447</p><p>ovovo10 is a declinaison of the same algorithm family, which I named<br/>myself Eronyme.<br/>Its fifth ratio is the solution of x^3 = 5x^2 - 8 and therefore has<br/>in addition of its eq-b properties another property (even more<br/>important to me), of differential coherence, as it is expressed by<br/>the algorithm. In case it is of some interest to you, it expresses<br/>the -c of a 23/16 in your temperament, which would be a major third<br/>above the #2 note (238.678 c.) - it&apos;s present in the harmonics and<br/>it&apos;s a super nice harmony. Because your tuning includes major third transpositions it could be pertinent with your temperament, however I<br/>don&apos;t fully understand the logic of it and why for example between<br/>notes 2 &amp; 8 you have 723.644 c., and not 719.339 ?</p><p>ovovo22&apos;s generator is not known of me. If you don&apos;t mind I will<br/>include it with your name in my (near to 2000 entries) fractal<br/>generators database. If you can explain it to me either offlist or<br/>not, you&apos;re welcome.<br/>What means &quot;ovovo&quot; BTW ?<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p><p>Mark L.

This gives you an idea of how close some would be. Would the use of rational versions accentuate the differences ? I would think so also.

My unscientific<br/>hunch is that periodicity buzz is caused by two things:</p><p>1) Overtones beating against other overtones (e.g. for 4:5:6:7, the<br/>third harmonic of 5 will beat against the second harmonic of 7, and so<br/>on). Or if we&apos;re dealing with a cluster chord like 8:9:10:11:12, the<br/>notes beating against each other.<br/>2) Nonlinear effects (perhaps DPOAE&apos;s, check them out on google) which<br/>cause additional harmonics to be generated so that the above can<br/>happen even when this is happening with only sines.</p><p>I think that what ends up happening in the case of &quot;periodicity buzz&quot;<br/>is that all of this beating ends up being in a regular pattern - e.g.<br/>a polyrhythm. Since the pattern is regular, your brain hears it as<br/>being highly autocorrelated, and hence it sounds like &quot;buzz&quot; rather<br/>than like nonsense.</p><p>A good way to study this phenomenon more might be to play around with<br/>just triads in really low registers; critical band effects down there<br/>will be amplified.</p><p>However, I&apos;m not entirely sure that this is correct; I think that<br/>something in the way that the brain performs its time-frequency<br/>analysis might be involved. There is a rule when it comes to doing a<br/>mixed time-frequency analysis on a signal, which is that the higher<br/>frequency resolution you have, the lower time resolution and vice<br/>versa. I think that the brain is performing the analysis in such a way<br/>that there is more frequency resolution at lower frequencies and more<br/>time resolution at high frequencies. This could be related to critical<br/>bandwidths in the ear as they change across the spectrum.</p><p>All in all this is a very interesting phenomenon, and I&apos;d like to<br/>mathematically tie it into equal beating if possible (they seem to<br/>share a common origin). But if I get engaged in any more research at<br/>the moment, I&apos;m going to disappear off of the face of the earth...</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2011 9:35:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jacques,</p><p>On Tue, Jan 4, 2011 at 6:37 AM, Jacques Dudon &lt;<a href="mailto:fotosonix@wanadoo.fr">fotosonix@wanadoo.fr</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since I could not find any information about what you guys call &quot;periodicity buzz&quot;, here I come with my request again :<br/>&gt; What do you understand by &quot;periodicity buzz&quot; ?</p><p>I responded in your other thread, but I&apos;ll repost here.

They can be of many different kinds also, and<br/>&gt; with various applications.&gt;<br/>&gt; I have been myself investigating in several hundreds of such equal-<br/>&gt; beating and proportional beating tunings, notably in very<br/>&gt; concentrated areas where I could experience, and several times in<br/>&gt; blind test situation, very different specific musical colors, even<br/>&gt; between very close generators. It&apos;s clear to me.&gt;<br/>&gt; Such extended fifths eq-b tunings you can find among those I included<br/>&gt; in the African, Persian, and Indonesian sections of the Ethno 2<br/>&gt; collection, and other eq-b tunings, available in my folder in the TL<br/>&gt; files. I invite you for example to check the Soria tuning (Persian<br/>&gt; folder), discussed in this list in its 17 and 19 notes versions, with<br/>&gt; a 705.5685 c. generator, that has triple equal-beating of fourths,<br/>&gt; septimal minor thirds with  7ths harmonics everywhere, and much more.<br/>&gt; I have a preference myself for the rational versions issued from the<br/>&gt; algorithm whenever possible, as the beatings of chords in different<br/>&gt; keys will be also in proportional beating between them, but both<br/>&gt; techniques have their utility.<br/>What a fascinating collection!<br/>&gt; If I understand well, what you do here is different, I call it<br/>&gt; &quot;ribbon&quot; temperaments, that is the cumulation of 2 or 3 chains (of<br/>&gt; extended fifths, in your case), transposed by a specific interval,<br/>&gt; here a major third, tuned to be in equal beating with the other<br/>&gt; intervals ? I have to hear how it sounds, but that&apos;s a good idea.<br/>&gt; Of the temperaments you posted, two have known generators to me :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ovovo27 has a very famous slendro generator, that I used in the<br/>&gt; triple eq-b natt&eacute;.scl tuning (Ethno2 /Indonesian folder) ; it is<br/>also<br/>&gt; well known by the mathematicians in its complementary fourth as the<br/>&gt; first Pivot-Vijayaraghavan number, 1.3247179572447</p><p>Took me awhile to catch up with you here. I&apos;d never heard of a Pisot<br/>number &lt;<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PisotNumber.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PisotNumber.html</a>&gt;  before. Now that<br/>I&apos;ve read a bit about them, I can say that, not only are the chains in<br/>ovovo27 made from links that invert the smallest Pisot number, but that<br/>there are also two other Pisot numbers with, respectively, 11/8 &amp; 13/8<br/>beating rates that are closely approximated in both ovovo27 &amp; ovovo22.<br/>&gt; ovovo10 is a declinaison of the same algorithm family, which I named<br/>&gt; myself Eronyme.<br/>&gt; Its fifth ratio is the solution of x^3 = 5x^2 - 8 and therefore has<br/>&gt; in addition of its eq-b properties another property (even more<br/>&gt; important to me), of differential coherence, as it is expressed by<br/>&gt; the algorithm. In case it is of some interest to you, it expresses<br/>&gt; the -c of a 23/16 in your temperament, which would be a major third<br/>&gt; above the #2 note (238.678 c.) - it&apos;s present in the harmonics and<br/>&gt; it&apos;s a super nice harmony. Because your tuning includes major third<br/>&gt; transpositions it could be pertinent with your temperament, however I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t fully understand the logic of it and why for example between<br/>&gt; notes 2 &amp; 8 you have 723.644 c., and not 719.339 ?<br/>In ovovo10, reckoning the chain of tempered &quot;fifth&quot; intervals from D at<br/>0.000, the &quot;fifth&quot; is so insanely wide that E (2 links after D) &amp; F (3<br/>links before D) converge. They&apos;re less than 3.305 cents apart, which<br/>means that a practical temperament can only use one of those two<br/>pitches. I chose to keep E at 238.678 cents because keeping F at 241.983<br/>cents would have left me with four different step sizes instead of<br/>three.</p><p>&gt; ovovo22&apos;s generator is not known of me.

If you can explain it to me either offlist or<br/>&gt; not, you&apos;re welcome.<br/>That would be a cool thrill. I made ovovo22 by tempering out the 64/63<br/>interval in such a fashion that 9/8 &amp; 7/4 would beat at the same rate,<br/>then approximating 5/4 so that 15/8 would have the same beating rate,<br/>choosing between sharp &amp; flat 5/4 approximations in order to have<br/>similar or slower beating rates neat 11/8 &amp; 13/8. I didn&apos;t realize it,<br/>but those 11/8 &amp; 13/8 beaters, found along the +2 anchor chain, are also<br/>close approximations of two Pisot numbers.<br/>&gt; What means &quot;ovovo&quot; BTW ?<br/>&gt; - - - - - - -<br/>&gt; Jacques</p><p>That&apos;s my truncated impression of the way 4:5:6:7 beating, from a subset<br/>of the temperament I now call ovovo27, sounded when I first heard it, in<br/>reed organ voice: ovovovovovo....<br/>==<br/>Mark L.

There&apos;s also some buzz on the upper<br/>8:9 in this example: <a href="http://lumma.org/temp/689.wav">http://lumma.org/temp/689.wav</a><br/>2) there could be some nonlinearity in your ear (DPOAE&apos;s) or in the<br/>speakers intensifying this, although this is for the moment<br/>unfalsifiable<br/>3) some kind of nonuniformity in the time-frequency response of the<br/>ear. I hope this isn&apos;t really the cause because things will get really<br/>complicated.</p><p>My initial analysis, from a time-domain standpoint, of the cause of<br/>periodicity buzz is related to this: as you add more harmonics<br/>together, with -NO- rolloff, the waveform changes from a single sine<br/>wave to an impulse train. That is, the waveform starts to look like<br/>this:</p><p>_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_</p><p>Where f(t)=0 at all values of t except for integer multiples of the<br/>period, where it is infinite.</p><p>I was actually taught that this waveform is called &quot;buzz.&quot; It&apos;s pretty<br/>harsh.

There can be bi-omissions, multi-omissions etc.<br/>These buzzes are subharmonics, and that&apos;s also what the tibetan monks use in the Gyuto or Gyume styles of chanting, as well as the Tuva shepards in their &quot;Kaarjira&quot; singing style (have you heard that CD where a very young boy seems to have the voice of a huge geant), etc..<br/>You were also talking about harmonic polyrhythms generating periodicity buzz, that works also (that what I&apos;ve been experimenting since my very first photosonic disks) : any accerated rhythm has its own timbre, and not only periodic rhythms but also semi-periodic, composite waveforms, MOS, fractal rhythms, etc.<br/>You also made the hypothesis that equal or proportional beating wether in triads or tetrads would be a possible cause, I also experimented they can have periodicity buzz, but could it be a cause I don&apos;t know, it has to be verified.<br/>Then we heard different examples that were pointed out as &quot;periodicity buzz&quot;, but could be simply explained by virtual fundamental or by difference tones generation.<br/>My suggestion is that &quot;periodicity buzz&quot;, if we strictly stick to what the words mean, covers all these phenomenas.<br/>Unless this term has been used before in musical acoustics in a more special way, but I didn&apos;t find it - by googling it the only pertinent pages it refers to (or trying to be pertinent !) are from the Tuning List.<br/>Let&apos;s hope this &quot;buzz&quot; arrives to a satisfying ketchup... :)<br/>- - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p><p>Mike wrote :</p><p>&gt; My initial analysis, from a time-domain standpoint, of the cause of<br/>&gt; periodicity buzz is related to this: as you add more harmonics<br/>&gt; together, with -NO- rolloff, the waveform changes from a single sine<br/>&gt; wave to an impulse train. That is, the waveform starts to look like<br/>&gt; this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where f(t)=0 at all values of t except for integer multiples of the<br/>&gt; period, where it is infinite.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was actually taught that this waveform is called &quot;buzz.&quot; It&apos;s pretty<br/>&gt; harsh. Here are some examples:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/441HzBuzz.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/441HzBuzz.wav</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/220.5HzBuzz.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/220.5HzBuzz.wav</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25HzBuzz.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25HzBuzz.wav</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125HzBuzz.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125HzBuzz.wav</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625HzBuzz.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625HzBuzz.wav</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s the last one again, but only with sines being added up to &gt; 2756.25 Hz:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625HzIncompleteBuzz.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625HzIncompleteBuzz.wav</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note the harmonic ringing out on top. Believe it or not, this sine<br/>&gt; wave isn&apos;t louder than any of the others - I simply just made the<br/>&gt; algorithm stop adding cosines after 2756.25 Hz. There is no actual<br/>&gt; resonance at that frequency. It&apos;s simply that since I&apos;m not adding<br/>&gt; other harmonics above it, there&apos;s nothing to interfere with it at the<br/>&gt; &quot;sharp&quot; end of the critical band at that frequency, and you actually<br/>&gt; hear it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A more rigorous formalization of periodicity buzz would have to spring<br/>&gt; out of this.

Now imagine instead of<br/>slapping it with your hand you slapped it with an infinitely hard,<br/>infinitely dense object, and you&apos;d have the perfect impulse response<br/>(your hand is soft and compliant, so the high frequencies will be<br/>filtered out more with that).</p><p>A periodic impulse train is, in a sense, &quot;slapping&quot; this neurological<br/>filterbank with an impulse x times per second, and we&apos;re hearing not<br/>just a smooth VF, but a quick series of rapidly decaying VF&apos;s, which<br/>is periodicity buzz.</p><p>I&apos;m starting to realize that both this and the HE-filterbank &quot;harmonic<br/>laplace&quot; transform I keep talking about are related mathematically by<br/>something I&apos;ve seen in the psychoacoustics literature called the<br/>&quot;double critical band hypothesis,&quot; but I&apos;m not sure how to explain how<br/>without blasting the list with more obscure signal processing<br/>calculus. The general idea is that the fact that the VF&apos;s decay over<br/>time would lead to spreading in the frequency domain, which leads to<br/>another &apos;critical band&apos; (just like the damping of the hair cells in<br/>the ear leads to the concept of the first critical band).</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2011 2:31:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>OK, I&apos;m not sure how to make it flat, but here are some sines at<br/>different phases:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/567sines.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/567sines.wav</a> - all sines at phase 0<br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/567sines0-45-90.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/567sines0-45-90.wav</a> - sines at<br/>phases 0, 45, and 90 degrees, in order from lowest to highest<br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/567sines0-90-180.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/567sines0-90-180.wav</a> - sines<br/>at phases 0, 90, and 180 degrees, in order from lowest to highest</p><p>A graph of the three:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/sinesphase.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/sinesphase.png</a></p><p>I hear some interesting spatialization effects between the three sine<br/>examples, but nothing changing with the buzz.
