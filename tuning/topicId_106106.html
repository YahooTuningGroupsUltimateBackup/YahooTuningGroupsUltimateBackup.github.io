It is a tuning software can manage several event routes. So<br/>you can use as many synthesizers as you want. At least, you can change<br/>the tunings on the fly.</p><p>Some student has written some software using its kernel, Jack and<br/>Python. The advantage and disadvantage is that you would need another<br/>tool as synthesizer. Details can be discussed via PM.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lilypond output- This would be easy to implement and could produce<br/>&gt; &quot;standard&quot; notation, possibly with Johnston&apos;s accidentals, for<br/>&gt; Rationale pieces.

I kind of skipped over MTS because it seemed like an empty promise.
