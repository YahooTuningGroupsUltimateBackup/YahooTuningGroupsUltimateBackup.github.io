She<br/>had been a student of my grandfather, Max deLaubenfels, in Pasadena CA<br/>many years ago (in biology, not music, I hasten to add!).  At that time,<br/>I had been fantasizing about dabbling in tuning; I knew the basic math,<br/>but had not yet actually done so.  Tui was a major catalyst for me: she<br/>had composed pieces for two pianos tuned a quarter tone apart, and, as<br/>I recall, other microtonal works as well.  She was going to be doing a<br/>radio show in NYC and, when I said I was interested in composing<br/>something in 53-tET, invited me to do so for possible airing on the<br/>show.</p><p>So, I started programming for tuning.  I never did write the 53-tET<br/>piece for Tui, though: I quickly went for adaptive JI instead, and the<br/>rest, such as it is, is history!</p><p>I left Georgia in November 1994, and have fallen out of touch with Tui.<br/>Just before leaving, I traded my car to her for some, uhhh, sacred<br/>herbs.  Don&apos;t know if she&apos;s still driving it!</p><p>One day, Tui got an enigmatic letter from a &quot;B. McLaren&quot;, who I now know<br/>to be Brian McLaren.  She showed it to me, and asked if I thought it was<br/>from a man or a woman.  Some time if I find my response I&apos;ll post it (I<br/>speculated that the obsessive nature of the writing pointed to a guy of<br/>the male gender).</p><p>Tui has a very strong personality, which makes her sometimes irritating,<br/>but she&apos;s always thought-provoking and has much to offer.  I feel lucky<br/>to have known her!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=35521 href="#35521">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2002 6:14:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My wife and I just visited Tui at Camp Catawba in Blowing Rock NC.  We&apos;d<br/>seen her in mid-December and knew she had suffered a &quot;small&quot; stroke and<br/>a &quot;mild&quot; heart attack since then.  But we were saddened to see how<br/>tired she now seems.  Always a feisty woman (I&apos;ll spare the details of<br/>a flare-up last Dec. ;-&gt; ), she now seems to have lost a lot of that<br/>feistiness.</p><p>She&apos;s trying to hold on to hear the premiere performance of her<br/>&quot;Requiem&quot;.  Doug Miller, a professor at ASU in Boone, is working very<br/>hard to line up orchestra and chorus for this very challenging piece,<br/>and has spent many hours sequencing it movement by movement.  He&apos;s<br/>about half way through, and we listened to a CD of a synth playing what<br/>he&apos;s done so far.  The work is tremendous in scope, and IMHO wonderful<br/>music, howbeit written in 12-tET.  It is also extremely difficult, both<br/>rhythmically and especially harmonically, with huge dissonant chords<br/>occurring quite frequently.</p><p>(I&apos;m going to bug Doug for a copy of the MIDI sequence, so I can get<br/>my hands on it for 13-limit adaptive tuning.  It otta be wild!)</p><p>For anyone on the list who knows Tui, this might be a great time to<br/>touch base with her.  I have sensed that there may be some strained<br/>relations between her and some list member(s).  If that is true, this<br/>would be a good time to get past whatever it was, if you have it in<br/>your heart to do so.</p><p>She&apos;s at:</p><p>   Tui St. George Tucker<br/>   542 Rocking Horse Lane<br/>   Blowing Rock  NC  28605<br/>   828-295-3211</p><p>She sleeps fairly late and usually stays up fairly late.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
