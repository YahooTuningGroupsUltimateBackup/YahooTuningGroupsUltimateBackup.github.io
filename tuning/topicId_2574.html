Admins probably have better ways of<br/>verifying the truthfulness of such things than you do, and they<br/>definitely have better ways of disseminating the information than<br/>cluttering up all the mailboxes, mailing lists, and newsgroups in sight.</p><p>Not that you shouldn&apos;t do a little research on your own.
