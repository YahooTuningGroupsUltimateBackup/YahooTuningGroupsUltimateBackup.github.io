Efficiency measures how much of a scale you have to hear before you<br/>know what key it&apos;s in.  If a scale&apos;s modes were all very different, you<br/>wouldn&apos;t have to hear much to locate the key.  But having to hear less to<br/>locate the key also means there is more difference between all possible<br/>keys, right?  So this does mean that similarity of modes and similarity of<br/>keys are related.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
