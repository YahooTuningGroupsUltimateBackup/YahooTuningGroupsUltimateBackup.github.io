Whereas neither the diatonic nor pentatonic scales are improper in typical meantones.  So blackjack obviously isn&apos;t like the diatonic scale!  7 out of 12 and 21 out of 31 are both proper scales.  Most of the conflation in blackjack involves rare intervals anyway, so 1/3 is over-dramatising.</p><p>&gt; i would also point out that once you&apos;ve reached 31-equal, there are &gt; *better* (simpler) generator-mappings to the 11 (9?)-limit complete &gt; chord than miracle -- namely meantone itself -- while meantone is &gt; undeniably the simplest generator-mapping for the complete 5-limit &gt; chord in 12-equal.</p><p>I don&apos;t like this argument -- I thought it was agreed that one equal temperament can belong to more than one linear temperament family.  As you&apos;re choosing a different sized generator, it&apos;s comparing apples and oranges.</p><p>Better mappings for the same generator are more important.  But it&apos;s what happens the other side of the equal temperament that&apos;s important. The alternative 5-limit mapping for 12-equal is better when you perturb it in the schismic direction, so 12-equal is one extreme of a typical meantone.  It also has a simpler 7-limit generator-mapping than typical meantones, but perturb it in the meantone direction and the typical mapping is still best, so 12-equal is one extreme of what counts as a meantone.</p><p>Various 11-limit intervals are conflated in 31-equal.  Perturb the miracle tuning towards 72-equal, and most of them will slightly improve in tuning (I think 11:9 is an exception).  So you might be able to find a more accurate mapping for the miracle generator, but only by going outside the typical miracle range.  Which confirms 31-equal as being one extreme of that range -- not the extended range in which melodic patterns are roughly the same, which is from 10-equal to 21-equal (or arguably from 10 to 31).</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3>Gene W Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2003 8:20:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham Breed &lt;<a href="mailto:graham@microtonal.co.uk">graham@microtonal.co.uk</a>&gt; writes:</p><p>{{Various 11-limit intervals are conflated in 31-equal.

So you might be able to find<br/>a more accurate mapping for the miracle generator, but only by going<br/>outside the typical miracle range.}}</p><p>The 200th row of the Farey sequence between 3/31 and 4/41 is this:</p><p>[3/31, 19/196, 16/165, 13/134, 10/103, 17/175, 7/72, 18/185, 11/113,<br/>15/154, 19/195, 4/41]</p><p>For 5 and 7 limit harmonies, we can slightly improve on 7/72 by using<br/>17/175 instead, which in fact I&apos;ve done in my Blackjack pieces. For<br/>11-limit harmonies, 7/72 is the obvious choice--using 39/401 or 46/473<br/>instead hardly seems worth it. The optimal range is closely focused on 72<br/>through the 11-limit, and beyond that we need to ask which extension of<br/>miracle we are considering.</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2003 12:32:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;</p><p>Paul!<br/>One could also keep it in JI and claim it was ET. kinda what happened with western music, or the<br/>music of the Chopi or Thailand.<br/>The thing is JI is more than ratios, it is a way of thinking about structure and organization. i<br/>don&apos;t know of any JI practioners who would organize their material in such a way, but time will<br/>tell.
