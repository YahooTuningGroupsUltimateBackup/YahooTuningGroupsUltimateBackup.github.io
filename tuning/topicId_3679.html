In short I try to empirically find<br/>intonations/tunings that best enable individual parts to both shine through<br/>the thicket _and_ reinforce the whole... For some this would no doubt seem<br/>like an endless process of chasing one&apos;s tail (to which I would offer no<br/>real argument!), but I really did grow into this quite naturally,*** and<br/>little else seems to quite &apos;fill me up&apos; the same way.</p><p>Dan</p><p>*Of which I&apos;d personally say that the long end solo on &quot;Not Even Love&quot; is a<br/>good example. (Not a &quot;good example&quot; of either 20-tET or good in the broad<br/>sense -- but a &quot;good example&quot; in the sense of me _using_ 20-tET, and being<br/>quite happy with the results...)</p><p>**FWIW I&apos;d like to offer a personal comment (or opinion) on the<br/>term/definition polymicrotonality found at Joe Monzo&apos;s excellent (and much<br/>needed) &quot;Dictionary of tuning terms&quot;:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/index.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/index.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>I personally would prefer terminology (if indeed any terminology is really<br/>necessary here) something along the lines of poly-intonation, or<br/>mixed-intonation... It just seems to me that those (types of) terms would<br/>not figuratively (nor conceptually) &apos;exclude&apos; combining 12-tET with any<br/>other non 12-tET intonation system... In this context, polymicrotonality<br/>seems (to me) sort of like calling polymeters: poly&apos;odd&apos;meters - inasmuch<br/>as it  tends towards certain (unintended) figurative and conceptual<br/>misnomers.</p><p>***And I was also most certainly swayed by the &apos;poly-everything&apos; influence<br/>of Charles Ives.</p></div>
