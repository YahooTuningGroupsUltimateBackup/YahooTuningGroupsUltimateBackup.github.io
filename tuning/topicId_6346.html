If you&apos;ve ever looked at the zone tuning for a sample, it never has<br/>&gt; exact 0 offset tuning from equal temperament.  That&apos;s because most real<br/>&gt; world samples are never exactly tuned to 12TET and need a few cents<br/>&gt; correction.  When you apply the tuning template from one sample set to<br/>&gt; another, the correction factors never match.  Therefore, each tuning<br/>&gt; template created from zones needs to be customized.  Keep paper and pen<br/>&gt; handy, because you&apos;ll need to record the offsets by hand to add to offsets<br/>&gt; from 12TET.</p><p>Doesn&apos;t seem like a problem. Anyway most people in the 12-tET establishment<br/>(including within the synth companies) have weird ideas about what<br/>is &quot;in tune&quot;, so it may not be so bad to be able to have this level of<br/>access.</p><p>Tedious, but what the heck. Better than not having ANY microtuning<br/>capability, or being limited to 12-note tunings. What&apos;s the point of 12-note<br/>tables ? It&apos;s not that radical, you&apos;re still very tied to 12-tET, Pretty<br/>much only good for what are different *shades* of 12EDO.</p><p>Oh, I was going through some old digests scouring for info on something, and<br/>came across this :</p><p>G. Breed :<br/>&gt;&gt; What difference does it make how the samples are tuned?  So long as you<br/>&gt;&gt; correct for mistuning, there shouldn&apos;t be problem.  That is, record a<br/>&gt;&gt; sample as being Eb, 0.32 cents sharp of equal temperament, or whatever.<br/>&gt;&gt; It&apos;s really easy to work out the pitch of a sample: count the number of<br/>&gt;&gt; bytes in the loop.  Anyway, give us a sampler and we can tune the samples<br/>&gt;&gt; ourselves.  And a lot of voices will use square or sawtooth waves which<br/>&gt;&gt; can be tuned accurately.  This isn&apos;t a good argument for poor tuning<br/>&gt;&gt; precision, even if it is the argument they give.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>J. Loffink :<br/>&gt; Wavetable instruments use multisamples to map multiple samples at defined<br/>&gt; pitches across the keyboard.  If these multisamples are mistuned relative to<br/>&gt; each other by up to 1 cent, it doesn&apos;t matter how accurate your tuning table<br/>&gt; is, you won&apos;t be able to retune the multisamples to correct the errors<br/>&gt; unless your tuning table is specific to each multisample.  Now samplers<br/>&gt; don&apos;t have this problem as they all allow you to fine tune the pitch of each<br/>&gt; multisample.  Most wavetable synthesizers lack this ability.</p><p>Also : from digest #1438, A D. Finnamore post mentioning what he&apos;d like to<br/>see in a synth&apos;s tuning implementation :</p><p>&gt; 2)  Sample assignment (in the case of sample-based synthesis) by nearest-to-<br/>&gt; sampled-pitch rather than by note number.  This is the most sever problem with<br/>&gt; using Proteuses for tunings that don&apos;t map 12-tones-per-octave.  For example,<br/>&gt; 31-tET on a Proteus causes the lower tones to be pitch-shifted way above their<br/>&gt; sampled pitch, and higher tones to be shifted way below their sampled pitch,<br/>&gt; making most sounds totally unusable for most musical purposes - they just<br/>&gt; sound too bad for anything but getting a rough idea of what the tunings sound<br/>&gt; like.</p><p>John, does the K2500 have this capability ? i.e dividing up indibidual MIDI<br/>note no.s into zones &amp; retuning ea.</p><p>BTW, prices for Kurzweils are way cheaper in Europe for some reason.<br/>Look here : <a href="http://www.musicians-gear.com">http://www.musicians-gear.com</a> a Stuttgart based retailer.<br/>And even here : <a href="http://www.kurzweil-europe.de/">http://www.kurzweil-europe.de/</a></p><p>I just hope they done *fix&quot; it, atleast not until I own one ;-)<br/>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>To get to the 2nd part of the subject line :</p><p>The E-mu samplers allow you to velocity switch between different tunings,<br/>simply by tuning ea. layer differently. The ESI&apos;s have 2 layers, the E<br/>series has 32.</p><p>The velocity switching trick may be the key to achieving dynamic intonation<br/>in performance using MIDI controller instruments. Damn the pitchbends !</p><p>Anyone here playing around with this ?</p><p>- Drew</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Bid and sell for free at <a href="http://auctions.yahoo.com">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=6362 href="#6362">ðŸ”—</a>Jim Savage &#x3C;waldpond@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/1999 10:11:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Another option for tuning is to use a softsynth.  For example, I use Reality<br/>which enables the user to specifiy up to 3 or 4 midi controller numbers<br/>(user&apos;s choice which) to change the fine tuning with 1 cent resolution.<br/>Each controller has the range the controller changes tuning by specifiable<br/>by the user.</p><p>Then one just needs something which can calculate the appropriate tuning and<br/>send the MIDI controller value(s) before each note.  I use Logic Audio,<br/>whose environments enable one to program just about anything (but it&apos;s in a<br/>data flow language).  MAX is similar I believe, but I don&apos;t have any<br/>experience with it.  I don&apos;t know CSound, but there&apos;s probably C based or<br/>similar programs that can do the real time calculations as well.</p><p>Tto me, this approach seems much better than tuning tables for at least some<br/>applications such as flexible tuning.  It&apos;s easy to have held notes shifting<br/>on the fly while you play.  :))   And I like having the pitch bend<br/>controller free to use so one can bend notes while playing in some weird tuning.</p><p>Just my 2 cents worth in case anybody&apos;s interested.</p><p>Jim Savage</p></div>
