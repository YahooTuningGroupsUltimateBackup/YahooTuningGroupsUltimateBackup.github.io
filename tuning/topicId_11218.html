I was thinking too much in<br/>terms of a fixed key, whereas a musical style which calls for efficiency<br/>(in contrast to stability) is one which is more likely to frequently<br/>modulate between keys of the same scale.  The quality of the efficient<br/>scale is not the ability to establish the key with the fewest possible<br/>notes, but the ability to use the greater part of the scale without being<br/>redundant in terms of key information.  This explains why Bach pieces (as<br/>examples of a style which exploits the properties of an efficient scale)<br/>need to modulate before the end of the eighth bar: once the melody has<br/>exhausted the key information it needs to move forward on pain of redundancy.<br/>&#x9;Of course, scales like 42222, although efficient in theory, are so<br/>unstable that they aren&apos;t heard as unique scales (42222 sounds like a whole<br/>tone scale with one note unplayed), and key information doesn&apos;t apply when<br/>the scale itself can&apos;t be established</p><p>&#x9;I&apos;m not sure about your point on perfectly symmetrical scales, though:<br/>&gt;In fact, since sufficient sets are not defined for scales with perfect<br/>&gt;modal symmetry (like the whole tone scale), neither is efficiency defined,<br/>&gt;and I can see an argument for calling it zero in these cases.  But by R.&apos;s<br/>&gt;reasoning (above), 1.0 is probably more intuitive: seeing efficiency as how<br/>&gt;much work the melody will have to do to fix the tonic.</p><p>R. lists the efficiency of these scales as 1/n, which is correct according<br/>to his equation if any one note of the scale is a sufficient set.  This<br/>makes sense because any note of, say, the whole tone scale C D E F# G# A#<br/>distinguishes it from C# D# F G A B.  That&apos;s to say nothing about the<br/>_tonic_, however, but tonality is a different and more involed topic (a<br/>sufficient set for C major is also a sufficient set for A natural minor).<br/>I can see the argument for saying that &quot;sufficient sets of the 12-t scale&quot;<br/>is undefined, but to rate this scale high in effiency classes it with the<br/>diatonic and anhemitonic pentatonics scale as high stability + high<br/>efficiency, whereas they clearly belong in the high stability + low<br/>efficiency class.  I think you have to say that one note of the 12-t scale<br/>distinguishes it from a 12-t scale at a different pitch level as a<br/>semantical justification for defining a sufficient set for it.</p><p>jason</p></div><h3><a id=11231 href="#11231">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2000 8:19:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;The quality of the efficient scale is not the ability to establish the key<br/>&gt;with the fewest possible notes, but the ability to use the greater part of<br/>&gt;the scale without being redundant in terms of key information.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m not sure about your point on perfectly symmetrical scales, though:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;In fact, since sufficient sets are not defined for scales with perfect<br/>&gt;&gt;modal symmetry (like the whole tone scale), neither is efficiency defined,<br/>&gt;&gt;and I can see an argument for calling it zero in these cases.
