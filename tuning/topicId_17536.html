Contrary to assertions posted<br/>last year, recent research demonstrated W. was proud and confident of his<br/>chromatic tuning, and that it was widely used throughout central Germany.</p><p>Last year it was postulated incorrectly that W. offered 12-tET as an<br/>alternative tuning in his &quot;Short Lesson and Addition, how one can tune and<br/>temper well a clavier&quot; which was tagged to his &quot;The most necessary<br/>Observations and Rules How the Bassus Continuus Or Thoroughbass can be well<br/>treated And each who has just a little knowledge of music and the clavier can<br/>learn it on his own.&quot;</p><p>This pamphlet was written for a green beginner.  In it, W. suggests as a<br/>start a rough tuning of 12 equally sized fifths, only to give further<br/>directions for fine tuning well-tempered.  After first making a joke at the<br/>funny sound of the word the Dutch use for the comma, he writes that he<br/>doesn&apos;t want to talk about the comma because it is complicated.  W. referred<br/>instead to his previously published monochords engraved in his &quot;Musical<br/>Temperament&quot; for further details.</p><p>Werckmeister never endorsed equal temperament as an alternative to his<br/>previously published monochords engraved in &quot;Musical Temperament&quot; (1691).</p><p>Even the posthumously published &quot;Musical Paradox&quot; (1707), published by W.&apos;s<br/>children to get some money, refers to &quot;Musical Temperament&quot; for temperament<br/>specifics.  In fact, most every work specifies &quot;Musical Temperament&quot; for<br/>further interest in temperament.  This is the reason that the 2nd edition of<br/>W.&apos;s &quot;Orgel-Probe&quot; left tuning specifics out.  It is because W. has begun<br/>what would become a tradition of referring to others books he had written for<br/>further examination.  Clearly he wanted all his books to be of continuous<br/>value, and to be purchased.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=17537 href="#17537">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>1/15/2001 9:10:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Johnny,</p><p>Thanks for the reports of your investigations about Werckmeister.<br/>Since I still haven&apos;t read the original text of Musikalische<br/>Paradoxal-Discourse myself and you have done so much research,<br/>I would be inclined to take your word for it, if not for the fact<br/>that Werckmeister compared equal temperament to true Christianity<br/>in this book.
