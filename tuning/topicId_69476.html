 i&apos;d like to make a<br/>few clarifications.  first of all, a caveat: you are all a specialist<br/>audience, whereas in general, i intend my podcasts for a general<br/>audience.  that may be why some of you found it dissapointing from the<br/>point of view of theory.</p><p>i am not against theory at all.  i am simply against a certain kind of<br/>theory, and a certain kind of approach, which puts theory first and<br/>practice second.  i can tell you from personal experience: it is<br/>impossible to learn to reproduce the variety of microtones present in<br/>arabic music without the aid of MELODY.  melody is the key to those<br/>intonations--and i can tell you, as you probably observed from the<br/>podcast, those individual E notes were extracted from melody segments.<br/>  there is no way i could make that demonstration without the use of<br/>typical melodies from each maqam.</p><p>therefore, what i oppose is:<br/>1. the attempt to classify notes independently from melody.<br/>2. the attempt to fit an explanation of the tuning of notes into some<br/>kind of equal-tempered system<br/>3.  the attempt to squeeze the actual practice of intonations into a<br/>system which is *supposedly* more rational, but in actual fact is<br/>simply less accurate, or misses the point entirely.</p><p>let me address 2 &amp; 3.  there is no basis for an equal-tempered system<br/>in arabic music.  fourths and fifths are generally pure (with some<br/>exceptions--but those exceptions are much like the other microtones,<br/>inflectional lowerings and raisings with a specific affect--you will<br/>notice in the Jiharkah example I give, that the fourth note (F) is<br/>very close to the third note, and considerably lower than a perfect<br/>fourth above C), and hence the whole step in many positions in a maqam<br/>is usually a pure pythagorean 9/8 wholestep.  so any theoretical<br/>position which starts from assuming some kind of equal divisions<br/>misses the most basic structural elements of tuning a maqam.</p><p>second, what i object to most strenuously is the procrustean-bed<br/>approach of much theory.  because a system says that a note should<br/>occur at such-and-such a position, we therefore force its tuning to<br/>fit the system.  much of the approach of early-twentieth century<br/>theorists has been in this vein, and despite the fact that in certain<br/>areas of academia there have been various shifts in the meaning of<br/>systems &amp; theoretical systems, it seems to me that music theory has<br/>stagnated philosophically--and in particular theoretical approaches to<br/>arabic music have not developed much at all.  if you do a web search<br/>on microtones on arabic music, &amp; if you look on wikipedia (i and a few<br/>other maqam experts are attempting to revise it), you will find<br/>copious assertions that arabic music uses a 24-tone system.</p><p>the other problem, i&apos;ll mention in passing, with the 24-note system,<br/>is that it, like other equal tempered systems, makes the assumption<br/>that all keys are equal, and should be treated equally.  just as this<br/>wasn&apos;t true in 15th century western music, it isn&apos;t true in arabic<br/>music.  in actual practice, not all notes have the same degree of<br/>microtonal diversity.  you&apos;ll find as many different A&apos;s, B&apos;s, and F&apos;s<br/>  as E&apos;s, but not as many G&apos;s, C&apos;s, or D&apos;s.  an equal tempered system<br/>misses this entirely, and, for the sake of an internally consistent<br/>theory, forces arabic music into something that doesn&apos;t fit it.</p><p>so the comma system is equally problematic for all the reasons<br/>mentioned above.</p><p>again, as i pointed out in the podcast, the different microtones are<br/>not equal distances apart from each other.  in trying to force them<br/>into some kind of equal-division system, we miss what they really are.<br/>  instead of trying to make the microtones used in arabic music fit<br/>some kind of system, a theoretical system should be an EXPLANATION of<br/>why certain intonations are used--and should be based on the actual<br/>practice of real musicians.</p><p>in fact, i don&apos;t see any ideas in music theory which really fit the<br/>maqam system as i understand it.  i think a more fruitful approach to<br/>developing a theory could probably be found through linguistics,<br/>dialect-ology, or semiology.</p><p>before i go on with what i mean by this, i want to clarify something:<br/>the intonations for most of these notes exist in some kind of a range,<br/>for most musicians.  which is to say, there is definitely an<br/>acceptable plus-or-minus region around the notes.  The sense of being<br/>&quot;in-tune&quot; in a maqam definitely has to do with rhythm, phrase<br/>structure, and the relationship with other notes.  so there is a<br/>flexibility with regards precise intonation.  the e-half-flat in maqam<br/>  Rast as played in syria is higher than that in the same maqam in<br/>Egypt, yet both are recognizable to any arab musician as RAST.  in<br/>fact, an arab musician listening to a turkish musician playing rast,<br/>will STILL RECOGNIZE RAST, even though he may think the third note is<br/>way too high for his taste.  even if the third note is occupying the<br/>absolute frequency position of a note an arab would use in an entirely<br/>different maqam, the arab will still recognize that the turk is<br/>playing RAST.</p><p>one of the listeners on this list commented that the difference<br/>between my bayati &amp; rast E-half-flats may have had to do with<br/>differences in room resonance--a very good observation.  a different<br/>musician might play the bayati and rast e-half-flats more differently;<br/>i suspect the similarity in my playing of those two notes has to do<br/>with the mid-20th century egyptian repertory i&apos;ve been focusing on<br/>heavily over the last year.  when i was more concentrated on earlier<br/>repertory, and syrian repertory, i suspect my bayati and rast<br/>e-half-flats were more different.</p><p>my point is, however, that each of these different E&apos;s is recognizable<br/>as a distinct KIND of note, even if the range of acceptable intonation<br/>for that note overlaps with others.  because of the melodic &amp;<br/>inflectional relationships with the surrounding notes, each E, in each<br/>different maqam I played, has a distinctly different character.</p><p>this is why i bring up the study of dialects and linguistics.  to me,<br/>the different Es are like different phonemes within the language.  as<br/>any linguist will tell you, actual speech doesn&apos;t divide neatly into<br/>phonemes--but the human ear hears them anyway, **even when they aren&apos;t<br/>actually there.**  units of meaning &amp; units of sound overlap, and are<br/>not necessarily easy to separate out.</p><p>i&apos;m not going to get too much into that right now... but as a<br/>practitioner and listener to arabic music, it is clear to me that<br/>those different E&apos;s function like units of language--they have<br/>different meanings.  and, furthermore, the basic units of maqam<br/>language are not NOTES, they are the small phrases out of which larger<br/>phrases and melodies are built.  these different E&apos;s acquire their<br/>&quot;meaning&quot; through their relationship and place in those phrases.</p><p>therefore, an approach to microtonal theory which focuses exclusively<br/>on the absolute intonation of notes misses the boat entirely.  that&apos;s<br/>why i&apos;m so against it--not because i think theory is bad, but because<br/>i think this approach to theory is completely misguided.</p><p>you must realize that thousands of arab musicians may have no idea<br/>about the frequencies of the different notes they use--just as<br/>billions of speakers of the worlds languages can&apos;t tell you about the<br/>frequency ratios present in their speech, or in the overtone series of<br/>the vowels they use.  but everybody can tell you from what geographic<br/>region a certain vowel comes from, when they hear it in the actual<br/>speech of a person speaking in this dialect or that.</p><p>that identifiability of exact frequencies by the ear as pertaining to<br/>certain meanings/certain regions/certain other characteristics of<br/>language, is what is mirrored in the maqam system.</p><p>arab musicians learn those notes as part of phrases, as part of<br/>maqams.  therefore, we shouldn&apos;t study them apart from those maqams<br/>and phrases.</p><p>there is yet another element to all of this, which most theorists seem<br/>to have missed.  the theory of intonation in western music is based on<br/>the idea of harmony, or notes sounding concurrently.  in arabic music,<br/>there is no harmony, or none in the western sense at least.  the<br/>emphasis is on notes sounded in sequence.  and i should add, the vast<br/>majority (let me pull out of my ass the figure 93%) of melodic motion<br/>in arabic music is stepwise.  so a theory, which is meant as an<br/>EXPLANATION of the tunings of microtones in arabic (and other<br/>maqam-based) music must take this into account: what is the affect of<br/>a certain intonational difference between two notes sounded<br/>sequentially?  i harp back again to the idea of the AFFECT of an<br/>intonation, rather than simply its absolute measurable frequency, and<br/>remind you that the theory of intonation in the west is based on the<br/>PLEASING QUALITY of consonant harmony, and even of dissonance.  the<br/>intervals of western harmony have their attraction because we like the<br/>sound of two notes resonating together in integer frequency ratios.</p><p>again, this is a fruitful subject to explore theoretically.</p><p>so, in conclusion--i think that there are a lot of potentially<br/>rewarding theoretical directions to take regarding microtones in<br/>arabic music (and other maqam music, as well as many other genres of<br/>world music that use microtones--from blues to swedish fiddling to<br/>indian music), i just don&apos;t think that the theoretical approaches<br/>taken *SO FAR* are fruitful--a useless linnaen taxonomy of the<br/>frequencies of notes, forced to fit into an outdated conception of<br/>intonation, which doesn&apos;t really enlighten anyone, whether they be<br/>listener, student, or practitioner.</p><p>of course, my bias is towards practicality &amp; pedagogy.  as those of<br/>you who may have explored my maqam lessons<br/><a href="http://maqamlessons.com">http://maqamlessons.com</a> &lt;<a href="http://maqamlessons.com">http://maqamlessons.com</a>&gt;<br/>may know, i have found the phrase approach to be most useful when it<br/>comes to teaching people to hear the different microtones in arabic<br/>music.  it is important to be able to hear &amp; distinguish these<br/>different notes before we talk about them...</p><p>yours,<br/>sami abu shumays</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2007 11:10:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;sami_shumays&quot; &lt;abushumays@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; let me address 2 &amp; 3.  there is no basis for an equal-tempered<br/>system<br/>&gt; in arabic music.</p><p>If you divide things finely enough, you can always shoehorn it into<br/>an equal division.

If I use 12,000-tone ET, that&apos;s probably enough<br/>resolution.  But then one might ask, am I using all the<br/>notes?  Probably there is no correspondence to maqams and<br/>ETs, since there doesn&apos;t seem to be any selective pressure<br/>in maqam music for flexible modulation (since few of the<br/>instruments are fixed-pitch).  The qanun may be an exception,<br/>and I should study how they are used in maqam music.</p><p>&gt; second, what i object to most strenuously is the procrustean-bed<br/>&gt; approach of much theory.  because a system says that a note should<br/>&gt; occur at such-and-such a position, we therefore force its tuning<br/>&gt; to fit the system.  much of the approach of early-twentieth<br/>&gt; century theorists has been in this vein,</p><p>It&apos;s safe to say there are no 20th-century theorists on this<br/>list.  :)</p><p>&gt; it seems to me that music theory has<br/>&gt; stagnated philosophically--and in particular theoretical<br/>&gt; approaches to arabic music have not developed much at all.</p><p>That is regrettably true.  However, are you familiar with<br/>the work of Can Akkoc?</p><p>&gt; the other problem, i&apos;ll mention in passing, with the 24-note<br/>&gt; system, is that it, like other equal tempered systems, makes<br/>&gt; the assumption that all keys are equal, and should be treated<br/>&gt; equally.</p><p>One thing I noticed is that even your presentation talked<br/>about Es as absolute pitches, and scales as defining that<br/>pitch.  But I would approach maqams from a relative pitch<br/>perspective, unless in fact they are never transposed (and<br/>you seemed to say, near the end of the podcast, that<br/>hijaz could be played on different tonics).</p><p>Is there even a pitch standard in Arabic music (like A=440)?</p><p>&gt; in fact, i don&apos;t see any ideas in music theory which really<br/>&gt; fit the maqam system as i understand it.  i think a more<br/>&gt; fruitful approach to developing a theory could probably be<br/>&gt; found through linguistics, dialect-ology, or semiology.</p><p>Can Akkoc started by analysing recordings, and proceded<br/>with statistics.  Which seems like the right way to describe<br/>the intonation of free-pitch instruments from any musical<br/>culture, really.</p><p>&gt; my point is, however, that each of these different E&apos;s is<br/>&gt; recognizable as a distinct KIND of note, even if the range<br/>&gt; of acceptable intonation for that note overlaps with others.</p><p>Which is why, it seems to me, we&apos;re not talking about Es<br/>but about degrees of maqamat.</p><p>&gt; there is yet another element to all of this, which most<br/>&gt; theorists seem to have missed.  the theory of intonation in<br/>&gt; western music is based on the idea of harmony, or notes<br/>&gt; sounding concurrently.  in arabic music, there is no harmony,<br/>&gt; or none in the western sense at least.  the emphasis is on<br/>&gt; notes sounded in sequence.</p><p>Yes.

Obviously, there are differences of understanding among the prominent nations of the Middle East. Surely you will agree that a great many of these so-called Arabic maqams are developed in Istanbul. Therefore, Turks have as much, if not more, right to make claims of ownership for Maqam Music, which, in my opinion, is verily a cosmopolitan art.</p><p>  i am not against theory at all.  i am simply against a certain kind of<br/>  theory, and a certain kind of approach, which puts theory first and<br/>  practice second.</p><p>Without a viable theory through which the variation of perdeler can be explained, all methods of melodic teaching will remain arbitrary. Regional flavours will always remain, but a common resolution must be determined to account for all instances of modulations/transposition at every possible Ahenk (key).</p><p>  i can tell you from personal experience: it is<br/>  impossible to learn to reproduce the variety of microtones present in<br/>  arabic music without the aid of MELODY.  melody is the key to those<br/>  intonations--and i can tell you, as you probably observed from the<br/>  podcast, those individual E notes were extracted from melody segments.<br/>   there is no way i could make that demonstration without the use of<br/>  typical melodies from each maqam.</p><p>Are we to conclude from this statement, that your variations of pitch on E did not always correctly reflect the melodic practice? That you played them haphazardly or nonchalantly?</p><p>  therefore, what i oppose is:<br/>  1. the attempt to classify notes independently from melody.<br/>  2. the attempt to fit an explanation of the tuning of notes into some<br/>  kind of equal-tempered system<br/>  3.  the attempt to squeeze the actual practice of intonations into a<br/>  system which is *supposedly* more rational, but in actual fact is<br/>  simply less accurate, or misses the point entirely.</p><p>These statement seem to be in favour of 24-edo, which, as you have shown, is as incompatible with actual practice as the Turkish 24-tone Pythagorean system proposed by Yekta and later usurped by Arel and Ezgi.</p><p>  let me address 2 &amp; 3.  there is no basis for an equal-tempered system<br/>  in arabic music.</p><p>Oh yes there is: The influence of Mikhail Mushaqa.</p><p>  fourths and fifths are generally pure (with some<br/>  exceptions--but those exceptions are much like the other microtones,<br/>  inflectional lowerings and raisings with a specific affect--you will<br/>  notice in the Jiharkah example I give, that the fourth note (F) is<br/>  very close to the third note, and considerably lower than a perfect<br/>  fourth above C), and hence the whole step in many positions in a maqam<br/>  is usually a pure pythagorean 9/8 wholestep.  so any theoretical<br/>  position which starts from assuming some kind of equal divisions<br/>  misses the most basic structural elements of tuning a maqam.</p><p>Not necessarily so, as Gene has pointed out very well. I think &quot;generally pure&quot; is the keyword here, which sometimes sanctions tempering fifths and fourths depending on the Maqam.</p><p>  second, what i object to most strenuously is the procrustean-bed<br/>  approach of much theory.  because a system says that a note should<br/>  occur at such-and-such a position, we therefore force its tuning to<br/>  fit the system.</p><p>This is a most keen observation on your part. The result of that approach, if unconforming with practice, is the adulteration of many maqams, as has been the case with both Arabic 24-edo and Turkish 24-pythagorean theory. I wouldn&apos;t know about the Persians; yet, I suspect they are in the same predicament as we are.</p><p>  much of the approach of early-twentieth century<br/>  theorists has been in this vein, and despite the fact that in certain<br/>  areas of academia there have been various shifts in the meaning of<br/>  systems &amp; theoretical systems, it seems to me that music theory has<br/>  stagnated philosophically--and in particular theoretical approaches to<br/>  arabic music have not developed much at all.</p><p>Yes! Stagnation is the word. All progress in Maqam Music is coming to a dead halt because of theoretical conceptions hampering practice. Hopefully, I propose a model to get us out of this mess, which I shall present shortly.</p><p>  if you do a web search<br/>  on microtones on arabic music, &amp; if you look on wikipedia (i and a few<br/>  other maqam experts are attempting to revise it), you will find<br/>  copious assertions that arabic music uses a 24-tone system.</p><p>This whole deal of quarter-tones had done as much damage to Maqam Music as the &quot;commatism&quot; abound in Turkiye.</p><p>  the other problem, i&apos;ll mention in passing, with the 24-note system,<br/>  is that it, like other equal tempered systems, makes the assumption<br/>  that all keys are equal, and should be treated equally.  just as this<br/>  wasn&apos;t true in 15th century western music, it isn&apos;t true in arabic<br/>  music.</p><p>Nor is it true in Turkish Music, which also IS a branch of Maqam Music.</p><p>  in actual practice, not all notes have the same degree of<br/>  microtonal diversity.  you&apos;ll find as many different A&apos;s, B&apos;s, and F&apos;s<br/>   as E&apos;s, but not as many G&apos;s, C&apos;s, or D&apos;s.</p><p>That is to say, you will find that such ranges as &quot;segah to buselik&quot; and &quot;hisar to huseyni&quot; swarming with microtones in the form of pitch-clusters, whereas, perdes rast, dugah and neva are comparatively more stationary.</p><p>  an equal tempered system<br/>  misses this entirely, and, for the sake of an internally consistent<br/>  theory, forces arabic music into something that doesn&apos;t fit it.</p><p>The same is true for Turkish 24-tone theory.</p><p>  so the comma system is equally problematic for all the reasons<br/>  mentioned above.</p><p>Quite so, if we are talking in terms of 53-edo.</p><p>  again, as i pointed out in the podcast, the different microtones are<br/>  not equal distances apart from each other.  in trying to force them<br/>  into some kind of equal-division system, we miss what they really are.<br/>   instead of trying to make the microtones used in arabic music fit<br/>  some kind of system, a theoretical system should be an EXPLANATION of<br/>  why certain intonations are used--and should be based on the actual<br/>  practice of real musicians.</p><p>But this outlook is detrimental to the construction of such fixed-pitch instruments as the qanun. Surely sufficient detail can be incorporated into a voluminous temperament with which instruments like qanun may faultlessly accompany violins and ouds. This shall be demonstrated a little further down.</p><p>  in fact, i don&apos;t see any ideas in music theory which really fit the<br/>  maqam system as i understand it.  i think a more fruitful approach to<br/>  developing a theory could probably be found through linguistics,<br/>  dialect-ology, or semiology.</p><p>No need to go that far. Just lend an ear to what I have to say in a moment.</p><p>  before i go on with what i mean by this, i want to clarify something:<br/>  the intonations for most of these notes exist in some kind of a range,<br/>  for most musicians.  which is to say, there is definitely an<br/>  acceptable plus-or-minus region around the notes.  The sense of being<br/>  &quot;in-tune&quot; in a maqam definitely has to do with rhythm, phrase<br/>  structure, and the relationship with other notes.  so there is a<br/>  flexibility with regards precise intonation.  the e-half-flat in maqam<br/>   Rast as played in syria is higher than that in the same maqam in<br/>  Egypt, yet both are recognizable to any arab musician as RAST.</p><p>That is because of the wide relative frequency compass of the perde named segah. It is anywhere between 27:22 to 5:4 compared to perde rast (1/1). But why Arabicise Rast when it is equally renown in Turkiye?</p><p>  in fact, an arab musician listening to a turkish musician playing rast,<br/>  will STILL RECOGNIZE RAST, even though he may think the third note is<br/>  way too high for his taste.</p><p>Or vice versa, a Turkish musician can distinguish Rast in the hands of Arabic musicians although the third note of the scale is too low for his taste.</p><p>  even if the third note is occupying the<br/>  absolute frequency position of a note an arab would use in an entirely<br/>  different maqam, the arab will still recognize that the turk is<br/>  playing RAST.</p><p>That is because, the perdes (pitch ratios and ranges) remain the same (though fickle) no matter what.</p><p>  one of the listeners on this list commented that the difference<br/>  between my bayati &amp; rast E-half-flats may have had to do with<br/>  differences in room resonance--a very good observation.  a different<br/>  musician might play the bayati and rast e-half-flats more differently;<br/>  i suspect the similarity in my playing of those two notes has to do<br/>  with the mid-20th century egyptian repertory i&apos;ve been focusing on<br/>  heavily over the last year.  when i was more concentrated on earlier<br/>  repertory, and syrian repertory, i suspect my bayati and rast<br/>  e-half-flats were more different.</p><p>All I have to say at this point is, that I cannot understand how Maqam Bayati is performed without perde bayati by either Arabs or Turks, and how these two factions have come to possess a mutually exclusive understanding of it.</p><p>  my point is, however, that each of these different E&apos;s is recognizable<br/>  as a distinct KIND of note, even if the range of acceptable intonation<br/>  for that note overlaps with others.  because of the melodic &amp;<br/>  inflectional relationships with the surrounding notes, each E, in each<br/>  different maqam I played, has a distinctly different character.</p><p>As part of a distinct tetrachord, indeed!</p><p>  this is why i bring up the study of dialects and linguistics.  to me,<br/>  the different Es are like different phonemes within the language.  as<br/>  any linguist will tell you, actual speech doesn&apos;t divide neatly into<br/>  phonemes--but the human ear hears them anyway, **even when they aren&apos;t<br/>  actually there.**  units of meaning &amp; units of sound overlap, and are<br/>  not necessarily easy to separate out.</p><p>Ah, we have transcended the boundaries of the tangible to the metaphysical, which theory cannot cope with.</p><p>  i&apos;m not going to get too much into that right now... but as a<br/>  practitioner and listener to arabic music, it is clear to me that<br/>  those different E&apos;s function like units of language--they have<br/>  different meanings.</p><p>Which can very well be explained in theory through the employment of diverse microtones + alterations in a myriad of tetrachords or melodic phrases.</p><p>  and, furthermore, the basic units of maqam<br/>  language are not NOTES, they are the small phrases out of which larger<br/>  phrases and melodies are built.  these different E&apos;s acquire their<br/>  &quot;meaning&quot; through their relationship and place in those phrases.</p><p>Such as perde segah being performed lower during the cadance of the Maqam Ushshaq, or perde saba having the curious habit of frolicking about in Maqam Saba.</p><p>  therefore, an approach to microtonal theory which focuses exclusively<br/>  on the absolute intonation of notes misses the boat entirely.  that&apos;s<br/>  why i&apos;m so against it--not because i think theory is bad, but because<br/>  i think this approach to theory is completely misguided.</p><p>While acceding to your point that the idea of stationary pitch is detrimental to the general character of Maqam Music, we nevertheless need a solid system with which qanuns, for instance, can be manufactured!</p><p>  you must realize that thousands of arab musicians may have no idea<br/>  about the frequencies of the different notes they use--just as<br/>  billions of speakers of the worlds languages can&apos;t tell you about the<br/>  frequency ratios present in their speech, or in the overtone series of<br/>  the vowels they use.  but everybody can tell you from what geographic<br/>  region a certain vowel comes from, when they hear it in the actual<br/>  speech of a person speaking in this dialect or that.</p><p>  that identifiability of exact frequencies by the ear as pertaining to<br/>  certain meanings/certain regions/certain other characteristics of<br/>  language, is what is mirrored in the maqam system.</p><p>Simply because the ear recognizes the chain of relative frequencies which we call &quot;perdeler&quot; of Maqam Music.</p><p>  arab musicians learn those notes as part of phrases, as part of<br/>  maqams.  therefore, we shouldn&apos;t study them apart from those maqams<br/>  and phrases.</p><p>I agree that they should only be mentioned when divulging the structure of the Maqam in which they are found to occur.</p><p>  there is yet another element to all of this, which most theorists seem<br/>  to have missed.  the theory of intonation in western music is based on<br/>  the idea of harmony, or notes sounding concurrently.  in arabic music,<br/>  there is no harmony, or none in the western sense at least.  the<br/>  emphasis is on notes sounded in sequence.  and i should add, the vast<br/>  majority (let me pull out of my ass the figure 93%) of melodic motion<br/>  in arabic music is stepwise.</p><p>Neiterh Arabs, nor Turks, nor Persians, nor any other nation has a monopoly in what you say. We share a cosmopolitan art which is overwhelmingly step-wise melody-oriented.</p><p>  so a theory, which is meant as an<br/>  EXPLANATION of the tunings of microtones in arabic (and other<br/>  maqam-based) music must take this into account: what is the affect of<br/>  a certain intonational difference between two notes sounded<br/>  sequentially?  i harp back again to the idea of the AFFECT of an<br/>  intonation, rather than simply its absolute measurable frequency, and<br/>  remind you that the theory of intonation in the west is based on the<br/>  PLEASING QUALITY of consonant harmony, and even of dissonance.  the<br/>  intervals of western harmony have their attraction because we like the<br/>  sound of two notes resonating together in integer frequency ratios.</p><p>While Maqam Music enjoys a freedom of intonation due to being monodic, &quot;implied harmony&quot; nevertheless is inwrought.</p><p>  again, this is a fruitful subject to explore theoretically.</p><p>  so, in conclusion--i think that there are a lot of potentially<br/>  rewarding theoretical directions to take regarding microtones in<br/>  arabic music (and other maqam music, as well as many other genres of<br/>  world music that use microtones--from blues to swedish fiddling to<br/>  indian music), i just don&apos;t think that the theoretical approaches<br/>  taken *SO FAR* are fruitful--a useless linnaen taxonomy of the<br/>  frequencies of notes, forced to fit into an outdated conception of<br/>  intonation, which doesn&apos;t really enlighten anyone, whether they be<br/>  listener, student, or practitioner.</p><p>Bear with me a little longer when I say that I do not entirely agree to your preference given the need to implement the cornucopia of pitch ratios of Maqam Music on fixed-pitch instruments such as qanun and santur.</p><p>  of course, my bias is towards practicality &amp; pedagogy.  as those of<br/>  you who may have explored my maqam lessons<br/>  <a href="http://maqamlessons.com">http://maqamlessons.com</a><br/>  may know, i have found the phrase approach to be most useful when it<br/>  comes to teaching people to hear the different microtones in arabic<br/>  music.  it is important to be able to hear &amp; distinguish these<br/>  different notes before we talk about them...</p><p>But the whole notion of theory is reflected in notation, where micro-accidentals ultimately tell us which microtones to sound.</p><p>Since neither of the two current theories (Arabic vs Turkish) satisfactorily represent the vagrant relative-frequencies of Maqam Music, and since a solid tuning shall undoubtedly facilitate the employment of traditional perdes, I present a 79 Moment of Symmetry out of 159-tone Equal Temperament that I implemented on my personal qanun (www.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanun_%28Instrument%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanun_%28Instrument%29</a>) for your scrutiny.

Cf., Harry Partch, hahaha!</p><p>My own approach to tuning theory is based on the idea of intervals<br/>which fall into regions of various sizes and belong to &quot;character<br/>families&quot;. What defines the character mathematically, I don&apos;t know,<br/>and may never know. In other words, intervals are known by quality,<br/>not just quantity.

Are the fixed intervals appropriate in character,<br/>and do they mark the regions in which the flexible instrument moves<br/>well? If so, then it&apos;s not only a far sight better than 24, it would<br/>then be a realistic foundation for new musics coming from a maqam<br/>tradition.</p><p>The most important thing is: a fixed pitched instrument does not<br/>provide the &quot;right notes&quot;, if simply offers gracious points of<br/>reference.</p><p>Excellent lecture and musicianship on your part, by the way, thanks!</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3>sami_shumays &#x3C;abushumays@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2007 10:50:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; i can tell you from personal experience: it is<br/>&gt; &gt; impossible to learn to reproduce the variety<br/>&gt; &gt; of microtones present in arabic music without<br/>&gt; &gt; the aid of MELODY.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What if I only want to describe them, not reproduce them?</p><p>being able to reproduce them is an almost equivalent skill to being<br/>able to distinguish them, which is a pre-requisite skill before being<br/>able to describe them accurately.</p><p>let me give as an example, the chinese tone system used in their<br/>spoken language.  some of the tones are not easily distinguishable by<br/>non-chinese ears.  (as linguists are aware, many phonemes which are<br/>distinguishable by babies, cease to be distinguishable after a certain<br/>age, if they are outside the language the child is beginning to<br/>absorb).  not to say that non-chinese ears cannot ever distinguish<br/>them, but that to do so requires the input of at least a minimum<br/>amount of effort to LEARN to distinguish them.  that effort goes<br/>necessarily in conjunction with an effort to be able to produce<br/>them--as the ear learns very well by imitation, and learns to<br/>distinguish sounds not simply through differences in absolute sound<br/>quality (exact frequencies), but by PARSING that sound into relevent<br/>units of meaning (in the case of language, phonemes--which in actual<br/>sound wave patterns of actual speech almost never appear in the forms<br/>they would apear if pronounced separately).  the parsing and the<br/>producing go to a certain extent hand-in-hand.  though one is<br/>definitely POSSIBLE without the other, in practice it is necessary to<br/>develop both at once, because the development of one ability helps the<br/>other.</p><p>which is to say, my assertion is that the analysis/explanation for the<br/>different varieties of E in my examples lies in the meaningful<br/>relationship of those notes to adjacent ones; that each different<br/>phrase/melodic pattern has a different meaning, understood<br/>SYNTACTICALLY within maqam melodic development as a whole.</p><p>you cannot even begin to analyze the validity of that claim of mine<br/>(and i don&apos;t wish to assert that it is absolutely valid--i am posing<br/>it here as a direction for theoretical enquiry), unless you can begin<br/>to hear and feel the difference in melodic emphasis between, for<br/>example, the third note of rast (e-half flat, conceptually--and its<br/>relationship to the 2nd &amp; fourth) and the third note of jiharkah (a<br/>very low e-natural, conceptually--and its relationship to the<br/>very-close-to-it lowered fourth note of the scale)--to give the two<br/>examples i played in a more extended example at the end of my podcast.<br/> or the difference in feel between the low E-flat of nahawand and the<br/>high e-flat of hijaz.  you need to feel the melodic context of those<br/>notes, the energy those intonations give to phrases, the constant<br/>modal pull back and forth between notes as embodied in typical<br/>melodies--in order to grapple with my claim.</p><p>you can certainly describe them numerically, statistically, by putting<br/>a machine up and measuring the frequency of the notes--without being<br/>able to reproduce them.  but you can&apos;t test my claim that this is a<br/>less significant criterion for measurement than a phonemic one, if you<br/>can&apos;t hear them as different phonemes.</p><p>much as, you couldn&apos;t talk adequately about the chinese tone system,<br/>and the way that different patterns of tone affect the language,<br/>unless you could to a certain extent distinguish them and/or reproduce<br/>them adequately.</p><p>that&apos;s why the more relevant part of my podcast wasn&apos;t the sequence of<br/>12 descending notes, but the 12 different maqam phrases.<br/>each one of those phrases contains 3 or 4 melodic phonemes--and i am<br/>using them to grasp the intonation of the single note in the middle.</p><p>much as, if i wanted to make a recording of 12 different o, u, and ou<br/>vowel sounds used in english, and compare them adjacently, i&apos;d<br/>probably have to say the 12 different words in which they are used<br/>(and maybe a few words for some of the vowels, to get the sounds &amp;<br/>differences more clearly in my ears).  i couldn&apos;t get the clarity of<br/>distinctions if i tried only saying the vowels without larger<br/>phonemees or words.</p><p>.... the short answer: you need melody not only to be able to<br/>reproduce these microtones, but also to be able to describe and<br/>explain them.  it should be obvious that if it is necessary for a<br/>human ear to use melody to produce (and distinguish them), then melody<br/>must also be a necessary element of any description or explanation of<br/>them.</p></div><h3>sami_shumays &#x3C;abushumays@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2007 10:51:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; it seems to me that music theory has<br/>&gt; &gt; stagnated philosophically--and in particular theoretical<br/>&gt; &gt; approaches to arabic music have not developed much at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is regrettably true.

But I would approach maqams from a relative pitch<br/>&gt; perspective, unless in fact they are never transposed (and<br/>&gt; you seemed to say, near the end of the podcast, that<br/>&gt; hijaz could be played on different tonics).</p><p>i didn&apos;t mean to give that impression.  the Es are not absolute, but<br/>relative pitches.  i had to align them in an absolute sense in order<br/>to compare them in the very artificial way I did (you&apos;ll notice i<br/>compared the third note of some maqamat with the second note of<br/>others, and the first note of yet another) for the sake of showing<br/>that there are many different inflections of microtones in a way<br/>literally undisputable--you can all hear the differences, since<br/>they&apos;re right next to each other.</p><p>however, all of the maqamat (and here we are really talking about<br/>ajnas--the units of four to five notes which define the basic elements<br/>(both tonally and melodically) of maqam) are transposable--all of the<br/>ajnas are transposable.  not to any key, of course; we don&apos;t<br/>traditionally use keyboard instruments--so the transpositions happen<br/>to a limited set of alternate keys.</p><p>whether there is an absolute pitch standard also depends on the<br/>country, time period, number of people in the ensemble, etc.  nowadays<br/>musicians all over the world are aware of the 440 standard, and so any<br/>musician will have to measure pitch by that standard--especially if<br/>they play with other musicians who may happen also to play in symphony<br/>orchestras or with keyboard instruments.</p><p>so they, in egypt and syria for example, have tunings 1/2 step flat or<br/>1 whole step flat (conceptual G happens at concert F# or F), in order<br/>to accomodate singers.  before the universal 440 standard, they tuned<br/>down or up anywhere, depending on the singer&apos;s voice.  yet in certain<br/>large ensembles, they are always tuned at A=440.</p><p>all of these microtones are relative piches, relative to a certain<br/>jins (a certain tetra- or penta-chord), relative, that is, to a<br/>certain tonic, and certain adjacent notes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; my point is, however, that each of these different E&apos;s is<br/>&gt; &gt; recognizable as a distinct KIND of note, even if the range<br/>&gt; &gt; of acceptable intonation for that note overlaps with others.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which is why, it seems to me, we&apos;re not talking about Es<br/>&gt; but about degrees of maqamat.</p><p>exactly.<br/>but more precisely, i&apos;m talking about the proto-typical melodic phrase<br/>units *surrounding* different degrees of different maqamat.</p></div><h3>sami_shumays &#x3C;abushumays@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2007 11:35:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you&apos;re insiste on an ET, 53 would be the safest bet because of the<br/>&gt; pure<br/>&gt; &gt; fourths and fifths, but if there are twelve notes between E-flat and<br/>&gt; &gt; E-natural, 53 won&apos;t cut it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you really need discrimination down to a cent, even 612 won&apos;t cut it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think I&apos;ll propose 2460 as the universal maqam tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (1) It is divisible by 12, with a 12-et semitone of 205 parts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2) It tempers out the Kernbergr atom, and supports atomic temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (3) It is a standout et up through the 27 limit, so it approximates<br/>&gt; rational intervals even more closely than you might think.<br/>&gt;</p><p>which would mean what?--that anyone wanting to tune a maqam precisely<br/>would have to get a machine that can measure down to 2460 equal<br/>divisions?

(But that still would be a good high-precision EDO measurement for<br/>any<br/>&gt; kind of music.)<br/>&gt;</p><p>What do you need that kind of high precision for? Maqam Music has never used<br/>any temperaments other than 24 and 53/106 equal so far, both of which are<br/>quite recent approaches having nothing to do with the meantone of Baroque<br/>styles. After all, this is not a genre requiring the harmony-oriented<br/>tunings like those of Western common-practice. At least this has been the<br/>case up to now.</p><p>&gt; But you do raise a point: there already is a measurement system expressing<br/>&gt; parts of a 53-TET comma, the T&iuml;&iquest;&half;rk cent. I like to measure things in<br/>&gt; fractions of a comma; I&apos;ve been using quarters of a comma to express<br/>&gt; 13-limit JI for a while now, and others have before me. You divide the<br/>comma<br/>&gt; into thirds.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Which yields enough resolution to express the myriad of pitch subleties<br/>common to Maqam Music. In fact, even this is too much, and 79/80 MOS out of<br/>it does quite nicely.</p><p>&gt; 212 (53 x 4), 217 and 224 are quarter-comma EDOs. 306 is sixth-comma and<br/>is<br/>&gt; the first ET to have better fifths than 53. 612, twice 306, divides the<br/>&gt; Pythagorean comma into twelve parts and 665 (with the extremely precise<br/>&gt; fifth) divides the syntonic comma into twelfths. And 12 is the least<br/>common<br/>&gt; multiple of 3 and 4. I guess you could also use 636 or 651 or something<br/>&gt; similar.<br/>&gt;</p><p>These are no doubt very precise, but I repeat, no instrument of Maqam Music<br/>can accurately represent a managable subset conforming to these systems.<br/>Let&apos;s stay with 159, and allow deviations by a few cents.

This is the kind of thing I (and<br/>&gt; others) have been trying to pry out of Ozan for some time now.</p><p>really, which keys are used has a lot to do with the tuning of<br/>stringed instruments.  in arabic music, the oud is tuned (from low to<br/>high):  C or D, F, A, D, G, C.  i tune my violin G-D-G-D, as do most<br/>arab violinists.<br/>the keys arabs used most frequently are C, G, D, F, e-half flat and b-<br/>half-flat (for the sekah modes)  Also A &amp; E for some of the modes.<br/>We hardly ever base any maqam on a # or flat key--although due to the<br/>de-tunings down a half-or-whole step, maqams are based on those keys<br/>relative to 440.</p><p>my understanding of turkish oud tuning is that it is roughly the same<br/>as arabic, but a step higher.  therefore there is much more use of<br/>the keys of B &amp; E &amp; F#  i have seen a few examples of this from<br/>turkish oud players i&apos;ve encountered.</p><p>the qanun, whether turkish or arabic, has 7 diatonic notes per octave<br/>(C-D-E-F-G-A-B), with a number of microtonal tuning levers, depending<br/>on the tradition.  some as few as 3 levers (for sharp, flat, and half-<br/>flat), going up to, in the older turkish tradition, as many as 12 or<br/>17 per note (once again giving the lie to the comma system which<br/>turkish musicians espouse much more than arabic).  But as a result of<br/>the diatonic basis, the choice of keys is limited, and when you<br/>combine that with the other instruments playing...</p><p>&gt; &gt; so they, in egypt and syria for example, have tunings 1/2 step<br/>&gt; &gt; flat or 1 whole step flat (conceptual G happens at concert F# or<br/>&gt; &gt; F), in order to accomodate singers.  before the universal 440<br/>&gt; &gt; standard, they tuned down or up anywhere, depending on the<br/>&gt; &gt; singer&apos;s voice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, so I think it&apos;s safe to say that the pitch standard is<br/>&gt; not an important part of maqam music.  Another fundamental<br/>&gt; thing to understand.</p><p>right.  not an important part of the theoretical component, although<br/>in current actual practice most musicians in at least egypt and syria<br/>tune to A=440 when performing publicly.  the other aspect to this, of<br/>course, is the tuning of the nay--the cane flute.  there is a certain<br/>degree of pitch flexibility to this instrument, but not much.  maybe<br/>a little less than a quarter-tone on either side of the pitch.  but<br/>since the instrument&apos;s tuning is the result of its manufacture, nays<br/>are generally made nowadays tuned (roughly) to A=440.  like other<br/>wind instruments, there are nays in each key--a D nay, a C nay, a G<br/>nay, an F nay, an A nay, an E nay.</p><p>&gt; This still doesn&apos;t mean that absolute pitch isn&apos;t important.<br/>&gt; That is something we&apos;ll have to continue to test as we go<br/>&gt; along.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s believed that the pitch standard is also relatively<br/>&gt; new in Western music.  Yet there&apos;s a bunch of stuff from<br/>&gt; the baroque era about the importance of key color.  And<br/>&gt; there&apos;s debate over whether this had to do with:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; . Difference in consonance between keys of the unequal<br/>&gt; keyboard temperaments in use at the time (I personally<br/>&gt; doubt this explanation, alas).</p><p>why do you doubt this explanation?  i had my piano tuned to one of<br/>the bach tunings (the non-equal tempered, but well-tempered ones used<br/>for the well-tempered klavier), and have been playing through some of<br/>the well-tempered klavier over the last few months.  to me, the<br/>quality of key differences is much more stark than on an equal-<br/>tempered piano, and the different kinds of modulations bach uses in<br/>different keys are more strikingly expressive in this tuning.</p><p>perhaps i&apos;m imagining things, but i think there is at least some<br/>substance to this idea.</p></div><h3>sami_shumays &#x3C;abushumays@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2007 7:53:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; all of these microtones are relative piches, relative to a certain<br/>&gt; jins (a certain tetra- or penta-chord), relative, that is, to a<br/>&gt; certain tonic, and certain adjacent notes.</p><p>Thanks!

I have no idea how to<br/>&gt; &gt; broadcast myself on youtube. At least not at this<br/>&gt; &gt; conjuncture.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A demonstration isn&apos;t necessary.
