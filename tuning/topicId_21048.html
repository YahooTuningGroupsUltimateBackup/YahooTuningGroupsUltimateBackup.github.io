That IS<br/>interesting.  If this is matched by, as Monz indicated, improvisation<br/>and use of microtones, we have further similarities.</p><p>Scatting and nomtom have seldom been compared, until now.

I think the so called errors in relation to 12-tET [and even<br/>standard or classical JI for that matter] are not errors at all but seem to obey<br/>the kind of referential JI described by Boomsliter and Creel. In this system all<br/>pitches are very accurately tuned by small number ratios to a chain of<br/>references [a sort of unsounded cantus firmus] that proceeds [in jazz at least]<br/>by an initial 5:4 and then by successive ranks of 3:2.</p><p>If an intonation tester were unaware of this practice they would also would say<br/>that the intonation of singers especially was neither in [classical] JI nor in<br/>12-tET but instead grossly inaccurate ! IMO this idea is erroneous. Melodic<br/>pitch descrimination may be as accurate as simaltaneous pitch perception !</p><p>I used to have a flat mate who was a jazz trained drummer and pianist and he<br/>unfortunately sung in exact 12-tET. It sounded awful! He was into all that<br/>robotic type jazz [Chick Corea, Dave Weckl] where deviations from 12tet are<br/>minimal.</p><p>Boomsliter and Creel did tests on blues and jazz and classical recordings and<br/>found that they corresponded exactly with their theory of melodic intonation.</p><p>Further their theory was not a hypothesis that they just went about proving.<br/>Their theory was developed from their initial research which involved getting<br/>musicians to select intonations for melodies from an a sort of lapsteel guitar<br/>whose results were later organised into a referential keyboard.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Where can<br/>&gt;&gt;we listen to scatting?  Any CDs?</p><p>&gt;Ella Fitzgerald!</p><p>I bet Ella Fitzgerald&apos;s intonation was also based on this scheme.</p><p>Justin White</p><p>DAVID JONES LIMITED      ACN 000 074 573</p></div>
