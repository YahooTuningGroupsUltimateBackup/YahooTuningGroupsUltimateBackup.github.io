It seems this guitar, which had bent frets very comparable to Jon<br/>Catler&apos;s guitar, was actually built by Panormo, but I never saw the real<br/>instrument or even a picture of it. The design appears in Harvey Turnbull:<br/>THE GUITAR FROM THE RENAISSANCE TO THE PRESENT DAY<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps it was Lindley&apos;s book, or it was in one by Martin Vogel<br/>&gt; (Die enhrmonische ... I forget the German for &quot;guitar&quot;).<br/>&quot;Die enharmonische Gitarre&quot;. Martin Vogel had three of these guitars built<br/>by Walter Vogt around 1985 (I was in the workshop when they were delivered).<br/>They had straight frets however. Professor Vogel explained me that they were<br/>placed in such a way that from now on any piece could be arranged for guitar<br/>trio in 5-limit JI. He was not at all interested in the moveable frets, for<br/>he wanted both Ab and G# next to each other...</p><p>(I posted the info on Thompson&apos;s alreday to Jon Catler)</p><p>--Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
