So I post<br/>immediately what is already written : the answer at the first question.</p><p>I will try to show why the D(X) function permits to find the degree of each<br/>interval in a scale. I neglected, in part I, to distinguish the D(X)<br/>function and the D(2;X) function using octave modularity.</p><p>In a future post then I will comment about general methods to obtain, in<br/>our diatonic example, the trivalent set. In dimension N, one of them uses a<br/>matrix which is a N + 1 root of the identity and the other uses what I name<br/>the matrix S which permits to specify the same trivalent set but also, in<br/>our diatonic example, a coherent quadrivalent set.</p><p>----------<br/>QUESTION 1</p><p>I recall our diatonic example in &lt;2,3,5&gt; with D(X) = 7x + 11y + 16z and the<br/>two statements : &quot;harmonic-3 corresponds to degree 4&quot; and &quot;harmonic-5<br/>corresponds to degree 2&quot; (in the octave). I give first some details about<br/>the &quot;how&quot;, after what I will comment about the &quot;why&quot;.</p><p>Let us calculate the value D(X) of the harmonic-3 image in all octaves :</p><p>   {... 3/8, 3/4, 3/2, 3/1, 6/1, ...} --&gt; {... -10, -3, 4, 11, 18, ...}</p><p>The first set corresponds to the harmonic-3 class in octave modularity and<br/>the second set to the class 4 in Z/7 modularity. We have to see why it is<br/>far from tricky to write</p><p>   D(X mod 2) = D(X) mod 7</p><p>   D(3 mod 2) = 11 mod 7 = 4<br/>   D(5 mod 2) = 16 mod 7 = 2</p><p>whose formalism has to be also explicitated.</p><p>---</p><p>Beyond the geometric interpretation, let us look at the properties of the<br/>D(X) function. We know abstractly (Cf. Hellegouarch) that</p><p>   G = &lt;2,3,5&gt; is an infinite abelian group</p><p>   R = &lt;81/80, 25/24&gt; = &lt;r,s&gt; is an infinite subgroup of G</p><p>   G/R is an infinite class group we name quotient-group.</p><p>Let us see gradually the properties implied.</p><p>a) The D(X) = 7x + 11y + 16z function applying G on Z specifies<br/>   the classes. Indeed, two intervals X and Y in G are in<br/>   the same class modulo R if D(X) = D(Y). The partition of G<br/>   simply follows from this relation of equivalence and the set<br/>   of its classes is designated by the notation G/R.</p><p>   e.g. The intervals 8/5 == (3,0,-1) and 5/3 == (0,-1,1) are in<br/>        the same class for D(3,0,-1) = D(0,-1,1) = 5.</p><p>b) The D(X) function permits to label each class. There is an<br/>   infinite number of classes, each one containing an infinite<br/>   number of intervals. There is a bijection G/R --&gt; Z between<br/>   the classes G/R and the numbers Z. For each number in Z,<br/>   e.g. 12723, we could specify generically the corresponding<br/>   intervals.</p><p>c) There is much more about D(X). A relation of equivalence is a<br/>   congruence if the algebraic structure is preserved. What<br/>   corresponds to the property (where * means coordinates adding<br/>   or interval multiplying)</p><p>      D(X * Y) = D(X) + D(Y)</p><p>   which indicates that the following diagram is commutative</p><p>      G x G -------&gt; Z x Z<br/>        |              |<br/>        | *          + |<br/>        |              |<br/>        G -----------&gt; Z<br/>               D</p><p>   or (D)(*) = (+)(D x D).</p><p>   Indeed, applying to (X,Y) successively we have</p><p>      (D)(*)(X,Y) = D(X * Y)</p><p>      (+)(D x D)(X,Y) = (+)(D(X),D(Y)) = D(X) + D(Y)</p><p>   We say then that D is an abelian group homomorphism G --&gt; Z.<br/>   The composition (table) of the numbers in Z, as images of the<br/>   intervals in G, is superposable on the composition (table) of<br/>   the intervals in G.</p><p>   As illustration, the degrees of 5/32 and 12/5 are respectively<br/>   -19 and 9, and the degree of 3/8 is -10. Since 3/8 = (5/32)*(12/5)<br/>   the composition of the intervals is reflected in the composition<br/>   of the corresponding degrees : -10 = -19 + 9.</p><p>d) We name isomorphism an homomorphic bijection and epimorphism an<br/>   homomorphic surjection. Thus the surjection D is defined as an<br/>   epimorphism G --&gt; Z which is composed</p><p>                          G ------&gt; G/R ------&gt; Z<br/>                              D&apos;          D&quot;</p><p>   of the canonical epimorphism D&apos; of intervals on classes and the<br/>   isomorphism D&quot; of classes on numbers. We note (D&quot;)(D&apos;) the<br/>   composition of the applications meaning</p><p>      (D&quot;)(D&apos;)(X) = D&quot;(D&apos;(X)) = D(X)</p><p>---</p><p>Now let us see how the equivalence modulo &lt;2&gt; or &lt;3&gt; or &lt;5&gt; may be<br/>manipulated.</p><p>e) In our notation, &lt;p&gt; is the group of all intervals of the form<br/>   p^k where k is in Z. The quotient-group G/&lt;2&gt; or G/&lt;3&gt; or G/&lt;5&gt;<br/>   of the group G by the subgroup &lt;2&gt; or &lt;3&gt; or &lt;5&gt; is the group<br/>   of intervals modulo &lt;2&gt; or &lt;3&gt; or &lt;5&gt;.</p><p>   We have to distinguish here the class group which contains an<br/>   infinite number of intervals in each class and a representing<br/>   system of these classes which corresponds to the choice of one<br/>   and only one interval for each class in such manner that this<br/>   chosen set be a group (with a modular operation) isomorph to<br/>   the class group.</p><p>   The group &lt;3,5&gt; is a good system representing G/&lt;2&gt;. And so the<br/>   group &lt;2,5&gt; may represent adequately G/&lt;3&gt; like the group &lt;2,3&gt;<br/>   may be used to represent G/&lt;5&gt;.</p><p>   However, we use generally the intersection of G with the first<br/>   octave [1,2[ as system representing G/&lt;2&gt; since it contains only<br/>   one interval in each class of G/&lt;2&gt; and it constitutes (with the<br/>   composition law modified for modular reentrance) a group isomorph<br/>   to G/&lt;2&gt;.</p><p>   Naturally we could apply similar comments to G/&lt;3&gt; and G/&lt;5&gt;.</p><p>f) To keep clarity, we have to restrict the distinctions. So I note<br/>   simply</p><p>      G/2   : G/&lt;2&gt; = &lt;2,3,5&gt;/&lt;2&gt;<br/>              or its representing groups (in octave or &lt;3,5&gt;)</p><p>      G/2R  : (G/2)/R = (G/R)/2 = G/&lt;2,r,s&gt;<br/>              or its representing groups</p><p>      Z/n   : Z/[n] = Z/nZ  (further explanations below)</p><p>   We could distinguish the class group and its representing group<br/>   in the first octave in adding the homomorphism G/&lt;2&gt; --&gt; G/2.</p><p>   With this simplification we obtain this commutative diagram of<br/>   all retained homomorphism permitting to manipulate as easily<br/>   as rigourously the formalism :</p><p>            G x G ---------&gt; G/R x G/R ---------&gt; Z x Z<br/>              |\                 |\                 |\<br/>              | \                | \                | \<br/>              |  \               |  \               |  \<br/>              |   \              |   \              |   \<br/>              |    \             |    \             |    \<br/>              | G/2 x G/2 ------&gt; G/2R x G/2R ------&gt; Z/7 x Z/7<br/>              |     |            |     |            |     |<br/>              |     |            |     |            |     |<br/>              G ----|---------&gt; G/R ---|----------&gt; Z     |<br/>               \    |             \    |             \    |<br/>                \   |              \   |              \   |<br/>                 \  !               \  |               \  |<br/>                  \ |                \ |                \ |<br/>                   \|                 \|                 \|<br/>                   G/2 -------------&gt; G/2R ------------&gt; Z/7</p><p>g) To complete the formalism we have to define some &quot;modulo<br/>   equivalence&quot; begining with the multiplicative and additive ones.</p><p>      &quot;x = y mod &lt;n&gt;&quot; = &quot;there exist k in Z such that x = y * n^k&quot;</p><p>      &quot;x = y mod [n]&quot; = &quot;there exist k in Z such that x = y + n*k&quot;</p><p>   The notation [n] indicate here the ideal nZ which is a subgroup<br/>   of Z. When the context permits to distinguish them I use only<br/>   the form &quot;x = y mod n&quot;.</p><p>   e.g. (5/3 = 20/3 = 5/48) mod 2   (meaning mod &lt;2&gt;)</p><p>        (18 = -10 = 4 = 11) mod 7   (meaning mod [7])</p><p>   A such formalism may be used with all form of equivalence or<br/>   congruence relation. With X and Y in the group G and the<br/>   subgroup R = &lt;r,s&gt;, the symbol R indicate also a congruence :</p><p>      &quot;X = Y mod R&quot; = &quot;there exist K in R such that X = Y * K&quot;</p><p>   e.g. Using our diatonic example, with X and Y in G = &lt;2,3,5&gt;,<br/>        R = &lt;r,s&gt; = &lt;81/80, 25/24&gt;, and 2R = &lt;2,r,s&gt; we may write</p><p>           (9/8 = 16/15 = 256/243) mod &lt;r,s&gt;   (or mod R)</p><p>           (9/64 = 1/30 = 8/243) mod &lt;2,r,s&gt;   (or mod 2R)</p><p>           (4,-1,-1) = (8,-5,0) mod R</p><p>   By anticipation, I note also that I will use the content of a<br/>   matrix, which I call the S matrix, whose elements correspond to<br/>   a centered convex body in G to define the following congruence</p><p>      &quot;X = Y mod S&quot; = &quot;there exist K in S such that X = Y * K&quot;</p><p>h) Now we can define uniformly the canonical epimorphism (mod m)<br/>   applying a group G on the classes modulo m noted G/m. For the<br/>   sake of clarity I may use the same symbol, like &quot;mod 2&quot;, with<br/>   different definition domains when the effect is similar.</p><p>      mod 2   :   G --&gt; G/2   :  X :--&gt; X mod 2</p><p>      mod 2   : G/R --&gt; G/2R  :  X :--&gt; X mod 2</p><p>      mod R   :   G --&gt; G/R   :  X :--&gt; X mod R</p><p>      mod 2R  :   G --&gt; G/2R  :  X :--&gt; X mod 2R</p><p>      mod 7   :   Z --&gt; Z/7   :  x :--&gt; x mod 7</p><p>   So we see that mod R correspond to D&apos; in the decomposition of<br/>   D = (D&quot;)(D&apos;) = (D&quot;)(mod R).</p><p>---</p><p>i) Finally we can simply say that the following relation</p><p>      D(X mod 2) = D(X) mod 7</p><p>   corresponds to the fact that (D), (mod 2) and (mod 7) are<br/>   homomorphisms, and then the following diagram is commutative</p><p>                                   D<br/>                             G ---------&gt; Z<br/>                             |            |<br/>                       mod 2 |            | mod 7<br/>                             |            |<br/>                            G/2 -------&gt; Z/7<br/>                                   D</p><p>                        (mod 7)(D) = (D)(mod 2)</p><p>   For applying successively to X we have</p><p>      (mod 7)(D)(X) = (mod 7)(D(X)) = D(X) mod 7</p><p>      (D)(mod 2)(X) = D(X mod 2)</p><p>   Thus it is why we can use so simply</p><p>      D(X mod 2) = D(X) mod 7</p><p>j) Ultimately let us define the D(X) function applied to three<br/>   modularities, leaving only the formalism to talk.</p><p>      D(2;X) : G --&gt; G/2R --&gt; Z/7<br/>      D(3;X) : G --&gt; G/3R --&gt; Z/11<br/>      D(5;X) : G --&gt; G/5R --&gt; Z/16</p><p>      D(2;X) = D(X mod 2) = D(X) mod 7<br/>      D(3;X) = D(X mod 3) = D(X) mod 11<br/>      D(5;X) = D(X mod 5) = D(X) mod 16</p><p>      D(2;X) = (7x + 11y + 16z) mod 7  = (4y +  2z) mod 7<br/>      D(3;X) = (7x + 11y + 16z) mod 11 = (7x +  5z) mod 11<br/>      D(5;X) = (7x + 11y + 16z) mod 16 = (7x + 11y) mod 16</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Pierre Lamothe</p></div><h3>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/9/2001 7:48:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello everyone, I have two queries:</p><p>[1]  Do we know whether Bach, Mozart, or Beethoven ... any composer<br/>     did improvisation?</p><p>[2]  Can we not call written scores in Western music, &quot;frozen&quot;<br/>     improvisation?<br/>     Thanks,<br/>     Haresh.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>10/10/2001 12:39:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello everyone, I have two queries:</p><p>&gt; [1]  Do we know whether Bach, Mozart, or Beethoven ... any composer<br/>&gt;      did improvisation?</p><p>Yes we do.</p><p>&gt; [2]  Can we not call written scores in Western music, &quot;frozen&quot;<br/>&gt;      improvisation?</p><p>Not really, but a cadenza written out might qualify, for instance.</p></div><h3>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>10/10/2001 9:10:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>They were all formidable improvisers.

These answers may vary depending on the historical period,<br/>and also the style of music and the place.</p><p>First of all, it is easy to reply that a musician such as Bach was<br/>indeed famed for his keyboard improvisations as well as his<br/>compositions, and excelled at this form of performance.</p><p>Your second question raises two important issues: to what extent might<br/>a composition be described as an &quot;improvisation,&quot; and to what extent<br/>might it be described as &quot;frozen.&quot; These answers can vary depending on<br/>style and period.</p><p>Certain compositions for solo instruments in the 16th century such as<br/>lute or keyboard, for example, do have the quality of &quot;frozen<br/>improvisations,&quot; sometimes suggesting how a player may have<br/>interpreted a known vocal composition for four voices, say, on which<br/>the piece is based.</p><p>These keyboard pieces seem to me very much to fit your idea of &quot;frozen<br/>improvisations.&quot; They record, in a way like a CD or tape recorder, how<br/>one musician may have played a given piece originally written for<br/>voices, including things such as the choices of ornaments and the<br/>accidental inflections raising or lowering certain notes by a<br/>semitone.</p><p>This last point is very important. In much medieval and Renaissance<br/>European music through the 16th century, many choices about<br/>accidentals (sharps or flats) were left to the performers. Thus one<br/>instrumental version of a given vocal piece might in a certain place<br/>favor E and C; another Eb and C; and a third E and C#.</p><p>The same instrumental version might make different choices of<br/>accidentals when a passage is repeated, showing how instrumentalists<br/>and singers might have done this in unrecorded performances of the<br/>period.</p><p>Thus a given piece of this kind is simply a &quot;frozen&quot; version or<br/>recording of one interpretation; a different musician, or the same<br/>musician performing the same kind of interpretation again, might make<br/>different choices.</p><p>Some other kinds of keyboard pieces also suggest an improvisatory<br/>approach: the 16th-century _toccata_, or &quot;touch piece,&quot; might suggest<br/>this style.</p><p>Also, there is not necessarily a sharp distinction in medieval and<br/>Renaissance theory between &quot;improvising&quot; and &quot;composing.&quot; The art of<br/>_discant_, for example, might consist either in singing an improvised<br/>melody against another given melody, or in composing in this manner.</p><p>Likewise, the art of _fantasia_ discussed by Tomas de Santa Maria in<br/>his treatise of 1565 can mean either improvisation of composition of<br/>music on a keyboard or other instrument such as a lute or harp capable<br/>of playing several voices at once. Many of the observations in this<br/>book about four-voice writing, for example, could apply to either kind<br/>of music.</p><p>Here we run into other complication: a composer may be influenced by<br/>the improvisations of other people, sometimes in ways of which we<br/>cannot be sure.</p><p>For example, the scholar Claude Palisca has suggested that the<br/>composer Claudio Monteverdi, sometime a bit before 1600, may have<br/>heard singers perform a style of improvised counterpoint where<br/>dissonances of a kind not used in conventional written compositions<br/>would occur. Palisca suggests that Monteverdi could have heard this,<br/>liked the effect, and made it a part of his new style of composed<br/>vocal music.</p><p>Also, a composer may &quot;find&quot; some new or pleasing progression on a<br/>keyboard, but then make this progression part of a style for<br/>compositions written without any further reference to a keyboard<br/>instrument.</p><p>Sometimes to the degree to which a given musician or community of<br/>musicians can &quot;internalize&quot; a given style or tuning system is an open<br/>question. For example, among the circle of musicians following the<br/>&quot;enharmonic&quot; style of Nicola Vicentino with its division of the octave<br/>into 31 equal or near-equal parts, could some of them compose in this<br/>style without reference to a keyboard like Vicentino&apos;s? We are told<br/>that singers tended to depend on such a keyboard to find the new types<br/>of intervals; could some composers write enharmonic music confidently<br/>without such an instrument, as they might write conventional<br/>counterpoint?</p><p>Interestingly, the first recorded European &quot;compositions&quot; for more<br/>than one voice, around the late 9th century, could be described as<br/>examples to guide people improvising this kind of music. They may also<br/>record how improvisers did things like starting at a unison, moving to<br/>a 4:3, singing in 4:3 concords, and then returning to a unison.</p><p>By around the year 1000, it seems that the idea of composition, of<br/>writing down a specific two-voice piece, was taking shape. By the 13th<br/>century, at least, we find treatises with specific advice on how to<br/>compose in various forms.</p><p>What I would want to emphasize is that in medieval and Renaissance<br/>times, much in a composition is left to the performers, or at least<br/>not specified on paper: many of the likely accidentals, ornaments of<br/>various kinds, and the choice of voices or instruments for many<br/>ensemble pieces.</p><p>Sometimes composers have sought to exert some guidance on this<br/>process. In the 14th century, Guillaume de Machaut urged that one of<br/>his part-songs be performed &quot;neither adding nor taking anything away&quot;;<br/>around 1500, Josquin des Prez is reported to have protested when a<br/>singer ornamented one of his pieces in a manner he found untasteful,<br/>suggesting that the singer should write compositions of his own if he<br/>wanted an effect of this kind.</p><p>This is only one possible answer to some parts of your question, but I<br/>hope it may give some background and invite further discussion.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>10/10/2001 3:22:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:</p><p>&gt; They were all formidable improvisers. In the baroque era,<br/>&gt; improvisation was the name of the game. Bach could improvise fugues<br/>&gt; on the spot. He was challenged by Fredreci the Great, a Polish king<br/>&gt; and patron of the arts and a musician himself, to take a theme he<br/>&gt; played for Bach on the flute and improvise a 6-voice fugue. Bach<br/>&gt; listened, asked permission to change one note, then proceeded to<br/>&gt; improvise the fugue.</p><p>I&apos;ll bet Frederick would be surprised to hear he is a Pole--it&apos;s<br/>Poland now, thanks to Stalin, but then it was Prussia. I understand<br/>he was quite excited when he heard &quot;Old Bach&quot; had come, because of<br/>his reputation as a &quot;learned&quot; composer, performer and improvisor. Of<br/>course afterwards it was back to a steady diet of Quantz, I suppose.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>10/10/2001 3:27:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; I attended a recital by a pianist (don&apos;t remember his name) at<br/>&gt; The Curtis Institute of Music (in Philadelphia) a couple of years<br/>&gt; ago, which featured a performance of Beethoven&apos;s 4th Piano Concerto,<br/>&gt; with the recitalist on the solo part and a faculty member or grad<br/>&gt; student playing the orchestral part on another piano.

The famous 10th century organist,<br/>Marcel Dupre (1886o-1971) was a stormer of an improviser and manhy of his<br/>compositions such as the &quot;Stations of the Cross&quot; are recreations from<br/>memory of his improvisations. In the worl,d of organists the art of<br/>improvisation is very much alive and well. Got to<br/><a href="http://www.pipedreams.org">http://www.pipedreams.org</a> and follow links to find cd&apos;s of such as Naji<br/>Hakkim. This is as ear-stretching music as a pipe organ will allow.<br/>And, if you&apos;re ever touristing in Salt Lake City, stop by the Tabernacle at<br/>noon on any weekday. The organist must include as part of the recital, an<br/>improv combining &quot;Come, Come ye Saints&quot; with any other tune (secular or<br/>sacred) of his/her choice.
