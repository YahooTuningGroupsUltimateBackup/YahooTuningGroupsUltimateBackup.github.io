Where one just plays what feels/sounds right, which more<br/>often than not, isn&apos;t in strict 12 tET, but kind of hovers around it.<br/>It&apos;s a personal goal to someday afford microtonal guitar gear, so<br/>that it can be in a tuning that I prefer. The reason that I don&apos;t<br/>have guitar in more compositions is due to this reality.</p><p>Sometimes it&apos;s unfortunate how the mp3 encoding process will subtlety<br/>degrade the quality of CD audio, but I think the fidelity will be<br/>acceptable. Some of the parts where I over-dub the guitars up to 8<br/>times, do not have the definition that I hear with the CD audio.</p><p>Let me know what you think - even if you hate it. Would be<br/>particularly interested in your opinion Dan, as I must bow deeply to<br/>your guitar prowess (which I&apos;ve been hip to since the mid 90s).</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=15826 href="#15826">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2000 11:19:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I have uploaded one of my guitar pieces to:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jacky_ekstasis/MP3/">http://www.geocities.com/jacky_ekstasis/MP3/</a></p><p>Hi Jacky,</p><p>I&apos;d love to check it out, but I tried twice and both times, after<br/>about twenty minutes of downloading, I got a &apos;this page cannot be<br/>displayed&apos; type message...</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=15829 href="#15829">ðŸ”—</a>Prent Rodgers &#x3C;prodgers@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2000 10:14:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Me too.

So much for spontaneity!</p><p>Prent, I have taken your suggestion, and have set up a page on<br/><a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a> for sharing tunes. I think they will have a superior server<br/>for our purposes. It has taken a full four days for my piece to be<br/>approved. I&apos;m very happy to hear about the financial success on<br/><a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> : ) !  Surely, I have helped contribute to this, as I have<br/>frequented your page on numerous occasions. And here I must use<br/>the &quot;word&quot; (avoided by many), to describe my listening experience<br/>there: &quot;beautiful&quot; (Jung would&apos;ve probably called it an &quot;emotionally<br/>toned&quot; experience). Need I say more?</p><p>For those who might care to listen to a microtonally deprived<br/>(depraved?) guitarist, attempt to get some microtones out of twelve<br/>tone guitars, go here:</p><p><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/185/jacky_ligon.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/185/jacky_ligon.html</a></p><p>Comments, clich&eacute;s and criticism welcome.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>P.S. It seems kind of ironic somehow to put forth 12 tET music in a<br/>forum such as the Tuning List (especially since I&apos;ve not been<br/>actively working in &quot;12&quot; for a long time), but I think you&apos;ll agree<br/>that the approach does fit the criteria - and really it&apos;s just a demo<br/>piece anyway. It could serve as a kind of &quot;before and after&quot;<br/>snapshot - when I can lay my hands on a fretless! My fantasy fretless<br/>would have both humbucking and single-coil pickups, as I love to<br/>blend these two kinds of pick-up sounds (as this piece demonstrates).</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Prent Rodgers&quot; &lt;prodgers@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Me too.
