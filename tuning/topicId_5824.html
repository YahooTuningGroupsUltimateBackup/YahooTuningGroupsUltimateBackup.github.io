In such an approach, for example, all<br/>ratios involving odd integers greater than 3 define &quot;dissonances&quot; in a<br/>3-limit (Pythagorean) JI system, e.g. the major third at 81:64; and<br/>likewise all ratios involving odd integers greater than 5 in a 5-limit<br/>system, e.g. the &quot;proximate minor third&quot; or &quot;neutral third&quot; at 11:9.</p><p>While this approach may indeed fit the practice and theory of some<br/>musics, I would like to argue here that at least two historical<br/>systems may invite another approach: the Pythagorean JI of the 13th<br/>and 14th centuries in Continental Western Europe; and Nicola<br/>Vicentino&apos;s music in the mid-16th century based on a division of the<br/>octave into 31 equal or nearly equal intervals of about 1/5-tone.</p><p>If we realize Vicentino&apos;s system as 1/4-comma meantone with pure major<br/>thirds, as his own remark that his archicembalo (&quot;superharpsichord&quot;)<br/>has a tuning based on that of ordinary keyboard instruments may<br/>suggest, then our two tuning systems here in question are both &quot;linear<br/>tunings.&quot; That is, each derives its scheme from the just tuning of the<br/>most choice concord: the Gothic fifth at 3:2, or the Renaissance major<br/>third at 5:4.</p><p>Sometimes such tunings have been called &quot;one-dimensional&quot; or &quot;1-D&quot;<br/>tunings, a term which may be from one perspective descriptive (the<br/>tuning can be mapped as a series of intervals along a single line) and<br/>from another possibly unfortunate, since Pythagorean and 31-note<br/>meantone tunings offer many &quot;dimensions&quot; of complexity and subtlety.</p><p>Here I would like to argue that much of this complexity and subtlety<br/>may be found not only in the &quot;hardware,&quot; the notes of the tuning<br/>themselves, but in the &quot;software,&quot; the musical styles to which the<br/>tuning is applied.</p><p>Specifically, I will suggest that a two-fold distinction between<br/>&quot;consonance&quot; and &quot;dissonance&quot; may be insufficient to express some of<br/>the fine distinctions in Gothic &quot;3-limit&quot; polyphony and in Vicentino&apos;s<br/>modified &quot;5-limit&quot; polyphony. Interestingly, Western European<br/>theorists of the 13th century often recognize five or more gradations<br/>of vertical tension, and Vicentino also notes distinctions between<br/>intervals of his tuning system falling outside the usual &quot;5-odd-limit&quot;<br/>of stability.</p><p>In such musics and theories, it is quite possible for an interval to<br/>be &quot;unstable but relatively concordant,&quot; or for a relatively<br/>&quot;discordant&quot; interval to be part of a relatively concordant sonority.<br/>If we carry such an approach yet further, it may be possible to make<br/>distinctions even between unequivocally strong discords, and to ask<br/>how well an alternate tuning system fits such written and unwritten<br/>categories of style and theory.</p><p>---------------------------------------------<br/>1. Ludmila Ulehla&apos;s &quot;dual-purpose&quot; sonorities<br/>---------------------------------------------</p><p>In her textbook on _Contemporary Harmony_, the modern composer and<br/>theorist Ludmila Ulehla proposes a threefold scheme for analyzing<br/>intervals and sonorities: concord/dual-purpose/discord. While concords<br/>serve as points of repose, and discords seek resolution to concords,<br/>dual-purpose sonorities may be at once active and independently<br/>euphonious.</p><p>To refine this approach further, Ulehla proposes to use the lines and<br/>spaces of a musical staff for a visual graph showing the fluctuating<br/>levels of tension represented by the significant vertical sonorities<br/>in a given composition as judged in its own stylistic context. If we<br/>place a complete stable sonority on the lowest line of the staff, and<br/>what we regard as the most acute discords on the highest line, this<br/>graphing technique permits nine grades of tension.</p><p>While she applies these concepts to European and related compositions<br/>from the Classic era (c. 1750-1800) to contemporary practice, the same<br/>concepts might equally apply to medieval and Renaissance music, and<br/>have a special kinship to the subtle and sophisticated scales of<br/>&quot;concord/discord&quot; presented by theorists of the 13th-century tradition<br/>from Johannes de Garlandia to Jacobus of Liege.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Odd-limits as stability limits: the dual-purpose complication<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>As interesting as Ulehla&apos;s concepts and their historical antecedents<br/>might be from the viewpoint of musical composition and performance,<br/>they are equally significant in shaping our concepts of tuning<br/>systems. Specifically, the concept of a &quot;dual-purpose&quot; sonority raises<br/>the possibility that some intervals in a given system may be<br/>relatively concordant but unstable: the medieval 81:64 and 32:27, for<br/>example, or Vicentino&apos;s ~11:9 and ~18:11.</p><p>Such intervals have ratios beyond the &quot;odd-limit&quot; of a 3-limit or<br/>5-limit system, but nevertheless are treated as relatively concordant<br/>in practice and theory. This suggests that the odd-limit might best be<br/>defined as the _stability limit_ of a system, not necessarily the<br/>&quot;consonance limit,&quot; if one joins medieval and Renaissance theorists in<br/>recognizing degrees of consonance or concord which may apply to<br/>unstable as well as stable intervals.</p><p>An implication is that the tuning of &quot;dual-purpose&quot; intervals, as well<br/>as that of stable concords, may be quite significant in evaluating an<br/>alternative tuning system for music of a given period or style. If we<br/>were to perform medieval polyphony in 17-tone equal temperament<br/>(17-tet), or Vicentino&apos;s fifthtone compositions in 53-tet, we might<br/>thus wish to evaluate the tuning not only of stable 3-odd-limit or<br/>5-odd-limit intervals, but of &quot;dual-purpose&quot; intervals which may add<br/>both euphonious vertical color and subtly gradated vertical tension to<br/>the music.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------<br/>3. Pythagorean dual-purpose sonorities (1200-1420)<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>Although classical Pythagorean theory, as codified by Boethius<br/>(c. 480-524), draws what appears to be a simple &quot;3-odd-limit&quot;<br/>distinction between consonance and dissonance, medieval theorists<br/>recognize various sonorities beyond this limit to be &quot;imperfect<br/>concords&quot; or to &quot;concord well,&quot; although they are treated as<br/>unstable.</p><p>As early as around 1030, Guido d&apos;Arezzo lists acceptable intervals in<br/>polyphony as including not only stable unisons and fourths, but also<br/>the whole-tone (9:8), semiditone or minor third (32:27), and ditone or<br/>major third (81:64). In contrast, he excludes the minor second<br/>(256:243) and tritone (729:512).</p><p>Theorists of the 13th-century tradition beginning with Johannes de<br/>Garlandia (c. 1240?) recognize major and minor thirds as &quot;imperfect<br/>concords&quot; -- or, in the case of Jacobus of Liege (c. 1325), as &quot;medial<br/>concords.&quot; These intervals may be used, for example, to open pieces.<br/>Jacobus additionally describes the _quinta fissa_ or &quot;split fifth,&quot; a<br/>three-voice sonority &quot;splitting&quot; an outer fifth into two thirds,<br/>either with the major third above and the minor third below (string-<br/>ratio 81:64:54), or the converse arrangement (string-ratio 96:81:64).<br/>While he prefers the first arrangement, Jacobus recognizes that the<br/>second is also permissible, citing the opening sonority of a motet<br/>found in the Bamberg and Montpellier Codices (A3-C4-E4, with C4 as<br/>middle C, and higher numbers showing higher octaves).</p><p>Also, both Jacobus and Coussemaker&apos;s Anonymous I (c. 1300, possibly<br/>Jacobus at a younger age?) recommend the three-voice combination of a<br/>major ninth &quot;split&quot; by the third voice into two fifths (e.g. G3-D4-A4)<br/>as &quot;concording well,&quot; and this fits the style of certain 13th-century<br/>and 14th-century dialects of polyphony. This sonority, with its ratio<br/>of 9:6:4, represents another sonority beyond the 3-odd-limit deemed<br/>_relatively_ concordant. A similar status may apply to the minor<br/>seventh &quot;split&quot; into two fourths, e.g. G3-C4-F4 (16:12:9), and to a<br/>fifth &quot;split&quot; into fourth and major second, e.g. G3-C4-D4 (string-<br/>ratio 12:9:8) or G3-A3-D4 (string-ratio 9:8:6).</p><p>Thus it follows that while the relatively concordant major and minor<br/>thirds of the Gothic era at 81:64 and 32:27 are outside a 3-odd-limit<br/>of stability, their tuning is not a matter of indifference. An<br/>alternate system realizing them as 5:4 and 6:5, or as 9:7 and 7:6,<br/>would be changing the vertical color and tension of the music in a<br/>very significant way.</p><p>Similarly, although the major ninth (9:4), minor seventh (16:9), and<br/>major second (9:8) are outside the 3-odd-limit, their participation in<br/>relatively concordant sonorities with a majority of fifths and/or<br/>fourths makes them of considerable interest in evaluating any<br/>alternate tuning for the Gothic music of Continental Western Europe.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------<br/>4. Vicentino&apos;s fifthtone music: beyond the 5-odd-limit<br/>------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The practice and theory of the Renaissance, more than that of the<br/>Gothic, might appear to fit a dichotomous view of &quot;consonance and<br/>dissonance.&quot; Generally speaking, intervals within the 5-odd-limit<br/>(unisons, octaves, fifths, thirds, and sixths) are &quot;concordant,&quot; while<br/>seconds, sevenths, and augmented or diminished intervals are<br/>&quot;discordant.&quot; The fourth (4:3), treated as a concord between upper<br/>voices but as at least a quasi-discord in relation to the lowest<br/>voice, somewhat complicates this otherwise fairly consistent scheme.</p><p>However, in his treatise of 1555, Nicola Vicentino (1511-1576) takes<br/>us into an alternative universe of Renaissance music based largely on<br/>the common practice of the period, and yet radically altered by the<br/>introduction of new melodic and vertical intervals resulting from a<br/>division of the tone into five equal or nearly-equal parts..</p><p>For the most part, Vicentino&apos;s vertical sonorities in practice feature<br/>the usual 5-odd-limit concords and conventional discords of the epoch:<br/>the radically new quality of the music results from the melodic use of<br/>such intervals as the chromatic semitone and the enharmonic diesis or<br/>fifthtone.</p><p>However, he also recognizes vertical intervals beyond the 5-odd-limit<br/>either new to his tuning, or already found in a conventional 12-note<br/>meantone tuning but now occurring at more locations in the gamut.</p><p>Of special interest is the &quot;proximate minor third&quot; of &quot;nine minor<br/>dieses,&quot; i.e. ~9/5-tone. Vicentino gives its &quot;irrational ratio&quot; as<br/>being approximately 5-1/2:4-1/2, i.e. 11:9. He finds it a good<br/>concord, being located between the minor and major third, and somewhat<br/>leaning toward the ideal concord of the latter interval.</p><p>Likewise he finds the &quot;proximate minor sixth&quot; -- which would have an<br/>approximate ratio of ~18:11 as the octave complement of the proximate<br/>minor third -- acceptably concordant..</p><p>At least if we may judge from Vicentino&apos;s rather small sample of<br/>fifthtone compositions and examples, however, &quot;consonant&quot; in this<br/>sense does not necessarily imply &quot;stable.&quot; The proximate minor third,<br/>for example, occurs as a cadential interval when a voice progresses by<br/>fifthtone steps from a minor to a closing major third, the raising of<br/>a note by a diesis or fifthtone here being shown by an asterisk (*):</p><p>C4<br/>Ab3  Ab*3  A3<br/>F3</p><p>However, it does not to the best of my knowledge occur as a closing<br/>interval, or even as the point of repose for an internal cadence. Thus<br/>Ulehla&apos;s category of a &quot;dual-purpose&quot; sonority might best fit<br/>Vicentino&apos;s theory and practice.</p><p>In contrast, Vicentino finds the &quot;proximate major third&quot; a diesis<br/>larger than the usual concord, for which he gives the approximate<br/>ratio of 4-1/2:3-1/2, i.e. 9:7, as &quot;not so good,&quot; although tolerable<br/>in running passages. He explains that this interval is between the<br/>major third and the fourth, leaning toward the latter interval with<br/>its equivocal status, and thus tending somewhat toward discord.</p><p>He also finds the &quot;proximate major sixth&quot; a diesis wider than the<br/>usual major sixth (also known as a diminished seventh in 12-note<br/>meantone tunings) to tend toward a &quot;seventh,&quot; and thus to lean toward<br/>discord.</p><p>Interestingly, he suggests a similarity between this last interval and<br/>the &quot;minimal third&quot; a diesis less than minor (also known as an<br/>augmented second in 12-tone meantone tunings). For Vicentino, the<br/>normal minor third is already narrow enough that any further narrowing<br/>will make it &quot;resemble a second,&quot; and therefore lean toward<br/>dissonance. He advises that at least from a usual viewpoint of<br/>vertical euphony, this interval like the proximate major sixth might<br/>best be &quot;set aside.&quot;</p><p>Such judgments are indeed general guidelines, not categorical rules,<br/>since Vicentino himself uses a sonority including both a proximate<br/>major third (or tenth) above the bass and a proximate major sixth:<br/>B2-F#2-B3-Eb4. He asserts that intervals and progressions not so<br/>pleasing in themselves may be used where the sense of a text requires,<br/>an axiom also invoked about 50 years later to justify the bold<br/>dissonances of a Monteverdi or Gesualdo.</p><p>From a viewpoint of tuning theory and practice, it is interesting that<br/>Vicentino seems to follow the 5-odd-limit of stability usual for<br/>Renaissance music, but recognizes the proximate minor third of ~11:9<br/>and proximate minor sixth of ~18:11 as relatively concordant, finding<br/>the proximate major third (~9:7), and the proximate major sixth or<br/>minimal third (with ratios of ~12:7 and ~7:6) to tend more toward<br/>&quot;dissonance.&quot;</p><p>-----------------------------<br/>5. Some tentative conclusions<br/>-----------------------------</p><p>Since linear tunings, specifically Pythagorean or 3-limit JI and<br/>meantone, are so important in medieval and Renaissance music, the use<br/>in this music of &quot;unstable but relatively concordant&quot; intervals beyond<br/>the applicable &quot;odd-limit&quot; would seem a significant feature to be<br/>noted in designing or evaluating tuning systems for such musical<br/>styles.</p><p>This means that measures of &quot;fit&quot; should consider not only stable<br/>concords within a given odd-limit, but &quot;dual-purpose&quot; sonorities<br/>beyond it: for example 81:64 and 32:27 thirds and 9:6:4 sonorities in<br/>a Gothic setting, or ~11:9 proximate minor thirds in Vicentino.</p><p>Of course, optimizing stable concords is a first priority; but<br/>relative concords may also play a vital role in defining the color and<br/>directed motion of a vertical style.</p><p>Carrying such distinctions a step further, we might argue that even<br/>shades of difference in tension between unequivocal discords in a<br/>given style might be significant. One example suggested by Easley<br/>Blackwood is the comparatively &quot;milder&quot; quality of the regular<br/>meantone minor second (~117.11 cents) as a vertical dissonance<br/>vis-a-vis the chromatic semitone (~76.05 cents).</p><p>While this distinction might hardly seem one of first priority for<br/>Renaissance music, it may yet be a significant nuance of the style. At<br/>least one theorist suggests that augmented or diminished octaves were<br/>regarded as especially strong discords, although this did not prevent<br/>their use as vertical intervals in practice.</p><p>To conclude, at least in a stylistic and theoretical setting such as<br/>Gothic music or Vicentino&apos;s music, our approach to tunings might take<br/>into account not only stable concords within a given odd-limit, but<br/>also relative concords or &quot;dual-purpose&quot; sonorities beyond this limit,<br/>and even distinctions between grades of clear discord.</p><p>How one might weigh such many-sided aspects of a tuning system,<br/>quantitatively or otherwise, remains an interesting question: my<br/>purpose here is not to suggest a comprehensive solution, only to open<br/>a discussion.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=5829 href="#5829">ðŸ”—</a>William S.

I am quite new to JI and I&apos;m<br/>surprised to find how I&apos;m categorizing intervals.  For example, in<br/>many timbres I consider the septimal or subminor third (7/6) *more*<br/>consonant than the minor third (6/5).  Even more strangely, the ditone<br/>(81/64) doesn&apos;t bug me too much.</p><p> &gt;How one might weigh such many-sided aspects of a tuning system,<br/> &gt;quantitatively or otherwise, remains an interesting question: my<br/> &gt;purpose here is not to suggest a comprehensive solution, only to open<br/> &gt;a discussion.</p><p>        I&apos;m no longer too concerned about quantitative solutions to<br/>the question of consonance.

I managed to join the JI<br/>Network, buy a few books and join this list before putting down the<br/>first note outside 12tet.  My own predisposition to contrapuntal<br/>textures has not made this process any easier, either.  Once I<br/>realized that much music theory I had taught myself would no longer be<br/>providing me with escape routes when I got myself into trouble, I got<br/>down to exploring.  I have to say, realizing that I now had to rely<br/>primarily on my own dubious good taste was both freeing and<br/>terrifying.  Margo, your web page on 13thc polyphony helped me<br/>solidify my way of thinking about some of this material enought to<br/>actually make some music.</p><p>        I&apos;ve been keeping a lot of notes of my explorations, in<br/>additions to pages of manuscript exploring the functional implications<br/>of various sorts of interval progressions.  Perhaps I&apos;ll turn some of<br/>that into a web page and see if the processes I&apos;ve employed are at all<br/>useful to other beginners.</p><p>--<br/>William S.
