Is it around 100 years??</p><p>For wood pulp paper, that&apos;s the generally agreed timescale.</p><p>&gt; And, if so, how do we have the works such as the Montpelier and<br/>&gt; Bamberg codices mentioned above??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Did they use some special kind of paper... or was it something<br/>&gt; *other* than paper...??</p><p>Special kind of paper?  Well, before about ... 100 years ago, most paper<br/>was made of cotton.  That lasts for centuries.  So the worst preserved<br/>books tend to be the earliest not to use cotton paper, rather than the<br/>oldest books.  If you want your music to last, buy acid-free paper.</p><p>Codices could be parchment (animal skin), I&apos;m not sure.  Papyrus also<br/>seems to last.  Clay tablets last for ages, if they&apos;re baked.</p><p>&gt; How can we possibly have music from 1325 or earlier??  Are these<br/>&gt; really the original books?</p><p>I think so.  I saw an old (probably the first) copy of Sumer is a Cumen<br/>In (sp?) a few weeks ago.  It was clearly legible, but not so easily<br/>readable, in that it wasn&apos;t in modern notation.</p><p>&gt; And, if so, what were the books like in the 16th, 17th and 18th<br/>&gt; centuries?  Did they last as long?</p><p>Cotton paper, so pretty much.</p><p>&gt; But, if they would only last 100 years, why would we still have<br/>&gt; them?? Surely they would not be made as &quot;specially&quot; as the monks did<br/>&gt; back in the 13th century (??)</p><p>Printed books tend to be easier to read than manuscripts.  Although those<br/>monks did a good job.</p><p>&gt; Or have things just been re-copied and re-copied??</p><p>For the oldest books, like Homer, Plato, the OT that&apos;s the case.  I don&apos;t<br/>think we have complete manuscripts of any of these before the 2nd Century<br/>AD.  Hence my advice above: make it digital.  Staff notation is fine, but<br/>harder to copy than MIDI.  It also helps for somebody to want to copy it.<br/> If you want it to be discovered in 500 years time, print it clearly on<br/>acid-free paper, and keep it safe and dry.  Make any deviations from<br/>conventional notation (such as alternative tunings) clear.</p><p>Another thing could be to put it on the Web, so that it gets cached all<br/>over the place.</p><p>&gt; Does anybody know about this stuff, or where to look for information??</p><p>I can bluff almost convincingly ;)  Try dropping in at the British Library<br/>next time you&apos;re in town.  Or anywhere that makes paper from cotton -- I<br/>think Wookey Hole does.  But maybe this isn&apos;t so helpful ...</p><p>           Graham</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/3/2000 7:03:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, graham@m... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16169">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16169</a></p><p>Thanks, Graham for the helpful comments on preserving music.

Parchment<br/>certainly has far better longevity than most paper, but again,<br/>it depends on the composition of the paper... some paper is<br/>quite durable and can last hundreds of years.  There are<br/>ancient Egyptian manuscripts written on papyrus (a sort of<br/>paper made from reeds) which are over 4000 years old.</p><p>I had the great fortune a few years ago to be able to study one<br/>of the manuscripts of the infamous _Musica Enchiriadis_ theoretical<br/>treatise, stored in the archives of the Biblotheque Nationale in<br/>Paris, which was written around 1000 AD.  It was written on<br/>parchment and bound like a regular book, and I had to go thru<br/>some serious beaurocratic hoops just to be allowed into the room<br/>in the first place.  Then I wasn&apos;t permitted to actually touch<br/>any part of the book with my fingers except for the cover; it had<br/>to be placed on a wooden reading-stand, and I had to use a wooden<br/>stick with a finger-like tip to turn the pages.  Of course, no<br/>sort of photographing or copying was allowed other than me writing<br/>my own notes by hand.  For a serious scholar like me, it was a<br/>truly awesome experience.</p><p>My point in telling this story is to illustrate the care with<br/>which good libraries handle their precious manuscripts.</p><p>As an example of how climate affects preservation, the Dead Sea<br/>Scrolls are about 2000 years old and probably the only reason<br/>they haven&apos;t disintegrated is because they&apos;ve spent most of<br/>that time hidden in a cave in the desert near Israel - the<br/>dry climate is what preserved them.  Had the cave been damp,<br/>as most are, very little (if anything) would be left of them<br/>by now.</p><p>In contrast, I found a copy of Alois Haba&apos;s first book on<br/>quarter-tone theory at the U. of Penn library, and it&apos;s falling<br/>apart.  The library keeps it sealed in a hard brown manila<br/>folder, tied shut with string, in an attempt to preserve it;<br/>but still, pieces of it inevitably flaked off as I *very gingerly*<br/>photocopied it, taking extreme care with each page-turn.<br/>This book is only 78 years old.  The reason for its deterioration<br/>is that it was printed in Berlin in 1922, during a time of<br/>bizarrely extreme economic inflation in Germany, and so the<br/>paper is ridiculously cheap and of absurdly poor quality.<br/>(List member Jan Haluska is helping me to translate this book<br/>for a webpage publication.)</p><p>Before the invention of the printing press, manuscripts were<br/>copied by hand.  Of course, this caused many errors and minor<br/>changes, so no two copies of any old manuscript are ever<br/>exactly the same.  Often, pieces of parchment was scrubbed<br/>clean and reused; this is called a &apos;palimpsest&apos;.</p><p>(Definition from the Encyclopaedia Britannica:</p><p>&gt; Palimpsest: Manuscript in roll or codex form carrying a text<br/>&gt; erased, or partly erased, underneath an apparent additional<br/>&gt; text. The underlying text is said to be &quot;in palimpsest,&quot; and,<br/>&gt; even though the parchment or other surface is much abraded, the<br/>&gt; older text is recoverable in the laboratory by such means as<br/>&gt; the use of ultraviolet light. The motive for making palimpsests<br/>&gt; usually seems to have been economic--reusing parchment was<br/>&gt; cheaper than preparing a new skin. Another motive may have been<br/>&gt; directed by Christian piety, as in the conversion of a pagan<br/>&gt; Greek manuscript to receive the text of a Father of the Church.)</p><p>This ability to recover the erased text has resulted in the<br/>discovery of many previously unknown documents and musical<br/>compositions.</p><p>A final side note: the most durable means of recording a written<br/>document is to etch it into metal or stone.  The next most<br/>durable method is, perhaps surprisingly, the baked clay tablets<br/>impressed with cuneiform writing, which was the earliest<br/>technique for writing ever devised (by the Sumerians,<br/>c. 3500 BC).  Many of these tablets lie buried under the<br/>sand of Mesopotamia for thousands of years before being<br/>discovered in the 1800s.  An additional, and often overlooked,<br/>aspect of cuneiform tablets is that the writing is 3-dimensional.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>&apos;All roads lead to n^0&apos;</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/2000 8:46:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot; Monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16189">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16189</a></p><p>Thanks so much, Monz, for your comments regarding music preservation.<br/>I found them fascinating, particularly your comments about<br/>personally viewing precious ancient manuscripts!<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; A final side note: the most durable means of recording a written<br/>&gt; document is to etch it into metal or stone.</p><p>I guess I was right about Stonehenge.
