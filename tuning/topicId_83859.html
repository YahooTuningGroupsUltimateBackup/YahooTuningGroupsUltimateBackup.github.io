I wonder if anyone will find this particular technique of interest.

Nice smooth action with some heft to provide touch sensitivity.  I find it better for synth control than for piano.  That&apos;s a Kurzweil K2661 in the picture, though it is not being used in this example.  The tone for the melody is being produced by a Korg Radias, a Korg Z1, and the Korg OASYS PCI -- all tunable to one-cent resolution.  Unfortunately the audio quality is poor due to the camera used and engineer error (which can and will be rectified in future attempts).</p><p>The ratios of the scale used in the piece shown are 1/1, 16/15, 6/5, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5, 9/5.  I love those low prime ratios!  The key to the sonorities potential with this technique is that the pitch bends both begin and end on pure just intervals -- the bending is done with high-precision.  This is possible to due the use of the Doepfer R2M ribbon controller carefully calibrated for accuracy of intervals.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2009 1:49:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi msavante,</p><p>Thanks for the details.  Doepfer rocks!  A bit harder to get<br/>here in the states, unfortunately.  The OASYS PCI card is a<br/>real legend.  I love its physically-modeled electric piano.<br/>I believe Ozric Tentacles used to employ a Z1 to good effect.</p><p>Keep it up!</p><p>-Carl</p><p>&gt; Yes, that&apos;s a Kawai MP5 keyboard.
