These tunings<br/>correspond roughly to 1/3-comma, 1/4-comma, and 1/5-comma meantone.</p><p>Some 12-tet music can be translated to just intonation, but there are often<br/>many possible JI equivalents of a note (e.g., D=9/8 or 10/9, Bb=9/5 or<br/>16/9), and choosing the wrong one may sound very bad (the &quot;wolf fifth&quot;<br/>between 9/8 and 5/3 is 40/27, which is 21.5 cents flat compared with 3/2).<br/>Besides, I think it&apos;s more interesting to take advantage of intervals like<br/>7/6 and 11/9 which aren&apos;t part of the normal 12-tone vocabulary.</p><p>Based on my experiments with 15-tet, 16-tet, and 20-tet, if you want to<br/>use&gt;some of the more exotic scales like these you&apos;ll probably want to develop a<br/>separate music theory for each different non-12 scale. There may be<br/>similarities between some scales. The 16 and 23 note scales both contain<br/>&quot;pseudo-diatonic&quot; scales of 5 small steps and 2 large steps, for instance.<br/>Both also have very flat fifths, close to the 40/27 &quot;wolf fifth&quot;. So you<br/>could probably use similar rules for both scales, although there would be<br/>subtle differences. 23-equal doesn&apos;t have a very good approximation to 7/4,<br/>but 16-equal does.</p></div>
