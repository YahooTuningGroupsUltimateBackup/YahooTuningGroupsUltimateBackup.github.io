Proposed in 1887, it<br/>&gt;   was supposed to be the universal spoken and written language. Dr.<br/>&gt;   L. L. Zamenhof took parts of several languages and made one. Does<br/>&gt;   anyone you know speak Esperanto?</p><p>Hi Stephen,</p><p>I actually learned some Esperanto as a child, but not having anyone<br/>else to speak or listen, read or write it to, it soon fell into disuse.</p><p>I don&apos;t believe this is a good analogy for what we&apos;re doing here.<br/>Because we&apos;re representing not whole words with meaning with our<br/>accidentals, but rather individual sounds, a better analogy would be<br/>to a character set that is used across multiple languages. Remember<br/>the Roman alphabet (also called the Latin alphabet). You&apos;re looking at<br/>it now. And so are speakers of French, German, Italian, Spanish, and<br/>30 or 40 other unrelated languages. And in the other half of the world<br/>Chinese characters were similarly successful in being used for<br/>multiple unrelated languages.</p><p>But I have used the term &quot;lingua franca&quot; myself in reference to the<br/>sagittal system, and so a better analogy here would be to English,<br/>which is (for better or worse) becoming many people&apos;s second language,<br/>in some cases purely for the purpose of communicating with others for<br/>whom English is a second language.</p><p>&gt;     My idea is to have software (any programmers out there) that<br/>&gt;   would take a 4 digit microprinted number next to a note. [look at<br/>&gt;   a new 20 dollar bill, go to the right of the lower left number&apos;20&apos;<br/>&gt;   to see &quot;The United States of America...&quot; to see how small and<br/>&gt;   unobtrusive microprinting can be.] The microprinting would be read<br/>&gt;   by the software and converted to the composers own format. The 4<br/>&gt;   digit number would be the number of cents up from the tonic that<br/>&gt;   the note in question is.</p><p>Such numbers would not have to be printed anywhere but simply stored<br/>COMMENT IS BELOW..................<br/>invisibly by the program. You can already do this sort of thing with<br/>Finale and Sibelius. When you put a symbol on the staff, the index of<br/>the symbol in the symbol-table is what is actually stored. Then you<br/>can edit the symbol-table so that a different symbol appears at that<br/>numbered position and all occurrences in your score will automatically<br/>show the new symbol. But of course these programs aren&apos;t shareware.<br/>They do however have free downloadable demo versions that can&apos;t save<br/>or print.</p><p>&gt;     Over time (50 years?) I would think one or two standards for<br/>&gt;   15 EDO (and all other EDO&apos;s) would emerge on their own just<br/>&gt;   because some are logical and most aren&apos;t.</p><p>Two _have_ emerged. Chain-of-best-fifths with additional accidentals<br/>for one degree up or down, and notation relative to 12-ET with either<br/>cents or additional accidentals for fifth-tones and tenth-tones.</p><p>    I KNOW I HAVE RESPONDED TO THIS ALREADY, BUT JUST IN CASE, THE NUMBERS<br/>    HAVE TO BE PRINTED (MICROPRINTED) ON THE PAGE.THE REASON IS THIS, THE<br/>    PAGE EVENTUALLY, BY SOMEONE WILL BE PRINTED.

The only time anyone would need to scan would<br/>be if they were planning to make illegal copies (with translation) or<br/>if the file got lost or damaged ... on second thoughts, better print<br/>it on the paper. :-)</p></div>
