If not, we could call many<br/>drone-type things &gt;&apos;tonal&apos;, which they are not.</p><p>Perhaps this is the distinction Doty suggests:</p><p>1) What I&apos;ve always called &quot;tonality&quot;<br/>   - the psychoacoustic phenomenon of<br/>     fitting a group of pitches to a harmonic series</p><p>2) What I&apos;ve always called &quot;key&quot;<br/>   - the cognitive phenomenon of locating a<br/>     stimulus within P (a proper map of pitch space)</p><p>The first one, as I understand it, basically depends on the virtual pitch<br/>mechanism, provided roughness is low enough for it to work.  To the extent<br/>that this does not imply a harmonic series, by combination tones or perhaps<br/>some hard-wired preference, tonality can be established by fitting a group<br/>to an inharmonic series.</p><p>The second one is best explained by Rothenberg.  See his series of 5 papers<br/>published to Mathematical Systems Theory in the late 1970&apos;s (Myhill was on<br/>the Editorial board at the time, I see).  I have read the three of them<br/>that are listed in the Microtonal bibliography...</p><p>ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/papers/bib.html</p><p>They are the single most important body of theory on melody known to me,<br/>laying down a framework capable of supplying a useful explanation for just<br/>about every melodic phenomenon there is.  The strength of the explanations<br/>may be easily over-estimated, and maybe Rothenberg suffers from this a<br/>little bit, but on the whole he is a first-rate theorist who applies his<br/>model with impressive accuracy.</p><p>R. calls a stimulus that occupies a unique location in P a &quot;sufficient<br/>set&quot;.  Sufficient sets which have no subsets that are both sufficient and<br/>proper are called &quot;minimal sets&quot;.  &quot;Efficiency&quot; is basically the percent of<br/>the scale you need to hear, on average, before a sufficient set occurs.<br/>This amounts to asking when the listener will be able to measure intervals<br/>by scale degrees.  In 12tET&apos;s 5-limit diatonic, the key-minimal set is the<br/>diminished triad.  [It is interesting to speculate on the fact that this<br/>contains the disjuct fifth (and the only ambiguous interval in the scale),<br/>and that scales without modes (like the &quot;wholetone&quot; scale) are necessarily<br/>without ambiguous intervals.]</p><p>So, I would say that &quot;drone-type things&quot; tend to meet both of these<br/>criteria quite well.  By the first, one might say that the tonality is<br/>static, but certainly not weak.</p><p>By the second, OTOH, the tonality is probably shifting more than in most<br/>western music.  Even tho the scales used in such are often improper, the<br/>drone provides the reference needed to measure intervals in scale degrees.<br/>But since the scale is improper, the key will constantly be shifting as<br/>various proper subsets are sectioned off.  It could be that Mr. Sanford<br/>does not hear this as being tonal because he is used to scales with a<br/>relatively high efficiency.  Improper scales may work best with low<br/>efficiency.</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Each one<br/>is great for melody but connecting the two sounds awkward.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/1999 7:22:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Efficiency&quot; is basically the percent of the scale you need to hear, on<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;average, before a sufficient set occurs.  This amounts to asking when<br/>the &gt;&gt;&gt;listener will be able to measure intervals by scale degrees.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Why is that?  A random scale has 100% efficiency, unless you meant<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;minimal&quot; instead of &quot;sufficient&quot; in the second-to-last sentence above.</p><p>I mean sufficient.  There&apos;s nothing that says high efficiency is somehow<br/>good...</p><p>This involves a distinction I didn&apos;t make earlier.  All of R.&apos;s measures<br/>apply to codes, not stimuli.  That is, a random scale may have 100%<br/>information, but it can not have 100% efficiency.  R.&apos;s idea is that people<br/>need a code (I take this to be very hardware-abstracted stuff) to get<br/>key-effects from pitch data.  Thus, the random scale might sound like a<br/>mistuned diatonic scale to an average western listener.  The idea is that<br/>after enough exposure to the scale, one learns a code just for it.  So<br/>scales are evaluated only by the type of code they imply, and the point of<br/>the whole thing is to predict what kind of music best takes advantage of<br/>the code.  This is difficult, but I believe R. has made useful predictions<br/>with it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;In any other regular diatonic tuning, the key-minimal set is the tritone.<br/>&gt;&gt;Do you think that spells a qualitative difference between the diatonic<br/>&gt;&gt;scale in 12tET and that in other regular tunings (I sure don&apos;t!)?</p><p>The nature of the minimal set shouldn&apos;t matter that much.  What should<br/>matter more is the overall efficiency, which Rothenberg claims is stable<br/>for the diatonic scale across all tunings with reasonable fifths.</p><p>&gt;&gt;What is the point of saying &quot;5-limit&quot; above?</p><p>In this case, it probably didn&apos;t matter.  But you never know... it&apos;s not<br/>quite the same scale at the 5-limit as it is at the 3-limit, is it?</p><p>&gt;&gt;Do you think it consequential that the Pythagorean diatonic scale is not<br/>&gt;&gt;proper?</p><p>I think things ought to be run thru some sort of fit function, or whatever,<br/>before being subjected to R.&apos;s measures.  Something to prevent 1 cent<br/>differences from impropering them...</p><p>I&apos;ve been screaming in favor of the just diatonic scale on this list for<br/>two years, and in general I believe that almost any scale can be<br/>successfully approximated during skillful tours of (pick your limit) JI.</p><p>I&apos;ve also praised the melodic usefulness of harmonic series segments, which<br/>are often improper.  Impropriety isn&apos;t bad, but I believe it does influence<br/>how these scales are used.  Melody almost always involves making proper<br/>subsets of the master scale, wether or not the master scale is proper<br/>itself.  With harmonics 8-15, I noticed myself treating 13 and 15 as<br/>passing tones before I knew anything about propriety.  They are good<br/>passing tones, tho, and they are fantastic harmonically...</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;[It is interesting to speculate on the fact that this contains the<br/>disjuct &gt;&gt;&gt;fifth (and the only ambiguous interval in the scale), and that<br/>scales &gt;&gt;&gt;without modes (like the &quot;wholetone&quot; scale) are necessarily<br/>without &gt;&gt;&gt;ambiguous intervals.]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;The diatonic scale in meantone tuning is proper (not that I think that<br/>&gt;&gt;matters) and has no ambiguous intervals.</p><p>It matters for something.  What it is might not be as simple or as strong<br/>as you seem to want it to be.</p><p>Here&apos;s a few items regarding a possible relation between ambiguous<br/>intervals, minimal sets, and the &quot;disjunct&quot; position in MOS chains:</p><p>While the augmented fourth and diminished fiths aren&apos;t ambiguous in<br/>meantone, they do represent a blurring between the two classes.</p><p>The key-minimal set in meantone is the disjoint 5th, according to you.  In<br/>12tET it is the disjoint 5th plus a third note, according to R.  For MOS&apos;s<br/>that are proper but not strictly so, the disjoint fifth was ambiguous in<br/>every case considered by John Chalmers (tho he just looked at it briefly).</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;By the second, OTOH, the tonality is probably shifting more than in most<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;western music.  Even tho the scales used in such are often improper, the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;drone provides the reference needed to measure intervals in scale degrees.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t understand.  Did you mean the reference needed to locate your<br/>&gt;&gt;position within the scale?</p><p>Yes.  I am a little weak on the locating part, and need to think about it<br/>some more.  Obviously, and the point is, composition plays a big role in<br/>all this.  If the composer purposely avoids all sufficient sets, then<br/>efficiency is sort of out the window -&gt; except that it determines what must<br/>be avoided and at what cost...</p><p>Carl</p><p>P.S.  I just noticed, both the pentachoral and symmetrical decatonic scales<br/>are strictly proper in 22tET :~)</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/1999 10:26:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The thing Rotherberg and the others miss is the second order MOS&apos;s.<br/>Scales such as C E F G B or<br/>G B C D F.
