I changed my mind about a lot of things because<br/>of this.<br/>- Meanwhile, Petr&apos;s been continuing the Great Comma Pump Revolution of 2011,<br/>which is related to tonality and was also very influential on my paradigm of<br/>how tonality works.<br/>- Additionally, I outlined some basic observations that might scale upward<br/>into a theory for melody (sequences of notes agglutinate into the sensation<br/>of &quot;arpeggiated chords,&quot; the brain reifies in the consonance of the chord<br/>even though VF perception isn&apos;t taking place), although it seems to need<br/>some more tweaking to adequately describe everyone&apos;s perception.</p><p>At the end of the day, there seem to be a few differing ideas floating<br/>around, and I&apos;m now pretty confused and not sure I understand concretely how<br/>tonality works. So I thought I&apos;d issue a challenge to the members of the<br/>list to apply their understanding of tonality to superpyth[7], which has the<br/>potential to be a gold mine in this subfield of study. Superpyth has the<br/>following properties</p><p>1) If we&apos;re in C ionian, there are four 4:6:7 &quot;major&quot; chords - over D, E, G,<br/>and A.<br/>2) There are three 4:6:7:9 extended &quot;major&quot; chords - over D, G, and A. E has<br/>a flatted 9th.<br/>3) There are two 14:21:27 &quot;minor&quot; chords - over C and F.<br/>4) There is one ~8:11:14 &quot;I don&apos;t know what&quot; chord - over B.</p><p>I&apos;ve been playing around in it on my 22-equal guitar and it sounds amazing -<br/>the 4:6:7 chords from this scale in 22-equal just produce an entirely<br/>different sensation than the same notes would in 12-equal. It&apos;s like I&apos;m<br/>deriving another hidden musical universe out of the same diatonic notes<br/>we&apos;re all used to. But getting away from the nice sensation of there being<br/>lots of random 4:6:7 chords everywhere and moving towards a tonal system<br/>that can communicate information entirely via the logic of the system is<br/>proving trickier.</p><p>So my question is, how would you guys on the list (Kalle, Petr, perhaps Carl<br/>or anyone else with some ideas) analyze this scale? What would the strongest<br/>resolutions be? Would the 8:11:14 work as a higher-limit dominant 7th that<br/>resolves to E? Or would the E resolve to A, because the b2 creates an<br/>instability? I have no idea, but would love to hear everyone&apos;s thoughts.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=100965 href="#100965">ðŸ”—</a>petrparizek2000 &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/29/2011 9:32:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt; So my question is, how would you guys on the list (Kalle, Petr, perhaps Carl<br/>&gt; or anyone else with some ideas) analyze this scale?

I wasn&apos;t too<br/>concerned with inverses and utonality, but with triad classes -<br/>14:21:27 shares a triad class with 4:6:7 in superpyth[7]. Furthermore,<br/>14:21:27 is sort of analogous to 10:12:15 in meantone[7] in that it<br/>consists of 2/3 with some &quot;crap&quot; thrown in there; the 3/2 on the<br/>bottom makes it rooted but the 9/7 on top doesn&apos;t fit in any sort of<br/>meaningful way. The outer dyad is around 1150 cents, which whole thing<br/>sounds sort of ambiguous and maximally unresolved, perhaps between<br/>something like 8:12:15 and 2:3:4 at first, but whatever it is it&apos;s<br/>certainly more dissonant and &quot;sadder,&quot; whatever you want to call it.</p><p>&gt; My personal problem is that these &quot;minor&quot; 7-limit chords sound so unresolved to me and unconvincing that I probably wouldn&apos;t use them as a &quot;resting state&quot; as I would a 5-limit minor triad.</p><p>I hear both 14:21:24 and 14:21:27 as sounding resolved. The second one<br/>is a bit more dissonant and &quot;ambiguous&quot; at first, to my ear between<br/>8:12:15 and 2:3:4, but I found that after some exposure to the chord I<br/>started to perceive this ambiguous sensation as being just what the<br/>chord &quot;is&quot; - the chord itself is neither of those, but a dissonant<br/>entity that doesn&apos;t really resolve either way. This is when it started<br/>to take on the &quot;sad&quot; gestalt.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101161 href="#101161">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/12/2011 11:21:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;ve thrown a lot of interesting ideas about tonality out there in the past<br/>&gt; few weeks.<br/>&gt; - I had a great conversation with Kalle, where we discussed an evolved form<br/>&gt; of Paul&apos;s views on Pajara.

The<br/>chord that then functions as the dominant (in one generalized sense)<br/>will be a chord that requires the tonic in order to resolve in the<br/>most satisfactory way.

But one possible response to this is<br/>that in common practice they are not really independent chords but<br/>rather contrapuntal simultaneities resulting from voice leading.

Or would the E resolve to A, because the b2 creates an<br/>&gt; instability? I have no idea, but would love to hear everyone&apos;s thoughts.</p><p>First of all, in the past when I&apos;ve played in superpyth I&apos;ve mostly stuck to a neo-Gothic, only-3-is-consonant paradigm a la Margo Schulter. ( <a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html</a> ) Listen to some Perotin if you want to hear great examples of this kind of harmony. So it&apos;s really interesting to use it in a different way where 7 and 9 are consonant too.</p><p>When I&apos;m trying to accept 4:6:7 and 4:6:7:9 as consonant chords and avoid always resolving to fifths and 2:3:4 &quot;trines&quot;, I think I really prefer roots moving by seconds rather than by fourths or fifths, if only because of the better voice leading. For example, in your B -&gt; E progression, what voice is supposed to move to the D of the E chord? That note kind of has to come out of nowhere. B -&gt; A makes a lot more sense to me. Similarly moving between A and G makes more sense than trying to use D as a &quot;subdominant&quot; for A. I mean, all of them sound good, but the ones that move by seconds seem like they&apos;re stronger or work out better.</p><p>I guess you don&apos;t really worry about these things as much on a guitar, because you just play a big chord and don&apos;t worry about what the individual &quot;voices&quot; are doing. But the idea of &quot;roots moving by seconds&quot; might still be interesting to you.</p><p>Lastly, there are some wonderful chords waiting just a little outside the 7-note &quot;diatonic&quot; MOS. For example G-B-Eb is a great 7:9:11 chord that I hear as &quot;resolving&quot; to A in a way, even though both chords are part of the same harmonic series. I just love that neutral second between Eb and E. (I guess I&apos;m really using the <a href="http://2.3.7.11">2.3.7.11</a> temperament &quot;supra&quot; here, not superpyth, because I like that B-Eb is definitely a neutral third and not a 6/5. In 22-equal they&apos;re the same interval, but maybe the thing I&apos;m talking about still works.)</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=5+12&limit=2.3.7.11">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=5+12&limit=2.3.7.11</a></p><p>Keenan</p></div>
