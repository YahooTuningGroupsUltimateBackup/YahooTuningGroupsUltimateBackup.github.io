I&apos;ve downloaded the clips and had a quick look at some<br/>spectrograms. While I need to study them further, there was one thing I<br/>noticed right away. Instead of generating subharmonic partials, what is<br/>happening is that the main note you are singing is becomming the third<br/>partial of a series with a fundamental a twelvth lower. What shows up on the<br/>spectrogram is both a fifth and a twelvth below the principal sung note.<br/>Fascinating stuff!</p><p>dante</p></div><h3><a id=4293 href="#4293">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com">PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Jim Cole wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I forgot to ask last night if on the spectrogram there is the octave below<br/>&gt;the<br/>&gt;&gt;principal sung note.  I hear it and esp. before the octave and fifth below<br/>&gt;&gt;principal note sung (hereafter &quot;pns&quot;) kicks in.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You would usually hear the octave below before hearing the twelfth below<br/>&gt;because period-2 behavior, followed by all powers of 2, usually occur<br/>before<br/>&gt;period 3 in the progression from linear to more and more nonlinear<br/>dynamics.<br/>&gt;You might still hear it, if you&apos;re trying to, after the twelfth below kicks<br/>&gt;in, since many of its harmonics are still present and strong, as harmonics<br/>&gt;of the new fundamental.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;What puzzles me<br/>&gt;&gt;also is that I don&apos;t hear &quot;sub 4&quot; (two octaves below pns) while<br/>progressing<br/>&gt;from<br/>&gt;&gt;sub 3 to sub 5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This too is explained by the fact that all powers of 2 usually occur before<br/>&gt;any powers of any odd numbers. All powers of 2 can fit within a finite<br/>&gt;portion of parameter space (along the axis which defines the &quot;degree of<br/>&gt;nonlinearity&quot;) since each power of 2 occupies a range of parameter values<br/>&gt;that is 1/4.67 times smaller than that occupied by the previous power of<br/>two<br/>&gt;(at least analytically in the typical case of a quadratic nonlinearity and<br/>&gt;experimentally in many physical situations).

I tried the link above but<br/>got a &quot;not found on this server&quot; message.  Anyone else here able to access<br/>it?  I&apos;ve been having trouble with my server frequently of late so I wonder<br/>if that&apos;s the problem.  I have ordered those books on chaos theory, fractals<br/>and power laws that you (Paul) and others on this list have referred me to -<br/>still waiting eagerly for them so that I might begin to understand the<br/>theoretical and mathematical principles involved.</p><p>Check out Scientific American&apos;s Sept. issue - there&apos;s a feature on throat<br/>singing.
