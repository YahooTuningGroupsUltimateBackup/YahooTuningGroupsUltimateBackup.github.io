Scales like the Blackwood Decatonic use a period of 1/5 of an octave (240 cents), and there are plenty of scales with 1/2 octave periods.</p></div><h3><a id=90233 href="#90233">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2010 1:54:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;John H.

Paul finally<br/>decided to call everything DES (Distributionally Even Scales),<br/>but then IIRC there was some problem with that, and anyway it<br/>didn&apos;t stick.  What seems to have happened is that MOS has become<br/>the umbrella term.  It seems fair to me.  There&apos;s really no need<br/>to have two terms, since the octatonic scale is MOS within a<br/>1/4-octave period.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=90239 href="#90239">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2010 2:10:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you give an example of a scale you would call maximally even<br/>&gt; but not MOS/WF?</p><p>So the reference for this is the Clough et al A Taxonomy paper,<br/>now appearing in a files section near you (see the table on<br/>the 3rd page).  -Carl</p></div><h3><a id=90240 href="#90240">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2010 2:12:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It seems fair to me.

A maximally even scale only applies to scales constructed inside rank one tunings, basically meaning EDOs, and requires the specific intervals in the class to be consecutive integers in terms of the step size.</p><p>It strikes me as a gross misnomer for several reasons: only rank one is *truly* &quot;maximally even&quot;, and there&apos;s nothing obviously maximal about the evenness of requiring consecutive integers. That entails that the scale notes are not too small a proportion of the total notes, which seems to have nothing much to do with evenness.</p></div><h3><a id=90254 href="#90254">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2010 4:54:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; It seems fair to me.
