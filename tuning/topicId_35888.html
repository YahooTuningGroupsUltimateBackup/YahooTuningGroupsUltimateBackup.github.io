Well, I have my own doubts as well.</p><p>I mentioned to her that I managed to &quot;streamline&quot; this entire process<br/>by using a new notation by Ezra Sims which uses only 1/6th whole tone<br/>and 1/12 whole tones, in addition to standard quartertones.</p><p>Quite frankly, I believe I can &quot;sell&quot; that system better than<br/>the &quot;cents&quot; one, since I believe I can realistically *hear* it.</p><p>I realize that not everybody agrees with this appraisal, but I just<br/>wanted to report my own *personal* experiences and why I am feeling<br/>more &quot;comfortable&quot; at the moment in working with 72-tET rather than<br/>with 1200-tET...</p><p>I will gladly &quot;toast&quot; to those with more refined hearing than my<br/>own...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>shreeswifty &#x3C;ppagano@bellsouth.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2002 6:17:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message ----- &gt; I will gladly &quot;toast&quot; to those with more<br/>refined hearing than my<br/>&gt; own...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson</p><p>I have always been more for an english muffin than toast Joeseph<br/>what kind of electronics bubby?<br/>do tell</p><p>Pat</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>3/26/2002 6:20:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 3/26/02 9:02:51 PM Eastern Standard Time, <a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a><br/>writes:</p><p>&gt; She is a performer who has only had a *very* limited experience with<br/>&gt; microtonality, basically confined to quartertones, which she has no<br/>&gt; problem with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Man, you really are in a fishbowl.
