In the<br/>&quot;Meantone Temperament in Theory and Practice&quot; record he and Fritz A.<br/>Kuttner put out in the 1950&apos;s (Musurgia Records, Series A, No.2),<br/>Barbour says of the recorded example of Bach&apos;s Prelude #6 in D-minor<br/>from Book 1 of the Well-Tempered Clavier (in Silbermann&apos;s 1/6-comma<br/>tuning (G#-Eb)):</p><p>&quot;In fact, this Prelude sounds magnificent in the 1/6 comma tuning where<br/>it is enhanced by a poignancy and beauty of interval coloration that<br/>cannot easily be duplicated in equal temperament. The conclusion is<br/>fully justified that equal temperament need not always be superior to<br/>Silbermann&apos;s meantone system. It was for good reasons that this tuning<br/>enjoyed popularity in the middle of the eighteenth century.&quot;</p><p>I might add tht most of the examples in the three recordings that were<br/>released on the Musurgia series appear to have been chosen to highlight<br/>the problems rather than the virtues of every tuning but 12-tet. He is<br/>less effusive about 1/4 comma, even when he has chosen appropriate<br/>examples  and seems unwilling to admit that it may be anything other<br/>than effective or smooth.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3><a id=3540 href="#3540">ðŸ”—</a>Brett Barbaro &#x3C;barbaro@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/1999 10:38:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John Chalmers wrote:</p><p>&gt;Paul: Interesting, what formula did you use to approximate Barbour&apos;s RVF<br/>&gt;tuning?</p><p>John -- I just repeated the Barbour tuning as just reported by you, and my<br/>tuning is just as I described before, but with a larger multiplier on the<br/>cosine term (i. e. a bigger clock face).</p></div><h3><a id=3541 href="#3541">ðŸ”—</a>Brett Barbaro &#x3C;barbaro@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/1999 10:41:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;John Chalmers wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Paul: Interesting, what formula did you use to approximate Barbour&apos;s RVF<br/>&gt;&gt;tuning?<br/>&gt;<br/>I wrote:</p><p>&gt;John -- I just repeated the Barbour tuning as just reported by you, and my<br/>&gt;tuning is just as I described before, but with a larger multiplier on the<br/>&gt;cosine term (i. e. a bigger clock face).<br/>&gt;<br/>Duh, of course you knew that.
