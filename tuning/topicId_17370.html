But this much like the<br/>example you gave is not trivalent, and  note that 1, 1, 4, 6, 11, 21,<br/>... does not meet the above condition. However, by changing accbcc<br/>into acbbcc you turn the [1,1,4] into a [1,2,3] where an equidistant<br/>m-out-of-n derived from 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, ... gives</p><p>0 120 360 540 720  960 1200<br/>0 240 420 600 840 1080 1200<br/>0 180 360 600 840  960 1200<br/>0 180 420 660 780 1020 1200<br/>0 240 480 600 840 1020 1200<br/>0 240 360 600 780  960 1200</p><p>And this is trivalent.</p><p>Now this would seem to me to solve the problem by introducing the<br/>half-octave to the scales midpoint -- i.e., P/2.
