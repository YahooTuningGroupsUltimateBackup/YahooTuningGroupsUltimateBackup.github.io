It&apos;s<br/>&gt; meantone, and there&apos;s a lot more flexibility in it than it<br/>&gt; commonly gets credit for in the microtonal community.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Not just meantone.  I just wrote a big &quot;Pythagorean&quot; piece in 12, 17 and 29.  All notated with regular old # and b  .</p><p>I like the idea of using &quot;oral tradition&quot; rather than / in addition to scores.  It&apos;s true in the rhythmic domain as well.  Some of my music uses crazy tuplets and complex rhythms,  but I am more and more into the performer learning the rhythms by rote from a demo.  This is music that many people would consider to be Notated with a capital &quot;N&quot;--yet perhaps it&apos;s best approached from the opposite direction.</p><p>Ah music.  Always non-linearly flipping us to some unexpected zone.</p></div><h3><a id=64966 href="#64966">ðŸ”—</a>Dante Rosati &#x3C;dante@interport.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2006 7:12:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I was just explaining to my guitar class the other day how in musics like<br/>Flamenco and Rock, the superior form of notation is tab + a recording. The<br/>tab tells you where to put your fingers and the recording has all the other<br/>information: rhythm, tempo, tone, dynamics, nuance, articulation, etc. In<br/>the case of a style like the blues the recording also has all the<br/>information about microtonal inflection that is needed to reproduce it<br/>accurately. In a style that you&apos;re very familar with, the tab is often not<br/>even needed, as the instrumental configurations are evident.</p><p>In a new piece with unfamilar intonational and/or rhythmic complexity, I<br/>would consider a midi rendition my best friend as I was learning it. I spent<br/>a few minutes the other day entering the first page of a Babbitt guitar<br/>piece into Sibelius so I could hear some strange nested tuplets rendered<br/>exactly. If I had to record or perform it, I&apos;m sure I would take the time to<br/>enter the whole thing so I could play along with it for practice.</p></div><h3><a id=64968 href="#64968">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2006 8:35:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Notation is obviously limited.  I explain to my guitar and voice students<br/>hownotation came to be centered around voice and piano, but within the<br/>tradition of meantone.  It obviously doesn&apos;t apply perfectly to guitar.<br/>Nor does it apply to barbershop perfectly.</p><p>Once that is recognized, and we realize that the notation isn&apos;t the<br/>music, it is still useful, however.</p><p>Barbershoppers tend to call the music page, &quot;the spots,&quot; meaning<br/>the little dots on the page we use as a guide and reference.</p><p>For barbershop specifically, I think the best thing that could be<br/>added to the notation is simply an indication of what part of the<br/>chord each note is.  Simply knowing when the baritone is on the<br/>root, or the seventh is VERY useful.  It will generally be up to the<br/>bass to establish the harmonic movements, and basses are used<br/>to singing relatively pythagorean.  And actually, this information<br/>is available in standard notation to anyone who knows enough theory<br/>to analyze it.</p><p>The biggest issue in the barbershop world is preserving the tradition<br/>of woodshedding by ear, and to keep ET trained pianists from doing<br/>sloppy arranging without understanding the issues.</p><p>Check out Dave Steven&apos;s amazing description of the oral tradition<br/>he learned barbershop from (although he also, for better or worse<br/>relates to piano too).  This is wonderfully entertaining as well:<br/><a href="http://stellent.spebsqsa.org/web/groups/public/documents/native/cb_00083.ram">http://stellent.spebsqsa.org/web/groups/public/documents/native/cb_00083.ram</a></p><p>Overall, I have to strongly agree that without the oral tradition<br/>and recordings and live experiences of barbershop, the notation<br/>would not have preserved this style.  Just like certainly we have lost<br/>some authentic aspects of traditional classical music, since the notation<br/>does not cover everything.</p><p>And the worst part is when we get some dogmatic fellow who<br/>thinks it is terrible that barbershoppers can&apos;t always pluck out their<br/>parts on a piano by reading the score, and don&apos;t know how to<br/>follow the written rhythms exactly.  That sort of dogmatism is so<br/>awful and naive and yet somehow I never see it coming.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=64977 href="#64977">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2006 11:28:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Wolf&quot; &lt;backfromthesilo@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; For barbershop specifically, I think the best thing that could be<br/>&gt; added to the notation is simply an indication of what part of the<br/>&gt; chord each note is.

But at this point, since it is not a<br/>music that is controlled by overbearing composers<br/>there&apos;s no way to say that it has to be one or the other.<br/>Nobody can say one is right.  And it is unlikely that<br/>average singers could learn to differentiate with only<br/>notation as a guide.  So in the end, this leads back<br/>to your original statement, that notation isn&apos;t the<br/>solution.  It might be nice to have a way to notate<br/>that difference, but since most singers use notation<br/>only as a general guide and a vague &quot;the note is going<br/>up&quot; or &quot;note is going down,&quot; I don&apos;t think such complex<br/>notation would mean anything to the vast majority of<br/>barbershoppers.</p><p>It would be wonderful to come up with a better system.<br/>I think the notation should show these factors:<br/>Comma movement of roots, key changes, vague or general<br/>melodic motion of pitch, and harmonic content.<br/>I could imagine a system in which different shaped<br/>note-heads indicate whether a note is the root, third,<br/>fifth, seventh, ninth, or other harmonic element.<br/>Then have a single big symbol indicating comma shifts<br/>of roots overall.
