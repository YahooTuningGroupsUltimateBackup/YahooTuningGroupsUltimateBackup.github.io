However, you seem to think that &quot;normal&quot; notes are<br/>like buttons to be pressed.</p><p>In brass, just intervals are most natural to play as a result of the<br/>harmonics.  Computing ET quartertones, sixthtones, and twelfth tones, is as hard or<br/>harder than playing pure relationships.</p><p>Strings have no points of reference other than harmonics.  They too can<br/>negotiate from harmonics easier than ET divisions.</p><p>Woodwinds merely need different fingerings.  The instruments were based on<br/>these just relationships, with keys added to them in order for them to navigate<br/>12-tET.  In some ways, these are the easiest instruments of all for just<br/>because the fingerings put the player (albeit once discovered) right in the ball<br/>park.  And the training of the ear to just is a more laudable ability for<br/>harmony than any temperament can be.  This may seem a value judgment, but it comes<br/>from a polymicrotonalist that uses all possibilities of intervals for their<br/>idiosyncratic characters.</p><p>&gt;He doesn&apos;t have to think about anything but these *three*<br/>&gt;inflections, so anything additional adds to the process...</p><p>JP</p><p>Once again, are you speaking for the players here?
