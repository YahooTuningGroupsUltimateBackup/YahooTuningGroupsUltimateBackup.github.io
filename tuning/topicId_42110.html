The technicolor joy he<br/>brought - first to life, and then to art - has been quieted. Those<br/>that had the pleasure to know and work with him feel a loss that is<br/>palpable, but also rejoice in the huge body of work (or *play* might<br/>be a better word!) that he leaves us, visual and aural reminders of a<br/>spirit that seemed, until now, larger than life itself.</p><p>Harry. Lou. Tuning up, somewhere else now. What can we do, as the<br/>world seems ever more grim, color drained from it?</p><p>Cherish, Conserve, Consider, Create.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=42111 href="#42111">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>2/3/2003 1:22:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I am stunned.  I had just heard Lou&apos;s orchestral works at the Focus festival<br/>on Friday.  We had noticed 3 different apologies in the program for not<br/>having microtones to present.  (1. no Harry Partch because his music needs<br/>special instruments, 2. no just intonation celeste for the piece they did<br/>perform, and 3. no microtonal pieces by Harrison--though they could have done<br/>the Piano Concerto in Kirnberger II.)  Well, at least Joel Sachs is<br/>self-conscious about it now.  Juilliard needs to change.</p><p>When I was visiting with Lou and Bill, Lou told me how he wanted to die.  He<br/>wanted no pain and to go in a big way: he got part of the wish, maybe the<br/>most important part.  Lou told me that Bill Colvig and he wanted their Aptos<br/>home to straddle the San Andreas fault and the next largest one.  This way,<br/>if the big one hit, he could go out BIG time!  I am so sorry to hear that<br/>this wonderful spirit of music has ceased to breathe life.  Thanks, Kyle, for<br/>filling us all in.</p><p>All the very best to the community in this sad time.  best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=42112 href="#42112">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E; &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2003 1:54:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny,</p><p>Thanks for your remembrances of Lou.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Lou told me that Bill Colvig and he wanted their Aptos</p><p>&gt; home to straddle the San Andreas fault and the next largest</p><p>&gt; one.
