After reading your posts and the associations with<br/>language, I am beginning to understand that it is the FLEXIBILITY in<br/>usage that he is going after in his &quot;efficiency&quot; quotient.  So, it<br/>basically is the MULTIPLICITY that makes a scale or language<br/>&quot;efficient.&quot;<br/>I&apos;m still not sure, then why the totally symmetrical scale would,<br/>therefore, not also be &quot;efficient,&quot; but, perhaps it becomes<br/>&quot;over-efficient,&quot; almost neutral!</p><p>Thanks again for all the help!</p><p>__________ _____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
