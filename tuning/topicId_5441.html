It takes time for the wheat to be sifted<br/>from the chaff, and even what future generations decide to value can change<br/>over time. The so-called &quot;classical cannon&quot; is largely European with some<br/>American offshoots at the very end. Overlapping it is the beginnings of the<br/>&quot;American Canon&quot;  the creation of bruthahs and sistahs in this country, with<br/>some lesser contributions by palefaces. This then becomes a commercial<br/>export and influences (or infects, depending on how you look at it) the rest<br/>of the world, as in world-pop. The American canon consists of the<br/>Ellingtons, Parkers, Hollidays, Hendrixs...etc.</p><p>The attempts at carrying on the European &quot;classical canon&quot;, mostly found in<br/>academic settings in America and Europe, are largely failures because they<br/>are too self-consciously &gt;trying&lt; to gain admittance for themselves to the<br/>&quot;Canon&quot;. Thus they lose their authenticity in nostalgia and become overly<br/>abstract. This is proved by the fact that, for the most part, nobody gives a<br/>shit about it except the few participants.</p><p>Calling &quot;dots on paper&quot; a tyranny, or something similar, is perhaps<br/>hyperbolic, and any limitations posed by it are only in the minds of those<br/>who chose to be limited. The dots are a tool, nothing more, useful for<br/>notating certain aspects of some kinds of music.</p><p>I have long felt that a recording of a musical performance is a &quot;notation&quot;<br/>so far superior to any written notation that its not even funny. In many<br/>respects, contemporary guitar traditions have the healthiest approach to<br/>this. In both the flamenco and electric guitar traditions, it is the<br/>recording and perhaps a tabulature which enables successful reproduction of<br/>a piece of music. The tabulature is a summary of technical information to<br/>aid in the manipulation of an instrument to produce a rough approximation of<br/>a work. The many important details of execution are contained in the<br/>recording. The more one is familiar with the style, the less need there is<br/>for the tab, and the more one is able to get all one&apos;s information from the<br/>recording. This is of course geared towards reproduction of the music; if<br/>one is interested in analysis then perhaps a spectrogram is the superior<br/>form of notation, as it is amenable to quantitative analysis.</p><p>The &quot;dots on a page&quot; approach was no doubt meant to be supplemented with<br/>aural familiarity with the style in question at the time when the music was<br/>composed. It is only because we have no recordings of Beethoven&apos;s music from<br/>his time that it became necessary to fetishize the written score and elevate<br/>it to a kind of sacred text from which the faithful hoped to extract the<br/>&quot;true&quot; meaning and then render the &quot;true&quot; performance. The performance of<br/>even older musics, say from the middle ages, becomes a kind of cryptological<br/>exercise whose success at reproducing what the music may have sounded like<br/>at the time will forever be unknown. (except for the possibility of<br/>trans-temporal clairvoyant access, which I suspect is actually possible.<br/>Imagine someday musicologists training in meditation so they can access<br/>directly the akashic sonic traces of the past. EMAHO!)</p><p>You can&apos;t &quot;open up the cannon&quot;, all you can do is make music you like. Its<br/>up to future generations to decide if it has any value for them.</p><p>As far as it being eurocentic and male dominated, there is a funny/sad quote<br/>(maybe Anthony Burgess?): &quot;When the Zulus have a Tolstoy, I will read him.&quot;</p><p>dante</p></div><h3><a id=5447 href="#5447">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rmcgowan@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/1999 1:07:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dante Rosati gave a long post about midi/score/performance... and I happen<br/>to disagree with some of it, mostly in terms of definitions and purposes for<br/>various manifestations of music.  So I&apos;ll give my take on what is a score...<br/>He said...</p><p>&gt; I have long felt that a recording of a musical performance is a<br/>&gt; &quot;notation&quot; so far superior to any written notation that its not<br/>&gt; even funny.</p><p>A recording has a different purpose than a score; it&apos;s not &quot;superior&quot; it&apos;s<br/>&quot;completely different&quot;.</p><p>Recordings are great things, but they&apos;re not &quot;scores&quot;.  They have different<br/>uses and purposes.  A recording is to a musical score more like an audio<br/>cassette is to a book.  A recording is great in that it gives posterity a<br/>&quot;perfect&quot; reproduction of a particular performer(s) doing an interpretation<br/>of something.  It might be &quot;the definitive&quot; performance -- such as an awesome<br/>improvisation by Jimi Hendrix or Ravi Shankar; but it might also be just<br/>another interpretation of something with an independent abstract<br/>representation, like a Beethoven symphony.  What do I mean?  For instance, a<br/>group of fifty people would be hard pressed to produce an opera like Madame<br/>Butterfly given only a recording of it to work from.  It&apos;s a vastly complex<br/>piece of music lasting nearly three hours, and including a huge number of<br/>parts for an array of players and singers.  So in this case, a score is the<br/>preferred representation for someone intending to reproduce the opera; it is<br/>not the preferred representation for someone wishing to LISTEN to the opera<br/>-- for that, either a live production or recording is preferred.  A MIDI file<br/>could be used to represent the work, certainly... but that&apos;s also different<br/>from a score of the work.</p><p>For the most part, a MIDI file isn&apos;t a &quot;score&quot; -- it&apos;s a sort of &quot;low<br/>fidelity&quot; recording medium that records, more or less accurately, a<br/>particular set of gestures that can be used to play back an interpretation of<br/>a piece of music, perhaps with adjusted instrumentation, etc.  But a MIDI<br/>file that&apos;s a &quot;good performance&quot; of some work isn&apos;t as good as a score at<br/>providing the essence (or &quot;skeleton&quot;) of that musical piece if one&apos;s purpose<br/>is to produce another interpretation.  The MIDI file contains a lot of<br/>extraneous information while obscuring certain abstractions -- for instance,<br/>precise details as to how a chord is rolled by a particular pianist at a<br/>particular point in time; whereas a score would indicate the fact of a chord<br/>to be rolled, and leave the precise mechanism up to a performer (or<br/>recorder), who might vary it depending on mood and phase of the moon.  To be<br/>fair, if a MIDI file sticks to some precise regularized values for notes, it<br/>could be used by a performer as a score, i.e., as the basis for producing a<br/>variant interpretation -- in that case, it does become a &quot;score&quot;.  Typically,<br/>however, a MIDI file captures a performance and not an abstraction of a<br/>musical piece.</p><p>So what is a score?  It doesn&apos;t have to be dots on paper, it could be a set<br/>of numbers and rules for interpretation.  The traditional western musical<br/>score -- staves with notes in common musical notation -- is one method.<br/>Tablature is another method just as useful and valid.  A score could be a<br/>long list of Chinese characters that are to be interpreted by a performer; it<br/>could be a list of words or syllables with a conventional interpretation.<br/>What matters is that a score is something that allows a an arbitrarily large<br/>group of performers to produce an interpretation of an arbitrarily large<br/>piece of music at a separate time and place from that at which it was<br/>&quot;composed&quot;.  In the western &quot;high culture&quot; tradition, music is often thought<br/>of as existing in the abstract, embodied in a written form called a score,<br/>which is a set of instructions able to be interpreted by great or small<br/>performers, forever and ever down through the ages (theoretically).</p><p>MIDI files and scores might merge at the edges, but I think the preferred<br/>format might be different for particular purposes.  It is wonderful that we<br/>have recordings of Caruso -- we know precisely what he sounded like (modulo<br/>the horribly primitive recording technology).  It is also wonderful to have<br/>the scores for large symphonic and operatic works, for which a recording is<br/>an inadequate (or perhaps just &quot;highly inefficient&quot;) guide to production.</p><p>Another recent thread has to do with microtonal notation.  In my youth I<br/>struggled with trying to invent new notations and then gave up because...<br/>Classically trained western musicians aren&apos;t thrilled by trying to learn a<br/>new notation for every composer or every piece, they&apos;re highly trained to<br/>produce sounds by associating gestures (pushing keys, buttons, sliding bows,<br/>vocalizing) with certain symbols on the page.  They want to be able to refine<br/>a set of gestures into an &quot;art&quot; and then be able to &quot;read&quot; the score,<br/>producing sound and interpreting as they go.  The point of a score -- at<br/>least the scores I produce -- is to allow someone to reproduce the work in<br/>that manner.  Being trained to read/write western musical notation, I also<br/>don&apos;t want to learn a new notation for every tuning.  I want to be able to<br/>look at a &quot;b-flat&quot; on the page, push the b-flat key on my keyboard, and<br/>produce a sound of a specified duration.  Therefore, I use regular musical<br/>notation as if the music were 12tET and tune the instruments to whatever<br/>pitches I want.  The interval set can then be listed in a preface to the<br/>score, e.g., for an n-tone equal tuning, it might simply say &quot;written middle<br/>C = 262Hz, each notated half step represents an interval of X cents&quot;.  If<br/>acoustical instruments with the requisite tunings existed, the score could<br/>presumably be played by them; alternatively, the score can be played back<br/>through a synthesizer, turned into a MIDI file, adjusted in real-time, handed<br/>over to another performer, etc.  I&apos;ll grant that the score doesn&apos;t make much<br/>sense to someone trying to interpret it in 12tET, but it works for me...</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
