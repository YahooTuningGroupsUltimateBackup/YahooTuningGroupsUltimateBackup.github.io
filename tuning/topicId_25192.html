A tapered four-sided wood affair, in various<br/>tunings. As is well known, any equal spaced holes produce subharmonic action. I&apos;ve never heard of<br/>an end correction, but i know from making PVC Sulings with Bill Colvig, that he just<br/>&quot;scratched-up&quot; until he heard the right note. No big deal, and certainly no technology beyond an<br/>ale or two was needed to make several sulings in an afternoon. When played against the various<br/>Gamelan&apos;s they were made for, they were perfect. Lou Harrison&apos;s ears were there, and they<br/>approved. We then had a delicious Mexican family style lunch.</p><p>I digressed. French has shown me at various times several amazing wind instruments. One was a huge<br/>copper affair that he said was a viking copy. Looked like a demonic Suessian bag-pipe. It looked<br/>kinda scary, and the sound it made caused a fecal evacuation. Had i been approached by a band of<br/>Vikings with that horn, i would have killed myself.</p><p>He has investigated many ancient cultures, and made replicas and &quot;inspired&quot; instruments from these<br/>cultures.</p><p>Remember a few years back they found those Super-Ancient bone flutes in China? It didn&apos;t even faze<br/>or excite Jim, as he had speculated as such the existence of such instruments based on research<br/>and a craftsmens intuition.</p><p>Kraig Grady knows him better than I, and may chime in here with much greater detail. Jim and Kraig<br/>have recorded alot together, and most of it was really great Fuc%ing music. Jim is also a truly<br/>inspired improviser.</p><p>He also taught me how to make mead, and as such, weve spent alot of time &quot;slangin&quot; with a serious<br/>buzz going on. I never had one of Partch&apos;s impossibly strong Mint Julep&apos;s, so this was as close as<br/>i got to getting whacked with a Macro-tonal genius.</p><p>Incompletely, there&apos;s a sketch.</p><p>Beers,</p><p>GZ</p></div><h3><a id=25195 href="#25195">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2001 7:21:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>George,</p><p>Correct me if I&apos;m wrong: isn&apos;t Jim also a dramatically good at<br/>recitation in ancient Greek (nb: is &quot;ancient&quot; superfluous here?)?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=25235 href="#25235">ðŸ”—</a>George Zelenz &#x3C;ploo@mindspring.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2001 7:09:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon,</p><p>Superfluous it is not.
