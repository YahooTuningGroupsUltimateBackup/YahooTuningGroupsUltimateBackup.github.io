Exciting!  I have played<br/>&gt; Gubaidulina&apos;s music before as well as Isang Yun&apos;s, so the<br/>quartertones are a &quot;part of my scale now&quot; and I will welcome the use<br/>of them totally.</p><p>I think this is very encouraging news.  It means that many<br/>young performers today, who are not particularly &quot;microtonalists&quot; now<br/>consider 1/4 tones just a &quot;natural&quot; part of their given language!<br/>That&apos;s great!</p><p>It won&apos;t be long before it&apos;s even more!</p><p>________ ____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
