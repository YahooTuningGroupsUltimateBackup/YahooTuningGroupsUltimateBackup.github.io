Past sounds meet future technologies!  Your four files<br/>seem to play fine on my GM modules (Yamaha DS-XG soundcard and Roland<br/>VSC-88 soft-synth).  But I _do_ see the doubled notes, and don&apos;t doubt<br/>that they&apos;re causing the problems that Robert reports.  And he has a<br/>very commonly used card, so...</p><p>I&apos;ve e-mailed you (Margo) off-list a text interpretation of the files,<br/>showing the doubled notes.  Can Scala be modified to use different<br/>channels for them?  (hint, hint, Manuel...).</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>6/1/2001 6:41:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I&apos;ve e-mailed you (Margo) off-list a text interpretation of the files,<br/>&gt;showing the doubled notes.

I&apos;ve mailed Robert that he should see<br/>if using another midifile player solves the problem.<br/>Anyway, for this synthetic voice sound I see no purpose for these doubled<br/>notes, so I suggest that Margo removes them. If she wishes them to be<br/>played louder, then the velocity value can be increased.</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
