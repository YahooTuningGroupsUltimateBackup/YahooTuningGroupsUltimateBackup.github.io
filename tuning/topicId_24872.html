EVER.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; McLaren just has me questioning the wisdom of that... and it *was* a<br/>&gt; rather *drastic* thought, the more I think about it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ve gone through the same sort of thing recently. I committed myself<br/>towards &quot;thirds&quot; and felt that 31EDO would be the tuning for the rest<br/>of my life. Now that I&apos;ve rebuilt my tuning experiment ability, I&apos;ve<br/>decided that perfect fifths (and 3 prime offspring) are really cool,<br/>and I&apos;m getting interested in 17, 29, 41, and 53 as a result.</p><p>Which is okay, maybe one meantone and one schizmic(?) will be enough<br/>for a lifetime...</p><p>except that there really are (an infinite number?) of different<br/>approaches, too. I bought some &apos;random&apos; CDs last night, a few early<br/>music and a Thai collection. The Thai has some jangly pentatonics that<br/>don&apos;t seem to match any of these approaches.</p><p>Lest I contribute to a tone that is perceived of this list being<br/>anti-JI/RI, I just happen to like intervallic regularity and<br/>transposablity at this point of my development. ED&apos;s give it to<br/>me and ED2 is where I am now. It may well be that by the time I get to<br/>a 14-o-o-131ED(22/3), that I&apos;ll be playing with a random collection of<br/>just intervals, but thats a few years out.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2001 12:01:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: Robert C Valentine &lt;<a href="mailto:BVAL@IIL.INTEL.COM">BVAL@IIL.INTEL.COM</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Sunday, June 10, 2001 10:57 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [tuning] Digest Number 1404<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...
