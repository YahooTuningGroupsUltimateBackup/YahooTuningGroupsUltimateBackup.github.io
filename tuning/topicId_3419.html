I&apos;ll also contact Graham (later this<br/>week, things gettin&apos; busy) and see if maybe we could combine it in one<br/>location...</p><p>&gt;I just meant some of the people on this list who hold Partch&apos;s music,<br/>&gt;philosophy, and/or persona to have an almost religious sanctity.</p><p>That must include me.</p><p>&gt;Although it&apos;s great to have people spreading the gospel, it bugs me<br/>&gt;when their efforts actually make it less likely that the average<br/>&gt;person will get to hear Partch&apos;s music.</p><p>Couldn&apos;t possibly include me: I&apos;ve got a website with all the current<br/>concert information (including the AFMM concerts), was responsible for the<br/>CRI remasters of Partch&apos;s Gate 5 recordings, now available to the public<br/>(average people included), have contributed to the Enclosures project.</p><p>OTOH, if you mean not liking transcriptions for bogus performance scenarios<br/>-- well, yes, that would include me.</p><p>&gt;But I don&apos;t want to get into that debate again.</p><p>It &quot;bugs&quot; you, but a caveat is appended. Classic trolling, and I bit. What<br/>an idiot I can be...</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m glad you approve of the Gilmore book, since it would be<br/>&gt;unfortunate if the (virtually) only available book on Partch, and<br/>&gt;such a well-written one, misrepresented important aspects of his life<br/>&gt;or music.</p><p>&apos;Approve&apos; may be the wrong word, since it&apos;s not up to me to judge. By all<br/>my accounts, and from what all I&apos;ve read previously, Gilmore is accurate<br/>and fair. The events he writes of during the last 3+ years of Partch&apos;s life<br/>seem as I remember them. Considering the difficulty of finding information<br/>on someone whose life was so much in transit, I&apos;ll wager that the factual<br/>errors are small and not of impact on the book as a whole. Valuable tome.</p><p>&gt;One does not have to be perfect in order to recognize, and point out,<br/>&gt;an error in someone else&apos;s work. That&apos;s all I was doing, and it&apos;s<br/>&gt;part of this very healthy thing called &quot;the open exchange of ideas&quot;.<br/>&gt;No one is presumed to be perfect [snip]</p><p>Wait, Paul. You said before: &quot;That&apos;s fine, but it doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s then OK<br/>for him to make erroneous statements on theoretical matters. Instead, he<br/>should make none at all.&quot; Tell me that doesn&apos;t sound like you presume him<br/>to be either perfect or silent.</p><p>&gt;To react so strongly against criticism is an example of the type of<br/>&gt;quasi-religious fanaticism I was referring to, except that in this<br/>&gt;case you&apos;ve extended it beyond Partch and onto Gilmore as well.</p><p>What I was reacting to was not about subject matter but your heavy-handed<br/>statement about errors by authors. I found it neither enlightening (i.e.<br/>describing the errors) or realistic. I expect better from learned<br/>correspondents such as yourself.</p><p>There are people that I debate, in other arenas beyond and besides music; I<br/>try to read posts in the same manner, looking for fairness and clarity.<br/>Your posts can be called into question, just as mine.</p><p>Finally, about the repeated use of &apos;religious&apos; as a negative descriptor:<br/>I&apos;ll just read that as &apos;passionate&apos;. I do, and always will, feel<br/>passionately about the work of Partch. You will simply have to deal with<br/>it, just as I&apos;ve learned to be comfortable with endless streams of numbers.</p><p>&gt;Perhaps you or John could fill me in on what exactly you&apos;re referring<br/>&gt;to (if it&apos;s still relevant)?</p><p>My point was that you implied the error in the biography was something that<br/>should have easily been detected or corrected, while John Chalmers mentions<br/>the same area in a post to you as: &quot;Has anyone succeeded in reproducing<br/>Helmholtz&apos;s computations? I&apos;ve always found his description of how he<br/>computed the dissonance curves opaque.&quot; Maybe we&apos;re talking about two<br/>different subjects, but that was when you hauled Gilmore on the carpet,<br/>whom you include in the religious-toned &quot;criminally unnoticed by all the<br/>prime enthusiasts&quot;. I seriously doubt Bob Gilmore has an intonational ax(e)<br/>to grind.</p><p>John C. said the point was &quot;opaque&quot;; you said the &quot;derivation&quot; was<br/>&quot;...clear&quot;. Your implication, with regard to Gilmore, was that it should be<br/>&quot;clear&quot; to everyone. That was all I was referring to.</p><p>&gt;And again, I&apos;m very happy to hear this, as I enjoyed the book<br/>&gt;thoroughly. Unfortunately, some Partchophiles around here don&apos;t share<br/>&gt;this view.</p><p>Their loss.</p><p>&lt;/debate type=&quot;passionate&quot;&gt;<br/>..... . . . . . . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . .....<br/>Jonathan M.
