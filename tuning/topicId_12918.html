Note that<br/>the sensory dissonance concept of Sethares is timbre-sensitive, but<br/>that the &quot;Golden Mediant&quot; may serve as a useful approximation over a<br/>wide range of harmonic timbres.</p><p>A week ago, after seeing Keenan Pepper&apos;s post on &quot;The Other Noble<br/>Fifth&quot; (which deserves much laudatory comment in itself), Dave Keenan<br/>promptly realized that the Phi function there applied to finding a<br/>super-Pythagorean counterpart of Thorwald Kornerup&apos;s famous &quot;Golden<br/>Meantone&quot; tuning could also be applied to find regions of maximum<br/>complexity or entropy.</p><p>The applications of the &quot;two Keenans&quot; both use Phi, often known as the<br/>Golden Ratio, equal to approximately 1.61803398874989484820459.</p><p>As described in our joint article, Dave Keenan&apos;s &quot;Golden Mediant&quot;<br/>function to find the region of maximum complexity between the simpler<br/>interval ratios i:j and m:n, where i:j is simpler than m:n, is as<br/>follows:</p><p>                                (i + m * Phi)<br/>               GoldenMediant =  -------------<br/>                                (j + n * Phi)</p><p>As we found, this Golden Mediant often although not always gives<br/>results very close to the &quot;maximum entropy&quot; regions which Paul Erlich<br/>has calculated using computerized techniques based on a statistical<br/>model.</p><p>Sometimes the results may be close to Paul&apos;s &quot;limited-weighted<br/>midpoint&quot; function recently posted here, as in the following example<br/>borrowed from Paul&apos;s article illustrating both approaches.</p><p>Let us suppose we wish to find the point of &quot;maximum entropy&quot; or<br/>&quot;complexity&quot; between a pure 4:3 fourth and a septimal 7:5 diminished<br/>fifth. Using the Golden Mediant, and taking 4:3 as the simpler ratio,<br/>we have:</p><p>                     4 + 7 Phi<br/>                     --------- = ~560.067 cents<br/>                     3 + 5 Phi</p><p>With Paul&apos;s &quot;limit-weighted function,&quot; taking the size of the two<br/>simpler ratios in cents (4:3 = ~498.045 cents, 7:5 = ~582.512 cents),<br/>we have:</p><p>              3 (498.045) + 7 (582.512)<br/>              ------------------------- = ~557.172 cents<br/>                         10</p><p>Here we multiply the size of each ratio in cents by the interval&apos;s<br/>odd-limit (3 for 4:3, 7 for 7:5), take the sum of the two products,<br/>and divide by the sum of the two odd-limits.</p><p>As it happens, the results for the 4:3-7:5 pair using the Golden<br/>Mediant and the Erlich &quot;odd-limit weighting&quot; are within 3 cents of<br/>each other.</p><p>In contrast, one of Paul&apos;s list of &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; maxima and<br/>minima suggests a local maximum near 537 cents -- possibly a different<br/>asnwer to a different question, since this result might be affected<br/>not only by the &quot;mediant&quot; or &quot;midpoint&quot; between 4:3 and 7:5, but also<br/>by the shallower &quot;valley&quot; or weaker &quot;attractant&quot; at 11:8 (~551.318<br/>cents). This 11:8, by the way, is the classic mediant between the two<br/>simpler ratios: (4+7):(3+5).</p><p>If we recast the problem to be solved with the Golden Mediant or the<br/>limit-weighted function as finding the point of maximum complexity<br/>between 4:3 and 11:8, then for the Golden Mediant we have:</p><p>                    4 + 11 Phi<br/>                   ----------- = ~541.419 cents<br/>                    3 +  8 Phi</p><p>and for the limit-weighted function we have:</p><p>           3 (498.045) + 11 (551.318)<br/>           -------------------------- = ~539.902 cents<br/>                      14</p><p>These two results are quite close to each other, and either is not far<br/>from Erlich&apos;s entropy maximum of 537 cents found with his computerized<br/>statistical model based on probablility distributions.</p><p>In celebrating both Dave Keenan&apos;s new Phi-based function for maximum<br/>entropy/sensory dissonance/complexity, and Keenan Pepper&apos;s catalytic<br/>article on a different application of the same kind of mathematical<br/>procedure, I would to share a humorous incident which may illustrate<br/>the limited scope of my mathematical initiation.</p><p>Upon first learning of Dave&apos;s new algorithm, I wanted to try it on<br/>some ratios. Choosing the pair 5:4-9:7, I excitedly attempted to<br/>calculate:</p><p>                           5 + 9 * Phi<br/>                           -----------<br/>                           4 + 7 * Phi</p><p>Upon coming up with the familiar classic mediant at ~417.508 cents, or<br/>14:11 (a favorite neo-Gothic integer ratio), I realized the problem: I<br/>had followed an order of operations from left to right, rather than<br/>recognizing the priority of multiplication over addition. Trying<br/>again, I got the correct answer of ~422.487 cents, virtually identical<br/>to Paul Erlich&apos;s entropy maximum at 423 cents.</p><p>As one who preferentially programs in the PostScript language and<br/>likewise favors the GNU Emacs Calc program, both of which use Reverse<br/>Polish Notation (RPN), I had not fully internalized the basic<br/>conventions of priority regarding operations, something elementary for<br/>an actual mathematician such as Dave.</p><p>More importantly, Dave&apos;s creative mathematical acumen and experience<br/>together with his musical sensitivity led to the elegance of the<br/>Golden Mediant of complexity, this concept growing also out of a<br/>treasured contribution to the lore of neo-Gothic tunings by another<br/>mathematical thinker and lover of music, Keenan Pepper.</p><p>There is much more to say, but I would like to express my deep<br/>indebtedness to Dave Keenan and Keenan Pepper, &quot;the two Keenans,&quot; for<br/>having an opportunity to participate in these developments.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=12952 href="#12952">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2000 8:21:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.

It isn&apos;t _my_ Golden Mediant. The purely mathematical result is Keenan<br/>Pepper&apos;s.
