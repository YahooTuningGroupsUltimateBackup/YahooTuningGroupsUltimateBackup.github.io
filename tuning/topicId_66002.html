So the two concepts are different.</p><p>A lot of times I&apos;m considering JI chords as a guide to tempered chords<br/>anyway. For instance, consider the 1-11/9-3/2-11/6 chord tbis thread<br/>started from. It has an evil 27-limit interval, 27/22, between 11/9<br/>and 3/2. However, if 243/242 is tempered out this is the same as 11/9<br/>anyway, and we have an 11/9-11/9-11/9-12/11 chord, an 11-limit &quot;magic&quot;<br/>chord. I suppose going systematically through the chords of whatever<br/>temperament you are considering makes the most sense, but there is<br/>never any shortage of microtemperament chords, and you could spend a<br/>lot of time just listening to examples.</p><p>Other examples like this are 1-7/6-10/7-5/3, where the 60/49 from 7/6<br/>to 10/7 is a (smaller) neutral third and can be assimilated down to<br/>11/9, which tempers out 540/539, and 1-7/6-7/5-5/3, where the 25/21 is<br/>302 cents, and so is a minor third of some kind. Equating it to 6/5<br/>tempers out 126/125.</p></div><h3>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>4/11/2006 7:35:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi all,</p><p>On Tue, 11 Apr 2006, Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; If &quot;ass&quot; makes sense, then people should be talking about saturated<br/>&gt; suspensions, and they don&apos;t seem to.
