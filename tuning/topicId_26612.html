The only<br/>three types of software that I have found that are slightly<br/>reasonable are the Midicode Synthesizer, Justonic music software, and<br/>the Phi music generator.  I am very serious about this, and I would<br/>appreciate some serious answers to my search.  Here is specifically<br/>what I am looking for in tuning software:</p><p>1)  Full keyboard scales with a large or infinite amount of available<br/>notes within an octave.  This would allow for large scales of any<br/>number of constituent notes.  Pre programmed scales would be nice,<br/>but what I am primarily interested in is user programmable custom<br/>scales of any length.  These scales should be storable through memory.</p><p>2)  I am looking for a tuning of individual notes with any degree<br/>variation in hertz or in ratios from the tonic (in hertz).  These<br/>ratios should be able to be expressed in decimal numerators and<br/>denominators.  It should allow for very specific tunings in this area<br/>with a sufficient amount of placeholders after the decimal point.<br/>The cents option would be nice as well, but it is not as good, so it<br/>is only optional.</p><p>3)  I need software which allows the key change ability in real<br/>time.  The software must be able to recognize/analyze harmonic<br/>structure and be able to change the reference tone in real time.  I<br/>do not want to have to use foot pedals or mouse clicking to change<br/>the reference or have to preprogram it with a sequencer.  These<br/>inconveniences are completely ridiculous.  Justonic software is the<br/>best approximate which has this ability.  The problem is that<br/>Justonic only has a 12 note scale limit.  This is stupid.  I need<br/>full keyboard scales or scales which have a large amount of notes<br/>involved.</p><p>  These three critera are critical, and I need software which is<br/>fully capable of executing these essential utilities.  I cannot see<br/>why software such as this would not exist.  If you are reading this<br/>message and know of software that does this, please contact me at<br/><a href="mailto:PageWizard17@aol.com">PageWizard17@aol.com</a> and inform me of this.  I would greatly<br/>appreciate this.  If you are capable or know of people who are<br/>capable of programming such software with the prescribed abilities I<br/>have listed, please inform me if you are capable of doing so.  I<br/>would be very interested in being involved in the development of such<br/>a process.  This is very important.  It is more important than<br/>anything else musically that I have ever seen before.  Anyone who<br/>sees this as trivial has no place in it.  I am only looking for<br/>serious responses only.
