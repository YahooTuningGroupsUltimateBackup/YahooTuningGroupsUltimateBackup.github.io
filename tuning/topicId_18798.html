Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2001 6:56:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and in response to the discussion on Gesualdo, I might<br/>offer a few general points.</p><p>First, I&apos;m strongly inclined to agree with Paul Erlich that something<br/>like 1/4-comma meantone may be the best guess for a fixed tuning<br/>system that might fit Gesualdo&apos;s intonational concepts, albeit with<br/>the caution that singers or performers of flexible-pitch instruments<br/>both can and will inevitably deviate somewhat from any fixed tuning.<br/>Thanks to Bill Alves also, for example, for duly emphasizing this<br/>point.</p><p>Surveying 16th-century theorists, we find that they differ on the<br/>issue of what intonation unaccompanied vocalists &quot;naturally&quot; tend<br/>toward. Zarlino takes 5-limit just intonation (JI), as realized by<br/>Ptolemy&apos;s syntonic diatonic, as the best theoretical model -- but with<br/>some interesting comments that singers, unlike 5-limit JI keyboards,<br/>seem to avoid &quot;small intervals&quot; such as the syntonic comma which<br/>complicate life for players of such untempered keyboards.</p><p>This might suggest some kind of Vicentino/Erlich &quot;adaptive JI&quot; model<br/>for 16th-century singers. In such a system, as in either the syntonic<br/>diatonic or 1/4-comma meantone, the diesis defined by the difference<br/>between three 5:4 major thirds and a 2:1 octave would be 128:125, or<br/>about 41.06 cents.</p><p>While Fogliano and Zarlino take 5-limit JI as the vocal ideal, with<br/>various forms of temperament much more practical for fixed keyboards<br/>although JI arrangements are possible, Vicentino seems to accept<br/>temperament as a pervasive quality of &quot;modern&quot; music, vocal or<br/>instrumental. He thus identifies the common practice of the times<br/>(1555) as &quot;tempered and mixed music&quot; or _musica participata e mista_,<br/>referring both to the tempering or &quot;blunting&quot; of the fifth, and to<br/>what he views as a mixture of the three Greek genera in usual as well<br/>as experimental Renaissance music.</p><p>More specifically, Vicentino urges that his archicembalo be taken as a<br/>standard by vocalists for judging intervals, including the more<br/>difficult or unaccustomed diminished and augmented ones. Since the<br/>context suggests he may be referring to his 31-note meantone cycle<br/>rather than to his adaptive JI scheme, this suggests a viewpoint that<br/>singers might well adapt a regular tuning as their standard.</p><p>In 1581, Vincenzo Galilei proposes that singers tend of themselves<br/>toward an intonation somewhere between the 12-tone equal temperament<br/>(12-tET) standard on the lute, and the 2/7-comma meantone temperament<br/>which he prefers on the harpsichord (curiously following Zarlino, his<br/>former teacher who became a rival in some empassioned<br/>controversies). He holds that singers tend to make whole-tones the<br/>same size, in contrast to the unequal 9:8 and 10:9 steps of classic<br/>5-limit JI.</p><p>Given the intense rivalry between Zarlino and Galilei, it&apos;s<br/>interesting that some kind of adaptive JI based more or less on<br/>something like 1/4-comma meantone might fit some of the descriptions<br/>of both theorists.</p><p>From this historical perspective, while it may be something of a moot<br/>point exactly what ideal intonational model Gesualdo may have<br/>followed, something like a 31-note meantone cycle (1/4-comma) with<br/>room for adaptive JI adjustments by singers or other performers of<br/>nonfixed-pitch instruments seems an attractive conjecture.</p><p>Let&apos;s clarify an important point: in 1/4-comma meantone or 31-tET,<br/>there are two levels of fine inflection, which Vicentino describes as<br/>the chromatic and enharmonic. Either system -- and a vocal adaptive<br/>tuning based more or closely on either -- can be described for many<br/>purposes in terms of units of 1/5-tone, or &quot;fifthtones,&quot; each roughly<br/>comparable to the meantone diesis of 128:125.</p><p>Chromatic progressions feature alterating steps of ~3/5-tone (the<br/>diatonic semitone, ~117.11 cents in 1/4-comma) and ~2/5-tone (the<br/>chromatic semitone, ~76.05 cents in 1/4-comma), the two steps adding<br/>up to the &quot;mean-tone&quot; of ~193.16 cents, or half of a 5:4 third:</p><p>  76     117<br/>G -- G#  --  A<br/>|------------|<br/>      193</p><p>In the music of Vicentino -- but not Gesualdo, to my best and possibly<br/>incomplete knowledge -- we additionally find &quot;enharmonic&quot; or direct<br/>fifthtone progressions featuring the diesis of around 1/5-tone. In a<br/>1/4-comma tuning, these dieses are slightly unequal, and which ones<br/>are larger or smaller depends on the order of the tuning cycle. For<br/>example, here&apos;s one possible fifthtone division of the same whole-tone<br/>G-A, using a Vicentino-like notation with an asterisk (*) to represent<br/>his dot above a note showing a pitch raised by a diesis:</p><p>  41    35    41    41     35<br/>G -- G* -- G# -- Ab -- Ab* -- A</p><p>While we could get into some interesting discussions about the tuning<br/>of such &quot;sliding of the voice&quot; in fifthtones -- an ornament advocated<br/>by Fabio Colonna in 1618 -- this seems to me a bit beyond the scope of<br/>Gesualdo&apos;s music known to me, featuring direct chromaticism but not<br/>enharmonic fifthtone passages.</p><p>For chromatic progressions, something like 1/4-comma meantone might<br/>seem a bit &quot;smoother&quot; to me than 1/3-comma meantone or 19-tET; 5-limit<br/>JI has the same diesis or difference between semitones as 1/4-comma,<br/>if we take the whole-step G-A as a small whole-step at 10:9 (as in<br/>Zarlino&apos;s scheme):</p><p>                                     25:24  16:15<br/>  76     117        63     126       70.7   111.7<br/>G -- G#  --  A    G -- G#  --  A    G -- G# ---- A<br/>|------------|    |------------|    |------------|<br/>     193               193               182.4<br/>                                         10:9</p><p>  1/4-comma          1/3-comma           5-JI</p><p>At least in a Renaissance/Manneristic kind of setting, I would say<br/>that the difference between the 1/4-comma or 31-tET diesis and the<br/>small semitone of 1/3-comma or 19-tET is one of kind rather than<br/>degree.</p><p>While the smaller semitone of either system can serve as a variety of<br/>cadential semitone -- and Vicentino uses this effect in some of his<br/>altered cadences, in a manner advocated some 400 years later by Ivor<br/>Darreg, by the way -- the fifthtone or diesis is of a different<br/>order. It is &quot;microtonal&quot; in the modern sense of &quot;too small to be<br/>perceived as a usual scale step.&quot;</p><p>Indeed, Galilei, although often a radical theorist out to overthrow<br/>the conventional techniques and rules of counterpoint a la Zarlino,<br/>concludes that Vicentino&apos;s fifthtones are too small to suit the human<br/>ear -- a complaint maybe echoed in some anti-microtonal doctrines of<br/>the 20th century.</p><p>(In the very different intonational universe of neo-Gothic music, I<br/>find that I routinely accept intervals on the order of 50-55 cents as<br/>small semitones, either regular diatonic semitones as in 22-tET<br/>(~54.55 cents), or special cadential ones as in a variety of tunings<br/>with dieses of this order of size. To what degree the perception of an<br/>interval as a discrete semitone step or &quot;smaller than semitonal&quot;<br/>depends on its absolute size, and to what degree on the musical and<br/>intonational context, is an intriguing question.)</p><p>As the 31-tone notations of Vicentino and Colonna illustrate, special<br/>symbols would generally be required to indicate fifthtone<br/>progressions, although the 20-note gamut of Gesualdo&apos;s madrigals<br/>(Cb-B#) does include some possible diesis motions between accidentals<br/>(e.g. Ab-G#, B#-C). I&apos;m not sure if Gesualdo uses such _direct_<br/>melodic motions.</p><p>However, a standard notation suffices to show the chromatic divisions<br/>of either the 1/4-comma system (roughly 2/5-3/5 tone) or the 1/3-comma<br/>or 19-tET system (1/3-2/3 tone) -- for example, G-G#-A.</p><p>While Gesualdo, to my best knowledge, doesn&apos;t use _direct_ fifthtone<br/>progressions a la Vicentino and Colonna, there are passages in his<br/>vocal music suggesting contrasts between notes or pitch levels a<br/>fifthtone apart -- for example, a juxtaposition within a few measures<br/>of B# and C, or vice versa.</p><p>In certain 20th-century writings, one encounters the assumption that<br/>any move beyond a standard 12-note meantone gamut must imply some kind<br/>of &quot;equal temperament&quot; -- implicitly meaning &quot;12-tET,&quot; as opposed to<br/>what I consider the likelier approximation of 31-tET.</p><p>While ascribing intonational ideals by association, like guilt by<br/>association, can be a very risky practice, I might add that as<br/>discussed in recent posts, Gesualdo&apos;s Neapolitan milieu of around 1600<br/>showed enthusiasm for chromatic harpsichords of 19 notes (Gb-B#) in<br/>1/4-comma meantone or the like, with some full 31-note keyboards also<br/>(Stella, Colonna).</p><p>To say that a Neapolitan keyboard composer such as Trabaci is<br/>evidently assuming 1/4-comma or something close is not necessarily to<br/>say how Gesualdo&apos;s ensembles, very possibly combining human voices and<br/>other flexible-pitch instruments with &quot;semi-flexible&quot; and fixed ones<br/>(viols being a likely example of &quot;semi-flexibility&quot;), may have<br/>negotiated his chromatic passages.</p><p>However, I do find it reasonable to conclude that the diesis, but not<br/>the syntonic comma, seems a basic part of the intonational model as<br/>applied to voices or most instruments -- the 12-tET lute serving as a<br/>notable exception, where Eb and D# would be equivalent -- their<br/>distinction &quot;neutralized,&quot; to borrow a grammatical analogy.</p><p>In my view, in the Italian setting of around 1600, such an exception<br/>may prove rather than negate the rule of diesis distinctions. It is<br/>noteworthy that Vicenzo Galilei, despite his enthusiasm for 12-tET as<br/>the most &quot;perfect&quot; tuning, finds it less than satisfactory on a<br/>harpsichord as opposed to a lute, because of the more &quot;vehement&quot; sound<br/>production on the former instrument (one is tempted to translate,<br/>&quot;because of the more prominent fifth partials&quot;).</p><p>The &quot;neutralization&quot; of the usual diesis on a 12-tET lute might be<br/>analogous to the grammatical neutralization of tense in the first or<br/>second person, or third person plural, of the English verb &quot;set&quot;:</p><p>(1) I set the table at 5.<br/>(2) You set out for the concert shortly after sunset.<br/>(3) The stars of that constellation set shortly before dawn.</p><p>These sentences might express either the Simple Past tense (&quot;I set the<br/>table at 5 [yesterday],&quot; a prospective Simple Present (&quot;I set the<br/>table at 5 this evening,&quot; spoken in the afternoon), or a kind of<br/>generic or habitual Simple Present (&quot;I set the table at 5 every day&quot;).<br/>However, it would be impetuous, to say the least, for us to conclude<br/>that English does not have morphological tense.</p><p>Having proposed a tentative conclusion that Gesualdo&apos;s music may<br/>generally suggest 1/4-comma meantone, or some &quot;adaptive JI&quot; tuning for<br/>flexible ensembles not too far from this, I would add that there is<br/>certainly some room for variation.</p><p>For example, Mark Lindley has suggested that some Venetian keyboard<br/>music (e.g. Andrea Gabrieli) in modes featuring a prevalent arithmetic<br/>division of the fifth (e.g. the minor third below and major third<br/>above, in Partchian terms &quot;5-limit utonal sonorities&quot;) may ideally<br/>favor Zarlino&apos;s (and Galilei&apos;s) 2/7-comma temperament. I&apos;m not sure<br/>what the effect would be for Gesualdo&apos;s music, but recall that Zarlino<br/>may have described a 19-note keyboard based on 2/7-comma which could<br/>cover the typical chromatic range of Gesualdo.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>2/18/2001 8:42:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

I do not think this is unique, but our musical ear and practice<br/>far surpasses our rational explanation of what we are doing.

What we can say with some<br/>confidence is that neither 12-tET nor strict JI renditions would be<br/>acceptable for this music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If this is the case, just as 12 et will stand for more than one set<br/>of<br/>&gt; ratios it seems Gesualdo&apos;s Music would need more that one<br/>form of<br/>&gt; intonation depending on the emotional quality of micro parts of<br/>the<br/>&gt; phrase.</p><p>That&apos;s ironic -- you&apos;re saying 12-tET can stand for a lot of things<br/>but meantone can&apos;t? I mean, I agree with you in principle, but you<br/>could have picked a better example than 12-tET! Certainly, 20<br/>notes of meantone or 30-some notes of Vicentino adaptive JI<br/>can stand for a far greater (since they&apos;re unequal systems) range<br/>of ratios than 12-tET. But yes, small vocal intonational inflections<br/>for emotional purposes may have been part of the style, for all<br/>we know.</p><p>&gt; I believe the concept of adaptive JI and extended reference<br/>&gt; are two candles in this dark room. I think it would be a mistake<br/>to<br/>&gt; think these are the only possibilities and expect theirs to come<br/>up with<br/>&gt; more including yourselves.</p><p>&quot;Theirs to come up with more including yourselves&quot; -- what does<br/>that mean?</p><p>&gt; I can imagine certain parts of his music in<br/>&gt; Pythagorean , others in Just without any trouble.</p><p>Well it&apos;s quite another thing for us denizens of the 21st century, in<br/>our little corner of tuning experimentation, to imaginatively try<br/>things out in one tuning or another. However, even today, the vast<br/>majority of trained singers are singing essentially in 12-tET,<br/>accepting even its harsh major thirds (ignoring for now the tiny<br/>distinction between 400 cents and Gerald Eskelin&apos;s still wider<br/>&quot;high third&quot;) as &quot;normal&quot;.

Nevertheless, a tuning model which<br/>ignores any of these goals will, in my opinion, deviate more severely and<br/>noticeably from the efforts of a fine vocal ensemble than one that<br/>incorporates all of them. So, if one were to, say, try to create a<br/>synthesized version of a choral rendition of a Renaissance or early Baroque<br/>piece, one could start with Vicentino&apos;s tuning, add small random errors,<br/>throw in some slides and swoops, maybe a tiny bit of vibrato . . . and, if<br/>one assumes that technology has progressed to the point where it can mimic<br/>human singing realistically (perhaps someday it will), one should have a<br/>realistic rendition . . .</p><p>Uh oh, I think I&apos;ve just gotten myself in a lot of trouble by trying to get<br/>out of it . . . well that&apos;s it for now . . .</p></div><h3>M.

Thus it could be played either on a 19-note (or larger)<br/>chromatic harpsichord of Neapolitan vogue, or on a somewhat smaller<br/>instrument with the appropriate split keys.</p><p>Watkins, as I&apos;ll discuss in the second part of my longer article,<br/>suggests that the chromatic passages suggest an encounter with some<br/>kind of archicembalo or the like -- there are ornaments producing<br/>vertical diminished fourths and the like.</p><p>(Incidentally, Lasso&apos;s _Prophetiae Sibyllarum_ also has at least one<br/>piece with a range of Eb-A#; this isn&apos;t to suggest that keyboards<br/>participated in vocal performances of these pieces, nor to tie singers<br/>to any fixed-pitch intonation, only to note an instance of this kind<br/>of range.)</p><p>The Gagliarda, pretty much a typical texture of mostly note-against-<br/>note with an engaging and stately quality, is Bb-A#, a 13-note range,<br/>with a neat diagonal relationship at one point of D# in the highest<br/>voice followed in the next sonority by Bb in the bass (with parallel<br/>tenths between these parts descending a chromatic semitone, B3-D#4 to<br/>Bb3-D4).</p><p>Again, if we assume a keyboard performance, or maybe an ensemble with<br/>a keyboard as a &quot;foundation&quot; instrument (one manuscript has a &quot;basso<br/>continuo&quot; identical to the lowest sounding voice of Gesualdo&apos;s piece),<br/>either a 19-note or larger keyboard, or a smaller instrument with a<br/>split Bb/A# key, would cover the range.</p><p>Of course, thanks for the fascinating item from the _New Grove_, which<br/>confirms my own impression -- more in the coming post.</p><p>To Ibo Ortgies:</p><p>Thank you for bringing to this thread both your general erudition and<br/>your special knowledge of keyboards with split keys or &quot;subsemitones.&quot;<br/>It&apos;s very pleasing how this discussion of Gesualdo is bringing out<br/>more information on this general topic, including your most extensive<br/>contributions here and on the World Wide Web.</p><p>To Johnny Reinhard:</p><p>First, thank you for advocating a position which I know is based on a<br/>kind of performing experience which I cannot claim, not to mention a<br/>far greater range of exposure to musics and intonations.</p><p>My own viewpoint would be that meantone -- or an adaptive intonation<br/>for voices or other non-fixed-pitch instruments based more or less on<br/>meantone steps adjusted to permit pure vertical concords -- is not so<br/>much a &quot;compromise&quot; as an opportunity, for Vicentino or Gesualdo.</p><p>While there are many things I associate with Vicentino, &quot;compromise&quot;<br/>isn&apos;t one of them, and the same goes for Gesualdo. The question<br/>remains how their incredible musical statements can best be realized<br/>in performance, and there we have lots of room for alternative<br/>perspectives.</p><p>On some issues of theory and analysis, I&apos;ll address both your remarks<br/>and those of Graham Breed.</p><p>To Johnny Reinhard and Graham Breed (and also again Paul Erlich):</p><p>There are various approaches not only to performing this music, but to<br/>analyzing it. I find it natural that different people will apply their<br/>own accustomed methods, ranging from 14th-century cadential theory to<br/>16th-century concepts to 18th-19th century Roman numeral analysis to<br/>Edward Lowinsky&apos;s &quot;triadic atonality&quot; (should we make that<br/>&quot;panmodality&quot;?).</p><p>From a 16th-century viewpoint, I would say that the preference for a<br/>major rather than minor third above the bass at significant points of<br/>cadential repose -- or a harmonic rather than arithmetic division of<br/>the fifth, with the major third below and minor third above (to use<br/>Zarlino&apos;s terms, my own approach) -- is a general technique of the<br/>era. Aaron documents it by remarks and examples in his _Toscanello_<br/>and a treatise on the modes, and Vicentino and Zarlino make similar<br/>points in the 1550&apos;s. Maybe the 18th century or later would call it a<br/>_tierce de Picardie_ or &quot;Picardy third&quot; or the like, but in the 16th<br/>century, starting around the epoch of Aaron, I&apos;d call it mainly<br/>&quot;common practice.&quot;</p><p>Aside: one might wonder if a leaning in the late 15th and very early<br/>16th century toward an Ab-C# meantone tuning (Ramos 1482 if we take<br/>his keyboard tuning as in meantone, Schlick 1511) might reflect a<br/>willingness to get along in E Phyrgian without a major third available<br/>above the final. If we conclude in the traditional fashion on a fifth<br/>and octave or the like, or accept a closing minor third (as might have<br/>been the practice around 1500), then there&apos;s not necessarily a<br/>problem. Once we lean toward the harmonic division as more conclusive,<br/>as Aaron does in the 1520&apos;s, G# becomes a routine step (as in the<br/>different context of later medieval practice), thus Eb-G# as the<br/>standard range.</p><p>For 16th-century and early 17th-century music -- the &quot;modern&quot; side of<br/>my usual era of orientation -- I would follow the theorists and, I<br/>suspect, the composers, in looking at melody, two-voice progressions,<br/>overall sonorities, and combined progressions.</p><p>My own training and inclination is to look at sonorities as<br/>combinations of intervals, some of which Zarlino, for example,<br/>compares in their different arrangements. The idea of &quot;roots,&quot; as<br/>opposed to intervals above the bass or between other parts, seems to<br/>me mostly a later approach, although I recognize that Johannes Lippius<br/>(1610, 1612) does describe a kind of inversion theory, with his<br/>_basis_ comparable to the later &quot;root&quot; concept.</p><p>Just as some people&apos;s outlook on this music may be colored by<br/>18th-century theory, mine may often be colored by 14th-century theory,<br/>although the 16th century has its own character and logic despite our<br/>sundry other associations, and I know that Gesualdo can&apos;t be reduced<br/>to even the most inspired written theory any more than Wagner or<br/>Schoenberg can -- or the earlier Perotin or Machaut or Landini, for<br/>example.</p><p>For example, if I see a sonority of G3-B3-E4-B4, I might say (out of<br/>context): &quot;There&apos;s a major third and sixth above the bass which might<br/>expand to the fifth and octave, while the major tenth between the<br/>outer voices might move in parallel to arrive at F3-C4-F4-A4, another<br/>complete harmonic division.&quot;</p><p>Here we have the traditional 14th-century element of M3-5 and M6-8,<br/>still standard Renaissance progressions from &quot;an imperfect concord to<br/>the nearest perfect concord&quot; (e.g. Ramos, Zarlino), plus the<br/>16th-century element of 4:5:6 or 10:12:15 rather than 2:3:4 as the<br/>complete stable sonority, so that the highest voice often moves to A4,<br/>rather than to C5 in what is to me a &quot;classic&quot; 14th-century fashion.</p><p>Note that since Machaut&apos;s music was not evidently part of the<br/>16th-century theoretical landscape, my medievalist associations could<br/>be considered just as &quot;anachronistic&quot; as someone else&apos;s Rameauesque or<br/>Wagnerian or Schoenbergian associations with this music.</p><p>While the medieval and Renaissance-Manneristic periods are in many<br/>ways radically contrasting -- intonationally, to choose a most<br/>relevant parameter -- they share what I might term a &quot;combinative&quot; or<br/>&quot;polydyadic&quot; approach to verticality which for me is &quot;natural,&quot;<br/>although to others it may be a less familiar outlook.</p><p>The idea of vertical sonorities progressing with the guidance of<br/>two-voice resolutions, as some scholars of figured bass technique have<br/>pointed out, is characteristic not only of medieval and Renaissance<br/>technique, or of Manneristic technique in Gesualdo&apos;s age whether in<br/>traditional polyphonic forms or in the new continuo-based genres, but<br/>even in the German thoroughbass technique of around 1700 which served<br/>as one grounding for Bach&apos;s music. By the end of the 17th century, of<br/>course, major/minor tonality has become the increasingly prevailing<br/>system, but some elements of the earlier 16th-17th century modal and<br/>combinative approaches continue to exert a certain influence on<br/>composers such as Bach, even as Rameau formulates a different<br/>&quot;chordal&quot; point of view prevailing in the Classic-Romantic eras.</p><p>Since each of us approaches Gesualdo from the perspective of a<br/>different conceptual map -- and cannot help doing so -- I mention some<br/>of these considerations to suggest the value of multiple analyses<br/>using whatever categories, notations, or methods we are each most at<br/>home with. Theoretical sources from the 16th and early 17th centuries<br/>can inform this process, but the diversity of viewpoints remains.</p><p>While our main focus is on intonation, it is difficult to discuss the<br/>tuning of intervals or sonorities without naming them -- and revealing<br/>something of our own maps and of ourselves.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>M.

Here I&apos;ll use the<br/>letters C for chromatic semitone, and D for diesis:</p><p>   C# Db     D# Eb     E#   F# Gb     G# Ab     A# Bb      B#<br/>C         D         E    F         G         A          B     C<br/>  C  D  C   C  D  C   C D  C  D  C   C  D  C   C  D   C   C  D</p><p>With an instrument tuned at or quite near to 1/4-comma, this MOS<br/>leaves 12 chromatic semitones undivided into two diesis: one on either<br/>side of each of the five notes D, E, G, A, and B, making ten; and one<br/>immediately above each of the notes F and C, adding two more.</p><p>In the special case of 19-tone equal temperament (19-tET), described<br/>and advocated by Guillaume Costeley in 1570, the diesis has a size<br/>identical to that of the chromatic semitone, either being equal to<br/>1/3-tone, so that this MOS defines a complete circulating system. The<br/>1/3-comma temperament of Salinas (1577) with pure minor thirds<br/>produces an almost identical circulating 19-note system.</p><p>For the instruments we are here considering, however, tempered at or<br/>near 1/4-comma, the next MOS is at 31 notes, making the complete system<br/>favored by Vicentino, with its property of virtual musical closure<br/>demonstrated in 1618 by Colonna in his &quot;example of circulation&quot;<br/>cadencing in turn on each of the 31 notes in the cycle of fifths.</p><p>Here there is only one basic type of adjacent interval, the diesis,<br/>although in 1/4-comma meantone there is a slight difference in size<br/>between a larger diesis or fifthtone at 128:125 (~41.06 cents) and a<br/>smaller diesis of about 34.99 cents (very close to 50:49). In this<br/>diagram, I show the 19-note &quot;chromatic&quot; set plus the additional<br/>12-note set together making up a full 31-note enharmonic cycle, using<br/>an asterisk (*) to represent Vicentino&apos;s dot above a note raised by a<br/>diesis:</p><p> C*     Db* D*    Eb* E*  F*     Gb* G*   Ab* A*    Bb*  B*<br/>   C# Db     D# Eb     E#   F# Gb     G# Ab     A# Bb      B#<br/>C         D         E    F         G         A          B     C</p><p>Thus it seems logical to me to speak of a 19-note chromatic set, or a<br/>full 31-note enharmonic set; the idea of a &quot;21-note chromatic set&quot;<br/>seems to me maybe a reflection of some viewpoint not especially<br/>oriented toward either the keyboard instruments we are considering or<br/>their tuning systems.</p><p>While the distinction between a 19-note chromatic set and a 31-note<br/>enharmonic one seems natural, and fits the two kinds of keyboards<br/>which especially typify this adventurous aspect of music in Gesualdo&apos;s<br/>era (not to exclude smaller instruments with some split keys), the<br/>motivation to move beyond the bounds of a 19-set might take on at<br/>least three forms.</p><p>First, in the music of Vicentino and Colonna, there is the obvious<br/>motivation of direct enharmonicism or &quot;diesisism,&quot; with direct<br/>fifthtone steps or altered progressions made possible by having two<br/>keyboard ranks or manuals a fifthtone apart. Such a technique is<br/>reflected in the special notations of Vicentino and Colonna to show<br/>notes a fifthtone above or below usual steps in the 19-note gamut.</p><p>Secondly, in the vocal music of Gesualdo or in one piece for chromatic<br/>harpsichord by Trabaci, there may be the desire to go slightly beyond<br/>the usual 19-note gamut in order to effect a remote transposition or<br/>to obtain sonorities with major or minor thirds in positions near the<br/>edges of the gamut. For example, Gesualdo uses Cb (Vicentino&apos;s B*) in<br/>one madrigal, while Trabaci writes D#-F##-A#, inviting the player of a<br/>&quot;common&quot; chromatic harpsichord with only the usual 19 notes to<br/>substitute D#-F#-A# (with the minor third).</p><p>Finally, as illustrated in Colonna&apos;s circulating piece, one might<br/>desire to have a full 31-note system because of its musical closure.<br/>Costeley&apos;s 19-note &quot;thirdtone&quot; system and the almost identical<br/>1/3-comma system of Salinas also share this property, but arguably<br/>with some compromise in euphony as compared with the 1/4-comma tuning<br/>owing to the greater temperament of the fifth (~7.22 cents, or ~7.17<br/>cents in the 1/3-comma tuning of Salinas), narrowing the major third<br/>by the same amount.</p><p>Although it is possible to go beyond 19 notes for reasons other than<br/>the exuberant enharmonicism of Vicentino or Colonna, nevertheless the<br/>association of &quot;chromatic&quot; keyboards with a 19-note set, and of<br/>&quot;enharmonic&quot; keyboards with a 31-note set, seems generally conducive<br/>to the outlook of the tuning systems and music.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
