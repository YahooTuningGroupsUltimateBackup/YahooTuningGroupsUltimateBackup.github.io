A. Mathieu, in his book &quot;Harmonic<br/>&gt;&gt; Experience&quot;, occasionally analyzes whether the gap between two<br/>&gt;&gt; different JI tones implied by the same ET tone is crossed directly, or<br/>&gt;&gt; over a period of ambiguouty.  Also, (and this is very pertinent to<br/>&gt;&gt; Messian) he analyzes how JI harmony in one tonality slides into<br/>&gt;&gt; symmetrical harmony, which, in some sense, implies ET, where all<br/>&gt;&gt; intervals are the same, and slides out again into a different JI<br/>&gt;&gt; tonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, the question will be whether there is some &quot;force&quot; in the music which<br/>&gt;persists through what might be called an ambiguity, even if that is just<br/>&gt;the memory of a previous tonality.  The gluing together of the different<br/>&gt;tonalities may be somewhat arbitrary in relation to certain kinds of<br/>&gt;analysis, but might also end up being fairly specific from a listening<br/>&gt;experience point of view.  (Yet I hear that Mathieu is interested in the<br/>&gt;experience.)  That&apos;s what I want to find out.  The presence of the ET tones<br/>&gt;obviously can not be excluded as a normalizing &quot;force&quot; in the piece, and<br/>&gt;in organ music (which is what I am mainly considering, for the moment) the<br/>&gt;ET tones are all that is _really_ there.  I wonder if Mathieu looked into<br/>&gt;octatonic.</p><p>    YES! He has a whole chapter devoted to &quot;Symmetrical Harmony and the<br/>Dissolution of Tonality.&quot; Fascinating approach to whole-tone, diminished/octatonic,<br/>and augmented/nonatonic scales and modes. But sorely doesn&apos;t cover much<br/>Messiaen, Scriabin, Ravel&apos;s creation and use of these modes nor symmtrical<br/>decatonic scales/modes. Or two octave and multi-octave forms of &quot;synthetic&quot;<br/>scales/modes...<br/>all subjects of which I am keenly interested in and would love to learn more<br/>(&amp; more of).</p><p>---<br/>Hanuman Zhang, _Gomi no sensei_ [Master of junk]<br/>&amp; Gatherer of Extremely Enlightening Knowledge (or GEEK, for short ;)</p><p>    &quot;To live is to scrounge, taking what you can in order to survive.
