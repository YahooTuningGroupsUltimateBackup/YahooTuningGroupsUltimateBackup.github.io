I<br/>thought maybe it was because it was nearing just intonation and there<br/>were limitations in the equipment so one heard the beats more<br/>distinctly.</p><p>Now I understand, though, that both examples were TOP temperament<br/>with different timbres and what I thought was the &quot;just&quot; version just<br/>has harmonic timbres which don&apos;t work quite as nicely with TOP.</p><p>Thanks for helping to eliminate at least a *bit* of the confusion!!</p><p>JP</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2004 9:16:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Gene, please correct me if I&apos;m wrong -- and please, pretty please,<br/>&gt; answer my last few questions!</p><p>Which were?</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2004 11:42:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Gene, please correct me if I&apos;m wrong -- and please, pretty<br/>please,<br/>&gt; &gt; answer my last few questions!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which were?</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/52655">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/52655</a><br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/52656">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/52656</a></p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2004 3:03:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; We have (3/2)^4/5 = 81/80, which warps to (4/3)^4/(10/3)=128/135.<br/>&gt; So,<br/>&gt; &gt; a 1--3/2--5/2 chord warps to a 1--4/3--5/3 chord--both major.

In Central Europe music between 1700 and 1900, you won&apos;t<br/>find modulation from major to aeolian, with exceptions like maybe<br/>Grieg or Debussy proving the rule. Even a Hungarian like Erkel sticks<br/>to major-minor. Instead, the mapping is is more complex: c,f,g,d stay<br/>the same in cycle of fifths, e goes to es, h to b or h, a to as or a,<br/>the last two based on melodic direction and/or presence of dominant<br/>harmony.&quot;</p><p>If you allow my exceptions, of composers not from central Europe or at<br/>the beginning or end of this time period, both before and after<br/>major-minor tonality, I still think my claim is true.  I have looked<br/>at all the Klavier Variationen of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and also<br/>some Schubert Sonate with repeats of whole sections in minor. Never<br/>aeolian, always accidentals.  In any case, it is impossible to consult<br/>all the music for a proof;  the better argument is simply that the<br/>major-minor tonal system requires the complex minor for satifactory<br/>harmonies and voice leading. This is standard theory from H. Riemann<br/>to H. Schenker.</p><p>For the record, I think the tranformation in your exercise is<br/>beautiful, and the fact that it&apos;s not found in classical music is<br/>part of the attraction. This does raise the interesting problem<br/>however, of generalizing the major-minor tranformation onto some of<br/>your more complex tuning transformations -- what would be the<br/>equivalent there of the use of raised six and seven degrees to smooth<br/>melodies and make dominant harmonies major?</p><p>Gabor</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/2004 12:06:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;alternativetuning&quot;<br/>&lt;alternativetuning@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The transformation from major to aeolian was identified by you as<br/>&gt; being the same as from major to minor.</p><p>I was trying to answer a question by Paul which concerned what I meant<br/>by suggesting we could first transpose to &quot;minor&quot; before warping to<br/>pelogic, leading back to major again.

A little<br/>common sense would help.</p><p>&gt; Paul wrote to say that no, classical music used instead the tranform<br/>&gt; from major to minor and that minor was not just aolian or &quot;natural&quot;<br/>&gt; minor, but included both raised and lowered six and seven degrees.</p><p>Which didn&apos;t interest me, since it doesn&apos;t seem it would help in the<br/>pelogic warping exercise.</p><p>&gt; Paul wrote<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Again, I&apos;d like to see a single example in Bach, Haydn, Mozart,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, or Brahms.</p><p>Thereby putting the burden of proof for a claim which seems obvious<br/>but was hardly relevant to what I was talking about onto me. Am I<br/>supposed to slave away on command delving into silly and irrelevant<br/>side issues? Paul doesn&apos;t actually claim there is no such example, he<br/>merely challenges me to produce one, despite the fact that it is<br/>mind-boggling to imagine that in all that mass of music we can&apos;t find<br/>a single one. Carl, bless his heart, took this idiocy seriously enough<br/>to go find an example. I am sure plenty more are out there.</p><p>&gt; I think he was giving you an opportunity to describe your exercise<br/>&gt; more accurately, and especially to help readers who come from a<br/>&gt; standard musical training, but you responded with a challenge:</p><p>This had nothing to do with what I did--it was a remark as to what one<br/>*might* do, not what I did. If someone wants to do it, why should I be<br/>required to resolve in advance the question of what to do in every<br/>case, and what possible relevance does what common practice in<br/>major-minor transpositions actually is have to that issue anyway? It&apos;s<br/>a total red herring.</p><p>&gt; &quot;I think Paul is right and you won&apos;t find an example of what you are<br/>&gt; suggesting.&quot;</p><p>This claim strikes me as ludicrous, but unlike Carl I did not go find<br/>a counterexample. Good for him. As for your making it, on what basis<br/>do you do so? If people are going to issue challenges to me, I give<br/>one to you--find a single citation supporting it.</p><p>&gt; the better argument is simply that the<br/>&gt; major-minor tonal system requires the complex minor for satifactory<br/>&gt; harmonies and voice leading. This is standard theory from H. Riemann<br/>&gt; to H. Schenker.</p><p>Can you find a quote from Riemann or Schenker saying that never, ever,<br/>not in a million scores can you find an example of someone simply<br/>putting the music into Aolian?</p><p>&gt; For the record, I think the tranformation in your exercise is<br/>&gt; beautiful, and the fact that it&apos;s not found in classical music is<br/>&gt; part of the attraction.</p><p>Thanks, but this is yet another matter--the transformation I did has<br/>absolutely nothing to do with this major/minor business.</p><p>This does raise the interesting problem<br/>&gt; however, of generalizing the major-minor tranformation onto some of<br/>&gt; your more complex tuning transformations -- what would be the<br/>&gt; equivalent there of the use of raised six and seven degrees to smooth<br/>&gt; melodies and make dominant harmonies major?</p><p>Voice leading after warpage is another issue, one that could be<br/>interesting if you want to get beyond a simple-minded note-to-note<br/>mapping.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/2004 3:18:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;Okay, 3rd movement then.  66-69 sustain the tonic of d min and there<br/>&gt; &gt;is no appearance of the seventh degree,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I mentioned that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;but from m 70 through the end of the episode at m. 79 the harmony<br/>&gt; &gt;introduces the dominant and it&apos;s all hs and cises.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cises?
