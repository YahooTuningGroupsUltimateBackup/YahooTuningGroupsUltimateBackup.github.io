Get them to<br/>express their reactions in as much detail as possible, then rank<br/>those descriptions according to the width of the interval, and<br/>compare the listener&apos;s reactions to Paul&apos;s Harmonic Entropy charts:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/entropy.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/entropy.htm</a></p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=11675 href="#11675">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rmcgowan@apple.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2000 11:02:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hm... I sent a note off-line to Keenan; then I saw other people reply, so here&apos;s what I said, just for what it&apos;s worth...</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p><p>You asked...</p><p>&gt; Does anyone have any open questions about alternative tunings<br/>&gt; (especially JI) that might be suitable for a middle school<br/>&gt; science project? All suggestions are welcome, even stupid ones.</p><p>A couple of years ago my son (who&apos;s now 15) did a science project with tunings.  He found appropriate books and calculated what lengths of tubes he would need to cut to make a wind-chime that gave 3:4:5, starting with ONE long aluminum tube we had around.  (The question of tube length is a little more difficult than just having the LENGTHS be 3:4:5, because of the open end calculation.)</p><p>I also helped him demonstrate different intervals and how they sound.  You can use CoolEdit2000 for interval experimentation.</p><p>We also did an excerpt from a Bach piece in several different tuning systems.</p><p>You could make a monochord (or two) and divide it into sections and play intervals by ear; record them using CoolEdit2000 or whatever; and see how they compare to just intervals...</p><p>You could find a way to demonstrate the fundamental tuning problem with commas -- i.e., the seven octaves isn&apos;t really equal to 12 perfect fifths...</p><p>Those are some thoughts.  I hope you post back to the tuning list to tell people what you decide to do for the project.  Good luck.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=11689 href="#11689">ðŸ”—</a>J.P.FFITCH@MATHS.BATH.AC.UK</h3><span>8/22/2000 4:24:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A question I seem to remember which matter in this kind of<br/>investigation (asking people their opinions on sounds) is to ask both<br/>which they prefer and which they consider most consonant.  Some people<br/>prefer dissonant sounds and rough sounds, or so it is alleged.  I type<br/>as someone who like dissonance, and write my music accordingly.</p><p>It would be interesting to determine if the figures I heard, that 25%<br/>of the population prefer non-just non-sweet sounds, is in deed<br/>correct.</p><p>Planning good experiments in this area is not easy, but if you have<br/>access to a semi-captive pool of guinea pigs then I think it is well<br/>worth trying.</p><p>==John ffitch</p></div>
