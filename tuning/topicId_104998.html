Tinctoris.  The quotes from him are in &quot;Source Readings in Music History&quot; selected and annotated by Oliver Strunk.  I&apos;ve found some other comments by contemporary &quot;observers&quot; in other books and also posts on the history of Western Music.  Margot Schulter and Joe Monzo, among others have written very enlighteningly about areas of music history touching upon tuning and other areas of music theory from the middle ages and renaissance.</p></div>
