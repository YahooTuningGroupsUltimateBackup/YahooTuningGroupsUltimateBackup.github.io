The only way that I can see around<br/>this is if the software had a bank of previously recorded notes which<br/>it could compare to the currently played note.  Perhaps, this way it<br/>could group notes into chords instead of tackling individual notes by<br/>themselves.  The problem is that individual notes do not contain<br/>enough information for the software or anyone to decide which ratio<br/>is implied.  There is definitely a discrete difference between the<br/>8/5 of C (which is 160 Hz when compared to C) and the 5/4 of E (which<br/>is 154 1/4 Hz when compared to E).  I know the first step to a<br/>solution of this difficult problem involves the software&apos;s usage of<br/>discrete numbers in Hz instead of these vague ratios.  I think I know<br/>the problem here.  The reason why there is confusion is because we<br/>are having the same physical note represent many other things.  This<br/>physical note in one case can be 160 Hz or it can be 154 1/4 Hz.<br/>Perhaps if we had physical notes representing discrete numbers, we<br/>could clear up the confusion.  Equal temperament does this by shaving<br/>these two numbers into the same thing.  This is where our problem<br/>is.  We are trying to treat Two different things (in this case) as<br/>one by using a keyboard designed for 12 equal temperament.  The only<br/>two ways I can see any solution is either through a bank in which the<br/>software is able to draw past relations to understand the current one<br/>(unlikely) or for a completely new keyboard design which would have a<br/>separate note for the 8/5 of C and the 5/4 of E.  The latter seems<br/>like the only real way.  It makes clear sense now that we cannot take<br/>several different things and merge them into &quot;one.&quot; This will only<br/>cause confusion not only in the software, but in ourselves as well.<br/>We need to realize that for two different things, there must be two<br/>different keys on the keyboard or apparatus altogether.  We must<br/>design a new instrument of the future which allows for these<br/>different identities.  I need to, first of all, figure out how many<br/>different identities are there.  Equal temperament only disregarded<br/>the problem by cramping these dual identities into one for<br/>convenience and impurity.  In this case the 8/5 and the 5/4 are the<br/>same note really.  Two separate identities really are not the same,<br/>and until we realize that we will not have purity without each<br/>separate identity, then we will never have purity.  ET is not purity,<br/>it is a compromise which minimizes note numbers.</p><p>PageWizard</p></div><h3><a id=26864 href="#26864">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>8/10/2001 6:44:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;PageWizard, Magician of the Caverns&quot;</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_26831.html#26831">/tuning/topicId_26831.html#26831</a></p><p>.
