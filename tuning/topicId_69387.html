For the three EDOs which clearly had two<br/>good prime-factor candidates, i used both, on a<br/>2-dimensional lattice. Here&apos;s the whole rundown:</p><p>EDO prime-factors<br/>13 . 11<br/>14 . 29<br/>15 . 7 and 11<br/>16 . 19<br/>17 . 3<br/>18 . 5<br/>19 . 3 and 5<br/>20 . 13<br/>21 . 7<br/>22 . 3 and 5<br/>23 . 17</p><p>2) The other approach is to simply make all the Lattices<br/>one-dimensional, using a single step of the EDO as the<br/>generator.</p><p>What&apos;s nice is that, even tho a Tonescape Musical Piece<br/>is wedded to the tuning embedded in it (i.e., there is<br/>no way to switch a Musical Piece&apos;s tuning within Tonescape),<br/>as long as the various different tunings all have the<br/>same number of pitches, i&apos;m able to edit the .tonescape<br/>files to try different tunings without having to<br/>recompose the whole piece over again. It&apos;s still a<br/>tedious process, but not all that bad. So for the Blackwood&apos;s<br/>Etudes, since each Etude uses a certain cardinality, it&apos;s<br/>really not so hard to try different Lattices for the same<br/>Etude.</p><p>&gt; Blackwood&apos;s notations for 16 and 21 are pretty reasonable<br/>&gt; as far as those things go (you can only stretch traditional<br/>&gt; notation so far), but you still have to pay attention to the<br/>&gt; enharmonic equivalents.</p><p>Well, it&apos;s nice that Blackwood put a legend at the beginning<br/>of each Etude which shows the notation *and* the EDO degree<br/>number! It&apos;s a pain to have to keep referring to it, but<br/>Tonescape offers the &quot;Select Notation&quot; choice to use logarithmic<br/>values on the Lattice, so i just use the cardinality of the<br/>EDO Blackwood used, and as i move the mouse over the score<br/>i can always see which degree the cursor is hovering over.<br/>As i work on a particular Etude, the notation gradually<br/>becomes familiar enough that i&apos;m simply clicking the notes<br/>into the score fairly rapidly and only checking the legend<br/>once in a while.</p><p>I&apos;ve only just started both of these, but i decided to<br/>upload what i have so far to the Tonescape Den Haag group<br/>Files section, for the perusal of those who are playing<br/>around with Tonescape:</p><p><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tonescape_denhaag/files/pieces/blackwood_microtonal-etudes_16-edo.tonescape">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tonescape_denhaag/files/pieces/blackwood_microtonal-etudes_16-edo.tonescape</a></p><p><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tonescape_denhaag/files/pieces/blackwood_microtonal-etudes_21-edo.tonescape">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tonescape_denhaag/files/pieces/blackwood_microtonal-etudes_21-edo.tonescape</a></p><p>The 16-Note Etude was actually started awhile ago, and<br/>the Lattice i used here is 2-dimensional.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2007 12:49:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But that&apos;s exactly why i want those research notes:<br/>&gt; Blackwood divides scales into two broad categories,<br/>&gt; diatonic and symmetric, and goes into great detail<br/>&gt; about the types of harmonic progressions he found<br/>&gt; available in each EDO.</p><p>How does he classify 22?
