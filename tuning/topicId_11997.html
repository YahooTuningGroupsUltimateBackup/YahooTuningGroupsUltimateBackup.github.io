I have since been<br/>unable to find the reference materials where I read this. I&apos;m<br/>wondering if some learned person on the list could possibly help to<br/>guide me to a paper or web site that may help me to read up on this<br/>again. Also of interest, would be information about the use of drone<br/>instruments in any cultures that use microtonal tunings - especially<br/>where an instrument&apos;s sole purpose is to provide a drone for which<br/>other instruments can play or improvise over. Any help would greatly<br/>appreciated.</p><p>Thanks kindly,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3>Bill Alves &#x3C;ALVES@ORION.AC.HMC.EDU&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2000 9:21:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Good Morning to all!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I would like to ask a question about East Indian Classical Music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I remember reading somewhere long ago about the time period in which<br/>&gt;drone instruments (such as the Tamboura) were introduced into the<br/>&gt;musical practice of East Indian Classical Music.

I did remember that it wasn&apos;t that<br/>ancient of a practice, but was less sure of the dates of introduction<br/>of this into widespread practice. I would like to also track down<br/>this book as well.</p><p>There was something that I failed to mention in my eariler post that<br/>I think is kind of interesting. The last two Indian music concerts<br/>that I have attended were &quot;Shashank&quot;, the Bansuri master, and Dr. K.<br/>Raghavendra, a Vina master. At both of these concerts they were using<br/>these little electronic Tamboura boxes to supply the drones. These<br/>boxes were about the size of a small jam-box, and sounded to me like<br/>they had Tamboura samples in them - they were very realistic sounding<br/>too. I was unable to inspect one up close, but I would like to ask if<br/>anyone on the list has ever got to see one of these to where you<br/>might be able to tell me if the intervals of the drones could be<br/>switched to other pitches? I sort of have mixed feelings about the<br/>use of these in Classical Music - because there is nothing like the<br/>real thing, but I must admit that it did serve the drone function<br/>fairly well. Has anyone ever seen one of these up close? It appears<br/>that the Indians are very close to some of the Electro/Acoustically<br/>integrated Classical Music that we have in the West.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Rick McGowan &lt;rmcgowan@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Bonnie Wade in &quot;Music in India&quot; does discuss this question.
