My prayers go out to those who have lost their lives or have been injured or traumatized by these horrific events.  While there are no words to express our sadness, I am deeply moved to see how New Yorkers, and many countries around the world, are standing together in this crisis.  In my neighborhood in Park Slope, Brooklyn, I joined thousands on Friday evening for a silent candle lit vigil.</p><p>In extreme contrast to this tragedy I spent the summer on an isolated retreat in the Adirondack mountains.  I composed the first version of Revelation, my new 95-minute work-in-progress for the &quot;harmonically tuned&quot; piano, which I performed to an overwhelming response at the renowned Klavier Festival Ruhr in Germany.  On October 20, I will be performing Revelation on my new customized Steinway concert grand piano at a solo concert at Lincoln Center (more info. below).  This will be a unique opportunity to hear what I consider to be my most important work.</p><p>I will also be offering a special &quot;Garland of Ragas&quot; workshop on Thurs. Oct. 4.  This workshop will kick-off my fall raga singing class series.  Also, I am sorry to inform you that due to the disastrous situation in NY, my Indian vocal teacher, Ustad Mashkoor Ali Khan, will not be coming to America this fall.</p><p>Below is my fall calendar of events (please note that many dates have changed since prior announcements).</p><p>With my prayers and good wishes,</p><p>Michael</p><p>THURS OCT 4, 7-9pm<br/>&quot;Garland of Ragas&quot; Intro.
