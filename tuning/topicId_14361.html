Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/2000 7:37:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone.</p><p>What with all the excitement this week on the List about harmonic<br/>entropy, Vicentino, 24-note archicembalos, adaptive JI, and (curiously<br/>just last night, as we&apos;ll see) approximations of 7:4 in 19-tone equal<br/>temperament (19-tET) and elsewhere, the following quick bulletin may<br/>fit in nicely.</p><p>In an article I posted last night about a 24-note archicembalo version<br/>of Keenan Pepper&apos;s Phi-based neo-Gothic tuning, there&apos;s a comparison<br/>with intervals in other 24-note tunings sharing the same general<br/>region around 704 cents (fifth size, of course).</p><p>One of the tunings included is a temperament I first described this<br/>summer in an article on neo-Gothic tunings, now referred to as an<br/>&quot;e-based&quot; tuning. In this tuning, the ratio between the whole-tone and<br/>diatonic semitone or limma is equal to Euler&apos;s _e_, about 2.71828.</p><p>This definition results in a fifth of around 704.607 cents. As it<br/>happens, this tuning was my introduction to the region between 29-tET<br/>and 17-tET, so it would be a fond one in any event.</p><p>However, as noted in the 24-note archicembalo article on Pepper&apos;s<br/>tuning, the e-based temperament has a feature only brought out when we<br/>carry it beyond 12 notes: a major third (13 fourths up) and minor<br/>third (14 fifths up) at ~440.110 and ~264.497 cents, about 5.026 cents<br/>and 2.374 cents from 9:7 and 7:6. The latter approximation,<br/>especially, caught my attention.</p><p>Then, just yesterday, I checked out the 15th fifth -- and found that<br/>it generates a minor seventh at ~969.104 cents, only ~0.278 cents from<br/>a pure 7:4. It was interesting that same evening to read on the List<br/>about approximations of 7:4, and also about the relationship of that<br/>interval to 7:6 or 9:7 in various multi-voice sonorities.</p><p>Anyway, the e-based tuning now has a musical claim to fame apart from<br/>the general beauty of its region and its august mathematical<br/>derivation honoring the great Leonhard Euler: what I might call very<br/>accurate &quot;7-flavor&quot; ratios inviting some great neo-Gothic cadential<br/>resolutions.</p><p>Yes, as John deLaubenfels might say, this is an instance where &quot;the<br/>musical context makes it unstable anyway.&quot; Explaining the musical<br/>logic of such intervals in a neo-Gothic context requires a bit of<br/>background material on cadential progressions, and this is a fine<br/>opportunity for a &quot;gentle introduction&quot; to the musical patterns<br/>involved. I hope to supply one in the next few days.</p><p>To make clear the neo-Gothic context, I prefer to speak of these<br/>intervals as &quot;7-flavor&quot; rather than &quot;7-limit&quot;; similarly, the<br/>neo-Gothic context for the use of ratios such as 14:11 or 17:14 might<br/>be surprising to someone who associates different expectations with<br/>&quot;11-limit&quot; or &quot;17-limit&quot; music.</p><p>As I said in the latest 24-note archicembalo tuning article, either a<br/>Renaissance meantone like Vicentino&apos;s temperament (likely 1/4-comma)<br/>or a neo-Gothic tuning like Pepper&apos;s has secrets revealed only when we<br/>go beyond 12 notes.</p><p>With the tuning based on Euler&apos;s _e_, however, it is only when we go<br/>beyond 12 notes that we encounter the distinguishing mark of this<br/>tuning lending it a special &quot;degree of suavity,&quot; to borrow a<br/>felicitous phrase.</p><p>A comment based on some &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; remarks of Paul&apos;s: with<br/>fifths only 2.65 cents from pure, a virtually pure 7:4 (is that called<br/>&quot;a desirable slight detuning,&quot; Paul?), and a 7:6 within 2.5 cents of<br/>pure, maybe the variance of 5 cents in the 9:7 isn&apos;t such a problem,<br/>especially since we are discussing an unstable sonority here. How<br/>timely, Paul, that this topic should come up in your posts just<br/>yesterday on &quot;Synths and Centsibility,&quot; as if in response to the<br/>question I was asking myself: &quot;Is 440 cents close enough?&quot;</p><p>In sum, for now, the special quality of the e-based tuning, in<br/>comparison to other tunings in the same general neighborhood, is that<br/>it offers variations on the usual and rather complex &quot;plateau&quot;<br/>intervals of the region, _plus_ a set of 7-flavor &quot;valley&quot; intervals<br/>on a 24-note archicembalo inviting very efficient cadential<br/>resolutions. It&apos;s the combination of features which gives the e-based<br/>tuning its special place on the continuum.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
