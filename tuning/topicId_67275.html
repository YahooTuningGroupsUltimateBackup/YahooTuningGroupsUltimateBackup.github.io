This<br/>holds the reed in place and prevents it from<br/>bending down into the aperture.  With a fine file,<br/>remove small amounts of material at the clamped<br/>end to lower F1, or at the free end to raise F1.<br/>Avoid touching the reed because heat will cause it<br/>to sound flat.  (See Section 14.)</p><p>One notable difference between bars and reeds is<br/>that in the bass sections of harmonicas,<br/>accordions, etc., one frequently finds small masses<br/>soldered to the free ends of metal reeds.  Figure 16<br/>shows a clamped-free bar with a mass attached at<br/>the free end.  In the confined spaces of small<br/>musical instruments, one cannot use long reeds to<br/>produce low frequencies.  Consequently, musical<br/>instrument builders developed this tuning<br/>technique, which significantly lowers the<br/>fundamental frequencies of relatively short reeds.<br/>Mass loading does not work very well on<br/>percussion instruments because the extra mass on<br/>a bar&apos;s free end severely dampens vibration.  How-<br/>ever, this problem does not apply to wind<br/>instruments because a continuous flow of<br/>compressed air keeps the reeds in motion.  The<br/>following equation gives the fundamental frequency<br/>of a clamped-free bar with a mass at the free end.&quot;</p><p>******************************</p><p>I only have experience with harmonica, accordion,<br/>and harmonium reeds.</p><p>Melodica reeds should be easily accessible by<br/>simply removing a few screws from the back of the<br/>instrument.</p><p>Small reeds are less re-tunable.  I would guess that<br/>melodica reeds could be retuned + or -30 cents.<br/>The great difficulty in tuning reeds is providing<br/>constant air pressure.  Harmonium reeds can vary<br/>as much as +30 cents just by increasing the speed<br/>by which one pedals the bellows.</p><p>Tuning reeds with a fine file will not affect their<br/>timbre.</p><p>Cris Forster, Music Director<br/><a href="http://www.chrysalis-foundation.org">www.chrysalis-foundation.org</a></p></div>
