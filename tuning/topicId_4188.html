Obviously music<br/>theory is the very core of what the tuning list should be all about.  The<br/>problem seems to be more the huge mass of mathematical speculation that has<br/>little to do with music.  It&apos;s theory, but what kind of theory?  All those<br/>nifty concepts may be fun to theorize about, but have you used them<br/>musically?  Some of the more abstract stuff might be best accompanied by<br/>some comments on how &quot;x concept&quot; sounds to you, what effect it has, how it<br/>might be used.  If you are unwilling or unable to demonstrate your pet<br/>theories in some kind of musical context it says volumes about their actual<br/>usefulness.</p><p>I also thought it was odd that Kraig Grady held up Erv Wilson as an example<br/>of clear explanation and simple language.  I have found his stuff to be<br/>extremely difficult reading; very cryptic, vague, technical, abstract,<br/>specialized terminology, etc.  The people who fully understand Wilson&apos;s<br/>writings must be a very small &quot;Elite&quot;, indeed!  Of course Kraig has the<br/>unfair advantage of personal contact.  I have spent a lot of time staring<br/>blankly at statements such as &quot;When the tetrachordal scale begins to exert<br/>inertia along its linear series of Fourths, and the Fourths are variable in<br/>size--but the closing Fourth is invariable--a pattern of variable linear<br/>modulations and/or parallel variable linear modes occurs, based on the<br/>extrapolation of the generating segment of 6 Fourths by its repetition...&quot;<br/>Of course with a lot of time and patience, his work is also an extremely<br/>rewarding and fascinating read, and does slowly become clearer with<br/>re-readings.  As others have said, his work is incredibly dense with<br/>information.  An overdue thanks to Kraig for posting up his work on the<br/>Anaphoria page!  (Is there more coming or is that about it?)</p><p>Juxtaposition Ezine/NetRadio:<br/>Just to comment again on David Beardsley&apos;s internet radio show... I checked<br/>out the archives this week.  (Streaming has never worked well for me.  My<br/>dialup connection at home tends to produce garbled noise, and my network<br/>connection at work, well... one word: firewall.  So it&apos;s nice to see this<br/>stuff archived for downloading.)  Cool!  I&apos;ve been listening to it all week<br/>at work.  Very pleased to finally be able to hear part of the Well-Tuned<br/>Piano (which I have given up on ever owning), and Beauty in the Beast<br/>(soon-to-be-re-released?).  Also good to hear Jon Hassell!  I&apos;ve been<br/>listening to him for years, since long before I knew anything about<br/>microtonality.  These days I realize his radical use of pitch is a large<br/>part of what I have always found so incredibly haunting.  If there is any<br/>musician who deserves the description &quot;unearthly&quot; it&apos;s Hassell!</p><p>list feuding and netiquette:<br/>For your own sake before clicking &quot;send&quot; it is good to keep in mind that<br/>some 300-400 people have to wade through this stuff and that your<br/>embarrassing moments are being archived for posterity.  Of course watching<br/>others have childish arguments in public does have a certain perverse<br/>fascination, like watching certain talk shows.</p><p>Kris Peck<br/>faithful reader, infrequent contributor</p></div><h3><a id=4189 href="#4189">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/1999 8:13:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kris Peck wrote:</p><p>&gt; I also thought it was odd that Kraig Grady held up Erv Wilson as an example<br/>&gt; of clear explanation and simple language.

I really believe that<br/>the examples makes it pretty clear .  <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/purvi.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/purvi.html</a> .<br/>The last statement should help also. Wilson perfers to have the main punch of<br/>his papers in the diagrams. (this is all in my opinion). The statement conveys<br/>that Wilson hears that urge in tetrachord scales to modulate to develop<br/>themselves. Just as other scales develop by cycle of 5ths.Both have happened<br/>in the mid-east and his knowledge of this might be the fountainhead behind it.<br/>He is quite conservative in his speculation in that much of his work is based<br/>on historical examples and <a href="http://practice.Here">practice.Here</a> though he shows a novel way to<br/>modulate with only changing one tone at a time into different but related<br/>scales. Notice how closely everything is related though. He shows actual<br/>scales analogs (Todi, Purvi, and Marwa and how these scales can be modulated<br/>one to the other and/or the way they might have developed by it &quot;inertia&quot; in a<br/>culture that doesn&apos;t modulate. Using modulated versions of a scale for<br/>different ragas! I think once you get one, most of the others fall into place.<br/>I admit that i am a bit slower with somethings.

(Is there more coming or is that about it?)</p><p>There is alot more coming! Some he is sitting on for a variety of reasons.<br/>Some of what is put up is due to personal communications he has with others<br/>and wishes to give them a quick access. If a certain thread occurs on this<br/>list in which I know he has relevant papers on  I suggest he put them up.<br/>Somethings are buried deep in piles, others I think he finds to elementry,<br/>like his diamond diagrams, but I&apos;ll work on them. Once again if you don&apos;t<br/>understand something ask and I will try to explain  what  I know about it.We<br/>should encourage a situation where we all can admit what we don&apos;t know or<br/>understand! I don&apos;t get alot of the ideas or understand why people are doing<br/>some of the things they are doing. I just ask those which seem to might bare<br/>some fruit. Sometimes, when I am asked, it helps me get things clearer in my<br/>own mind.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=4190 href="#4190">ðŸ”—</a>hmiller@xx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>8/6/1999 9:23:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, 6 Aug 1999 18:09:52 -0500, &quot;Kris Peck&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:kpeck@wavetech.net">kpeck@wavetech.net</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;at work.

Obviously music theory is the very core of what the<br/>tuning list should be all about.  The problem seems to be more the<br/>huge mass of mathematical speculation that has little to do with<br/>music.  It&apos;s theory, but what kind of theory?</p><p>IMO, something along the lines of &apos;tuning theory...&apos; with an isolated<br/>emphasis on that one specific component of music -- which may or may<br/>not actually have (or appear to have) a whole hell of a lot to do with<br/>&quot;music.&quot;</p><p>&gt;All those nifty concepts may be fun to theorize about, but have you<br/>used them musically?</p><p>Some of the contributors have flatly stated that they are not<br/>musicians (Dave Keenan I believe is one), so I, for one, tend to<br/>regard this material on it&apos;s own &apos;merit&apos; (i.e., the quality, or<br/>artistry of it&apos;s presentation, etc.), but of course something like<br/>this may really fire one (tuning interested) person up and also leave<br/>the next (tuning interested person) totally cold.</p><p>&gt;Some of the more abstract stuff might be best accompanied by some<br/>comments on how &quot;x concept&quot; sounds to you, what effect it has, how it<br/>might be used.</p><p>Well put, and I certainly agree (especially &quot;how it might be used&quot;).</p><p>&gt;If you are unwilling or unable to demonstrate your pet theories in<br/>some kind of musical context it says volumes about their actual<br/>usefulness.</p><p>&quot;...critics say that if we limit ourselves in this way, we will know<br/>so infinitesimally little about the total musical mind that it may be<br/>of doubtful value.

I just would appreciate an<br/>&gt; INTRODUCTION to the EXPLANATION of what is going on here.  An<br/>&gt; oversimplification would be perfect.</p><p>Yes, I too am quite bewildered by Kraig&apos;s site and would<br/>like to have some background info.  It the whole Anaphoria<br/>thing completely fantastical?  Is there anyone else (real)<br/>who participates in it?  What&apos;s the point?  Are you trying<br/>to prove Shakespeare wrong when he said, &quot;No man is an<br/>island&quot;? :-)</p><p>I read Kraig&apos;s web site and most of his list posts with<br/>bemusement but with precious little understanding.  Don&apos;t<br/>get me wrong, I don&apos;t hold anything against him personally,<br/>it&apos;s just that his E. E. Cummings-esque fractured grammar,<br/>incomplete and misspelled words, sentence fragments, and<br/>nearly random punctuation leave me pretty much in the dark<br/>on what he&apos;s talking about most of the time.  I work with<br/>some creative geniuses whose written and even spoken<br/>communication are very much like Kraig&apos;s, so I assume that<br/>he must also be an exceptionally bright and visionary<br/>individual.  I imagine he has some really interesting things<br/>to say, and wish that I could follow him at all.</p><p>&gt; It sounds from the list that I might<br/>&gt; not be the only person to appreciate a life preserver in this sea of foreign<br/>&gt; concepts.</p><p>Am I right in taking this as a reference not just to Kraig&apos;s<br/>site but to the list as a whole?  There&apos;s no getting around<br/>it, this is a huge, many-faceted, complicated, and esoteric<br/>subject.  To make it worse, it&apos;s mostly subjective, as<br/>well.  It simply takes a long time to get a grasp on the<br/>full range of topics and become familiar with the common<br/>concepts and jargon.  Rush Limbaugh says it takes six weeks<br/>of listening to understand what his radio show is about; I&apos;d<br/>say it takes at least six months of reading posts, books,<br/>and web pages, to understand most of what this list is<br/>about.</p><p>When I first joined, for instance, there was a protracted,<br/>heated discussion involving the definition of &quot;comma&quot; that<br/>just about drove me crazy because I didn&apos;t have enough<br/>background to have the foggiest idea what they were talking<br/>about.  If the same discussion were held today (and no doubt<br/>it will be sometime soon :-) I would follow it quite well.<br/>Patience is a virtue.  I think newbies should glean what<br/>they can, ask about what they don&apos;t quite follow, and simply<br/>ignore what goes completely over their heads.  Soon enough<br/>it will begin to become clearer, and you can go back and<br/>re-read some of the heavier posts.  Some things will remain<br/>a mystery to some of us, and that&apos;s OK, too.</p><p>OTOH, Kraig&apos;s request that we use less jargon and more plain<br/>speak probably has some merit (including for himself).<br/>We&apos;ve all got our own unique background, set of assumptions,<br/>and interests.  More of us would probably do well to leave<br/>footnotes and links directing others to resources that give<br/>some background for we&apos;re trying to communicate.</p><p>In summary, readers should be patient, do some off-list<br/>research, and ask some questions; posters should try to<br/>articulate as clearly as possible what they want to<br/>communicate, thinking about it from the point of view of the<br/>uninitiated where appropriate, and should proofread each<br/>post before sending.  There&apos;s a saying in Nashville that a<br/>good song is not written, it&apos;s re-written.  The same<br/>rule-of-thumb applies to mailing list posts.</p><p>David Finnamore</p></div><h3><a id=4214 href="#4214">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/8/1999 3:31:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Glen Peterson wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Glen Peterson&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:Glen@OrganicDesign.org">Glen@OrganicDesign.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;what are these little<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;linear position&quot; numbers, -6, -4, -2, 0, -5, -3, -1, -6?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; These numbers show the a chain of these different (variable) fourths<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, why are all the numbers negative?</p><p>they don&apos;t have to be.
