I also recall reading somewhere that at a point<br/>in Medieval music the 22/15 diminished fifth was even often used to substitute<br/>for a perfect fifth.<br/>   I have tried looking up the compositional history of which cultures used that<br/>version of the diminished fifths, in what scales and in what type of music...but<br/>with little luck.   Can any of the experts on this list give me some good<br/>pointers?</p></div>
