Should they be related to the Halberstadt keyboard so<br/>that one would use the International Standard A = 440? But this<br/>requires that one has the key A in the keyboard mapping.</p><p>I&apos;ve been using Monzo standard where 1/1s are 2^n Hertz<br/>(n=0,1,2,3,...) with Just Intonation.<br/>I would like to use this standard with equal temperaments as well.<br/>The problem is where to put these pitches on the keyboard. Midi 0 =<br/>32 hz perhaps, so it would be the lowest C?<br/>Any objections?</p><p>Paul, how do you tune your 22-equal keyboard absolute pitches?</p><p>Kalle</p></div><h3>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2002 6:18:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;kalleaho&quot; &lt;kalleaho@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Paul, how do you tune your 22-equal keyboard absolute pitches?</p><p>pretty randomly -- i tune the guitar to itself, and then i use<br/>the &quot;master tuning&quot; on the keyboard to tune the keyboard to the<br/>guitar! (the &quot;natural&quot; [null key sig.] symmetrical decatonic scale is<br/>made to coincide with the open strings of the guitar; there are two<br/>ways of doing this) once i get the bass, though, i&apos;m planning to use<br/>A-440 as a standard -- why not?</p></div>
