A real treasure has been released: the 4-CD box<br/>&quot;Popular Electronics&quot; with the first popular electronic music<br/>ever made, at the Philips Research Laboratories in Eindhoven<br/>from 1956 to 1963.<br/>I have pleaded record companies years ago to bring out this<br/>music of Tom Dissevelt and Kid Baltan. One told me they were<br/>working on it, but the preparations took many years as the<br/>old master tapes had to be restored and digitized. They contain<br/>thousands of splices and were luckily still in good condition.<br/>Searching on the internet I quickly learned that the original<br/>vinyl discs are very rare and do hefty prices.<br/>I had Dissevelt&apos;s master piece &quot;Fantasy in Orbit&quot; on tape,<br/>recorded from the radio in the 80s. At the time when I was in<br/>middle school I used to hear it at friend&apos;s homes whose<br/>fathers worked for Philips.<br/>Kid Baltan&apos;s &quot;Song of the Second Moon&quot; is considered worldwide<br/>to be the first electronic pop-piece.</p><p>Listen to &quot;Whirling&quot; by Tom Dissevelt (US title: Sonik Re-Entry)<br/>and &quot;Mechanical Motions&quot; by Kid Baltan (Dick Raaijmakers)<br/>(US title: The Ray Makers) on <a href="http://www.bastamusic.com/">http://www.bastamusic.com/</a></p><p>The box also contains electronic ballet music of Henk Badings.<br/>The first composition to be made at the Philips NatLab was<br/>Badings&apos; &quot;Ka&iuml;n en Abel&quot; (1956) which begins with a repeated<br/>7-note phrase in just intonation. (so it&apos;s not off-topic! :-)<br/>There&apos;s a lot of interesting documentation inside too.</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
