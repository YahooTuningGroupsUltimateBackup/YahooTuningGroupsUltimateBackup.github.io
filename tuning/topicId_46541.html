(The instrument is a conventional B-flat trumpet<br/>with the valve slides modified in length, with an additional thumb-<br/>operated *analog 4th valve* -- actually a thumb-operated tuning<br/>slide.)  Steve resides in Germany, and he contacted me after Patrick<br/>Ozzard-Low gave him a copy of my spreadsheet outlining a plan for<br/>microtonal valved-brass instruments.</p><p>His concert schedule is as follows:</p><p>September 4th - Macomb, Western Illinois University<br/>September 5th - University of Iowa<br/>September 6th - Grinnell College- possibly..<br/>September 8th - Clarke College, Dubuque<br/>September 9th - Augustana College</p><p>Steve&apos;s website is at:</p><p><a href="http://www.duocontour.com">http://www.duocontour.com</a></p><p>--George</p></div>
