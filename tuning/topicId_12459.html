Incidentally, my warm<br/>greetings to Jacky Ligon, who appears, like me, to have something of a<br/>taste for _large_ integer ratios.</p><p>Anyway, for music such as medieval-Romantic Western European music<br/>which makes a distinction between stable and unstable sonorities<br/>(stable sonorities being fully concordant, and unstable sonorities<br/>sometimes ranging on a subtle scale from relatively concordant to<br/>acutely tense or discordant), I would say that &quot;JI&quot; implies that<br/>_stable_ sonorities have _small_ integer ratios. Unstable sonorities<br/>may often have large integer ratios, and this is a part of JI also.</p><p>The stability or &quot;odd&quot; limit determines how far the expectation of<br/>_small_ integer ratios may go. For Gothic music, this is the 3-limit<br/>(2:1, 3:2, 4:3). For Renaissance-Romantic 5-limit music, it also<br/>includes 5-based ratios such as 5:4 and 6:5. Beyond these simple<br/>intervals, forming the stable or fully concordant sonorities of a<br/>given era, large and complex ratios seem to me a normal feature of JI.</p><p>First, let&apos;s consider the kind of case that the &quot;small integer ratio&quot;<br/>rule may be seeking to exclude, where a tuning may be &quot;rational&quot;<br/>without being &quot;JI&quot; in any usual sense.</p><p>For example, suppose we define a fifth at 16384:10935 -- certainly an<br/>integer ratio. As it turns out, this &quot;just tuning&quot; is virtually<br/>identical to 12-tone equal temperament (12-tet), as Kirnberger and<br/>other late 18th-century theorists pointed out (sometimes using instead<br/>a fourth at 10935:8192). Why isn&apos;t this tuning &quot;JI&quot;? The answer is<br/>that just as with 12-tet, we won&apos;t get any _small_ integer ratios.</p><p>In contrast, let&apos;s look at 3 JI systems which do have small integer<br/>ratios for stable concords as defined in a given system. Here I&apos;ll<br/>list the most complex stable sonority for each system -- in each case,<br/>featuring two special varieties of these simple ratios.</p><p>A _multiplex_ ratio has one string-length or frequency an exact<br/>multiple of the other, e.g. 2:1, 3:1, etc. -- generally n:1.</p><p>A _superparticular_ ratio has one string-length or frequency equal to<br/>the other plus an integral portion of it, e.g. 3:2, 4:3, etc. --<br/>generally n + 1:n.</p><p>Now let&apos;s compare some of these ratios and sonorities -- and also some<br/>unstable intervals with larger integer ratios -- in three JI systems,<br/>the 3-limit, 5-limit, and 7-limit:</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>system type       stable sonority         example of complex ratio<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>3-limit           trine (2:3:4)            81:64 (major third)<br/>5-limit           triad (4:5:6)            32:25 (diminished fourth)<br/>7-limit           tetrad (4:5:6:7)         49:40 (neutral third?)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Note that in the 3-limit or Pythagorean JI of the Gothic era (around<br/>1200-1420), the stable three-voice sonority of the complete trine has<br/>pure intervals: the 2:1 octave, 3:2 fifth, and 4:3 fourth. However, an<br/>unstable interval like the major third (81:64) has a rather complex<br/>ratio -- nicely fitting its musical role of often resolving to a pure<br/>unison or fifth, which resolves the tension.</p><p>In a 5-limit system, we have the pure 3-limit intervals plus also the<br/>pure major third (5:4) and minor third (6:5), which with the 3:2 fifth<br/>make up a triad. However, again, we find that an unstable interval<br/>like the diminished fourth (32:25, two 5:4 thirds) has a complex<br/>ratio, and is used in Renaissance music as a definite point of<br/>tension, resolving to some concordant sonority with small integer<br/>ratios.</p><p>In a 7-limit system, we additionally have such intervals as the pure<br/>7:4 minor seventh and 7:6 minor third. In some musics using these<br/>intervals, they may participate in a stable &quot;tetrad&quot; of 4:5:6:7. Once<br/>again, we also encounter more complex ratios such as 49:40, a kind of<br/>&quot;neutral third&quot; about midway between major and minor (although I&apos;m not<br/>sure how 7-limit JI people would describe this interval).</p><p>Note that in moving from 3-limit to 5-limit to 7-limit and beyond, we<br/>find some complex intervals at a lower stability limit which may have<br/>simpler equivalents at a higher limit. Thus the complex 81:64 of<br/>medieval 3-limit style gets replaced by the simpler 5:4 of Renaissance<br/>5-limit style -- each tuning fitting its own style. Similarly, if we<br/>go as high as the 11-limit, we might compare the 49:40 of 7-limit with<br/>the smaller and simpler ratio 11:9 (a common neutral third).</p><p>In other words, the motto for JI systems of this historical kind might<br/>be: &quot;Integer ratios only, small _and_ large.&quot; However, if there are<br/>_only_ large ratios like Kirnberger&apos;s 10935:8192 without any small<br/>ones like 3:2 and 4:3, then we are dealing with a &quot;rational tuning&quot; as<br/>opposed to a &quot;JI system&quot; in the usual sense.</p><p>Note that some people choose to consider only 5-limit or higher<br/>systems as &quot;JI,&quot; possibly because such systems involve a distinctive<br/>complexity while 3-limit JI is a regular tuning with a structure much<br/>like that of other regular tunings such as Renaissance meantones.</p><p>In such regular tunings, we have a &quot;plane&quot; of two dimensions: 2-limit<br/>octaves (2:1) and chains of fifths all the same size (a pure 3:2 in<br/>3-limit or Pythagorean JI, smaller than pure in meantones, larger than<br/>pure in some neo-Gothic regular tunings). All intervals can be<br/>generated either from a chain of identical fifths, or from octaves.</p><p>In contrast, with 5-limit or higher JI system, we have a complex<br/>&quot;polyhedral&quot; geometry where a pure 5:4 major third (unlike a 3-limit<br/>81:64), for example, _cannot_ be generated from four pure 3:2 fifths,<br/>but represents a separate &quot;dimension&quot; of organization.</p><p>Personally, speaking in good part as an advocate of 3-limit JI, I<br/>would say that the planar/polyhedral issue is distinct from the basic<br/>concept of classic JI: a system with all intervals defined as integer<br/>ratios, and _some_ of these intervals defined as _small_ integer<br/>ratios. More typically, in 3-limit, 5-limit, and 7-limit systems<br/>alike, small integer ratios are used for stable concords, but often<br/>impressively large integer ratios for various unstable intervals and<br/>sonorities.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=12468 href="#12468">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2000 2:59:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.
