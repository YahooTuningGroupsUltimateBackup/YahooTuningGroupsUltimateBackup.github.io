But my intention was simply to offer Ozan an<br/>idea for a small adjustment to his preferred tuning<br/>system that might improve it for his use.  That idea<br/>preserved his 79 steps per octave, whereas this one<br/>doubles them to 158 steps per octave.  Given that he<br/>feels the 79 steps already approaches the limits of<br/>the abilities of his qanun-maker, I&apos;m fairly sure that<br/>doubling the number of steps is not really an option.<br/>Besides, even if it could be made, could it be played?</p><p>&gt; 3- consider fifth as 700 and fourth as 500 cent then f-g with nb=26 is a<br/>&gt; part of 156-edo and c-f and g-c&apos; with na=66 are part of 158-edno or<br/>&gt; 159-edno based on 66-ed(500c)</p><p>&gt; So we see that we have a hybrid structure of edo and nedo systems with 2<br/>&gt; different packages . if we had na=65 then we could have only 156-edo .</p><p>A 500-cent fourth and 160-odd steps seems a poor<br/>compromise when we can have a 498-cent fourth<br/>using half the steps ...</p><p>[snip]</p><p>[Ozan:]<br/>&gt; &gt; One requires 636-tET to approximate all intervals with an error of less<br/>&gt; &gt; than 1 cents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here is the cycle:<br/>[snip]</p><p>[Yahya, earlier:]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Depending on what kinds of F# and Gb you wanted,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (assuming you are using this for maqam music, you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; probably do want these), there are several other<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ways to fill the 9/8 gap between F and G.  The most<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; obvious of these still gives only two step sizes, and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; divides the 9/8 gap into 13 equal steps each of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (701.954 - 498.045)/13 = 203.909/13 = 15.685 cents.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;  a=15.092<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;  b=15.685<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;  na=66<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;  nb=13<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The step sizes a and b are much closer to each other<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; than in Ozan&apos;s tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; This is symmetrical about 600 cents, which is NOT a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; scale degree, but falls exactly between degrees 39<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and 40 of the scale, which are at 592.155 &amp; 607.840<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; cents.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The important questions here are: what notes between<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; F and G do you want to approximate well, and how<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; closely?</p><p>[Yahya:]<br/>&gt; Oz, I&apos;m glad you&apos;re pleased with it. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The jump from Cb to Gb is 699.4 cents, not a bad fifth.<br/>&gt; When would you want to jump from B to Gb?  8-0<br/>&gt; Speaking for myself, I can&apos;t see it as a natural melodic<br/>&gt; movement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m also pleased that you supplied the Scala &quot;recipe&quot;<br/>&gt; for creating the tuning, as there must be others who,<br/>&gt; like me, find Scala a bit daunting to use.  For myself,<br/>&gt; I have no trouble with using a command-line interface,<br/>&gt; or even with scripting - I was the very devil with both<br/>&gt; DOS batch files and unix scripts, even writing useful<br/>&gt; production systems in the latter.  The only difficulties<br/>&gt; I really find with Scala are -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) Knowing which command to use to get the sounds or<br/>&gt; info I need; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) Understanding what all the info Scala produces<br/>&gt; really _means_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the latter point, I recently hinted I&apos;d like to<br/>&gt; understand the idea of &quot;constant structures&quot; in<br/>&gt; tuning better.  Can anyone explain this idea simply,<br/>&gt; please?</p><p>Are you able to help me with &quot;constant structures&quot;?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya<br/>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.375 / Virus Database: 268.2.1/278 - Release Date: 9/3/06</p></div>
