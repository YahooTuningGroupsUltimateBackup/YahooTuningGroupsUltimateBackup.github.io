They&apos;re just<br/>getting ready to start working on the music, and I am wondering what<br/>instruments would have been in use at that time, and what the tunings<br/>might have been. Also, where would one get said instruments, if<br/>anywhere? The play is called Tantalus, and it is a 15 hour show, believe<br/>it or not...a complete show runs 3 consecutive days, or 2 weekend<br/>days...whacked, but should be interesting. Any help is appreciated,<br/>please post me privately (unless an answer would be of general tuning<br/>list interest, which it well might)...thanks...Hstick</p></div>
