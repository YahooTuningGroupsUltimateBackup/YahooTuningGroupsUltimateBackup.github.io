Thank you.</p><p>Hmmm, let me turn into a &quot;guide writer&quot; for a while.</p><p>1. Download the two files (Scala and the scale archive) from here:<br/><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/downloads.html">www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/downloads.html</a></p><p>2. After completing the instalation or unzipping the contents of the Scala<br/>package (depending on which version you have downloaded), unzip the scale<br/>archive into the folder where you have Scala installed (be sure to use the<br/>option to unzip folders as well, otherwise the scales could get mixed up<br/>with the default Scala files).</p><p>3. Connect your computer to an external keyboard via MIDI and set the Yamaha<br/>XG50 softsynth to be receiving the data from your external keyboard in order<br/>to be able to play the XG50 sounds in real time.</p><p>4. When you&apos;re sure it works, run Scala.</p><p>5. Let&apos;s say we want to tune the 12-tone version of Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma<br/>meantone in XG. This tuning can be found in the file of &quot;mean2sev.scl&quot; in<br/>the scale archive. As we have already unzipped the contents of the archive<br/>into the same directory where we saved Scala itself, we can tell Scala to<br/>locate and load this file by typing &quot;Load scl\mean2sev&quot; onto Scala&apos;s command<br/>line. If everything goes right, you should see something like &quot;2/7-comma<br/>meantone (Zarlino, 1558(&quot; when the load has been done.</p><p>6. To tell Scala to use XG format for retuning, type &quot;Set Synth 108&quot;.</p><p>7. To verify if you can successfully tune your XG synth into the scale we<br/>just loaded, type &quot;Send/Screen&quot;. If none of the lines is marked with a star,<br/>then everything is okay. If there are some lines marked with a star, this<br/>means that the tuning deviations from 12-equal are greater than -64..+63<br/>cents. If this happens, try &quot;Set Adjustment&quot; and then &quot;Send/Screen&quot; again.<br/>If you still see some lines with stars, then it is impossible to tune this<br/>scale into XG. As the 2/7-comma meantone tuning doesn&apos;t have so strong<br/>tuning deviations, you definitely won&apos;t need to use &quot;Set Adjustment&quot;. But<br/>you probably will, as far as some more unusual tunings are concerned.</p><p>8. Type &quot;Send&quot;. This should retune the first MIDI channel to 2/7-comma<br/>meantone. Unfortunately, Scala doesn&apos;t have an option to retune channels<br/>2..16. Try playing the first MIDI channel via your external keyboard to hear<br/>if it has been successfully retuned. If this doesn&apos;t work, type &quot;Send/File&quot;<br/>followed by a name to save the MIDI file with. Scala will put all the<br/>commands into the file and add a &quot;.mid&quot; extension to the name you give. Then<br/>try loading the new MIDI file into your XG50 player and see if the first<br/>MIDI channel has been retuned okay.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=72660 href="#72660">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/9/2007 8:56:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; 8.

If you wish, you can also use a common<br/>text editor to write your own scales and then you can load them into Scala<br/>and work with them. Why do you think the &quot;scl&quot; format is so popular among<br/>people who want to share tunings? Right for the reasons I&apos;ve just explained.<br/>Moreover, if you were familiar with the &quot;scl&quot; format, you could very easily<br/>tell us what those tunings are that you would like to tune in XG.</p><p>&gt; Also, my few efforts to make sense of Scala have been frustrating as I<br/>have found<br/>&gt; it to be counter-intuitive, awkward, and cumbersome to use.</p><p>I can&apos;t agree with you. Maybe you are not familiar with using command-line<br/>applications in general but you can&apos;t blame this on Scala. It&apos;s like using<br/>any other command-line interface -- you have to very precisely know what you<br/>want the program to do for you before you can start thinking about which<br/>commands to use for it.</p><p>&gt; However, if it is the ONLY way (is it?) to tune the XG50 soft synth then I<br/>&gt; guess I&apos;ll have to bite the bullet and delve into Scala.

Scala is not just a<br/>piece of software for sending tuning commands, it can do much much more. And<br/>it&apos;s noone else&apos;s decision than yours if you find it useful. For example,<br/>when I make my own tunings, I very often analyze them in Scala from various<br/>points of &quot;tuning view&quot; and sometimes I also edit them in Scala. In other<br/>cases, I even make them all in Scala from the very begining which can often<br/>save me a lot of time if the scales are large in size or if there is some<br/>kind of &quot;order&quot; or regularity in them which is easy to describe in Scala.</p><p>&gt; Admittedly I haven&apos;t tried your suggestions yet due to feeling a bit<br/>&gt; intimidated by the apparently steep learning curve in using Scala.<br/>&gt; (I played around with it for a few minutes just now and, as usual,<br/>&gt; couldn&apos;t make any sense out of it at all.

There&apos;s even a file called &quot;first.txt&quot; which<br/>contains, separately from any other instructions, a brief explanation on how<br/>to try your first retuning experience.</p><p>&gt; However I did notice that there was nothing in your instructions<br/>&gt; about linking Scala with XG50.  You just &quot;Send&quot; from Scala and it<br/>&gt; automatically knows to send it to the XG50 softsynth which is also<br/>&gt; open on the computer at the same time????</p><p>I think it depends on what MIDI device you set as your default output device<br/>for MIDI files. For example, some time ago, I was using Cakewalk and I had<br/>the XG100 on my Win98SE installed. When I told Cakewalk to use the XG100 as<br/>the default output device, I could even control the XG100 via my external<br/>MIDI keyboard. As far as I know, Scala uses the Megamid player for sending<br/>MIDI data. At this time, I&apos;m not sure if Megamid needs to be set up in some<br/>particular way to be able to find the XG driver. But I never worried about<br/>that because I always used &quot;Send/File&quot; and Scala saved the MIDI file for me<br/>automatically. And for another thing, you shouldn&apos;t confuse the XG50 player<br/>and the XG50 driver. When you install the XG50 software, you get an XG<br/>player but you primarily get the XG50 driver installed without which the<br/>player couldn&apos;t work. And if you have some well-donfigurable software for<br/>working with MIDI (like Cakewalk), you can use the XG50 driver with it even<br/>without opening the XG50 player.</p><p>&gt; I only use a few 12-tone, octave repeating, just intonation scales<br/>&gt; and I know the cent offsets by heart.  Is there any way to tune the<br/>&gt; scale of the XG softsynth without using Scala?  Is there any way to<br/>&gt; edit the scale directly in the XG softsynth without resorting to<br/>&gt; using other software?</p><p>You can, of course, retune XG synths without Scala. But sooner than anything<br/>else comes, be very aware that you will need lots of SysEx commands to<br/>manage this. And if you really want to, then it would be much easier if you<br/>made your own piece of software which could write the MIDI file for you<br/>rather than writing the SysEx commands by hand in some data editing<br/>software. For example, a few years ago, when I wanted to tune various scales<br/>on essentially all the MIDI channels in XG, I finally wrote a small piece of<br/>code for QBasic that made the entire MIDI file for me with all the necessary<br/>SysEx commands in it. Later, this saved me weeks and even months of work as<br/>I needed to do this very very often. And for the other thing, the XG50<br/>player is just a player and not a MIDI data editor. If you are serious about<br/>editing the SysEx commands, I could suggest using Cakewalk&apos;s ability to edit<br/>and manage these as Cakewalk also allows to send them to any MIDI device.<br/>To briefly describe the format of the SysEx commands for scale tuning in XG,<br/>it goes, in hex, like this:<br/>$F0, $43, $10, $4C, $08, ChannelNumber, NoteNumber, TuningDeviation, $F7<br/>-- where &quot;ChannelNumber&quot; can be any value from $00 to $0F (meaning channels<br/>1 to 16, respectively), &quot;NoteNumber&quot; can be any value from $41 to $4C (which<br/>means notes from C to B in the 12-tone chromatic scale), and<br/>&quot;TuningDeviation&quot; can be anything from $00 to $7F (meaning a tuning<br/>deviation of -64..+63 cents away from 12-equal, respectively).</p><p>One last thought. If you finally manage to do your XG retuning, please send<br/>me your results. I have a hardware XG-compatible synth and I would be happy<br/>to hear your tunings.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=72702 href="#72702">ðŸ”—</a>ma1973 &#x3C;marcsavage73@mchsi.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/2007 8:34:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr, again my thanks for your patient and thorough explanations.<br/>Undoubtedly more than I deserved considering my uninformed criticism of<br/>Scala.  Actually, I didn&apos;t mean to suggest that the problem was with<br/>Scala -- rather that I have found it awkward and difficult to use and<br/>have wondered about whether the investment of time to learn it would pay<br/>off in capabilities that I would use.  Your advocacy for Scala is taken<br/>to heart and I can now see that the advantages may well justify the<br/>effort.</p><p>&gt; Moreover, if you were familiar with the &quot;scl&quot; format, you could very<br/>easily<br/>&gt; tell us what those tunings are that you would like to tune in XG.</p><p>I have been very impressed with the extremely wide range of tunings<br/>explored by members of this group.  Because my own interest in tunings<br/>is intimately connected with my study of Indian classical music (raga),<br/>including original works based on this tuning system, I have used only<br/>basic five-limit just intonation scales.  However I have used these<br/>scales and intervals for over thirty years and have thus become quite<br/>familiar with the pure sonorities of just intonation which I love very<br/>much.</p><p>These are nearly all the intervals (measured from the tonic) that I use:<br/>1/1, 16/15, 9/8, 6/5, 5/4 (or 81/64), 4/3, 45/32 (or 64/45), 3/2, 8/5,<br/>5/3 (or 27/16), 9/5 (or 16/9), 16/15.  Of course by considering the<br/>intervals between various members of this set, several other intervals<br/>come into play including 10/9, 32/27, 128/81.  Also significant for this<br/>genre of music are 256/243, 729/512, 243/128.  The important commas in<br/>this system are 81/80, 25/24, 243/128.  That about covers the entire<br/>pitch palette that I use.  The pitches used in any given composition are<br/>those which most effectively evoke the character of the raga being<br/>played.</p><p>All the tunable hardware synths I have (quite a few!) tune individual<br/>notes by offsetting cents for each note from standard 12-EDO.  As I have<br/>long since memorized the cent offsets for the above ratios, I just enter<br/>those on the front panel of the synth.  Some of the synths will save<br/>lots of scales, others fewer or only one.</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t agree with you. Maybe you are not familiar with using<br/>command-line<br/>&gt; applications in general but you can&apos;t blame this on Scala. It&apos;s like<br/>using<br/>&gt; any other command-line interface -- you have to very precisely know<br/>what you<br/>&gt; want the program to do for you before you can start thinking about<br/>which<br/>&gt; commands to use for it.</p><p>Yes, I guess this is what I meant by &quot;awkward and cumbersome&quot;.  I<br/>remember the command line interfaces of some old DOS programs from the<br/>eighties and I found those awkward and cumbersome too.  I was so glad<br/>that the advent of the graphical user interface and menu commands<br/>largely did away the command line!  So I balked -- prematurely perhaps<br/>-- when confronted with Scala&apos;s command line interface.  I&apos;ll give it<br/>another shot based on your well-stated advocacy.</p><p>  &gt; As far as my personal experience goes, I definitely don&apos;t use Scala<br/>for only<br/>&gt; retuning my synth but for lots of other things as well. Scala is not<br/>just a<br/>&gt; piece of software for sending tuning commands, it can do much much<br/>more. And<br/>&gt; it&apos;s noone else&apos;s decision than yours if you find it useful.

As you<br/>can see from my list of intervals, and the fact that all the scales I<br/>use consist of 12-or-fewer tones per octave and are octave repeating,<br/>most of these capabilities are beyond my requirements.  I was hoping to<br/>find a way to program scales in XG50 as easily as I do from the front<br/>panels of my hardware synths, including my Yamaha PSR730 which is fully<br/>XG compatible.  I am beginning to see now that this probably isn&apos;t<br/>possible.</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s a file in the Scala folder called &quot;help.htm&quot; which should tell<br/>you<br/>&gt; everything you&apos;re looking for. There&apos;s even a file called &quot;first.txt&quot;<br/>which<br/>&gt; contains, separately from any other instructions, a brief explanation<br/>on how<br/>&gt; to try your first retuning experience.</p><p>This is very helpful.  Thank you for your patience in pointing out the<br/>basics which I could/should have discovered for myself with a bit more<br/>effort.</p><p>&gt; I think it depends on what MIDI device you set as your default output<br/>device<br/>&gt; for MIDI files. For example, some time ago, I was using Cakewalk and I<br/>had<br/>&gt; the XG100 on my Win98SE installed. When I told Cakewalk to use the<br/>XG100 as<br/>&gt; the default output device, I could even control the XG100 via my<br/>external<br/>&gt; MIDI keyboard. As far as I know, Scala uses the Megamid player for<br/>sending<br/>&gt; MIDI data. At this time, I&apos;m not sure if Megamid needs to be set up in<br/>some<br/>&gt; particular way to be able to find the XG driver. But I never worried<br/>about<br/>&gt; that because I always used &quot;Send/File&quot; and Scala saved the MIDI file<br/>for me<br/>&gt; automatically. And for another thing, you shouldn&apos;t confuse the XG50<br/>player<br/>&gt; and the XG50 driver. When you install the XG50 software, you get an XG<br/>&gt; player but you primarily get the XG50 driver installed without which<br/>the<br/>&gt; player couldn&apos;t work. And if you have some well-donfigurable software<br/>for<br/>&gt; working with MIDI (like Cakewalk), you can use the XG50 driver with it<br/>even<br/>&gt; without opening the XG50 player.</p><p>This is also very helpful and clarifying.  Again, my thanks for your<br/>patience and diligence in providing this information.</p><p>&gt; You can, of course, retune XG synths without Scala. But sooner than<br/>anything<br/>&gt; else comes, be very aware that you will need lots of SysEx commands to<br/>&gt; manage this. And if you really want to, then it would be much easier<br/>if you<br/>&gt; made your own piece of software which could write the MIDI file for<br/>you<br/>&gt; rather than writing the SysEx commands by hand in some data editing<br/>&gt; software. For example, a few years ago, when I wanted to tune various<br/>scales<br/>&gt; on essentially all the MIDI channels in XG, I finally wrote a small<br/>piece of<br/>&gt; code for QBasic that made the entire MIDI file for me with all the<br/>necessary<br/>&gt; SysEx commands in it. Later, this saved me weeks and even months of<br/>work as<br/>&gt; I needed to do this very very often. And for the other thing, the XG50<br/>&gt; player is just a player and not a MIDI data editor. If you are serious<br/>about<br/>&gt; editing the SysEx commands, I could suggest using Cakewalk&apos;s ability<br/>to edit<br/>&gt; and manage these as Cakewalk also allows to send them to any MIDI<br/>device.<br/>&gt; To briefly describe the format of the SysEx commands for scale tuning<br/>in XG,<br/>&gt; it goes, in hex, like this:<br/>&gt; $F0, $43, $10, $4C, $08, ChannelNumber, NoteNumber, TuningDeviation,<br/>$F7<br/>&gt; -- where &quot;ChannelNumber&quot; can be any value from $00 to $0F (meaning<br/>channels<br/>&gt; 1 to 16, respectively), &quot;NoteNumber&quot; can be any value from $41 to $4C<br/>(which<br/>&gt; means notes from C to B in the 12-tone chromatic scale), and<br/>&gt; &quot;TuningDeviation&quot; can be anything from $00 to $7F (meaning a tuning<br/>&gt; deviation of -64..+63 cents away from 12-equal, respectively).</p><p>Again, this is very helpful.  I actually have some experience with SysEx<br/>as I have had to use it to program my array of MIDI Solutions<br/>processors.  Though it certainly deserves the label of &quot;awkward and<br/>cumbersome&quot; -- probably much more than Scala! -- familiarity does<br/>prevent me from being too intimidated by SysEx.  However, I think you<br/>are implying that the Scala route is easier, not to mention all its<br/>other capabilities -- an excellent point well taken.</p><p>&gt; One last thought. If you finally manage to do your XG retuning, please<br/>send<br/>&gt; me your results. I have a hardware XG-compatible synth and I would be<br/>happy<br/>&gt; to hear your tunings.</p><p>Thank you for your interest.  My principal challenge and innovation, I<br/>think, has been to go well beyond merely setting the basic pitches on my<br/>synths, but to develop a real-time style of playing that allows me to<br/>employ all the characteristic embellishments and ornamentation used in<br/>Indian classical music, including all the bends, slides, rhythmic<br/>drones,etc.  After years of experimentation I have developed an<br/>instrument which gives me all these capabilities and is readily playable<br/>in real time.  It involves the use of a conventional synth keyboard<br/>played by the right hand only, a long ribbon controller played by the<br/>left hand, and a set of MIDI pedals played by both feet.  I call my<br/>instrument the &quot;Ribbonium&quot;.</p><p>To my knowledge, the Ribbonium is the only instrument of its type and<br/>the only electronic instrument I have ever seen or heard of that allows<br/>the incredibly flexible style of real-time melody playing required for<br/>Indian classical instrumental music.  I have studied with a sitar<br/>instructor, and found that the Ribbonium could do just about anything<br/>the sitar could do, and in many cases much more.</p><p>I have made a couple informal recordings of myself improvising<br/>(noodling?) on the Ribbonium but I don&apos;t have a website for posting<br/>those files.  In any case, the recordings are in audio CD format, and I<br/>think would need to be converted to MP3 before they could be shared.</p></div><h3><a id=72703 href="#72703">ðŸ”—</a>ma1973 &#x3C;marcsavage73@mchsi.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/2007 8:40:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Why did my post look so well-formatted in the &quot;preview&quot; pane, and then<br/>so terribly awkward with all the unwanted turnover lines when I posted<br/>it?</p></div><h3><a id=72707 href="#72707">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/2007 2:24:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I have been very impressed with the extremely wide range of tunings<br/>&gt; explored by members of this group.  Because my own interest in tunings<br/>&gt; is intimately connected with my study of Indian classical music (raga),<br/>&gt; including original works based on this tuning system, I have used only<br/>&gt; basic five-limit just intonation scales.  However I have used these<br/>&gt; scales and intervals for over thirty years and have thus become quite<br/>&gt; familiar with the pure sonorities of just intonation which I love very<br/>&gt; much.</p><p>As far as just intonation goes, I definitely share your fondness for the<br/>synchronous sonority of the intervals and chords. I&apos;ve been examining their<br/>properties very closely a few years ago, sometimes up to the 13-limit<br/>factors, and made quite a lot of scales as a result, some of which I finally<br/>managed to use in my own music. Later, I even made a few scales reflecting<br/>various possible ways of tempering 5-limit and 7-limit intervals to give<br/>equal beating chords and at the same time not to get too much &quot;out of tune&quot;.<br/>I&apos;m not sure which release of Manuel&apos;s Scale archive you have but if you<br/>look for filenames begining with &quot;parizek&quot;, you should find about twenty of<br/>them, most of which are made of rational intervals. - BTW: Have you ever<br/>heard East African folk music? If you haven&apos;t, here it is performed by the<br/>&quot;Master Musicians of Tanzania&quot; in 1987 with the lead singer Hukwe Zawose:<br/><a href="http://download.yousendit.com/CF8ED72A6A72F924">http://download.yousendit.com/CF8ED72A6A72F924</a></p><p>&gt; Again, this is very helpful.

But I think that you&apos;ll soon realize you need really an<br/>awful lot of messages to write because a single message can retune just only<br/>one note (in all octaves) on only one MIDI channel. So if you want to shift<br/>the pitches of all Cs 30 cents higher (meaning all the MIDI channels except<br/>10), you&apos;ll need 15 messages, one for each MIDI channel. And if you want to<br/>tune some 12-tone scales on all the MIDI channels (excluding 10, of course),<br/>you&apos;ll need 180 SysEx messages. And that&apos;s exactly why I wrote my small<br/>Qbasic utility that converts plain ASCII text numbers to a perfectly usable<br/>MIDI file with all the needed SysEx messages and MIDI time positioners<br/>included.</p><p>&gt; I have made a couple informal recordings of myself improvising<br/>&gt; (noodling?) on the Ribbonium but I don&apos;t have a website for posting<br/>&gt; those files.

But be<br/>aware that the output links are only temporary links -- for example,<br/>YouSendIt deletes your files one week after you upload them and if they are<br/>needed for longer, you have to upload them again. Unfortunately, I&apos;m leaving<br/>for two weeks tomorrow morning and, what&apos;s worse, I&apos;ll be completely<br/>&quot;Internet non-connective&quot; so I&apos;ll be unable to download just anything until<br/>the August 26th.</p><p>Petr</p><p>PS: Speaking of just intonation, I think you might find this interesting.<br/>When I posted this here a few months ago, some of the other tuning list<br/>members said they liked it so much they played it to other people.
