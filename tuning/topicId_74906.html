Everything seems to fit with that.</p><p>Although I&rsquo;ve never heard about tetracot, I have to say, of course, that you&rsquo;ve guessed it perfectly again. This time, the generator was the 9th root of 5/2, which is almost a model example of tempering out the PSC of &quot;5 -9  4&quot; (or 20000/19683).</p><p>To be sincere, I wanted, at first, to divide the 5/2 into 18 steps instead of 9 and use this as the generator, which is a very nice kind of 7-limit temperament. But this would require at least two MIDI channels for the scale so I couldn&rsquo;t play it in its &quot;entirety&quot; in real-time. Maybe I&rsquo;ll try some multi-track layering with my sequencer later. Anyway, I was surprised when I first realized how good the 7-limit approximations were in this tuning.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=74916 href="#74916">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2008 2:57:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yahya wrote:</p><p>&gt; Your latest piece is very enjoyable.
