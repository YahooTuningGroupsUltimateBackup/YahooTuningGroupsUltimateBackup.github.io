The temmperament is just in the 7-limit<br/>for practical purposes; with a fifth sharp by 0.065 cents, a major<br/>third by 0.05 cents and a 7 flat by .139 cents. The temperament is so<br/>close to just that in fact one may simply use 27/25 in the place of<br/>2^(1/9) and 36/35 in the place of &apos;a&apos;. Thus the 7-limit, involving<br/>four primes, can be very closely approximated by these two rational<br/>numbers:</p><p>(27/25)^4 / (36/35)^3 ~ 5/4 (0.325 cents sharp)<br/>(27/25)^6 / (36/35)^2 ~ 3/2 (0.07 cents flat)<br/>(27/25)^8 / (36/35)^2 ~ 7/4 (0.466 cents flat)<br/>(27/25)^9 ~ 2               (0.862 cents flat)</p><p>This is really quite remarkable. The ennealimma rules!</p></div>
