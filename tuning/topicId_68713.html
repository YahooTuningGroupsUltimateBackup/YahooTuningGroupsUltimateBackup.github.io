I&apos;ve been using the ocarina patch in my<br/>just-tuned MIDI chord files, because it appears to be the purest sounding<br/>patch available, not jammed with overtones of its own. Add to that it<br/>doesn&apos;t have vibrato, at least not on my card. When I made a MIDI chord of<br/>the first 19 overtones, just tuned, the result sounded like the fundamental<br/>being played on a loud oboe. When I used only the odd overtones, it sounded<br/>like a clarinet.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>For those of you who happen to be math geeks: I believe that the concept of<br/>octave equivalence was really meant to be applied to the study of just<br/>intonation &quot;on paper&quot;. All it really refers to the concept of being free to<br/>factor 2 in and out as convenient, since the octave can be assumed to be<br/>already &quot;just&quot;. I also believe that the matter of inversion in octave<br/>equivalence depends on what you mean by an inversion. In studying just<br/>intonation, I like to think of intervals in terms of the FIRST and the<br/>SECOND note rather than the HIGHER and the LOWER note. If the first note is<br/>a C and the second note is a G, you can call it a &quot;fifth&quot; (factor of 3)<br/>without bothering about whether the G is a fourth below or a fifth above the<br/>C. Values like 3/2, 3/4, or 12/256 can be written simply as 3. However, if<br/>the second note is an F, it is considered a 4th and is a different interval<br/>as far as octave equivance is concerned, since the factor of 3 is now in the<br/>denominator.</p><p>Of course, in the actual hearing of music, octave equivalence wouldn&apos;t apply<br/>well. One can plainly hear a difference of sound quality between a<br/>well-ringable DGBF dominant 7th chord and an inversion like FGDB, which<br/>sounds weak.</p><p>Billy</p></div>
