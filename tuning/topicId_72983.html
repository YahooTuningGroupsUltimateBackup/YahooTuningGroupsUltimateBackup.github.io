It is complex and significantly symbolic and very relevant to the subsequent theories of the book.</p><p>So here is an example of a picture being used to provide information about an intellectual subject.  I would say various modern scholars are aware of the device and investigate the sources.</p><p>Further examples can be found, and a large group of speculators discuss the various engravings used in books of Freemasonry or related subjects (say Francis Bacon&apos;s New Atlantis).  Long discussions of the &apos;meaning&apos; of the picture of Shakespeare in the first Folio and its encrypted message on the &apos;true&apos; authorship&apos; can be found the the anti-Stratford corpus (see Ogburn, most notably) but that&apos;s more recent, of course.  But they take the pictures seriously and as having meaning.</p><p>One famous book has woodcuts intended to reveal the whole process of alchemy.  Attended by some text (and music) the woodcuts are crucial.</p><p>So, it is not beyond the ethos of the time to have a diagram that has information.</p><p>However, I don not know that Bach used any similar diagram anywhere else.  But remember, all too many of his original manuscripts are lost or damaged (does Volume Two have its title page?)</p><p>Bach published numerous of his works.  Has anyone examined the bindings of those works in the original?</p><p>On the contra side and this is VERY important, CPE Bach was adamant that his father was opposed to idle theoretical speculation.  He further said, he and his father were anti-Rameau (which would mean anti EQ.)</p><p>But, does being opposed to idle speculation mean that he wouldn&apos;t have had a tuning method?  Hardly.</p><p>On the other hand, the squiggles could be just that --  more information in the form of other examples (from Bach or other composers -- perhaps from his circle) would be a dream come true for this suggestion.</p><p>All best wishes,</p><p>Gordon Rumson</p><p>On 11-Sep-07, at 10:31 AM, &lt;<a href="mailto:microstick@msn.com">microstick@msn.com</a>&gt; &lt;<a href="mailto:microstick@msn.com">microstick@msn.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;    I always enjoy the squiggle debate, and I do have a question or &gt; two...ok, if the squigs are NOT a tuning, what are they?

The more ambiguous a message is,<br/>the more possible different decodings there are, the less its<br/>information content. (Bach could have been much more unambiguous, if<br/>he had been intent on communicating one specific tuning!)</p><p>Any row or circle of about twelve things can be, with enough<br/>determined ingenuity, interpreted as a tuning recipe - or indeed many<br/>different ones. I don&apos;t think it is much of a coincidence that there<br/>are about 12 squiggles - depending on how you decide to count! - a<br/>result of the size of paper and typical hand/finger motions. The rest<br/>of the &apos;information&apos; is down to the analytical and synthetic efforts<br/>of various late 20th century and early 21st century mathematicians.</p><p>&gt; used the squigs for tuning info...</p><p>In the Bach household, who would need, or could possibly use, such<br/>&apos;info&apos;? Who could Bach possibly have been trying to communicate with?<br/>The work was not published by Bach or any of his family or pupils. On<br/>the contrary, it was copied passed from hand to hand between<br/>musicians. But none of the copies have any squiggles that remotely<br/>resemble these. Why not - if they contained useful &apos;info&apos;?</p><p>The basic problem is that, historically, good tuning (in whatever<br/>musical tradition) could not have been about applying a magic formula;<br/>it required first and last using your ears in a particular and very<br/>sophisticated way, which cannot be communicated by formulae or books,<br/>only learnt by long listening experience.</p><p>People don&apos;t realise how prejudiced they are by using electronic aids<br/>that produce any number of cents they want, or calculate any ratio<br/>they feel like investigating, at the touch of a button. Whereas I<br/>would happily bet that none of the Bach family needed so much as a<br/>sheet of paper, let alone any kind of arithmetic, to be able to set a<br/>temperament. Tuning was (and is!) how you turn the pegs and what you<br/>listen for.</p><p>You can&apos;t communicate the sound of (say) a third a bit narrower or<br/>wider than 12-ET except by actually tuning it. The only possible<br/>practical way anyone could learn from Bach what the thirds should<br/>sound like was by listening directly. In this regard diagrams and<br/>formulae which were supposed to tell you the chain of fifths - without<br/>including any checks - were both useless and redundant. All competent<br/>aural tuning recipes include multiple checks of major thirds - but the<br/>squiggles don&apos;t tell you to check at all, let alone what to check for.</p><p>Having a diagram with such &apos;tuning info&apos; is no use to someone who<br/>doesn&apos;t already have extensive, strictly acoustic, experience of what<br/>does or doesn&apos;t give good results (by whoever&apos;s standards). But if<br/>Bach could already tune his harpsichord to his own taste by ear, he<br/>had no need of &apos;tuning info&apos;. If you were one of Bach&apos;s pupils, you<br/>couldn&apos;t make use of the &apos;info&apos; until you had already been taught a<br/>hell of a lot about tuning by ear by direct personal tuition. Until,<br/>in fact, you were able to tune a functionally good approximation to<br/>12-ET by ear. (The point is that most &apos;squiggle&apos; tunings require 1/6<br/>and 1/12 comma divisions to be fairly accurate... but without giving<br/>any way to check them.)</p><p>But if you were good enough to diagnose by ear and reproduce the<br/>tempering of the fifths and thirds that Bach himself used, your<br/>technique was already at the point where you DIDN&apos;T NEED cryptic<br/>diagrams telling you what to do.</p><p>In short, the supposedly encoded tuning recipe is too difficult to<br/>decode and apply for anyone who doesn&apos;t already have enough knowledge<br/>and experience to render it redundant.</p><p>In order to &apos;decode&apos; it to his own taste and satisfaction, for<br/>example, Brad already had to have been familiar with the works of<br/>Neidhardt (mostly those published after 1722), and the theoretical<br/>idea of dividing the Pythagorean comma into 6 or 12, and the technique<br/>for applying such things to an instrument. (Nowadays he likes to say<br/>one can just do it by aural guesswork - having the advantage of<br/>already knowing what the result should be!)<br/>Well, if someone had known all of that, they can invent and apply<br/>dozens of good Bach temperaments, limited only by their imagination,<br/>they don&apos;t need any squiggles.</p><p>Sparschuh is a professional mathematician, Zapf was a financial<br/>analyst, Brad had already spent hundreds of man-hours on mathematical<br/>analysis of theoretical temperaments, and so on.

Various<br/>factors will combine to cause some quakes outside the circles to be<br/>detected, and others within the circles to be missed... &quot;<br/><a href="http://psn.quake.net/lehmntxt.html">http://psn.quake.net/lehmntxt.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.seismicnet.com/lehman.html">http://www.seismicnet.com/lehman.html</a><br/>so far about alleged &quot;Rosetta-Stone&quot;d tuning-circles claims.</p><p>But joke/hoax aside:<br/>Here an more scholar controversy about that among musicologists:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/BachCantatas/message/25111">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/BachCantatas/message/25111</a><br/>&quot;A<br/>Bach temperament: a possible Rosetta Stone?&quot; rather<br/>than the one the editors (peer group) allowed to slip<br/>through without criticism since there were other<br/>previous &apos;Bach&apos; temperaments quite similar to yours<br/>and one or more of them even based upon the very same<br/>Bach squiggles on the WTC1 title page that you have<br/>attempted to interpret? There is nothing here to alert<br/>or warn the reader that this is simply one out of a<br/>number of similar hypotheses that have been propounded<br/>in recent years.</p><p>The following claim is made as a fact later on without<br/>any footnote or parenthetic explanation:</p><p>&quot;Bach&apos;s WTC title-page...is a precise abstraction of<br/>his preferred tuning method, in the form of a pen<br/>stroke with 11 large loops.&quot;</p><p>This has led directly to other authors like Ross W.<br/>Duffin in his book, &quot;How Equal Temperament Ruined<br/>Harmony&quot; Norton, 2007, p. 148, to claim: &quot;There is no<br/>question that Lehman convincingly solved Bach&apos;s<br/>puzzle....In fact, the &quot;sample&quot; irregular temperament<br/>given back in figure 7 is Bach&apos;s own &quot;well<br/>temperament&quot; as deciphered by Lehman. This was Bach&apos;s<br/>ideal for keyboard music, not ET [Equal Temperament].&quot;</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/BachCantatas/message/25115">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/BachCantatas/message/25115</a></p><p>Nevertheless, just the same is up to you:<br/>have a lot of fun in inventing your&apos;s own private version(s)<br/>A.S.</p></div>
