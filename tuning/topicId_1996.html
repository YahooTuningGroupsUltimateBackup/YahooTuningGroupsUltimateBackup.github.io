If you are not satisfied,<br/>I will be happy to refund the unused portion of your membership, assuming<br/>you are actually a current member.</p><p>If you wish to increase the frequency of 1/1 publication, submit an article<br/>(assuming you have something to say and the writing skills to say it<br/>clearly). Or volunteer to do something else to expedite the process. You<br/>will not make the next issue come out one second sooner by carping at me.<br/>All of our promotional literature for the last several years has stated<br/>clearly that 1/1&apos;s publication schedule is irregular--if you didn&apos;t read it<br/>or didn&apos;t believe it, that&apos;s not my fault.</p><p>BTW, neither Henry nor Carola, who cofounded the JIN and 1/1 with me back in<br/>1984 and shared equally in the work for the first several years, has been<br/>involved in the production of 1/1 for the last three or four years. Henry<br/>continues to support the network by providing space free of charge and<br/>lending the services of his admistrative assistant, who handles store orders<br/>and other administrative tasks. All other work is performed by me.</p><p>I will gladly turn the editorship of 1/1 over to anyone who can demonstrate<br/>the competence and committment to do a better job than I am currently doing.<br/>I suspect, however, that few will find the salary appealing.</p><p>--DBD<br/>==========================================================================<br/>David B.
