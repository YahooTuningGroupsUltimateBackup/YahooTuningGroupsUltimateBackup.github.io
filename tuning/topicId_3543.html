I would like to contribute to this discussion, because it happen to<br/>arise at just the right time . . .</p><p>Dante Rosati wrote,</p><p>&gt;Theres no doubt that,  with two sine tones,  the dissonance action around<br/>&gt;1/1 is also heard in an attenuated form around 2/1. The same effect is also<br/>&gt;happening around 3/2. Theres more going on, but it needs more listens. I<br/>&gt;also noticed that my ear can hear/conceptualize  (with the pure sine tones)<br/>&gt;stable intervals that  &quot;change quantum state&quot;  to the next important<br/>&gt;ratio/scale step.  I have to listen to it a few hundred more times... (one<br/>&gt;of the quintessential &quot;tone mandalas&quot;, I&apos;d say)</p><p>In another one of those crazy coincidences, I just e-mailed Dante to tell<br/>him he should look into Sethares&apos; _TTSS_ and the Plomp-Levelt consonance<br/>curves, and the next thing I know other people start talking about them on<br/>the list!</p><p>I have two comments:</p><p>1. There are a wide variety of phenomena that are not fully understood in<br/>connection with these phenomena. There appear to be varieties of beating and<br/>of combination tones that happen not in the ear (the way normal beating and<br/>non-equipment-based combination tones arise) but instead in the brain. These<br/>effects interact with the ear-based effects in ways that are not accounted<br/>for by quantitative models. Read Reiner Plomp, _Aspects of Tone Sensation_<br/>for the nitty-gritty dirt. A lot of these phenomena are covered in Juan<br/>Roederer&apos;s _Physics and Psychophysics of Music_ with excellent illustrations<br/>(including the waveform diagrams one poster described, along with a<br/>discussion of their relevance and irrelevance to the perceived sound), but<br/>the material is presented in too organized a fashion to address the all the<br/>confusing results Plomp found (by the time Plomp wrote his book; the early<br/>studies for which he is famous are but a small piece of the puzzle).</p><p>2. Either of these books will tell you about the virtual pitch phenomemon.<br/>Quite distinct from the difference-tone phenomenon (as experiments have<br/>demonstrated -- see the books or, better yet, the original papers to which<br/>they refer such as Goldstein&apos;s), virtual pitch represents the brain&apos;s<br/>attempt to fit a fundamental to a set of sine waves. One actually hears the<br/>virtual pitch -- or even several if the set of sine waves does not closely<br/>approximate the proportions of lower members of harmonic series. If we<br/>interpret the &quot;salience&quot; of these several possibilities as probabilities,<br/>one can calculate an entropy measure to describe how simple the virtual<br/>pitch sensation is. This is what I call &quot;harmonic entropy&quot;. Harmonic entropy<br/>is a component of dissonance missed by Sethares, but musically very<br/>important. It is there for sine waves, but complex tones provide the<br/>auditory system with more clues (such as upper partials in the frequency<br/>range where the ear is most accurate at calculating virtual pitch) as to<br/>what the frequency ratios might be. Sethares would predict that otonal and<br/>utonal chords (harmonic-series-based and &quot;subharmonic series&quot;-based chords<br/>have about the same dissonance (whether you use just sine waves or full<br/>complex tones), but in a certain sense the otonal chords (especially the<br/>higher-limit ones) are much more consonant, and the harmonic entropy concept<br/>explains this (think about it). Joe Monzo has collected my thoughts on<br/>harmonic entropy and a few graphs into his commentary-rich page at<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Erlich/index.htm">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Erlich/index.htm</a>.</p></div>
