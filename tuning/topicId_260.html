I&apos;m still laughing about the  &quot;lets rumble theory wanks.&quot; You<br/>have the gift of gab, and it truly is a gift.  You also are a darned<br/>good teacher and I am learning a lot.</p><p>But like any gift it can be used constructively or destructively.<br/>WHen you attack others I cringe.  Your words are caustic swords (and<br/>I am very glad to be on your good side).  Joe is a human being.  Very<br/>few people, if any, can be attacked without getting defensive.  And<br/>once the defenses come out you lose the opportunity for dialogue.<br/>Its becomes another dreary demeaning testosteronic crusade, and you<br/>know where the crusades got us.</p><p>Would it be possible for you to learn to take that tremendous<br/>creative outlfow and learn to coach others.  To debate without<br/>seeking to demolish.  To educate and uplift without resorting to<br/>calling Joe a cockroach?</p><p>This may all be very naive of me.  But in the same way you exhort us<br/>all to make more music, could we exhort you to work harder at<br/>interpersonal harmony. Then we could all keep on learning from each<br/>other instead of demonstrating again and again how easy it is for<br/>egos to fight.</p><p>Peace<br/>Mary</p></div>
