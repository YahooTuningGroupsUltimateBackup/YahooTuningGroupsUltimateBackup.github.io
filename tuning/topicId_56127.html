But thanks to the<br/>programming genius of such commendable persons as de Coul and Walker,<br/>I have had a wonderful time experimenting with exotic temperaments I<br/>never knew of before.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, the problem I&apos;m dealing with as I write my Ph.D. dissertation<br/>concerns a wholesome approach for the construction of a microtonal<br/>notation standard, meant to embody both the traditional Western, and<br/>Eastern Musics.</p><p>You&apos;re a man after my own heart!  I have been working on the problem<br/>of microtonal notation for many, many years, and I also came here in<br/>January 2002 with what I thought was a rather ambitious proposal for<br/>microtonal notation.  I quickly found out, not only that some found<br/>my ideas a bit radical, but also that there were many tunings that<br/>others wanted to use for which my notation was, unfortunately, very<br/>inadequate.</p><p>For the past 3 years Dave Keenan and I have been working on a project<br/>in which we have developed my modest proposals into a comprehensive<br/>microtonal notation (called &quot;Sagittal&quot;, after its employment of<br/>numerous arrowlike symbols) that may be used for virtually any<br/>tuning.  Although you may already have seen this in Scala, you can<br/>find more complete information on the Sagittal website:</p><p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/</a></p><p>Our formal documentation for the notation is in the &quot;Xenharmonikon<br/>article&quot; (in pdf format), but a more gentle (and definitely more<br/>entertaining) introduction may be found in the (not yet<br/>completed) &quot;mythical introduction&quot; (Dave&apos;s label, although I must<br/>insist that the account, though very entertaining, is completely<br/>true!).</p><p>&gt; In very crude terms, you might glean an insight from the figure on<br/>page 13 of my doctorate report which you can download at<br/><a href="http://www.musiki.org/">http://www.musiki.org/</a> (sorry that most of you cannot read Turkish)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; According to this figure, barring the macrotonal accidentals dubbed<br/>3/4 and 7/8 tones respectively, one can traverse the entire octave in<br/>41 steps using only the accidentals with the values of 1/8, 1/4 and<br/>1/2 tones. 12 of these are familiar to you, since you recognize them<br/>as western tones with proper western accidentals. The rest are my<br/>suggestions and corrections for the transcription of Maqam Music.</p><p>You have made very effective use of new symbols, particularly with<br/>the fractional sharps.  However, you may be unaware that some of your<br/>symbols (specifically, the ones you are using for 1/8-tone up and<br/>down, and 7/8-tone up) are already well established symbols for 1/4-<br/>and 3/4-tone, respectively, and you may want to consider revising<br/>your system of notation in light of this.  (Alas, we find that many<br/>of our good ideas were discovered long ago.)  Please see Figure 1 of<br/>our Xenharmonikon article, which shows the Tartini/Couper notation:</p><p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf</a></p><p>This figure also appears in Episode 1 of the mythology (about 3/7 of<br/>the way through):</p><p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/gift/Episode1.htm">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/gift/Episode1.htm</a></p><p>You correctly identify the apotome (the amount of alteration<br/>represented by a sharp or flat symbol alteration) as 4 degrees in the<br/>41-division of the octave, but then the double-sharp and double-flat<br/>symbols must correspond to 8 degrees, not 7.</p><p>The Sagittal symbols used for the 41 division are shown in Figure 8<br/>of our XH article (about halfway down the page), and an even better<br/>(more complete) illustration is given in the mythology (in Episode 2,<br/>about 2/3 of the way through:</p><p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/gift/Episode2.htm">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/gift/Episode2.htm</a></p><p>These are shown in &quot;pure Sagittal&quot; form; however, the notation also<br/>has a mixed-symbol option that retains conventional sharp and flat<br/>symbols, as explained in both the article and especially the<br/>mythology (which explains the background and philosophy of the<br/>notation in greater detail).</p><p>To see this in Scala, enter the following commands:</p><p>equal 41 (sets tuning to 41-equal division)<br/>set notation sa41<br/>set sagittal mixed (to see the mixed-symbol option)<br/>set sagittal pure (to return to the pure-symbol option, the default)</p><p>Since the 1/4-apotome degrees in your diagram are clearly not equal<br/>in size, you will probably want to load a .scl file with your<br/>preferred tuning.</p><p>I hope that this information will be both helpful and enlightening.</p><p>Best,</p><p>--George Secor</p></div><h3><a id=56180 href="#56180">ðŸ”—</a>Mark Rankin &#x3C;markrankin95511@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2004 5:29:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ozan,</p><p>First of all, welcome to the tuning list!

You really flatter me with your refreshing compliments. That is all the more gratifying since they come from a man of letters such as yourself. It is thanks to my life-long Anglophonic disposition that I can master the English language rather well. Like most things though, my colloquial acquisition is autodidactic. However, I&apos;m still an amateur speaker compared to most of you, especially with tuning jargons that I have been missing for the past decade.</p><p>Nevertheless, I feel pretty much at home here among all the microtonalist enthusiasts and professionals, which brings us to our mutual discourse:</p><p>I do not think that the concept of 1/8 (or its mirror image 7/8) tone is a unique proposition of mine. I believe I have seen it somewhere else before, but I cannot quite recall. In any case, you are right about these being crude denominations which stand for the intervallic difference signifying an average of all known commas. 1/8 tone is indeed a &grave;tempered comma&grave; as far as tempered goes. I believe this to be a feasible way of teaching regular musicians such as myself just how to sound the right pitch prior to knowing what a comma is.</p><p>As to my name, the english equivalent for Ozan would be minstrel, meistersinger or bard. I prefer that you consider me as an anachronistic travelling shaman musician from inland Asia. That&apos;s pretty wild for a four letter name, is it not? Truly, I think I have attributes that justify my being referred to that way.</p><p>All in all, I am appreciative of the fact that you have witnessed the rural situation of Turkey by 1969. As far as I remember, that was the date when domestic strife reached critical proportions and the blathering politicians who ruined the nation&apos;s agricultural economy caused the hapless peasants to migrate to urban areas in search for higher incomes. A great many classical Turkish comedy films and the birth of Arabesque music is linked to the mayhem that resulted. I sure hope your journey was devoid of political mischief. ;)</p><p>Yes, Allah is Sublime, and I do believe you have read the Quran, have you not?</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan Yarman</p><p>--------------------------------</p><p>Ozan,</p><p>First of all, welcome to the tuning list!
