German theorist and<br/>composer. After early training at Altdorf and Wittenberg, Neidhardt<br/>matriculated as a theology student at Jena, where he produced his<br/>first treatise on temperament and apparently continued his musical<br/>training. It is likely that he studied with the university organist,<br/>J.N. Bach, who knew him well enough to allow him to try one of his<br/>temperaments on the new organ at the city&apos;s central church; Bach&apos;s<br/>tuning, however, was found more singable.&quot;</p><p>JSB called him &quot;senoir&quot; of the Bach-family-clan:<br/><a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Nikolaus_Bach_%28Komponist%29">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Nikolaus_Bach_%28Komponist%29</a><br/>&quot;Johann Nikolaus Bach (* 10. Oktober 1669 in Eisenach, Â† 4. November<br/>1753 in Jena)&quot; even suvived his  nephew JSB over 9 years.<br/>As instrument builder in the clan he was also<br/>authority in questions of tuning:</p><p>&gt;<br/><a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/Lehman_Bach_Neidhardt.txt">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/Lehman_Bach_Neidhardt.txt</a><br/>&quot;In his article (_Early Music_, February 2005, p. 15), Lehman<br/>tells the story of a contest to tune an organ in &quot;absolutely<br/>equal temperament&quot; in which Neidhardt, using a mathematically<br/>prepared monochord, was bested by his young colleague Nikolaus<br/>Bach &quot;setting his set of 8&apos; flutes entirely by ear.&quot; He suspects<br/>that Neidhardt &quot;did achieve equal temperament or something<br/>indistinguishably close to it,&quot; while Bach sought and attained a<br/>temperament that &quot;&apos;_seems_ equal&apos;&quot; (Lehman&apos;s emphasis) to &quot;all but<br/>the most finicky keyboard geeks, but is more musically pleasing.&quot;</p><p>Sorry Brad,<br/>but that was completely wrong &grave;suspceted&grave;!,<br/>because the term more &apos;singable&apos; meant in the coeval Baroque<br/>period still an clear distiction inbetween the JI ratios of:</p><p>C 10:9 D 9:8 E 16:15 F 9:8 G 10:9 A 9:8 Bb 16:15 C&apos;</p><p>That contains 2 clearly discernabele whole-tone steps:</p><p>1. Pythagorean &apos;major-tone&apos; of ratio: 9:8 ~204Cents<br/>2. Syntonic &apos;minor-tone&apos; of ratio: 10:9 ~182Cents</p><p>hence coeval singer expected in C-major related keys<br/>for C-E and G-A even less than an meantone-step: ~193Cents,<br/>when singing in keys near C-major.</p><p>That discerning of the both versions of an tone survied<br/>even the classical period in terms of Kirnberger2,<br/>with D-E &amp; G-A even exactly matching 10:9.<br/>That quality was lost not until the romantic-period,<br/>when the formerly strings in the instruments became stonger and<br/>stronger. That change in arising the diameter of strings,<br/>followed an fit in tuning nearer to somehow ET approximations,<br/>as we do have still in todays intruments.</p><p>Werckmeister III satisfies<br/>J.N. Bachs&apos;s &apos;singable&apos;-condition<br/>of having for C-D &amp; G-A  whole-tones<br/>less than an meantone step of: ~193Cents.</p><p>but Neidhard approximates in all his  proposals barely<br/>his own preference:<br/>Pythagorean &apos;major-tone&apos;s of 9:8 everywhere allover the scale,<br/>so that the members of Jena&apos;s choir-singers had no orientation,<br/>when expecting Syntonic minor-tones at the usual positions.</p><p>Neidhardt&apos;s oversimlification simply<br/>neglects the demanded difference inbetween<br/>major(9:8)- versus minor(10:9)-tones in JI.<br/>as awaited by the Jena-singers inbetween C-D &amp; G-A,<br/>even lower than in old meantonics.</p><p>Hence -no wonder- Neidhardt lost the tuning-competition vs. JNB<br/>so embarassing in an disappointing fiasco at his Jena-debacle.</p><p>He got simply to near to ET in order to pass the examination<br/>of the singer&apos;s jury, which anticipated something nearer to JI.</p><p>Cnclusion for modern HIPerformance for music of the Bach-family:</p><p>It&apos;s no good idea to follow the inferior Neidhardt in his attempts,<br/>when speculating about new remakes again of<br/>so called alleged modern &quot;Bach-tunings&quot;.</p><p>Sorry Brad, concerning yours wishful-thinking<br/>you simply choosed an inapt candidate,<br/>when betting on the wrong horse<br/>in matters of &quot;squiggles&quot; allegations.</p><p>Recommendation:<br/>Plaese rethink that matter once more over again,<br/>before republishing such &quot;wishful-thinking&quot; anew.</p><p>Yours regretfully<br/>A.S.</p></div>
