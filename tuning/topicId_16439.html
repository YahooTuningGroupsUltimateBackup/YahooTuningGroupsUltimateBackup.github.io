What is it that bothers you about it?</p><p>Well,</p><p>&quot;Diana Deutsch and her colleagues have conducted many studies of how<br/>people perceive the 12 tritone pairs. Since this interval is maximally<br/>ambiguous in terms of pitch proximity, one could expect subjects to be<br/>able to hear it both ways. That is, sometimes they could hear it as<br/>ascending, other times as descending. Surprisingly, Dr. Deutsch found<br/>that for some of the tritone pairs, there is very little ambiguity in<br/>how they are heard. A subject will almost always hear them as ascending,<br/>or descending, but not both ways. Other tritone pairs can easily be<br/>perceived both ways.&quot;</p><p>Okay.  But then,</p><p>&quot;The pairs with little ambiguity tend to have their first tones in the<br/>pair on opposite sides of the chroma circle. Those that can be heard both<br/>ways are found in between. If you were to envision the 12 chromatic<br/>pitches in series as the numbers on the face of a clock, pairs in which<br/>the first member is in the upper half of the clock will result in more<br/>descending perceptions, and those in the bottom with more ascending<br/>perceptions. Pitch classes at the top or bottom of &quot;the clock&quot; are the<br/>least ambiguous. This can be seen in the figure below which represents the<br/>proportion of times each interval pair is heard as descending for a<br/>hypothetical subject.&quot;</p><p>?

The WX series is very much oriented<br/>towards saxophone players, but there are enough &quot;training wheels&quot; that I<br/>can play it and make reasonable sound while I&apos;m learning the &quot;expressive&quot;<br/>stuff.

Edward Borasky &#x3C;znmeb@teleport.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2000 8:09:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To continue the thread I started earlier, I&apos;d like to get everyone&apos;s ideas<br/>on the requirements and the niceties for a microtonal synthesizer. Let me<br/>start the ball rolling with an expanded list from my earlier version:</p><p>1. MIDI: A synthesizer that doesn&apos;t use General MIDI (GM) standard is<br/>unlikely to succeed. Therefore, all components and modules must conform to<br/>the GM standard.</p><p>2. Given that, let&apos;s look at controllers. The most common controllers these<br/>days are keyboards, guitar converters, wind controllers and position-sensing<br/>wands like the Buchla &quot;Lightning&quot;. Sadly, continuous controllers seem to<br/>have died out. I would say that the controllers of today are probably<br/>adequate for microtonal music ... someone correct me if I&apos;m way off base<br/>here. As I mentioned earlier, a re-configurable two-dimensional keyboard is<br/>probably also a requirement. At least one such (frightfully expensive)<br/>keyboard does exist.</p><p>3. Now let&apos;s look at the tone generator. The key here is that it has to be<br/>real-time -- whatever complexities of the tone generation, it has to<br/>generate two (stereo) samples of at least 16 bits at a rate of at least<br/>44.1K samples per second, and more bits, more channels and more samples per<br/>second is better. I think you can *almost* do this (track a moderately<br/>polyphonic MIDI stream and generate CD-quality sound) on a fast PowerMac or<br/>Pentium in CSound, although Barry Vercoe, the father of CSound, works with<br/>Analog Devices digital signal processing chips attached by some kind of<br/>interface. For details of Barry Vercoe&apos;s setup, see the CD-ROM that comes<br/>with &quot;The CSound Book&quot;; look for &quot;Extended CSound&quot;.</p><p>Rather than CSound, I would work in SAOL. The main difference, aside from<br/>the better readability of SAOL code over CSound code, is that SAOL<br/>processing is floating point throughout. This means that 32-bit floating<br/>point DSP chips are required.</p><p>4. Given that musicians are not always programmers, mathematicians or<br/>physicists, the underlying low-level programming details must be hidden from<br/>composers and performers with a modern graphcial user interface that runs on<br/>Windows, Macintosh and Linux.</p><p>5. Finally, the usual statements about ruggedness must not be overlooked. If<br/>this thing is gonna sell, it has to be rugged enough to withstand being<br/>dropped off a truck by a roadie on mind-altering substances and still be<br/>playable by the fabulously famous and wealthy rock star at the concert that<br/>evening. :-)<br/>--<br/>M.

That made it possible to fake a pedal steel guitar<br/>and certain blues guitar licks (very badly!).

My fantasy<br/>continues that I would like to try to have a simple primary ratio<br/>tuning running through the middle of a MicroZone, and have degrees of<br/>augmented and flattened intervals physically above and below this<br/>middle scale. Something such as this would likely accommodate many<br/>variant tunings for each pitch class. Of course I would attempt to<br/>devise systems that would somehow subset large and unwieldy tunings,<br/>to make them more playable.</p><p>I like dreamin&apos;!,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=16592 href="#16592">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2000 8:21:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, 13 Dec 2000 12:40:03 -0800 (PST), &lt;<a href="mailto:znmeb@teleport.com">znmeb@teleport.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;Now ... suppose some genius (like me :-) were to design a synthesizer for<br/>&gt;microtonalists. What would be the *requirements*? What would be the<br/>&gt;*niceties*? I can think of a few:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1. Scala interface to the pitch generation scheme<br/>&gt;2. A reconfigurable keyboard<br/>&gt;3. On-the-fly computation of &quot;goodness&quot; measures like harmonic entropy and<br/>&gt;Sethares&apos; dissonance meter<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And what would be the business case you would make to, say, Yamaha, when<br/>&gt;you had a prototype built and had all the patent searches done and went to<br/>&gt;them to try and sell it??</p><p>At the minimum, each note needs to be retunable to any pitch (rather than a<br/>12-note repeating scheme or a limited range of retuning for each note). The<br/>accuracy should be good enough to represent desired scales accurately (at<br/>least 1 cent accuracy). Variations in timbre should be tied to pitch rather<br/>than MIDI note number (scales deviating very far from 12-TET on the DX7II<br/>can have strange timbral effects because it alters the timbre based on MIDI<br/>note number). The ability to quickly change between scales would be handy<br/>(for example, changing the number of sharps and flats in a meantone<br/>tuning). It also needs a MIDI controller that&apos;s capable of handling<br/>microtonal needs. Split keys for distinct sharps and flats, or something<br/>like Harry Partch&apos;s Old Chromelodeon II keyboard with extra keys above and<br/>below the regular keyboard, or a set of pedals like an orchestral harp has<br/>to raise and lower the pitch of particular notes, or even just a simple<br/>lever as in a chromatic harmonica, would be useful for scales with more<br/>than 12 notes per octave, if it would be more economical than a fully<br/>generalized keyboard. The limitation of the 12-note octave keyboard is<br/>probably the biggest obstacle to easily being able to play microtonal music<br/>on a synthesizer.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3><a id=16602 href="#16602">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2000 6:19:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &quot;M.
