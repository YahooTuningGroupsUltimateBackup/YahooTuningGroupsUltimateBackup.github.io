If anyone is interested in the program but has problems with<br/>WinZip files and/or web access, let me know and we can investigate<br/>alternative delivery methods.  :-)</p><p>BTW, I&apos;ve released the code free under the GNU General Public License.<br/>If anyone has suggestions for improvement, finds errors in the code,<br/>etc., let me know and I will be happy to update it.  I compiled the C<br/>source under Microsoft&apos;s C compiler, but it&apos;s a text-based program, so<br/>it should be easy to port it to other compilers and operating systems.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p></div>
