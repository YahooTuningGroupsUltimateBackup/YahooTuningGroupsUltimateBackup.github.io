And, there&apos;s the scary part<br/>about this whole series, and our current state of musical affairs in<br/>general...the creative and innovative is a very teensy part of people&apos;s<br/>mindset right now, and judging by the result of the election, it isn&apos;t<br/>getting better soon.

Should especially be read by non-jazz-musicians who are<br/>watching Burns&apos; show.</p><p>Roberta Piket</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: David Liebman<br/>Sent: Wednesday, January 17, 2001 8:21 PM<br/>Subject: more on burns</p><p>I think this guy wrote good on the thing-funny too-he mentions me but<br/>disregard that and check it out-good sax player from west coast-mike zilber</p><p>enjoy</p><p>J&apos;ACCUSE,  BURNS and MARSALIS - or - KEN AND WYNTON&apos;S BIG LIE</p><p>O.K., maybe the stakes aren&apos;t as high as in the Dreyfuss affair, and Emile<br/>Zola I ain&apos;t (though we share a consonant or two), but to those of us who<br/>care passionately about jazz, Ken Burns has committed cultural perjury.<br/>Aided and abetted by his amanuensis, Wynton Marsalis, Burns is fobbing off on<br/>the American public a series that is part hagiography, part-Reaganesque<br/>faux-nostalgia and, when it comes to the last 40 years, largely a lie of<br/>omission and commission.</p><p>            Let me ask you a question.   What would you think of a series on<br/>American presidents that spent 18 hours on presidents before Teddy Roosevelt<br/>and 2 hours on presidents from TR on?   Well, in Jazz, Burns creates<br/>essentially the same ratio.  He spends 18 hours on the music before 1961 and<br/>TWO hours on the music after that.   To go back to our presidential analogy,<br/>a similarly styled Burns documentary on our leaders would have spent as much<br/>time on Grover Cleveland, Millard Fillmore and James Buchanan as on TR,<br/>Wilson, FDR, Eisenhower, Kennedy, LBJ, Nixon, Reagan and Clinton combined.<br/>Would YOU think such a series gave a fair representation of presidential<br/>history.   And what if, within that miniscule two hour segment on everyone<br/>from TR to Bill Clinton, Burns asserted that nothing of significance happened<br/>after Wilson until the second term of Ronald Reagan!   You might think that<br/>maybe, just perhaps, some interesting history from FDR through Richard Nixon<br/>was left out (so they could fit in more on George Washington, perhaps.)</p><p>            Can I be clear here?   Burns has done a tremendous service in<br/>some of his early historical footage and background.  If he had made a<br/>documentary entitled jazz until 1960, I would have had little complaint with<br/>him.  If he&apos;d entitled his documentary  Everything I didn&apos;t know about jazz<br/>until Wynton told me, I&apos;d be fine with that, but Burns does a tremendous<br/>educational and historical disservice to the music on a level with, say,<br/>making a film about the entire civil war that ended with Lincoln&apos;s<br/>emancipation proclamation in January of 1963.</p><p>            A little background is in order..   Jazz went through an<br/>astounding period of ferment, turmoil and upheaval in the 1960s and 1970s,<br/>much like the rest of the country.   Longstanding precepts were challenged,<br/>transformed or simply chucked.   Much incandescent music resulted, along was<br/>some truly horrible sonic abortions.  (As an example of the latter, I believe<br/>the fifth circle of Hell is reserved for uninterrupted listenings to Anthony<br/>Braxton&apos;s solo double album, For Alto)   The 1970s featured Miles&apos; ex-sidemen<br/>creating a staggering mix of jazz, funk, rock, free and Latin influences in<br/>such seminal bands as Weather Report, Mahavishnu, Headhunters, Light as a<br/>Feather, Lookout Farm.  To paraphrase Marty Kahn, this fierce and brilliant<br/>fusion had about as much to do with today&apos;s corporate smooth jazz as Orson<br/>Welles&apos; Citizen Kane had to do with Welles&apos; commercials for Ernst and Julio<br/>Gallo.</p><p>            By the beginning of the 1980s, cultural retrenchment was rampant<br/>everywhere, from our pre-senile ex-actor President to Bill Cosby&apos;s<br/>Politically correct update of Father Knows Best.   It was sadly fitting that<br/>the decade of unfettered avarice and reaction was brought in by the<br/>assassination of John Lennon, only a month and a half before the giddy Gipper<br/>took office.</p><p>            Wynton Marsalis burst on the scene in the early 80s, a young,<br/>cocksure trumpet phenom hailing from the cradle of jazz, New Orleans.<br/>Filled with brash pyrotechnics, tremendous mimicry skills of those who had<br/>come before and an almost unprecedented ability to switch between the<br/>classical and jazz worlds, Marsalis took the critical and corporate jazz<br/>world by tsunami.   Initially, Wynton mined the fertile fields of mid-60s<br/>Miles, with brother Branford doing a credible Wayne Shorter to his brother&apos;s<br/>prince of darkness, Kenny Kirkland tearing it up ala Herbie Hancock on the<br/>piano and the raging Tain Watts doing a Tony Williams/Elvin/Tain thing.<br/>This initial group remains Wynton&apos;s best group by far, and it is no accident<br/>that the music the group created came before Wynton fell under the influence<br/>of two profoundly conservative African-American music critics, Stanley Crouch<br/>and Albert Murray.</p><p>            Stanley Crouch, the David Horowitz of jazz criticism, was<br/>initially a fervent apostle of the new free thing.  Grandly declaiming David<br/>Murray as the next Coltrane, Crouch, a failed FREE jazz drummer (Migod, how<br/>do you fail at FREE jazz drumming?) eventually changed his politics somewhere<br/>in the mid-80s and began retrenching further and further back into the mists<br/>of jazz time.  Now Crouch has no truck with music stylistically after.gee,<br/>1960, the time when Ken Burns asserts that jazz lost its way.  (Is a pattern<br/>emerging?)</p><p>            Crouch&apos;s  partner in the education of Eliza Marsalis Doolittle<br/>was Albert Murray.  A cultural historian specializing in the blues, Murray<br/>had superb knowledge of the early blues musicians all the way through the KC<br/>territory bands of the late 1930s.   Unfortunately, he also developed a<br/>powerful formalist ideology wherein jazz was essentially a blues-based music.<br/>  This is utterly inaccurate as history.  I don&apos;t have time to delineate all<br/>of the non-blues cultural currents which made up and continue to inform jazz,<br/>from Cuba to Europe to Ragtime to Brass bands, so if you want a brilliant and<br/>detailed refutation of Murray&apos;s thesis, read Dick Sudhalter&apos;s essay in the NY<br/>Times a couple of years back.  Suffice it to say, claiming that jazz is<br/>essentially a blues-based music is like saying that Paella is basically a<br/>shrimp dish.</p><p>            Under the tutelage of Crouch and Murray, Marsalis became<br/>increasingly dogmatic that the real jazz was pre-fusion, then pre-modal, then<br/>pre-bop, and now Louis Armstrong is about as modern as Wynton likes to<br/>venture.  Marsalis is now the Ronald Reagan of jazz, and like Reagan, has no<br/>memory of those nasty 60s and 70s, preferring to bask in the halcyon days of<br/>Roseland, Satchmo and wax recordings.  &quot;Well, here we go again.&quot;</p><p>            That is certainly his prerogative, but in his drive to museumize<br/>the music, Marsalis has gained some powerful allies and his actions have far<br/>reaching consequences for the art form.  He heads Jazz at Lincoln Center, an<br/>organization dedicated mainly to repertory of the 1920s-1950s, is by far the<br/>most recognized and quoted jazz musician among the mainstream media, and now,<br/>through the unholy alliance with Burns, has put his hand into rewriting the<br/>history of jazz to write out all of the advances of the 1960s and 1970s.   He<br/>and Burns are guilty of historical malpractice.</p><p>            I have a cheap little psychoanalytic theory about Wynton, based<br/>on nothing more than idle speculation.   I remember seeing him blaze through<br/>town when I was a student at New England in 1981.  He and I are the same age<br/>and I recall being astounded by his trumpet playing with Blakey.  Free, cocky<br/>and utterly unselfconscious, Marsalis dazzled the room.   We all went home<br/>buzzing about the young man who had played trumpet with an unparalleled<br/>authority and joy - dipping freely into everyone from Clark Terry to mid-60s<br/>Miles to Woody Shaw to Freddie Hubbard.   We were convinced that anyone who<br/>had so brilliantly assimilated all of these styles and more at such a young<br/>age would surely, as soon as he found his own voice, reinvent the jazz canon.<br/> It was only a matter of time.</p><p>            By the next time I heard Wynton, five years later at the Village<br/>Vanguard, I was deeply immersed in the NYC jazz scene.  Playing  and gigging<br/>with such folks as Wayne Krantz, Drew Gress, Ben Monder Jimmy Earl, Mark<br/>Feldman, Dave Kikoski, Bruce Barth, Ed Schuller  and John Riley among others,<br/>I had a pretty good sense of what my generation was looking into musically.<br/>I eagerly anticipated what Wynton would have to show us.  Maybe he would lead<br/>the way - shine a light, so to speak.   Instead, we were subjected to a<br/>stiff, careful and utterly regressive display of neo-conservative soloing<br/>starkly at odds with the joyful and unscripted music Marsalis had been<br/>delivering only a few years before.  Marsalis has continued on his ever more<br/>regressive musical journey. At last report, the trumpet terror is channeling<br/>Gottschalk and is seriously advocating going back to the old megaphone style<br/>of recording, since it is a more authentic approach than those nasty<br/>electronic microphones. (I&apos;m not kidding, he said that!)</p><p>            So here&apos;s my theory:   Wynton, a truly smart man, with gifted<br/>ears and powerful instincts, KNEW that he had nothing new to say, that he was<br/>only a brilliant mimic.   He was not , to paraphrase Gil Evans, a sound<br/>innovator.  Knowing this, Wynton, in a position of influence and power<br/>unparalleled in jazz, chose to redo the rules of the game.   If he couldn&apos;t<br/>move the music past the innovations of early 60s Miles, he would reject ALL<br/>jazz after that as fraudulent, either cacophonous garbage or cynical<br/>commercial sellout.  Wynton, as jazz pope of the retro-crowd, released<br/>infallible papal bull (in both senses of the word) after papal bull:  All<br/>electric jazz is cynical commercial pandering.   Free jazz is<br/>pseudo-intellectual claptrap and so on and so on.   Each pronouncement from<br/>Marsalis and approving amen from Crouch, Murray, et al. was designed to<br/>insulate him from the awful truth:    He had nothing new to say in the art<br/>form he loved.</p><p>            Now, through his mouthpiece Burns, he has found an unfettered<br/>worldwide audience to spread his big lie about jazz after 1960.</p><p>The hills are alive, with the sound of.Buddy?</p><p>Let&apos;s start at the very beginning, a very good place to start.   First off,<br/>I&apos;d like to dispense with the point that in actuality, Burns spent 18 hours<br/>on 100 years and 2 hours on 40 years  .I&apos;ll grant that the years 1863 to 1917<br/>are all intrinsic in helping build the stew known as jazz and worth two hours<br/>of precious time IF the remaining periods are treated equitably.   But the<br/>relevant numbers here are 16, 42, 2 and 39.  16 is the number of hours Burns<br/>spends on the 42 years between 1917 and 1960 and 2 is the number of hours<br/>Burns takes for the 39 years between 1961 and 2000.    Even the years 1917 to<br/>1924 are arguably not worth the two hours spent on them here.   Jelly Roll<br/>Morton and Armstrong, viewed as the two key figures in early recorded jazz,<br/>didn&apos;t press wax until 1925</p><p>1)         Jazz is viewed as a soloist&apos;s art form.  Why?   Thanks to Louis<br/>Armstrong and others who broke free of the collective front line born in the<br/>marching bands of New Orleans.   Prior to 1925, with the possible exception<br/>of Sidney Bechet, individuals were not coming out from the front line.<br/>Armstrong&apos;s creative powers and stunning virtuosity were so compelling that<br/>most historians (and this is one of the things that Reverend Marsalis and I<br/>agree on) credit him with virtually singlehandedly creating the idea of the<br/>jazz solo virtuoso.   That happened around 1925, as did Jelly Roll Morton&apos;s<br/>(the first great jazz composer) first recordings, so I contend that jazz, as<br/>a vehicle for extemporaneous solo creation dates from then, specifically the<br/>Hot Five recordings of Armstrong and the exquisite solos of Bix Beiderbecke.</p><p>2)         If an artist is no longer with us we can no more speak<br/>intelligently about what h/she sounded like without having the recorded<br/>evidence of his/her work than we can credibly hold forth on the speaking<br/>ability of any president prior to TR.   Well, guess what?   There are NO<br/>recordings of any jazz group AT ALL before 1917.   Buddy Bolden, icon so<br/>revered by Wynton and his crew, stopped performing in 1907.   Hands up anyone<br/>over 93.   O.K.  the rest of you are just moving air to even venture an<br/>opinion.   There is no doubt that Burns is a master at taking period<br/>photographs and inserting contemporary narration over it, but I draw the line<br/>at having 40 year old Wynton play what he thinks Buddy maybe sorta, coulda,<br/>mighta sounded like.  This at the expense of Bill Evans!!! (More on that<br/>later on.)</p><p>3)         Whether or not you think the two hours spent on a time where there<br/>is no documentation of the sounds being created is reasonable, surely you<br/>will grant that spending two hours on the years 1935-37, which Burns does,<br/>seems a little out of balance, when only 2 hours are spent on the time<br/>between 1961 and 2000, and much of that two hours is spent falsely asserting<br/>that jazz had lost its way between 1965 and 1985 when Wynton Reagan Marsalis<br/>took over the joint.</p><p>            So we understand, Burns spends as much time on a period where<br/>there is zero recorded evidence of the music as he does on the most<br/>extensively documented 40 years in the history of the music.   That is<br/>utterly fraudulent in methodology and representation.</p><p>The fetishization of Louis Armstrong</p><p>            Ah&apos;m comin&apos; &apos;lizabeth, ah&apos;m comin&apos;.   Now Zilber&apos;s dissing Louis,<br/>ah&apos;m comin&apos; ta meet yah, &apos;lizabeth.   Relax, take a beta blocker and read<br/>carefully:</p><p>            Without Louis Armstrong there would be no jazz as we know it.<br/>He was the first great soloist in jazz, the man responsible for the whole<br/>idea of a soloist telling his story.   Armstrong&apos;s glorious sound, unhurried<br/>swing and exceptional virtuosity, coupled with an ebullient song-like<br/>lyricism, redefined what it meant to be a jazz musician.  He set a whole new<br/>standard for improvisers (AND singers with his magnificent scatting.  His<br/>jazz scatting is still just about the only such I&apos;ll go out of my way to<br/>listen to.  Hey singers:  You&apos;ve got lyrics, use &apos;em.)   To paraphrase<br/>Newton, anyone playing jazz today is standing on the shoulders of giants and<br/>Armstrong is the original giant on whom all others balance.</p><p>            O.K.  Feel better now?   Can I get you a cold drink.   I REALLY<br/>love Louis, honest.  HOWEVER!   Armstrong&apos;s fertile artistic period as an<br/>innovator was over by about 1932, and if you look at the Hot Five and Seven<br/>records as well as the duets with Earl Hines, we&apos;re really talking about a<br/>five year period.   Armstrong never moved past the stylistic approach of the<br/>late 1920s, and by the late 1930s artists such as Lester Young, Duke<br/>Ellington, Count Basie and Charlie Christian were far more developed<br/>harmonically, rhythmically and formally.  This is not to demean Armstrong in<br/>any way.  Without Armstrong, there would have been no Lester, Bird, Miles,<br/>Trane, Herbie, Liebman, Woody Shaw, and so on and so on.</p><p>And yet, it is equally absurd to hold Armstrong up as non pareil in terms of<br/>his musical substance.  It&apos;s like saying no one in physics, even Einstein,<br/>will ever be at the level of Newton.  This is exactly what Burns and Marsalis<br/>assert.   In interview after interview, Burns has a smug and prepackaged<br/>sophistry for anyone who challenges why Bill Evans, Herbie, Wayne Shorter,<br/>Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea et al. get such short shrift.   &quot;Name me one<br/>person from the past 40 years as good as Louis, Duke, Bird or Miles and I&apos;ll<br/>put them in.&quot;   This from the fella who five years ago owned Kind of Blue,<br/>Love Supreme and a bunch of rock records.   Well Ken baby,  I&apos;m not sure what<br/>you mean by good, but ya know, if Newton came back from the dead he would be<br/>utterly baffled and nonplussed by quantum physics of today.  By the same<br/>token, drop Louis in any band of world-class current day jazz musicians, say<br/>Dave Douglas&apos; group or Dave Liebman&apos;s, and the rhythms, harmonies, melodies,<br/>forms and tempos played would be so far in advance of anything conceived of<br/>by the Hot Five that poor Louis would be utterly flummoxed and bewildered.<br/>That doesn&apos;t make one better than the other - it&apos;s like comparing Mandarin<br/>and Provencal cuisine.   It merely show&apos;s the fatuousness of Burns&apos;<br/>Marsalis-supplied line of defense.</p><p>1961-2000 The Big Lie</p><p>The iconicizing of Louis goes so far into retro-absurdity that Burns wastes<br/>valuable space on his companion CD set shoehorning in Armstrong&apos;s kitschy<br/>rendition of Hello Dolly while at the same time finding no space on the<br/>61-2000 CD for Keith Jarrett, Bill Evans, Chick Corea, John Mclaughlin, Wes<br/>Montgomery, Oregon. Mahavishnu, Dave Liebman, Art Ensemble of Chicago, Steps<br/>Ahead, and.I&apos;ll stop here cause I&apos;m trying to keep this thing under 4000<br/>words.   I don&apos;t even think the most diehard early jazz fanatic would assert<br/>that Louis&apos; Hello Dolly ranks with Chick&apos;s Now He Sings, Now he Sobs or Wayne<br/>Shorter&apos;s Native Dancer in importance, but to Burns/Marsalis, it is clearly<br/>more important.</p><p>Even when Burns focuses on a post-1960s artist, he damns with faint praise.<br/>This as just one example among many demonstrating Burns&apos; staggering ignorance<br/>about post 1960 jazz.  Who&apos;s he talking about when he says: As obviously<br/>talented as ________ is, he isn&apos;t a great soloist or composer or a major<br/>innovator.    Why Herbie Hancock of course!  Most practicing jazz musicians<br/>would rank Herbie among the top pianists in the history of jazz.   From his<br/>earth-shattering work with the Miles Davis quintet of the 60s to his<br/>exquisite blue note releases, from his cross-cultural Sextant, fusing<br/>African, jazz and funk to his astonishing duet records with Wayne Shorter and<br/>Chick Corea, Herbie has established himself as an artist of the highest order<br/>as a soloist, accompanist and composer.   But no, Ken Burns says otherwise.</p><p>I think the Burns/Marsalis party line is never more clearly stated than in<br/>the preamble to the last episode, covering 1961-2000.   According to the<br/>film, jazz, by the early 1960s had lost its way.   Hello Dolly and Girl from<br/>Ipanema excepted, Beatles and other nasty rock n&apos;rollers were outselling jazz<br/>by large margins.   (Never mind that Beboppers such as Bird and Diz never<br/>came close to the sales of Sinatra and Perry Como and that Elvis Presley out<br/>sold Miles&apos; biggest hit, Kind of Blue by ten to one.)   Miles, according to<br/>the film, decided if you can&apos;t beat &apos;em, join &apos;em.  Yep, it&apos;s a shame that<br/>Miles spurned such challenging fare as Hello Dolly for the obvious commercial<br/>pandering of Miles Runs The Voodoo Down and Agartha.</p><p>Burns/Marsalis go on to hail Dexter Gordon&apos;s return in 1976, purveying his<br/>smooth hard bop of the 1950s as saving jazz from itself:   a vast sea of<br/>commercial, electric pandering and squawking &apos;free&apos; jazz charlatans.   Then a<br/>certain young trumpet terror from New Orleans came on the scene,<br/>coincidentally right at the same time as another retro figure, Ronald Reagan,<br/>and led the unwashed masses away from the slums of fusion and free, back to<br/>the sober, Italian-suited recreations of ever more distant forms of jazz.</p><p>It&apos;s a nice story. It&apos;s also a fundamentally dishonest recounting of what<br/>happened in jazz after 1961.   Master saxophonist Liebman has a great line.<br/>If you really want to know what&apos;s happening, ask the musicians, and I mean<br/>other than the astoundingly reactionary Wynton Marsalis.   By the way, as<br/>discussed above, Wynton is the first influential jazz musician in the history<br/>of the music with not ONE innovation to his name.  Furthermore, he is the<br/>first influential jazz musician in history who takes his cue from two<br/>NON-MUSICIANS, Stanley Crouch and Albert Murray.</p><p> Just what did Ken and Wynton leave out?   Lets start with the 60s, the<br/>decade in which, according to Burns/Marsalis, jazz lost its way.   From Bossa<br/>Nova to Albert Ayler, an almost inconceivable range of Jazz was created in<br/>that landmark decade.   Let&apos;s focus in on just three of the groups from the<br/>decade when jazz &quot;lost its way&quot;.   Most working jazz musicians consider that<br/>the hardest chunk of music to master is the music which began in about 1959<br/>with Coltrane, Bill Evans and Miles Davis.   They recognize that the<br/>extraordinary level of freedom AND control of materials exhibited by the<br/>Davis quintet, the Coltrane quartet and the Evans trio is unsurpassed and a<br/>rich lode of material for further development.   The exceptional level of<br/>interplay and rich harmonic development by the Evans trio has informed<br/>everyone from Hancock to Corea to Jarrett to current star Brad Mehldau.   The<br/>amazing conversations, break neck tempos, superimposed rhythms and densely<br/>free chromaticism of the Davis quintet has shaped every band from Woody Shaw<br/>to Dave Douglas to Wallace Roney to Tim Hagans.   The powerful cantorial<br/>tenor of Coltranem the volcanic dialogues with Elvin Jones, the stretched<br/>harmonies of Tyner&apos;s insistent fourths have marked every tenor player since<br/>Coltrane, including Wayne Shorter, Liebman, Mike Brecker, Kenny Garrett and<br/>Wynton&apos;s brother.</p><p>Then we get to the 70s.   I know it is not PC to say it, but the 1970s had a<br/>wealth of phenomenal music.   Like the 30s, and the 50s, it was a time when<br/>the music became widely popular, with records such as Herbie Hancock&apos;s<br/>Headhunters and Weather Report&apos;s Heavy Weather selling a million copies each.<br/>  Like the 30s and the 50s, one has to separate the wheat from the chaff - so<br/>just as one makes a qualitative distinction between Count Basie and Glenn<br/>Miller, one needs to make a qualitative distinction between Grover<br/>Washington&apos;&apos; &quot;Mr. Magic&quot;   and Weather Report&apos;s &quot;The Juggler&quot;.</p><p>Incredibly, Burns, in his penurious allotment of post 1965 music (7 tunes),<br/>picks &quot;Mr. Magic&quot;, Hancock&apos;s &quot;Rockit&quot; and Weather Report&apos;s &quot;Birdland&quot; as<br/>three of the seven tunes.   That would be like picking Paul McCartney doing<br/>&quot;Till there was you&quot; as representative of the music of the Beatles.<br/>Meanwhile a whole wealth of brilliant material from the decade is omitted,<br/>including far more stellar representations by Hancock and Weather Report.<br/>It may seem hard to believe, but on Burns&apos; companion CD the following artists<br/>don&apos;t make the cut in this Pravdaesque retelling of jazz&apos;s last 40 years:<br/>Chick Corea, John McGlaughlin, Keith Jarrett, Oregon, Jaco Pastorius, Joe<br/>Henderson, Pat Metheney, Anthony Braxton, Steps Ahead, John Abercrombie, John<br/>Scofield, Dave Holland, Jan Garbarek, Lifetime, Dave Liebman, Mike Brecker,<br/>Joe Lovano..aww shit, it&apos;s too depressing to go on.   And yet, Burns finds<br/>time to include Wynton&apos;s vanity project, the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra<br/>doing a cover of Take The A Train.  Paging George Orwell, Mr. Orwell, there&apos;s<br/> a package from Mr. Burns and Mr. Marsalis for you at the front desk.  George<br/>Orwell to the front counter, please.</p><p>A couple of friends of mine who are high up in the music biz, having received<br/>sneak peeks, say &quot;hey, lighten up, Mike.  I know the last 40 years is<br/>bullshit, but what the hell, any publicity is good publicity, don&apos;t ya think?&quot;</p><p>No, I&apos;m sorry to say, I don&apos;t think.   Jazz is a living, breathing music and<br/>in every major city there are serious, hardworking musicians trying to move<br/>this music forward.  They&apos;ve learned the lessons of the masters well, Louis<br/>AND Lieb,  Duke AND Diz AND Douglas,  Morton AND Mingus AND Mike Brecker AND<br/>Melhdau.   They  will not stand for the museumizing and minstrelizing and<br/>misrepresenting of this glorious and ALIVE tradition.</p><p>And so we will not go gentle into that good pledge night, Ken Burns and<br/>Wynton Marsalis.   It is in sorrow as much as anger that j&apos;accuse, j&apos;accuse<br/>again and again and again, of perpetrating the big jazz lie on the American<br/>public.   Cause it don&apos;t mean a thing if it ain&apos;t got Bill, Chick, Wayne,<br/>Mahavishnu, Jaco, Sco, Lieb, Brecker, Joe Hen..</p></div><h3><a id=18201 href="#18201">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
