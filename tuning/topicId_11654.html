It contains several different tunings (incluing 19 tET and diatonic JI) of one phrase from the Bach 4-part chorale harmonization of &quot;Ein Feste Burg&quot;; all played in the same timbre, timing, etc...  The JI and 19 tET tunings are my own setups; the others are 12tET, 1/4 comma meantone, and some others from the standard Yamaha TX802 set of tunings (Kirnberger, etc).  I also threw in a 13 tET for grins...</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>Harald K&#xFC;gler &#x3C;harald.kuegler@nwn.de&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2000 1:06:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Paul H.
