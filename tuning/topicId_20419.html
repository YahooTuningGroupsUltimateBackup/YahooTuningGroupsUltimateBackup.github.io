Amiya could hear the difference<br/>&gt; of 2 cents when someone would try to trick him. [...]</p><p>I can restrict my vibrato to less than +/- 3c only with difficulties<br/>and not for long. If the ancient theorists did not pay attention to<br/>such fine gradations (or ascribed them, not unreasonably either, to<br/>accumulated errors), these 17 sruti might well be Al-Farabi&apos;s<br/>pythagorean system (which recognizes (3/2)^4 and (4/3)^8 as major<br/>thirds). Of course, the series of fifths can easily be expanded to<br/>honor the older tradition of the 22 without emulating the generation<br/>of the original sruti.</p><p>&gt;     On the other hand as opposed to the harmonic series, Amiya would<br/>&gt; recognize subharmonic flute scales as belonging to certain ragas. He<br/>&gt; believed that many of the original melodies could have first developed<br/>&gt; on the flute and later pythagorean versions of the scales were used on<br/>&gt; string instruments.</p><p>Not unlikely. Except for the pythagorean part, this would go well<br/>with my thesis that the sruti were meant to be a common grid for<br/>different scale genera.</p><p>Klaus</p></div>
