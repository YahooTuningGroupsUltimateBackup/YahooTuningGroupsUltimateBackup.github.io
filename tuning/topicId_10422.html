You can find it somewhere on Charles Lucy&apos;s site, which was<br/><a href="http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/">http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/</a> last I remember.  I can&apos;t remember the<br/>details myself.</p><p>Charles had this idea that the pi which occurs in the LucyTuning formula<br/>relates the circular nature of the sine function that underlies sine<br/>waves, and so on.  My first thought was that this couldn&apos;t be right,<br/>because the dimensions were wrong.  Then I thought a bit more and found<br/>that it did sort of work if you used complex numbers, although it still<br/>had nothing to do with Physics or Psychoacoustics.  So the idea of writing<br/>it up was to prove that it _doesn&apos;t_ mean anything important.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if Harrison was thinking this way: probably not, because all<br/>he said in his explanation was that the major third related to the octave<br/>as the diameter of a circle relates to its circumference, whith the whole<br/>tone as the radius.  Probably he had this picture in his head, and no<br/>deeper theory behind it.  If he knew the right people, he may have known<br/>the relevant mathematics, so it&apos;s not *completely* out of the question.</p><p>Background information on LucyTuning, Harrison, etc is all at the site<br/>mentioned above.</p><p>Anyway, that&apos;s the only example I can think of where complex numbers have<br/>anything to do with tuning theory.  If you really want to play<br/>mathematical tricks, you could try using a complex function to choose<br/>notes, and take the real part as key velocity and the imaginary part as<br/>pitch.  That&apos;s fairly harmless, could even be productive.</p><p>             Graham</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2000 7:34:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John F.

The important thing is the usefulness of the description.  Just one<br/>example of a multi-dimensional model being very useful in the field of<br/>music would be Manfred Schroeder&apos;s compelling study of concert-hall acousitcs<br/>(see his book, _Fractals, Chaos, and Power Laws_, pp. 74-79.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
