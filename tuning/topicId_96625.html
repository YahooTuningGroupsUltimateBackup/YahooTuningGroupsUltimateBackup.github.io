This might be a good way to bring the recent discussion about<br/>scale structure and HE and priming and Rothenberg into the realm of<br/>testable hypothesis.

The 6-note MOS sounds a lot here<br/>like messing with the superpyth example. The 11-note MOS evokes, of<br/>course, the sounds of Athenian ruins. Play 4:6:7:8:9 and transpose it<br/>up and down the scale.</p><p>Sometimes, in this scale, the 4:6:7 takes on a completely different<br/>feeling than with superpyth. Not that I actually think it&apos;s a major 7<br/>from a cognitive standpoint, but major 7 chords usually sound kind of<br/>sad and yet happy, and in this scale 4:6:7 sounds the same way. Man, I<br/>am really tripping out. Like, imagine hearing major chords, but for<br/>some reason they sound sad all of a sudden. That&apos;s where I&apos;m at.</p><p>Man, this whole chromatic pairs approach is the best thing to happen<br/>to tuning theory since I joined the list.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=96636 href="#96636">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2011 11:30:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Man, this whole chromatic pairs approach is the best thing to happen<br/>&gt; to tuning theory since I joined the list.</p><p>It&apos;s partly psychology.
