The<br/>temperaments are polymicrotonal.</p><p>The late Allen Ginsberg chose this set of poems on the theme of New York<br/>suggested by Elodie Lauten for a musical setting,during the summer of 96 from<br/>Cosmopolitan Greetings 1986-1992, Collected Poems 1947-1980, and White Shroud<br/>Poems1980-1989. These three books are currently available, published by<br/>Harper Collins. The poems are highly autobiographical.They reveal some of<br/>Allen&#xFFFD;s most intimate thoughts - there is a secret in this selection, there<br/>is a legacy, a special message heleft to be disseminated - because New York<br/>was to him like a second skin.</p><p>Waking in New York is scored for baritone, soprano and mezzo soprano,<br/>percussion, double bass, string quartet and flute.  It is Ginsberg&#xFFFD;s flow of<br/>mental associations that trigger rhythm changes and key modulations, but the<br/>mood is translated in the<br/>general pattern arrangement. The melodies follows the text very closely not<br/>only in terms of its own rhythm but in terms of its meaning, which can lead<br/>to some quick and unexpected musical transformations. The first act sets two<br/>major autobiographical poems, May Days 1988 and The Charnel Ground, with the<br/>brief distraction of Lunchtime in between - as in a typical NewYork workday.<br/>The second act sets three short pieces, Jumping the Gun on the Sun, Manhattan<br/>Thirties Flash and &#xFFFD;Song&#xFFFD; (from Howl), all three quite varied in their feel,<br/>and the title piece, Waking in New York. This particular poem is so rich and<br/>complex that it was set in three separate sections with different tempos and<br/>key signatures. Noteworthy highlights are:  areference to the Kennedy<br/>assassination, the New York anthem, &#xFFFD;O New York, O now our bird, flying past<br/>glass window chirp,our life together here&#xFFFD; , the final hymn of mercy, &#xFFFD;that<br/>all beggars be fed, all dying medicined, all loveless tomorrow be loved, well<br/>come and be balm&#xFFFD;, and settings of mantras Lauten says she learned from Allen<br/>himself while performing with him.  &#xFFFD;The buddhist idea of compassion is very<br/>important in relation to Allen&apos;&quot;says Lauten.  His entire thinking process is<br/>compassion in itself - he  looks at people and feels their struggle. I tried<br/>to stay close to Allen&#xFFFD;s train of thought, alternatively introspective and<br/>expansive, sometimes triggering hints of different musical styles, but twice<br/>removed, not as direct quotes. It was like makingfilm music with images<br/>provided by his consciousness - until the melody found its way of taking<br/>over.&#xFFFD;</p><p>Born in Newark, New Jersey in 1926, the son of the well-known lyric poet and<br/>teacher Louis Ginsberg.  As a student at Columbia College in the 1940s, he<br/>began a close friendship with William Burroughs, Neal Cassady, and Jack<br/>Kerouac, and became associated with the Beat movement and the San Francisco<br/>Renaissance in the 1950s. After jobs as a laborer, sailor, and market<br/>researcher, Ginsberg published his first book of poetry, Howl and Other<br/>Poems, in 1956. Howl<br/>overcame censorship trials to become one of the most widely read poems of the<br/>century, translated into more than twenty-two languages, a model for younger<br/>generations of poets from West to East. Crowned Prague May King in 1965, then<br/>expelled by Czech police and simultaneously placed in the FBI&#xFFFD;s Dangerous<br/>Security list, Ginsberg has, in recent years, traveled to and taught in the<br/>People&#xFFFD;s Republic of China, the Soviet Union, Scandinavia, and Eastern<br/>Europe, receiving Yugoslavia&#xFFFD;s Struga Poetry Festival &#xFFFD;Golden Wreath&#xFFFD; in<br/>1986.  A member of the American Institute of Arts and Letters  and co-founder<br/>of the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at the Naropa Institute,<br/>the first accredited Buddhist college in the Western world, Ginsberg lived on<br/>New York&#xFFFD;s Lower East Side.  He died in April 1997 at age 70.</p><p>At age 22, Elodie Lauten was chosen to compose and perform the music for an<br/>experimental play at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. Shortly after, she<br/>was an overnight success in New York, where she found a mentor in Allen<br/>Ginsberg who<br/>encouraged her to compose and introduced her to Buddhism.  She moved<br/>permanently to New York in 1976.  She cut demos for Capitol but eventually<br/>went the independent route with her first release, Orchestre Modern (Rocking<br/>Horse).  Then came a time of intense study: meditation with Sri Chinmoy,<br/>Indian music with LaMonte Young and a Masters in composition at NewYork<br/>University.  During the 80s she produced a steady stream of independent<br/>releases:  Piano Works, Concerto for Piano and Orchestral Memory, The Death<br/>of Don Juan and Blue Rhythms (Cat Collectors/NMDS).  She was hailed by the<br/>Village Voice as<br/>&#xFFFD;a composer of enchanting music, and one of New York&#xFFFD;s most individual voices<br/>of the present generation&#xFFFD;. Her multimedia opera The Death of Don Juan<br/>received support from the National Endowment and the Massachusetts Council<br/>for the Arts.  In the 90s a number of CDs featuring her varied output &#xFFFD; piano<br/>music, synthesizer pieces, chamber music, operas and music for the Trine, the<br/>21-string microtonal lyre she designed, came out on various labels:  Tronik<br/>Involutions (O.O. Discs), Variations on the Orange Cycle (Lovely Music),<br/>Music for the Trine (Nonsequitur) and  Inscapes from Exile (New Tone).  The<br/>Deus Ex Machina Cycle (4Tay) is her latest release.</p><p>For further information or to order a copy of the new Elodie Lauten CD The<br/>Deus Ex Machina Cycle (4Tay) please call<br/>Elodie Lauten at 212-388-0202.
