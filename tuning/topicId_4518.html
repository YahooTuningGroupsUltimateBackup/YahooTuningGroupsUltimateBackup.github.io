In its strictest meaning, it refers to a regular temperament (all<br/>like intervals _exactly_ the same size) where the whole step (tone)is<br/>_exactly_ the geometric mean between 9:8 and 10:9.  This is the 1/4-(syntonic)<br/>comma meantone temperament.  At some point, other regular temperaments<br/>reducing the fifths by other fractions of a comma (anywhere from 1/8 to 1/3)<br/>began to be called &quot;meantone&quot; temperaments, presumably because their major<br/>seconds were *somewhere* between 9:8 and 10:9.  Certainly 12-et and 19-et fall<br/>into this category, and if all major seconds in 31-et are the same size, 31-et<br/>also.  Because of this fuzziness, I prefer to reserve the term &quot;meantone&quot; for<br/>only 1/4- comma, and call the others M/N-comma regular temperaments. BTW, even<br/>though 12-eq is _extremely_ close to 1/11-comma, as 19-et is _extremely_ close<br/>to 1/3-comma, they are _all_ regular temperaments.</p><p>Fred Reinagel</p><p>____________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a href="http://webmail.netscape.com">http://webmail.netscape.com</a>.</p></div><h3><a id=4519 href="#4519">ðŸ”—</a>Judith Conrad &#x3C;jconrad@xxxxxxx.xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/1999 9:07:38 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: Fred Reinagel &lt;<a href="mailto:freinagel@netscape.net">freinagel@netscape.net</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Joe Monzo &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@juno.com">monz@juno.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 294.19]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 19 and 31 are meantone tunings; hence any conventionally</p><p>&gt; &gt; strictly speaking, by mathematical definition, 19- and 31-eq<br/>&gt; &gt; are *not* meantone tunings.</p><p>&gt; The term &quot;meantone&quot; has become a bit murky as of late (during the last half</p><p>&gt; seconds were *somewhere* between 9:8 and 10:9.</p><p>Thanks for bringing this up, Fred, I personally am a bit of an expert on<br/>meantone tuning, renaissance and baroque style, and I don&apos;t have a clue<br/>what you guys are talking about.</p><p>The essence of meantone as I use it isn&apos;t that it&apos;s quarter comma; it can<br/>be third-comma or fifth comma or sixth comma (which gets a little silly<br/>and academic).
