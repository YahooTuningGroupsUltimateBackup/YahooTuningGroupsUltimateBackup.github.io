I publish it here in case anybody finds it<br/>;interesting...</p><p>It all starts with a group of things. Imagine a group called Moe. Say there<br/>are x things in it. Imagine picking the things up and putting them in your<br/>hand. There are obviously x different hands if you pick up only one of them<br/>at a time. But how many different ways are there to hold two of them at a<br/>time? Three at a time? The answers can be found in Pascal&apos;s triangle, by<br/>reading across the row corresponding to x.</p><p>Now imagine a set of all the possible hands from Moe. This is called the<br/>power set of Moe. How many things does it have in it? It makes sense to add<br/>up all the numbers in the corresponding row of Pascal&apos;s triangle. It so<br/>happens that this number is 2^x. If you&apos;ve ever played a valved brass<br/>instrument, you may have noticed that there are 8 = 2^3 possible ways to<br/>valve the horn, at least on three-valve instruments.</p><p>Wilson has called the power set a 0/x thru x/x CPS, or &quot;grand slam&quot;. He<br/>pointed out that it contains all of the CPS&apos;s makable by taking any number<br/>of things at a time from any subset of the source set. For example, the 2|6<br/>[1 3 5 7 9 11] eikosany contains a 2|3 and a 3|3 dekany for each of the six<br/>5-member subsets of [1 3 5 7 9 11]. In this way, each new row of Pascal&apos;s<br/>triangle can be seen as restricting the number of possible source sets for<br/>the previous rows.</p><p>What Wilson didn&apos;t point out is that the power set also contains the<br/>diamond of every scale that can be built by chaining intervals from the<br/>source set. In the case of [1 3 5 7] one such scale would be 1/1, 5/4,<br/>105/64, 15/8. In the case of [1/1 3/2 5/3 7/5] one such scale would be 1/1,<br/>5/4, 3/2, 7/4.<br/>What is a diamond? It is a list of all the intervals in a scale. In other<br/>words, it&apos;s what you get when you rotate the scale&apos;s interior intervals<br/>around a common frequency -- what you get if you start each mode of the<br/>scale on 1/1.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=5198 href="#5198">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
