So<br/>you can hear it any time, whether or not you live in America or your<br/>local station airs the show (as long as you can play Real Audio<br/>streams at about 32 Kbps, anyway).</p><p>To hear some especially colorful uses of quarter-comma on French<br/>Baroque harpsichord, go to the link below, select the show &quot;The Sun<br/>King 00-43&quot; and scan up to about 39:30 or so (the piece starts at<br/>about 38:55).  There&apos;s a lovely tritone around 40:30.  Just after 27<br/>minutes the guest mentions the tuning and a very little bit about how<br/>it changed the recording.  The piece immediately following the dialog<br/>is also sumptiously non-equal, tuning-wise.  Some of the other pieces<br/>on the show are nice, too, but these two best show off some of the<br/>too seldom seen facets of meantone tuning.</p><p><a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~harmonia/archives.htm">http://www.indiana.edu/~harmonia/archives.htm</a></p><p>Nothing startling for most of us who are used to hearing intervals of<br/>any and all sizes.  But if, like me, you always wondered what baroque<br/>music sounded like in tunings of the era, this is a sweet treat.</p><p>I listen to this show fairly religiously, so now that it&apos;s more<br/>widely and conveniently available, I&apos;ll try to remember to point out<br/>other interesting tuning examples whenever I notice them.</p><p>What a great time to be alive!</p><p>David Finnamore</p></div>
