Only include the parts<br/>&gt; that you are actually responding to and interleave your comments<br/>&gt; after the quotes. Do you need to use a different mailer to make<br/>&gt; it easier?</p><p>I see by the Juno advertisement at the end of all my postings<br/>that the mailers do add their own &apos;noise&apos;.  It&apos;s annoying,<br/>but I suppose one *has* to overlook that.</p><p>But really, as I&apos;ve said before, using Digest.Message reference<br/>numbers as I do can keep quotes to a minimum and makes it easy<br/>to go back and find the original.  I realize it&apos;s a little<br/>extra work, but it only takes a few seconds, and it&apos;s worth it.</p><p>(And, for the future day when I get back to archiving these<br/>Digests on the Sonic Arts website, it will make it *much* easier<br/>for me to make links from quotes to originals.  That way<br/>when reading a response in an archived Digest, all you&apos;d have<br/>to do is click the link to go back to the original and read that.)</p><p>[Pat Pagano, TD 181.17]<br/>&gt; Dave and Monz<br/>&gt; I will attempt to trim qoutes sometimes I do forget and for this<br/>&gt; I apologise</p><p>Never meant to imply that you were the only one either, Pat.<br/>Others are sometimes guilty too.</p><p>--------------------------------------------</p><p>To Dave Keenan:<br/>---------------</p><p>Thanks for the mended lattices, as well as the observation<br/>that several different ones can be equally valid in an ET.<br/>[TD 181.16]</p><p>----------------------------------------------</p><p>To Ray Tomes:<br/>------------</p><p>[Ray Tomes, TD 181.19]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;[John de Laubenfels]<br/>&gt;&gt; I absolutely agree that we can and should take charge of tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think this is the most important thing but it seems I<br/>&gt; accidentally upset some ET supporters with my arrogant attitude.</p><p>I&apos;m a JI supporter, and you upset me too.</p><p>It turns out, after seeing more of your postings, that your<br/>attitudes and methods really aren&apos;t that different from some<br/>of the rest of us.  And I find your &apos;Centre of Gravity&apos; idea<br/>very much along the lines of my own work.</p><p>Glad you jumped back onboard!  I&apos;ll be spending some time<br/>digging thru your work in the near future (soon as AFMM is over).</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

Over the previous decade I have found few people<br/>that understood what I was saying let alone other people thinking some<br/>similar thoughts.</p><p>On my web pages I have some musical discussions from another list as<br/>well as my AJI description.  I would like, at some time, to add parts of<br/>the discussion here to my web pages as it considerably expands and<br/>clarifies my existing pages on AJI.  I want to know whether this is<br/>considered a public forum (I would think so) and I can therefore quote<br/>material in this manner, or whether it is necessary to ask first.  In<br/>the other case I got permission from all people for quoting them and I<br/>am certainly happy to not quote people or to remove their names if they<br/>want to be anonymous.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
