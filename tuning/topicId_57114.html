The N kind of double sharp in Tartini Plus<br/>Two looks nice.</p><p>I guess that one needs an explanation.  It was intended to be more<br/>like .\&apos; -- the two lines are supposed to suggest the downward half-<br/>arrow \| of the -1 symbol, something like a &quot;V&quot;, just as occurs in<br/>+1, +3, and +5 of Tartini-plus #2.  But there is a slightly different<br/>logic behind the up-symbols that proceeds from the employment of the<br/>half-arrow symbol for both +1 and -1.</p><p>&gt; But it could be a lot better like % (reversed-dots squared and<br/>filled).</p><p>See the updated figure:<br/><a href="/tuning-math/files/secor/notation/">/tuning-math/files/secor/notation/</a><br/>filename Symset41.gif</p><p>In the middle of the bottom staff are 7a, which I think is too much<br/>alike in size to 8-new2 (which now appears in both sets, #1 and #2),<br/>and also 7b and 7c, which are smaller.  I still prefer 7-new1 to all<br/>of these, for two reasons:</p><p>1) 7a thru 7c are all bolder in appearance than 8-new2, suggesting<br/>that they should symbolize a larger alteration.  (I also happen to<br/>prefer 8-new1 over 8-new2 because of its &quot;bolder&quot; look.)</p><p>2) I believe that the essential appearance of the double-sharp is<br/>associated more with its X-shape than with the exaggerated serifs of<br/>the modern symbol, so I would rather use a type of &quot;X&quot; in conjunction<br/>with the backslash than the serifs.</p><p>&gt; Also the size of &grave;new2 double shaprs&grave; could be reduced by a notch.</p><p>With the resolution of 8 pixels between staff lines that I&apos;m using,<br/>it&apos;s not possible to have anything intermediate in size between &quot;8<br/>modern&quot; and &quot;8-new2&quot; that can be centered on a given staff position.<br/>As it is, +8 is still smaller in appearance than +6, and I think<br/>nobody will have any trouble figuring out what it means.</p><p>&gt; As long as we&apos;re talking about the double-sharp, did you notice the<br/>&gt; difference between the double-flat (-8) in symbol sets #1 and #2?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now I did. I personally prefer Tartini Plus One -8 double <a href="http://flat.It">flat.It</a>&apos;s<br/>much more nourishing to the eye.</p><p>I have seen a piece of printed music without any space separating the<br/>two halves of the double-flat symbol, but it seems to be the<br/>exception.  Anyway, it makes the double-flat look more like *one*<br/>symbol.</p><p>&gt; But you are saying that somehow the &quot;b&quot; is not distinct enough and<br/>&gt; that the slash should be moved slightly upward.  This would make<br/>the<br/>&gt; amount of white space intermediate between the -2 semiflat and -4<br/>&gt; flat.  I have added this as -3b at the lower right part of the<br/>&gt; updated figure:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No no no, what I meant was to move the slash upward as in -3, only<br/>a little more slanted. The same goes for -7. But the way I see it,<br/>what you came up with is better than before... only if the slash<br/>weren&apos;t so thick!</p><p>I&apos;m sorry, but I still don&apos;t know what you meant by &quot;as in -3&quot;.  I<br/>intended the thickness of the slashes in all of the odd-numbered<br/>symbols to be as uniform as possible, so that it could be easily<br/>recognized as a common element of these symbols.  Now I&apos;m puzzled<br/>that you think the slash in -3 is too thick but that the one in +3<br/>(below) is not thick enough.</p><p>&gt; To the immediate left of this I have placed -3a (copy of new1) and -<br/>4<br/>&gt; (flat) and also, to the immediate right, -2 (semiflat), for an easy<br/>&gt; (side-by-side) comparison.  At the extreme right is -7b, formed by<br/>&gt; combining -3b and -4.  Do these meet with your approval?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think the round of the -2 flat for Tartini Plus One should be<br/>fatter, as fat as the -3 mentioned above.Same goes for -6.</p><p>It was Dave Keenan&apos;s recommendation that we make the backwards flat<br/>*significantly* smaller that the flat so as to alleviate the problem<br/>of lateral confusability between these two symbols, and I am in<br/>agreement with his solution, for which he did not judge half of the<br/>present difference in width to be significant enough.  (I also think<br/>that Dave should respond to this.)</p><p>&gt; I see that I have issues with Tartini Plus One -5, +3 and +5. Here<br/>is what I suggest:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Degree +5 should be as slanted and thick as +4.</p><p>For what reason?  The +5 symbol looks as if it&apos;s intermediate in size<br/>between +4 and +6, and the steeper slope of the slashes in the odd-<br/>numbered symbols gives them an appearance that sets them apart from<br/>the even-numbered ones and makes them easier to distinguish when read<br/>rapidly.  Another purpose of the steeper slope is to make the<br/>direction of the slope more obvious; otherwise the meaning that / is<br/>up and \ is down would be obscured, because they would look too much<br/>alike.</p><p>&gt; The same goes for +6.<br/>&gt; +3 would look best if mirrored and made as thick as +4.</p><p>Do you mean that the slash of +3 should go upward, like this / ?<br/>We&apos;re trying to notate a sharp *decreased* by a 5-comma, hence a<br/>*downward* slash \ .  But if you&apos;re trying to make the symbols more<br/>uniform in appearance, then I would suggest considering the #2 set,<br/>beginning with the +3 and +5 symbols, and comparing them with their<br/>mixed-Sagittal counterparts (directly below) to follow the underlying<br/>logic.</p><p>&gt; -5 should have another flat component just as its counterpart sharp<br/>has three pikes.</p><p>There *is* another flat component: -5 is simply -1 and -4 with the<br/>stems merged, just as -6 is a merger of -2 and -4.  In the Tartini-<br/>Couper symbols stems are not added to the down-symbols in the same<br/>fashion as they are added to the up-symbols; otherwise, the -4 (flat)<br/>symbol would have to have 2 stems to match the +4 (sharp) symbol,<br/>the -6 symbol would have to have 3 stems, and the double-flat would<br/>end up with 4 stems.  With the even-numbered symbols we think that<br/>it&apos;s okay to tinker with the dimensions a little bit, but not with<br/>the essential features.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=57152 href="#57152">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2005 10:48:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #ddd'><b>Attachments</b></div><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>George, I have written by hand the symbols which appeal to me the most in the attached JPG file.</p><p>All in all my preference is a mix of these sharps:</p><p>Tartini1) +1+2 (the prior as bold and slanted as the latter)<br/>Tartini2) +3 +4<br/>Tartini1) +5 +6 (the prior as bold and slanted as the latter)<br/>New double sharp (7a)<br/>Double sharp (modern+8)</p><p>And these flats:</p><p>Tartini1) -1 -2 (the latter equally mirrored)<br/>Maqam -3<br/>Tartini1) -4 -5 -6 (the latter equally mirrored)<br/>Maqam+Flat -7<br/>Tartini1) Double flat</p><p>This way, the set seems both aesthetically and mathematically ordered and in conformity to a great extent with maqam music practice hereabouts.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p></div><h3><a id=57688 href="#57688">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

This obscures the<br/>significance of the upward-sloping slashes in the +1 and +5 symbols,<br/>since the cross-strokes of the +2, +4, and +6 symbols now have the<br/>same appearance (including the same slope) as the comma-slashes.<br/>About the only thing I could say in favor of this is that it is more<br/>aesthetically pleasing as a unifying element.</p><p>These two things are most damaging to the +3 symbol, in which the<br/>downward-sloping line is considerably shorted, relative to the length<br/>of the sharp cross-stroke, so that it is now only about 1/3 the<br/>length of the latter (whereas in our Tartini-plus #2 set it was<br/>actually longer than the cross-stroke).  Whereas we had intended that<br/>the slash should be a prominent feature of the symbol (to indicate<br/>the direction of the comma-alteration to the sharp), it is now so<br/>inconspicuous that its meaning is lost.</p><p>Would you consider replacing it with the symbol from our #1 set,<br/>preferably the older version with the longer slash labeled &quot;3 old&quot;<br/>near the bottom left of the figure in Symset41.gif, in which the<br/>downward-sloping slash is more prominent?  You may object that an<br/>opposite slope gives it a different appearance from the other<br/>symbols, but I believe that this would be an advantage in that this<br/>symbol would be more readily distinguished from the others, and it<br/>would emphasize the fact that the comma is applied in a downward<br/>(i.e., opposite) direction.</p><p>3) I was surprised by the cursive &quot;x&quot; you used for +8, which has a<br/>*wavy* line that you also used in +7, where I had expected a downward-<br/>sloping *straight* line such as I have in 7a, 7b, or 7c in the middle<br/>of the lowest staff of my diagram, to indicate a double-sharp lowered<br/>by a comma.</p><p>Could you replace the wavy line with a straight line in both +7 and<br/>+8?</p><p>&gt; And these flats:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tartini1) -1 -2 (the latter equally mirrored)<br/>&gt; Maqam -3<br/>&gt; Tartini1) -4 -5 -6 (the latter equally mirrored)<br/>&gt; Maqam+Flat -7<br/>&gt; Tartini1) Double flat</p><p>Both Dave&apos;s and my preference is for the upward-sloping slash of -3<br/>and -7 to remain within the staff position (as in -3a or -3b of my<br/>diagram), and also for the enclosed white space to be smaller than<br/>that of a full flat (-4).  However, we recognize that the maqam<br/>symbol, as you have drawn it, *does* clearly indicate that it is to<br/>be interpreted as a flat plus a comma.
