I was foolishly only thinking in terms of the chain of generators, and thinking, as Gene hinted, that MOS does stand for &quot;moment of symmetry&quot;.</p><p>I _could_ say I was wrong because a MOS with an even number of notes has _two_ symmetric &quot;modes&quot;. But for that you&apos;d have to allow that a &quot;mode&quot; can begin and end at the middle of an interval instead of on a note.</p><p>e.g. This meantone[12] as a chain of fifths is centered on the D:A fifth.<br/>Eb Bb F  C  G  D  A  E  B  F# C# G#</p><p>It has these two symmetric &quot;modes&quot;</p><p>F# G  G# A  Bb B  C  C# D  Eb E  F<br/>C  C# D  Eb E  F  F# G  G# A  Bb B</p><p>But that&apos;s stretching things a bit.</p><p>I thought there might be some sense in which one of the above was centered on D:A but the other was centered on the wolf G#:Eb. But I can&apos;t see it.</p><p>Mike&apos;s generator-based U|D(P) notation is beautiful -- well thought out. I was not aware of it.</p><p>I note that it contains redundant information, which is not a bad thing when dealing with humans. But one _could_ define a more compact version as well, being a single integer mode number M of the kind I was trying to come up with in my previous post.</p><p>I believe it would be simply M = (U-D)/P. Knowing the name of the temperament gives you P, and knowing the number of notes in the MOS gives you N = U+D+P. Therefore the single mode number M = (U-D)/P lets you recover U and D as</p><p>U = ((U+D)+(U-D))/2<br/>  = ((N-P)+(M*P))/2</p><p>D = ((U+D)-(U-D))/2<br/>  = ((N-P)-(M*P))/2</p><p>where<br/>M is the mode number<br/>N is the number of notes per period, and<br/>P is the number of periods per equivalence interval.</p><p>For example the symmetric meantone[7] mode (white notes from D) would be mode 0. Plug M = 0, N = 7, P = 1 into the above formulas and get U = 3, D = 3 so 3|3(1).</p><p>The two diminished[8] modes would be mode 1 and mode -1.

Both of them imply some kind of arbitrary starting and<br/>stopping point, and without that you just have<br/>...LLsLLLsLLsLLLsLLsLLLs... as a infinite set.</p><p>The base point is completely subjective, and in some cases arbitrary.<br/>So we can say that a mode is defined with respect to a periodic scale<br/>s[n], an equivalence interval, and a note in the scale called the<br/>&quot;root.&quot;</p><p>UDP notation is only defined for periodic scales which are also MOS.<br/>Periodic scales which are MOS can also be written out as 1D Fokker<br/>blocks in period-equivalent space. However, it isn&apos;t clear which way<br/>to orient the axes on this line; there are two possible ways to do it.<br/>UDP notation orients the axes such that the translation of the set in<br/>the positive direction causes a new periodic scale s&apos;[n] to be formed,<br/>and where s&apos;[n] &gt;= s[n] for all n. This also means that the point<br/>corresponding to L is on the positive side of the axis, and the point<br/>corresponding to L-s is also on the positive side of the axis. This<br/>also orients the axes such that the point (0,1) corresponds to the<br/>generator of the MOS which is the larger specific interval in its<br/>generic interval class.</p><p>Example: the axes should be oriented for meantone[7] such that 3/2<br/>corresponds to the point 1 on the line. For mavila[7], they should be<br/>oriented such that 4/3 corresponds to point 1.</p><p>For a periodic MOS s[n], call its convex representation in period<br/>equivalent space S[g]. Every entry in S[g] will be in the form [* g&gt;,<br/>where this specifies a period-equivalent monzo within the tempered<br/>lattice. Let [* r&gt; correspond to the note chosen as root. Then, the<br/>number of generators &quot;up&quot; consists of the number of points that are in<br/>S[g] and in which g&gt;r, multiplied by the number of periods per octave.<br/>The number of generators &quot;down&quot; consists of the number of points that<br/>are in S[g] and in which g&lt;r, multiplied by the number of periods per<br/>octave.</p><p>UDP is then up|down(period), or up|down for short. For example,<br/>porcupine&apos;s sssLsss mode is 3|3(1), or 3|3 for short. There are 18<br/>other examples on the wiki page as well.</p><p>Dave&apos;s &quot;brightness&quot; measure is then round((up-down)/(2*period)), where<br/>the round(n) function returns the integer with the next-largest<br/>absolute value if abs(frac(n)) &gt;= 0.5, and with the next-smallest<br/>absolute value if abs(frac(n)) &lt; 0.5.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101941 href="#101941">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2011 2:36:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Also, you wrote this:</p><p>On Tue, Nov 15, 2011 at 2:12 AM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;m also wondering about the formula which was tossed out but never really explained.</p><p>That was one of Keenan&apos;s contributions.

So for 5L2s, L will be 2 chroma-aligned<br/>generators and s will be -5 chroma-aligned generators.</p><p>The expression 1/y mod (x+y) can hence be turned into 1/L mod (L-s);<br/>this expression hence tells you how many segments of generators<br/>representing &quot;L&quot; it takes you to get to a generator, mod the acquired<br/>chromas. But segments of generators representing &quot;L&quot; translate to<br/>steps in the scale, since L is one step in the scale. So this also<br/>tells you the number of &quot;L&quot; steps it takes to get to a generator, mod<br/>all the acquired chromas. Hence, it also tells you how many steps it<br/>takes you to get to the generator, and hence it tells you what scale<br/>degree the generator is on.</p><p>I added one on the wiki article, so that it&apos;s (1/y mod (x+y)) + 1, so<br/>that it hence gives you this number in a form that matches up with the<br/>common terminology for scale degrees: a value of 5 means it&apos;s &quot;a<br/>fifth,&quot; a value of 4 means it&apos;s &quot;a fourth,&quot; a value of 3 means it&apos;s &quot;a<br/>third,&quot; etc. Otherwise it&apos;s that a value of 4 means it&apos;s a fifth and<br/>so on.</p><p>I think Keenan knows some more general theorem that led him to suspect<br/>this, though, because he conjectured it almost immediately after<br/>hearing the problem and said it &quot;seemed obvious&quot; to him. So maybe<br/>there&apos;s a simpler proof than the one outlined above.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101942 href="#101942">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2011 4:47:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike,</p><p>All you need to do to improve your UDP page is add [up or down] &quot;from the tonic&quot;.

However, this isn&apos;t true; if you&apos;re in ionian mode then modal<br/>&gt; shifting by n=1 is dorian, which is down, and modal shifting by n=-1<br/>&gt; is locrian, which is also down.</p><p>OK, have to fix that.</p></div><h3><a id=101964 href="#101964">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2011 8:25:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Is there any reason to prefer U|D to D|U?</p><p>I&apos;d prefer to use 6|0 for Lydian and call that U|D.</p></div><h3><a id=101965 href="#101965">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2011 9:26:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Is there any reason to prefer U|D to D|U?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d prefer to use 6|0 for Lydian and call that U|D.</p><p>Sorry, I meant 0|6.</p></div><h3><a id=101966 href="#101966">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2011 10:08:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;d prefer to use 0|6 for Lydian too, but surely &quot;D&quot; is intended to stand for &quot;down&quot; and &quot;U&quot; for &quot;up&quot; (in generators from the tonic), so that should be called D|U.</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MikeBattaglia/UDPTable.gif">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MikeBattaglia/UDPTable.gif</a></p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any reason to prefer U|D to D|U?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d prefer to use 6|0 for Lydian and call that U|D.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, I meant 0|6.</p></div><h3><a id=101967 href="#101967">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2011 10:41:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d prefer to use 0|6 for Lydian too, but surely &quot;D&quot; is intended to stand for &quot;down&quot; and &quot;U&quot; for &quot;up&quot; (in generators from the tonic), so that should be called D|U.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That should have been &quot;(in chroma-aligned generators from the tonic)&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=101968 href="#101968">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2011 11:39:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d prefer to use 0|6 for Lydian too, but surely &quot;D&quot; is intended to stand for &quot;down&quot; and &quot;U&quot; for &quot;up&quot; (in generators from the tonic), so that should be called D|U.</p><p>I gave a perfectly reasonable interpretation (up to the top mode, down to the bottom mode) which leads to just the opposite conclusion.</p></div><h3><a id=101969 href="#101969">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2011 12:16:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ah.
