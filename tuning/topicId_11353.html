He can be reached<br/>at <a href="mailto:freenote@earthlink.net">freenote@earthlink.net</a></p><p>&gt;         On a separate note, that guy from Australia called again. He&apos;s a real<br/>&gt; piece of work. His patent, #5760322, says in the first general provision<br/>&gt; that he owns the patent on all bent frets anywhere on the neck. He&apos;s<br/>&gt; trying to stop anyone, which includes me and you, from using bent frets.<br/>&gt; His design bends the g and d strings at the first and second frets to<br/>&gt; fix their &apos;out of tuness&apos; by about 8 cents. He says he has a major<br/>&gt; guitar company ready to release it. I think it&apos;s fine to patent the<br/>&gt; specifics of his design, but trying to patent bent frets anywhere is<br/>&gt; outrageous and greedy.<br/>&gt;         Does the tuning list still exist? We need to mobilize the tuning<br/>&gt; community - anyone with a bent fret instrument should come forward.<br/>&gt; Anyone without a bent fret instrument should make one. The evolution of<br/>&gt; microtonal music has already been oppressed by big business - they<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t seen a big potential market, so they offer only one tuning<br/>&gt; system. We can&apos;t let some maniac get away with telling the world we<br/>&gt; can&apos;t use bent frets. Also, we use them to facilitate bending and<br/>&gt; playability in JI, not to make a 12-Tone note a bit flatter. If this<br/>&gt; idiot goes unchallenged, microtonal guitars will be less playable.<br/>&gt;         He says I am required by law to tell him of anyone else I know who is<br/>&gt; using bent frets. I said I knew that people were using them, but I<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t know any names. Didn&apos;t lutes use gut frets that could be bent?<br/>&gt; There must be some other ethnic instruments that use them. You should<br/>&gt; post to some lists about this issue - it&apos;s the first major issue that<br/>&gt; could unite the microtonal folks.    - JC</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3>Joe Monzo &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/7/2000 10:59:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;     On a separate note, that guy from Australia called again.<br/>&gt; He&apos;s a real piece of work.
