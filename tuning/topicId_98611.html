I was too cheap to put on new strings and put screws into<br/>my guitar to try (your?) spiral wrap method.</p><p>The frets stay in place and even have some elastic give to let you adjust<br/>them.. I am wondering if that will be true in a week after the plastic gets<br/>a good long time to creep - but then again this plastic should not be made<br/>to do that considering its normal use is essentially what I&apos;m using it for.</p><p>On Mon, Apr 25, 2011 at 9:51 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Mon, Apr 25, 2011 at 9:33 PM, christopherv &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve found one way to get temporary frets that work, are removable, and<br/>&gt; to a degree re-tune-able - all that is required is a fretless guitar with<br/>&gt; adjustable bridge and cable ties.
