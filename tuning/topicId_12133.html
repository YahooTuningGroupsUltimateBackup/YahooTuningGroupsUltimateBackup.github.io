I&apos;m looking forward to the<br/>results for higher numbers of tones.<br/>&#x9;I have to look closer at the list.  At first glance there are a lot of<br/>intervals between common JI/meantone intervals, but as we go further down,<br/>there are some interesting anamolies.  The first scale with disc. 40.01 is<br/>do re mi fa so in meantone, except the third is flat by 3 cents.  The minor<br/>version below it also has a flat major third.  Looks like the optimizer<br/>prefers a just minor to a either a just major third or a comprimize between<br/>the two in this scale, because this give the widest minor second.  From a<br/>musical standpoint that sounds like a bogous reason, and I think it<br/>partially vindicates John&apos;s observation about the seconds being<br/>overweighted as harmonic elements, although you can&apos;t solve that by leaving<br/>the seconds out of consideration.  The same thing happens in both of the<br/>major thirds of first disc. 40.048 scale, and one minor third is made sharp<br/>of just for the same reason.  At disc. = 40.398 the optimizer starts to<br/>find the septimal dips in the entropy curve (from 229 to 498 is 8/7) and<br/>some stranger intervals start to creep in.  Check out 40.505, there&apos;s a<br/>chain of tempered minor thirds and a perfect 5th above the tritone giving a<br/>slightly tempered 27/25.<br/>&#x9;It looks like the optimizer in the 5-note case will fall into any scale<br/>where every note is related to at least one other by a 7-limit just<br/>consonance with only a very small amount of tempering.  If we take that<br/>amount of tempering as a tolerance, then for the 5 note case we&apos;ll find<br/>relatively few scales distinct in terms of ratio names which are equivalent<br/>within the tempering tolerance.  The exceptions will be scales containing a<br/>series of four fifths, two maj 3rds, three minor 3rds, three 8/7&apos;s, et c.<br/>(anything that leaves a comma below a certain minimum size). Because all<br/>the scales of this sort are listable (there are 6^4*4! of them I believe),<br/>we could test this hypothesis by giving the optimizer each possibility,<br/>look at how much it tweaks each one, and see if any of the random imputs<br/>falls into a scale unique from these.  Well, 6^4*4! is quite a large number.</p><p>jason</p></div>
