Our VL7s will read TG77 pitch<br/>&gt; tables over MIDI, but I can&apos;t seem to find any evidence of that<br/>&gt; capability in the VL70m owners&apos; manual PDF I downloaded.  Do you have<br/>&gt; any information in that regard?</p><p>I do not own a VL70m, but there has been extensive discussion of it on<br/>the wind synthesis mailing list.  It is my understanding that one can<br/>do microtuning, but it is something that is built into each individual<br/>instrument model, and cannot simply be applied afterwards as on typical<br/>synths.  Nor can it be programmed from the front panel. If you get hold<br/>of one of the reversed-engineered &quot;Expert Editor&quot; pieces of software or<br/>inquire on the wind synth list you should be ale to learn more.  There<br/>is a VL programming tutorial online at the Internation Wind Synthesis<br/>web site which describes tuning an instrument.</p><p>IWSA (with links to wind list)   <a href="http://www.windsynth.org">http://www.windsynth.org</a></p><p>--<br/>Ewan Macpherson               &lt;<a href="mailto:emacpher@umich.edu">emacpher@umich.edu</a>&gt;<br/>               WWW Bagpipe Index<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emacpher/pipes.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emacpher/pipes.html</a></p></div>
