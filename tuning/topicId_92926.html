Similar to the way tempering just ratios to fit melodic<br/>purposes and transposition has its payoffs and downturns, so does the<br/>tempering of a timbre. You might end up with a dirty sounding timbre<br/>with consonant triads, as opposed to a pure tone with triads that<br/>make you cringe. Sometimes I prefer one to the other, and sometimes<br/>it&apos;s switched.&quot;</p><p>Why do tempered timbres tend to sound dirty? When I tune the harmonics<br/>of a sustained tone to something of medium accuracy such as 22-equal<br/>I hear a strange warbling in the sound which is reminiscent of<br/>beating but not quite the same. The impression of a single pitch is<br/>robust and no partials pop out as separate. Is it combination tones?</p><p>The warbling is alleviated or completely disappears when I introduce<br/>some bandwidth to the (tempered) harmonics &agrave; la PADsynth algorithm<br/>of Nasca Paul (ZynAddSubFX, PaulStretch). Why is this?</p><p>Kalle</p></div><h3><a id=92985 href="#92985">ðŸ”—</a>John Moriarty &#x3C;JlMoriart@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2010 7:15:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Why do tempered timbres tend to sound dirty?</p><p>To put it simply, we are cognitively biased towards integer relationships of pitch.</p><p>We can&apos;t really be sure why, but one could argue that it has to do with voice recognition. And perhaps our voices are harmonically related because harmonic overtones are in a pattern that is uncommon enough in nature to be desirable as a recognition tool, and is also easily emulated by simple means (like taught strings and air columns).</p><p>We are biased towards this pattern in that we recognize it most as a single tone with pitch, as opposed to a bunch of sine wave pitches heard in harmony or a &quot;noise&quot; with no discernible pitch. Something emitting an overtone series not anywhere close to harmonicity will tend to not to have any distinguishable pitch, but will still have an overall character (think clanging pots and pans or white noise). Some overtone series are imperfect, but still close enough to harmonicity to still have a recognizable pitch. These timbres will tend to have a different character with a less pure sounding tone. Here you can think of over-taught strings, some xylophones and marimbas, and our electronically mapped timbres.</p><p>I would like to point out, however, that some extremely inharmonic sounds can sound very cool indeed, even if they are not &quot;pure&quot; sounding. Each tuning&apos;s mapped timbre have a unique character to them, and I think that 5-edo and 7-edo mapped timbres sound pretty far out. There is virtually no clashing among partials and they sound spaced out, sort of airy.</p><p>&gt; The warbling is alleviated or completely disappears when I introduce<br/>&gt; some bandwidth to the (tempered) harmonics &agrave; la PADsynth algorithm<br/>&gt; of Nasca Paul (ZynAddSubFX, PaulStretch). Why is this?</p><p>This might have to do with the fact that pitch isn&apos;t the only thing that links partials together to create a timbre. The unity of partials in a timbre is also due, in smaller part, by phase, loudness, and some other factors I think. Have you read Sethares&apos; book &quot;Tuning Timbre Spectrum Scale&quot;? He talks about a lot of this sort of thing.</p><p>John M</p></div><h3><a id=92987 href="#92987">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2010 8:33:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Why do tempered timbres tend to sound dirty?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To put it simply, we are cognitively biased towards integer<br/>&gt; relationships of pitch.</p><p>Don&apos;t tell Bill.</p><p>&gt; We can&apos;t really be sure why, but one could argue that it has to<br/>&gt; do with voice recognition.</p><p>There are very good arguments in that direction.

I came across them while reading the medical<br/>literature for something totally different.</p><p>DPOAE&apos;s are the mysterious combination tones in the ear that everyone<br/>talks about, and apparently they&apos;ve been studied to the point that in<br/>audiology, they test for them in babies to make sure their hearing<br/>will work. The ideal frequency ratio for one of the distortion<br/>products to be at optimal volume, 2f1-f2 I believe, is about 11:9.<br/>There are other DPOAE&apos;s, but that&apos;s the one generally used in the<br/>test. I was reading some research talking about one of the other ones<br/>(2f2-f1), and it seemed like the ideal ratio for that one was going to<br/>be something like 10:11 in normal hearing range, but they didn&apos;t test<br/>below like 750 Hz. I stayed up late one night working it all out and<br/>got frustrated by the lack of answers and hence let it go.</p><p>If that&apos;s true though, then it would explain why intervals around the<br/>size of a neutral second have the peculiar resonance that they do, and<br/>why things like 9:10:11 or 10:11:12 do even more: you have a bunch of<br/>intervals right around the ideal size for 2f2-f1, and the outer dyad<br/>is right around the ideal size for 2f1-f2. And these are even-order<br/>distortion products, so instead of getting a difference tone of 1,<br/>you&apos;ll get like ...:6:7:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:... where successive<br/>harmonics are decreasing in volume and much, much lower than the<br/>originals (like 40 dB lower, so about 1/5 as loud).</p><p>They occur at the volume range of normal hearing (50-60 dB SPL I<br/>believe is where the test is done), and are considerably lower, so<br/>they don&apos;t really have an identity all their own, just serve to make<br/>the sound slightly more concordant and open it up a bit. So when<br/>Michael Sheiman is talking about difference tones around neutral<br/>seconds, he&apos;s probably talking about this. It also has something to do<br/>apparently with nonlinear effects right at the basilar membrane<br/>related to critical band interactions, which is where I jumped off the<br/>bus.</p><p>Anyway, once I realized how much I had to research to fully understand<br/>this I gave up, since it isn&apos;t really that critically important, but<br/>that was the theory I had. I had a huge thing written about it and<br/>never posted it, but since you bring it up I might as well mention it.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not entirely sure how these relate to the normal modes<br/>&gt; explanation that I mentioned earlier (and that Graham just<br/>&gt; mentioned; &quot;standing wave in one dimension&quot; of the system).</p><p>Nonlinearity isn&apos;t involved there, because when you first excite the<br/>pot/spring/tuning fork you&apos;re going to excite it with a waveform that<br/>ideally resembles something like an impulse. An ideal impulse would<br/>have a frequency response equal to exactly one for all frequencies,<br/>and then the instrument acts as a waveguide which acoustically filters<br/>the signal. Hence why strings will resonate sympathetically for only<br/>certain frequencies, but not others. The nodes at the end of a string<br/>cause reflections of the wave going up and down the string, which<br/>cancel out every frequency except the standing waves. This is not<br/>coincidentally correlated with the fact that an impulse train has a<br/>frequency response of an idealized comb filter (inelasticity at the<br/>nodes, I believe, is where the rolloff and damping comes from).</p><p>So in a sense, instruments behave like subtractive synthesizers,<br/>except instead of removing frequency content from a waveform like a<br/>sawtooth, they remove it from an impulse, in which all frequencies are<br/>present, ideally leaving only ones which are aligned in a harmonic<br/>series.</p><p>Nonlinear behavior for a tuning fork I think would arise when the tine<br/>moves so far that an additional compressive force starts to kick in<br/>for extreme deformations, thus destroying superposition. If you hold<br/>one edge of the vibrating tuning fork lightly against a table, it will<br/>chop off the motion of the wave, and hence you&apos;ll hear some kind of<br/>&quot;buzzing.&quot; This gets infinitely more complicated in ways that I don&apos;t<br/>fully understand, but that&apos;s the basic idea.</p><p>I just found this, too. Some good stuff can be found here:<br/><a href="http://paws.kettering.edu/~drussell/Publications/Rossing-Russell-Fork.pdf">http://paws.kettering.edu/~drussell/Publications/Rossing-Russell-Fork.pdf</a></p><p>I know that to really formalize this you need to understand something<br/>called a Volterra series, which I have never learned and which scare<br/>the hell out of me.

And perhaps our voices are harmonically<br/>&gt; related because harmonic overtones are in a pattern that is<br/>&gt; uncommon enough in nature to be desirable as a recognition tool,<br/>&gt; and is also easily emulated by simple means (like taught strings<br/>&gt; and air columns).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We are biased towards this pattern in that we recognize it most as<br/>&gt; a single tone with pitch, as opposed to a bunch of sine wave<br/>&gt; pitches heard in harmony or a &quot;noise&quot; with no discernible pitch.<br/>&gt; Something emitting an overtone series not anywhere close to<br/>&gt; harmonicity will tend to not to have any distinguishable pitch, but<br/>&gt; will still have an overall character (think clanging pots and pans<br/>&gt; or white noise). Some overtone series are imperfect, but still<br/>&gt; close enough to harmonicity to still have a recognizable pitch.<br/>&gt; These timbres will tend to have a different character with a less<br/>&gt; pure sounding tone. Here you can think of over-taught strings, some<br/>&gt; xylophones and marimbas, and our electronically mapped timbres.</p><p>Note that both strings and air columns have natural frequencies that<br/>diverge from a perfect harmonic series (because they aren&apos;t really<br/>one-dimensional) but they lock to perfect harmonic series when they<br/>are driven by a continuous excitation like bowing or blowing. When<br/>an electronic timbre with only approximate harmonics decays<br/>relatively rapidly it sounds quite normal, probably because we are<br/>used to hearing such sounds from plucked/struck string instruments.<br/>It&apos;s when that kind of timbre is sustained that it sounds a bit<br/>weird.</p><p>But as I said even for such sustained almost harmonic timbres the<br/>perception of pitch is robust.

Why<br/>&gt; &gt; is this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This might have to do with the fact that pitch isn&apos;t the only thing<br/>&gt; that links partials together to create a timbre. The unity of<br/>&gt; partials in a timbre is also due, in smaller part, by phase,<br/>&gt; loudness, and some other factors I think. Have you read Sethares&apos;<br/>&gt; book &quot;Tuning Timbre Spectrum Scale&quot;?

Loudness makes combination tones more audible so maybe<br/>when the there is some bandwidth in the harmonics and the energy is<br/>not so narrowly concentrated on the basilar membrane the nonlinear<br/>behaviour is reduced or masked.</p><p>Kalle</p></div><h3><a id=93019 href="#93019">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2010 9:53:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The electromechanical Hammonds weren&apos;t tuned to 12-tET, but to a rational approximation thereof.</p><p>From the Scala archive:</p><p>! hammond12.scl<br/>!<br/>Hammond organ scale, 1/1=277.0731707 Hz, A=440, see hammond.scl for the ratios<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 5494/5183<br/> 1435/1278<br/> 5658/4757<br/> 984/781<br/> 1517/1136<br/> 2009/1420<br/> 3936/2627<br/> 451/284<br/> 2747/1633<br/> 4428/2485<br/> 3485/1846<br/> 2/1</p></div><h3><a id=93020 href="#93020">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2010 12:00:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Cameron,</p><p>&gt; Gamelan are designed to beat,</p><p>Yes, that may very well be true.

The amplifier takes this value<br/>and spits out a new one for whatever pressure it is fed as input.<br/>Let&apos;s say its input-output function is called a(x).</p><p>Imagine if for any input, it feeds the same thing as output. This is<br/>hardly an amplifier at all, just a simple unity gain buffer. If you<br/>come up with a graph matching inputs to outputs, where inputs are the<br/>x axis, and outputs are the y axis. Every input value has a unique<br/>output value. Well, (1,1) is going to be a point on the resulting<br/>function, as is (2,2), and (3,3), and so on. In fact, any point on the<br/>line y=x will be there, so the graph will just look like a y=x graph,<br/>a line with slope 1. Which is hardly surprising, since I just defined<br/>the amplification function as output = input. Now let&apos;s say I have<br/>output = 2 * input. The graph will look like y=2x, and so on.</p><p>Let&apos;s now say that I make the input-output function something that is<br/>not a line Like abs(x). This means negative input values become<br/>positive output values, which is a full-wave rectifier. You now have a<br/>&quot;nonlinear&quot; response, which has, as you&apos;d expect, an input-output<br/>function that is not a line. This will end up actually generating new<br/>frequencies at the output in the form of intermodulation distortion<br/>and harmonic distortion. Harmonic distortion is intermodulation<br/>distortion occurring between a tone and itself (e.g. 2f is just the<br/>sum tone of f and f). The true definition of &quot;linearity&quot; just<br/>generalizes this to take into account phase shifts, filtering, etc and<br/>so on, which are still linear. Anything obeying the principle of<br/>superposition is linear.</p><p>Now let&apos;s say our input-output is something like arctan(x), or<br/>cuberoot(x) so that a huge, range of input values ends up producing a<br/>much smaller range of output values. For arctan(x), there&apos;s a finite<br/>output level that is reached as the input level goes to infinity,<br/>since arctan(12031029301923 psi) is pi/2. This would be a<br/>&quot;compressive&quot; nonlinear response, and is actually, in effect, soft<br/>clipping. If you sent a sine into this signal with an amplitude of<br/>1378014371438104380108741, it will just turn into a near-square wave<br/>with an amplitude of pi/2.</p><p>Active amplification without introducing nonlinearity, on the other<br/>hand, would be an active &quot;changing&quot; of the input-output function so<br/>that it&apos;s no longer a line of slope 1, but a line of slope 8000 when<br/>soft sounds are played, and a line of slope 0.03 when loud sounds are<br/>played. However, if you remember the generalization of linearity I<br/>mentioned before, then it means that linearity doesn&apos;t apply here.<br/>This actually is a technically nonlinear system anyway.</p><p>Actually, here&apos;s a pretty intuitive example of the two I just came up<br/>with: the difference between a nonlinear response and active<br/>amplification is the difference between clipping the waveform at a low<br/>amplitude and putting a compressor on it. Both limit the dynamic range<br/>of the waveform, but in different ways.</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1009/1009.2034v1.pdf">http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1009/1009.2034v1.pdf</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They claim to finally explain how the cochlea achieves the<br/>&gt; huge amplification it does. They explain the entire thing<br/>&gt; in terms you (Mike) are more likely to understand than me,<br/>&gt; but I&apos;m extremely impressed by this paper and suspect it<br/>&gt; will become a landmark in the field. The short answer to<br/>&gt; my is that the nonlinearity is nonlinearity of the cochlear<br/>&gt; amplifier.</p><p>In this paper, as I understand it, they are saying that the cochlear<br/>amplification system uses both: on the basilar membrane, at the peak<br/>frequency of the critical band, there&apos;s a compressive nonlinearity<br/>distorting the hell out of the hair bundle motion only at moderate<br/>amplitudes. At high amplitudes, this doesn&apos;t happen, and at low<br/>amplitudes, it also doesn&apos;t happen. This generates a ton of harmonics<br/>as far as the actual motion of the hair cell at that part of the<br/>critical band goes, but those harmonics would have to then reflect off<br/>of the hair and be emitted and received at higher pitches on the<br/>basilar membrane for us to hear them - the movement of a hair cell on<br/>the basilar membrane in a pattern that is not sinusoidal does not, in<br/>and of itself, change the timbre of what we&apos;re hearing. We do, but<br/>they&apos;re extremely quiet, and this is what DPOAE&apos;s are - when you have<br/>a compressive nonlinearity occuring at the peak of a critical band,<br/>and you place another frequency nearby such that this stimulates the<br/>same hair cell too, you have the hair cell being stimulated by two<br/>frequencies and exhibiting behavior and bam, combination tones. The<br/>behavior of the other, more important part of the cochlear amplifier<br/>might enhance this.</p><p>This nonlinearity occurs because forces in the ear at the hair cell<br/>literally act to stop the motion of the hair cell if it gets too loud,<br/>but then turn on &quot;completely&quot; to stop it as much as possible once the<br/>signal gets loud enough, and in the middle range, you have a situation<br/>where it&apos;s turning on only for the higher pressure values in the same<br/>wave, hence the nonlinear input-output mapping (or &quot;transfer<br/>function&quot;). This doesn&apos;t account for the ridiculous gain that is seen<br/>in mammalian cochlear amplification. The new discovery of this paper<br/>seems to be that at the forces acting to constrain the motion of the<br/>hair cell also cause an equal and opposite reaction on the basilar<br/>membrane itself, causing it to vibrate and essentially act as a<br/>speaker re-transmitting the sound. This then causes the hair cells<br/>corresponding to the sound to vibrate, and the individual hair bundles<br/>to contract and try to constrain its motion, which causes the entire<br/>basilar membrane vibrate and emit sound, which stimulates the hair<br/>cells, which make the entire basilar membrane vibrate and emit sounds,<br/>and so on through a very clever feedback mechanism that I want to<br/>immediately replicate and put on an acoustic guitar and sell under the<br/>name &quot;Dobro.&quot; It may also explain why sometimes the timbral quality of<br/>a sound becomes &quot;clearer&quot; at lower volumes.</p><p>The last thing I see in the paper is that this can be disabled by the<br/>outer hair cells: the outer hair cells are electromotile and can move<br/>in just such a way in response to the incoming waveform so as to<br/>absorb this feedback and nullify the basilar membrane response. They<br/>can apparently do this in a way that is frequency selective and<br/>nullifies high frequencies, thus making the basilar membrane more<br/>susceptible to feedback low frequencies.</p><p>That&apos;s what I got out of it, anyway. So DPOAE&apos;s occur at the critical<br/>band, the basilar membrane acts as a dobro guitar, outer hair cells<br/>serve to NULLIFY the feedback at the basilar membrane, and this<br/>feedback is occuring at the nonlinear range where hair bundle forces<br/>compressing the signal at the critical band (where DPOAE&apos;s are<br/>generated) are in sync with the waveform itself, causing the basilar<br/>membrane to occur.

That isn&apos;t true.  You<br/>can say that JI minimizes beats.  Dissonance is caused by roughness,<br/>which is what you get when beats get faster than a certain frequency<br/>(about 15 Hz).  Minimizing dissonance with a temperament is generally<br/>about getting clashes out of the roughness region and into the beating<br/>region.  You shouldn&apos;t be surprised if a temperament beats.

If you turn the knob to the<br/>right, and then you stop, although the absolute phase has been<br/>altered, the constant phase increment will stop, and the frequency<br/>will go back down.

A constant change in<br/>delay time is also equivalent to a change in frequency. That is, if<br/>you keep decreasing the delay of a signal at a constant rate, that&apos;s<br/>the same thing as just playing it more slowly (and hence decreasing<br/>the pitch slightly).</p><p>So a flanger takes a signal and copies it, and then keeps modulating<br/>the delay time of the second sample. This means that the second sample<br/>is going to be played at a slower speed briefly as it keeps getting<br/>delayed and delayed at a constant rate, and then once it reaches some<br/>maximum deviation it&apos;s going to be played at a faster rate to catch<br/>back up (this is a negative delay), and then so on.</p><p>However, maybe it doesn&apos;t make sense to call it a &quot;flanger&quot; if you<br/>just modulate the phase of a single note and not double the original.<br/>The point is you&apos;re going to hear weird sorts of effects happening as<br/>partials drift in and out of tune with one another, which may very<br/>well sound something like a flanger (or perhaps a phaser).</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
