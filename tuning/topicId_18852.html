Wow.  Why don&apos;t they teach these<br/>&gt;&gt; important concepts in music school??&quot;</p><p>Daniel Wolf:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Inertia. They don&apos;t call them conservatories for nothing.</p><p>A _fantastic_ quote, Dan -- is it yours?<br/>To paraphrase Partch:<br/>  &quot;The intelligent and creative student will not<br/>   have to be thrown out of the conservatory because<br/>   he will not be there in the first place.&quot;</p><p>&gt; You know, this does seem a little peculiar, though.  If all these<br/>&gt; systems were in existence in the past, what happened to them?  How<br/>&gt; did they all get thrown out so completely and 12-tET iron over<br/>&gt; everything??  It seems a bit exceptional...</p><p>HO!!! Don&apos;t get me started!!! Look down, yes you! Look down<br/>at your console keyboard! What do you see??</p><p> QWERTYUIOP<br/>  ...<br/>or</p><p>&apos;,.PYFGCRL/=<br/> AOEUIDHTNS-<br/>  :QJKXBMWZ</p><p>Based on a guess, I&apos;d say that on this tuning<br/>list, an unusually large number of us including<br/>myself see the latter - the Dvorak layout. Where<br/>in case you didn&apos;t notice AEIOU is under your left<br/>hand home position and the most common letters<br/>used in the English language are there, efficiently<br/>placed under your right finger&apos;s home position. Which<br/>is vastly, demonstrably, empirically superior in<br/>every way. And only took me a few days to get<br/>completely used to.</p><p>Anyway, you will NEVER get rid of QWERTYUIOP<br/>just like you&apos;ll never get rid of seven white<br/>plus five black (invented in when -- 1200 AD on<br/>a drawbar organ?)</p><p>* &quot;That&apos;s the way we&apos;ve always done it!&quot;<br/>* &quot;It would be too much trouble to switch over!&quot;<br/>* &quot;We have too much invested in this system<br/>   to do it any other way!&quot;<br/>* &quot;You&apos;re new around here, aren&apos;t you?&quot;<br/>* &quot;Grasshopper, when you have learned<br/>   in perfection mastery of /the way/<br/>   of our discipline, you will have<br/>   the understanding to make changes.<br/>   Until then remember that I am the<br/>   master and you the disciple.&quot;<br/>* &quot;I have a PhD and therefore I am<br/>   right and I don&apos;t have to explain<br/>   why because I don&apos;t have time to<br/>   talk as slowly as you would<br/>   require to understand.&quot;<br/>* &quot;Have you been to divinity school?<br/>   Well the pastor has and so I think<br/>   it&apos;s obvious he knows more about the<br/>   Bible than you do so stop asking<br/>   questions and accept what he says.<br/>   God wouldn&apos;t have put the pastor in a<br/>   position of authority if He didn&apos;t<br/>   want us to submit to it.&quot;</p><p>Sound familiar? It should if you have ever<br/>talked to anyone about music, tuning, typographical<br/>and musical keyboard layouts, or worked at<br/>any job or university in the world and tried<br/>to get anything to change no matter how<br/>logical and sensible it is -- there are<br/>just too many sacred cows in _all_ our organizations<br/>and bureaucracies to do otherwise.</p><p>But -- we still have to smash the golden bovine<br/>idols! And do it with modesty, soft-spokenness<br/>and a knowing, gentle smile! :)</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=18883 href="#18883">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/17/2001 7:59:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;j scott&quot; &lt;xjscott@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_18852.html#18852">/tuning/topicId_18852.html#18852</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; HO!!!
