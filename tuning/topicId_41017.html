The new version is endowed<br/>with a new and more flexible oscillator design (see below for<br/>more details). The URL for downloads is the following (this will<br/>connect you to the main page - just click on the &quot;Files&quot; link you<br/>find on the left once the main page has loaded):</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/16tone">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/16tone</a></p><p>Release notes and description:</p><p>VET-1 version 2.0.1 - freeware softsynth for Pluggo 3 Runtime<br/>(Mac)<br/>Release notes for version 2.0.1</p><p>New features:</p><p>- morphing oscillator synthesis architecture with many additional<br/>single-cycle waveforms, including edited samples generated<br/>with vintage analog and digital synthesizers, for a total of 88<br/>basic waveforms plus 2 user-editable morphing waveforms;<br/>- 5 new presets.</p><p>VET-1 description:</p><p>12-voice polyphonic VST-MAS-RTAS morphing oscillator<br/>wavetable synthesizer plug-in for Cycling &apos;74 Pluggo 3 Runtime,<br/>featuring dynamic voice allocation, 88 basic single-cycle<br/>waveforms and 2 user-editable morphing waveforms. Includes a<br/>tuning selector for any integer or fractional equal division of the<br/>octave (EDO) in the 5-98 EDO range and an &quot;EDO warp LFO&quot;<br/>feature that can be used to modulate the octave divisor in order<br/>to obtain special detuning effects (&quot;variable temperament&quot;). It<br/>responds to MIDI note-on/off, pitch-bend and modulation wheel<br/>data.</p><p>Morphing Oscillator Synthesis:</p><p>Morphing oscillators widely extend the timbral possibilities<br/>offered by the 88 basic waveforms by means of two independent<br/>waveform &quot;morphers&quot;. Once you select MORPH1 or MORPH2 as<br/>a waveform for an oscillator, you then choose a source and a<br/>target waveforms and a morphing amount percentage: this<br/>allows for the creation of an intermediate waveform whose<br/>shape is an hybrid between the source and the target waveform<br/>shapes. When the morphing amount percentage is set to 0% or<br/>100% no morphing will occur and the MORPH waveform will<br/>reproduce the source or the target waveform respectively; the<br/>higher the morphing amount, the closer you get to the target<br/>waveform shape.</p><p>Sincerely yours,<br/>Victor Cerullo</p></div>
