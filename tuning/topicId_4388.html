<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>recent Rothenberg</h1><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/1999 8:14:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John Chalmers...</p><p>&gt;Two of the more difficult, but extremely valuable, parts of Rothenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt;model are the concepts of &quot;blur&quot; and &quot;range&quot; which deal with scalar<br/>&gt;inflections in performance. The range of an individual note is the<br/>&gt;amount of variation it can exhibit without changing the propriety of the<br/>&gt;scale (or its equivalence class, IIRC). Blur is the amount ALL the notes<br/>&gt;can vary without changing the apparent gestalt of the scale. Needless to<br/>&gt;say, the computations and theory are more complex than propriety,<br/>&gt;sufficient sets and efficiency.</p><p>Yes, it is cool the R. worked all this out.  Unfortunately, the<br/>computations are beyond me, at least for the time being.  My next area of<br/>interest will actually be the graph and node stuff, which attempts to<br/>explain chromaticism.</p><p>That, and I&apos;d like to do a rigorous search for all 5-10 tone scales in all<br/>ET&apos;s from 21-41 with high Stability and Efficiency.  I think my PC is<br/>actually powerful enough to do it in a reasonable time...</p><p>&gt;I should mention that there has never been a rigorous test of David<br/>&gt;Rothenberg&apos;s models, though Connie Chang did some elementary tests for a<br/>&gt;Masters at Princeton in the late 60&apos;s or early 70&apos;s.</p><p>John- do you have these materials?</p><p>Paul Erlich...</p><p>&gt;This is a particularly interesting point; Rothenberg would assume that any<br/>&gt;interval, not just the octave, can function as an interval of equivalence if<br/>&gt;the scale is symmetrical at that interval. This is quite the opposite of<br/>&gt;supposing an acoustical foundation for octave equivalence.</p><p>Whether you use this language to refer to Rothenberg the man, or to his<br/>model, I don&apos;t think it is accurate.  Nowhere have I found Rothenberg to<br/>ignore the importance of acoustics in the phenomena he was trying to model.</p><p>In fact I believe he has paid more attention than just about anybody.  His<br/>stuff is full with cautionary remarks about the effects of acoustics-- it<br/>may be said that his goal is to model everything but acoustics, in such a<br/>way that acoustics can then be added in.  Which seems to me like a better<br/>approach than what had come before him in 200 years of music theory.  And<br/>unlike the Babbit and other serialist theory I have read, I think he was<br/>sucessful in describing the acoustic-independent, and it seems you agree...</p><p>&gt;However, there is clearly an &quot;ambiguity of tonal function&quot; between the<br/>block-&gt;equivalent notes in any symmetrical scale.</p><p>-C.</p></div>
