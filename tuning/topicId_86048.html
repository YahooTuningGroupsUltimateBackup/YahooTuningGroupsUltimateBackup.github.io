You can use all that derivative effort on your own material. In my opinion it&apos;s more easy to make new piece than try to derive something from the finished one.</p><p>There could be only few artistic reasons and ways how to use foreign material: quotation, collage, traditional variation or some kind or structural processing of musical or audio elements - rearranging, re-instrumentation, re-voicing, re-harmonization, restructuring, re-texturing, decomposition, atomisation, retrograde, layering, heavy filtration, ring modulation, superposition, vocoding, retuning and many others.... And what&apos;s important for such use - original material must still be recognizable, otherwise it&apos;s senseless and better to use your own material. I composed more such variations, but authors can&apos;t protest, they are dead few hundred years :-)</p><p>And as for the law, there&apos;s a simple rule: I suppose you need an approval from author (if living) or from his  heirs (70 or 50 years after his death, differs by countries) when you want to use his material. There was some rule concerning allowed length in bars which could be used without approval, some time ago, but I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s still valid, as sometimes three notes melodic cell or motif, or some typical rhythm, or even one second sound, sample or sound effect is recognizable. Here it depends on internal structure of music, style, and context, and in the case of prosecution it will be judged by experts. Theoretically you can have problem even with one short, very typical sound sample or sound effect.</p><p>But this is interesting field. For example what if somebody uses a famous 12tone row used before and make from it totally new original composition? Or what about some very typical timbre, or combination of instruments used before? Or some rough formal idea, like those which Ives used in The Unanswered Question, Ravel in Bolero or Cage in 4&apos;33&quot;? But I suppose no artist with some brain will want to use such idea again....</p><p>On 6 Feb 2010, at 7:47 PM, Sarn Ursell wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have some questions for you microtuners.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do know that laws differ from country to country as to copyright &gt; rules and regulations, but what I need to know is what the rules &gt; are for DRASTICALLY altering someone else&apos;s composition by &gt; mangleing and microtuneing it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In SCALA, you see, I played around with the retune MIDI file &gt; feature as explained to my by Mr.Warren Burt, with other&apos;s 12ET &gt; MIDI files which I had mangled severly, and in some cases, I had &gt; even gone as far as to mangle the resultant *.wavs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Look, a QALITIVE analysis as done by a panel of &quot;experts&quot;, might &gt; have these &quot;experts&quot; rate the similarity of two peices, a mangled &gt; and derived microtonal peice as to compared with the origional 12ET &gt; peice, on a scale of 1 to 1000, with 1000 being EXACTLY the same, 0 &gt; being TOTALLY different and 500 being somewhat similar.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is quite easily done and it is pretty straightfoward, but it &gt; IS subject to personal interpretation and opinion.</p><p>I don&apos;t think.

Section 107<br/>also sets out four factors to be considered in determining whether or not a<br/>particular use is fair:</p><p>   1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of<br/>      commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes<br/>      2. The nature of the copyrighted work<br/>      3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to<br/>      the copyrighted work as a whole<br/>      4.

Yes, it was used in<br/>&gt; musicology to find percentage of identity/similarity , but we humans<br/>&gt; with some musical knowledge can judge music diferent and more easy<br/>&gt; and quick way, from the semantic context - let&apos;s leave 0&apos;s and 1&apos;s to<br/>&gt; stupid computers. We can use common sense and higher level of musical<br/>&gt; language.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sarn says:More kind of like a statistical analysis of content and<br/>&gt; proportion 1&apos;s and 0&apos;s and proportion of groups of 1&apos;s and 0&apos;s to find the<br/>&gt; content of the music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each song should have it&apos;s own signature of proportion of 1 and 0 groups.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This may be a good quantative method of finding similarity between songs,<br/>&gt; but the amount of information generated when doing this is HUGE, (more than<br/>&gt; there are particles in the Universe...).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------<br/>&gt; Yahoo!7: Catch-up on your favourite Channel 7 TV shows easily, legally, and<br/>&gt; for free at PLUS7.
