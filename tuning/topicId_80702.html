First 1:2 IS the octave, not 1.618 which is close<br/>to a min 6. Second, Pythagoras didn&apos;t &quot;invent&quot; it and it<br/>wasn&apos;t &quot;thought up&quot; but it is the name given to the first overtone<br/>(2nd harmonic), which is a fact of nature and wave theory. &quot;using 2<br/>as the octave all the overtones<br/>&gt; clash (this, I think, was the one major flawed assumption in Petr&apos;s<br/>&gt; Golden Ratio scale).  This scale completely disobeys the &quot;rational<br/>&gt; numbered fraction&quot; type rules which govern Pythagorean-type<br/>scales.&quot; On the one hand you say &quot;the overtones clash&quot; when you apply<br/>the octave. But since the octave IS an overtone, you are therefore<br/>admitting the validity of overtones by deciding whether they &quot;clash&quot;<br/>or not as a standard against which to measure. Then,just to further<br/>compound your self contradictions, you say &quot;it disobeys the rational<br/>numbered fraction type rule which govern Pythagorean type scales&quot;.<br/>However, rational numbered fractions are not specific to Pythagorean<br/>scales. They apply to all periodic waves without exception of which<br/>there are infinitely many. You appeal to the fact that the Greeks<br/>used the golden proportion in architecture as a defense of your scale<br/>yet deny the fact that Pythagoras&apos; discovery of the harmonic series<br/>gave birth to the entire field of music-maths.<br/>But at the end of the day, what has the Golden mean really got to do<br/>with music? First we have 1:1.618. Then 1.618: 1.618 squared, the<br/>1.618 squared: 1.618 cubed and so on ad infinitum. Or to apply it<br/>another way, from a C=1 we get 1.618 up giving approx G# and 0.618<br/>down giving approx an E below. This is an out of tune augmented<br/>triad. But musical harmony already comes with its own recursive<br/>augmented triad, 2 power 1/3 up and 2 power -1/3 down. (Now try using<br/>1.618 to the power of...What, can&apos;t find any meaning for it??).</p><p>&quot;high prestige&quot; Rick</p></div><h3><a id=80900 href="#80900">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2009 12:14:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl~<br/>the Parthenon is based on the golden ratio, the author does not disprove this. one can draw it without math by an arc from the half of a square.<br/>-- /^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p></div><h3><a id=80902 href="#80902">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2009 12:18:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The  golden ratio works because you have equal beat triads which is true of all recurrent Sequences.
