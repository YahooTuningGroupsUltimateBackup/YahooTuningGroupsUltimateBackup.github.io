Though I was previously posting only from my office, I wanted to<br/>participate from home as well, so I signed up through my roommate&apos;s computer.</p><p>&gt; &lt;&lt;OK, Marion, give us an example of a dissonant interval whose odd limit is<br/>&gt; 3.&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How about 65536/59040</p><p>That reduces to 2048/1845, which has an odd limit of 1845, not 3.</p><p>&gt; or 256/243.</p><p>That has an odd limit of 243, not 3.</p><p>&gt;  Face it, limits are pretty useless at<br/>&gt; predicting the consonance of individual intervals.

But in your<br/>previous message you spoke against both prime and odd limits.

The prime limit of a tuning system tells you the most<br/>complex interval you need to be able to tune in order to tune up the whole system.<br/>That&apos;s useful for what it is, and LCM is useful for something else.</p><p>&gt; &lt;&lt;Again, Marion, you are making the mistake of assuming that all these<br/>&gt; pitches will be measured against the 1/1.

I think the fact that 3<br/>&gt; limit scales do poorly on this measure when compared to 5-limit scales is one<br/>&gt; of the major reasons the 5-limit concept has prevailed.</p><p>Marion -- this discussion was about styles in which only 3-(odd) limit intervals<br/>were considered consonant. Of course, once 5-limit intervals were accepted as<br/>consonant, the tuning of the scales needed to be tweaked in order to increase the<br/>total number of consonant intervals. This led to developments such as schismatic<br/>tuning and meantone temperament, which you can read more about in Margo Schulter&apos;s<br/>paper (and I recommend you do!) But before that, only fifths and fourths were used<br/>as consonances in the music and other intervals were used as dissonances. To apply<br/>your criterion of maximizing the number of 5-limit consonant intervals would be a<br/>terrible anachronism if applied to Western music c. 900-1200.</p><p>&gt; &lt;&lt;<br/>&gt; People,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just because ratios are being used to measure pitches relative to a fixed<br/>&gt; 1/1, doesn&apos;t mean the harmonic<br/>&gt; properties of those ratios have ANYTHING to do with music constructed with<br/>&gt; those pitches.

Of<br/>&gt; course it could also be that the rest of us don&apos;t understand something that<br/>&gt; you do, but as of now, I am leaning toward the first hypothesis.</p><p>I beseech you to consider again what I said, in the context in which I said it.<br/>That context was you claiming certain Pythagorean ratios could be better considered<br/>as 19-limit ratios. If the Pythagorean scale were used against a drone at 1/1, then<br/>indeed the ratio representing each pitch would tell you the harmonic interval it<br/>produced, and I agree with you that 256:243 and 729:512 are far too complex to<br/>really be a &quot;target&quot; for a harmonic interval.</p><p>But this whole discussion was in response to your claim that Pythagorean tuning was<br/>never really used, or doesn&apos;t represent a valid model for the tuning of any real<br/>music. In Medieval times in Europe, however, music did not consist of a drone<br/>against which all other pitches were played. Music was polyphonic, consisting at<br/>first of lines in parallel fourths and fifths, and later of independent lines where<br/>fouths and fifths (and octaves) functioned as the consonant intervals and were<br/>often approached by contrary motion. In this context, your 19-limit ratios for some<br/>pitches could only worsen the consonant intervals, while having an effect on some<br/>dissonant intervals that would probably be rather unimportant but might at worst<br/>hinder their ability to function as dissonances.</p><p>Both of our criteria for choosing scales are valid ones, albeit in different<br/>musical contexts. All I&apos;m trying to demonstrate to you is that there was in fact a<br/>place in musical history/geography where Pythagorean tuning makes the most sense as<br/>a model for what musicians were doing. I was disappointed that after my previous<br/>attempts to do this, you proceeded to analyze the scale in ways which are not<br/>relevant to the style in question.</p><p>&gt; In  music that would mean that a scale is a means of describing what a<br/>&gt; musician is doing, not a means of telling him what to do.</p><p>I fully agree with that philosophy! When 5-limit intervals did start being used as<br/>consonances in the 15th century, theorists were still clinging to the Pythagorean<br/>scale and were out of date. It took them some time to catch up with what musicians<br/>were doing, but when they did, they had useful contributions to make, e.g. in the<br/>field of tuning keyboard instruments.</p><p>But prior to that, in the Gothic period, a music flourished that sounds very<br/>strange to modern ears. In that music thirds and sixths were not consonant but<br/>dissonant. Many of the progressions from that era sound backwards to me, a musician<br/>who grew up with and practices triadic harmony. As far as tuning is concerned, our<br/>best hope of understanding the music of this era, and by understanding I mean all<br/>the ineffable types of &quot;knowledge&quot; that are involved in appreciating a work of art,<br/>is to use Pythagorean tuning, since it makes all the intervals that functioned as<br/>consonances as consonant as possible, it makes all other intervals dissonant, in<br/>accord with their function, and it represents the way fixed-pitch instruments were<br/>in fact tuned according to virtually all accounts from the time. We will never be<br/>able to fully divorce ourselves from the triadic environment in which we were<br/>brought up. But using the appropriate tuning may at least help us to partially do<br/>so.</p><p>Margo Schulter has suggested 17-tET as a &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; tuning. Using this tuning<br/>for Gothic music may help to overcompensate for our modern, 5-limit listening<br/>tendencies. The thirds and sixths generanted by the 17-tET fifth have no<br/>simple-ratio approximations and would function more clearly as dissonances, while<br/>the mistuning of the 17-tET fifth itself is less than 4 cents, i.e., fairly<br/>undetectable.</p></div>
