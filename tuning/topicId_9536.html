If so, how long did you wait<br/>before you received the book?</p><p>I mailed my check to them almost three months ago.  I&apos;m beginning to think<br/>I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t order more than just this book and another one.  I&apos;d be<br/>pretty unhappy if I ordered, say, $100 worth of CDs or something from them.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Paolo</p></div>
