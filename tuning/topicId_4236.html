Comment as you will!</p><p>&gt; But I find that<br/>&gt; this explanation helps make the whole thing much clearer.<br/>&gt; Hope it helps the rest of you who are struggling with<br/>&gt; this.  Keep reading the Wilson Archives at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There may be stuff in this post that is just plain wrong<br/>&gt; - corrections are appreciated.<br/>&gt; ************************************************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MOS stands for &quot;Moment of Symmetry&quot; (a really<br/>&gt; lovely title), and was discovered in the<br/>&gt; 1960s by Erv Wilson.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/mos.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/mos.html</a><br/>&gt; is the letter describing MOS.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first thing to take note of is that<br/>&gt; Wilson always uses his theories and<br/>&gt; diagrams to depict ideas of complete<br/>&gt; generality.  He will sometimes use specific<br/>&gt; ratios in his beautiful mandala-like<br/>&gt; lattice diagrams, but it is always<br/>&gt; assumed that they can representent any<br/>&gt; kind of set of anything.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The idea behind MOS is that it links<br/>&gt; together two different ways we listen<br/>&gt; to or perceive music:</p><p>I think (in my opinion) that Wilson is only concerned with<br/>melodic scale archetypes. MOS as an Archetype is another music<br/>shaping dynamic in contrast to harmonic. He has stated that any<br/>tuning systems is a compromise between the two.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) the sonance of the interval (i.e.,<br/>&gt;     its harmonicity).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) how many scale degrees the intervals<br/>&gt;     subtend (Wilson&apos;s word, I think;<br/>&gt;     it kind of means &quot;passes over&quot;<br/>&gt;     or &quot;is divided into&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Harmonic listening is bound to force one<br/>&gt; to think in terms of ratios, while scalar<br/>&gt; listening encourages thinking in terms<br/>&gt; of &quot;steps&quot; (unequal or equal).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the diatonic scale, all &quot;5th&quot;s are fixed<br/>&gt; to the perception of a 3/2 (what Wilson calls<br/>&gt; the &quot;3-function&quot;), except for the last one<br/>&gt; (the &quot;tritone&quot;).</p><p>I&apos;m curious where you got this one!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The &quot;3rd&quot;s are fixed to the &quot;5-function&quot;,<br/>&gt; but not as rigidly as the &quot;5th&quot;s are to 3/2:<br/>&gt; the &quot;3rd&quot;s may be either &quot;major&quot; (5/4)<br/>&gt; or &quot;minor&quot;(6/5).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; His concept of MOS gives us a neat diatonic<br/>&gt; way of relating the two modes of listening.<br/>&gt; Now on to the details . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MOS assumes octave-equivalency, and is<br/>&gt; based on a linear mapping of notes, for<br/>&gt; example, a Pythagorean JI system (open),<br/>&gt; or 12-(or other-)Eq (closed).  It has<br/>&gt; 2 basic intervals: one called a &quot;generator&quot;<br/>&gt; and another which acts as octave-reducer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The generator is an interval which is<br/>&gt; cycled thru at more-or-less the same size,</p><p>In a true MOS all the intervals are the same size. Otherwise<br/>he refers to them as constant structures.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; to create all the different notes in the<br/>&gt; system (for instance, a &quot;5th&quot;; we need not<br/>&gt; specify the tuning).  The octave-reducer<br/>&gt; is typically 2/1, as in most music theories.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m deliberately going to fudge the<br/>&gt; discrepancy between JI and ET in this<br/>&gt; description - trust me, it will make<br/>&gt; things easier.  Start by imagining a circle . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (You should draw it yourself on paper as<br/>&gt; I describe it - that helps a lot to<br/>&gt; understanding it.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;I&apos;ll wait, go get your pencil . . .&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, start by drawing a circle to represent<br/>&gt; the octave, 1/1 at the top (12 o&apos;clock).<br/>&gt; We&apos;ll use approximate clock positions just<br/>&gt; to keep things simple.  Just put a tick<br/>&gt; mark on the circumference of the circle<br/>&gt; and label it for each note as we progress.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first &quot;5th&quot; takes us to 3/2, 7 o&apos;clock<br/>&gt; the second &quot;5th&quot; to 9/8, 2 o&apos;clock<br/>&gt; the third &quot;5th&quot; to 27/16, 9 o&apos;clock<br/>&gt; the fourth &quot;5th&quot; to 81/64, 4 o&apos;clock . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hell, let&apos;s switch to prime-factor notation,<br/>&gt; and give them the typical musical letter-names<br/>&gt; too.  So, that&apos;s:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    C  3^ 0 at 12:00<br/>&gt;    G  3^ 1 at  7:00<br/>&gt;    D  3^ 2 at  2:00<br/>&gt;    A  3^ 3 at  9:00<br/>&gt; Fb/E  3^ 4 at  4:00<br/>&gt; Cb/B  3^ 5 at 11:00<br/>&gt; Gb/F# 3^ 6 at  6:00<br/>&gt; Db/C# 3^ 7 at  1:00<br/>&gt; Ab/G# 3^ 8 at  8:00<br/>&gt; Eb/D# 3^ 9 at  3:00<br/>&gt; Bb/A# 3^10 at 10:00<br/>&gt; F /E# 3^11 at  5:00<br/>&gt; C /B# 3^12 at 12:00,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which means we&apos;ve completed the cycle<br/>&gt; if we&apos;re in 12-Eq (or its Pythagorean<br/>&gt; near-miss).  (But this process can be<br/>&gt; carried out much further, and Wilson<br/>&gt; did . . .)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, here&apos;s my definition of Moment<br/>&gt; of Symmetry (MOS):  it&apos;s when every<br/>&gt; &quot;link&quot; in the chain *subtends the same<br/>&gt; number of steps*, even if the last link</p><p>He calls the last link, the disjunction</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; is not exactly the same size as the others.<br/>&gt; I can only illustrate by way of our circle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first example doesn&apos;t have to be drawn -<br/>&gt; it&apos;s trivial.  It would be a chain of 2 links,<br/>&gt; going from C 3^0 (12:00) to G 3^1 (7:00) and<br/>&gt; back again.  The only notes in the system<br/>&gt; are C and G.  Obviously 2 is a MOS, because<br/>&gt; each link subtends 1 &quot;step&quot;.  The 1st step<br/>&gt; is a &quot;5th&quot;, (to 7:00) and the 2nd step is a<br/>&gt; &quot;4th&quot;, bringing us back to the origin C (12:00)<br/>&gt; or &quot;octave&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re clever, you should have the idea<br/>&gt; already.  If not, like me, go ahead and<br/>&gt; draw each example as I describe it.<br/>&gt; (Draw that last one if you need to.)<br/>&gt; Remember that &quot;step&quot; only refers to the<br/>&gt; *number of steps in, and the specific<br/>&gt; steps derived from, THAT division*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;ll have to draw many circles now, one<br/>&gt; for each division, to discover which ones<br/>&gt; are a MOS and which are not.  Do that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The division into 3 goes like this:<br/>&gt; 1st link C 3^0 (12:00) to G 3^1 (7:00).<br/>&gt; 2nd link G 3^1 ( 7:00) to D 3^2 (2:00).<br/>&gt; 3rd link D 3^2 ( 2:00) back to C 3^0 (12:00).<br/>&gt; Thus our system is made up of C, D, and G.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 1st link subtends 2 steps: C-D and D-G.<br/>&gt; The 2nd link subtends 2 steps: G-C and C-D.<br/>&gt; The 3rd link subtends 2 steps: D-G and G-C.<br/>&gt; Therefore 3 is also a MOS.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Division into 4:<br/>&gt; 1st link C 3^0 (12:00) to G 3^1 (7:00).<br/>&gt; 2nd link G 3^1 ( 7:00) to D 3^2 (2:00).<br/>&gt; 3rd link D 3^2 ( 2:00) to A 3^3 (9:00).<br/>&gt; 4th link A 3^3 ( 9:00) back to C 3^0 (12:00).<br/>&gt; Our system is made up of C, D, G, and A.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1st link subtends 2 steps: C-D and D-G.<br/>&gt; 2nd link subtends 3 steps: G-A, A-C, and C-D.<br/>&gt; 3rd link subtends 2 steps: D-G and G-A.<br/>&gt; 4th link subtends 1 step:  A-C.<br/>&gt; The steps sizes are not all the same,<br/>&gt; so 4 is *not* a MOS.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Division into 5:<br/>&gt; 1st link C 3^0 (12:00) to G 3^1 (7:00).<br/>&gt; 2nd link G 3^1 ( 7:00) to D 3^2 (2:00).<br/>&gt; 3rd link D 3^2 ( 2:00) to A 3^3 (9:00).<br/>&gt; 4th link A 3^3 ( 9:00) to E 3^4 (4:00).<br/>&gt; 5th link E 3^4 ( 4:00) back to C 3^0 (12:00).<br/>&gt; Our system is made up of C, D, E, G, and A.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1st link subtends 3 steps: C-D, D-E, and E-G.<br/>&gt; 2nd link subtends 3 steps: G-A, A-C, and C-D.<br/>&gt; 3rd link subtends 3 steps: D-E, E-G, and G-A.<br/>&gt; 4th link subtends 3 steps: A-C, C-D, and D-E.<br/>&gt; 5 is a MOS.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll skip the rest - you can draw them yourself.<br/>&gt; 6 is *not* a MOS,<br/>&gt; 7 is a MOS,<br/>&gt; 8, 9, 10, and 11 are *not* a MOS,<br/>&gt; 12 is a MOS.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Scales below 5 notes are considered<br/>&gt; insignificant, so I will use Wilson&apos;s notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For positive mapping, that is, a system that<br/>&gt; has &quot;5th&quot;s that are 3/2s [= 702.0 cents] or<br/>&gt; wider, you get a MOS at<br/>&gt; (1, 2, 3,) 5, 7, 12, 17, 29, and 41.<br/>&gt; These include the following ETs:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; #degrees  size of &quot;5th&quot; in cents<br/>&gt;   17        706<br/>&gt;   29        703<br/>&gt;   41        702.4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For negative mapping, a system with &quot;5th&quot;s<br/>&gt; narrower than a 3/2, we get a MOS at<br/>&gt; (1, 2, 3,) 5, 7, 12, 19, and 31.<br/>&gt; These include the following ETs:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; #degrees  size of &quot;5th&quot; in cents<br/>&gt;   12        700<br/>&gt;   19        695<br/>&gt;   31        697<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Scales with more than 41 are not considered<br/>&gt; necessary (I can&apos;t remember why now -<br/>&gt; ask Lumma).</p><p>I know Wilson does&apos;t think so!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s MOS.<br/>&gt; ------------------<br/>&gt; A little further on in your study of Wilson,<br/>&gt; you&apos;ll find that in his article &quot;On the<br/>&gt; Development of Intonational Systems by Extended<br/>&gt; Linear Mapping&quot; he recommends taking advantage<br/>&gt; of the fact that the 12-tone scale allows<br/>&gt; us to perceive either positive or negative<br/>&gt; mapping, to switch from the current negative<br/>&gt; mapping to one which is positive and<br/>&gt; &quot;acoustically advantageous&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He only discusses the cultural imprinting<br/>&gt; of the dual mapping on our consciousness in<br/>&gt; relation to the 12-tone scale, but it seems<br/>&gt; to me that dual mapping would already be<br/>&gt; ingrained from the previous historical use<br/>&gt; of both the 5-tone and 7-tone scales, both<br/>&gt; of which are MOS in both mappings.  (I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not sure tho - I&apos;d have to explore it a lot<br/>&gt; more.  Maybe you can see it.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Monzo<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>------------------------------------------------</p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>Get the Internet just the way you want it.<br/>Free software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!<br/>Try Juno Web: <a href="http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj">http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj</a>.</p></div>
