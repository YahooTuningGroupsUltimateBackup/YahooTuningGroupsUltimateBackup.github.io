But there has been a tendency for<br/>theorists on this list, and I am not immune, to say stuff like &quot;higher<br/>values are better&quot;, or &quot;I like this more&quot;.  Better for what?  Why do you<br/>like it more?  I think theorists have a responsibility to say.  Science<br/>ought to make its point without a lot of sales pitch.  This is why I like<br/>Wilson&apos;s work so much.  He just lays it down.</p><p>C.</p></div>
