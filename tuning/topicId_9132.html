<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>high third sound examples</h1><h3>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2000 4:51:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>As some of you have requested, I have compiled a series of sound files that<br/>will (I hope) help you understand what I mean by &quot;high third.&quot; These are all<br/>mp3 files because they are only about a quarter the size of equivalent .wav<br/>files. Each one is about 550k and downloads in about a minute with a 56k<br/>modem. If anyone is interested in getting the .wav (or other) formats, I&apos;ll<br/>be happy to email them directly (since these would put me way over my web<br/>site limit).</p><p>In these examples, the root and/or fifth were played on my M-1 (using &quot;solo<br/>sax&quot;) and recorded in analog to Logic Audio on separate tracks. The thirds<br/>are sung on an additional track while listening to the played pitches<br/>through headphones. These individual tracks were then variously &quot;mixed&quot; to<br/>create the aiff (is that right?) files that were then translated to mp3 for<br/>posting.</p><p>Needless to say, please excuse my 65 year old diaphragm as it attempted to<br/>hold the pitch as close to &quot;steady&quot; as possible. I started to edit out all<br/>the blips, but it got a little crazy time-wise. I think it will serve to at<br/>least give you the idea, and at best will provide enough data for those who<br/>may wish to translate all of this to numbers. (I truly hope Paul will resist<br/>calling it &quot;a mess.&quot; :-)</p><p>The first file &lt;<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Rt-lo3.mp3">http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Rt-lo3.mp3</a>&gt; simply<br/>demonstrates where I hear the 4:5 third in relation to a sounding root. When<br/>I listened again later, it sounded a little sharp in spots, but I think its<br/>pretty close. (I didn&apos;t measure this or any others objectively.)</p><p>The next file &lt;<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Rt-5th-lo.mp3">http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Rt-5th-lo.mp3</a>&gt; shows<br/>where I think the 4:5 third would sound with both the root and fifth<br/>sounding. To my ear, it sounds &quot;mellow&quot; and tends to activate a soft<br/>&quot;rumbling&quot; of the common fundamental down low.</p><p>Next, the file &lt;<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Rt-5th-hi3.mp3">http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Rt-5th-hi3.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>demonstrates my concept of the &quot;high third.&quot; This sounds much &quot;cleaner&quot; to<br/>me than the previous example. It is also much &quot;brighter&quot; than the previous<br/>example and seems easier to blend into a homogenous gestalt.</p><p>In the next file, &lt;<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Rt-ad5-adj3.mp3">http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Rt-ad5-adj3.mp3</a>&gt; I<br/>have followed the format I used in the &quot;college kids&quot; item posted earlier.<br/>It begins with the voice singing a 4:5 third above a sounding root, then<br/>adds the fifth, causing(?) the third to move to a more &quot;comfortable&quot; &quot;high<br/>third&quot; tuning.</p><p>The last item &lt; <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Adj3solo.mp3">http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Adj3solo.mp3</a>&gt; provides<br/>the &quot;adjusting&quot; sung third by itself in case anyone cares to measure the<br/>amount of pitch change from the first few seconds to the last few seconds.</p><p>While these recordings are obviously done with a predetermined &quot;result&quot; in<br/>mind, they do, I believe, represent what I have experienced in this regard<br/>during my decades of working with vocal groups. This phenomenon has been<br/>observed extensively in the tuning practices of others, many of whom who had<br/>no knowledge of or expectation for of a &quot;moving third.&quot;</p><p>I hope these recordings are helpful in bringing this thread to a reasonable<br/>conclusion. Obviously, it would have been more efficient to have had these<br/>recordings under my arm when I walked into the room; however, I explained<br/>earlier why that didn&apos;t happen, so I won&apos;t go into it again here.</p><p>Needless to say, your reactions, perceptions and analyses are invited and<br/>will be valuable to me in every case, no matter what your take on this may<br/>be.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>3/8/2000 7:47:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:200003080051.QAA26494@harrier.prod.itd.earthlink.net">200003080051.QAA26494@harrier.prod.itd.earthlink.net</a>&gt;<br/>Gerald Eskelin wrote</p><p>&gt; Next, the file &lt;<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Rt-5th-hi3.mp3">http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/Rt-5th-hi3.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; demonstrates my concept of the &quot;high third.&quot; This sounds much &quot;cleaner&quot;<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; me than the previous example.

I&apos;ll resist adding another &quot;gram&quot; to the list. I certainly hope to, too,<br/>Paul. Otherwise Graham&apos;s input makes no sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for doing the histogram, though!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, it sure seems like you&apos;re saying Jerry was able to &quot;lock&quot; the low<br/>&gt; third much more accurately than he was the high third. A few cents variation<br/>&gt; around 5:4 is really the best you could hope for from a human vocalist.</p><p>I suspect the reason for the &quot;security&quot; on the low third was the &quot; quiet<br/>rumbling&quot; of the fundamental assuring me that I was close. With the high<br/>third, no such rumbling occurs, therefore there is likely more flexibility<br/>as to the optimum placement.</p><p>In that regard, yesterday at the American Choral Directors Association<br/>convention, I was able to hear about a half dozen of the best choirs in the<br/>western states. Needless to say, I was taking a subjective tally of<br/>distinctly low and high thirds in prominent locations (sustained chords,<br/>particularly final tonic ones). Some groups used both in various contexts (I<br/>didn&apos;t hear enough consistency to states _what contexts, although a<br/>descending line landing on a sustained high third is a suspicious<br/>candidate).</p><p>Not surprisingly, the most experienced group produced the most clearly high<br/>thirds. However, a phenomenally fine children&apos;s choir of about 70 voices<br/>often agreed on very high thirds. I doubt that the director would have<br/>requested a particular tuning in different places. I would think the musical<br/>context likely suggested the resulting tuning tacitly agreed upon<br/>instinctively by the singers.</p><p>That was not the case with one excellent group of experienced singers,<br/>however. A very fine and respected Southern California conductor, Donald<br/>Brinegar, (whom I have watched grow from a pup) told me that he prefers the<br/>low third and requests it from his singers. His choir specializes in<br/>contemporary music and breathed life into every piece they sang.</p><p>I ran into Don when I first arrived and he &quot;confessed&quot; that he has been a<br/>lurker on the Tuning List and has watched the &quot;high third&quot; discussion with<br/>interest. He will be giving a workshop on tuning Saturday morning, so I have<br/>to make a really hard decision as to whether I&apos;ll give up my regular golf<br/>round and go see what he has to say. On the other hand, maybe I&apos;ll just buy<br/>him lunch and find out later. :-)</p><p>After the afternoon set of concerts, I asked Don what he thought the ratio<br/>of high thirds to low thirds was. He said two thirds high and one third low.<br/>I tend to agree.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>3/10/2000 2:15:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gerald Eskelin wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; For each frequency bin, you can get it to color according to the<br/>&gt; &gt; intensity.

(Perhaps I will be able to check that<br/>myself<br/>&gt; when<br/>&gt; I get my Spectrogram up and running.)</p><p>As I said in the original message, there&apos;s a wide variation in pitch<br/>over small periods of time.  I think this is from 6:5 (definitely this<br/>time) to 9:7.  But, if you do the Fourier transform over a longer<br/>period of time, you see a constant but blurred trace.  The most<br/>intense frequencies in that blur are colored differently, and fairly<br/>consistently correspond to a 5:4.  Which is what we would have<br/>expected.  Looks like the ear does a similar thing.</p><p>The &quot;blurring&quot; would presumably be interpreted by the ear similarly to<br/>vibrato.  However, it is qualitatively different.  It looks like a<br/>fractal trace, rather than a sine wave.  I&apos;d like to hotwire a synth<br/>to emulate this.  Maybe over the weekend.  It must come from some<br/>feature of the vocal chords, and is present, to greater or lesser<br/>extent, in all the samples I&apos;ve analysed that don&apos;t replace it with<br/>gratuitous vibrato or portamento.  Not that I have any kind of<br/>statistically significant sample yet.</p><p>I don&apos;t think this is an artifact of the measuring process, as it<br/>isn&apos;t present for synth generated sounds.</p><p>&gt; &gt; And when the pitch is<br/>&gt; &gt; relatively steady, it isn&apos;t always at the same point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you clarify this? How can something be steady at different<br/>points?<br/>&gt; Do<br/>&gt; you mean at different times? If so, at which times? If not, what?</p><p>Yes, at different times.  What happens is that the trace is relatively<br/>steady for a while, then wanders around a bit, and becomes steady<br/>again.  With the low third, it keeps hitting the same point when it&apos;s<br/>steady.  With the high third, I think there are three different steady<br/>regions.  Each is consistent, in that the average pitch is the same at<br/>the beginning and end of the region, but the regions are not<br/>consistent with each other.  I think this is audible: I heard the<br/>pitch rising, and the chord becoming more dissonant.  I think the<br/>computer showed the first region being 5:4, the middle around the 400<br/>cents, and I forget for the last one.  I don&apos;t have the trace open<br/>here to check.</p><p>One interesting thing is that the blurring is actually greater for the<br/>low third, only the peak is well defined.  With the high third, the<br/>pitch fluctuates over a smaller range, but without a clear center.  At<br/>least that&apos;s how I saw it.  You can all check for yourselves.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The variation is<br/>&gt; &gt; between 6:5 and the 400 cents from one such region to another.<br/>These<br/>&gt; &gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; only quick calculations: it only ranges over two or three<br/>divisions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Divisions?</p><p>Should have been 5:4 again.  I tend to be consistent with my errors:)<br/> (Incidentally, I think it&apos;s far less likely that I would have called<br/>a just major third a just minor third.   Although still possible.)</p><p>Each time slice in the readout is a discrete Fourier transform at that<br/>point.  This is equivalent to a Fourier series about some low<br/>fundamental.  So you get equal divisions of frequency space.  Each<br/>point is colored to show the intensities of that range of frequencies.<br/> Now, as I was measuring the fundamentals, the width of those<br/>frequency ranges amounts to a few cents.  So I can tell the difference<br/>between a just and equal tempered major third, but can&apos;t tell whether<br/>the high third is really 24:19.</p></div><h3>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2000 9:13:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul Erlich asked:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So Jerry, what is your current theory as to what defines the &quot;locking&quot; or<br/>&gt; the &quot;optimum placement&quot; of the high third?</p><p>After the generous input from Tuning List members, and after two days of<br/>hearing some of the best choirs in the world, I am considering the notion<br/>that the &quot;high third&quot; is a very common phenomenon that results from musical<br/>intuition and artistic preference.</p><p>-----------</p><p>&gt; Are you giving up your notion that the high third (in<br/>&gt; the specific context of the major triad) is an interval of fixed size, like<br/>&gt; the low third which we all agree is 5:4?</p><p>Essentially, yes. Vicky McClure&apos;s extremely high third at the end of &quot;Blue<br/>In Green&quot; shined a vivid light on that issue. The variety of &quot;high thirds&quot;<br/>sung by various choirs at the ACDA conventions tended to settle the matter<br/>for me.</p><p>This does not, however, answer the nagging question regarding the<br/>&quot;preference&quot; of novice singers for the &quot;high third&quot; when the fifth is<br/>introduced.
