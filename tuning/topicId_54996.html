In my view, those are simply facts, and facts that greatly discourage my regular participation in the list (and, I suspect, the same is true of many others who are never heard from at all).  In order to keep current with the list, I&apos;d have to spend about an hour per day on it, sorting out the grain from the chaff, keeping up with the current jargon, etc.  I just don&apos;t consider this the best use of my time.  And, of course, to the extent that the list concerns temperaments, it just isn&apos;t of interest to me.  I&apos;ve devised methods for navigating in the JI lattice in the course of my compositions that work satisfactorily for me, and I&apos;ve never felt a need or desire to temper.</p><p>--<br/>==========================================================================<br/>David B.
