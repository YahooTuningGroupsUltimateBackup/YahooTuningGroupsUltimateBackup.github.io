I registered no complaint<br/>about any single performance of Ives&apos; works, and that naturally includes<br/>yours which I have heard with great interest, if not total conviction.  My<br/>only complaint would be that, based on Ives&apos; own record, one can not claim<br/>any single performance to be intonationally definitive. For the record: I am<br/>ethusiastic about having as many performances as possible, and with a<br/>diversity of approaches.</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/> 10. Believing Ives to be &quot;vague&quot; and &quot;incomplete&quot; is contrary to getting his<br/> work out and about. &gt;&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=5804 href="#5804">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>10/28/1999 7:34:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ives wrote (in Memos p. 190)<br/>    &quot;Thus, when a movement, perhaps only a section or passage, is not<br/>fundamentally based on a diatonic (and chromatic) tonality system, the marked<br/>notes (symbol for natural, #, b) should not be taken as literally<br/>representing those implied resolutions, because in this case they do not<br/>exit.&quot;</p><p>This would seem to indicate that the actual usage of 12-tone equal<br/>temperament for Ives&apos;s music was the minority of his tuning intention.  Only<br/>a movement or smaller (&quot;perhaps only a section or passage&quot;) used enharmonic<br/>identities, wherein the symbols are not tonal in implication.</p><p>On page 195 of Memos, Ives afirms that his general purpose for this chapter<br/>on the Concord Sonata was to provide an &quot;explanation of why certain notes<br/>have been written as they have in the [Concord] Sonata, and other music.&quot;</p><p>Ives follows the above, actually closing the Memo chapter on the Sonata by<br/>saying unequivicably: &quot;Then, to my way of hearing and thinking, a sharp is a<br/>kind of underlying sign of, or senses and reflects or encourages, an upward<br/>movement, tonal and more perhaps spirtual, at a thing somewhat more of<br/>courage and aspiration-towards than the flat carries or seems to-the flat is<br/>more relaxing, subservient, looking more for rest [and] submission,<br/>etc.-often used as symbols as such, when they&apos;re not needed as the signs of<br/>tonality in the usual way.&quot;</p><p>So not only is the sharp higher than the flat for Ives, but he considers this<br/>approach &quot;the usual way.&quot;</p><p>The &quot;usual way&quot; meant the # is higher than the b.  Only through the circle of<br/>fifths is the # higher than the b.  The reverse, a # lower than a b, occurs<br/>at the fifth harmonic of the overtone series, indicating a completely<br/>different tuning model.  Ives could not be more clear, if taken at his word.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ives is not often taken at his word.  Editors change his<br/>accidentals agains his wishes all the time.</p><p>FWIW, it hasn&apos;t escaped me that the 2 tunings - Just and Pyth - are part and<br/>parcel of each other.  The 2 hemisphere metaphor is fully realized by their<br/>working together as &quot;the brain.&quot;  That&apos;s why I feel these two tendencies for<br/>pitch organization are the musical equivalent of &quot;being of 2 minds.&quot;</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=5805 href="#5805">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/1999 11:07:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Johnny Reinhard:]<br/>&gt; On page 195 of Memos, Ives afirms that his general purpose for this<br/>chapter on the Concord Sonata was to provide an &quot;explanation of why<br/>certain notes have been written as they have in the [Concord] Sonata,<br/>and other music.&quot;</p><p>Just for the record (or for anyone who&apos;s really really interested), I<br/>posted a quick follow up to the TD 359.23 post: &quot;missed by the<br/>unimaginative (Ives on tuning),&quot; in TD 360.12, under the title: &quot;why<br/>certain notes have been written as they have (Ives on tuning).&quot; That<br/>post includes this whole section (i.e., pp. 193-95 of the _Memos_).</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=5968 href="#5968">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>11/5/1999 7:46:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Another source for Ives and tuning is in Memo 38 which is specifically titled<br/>with the Universe Symphony.  As per tuning, Ives includes &quot;Some perfectly<br/>tuned correct scales, some well tempered little scales, a scale of overtones<br/>with the divisions as near determinable by acousitcon, scales of smaller<br/>division than a semitone, scales of uneven division greater than a whole<br/>tone, scales with no octave, some of them with no octave for several octaves&quot;</p><p>Untempered Pythagorean would fit the &quot;perfectly tuned correct scales.&quot;  Just<br/>Intonation  follows later with &quot;a scale of overtones.&quot;  12TET fits the bill<br/>of &quot;well tempered little scales&quot; since there are less notes per octave in<br/>12TET than there is in the extended Pythagorean landscaping.</p><p>&quot;Scales of smaller&quot; includes the quartertones.  There are further tuning<br/>experiments with non-octave based tunings offset by eighthtones in Section B.<br/> And &quot;scales of uneven division greater than a whole tone&quot; are compound<br/>intervals.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
