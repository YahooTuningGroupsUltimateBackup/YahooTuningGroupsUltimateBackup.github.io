Oh to answer your<br/>question...</p><p>About 20 years ago Hugh Davies visited NYC from London to do the &quot;microtonal<br/>instruments&quot; article for the Grove Dictionary.  In our conversations it came<br/>to my attention that only special instruments were to be considered.<br/>Somehow, it didn&apos;t seem fair to me.  The bassoon was completely microtonal,<br/>and yet was to be neglected as a microtonal instrument.  Okay, this is done<br/>through technique and not hardware, but it is dishonest to the point, which<br/>is that we already have microtonal instruments.  Hugh Davies recognized this<br/>for himself and added a paragraph about the microtonal recorder playing of<br/>Tui St. George Tucker, the microtonal flute of Stefani Starin, and the<br/>microtonal bassoon.</p><p>Re George Secor, I don&apos;t believe I have ever engaged him about instruments,<br/>only about notation.  As for Patrick Ozzard-Low, I have helped him on his<br/>visits and with his interests.  It&apos;s just that people don&apos;t appreciate what<br/>is already before them, missing it completely sometimes.  The cello is a<br/>fully microtonal instrument: should we put something else on it?  Brads?<br/>Ratio Indications?  We could.  We could go out and paint trees different<br/>colors as well.</p><p>Sure there is work to be done in new instruments, but it seems little is<br/>understood about the ones we already have.  Like you, Paul, I like to focus<br/>people on to things that I think are more fruitful to improving present day<br/>awareness and receptivity to the power of tuning.  We just do it in different<br/>ways.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
