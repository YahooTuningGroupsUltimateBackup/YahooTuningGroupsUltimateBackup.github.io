I apologize<br/>&gt;to anyone offended by the low level of my questions on this list.  Please<br/>&gt;provide references when you tell me where to go :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1.    For illustrative purposes, I&apos;ll use a small prime limit JI, starting<br/>&gt;in C.  If I play a C major chord, the E is played about 14 cents lower than<br/>&gt;12TET.  If I move to a E major (using non-diatonic note for the 3rd (I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;know if non-diatonic is the right word in this case)), holding the E, does<br/>&gt;one usually (i) keep the E at that position and adjust each of the other<br/>&gt;notes accordingly so their intervals are identical to the original C major<br/>&gt;chord, or (ii) shift the E down slightly and keep the intervals the same so<br/>&gt;that there is less &quot;drift&quot; over time, or (iii) use the intervals for the E<br/>&gt;major that are implied by the original .</p><p>If I understand what you write, a cappella singers would do number i.</p><p>&gt;And if I move to a C major again,<br/>&gt;would I use the C in the original pitch, or the pitch based on E as being<br/>&gt;the last &quot;tonic&quot; (I use the word loosely) (ie:  is it like modulating keys<br/>&gt;when one changes chords, or does one stay within the original C tuning?</p><p>A cappella singers would form a C chord that incorporates the E from the<br/>previous key of E. If you are simply alternating between the keys of C and<br/>E there would be no drift.</p><p>Now there may be times when a piece modulates to the wrong key, so to<br/>speak, and that would be the correct thing to happen. For example, the<br/>Chopin Prelude no. 9 in E major returns to the original key of E=1 in bar 9<br/>after several modulations. But then the progression goes as follows: E B E<br/>A- F Bb G- D G B E. At this point the key is E=80/81. Draw the lattice<br/>diagram for major thirds and perfect fifths and you&apos;ll see that that is the<br/>case. If a group of singers were to sing the final four bars of Chopin&apos;s<br/>prelude in tune they would drift down by the comma of Didymus, because they<br/>are driven there by the progression. So actually I shouldn&apos;t call it drift.<br/>It is just movement to a new key that by convention has the same name as<br/>the original key. I would like to know whether there is any sort of uneasy<br/>feeling at the end when we don&apos;t finish in the original key. I have<br/>arranged that prelude for my group but we haven&apos;t sung it. To carry out my<br/>experiment I&apos;ll have to get a fretless guitar or sing the guitar part, or<br/>get the equipment to do a sequence.</p><p>&gt;And what if two notes are held from a previous chord.  If they form a<br/>&gt;different interval in the two chords, which is almost always the case, one<br/>&gt;or both have to shift.  Any recommendations?</p><p>It depends upon the particular example.</p><p>&gt;Another example: if I modulated keys in fifths around the full circle, would<br/>&gt;I accumulate the 2 cent discrepancy all the way around so that I would be 24<br/>&gt;cents off from my previous C when I get back to it, or would I somehow shift<br/>&gt;pitch slightly at convenient places to try and stop the drift?  If shifting<br/>&gt;is the answer, any recommendations for good places or ways to do it?</p><p>A cappella singers, if there were really in tune, would do the former.</p><p>&gt;My prejudice:  for maximum harmony, I was intending on playing each new<br/>&gt;chord as if the root of that chord is the 1 of the JI scale.   So chord<br/>&gt;changes change the tuning of all the keys - like one would expect with<br/>&gt;modulation.  The only problem is this means the tuning actually becomes<br/>&gt;quite fluid, with intervals always &quot;correct&quot;, but no consistent pitches for<br/>&gt;notes.</p><p>YES! Flexible tuning. Hindemith alluded to it and rejected it in Book 1 of<br/>The Craft of Musical Composition. But good a cappella singers do it all the<br/>time, as do good string quartets. See Gerald Eskelin&apos;s book Lies My Music<br/>Teacher Told Me. Eskelin&apos;s website is <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/">http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/</a><br/>and his email address is <a href="mailto:stg3music@earthlink.net">stg3music@earthlink.net</a>.</p><p>&gt;Or another way to look at it is I&apos;ld always be playing an<br/>&gt;approximation of a small prime limit JI subset of a large note scale (like<br/>&gt;53 circle of primes or something).</p><p>If you play in tune, there is no approximation to anything.</p><p>&gt;2.  I&apos;ve seen an old article in Electronic Musician talk about playing<br/>&gt;melodies differently than harmonies (ie: using different tunings).<br/>&gt;Unfortunately, the article was short, imprecise, and all that, and I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt;seen mention of this anywhere else.  I presume he means unacommpanied<br/>&gt;melodies, since any accompanied melodies have harmony?  Any info on what is<br/>&gt;often done here?  I understand the physical basis for using small prime<br/>&gt;limit JI for harmonic situations.  Are there physical basis for melodic<br/>&gt;intervals as opposed to harmonic?</p><p>&gt;Perhaps such melodic intervals are the appropriate interval to be used for<br/>&gt;chord changes and modulation if the root or 1 position is not held from a<br/>&gt;previous chord?</p><p>I believe that when singing solo unaccompanied we sing pitches according to<br/>the harmony that we imagine.</p><p>John Link<br/>ALMOST ACAPPELLA</p></div><h3><a id=5998 href="#5998">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/1999 8:33:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;And what if two notes are held from a previous chord.

If shifting<br/>&gt;is the answer, any recommendations for good places or ways to do it?</p><p>You could spread it out uniformly by rooting chords in 12tET.  In some<br/>progressions, there are convenient places to insert the shift, rather than<br/>spreading it out by choosing roots from a temperament.  These are usually<br/>spots where the root motion is large (say, on the circle of fifths).  In<br/>the progression A E C F, for example, a jump would probably be least<br/>noticed between E and C.  But in the case of the uniform circle-of-fifths<br/>progression, there&apos;s hardly a better solution than equal distribution.  Of<br/>course, you can always leave the drift -- you might like it.</p><p>&gt;The only problem is this means the tuning actually becomes quite fluid, with<br/>&gt;intervals always &quot;correct&quot;, but no consistent pitches for notes.

The melodic basis is proving much harder to discover than<br/>the harmonic.  I believe there are several independent components to the<br/>melodic basis, some but not all of which are mutually exclusive.  And some,<br/>but not all of which are exclusive with the harmonic basis.</p><p>One interesting thing I suggest you try: melody and harmony coming from<br/>different tunings.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=6010 href="#6010">ðŸ”—</a>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>11/8/1999 7:08:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: Jim Savage &lt;<a href="mailto:waldpond@oanet.com">waldpond@oanet.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;From John Link:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;And what if two notes are held from a previous chord.
