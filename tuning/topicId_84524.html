Perhaps<br/>&gt; this is due to the beating between notes that are close together in<br/>&gt; pitch.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That &quot;tremolo&quot; or &quot;vibrato&quot; you hear is the beating of the &quot;badly<br/>tuned&quot; unisons and octaves.

The<br/>shear result is that of oscillating beat patterns of 1:2:4:8:16:32 I<br/>surmise.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; This is in fact an observation similar to that of Prof. Yalcin<br/>&gt;&gt; Tura, who claims that<br/>&gt;&gt; commatic differences cannot be discerned with the orchestras, and<br/>&gt;&gt; the whole<br/>&gt;&gt; issue of maqam polyphony is therefore mute.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve always thought that hearing tempered intervals as being<br/>&gt; commatically different from one another was a psychological thing more<br/>&gt; than an issue of tuning anyway...

JI theory would dictate that we are<br/>always desiring to hear just or near-just intervals. But I think the<br/>validity of this theory is in question. Nevertheless, this is another<br/>topic of discussion.</p><p>&gt; Likewise, if you write a triadic piece of music in which every 5:4 is<br/>&gt; replaced by an 81:64, you&apos;ll likely hear those 81:64&apos;s as very wide<br/>&gt; &quot;versions&quot; of 5:4&apos;s.</p><p>Perhaps. Or else, there are different major third qualities that one<br/>desires in triadic music, depending on the harmonic progression. This<br/>is a phenomenon I have experienced often with irregular cyclic<br/>temperaments I set on my grandpiano. The mood or the force of the<br/>harmony dictates the use of either Pyth/super-Pyth triads or near JI/<br/>JI triads.
