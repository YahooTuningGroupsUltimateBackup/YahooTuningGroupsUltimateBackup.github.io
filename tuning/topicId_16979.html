Sometimes, personal chemistries<br/>don&apos;t match up between certain folks...I strive to avoid gnarly<br/>situations, or try and deflect them out of my path...doesn&apos;t always<br/>work, but when it does, it saves a lot of wasted energies...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=16996 href="#16996">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
