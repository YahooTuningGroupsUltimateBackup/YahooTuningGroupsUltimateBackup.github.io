Instead, the 15:16<br/>results in one or both of the following ways:</p><p>C-E is attracted to 4:5 and E-B is attracted to 2:3<br/>C-G is attracted to 2:3 and G-B is attracted to 4:5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If a chord includes C,G, and D, of course D is going to be tuned as<br/>&gt; 9/4 of C, but to my mind that doesn&apos;t make it &quot;9-limit&quot;.</p><p>Exactly . . . C-G is attracted to 2:3 and G-D is attracted to 2:3, so there is no necessary<br/>supposition that C-D as a dyad is attracted to 4:9 (though it may be in some<br/>circumstances -- that would be a &quot;9-limit&quot; situation).</p><p>So perhaps you do &quot;get it&quot; after all?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps it would be simpler just to qualify using the term &quot;prime limit&quot;<br/>&gt; as opposed to &quot;odd limit&quot;.

Since<br/>the context of adaptively tuning pieces of music is perhaps somewhere between these<br/>two contexts, it&apos;s no wonder the terminology gets confusing . . .</p><p>As for &quot;11/13-limit&quot;, I still think</p><p>(a) you should just call it 13-limit.<br/>(b) the 4:5:6:7:9:11:13 chord might be better approximated by C-E-G-Bb-D-F#-A than by C-<br/>E-G-Bb-D-F#-A, since 11:13 is very close to 3 semitones, and 7:13 is a lot closer to 11<br/>semitones than to 10 semitones.</p><p>&gt; As for my &quot;tuning file methodology&quot;, I&apos;m still not sure if the basic<br/>&gt; process I use is clear.
