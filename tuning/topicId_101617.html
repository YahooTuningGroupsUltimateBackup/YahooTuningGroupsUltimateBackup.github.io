        <a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Are wedgies real?</h1><h3><a id=101617 href="#101617">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2011 5:47:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In my last post, I laid out a line of reasoning that attempts to<br/>establish that learned categories don&apos;t just consist of harmonic data<br/>(as many JI numerologists think), and that they don&apos;t also just<br/>consist of scalar data (as Paul is sometimes fond of saying), but that<br/>on the largest scale, they consist of associations made between scalar<br/>and harmonic data. I used this reasoning to ultimately posit that<br/>Western listeners literally figure out the fundamental pattern of<br/>association between melody and harmony that meantone &quot;is&quot;, and hence<br/>internalize its mapping matrix, leading to not only the M3/A4<br/>dichotomy but in general the percept of an interval &quot;function.&quot;</p><p>If this is true, then something like a wedgie is a &quot;real&quot; thing,<br/>because it&apos;s a direct mathematical representation of a particular<br/>pattern of low-level cognitive harmonic-melodic associations. This<br/>line of reasoning suggests that wedgies are real, and that every<br/>temperament could lead to a &quot;functional&quot; experience, once you&apos;ve<br/>really gotten into the wedgie. (OK, I&apos;ll stop).</p><p>If it&apos;s true that harmonic and melodic associations are in fact<br/>formed, this implies some &quot;cues,&quot; much like Rothenberg propriety, that<br/>may make scales easier to learn, all of which I&apos;d like to test:</p><p>1) Melodic importance: If a tuning has strong harmonic properties, but<br/>has very weak scalar or melodic properties, it will be more difficult<br/>to learn, because the inability to establish a scalar position will<br/>disrupt the process of expectation-forming.<br/>2) Regularity importance: If a tuning has strong melodic properties,<br/>but has weak harmonic properties such that a particular approximated<br/>harmonic relationship appears twice - say a scale having having both<br/>670 cent and 730 cent intervals at different generic interval classes<br/>- it will be more difficult to learn, being perceived as an<br/>&quot;irregular&quot; circulating temperament until the listener comes to<br/>distinguish the two via intonational information.<br/>3) &quot;Training wheel&quot; tunings: If #1 holds, then harmonically accurate<br/>temperaments with crappy melodic and scalar qualities can be learned<br/>more easily by first exploring a tuning that presents a crystal-clear<br/>rank-order matrix, and then going back to the melodically inferior but<br/>harmonically superior version, so long as the melodically superior but<br/>harmonically inferior version doesn&apos;t significantly fall prey to #2<br/>above.</p><p>I think that #1 will hold, but actually that #2 might not in all<br/>cases, and that seeing how it fails will yield to some new insights.<br/>#1 and #3 are both things I&apos;ve experienced personally and heard some<br/>concurrence on from the Mavila crowd, in that many do in fact perceive<br/>25-equal mavila[9] to be more &quot;comprehensible&quot; than 16 or 23-equal.</p><p>Lastly, #1, if true, would suggest a new method for tuning<br/>optimization: pick a tuning where the generators can get the heck out<br/>of each other&apos;s way. It&apos;s really hard to know which position in the<br/>chain you&apos;re at if you&apos;re in a scale that is stupidly and wildly<br/>improper, and if you can&apos;t figure out where in the temperament you<br/>are, it&apos;s impossible to imagine any sort of consistent harmonic<br/>context around the interval you&apos;re at. Everything I&apos;ve written above<br/>is an attempt to formalize this one observation.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
