However, my friend in<br/>Russia, Anton Rovner, sent me an article he would like posted to the<br/>Tuning List.  It is his translation of Arseny Avraamov&apos;s article<br/>which appeared in the periodical &quot;Muzyka&quot; September 5, 1915 in<br/>Moscow. As you can see from the article, it addresses several issues<br/>which have been discussed on the list... including the practice of<br/>string playing in just intonation... pros and cons.  Additionally, it<br/>makes some rather humorous comments on unnecessary &quot;virtuosity&quot; that<br/>I believe will ring well with certain members of this tuning<br/>community.</p><p>It seems as though Mr. Rovner will soon be joining the Tuning List,<br/>and while lecturing at the electronic music studio of the Moscow<br/>Conservatory, I urged several other composers to join the list as<br/>well... since I don&apos;t believe there are any Russian participants on<br/>it... So, hopefully, there will be some other new posters.</p><p>Anyway, here&apos;s Rovner&apos;s translation of the Avraamov article:</p><p>_________________________<br/>Arseny Avraamov</p><p>The Open Strings of the Quintet as a Basis for Detuned Orchestral<br/>Sound</p><p>The string quintet does not provide well-tempered open strings. This<br/>way, the temperament of the orchestra contains five (excluding the<br/>repetitions in the different octaves) fixed points,</p><p>cÂ—gÂ—dÂ—aÂ—e</p><p>which contradict with an accoustic precision the entire foundation of<br/>orchestral intonation. To begin with, there is no tonality, in which<br/>all five pitches of the open strings could be used impunibly: at a<br/>first superficial glance it would seem that there are three such<br/>tonalities, --</p><p>F major, C major, G major,</p><p>Plus the three relative descending melodic minor keys. Nevertheless,<br/>with a few rather simple experiments it is easy to prove the<br/>contrary, which is exactly as follows:</p><p>1.    In C major it is not possible to use the open strings E2Â—A2<br/>of the double-bass, the A3 of the cello, the A4 of the viola and the<br/>A4Â—E5 of the violin.</p><p>2.    In G major Â– the E2 of the double-bass and the E5 of the<br/>violin.</p><p>3.    The tonic of F major is not available on open strings, which is<br/>why on the given tonality it is not possible to establish one unified<br/>rule. Everything is determined by those tonalities from which we have<br/>come to this F major. If the modulation tok place from C major, then<br/>only the pitches C and G of the open strings would be appropriate,<br/>while all the others would be excessively high, whereas if it would<br/>be a sudden modulation from A major (assuming the tonic a, lying on<br/>the open string), then the opposite would be the case Â– all the<br/>other pitches of the open strings would be appropriate except for C<br/>and G, which would turn out to be excessively low.</p><p>4.    Similar double aplications are feasible on the relative minor<br/>tonalities of D minor, A minor and E-minor: if they happen to be the<br/>source tonalities, then undoubtedly it is particularly their tonics<br/>are given on open strings, and the limitations of their usage consist<br/>merely of the following: in D minor, the undoubtedly low pitch would<br/>be the descending C, in A minor it would be C and the descending G,<br/>whereas in E minor it would be C, G and the descending D; if we<br/>approach these keys from their relative major keys, then the<br/>forementioned pitches would be in tune, while all the other open<br/>string pitches would be excessively high. Any move upwards of<br/>downwards from the pitches of the open strings in all the mentioned<br/>cases would be at an interval of a comma (80:81); this practically<br/>always demands the replacement of the open string with the<br/>corresponding pitches, taken by ear on the adjacent lower string.</p><p>The following experiments undoubtedly prove the validity of my<br/>position. They were written for the particular purpose of being tried<br/>out on a violin, in this case the durations of the notes are of<br/>little consequence: the important thing is to adhere to the<br/>unbreakable chain of dyads. The pitches, placed below into the<br/>bass-clef, present themselves as the actually heard combinational<br/>tone, complementing the major sixth, for the purpose of obtaining a<br/>full triad: they are indicated for the purpose of exact tuning with<br/>the ear of this interval Â– al the others are in essence octaves<br/>and unisons.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Musical examples given on one staff (resembling a fourth species<br/>counterpoint exercise, the lower voice given in whole notes, while<br/>the upper voice apearing as the second half note after a half rest,<br/>and then suspended over the next measure with bass-notes given as<br/>supplementary notes on an adjacent staff:</p><p>I.            G3-C5-/-C4-A4-(bass: F2)-//</p><p>II.            G3-G4-/-E5-(bass: C3)-E5 (open, sul E) (fermata)-//</p><p>III.           (chord on a whole note) G3-D4-B4-E5-//</p><p>IV.          G3-C5-/-C4-F4-/-D5-D4-(bass: Bb2)&gt;&gt;</p><p>I.             Approaching the &quot;unison&quot; on A, we hear that<br/>the open A presents a detuned, excessively high-pitched sound. The<br/>fact that we are situated within the boundary of C major is obviously<br/>demonstrated by the presence of its tonic and of both dominants in<br/>this example.</p><p>II.            The E of the open fifth is higher to the same degree<br/>than the E taken on the A string with the fourth finger. It is<br/>excessively high-pitched for both tonalities, the tonic chords of<br/>which are given in the example.</p><p>III.           Tuning the D-B dyad exactly and checking the B-E dyad<br/>we can see that it is strenuous; raising B to an adequate degree and<br/>checking out the major sixth, we can hear the combinational tone,<br/>which is close to G# (the eleventh partial of D), which sounds<br/>somewhat lower; returning B to its initiate tuning, we will notice<br/>that the combinational tone descended to a pure G. Consequently the E<br/>of the open string, likewise its derived perfect fourth do not<br/>pertain to the temperament of G major.</p><p>IV.          In this example one must be extremely careful, as the<br/>stretch of fingers  on the octave C-C and the transfer of the second<br/>finger from G to A might cause a change of the F pitch, unperceivable<br/>to the eye. If the experiment is carried out successfully, then the D<br/>on the open string will turn out to be excessively high-pitched.<br/>Consequently in F major, the sounds of all the strings except of the<br/>G string should necessarily be taken only as closed strings. If one<br/>is to play out the last example in backwards or retrograde motion, or<br/>to achieve the same result, if one plays the F major scale in scalar<br/>motion downwards starting from the open A string, we will notice that<br/>the G string has already become excessively low-pitched, whereas the<br/>D string sounds very much in tune.</p><p>I recommend the readers to convince themself of my statements also by<br/>the following means: to play in first position at a slow tempo all<br/>the six scales mentioned by me, respectively from G upwards and from<br/>E downwards, always utilizing the fourth finger and comparing it<br/>immediately with the sound of the corresponding open string.</p><p>All that has been stated above results in the surprising conclusion,<br/>that our diatonic scale is extremely inexact, so no fixed points,<br/>even those that are accoustically well tuned, could satisfy the<br/>diverse demands of the modal intonationsÂ…All the more to be<br/>concludedabout chromaticism and enharmonicism.</p><p>Until all of these considerations have not entered the heart and mind<br/>of orchestral musicians, it would be best id they would avoid open<br/>strings entirely, substituting them each time with closed strings;<br/>this would even greatly enhance the melodic wholeness of a musical<br/>phrase, since who could ever fail to notice that the sound of the<br/>open string stands out even in a many-pitched chord by the means of<br/>its strength and evenness, creating with its sound a bright but<br/>petrified spotÂ… Nevertheless, we know very well that once we<br/>deprive a violinist or a celist of open strings, his intonation<br/>immediately begins to hang in the air: the open strings present<br/>themselves as that &quot;oven&quot;, from which his fingers dance on<br/>the<br/>fingerboardÂ… How many trickeries,how much conscious false<br/>temperament<br/>is brought in by the violinist, in order to hold on, to grasp that<br/>one<br/>single open string in&quot;difficult&quot; key signaturesÂ… even if<br/>its pitch<br/>holds a most insignificant position in that key Â– he will still<br/>think<br/>about it continuously and if you, na&iuml;ve composer, would deprive<br/>him of<br/>the &quot;last&quot; foundation with a sporadic modulation happening at<br/>a<br/>decisive movement Â– blame yourself for that surprise, which the<br/>interpreter of your violinistic fancies will bring to youÂ…It<br/>would be<br/>better to drive the performer to despair at once by a complete lack<br/>of<br/>open strings, by means of insertion of no less that four flats or<br/>five<br/>sharps into the key signature, so at least you do not risk hearing an<br/>unwieldy open E string in G major if not something even worse!</p><p>It is quite characteristic that the cause for this continuously<br/>rising carelesness on the part of instrumentalists towards the purity<br/>of musical intonation has been the result of the development of<br/>virtuosic musical literatureÂ… If the contemporary virtuoso cannot<br/>treat with respect the feigned &quot;Gel&auml;ufigkeit&quot;, obtained at<br/>the price of all sorts of faking and untidiness in virtuosic<br/>passages,<br/>how much more sadly must the theoretician witness the development of<br/>a<br/>literature which is unthinkable to perform without a conscious faking<br/>of intonationsÂ…moreover on those very instruments, one of the<br/>main accomplishments of which is particularly the ability to perform<br/>with the purest intonation possibly, relying substantially to the<br/>demands of one&apos;s audible perception, which arise out of the<br/>unshakeable logic of sound. It is already a long time that we should<br/>stop considering as &quot;high art&quot;, smelling of sweat, the<br/>mastery by<br/>one &quot;artist&quot; of the technical difficulty, which is<br/>non-existant<br/>for two musicians: the quasi-three-voiced Capriccio by Paganini will<br/>turn into a child&apos;s play, if one is to give the tremolando to one<br/>violinist and the melody to another, albeit undoubtedly these two<br/>would play it in a much more pure and expressive manner Â– not to<br/>mention the fact that the composer, not being burdened by a special<br/>technical challenge, could have put in a much more significant<br/>musical<br/>idea to this &quot;present trifle&quot;. That creative art which is<br/>contained<br/>into the narrow limitations of the possibilities of dexterity of<br/>fingers limits itself in such a heartless manner, that it ceases to<br/>contain a self-contained value of its own. Following this train of<br/>thought, no technical accomplishments can arouse our happiness when<br/>you know concisely at what expensive a price they were bought. The<br/>moment will eventualy arise when art with a sober critical glance<br/>will<br/>view its buffoonish costume and will desire to cast it off, in order<br/>to clothe itself once again in a white tunic and a modest wreath of<br/>field flowers Â– alas! Â– it will be necessary to tear out this<br/>bufoonery, firmly enroted, together with pieces of living fleshÂ…<br/>and<br/>the snow-white tunic, when put on blood-let wounds, will more than<br/>once be speckled with crimson.</p><p>The bitter pathos of these lines will appeal and be understandabe to<br/>those, who love music in itself, as a magic combination of tones into<br/>upright harmonious constructions, torn away from Chaos, adorned with<br/>intricate melodic and rhythmic ornamentation. No matter what is<br/>&quot;expressed&quot; or &quot;depicted&quot; by this or that chord, it<br/>should first and<br/>foremost be a true chord and not a false likeness of one. And if the<br/>purity of the creative conception would shine with a bright halo over<br/>the spirit of our art, then the spirit of melodic intonation becomes<br/>that snow-white tunic, which covers its beautiful body, so as a<br/>result, it becomes dificult to be excessively demanding in this<br/>primeval condition, without which music ceases to be music!</p><p>Arseny Avraamov</p><p>&quot;Muzyka&quot; weekly newsletter, September 5, 1915, Moscow, Vol.<br/>5, N.222, pp.315-318</p><p>Translated by Anton Rovner</p></div><h3><a id=20353 href="#20353">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>3/22/2001 7:07:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p>Additionally, it<br/>&gt; makes some rather humorous comments on unnecessary &quot;virtuosity&quot; that<br/>&gt; I believe will ring well with certain members of this tuning<br/>&gt; community.<br/>&gt;<br/>That creative art which is<br/>&gt; contained<br/>&gt; into the narrow limitations of the possibilities of dexterity of<br/>&gt; fingers limits itself in such a heartless manner, that it ceases to<br/>&gt; contain a self-contained value of its own.
