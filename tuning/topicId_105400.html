I don&apos;t<br/>mind C-C for Lssssss either. I actually enjoy using the familiar<br/>letter names for such an exotic scale to some extent, but if you&apos;re<br/>not a fan you can always go with nominals 1-7 instead. I also like the<br/>chroma for porcupine[7] being ^ and v, since it&apos;s so small, as opposed<br/>to # and b.</p><p>So if I were writing a book for beginners and looking for a beginner<br/>notation for 15-EDO, that would be my personal preference, with<br/>blackwood coming in second. Nominals G-G for Lssssss, chroma is ^ and<br/>v.</p><p>Outside of the scope of a book for beginners specifically, it&apos;s also<br/>useful to note that this system can easily be extended to porcupine[8]<br/>by adding an additional nominal H and additional symbols (I prefer<br/>#/b) for the porcupine[8] chroma. So if you want to work within<br/>porcupine[7], you get G A B C D E F G for Lssssss, and if you want<br/>porcupine[8], G H A B C D E F G gives you LsLLLLLL. And since<br/>porcupine[8] MODMOS&apos;s that modify things by the porcupine[7] chroma<br/>can be useful, then you can just write things like G H A Bv C D E F G<br/>for a scale that&apos;s like G H A B C D E F G, but which replaces the 5/4<br/>with a 6/5. (Note that Bv is the same note as A# but spelled a<br/>different way).</p><p>I find that in some sense it&apos;s more natural for me to think along the<br/>latter terms if I&apos;m in a porcupine[8] section and within the former<br/>terms if I&apos;m in a porcupine[7] section. To actually pull this off in<br/>notation, though, would require you to switch staffs to accommodate<br/>the extra nominal. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;ll be easier to do things that<br/>way, or if people will instead be more inclined to notate porcupine[8]<br/>and its MODMOS&apos;s just using porcupine[7] notation. I certainly know I<br/>find it more natural to think in terms of porcupine[7], but I have yet<br/>to write a composition around porcupine[8] so I don&apos;t know how hard<br/>it&apos;d be to notate the whole thing using only porcupine[7] notation.</p><p>To be blunt the whole thing is a pain in the ass. But, there&apos;s no<br/>point complaining because porcupine[7] and porcupine[8] and their<br/>respective MODMOS&apos;s are both beautiful scale systems, so there&apos;s no<br/>getting around it. The same situation presents itself whenever you<br/>have two MOS&apos;s that are both viable &quot;diatonic&quot; sized MOS&apos;s, especially<br/>those that are just one note apart, like porcupine[7/8], bleu[8/9],<br/>negri[9/10], miracle[10/11], etc. In one sense this is a prime feature<br/>of those tunings; in another it makes notation difficult.</p><p>I still think that for beginners, simplifying the above to have<br/>porcupine[7] with G-G nominals for Lssssss and ^/v accidentals is the<br/>best way to go.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=105410 href="#105410">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2012 4:34:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, Nov 28, 2012 at 5:38 PM, Keenan Pepper &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (The dumb temporary notation I&apos;ve been using in my own notes for marimba<br/>&gt; keys is C, C#, D-, D+, Eb, E, F, F#-, F#+, G, Ab, A, Bb-, Bb+, B, C.)</p><p>A few slight modifications to that would make for a perfectly regular<br/>notation system built around Ares temperament:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=7p_12p_15p&limit=11">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=7p_12p_15p&limit=11</a></p><p>If the +/- accidental is 81/80, the #/b accidental is 25/24, and the<br/>nominals C-C represent the tempered version of the scale whose<br/>transversal is 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1, then you get</p><p>C C# D- D Eb E F F#- F# G Ab A Bb- Bb B C</p><p>This is, of course only one way to spell things, just like there&apos;s<br/>more than one way to spell things based around meantone[12] in 12-EDO.<br/>You could also try 7p&amp;12e&amp;15p if you want to count 11/8 as a type of<br/>5\12 instead of as a type of 6\12, which as one option gives you</p><p>C C# D- D Eb E F F+ F# G Ab A Bb- Bb B C</p><p>I don&apos;t think that this is any worse than any rank-2 based system,<br/>really.

For me, I&apos;m more inclined to stick<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; with porcupine[7] or the occasional blackwood[10]. If you want 4:5:6<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and 10:12:15 chords to share the same generic pattern of scale steps,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 7 note and 10 note scales are about what you&apos;re stuck with.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yep. Any idea which nominal I should start the porcupine generator chain<br/>&gt; &gt; on to preserve the maximum number of familiar (&quot;meantone&quot;) chord-spellings?<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve just been starting it on &quot;A&quot;, but I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s optimal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; G-G for Lssssss is what strikes me as closest, intuitively, to what we<br/>&gt; have now (It&apos;s kind of like G lydian dominant or something). I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; mind C-C for Lssssss either. I actually enjoy using the familiar<br/>&gt; letter names for such an exotic scale to some extent, but if you&apos;re<br/>&gt; not a fan you can always go with nominals 1-7 instead. I also like the<br/>&gt; chroma for porcupine[7] being ^ and v, since it&apos;s so small, as opposed<br/>&gt; to # and b.</p><p>I agree with G-A being the large step. It doesn&apos;t jive with standard notation, but if you forget standard music notation and just think about the alphabet, it makes sense. G-A is the only step that is not consecutive letters in the alphabet, so it should be the odd step.

All right, if you insist: B-D#v-F# (But really it&apos;s the same as C major.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can tell at a glance that anything that looks like a normal note is part of one 5edo, anything with a ^ is another, and anything with v is another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I said, this is even more insane, but don&apos;t deny its merits!</p><p>I tried a similar approach too--it&apos;s basically pentatonic notation, based on the three disjunct circles of fifths--and was pretty sold on it for a while.  As you imply with your &quot;really only call it...&quot; notes, I basically just used 5 nominals, and figured &quot;what the heck, you just gotta learn that what looks like a minor 6th is also a perfect 5th, because this is 5-ED2 and the limma is tempered out&quot;.  So you get A-A^-Cv-C-C^-Dv-D-D^-Ev-E-E^-Gv-G-G^-A.  W00t, it&apos;s so simple!  You have to learn FEWER note-names, not more!</p><p>But then I realized--it&apos;s not just fifths and minor sixths that get conflated (spelling-wise), it&apos;s pretty much everything.  A-C looks like a minor 3rd but sounds like a major 2nd; A-C^ looks like a major 3rd but sounds like a minor 3rd.  D^ to Ev is the same distance as A^ to Cv.  It&apos;s annoying and counter-intuitive.  Your approach is a way around this, but really, your notation is just 5-limit JI notation, not based on any temperament, so any comma pump will cause notational drift.  That, I think, is a bigger problem than working out a new set of spellings.</p><p>Another way around it is to use nominals A-E, but that&apos;s even more ridiculous, because nothing is spelled familiar at all anymore.  Aaaaaand, another problem with pentatonic notations in general is that you need accidentals for literally *every* 5-limit chord.  There&apos;s no &quot;white key&quot; scale.</p><p>Speaking of which, it&apos;s also important to consider the musicians who are going to be using 15-ET, and the interface they will have with their instrument.  Are we expecting the 5w10b (or 10w5b) keyboard to be the favored choice, when 7w8b or 8w7b are both way more compact, or when 9w6b (i.e. Triforce) seems a more optimal mix of regularity and compactness?  My current thinking is that anyone who plays 15-ED2 on a 7w8b keyboard (or an 8w7b) will gravitate naturally to Porcupine notation.  I mean, you obviously want the white keys to be the naturals, right?  And you want spellings of chords to easily indicate fingerings, right?  I mean, imagine you&apos;re reading a piece of 15-tone sheet music for keyboard (or marimba, as the case may be).  What&apos;s more important, that the fifths are all spelled the way they are in 12-TET, or that you can find the notes on your instrument more easily?  Considering your marimba is in 7w8b, how do you feel about applying a pentatonic notation to it?</p><p>Of course, any keyboard other than 5w10b (or 10w5b) will put keyboardists and guitarists at odds, because on guitar, Blackwood[10] (or just 5-ET) has all the open-position chords.  And blackwood[10] in the major mode is basically a super-position of all the major-type modes of the 5-limit JI diatonic scale (as well as the 7- and 11-limit variations on said diatonic scale), so if you&apos;re just noodling diatonically in 15-ET on guitar, odds are you&apos;re just staying in a 7-note subset of Blackwood[10].  Thus I generally find that, on guitar, the wonky inconsistent A-G pentatonic notation actually does the best job, because I don&apos;t think in terms of all three note-names in a triad, just root and chord-type--i.e., I don&apos;t think of C-Ev-G, I just think &quot;C major&quot;.  And it&apos;s way easier to just be able to say &quot;all the naturals in this key are major, and all the v&apos;s are minor&quot;.  For writing guitar chord charts, this notation is tough to beat.  In Porcupine notation, you&apos;d basically have to abandon all-4ths tuning, or accept some accidentals on the open strings, and get used to a sort of diagonal mapping of accidentals across the strings.</p><p>So, I hope you can understand my dilemma.  I&apos;m trying to choose the notation very carefully in case I end up setting the convention.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=105438 href="#105438">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2012 7:46:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Nov 29, 2012 at 12:31 PM, Keenan Pepper &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And in any closed 15-note system, both accidentals are the same interval,<br/>&gt; so you can just say IDGAF.</p><p>I assume that snooty 15-EDO classical musicians will GAF, since snooty<br/>12-EDO classical musicians today GAF about enharmonic respellings.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Since all these schemes end up calling Lssssss G-A-B-C-D-E-F-G, I<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t mind it being made standard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hereby proclaim this &quot;standard Miller nominals&quot;.
