The footnote begins with Schoenberg disassociating<br/>himself from the younger composers who call themselves &quot;atonalists&quot;:</p><p>Arnold Schoenberg, 1978, _Theory of Harmony_<br/>(Carter translation of _Harmonielehre_), p. 432;<br/>comments in square brackets by Carter:</p><p>&quot;... I am a musician and have nothing to do with things atonal.<br/>The word &apos;atonal&apos; could only signify something entirely<br/>inconsistent with the nature of tone.  Even the word &apos;tonal&apos;<br/>is incorrectly used if it is intended in an exclusive rather<br/>than inclusive sense.  It can be valid only in the following<br/>sense: Everything implied by a series of tones (_Tonreihe_)<br/>constitutes tonality, whether it be brought together by means<br/>of direct reference to a single fundamental or by more<br/>complicated connections.  That from this single correct<br/>definition no reasonable opposite corresponding to the word<br/>&apos;atonality&apos; can be formed, must be evident.  Where could the<br/>negation be introduced?  Is it that *not all* implications of<br/>a series of tones, or *not any*, should characterize atonality?<br/>[I.e. oes atonality exclude only certain implications or all<br/>of them?]  A piece of music will always have to be tonal,<br/>at least in so far as a relation has to exist from tone to<br/>tone by virtue of which the tones, placed next to or above<br/>one another, yield a perceptible continuity.  The tonality<br/>[itself] may then perhaps be neither perceptible nor provable;<br/>these relations may be obscure and difficult to comprehend,<br/>even incomprehensible.  Nevertheless, to call qany relation<br/>of tones atonal is just as farfetched as it would be to<br/>designate a relation of colors aspectral or acomplementary.<br/>There is no such antithesis.  Besides, there has been no<br/>investigation at all of the question whether the way these<br/>new sounds go together is not actually the tonality of a<br/>12-tone series.  It is indeed probably just that, hence would<br/>be a phenomenon paralelling the situation that led to the<br/>church modes, of which I say (page 25): &apos;The effect of a<br/>fundamental tone was felt, but since no one knew which tone<br/>it was, all of them were tried.&apos;  Here we do not yet even<br/>feel the fundamental; nevertheless, it is therefore [?]<br/>probably present.

This is all then a piece of nonsense ...&quot;</p><p>Schoenberg then goes on to describe (with his typically<br/>amusing wordplay) a scenario of atonalists who &quot;would not<br/>succeed even in ... anything with tones&quot;, the necessity of<br/>an early grounding in &quot;accepted&quot; musical technique, and then<br/>the sense of &quot;a mission&quot; which  a master feels he must fulfill<br/>even against his will.</p></div><h3><a id=47878 href="#47878">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2003 12:46:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Arnold Schoenberg, 1978, _Theory of Harmony_<br/>&gt; (Carter translation of _Harmonielehre_), p. 432;<br/>&gt; comments in square brackets by Carter:<br/>&gt;</p><p>argh ... i forgot to proofread it before i sent it ...<br/>here&apos;s a corrected version of the quote:</p><p>&gt; &quot;...
