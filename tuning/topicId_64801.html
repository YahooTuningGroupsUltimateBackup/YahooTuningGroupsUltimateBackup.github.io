Even the pow wow songs , as i mention have been influenced by other tribes, and or reconstruction on such models. Some tribes , the more remote the better, but there is no more remote in the US. Mexico has more remote areas, with some tribes still hanging on ( although the droughts of the last few years have forced  most into the towns) there are no reservations, and the govt is probably, and always has been , quite antagonistic to such groups, failing to even acknowledge their existence.<br/> &gt;   &gt;<br/>&gt; Was the edison wax material in time to capture<br/>&gt; the old traditions of American First Peoples&apos;<br/>&gt; music?  Or was it too little, too late?<br/>&gt;   These early recordings, are very important documents. often in a large tribe there might be 7 or 8 people who even knew these songs. with little or no interest in the generation after them learning, or wanting to learn the songs.<br/>there are exception of course. the hopi seem to have preserved a fair amount, but only one person is allowed to record them for others to hear.<br/>we are talking about 200 tribes, like 200 different nations. many of these have no recordings to fall back on .<br/>most of what we hear are newer songs, yet enthnomusicologist might point out that we do not no how old the songs are that are recorded, or how long such song lasted before.<br/>Some cultures renew their songs maybe every fifty years, although still they are based on older material.<br/>let us remember that the holocausts was based on the treatment of the American Indians. the Nazis studied such fine individuals as Kit Carson.</p><p>Most tribes share traditions at this point, those who don&apos;t know ask others in other tribes what they do. for example , even though my own tribe did sweat lodges, my own knowledge of it exist from other tribes. these songs, being highly sacred within the Chippewa were not recorded for this reason, as as far as i know are gone. that there are pictures of how they constructed their own made it that i have been able to preserve this element.<br/>all else has been communicated through the process of the ceremony, but there are big holes. still one of the most powerful activites i have been involved in.<br/>Harold is right to point out the predominance of pentatonic melodies. Many of these though appear to be on quite different one, as well as as much as 30% of some tribes might be outside of this. I tend to look at each one individually and go fro the oldest sources one can get.</p><p>This music though was and continues to be influential,  but a bit too lengthy to go into this.</p><p>On the other hand , i have a grandmother who was a serb, an opposite problem these days</p><p> &gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   -- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=65140 href="#65140">ðŸ”—</a>harold_fortuin &#x3C;harold_fortuin@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2006 11:28:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yahya,</p><p>Here are some resources to help you find audio recordings.</p><p>There aren&apos;t many on the web that I&apos;ve found - living in the US,<br/>it&apos;s generally easier to go to an institution like a museum or Native<br/>cultural event (pow-wow, say) to buy recordings.
