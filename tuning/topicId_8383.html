R. McClure in a brilliant article in the first issue of the _Galpin<br/>Society Journal_ (1949), is rather difficult to tune and will therefore be<br/>omitted here.&quot;</p><p>Zarlino&apos;s favored temperament in his publications of 1558 and 1571 is<br/>2/7-comma meantone, which results in major and minor thirds 1/7 comma from<br/>just, and also in a just chromatic semitone at 25:24, ~71 cents (or two<br/>sytonic commas narrower than the Pythagorean apotome at 2187:2048, ~114<br/>cents).</p><p>Since I haven&apos;t seen the McClure article, I&apos;m not sure about exactly what<br/>flavor of meantone it describes, although Lindley associates this tuning<br/>with Zarlino&apos;s. One might infer that the temperament is greater than<br/>1/4-comma but less than 1/3-comma (with pure minor thirds).</p><p>An interesting exponent of Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma tuning is Vincenzo Galilei,<br/>who finds it the best choice for plucked keyboards although he considers<br/>12-tet with equal semitones (as tuned on the lute) in principal the ideal<br/>tuning. I find it noteworthy that although he takes equal semitones as the<br/>theoretical ideal, he prefers a keyboard temperament of a bit more than<br/>1/4-comma -- agreeing with Zarlino, whom he often debates in his writings.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
