Untrained listeners&apos;<br/>responses follow the assumed patterns less closely, and non-western<br/>listeners will often use different categorizations entirely. A<br/>listener from a region in Africa using equipentatonic scales (or<br/>thereabouts) might place a Pythagorean major third into a different<br/>cognitive category than a just one.</p><p>&gt; 2) Likewise, is there a consensus on how high-up in harmonic series<br/>&gt; that acutally matters to the ear, in the functional harmony common<br/>&gt; chord practice, or interms of actual hearing, and not tuning<br/>math?.</p><p>It depends on which of the psychoacoustical phenomena that favor<br/>integer ratios your music is relying on. For music which moves along<br/>at a pretty decent clip, uses softer timbres, and is not too loud,<br/>the most important phenomenon is the virtual pitch phenomenon. Unless<br/>you have a lot of notes in your chords, this phenomenon makes chords<br/>sound very stable and unified only if you&apos;re using the lower numbers<br/>in the harmonic series. But there are kinds of music where higher<br/>numbers are used and it most definitely matters to the ear. Such<br/>music tends to use very long, sustained sonorities. The relevant<br/>phenomena are beating (which allows you to tune ratios as complex as<br/>17:13 by ear) and combinational tones (which get you even higher up<br/>the harmonic series).</p><p>&gt; We had a long discussion about this.  Is this related simply to the<br/>&gt; low amplitude of the higher harmonics, or to the fact that they are<br/>&gt; multiples of lower numbers?   We were puzzled by the high harmonic<br/>&gt; numbers used to spell chords which we saw in your postings.</p><p>Do you consider the numbers in 6:7:9:11 to be high harmonic numbers?</p><p>&gt; Our<br/>&gt; main concern was that some of these intervals reduce down to a<br/>small<br/>&gt; number ratio (eg, 10-8, vs. 5-4),</p><p>Hmm . . . which postings are you speaking of? I never saw any mention<br/>of a 10:8 interval, unless there was some other context that would<br/>make it necessary not to express it as 5:4 . . . (?)</p><p>&gt; and it also seems to work against<br/>&gt; the much talked about idea that the ear &apos;hears the small number<br/>&gt; ratios much more strongly.  Again, we are sticking to the moment to<br/>&gt; functional harmony, which, in its limited way, does not adress<br/>&gt; timbre and interesting acoustical phenomonon.  (Hope were not being<br/>&gt; irrelavant to your expertise.)</p><p>Western functional harmony arose in the tuning system called meantone<br/>temperament, not in equal temperament. I believe that harmonic series<br/>ratios from the first 6-8 harmonics are relevant here, with a few<br/>additional harmonics perhaps relevant in jazz harmony. There&apos;s also a<br/>possibility that the 19th harmonic has a role in explaining certain<br/>features in the evolution away from Picardy thirds.</p><p>I&apos;d love to discuss all this in much more detail. But what&apos;s more<br/>interesting to me personally is finding new analogues to the<br/>functional harmonic system, based often on non-diatonic scales, which<br/>may be based on these same harmonic series relationships or ones a<br/>little higher in the series too.</p><p>Best,<br/>Paul</p></div><h3><a id=57206 href="#57206">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2005 11:02:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;edfg555&quot; &lt;edfg555@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Ahh!

I&apos;m still under the impression that 12-ET is necessary<br/>&gt; for functional harmony,</p><p>You can do functional harmony in 19-equal, or in 7/26-comma meantone<br/>tuning, just to name two other examples. I recommend Easley<br/>Blackwood&apos;s book _The Structure Of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_ if<br/>you can get a hold of it.</p><p>&gt; or at least, that the fine distinctions in<br/>&gt; cent values of differently tuned intervals takes a &apos;back seat&apos; if<br/>&gt; the harmony is &apos;functional&apos; (ie, with progressions, etc, which I<br/>&gt; realize comprises sonice and timbre interest...)</p><p>Until about 1800, there was a strong distinction between the tuning<br/>of &quot;enharmonically-equivalent&quot; notes such as G# and Ab. Only with<br/>Beethoven did composers begin to strongly rely on an assumption of a<br/>closed 12-tone tuning system in their music. Functional harmony was<br/>well-established since about 1670, and augmented or diminished<br/>intervals were tuned very differently in 1670 than they are today.<br/>While 12-equal may well preserve the &apos;functions&apos; of late 17th century<br/>music, the reverse is clearly not the case -- you couldn&apos;t perform<br/>Beethoven&apos;s Appassionata sonata in a 1670 tuning. And aesthetically,<br/>I feel that 1670 music sounds much more beautiful, and aesthetically<br/>balanced, in a 1670 tuning than in 12-note equal temperament.<br/>Surely &apos;function&apos; shouldn&apos;t blind us to these aesthetic issues.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;We were puzzled by the high harmonic numbers used to spell chords<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;which we saw in your postings.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Can you cite any examples here?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Arg... can&apos;t find the exact post now, but I recall that in<br/>referring<br/>&gt; to a &apos;major sixth chord&apos; (eg, c-e-g), a higher number version was<br/>&gt; used (9-11-15...or was it 8-10-13), on the grounds of considering<br/>&gt; each chord &quot;As It Appears In The Series&quot;.</p><p>I don&apos;t think that represented a consensus opinion here by any means -<br/>- did you read the follow-ups? In fact, I think the person who wrote<br/>that has never even once mentioned a single specific tuning system<br/>they were using, be it 12-equal or anything else. So what was behind<br/>those posts remains a mystery to me.</p><p>&gt; I just wonder if the ear,<br/>&gt; or brain processing or whatever, actually relates to the chord<br/>&gt; as &apos;high numbers in the series&apos; when it could just as well (?) hear<br/>&gt; (again, archetypically) a major third and a perfect 4th.</p><p>I think it&apos;s both and neither :) Seriously, the issue is complicated,<br/>and I believe thinking about it has to start with the psychoacoustic<br/>phenomena which make small-integer ratios relevant in the first<br/>place. It&apos;s what happens between the production of the sounds and<br/>their appreciation in our minds -- what happens in the ear and brain -<br/>- that must be invoked here. Unless you want to go down the mystical<br/>path and assume that the numbers themselves directly affect our<br/>souls, or whatnot . . . but I prefer the skeptical approach myself.</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3><a id=57208 href="#57208">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

It started on<br/>the Mills College list server, and flourished there for several<br/>years. When that server had to retire, this list was moved to<br/>Onelist. The only category that Onelist had that seemed to fit<br/>was &quot;songwriting&quot; -- the feeling expressed about putting the tuning<br/>list in that category at the time were, it seemed to me, were &quot;well,<br/>that&apos;s not a great category to put the tuning list in, but there<br/>aren&apos;t any others that qualify, so here we go.&quot; Meanwhile, the<br/>description of this list which is on the home page was copied word-<br/>for-word from the old tuning list. So if there&apos;s anything which<br/>carries the &quot;intent&quot; of this list, it&apos;s that description, and not<br/>the fact that the list was placed in the &quot;songwriting&quot; category.</p><p>Music as poetry and as magic plays a huge role in my life; I won&apos;t<br/>go on and on about that.</p><p>Anyway, science? I don&apos;t think there&apos;s much science here at all. But<br/>for as long as this list has been around, questions of<br/>psychoacoustics (not a hard science, but an embryonic field of<br/>phenomenological study) have come up. And often, it&apos;s indeed with<br/>some trepidation: &quot;I don&apos;t know if this question belongs here,<br/>but . . .&quot; Now, I&apos;d hate for there to be _yet another_ list that<br/>questions here need to be re-directed to if an answer which touches<br/>on psychoacoustics or neurology is to be allowed -- I was not happy<br/>with all the list-splitting that has happened before. But OK, if all<br/>the questions about human hearing need to be answered poetically (?)<br/>here, so be it . . . if and when I have time, I&apos;ll start a<br/>psychoacoustics list (since there wasn&apos;t one last time I checked),<br/>and (gulp) re-direct people there next time I want to give them<br/>a &quot;scientific&quot; reply.</p><p>Did you mean math? Don&apos;t you use the Eikosany tuning? Gene<br/>independently discovered this and other CPS scales in the 1960&apos;s by<br/>considering the so-called &quot;deep holes&quot; in the lattice. I mean, of<br/>course you aren&apos;t going to be thinking about math or science when<br/>you&apos;re composing or improvising -- you listen, become one with the<br/>music, and let the magic/poetry/emotion/spirit move you. But to come<br/>up with the tuning in the first place . . . is one of the things<br/>this list is about, and it would be strange for you to deprecate the<br/>kinds of investigations that lead to the very tunings you use, IMHO.</p><p>Well, whatever -- I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll have a good laugh about this when<br/>we finally get together and jam. I realize that my tone in writing<br/>can seem condescending at times (and that *is* totally my fault) --<br/>I think you&apos;re in for a pleasant surprise when we interact in<br/>person. I guess I&apos;m cursed with a piece of brain that wants to find<br/>out the &quot;whethers&quot; and &quot;whys&quot; of things through direct experiential<br/>evidence. Luckily, that piece of brain can do little but sit in<br/>wonder when the musical &quot;magic&quot; starts happening . . . and often<br/>continues well into the morning!</p><p>Speaking of jamming, a shameless plug: This Wednesday night is my<br/>night at the Burren (247 Elm St. Davis Square, Somerville, MA, USA --<br/> from Boston or Cambridge, take the Red Line to Davis Sq.), with two<br/>of my rhythm-oriented, improv-oriented musical groups playing in the<br/>back room (the room with the stage), and I&apos;ll be having a party<br/>afterwards, so I&apos;d love any local list readers to come down and say<br/>hi -- meeting in person is always so much more rewarding<br/>than &quot;meeting in ASCII&quot; :)</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3><a id=57255 href="#57255">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/2005 2:14:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi George,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

That means, to me,<br/>&gt;that it&apos;s about poetry, not science.</p><p>Hi Pete,</p><p>I know it must seem very small of me right now to bring up this<br/>pedantic point, but: the tuning list didn&apos;t start here on Yahoo, or<br/>its predecessor eGroups, or its predecessor Onelist. It started on<br/>the Mills College list server, and flourished there for several<br/>years. When that server had to retire, this list was moved to<br/>Onelist. The only category that Onelist had that seemed to fit<br/>was &quot;songwriting&quot; -- the feeling expressed about putting the tuning<br/>list in that category at the time were, it seemed to me, were &quot;well,<br/>that&apos;s not a great category to put the tuning list in, but there<br/>aren&apos;t any others that qualify, so here we go.&quot; Meanwhile, the<br/>description of this list which is on the home page was copied word-<br/>for-word from the old tuning list. So if there&apos;s anything which<br/>carries the &quot;intent&quot; of this list, it&apos;s that description, and not<br/>the fact that the list was placed in the &quot;songwriting&quot; category.</p><p>Music as poetry and as magic plays a huge role in my life; I won&apos;t<br/>go on and on about that.</p><p>Anyway, science? I don&apos;t think there&apos;s much science here at all. But<br/>for as long as this list has been around, questions of<br/>psychoacoustics (not a hard science, but an embryonic field of<br/>phenomenological study) have come up. And often, it&apos;s indeed with<br/>some trepidation: &quot;I don&apos;t know if this question belongs here,<br/>but . . .&quot; Now, I&apos;d hate for there to be _yet another_ list that<br/>questions here need to be re-directed to if an answer which touches<br/>on psychoacoustics or neurology is to be allowed -- I was not happy<br/>with all the list-splitting that has happened before. But OK, if all<br/>the questions about human hearing need to be answered poetically (?)<br/>here, so be it . . . if and when I have time, I&apos;ll start a<br/>psychoacoustics list (since there wasn&apos;t one last time I checked),<br/>and (gulp) re-direct people there next time I want to give them<br/>a &quot;scientific&quot; reply.</p><p>Did you mean math? Don&apos;t you use the Eikosany tuning? Gene<br/>independently discovered this and other CPS scales in the 1960&apos;s by<br/>considering the so-called &quot;deep holes&quot; in the lattice. I mean, of<br/>course you aren&apos;t going to be thinking about math or science when<br/>you&apos;re composing or improvising -- you listen, become one with the<br/>music, and let the magic/poetry/emotion/spirit move you. But to come<br/>up with the tuning in the first place . . . is one of the things<br/>this list is about, and it would be strange for you to deprecate the<br/>kinds of investigations that lead to the very tunings you use, IMHO.</p><p>Well, whatever -- I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll have a good laugh about this when<br/>we finally get together and jam. I realize that my tone in writing<br/>can seem condescending at times (and that *is* totally my fault) --<br/>I think you&apos;re in for a pleasant surprise when we interact in<br/>person.

We can reduce an interval to its octave-class<br/>representative by</p><p>red(q) = 2^(-ordp(q,3)-ordp(q,5)-ordp(q,7)) * 3^ordp(q,3) 5^ordp(q,5)<br/>7^ordp(q,7)</p><p>where ordp is the p-adic valuation, meaning the monzo coordinate value<br/>corresponding to the prime p, so that</p><p>q = 2^ordp(2,q) 3^ordp(3,q) 5^ordp(5,q) 7^ordp(7,q)</p><p>If |w x y z&gt; is a monzo, then red(|w x y z&gt;)  = |-x-y-z x y z&gt;.</p><p>We now find the symmetrical lattice of octave classes, with its<br/>octahedra and tetrahedra and so forth, is just the sublattice of<br/>reduced representatives, under the Eulicidean metric. For example the<br/>cps {3,5,7,15,21,35} reduces to {3/2,5/2,7/2,15/4,21/4,35/4}, or in<br/>monzo terms {|-1 1 0 0&gt;, |-1 0 1 0&gt;, |-1 0 0 1&gt;, |-2 1 1 0&gt;,<br/>|-2 1 0 1&gt;, |-2 0 1 1&gt;}. It is easy to verify that these are the<br/>verticies of an octahedron in four-dimensional space, so here you have<br/>the hexany sitting inside of a cubic (4D) lattice.</p></div><h3><a id=57294 href="#57294">ðŸ”—</a>Pete McRae &#x3C;ambassadorbob@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2005 3:40:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:ekin@lumma.org">ekin@lumma.org</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;In the bigger picture, of course, you&apos;re right.

The hexany is an octahedron, and the dual polytope to<br/>that is a cube. If you stellate the octohedron, the centers of the<br/>tetrahedra, representing 7-limit tetrads, are in a cube. If you take<br/>the lattice of 7-limit intervals in its symmetrical form, you get a<br/>lattice called &quot;A3&quot; or &quot;face-centered cubic&quot;. This lattice has two<br/>sizes of hole, the &quot;deep holes&quot; are the octahedrons, and the &quot;shallow<br/>holes&quot; tetrahedrons. If you make lattice points out of the centers of<br/>the tetrahedrons, you are making a lattice of the 7-limit tetrads.<br/>This is simply the cubic lattice, called &quot;Z3&quot;. The dual lattice to A3,<br/>A3*, is the &quot;body-centered cubic lattice&quot;. This can be defined as the<br/>lattice of all triples of integers (x,y,z) where either x, y  and z<br/>are all even, or they are all odd.

But I thought this list<br/>was about discussing tuning and helping people to grasp tuning<br/>concepts for themselves, so that (for example) they can (if they<br/>wish) climb the same mountains and view the same vistas that have<br/>been viewed before, and perhaps also see something that no human has<br/>seen before. To me, the climb relevant in this particular case is a<br/>pretty straightforward one, that anyone with enough interest can<br/>pursue.

I believe that if you, or anyone else on this<br/>list, pursues certain theoretical questions, such as how to display<br/>all the consonances in a tuning system at a glance, perhaps getting<br/>help from others if they need some math they haven&apos;t learned,<br/>you/they will naturally see how the CPS scales arise. Perhaps this<br/>kind of theoretical thinking doesn&apos;t interest you, and (like many<br/>people) it is painful for you to engage in. I see nothing wrong with<br/>that. But . . . oops I have to run to rehearsal right now, let&apos;s<br/>continue this later, OK? Maybe on another list. On this list, maybe<br/>we can instead discuss the relevant tuning concepts and constructs<br/>themselves, as has been done in the past, such as in 2000:</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/paul-cps.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/paul-cps.htm</a></p><p>where I gave Erv Wilson credit for &quot;best single illustration of the<br/>CPS concept&quot; among other things . . .</p><p>P.S. Sorry I remembered wrong. It appears that Erv Wilson is indeed<br/>the earliest we know of to write down any Eikosany scales.

There are other ways also to map to an octahedron that do not involve the 2 out of 4 set where the products are reduced into a single point in the set. The former was done by Fuller for one who made a big to do over it<br/>I am quite aware of being a lunatic, but all true beginnings always look like madness. Still i await a concrete example of combination product sets as such.<br/>the discovery of this was not some accidental discovery. Erv has stated that the moon flights were instrumental in conceiving of such weightless structures.  In retrospect salso he has pointed out to me the diagram on Page 123 of Partch&apos;s Genesis of a Music ( a book he did quite a few of the diagrams for) and finds that possibly this chart might have halso had an influence on him if one thinks for these as a product into tones instead of triads.  Regardless , it takes something to realize the signigance of this structure and what it can do musically.
