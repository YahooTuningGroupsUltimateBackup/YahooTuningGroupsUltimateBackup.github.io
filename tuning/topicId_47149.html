I hadn&apos;t<br/>heard Robert Walker&apos;s &quot;enhancement&quot; either.  What are the small<br/>loud &quot;blips&quot; that occur every now and then??  Did a comet get in?</p><p>In any case, one of the more remarkable aspects of this project was<br/>the fact that it was really &quot;web-art&quot; of a certain kind.  I remember<br/>the weekend that you stayed up all night and posted throughout the<br/>night as well, so that people could follow along, almost like a kind<br/>of &quot;happening&quot; or at least an &quot;event&quot; of some kind.</p><p>So *that* was a dimension of the artwork for *me* as well.</p><p>Thanks again, and, yes, it has a bookmark...</p><p>Joe</p></div><h3><a id=47190 href="#47190">ðŸ”—</a>czhang23@aol.com</h3><span>9/24/2003 10:43:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; hi Joe Pehrson, and anyone else who&apos;s interested,</p><p>    ::raises hand &amp; paw --- my hand &amp; the resident cat&apos;s paw::</p><p>&gt; after only 3 years, i&apos;ve finally made a webpage about</p><p>&gt; my Solar System piece ... which is *still* in only the</p><p>&gt; most rudimentary form, compared to the wonderfully dynamic</p><p>&gt; piece that i hope to eventually turn it into.</p><p>    I think it would eventually make a wonderful soundscape/sound<br/>installation in the San Francisco Exploratorium.
