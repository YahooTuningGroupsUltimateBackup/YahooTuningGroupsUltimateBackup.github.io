Anyone else out there fond of the minor 7th chord?<br/>Considering a 3-note version such as d-f-c&apos; (JI intervals 6/5:3/2),<br/>can anyone think of any other common chord (in closed position) whose<br/>component intervals&apos; numerators (6 and 3) are in a 2:1 ratio?  (And<br/>the outer interval is 9/5, making for a niftly litte 3-ness...)   The<br/>only other chord I can think of (in the denominator) is the major<br/>seventh chord 5/4:3/2.</p><p>For the chord d-f-c&apos;, could having the 2:1 ratio (of 6/5 and 3/2) be<br/>equivalent, in a way, to having an octave in the chord (even though<br/>its 6 and 3, and not a power of two), and thus imparting some sort<br/>of &apos;chord energy&quot;?</p><p>Thanks, Kelly</p></div>
