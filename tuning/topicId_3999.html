When I compose the chord<br/>16:20:24:27, I wish to hear the 27/20 interval as itself, not tempered to<br/>better approximate a 4/3. Similarly, when I compose in a temperament onto<br/>which the nearest approximate of 27/20 and 4/3 is the same interval, I wish<br/>to hear this interval as tempered.* I consider the problem of making these<br/>interval audible as themselves to be a compositional problem, not a<br/>psychoacoustical one. Psychoacoustics tells us a lot, but, operating within<br/>very narrow parameters within which music is construed, precious little about<br/>our potential for hearing.</p><p>It was Nicholas of Cusa (1401-1464)  who described the difference between<br/>logic and faith or knowing and truth in terms of a circle and an n-sided<br/>polygon inscribed within the circle. Logic, or knowing, is like the polygon:<br/>the more sides you add, the more complexities, the closer the polygon<br/>approaches the circle.  But at the same time, it gets farther away from the<br/>circle. For the the circle is a single, seamless line, while the polygon is<br/>formed of ever more line segments and angles, broken up into ever more parts.<br/>No matter how large n may become, no matter how closely the polygon<br/>approximates the circle, it never reaches the circle. Nicholas described the<br/>leap from tangent to arc, from endlessly compounded multiplicity to<br/>singleness in terms of _grace_.</p><p>Personally, I find it more interesting, elegant, beautiful to see -- and to<br/>make audible -- the difference between the simple form and the complex<br/>approximation than to ignore their differences as a sign of grace. _Grace_,<br/>I&apos;ll save for a desperate hour.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Frankfurt-am-Main</p><p>_________<br/>* This is not unrelated to the discussion on possible just tunings for the<br/>&apos;augmented triad&apos; .  The discussion was framed in terms of the sonority as it<br/>is found in a given temperament, not in terms of the compositional contexts<br/>in which it is used within that temperament. For example, (0,4,8) may be the<br/>best mapping in 12tet of the 7:9:11 triad, I know of no 12tet repertoire<br/>where such a just interpretation could unambiguously be made.  On the other<br/>hand, an interpretation of Eb G B (natural) in c minor in terms of two 5/4<br/>thirds, or even a 5/4 with an 81/64 above seems not only reasonable, but the<br/>implied &apos;bitonality&apos; of the sonority, has a certain amount of interpretive<br/>power for familiar repertoire.</p></div><h3><a id=4024 href="#4024">ðŸ”—</a>A440A@xxx.xxx</h3><span>7/26/1999 1:20:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Greetings all,<br/>Daniel Wolf writes:<br/>&gt;It was Nicholas of Cusa (1401-1464)  who described the difference between<br/>&gt;logic and faith or knowing and truth in terms of a circle and an n-sided<br/>&gt;polygon inscribed within the circle.</p><p>What a great post!  Thanks.</p><p>    I have only the regret that I didn&apos;t read this post earlier.  I have just<br/>returned from the Piano Technician&apos;s Guild&apos;s National Covention in Kansas<br/>City, where I would have found SOME place to have used it in my talk.  While<br/>there,  I presented two classes about unequal tunings on modern acoustic<br/>pianos, and got a good reception.  This is great news to many of us, since<br/>the subject of temperament variety is easily the most controversial in the<br/>Guild and while the bickering was going on between small minorities, the<br/>large body of potential converts began to lose interest in even hearing about<br/>them.  Hopefully my class, and one from Dave Lameroux ,(who often maintains<br/>the pianos at the Smithsonian) have begun to reverse that trend.<br/>    A very interesting item I learned was from Dr. Al Sanderson, inventor of<br/>the Sanderson Accu-Tuner.   He said that pianists in the northeast region<br/>where he is are increasingly requesting various temperaments on the pianos<br/>for perfomances.  This is a strong sign that the temperament revival is<br/>healthy and growing.<br/>    Though this may be of limited interest to the microtonalist &quot;math<br/>monsters&quot; ( to quote H&apos;stick, I think),  next year there is a &quot;Piano 300&quot;<br/>program shared by many major museums.  There will be much made of the early<br/>historical instruments, and hence, there will be something of a pulpit for<br/>the early guys to tout their tunings.<br/>    Under this legitimizing aura of respectibility that comes from  big names<br/>getting involved, the public awareness may be more accessible to the wide<br/>variety of tuning enthusiasts.  I know many of us see teaching as important a<br/>part of what we are doing as perfoming, and the inequalites of the past may,<br/>in demonstration, suggest  a new avenue of investigation in the future.  To<br/>this end, I am concerning myself with the use of a variety of temperaments on<br/>the grand pianos for modern as well as old music and have found a number of<br/>&quot;Victorian&quot; style tunings that just turn the color on for Jazz as well as<br/>much earlier music.<br/>Anyhow,  some may want to keep their ears open for historical events next<br/>year,  pianos are still big business.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Precision Piano Works<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=4026 href="#4026">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/1999 4:50:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:A440A@aol.com">A440A@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;     Though this may be of limited interest to the microtonalist &quot;math<br/>&gt; monsters&quot; ( to quote H&apos;stick, I think),  next year there is a &quot;Piano 300&quot;<br/>&gt; program shared by many major museums.
