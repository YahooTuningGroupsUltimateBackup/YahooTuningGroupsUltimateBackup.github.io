However I<br/>believe Schoenberg left a lot of his discussion of<br/>the overtones out of his later (1920 I believe)<br/>edition of Harmonielehre so that in that later<br/>edition he seems more totally accepting of the<br/>12 note per octave equal temperament system.</p><p>    Dave Hill    La Mesa, CA</p></div>
