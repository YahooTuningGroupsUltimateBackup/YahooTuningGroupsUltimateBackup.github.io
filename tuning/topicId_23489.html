A new poll has been created for the<br/>&gt; tuning group:</p><p>[snip]</p><p>&gt; To vote, please visit the following web page:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/polls">/tuning/polls</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note: Please do not reply to this message. Poll votes are<br/>&gt; not collected via email. To vote, you must go to the Yahoo! Groups<br/>&gt; web site listed above.</p><p>Ha! Does anyone else think that requiring voters to open up a web browser,<br/>cut-and-paste the link from above, wait to log-in to Yahoo, click around<br/>an ad or two, then click somewhere to register a vote, is going to appeal<br/>more to those list members who prefer the web than to those of us who<br/>prefer text/email? Please, don&apos;t base any decision about moving or not on<br/>such a poll.</p><p>Judging by the number of posts for and against a move to Chris&apos;s majordomo<br/>server, opinion would seem evenly split. However, the posts against are<br/>all from Joe P. And I don&apos;t mean Joe&apos;s opinion should be ignored, or any<br/>disrespect to Joe, but there are many more voices for a move away from<br/>yahoo, and many valid reasons given for not wanting to be on a commercial<br/>website.</p><p>Re Gene&apos;s usenet proposal: the objection that usenet has a poor interface<br/>is misinformed; there are as many &quot;interfaces&quot; to usenet as there are<br/>newsreaders--it&apos;s like saying you don&apos;t like the interface to email or the<br/>interface to ftp. However I think a list like this, with a fairly small<br/>posting community, is best kept on a members-only basis, even if<br/>membership is completely open. Reason being, some folks are already<br/>annoyed at the amount of chattiness on the list which means there&apos;s not<br/>time to read everything, and they will no doubt miss something interesting<br/>now and then. If we were on usenet, continually getting any J.Random User<br/>surfing in from google groups and treating usenet like a chat room, or if<br/>we got spammers on the newsgroup, more and more contributors would be<br/>driven away.</p><p>The list has moved before, three times since I&apos;ve been reading, and<br/>survived each time. Interested people will find us wherever we are. With<br/>Chris&apos;s proposal we get a dedicated list administrator (not meaning this<br/>as an insult to our yahoo list owner, but rather to yahoo themselves who<br/>have screwed things up and doubtless will do so again), much more server<br/>space for files, and Columbia is not going to disappear any time soon. The<br/>move away from the commercial web, far from being a move back to the dark<br/>ages, is a no-brainer and clearly the right thing--it will just take a<br/>little amount of getting through teething problems for some members who<br/>are so far less comfortable with text mediums. But the time spent getting<br/>readjusted will be made up for very quickly by less time spent clicking<br/>around ads, waiting to log on, etc. I hope we move, I hope Joe P stays and<br/>works through his discomforts with what most of us think is the right<br/>medium for a list like this, and I am positive that any one of a number of<br/>able people will be able to help him with any unresolved issue.</p><p>I really didn&apos;t mean to write so much, it just suddenly struck me that it<br/>would be a real shame to keep an inferior solution out of inertia alone<br/>--Jon</p></div><h3><a id=36282 href="#36282">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2002 9:55:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_23489.html#36281">/tuning/topicId_23489.html#36281</a></p><p> I hope we move, I hope Joe P stays and<br/>&gt; works through his discomforts with what most of us think is the<br/>right medium for a list like this, and I am positive that any one of<br/>a number of able people will be able to help him with any unresolved<br/>issue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I really didn&apos;t mean to write so much, it just suddenly struck me<br/>that it would be a real shame to keep an inferior solution out of<br/>inertia alone<br/>&gt; --Jon</p><p>***Hi Jon!</p><p>Well, certainly I don&apos;t want to come off as the &quot;naysayer&quot; regarding<br/>a potential move, and I&apos;m also not fond of a &quot;commercial&quot; platform.</p><p>I&apos;m not exactly certain, though, who you are including as &quot;most of<br/>us.&quot;  Gene Ward Smith didn&apos;t like the Columbia list either as it<br/>stands, so there have been both positive and negative comments.</p><p>I really don&apos;t want to go back to reading individual e-mails or<br/>digests and responding to those.
