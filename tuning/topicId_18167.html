In that sense, don&apos;t have perfect pitch, but do seem to have<br/>absolute pitch, if one makes the distinction, as is sometimes made.</p><p>Wish I had a better sense of relative pitch, but it is kind of nice to perceive things<br/>this way too. (Guess you always want what you haven&apos;t got!)</p><p>But it is very much something one takes for granted, until ones attention is drawn to it.</p><p>I discovered it through trying the random chord quiz in FTS, and finding that I can&apos;t tell<br/>the difference between a major and a minor chord, or even coarser distinctions like<br/>between a 6/5 and a 4/3, if they are played one after another at random transpositions<br/>of pitch, out of any musical context.</p><p>I can tell them apart if there is some melodic context to key in a sense of relative<br/>pitch.<br/>It is there somewhere, but not available for analysis of single intervals. At least, not<br/>at present anyway,..</p><p>Robert.</p></div>
