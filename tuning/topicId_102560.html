Algorithmically, you could generate a<br/>subgroup containing all of the harmonics that are deemed to &quot;appear&quot;<br/>in some EDO, like 24-EDO, up to infinity. Then, you can generate a<br/>huge, infinitely large, single chord, containing the 24-EDO tempered<br/>version of those harmonics, making them drop off in volume as<br/>successive harmonics increase in complexity, and also perhaps in<br/>error. This would lead to the most concordant sound possible in<br/>24-EDO.

You probably<br/>won&apos;t be able to pick out individual notes anymore.

I have a few comments:</p><p>1) OK, but this is precisely why I don&apos;t like the name &quot;24-ET.&quot; People<br/>sometimes talk about &quot;the difference between 24-EDO and 24-ET.&quot; I<br/>totally understand what you&apos;re saying, but what exactly is 24-ET? The<br/>7-limit patent val? The 7-limit val with lowest error? If we find a<br/>better error function than TE next year, will it all change?</p><p>2) For the record, I think that some aspects of what you said -<br/>missing the forest for the trees - apply to the way some people treat<br/>the relationship between ratios and categories. That&apos;s why I&apos;m so<br/>fascinated with them. It took me a month of playing 11-limit harmony<br/>in 22-EDO for the sound of intervals like 11/8 or 9/7 by itself to<br/>completely change. It took me another month of playing in 16-EDO for<br/>the sound of the 675 cent fifths to change. This is what I keep saying<br/>was Ron&apos;s insight in exploring 16-EDO (who turned him onto that<br/>tuning, anyway?). In retrospect the notion that out of the infinitude<br/>of EDOs (or even temperaments) out there, that only a tiny fraction<br/>are &quot;musically useful&quot; because of &quot;psychoacoustics,&quot; was such a<br/>terrible limitation that I can&apos;t believe I ever thought that was the<br/>case. It limited the type of training that I was willing to engage in,<br/>and hence limited the results I got from such training, which finally<br/>circularly reinforced my limited psychoacoustic ideas that this is<br/>&quot;just the way things are.&quot;</p><p>3) I&apos;ve since come around that things work more easily if 14-EDO is a<br/>&quot;tuning system&quot; which implements the 7p &quot;temperament,&quot; but then I wish<br/>that we had a linear algebra-based approach to looking at untempered<br/>&quot;tuning systems.&quot; Maybe we could get what you called &quot;scale theory&quot;<br/>out of the dark ages then.</p><p>4) Since the theme of this last month has been to heap praise on<br/>Keenan Pepper, I think it&apos;s worth noting that he&apos;s the first person in<br/>recent memory to stop arguing over names and definitions, just use<br/>whatever people want, and continue to pursue the goal of applying<br/>mathematics to music theory. And that spirit has permeated almost<br/>every discussion on tuning-math since then, and I hope it continues.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=102575 href="#102575">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2012 4:05:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; In retrospect the notion that out of the infinitude<br/>&gt; of EDOs (or even temperaments) out there, that only a tiny fraction<br/>&gt; are &quot;musically useful&quot; because of &quot;psychoacoustics,&quot; was such a<br/>&gt; terrible limitation that I can&apos;t believe I ever thought that was the<br/>&gt; case.</p><p>You speak of this as a strange, new idea when in fact it is extremely common--in fact, in good measure, the whole microtonal thing has been a reaction against this dogma.

But I doubt it.  When<br/>I switched to Dvorak I forgot QWERTY (which I first learned<br/>at age 14).  But people who go to China and speak nothing but<br/>Chinese don&apos;t forget their native language (first learned at<br/>age 0).</p><p>And that&apos;s assuming it&apos;s learned.

At any rate I hardly<br/>&gt; think it&apos;s an improvement on &quot;ET&quot;. &quot;ED2&quot; might be an<br/>&gt; improvement and I&apos;ve been considering switching to it.</p><p>I remember Igs said he was going to start using it because then we can<br/>say that 13-EDO has 2/1-oct period, and 13-EDT has 3/1-oct period,<br/>whereas 13-ET is ambiguous. Then I heard ED2 and ED3 used as<br/>alternatives. I thought that was a good idea so I started using it.</p><p>Then I remember hearing someone, like Paul, talk about the difference<br/>between 24-EDO and 24-ET, and not to get them confused, and that was<br/>the first time I heard of that. And I&apos;ve heard people here and there<br/>make the same sort of distinction. And I think it&apos;s a bad one unless<br/>ET specifically means &quot;the patent val of whatever division you just<br/>wrote with 2/1 as period.&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt; 2) For the record, I think that some aspects of what you<br/>&gt; &gt; said - missing the forest for the trees - apply to the way<br/>&gt; &gt; some people treat the relationship between ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; and categories.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To whom are you referring!?</p><p>I wasn&apos;t talking about you, just a general vibe in the community.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s a bit like saying meat isn&apos;t the only important food.<br/>&gt; Of course meat isn&apos;t the only important food, but it IS an<br/>&gt; important food. It remains important even if you&apos;re a<br/>&gt; vegetarian. It&apos;s especially important if you&apos;re vegan.<br/>&gt; To say meat isn&apos;t an important food is to definitely join<br/>&gt; the ranks of nihilism. And from this day on I will quote<br/>&gt; the Big Lebowski whenever you or Igs make some remark about<br/>&gt; how 13 sounds just as concordant as 31.</p><p>I don&apos;t think I ever said that. I said that 13 can stop sounding like<br/>crap if you get used to it. And, I also happen to think that it can<br/>sound just as &quot;pleasant&quot; as 31 in the right circumstances, because<br/>there&apos;s more to musical pleasantness than playing accurate otonal<br/>chords.</p><p>If you doubt the power of very, very sharp fifths to sound very, very<br/>beautiful, bright, and -not- dissonant under the right circumstances,<br/>I totally disagree in every way possible. But to the extent that the<br/>word &quot;concordant&quot; means &quot;activates the missing fundamental<br/>phenomenon,&quot; and after our recent conversation on Facebook I&apos;m no<br/>longer sure that it does to you, I&apos;ll obviously never make the claim<br/>that 13 does that as well as 31.</p><p>&gt; My idea of a &quot;major third&quot; is a gestalt or categorical<br/>&gt; notion I learned through a lifetime of experience with<br/>&gt; diatonic music. It wraps up memories of that music, cliches<br/>&gt; of that music, emotions I&apos;ve had hearing and performing it.<br/>&gt; Contained in it are even motor memories of how to execute a<br/>&gt; major third with my vocal chords, with my lips when playing<br/>&gt; the trumpet, with my hands on a keyboard, etc.</p><p>This is true to the point that when I went to Paul&apos;s place up on<br/>Boston, and I played his Ensoniq keyboard, I was like &quot;wow, this<br/>tuning is great, what is it?&quot; And he was like &quot;12 notes of mavila.&quot; I<br/>noticed at that point that the major fingerings I was playing were<br/>actually producing minor chords, and then my brain rewired itself and<br/>they stopped sounding &quot;happy&quot; and major and started sounding &quot;sad&quot; and<br/>minor. I found that to be significant.</p><p>&gt; With enough training I can learn new categories based on<br/>&gt; other scales, other music, other experiences and emotions<br/>&gt; and so on. If the new categories happen to fall on<br/>&gt; discordances, I can get accustomed to them and learn to<br/>&gt; appreciate them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I cannot do is make 21:16 sound more concordant than<br/>&gt; 3:2. I can like 21:16 better than buttered toast, but next<br/>&gt; to 3:2 it will always sound discordant.</p><p>Paul on Facebook said that the word &quot;discordance&quot; basically means<br/>&quot;dissonance apart from any musical context.&quot; I&apos;m going to roll with<br/>that definition for now.</p><p>Consider the Bach retuning I posted in 75-EDO. Go listen to that, and<br/>tell me if you still can make out tritone resolutions and so on. I<br/>definitely can, at least as long as I can make the scale structure<br/>out. I hear major as happy, minor as sad, tritones as resolving, etc.<br/>In this case, the major thirds in the above example are rather close<br/>to 21/16, and the diminished fourths are rather close to 3/2, and in<br/>the context of the posted example the major thirds are consonant and<br/>the diminished fourths are dissonant.</p><p>One way to explain this is that I&apos;m just remembering the sound of 3/2<br/>for the generator, and remembering the sound of 7/5 or some unresolved<br/>crap for the tritone, and projecting that onto the 75-EDO map. That&apos;s<br/>one hypothesis, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s conclusively proven, and I&apos;m<br/>not sold on it. There could be something else at work that has to do<br/>with the melodic structure which we don&apos;t understand. There could be<br/>another item of data that goes into the &quot;major third&quot; bucket, other<br/>than 5/4-ness, that could cause a pleasant sensation when major thirds<br/>are played. Any such thing that could possibly exist, the discovery of<br/>which would surely revolutionize our little corner of science, would<br/>be completely missed by assuming the truth of that assumption and not<br/>considering if music is possibly a bit stranger than we think.</p><p>So now, the question is: assume a listener is a native 75-EDO<br/>listener, and we play a 3/2. They then categorize it as an augmented<br/>fourth, and it sounds like a dissonant tritone which happens to<br/>generate a strong VF. Then we play a 21/16, which they categorize as a<br/>major third, and it sounds like a consonant major third which happens<br/>to not generate a strong VF. To them, this is something they&apos;re<br/>hearing as an isolated dyad apart from any fragment of music, so it<br/>reasonably fits into the definition of &quot;concordance&quot; above. And it may<br/>be that &quot;discordance&quot;</p><p>&gt; If I go live in a cave and listen to nothing but 21:16 for<br/>&gt; weeks on end, with a synth whose timbre emphasizes 21:16,<br/>&gt; my brain may recruit some of the neurons that had been doing<br/>&gt; 3:2 and maybe I could flip it around. But I doubt it. When<br/>&gt; I switched to Dvorak I forgot QWERTY (which I first learned<br/>&gt; at age 14). But people who go to China and speak nothing but<br/>&gt; Chinese don&apos;t forget their native language (first learned at<br/>&gt; age 0).</p><p>What I know is that in the context of that 75-EDO Bach composition,<br/>21/16 is consonant and 3/2 is dissonant. Again, you might argue it&apos;s<br/>because I&apos;m &quot;remembering&quot; 5/4 and 3/2, but how do we know? That would<br/>imply some kind of &quot;imprinting&quot; hypothesis whereby categories are<br/>associated with ratios. I&apos;ve wrote about that possibility on here<br/>before, but I have my reservations about it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=102590 href="#102590">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2012 8:16:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Jan 6, 2012 at 11:15 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Consider the Bach retuning I posted in 75-EDO.

For example, I used to prefer 1000 cents to 7/4 because I<br/>knew (on a preconscious level) I couldn&apos;t split it into two &quot;perfect<br/>fourths,&quot; nor could I do all of the other things that I was used to<br/>doing in 12-EDO.

That people might want 738 cents for its own merits, and not as a 3/2, may have escaped their consideration.  I love the bloody interval, it&apos;s like instant nirvana to me.   I could sit and listen to all those partials swirling around each other for like 5 minutes straight and just trance out.  Well, as long as I play it with a mellow, pleasant timbre.  Can&apos;t say the same for 3/2, gets boring real quick.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=102637 href="#102637">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2012 1:46:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Jan 7, 2012 at 4:13 PM, cityoftheasleep &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If a single note can be the same thing as a harmony, then we&apos;re in some serious terminological trouble here.

The sound of<br/>&gt; the brass quintet was attributed to the timbre of the brass<br/>&gt; instruments rather than their timbre + their intonation,<br/>&gt; and the sound of keyboard instruments likewise.

The first time, your ear assumes the<br/>&gt; timbres are being distorted. This has nothing to do with<br/>&gt; interval size categories.
