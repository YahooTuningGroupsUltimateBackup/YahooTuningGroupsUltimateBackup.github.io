I am thinking about sorting the tunings in the scala<br/>archive so that it is easier to navigate, and find certain types of scales.<br/>My plan is to sort them by octave divisions first, and then possibly other<br/>devisions.  Would others be interested in having this edited archive, and<br/>how would you suggest that it be sorted and changed?</p><p>Steven Kallstrom</p></div>
