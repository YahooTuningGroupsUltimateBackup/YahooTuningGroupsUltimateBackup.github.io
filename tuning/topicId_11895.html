Well in fact there wasn&apos;t really any<br/>microtonal or justly intoned music advertised anywhere on the programmes<br/>of the Official or the Fringe festival. Apart from a few &quot;world&quot; music<br/>artists and perhaps a small a cappella ensemble or two who may or may<br/>not have produced music of non 12 tet interest, we were dished up the<br/>usual fare of Baroque, Classical and Romantic &quot;Masters&quot;. The highlight<br/>of the festival was the appearance of Pierre Boulez (erstwhile<br/>polemicist and revolutionary who now conducts with great expertise the<br/>tonal music that he found so regressive in his heyday). Still, he is a<br/>good conductor. Still no microtonal music.</p><p>Digging deeper I went to a recital of Guillaume de Machaut&apos;s Messe de<br/>Nostre Dame given by The Hilliard Ensemble. I know from having read a<br/>paper by their leader that they are very much aware of tuning, in<br/>particular of the Pythagorean possibilities of early choral music. Apart<br/>from the sheer awesome beauty and power of Machaut&apos;s music we were<br/>treated to a feast of crunchy thirds and spicy sevenths, with gorgeous<br/>pure fifths, fourths and octaves. Real Xeno-Gothic music and truly<br/>inspiring to composer&apos;s like myself in search of an  modern choral<br/>microtonal/modal idiom. I then attended an  rendition of Palestrina&apos;s<br/>mass &quot;Ego Fratres Enim&quot; by the Taverner Consort, another prestigious<br/>ensemble. I know from experience as a chorister that there are frequent<br/>opportunities in Renaissance polyphony to &apos;stretch and squeeze&apos; the<br/>intervals. Unfortunately, for me, this rendition was pinned down by a<br/>chamber organ and  a cornettino (early  trumpet). I felt that the organ<br/>(probably in 12 tet) and the cornettino (which seemed to have some<br/>tuning latitude as a result of embouchure) were out of tune with each<br/>other, though the cornettino did produce some interesting notes at<br/>cadences. The overall effect was that the singers didn&apos;t really get a<br/>chance to stretch out. I don&apos;t know enough about the piece to establish<br/>if this was the composer&apos;s arrangement or the Consort&apos;s but I felt<br/>slightly disappointed at the  inclusion of the organ. Please feel free<br/>to inform me on any of this.</p><p>Anyway, the star performance was tucked away just outside the church<br/>where Machaut&apos;s Mass was to be performed. A young American man called<br/>Lela was playing his own creation, the Stamenphone. Following a dream in<br/>which he was playing music on a flower, he designed this incredibly<br/>original instrument, more details of which can be seen at<br/><a href="http://www.lelavision.com">www.lelavision.com</a>. It is basically a metal gourd, the resonating<br/>chamber, from which a central vertical pole rises about seven feet high,<br/>capped by a metal vase. Piano strings are stretched at an angle  from<br/>the vase to the gourd and these strings are marked at the most important<br/>harmonic nodes with white marker paint. The strings are bowed with a<br/>cello bow and the other hand stops the nodes and/or bends the strings,<br/>fingers facing the strings. The music, in just intonation, was beautiful<br/>and the timbre cello-like in its rapid arpeggios but with the added<br/>interest of microtonal bends. Now, if the Hilliard Ensemble and this<br/>young man were to get together. . . . . .</p><p>Finally, a request. Next festival and maybe before, I would dearly love<br/>to set up performances of microtonal or J.I. music in and around<br/>Scotland. Any composers, performers, instrument builders, theorists in<br/>the region - please get in touch. Seems like there could be a gap in the<br/>market. Thanks to all the regular tunesters for a wonderful discussion<br/>forum.</p></div>
