Sorry if you&apos;ve seen this already.)</p><p>Know any Boston-area college or music school (or prof. or<br/>student in &apos;em) that could make a classroom available<br/>for a lecture-demo my microtonal keyboards for up to 2<br/>hours? Or some other similar place? (preferably<br/>accessible by bus or T)</p><p>Or perhaps a coffee house with a small meeting room?</p><p>I&apos;d hope to have audio &amp; video playback for recordings<br/>too, although I could bring such equip myself.</p><p>I expect my audience would be mostly Boston area<br/>microtonal musicians, and other interested musically<br/>educated types.</p><p>An evening or weekend time would suit me best,<br/>preferably sometime from mid-Sept. to Oct.</p><p>I plan to play some of the music I&apos;ll be presenting in El Paso this<br/>Nov.<br/>-------------<br/>By the way, I just received my Microzone from Starr Labs yesterday. I<br/>had some fun tooling around with it, but haven&apos;t really done anything<br/>serious on it yet. Any advice from current Microzone owners will be<br/>very welcome!<br/>------------<br/>Anyone who attends will be eligible to enroll in the<br/>Generalized Keyboard Artist Diploma program at the Fortuitous<br/>Conservatory of Music, where you can also attend lectures given<br/>through spiritual mediums by Profs. Bosanquet, Pythagoras,<br/>Aristoxenes, Colonna, Tartini, Boethius, Vicentino ;) If you seek<br/>advice from esteemed living theorists &amp; practioners, please subscribe<br/>to this list and use other sources at your disposal.</p><p>Demonstratably yours,<br/>Harold Fortuin<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/harold_fortuin">www.geocities.com/harold_fortuin</a></p></div>
