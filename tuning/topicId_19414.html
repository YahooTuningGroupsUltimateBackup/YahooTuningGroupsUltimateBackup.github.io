If you are a conventionally trained musician (or even self taught)<br/>performing or composing in the Western world it is most likely that your<br/>experience of tuning systems is limited to the 12 tone equal temperament<br/>(12 tet ), such as found on the conventionally tuned piano or the<br/>fretting of a guitar. You might have come across Asian and other musics<br/>which use different systems of tuning  - these will probably have struck<br/>you as exotic or unusual. In otherwords the largest part of your musical<br/>experience is one based on one sole tuning system.</p><p>For the best part of two centuries ( there is some debate on this ) 12<br/>tet has reigned supreme in Western &quot;classical&quot; and popular music and has<br/>indeed produced some beautiful music. A close look at modern music of<br/>all genres will reveal much innovation and originality. These<br/>developments are usually in the field of new technologies, perhaps<br/>original orchestrations and occasionally new timbres and mixes of sound.<br/>But virtually all in 12 tet. It is said more and more that we are<br/>continually recycling old resources and that it&apos;s all been done before.<br/>Not so with tuning systems.</p><p>Apart from the riches of &quot;non-Western&quot; musics there exists an almost<br/>infinite palette of creative colours in new tunings that have been and<br/>are currently under exploration by new &quot;classical&quot; composers, electronic<br/>musicians, jazz musicians and composers and performers of various &quot;neo&quot;<br/>musics, such as neo-Gothic and neo-Ethnic. The tuning field is probably<br/>the most fertile of all musical resources at the moment and represents a<br/>challenge for musicians of any ilk who have the courage to explore new<br/>territory. It can be a lifelong study involving pure mathematics,<br/>physics, computer programming and instrument design or with some<br/>imagination a little knowledge can go a long way. Either way, you learn<br/>something new and your music has new life in it.</p><p>I&apos;m off now to my underground fireproof bomb - shelter.</p><p>Peace to all.</p></div><h3><a id=19416 href="#19416">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2001 10:51:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alison!<br/>    This is the first mention of musics outside our own culture.
