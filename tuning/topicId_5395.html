Even if the unison vectors both are the smallest within the<br/>&gt; half-hexagonal &quot;boundary&quot;, the parallogram defined by those vectors may<br/>&gt; extend beyond the boundary, and may happen to include one or more smaller<br/>&gt; unison vectors. (Flipping the sign of one of the unison vectors will lead<br/>to<br/>&gt; a parallelogram that extends over a different part of the boundary, and<br/>&gt; again one or more unison vectors may lie in that region.)

If you can find any such shape in<br/>which all intervals are smaller than the unison vectors, then you would seem<br/>justified in claiming that a scale of d notes can arise as a naturally<br/>closed system in JI.

Perhaps limiting<br/>oneself to the parallelogram/parallelopiped is one way to make the search<br/>reasonable -- even in that case, you usually still have a few alternatives<br/>to consider (e.g., vertex on a lattice point, center on a lattice point,<br/>etc.). Or if you have an alternate suggestion for a consistent<br/>shape-formulation, I&apos;d love to hear it.</p><p>Also, I believe your work raises a few other interesting issues that are<br/>relevant to previous discussions on this list -- I hope you stick around!</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
