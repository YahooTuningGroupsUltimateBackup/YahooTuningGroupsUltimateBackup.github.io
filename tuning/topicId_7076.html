When he heard side by side piano performances<br/>&gt;of simple pieces in equal temperament and mean tone<br/>&gt;temperament he said that to his surprise he found that<br/>&gt;there was a big difference and that to him the mean<br/>&gt;tone version sounded better than did the equal tempered<br/>&gt;version.  After having heard the comparison, his reaction<br/>&gt;was that it seemed to him difficult to understand how<br/>&gt;equal temperament could have been universally adopted<br/>&gt;by the music world.</p><p>Good work Dave! We need to expose all music professors to this!</p></div>
