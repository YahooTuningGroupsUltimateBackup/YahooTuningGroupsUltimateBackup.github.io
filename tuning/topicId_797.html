Malcolm was walking through Harlem with a very well<br/>educated Phd, when a street hustler approached X, and began talking to<br/>him about his plans for the evening. It was all heavy duty black street<br/>slang, of course, and the Phd didn&apos;t understand a word of what the dude<br/>was saying...but, Malcolm did, and was quite amused at how a black<br/>&quot;leader&quot; couldn&apos;t even understand how to communicate with a segment of<br/>people from his own race.<br/>     Point is, what constitutes good communication? Malcolm knew exactly<br/>what the street guy was saying, and he could also communicate quite well<br/>with world leaders...to him, both forms of speaking were valid, and full<br/>of information. Same with musical styles...I know folks who think that<br/>&quot;classical&quot; music is &quot;superior&quot; to other forms, such as blues...but, I<br/>know they cannot PLAY blues...so, if they can&apos;t even do the thing, how<br/>can they say it&apos;s inferior? To me, that&apos;s a form of elitism, and<br/>henceforth, a dangerous form of thinking, for obvious reasons. Language,<br/>to me, is to communicate what a person is feeling...if you can do that<br/>with simple, powerful words/phrases (sucks), what&apos;s the problem? Or, to<br/>paraphrase a sort of goofy saying, what part of sucks don&apos;t you<br/>understand? Now, if you want a detailed explanation of WHY something<br/>sucks, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s unreasonable...in my case, I am always happy<br/>to provide a more thorough analysis of my critiques.<br/>    There&apos;s a tradition in black culture of &quot;doing the dozens,&quot; which is<br/>basically having an insult contest...check out the Bo Diddley tune &quot;Say,<br/>Man,&quot; where Bo and Jerome do just that on the record...I think that&apos;s<br/>probably where the term &quot;bad&quot; came from, to describe a great<br/>musician...the art of the insult is a real old thing between blues/jazz<br/>musicians, and often, the more you respect a player, the more you make<br/>it sound like he&apos;s awful...all in good fun, of course, and when it isn&apos;t<br/>in good fun, it ain&apos;t happening, and it ain&apos;t honorable.<br/>I would be happy to provide a list of some of my more descriptive<br/>phrases, concerning musical (or other) critiques, should anyone be<br/>interested...but, they&apos;re real similar to what a feller like Miles Davis<br/>would use...his autobiography, by the way, is real interesting...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=804 href="#804">ðŸ”—</a>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/1999 1:53:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>dear neil<br/>i think any  music when it becomes a form whetether it be<br/>Blues,classical,punk or otherwise,once categorized as a &quot;form&quot; loses all<br/>significance whatsoever.<br/>Neil Haverstick wrote:</p></div><h3><a id=811 href="#811">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph L Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/1999 11:31:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It&apos;s interesting that Haverstick used the story<br/>about language (from Malcolm X&apos;s book) to<br/>illustrate his point about musical elitism.</p><p>My research into medieval Frankish music<br/>theory intersects with a lot of my research<br/>into language, and I just recently came across<br/>a &quot;History of the French Language&quot; which<br/>specifically highlights this kind of elitism -<br/>and involves music, too.</p><p>The so-called Carolingian Renaissance began<br/>around 780 AD, because king Charlemagne<br/>was distressed at the state of the Latin,<br/>and at the state of the musical chants,<br/>being used in the church services.  The Franks<br/>were Germans who had millions of Latin-speaking<br/>people as their subjects, and it was only natural<br/>that this Germanic influence would &quot;corrupt&quot;<br/>both the musical and linguistic aspects of the<br/>Latin religious environment.</p><p>So, in the same way that Charlemagne sent<br/>envoys to Rome to bring  the &quot;true&quot; chant back<br/>to the royal court at Aachen, he brought the<br/>great English scholar Alcuin to reform the<br/>language.</p><p>The reason why the Latin in England remained<br/>uncorrupted is because the English spoke a<br/>Germanic language, whereas all the other users<br/>of Latin spoke Romance languages, that is,<br/>languages derived from Latin itself.  It was easy<br/>for Romance speakers to confuse the &quot;correct&quot;<br/>classical Latin &quot;rules&quot; with those of their own<br/>spoken vernacular, thus the written, literary<br/>Latin itself was changing.</p><p>Charlemagne put an abrupt stop to this by<br/>having educated people learn an artificial literary<br/>Latin that was more or less pretty close to the<br/>classical Latin of the Roman Empire, and which<br/>continued to be used for nearly 1000 years more.</p><p>This left the spoken Romance languages to<br/>develop on their own among the illiterate masses.<br/>This marks the beginning of modern French and,<br/>by extension to all others users of Latin in<br/>Christendom, of Provencal, Italian, Spanish,<br/>Catalan, Portuguese, and Rumanian, too.</p><p>Thus Charlemagne&apos;s &quot;elitism&quot; in Latin actually<br/>signalled the birth of several of the world&apos;s great<br/>modern languages.  No doubt, the &quot;elitism&quot; of the<br/>&quot;Gregorian&quot; chant he imposed had a similar effect<br/>on the development of the secular music of the<br/>time (written records of the music are more<br/>scanty and indecipherable than those of language,<br/>so it&apos;s tough to be sure what happened here).</p><p>It&apos;s been my experience that the main reason<br/>elitists consider certain kinds of music or<br/>language &quot;inferior&quot; is simply that they haven&apos;t<br/>studied these &quot;inferior&quot; types sufficiently, and<br/>haven&apos;t found a way to analyze them in a way<br/>that brings them an understanding of these<br/>&quot;inferior&quot; methods of communication.</p><p>Music is perhaps more slippery than language<br/>in this regard because it&apos;s harder to pin down<br/>concretely, but the processes of evolution in<br/>both music and language are remarkably similar.</p><p>This is probably because both are a means<br/>of communication that are based in *sound*,<br/>but that are continually embroiled in the process<br/>of being *written down*.  Apparently, there<br/>are differences between the aural and visual<br/>aspects of our mental processing that are<br/>difficult to reconcile.<br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3><a id=812 href="#812">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/1999 1:43:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph L Monzo wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s been my experience that the main reason<br/>&gt; elitists consider certain kinds of music or<br/>&gt; language &quot;inferior&quot; is simply that they haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; studied these &quot;inferior&quot; types sufficiently, and<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t found a way to analyze them in a way<br/>&gt; that brings them an understanding of these<br/>&gt; &quot;inferior&quot; methods of communication.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Music is perhaps more slippery than language<br/>&gt; in this regard because it&apos;s harder to pin down<br/>&gt; concretely, but the processes of evolution in<br/>&gt; both music and language are remarkably similar.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is probably because both are a means<br/>&gt; of communication that are based in *sound*,<br/>&gt; but that are continually embroiled in the process<br/>&gt; of being *written down*.

As we delve deeper into the musics on this planet we<br/>discover that where one culture will &quot;develop&quot; more along certain line<br/>other cultures will consider develop in other directions that is sometimes<br/>hard to understand as well as even perceive. Music is anything but a<br/>&quot;universal&quot; language.
