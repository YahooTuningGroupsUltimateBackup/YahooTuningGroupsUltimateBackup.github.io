I<br/>believe it is constructive.  Many great thinkers of<br/>the past believed in an order in nature which today<br/>seems naive.  Thus Johannes Kepler proposed that<br/>the distances of planets from the sun corresponded<br/>to the sizes of a set of symmetrical solids - icosahedron<br/>dodecahedron, cube, etc. which could be inscribed<br/>within each other, and then later dropped this idea.<br/>Isaac Newton spent much time trying to calculate<br/>the exact time to the creation of the world - down<br/>to the day and hour.  I believe that musical theorists<br/>also had the belief that there was an underlying<br/>&quot;perfect&quot; scheme of some kind laid down by the<br/>creator which, if they could only find it, lay at the<br/>root of musical art as well as everything else.  The<br/>writings of some theorists seem to be elaborate and<br/>detailed to a degree beyond which would seem today<br/>reasonably possible to expect.  In musical performance<br/>especially with non-fixed pitch instruments and voice,<br/>it seems unlikely that - with a few unusual exceptions -<br/>pitch accuracies closer than to a cent or a few cents<br/>could be achieved consistently in practical performances.<br/>However, some theoreticians seem to have carried out<br/>ideal calculations to limits of accuracy beyond this.</p><p>    I believe that most musicians from before the time<br/>when equal temperament began to be forcefully promoted<br/>in the 19th century uncritically assumed that there was<br/>some kind of underlying order of nature underlying musical<br/>pitch - note frequencies - which was based on numbers<br/>of the integer/small whole number kind.  Then, because<br/>approximations to these - mean tone temperament and later<br/>equal temperament yielded performances which sounded<br/>not completely different than would just performances, the<br/>belief in the need to hold absolutely strictly to small whole<br/>number ratios in music began to be shattered.</p><p>    A spokesman for the new view is the musical mathematician<br/>W. S. B. Woolhouse, who wrote in the 19th century: &quot;It is very<br/>misleading to suppose that the necessity of temperament applies<br/>only to instruments which have fixed tones.  Singers and performers<br/>on perfect instruments must all temper their intervals, or they<br/>could not keep in tune with each other, or even with themselves;<br/>an on arriving at the same notes by different routes, would be<br/>continually finding a want of agreement.  The scale of equal<br/>temperament obviates all such inconveniences, and continues to<br/>be universally accepted with unqualified satisfaction by the most<br/>eminent vocalists; and equally so by the most renowned and<br/>accomplished performers on stringed instruments, although these<br/>instruments are capable of an indefinite variety of intonation.<br/>The high development of modern instrumental music would not<br/>have been possible, and could not have been acquired, without<br/>the manifold advantages of tempered intonation by equal semitones,<br/>and it has, in consequence, long become the established basis of<br/>tuning.&quot;</p><p>    At present, although most of us see the belief in the absolute<br/>supremacy of integers as applied to music to be naive, it also<br/>seems, as Paul Erlich has said with regard to simultaneous notes,<br/>that integer ratios or very near integer ratios (closer than called<br/>for by 12-EQT) correspond to a psychological reality as regards<br/>our perception of music.</p><p>    I believe that Mr. Woolhouse, in stating that equal temperament<br/>is rightly the long established basis of tuning, really went too far<br/>and overlooked the fact of experience that the deviations of equal<br/>temperament from the just ratios are so large that they really<br/>do have an appreciable effect on the sound of music performed in<br/>equal temperament.</p><p>    Some of Mr. Woolhouse&apos;s contemporaries strongly disagreed<br/>with him, too.</p><p>    This thought may be incomplete, but I hope it is a constructive<br/>contribution.</p><p>    Dave Hill,  La Mesa,  CA</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/1999 4:59:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:Ascend11@aol.com">Ascend11@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;    At present, although most of us see the belief in the absolute<br/>&gt; supremacy of integers as applied to music to be naive, it also<br/>&gt; seems, as Paul Erlich has said with regard to simultaneous notes,<br/>&gt; that integer ratios or very near integer ratios (closer than called<br/>&gt; for by 12-EQT) correspond to a psychological reality as regards<br/>&gt; our perception of music.</p><p>I am not quite sure what you mean in the 1st phrase here.

Furthermore, far from overlooking the<br/>errors from &gt;just intonation, Woolhouse sought the best way to reduce them<br/>while &gt;preserving the musical meaning of the notes in the Western tradition.</p><p>This would unquestionably involve meantone.  But there are two points I&apos;d<br/>like to make here:</p><p>[1.]  Free-pitched performances in the western tradition do certainly _not_<br/>perform in temperament, if temperament is a _consistent_ detuning of just<br/>ratios for the purpose of reducing the size of a pitch set.  In the case of<br/>brass quintets and Barbershop quartets, and other a capella groups,<br/>surprisingly good adaptive JI is achieved by the most renowned performers,<br/>and the emphasis is on vertical sonorities over melodic coherence<br/>(JI-related melodic artifacts can be heard in some of the best performances).</p><p>Even in the case of bare melody temperament is not used (or melody with a<br/>relatively quiet and rhythmically un-related accompaniment).  I challenge<br/>anyone to find a performance with melodic fifths consistently tuned 6 cents<br/>flat.  As with vertical sonorities, JI must be applied locally to melody to<br/>make sense (some theorists never seem to tire of pointing out that global<br/>&quot;fixed&quot; JI doesn&apos;t make sense harmonically).  The intervals between melodic<br/>notes tend towards ratios of small whole numbers for the same reason that<br/>harmonic intervals do -- the hearing system likes to fit things into a<br/>harmonic series.  The accuracy is far less than with harmonic intervals, at<br/>least because the roughness mechanism is not involved (so melodies produced<br/>on a tempered instrument will sound okay).</p><p>On the global scale, there is a desire to simplify the Rothenberg<br/>difference matrix.  Pythagorean chains, MOS, constant structures, and<br/>tetrachordality all simplify the difference matrix.  I reject the idea that<br/>only ratios of 3 are important in melodic tuning.  Often, the desire to<br/>simplify the DM makes the global scale definable in terms of a single just<br/>interval, and this interval has historically been the 3/2, because 3/2 is<br/>such a strong consonance.  But chains of any strong consonance could work,<br/>and even in 3-based scales, the approximation is only a global one.<br/>Performers often bend notes locally so that melodic (as well as harmonic)<br/>intervals can be closer to 5/4, 7/4, etc, and in isolated runs one can even<br/>hear stuff like :10, :11, :12.</p><p>[2.]  As concerns new music, the &quot;problems&quot; of JI would naturally be used<br/>to advantage by the composer.  Music exists, still very much in the western<br/>tradition, which demonstrates this.</p><p>[Kraig Grady wrote...]<br/>&gt;I am not quite sure what you mean in the 1st phrase here.

And what are the driving forces behind custom,<br/>then?  I&apos;d call +/-10 cents a fair estimate of the accuracy of singing the<br/>&quot;base-two under&quot; 7-limit melodic intervals, which is closer than 19-tone<br/>equal temperament.</p><p>Far greater accuracy is possible when a drone is present.  Granted, these<br/>would be &quot;harmonic&quot; intervals by our current convention, but... clearly a<br/>melody over a drone is still a melody in some important ways (otherwise we<br/>would not find approximations to the linear series in Indian and Persian<br/>melodies).</p><p>[Reference Bobby McFerrin&apos;s &quot;The Voice&quot;]</p><p>&gt;Furthermore, if your first sentence above is true, why are minor arpeggios<br/>&gt;at least as common as major arpeggios in non-harmonized music from around<br/>&gt;the world (at least what I&apos;ve heard)?</p><p>You&apos;re assuming they approximate a utonal structure?
