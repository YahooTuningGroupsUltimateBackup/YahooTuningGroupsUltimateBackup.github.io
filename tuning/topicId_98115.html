How is it consistent?</p><p>&gt; If you want to compare chords and timbres you should compute<br/>&gt; the spectra of the chords assuming some timbre. That has the<br/>&gt; obvious drawback of having to pick a timbre -- a choice that&apos;s<br/>&gt; averaged away in the &quot;chord&quot; abstraction.</p><p>OK, let&apos;s assume sawtooth waves, to make the math easy. I&apos;ll crunch<br/>some numbers when I get back.</p><p>&gt; The other drawback is that processing may be hierarchical to some degree,<br/>&gt; especially if the individual tones are separated by spatial or<br/>&gt; timing cues (also averaged away in the &quot;chord&quot; abstraction).<br/>&gt; However it might still be interesting. Comparing the spectra<br/>&gt; of chord fundamentals (i.e. picking sine tones for the timbre)<br/>&gt; is what I thought you were doing when I first replied here.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s something, but it&apos;s not a typical musical situation.</p><p>No, but like I said in my last message, if each note has harmonics<br/>then the situation gets even worse. A 4:5:6:7:..:18:19 chord played<br/>with sawtooth waves, where all of the notes are at equal volume, will<br/>have an even harsher spectrum than if it were played with sines. Upper<br/>notes will end up even louder because there will be additive effects<br/>with the harmonics of lower notes. So, spectrally, the rolloff will be<br/>negative.</p><p>This may be counterbalanced by the fact that we&apos;re not actually<br/>talking about a 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:...:infinity &quot;chord,&quot; with all<br/>harmonics going on forever, but a finite subset of these (like<br/>harmonics 4:...:19), which is sort of like the last thing sent through<br/>a bandpass filter. If you aren&apos;t sure that this will really lead to a<br/>harsher sound, we could load some tests up and see, but I&apos;m in Orlando<br/>now...</p><p>&gt; &gt; sources in real life exhibit phase irregularities, differences<br/>&gt; &gt; in inter-aural spatialization cues, F0 estimation will be<br/>&gt; &gt; taking place regardless. If it wasn&apos;t, then there&apos;d be no<br/>&gt; &gt; point in us talking meaningfully about &quot;4:5:6&quot; to begin with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I only brought up phase because it doesn&apos;t seem to matter much<br/>&gt; in practice (though it doesn&apos;t seem to be entirely inaudible<br/>&gt; either) yet it matters a lot to waveform. So referring to<br/>&gt; timbres by waveform may not be a good idea.</p><p>I meant in the generalized sense of a parabolic wave having 1/N^2<br/>rolloff and all harmonics present. We already know exactly when phase<br/>matters and when it doesn&apos;t - take the Fourier transform of a signal,<br/>and then from that plot its &quot;phase response.&quot; If the phase response is<br/>a line, it&apos;ll sound no different. If it&apos;s not a line, it will. I<br/>posted some listening examples of my voice sent through different<br/>phase responses a while back to show.</p><p>For sustained timbres, you can&apos;t get any more out there than being in<br/>a reverberant hall, which adds randomly delayed and filtered copies of<br/>the signal to the original. Each one of those interacts with the<br/>original signal and changes the phase of random parts, so reverb is<br/>equivalent to just taking the original signal and @*#&amp;ing up the phase<br/>of each component. Still doesn&apos;t interfere with F0 estimation,<br/>although as we saw it definitely interferes with &quot;periodicity buzz&quot;<br/>(which now needs a new name).</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98150 href="#98150">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/17/2011 12:41:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; As a rule,<br/>&gt; &gt; adding notes to any rooted chord should not decrease its<br/>&gt; &gt; discordance.

This means<br/>it&apos;s about ~26 Hz in either direction. 7/6, if played at middle C with<br/>sines, will yield Eb at 7/6 * 261 = ~305 Hz. Will this get caught in<br/>the critical band at C?</p><p>305 - 261 = 44 Hz</p><p>It would need to be &lt; 26 Hz to cause beating over there, so no, it<br/>won&apos;t. Will it get caught in the critical band at Eb? Well, the<br/>critical bandwidth at Eb is 24.7*(4.37*.305+ 1) = 58 Hz, so that<br/>equates to ~29 Hz in either direction. So no, it won&apos;t get caught<br/>there either. But what about the mean of 305 and 261 Hz, which is 283<br/>Hz? The critical bandwidth there is 55 Hz, so ~27 Hz in either<br/>direction. Let&apos;s find out:</p><p>283 + 27 = 310 Hz - check<br/>283 - 27 = 256 Hz - check</p><p>So while there will be no actual AM at the peak resonance for 310 or<br/>256 Hz on the cochlea, there will be AM occurring on the cochlea<br/>between them. When you have a chord like 4:5:6, the 4:5 and the 5:6<br/>will be beating in unison with one another, and this creates the<br/>characteristic sound of &quot;periodicity buzz.&quot; When you have 7:8:10, the<br/>8:10 is beating twice as fast as the 7:8, and you have periodicity<br/>buzz in which the beating is in a 2:1 ratio, which still cool.<br/>16:18:21 will give you buzz that is in a 3:2 polyrhythm, and that&apos;s<br/>not as nice.</p><p>When you have 5 evenly spaced notes (in Hz) with an outer dyad of phi,<br/>you will still get periodicity buzz, because they&apos;ll all be beating at<br/>the same rate. Listening examples exist for all of this and plenty<br/>more.</p><p>The whole thing is very sensitive to phase, and I posted gammatone<br/>filterbank plots that explored how the phase response changes all of<br/>this. They generally predicted the behavior of the listening examples<br/>well.</p><p>This may be a good place to start:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/95699">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/95699</a></p><p>&gt; - Nobody else gave a darn.</p><p>Haha...

So there&apos;s only<br/>a small amount of interaction, but it&apos;s there. Now, gammatone models<br/>have two drawbacks, both of which need to be addressed</p><p>1) Gammatone filters are linear, which leads to two separate issues:<br/>1a) Most importantly, this means that they don&apos;t take into account the<br/>varying response of the auditory filter with respect to volume. At low<br/>volumes, the frequency response of the filter narrows, which would<br/>lead to less overlap. However, at low volumes, the cochlea tends to<br/>amplify what you do have, which counteracts the effects of the above.<br/>1b) It also means that gammatone filters don&apos;t model combination<br/>tones, which would reinforce even beating only at periodic ratios.<br/>However, in my experiments and listening tests, one of which you&apos;ll<br/>find below again in this thread, I still noted that linearly even<br/>triads buzz more clearly than periodic triads that are not linearly<br/>even.</p><p>and 2) The actual auditory filter is asymmetrical. This doesn&apos;t have<br/>much bearing on anything, though, as if you ran the filterbank with<br/>asymmetrical filters instead of gammatone filters, the interaction<br/>area would just be moved up a bit - the apex of interaction just<br/>wouldn&apos;t be at the mean of the two frequencies.</p><p>&gt; I looked at this before. They are talking about roughness,<br/>&gt; not periodicity buzz! Is there some particular section of<br/>&gt; this paper that you think is related?</p><p>See</p><p>&quot;Experimental studies seeking to quantify roughness perception have<br/>often studied the effects of the frequency composition of stimuli<br/>Plomp and Levelt, 1965; Plomp and Steeneken, 1968; Kameoka and<br/>Kuriyagawa, 1969. The presence of frequency components within the<br/>limits of a critical band is considered, in these studies, to be the<br/>source of the beats that produce the percept of roughness.<br/>Consequently, models of roughness perception have been proposed that<br/>are based on the spectral composition of energy falling within<br/>critical bands Hutchinson and Knopoff, 1978. A different approach to<br/>roughness is to study the influence of temporal parameters by means of<br/>amplitude-modulated stimuli Mathes and Miller, 1947; Terhardt, 1974;<br/>Fastl, 1977. A dependence of roughness on the frequency and depth of<br/>the modulation was demonstrated. The interpretation proposed is that<br/>roughness is determined by the envelope fluctuations of the signal<br/>within an auditory filter. These results have inspired another kind of<br/>model in which roughness estimates are based on the rms value of the<br/>signal envelope after auditory filtering and after a<br/>modulation-frequency bandpass filter Aures, 1985; Daniel and Weber,<br/>1997.&quot;</p><p>They then proceed to do exactly the same tests with phase as I do, but<br/>we&apos;re not there yet in this discussion.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Complex-tone chords, if the timbre is perfectly periodic, will<br/>&gt; &gt; only exhibit perfectly even &quot;buzz&quot; if you&apos;re playing a JI or RI<br/>&gt; &gt; chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then why do tempered chords buzz almost indistinguishably<br/>&gt; from JI chords?

But for posterity&apos;s sake, the Fourier<br/>Transform is an algorithm that transforms a signal into a<br/>representation where it is the sum of sinusoids. For some physical<br/>system&apos;s motion, it will come up with a series of sine waves that,<br/>when added back together, magically reconstructs the original signal.<br/>Just because in real life, sawtooth waves can&apos;t actually jump from -1<br/>to 1 infinitely quickly, doesn&apos;t mean that the amplitude of the<br/>harmonics just tapers off to zero. It means that your speaker cone<br/>exhibits some mechanical compliance - if it were infinitely stiff, it<br/>would be able to jump from -1 to 1 infinitely quickly, but it&apos;s not.<br/>Compliance is analogous to capacitance</p><p><a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/LPSA/Analogs/ElectricalMechanicalAnalogs.html">http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/LPSA/Analogs/ElectricalMechanicalAnalogs.html</a></p><p>So you&apos;re just low pass filtering the signal. But, even if you sent<br/>10000000 Hz through your speaker, assuming no other filtering<br/>components exist in the system (another impossibility) the cone will<br/>move a little, tiny fraction of a bit, literally until you get into<br/>things like quantum mechanics. The cone does not have infinite<br/>stiffness, but it doesn&apos;t have infinite compliance either, which would<br/>require infinite flexibility, as you already agree is impossible. So<br/>the harmonics will never decay to zero entirely, they&apos;ll just be<br/>attenuated a bit.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You WANT a finite-response filter in this case - a<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;brickwall&quot; filter - but they don&apos;t exist,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course they exist - sampling itself is an example. It<br/>&gt; makes a bad filter because of the aliasing. But I didn&apos;t say<br/>&gt; filter, I said physical system.</p><p>Sampling is not a filter in the sense that the word filter is<br/>generally used, and the frequency response of a sampled signal is<br/>going to be infinite in extent. In fact, if it wasn&apos;t infinite in<br/>extent before sampling, it will definitely be infinite in extent after<br/>sampling. When you sample, you are taking the frequency spectrum and<br/>convolving it with an impulse train that spikes at the sampling<br/>frequency and all of its harmonics. If the bandwidth of your signal is<br/>greater than half the sampling frequency, the negative frequencies<br/>will tile over into the baseband and you get aliasing. Sampling causes<br/>periodicity in the spectrum (not periodicity in the waveform, but in<br/>the spectrum) at the sampling frequency. When you reconstruct the<br/>signal, if you want to attenuate everything but the baseband, you need<br/>to filter. To actually get rid of everything but the baseband would<br/>require a brickwall filter, which I just said doesn&apos;t exist, although<br/>you can get arbitrarily close to it. So what they do instead is hold<br/>each sample until the beginning of the next one &quot;sample and hold,&quot;<br/>which dampens the sidebands, but doesn&apos;t attenuate them infinitely.<br/>This is tangential, but you should know this anyway, as I predict<br/>variations of this point will keep coming up again and again in this<br/>discussion.</p><p>How this relates to auditory filtering: I am using the word filter to<br/>describe a system that alters the frequency response of the input,<br/>usually by taking things away and boosting other things. This is<br/>consistent with how the term is used here</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_%28signal_processing%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_%28signal_processing%29</a></p><p>In this extent, the hair cells in the ear are filters, because they<br/>attenuate certain frequencies and pass others. They are mechanical and<br/>acoustical filters. A mechanical-electrical duality exists, as per the<br/>link in the last paragraph - so yes, the hair cells in the ear are<br/>filters, which is why they are called &quot;auditory filters.&quot; And no, they<br/>will not produce infinite attenuation anywhere.

But this is kind of a silly debate, as<br/>the discrete array of samples doesn&apos;t mean anything until you put it<br/>back in the time domain. If you actually want to use sinc<br/>interpolation, you cut everything above Nyquist. If your preferred<br/>view on it is that you want to think of the array of samples as<br/>already being sinc interpolated by default in the continuous time<br/>domain, fine, but that&apos;s not how I learned it and I think it makes the<br/>math more confusing.</p><p>In general it&apos;s more intuitive to think of it as sampling in one<br/>domain = periodicity in the other domain, with sampled time domain<br/>signals and Fourier series for periodic waveforms being the canonical<br/>examples of this. Then, sinc filtering to cut everything above nyquist<br/>is only one way to treat the sampled signal. I think it&apos;s a more<br/>intuitive paradigm. But now we&apos;re really far out there, because my<br/>original point was that when you reconstruct the signal, in real-life,<br/>you can&apos;t brickwall filter it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The increase in speed is something I have examples of<br/>&gt; &gt; somewhere in that thread. Generally, it decreases in volume.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My hunch is that the decrease in volume you would predict is<br/>&gt; much greater than observed.<br/>//snip<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not clear to me if you think the buzz is entirely due<br/>&gt; to AM within filters. If it is, the intensity of the buzz<br/>&gt; should drop off very rapidly with interval width.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t be surprised, but I haven&apos;t not taking into account any<br/>kind of cochlear amplification effects, etc. The resulting AM waveform<br/>located between the locations on the cochlea will exhibit constructive<br/>and destructive interference. I had worked it out at one point that<br/>the constructive side of this should always be above the masking curve<br/>by definition, and the destructive side always below it. So it should<br/>always be audible in theory, but at what point you stop hearing it at<br/>all is something I haven&apos;t tested.</p><p>I think that<br/>1) The concept of a phase-dependent buzz that occurs with linear<br/>spacing can be shown to be a general facet of the behavior of<br/>filterbanks that cover the entire spectrum without any gaps<br/>2) Different filterbanks will predict how the buzz tapers off with<br/>respect to volume in different ways; e.g. gammatone filters will<br/>predict different specific behavior than ERBs, but all should predict<br/>the same general big picture that buzz occurs at a point intermediate<br/>to the two frequencies in the filterbank, increases in speed as the<br/>frequencies get farther apart, and decrease in volume<br/>3) The cochlea is the obvious filterbank in the auditory system to<br/>attribute this behavior to<br/>4) Gammatone filter modeling, which isn&apos;t 100% accurate but has most<br/>of the vital features of the actual auditory filter, predicts very<br/>well when and where buzz will occur<br/>5) Its predictions aren&apos;t 100% accurate with respect to little details<br/>like the exact amplitude curve of buzz with respect to distance, but<br/>in the larger picture its predictions are good enough for government<br/>work, and where they break down can usually be explained by imagining<br/>the plots with asymmetrical filters and nonlinear effects<br/>6) The work done so far supports the hypothesis that the cochlea is<br/>the origin, and I have yet to see a better model suggested that data<br/>supports over this one</p><p>That is where I&apos;m at. I&apos;m not making predictions about the exact buzz<br/>difference frequency-amplitude curve, because I have no way to make<br/>such predictions and I don&apos;t see how they&apos;re relevant to the bigger<br/>picture. We don&apos;t know all of the details of the cochlear<br/>nonlinearities, and I have no way of modeling how exactly cochlear<br/>amplification at low volume works.</p><p>I&apos;ve seen a lot about this &quot;double critical band&quot; theory in the<br/>psychoacoustics literature, which suggests a second set of filters in<br/>the auditory midbrain (I think). If this is true, then that could be<br/>another source of buzz. For now, since I haven&apos;t seen any evidence of<br/>that, the simplest suggestion is that the cochlea is where it&apos;s at.<br/>Furthermore, the entire wealth of literature we have on the subject<br/>assumes that there&apos;s only one filterbank and does roughness<br/>experiments to determine its properties, and all of that would have to<br/>completely change if a second spectral filtering mechanism were<br/>involved. So I see no reason to buy into anything like that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Petr wrote a good post about it here<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/95728">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/95728</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He mentions an offlist discussion you had with him back during<br/>&gt; Rick&apos;s GCD thread.

The sinusoids that the Fourier transform bases itself off<br/>of are abstract idealizations that do not exist in nature - literally<br/>they are sine waves that stretch from -infinity to infinity with no<br/>change. They are not real. And if you want to think about frequencies<br/>changing over time, then you&apos;re getting away from the Fourier<br/>transform.</p><p>There is a point that I&apos;m trying to make as well, and it&apos;s come up<br/>before as well: is that these frequencies are not actual, real<br/>entities that need to be limited by physical processes. They are<br/>abstract ideas. The Fourier transform is a mathematical algorithm that<br/>generates an infinite summation of these abstract ideas that magically<br/>add back together to yield the original signal. It&apos;s like a Taylor<br/>series or something. That&apos;s all it is, no more and no less.</p><p>In reality, a system can in real life exhibit motion. If you take the<br/>Fourier transform of this motion, you&apos;ll generally end up with an<br/>infinite series that, when you add all the terms back together,<br/>magically adds up to generate the original motion again. The terms of<br/>this series will generally taper off in weighting as the frequency<br/>tends towards infinity, but never quite reach zero (except &quot;at&quot;<br/>infinity). This applies to real-life systems as well.

The reason aliasing occurs is that you are<br/>taking your sample&apos;s frequency response, reflecting it about the<br/>y-axis (to handle negative frequencies), shifting it over so it&apos;s now<br/>centered around the sampling frequency instead of 0 Hz, and adding it<br/>to the original. All of the negative frequencies that exceed Nyquist<br/>then end up looping back into the baseband. Repeat this process<br/>forever with the sampling frequency&apos;s harmonics. The National<br/>Semiconductor paper I linked you to had a good visual diagram of this.</p><p>&gt; Probably the easiest way to characterize the frequency<br/>&gt; response of the sampling process is to look at the DFT<br/>&gt; of the samples -- you get frequency domain coefficients<br/>&gt; up to Nyquist.</p><p>You mean that you get frequency domain coefficients up to the sampling<br/>frequency, but that the second half of the resulting array will be the<br/>same as the negative frequencies up to negative Nyquist. The second<br/>half of the array will also be a phase-inverted version of the first<br/>half of the array. This will not be the case for complex (ie. real +<br/>imaginary) signals. This is not up for debate :)</p><p>&gt; &gt; The obvious explanation for behavior like this is that we<br/>&gt; &gt; have completely ignore combination tones,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been cautious of them the whole time, but of course<br/>&gt; they can never be completely eliminated.</p><p>We can do some tests at low volume to see how this all changes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Can you give an example?
