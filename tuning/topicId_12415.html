The truncated<br/>reworking of the &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; melody that the trumpet takes<br/>at the opening of &quot;At a Day Job&quot; uses a descending 10:13 in the role<br/>of the expected minor 3rd (and a 5:7 in place of the expected 4th that<br/>follows). My question to anyone who might care to listen and weigh in<br/>a view is what does this stubborn and sometimes disorienting 10:13<br/>interval sound most like in this context... some flavor of a major<br/>3rd... some flavor of a 4th... an out of tune 3rd or an out of tune<br/>4th... none of the above...

The context IS everything - and this really<br/>shows it to be true, because - for contrast, if you play an arpeggio<br/>on a piano sound alone, of 1/1, 13/10 and 3/2 - just a first position<br/>triad, well this really wants to behave like a major triad. Nothing<br/>profound in this statement; it just underscores the wonderful<br/>harmonic paradoxes provided by the Neutral ratios.</p><p>I love using intervals that creat this kind of ambiguity, as a<br/>deliberate compositional choice. And I think that the context of<br/>their use really does affect the quality of perception, either<br/>nakedly or in a veiled sort of way. To me this is a more &quot;veiled&quot;,<br/>approach, in that it uses a familiar piece, and the part under<br/>analysis is a melody that you expect to do certain things. That is<br/>the delightful part of what you&apos;ve done here!!! Great thanks to you<br/>for sharing this perspective.</p><p>To any on this list who may not have found their way to Dan Stearns<br/>music on <a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a> - you don&apos;t know what you are missing!!! There&apos;s<br/>allot of great music there, and Dan has got some great compostional,<br/>studio and guitar chops too. Check it out - you won&apos;t regret it!!</p><p>Good Day,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; A while back Jacky Ligon wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If I map a 13/10 to &quot;F&quot;, which I must do if I want to tune it to<br/>454<br/>&gt; cents - well I certainly don&apos;t hear this interval as a 4/3 - I hear<br/>it<br/>&gt; as a very wide major 3rd.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The truncated<br/>&gt; reworking of the &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; melody that the trumpet<br/>takes<br/>&gt; at the opening of &quot;At a Day Job&quot; uses a descending 10:13 in the role<br/>&gt; of the expected minor 3rd (and a 5:7 in place of the expected 4th<br/>that<br/>&gt; follows).
