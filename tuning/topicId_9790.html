Erlich has been as kind as he has been generous in  helping me<br/>through a number of important tuning concepts.  It seems that our<br/>discussion (actually, more his pedagogy of me) has reached a level where<br/>some reader&apos;s of this list might find it helpful as well.   With that, I&apos;m<br/>including our last post:</p><p>On 24 Apr 00, at 15:00, Paul H. Erlich wrote:</p><p>[Me:]<br/>&gt; &gt;When someone is singing a tune by himself, how does he proceed?  Is it<br/>&gt; &gt;not by incrementing off of the previous note?  So, if I&apos;m singing a &apos;C&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt;at, say, 256 Hz, then I would increment this frequency by 1+1/9, at<br/>&gt; &gt;arrive at my &apos;D&apos; of 288 Hz (to the best of my ability).   Others, when<br/>&gt; &gt;singing a tune to the Ptolemaic syntonon diatonic, we&apos;ll increment up;<br/>&gt; &gt;1+1/10; and if singing to the Zalzal&apos;s intonation, we&apos;ll go up 1+1/11.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Clearly someone can sing a tune without harmony.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, but most of the world&apos;s melodic tunings do not conform to your logic<br/>&gt; above.</p><p>It would seem that someone can arrive at a tuning mathematically, divide a<br/>monochord accordingly, and then sing to it.  And someone may be able to<br/>learn the tuning by heart.</p><p>But singing unaccompanied presents an entirely different challenge the<br/>vocalist.  After intoning the fundamental (tonic) note, 1/1, (which in most<br/>cultures, and in most people, will be a relative note, not an absolute Hz<br/>frequency), he then must proceed by gauging his movement against the<br/>fundamental.  So, if he wants to sing a song to Al Sibn (sp?) tuning, (1/1,<br/>9/8, 27/22, 4/3).  While theoretically, he would proceed by 1/1, 1+1/8,<br/>1+1/11, 1+7/81; this is not within the realm of unaccompanied human<br/>performance.  Rather, he may very well proceed by 1/1, 1+1/8, 1+1/11,<br/>1+1/12  (i.e., 1/1, 9/8, 12/11, 13/12) for either 493c to the tetrachord.</p><p>As I mentioned, actually tuning recordings of chanters shows variances well<br/>above 7+/- cents, even by the same performer and another time.  So, again,<br/>it seems that their are a number of &quot;virtual tetrachords&quot;, i.e.,<br/>tetrachords that aurally are complete, but mathematically are not.</p><p>It still seems to me that this notion is related to the concept of &quot;unison<br/>vectors.&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt;Thank you much.   Would you find the following a plausible hypothesis.<br/>&gt; &gt;Someone may sing the sequence 1/1, 9/8, 99/80 monophonically; but with<br/>&gt; &gt;the accompaniment of a drone, would sing 1/1, 9/8, 11/9; his attempt to<br/>&gt; &gt;increment 9/8 by 1+1/10 being attracted into the harmonic 11/9?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Very plausible. I see no need to reference 99/80 or 1+1/10, though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Hmm.  This then supports the hypothesis I just stated above, i.e., in<br/>&gt; &gt;trying to navigate an interval smaller than the minor tone 10/9 (yielding<br/>&gt; &gt;a 3rd of 5/4 = 386c) yet larger than the semi-tone 16/15 (yielding a 3rd of<br/>&gt; &gt; 6/5 = 316),  his only harmonic harbor would be found at 11/7 (=347c).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mean 11/9. Yes, that would be the only harmonic harbor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Hmm, again.  So, it appears that 21:17 (=366c) might also be a harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt;point for our now throughly struggling chanter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For a slightly superhuman ear, yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Paul, I greatly appreciate your helping me along in this discussion.  Do<br/>&gt; &gt;you think that this post would be of some interest to the Tuning list, or<br/>&gt; &gt; is too elementary?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not too elementary -- in fact, nothing could be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;PS.  Just thinking.  The Ptolemaic Diatonic Hemilion yields thirds of<br/>&gt; &gt;6/5, 11/9, 27/22, 5/4, and 40/33.  Then, it would seem, that the 11/9 and<br/>&gt; &gt;and 27/22 would wind up, in unaccompanied vocals, as 11/9.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Only if there were a drone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Not sure what would<br/>&gt; &gt;happen to the 40/33, perhaps taken as 6/5?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; According to my harmonic entropy model, a _harmonic_ interval of 40:33<br/>&gt; would be heard as 17:14 by an oustanding ear, and 6:5 by an average to<br/>&gt; very good ear.</p><p>The harmonic entropy model sounds very interesting.  I&apos;ll try to follow-up<br/>later.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Polychroni</p></div><h3><a id=9794 href="#9794">ðŸ”—</a>Jason_Yust &#x3C;jason_yust@brown.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2000 1:49:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&#x9;the question of tuning in unaccompanied melody has been a topic of<br/>discussion the past few days and I&apos;m wondering to what degree people on the<br/>list feel that rational intervals matter in contexts where no harmony is<br/>present.  On the cello and other bowed strings, notes played at least mf<br/>audibly reverberate in the resonating bodies of the instrument for a<br/>considerable while, and so in Bach&apos;s solo suites, where the melodies tend<br/>to be more compound than staightforwardly stepwise, and the motion rapid, I<br/>could see rational harmony potentially playing a role.  In unaccompanied<br/>singing without a drone, is the difference even between 9/8 and 10/9 going<br/>to effect the experience of the music?  According to A H Benade, the<br/>unaccompanied singer tunes his/her pitches on the basis of reverberations<br/>of previous pitches, and in, say, an anechoic chamber or outdoors, would<br/>have no basis for a precise tuning this way or that.  According to La Monte<br/>Young reverberations in the form of firing neurons (correct me if I&apos;m<br/>wrong) continue in the nervous system after a pitch is heard and account<br/>for pitch memory.  Could we possibly percieve tuning in remembered pitches?<br/> How can tuning happen linearly?
