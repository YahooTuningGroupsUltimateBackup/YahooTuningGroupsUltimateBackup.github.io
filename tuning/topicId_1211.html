Takes years to learn your way around some of them.  But<br/>&gt;preliminary playing gives me the feeling that &quot;Fokker&apos;s 7-limit<br/>periodicity &gt;block of 2048/2025 &amp; 3969/4000 &amp; 225/224&quot; functions quite<br/>differently than &gt;either my scale or its Keenan-tempered version.</p><p>The fokker scale I mention here is &quot;fokker_12a.scl&quot; in the archive.  The<br/>one Dave Keenan was talking about is &quot;fokker_12.scl&quot;.  For some reason I<br/>missed the other 12-tone fokker scales when I went thru the archive the<br/>other month -- thought there was only one of them, so I didn&apos;t bother to<br/>look at Dave&apos;s diagram.  My mistake.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
