This I experienced as sort of big bang. The harpsichord, an<br/>instrument that had always been fascinating me, but left me in an inexplicable<br/>way somewhat dissatisfied. But this irritation, these doubts vanished<br/>instantaneously when listening to Gustav Leonhardt&apos;s interpretations of the<br/>English Virginalists in mean tone.</p><p>In my enthusiasm I immediately learned harpsichord tuning in &apos;65/66<br/>and started playing a lot of music out of Fitzwilliam&apos;s Virginal book.<br/>Also, by intuition, and predilection, on the harpsichord from 1968<br/>onwards, the Four Duets of Clavier&iuml;&iquest;&half;bung III - as an incorrigible<br/>mathematician. From 1965 to 1975 I was thinking a lot about organology:<br/>harpsichord building; I assembled a guitar( yes, sort of harpsichord<br/>without keyboard!) and three harpsichords, one Flemish and two Italians.<br/>Finally, in December 1975, after 10 years devoted to thinking about<br/>that question, I could specify and I defined &quot;wohltemperirt/Bach&quot;. I<br/>wrote my instructions towards harpsichord tuning, taking advantage -<br/>though as a physicist - of my good, and above all, my bad experiences<br/>in that field.<br/>Knowing Gustav Leonhardt, I can hardly believe that he ever performed<br/>for an audience of our century in &quot;Das wohltenperirte Clavier I&quot;<br/>throughout, in public performance. In our present times there exist<br/>valid arguments from refraining doing so. However, I had been<br/>literally living, thriving, through some years from<br/>Gustav Leonhardt&apos;s recording of &quot;Das wohltemperirte Clavier II&quot;.</p><p>What Gustav Leonhardt was aiming at in his unsurpassed recordings -<br/>as I feel and believe, is the most appropriate and satisfactory<br/>sounding at and for our times of &quot;Das wohltemperirte Clavier&quot;;<br/>retuning for the different pieces whereever this serves his purpose<br/>and musical ideals. And he always brilliantly succeeded.<br/>Hearing his interpretation, I see no point in insisting dogmatically on any<br/>specific musical temperament for his playing of Das wohltemperirte Clavier.</p><p>Also, in Paris I had the chance to listen to Andras Schiff playing the<br/>entire WTC II throughout, in a mammuth-recital with two breaks. This<br/>as well I found excellent and passionating - to my taste and appeciation of<br/>Das wohltemperirte Clavier. Although a small percentage of the public turned<br/>homewards or into a restaurant at the second pause!! Just think of<br/>Friedrich Gulda&apos;s delicious piano-recording of WTC I and II! By the way,<br/>with Gulda&apos;s interpretation of the complete resording of Beethoven&apos;s<br/>sonatas I compare, measure and judge everything else.</p><p>Amongst my numerous musicological publications, I had promised and<br/>dedicted to Gustav Leonhardt my article:<br/>Kellner, H.A.: How Bach quantified his well-tempered tuning within the<br/>Four Duets. English Harpsichord Magazine, Vol. 4, No. 2, 1986(87),<br/>page 21-27.</p><p>In view of these pieces for organ/harpsichord, resistant to any explanation<br/>and analysis throughout centuries, the resolution of that enigma I owe as<br/>well - albeit indirectly, to Gustav Leonhardt.</p><p>To conclude, this appears as an appropriate occasion to express my<br/>warmest and cordial thanks to our great teacher and master; whose<br/>concerts, recitals on harpsichord organ and clavichord, as well as<br/>his direction and conducting Bach&apos;s great works, have given<br/>me an enormous musical and spiritual satisfaction and pleasure throughout<br/>our years in Paris - and evereywhere else.</p><p>Herbert Anton Kellner</p></div>
