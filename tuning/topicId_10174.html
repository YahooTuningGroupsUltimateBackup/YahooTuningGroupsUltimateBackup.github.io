Plot<br/>all the ratios up to a specified integer limit (say, 20) on a number line<br/>and see this for yourself. So in a sense the simpler ratios occupy more of<br/>the space on the number line. Hopefully this addresses your confusion<br/>regarding those three paragraphs, and others by Monz. Let me know if it<br/>doesn&apos;t. BTW, I discovered a detailed mathematical derivation of this fact<br/>in 1993, which I could share with you. The analagous observation for chords<br/>of 3 notes is shown by the Voronoi plots I was spewing out a few months ago<br/>(remember?).</p><p>&gt;Could someone possibly construct such synthesized examples??</p><p>I thought we already had some on the net.

If you do, you&apos;ll see that there are<br/>two roughly equal maximal ambiguities between 4/3 and 3/2 (using the<br/>assumption that the listener&apos;s frequency resolution is 1%) and they occur at<br/>around 538&cent; and 656&cent;. There is a large trough at 7/5, and a really small one<br/>at 10/7, but the area between these ratios (including sqrt(2)) is lower in<br/>ambiguity than the 538&cent; and 656&cent;.</p></div>
