Schuyler Matthews published in 1910 called &apos;A Field<br/>Book of Wild Birds and their Music&apos;. it has staff notation, and all the<br/>birds he listened to seem to sing in tonal keys one can put a name to. But<br/>somewhere arougn the year he published his book, an odd thing happened:<br/>Stravinsky wrote the Rite of Spring, people discovered atonality in a big<br/>way, and apparently so did the birds! because subsequent books, such as<br/>the Catalogue Des Oiseaux of Olivier Messiaen and a couple of Scientific<br/>American articles I remember reading, seem to find the birds singing<br/>atonally too.</p><p>it reminds me much of the sex lives of monkeys: when 19th century<br/>ethologists went out to study them, they kept finding them living in happy<br/>little family groups with monogamous parents and mothers who stayed home<br/>and cared for the kids. Then somehow, in the 20th century people AND<br/>monkeys had some kind of a sexual revolution, where they indulged in group<br/>sex and lived in communes.

Didn&apos;t find anything at all. Maybe I was looking in<br/>the wrong place however.</p><p>The sonograms were completely useless for this. For one thing, the vertical<br/>scale was so compact, that one would be lucky to measure it to the nearest<br/>12 t note even. But also, for some reason, the lines are really thick and<br/>kind of fuzzy, and one can&apos;t get a clear pitch from them to measure.</p><p>I haven&apos;t really followed up frequency analysis much, but after listening to<br/>some bird song, felt that though there was a really clear percieved pitch<br/>for each note, so much else was going on that it mightn&apos;t be that noticeable<br/>in a frequency analysis.</p><p>So I tried doing a transcription myself of a phrase from a Robin&apos;s song, and<br/>used it as the example in FTS.</p><p>Here it is as a MIDI file:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/robin_phrase.mid">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/robin_phrase.mid</a></p><p>- just to give idea of what I&apos;m looking for.</p><p>It&apos;s the first phrase from the robin&apos;s song from this site:</p><p><a href="http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~siler/masi/eurosongs3.html">http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~siler/masi/eurosongs3.html</a><br/>Look under Robin - Erithacus rubecula.</p><p>Has anyone come across any transcriptions of bird song in some accurate<br/>pitch notation such as cents or herz. And have they been used in music at<br/>all? I know that Messiaen used birdsong transcriptions but in 12 tet, which<br/>seems rather bizarre to me!</p><p>I used the robin song as a basis for a music fractal for demonstration of<br/>the idea of using birdsong in FTS:<br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/bird_calls_with_Afro_Carribean_percussion.m">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/bird_calls_with_Afro_Carribean_percussion.m</a><br/>id</p><p>Robert</p><p><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/fts_beta/fts_beta_download.htm">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/fts_beta/fts_beta_download.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=13939 href="#13939">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2000 2:17:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jay Williams wrote,</p><p>&gt; And there&apos;s &quot;Oiseaux Vrai&quot; by Pierre Henri,</p><p>On an almost related note...
