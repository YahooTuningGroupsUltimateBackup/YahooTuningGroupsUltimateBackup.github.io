In reference to Johnny&apos;s<br/>noation ideas: I&apos;ve performed and coached/ taught many 72 note pieces,<br/>both as a fretless guitarist and as a composer, and the one great thing<br/>about Ezra&apos;s notation is it&apos;s ability to percieve the pitches ahead of<br/>time. We read ahead vetically first then horizontally. Once you go<br/>polymicro, you obviously can&apos;t have a symbol for everything and in my<br/>experience  giving a performer an idea what&apos;s about to happen ahead of<br/>time, makes it much easier to perform from there point of view. They<br/>know when they perform a polymicro piece they already know they&apos;re not<br/>in a set tuning/system. But having notation being deviations of the nat.<br/>notes and quarter tones prepares there minds and fingerings ahead of<br/>time. It can&apos;t be perceived as quartertone music, just like it can&apos;t be<br/>percieved as ET.</p><p>Al Giusto</p></div>
