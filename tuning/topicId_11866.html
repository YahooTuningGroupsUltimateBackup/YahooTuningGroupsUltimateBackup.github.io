A good composer is a good composer no<br/>matter what he uses. Soul is soul and no system or notes will provide that for you. So, denouncing<br/>72 and the people who use it should not even be an issue, even if you don&apos;t prefer it or like it.<br/>That&apos;s being shortsighted. Each system has it pluses and minuses and either you choose one that<br/>works for you, both internally and externally, or you choose them all.
