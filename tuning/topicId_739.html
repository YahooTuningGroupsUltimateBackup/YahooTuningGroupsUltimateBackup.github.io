I&apos;m not exactly sure WHAT Western &apos;rich&apos;<br/>&gt; chordal practices are based on, but I THINK it has a lot more with<br/>&gt; triad stacks (based originally on a JI trad) which are then warped<br/>&gt; till<br/>&gt; they settle to some minimum energy level (which still can have a nice<br/>&gt; buzz to it). (I guess I&apos;m a kook that think that whatever JdLs program<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; does, te basic intent is correct, IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH<br/>&gt; SUSTAINED CHORDS. Melodic cinsiderations and what happens when you mix<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; them are another thing).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not saying that overtones aren&apos;t where all this stuff starts out,<br/>&gt; and in McLarens post (where he was needlessly rude to you for three<br/>&gt; paragraphs, but I skipped that part) after making the great claims<br/>&gt; about inharmonic timbres being the majority of natural sounds he<br/>&gt; points out that harmonic timbres seem to be the majority of musical<br/>&gt; sounds.

However, this started<br/>with your assertion that the addition of sevenths, ninths etc was<br/>Western Music climbing up the overtone series. If we look at when<br/>these trends occurred, they occurred during an era when some sort<br/>of temperment was well established, and any prime identities higher<br/>5 were basically not present. However, the referential ideas I<br/>mentioned were certainly present, since the notes were being moved<br/>around to foster perfect transposition (even though they were losing<br/>other colors, as they&apos;d already lost the 7-limit intervals that was<br/>present in some of the meantones).</p><p>Okay, we don&apos;t have to beat a dead horse to death.</p><p>Bob</p></div><h3><a id=808 href="#808">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2001 6:28:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul!<br/>    Hope you don&apos;t mind an aside on this point.<br/>    I tend to lean toward the idea of integer ratios as a sonic gestalt<br/>analogous to the triangle, square and other primary geometric shapes<br/>with our vision. It would explain actual deviations fron the ideal as<br/>having that quality. Example. if we see a parallelogram with 89% angles<br/>we  will first see it as a square or as having squareness. It seems that<br/>there is a band around the 3/2 that we will here as having &quot;Fifthness&quot;<br/>or 3/2 ness. or better yet the octave having  range where we hear it as<br/>having octiveness. Partch mentioned such range of influence of different<br/>intervals.<br/>Brian ghas correctly shown that such things can be overrun by other<br/>factors when he states the 5/9 will sound like a fifthe will sound like<br/>a &quot;fifth&quot; but the 10/18 won&apos;t even though they are the same size. Lost<br/>his actual example on this, but take him to be sincere in this<br/>observation.  i myself have heard scales that were the &quot;opposite&quot; of a<br/>diatonic sequence of LLSLLLS being SSLSSSL and starting on the first L,<br/>i think it was, sounding like a diatonic!</p><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt; Wouldn&apos;t it be better to say &quot;harmonic series extractor&quot; rather<br/>&gt; than &quot;integer detector&quot;?
