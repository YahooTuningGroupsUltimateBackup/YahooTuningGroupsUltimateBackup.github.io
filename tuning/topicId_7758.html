Finally, you can sequence the MIDI, and so use the same<br/>keyboard with multiple tracks.  With a piano, you either need to get a<br/>group together, or use a multitrack recorder.  MIDI is easier.</p><p>&gt; &gt;My old PSR keyboard has white keys 1.8 cm center-center.  I found that<br/>&gt; &gt;playable, but not convenient.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Too narrow for my fingers.  There&apos;d be too much strain playing runs,<br/>&gt; having<br/>&gt; to ball up my hand.  And, how thick were your blacks?</p><p>7mm, according to my brother.  I don&apos;t know which bit he measured.</p><p>What do you mean by &quot;playing runs&quot;?  For playing conventional music with a<br/>conventional tuning, the fingering is cramped.  But with more than 12<br/>notes to the octave, your hands can spread out more.  That makes mini keys<br/>better the more notes are in the scale.</p><p>I have thought about buying a MIDI mini-keyboard.  One think that deters<br/>me is that the ones I&apos;ve seen advertised don&apos;t have many keys.  The more<br/>notes in the scale, the more keys you need!</p><p>&gt; &gt;When you say &quot;getting stuck between the blacks&quot; does that mean you&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt;deliberately playing the top end of the white notes?  This is possible<br/>&gt; &gt;with mini-keys, but not easy.  I&apos;d prefer to write music that doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;require such tricks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Such as music entirely in the key of C maj?</p><p>The easiest thing is to have the main scale on the black notes, and have<br/>some alternatives on the whites, ideally to be played by the thumbs or<br/>little fingers.  That&apos;s not too difficult for 4-note chords.  Remembering<br/>that, as the keyboard shrinks, you have more choice over which notes to<br/>play with which hand.</p><p>&gt; &gt;With a custom-built keyboard, the blacks could be thickened, and the<br/>&gt; &gt;keyboard made playable with a smaller span.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thickening the relative size of the blacks only makes the getting stuck<br/>&gt; problem worse -- or isn&apos;t that what you meant?</p><p>Yes, if that problem isn&apos;t a problem, you can shrink the keyboard quite a<br/>bit.</p><p>&gt; &gt;That&apos;s better, you&apos;re not talking about pre-requisites for &quot;any serious<br/>&gt; &gt;xen keyboard&quot; any more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes I am.</p><p>Oh, well, it&apos;s back to heated argument then.</p><p>&gt; You could spend your life playing wonderful music on a xen<br/>&gt; keyboard where you could only reach a 5/3.  But I wouldn&apos;t call it a<br/>&gt; serious alternative to the Halberstadt-12 keyboard, considering the<br/>&gt; types of voicings you&apos;d be giving up.</p><p>Yes, but think of what you&apos;d be giving up by *not* having such a<br/>keyboard/mapping!  You can&apos;t sit down and play a few different<br/>permutations of diminished chords to see which best fits the progression.<br/> You can&apos;t be playing simple chords, and decide to throw in a sharpened<br/>third on a whim.  Unless you&apos;re a dab hand with a pitch wheel, you can&apos;t<br/>play a melody teasingly out of tune with the accompaniment.
