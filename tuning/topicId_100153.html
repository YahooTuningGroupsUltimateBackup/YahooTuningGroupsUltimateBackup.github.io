I don&apos;t know if what I describe is even possible.</p><p>Here&apos;s the background. The structure of &quot;dynamic tonality&quot;, as I understand it, involves scale generation by the generator/period method.  In its polyphonic tuning bends, the size of the generator may change, and the other pitches follow suit, changing at a whole-number multiple of the rate of the generator&apos;s change.  For example, in a pythagorean chain, when the exact size of the fifth is adjusted, a note defined as being +8 fifths will move 8 times that amount.</p><p>What I want is a system of generation where the primary interval&apos;s adjustment would be the largest adjustment, and the further out in the chain you go, the differences diminish.</p><p>I want the system to be open, i.e. it can be carried out to any number of links.  I also want it to generate a variety of intervals with respect to the tonic, not simply converging on the unison for example.</p><p>----</p><p>A harmonic series is an instance of arithmetic sequence (f0*n where n=1 to ??) in the domain of frequency; A chain of fifths is an instance of arithmetic sequence (g*n mod p) in the domain of logarithmic pitch.  What, then, could a logarithmic analogue to the subharmonic series?</p><p>----</p><p>Any thoughts are appreciated.</p><p>Jacob</p></div><h3><a id=100154 href="#100154">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2011 11:58:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;piccolosandcheese&quot; &lt;udderbot@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Any thoughts are appreciated.</p><p>Yo might look at scales generated by linear recurrences such as those Jacques Dudon favors.</p></div>
