Digital<br/>may be perceived as a steamroller juggernaut by some, and its takeover<br/>of analog is probably inevitable (and already largely accomplished to<br/>date).  But digital is not a monster.  To the extent that analog<br/>recordings provide &quot;warmth&quot; or other desirable qualities, these can be<br/>simulated in digital.  Consider the following thought experiment: an<br/>advocate of analog recordings presents an example of his favorite music<br/>as rendered from analog equipment.  A phonograph record, perhaps.  We<br/>place the actual turntable behind a screen.  We make a very high quality<br/>digital recording of the output from the turntable.  We then play the<br/>music twice: once true analog, and once from the digital recording of<br/>the analog output.  If the listener cannot determine which is which,<br/>then digital has succeeded as a &quot;perfect&quot; recording medium without, in<br/>and of itself, succeeding as a perfect processing mechanism (an entirely<br/>separate problem).</p><p>&gt;But seriously though, I am itching, acheing, hopping and a popping to<br/>&gt;know if there is any programme that could enable my computer to act as<br/>&gt;an ANALOGUE devise as well as a digital one...</p><p>It can _simulate_ an analog device, but it can never _be_ an analog<br/>device.</p><p>&gt;Why do I say this???</p><p>&gt;....Well, the reason that I say this is because I was talking to a<br/>&gt;street busker who goes by the name of Pookie, and he is one awesome<br/>&gt;flute and recorder player, and he told me that most of the interesting<br/>&gt;stuff that has been done on analogue equipment has been done by<br/>&gt;mistake....</p><p>Not surprising.  Analog devices may often have &quot;interesting&quot; sonic<br/>distortion properties.  All of which can be simulated to arbitrary<br/>precision in the digital realm.</p><p>&gt;So, I got to thinking about a special sort of three state<br/>&gt;synthesizer/combined sampler, which enables us to use three types of<br/>&gt;bits, and from thus doing can make a summed power series in trinary,<br/>&gt;which has: [snip]</p><p>I&apos;m not really following the rest of your post, but I will make the<br/>observation that there is nothing magical about the number of discrete<br/>states a digital device has.  Binary is extremely convenient from<br/>several standpoints, but a true 10-base computer could be built if<br/>someone wanted to.  Adding additional digital states does not buy<br/>anything that cannot be achieved (probably more easily) by more bits in<br/>a binary device.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=21282 href="#21282">ðŸ”—</a>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>4/19/2001 8:34:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sarn,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Sarn Richard Ursell &lt;thcdelta@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; All this talk about analogue and digital information is making me<br/>&gt; click my heels.</p><p>I wondered what that sound I kept hearing was...</p><p>&gt; But seriously though, I am itching, acheing, hopping and a popping<br/>&gt; to know if there is any programme that could enable my computer to<br/>&gt; act as an ANALOGUE devise as well as a digital one...</p><p>Why don&apos;t you just get a tape recorder?
