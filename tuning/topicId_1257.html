In my opinion and theories, this<br/>&gt;involves primarily prime-factoring of the frequency<br/>&gt;ratios (perhaps others would admit  just odd-factoring).<br/>&gt;So in a way, this is a kind of &quot;sideways in pitch&quot;.</p><p>Joe, that is not the definition of chroma. Chroma is the sensation of<br/>pitch independently of octave-specificity. The other dimension,<br/>pitch-height, is completely octave-specific. The meaning of the<br/>two-dimensional model of pitch to which you refer is that the<br/>one-dimensional pitch continuum spirals its way through these two<br/>perceptual attributes. Nothing about periodicity pitch, and _certainly_<br/>nothing about prime factoring, is stipulated or relevant.</p></div>
