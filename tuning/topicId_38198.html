Does anyone predate that?</p><p>In discussing 34-ET, Barbour says that &quot;there is a surprising mention<br/>of the 34-division by Cyriac Schneegass in 1591, but his own<br/>monochord came closer to the 2/9 comma division.&quot;  After reading the<br/>rest of what Barbour had to say about Schneegass, I think that this<br/>sounds fishy.  Barbour also mentions that Bosanquet noted a<br/>relationship between 22-ET and 34-ET.</p><p>In considering advocacy, did any of you mention Ivor Darreg?  Under<br/>Monz&apos;s &quot;Equal Temperament&quot; tuning dictionary entry, just preceding<br/>the table of advocates, appears the following note:</p><p>&lt;&lt; The following composers have written in so many different equal-<br/>temperaments that they will (eventually) each have their own page:<br/>Ivor Darreg, Easley Blackwood, Brian McLaren, Marc Jones, Dan Stearns<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>I thought that this might explain why Ivor Darreg is not mentioned in<br/>the table entry for 34-ET; however, I see that his name appears under<br/>other divisions, so this is an omission that ought to be corrected.</p><p>Ivor Darreg not only advocated 34-ET (Xenharmonic Bulletin #9,<br/>October 1978, pp. 34-36, 40-41), but also gave a notation for it,<br/>along with guitar fretting tables and frequency tables.  (The tables<br/>were supplied by Erv Wilson and John Chalmers.)</p><p>And it gets even more interesting than that.  Darreg revealed that he<br/>learned about 34-ET from the passing mention that Joel Mandelbaum<br/>made to it in his doctoral thesis on 19-ET (of 1961).</p><p>*46-ET*</p><p>Something I would like to know is who first advocated 46-ET?  Barbour<br/>skipped right over it in his chapter on multiple division, so it<br/>probably didn&apos;t occur until after 1950.</p><p>I first took notice of 46 in the mid 1970&apos;s when I was looking for<br/>the lowest number ET that permits decent 17-limit harmony.  When I<br/>discussed this briefly with Erv Wilson, I learned that he was already<br/>familiar with its possibilities.</p><p>In recently reviewing Erv&apos;s correspondence with me, I found that his<br/>earliest mention of 46-ET (other than its inclusion in a diagram of<br/>many ET&apos;s) is in a proposal for a notation that could be used for<br/>about a dozen different ET&apos;s in a letter dated &quot;Jan 10, 1974&quot; (it was<br/>actually 1975 -- he typed the old year by mistake), in which he made<br/>special mention of 46.</p><p>Perhaps Kraig Grady could ask Erv about when he first discovered 46-<br/>ET and when he first wrote about it.
