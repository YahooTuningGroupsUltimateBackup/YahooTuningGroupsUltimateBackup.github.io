Essentially he wanted &quot;mechanical rights&quot; and Doty<br/>couldn&apos;t afford to give them.</p><p>Since the publisher considered this &quot;unprofessional&quot; he would not<br/>allow the piece, which was a solo horn piece in just intonation<br/>published by him, be included on the cassette.</p><p>I did my best to try to persuade him that all of this was<br/>an &quot;educational effort&quot; but to no avail.  It was one of the only<br/>really serious arguments we have had...</p><p>So, in that case, there was something other than his bias against<br/>xenhamonicism working there...</p><p>HOWEVER, curiously enough, some of the few xenharmonic pieces he has<br/>been handling have been some of the *most* successful.  From a<br/>certain perspective, I guess this is not so surprising, since they<br/>are a bit more &quot;original..&quot;</p><p>For example, my piece published by him for two horns in just<br/>intonation was the FIRST of my pieces to be included as a CIRCULATING<br/>score in the New York Public Library...</p><p>Well, I had nothing to do with it.  Somebody saw the published music,<br/>found it interesting, and included it as a circulating item in the<br/>library...</p><p>Maybe I can try to take that kind of &quot;angle&quot; if I work with him to<br/>try to publish more xenharmonic works.</p><p>Since the fellow is a bit old fashioned (although he is entirely<br/>crazy to publish ONLY contemporary American works in the first place)<br/>he is not at all interested in electronics but, as he say it, only<br/>music that &quot;&apos;real&apos; performers can play on a music stand.&quot;</p><p>For that reason, it will bother him that I have an electronic &quot;music<br/>minus one&quot; CD that comes with my newest xenharmonic works...</p><p>ADDITIONALLY, the fact that it is a CD presents problems, since he<br/>lumps it all together with the thought of generally selling CDs (he<br/>does thinking like this...).  Well, apparently several composers have<br/>been after him to sell their CDs as well as printed music, especially<br/>in this non-print day and age, so the whole idea of me having a CD<br/>is &quot;opening a real can of worms&quot; for him, so to speak.</p><p>I think your suggestion of having a &quot;different publisher&quot; is a good<br/>one... Although the SECOND publisher that I have, composer Meyer<br/>Kupferman&apos;s SOUNDSPELLS Productions, is, believe it or not, even MORE<br/>regressive than Raoul Ronson&apos;s SEESAW!  In fact, he has been<br/>rejecting some of my pieces, so I&apos;m a little pissed off about it, so<br/>I wouldn&apos;t DARE submit anything, er, &quot;peculiar&quot; to him, when he won&apos;t<br/>even take all of the &quot;regular&quot; stuff...</p><p>So, basically, it comes down to what a lot of composers are doing,<br/>SELF PUBLICATION...  However, I haven&apos;t yet thought about getting a<br/>second ASCAP PUBLISHER license, etc... which some composers are<br/>doing...  It&apos;s something to think about.</p><p>However, I also don&apos;t like SELLING things myself.  It&apos;s a turn off.</p><p>Most probably, I will just distribute the newer xenharmonic things<br/>myself free of charge to people who are interested and who will<br/>perform them.</p><p>After all, I have *enough* of my &quot;standard 12-tET&quot; music that is<br/>being SOLD...</p><p>And, at the moment, it is true, as Dan Stearns suggests, that I am<br/>*very* interested in all this...</p><p>In fact, I&apos;m not even sure what I would do in 12-tET right at this<br/>point.</p><p>I really can&apos;t think of anything...</p><p>_______ _______ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=305 href="#305">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/2001 8:36:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>Fascinating, &quot;in the trenches&quot; story, and I appreciate you sharing<br/>it.
