The number 2 is somewhat special in such a way that it meets two important conditions at the same time: A) It&apos;s a prime, B) It&apos;s an even number. This &quot;evenness&quot; gives it some kind of symmetry which no other prime can have (whatever you frame in chunks of two, it gives you the option to find the opposite meaning or value of the matter in question -- people must have been aware of this very long ago, concidering the fact that there&apos;s a translation for &quot;even&quot; and &quot;odd&quot; in perhaps all the languages I can think of). Should this symmetry occur in sounds, there should be an audible similarity between 100Hz and 200Hz which is remarcably stronger than in case of other intervals than 2/1. To explain my meaning of the &quot;opposite value&quot;, let&apos;s suppose mixing frequencies of 200-400-600-800Hz and so on and so on. This gives a harmonic spectrum with a fundamental of 200Hz. Shifting the entire frequency band 100Hz down, you get a different harmonic spectrum with a fundamental of 100Hz which is symmetrical in its shape since the even harmonics are missing. And, to get a &quot;happy ending&quot;, shifting the entire frequency band another 100Hz down gives the same spectrum as the original since the frequency of 0Hz is silent. Are you asking why the tones on an overtone flute are complementing so well? The answer is the same: When the flute is tuned to 200-400-600-800-...Hz when its opposite end is open, closing it shifts all the overtones approximately 100Hz down. -- BTW: When I was about 12, I realized that the even harmonics played alone can also produce a regular part of the series with the sole exception that it&apos;s an octave lower.

The number 2 is<br/>&gt; somewhat special in such a way that it meets two important<br/>&gt; conditions at the same time: A) It&apos;s a prime,</p><p>Why is that important?</p><p>&gt; B) It&apos;s an even number. This &quot;evenness&quot; gives it some kind of<br/>&gt; symmetry which no other prime can have (whatever you frame in<br/>&gt; chunks of two, it gives you the option to find the opposite<br/>&gt; meaning or value of the matter in question -- people must have<br/>&gt; been aware of this very long ago, concidering the fact that<br/>&gt; there&apos;s a translation for &quot;even&quot; and &quot;odd&quot; in perhaps all the<br/>&gt; languages I can think of).</p><p>How does this relate to the perception of consonance?</p><p>&gt;Should this symmetry occur in sounds, there should be a<br/>&gt;n audible similarity between 100Hz and 200Hz which is remarcably<br/>&gt;stronger than in case of other intervals than 2/1.</p><p>You&apos;re assuming the conclusion.</p><p>&gt;To explain my meaning of the &quot;opposite value&quot;, let&apos;s suppose<br/>&gt;mixing frequencies of 200-400-600-800Hz and so on and so on.<br/>&gt;This gives a harmonic spectrum with a fundamental of 200Hz.<br/>&gt;Shifting the entire frequency band 100Hz down, you get a<br/>&gt;different harmonic spectrum with a fundamental of 100Hz<br/>&gt;which is symmetrical in its shape since the even harmonics<br/>&gt;are missing.</p><p>What do you mean by &quot;symmetrical in shape&quot;?</p><p>&gt;And, to get a &quot;happy ending&quot;, shifting the entire frequency<br/>&gt;band another 100Hz down gives the same spectrum as the original<br/>&gt;since the frequency of 0Hz is silent. Are you asking why the<br/>&gt;tones on an overtone flute are complementing so well? The<br/>&gt;answer is the same: When the flute is tuned to 200-400-600-800-<br/>&gt;...Hz when its opposite end is open, closing it shifts all the<br/>&gt;overtones approximately 100Hz down. -- BTW: When I was about 12,<br/>&gt;I realized that the even harmonics played alone can also produce<br/>&gt;a regular part of the series with the sole exception that it&apos;s<br/>&gt;an octave lower.

A JI scale is epimorphic in monotonic order, or<br/>simply epimorphic, if any interval in the nth interval class is mapped<br/>by this to n. It is non-monotonically epimorphic if<br/>each interval class gets a unique number by such a mapping, but the nth<br/>interval above 1/1 does not neceesarily get mapped to n.
