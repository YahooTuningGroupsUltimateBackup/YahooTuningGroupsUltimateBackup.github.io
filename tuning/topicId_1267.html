[Is it _only_ a<br/>conceptually idyllic expansion of the original 72 tET Sims notation?]</p><p>Dan</p><p>*Some might find the crosshatches &#xFFFD;horizontalness&#xFFFD; too easily absorbed by<br/>the ledger lines&#xFFFD; perhaps something along the lines of a small circle (much<br/>like a degree symbol) could better accomplish the same task?</p><p>**Special microtonal accidentals that denote the specific variance in which<br/>a pitch differs from the standard notational target pitches of twelve tone<br/>equal temperament.</p><p>***Sixth tone notation [at least Sims] already has a very convincing &#xFFFD;track<br/>record.&#xFFFD;</p></div>
