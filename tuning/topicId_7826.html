While one may disagree with this item or<br/>that, I rather like reference works where the author&apos;s viewpoint is upfront<br/>rather than hidden behind some claim of consensus authority. I look forward<br/>to watching it grow.</p><p>For me, at least, it would be more useful if it were all on a single html<br/>page with internal links rather than in the one-definition-to-a-page format,<br/>which is much slower to use.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
