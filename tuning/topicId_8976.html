But then, I&apos;m a tromboneplayer, so whadya<br/>expect?<br/>It was composed in 1982 and so far as I can recall, the recurrence of sound<br/>environments is all multiples and submultiples of the Golden Mean. (I&apos;d just<br/>acquired a speaking calculator and was determined to take advantage of it.)<br/>At the time, I was quite taken with the NPR dramatization of &quot;Hitchhiker&apos;s<br/>Guide&quot; and especially the restaurant at the end of the universe. This piece<br/>seemed like something from that environment, but obviously, the sounds were<br/>of coming and going things. I also get a kick out of the New York Port<br/>Authority, so I combined the two images.</p></div>
