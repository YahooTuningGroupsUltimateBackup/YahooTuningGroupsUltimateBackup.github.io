We&apos;re throwing out our music paper<br/>(mostly) and letting our senses run amuck with an event curated by CC<br/>associate-directors Bill Rhoads and Lev Zhurbin.</p><p>Rara Avis, a trio organized by composer Gordon Beeferman on piano,<br/>with Seth Misterka on saxophones and Jeff Arnal on drums and<br/>percussion, has the uncanny ability of making totally spontaneous,<br/>improvised music seem fully composed.  Pure sound magic, so come for<br/>a dose of structured musical mayhem and surprise.</p><p>David First, a collaborator with legendary jazz pianist Cecil Taylor,<br/>will continue his explorations into &quot;Operation: Kracpot,&quot; for guitar<br/>and laptop, where waves from the earth&apos;s magnetic field are<br/>transposed and transformed into audio and visual information.  Bring<br/>your seat belts and space suits (no other attire necessary).</p><p>Percussionist/trombonist Stephen Moses (a.k.a. Drumbone), well known<br/>drummer with rock bands Alice Donut, Rasputina, Stuffy Shmitt,<br/>Voltaire, and Percy Jones, will present his unique and exciting<br/>simultaneous performance of drumset and trombone, enhanced with his<br/>signature syntheses of acoustic and electronic sounds.</p><p>And multi-instrumentalist, percussionist, turntable and frame drum<br/>specialist Raz Mesinai will pull sound from his seemingly endless and<br/>bewitching musical bag of tricks as can be heard on his recently<br/>released recordings on John Zorn&apos;s Tzadik label, and on the Roir<br/>label under his musical alter-ego, BADAWI. He will be performing his<br/>Rooms with additional players Mark Feldman on violin, Okkyung Lee on<br/>cello, Doug Wieselman on clarinet and Marcus Rojas on tuba.</p><p>It&apos;s time to look forward and exhilarate with new sounds to celebrate<br/>our 20 years of sonic nerve and splendor, to hear music in the making<br/>and bask in the ingenuity of some of the best improvisers/composers<br/>in New York.  Come join us in the modern atmosphere of our co-<br/>producer Makor, where food and a cash bar add to the mix.   Tickets<br/>$20 (20 years, remember?).</p><p>Info:  <a href="http://www.composersconcordance.org">www.composersconcordance.org</a> or 212-564-4899.</p></div>
