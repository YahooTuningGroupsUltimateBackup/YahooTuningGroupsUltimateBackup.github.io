I really like the nicey, sweet<br/>&gt; sevenish (as in 7-limit) sections too.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks so much, Dan, for your commentary. The piece, to me, is now a<br/>little like a funhouse mirror, actually a rather &quot;frightening&quot; one...</p><p>Sometimes I hear the piece the way it is intended, as an expansion of<br/>the sound continuum and then, sometimes, reverting back to<br/>my &quot;training&quot; I simply hear it as &quot;out of tune.&quot;</p><p>Fortunately, the former perception is starting to win out,<br/>particularly since I am totally bored with doing the 12-tET thing or<br/>hearing it anymore... but it&apos;s funny how perception changes depending<br/>on the mood!</p><p>&gt; Hey, what&apos;s with all that paper flipping or seat twitching or foot<br/>&gt; dragging... ?<br/>&gt;</p><p>What?!  You didn&apos;t realize that was part of the piece??  That was the<br/>&quot;John Cage angle...&quot;  No, but seriously, the problem was that the<br/>actual premiere at the DOM performance space in Moscow was marred.<br/>Well, the violist dropped her bow, to a very loud &quot;clack.&quot;  That will<br/>do it every time. Somehow, still,she only missed a few measures...</p><p>So, THIS second performance was done right in the electronic music<br/>studio (the &quot;Theremin&quot; Studio) of the Moscow Conservatory.  It was a<br/>live audience and they were actually passing around papers with<br/>lattices on them... which I had given them and which they had never<br/>seen before!</p><p>Maybe we&apos;ll eventually get a &quot;state of the art&quot; recording...</p><p>&gt; Thanks for posting this Joe, and keep up the good work!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Dan Stearns</p><p>Thanks so much, Dan, for your commentary and discussion, as usual.<br/>It&apos;s very helpful!</p><p>________ ______ ______ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>4/3/2001 12:22:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt;Sometimes I hear the piece the way it is intended, as an expansion<br/>of the sound continuum and then, sometimes, reverting back to my<br/>&quot;training&quot; I simply hear it as &quot;out of tune.&quot;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Sections like the sevenish one -- I mean the section that happens<br/>twice and takes the piece out -- are just too sweet and inveigling to<br/>cause too worrisome a reflexive panic attack I would think.

I&apos;m really not having much trouble,<br/>personally, with the piece... just &quot;anticipating&quot; some reactions I&apos;m<br/>going to get from some &quot;reactionaries...&quot;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt;Maybe we&apos;ll eventually get a &quot;state of the art&quot; recording...&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Personally I&apos;ve never much cared that much for tape and live<br/>performer performances -- not even with rap.

Could be that I&apos;m just old-fashioned though too...<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, I think many people would agree with you.  HOWEVER, studio<br/>recordings, at least in New York are VERY costly.  That&apos;s why some<br/>groups (even respectable ones!) have made live recordings at their<br/>concerts and then do ANOTHER take at the dress rehearsal.  Usually<br/>between the TWO versions there is something that can be &quot;spliced<br/>together.&quot;  Not optimal, but then the players only have to be paid<br/>ONCE fot the live gig and recording simultaneously... (If they&apos;ll<br/>agree to it... another &quot;problem&quot; with recordings... somehow some<br/>players think they&apos;ll make a &quot;mint&quot; on a modern music CD release...<br/>Nice thought!)</p><p>&gt; Anyway, once again, really nice piece. I&apos;m looking forward to what<br/>you do next.</p><p>Me too!  Looks like trombone is in the mix!</p><p>&gt;I think you&apos;re in a pretty unique position here at the list,<br/>&gt;as you&apos;re both prolific and firmly in the flow of recitals and the<br/>&gt; classical like. And you have been able to walk what your learning<br/>and exploring right out into the world of performances.</p><p>Well, thanks so much Dan.  Of course, these things don&apos;t happen by<br/>&quot;miracles.&quot;  I&apos;ve been establishing the performance possibilities for<br/>my music for many years now...</p><p>&gt;I would tend to<br/>&gt; think that the vast majority of microtonalist have to play most of<br/>&gt; what they learn and explore when it comes to alternate tunings.)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well... that&apos;s fine, too, especially if the composer is an, er...,<br/>&quot;adequate&quot; performer!</p><p>Thanks for the comments!</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe<br/>_________ _______ _______ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
