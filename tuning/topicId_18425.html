I&apos;m from Montr&eacute;al City in Qu&eacute;bec province.  I&apos;m studiing composition under Serge Provost at the Montreal Music Conservatory and observing JI since few years.  I&apos;m finishing my bacchelor&apos;s degree in composition and will start my master next year.  I only wrote a first saxophone trio in JI 9-limit as a first Etude for the instrumentists.  It will be recorded in late April or at the beginning of may.</p><p>Although I&apos;m not a strong mathematician and found sometimes all these theories quiet complicated, I&apos;m willing to learn all I can and most of all find way to applie these in the concret musical world (which is far more complicated ;o).</p><p>So, I&apos;ll hope to learn a lot with you guys !</p><p>This was my hello-all message ! ;o)</p><p>Vincent-Olivier Gagnon.</p></div>
