I<br/>&gt; thought a clavichord was a keyboard instrument.  &quot;Unfretted&quot;?</p><p>Yes, clavichords are a keyboard instrument. They have horizontal<br/>brass strings at right angles to the keytails; at the end of each key is a<br/>brass tangent, when you depress the key the tangent rises to the level of<br/>the strings where it rubs against them. The note that sounds is produced<br/>by the length of string from the tangent to the bridge, which is on the<br/>soundboard to the right of the keys.the string part that is to the left of<br/>the tangent is damped by means of woven &apos;listing cloth&apos;, otherwise you<br/>would hear two notes every time.</p><p>One can either have one string per note, as in an &apos;Unfretted clavichord&apos;,<br/>and this was really a late-eighteenth century invention, or one can have<br/>more than one string per note -- ergo &apos;fretted&apos;.</p><p>WHat I own are a &apos;keyed monochord&apos;, which has 12 keys, all diatonic except<br/>for one b-flat, and only one string for all 12 (plus another string which<br/>is plucked as a drone) -- this is a putative reconstruction of an<br/>ur-clavichord from the 14th or 15th century; A &apos;triple-fretted&apos; clavichord<br/>which has 45 notes on I think 18 string pairs; a &apos;double-fretted&apos;<br/>clavichord on a mid-eighteenth century model, with just over 4 octaves on<br/>37 string pairs; and the 5-octave unfretted I&apos;m giving this concert on.</p><p>The advantages to fretting are many -- the fewer strings the faster the<br/>tuning, also the fewer strings the less the sound-board is bound down and<br/>the louder the instrument. And the little ones are lighter, easier to<br/>transport. The problem is that you can&apos;t play strings that are fretted to<br/>the same string simultaneously. I can only play the monochord melodically.<br/>The double-fretted isno&apos;t much of a problem on Baroque music, because what<br/>you fret are notes to their sharps or flats, leaving two notes, in my case<br/>e and a, unfretted; and as long as you stick to the mean tone keys, you<br/>will seldom want to use them simultaneously.
