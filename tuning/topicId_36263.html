Did german tuners ca. 1800 use a<br/>cyclic temperament, he wonders?</p><p> Monz replied,<br/>&gt;Beethoven played organ, violin, and viola quite a bit as a youth,<br/>&gt; so it&apos;s very likely that he was exposed to meantone a lot in<br/>&gt; those days. as for his piano tuning, the most likely tuning would have been<br/>&gt; a &quot;circulating / irregular / well-temperament&quot;.</p><p>   Well, I certainly agree!  After tuning a bunch of pianos in a variety of<br/>era-plausible temperaments,   I am still finding new things, depending on the<br/>music.  Lately,  I have been listening to Beethoven on a 1/7 comma meantone,<br/>(9.3 cent and 23.5 thirds, but nothing in between), as well as the Kirnberger<br/>and Young on our CD&apos;s.  The &quot;Pathetique&quot; was chosen for its middle Ab<br/>section, which on the Kirnberger creates a full syntonic comma in the<br/>harmony, giving a very specific example of what 21 cent thirds are all about.<br/>On the modern piano, it is a pretty dreary sound back there.  Is that bad?<br/>Or is that good?  These are emotional questions, and in the case of the<br/>well-tempered Beethoven CD, the Pathetique sonata is the one that created the<br/>most feedback, and it was the expressiveness of the second mvt. that was most<br/>often mentioned.   As a piano tuner, it raised the hair on the back of my<br/>neck,  but pianists seem to dig right in there and revel in the pathos.  go<br/>figure.<br/>    One eye-opener has been going back to the Werckmeister Chromatic for<br/>Beethoven.  There is a smoothness there that seems out of proportion to the<br/>contrasts in the temperament, and indeed, the Young seems to be a little more<br/>agressively tempered for much of Beethoven&apos;s harmony.  It all depends on how<br/>it is played.<br/>   An artist did point out that there were numerous indications that<br/>Beethoven was using the normal order of temperament to emphasize a point,<br/>ie,  progressions that went from C to Cm, C#m, C#, E7 then B !!  The way LVB<br/>voiced this passage (it somewhere in op. 109), this series of modulation<br/>crawls right up the dissonance latter, finally pitching you over the edge<br/>where anything is going to feel like a resolution.</p><p>&gt;my own opinion<br/>&gt; is that this was most likely Kirnberger III, but it could have<br/>&gt; also been Valloti/Young or Werckmeister III, or something similar.</p><p>    And this brings up a particular point, made more focussed by Bill<br/>Sethares illustrations of timbre having such effect as it does.   Tuning a<br/>Graf copy in a Young for a recording project recently,  I was struck by how<br/>much less contrast there seemed to be between keys than what I had become<br/>accustomed to with modern pianos.  The symmetry was still apparent, but I<br/>felt I had pastels instead of oil paints.  The project was a Schubert<br/>recording, the texture seemed to be appropriate so we used it.<br/>      This leads me to believe that pianos today could most profitably be<br/>somewhat free in temperament matters.  Any of the conventional circulating<br/>temperaments that roughly follow Werckmeister&apos;s general style will provide, I<br/>believe, superior listening experiences to that found in ET.  This is not<br/>only true when used for music composed in the general sphere of influence as<br/>we might imagine to have existed in 1800 Vienna, but  much current music.<br/>      I don&apos;t think all those centuries of Meantone&apos;s bedrock influence<br/>disappeared in the face of Mersenne&apos;s  and Werckmeister&apos;s proposals,and the<br/>well-temperaments didin&apos;t stray too far from it.  That Kirnberger is a 1/4C<br/>tuning in disguise, &quot;just move them black notes over a little and we can all<br/>get round the circle&quot;.<br/>        There is a lot of 18th century music that &quot;fits&quot; perfectly well in<br/>meantone tunings, but also provides a very fine listening experience in the<br/>more complex colors of something like a Kirnberger,Young, Prelleur or the<br/>like.  How many distinguishable steps of color are necessary to fully express<br/>the composers intenetions?  The only way to know is to experience the<br/>differences, talking will not do it.<br/>     So, I think that for a tuner, the question is, which tuning maximizes<br/>the emotional  impact and engagement that the music can create?  Some<br/>inescapable factors are  artist, instrument,venue, crowd, room.   This is<br/>tuning by sensual parameters and is VERY dependant on initial conditions.<br/>Too strong for the pianist and their concentration is stolen from musical<br/>creation because of something amiss.  To strong for the listener and the<br/>experience is one of unexpected assault from the &quot;color&quot; (which the noviate<br/>will, to his dying day, call &quot;out of tuneness&quot;).   The art of temperament<br/>today is the art of giving the new listener enough of a dose to create an<br/>addiction to tonal art, but not so much that you scare them away before they<br/>are hooked.  Simple!</p><p>       The choice between the WT&apos;s has no right or wrong after a modern piano<br/>has been substituted for the more authentic model.  In comparaison to the<br/>early pianofortes, with modern pianos, the tonal contrasts are being<br/>presented in abstract flavors anyway.  Some like it hot, others not,<br/>everybody has their own idea of  how much is too much and there will always<br/>be some listeners that think too much is just right.</p><p>&gt;i&apos;ve been working on a webpage with an mp3 and analysis of<br/>&gt; the famous first movement of the &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; in<br/>&gt; Kirnberger III ... hope to be able to upload it sometime this<br/>&gt; month.</p><p>    Great.  I now have 3 MP3&apos;s of the Mozart Fantasie from &quot;6 Degrees&quot; in<br/>three tunings on a Steinway. They are 6.8 Megs each,  is there any convenient<br/>way of finding them a home that others could download from?  The record<br/>company has given me the go-ahead of posting them as free downloads, I just<br/>don&apos;t have a place to upload them to.

It is pretty easy to set up an <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> site, and they can hold a lot of music. Of course there are scores of other mp3 hosting sites besices <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>. If you have a slow line or are unable to post them for other reasons, I, or maybe someone else on the list with a fast line, would be glad to put them up. If you would like me to set up an <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> site for you, just let me know by private email, and we can arrange something.</p><p>John  Starrett</p></div>
