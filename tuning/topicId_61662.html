In fact, a quartertone is a gateway interval,<br/>often leading to other distinctive microtonalalia.</p><p>Personal frustration and fairness are understandable as well.  My sense is<br/>that each geographical locale needs to first assert its base before opening up<br/>to the greater microtonal world.

Have you seen my<br/>webpages containing an English translation of Moellendorf&apos;s<br/>book? This was his angle, and he was a primary influence<br/>on both Haba and Wyschnegradsky.</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/moellendorf/book/contents.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/moellendorf/book/contents.htm</a></p><p>&gt; i know that busoni wrote about 18; it thus seems (my<br/>&gt; tentative hypothesis, if you will) that the whole idea<br/>&gt; of a &apos;tone&apos; of 1/6 of an octave might be the culprit:<br/>&gt; then the explorative mind seeks to divide *it* by simple<br/>&gt; integer fractions, instead of exploring different sizes<br/>&gt; of tone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; in this way, this is another aspect of 12-equal being<br/>&gt; an &apos;industry standard&apos; tuning in a negtive way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; anyone have any other thoughts?</p><p>I don&apos;t really see it as &quot;negative&quot; ... 24-edo is just<br/>another avenue of microtonal exploration.

The pythagorean-comma&apos;s<br/>2,3-monzo is |-19 12 &gt;, which pretty much delineates<br/>a 12-tone scale, no matter what tuning it actually is.<br/>It&apos;s been with us humans for a long time.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2005 9:52:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Aaron,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s funny, is the quartertone so popular because of the<br/>&gt; &gt; acedemic popularity of composers like Carillo and<br/>&gt; &gt; Wyschenegradsky, or is it the multiple of 12 factor,<br/>&gt; &gt; or both, or none of the above?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t speak *too* authoritatively on academia (even<br/>&gt; tho i think i&apos;m an academe myself), since i dropped out<br/>&gt; of college ... but i doubt seriously the weight of<br/>&gt; &quot;the acedemic popularity of composers like Carillo<br/>&gt; and Wyschenegradsky&quot;.
