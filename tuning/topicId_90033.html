It even loads scala files!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW, before you get out the glue and wire, I&apos;d suggest trying a preliminary<br/>&gt; round with 80-lb-test fishing line wrapped in a spiral. You can tie one end<br/>&gt; to one of the tuning pegs and the other end to one of the screws anchoring<br/>&gt; the neck to the body (slightly loosened to expose the shaft, and the<br/>&gt; tightened down once the fishing line is tied tight). As long as you wrap it<br/>&gt; tight, it&apos;ll intonate as well as wire and is a good way of checking the<br/>&gt; intonation of your measurements. You can use a razor blade or kitchen knife<br/>&gt; to make little vertical cuts on the side of the fretboard to act as grooves<br/>&gt; to hold the fishing line in place, and these cuts will be good landmarks for<br/>&gt; when you put in the wire. It takes all of maybe two hours if you have a good<br/>&gt; ruler in 1/100&quot; scale, possibly less time if you really know what you&apos;re<br/>&gt; doing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; HTH!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, &quot;christopherv&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I just purchased a used Fender Squire strat copy ($60) in order to make a<br/>&gt; microtonal electric.
