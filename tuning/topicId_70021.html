This is a particularly weird temperament because it uses the same interval for perfect fourths and major thirds! But I think I&apos;m starting to get the hang of how to use it. I was going to do a bit of orchestration on the parts, but I liked how it comes out with just a plain single timbre, a kind of bell-ish sound done with some ring modulation and filtering in rgc:audio z3ta+, so I kept it that way.</p></div><h3><a id=70022 href="#70022">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@dividebypi.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2007 7:13:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Nice, Herman! I enjoyed the calm strangeness. Vaguely ethnic sounding<br/>in spite of being synthetic.
