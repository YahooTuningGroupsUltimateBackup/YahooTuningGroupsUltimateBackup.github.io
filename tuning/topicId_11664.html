The &apos;accepted and cool&apos; polyrythms of African music and its<br/>derivatives (Haitian and Cuban Yoruba inspired religious drumming and<br/>jazz drumming, for instance) are generally 3:2, 6:4 perhaps 4:3. Often<br/>WITHIN the 4 and 3 there will be duple and triple subdivisions as well,<br/>but typically one doesn&apos;t find higher primes.</p><p>There are a few observations.</p><p>  Rhythm &apos;chords&apos; are much simpler than harmonic chords.</p><p>  In most musics, rhythmic motion is analogous to &apos;drone&apos; oriented<br/>  music (it is rare to see music where the tempo is multiplied by<br/>  4/3 for two measures, whereas in Western music one can see the<br/>  harmony make such a transition).</p><p>  Prime limit seems to be more important than odd limit (i.e., &apos;9&apos;s are<br/>  more common than &apos;5&apos;s and &apos;7&apos;s)</p><p>There may be some interesting observations regarding &apos;tuning&apos; perception,<br/>is 7:4 in rhythm perceived as an &apos;out  of tune&apos; 8:4? (Perhaps, if a jazz<br/>drummer does this, it might be inthe context of playing &apos;behind the beat&apos;).</p><p>The point you bring up is a grouping aspect. I don&apos;t think grouping is<br/>an analogue to tuning, as per my thoughts above. I also don&apos;t see the<br/>difficulty with large groupings, although how the players approach it<br/>is important. It may pay to find the paper &apos;the magic number 7 plus or<br/>minus 2&apos;. If there is a heirarchical level at which the grouping is<br/>&apos;2&apos;s and &apos;3&apos;s and the structure of the heirarchy is &apos;7 plus or minus 2&apos;,<br/>then I think it can be held onto.</p><p>However, what may be valid in your analoque is that at some level, maybe<br/>a 17 beat form, maybe 29, things start turning into a random mixture of<br/>&apos;2&apos;s and &apos;3&apos;s unless a further heirarchical level is found.</p><p>An analogy to tuning can be made at the level of these long forms,<br/>and that is between polymetric thinking and to &apos;punning&apos; in a<br/>temperment. For instance, a 33 beat form may be phrased<br/>8 5 7 5 8 or 11 11 11 (and others of course).<br/>In a recent tune of mine, the basic phrase structure is</p><p>               5 * [ 3 * 4/4 ]    (AABA&apos;A&apos;)  ----------&gt;    A<br/>               2 * [ 3 * 3/4 + 1 * 4/4 ]   (DD&apos;) ------&gt;    B<br/>               1 * [ 3 * 4/4 ]     A  ------------\<br/>               2 * [ 2 * 4/4 ]     A&apos;&apos; ------------\---&gt;    A&apos;</p><p>Since it&apos;s a jazz tune, you improvise over the form. From an improv point<br/>of view, you might phrase the &quot;three bars of 4/4&quot; section as &quot;4 bars of<br/>3/4&quot;. If we relate it to harmony, we&apos;re really only playing with the<br/>&apos;timbre&apos; of the the rhythmic chord, making it a bit more strident. A<br/>more relaxed approach (but harder to hold onto) is to improvise 3<br/>phrases of 20 beats each during the &apos;big A&apos; section.</p><p>These games are common in most rhythmic musics.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
