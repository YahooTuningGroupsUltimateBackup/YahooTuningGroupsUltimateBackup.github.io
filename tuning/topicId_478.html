All you hear is the relationship<br/>&gt;between<br/>&gt;two notes without all the beating from overtones of a timbre - just<br/>&gt;the beating of the notes..</p><p>Clearly there is a vast gulf between this point of view and the one<br/>presented by Sethares. Although it is true that only intervals near 1:1<br/>can create beating in the absence of harmonics, there are many<br/>psychoacoustical effects that both create harmonics for sine waves and<br/>create fundamentals for the sine waves to be harmonics of. This effects<br/>must explain what David Beadsley is hearing, but these effects must be<br/>subtle enough to have been unnoticed in the classic Plomp &amp; Levelt<br/>experiment, except for the case of 2:1 (two sine waves at a near-2:1<br/>ratio do create beating -- this is called second-order beating). I would<br/>have to side with Sethares that JI (and, I would add, utonal harmony in<br/>particular) really works best when the tones are fairly rich in harmonic<br/>partials. Inharmonic timbres often demand that JI not be used and non-JI<br/>tunings are clearly more consonant. Sine waves alone are fairly amenable<br/>to any kind of tuning, although many sine waves in a harmonic-series<br/>(otonal) relationship produce the special effect of a single tone with a<br/>rich, harmonic timbre. This is the effect that LaMonte Young exploits<br/>and is very different from the considerations that lead many to suggest<br/>JI for performances of common-practice music on conventional<br/>flexible-pitched instruments.</p></div><h3><a id=504 href="#504">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/27/1999 10:57:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>From: &quot;Paul H.
