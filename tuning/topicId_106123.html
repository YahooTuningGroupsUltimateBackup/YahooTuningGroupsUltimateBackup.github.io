I wanted to wait until I have my 31-EDO guitar, but there were some problems which I didn&apos;t expect that delayed the process. Well, anyway...</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>I&apos;m an autodidact from Germany who&apos;s into microtonal music for a long time.</p><p>My interest more or less started when I still went to school, when I realized that (in common practice) there were only 12 pitches per octave, but an infinite number of ways to note them via classical notation. I was convinced that there was some deeper meaning behind the general agreement that it depends on the musical context whether one should write &apos;D#&apos; or &apos;Eb&apos;.</p><p>This (among other things) led me to pythagorean tuning, 5-limit just intonation, 53-EDO, and later meantone temperament. I also realized that classical notation can be extended using linear tunings with a fifth generator and an octave period, and that 5, 7 or 12 notes work especially well, since even after modulation the ordering of the notes remains.<br/>It took me a lot of time to realize that this is the same concept Erv Wilson described as &quot;moments of symmetry&quot;, though.</p><p>After graduation from school, I started studying at a German university with a computer science major (which includes a lot of mathematics) and a musicology minor. I learned a lot of useful and interesting things related or applicable to music theory. Also, a professor recommended to me a book by Martin Vogel, who has become one of my major inspirations.</p><p>A very fascinating and hard-to-describe moment was when I discovered scala. For me, microtonality was just an abstract concept that existed in my mind until then, but now I could actually hear what a just 5:4, 7:4 or 7:6 sounds like!</p><p>Discussions about microtonal music in regular music forums tended to be more tiring than helpful, and since I didn&apos;t know of any German microtonal music forum, I eventually gave up on them, and continued to study microtonal music on my own.</p><p>Later, I stumbled upon Ron Sword&apos;s microtonal guitarist forum where I learned some interesting and useful basics, and which was basically my gate to the English speaking xenharmonic community. When I wanted to join <a href="http://nonoctave.com">nonoctave.com</a>, I realized that it didn&apos;t exist anymore. In October 2012, I joined Ig&apos;s forum, and when it went offline again after less than a month due to a lack of general interest, I found the yahoo groups to be the only other remaining discussion platform that was halfway acceptable to me, so I registered here, and I have to say I learned a lot! :)</p><p>In an earlier discussion, I was asked here about my real name, and why I&apos;m using a pseudonym. My reason why I use a pseudonym is that this is an open platform, and I want to be able to freely express myself without having to worry that anyone who knows my real name can google it, and read about my &quot;weird&quot; interests, or personal opinions. I hope that&apos;s understandable. However, it&apos;s not that I&apos;m someone who was active here before, and simply wants to hide their previous identity (I didn&apos;t achieve anything noteworthy related to microtonal music that is publicly connected to my real name, or other pseudonyms).<br/>Also, I have to apologize to you, Carl; I think my reaction to your criticism back then was a little harsh, and I shouldn&apos;t have called another opinion &apos;dogmatic&apos;, just because it didn&apos;t coincide with mine.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>You can find further info about me in my SoundCloud profile, though there are hardly any audio files yet, since I&apos;m still waiting for my guitar:</p><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/gedankenwelt">https://soundcloud.com/gedankenwelt</a></p><p>If you have questions, just ask, though I&apos;m going to create some new topics anyway - I hope for some interesting discussions. ;)</p><p>Best<br/>- Gedankenwelt</p><p>P.S.: Sorry in case of bad English</p></div><h3><a id=106124 href="#106124">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2013 10:19:38 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, I should apologize too.

I&apos;ll also implement extended just intonation, by converting the 12-EDO pitches to the 12-tone pythagorean MOS scale, and adding accidentals for the pythagorean, syntonic and septimal comma, for the undecimal quartertone and so on.</p></div><h3><a id=106131 href="#106131">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2013 6:50:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Very cool, g94!
