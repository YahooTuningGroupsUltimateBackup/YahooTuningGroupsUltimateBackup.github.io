I<br/>can<br/>&gt; understand why 24-tone Eastern music doesn&apos;t sound completely alien<br/>&gt; because all the Western intervals are still there. Is that the case<br/>&gt; with 17-tone as well?</p><p>17-tone, whether it is equal, or with basically &quot;equal&quot; regions<br/>(like a well-temperament), or all the way out to more or less straight<br/>Pythagorean, is one of the most &quot;accessible&quot; of the &quot;microtonal&quot;<br/>tunings, in my opinion.</p><p>I realized today as I was whistling the opening figure of a<br/>scratchy old album I listened to day in day out as a child, of<br/>Hungarian gypsies playing homemade instruments, how many sounds in 17,<br/>especially the seconds, are suspiciously similar, so my love of 17 may<br/>come from a bias of almost 40 years. :-)</p><p>The closest uses to Western music would be, for example, a major scale:<br/>(0 is the tonic, 0&deg; the octave, the numbers are steps)</p><p>0,3,3,1,3,3,3,1,0&deg;</p><p>In 12-tone the large steps are 2 and the small steps 1. So right away<br/>you know 17 tends to be more &quot;romantic&quot;, in other words, reminiscent<br/>of what&apos;s called expressive intonation in Western music.</p><p>In this scale from 17 tones, the M2 is right there where the second is<br/>in many, many, tunings including the M2 of contemporary Western music,<br/>just somewhat broad. It&apos;s wide of 12-tone equal temperament, 11<br/>cents higher, but there&apos;s a lot less 12-tET than there appears to be:<br/>the most straightforward M2, 9/8, which happens all the time in<br/>real-life performances of music that&apos;s 12-tET on paper, is also wide<br/>of 12-tET&apos;s 200 cents, by about 4 cents.</p><p>The M3 is quite high, but nothing you haven&apos;t heard in music from<br/>around the world, and in Western orchestral or choral music in<br/>different contexts (if the violin melody is stepping up to the fourth,<br/>or it&apos;s a very cheerful song, the third might be performed &quot;wide&quot;, for<br/>example).</p><p>Depending on what kind of 17-tone tuning, the P4 might be just that,<br/>a 4/3, or it might be a little low/dark. But still obviously a<br/>fourth, just a little dramatic.</p><p>The fifth is usually great- it&apos;s usually a tiny bit wide and<br/>&quot;brassy&quot;, which is how I like it, and I suspect that it is actually,<br/>literally, brassy- ie, similiar to the stretched-harmonics fifths<br/>of a brass intrument. Completely in keeping with traditional<br/>emotional &quot;fifths&quot; associations of simultaneous consonance, boldness<br/>and brightness.</p><p>The M6 is just that, brighter than 12-tET&apos;s, with one curious<br/>characteristic. Because the M3 is so high and active-sounding, the<br/>relatively straight-sounding M6 gives the &quot;major scale&quot; in 17 a touch<br/>of modal or ancient sound, to my ears. It&apos;s also very faintly flavored<br/>like the &quot;harmonic major&quot; of Slavic music, where you have a minor<br/>sixth used in a major scale. Another source of my bias toward 17,<br/>probably.</p><p>The M7 in a 17-tone &quot;major scale&quot; is high, very leading-tone<br/>sounding.</p><p>That&apos;s just one possibility with 17 tones. From there you have<br/>corollaries to all the &quot;church modes&quot;, then a huge number of<br/>so-called &quot;altered&quot; scales.</p><p>And of course, the wonderful &quot;median&quot; intervals, because with 17 tones<br/>you can have a dark version of each interval, a bright version, and a<br/>median version which is somewhat dark, or bright, or something else<br/>altogether, depending on context. These are great intervals and<br/>harmonies, perhaps more difficult to use than major or minor, but<br/>emotionally... I just don&apos;t have the words.</p><p>In spite of the technical name &quot;median&quot; or &quot;neutral&quot; for many of the<br/>intervals you can get in 17, the tuning doesn&apos;t do &quot;medium&quot; sounding<br/>things well. It doesn&apos;t have the calmness of a tuning that gives<br/>you a &quot;high&quot; ie. most pure minor third and a &quot;low&quot; pure major third.<br/>(6/5 and 5/4). The mellowness of the &quot;median&quot; intervals in 17 is<br/>completely different.</p><p>As far as modulation, you can go from oily smoothness, just as you can<br/>in any tuning with many small intervals, to violent leaps.</p><p>It so happens that my take on the &quot;accessibility&quot; of 17-tone<br/>tunings isn&apos;t theoretical, but is coming from the trenches. Friday<br/>I had an outdoor concert, following two hours of &quot;put your hands in<br/>the air&quot; DJing no less, with a third of the music in 17 (the rest<br/>in a well-temperament 12, with some outre tuning flourishes). I<br/>believe that only the synth player from another band even noticed<br/>that there was &quot;alternative&quot; tuning going on, and he was thrilled.</p><p>Very positive audience response. A couple of qualifiers: Slovenia,<br/>where I live, is the borderland of Europe and the Balkans, even the<br/>most mainstream audience has heard all kinds of tunings and rhythms in<br/>their life.</p><p>Also, as Frank Zappa remarked, Schoenberg would be<br/>popular if he had the Earth, Wind and Fire rhythm section: even if<br/>they&apos;re odd rhythms, I&apos;ve got percussion thumping along quite a bit.</p><p>And another qualifier- for concerts I do longer and more repetitive<br/>versions of tunes with a &quot;ritornello&quot;, so I saw a couple of<br/>people singing along at the end of the tunes. Also, preceding<br/>the ritornello, a freak-out or unabashedly &quot;out&quot; bit, so the main<br/>theme has even more clarity and simplicity in contrast.<br/>That&apos;s just familiarity, plain and simple, and increasing the feeling<br/>of consonance by using dissonance.</p><p>Like it or not, &quot;microtonalists&quot; in our time do have something of a<br/>pedegogical responsibility to their audience.</p><p>Sorry to ramble on, just a big fan of seventeen and very happy with<br/>it. Slices, dices, and that&apos;s not all!</p><p>If you go here:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html</a></p><p>and read what Margo Schulter has written on Gothic polyphony, you&apos;ll<br/>find a great introduction to one beautiful way of using 17-tone<br/>tunings. I&apos;m studying this also, in order to enrich my fundamentally<br/>tetrachordal approach, which I derived from a Bulgarian textbook<br/>years ago.</p><p>Take care,</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2006 11:38:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>misterbobro wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Does the 17-tone scale &quot;line up&quot; particularly well with 12-tone?

Would you also agree that it&apos;s usually<br/>transcriptions that are most likely to sound kitschy on a piano? If<br/>so, then we actually probably don&apos;t have anything to argue about,<br/>except a matter of degree.

Perhaps I&apos;m a crappy<br/>writer, I&apos;ll admit. I don&apos;t believe that intervals inherently<br/>represent other, simpler intervals (as I&apos;ve said before- I call it<br/>the &quot;justification&quot; of intervals). It&apos;s a complex subject.</p><p>Obviously I believe in an interval being first and foremost simply<br/>what it is (I use higher primes and ratios in tunings), but balance<br/>this with the physical reality that a singer for example may very<br/>well sing the nearest simpler interval. This is why I said, for<br/>example, that 11 and 23 are the soulmates of 17. You can make an<br/>almost-equal 17 tone tuning using the prime 23, and those relatively<br/>complex intervals are, to my ears, simply what they are,<br/>neither &quot;equal&quot; nor approximations of simpler intervals (so I sweat<br/>to make them precise).  On the other hand, the reality is that<br/>intervals also can, and do, have multiple identities, and a singer<br/>singing 14/11 when the keyboard is playing some complex ratio a<br/>couple of cents higher is groovy.</p><p>&gt;I can<br/>&gt; hear the difference between 400 and 408, and in many contexts they<br/>&gt; have importantly different musical characters.</p><p>Certainly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want to talk about Bach, it may be that he adapted his<br/>&gt; composing style according to whether the thirds were slightly<br/>below or<br/>&gt; above 400 in an irregular tuning. I don&apos;t think he was deaf or<br/>&gt; dishonest or kitsch. Maybe even Chopin tuned unequally.</p><p>Of course! Dishonest or kitsch is the opposite of that, as I keep<br/>repeating.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; For someone who could exploit the differences between 392 and 400<br/>and<br/>&gt; 404, lumping 400 and 408 together is also humorous.</p><p>Yes. Sometimes I stress about the difference between 704.8 and<br/>705.3, other times it doesn&apos;t matter, like everyone here I imagine.<br/>It&apos;s the mindless &quot;lumping&quot; that&apos;s the problem.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Whoops, that rules out pianos, organs, and pretty much every<br/>&gt; &gt; instrument when played in the Western manner (...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... *if* you make the unwarranted assumption that keyboard<br/>&gt;composers<br/>&gt; wanted or expected pure thirds and were deaf to the sounds their<br/>&gt; instruments actually produced.</p><p>I don&apos;t make that assumption- I make the assumption that composers<br/>want ALL KINDS of thirds, and whatever they want, different musics<br/>take on a life of their own and &quot;want&quot; different thirds.</p><p>I was refering to creating character through timbre, in other words,<br/>depending on tone color to express interval character, which<br/>obviously requires multiple timbres for multiple intervals. The<br/>point of this was to illustrate that on instruments with even<br/>timbres, this is a very limited option.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; High M3s and low m3s are today, and have been for what, a<br/>&gt; &gt; thousand<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plus years, a part of the Western tradition.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What about the 16th and 17th centuries?

Ireland is further west than Vienna. :-) Or<br/>by &quot;Western tradition&quot; do you mean specific ethnic groups of<br/>specific social status in specific places in the Western world?<br/>That&apos;s a fundamental non-understanding of what the &quot;Western&quot; world<br/>was and is.</p><p>&gt; The change from Pythagorean to meantone around 1500 was real and<br/>&gt; fundamental, so was the later change in keyboards from meantone to<br/>&gt; equal-tempered, and good composers and players reacted to the<br/>changes accordingly. So who are you calling dishonest?</p><p>I&apos;m calling dishonest the music of those who DIDN&apos;T and DON&apos;T react<br/>to the changes. Which is a whole lot of music. WHOM am I calling<br/>dishonest? No-one, I don&apos;t pretend to know intentions. I called the<br/>MUSIC dishonest.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; but I don&apos;t think all of Western keyboard-based &gt;music<br/>&gt; from the mid-18th century through the 20th deserves the same<br/>&gt;condemnation.</p><p>Certainly not- as I said before, transcriptions are most<br/>susceptible. If it&apos;s 12-tET meant to be 12-tET and not pretending to<br/>be something else far away, that&apos;s not kitsch of course.

You are very lucky to be able to play without frets.  I<br/>have been scratching my head lately trying to work out ways to make<br/>guitars and other instruments more fiddle and trombone-like in their<br/>flexibility.  I made a 31 equal temperament guitar fret board, put<br/>it on the guitar, and soon realized that I&apos;d never be able to master<br/>the thing.  There were just too many frets.  I&apos;m sure that better<br/>guitarists would have better luck, but, it was too difficult for me.</p><p>Of course, with guitars, playing chords without frets is more than a<br/>little tricky.  You have to settle for some sort of open tuning and<br/>use a slide or be very, very good at fingering six strings<br/>simultaneously.  On the higher end pedal steel guitars you can<br/>change tunings on the fly with a pedal.  Maybe there is a way to rig<br/>a whammy bar to accomplish something similar with a standard<br/>guitar?  These are just some ideas bouncing around in my head.</p><p>Good luck in your tuning adventure.</p><p>Robin</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;VITAL ALTCHEH&quot; &lt;alcher@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robin,<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt; At the moment I am learning, and I don&apos;t know what I want yet.<br/>&gt; I replaced the fingerboard of my pot-belly mandolin to a fretless<br/>one.<br/>&gt; I am lucky in the sense that I don&apos;t need a fret for perfect pitch.<br/>&gt; Others rely to much on frets.<br/>&gt; Depending on your mood, the music takes different directions and<br/>&gt; intonations.<br/>&gt; I may not know 17,19,22,31,53, and 72 , but probably I may have<br/>used it<br/>&gt; without knowing.<br/>&gt; Vitally.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: &quot;Robin Perry&quot; &lt;jinto83@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Saturday, October 28, 2006 4:32 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: everybody loves<br/>microtones.......................<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Vital,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have done some re-fretting of guitars.

I opted for the former, and I still need to work out the buzz, but it works pretty well with metal strings. I don&apos;t tune it conventionally; rather I use tenor banjo strings and the short string and tune it d&apos;-a-d-G from top to bottom. It sounds a little like a C&iuml;&iquest;&half;mb&iuml;&iquest;&half;s saz.</p><p>Playing chords would be an obvious issue, but I tend to use simpler chords and droning open strings a lot anyway.</p><p>~D.</p></div>
