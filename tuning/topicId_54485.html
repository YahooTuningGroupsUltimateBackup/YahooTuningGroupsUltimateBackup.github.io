A<br/>couple of people from around here do so.</p><p>2. Join the forum Making Microtonal Music, and I can at least host it<br/>for a few weeks on the domain I maintain for that group at<br/><a href="http://www.microtonal.org">www.microtonal.org</a></p><p>3. You could try uploading to the files area of this forum, but I<br/>don&apos;t know how big your file is, and we have had trouble with larger<br/>downloads from the forum files sections (which is why #1 and #2...)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2004 12:13:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Eric!</p><p>&gt;     I&apos;ve attempted to post my initial forays into writing<br/>&gt; electronic music in Just Intonation here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.geocities.com/tritone_msu/JI">http://www.geocities.com/tritone_msu/JI</a></p><p>Dude, those are two very cool cuts!  The Partch Chorale<br/>is one of the most interesting things I&apos;ve heard in a<br/>long time.
