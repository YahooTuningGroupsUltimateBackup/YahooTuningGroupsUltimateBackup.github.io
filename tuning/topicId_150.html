WAV format would be out of the question.</p><p>&gt;&gt;A web or ftp site where users could post their files would be much<br/>better.  &gt;&gt;People could post to this list to reference a given file on the<br/>audio site.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Are there any reasons why this would be better other than these bandwidth<br/>&gt;concerns you mentioned?  I can&apos;t think of any.</p><p>Probably the best idea is Starrett&apos;s suggestion of a newsgroup.</p><p>&gt;Download times for each message from an HTML tuning list would be roughly<br/>&gt;the same as for a typical web page.</p><p>Typical web pages do not have sound files on them.</p><p>&gt;We used to have a photo of Partch in the Center D Genovese used to have it<br/>&gt;posted of Hp viewing the Arp monster and saying something like &quot;great<br/>after &gt;forty years and now that I&apos;m dying finally an instrument I could<br/>have used&quot;--&gt;not an exact qoute.</p><p>I have a copy of this.</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=171 href="#171">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@texas.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/1999 5:22:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I think you are underestimating the amount of bandwidth needed for even a<br/>&gt; few real audio or mp3 files.  WAV format would be out of the question.<br/>&gt; Typical web pages do not have sound files on them.</p><p>    Clearly that depends on how long the sound file is.  I was not thinking in<br/>terms of entire compositions, but few-second audio snippets to illustrate the<br/>musical concept we&apos;re talking about.</p><p>    For example, we&apos;ve recently chatted about several kinds of meantone.  It<br/>sure would be great if we could actually *hear* these different tunings rather<br/>than just spouting numbers at each other.  So, one of us could have a<br/>two-second audio clip of, say, an authentic cadence in quarter-comma meantone,<br/>and another two-second clip of that same cadence in third-comma meantone.</p><p>   That&apos;s four seconds at (if telephony-grade WAV files are fine for such<br/>illustrative purposes) 8K bytes per second, or 32K bits.  At a connection rate<br/>of 33.6Kbps (I average closer to 42Kbps) that would probably take somewhere<br/>around three seconds to download, including a lot of overhead.</p><p>   Gosh, is that really all that big a deal?</p><p>   And yet, as with a picture, an audio comparison, even a low-fidelity one,<br/>lets us escape the realm of silent numbers and raw theory into the realm of<br/>direct audio experience.</p></div>
