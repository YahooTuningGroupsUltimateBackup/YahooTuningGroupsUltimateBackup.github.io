It clearly gives one B# in Book V and another B# in<br/>Book VI.  The former we know about.  It&apos;s in Merce grido piangendo, and<br/>forms the diesis with C.</p><p>I&apos;ve been through Book VI several times, and can&apos;t find a B#.  The first<br/>person to spot it wins a special prize of Nothing.  Treasure it, it&apos;s the<br/>fabric of the Universe!</p><p>If it turns out there isn&apos;t a B# in Book VI, and Watkins is correct about<br/>the other books, then none of them goes beyond 19 notes to the octave.<br/>The order of composition doesn&apos;t match the order of publication, so it&apos;s<br/>not that Gesualdo retuned his harpsichord between Books V and VI, but I<br/>would like to pin this down.</p><p>               Graham</p></div>
