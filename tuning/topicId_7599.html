And now as someone who does not get the digest form I would like to ask that if you are re: ing to like 10 folks to please<br/>put it in one email. THis may spare NON-digesters from getting 40 messages when there could be one. Hope this is not too snotty</p><p>Love and tets<br/>Pat</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Access your e-mail anywhere, at any time.<br/>Get your FREE BellSouth Web Mail account today!<br/><a href="http://webmail.bellsouth.net">http://webmail.bellsouth.net</a><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p></div><h3><a id=7600 href="#7600">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
