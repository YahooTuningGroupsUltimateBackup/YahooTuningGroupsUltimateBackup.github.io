I think Schoenberg&apos;s unaccompanied choral<br/>&gt; works are not all that much divorced from tonality.</p><p>I myself like to indulge in retuning Schoenberg&apos;s music<br/>and try to divine what JI harmonic structures he might<br/>have had in mind while composing it. However, the caution<br/>against this is that Schoenberg himself explicitly spoke<br/>out against musicians conforming their performance to<br/>the &quot;pure&quot; intervals, in a well-known letter to Joseph<br/>Yasser from 1934.</p><p>Quoting myself, because i can no longer find the text<br/>of Schoenberg&apos;s letter online (it used to be out there<br/>somewhere):</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/17165">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/17165</a></p><p>&gt;&gt; &quot;[Schoenberg] ... later (in a much-quoted letter to<br/>&gt;&gt; Joseph Yasser) insisted that good musicians did not<br/>&gt;&gt; let their technique be dictated by &quot;natural&quot; (= JI)<br/>&gt;&gt; tendencies, but rather learned how to alter these<br/>&gt;&gt; tendencies to conform to &quot;humanistic&quot; (= 12-tET) art.&quot;</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>friederich_stellwagen &#x3C;ibo.ortgies@hsm.gu.se&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2007 7:57:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ibo Ortgies&quot; &lt;ibo.ortgies@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi,</p><p>&gt; those of you, who are interested in good old historical stuff on<br/>&gt; tuning and temperament<br/>&gt; might find some interesting new items on my website<br/><a href="http://ibo.ortgies.googlepages.com/">http://ibo.ortgies.googlepages.com/</a><br/>&gt; (these items being in German,<br/>&gt; however, and rather new, if 2004 is still new enough  I&apos;ll work on<br/>&gt; some minor updates probably later this year).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Quite a bit has to do with Buxtehude - aptly in the Buxtehude year<br/>&gt; 2007  and I am<br/>&gt; glad to be able to report that the temperament discussion around<br/>&gt; Buxtehude can be<br/>&gt; based on much new material and many new considerations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this respect I also would like to recommend  warmly Kerala Snyder&apos;s<br/>&gt; thoroughly and<br/>&gt; extensively updated edition of her ground breaking &quot;Dieterich<br/>&gt; Buxtehude.

I have seen these all, transcribed all<br/>organ and music related-stuff  (these transcriptions and others and<br/>also my collection of 5-6000 digital photos of archival material only<br/>from L&uuml;beck I gave to Kerala Snyder, and last year we worked together<br/>in the archive in L&uuml;beck to look at specific items. Much of all that<br/>is in her book - also one important to a ).</p><p>The account books were kept to prove the economy of the church, they<br/>were subject to supervision (and in the old Hanseatic towns like<br/>L&uuml;beck, you can bet on that they counted every penny), they were not<br/>organ building records. Anyhow, Buxtehude was much more specific in<br/>the account book entry than required and mentions many specifics of<br/>important work carried out on the two main organs (51/54 resp. 40 stops!).<br/>The frequent work on the tuning maintenance during his (and before<br/>Tunder&apos;s) tenure is also documented in the account books. However, the<br/>entries are all about maintenance of the (existing) tuning, while the<br/>few larger works on the organ show no special treatment of the<br/>temperament either.<br/>If the organ in L&uuml;beck would have been in a non-meantone temperament,<br/>even modified meantone,  totally unusually the region and time  this<br/>would have been bound to make for quite a sensation among the<br/>temperament obsessed authors of thee time and every author could be<br/>expected to have pointed his readers to it (&quot;There in L&uuml;beck, the<br/>organs played by the most famous organist, Herrn Dieterich Buxthehude,<br/>are in such a temperament similar to what I here propose. Go there, if<br/>you can and listen.&quot;).<br/>But, no:  Werckmeister, Mattheson, etc.   eager on promoting the new<br/>ideas, and knowing Buxtehude personally or being occasionally (seldom)<br/>in some form of contact with him, they all failed to mention that<br/>extraordinary fact? Not very likely.<br/>Werckmeister himself complained about the organ builders (and<br/>organists) not  accepting his suggestions  well-temperament was a<br/>completely new thought which didn&apos;t catch on in the practice.<br/>Other authors on temperament elsewhere in protestant (Lutheran)<br/>Germany also still much later complained about the slow introduction<br/>of non-meantone temperaments.</p><p>The church files on the organs itself for Buxtehude&apos;s time., the<br/>contracts, examination reportts etc. are not available (may be still<br/>in one of the ex-Soviet republics) or even not extant anymore.<br/>I have gone through numerous other such files, both from churches in<br/>L&uuml;beck and surrounding, from neighbouring or related towns Hamburg and<br/>many other places, both represented in original and secondary sources.<br/>None of the North German organ building contracts, whether for new<br/>built organs, rebuilts, enlargements, requires a specific temperament<br/>before ca. the middle of the 18th century and then only in a slowly<br/>increasing number.<br/>Only in the last third of the 18th century the contracts usually speak<br/>of the/a &quot;new temperament&quot; (or similar expressions) theen most often<br/>indicating Equal temperament (practically tuned, and according to<br/>skill and/or knowledge of the organ builder).<br/>The contracts until then did not need to specify the temperament,<br/>because there was an old standard (as for example Werckmeister<br/>grudgingly had to admit), quarter-comma meantone temperament.</p><p>Examination reports on the other hand were part of the revision of the<br/>enormous expenses any organ building meant for the church  this was<br/>what Werckmeister was aiming at and trying to put on a firm ground<br/>with the Orgel=Probe (1681, 2nd. ed. 1698) which was diirected to<br/>church elders and others who were responsible for spending money on<br/>organs. Werckmeister wnated to raise the quality of organ building, so<br/>that the churches were not &quot;betrayed&quot; by sloppy or even deceitful<br/>organ builders.<br/>In magnitude a new organ or a substantially enlargement or rebuilt was<br/>probably  somewhere beetween 5 and 20 times more expensive than today,<br/>mainly due to material costs, while labour was of course cheap.<br/>The examination reports were written after the thorough examination of<br/>an organ. For a large organ this could take 10 days or more (Today it<br/>is usually done in one afternoon - which doesn&apos;t help the overall<br/>quality of modern organ building).<br/>These examination reports often contain remarks about tuning. But<br/>again, until the 18th century the kind  of temperament is not<br/>mentioned (the conspicuous absence allows again the assumtion of the<br/>standard temperament, which everybody involved would know), while the<br/>reports can go to the level of describing single pipes&apos; tuning and<br/>voicing, i. e. problems which the organ builder then had to fix<br/>according to the contracts usually on his own costs.</p><p>Modifications of meantone temperaments, usually assumed by modern<br/>authors to have existed as kind of bridging a gap between meantone and<br/>an assumed early well-temperament period are only mentioned in (few)<br/>extraaordinary case(s), for example of<br/>1) that a sloppy organ builder had not correctly tuned and to prevent<br/>that the organ again would have been out of use for months one made a<br/>correction, so that the temperament became at least acceptable (and<br/>then we find occasionally in the records that it was tuned correctly<br/>some years later),  or<br/>2) that the organ was built in a pitch, which didn&apos;t fit to the<br/>instruments used with it (and one wonders that the local pitch was not<br/>checked in good time)  this happened to Frans Caspar Schnitger&apos;s<br/>organ in Zwolle/Netherlands (which the records indicate might have<br/>been tuned later again to the Dutch standard of temperament until the<br/>late 18th century, which was - little surprising - described in<br/>various sources as quarter-comma meantone).<br/>The available material from large and small cities shows that<br/>modifications were criticized, which allows a cautious conclusion that<br/>the more professional an organ builder was, the more exact he tried to<br/>tune the standard temperament.</p><p>There are very small number of unspecified temperament experiments<br/>known in Werckmeister&apos;s region between Northern and Central Germany,<br/>but these were either unsuccessful (the case of the not long-lasting<br/>organ built by Thayssner mentioned by W. himself in 1681 to have an<br/>unspecified well-tempered tuning), or were done a generation **after**<br/>his death. In the latter case the organs had to be retuned to standard<br/>meantone, because of arising pitch problems in playing with the local<br/>woodwind instruments.<br/>In any case these few examples were noted  in the contemporary<br/>literature, while there is not one report about non-standard<br/>temperaments from any of the prominent organ/organist&apos;s places in<br/>Northern Germany.</p><p>Interesting also is that Buxtehude tried to get Arp Schnitger for the<br/>renovation of the large organ in L&uuml;beck Marien.<br/>B. would have known that S&apos;s instruments were in meantone: B. played<br/>for example in 1687 S&apos;s newly built largest instrument in Hamburg,<br/>Nikolai, which we know was as all Hamburg organs until 1729/1731<br/>meantone tuned (without modification).

It seems to<br/>require two types of music. I will call them: &apos;playing-music&apos;, which<br/>is actually played, and de facto restricted to the notes that exist on<br/>the key- and pedal-boards, and has to be either composed or improvised<br/>to sound good in standard meantone; and &apos;study-music&apos;, which is not so<br/>restricted, neither to just the usual notes of the pedal-board nor to<br/>just the chord progressions that (by whatever criterion) sound good in<br/>meantone.</p><p>Then the question is, whether in writing or copying &apos;study-music&apos;, one<br/>learns something useful, even though the pedal parts and harmonies of<br/>the &apos;study-music&apos; would not be much use in performance.</p><p>To be more concrete: in playing one must be aware of the notes that<br/>are or not present on the pedalboard and adjust one&apos;s musical<br/>imagination to fit.
