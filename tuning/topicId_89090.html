(Airos^17 / 2^7) in favor of the fourths direction).<br/>For those who wish to give correct Persian names and symbols to these close-to-17 edo scales,<br/>they should of course refer to the very instructive article posted by Margo yesterday 10th of May 2010 on this list :<br/>Persian koron/sori notation and 17-note systems</p><p>For Ethno2 users, and if the user presets update has not arrived (I didn&apos;t check, and I encourage all of you to request it from MOTU), you would need to use the 24 tones mapping, this means repeating five of the notes, or adding five new ones (such as further extensions of the series, or also 13/8 transpositions, as suggested by the Airos algorithm).<br/>One can also reduce the scale to 17 notes by making a choice between the double notes.</p><p>In order to help the comprehension of these extensions from 12 to (17+2), I did not changed the 12 original tones positions and I defined the new tones by whole numbers in reference to the same whole numbers used for C = 1/1 and its octaves.<br/>It means that I used roundings, but with a high precision, that would not affect the -c or eq-b performances of the series.<br/>For those who would be willing to use further extensions of the series in the same way, this is the method I used :</p><p>First of all, know that I already tried all possible useful extensions in the Airos direction (cycle of fourfths of around 494.4315 c.) ;<br/>Extensions then should be done in the Soria direction (cycle of fifths of around 705.5685 c.), in which the series converges, but through whole numbers that need to be divided by 13^n, each time with increasing n.<br/>The Soria &quot;superpyth&quot;  recurrent algorithm is : 13H(i+3) = 16H(i+2) + 8H(i),<br/>or in resumed form 13x^3 = 16x^2 + 8.<br/>I will take an example with the first two additional tones of Soria17-b :<br/>The last terms of the series in the 12 notes version are<br/>1276 : 1918 : 2883<br/>The next one will be (16*2883 + 8*1276)/13 = 56336/13 ~4333.5385, which I rounded to 8667/2<br/>For the following ones I do not use the precedent roundings even if quite good, but the N / 13^n versions :<br/>The next one is then (16*56336/13 + 8* 1918)/13 = 1100848/169 ~6513.8935  which I rounded to 52111/8, and so on :<br/>39165/4<br/>29435/2<br/>44245/2<br/>33253<br/>99967/2</p><p>My personal impression is that with this new commas option the first series (a) is acceptable, has lots of character but also some irregularities, such as the semifourths in end of cycle for the low versions of Eb and Bb, which can also be seen as tasteful variations.<br/>The second series (b) has much less deviations, a more smooth and uniform musicality, and would be the one I would advise perhaps to start with in order to explore the more general possibilities of this 17+n system.</p><p>! soria17_plus2a.scl<br/>!<br/>12 from a 17-notes cycle, equal-beating extended fifths (705.5685 c.) sequence<br/> 19<br/>!<br/> 236211/227840<br/> 481/445<br/> 4011/3560<br/> 2067/1780<br/> 8339/7120<br/> 278213/227840<br/> 1133/890<br/> 9503/7120<br/> 19643/14240<br/> 128/89<br/> 533/356<br/> 22191/14240<br/> 723/445<br/> 754/445<br/> 1233/712<br/> 24889/14240<br/> 3267/1780<br/> 1703/890<br/> 2/1<br/>!
