Since it is poly students, can<br/>experience nice Just pure frequency chords.<br/>In addition we are almost completely finished with THe Lambdomic<br/>Frequency midi controller with a matrix of 16 by 12 for the proto which<br/>should be in D. Genovese (of the WHP) hand in about two months so you<br/>fellas in California will be able to experience the mastery of Tuning<br/>and Technology of the SEIJC and the WHP on the west coast as well<br/>Love and Tets<br/>Patrick Pagano, Director<br/>South East Just Intonation Society</p></div>
