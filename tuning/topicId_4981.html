The 12-Tone Plus system<br/>lets the player retain the tuning system he is used to, but also gives him<br/>the option to play pure notes derived directly from the Harmonic Series.&quot;</p><p>About this here buy 12 frets, get 7 free Guitar, could you tell me something<br/>about those 7 frets ?</p><p>BTW, am I the only one who didn&apos;t know about the pseudo-commercial<br/>availability of microtonal guitars and from G&amp;L no less ?</p><p>- Drew</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=5088 href="#5088">ðŸ”—</a>Glen Peterson &#x3C;Glen@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/26/1999 8:02:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;    From: &quot;Drew Skyfyre&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:drew_skyfyre@yahoo.com">drew_skyfyre@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: G&amp;L 12-Tone Plus Guitar<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey Glen,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m assuming it&apos;s u who is the luthier that does the work on these<br/>&gt; instruments, but if I&apos;m wrong, atleast u did do one for John Catler.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~freenote/gtr01.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~freenote/gtr01.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; About this here buy 12 frets, get 7 free Guitar, could you<br/>&gt; tell me something<br/>&gt; about those 7 frets ?</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s me.  The extra frets give you flat dominant 7ths and a few other<br/>ratios of 7 that sound very nice.  You should really ask Catler for all the<br/>details.  I handle the saws and files, he designed the fret layout.  Also,<br/>there&apos;s a picture of a neck on my site.  (See link in my signature)</p><p>I just finished 2 G&amp;L necks with JI frets.  One for Catler, and one for<br/>David Beardsley.  Really tough stuff.  There were over 60 frets, some going<br/>under only one or two strings, others bent to stop different strings at<br/>different places.  I&apos;ll have pictures on my site in about a week.</p><p>Allright, I cannot resist a bit of shameless self promotion: If you are<br/>thinking about commissioning an instrument, or having one modified, please<br/>consider me.  I am just finishing a bunch of orders this week so my schedule<br/>should be freeing up for more.</p><p>---<br/>Glen Peterson<br/>30 Elm Street North Andover, MA 01845<br/>(978) 975-1527<br/><a href="http://www.OrganicDesign.org/Glen/Instruments">http://www.OrganicDesign.org/Glen/Instruments</a></p></div>
