That&apos;s five<br/>digests a day, with up to 25 posts per digest... well over a thousand<br/>messages. Even with not reading what didn&apos;t interest me, and skimming over<br/>the flames, it took the better part of Memorial Day Monday to catch up. It&apos;s<br/>a great list, but there&apos;s not enough time in my day to read it, teach,<br/>practice and, most importantly, compose... So it&apos;s bye for now, I&apos;ll<br/>resubscribe somewhere in the future, and post some links when I get some<br/>fretless acoustic guitar mp3s happening. Thanks for all the advice.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a><br/><a href="mailto:klezmusic@earthlink.net">klezmusic@earthlink.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=23944 href="#23944">ðŸ”—</a>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>5/29/2001 12:43:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>List at large:</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Seth Austen &lt;klezmusic@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a great list, but there&apos;s not enough time in my day to read<br/>&gt; it, teach, practice and, most importantly, compose...
