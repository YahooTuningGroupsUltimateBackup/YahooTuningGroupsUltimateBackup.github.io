Learning it is a lifelong process, and has little to do with<br/>scales. After I show a student the blues scale, I tell them that blues<br/>has zero to do with this array of notes, and is more like learning a<br/>language (like Japanese)...then, I play a few rather complex blues<br/>phrases to make the point real. Of course, people need something to<br/>play, so scales/arpeggios and etc. must be shown to folks to get them<br/>rolling. Any blues/jazz musician is automatically a composer/arranger as<br/>well, since no one can tell you what to play in blues, or when to play<br/>it...it&apos;s all up to you...that&apos;s why it&apos;s so difficult to teach.<br/>    And again, as far as &quot;the&quot; blues scale, as soon as one starts<br/>bending strings, the scale is only a springboard for the deep and subtle<br/>microtonal expressions which are possible (of course,<br/>sax/trumpets/trombones etc. bend notes too, not to mention vocalists,<br/>which are the true source of blues in the first place). If there ever<br/>was an art form which was &quot;non intellectual,&quot; it&apos;s blues. But, again,<br/>Parker style blues is really really intricate, and can involve<br/>incredible varieties of altered chords and chromaticism. In BB King&apos;s<br/>autobiography, he says that Parker&apos;s music was just as deep as Muddy<br/>Waters...I agree.<br/>    I really enjoy playing 19 tone blues, because it affords me a chance<br/>to stretch the form, but in a very evolutionary way. The blues seems to<br/>be very stagnant now (as most art is at this time), with Hendrix being<br/>the last innovator. Michael Hill (in New York) is very creative, but is<br/>having a hard time being accepted because he doesn&apos;t sound like he&apos;s<br/>&quot;supposed&quot; to...which is a great thing, artistically, but not so good in<br/>a society that values imitation over originality. I had a friend in<br/>Dallas tell me that if you didn&apos;t play a Strat (in Dallas), folks didn&apos;t<br/>think you were a blues player...while oversimplified, there&apos;s a valid<br/>point there. From what I hear and see lately, the blues is about<br/>sounding like folks &quot;used&quot; to sound, and dressing like a bluesman is<br/>&quot;supposed&quot; to look...little progress has been made in this vital form of<br/>music in many years...that&apos;s too bad...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=2828 href="#2828">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Thanks for sharing them! I obviously agree,<br/>as implied by my response to Paul at one point, that you can go too<br/>far in trying to rationalize every such melodic inflection in terms<br/>of JI no matter what primes you make available to your analysis.</p><p>On the other hand, I also believe that the most musical of blues<br/>singers do have a common intonational BASIS for their microtonal<br/>departures from conventional western tonalities. The operative word<br/>here is BASIS. This does NOT imply to me, therefore, that we must<br/>attempt to explain every little melodic nuance harmonically in terms<br/>of JI or anything else other that what it simply is melodically.</p><p>I also feel an implication in your musings here that you feel that<br/>there must be some kind of underlying, intuitive tuning into<br/>correspondences between feeling and pitch inflections that are not<br/>completely arbitrary...that there might be some deep basis in the<br/>feeling and pitch interface structure that these singers are tapping<br/>into.</p><p>I find that kind of thinking fascinating in the light of the Indian<br/>philosophy of  ragas regarding a correspondence in some absolute<br/>sense between specific melodic &quot;infrastructures&quot; (ragas) and moods or<br/>times of the day. Teh principle is the same, I would think, namely<br/>that specific types and movements in pitch inflections can invoke<br/>certain universally reliable reactions in terms of feeling or emotion<br/>in musically sensitive listeners.</p><p>This is pretty deep stuff and hard to substantiate, but I feel that<br/>this is not completely frivolous or futile territory for musical<br/>exploration. Bach was heavily into a kind of analogous thinking in<br/>terms of musical structure in general (not microtonal inflections so<br/>much, accept as Werckmeister or whatever might imply that as well).</p><p>Mainstream musicology tends to scoff at this and the Indian philospy,<br/>too, as superstitious or at the very least, quaintly mystical<br/>thinking, but I think the western scientific paradigm is much more<br/>limiting in its perception of reality than it thinks it is.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;    I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m even looking for an answer here, but I&apos;ve always<br/>&gt; wondered: how DO those blues guys know to play all those microtonal<br/>&gt; intervals, when they most likely never, ever think about exactly<br/>what<br/>&gt; they&apos;re doing, and I&apos;m positive that they never sat down and worked<br/>out<br/>&gt; a system of just where to bend a string, for example, or how to hit<br/>just<br/>&gt; the right note with their voices, which much of the time, falls<br/>outside<br/>&gt; of the 12 eq scale, and most likely falls outside of ANY fixed<br/>scales?<br/>&gt; Do certain ratios, or, more accurately, points on a musical pitch<br/>&gt; continuum, correspond to certain feelings, emotions?
