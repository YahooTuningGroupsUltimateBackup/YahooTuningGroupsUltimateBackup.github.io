But here&apos;s Kraig&apos;s original statement...</p><p>[Grady]<br/>&gt;The term is applied to  &quot;variations&quot; of an MOS where each interval is<br/>&gt;allowed to vary in size but the overall chain remains the same.</p><p>So you can see where I was coming from when I said...</p><p>[Lumma]<br/>&gt;Paul, perhaps there is still confusion on what CS means.  From Kraig&apos;s most<br/>&gt;recent post, I took it to refer to MOS&apos;s that don&apos;t change as the generator<br/>&gt;size does, ie all 2-tone chains are MOS, the 7-tone chain of fifths is a CS<br/>&gt;of the 12, 19, and 31 tone chains of fifths...</p><p>Which led you to say...</p><p>[Erlich]<br/>&gt;However, the concept you mistakenly took CS to mean is interesting. Can<br/>you &gt;explain further?</p><p>Not much.  As you know from XH3, Wilson is interested in what the mapping<br/>of harmony to the linear series means in music.  He told me that he wants<br/>to compose music in which the scale&apos;s mapping to the linear series is held<br/>constant, but the size of the generator changes, so that the mapping of the<br/>harmonies move over the scale degrees as the music evolves.  He believes<br/>this sort of thing is at work in free-pitched ensemble performance, and, on<br/>a larger scale, in the evolution of musical languages.  I believe Marcus<br/>Hobbs has tried, or will soon try, to do demos of this with Kyma.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=5186 href="#5186">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/1999 10:02:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl!<br/>    there is no direct mention of constant structures in the Archives, only<br/>some scales that fit.
