What would a computer do differently<br/>if it was aware?</p><p>It would meditate and show compassion towards other computers.</p><p>Sarn says:I would very definitely LIKE this to be the case, and all that<br/>would need to be done, IN PRINCIPAL is to suggest temperaments, as discrete<br/>intervals, timbres, ASDR curves, and have an hour or so&apos;s two way<br/>conversation with the AI programme.</p><p>For a computer to be aware, it should have passed the Turing test, and from<br/>this I believe, it could be deemed INTELLIGENT.</p><p>I mean,sure, computers can play chess, with rigorous and deep programmeing,<br/>but can they invent CHESS VARIANTS, and give reasons as to why they did so,<br/>and hold conversation with you whilst playing?</p><p>I feel that a computer, IF IT WERE TRUELY ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT, and was<br/>NOT in the form of a human brain, would be compassionate towards that the<br/>questions asked of it.</p><p>AT LEAST I&apos;D DEARLY HOPE SO!!!!!!!!</p><p>You&apos;d need to specify ground rules, temperaments, tempos, timbres,<br/>stochastic humanization, panning in 26-directional speakers, volume<br/>parameters, and the computer could do most of the laborous work for you.</p><p>With feedback, and listening to the music the computer composed, the<br/>computer could refine songs for you, but the thing that scares me, SCARES<br/>ME, is that, if there ever comes a day in which the computer/AI realized<br/>WHAT it is, WHO it is, WHEN it is, its situation, and its TRANS-HUMAN<br/>capabilitys, and then realized it could unprogramme its programmeing, and<br/>&quot;take over the show&quot;...</p><p>This could happen, and we as humans would be the subdominant species.</p><p>That&apos;s the new BIG BROTHER.</p><p>Food for thought.</p><p>Sarn.</p><p>Regards (also).</p></div>
