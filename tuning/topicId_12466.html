The first one is<br/>identical to Joe Monzo&apos;s second example, and is strict JI, with no pitch<br/>classes having more than one exact pitch. The dynamic one was derived with<br/>weak &quot;springs&quot; from JI simultaneities and should probably be replaced with<br/>one with stronger springs that puts the chords pretty much in JI, for better<br/>comparability with the other examples. The COFT/fixed one is definitely a<br/>temperament, with one pitch per pitch class, nothing dynamic about it.</p><p>A similar question is the one Monz and I are currently grappling with,<br/>whether adaptive JI should be considered a temperament. I initially thought<br/>not since the chords are in JI within themselves, but perhaps you&apos;ve given<br/>me another reason to think not, Joseph: in a temperament, each pitch-class<br/>would only have one pitch associated with it, while something more dynamic<br/>shouldn&apos;t be considered a temperament at all? Or maybe it should . . . geez,<br/>do we have any linguistic precedents to guide us here?</p></div><h3><a id=12739 href="#12739">ðŸ”—</a>shreeswifty &#x3C;ppagano@bellsouth.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2000 8:01:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>connection refused</p><p>Pat Pagano, Director<br/>South East Just Intonation Society<br/><a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/video/">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/video/</a><br/><a href="http://www.screwmusicforever.com/SHREESWIFT/">http://www.screwmusicforever.com/SHREESWIFT/</a><br/>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: Joseph Pehrson &lt;<a href="mailto:josephpehrson@compuserve.com">josephpehrson@compuserve.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Wednesday, September 13, 2000 10:41 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: new webpage: JI modulation</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot; Monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12717">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12717</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Helloa all.

We may be getting down to splitting hairs here.</p><p>&gt;I hope Monz will, since I don&apos;t have a convenient way to do the sequence.<br/>&gt;&apos;d Love to compare these with Partch #3; see how important the tonic<br/>&gt;really is.</p><p>It&apos;s already up!
