Aaron Johnson took one of the first 48 and made<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; music with it. Anyway, 32 7-limit consonances is quite a few (8?)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; more than you could get if you restricted yourself to a prime<br/>&gt; limit<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; of 5 -- though in the latter case, all the 7-limit consonances<br/>&gt; would<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; also be 5-limit consonances.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yes, I see no reason not to leave the prime limit completely open.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not<br/>&gt;&gt; sure why you even bring up prime limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You brought up the Duodene (stricly 5-prime-limit) in this<br/>&gt; discussion, so it seemed pertinent . . .</p><p>Ah, yes, but I brought it up as something to improve upon if possible.</p><p>&gt; Also, the &quot;harmonic entropy<br/>&gt; minimizer&quot; only models dyadic consonance, so it might miss out on<br/>&gt; some of the higher-odd-limit (and thus, often, higher-prime-limit)<br/>&gt; intervals that become important in large otonal chords.</p><p>Yes, we definitely have to work on that.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Except it remains an unknown to me what it takes to create what I<br/>&gt; might call<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;otonal clarify&quot; meaning (tentatively) the degree to which a single<br/>&gt; or a<br/>&gt;&gt; very small number (like 2) of implied fundamentals are clearly<br/>&gt; present.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Out of all the note-combinations possible in the scale?</p><p>In my sentence above when refer to 2 implied fundamentals I was talking<br/>about a single chord.  Applying this to my original goal would mean I would<br/>like to see that achieved in a lot of different keys, with hopefully a<br/>choice of several chords achieving that in most keys.</p><p>&gt; Then maybe<br/>&gt; it&apos;s a very different type of scale you&apos;re looking for . . . though<br/>&gt; the Duodene is certainly capable of at least 3 clear implied<br/>&gt; fundamentals . . .</p><p>It has 6 pure major triads.  Seems to me a pure major triad is sufficient to<br/>have a clear implied fundamental though perhaps it gets clearer when a good<br/>4:7 approximation is available, and Duodene has a 4:5:6:7 approximation in<br/>two keys, with the 7 being around 7 cents off, but it is still adequate to<br/>reinforce the implied fundamental.  This is a good example chord with which<br/>to look at a generalized consonance function (adequate for 4 notes in this<br/>case).  Compare what you get with the 4:5:6 pure and the 7 approximated to<br/>what you get when you temper Duodene in some tentative way to optimize all<br/>2:3, 4:5, 5:6, 4:7, 5:7, and 6:7 occurrences within the scale.  Or pick a<br/>different list if you have a better idea.  Does the result do better with<br/>the 4:5:6 exact and the 7 off or does it do better with an RMS optimization<br/>across a list of dyads or does it do better with an equal-beating or<br/>exact-multiple-beating solution?  By &quot;do better&quot; I clearly mean in listening<br/>tests here.</p><p>&gt;&gt; But<br/>&gt;&gt; my guess is that this still relates more to the odd limit than to<br/>&gt; the prime<br/>&gt;&gt; limit, which in its unboundedness seems to have no predictive value<br/>&gt; at all<br/>&gt;&gt; in relation to consonance, clarity, justness, whatever.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; True . . . however, it&apos;s often easier to solve these problems if<br/>&gt; you&apos;re *given* a prime limit first . . .</p><p>Ah, I see.  And if no prime limit is relevant then you would just run at the<br/>highest prime-limit that your computer and algorithm can handle, right?</p><p>&gt;&gt; It would be good to have a better handle on something that relates<br/>&gt; to this<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;otonal clarify&quot; in order to have a practical sense of how audible<br/>&gt;&gt; consonance is generated in a chord.

Aaron Johnson took one of the first 48 and made<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; music with it. Anyway, 32 7-limit consonances is quite a few<br/>(8?)<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; more than you could get if you restricted yourself to a prime<br/>&gt; &gt; limit<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of 5 -- though in the latter case, all the 7-limit consonances<br/>&gt; &gt; would<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; also be 5-limit consonances.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, I see no reason not to leave the prime limit completely<br/>open.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; sure why you even bring up prime limit.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You brought up the Duodene (stricly 5-prime-limit) in this<br/>&gt; &gt; discussion, so it seemed pertinent . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, yes, but I brought it up as something to improve upon if<br/>&gt;possible.</p><p>Maybe the pointy consonance function gives us one way to immediately<br/>address this, without forcing us to leave the strict-JI realm.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Except it remains an unknown to me what it takes to create what I<br/>&gt; &gt; might call<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;otonal clarify&quot; meaning (tentatively) the degree to which a<br/>single<br/>&gt; &gt; or a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; very small number (like 2) of implied fundamentals are clearly<br/>&gt; &gt; present.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Out of all the note-combinations possible in the scale?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my sentence above when refer to 2 implied fundamentals I was<br/>talking<br/>&gt; about a single chord.  Applying this to my original goal would mean<br/>I would<br/>&gt; like to see that achieved in a lot of different keys, with<br/>hopefully a<br/>&gt; choice of several chords achieving that in most keys.</p><p>Phew! So there are three levels: chord, key, and scale? Sounds<br/>complicated. How do you define key? Presumably using some sort of sub-<br/>scale . . . ??</p><p>&gt; &gt; Then maybe<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s a very different type of scale you&apos;re looking for . . .<br/>though<br/>&gt; &gt; the Duodene is certainly capable of at least 3 clear implied<br/>&gt; &gt; fundamentals . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It has 6 pure major triads.</p><p>Whoops, yes I meant at least 6 . . .</p><p>&gt; Seems to me a pure major triad is sufficient to<br/>&gt; have a clear implied fundamental though perhaps it gets clearer<br/>when a good<br/>&gt; 4:7 approximation is available, and Duodene has a 4:5:6:7<br/>approximation in<br/>&gt; two keys,</p><p>In two keys? Perhaps you really just meant &quot;positions&quot;<br/>or &quot;transpositions&quot;, not &quot;keys&quot;? But if so, what would your remark<br/>above -- &quot;with hopefully a choice of several chords achieving that in<br/>most keys&quot; -- mean? Did you really just mean &quot;on most possible<br/>roots/tonics&quot;?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; But<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; my guess is that this still relates more to the odd limit than to<br/>&gt; &gt; the prime<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; limit, which in its unboundedness seems to have no predictive<br/>value<br/>&gt; &gt; at all<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; in relation to consonance, clarity, justness, whatever.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; True . . . however, it&apos;s often easier to solve these problems if<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;re *given* a prime limit first . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, I see.  And if no prime limit is relevant then you would just<br/>run at the<br/>&gt; highest prime-limit that your computer and algorithm can handle,<br/>right?</p><p>Hopefully there&apos;s be no limitation there -- instead I was thinking<br/>that if you wanted to construct a scale out of pure JI consonances,<br/>and had a list of them, then the highest prime found in the list<br/>would be the best choice for a prime limit in which to address the<br/>problem. Clearly you won&apos;t be generating any higher primes by<br/>combining intervals in your list, so you might as well cap the<br/>dimensionality of the problem using the number of primes present (and<br/>thus, the number that could possibly arise).</p><p>&gt; &gt; So you&apos;re asking about chords?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I&apos;m not inclined to simply project dyad results into a chord<br/>scenario.<br/>&gt; I believe something else is going on.  Thoughts about neural<br/>responses<br/>&gt; reinforce that intuition.</p><p>Sure, but one can do a lot with the false assumption that the dyad<br/>results are everything. All of Sethares&apos;s work is founded on this<br/>assumption, and would never see the difference between a 4:5:6:7 and<br/>1/(7:6:5:4) chord. Clearly, these assumptions are flawed, but they<br/>led to some nice music and a theoretical treatise that seems to have<br/>a large number of people convinced (whatever that&apos;s worth).</p><p>&gt; &gt; When comparing simple otonal JI ones,<br/>&gt; &gt; I find the size of the numbers works great.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t follow what you mean here.</p><p>Aside from dyad and triad considerations, which usually appear less<br/>important anyway, a:b:c:d will generally be more &apos;concordant&apos; than<br/>e:f:g:h if a*b*c*d &lt; e*f*g*h, and all eight of these are quite small<br/>integers.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But you rapidly reach the<br/>&gt; &gt; limit of usefulness with that formula, particularly where tempered<br/>&gt; &gt; chords are concerned.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Triadic and tetradic harmonic entropy (which would address this<br/>&gt; &gt; directly) are things I am working on on the harmonic entropy list,<br/>&gt; &gt; and the former is well-studied in part . . . I guess my work<br/>there is<br/>&gt; &gt; halted for now since no one else wanted to get involved in the<br/>&gt; &gt; calculations . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I just refreshed myself briefly on H.E. and realize this is<br/>probably<br/>&gt; very in line with my own intuition, even moreso based on what I<br/>perused this<br/>&gt; time than what I had seen before.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My first inclination might be to use some specific timbres and do<br/>some<br/>&gt; nonlinear things with them in order to hopefully discover something<br/>&gt; predictive, something perhaps involving how beating signal<br/>movements cross<br/>&gt; each other.  My impression is you are starting with a simpler<br/>distillation<br/>&gt; to see what it predicts well.  But I still haven&apos;t read enough.  Is<br/>the best<br/>&gt; resource the H.E. list archives?  Or the tuning dictionary excerpts?</p><p>The former.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; As far as appropriateness of the above material for this list,<br/>I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; not sure<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; whether it is on the one hand &quot;too newbie/nieve&quot; to interest most<br/>&gt; &gt; people or<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;too theoretical&quot; and belonging on that basis more on tuning<br/>math.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s right in line with the harmonic entropy list too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How is the volume on that list?</p><p>Very slow.

This is<br/>&gt; because distrubuting an error among several intervals will look<br/>&gt; better than leaving it concentrated in one interval when the minima<br/>&gt; are quadratic (as in the &quot;smooth&quot; case), but worse when the minima<br/>&gt; are abs-exponential (as in the &quot;pointy&quot; case).</p><p>So I still need to look at a smooth one.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I had to think more about prime factorization to figure that out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ve lost you. To figure what out?</p><p>I sort of explained this above.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; You brought up the Duodene (stricly 5-prime-limit) in this<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; discussion, so it seemed pertinent . . .<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Ah, yes, but I brought it up as something to improve upon if<br/>&gt;&gt; possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe the pointy consonance function gives us one way to immediately<br/>&gt; address this, without forcing us to leave the strict-JI realm.</p><p>Aha.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Except it remains an unknown to me what it takes to create what I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; might call<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;otonal clarify&quot; meaning (tentatively) the degree to which a<br/>&gt; single<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; or a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very small number (like 2) of implied fundamentals are clearly<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; present.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Out of all the note-combinations possible in the scale?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; In my sentence above when refer to 2 implied fundamentals I was<br/>&gt; talking<br/>&gt;&gt; about a single chord.  Applying this to my original goal would mean<br/>&gt; I would<br/>&gt;&gt; like to see that achieved in a lot of different keys, with<br/>&gt; hopefully a<br/>&gt;&gt; choice of several chords achieving that in most keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Phew! So there are three levels: chord, key, and scale? Sounds<br/>&gt; complicated. How do you define key? Presumably using some sort of sub-<br/>&gt; scale . . . ??</p><p>Its probably some sort of minimax thing.  I didn&apos;t work it all out and if it<br/>isn&apos;t intuitive then I will need to do that.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Seems to me a pure major triad is sufficient to<br/>&gt;&gt; have a clear implied fundamental though perhaps it gets clearer<br/>&gt; when a good<br/>&gt;&gt; 4:7 approximation is available, and Duodene has a 4:5:6:7<br/>&gt; approximation in<br/>&gt;&gt; two keys,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In two keys? Perhaps you really just meant &quot;positions&quot;<br/>&gt; or &quot;transpositions&quot;, not &quot;keys&quot;?</p><p>I meant the 128:225 appears twice in any fixed tuning of the scale.  The<br/>225:224-based approximations of the following 7-limit ratios occur as<br/>follows:</p><p>    9:7 (actually  16: 25) appears 4 times<br/>    6:7 (actually  32: 75) appears 3 times<br/>    4:7 (actually 128:225) appears 2 times</p><p>I&apos;m sure you know that so this must be just some language thing.  To me I<br/>use a fixed Duodene tuning in various &quot;keys&quot;.  I thought that was normal<br/>lingo.</p><p>&gt; But if so, what would your remark<br/>&gt; above -- &quot;with hopefully a choice of several chords achieving that in<br/>&gt; most keys&quot; -- mean? Did you really just mean &quot;on most possible<br/>&gt; roots/tonics&quot;?</p><p>Yes, exactly.  I&apos;d settle for &quot;most&quot; if I couldn&apos;t get &quot;all&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ah, I see.  And if no prime limit is relevant then you would just<br/>&gt; run at the<br/>&gt;&gt; highest prime-limit that your computer and algorithm can handle,<br/>&gt; right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hopefully there&apos;s be no limitation there -- instead I was thinking<br/>&gt; that if you wanted to construct a scale out of pure JI consonances,<br/>&gt; and had a list of them, then the highest prime found in the list<br/>&gt; would be the best choice for a prime limit in which to address the<br/>&gt; problem. Clearly you won&apos;t be generating any higher primes by<br/>&gt; combining intervals in your list, so you might as well cap the<br/>&gt; dimensionality of the problem using the number of primes present (and<br/>&gt; thus, the number that could possibly arise).</p><p>Right, I get it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; So you&apos;re asking about chords?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yes, I&apos;m not inclined to simply project dyad results into a chord<br/>&gt; scenario.<br/>&gt;&gt; I believe something else is going on.  Thoughts about neural<br/>&gt; responses<br/>&gt;&gt; reinforce that intuition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure, but one can do a lot with the false assumption that the dyad<br/>&gt; results are everything. All of Sethares&apos;s work is founded on this<br/>&gt; assumption, and would never see the difference between a 4:5:6:7 and<br/>&gt; 1/(7:6:5:4) chord. Clearly, these assumptions are flawed, but they<br/>&gt; led to some nice music and a theoretical treatise that seems to have<br/>&gt; a large number of people convinced (whatever that&apos;s worth).</p><p>Sure.  I&apos;m planning on trying to make my own dynamic retuning capable of<br/>utonal/otonal in-place reciprocal modulations so that I can really get some<br/>experience of the utonal/otonal difference.  I&apos;m laying some of the<br/>groundwork for this in my software by more fully implementing Carl&apos;s XMW<br/>ideas, as they have fleshed themselves out in the context of my organ<br/>softsynth.  Then a direct u/o modulation should be possible as a new option,<br/>based on (tenatively) keeping the highest and lowest playing notes fixed.<br/>I&apos;m looking forward to hearing this so I can really come to know the<br/>difference!</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; When comparing simple otonal JI ones,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I find the size of the numbers works great.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I can&apos;t follow what you mean here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aside from dyad and triad considerations, which usually appear less<br/>&gt; important anyway, a:b:c:d will generally be more &apos;concordant&apos; than<br/>&gt; e:f:g:h if a*b*c*d &lt; e*f*g*h, and all eight of these are quite small<br/>&gt; integers.</p><p>Ah, good.  Yes, I remember that now.  Just couldn&apos;t get it from your earlier<br/>words.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; But you rapidly reach the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; limit of usefulness with that formula, particularly where tempered<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; chords are concerned.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Triadic and tetradic harmonic entropy (which would address this<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; directly) are things I am working on on the harmonic entropy list,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; and the former is well-studied in part . . . I guess my work<br/>&gt; there is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; halted for now since no one else wanted to get involved in the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; calculations . . .<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yes, I just refreshed myself briefly on H.E. and realize this is<br/>&gt; probably<br/>&gt;&gt; very in line with my own intuition, even moreso based on what I<br/>&gt; perused this<br/>&gt;&gt; time than what I had seen before.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; My first inclination might be to use some specific timbres and do<br/>&gt; some<br/>&gt;&gt; nonlinear things with them in order to hopefully discover something<br/>&gt;&gt; predictive, something perhaps involving how beating signal<br/>&gt; movements cross<br/>&gt;&gt; each other.  My impression is you are starting with a simpler<br/>&gt; distillation<br/>&gt;&gt; to see what it predicts well.  But I still haven&apos;t read enough.  Is<br/>&gt; the best<br/>&gt;&gt; resource the H.E. list archives?  Or the tuning dictionary excerpts?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The former.</p><p>You mean *not* a simpler distillation?  But are you assuming some actual<br/>timbres?</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as appropriateness of the above material for this list,<br/>&gt; I&apos;m<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; not sure<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whether it is on the one hand &quot;too newbie/nieve&quot; to interest most<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; people or<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;too theoretical&quot; and belonging on that basis more on tuning<br/>&gt; math.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; It&apos;s right in line with the harmonic entropy list too.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; How is the volume on that list?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Very slow. But I feel moving this discussion there or to the tuning-<br/>&gt; math list would be most appropriate now, though any non-technical sub-<br/>&gt; discussions could remain here, of course.</p><p>Well I had to just join to see your pictures.
