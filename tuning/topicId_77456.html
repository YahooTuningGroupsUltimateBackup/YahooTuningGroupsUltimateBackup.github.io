But, if you take that same chord and you put it<br/>into 18-tet, the beating suddenly cancels out. Here&apos;s a cent-by-cent<br/>comparison:</p><p>12-tet: 0-400-700-1000<br/>18-tet: 0-400-733-1000</p><p>For some reason that I can&apos;t figure out, bringing that fifth up to 733<br/>suddenly makes it incredibly resonant with little to no beating. It&apos;s<br/>an incredibly rich sound. I suppose that doing it in 36-tet might work<br/>out nicely as well. But why is this? Is this the &quot;even beating&quot; that<br/>you guys were referring to with the metastable intervals? I can&apos;t<br/>figure out why this is happening. The best explanation that I can come<br/>up with is that the 1000, which is pretty close to a metastable<br/>interval, has a 266-cent interval directly under it in the 18-tet<br/>version, which is pretty close to 6:7. Putting a 5:6 under that 1000<br/>doesn&apos;t sound so great either. So with the 6:7 sort of utonal<br/>structure under the metastable interval would then introduce a<br/>difference tone which would be as far away from the root of the chord<br/>as the metastable interval itself would be from 7/4, which not only<br/>makes the chord sound less &quot;warbly&quot; than the usual chords with<br/>metastable intervals, but still &quot;crunchy.&quot; Or something.</p><p>Actually, I just did some more listening tests that disproved my own<br/>theory here. Changing that 400 to a nice 386 makes it beat more,<br/>however, moving that 400 UP to around 417 or so so that there&apos;s a 5:6<br/>and a 6:7 under the metastable 1000 ALSO makes it beat more. So could<br/>it be that the 400 is itself a metastable interval between the 4:5<br/>over the root and a 5:6 under the 6:7 under the metastable 1000? It&apos;s<br/>like a shadow of a shadow&apos;s shadow here.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what the best way to describe chords in metastable<br/>intonation, so I&apos;m for now just going to use just notation with<br/>decimals.</p><p>4:5:6:7.136 is the standard metastable dominant 7 chord with the<br/>dominant 7 around 1002 cents. That 7.136 is (7 + 9*phi)/(4 + 5*phi)<br/>4:5:6.117:7.136 is the standard metastable dominant 7 chord with that<br/>reinforced 6:7 under it. Note there is still beating with this one,<br/>but it&apos;s much less.<br/>4:5.097:6.117:7.136 is the metastable dominant 7 chord with a 5:6:7<br/>under it. Still beating. I&apos;m not sure how to exactly calculate some<br/>sort of equivalent to a metastable interval between the numbers here,<br/>since we&apos;re no longer dealing with rational numbers but rather with<br/>some sort of metastable interval between another metastable interval<br/>and a just interval, but from listening tests, the chord with the<br/>least beating is somewhere around here:<br/>4:5.05:6.117:7.136</p><p>Furthermore, tweaking it even more, by changing the third note and<br/>making it slightly flatter than the 6:7, this chord here:</p><p>4:5.05:6.102:7.136</p><p>has even less beating. AND, to be even weirder, if you flatten the<br/>metastable 7th by under 3 cents</p><p>4:5.05:6.102:7.125</p><p>There&apos;s a LOT less beating. If you raise it up by one cent to<br/>4:5.05:6.102:7.143, there&apos;s a lot more beating. So it seems Kraig was<br/>right about the precision issue.</p><p>I&apos;m sure if I sat and tweaked with this for another 3 hours I&apos;d be<br/>able to find some version that has no beating at all or something, as<br/>everything would cancel out, but it would help if there were some<br/>mathematical way to figure out what&apos;s going on here first.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=77458 href="#77458">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2008 4:50:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Just did some more listening - if you listen closely, by changing that<br/>7 around very very slightly, you will find different points of<br/>resonance only a few cents away from each other where the beats line<br/>up perfectly. I imagine it has something to do with the beat<br/>frequencies from one tone cancelling out the beat frequencies of<br/>another tone, but how that&apos;s even possible I&apos;m not sure. Or it also<br/>sounds like it might be that the difference tones somehow align here<br/>in some sort of way. Either way, it seems like if there&apos;s an actual<br/>technique and a concept behind this, then we could develop a way to<br/>somehow build chords other than just that have no beating if the<br/>precision is high enough. Alternately I could be way off the mark<br/>here.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=77460 href="#77460">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2008 5:21:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I figured it out.</p><p>4.000:5.045:6.091:7.136</p><p>is the magic chord.</p><p>Mathematically it&apos;s the equivalent of a 4:5:6:7 chord in which every<br/>note is stretched, basically, so it might have nothing to do with<br/>metastable intervals at all. Here&apos;s how I calculated it:</p><p>7.136 - 4 = 3.136 to find the difference between the first and last note<br/>3.136 / 3 = 1.0453333 to find the average spacing between notes<br/>4 + 1.0453 = 5.0453 + 1.0453 = 6.097 + 1.0453 = 7.136</p><p>I&apos;m falling asleep here so I hope my explanation makes sense. So now,<br/>compare these three chords:</p><p>4:5:6:7.136<br/>4:5:6.091:7.136<br/>4:5.045:6.091:7.136</p><p>And use a simple sine wave kind of sound. You&apos;ll see what I mean when<br/>you get to the last chord. What&apos;s happening is that the difference<br/>tones, although not harmonic in and of themselves, still reinforce.<br/>What&apos;s interesting to me here is how much can you stretch a chord<br/>before it starts to sound like another chord? Perhaps we&apos;ll start<br/>seeing metastable chords next.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=77461 href="#77461">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2008 5:23:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gah, my post got cut off. Here was the last paragraph:</p><p>And, furthermore, this last chord:</p><p>4:5.045:6.091:7.136</p><p>sounds completely different and yet equally in tune with 4:5:6:7<br/>(provided the right timbre is used). So perhaps when we create chords<br/>with metastable intervals, we can use this technique to make them<br/>sound just as &quot;in tune&quot; as just intervals.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=77462 href="#77462">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2008 6:11:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Man, I just keep posting, but I&apos;m on a roll here.</p><p>Another &quot;discovery&quot;: This chord:</p><p>10:12.162:15</p><p>is 0-338-702, which is the noble mediant neutral third chord. 12.162<br/>represents the noble mediant between 5/4 and 6/5. If you stretch the<br/>fifth slightly:</p><p>10:12.162:15.2</p><p>The chord sounds a lot more like a &quot;minor&quot; chord. Likewise, the same<br/>noble third chord can be spelled like this:</p><p>4:4.865:6</p><p>And if you flat the fifth slightly:</p><p>4:4.865:5.86</p><p>You start to hear it spelled more like a &quot;major&quot; chord. So the other<br/>intervals in the chord also affects the perception of the metastable<br/>interval, as the ear can also adapt to hearing these chords as<br/>inharmonically stretched/compressed versions of other chords. Perhaps<br/>this accounts for some of the difference between these results and<br/>those predicted by harmonic entropy.</p><p>I didn&apos;t alter the fifths enough to actually continue the pattern for<br/>either of these chords. For the record, taking the neutral third chord<br/>and flattening the fifth so that it&apos;s in line with a &quot;major&quot; chord<br/>pattern yields this:</p><p>4:4.865:5.730</p><p>You should hear a very &quot;flattened&quot; sounding major chord, similar to<br/>the way that 19tet&apos;s major chord is &quot;flattened&quot; but even more so.<br/>Alternately, if you stop for a second and try to hear it as an<br/>isoharmonic diminished chord, that&apos;s what you&apos;ll hear.</p><p>My question with all of this is, when we&apos;re talking about how you<br/>perceive these intervals, are we talking about how you LABEL them?<br/>Because that seems to have to do with a number of psychological<br/>factors that have nothing to do with acoustics. In this case, the<br/>resonance of the chord and the proportion that the tones are in<br/>reminds me of major, but the notes themselves remind me of diminished.<br/>It&apos;s just a matter of two clashing schemas - this chord is where two<br/>conflicting schemas both represent part of it. My question is, do<br/>noble intervals in general represent a clash of some kind of<br/>psychoacoustic field of attraction, or a clash of a schematic approach<br/>to cognitively labeling intervals? Because in this case it seems to be<br/>the latter.</p><p>The minor version of the chord is this:</p><p>10:12.162:15.405</p><p>This one sounds like a stretched minor chord if you give it a second -<br/>there&apos;s no beating, but you might be apt to hear that outside interval<br/>as a minor sixth. In fact, you might be apt to hear the chord as a<br/>major chord in first inversion. Or you can hear it as a stretched<br/>minor chord. Another extremely ambiguous chord.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=77468 href="#77468">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2008 10:19:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt; What&apos;s interesting to me here is how much can you stretch a chord<br/>&gt; before it starts to sound like another chord?

I also made a temperament for this some time ago and there was some discussion about that on this list as well.

I think you&apos;re right, that it has everything to do<br/>&gt; with coinciding difference tones. I don&apos;t think it has anything to do<br/>&gt; with metastability.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The fact that you are using sine tones is the giveaway. Metastability<br/>&gt; should only really be relevant to tones rich in harmonics.</p><p>Well, it&apos;s not metastable in nature, but I have found that it has<br/>interesting applications to metastable intervals in a few ways. For<br/>example:</p><p>1. This chord, 4:4.865:5.730, is generated by taking a noble neutral<br/>third and making it isoharmonic. The whole chord is actually ambiguous<br/>between a major chord and a 5:6:7 diminished chord. I don&apos;t think that<br/>outer dyad is metastable by any means, and it might not even be in a<br/>zone of maximum harmonic entropy. So when you make chords with<br/>metastable intervals, there are other ways to work than making sure<br/>every dyad is metastable in and of itself. You can harmonize justly<br/>with the just notes and have one metastable interval, you can<br/>harmonize justly with the metastable interval, or you can harmonize in<br/>this way and stretch the whole chord out, which distributes the<br/>metastability of the original interval out over the whole chord. There<br/>are a two different ways to do this - the 1002 seventh is between 7/4<br/>and 9/5 for example, and you can distribute the chord so that the<br/>result becomes a stretched 4:5:6:7, or a compressed 20:25:30:36, not<br/>to mention all of the intermediant mediants (hmm) used to calculate<br/>the noble mediant.</p><p>2. Taking the 4:5.045:6.091:7.136 stretched 4:5:6:7 might work even<br/>better as a dominant 7 chord than just using 4:5:6:7.136, as each of<br/>the notes in the chord is going to be slightly more dissonant and<br/>contain slightly more harmonic entropy than if it were just a<br/>4:5:6:7.136 chord, thus making the tendency to resolve even stronger.<br/>Note that the 5 being stretched to 5.045 is around 401.825 cents,<br/>which would agree with the observations of many people that a slightly<br/>sharpened leading tone is often more effective in resolving to 1. And<br/>the 6.091 is 26 full cents sharp of a perfect fifth, but it blends in<br/>perfectly anyway - for a sine wave-like tone, I have to listen really<br/>hard to tell that it isn&apos;t a perfect fifth, as the resonance of the<br/>chord is that strong.</p><p>3. Since in this chord, you still hear a 4:5:6:7 in this kind of<br/>chord, it&apos;s possible that when you build chords in general what you<br/>might be hearing that is so strongly associated with the &quot;character&quot;<br/>of a chord is that difference tones reinforce one another in a pattern<br/>that you remember as well as whether or not they reinforce the<br/>partials of each tone. So what this means is that if you have<br/>4:5.045:6.091:7.136, you might be more likely to hear that as actually<br/>BEING 4:5:6:7 than you are to hear that 4:7.136 as a metastable<br/>dominant 7. So if you WANT that metastable dominant 7 over a JI major<br/>chord, and the chord is stretched like this, you&apos;ll have to stretch<br/>that 7.136 even FURTHER to get the equivalent &quot;stretched&quot; chord. What<br/>this means is that there might be a general tendency for regular<br/>&quot;non-stretched&quot; JI intervals to affect the perception of other JI<br/>intervals in this way, so that the most &quot;metastable&quot; version of some<br/>interval you want might actually change depending on the other notes<br/>in the chord, especially if you use a pure timbre.</p><p>and,</p><p>&gt; I think you will find that the effect you found will work equally with<br/>&gt; _any_ amount of stretch.</p><p>4. If you compress a major chord enough, you will eventually end up at<br/>5:6:7 rather than 4:5:6. So there are places of ambiguity for whole<br/>chords as well that play a similar role that the metastable intervals<br/>themselves do. If you make an isoharmonic triad with the third between<br/>4:5 and 5:6, and you make an isoharmonic triad with the fifth between<br/>2:3 and 5:7, you end up with different chords. And if you stretch and<br/>compress the chord enough, you&apos;ll eventually get at something that<br/>sounds like a completely different chord. What&apos;s the cutoff? Is it the<br/>metastable interval on the outer dyad, or the inner one, or do they<br/>all affect each other in some fashion...?</p><p>&gt; Experiments with very accurate sine tones through high quality<br/>&gt; headphones _quietly_, don&apos;t find anything special at any ratios.<br/>&gt; _Everything_ is concordant. But as soon as the slightest non-linearity<br/>&gt; appears in the system, e.g. less than perfect speakers or slightly<br/>&gt; louder tones causing the ear mechanism to go into a less linear<br/>&gt; region, then we start to get sum and difference tones being generated<br/>&gt; and will hear the coincidence of these as special.</p><p>Well, if you use a sine tone and you play 4:5.045:6:7.136, you&apos;ll hear<br/>some pretty heavy beating. But if you throw in 4:5.045:6.091:7.136,<br/>the beating will stop. Then again, I&apos;m using a sound that&apos;s close but<br/>not quite a sine wave, so that might have something to do with it -<br/>although, using that approach, the 6 should sound more consonant as<br/>the partials would collide, but I find the 4:5.045:6.091:7.136 sounds<br/>better unless the sound is really complex.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=77499 href="#77499">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2008 4:57:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Difference tones are produced in the mind by tracking. if you put different pitches is different ears with headphones you can hear them even though they don&apos;t occur in the air.</p><p>Helmholtz did work on the inversions of triads which is explain with difference tones.<br/>likewise i took all the four note combinations of the harmonics up to 11 and the inversions where none exceeded an octave, calculated this according to<br/>difference tones and have had it up here for years of which one has only to play through it to see that indeed it does have something to do with it.<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/lullaby.html">http://anaphoria.com/lullaby.html</a></p><p>then you can tune up any of the first set of meru scales.</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nothing to do with difference tones could explain the<br/>&gt; disappearance of beating that Mike was reporting.

JI<br/>&gt; works that way and I think any kinds of radical extensions to JI or<br/>&gt; shadows of JI or whatever should have to, too.</p><p>A logical question here is, when we&apos;re talking about the &quot;fields of<br/>attraction&quot; that these noble mediants fall between, are we talking<br/>about the fields of attraction between two intervals in the just<br/>harmonic series, or rather should we be talking about the field of<br/>attraction between two intervals in the harmonic series of a timbre? I<br/>am inclined to believe the latter, though perhaps raw frequencies<br/>might play into it a bit, but I would expect that effect to be most<br/>likely if there is some nonlinear effect such as distortion on a<br/>timbre.</p><p>Actually I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s the timbre, and I&apos;m going to post some<br/>examples about it shortly.</p><p>So what I&apos;m starting to realize about the requirement that tuning be<br/>independent of timbre is that it&apos;s a false requirement. The reason JI<br/>works is because MOST timbres are harmonic, and if they&apos;re slightly<br/>inharmonic then we&apos;re already so used to hearing that in each<br/>individual note that we still hear chords out of tune. Of course, if<br/>you mic a piano and run it through a distortion effect, even single<br/>notes will sound &quot;out of tune&quot; due to that effect, but for the most<br/>part, chords in real life sound fine.</p><p>But even more so, if a timbre is inharmonic then stretched octave<br/>tunings that are stretched to match that inharmonicity will sound<br/>&quot;more in tune&quot; than using normal JI. This is why the tuning is<br/>stretched on an acoustic piano, like we were talking about in the<br/>other thread.</p><p>Either way, trying to separate the timbre from the tuning and coming<br/>up with a tuning that will work with all timbres seems like a good<br/>idea, but I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s going to work out all the way. Didn&apos;t<br/>someone on here mention someone who used timbres with the partials<br/>tuned to 10-tet so that 10-tet was in tune?

In what octaves<br/>&gt;&gt; are they sounding?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The lowest tone is 250Hz and the other three make the intervals<br/>&gt; as I said in the post with the link -- i.e. as long as I take<br/>&gt; all pitches related to the lowest one and round them to nearest<br/>&gt; cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr</p><p>Thanks.  So the 1st chord is:</p><p>250.0 Hz.<br/>* 1.2606 = 315.15<br/>* 1.5000 = 375.0<br/>* 1.7818 = 445.45</p><p>So the 1st-order difference tones are:</p><p>65.15 125.0 195.45<br/>70.45 59.85<br/>130.3 Hz.</p><p>In the 2nd chord, 375.0 Hz. is replaced by 380.24 Hz., making<br/>the following 1st-order difference tones:</p><p>65.15 130.24 195.45<br/>65.20 65.10<br/>130.3 Hz.</p><p>So yup, that&apos;s the explanation alright.  If you use sine<br/>tones to make music, you&apos;ve got to be aware of this stuff.<br/>If you don&apos;t, you can ignore it.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=77551 href="#77551">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2008 6:22:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot; &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I did my own listening example too.

But when you<br/>start using metallophones or synthesising inharmonic tibres a la<br/>Sethares, then it may be best to think in terms of having shifted both<br/>the Just intervals and the metastable intervals between them. So the<br/>Just intervals are no longer at simple rationals, nor the metastables<br/>at simple nobles. However, when this is done, some say there are also<br/>still &quot;ghost&quot; versions of the original simple rational Just intervals,<br/>irrespective of the inharmonic partials.</p><p>&gt; I<br/>&gt; am inclined to believe the latter, though perhaps raw frequencies<br/>&gt; might play into it a bit,</p><p>Yes. It seems to be a bit of both.</p><p>&gt; but I would expect that effect to be most<br/>&gt; likely if there is some nonlinear effect such as distortion on a<br/>&gt; timbre.</p><p>Possibly so.</p><p>&gt; Actually I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s the timbre, and I&apos;m going to post some<br/>&gt; examples about it shortly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So what I&apos;m starting to realize about the requirement that tuning be<br/>&gt; independent of timbre is that it&apos;s a false requirement. The reason JI<br/>&gt; works is because MOST timbres are harmonic, and if they&apos;re slightly<br/>&gt; inharmonic then we&apos;re already so used to hearing that in each<br/>&gt; individual note that we still hear chords out of tune. Of course, if<br/>&gt; you mic a piano and run it through a distortion effect, even single<br/>&gt; notes will sound &quot;out of tune&quot; due to that effect, but for the most<br/>&gt; part, chords in real life sound fine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But even more so, if a timbre is inharmonic then stretched octave<br/>&gt; tunings that are stretched to match that inharmonicity will sound<br/>&gt; &quot;more in tune&quot; than using normal JI. This is why the tuning is<br/>&gt; stretched on an acoustic piano, like we were talking about in the<br/>&gt; other thread.</p><p>Sure. But the other thing that happens is, the more inharmonic each<br/>tone is, the less it has a well defined pitch. A tone consisting of<br/>only noble partials might not have any &quot;pitch&quot; at all.</p><p>&gt; Either way, trying to separate the timbre from the tuning and coming<br/>&gt; up with a tuning that will work with all timbres seems like a good<br/>&gt; idea, but I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s going to work out all the way. Didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; someone on here mention someone who used timbres with the partials<br/>&gt; tuned to 10-tet so that 10-tet was in tune? That&apos;s sort of what I&apos;m<br/>&gt; getting at.</p><p>You&apos;re quite right.

As you said, you could<br/>&gt; stretch 4:5:6:7 by _any_ amount. And, as you suggested, you could even<br/>&gt; give the tones inharmonic partials, a la Sethares, that coincide with<br/>&gt; the intermodulation products, and they would remain beatless (but it<br/>&gt; would all sound like bells).</p><p>I cane up with this specific chord by stretching the chord by just<br/>enough so that the 7 becomes a 1002 cent noble 7. And rather than<br/>leave the 5 and 6 in place, I stretched those notes out as well so<br/>that the whole chord sounds like 4:5:6:7. And the chord has some<br/>interesting properties that reflect back on metastable intervals:</p><p>1. Metastable intervals, to be REALLY metastable, might be best<br/>calculated between two ratios of the harmonic series of the timbre<br/>being used, rather than a perfect harmonic series.</p><p>2. There might be an interesting musical function for the chord<br/>4:5.045:6.091:7.136. Does that dominant 7 chord resolve more strongly<br/>to 1 than 4:5:6:7.136? If you compare the two chords even with a<br/>complex harmonic timbre, the stretched chord has an interesting<br/>resonant sound to it while still maintaining the &quot;metastable&quot; warbly<br/>kind of character to it. Here&apos;s a sound clip of the two functioning as<br/>V7 -&gt; I: <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/3g39p7as8o">http://www.box.net/shared/3g39p7as8o</a></p><p>&gt; Yes, you can use these methods to make metastable intervals consonant.<br/>&gt; You can use them to make _any_ intervals consonant.</p><p>So the next question is, what use do we have for metastable intervals<br/>by using these methods to make them consonant? What if we have a whole<br/>song in a sine wave tone, and suddenly we introduce a stretched chord<br/>stretched just enough that one of the intervals becomes metastable?<br/>Or, if we could dynamically adjust the timbre of a sound and stretch<br/>7/4 so it becomes 1002 cents, what effect would that chord have as a V<br/>chord in relation to a I chord in a normal harmonic series?</p><p>&gt; I feel that the point of giving metastable intervals a name, is to<br/>&gt; recognise and use them for what they are, harmonics and all, e.g. &quot;the<br/>&gt; worstest of the worst, but somehow with divinity imbued&quot; (Erv Wilson<br/>&gt; regarding the phi interval).</p><p>If that&apos;s the main function of metastable intervals for you, then<br/>check out the stretched V-I chord, as I feel it resolves more strongly<br/>to I, although that V might be a little too high.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=77569 href="#77569">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2008 11:12:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Jun 21, 2008 at 9:42 PM, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; As far as i can evaluate the situation.

This is equivalent to puting each through a log function,<br/>then adding them and then putting the result through an exponential<br/>function.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=77839 href="#77839">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2008 8:51:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Just trying to tidy up some loose ends.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You seem to be ignoring virtual pitch, which is more import<br/>&gt; than roughness in musical consonance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Experiments with very accurate sine tones through high<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quality headphones _quietly_, don&apos;t find anything special<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at any ratios.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What about Vos&apos; experiments?

Sorry. Quite right. There is beating getting faster as we move<br/>away from the unison, going to roughness at about the semitone and<br/>then gone by about the minor third, nothing after that, even near the<br/>octave.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=77840 href="#77840">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2008 9:10:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; That&apos;s part of it.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The ability to recognize formant filtering of a single<br/>&gt;&gt; source as such is at the heart of our ability to understand<br/>&gt;&gt; speech.
