It is my understanding that one<br/>of the many uses of Csound is to take samples of instruments that<br/>already exist (much like you use existing patches on your TX81Z<br/>instead of making up new ones) and use them to play music in a<br/>different intonation. I believe that this is what Prent Rodgers work<br/>is all about. I am more than willing to be corrected on this, though.</p><p>&gt; What&apos;s more, composers don&apos;t have to learn to PLAY every instrument<br/>&gt; for which they compose.  I don&apos;t feel they should have to, either...</p><p>Wait, no one says you *have* to learn them, but to give a little<br/>study to understand what they are capable of seems perfectly<br/>reasonable. Not everyone wants to obsess over notation -- that is a<br/>personal choice, and I bring it up because you&apos;ve been working on<br/>that recently -- because then can either make non-notatble, non-real-<br/>time music, or just find something that works that matches the music<br/>they already hear. Again, purely personal pathes and choices.</p><p>&gt; the composers using it have been just working on their own projects<br/>&gt; and no one has really taken the AUTHORITY to harbor CSOUND as a<br/>&gt; releasable product for general use...</p><p>It may not be *intended* for general use. I would propose that it is<br/>a high level sound crafting environment -- it is not a MIDI sequencer<br/>or loop-based composition tools, both of which lend themselve easily<br/>to &apos;general use&apos;.</p><p>&gt; A lot of creativity would be released from composers who don&apos;t want<br/>&gt; to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; or mess around with their autoexec.bat<br/>&gt; files!</p><p>I&apos;m not sure about that. I think people gravitate toward tools that<br/>make sense for their purposes. My original suggestions were a tiny<br/>change to the front of the experience, but I wouldn&apos;t propose making<br/>it broad and shallow, which would be the danger -- narrow and deep is<br/>fine by me. If you look at the original gestation of this thing, it<br/>is somewhat amazing the platforms and abilities it *does* have.</p><p>Composers, choose your weapons carefully.</p><p>Speaking of which, I got this from Nick Didkovsky, which a few of you<br/>might want to check out:</p><p>&quot;I have a performance coming up which uses JSyn and JMSL.<br/>Rather than clog bandwidth with details, you are invited<br/>to visit <a href="http://www.doctornerve.org/monkeyfarm">http://www.doctornerve.org/monkeyfarm</a></p><p>-- Nick Didkovsky&quot;</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>4/26/2001 2:02:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., paul@s... wrote:<br/>&gt; Anyway, Joseph, perhaps the word &quot;composer&quot; is outdated for someone<br/>&gt; who uses CSOUND</p><p>Amen!!!</p><p>&gt; (P.S.

Because, unlike many applications, Csound<br/>depends on accessing several files at once, it needs to know where they all<br/>are. Setting up default directories is frequently an irritant, especially<br/>if users are not used to that sort of thing (unix users often are).</p><p>Another problem potentially lies in automated playback of sound files.<br/>Csound front-ends on some platforms do not provide players and those that<br/>do sometimes have to be integrated with the particular soundcard driver,<br/>which can also be a pain. I&apos;ve seen many posts on the Csound list about<br/>sound cards supported under Linux, though others claim that Linux is a very<br/>stable platform for Csound.</p><p>Csound does not have a text editor integrated into it, though some people<br/>have developed specialized macro environments for emacs and other text<br/>editors for Csound. Otherwise, I always have to emphasize to my students to<br/>save as &quot;text only&quot; from their favorite word processor. (Very occasionally<br/>there will be invisible and spurious characters in a text file that cause<br/>Csound to crash, but that&apos;s the fault of the word processor, not Csound.)</p><p>There is a clear tutorial on the installation of Windows Csound at<br/><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/csound/fpage/gs/pc/pc.html">http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/csound/fpage/gs/pc/pc.html</a>. There is also<br/>DirectCsound, a second version for Windows that some of my students have<br/>had more success with. It has some features not in the canonical version.</p><p>I don&apos;t mean this to sound like platform bigotry, but I&apos;ve never had the<br/>first two of the above problems on the mac, where the front-end offers<br/>playback from the standardized sound manager, an easy interface to choose<br/>default directories, no need to mess with command-lines, and menu/dialog<br/>access to virtually all compilation and sound file options. You can set a<br/>default text editor, but one is not built-in. There are other problems with<br/>using the mac version sometimes, but on the whole I find it stable and easy<br/>to get started with.</p><p>Most of my students (I&apos;d say two-thirds) opt for Csound on Windows since<br/>that&apos;s what they have. Usually, there will be several (though certainly not<br/>all or even most) who will have a problem with the setup. Usually these<br/>problems are easily fixed -- if not, I sometimes point them to DirectCsound<br/>if they&apos;ve been using the bath version or vice-versa. I&apos;d say the remaining<br/>third are split between macs and unix/linux -- the latter are usually<br/>computer literate enough to be comfortable with the low-level installation<br/>and sound driver issues.</p><p>It&apos;s frustrating to me that people find so many of these problems, because<br/>it turns them off from a very powerful tool, especially for tuning. No<br/>doubt the reason it is coming up on the tuning list is that, unlike most<br/>synthesizers, it is not tied to any particular tuning model. I have used it<br/>several times for &quot;free-style&quot; JI, something very, very difficult with any<br/>conventional acoustic or MIDI solution.</p><p>Though I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t help much with Windows installation and front-end<br/>issues, I can often help with problems with Csound itself, and members of<br/>the Csound list are especially generous in this regard.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

Most of the type of people<br/>that work in this realm already know what they are doing, and are<br/>long past the install-and-learning-curve point. Communal based<br/>software (like Linux and many other examples) live and grow and<br/>develop through the intercommunication of their users.
