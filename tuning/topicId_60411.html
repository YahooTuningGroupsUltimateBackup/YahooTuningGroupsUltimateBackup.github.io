I played it today... :) Lest anyone<br/>doubt... :)</p><p>It&apos;s great... with touch-sensitive keys and a nice full layout --<br/>five separate segments or &quot;octaves&quot;... if you program it that way.<br/>There should be some pix up soon, but you can see this part from the<br/>web so far:</p><p><a href="http://www.cortex-design.com/project.htm">http://www.cortex-design.com/project.htm</a></p><p>(What you see here is a prototype for one of the five &quot;segments...&quot;)</p><p>We got it working with SCALA, although there needs to be a multi-<br/>channel implementation of SCALA before the interface is fully<br/>functional, since each segment should be on a separate MIDI channel.<br/>However, this will be in the works.</p><p>The physical instrument, though, is very close to completion. Just a<br/>few minor engineering &quot;improvements&quot; and it&apos;s here. Believe me... I<br/>saw it, I played it. (I didn&apos;t &quot;conquer&quot; it, though... I&apos;m a<br/>Bosanquet-baby...)</p><p>The keyboard I saw is being manufactured for Joel Mandelbaum and<br/>Queens College, and aside from seeing several of my old acquaintances<br/>from Queens College (I&apos;ve done collaborations), I was able to see the<br/>older Scalatrons that George Secor had Motorola put together in the<br/>70&apos;s.</p><p>I had never seen the Queens Bosanquet Sclatron, but only the more<br/>conventional one with the Halberstadt keyboard. One reason is that<br/>the Bosanquet one hasn&apos;t worked for many years. It has a very<br/>colorful keyboard, though.</p><p>However, it isn&apos;t MIDI, and these huge machines are elephants<br/>compared to the new sleek, light Bosanquet that Johnny and the AFMM<br/>will have available for sale soon.
