My life has been filled with events that cause me to reevaluate<br/>my own strong statements. This I post for those who caught my critisms<br/>of tenney recently. Also on the program was a Feldman piece FOR FOUR<br/>PIANOS which was really good (and would have been better in Pythagorean)<br/>I just kept thinking it could be played on the same program as LE NOCES<br/>as an irony in contrast!. Also saw a new John Adams which what you would<br/>expect from the corporate court!. Yesterday I heard Lou Harrisons SUITE<br/>FOR VIOLIN AND AMERICAN GAMELAN now performed of a new reconstructed<br/>Just instruments and the VIOLIN REALLY CRANKED (as in the opposite of<br/>sucked!) and got all the pitches little vibrato. Lou remains for me one<br/>of the greatest melodist of this century. They always grow in power with<br/>repeated listenings under the guise of being simple!<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
