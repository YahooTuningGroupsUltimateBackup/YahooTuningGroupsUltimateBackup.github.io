But ask yourself why nobody plays Rachmaninov on a synth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes.  Rachmaminov wrote for a particular instrument, so you wouldn&apos;t expect<br/>&gt;the music to transfer to another one.  I keep asking myself why people still<br/>&gt;play Bach on a piano, and &quot;conservatism&quot; seems to be the answer.</p><p>I&apos;m no Rach fan, BTW.  I know people who want my head for this, but with<br/>few exceptions (perhaps the Toccatas and Goldbergs), I prefer Bach on the<br/>piano.  It has a lot more phrasing power than the harpsichord, if you know<br/>how to play it (not that I do).</p><p>&gt;&gt;There&apos;s more to speed than runs.  Repetition is the most important place to<br/>&gt;&gt;have speed, and the piano has got everything else beat by a mile.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Rubbish.  Sequencers are the thing.  Record once, loop it, double the<br/>&gt;tempo...</p><p>Now there&apos;s a recipe for musical results!</p><p>&gt;Sure.  Regardless of the keyboards, though, there are some places where<br/>&gt;synths have the upper hand.  One is that it&apos;s much easier to retune a synth.<br/>&gt;This is the killer for me.</p><p>For me too.</p><p>&gt;Another is that you can get a higher variety of sounds from a synth.</p><p>That all depends.  In theory?  Yes.  Have I heard it?  No.</p><p>&gt;Only playing one voice at a time as if it were an acoustic instrument<br/>isn&apos;t &gt;showing it in its best light.</p><p>Multitracking is cool for anything.  Let&apos;s talk instruments, that is, what<br/>one person can do in real time.</p><p>&gt;For that matter, using the preset voices doesn&apos;t give me what I want.</p><p>I&apos;ve been synthesizing since I was in the 5th grade (ESQ-1).  I&apos;ve never<br/>been able to come up with anything good for much more than shock value.  I<br/>had a chance to play a bit with a GDS synergy (used by Wendy Carlos on<br/>Digital Moonscapes), and it was one exception.  DM is my pick for best<br/>synthesis ever, BTW.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m not much interested in a synth that sounds like any particular acoustic<br/>&gt;instrument.</p><p>Nor am I.  But I do want one at least as powerful.</p><p>&gt;If you don&apos;t like the sound, try sending it through guitar effects.</p><p>Maybe the best keyboard sound I&apos;ve ever got was with Pagano&apos;s Baldwin organ<br/>and a MuTron phasor...</p><p>C.</p></div><h3><a id=1430 href="#1430">ðŸ”—</a>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/1999 8:40:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl<br/>I knew I liked you.<br/>You are going to poop your tet pants when you here the new record.<br/>we got a full Baldwin &quot;Dronosonic&quot; with leslie etc. all in Lambdoma Freqs<br/>cheers<br/>Pat</p><p>&gt; Maybe the best keyboard sound I&apos;ve ever got was with Pagano&apos;s Baldwin organ<br/>&gt; and a MuTron phasor...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; Have you visited our new web site?<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.onelist.com">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>&gt; Onelist: Helping to create Internet communities<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
