I wouldn&apos;t call it a &apos;b13&apos; even though<br/>   it is a flat thirteen. Part of this weakness comes from the<br/>   lack of identity vs the b9, where I would like to hear a P5.</p><p>   In playing the scale, the 13/11 between the b13 and b5 is too<br/>   much of a &apos;minor third&apos; when I want to hear a whole tone.</p><p>   Although the 21/16 G sounds GREAT with the A7 triad, the<br/>   fact that it misses a bunch of good relationships with the<br/>   chord and scale under discussion make me want to hear it<br/>   (as well as the b13 and b5) a little sharper.</p><p>I presented a half-dozen alternatives last week which, John<br/>correctly anticipated, would not work. Most of them tuned<br/>the inter-relationships (getting the P5s and triads back)<br/>but weakenning the identity a &apos;A&apos;. So eventually, I adopted<br/>his tuning from A to D, as it was more<br/>pleasing an &quot;A like&quot; than any of my alternatives.</p><p>But then I &apos;corrected&apos; the top of the scale for my ears by<br/>getting the fifths and upper structure triads in tune.<br/>(shown in its full chromatic glory).</p><p>    A      Bb     B     B#    C#    D   Eb     E     F     F#  G     G#<br/>A   1/1  17/16   9/8  19/16  5/4   4/3 17/12  3/2  19/12  5/3 16/9  15/8<br/>D   3/2  51/32  27/16 57/32  15/8   1  17/16  9/8  19/16  5/4  4/3 45/32</p><p>The only real sacrifice is the 16/9 rather than 7/4 seventh, which is<br/>certainly &apos;spongier&apos; on a plain A7, but to my ears worked better in<br/>the &quot;altered dominant&quot; scale and chord.</p><p>It features the intriguing identity 51:64:76 ~= 4:5:6!</p><p>When I actually looked at the cents deviations, I realized that<br/>I&apos;m getting pretty close to reinventing 12tet (the hard way!).</p><p>a          2<br/>bb         7<br/>b          6<br/>b#        -1<br/>c#       -12<br/>d          0<br/>eb         5<br/>e          4<br/>f         -2<br/>f#       -14<br/>g         -2<br/>g#       -10</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/1999 7:06:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Bob Valentine, TD 396.1]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After last weeks exchange on the altered dominant scale,<br/>&gt; I had a weekend to sit at the tuning table and try all<br/>&gt; manner of experiment in.

(Paul&apos;s<br/>usual example is a &apos;6/9 chord&apos;.)</p><p>What this kind of thing points out is that the entire<br/>thought-process involved in analyzing and describing<br/>chords is highly conditioned by the kind of tuning<br/>system under consideration.  Many types of chords<br/>and descriptions of their progressions are really<br/>only possible in 12-eq, and trying to make them<br/>fit a certain rational implication is quite difficult,<br/>and many different rational interpretations could be<br/>argued with various degrees of success.</p><p>When listing chord-members as ratios they can certainly<br/>be analyzed as having multiple functions, as Partch<br/>pointed out so emphatically.  But as Bob points out<br/>these multiple functions are often hard to reconcile<br/>with the types of multiple functions possible in 12-eq<br/>or other types of tunings.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
