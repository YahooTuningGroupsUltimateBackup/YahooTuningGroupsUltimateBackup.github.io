Like<br/>&gt;&gt;4:5:6 = 4, 10:12:15 = 10, etc.?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I would really like to know! More interesting, though, and perhaps easier<br/>&gt;to extend to triads (?), is my very recent (Friday?) posting to the effect<br/>&gt;that the domain of a dyad in the set of dyads within a certain numerator<br/>&gt;times-denominator limit is inversely proportional to the square root of the<br/>&gt;numerator times the denominator.</p><p>You included something about that in your original post on the derrivation<br/>of denominator complexity from the Farey series, if memory serves.  You<br/>said it was better behaved than denominator limit.  I&apos;ve been using n*d<br/>complexity since &apos;96.  I&apos;m glad to know that it is self-consistent in this<br/>way (predicts domain in an n*d series).  [The fuzz factor of 2 for the Farey<br/>stuff -- is that related an original odd-limit assumption (is there one?)<br/>which is lacking from the n*d stuff?  Hmm!  Looks like I need to read your<br/>derrivation again.]</p><p>How n*d is easier to apply to triads is beyond me.  Since mediants are<br/>not defined for triads, the strategy used in your denominator proof is<br/>seems un-usable.  If I remember, you left the n*d derrivation to the<br/>reader.  Looks like I should take you up on that...</p><p>&lt;2.&gt;<br/>&gt;That depends on your mapping from 7-limit to meantone.</p><p>Naturally.</p><p>&gt;         | Max. error |Sum-squared error|Sum-absolute error|<br/>&gt;---------+------------+-----------------+------------------+<br/>&gt;Inverse  |  697.3465  |    696.6717     |    696.5784      |<br/>&gt;Limit    |            |                 |                  |<br/>&gt;Weighted |            |                 |                  |<br/>&gt;---------+------------+-----------------+------------------+<br/>&gt;Equal    |  696.5784  |    696.6480     |    696.8826      |<br/>&gt;Weighted |            |                 |                  |<br/>&gt;         |            |                 |                  |<br/>&gt;---------+------------+-----------------+------------------+<br/>&gt;Limit    |  696.5126  |    696.6672     |    696.8826      |<br/>&gt;Weighted |            |                 |                  |<br/>&gt;         |            |                 |                  |<br/>&gt;---------+------------+-----------------+------------------+<br/>&gt;7/4 &amp;    |  696.6255  |    696.7059     |    696.8826      |<br/>&gt;7/5 &amp;    |            |                 |                  |<br/>&gt;7/6      |            |                 |                  |<br/>&gt;only     |            |                 |                  |<br/>&gt;---------+------------+-----------------+------------------+</p><p>Solid!</p><p>&gt;As far as I&apos;m concerned, these are all &quot;close enough&quot; to the 31-tET fifth,<br/>&gt;696.7742&cent;</p><p>Agree.
