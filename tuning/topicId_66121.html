What absolute frequencies would you like to choose as a starting octave?<br/>If I want to examine beat rates in your tuning and make an useful whole of<br/>it, I have to start with two absolute frequencies and the 2/1 ratio is the<br/>best choice, I think.<br/>2. How much do you allow me to alter the starting frequency in case I needed<br/>to find meaningful beat rates? For example, if I make a 12-tone keyboard<br/>tuning which should start with an A4 of 440Hz at best, I know this starting<br/>A4 should not be away by more than, let&apos;s say, 10 cents.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
