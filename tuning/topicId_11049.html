It does have a more precise 5-limit approximation than any smaller<br/>EDO.  But it isn&apos;t the only 5-limit consistent EDO that is also consistent<br/>with its cycle of fifths.  29 pure fourths are 144.4 steps of 29-EDO, and<br/>approximate to 144 steps.</p><p>&gt; This is because 2^(1/53), the &apos;step-size&apos; of 53-EDO, is<br/>&gt; almost exactly midway between the two relevant commas,<br/>&gt; being ~1.1 cent smaller than the Pythagorean and ~0.8 cent<br/>&gt; larger than the syntonic:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~21.5    cents - syntonic comma<br/>&gt; ~22.6415 cents - 2^(1/53)<br/>&gt; ~23.46   cents - Pythagorean comma</p><p>Well, the optimum 5-limit schismic tuning would be something like -1/8 or<br/>-1/9 schisma, where the comma is flat of both syntonic and Pythagorean<br/>commas.  So the precision of 53= doesn&apos;t follow from this observation at<br/>all.</p><p>If you&apos;re only interested in 5-limit approximations, and really really<br/>want 53 notes within the octave, you could try a well temperament based on<br/>-1/9 schisma.  You&apos;d have to dispose of about 4 schismas, or 8 cents.</p><p>&gt; Therefore, any combinations of tones in 53-EDO will yield<br/>&gt; pitches or intervals that are reasonably close to any of the<br/>&gt; rational ones within a 5-limit system of 53 tones or less.</p><p>So you&apos;re saying any interval in 53= will be reasonably close to a complex<br/>5-prime-limit interval?  Do you think the ear can actually make sense of<br/>this?</p><p>&gt; An important point to note is that 53-EDO distinguishes between<br/>&gt; the two different sizes of semitone in both the Pythagorean<br/>&gt; and 5-limit JI tunings; it would thus be inappropriate<br/>&gt; (or at least, radical) for performance of works written with<br/>&gt; a 12-note meantone tuning in mind.  An extended meantone is<br/>&gt; perhaps another matter...</p><p>This is a general schismic thing.  The larger Pythagorean semitone is<br/>confounded with 16/15, so you get three different kinds of semitone.  29=<br/>already distinguishes between them.  And makes the distinction very clear.</p><p>One thing I found by trying schismic tunings is that the comma in 53= is<br/>too small to be clearly comprehended.  It has an annoying &quot;something&apos;s not<br/>right&quot; quality.  Fatten it up to 41=, and it&apos;s heard as a melodic<br/>elaboration.</p><p>&gt; If one&apos;s interest is to find EDOs which provide good approximations<br/>&gt; to &apos;Xeno-Gothic&apos; Pythagorean tunings, 53-EDO is the prime candidate.</p><p>Hell, no!  Xeno-Gothic, as we&apos;ve been discussing it, uses approximations<br/>up to the 7-prime limit. (Now I&apos;ve looked at it more closely, the<br/>progression Margo gave as an example acutally shows an anomalous 9-limit<br/>chord resolving onto a 3-limit trine.  Interestingly, no factors of 5 are<br/>involved at all.) In this context, considering only EDOs, 41 is far and<br/>away the prime candidate.  Dare I say the only one worth bothering with?<br/>No, 29&apos;s worth a look as well, as is 17, or even 135 if you can handle<br/>that many notes.</p><p>So there you are, I&apos;ve saved you 12 notes per octave!</p><p>                 Graham</p><p>p.s. for those interested, looks like my TX81Z patches are still at<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/graham/x991203.zip">http://x31eq.com/graham/x991203.zip</a> but not linked to as I<br/>haven&apos;t updated my website in a looooooong time.</p></div><h3><a id=11050 href="#11050">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2000 4:12:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham Breed,</p><p>I admitted right up front that I wasn&apos;t really following this<br/>thread.</p><p>Now I&apos;ll admit that I haven&apos;t really experimented with 53-EDO<br/>and was only speaking from theoretical knowledge.  I bow to<br/>your superior expertise in this, and thanks for the corrections<br/>you posted in TD 700.25.</p><p>Paul,</p><p>The reason I limited myself to a 12-tone meantone was simply<br/>because on first thought it seemed to me that a &gt;12 meantone<br/>would have the two different sizes of semitone, which could<br/>be approximated well with 53-EDO.
