Actually the mathematical term is &quot;linear combinations&quot;, i.e. { As +<br/>Bt : A, B are positive integers, and s,t are fixed real numbers}. By the way,<br/>you can make an interesting graph to demonstrate your ideas. Perhaps in a<br/>graphics program like Adobe Illustrator create a grid system of 1 unit (1/4 &quot;<br/>wide for example). Then on another layer, marker of the another grid with units<br/>of s units on the x axis, and t units on the y axis. Then you identify the<br/>intersection points which constitute your tuning system. It would be interesting<br/>to see.</p></div>
