So please don&apos;t<br/>get me wrong. It&apos;s just that I also think composers shouldn&apos;t ignore those<br/>who won&apos;t or can&apos;t, and write something for them too.</p><p>The more people we get playing music that&apos;s not in 12EDO, the better it<br/>gets for new instruments that make the new music easier. I for one would<br/>love to use a proper generalised keyboard - there is a harpsichord in 19<br/>equal with a wilson/bosanquet keyboard that Patrick Ozzard-Low has a<br/>photograph of that I for one would very much like to play. It&apos;s so<br/>different with its hexagonal keys that a different technique is required, I<br/>suspect. But it looks incredible (is there a pic on the web of it for all<br/>to see?)</p><p>I just wish more musicians were &apos;open minded&apos; enough to give these new<br/>instruments a try. Some I meet from the colleges and from more mundane<br/>circles look at you as if you&apos;re mad when the microtonality word is<br/>mentioned - instantly they think of scales with &apos;millions of notes&apos; in<br/>them, and they imagine keyboards with millions of keys, and wind<br/>instruments with millions of holes and keys. Even string players complain<br/>of microtones. &apos;It&apos;s just fringe stuff,&apos; they say, &apos; and you can&apos;t put it<br/>with Beethoven, nobody&apos;d go to the concert.&apos;</p><p>Perhaps I&apos;m just too pragmatic, too easy to make compromise. But it&apos;s<br/>always nice to hear one of the aforesaid musicans come back to you later,<br/>when you&apos;ve shown them a way to microtones without the pain of a new<br/>instrument or technique, and say &apos;I liked that. How can I do more?&apos;</p><p>Mark</p></div><h3><a id=39444 href="#39444">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/10/2002 9:47:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;there is a harpsichord in 19 equal with a wilson/bosanquet<br/>&gt;keyboard that Patrick Ozzard-Low has a photograph of that I for<br/>&gt;one would very much like to play.
