I edit the manual for a package<br/>&gt; developed in Illinois and they spent several months working on microtonal<br/>&gt; notation and playback. They worked with a guy in Canada, and I used Kurt<br/>&gt; Stone&apos;s text for the symbols. I&apos;d be curious to see if it comes close to the<br/>&gt; needs of this group.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I use Finale (Win2001d, with a lot of plug-ins and added fonts) which has in<br/>recent versions become much more friendly for pitchbend instructions and font<br/>management. I have also test-driven Sibelius and Lime, and find them comparable,<br/>but my Finale output after so many years of tweaking has reached a satisfactory<br/>stage that I&apos;m loathe to give up.</p><p>When I want an audible microtonal output from Finale, I work in two ways:<br/>entering individual pitchbends as articulations (this only works when cent<br/>deviations form 12tet are a useful notation to performers), or I use Finale as a<br/>midi sequencer (for which it is not ideal, but good enough for my purposes) and<br/>send the output into a .WAV file rendering program (WAVMaker), which has a bank<br/>of full-rang midi tuning tables to render into exact frequencies. In the later<br/>case, the screen often has little resemblance to the audible result, making it<br/>function somewhat like a Partch-style tablature.</p><p>What would be most useful is a plug-in where I could set up a full keyboard<br/>tuning on my input keyboard and then map the individual midi key numbers to<br/>notes with user defined microtonal accidentals other than the built-in<br/>quartertone model.  There is so much variability in tuning practice in our<br/>community that anything less would be only of limited usage.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=18881 href="#18881">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@unicode.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2001 12:26:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel Wolf &lt;<a href="mailto:djwolf1@matavnet.hu">djwolf1@matavnet.hu</a>&gt; wrote...</p><p>&gt; the screen often has little resemblance to the audible result, making it<br/>&gt; function somewhat like a Partch-style tablature.</p><p>Sounds familiar... I work with Finale 2001d as well...  In my 12 years or<br/>so of doing microtonal work with MIDI and computer notation programs, I<br/>mainly use music notation as a kind of &quot;tablature&quot; -- it&apos;s familiar to me<br/>so that I can see a note, hit the right key with the right duration.  The<br/>written note correponds to a key on the keyboard, not to a frequency; and<br/>the vertical relations are steps of the tuning, not ratios of pitches.  I<br/>send the output to TX802s set up with their own full-keybaord tuning tables<br/>that have nothing whatever to do with the &quot;written pitches&quot;.</p><p>Well, it doesn&apos;t make logical sense to work this way, but then I work with<br/>many tunings especally n-tETs from to 19, harmonic scale, Balinese<br/>scales...  It&apos;s just easier to have ONE notation that fits a fingering<br/>pattern I&apos;m used to and makes sense to my musical eye-hand training; it<br/>would be hard to have umpteen different notations for different tunings and<br/>have to guess about what keyboard button corresponds to what...</p><p>&gt; There is so much variability in tuning practice in our<br/>&gt; community that anything less would be only of limited usage.</p><p>This is really the limiting factor: too many tunings for one notation.  I<br/>don&apos;t see the problem of coherent notation as having any real good<br/>solutions that suit the new model of &quot;any possible tuning any time&quot;... at<br/>least, not any coherent notations that humans would find useful for live<br/>performance.  And really, that&apos;s the only reason for externalizing most<br/>notations: so that people can use them to learn pieces for live<br/>performance, or so people can &quot;follow the score&quot; while listening.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
