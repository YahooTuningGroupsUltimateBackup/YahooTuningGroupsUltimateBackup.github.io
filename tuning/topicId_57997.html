I believe Olivier Messiaen based much of his musical<br/>theory and practice on birdsong (more particularly in the<br/>realm of additive rhythms than in pitch and scale).</p><p>Anyway this recent discussion, started by Robert Walker<br/>prompted me to do a little more research.</p><p>Ozan wrote:<br/>____________________________________________<br/>Solo Explorer 1.0 from <a href="http://www.recognisoft.com">www.recognisoft.com</a> has a modest<br/> pitch to midi conversion feature for monophonic wave files.</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Graham Breed&quot;<br/>....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert Walker wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; BTW one idea I had for analysing bird song<br/>&gt; &gt; is to try and fit a best fit sine wave to it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you looked at Csound?  Chapter 21 of &quot;The Csound Book&quot; describes<br/>&gt; how to make a pitch to MIDI convertor.
