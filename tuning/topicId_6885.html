Man, it&apos;s amazing what was<br/>published in 1966.  Would the same be published today??  I rather<br/>doubt it -- times have changed,</p><p>You really think so? I don&apos;t know, but I&apos;d tend to think that Ives&apos;<br/>&quot;respectability&quot; will probably fall in and out of favor (or vogue) for<br/>quite awhile to come... One of the things that really stunned me when<br/>I first became interested in Ives and started reading what I could<br/>find on him was how preposterously all over the board what I was<br/>reading was... What an amazing (and often completely contradictory)<br/>mishmash of reactions and appraisals!</p><p>But I think that that is probably a healthy (and no doubt fascinating)<br/>part of what Ives was able to accomplish... I think Swafford seems to<br/>be stressing something much like this is his book as well when he<br/>writes:</p><p>&quot;Certainly Ives has not unequivocally triumphed. His work sounds<br/>peculiar to many people, and that is all right. He probably always<br/>will sound that way to listeners and musicians who ask for elegance<br/>and clarity of sound, because Ives did not much care about those<br/>things. Ives may never be a full-fledged standard composer, his work<br/>in the standard repertoire and among its certified masterpieces. The<br/>fact is, I would hate to see him subjected to that fate and am sure he<br/>would hate it too. Ives flayed the settled, the standard, the<br/>predictable. He will forever be the maverick, the great exception.<br/>More than any other artist on his level, he reminds us that greatness<br/>is not merely a matter of polish but of spirit, of substance rather<br/>than manner. He will remain a challenge to all of us and a threat to<br/>some. That is all right.&quot; (Jan Swafford, _A Life with Music_, p. 432)</p><p>Dan</p></div>
