It has two one-step interval sizes, the larger of which is 166.015 cents and the smaller one is 73.985 cents. If you stack 5L + 5S, you get an octave. But we definitely don&apos;t want to get two 5-EDO chains in this case so the pattern of LSLSLSLSLS is probably not the best choice. Instead, we can make a good 11-limit temperament if we know that:<br/>A) 3L approximates 4/3,<br/>B) 1L + 2S approximates 6/5,<br/>C) 1L + 3S approximates 5/4,<br/>D) 2L + 3S approximates 11/8.<br/>In order to have at least one approximation of 4/3 in the scale, it is necessary to have three L sizes in a row somewhere. So, for example, we can do it like LLLSSLSLSS, which makes the scale symmetrical from the fourth degree (supposing the 1/1 is the first degree(. I tried to demonstrate the nice properties of the scale in this small recording. For the time being, it&apos;s not a serious composition, so you can expect more from me later: <a href="http://download.yousendit.com/A7E3DC8D722CC6BD">http://download.yousendit.com/A7E3DC8D722CC6BD</a></p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2008 9:22:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&angst;&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know what this should be called, I don&apos;t know if someone<br/>&gt; has already mentioned this, I just know that this is not a linear<br/>&gt; temperament but it certainly is a temperament.<br/>//<br/>&gt; <a href="http://download.yousendit.com/A7E3DC8D722CC6BD">http://download.yousendit.com/A7E3DC8D722CC6BD</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;</p><p>I like that timbre.
