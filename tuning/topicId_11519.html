I have a question regarding the maths of<br/>this operation.  The programme JI Calc gives the ratio 977/942 for 19<br/>tet, and the ratio 4233/4178 for 53 tet. I would be grateful if anyone<br/>could tell me how these are derived and how I could work out the ratio<br/>needed to generate 22 tet.  I would like to make sure that the luthier<br/>and I agree on figures as the luthiers I know in Edinburgh rarely if<br/>ever do unconventional jobs. I would be extremely grateful for help on<br/>this point.</p></div>
