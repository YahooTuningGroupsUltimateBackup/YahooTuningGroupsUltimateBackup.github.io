Entries are open until 23:59:59 October 31st 2009 GMT</p><p>5. Voting starts 00:00:00 November 1st 2009 GMT and ends November 7th 2009 GMT</p><p>I hope more microtonalists besides Oz will enter - this is a good opportunity to go head to head with the 12 Tet muggles as it were :-)</p><p>And also - a reminder that when voting starts everyone and anyone can vote. I think it would be awesome for a microtonal composition (like the one Oz posted) to place or even win! I will post voting instructions at the deadline.</p><p>(PS - I will clean up my Xenharmonic blog posts when voting starts - my intent was to show the level of interest there was - not a sure thing - I&apos;ve not run a competition before.)</p></div>
