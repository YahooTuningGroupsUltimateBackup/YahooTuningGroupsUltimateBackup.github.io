(Though I might be open to other<br/>&gt;   ways of notation even at this date.)<br/>&gt;    I&apos;m just going to throw this out to the group...What if there was<br/>&gt;   a software (freeware) program that would automatically take any<br/>&gt;   notation and convert it to what I (or someone else) has gotten<br/>&gt;   used to. Coming up with a one size fits all approach may be the<br/>&gt;   best idea, but then again there is Esperanto. Proposed in 1887, it<br/>&gt;   was supposed to be the universal spoken and written language. Dr.<br/>&gt;   L. L. Zamenhof took parts of several languages and made one. Does<br/>&gt;   anyone you know speak Esperanto?<br/>&gt;     My idea is to have software (any programmers out there) that<br/>&gt;   would take a 4 digit microprinted number next to a note. [look at<br/>&gt;   a new 20 dollar bill, go to the right of the lower left number&apos;20&apos;<br/>&gt;   to see &quot;The United States of America...&quot; to see how small and<br/>&gt;   unobtrusive microprinting can be.] The microprinting would be read<br/>&gt;   by the software and converted to the composers own format. The 4<br/>&gt;   digit number would be the number of cents up from the tonic that<br/>&gt;   the note in question is.<br/>&gt;     Over time (50 years?) I would think one or two standards for<br/>&gt;   15 EDO (and all other EDO&apos;s) would emerge on their own just<br/>&gt;   because some are logical and most aren&apos;t.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Stephen Szpak</p><p>***I guess this might be possible, but I don&apos;t really see the utility<br/>for it since people, most notably Dave Keenan and George Secor, who<br/>have *lots* of experience, are designing an overall system (called<br/>Sagittal) that does this very thing.  I would seriously consider<br/>Dave&apos;s suggestions regarding the notation of 15-tET and you should<br/>post your *own* system to this forum.  I almost *guarantee* that<br/>there will be reasons why the Keenan/Secor system will be better.<br/>(I&apos;ll take bets now...)</p><p>Also, it&apos;s a little silly not to just use cents notation directly, if<br/>that&apos;s the kind of notation you want.  This is the approach used by<br/>Johnny Reinhard... just using cents values above the pitches, and he<br/>considers it a *universal* system, so there is really no reason why a<br/>*computer* needs to do it.</p><p>Computers are great, but they don&apos;t have to butt into<br/>*everything... :)</p><p>J. Pehrson</p><p>   J. Pehrson</p><p>     I&apos;ll have to look at these other systems eventually. But what I was trying to say is if<br/>  all the notes had a cent value (and a octave number) ,  2-0100  for example, would be<br/>  octave 2, the C#.  Then this designation could be used for any format. In other words<br/>  if someone sets up 15 EDO with 3 groups of 5 lines and someone else does something<br/>  totally different, the software could in theory, take one and convert to the other.<br/>     I suppose my comments are based on more ignorance than knowledge.
