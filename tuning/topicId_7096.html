My name is Jessica and I am doing a science/math project. I am study<br/>how different chemicals applied to clarinet reeds affect the intonation of<br/>notes.</p><p>++++Sarn says:</p><p>This sort of thing always interested me.</p><p>This is the kind of experimentation I used to do as a child, and, I have a<br/>veiw to physicalmodeling experiments with this sort of thing.</p><p>*****I was searching on the net for some information about intonation,<br/>where I happened to come across your website.</p><p>+++++Welcome aboard!!!</p><p>(Please list owner, send this to her).</p><p>******It had a lot of information that was interesting, but only a little<br/>amount that was applicable to my<br/>project. In my experiment, I used 4 size 3 V12 Vandoren Bb clarinet reeds. I<br/>played a Concert Bb with all 4 of the reeds and recorded the intonation off<br/>of my automatic chromatic tuner set on 440 as the pitch. I soaked a reed in<br/>orange juice, another in vinegar, the 3rd in vegetable oil, and the last in<br/>sugar water. I allowed them to be immersed for 5 minutes.</p><p>+++++Not that I am challengeing this experiment, but I feel that they should<br/>have been emersed for about a week for the juicy goodness to REALLY sink in.</p><p>****I took them out  and let them dry, and then I played the Concert Bb<br/>again. I took the initial<br/>and final readings and compared the change. The results were that the<br/>vinegar affected the reed the most. I&apos;m not sure if this is part of your<br/>expertise, for this project is kinda &quot;different&quot;, however, i was wondering<br/>if you could tell me what causes the intonation fluctuations with the added<br/>substances and if there is a more accurate way of calculating the intonation<br/>changes besides subtracting the initial and final readings off of the tuner.</p><p>+++++This experiment, and question could have me typeing for about four<br/>hours, and still not finish.</p><p>I feel intuitively that William Sethares and Brian McLaren would love this<br/>sort of thing, and I can see that there are certain limitations of &quot;merely&quot;<br/>designing a unit gong of unit size of unit strikeing enegry of unit<br/>strikeing position etc.... and changeing only its composition, and acessing<br/>the raw data from sonograms produced.</p><p>When trying to apply a generalization as in terms of a mathematical formula,<br/>model, whathave you, it is noteworthy that these thing break down at<br/>extremes, as all formulae modeling a physical system do.</p><p>And, subtle nucance in shape of a horns curvature would DRASTICALLY effect<br/>the sound!</p><p>Little did I realise HOW MUCH alloy composition of whatever instruement<br/>would RADICALLY effect the sound it produced, and I have a need to know the<br/>epistemological classification of whatever branch of science pertaining to<br/>the acoustical propertys of alloys/materials.</p><p>I have read engineering and materials science textbooks about Creep<br/>strength, Poisson&apos;s ratio, tensile strenght, and these provide a VERY rough<br/>and ready basis for materials analysis and classification, however, when we<br/>want to do REALLY alternative/kinky/exotic/weird experiments, like repeated<br/>exponentionally increasing loads over a 2 month period, these &quot;base<br/>information packages&quot; would breakdown.</p><p>My point being,-with a few raw informational sonograms, how the hell can we<br/>predice how a clarinet reed will sound if soaked in copper sulphate<br/>solution, radioactive substances, gold dust etc..?</p><p>These questions have very real implications for experimental music,-physical<br/>modeling and music based on pure mathematics, in my honest opinion are the<br/>next big thing.</p><p>In addition to this, wood is a complex substance, as is bone, bamboo etc....</p><p>******If and when you have time, i would greatly appreciate your reply.<br/>Thank you<br/>very much. :)</p><p>++++I would love to talk with you about these concepts, anytime.</p><p>Study well!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Sarn to....</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Jessica<br/>11th grade student<br/>Lyman High School<br/>Longwood, FL</p><p>******I&apos;m not much of a reed player myself, but I would imagine that if<br/>soaking<br/>the reed in different liquids caused intonational changes, they&apos;d just be<br/>compensated for in practice by adjusting the length of the &quot;tuning barrel&quot;<br/>(or whatever it&apos;s called, we trombonists call it a tuning slide).</p><p>I presume that as you&apos;re changing reeds in your experiment, you&apos;re being<br/>careful to put the mouthpiece/barrel back on in the same tuning position<br/>(perhaps fully closed/shortened).  I guess a thicker reed might cause the<br/>clarinet to appear slightly shorter, resulting in a slightly higher pitch.<br/>So if soaking the reed made it thicker, maybe you&apos;d get a higher note.</p><p>Your experiment may also result in changes in &quot;timbre&quot;, maybe causing less<br/>of a &quot;clarinetty&quot; sound.  But your tuner won&apos;t help you measure that.<br/>Clarinets are almost the only instrument whose &quot;frequency spectrum&quot; has<br/>only odd harmonics (it skips the even harmonics because the tube is closed<br/>at one end).  This give clarinets that &quot;oo&quot; sound (as in mOOn).</p><p>Regarding your method of calculating the intonation changes, it would make<br/>more sense to divide your readings instead of subtracting them, since pitch<br/>is geometric rather than arithmetic.  For example, to go up an octave, you<br/>double the frequency.  &quot;Cents&quot; are commonly used as a unit of measurement<br/>for intervals; 1200 cents = 1 octave.</p><p>Anyway, perhaps some of the tuning list folk can better assist you.  Many<br/>of them are performers, some of them are instrument builders.  And your<br/>topic sounds relevant to expermental musical instrument design.</p><p>Good luck (and happy T-day)!<br/>--Mark (<a href="mailto:nowitzky@alum.mit.edu">nowitzky@alum.mit.edu</a>, AKA <a href="mailto:tuning-owner@onelist.com">tuning-owner@onelist.com</a>)</p><p>++++++Excellent points.</p></div>
