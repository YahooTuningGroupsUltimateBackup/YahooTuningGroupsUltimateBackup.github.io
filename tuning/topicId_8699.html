Two<br/>&gt; questions:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. Does anybody know of any written recently for small mean-tome<br/>&gt; clavichord? (anybody want to write some?) Everything I&apos;ve got seems to<br/>&gt; need 5 octaves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. I have some 20th century Serbo-Croatian piano music that I love on<br/>&gt; clavichord; what tuning would be the most appropriate?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Judith Conrad, Clavichord Player (<a href="mailto:jconrad@tiac.net">jconrad@tiac.net</a>)<br/>&gt; Music Minister, Calvary Baptist Church, Providence, RI<br/>&gt; Director of Fall River Fipple Fluters<br/>&gt; Piano and Harpsichord Tuner-Technician</p></div><h3>Judith Conrad &#x3C;jconrad@shell1.tiac.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2000 10:04:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, 19 Feb 2000, Wim Hoogewerf wrote:</p><p>&gt; Judith, I know about the Finnish harpsichord player and composer Jukka<br/>&gt; Tiensuu.

Triple-fretted meantone clavichord<br/>is not just another color of keyboard. The triple-fretting going down deep<br/>into the tenor octave means that 3 adjacent notes share a string pair and<br/>can&apos;t be played simultaneously. This isn&apos;t that much of a problem in 17th<br/>century music, they seldom used chords such as say dominant seventh in<br/>inversion where two notes only one whole step apart were in the chord. But<br/>in music of the last 2 1/2 centuries it happens all the time, and writing<br/>around this isn&apos;t going to happen without conscious effort!</p><p>Double-fretted clavichords have a sensible layout of one string per<br/>&apos;natural&apos;, with 5 of them per octave shared with an accidental; in<br/>mean-tone keys this seldom causes problems (and in fact in the Well<br/>Tempered Clavier even in the remote keys the frets don&apos;t cause that much<br/>trouble). But there is no particular sense to the pattern of sharing of<br/>strings in a triple-fretted, at least none that baroque composition brings<br/>out. The one nice thing is that you can set 3 perfect thirds in your<br/>&apos;temperament&apos; octave (assuming properly-placed-at-the-&apos;factory&apos; frets, and<br/>you have nothing left to tune but octaves.</p><p>Judy</p></div>
