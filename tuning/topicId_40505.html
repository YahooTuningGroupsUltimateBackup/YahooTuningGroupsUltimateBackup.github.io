The harmonic minor 7th are calculated from F-7Eb.</p><p>C     C#          7D            D       D#/7Eb        E            7F<br/>    F           F#<br/>0   76.053   152.016   193.158   269.211   386.316   462.369    503.421<br/>579.474</p><p>    7G           G       G# /7Ab       7A           A        A#/7Bb         B<br/>             7C<br/>655.527   696.579   772.632   848.685   889.737   965.790   1082.895<br/>1158.948</p><p>  C2<br/>1200</p><p>The major 3rds and minor 6ths are &quot;pure,&quot; off the theoretical values just<br/>enough to be out of phase.<br/>Major triads are F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#-D#/7Eb-A#/7Bb-7F-7C-5ths-7G-7D-7A.<br/>The major triads F-C-G-D-A-E-B have harmonic minor 7ths.<br/>The flat triads bII, bIII, bVI, and bVII are available.<br/>The scale will play C, 7c and e.</p><p>This scale has the advantage over my JT scale in that the F7 chord is<br/>included, thus allowing playing on one manual.</p><p>However, my JT scale has just-tempered 5ths worth 700 cents.And the major<br/>3rds, minor 3rds, major 6ths, minor 6ths, minor 7ths, and diminished I, III,<br/>IV, VII are all &quot;pure&quot;! And the flatted chords also have harmonic minor 7ths.<br/>So my JT Phillips scale is superior to the Meantone scale.</p><p>I&apos;d rather use three manuals, each with seven split digitals per octave per<br/>key signature, to play my scale than to compromise as much as the Meantone<br/>scale does.</p><p>MT suggests compositions are composed in whole in key signatures. When in<br/>fact my scale proves key signatures apply to phrases. Thus music written in C<br/>major may use the F, C, and G scales, and sometimes a flatted scale. And thus<br/>justifies using up to three differently-tuned manuals to play a compositon.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Pauline W.
