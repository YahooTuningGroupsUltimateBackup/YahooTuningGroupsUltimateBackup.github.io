It&apos;s<br/>a shame that they have been given such berth of liberty to the<br/>detriment of others and betters.</p><p>I am forced to block one more such person to stop the sheer load of<br/>useless mails cluttering my mailbox.

I recommend 5.&quot;</p><p>    Not a bad idea...so long as it&apos;s implemented on all members and no type of<br/>members (including not moderators, PHDs etc.) are omitted.  It would force<br/>people to chose their words wisely.</p><p>    It would be nice to be able to just send out messages and not have tons of<br/>replies from the same 1-2 people (out of hundreds on the list) often not<br/>seriously focused on trying to solve the problem in question but instead on<br/>their own agendas.  I just posted an honest message on Tenney Height in a<br/>response to a post from Igs...and it took me a 3 message run-around just to get<br/>my idea across...and only then did I get a &quot;good idea, let&apos;s work on solving<br/>this&quot; response from it.</p><p>     If people don&apos;t like my questions or anyone else&apos;s, they reserve the right<br/>not to respond or even simply say &quot;I don&apos;t think this is worth<br/>answering...&quot;...but I wish they would keep it at that.  Perhaps making a quota<br/>would force them to do this as they will realize it&apos;s much more productive to<br/>spend those messages trying to solve problems than switch topics, crack extended<br/>off-topic jokes, or repeatedly insult other members.</p></div><h3><a id=92627 href="#92627">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/9/2010 8:59:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Sep 9, 2010 at 11:19 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On Thu, Sep 9, 2010 at 11:09 PM, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I am forced to block one more such person to stop the sheer load of<br/>&gt;&gt; useless mails cluttering my mailbox.

The last<br/>month, of course, I spent in Haiti, so I can&apos;t say much about that. By<br/>a yahoo search count, the leaders of the past few days are Carl, Mike<br/>S, Gene, Igs, and myself. But aside from the argument yesterday over<br/>consonance, the discussion on here has been very productive and<br/>spirited for this last week, and is the list not all the better for<br/>it? It seems undesirable that the list get bogged down in off-topic<br/>nonsense, but desirable that it be highly active for actual research,<br/>which is what has been taking place in the last few days.</p><p>Is it not, then, a bit silly to try and impose a wall on productive<br/>conversation for a list whose entire purpose is devoted to just that?<br/>There is a daily digest feature for people who would prefer to not get<br/>bombarded with emails all at once. Perhaps it&apos;s more appropriate for<br/>you to do that rather than demand that everyone else curtail<br/>legitimate on-topic conversation for the sake of your personal inbox.<br/>Or perhaps create a filter to put tuning in a separate folder, so that<br/>you can keep it aside from your personal stuff.</p><p>Whatever Carl or Gene or whoever the mod team is at this point decides<br/>is fine with me, but that&apos;s my two cents. Of course, I could be the<br/>inane figure who is apparently so incompetent with tuning that you<br/>just blocked, so perhaps you aren&apos;t even getting this message at all.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=92632 href="#92632">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/9/2010 11:10:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>With all due respect, Dr. Oz, you have a variety of delivery options at your disposal to manage the quantity of incoming e-mails.
