If you want to make music: all the SW is<br/>stacked against the microtonalist. Not /one/ commercial product includes<br/>microtonal support as an /inherent/ component of the possibilities for<br/>music making. Add-ons that some provide are second-rate, friday jobs, not<br/>worth the characters they&apos;re written with.</p><p>And so on...</p><p>I really can&apos;t waste my time explaining - there are plenty on this list who<br/>know the /real/ position.
