I have just begun to work on it, as I am using it<br/>in a play I&apos;m involved with, here in Denver. One of the characters in<br/>the show is a guitarist, who rides the subways in NYC, and he&apos;s starting<br/>to hear/play microtonally, but it&apos;s confusing him, because it&apos;s just<br/>sort of coming through him, while he&apos;s trying to play other stuff, such<br/>as blues. The 31 works great in this scenario, because I can use it for<br/>both 12 tone imitations, and to sound unlike 12. I&apos;ll play some slide<br/>blues licks, then segue into an Eastern sounding riff, to show that<br/>Tsubo is out of the 12 tone system. Later on, we use it in a scene where<br/>Tsubo moves from Bach to country to gospel to free jazz; it&apos;s very easy<br/>to do this on 31, because it can sound more like 12 eq than 12 eq<br/>itself, the, because of the teensy intervals, there&apos;s no doubt it&apos;s<br/>microtonal.<br/>    I&apos;ve just started working with it, so time will deepen my<br/>impressions of 31. I do know that I like all of the 7 limit intervals;<br/>they give what I call a &quot;hollow&quot; sound, and on guitar, lie under the<br/>fingers well. I also like the way chords &quot;shimmer&quot; in this tuning...it&apos;s<br/>really a lovely system for chords, and I can see writing some very heavy<br/>chordal works in 31 down the road. It&apos;s easier to manage than 34, which<br/>has 2 sizes of whole step, and is really tricky to deal with. We tried<br/>34 in this play, and it was just not happening...thanks for writing,<br/>take care...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=63268 href="#63268">ðŸ”—</a>Neil Haverstick &#x3C;microstick@msn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/1/2006 12:32:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Since Gene just mentioned 31, I wanted to make a comment...although I&apos;ve had a 31 eq guitar for about 10 years, I haven&apos;t yet composed in it, but lately I&apos;ve started to mess with it a bit.

Do you hear it that way? &apos;Cuz I don&apos;t remember you<br/>ever saying you had a problem with the fifths and fourths in 19-<br/>equal, and 31-equal should be even better for those intervals.</p><p>Just curious.</p></div><h3><a id=63317 href="#63317">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2006 8:26:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve grown to like the effect of slightly detuned fifths...</p><p>What would you regard as an optimal detuning, and do you prefer sharp<br/>or flat fifths?</p></div><h3><a id=63333 href="#63333">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2006 1:51:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve grown to like the effect of slightly detuned fifths...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What would you regard as an optimal detuning,<br/>&gt; and do you prefer sharp<br/>&gt; or flat fifths?</p><p>Both :) 19-equal and 22-equal both sound great once you&apos;ve accepted<br/>their &quot;active&quot; fifths, 7 cents off JI but in opposite directions. And<br/>with certain timbres, you can get away with a lot more deviation than<br/>that. What&apos;s an optimal detuning? It all depends on the vibe you&apos;re<br/>going for, and then how the other intervals are tuned. If the ratios of<br/>5 are pretty good, as in 19-equal and 22-equal, the fifths impart the<br/>sort of active quality to the triads that you&apos;d expect from 12-equal,<br/>though the triads still have more harmonic clarity than in 12. Bare<br/>fifths in 19 or 22, especially in the higher registers, can be<br/>irritating compared to the near-pure fifths of 12, though -- so I tend<br/>to avoid them or add more notes to the sonority if possible.</p><p>There&apos;s certainly a time and place for JI, though! So I&apos;d hesitate to<br/>deem any particular detuning &quot;optimal&quot;.</p></div>
