Whether that significance has<br/>anything to do with music is another matter, since as<br/>i just pointed out above these kinds of discrepancies<br/>can be found in other measuring systems too. But i think<br/>the fact that Plato actually invokes descriptions of<br/>music and tuning argues in favor of at least some of<br/>McClain&apos;s interpretation.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
