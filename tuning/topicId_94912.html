There are only so many hours in the day, and these synths are freeware. At some stage, we would like to support different temperaments. But note that the choice of temperament affects only the way the spectrum is tempered and the JI notes at the top and bottom of the diamond and the displayed range of the tuning slider - but you can go to any tuning by scrolling the number box below the slider.</p><p>Andy</p><p>&gt;  Why are there 120 spaces<br/>&gt; for instrument presets and only three temperaments?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2010 12:09:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;andymilneuk&quot; &lt;ANDYMILNE@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; I must say I&apos;m pretty clueless as to how it works.<br/>&gt; &gt; What&apos;s going on in that rhombus?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When the control dot is as far to the left as it can be, the<br/>&gt; partials are perfectly harmonic; when it is as far to the right<br/>&gt; as it can be, the partials are fully matched to the tuning set<br/>&gt; by the big generator tuning slider (using a mapping according<br/>&gt; to the choice of temperament).<br/>&gt; When the dot is at the top or bottom of the diamond, the tuning<br/>&gt; is 5-limit JI.

For example, D-sharp can be represented by MIDI note number 63, MIDI channel 1; whereas, E-flat can be represented by MIDI note number 63, MIDI channel 2.</p><p>In this way, 2032 maintains backwards compatibility with traditional hardware and software MIDI controllers and sequencers, whilst still enabling the new feature of being able to differentiate between the tunings of sharps and flats in certain tunings. We hope that this should ease the introduction of Dynamic Tonality synthesizers into conventional sequencing environments. The mapping also means that Hex can be used to control conventional 12-TET synthesizers.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2010 9:15:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;andymilneuk&quot; &lt;ANDYMILNE@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure what you mean...maybe the spreadsheet will<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; answer your question.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Er...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, here&apos;s a possibly more helpful response (if not, let me know):<br/>&gt;</p><p>So it&apos;s designed to play from ordinary keyboards?<br/>I was hoping it would make it easier to audition layouts on<br/>my AXiS.

As you must know, there is no one MIDI mapping that can provide universal compatibility. For that reason we have designed it to be &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; compatible with traditional MIDI controllers (e.g. MIDI sequencers or Halbertsadt keyboards) when using traditional (syntonic) tunings.</p><p>If using a MIDI controller like AXiS, you&apos;ll have to remap the MIDI yourself (outside 2032 or Hex). That&apos;s why I linked to the spreadsheet so you can work out how to do the mapping.</p><p>&gt; I was hoping it would make it easier to audition layouts on<br/>&gt; my AXiS.  Especially with Hex and all...</p><p>Presumably this would require for me to add a mapping from AXiS to DT (to make, for example, a Wicki layout), and then use Hex as a conduit that would automatically remap the MIDI as its layout mapping is changed (e.g., when using the adjacent seconds layouts, I hope to add to the next version) - so the layout used by AXiS automatically matches that set by Hex.</p><p>That&apos;s a very good idea, and would be very cool, but would require a substantial amount of work. In the meantime, you could probably use musicscienceguys&apos;s application that remaps the AXiS to wicki - that should, I think, work with 2032 for the central 12 columns of the AXiS at least.</p><p>Andy</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/2010 12:47:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;andymilneuk&quot; &lt;ANDYMILNE@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s a very good idea, and would be very cool, but would require<br/>&gt; a substantial amount of work.
