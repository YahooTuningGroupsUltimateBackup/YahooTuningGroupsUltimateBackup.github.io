And, to<br/>get right down to it, I don&apos;t hear a strong VF for 3/2 either. It&apos;s<br/>not this strong, obvious thing, but something more subtle that I have<br/>to look for. There&apos;s a huge difference between &quot;3/2&quot; and &quot;a harmonic<br/>series minus 1/1&quot; in my perception. I &quot;can hear it if I try to look<br/>for it,&quot; but there&apos;s a lot of looking needed. In fact, I &quot;can hear it&quot;<br/>for 13/10 as well if I really try - I&apos;ve been known to put it on in<br/>the background for hours at a time while I work until I hear it fuse -<br/>but it&apos;s not like that&apos;s just how I hear it if you play a piece of<br/>music.</p><p>What makes it less obvious is if I hear a ton of 3/2&apos;s played in<br/>parallel, using a really chilled out timbre, so I can hear all of the<br/>partials moving together, in a high register.

That<br/>doesn&apos;t really happen too much in music, though, even with parallel<br/>fifths on a piano; something about that situation doesn&apos;t make it<br/>fuse. Something about the onset of attack, maybe, or the complexity of<br/>the timbre being used, just stops the magic from happening.</p><p>If some of you don&apos;t know at all what I&apos;m talking about, just try this<br/>experiment: go to a drawbar organ, like a Hammond B3, and put on only<br/>the drawbars corresponding to the first and third harmonic. If you<br/>don&apos;t have an organ like this, then load up a two-oscillator synth,<br/>set the timbres to a sine wave, and set the two oscillators up so that<br/>one is 3/1 higher than the other one. Make sure, when you do, that you<br/>can hear this 3/1 clearly as an extra note. Then, play a really fast<br/>line, and some chords, and go back to the note you started on and<br/>listen to the sound now.</p><p>For me, I hear the whole thing as suddenly &quot;fusing&quot; significantly<br/>after this point, and sounds like one note with a somewhat audible<br/>&quot;harmonic.&quot; Then play some quick melodic line and some chords and go<br/>back to your original note and see if it sounds anything like that<br/>anymore. There&apos;s something about hearing the partials all moving<br/>together which makes the whole thing &quot;fuse,&quot; and I find this is true<br/>even for inharmonic timbres like marimba; I know that it&apos;s more<br/>inharmonic but still hear it fuse into a single timbre or something.<br/>So in this case the concept of all of the harmonics moving<br/>synchronously as in a single auditory stream is more important than<br/>how periodic they are as far as timbral fusion is concerned.

Within music,<br/>there&apos;s some great research on this subject on David Huron&apos;s page -<br/>these notes on voice leading, which many on XA have been reading (but<br/>which I have yet to fully read myself), has some great notes on it:</p><p><a href="http://www.music-cog.ohio-state.edu/Huron/Publications/huron.voice.leading.html">http://www.music-cog.ohio-state.edu/Huron/Publications/huron.voice.leading.html</a></p><p>See here:</p><p>&quot;The clarity of pitch perceptions has been simulated systematically in<br/>a model of pitch formulated by Terhardt, Stoll and Seewann (1982a,<br/>1982b). For both pure and complex tones, the model calculates a pitch<br/>weight, which may be regarded as an index of the pitch&apos;s clarity, and<br/>therefore, a measure of toneness. For pitches evoked by pure tones<br/>(so-called &quot;spectral pitches&quot;), sensitivity is most acute in the<br/>spectral dominance region -- a broad region centered near 700 Hz.<br/>Pitches evoked by complex tones (so-called &quot;virtual pitches&quot;)<br/>typically show the greatest pitch weight when the evoked or actual<br/>fundamental lies in a broad region centered near 300 Hz -- roughly D4<br/>immediately above middle C (Terhardt, Stoll, Schermbach, &amp; Parncutt,<br/>1986).&quot;</p><p>So for us, we should expect to hear the strongest VF for 5/4 if it&apos;s<br/>played with the lower note about 2 octaves above middle C. That&apos;s<br/>pretty consistent with my experience.</p><p>However, it should be noted that he uses this to refer to harmonic vs<br/>inharmonic timbres! NOT for chords. The whole point here is to develop<br/>some of these observations into an argument for the notion that<br/>harmonic timbres are better for voice leading, for something like<br/>polyphonic counterpoint, than inharmonic ones. He claims that it makes<br/>it easiest to figure out what the actual pitches that are moving<br/>around are.</p><p>---</p><p>So onto &quot;Tonal fusion&quot; - has this to say:</p><p>&quot;Tonal fusion is the tendency for some concurrent sound combinations<br/>to cohere into a single sound image. Tonal fusion arises most commonly<br/>when the auditory system interprets certain frequency combinations as<br/>comprising partials of a single complex tone (DeWitt &amp; Crowder, 1987).<br/>Two factors are known to affect tonal fusion: (1) the frequency ratio<br/>of the component tones, and (2) their spectral content. Tonal fusion<br/>is most probable when the combined spectral content conforms to a<br/>single hypothetical harmonic series. This occurs most commonly when<br/>the frequencies of the component tones are related by simple integer<br/>ratios.&quot;</p><p>---</p><p>He then goes on and talks about tonal fusion and consonance:</p><p>&quot;Following Stumpf, many music researchers have assumed that tonal<br/>fusion and tonal consonance are the same phenomenon, and that both<br/>arise from simple integer frequency ratios. However, the extant<br/>psychoacoustic research does not support Stumpf&apos;s view. Bregman (1990)<br/>has noted that the confusion arises from conflating &quot;smooth sounding&quot;<br/>with &quot;sounding as one.&quot; As we have seen, work by Greenwood (1961a,<br/>1990, 1991), Plomp and Levelt (1965), Kameoka and Kuriyagawa (1969a,<br/>1969b), and Iyer, Aarden, Hoglund and Huron (1999) implicates critical<br/>band distances in the perception of tonal consonance or sensory<br/>dissonance. This work shows that sensory dissonance is only indirectly<br/>related to harmonicity or tonal fusion.&quot;</p><p>Well, that&apos;s interesting. Well, I&apos;m not sure I necessarily agree that<br/>critical band distances are the &quot;magic bullet&quot; either, or else mavila<br/>would be intolerable, but to some extent I do agree with this -<br/>because the intolerableness of mavila does somewhat correlate with the<br/>harshness of the timbre that you use. Anyway, the &quot;it&apos;s not VFs that<br/>are important, it&apos;s beating!&quot; line is just as played out to me as the<br/>&quot;it&apos;s not beating that&apos;s important, it&apos;s VFs!&quot; line. But probably the<br/>thing that&apos;s most relevant is here:</p><p>---</p><p>&quot;Whether or not tonal fusion is a musically desirable phenomenon<br/>depends on the music-perceptual goal. In Huron (1991b), it was shown<br/>that in the polyphonic writing of J.S. Bach, tonally fused harmonic<br/>intervals are avoided in proportion to the strength with which each<br/>interval promotes tonal fusion. That is, unisons occur less frequently<br/>than octaves, which occur less frequently than perfect fifths, which<br/>occur less frequently than other intervals. Of course concurrent<br/>octaves and concurrent fifths occur regularly in music, but<br/>(remarkably) they occur less frequently in polyphonic music than they<br/>would in a purely random juxtaposition of voices... **Note that this<br/>observation is independent of the avoidance of parallel unisons,<br/>fifths, or octaves. As simple static harmonic intervals, these<br/>intervals are actively avoided in Bach&apos;s polyphonic works.**<br/>Considering the importance of octaves and fifths in the formation of<br/>common chords, their active avoidance is a remarkable feat (see Huron,<br/>1991b).&quot;</p><p>Well, that&apos;s really interesting. So he&apos;s saying that as a part of<br/>Bach&apos;s desire to promote auditory stream segregation between the four<br/>voices, he systematically avoids using the intervals most likely to<br/>fuse. I think that&apos;s really interesting.</p><p>---</p><p>So finally, he says this:</p><p>&quot;In light of the research on tonal fusion, we may formulate the<br/>following principle:</p><p>4. Tonal Fusion Principle. The perceptual independence of concurrent<br/>tones is weakened when their pitch relations promote tonal fusion.<br/>Intervals that promote tonal fusion include (in decreasing order):<br/>unisons, octaves, perfect fifths, ... Where the goal is the perceptual<br/>independence of concurrent sounds, intervals ought to be shunned in<br/>direct proportion to the degree to which they promote tonal fusion.&quot;</p><p>---</p><p>This is his conjecture, mind you, and I also suspect there&apos;s a lot<br/>more to it than that. But, that&apos;s his conclusion from all of this. I<br/>think it&apos;s rather interesting to think about, especially when we<br/>consider the role of VFs in something like music. Is a VF different<br/>from the tonal fusion of a set of harmonics into a VF? To what extent<br/>does it really matter?</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Mon, Jan 30, 2012 at 5:31 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, you&apos;re right.

However, I can imagine that one way that you<br/>might make 7-limit harmony fuse less is by doing what Huron suggested<br/>- systematically avoiding 2/1 and 3/2 as much as possible, while using<br/>things like 5/4 more. In the 11-limit, you have even more intervals<br/>which don&apos;t fuse readily, so you can use those intervals even more if<br/>you want.*</p><p>Anyway, there is one real problem with this Huron study, in that it<br/>may not be &quot;timbral fusion&quot; at all that we&apos;re concerned about: if it&apos;s<br/>really true that in Bach&apos;s case, he avoided 2/1 first and 3/2 second -<br/>not even in parallel but in general - it still may not make sense to<br/>just jump from that to talking about timbral fusion as the antithesis<br/>of voice leading. In this case, consider that octaves are also the<br/>most common interval in the diatonic scale, and fifths the second-most<br/>common, whereas thirds carry the most &quot;information&quot; in a certain<br/>sense.</p><p>This statement can be formulated quite precisely, in fact: consider<br/>the question, &quot;what if I play a random type of fifth in the diatonic<br/>scale?&quot; This implies a probability distribution: you have a 6/7 chance<br/>of playing a perfect fifth, and a 1/7 chance of playing a diminished<br/>fifth. The Shannon entropy of this distribution is obviously much<br/>lower than the entropy of the probability distribution of random types<br/>of thirds, which is maximal in the diatonic scale. And if you&apos;re<br/>working with a limited number of voices, you need to transmit as much<br/>information as possible, yes? So that&apos;d be another possible route to<br/>explore this question, one which is related to the scales Bach<br/>generally uses - and one which might be worth considering, as omitting<br/>octaves and fifths as &quot;less important&quot; is common practice even if<br/>we&apos;re not talking about counterpoint at all.</p><p>I&apos;ll post about this in more detail to tuning-math...</p><p>-Mike</p><p>*Important side question: if you&apos;re NOT playing these chords directly,<br/>you&apos;re going to have to hear them being &quot;implied&quot; in arpeggiations and<br/>other melodic figures, right? So you&apos;re not going to hear the magical<br/>psychoacoustic effects that are supposedly what makes us love them so<br/>much, right? In fact, that&apos;s what Huron&apos;s deliberately having us do<br/>with all this. Well, it&apos;s a good thing this magical unspoken feature<br/>exists, because it lets us recognize triadic harmony in 2 part<br/>inventions. The central question thus is: for novel, xenharmonic<br/>chords, do you have to have heard the whole chord at once, first, and<br/>its harmonic/psychoacoustic/magical voodoo effects first, before being<br/>able to &quot;recognize&quot; that chord being &quot;implied&quot; in an arpeggiation?</p></div><h3><a id=103361 href="#103361">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2012 7:08:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Feb 3, 2012 at 9:34 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This statement can be formulated quite precisely, in fact: consider<br/>&gt; the question, &quot;what if I play a random type of fifth in the diatonic<br/>&gt; scale?&quot; This implies a probability distribution: you have a 6/7 chance<br/>&gt; of playing a perfect fifth, and a 1/7 chance of playing a diminished<br/>&gt; fifth.

I think the essence of &quot;tonal&quot; music is<br/>that even if you&apos;re an idiot, you can still figure out what&apos;s going<br/>on, because the information about what&apos;s being &quot;implied&quot; is compressed<br/>in a neat sort of way which a guy named Schenker figured out. For<br/>instance, if you&apos;re a musical idiot and you hear &quot;Don&apos;t Worry, Be<br/>Happy,&quot; then at the very least you can hear some sense of the tonic<br/>the whole time. If you can tune in a bit more, then you can maybe<br/>follow tonic, and periodic departures to the dominant or subdominant<br/>which resolve back. If you can tune in even more, then you can follow<br/>individual chords, like I, ii, IV and V. And if you tune in even more,<br/>you might be able to track inversions of those chords. And if you tune<br/>in even more, you can hear passing tones on the harmony in the chorus<br/>implying the major II chord for all of an eighth note before abruptly<br/>disappearing, which is what you caught and I missed.</p><p>But even if you&apos;re an idiot, then you can still follow it.</p><p>Gene&apos;s music, on the other hand, is more inspired by Renaissance music<br/>- chords changing at rapid speed. But if you can&apos;t follow what&apos;s going<br/>on - if you&apos;re an 11-limit idiot - then the whole thing falls apart.<br/>If you&apos;re an 11-limit genius, though, it&apos;s probably exhilarating.

But the chord changes and harmonic rhythm aren&apos;t compressed in<br/>that nice way; there&apos;s not a heirarchical structure of impliedness<br/>which reveals finer discriminations as you tune in more.</p><p>Also, if you already know about Schenkerian analysis and want to model<br/>it using lossy compression techniques and Huffman codes, I want to<br/>have a conversation with you!</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=103372 href="#103372">ðŸ”—</a>clamengh &#x3C;clamengh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2012 5:31:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Keenan Pepper&gt; I really enjoy these, but I don&apos;t think any of them actually illustrate the &quot;higher limit harmony allows voices to be more independent&quot; idea under consideration.</p><p>Yes, you are definetely right.

This is why I&apos;d love it if Gene released a<br/>5-voice version with the chords explicitly spelled out, and then for<br/>us to listen to that, and then go back to this and see if we hear all<br/>of the implied chords a lot better. Or maybe just a 4-voice version<br/>with bass notes added. It&apos;d be like hearing a solo sax rendition of a<br/>jazz tune without knowing the tune, vs hearing it after when you do<br/>know the tune.</p><p>There&apos;s another thing going on, which is that the implied chords<br/>change really really fast. I think the essence of &quot;tonal&quot; music is<br/>that even if you&apos;re an idiot, you can still figure out what&apos;s going<br/>on, because the information about what&apos;s being &quot;implied&quot; is compressed<br/>in a neat sort of way which a guy named Schenker figured out. For<br/>instance, if you&apos;re a musical idiot and you hear &quot;Don&apos;t Worry, Be<br/>Happy,&quot; then at the very least you can hear some sense of the tonic<br/>the whole time. If you can tune in a bit more, then you can maybe<br/>follow tonic, and periodic departures to the dominant or subdominant<br/>which resolve back. If you can tune in even more, then you can follow<br/>individual chords, like I, ii, IV and V. And if you tune in even more,<br/>you might be able to track inversions of those chords. And if you tune<br/>in even more, you can hear passing tones on the harmony in the chorus<br/>implying the major II chord for all of an eighth note before abruptly<br/>disappearing, which is what you caught and I missed.</p><p>But even if you&apos;re an idiot, then you can still follow it.</p><p>Gene&apos;s music, on the other hand, is more inspired by Renaissance music<br/>- chords changing at rapid speed. But if you can&apos;t follow what&apos;s going<br/>on - if you&apos;re an 11-limit idiot - then the whole thing falls apart.<br/>If you&apos;re an 11-limit genius, though, it&apos;s probably exhilarating. I&apos;m<br/>like halfway between the two, so I can catch it coming in and out.</p><p>Most of us on here are probably halfway between total 11-limit idiot<br/>and Gene, who actually wrote the piece and knows what all the chords<br/>are. But the chord changes and harmonic rhythm aren&apos;t compressed in<br/>that nice way; there&apos;s not a heirarchical structure of impliedness<br/>which reveals finer discriminations as you tune in more.</p><p>Also, if you already know about Schenkerian analysis and want to model<br/>it using lossy compression techniques and Huffman codes, I want to<br/>have a conversation with you!</p><p>-Mike</p><p>------------------------------------</p><p>You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>Yahoo!

But why are 9/7 and 5/4 the ones being compared here? Someone with a 12-equal background will think something like &quot;sharp major third&quot; and &quot;in-tune major third&quot; when they hear them, but that doesn&apos;t mean that &quot;major third&quot;, or even &quot;third&quot;, is a universal property intrinsic to both of them. 9/7 is also a bad 4/3 but for some reason that comparison is made much less often.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Why &quot;tertian&quot;? Tertian just means &quot;made of thirds&quot;, and &quot;third&quot; &gt;just means &quot;interval between 200 and 500 cents&quot; (or whatever you &gt;want the boundaries to be). Why is that an important concept?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tertian chords are a historical concept, that is why they are important &quot;in order to be comparable with historical musics&quot;. Come on, higher limits being a &quot;natural progression&quot; in the tuning (and sheer existence for that matter) of ever taller tertian chords is a very old concept and it is silly to deny that a logical first place we to start testing the idea presenting is in a Just tuning of the seventh partial in a tertian seventh chord.</p><p>I disagree; I think &quot;tertian chord&quot; is an irrelevant concept. 4:5:6:7 is &quot;tertian&quot; and 4:7:8:9:10 is &quot;not tertian&quot;, but to me that seems like a useless thing to say.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Who&apos;s going to tell me that 10:12:15 is &quot;complete&quot; but 6:9:11 is &quot;incomplete&quot;? If I think of 6:9:11 as being &quot;complete&quot; and write music that reflects that, who are you to say &quot;no, that&apos;s incomplete; you need at least four voices&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And the vertical sonorities will fuse, in keeping with the original claims we are talking about? Remember that we are talking about the original claims, not about you, me, or music in general.</p><p>It depends what you mean by &quot;fuse&quot;, but I can&apos;t think of a way in which the &quot;fusion&quot; of 10:12:15 is significantly different from that of 6:9:11. (It&apos;s hard to tell because 10:12:15 sounds so familiar and 6:9:11 so unfamiliar, but psychoacoustically they&apos;re very similar.)</p><p>&gt; Simply put, using rational intervals, or accurate approximations thereof, while also using pitch classes, will result in pitch classes containing more than one pitch each, i.e. &quot;commas will happen&quot;. You don&apos;t notice what is happening in the little piece I put up? Neither do I, not really, even though it is a very heavy-handed effect and I know it&apos;s there.</p><p>First of all, I don&apos;t know what you mean when you say &quot;pitch class&quot;. I know of two meanings - the first is simply an equivalence class of octave-equivalent pitches, which can&apos;t be what you&apos;re talking about, and the second is based on 12-equal categories, like &quot;Bb&quot; is a pitch class. If that&apos;s what you mean by &quot;pitch class&quot; then you&apos;re taking a very pessimistic attitude toward xenharmonic music, because you&apos;re implying it will only ever be heard as variations or colorations of 12-equal and never as totally new, independent categories.</p><p>If I intentionally try to stay in &quot;gamelan mode&quot; (where there are pretty much only 5 &quot;pitch classes&quot; rather than 12), and listen to some chromatic Western music, the 12-equal music sounds like it&apos;s full of all these little comma shifts too. It&apos;s quite difficult to do this, of course, because I&apos;ve been exposed to the chromatic scale my whole life and gamelan music only 6 years, but sometimes I can keep from switching into 12-equal mode for a second and then it&apos;s like &quot;whoa, these white people have like 2 or 3 versions of every note&quot;. Clearly that&apos;s not something intrinsic to the music, but instead a result of mismatched/inappropriate categories.</p><p>So no, I don&apos;t agree that &quot;commas will happen&quot;.

It&apos;s also kind of lame that this was<br/>going on while my favorite genre of classical music was being invented<br/>over in France. Also, I&apos;m really not the biggest Schenkerian analysis<br/>buff; I know the basic concepts and how they&apos;re applied in some simple<br/>concepts and that&apos;s really it, I know there are some strange<br/>interpretations of it that I disagree with, like that a piece of music<br/>is one long drawn out I-V-I or something.</p><p>But you can&apos;t throw the baby out with the bathwater. There&apos;s an<br/>insight here which really does have relevance, which is that not only<br/>can chords be &quot;implied&quot; by a fragment of music, but that it&apos;s also<br/>possible to create a heirarchy of such layers. This is a pretty useful<br/>concept in jazz too, where if I&apos;m going to solo over a piece of music<br/>I need to be able to distinguish the underlying &quot;skeleton&quot; of the<br/>chord progression, which communicates the real essence of what&apos;s going<br/>on, from the idiomatic stuff being thrown on top of it.

Why is that an important concept?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Tertian chords are a historical concept, that is why they are important &quot;in order to be comparable with historical musics&quot;. Come on, higher limits being a &quot;natural progression&quot; in the tuning (and sheer existence for that matter) of ever taller tertian chords is a very old concept and it is silly to deny that a logical first place we to start testing the idea presenting is in a Just tuning of the seventh partial in a tertian seventh chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I disagree; I think &quot;tertian chord&quot; is an irrelevant concept. 4:5:6:7 is &quot;tertian&quot; and 4:7:8:9:10 is &quot;not tertian&quot;, but to me that seems like a useless thing to say.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Who&apos;s going to tell me that 10:12:15 is &quot;complete&quot; but 6:9:11 is &quot;incomplete&quot;? If I think of 6:9:11 as being &quot;complete&quot; and write music that reflects that, who are you to say &quot;no, that&apos;s incomplete; you need at least four voices&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And the vertical sonorities will fuse, in keeping with the original claims we are talking about? Remember that we are talking about the original claims, not about you, me, or music in general.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It depends what you mean by &quot;fuse&quot;, but I can&apos;t think of a way in which the &quot;fusion&quot; of 10:12:15 is significantly different from that of 6:9:11. (It&apos;s hard to tell because 10:12:15 sounds so familiar and 6:9:11 so unfamiliar, but psychoacoustically they&apos;re very similar.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Simply put, using rational intervals, or accurate approximations thereof, while also using pitch classes, will result in pitch classes containing more than one pitch each, i.e. &quot;commas will happen&quot;. You don&apos;t notice what is happening in the little piece I put up? Neither do I, not really, even though it is a very heavy-handed effect and I know it&apos;s there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First of all, I don&apos;t know what you mean when you say &quot;pitch class&quot;. I know of two meanings - the first is simply an equivalence class of octave-equivalent pitches, which can&apos;t be what you&apos;re talking about, and the second is based on 12-equal categories, like &quot;Bb&quot; is a pitch class. If that&apos;s what you mean by &quot;pitch class&quot; then you&apos;re taking a very pessimistic attitude toward xenharmonic music, because you&apos;re implying it will only ever be heard as variations or colorations of 12-equal and never as totally new, independent categories.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I intentionally try to stay in &quot;gamelan mode&quot; (where there are pretty much only 5 &quot;pitch classes&quot; rather than 12), and listen to some chromatic Western music, the 12-equal music sounds like it&apos;s full of all these little comma shifts too. It&apos;s quite difficult to do this, of course, because I&apos;ve been exposed to the chromatic scale my whole life and gamelan music only 6 years, but sometimes I can keep from switching into 12-equal mode for a second and then it&apos;s like &quot;whoa, these white people have like 2 or 3 versions of every note&quot;. Clearly that&apos;s not something intrinsic to the music, but instead a result of mismatched/inappropriate categories.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So no, I don&apos;t agree that &quot;commas will happen&quot;.

In 72 equal, 9/8 is 3.91 cents flat, 11/8 is 1.32 cents flat and 11/9 is 2.59 cents sharp.</p></div><h3><a id=103436 href="#103436">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2012 12:29:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lobawad&quot; &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Neither blackjack not wizard offer decent 11-limit chords.

Of course, in this case, and in the similar case of being taught to sharpen major thirds in certain places, we could argue that this sharpening is actually combatting a natural tendency to tune to 7/4, or to 5/4 in the case of thirds. Nevertheless the result, at least in the instances where the seventh chord is functioning as a dominant (V, V/V etc.), I don&apos;t think there is any serious doubt that the intonation is well sharp of 7/4. In &quot;common practice&quot; music and its close relatives, that is.

Of course the harmonic tuning can be used in a &quot;dominant seventh chord&quot;. I am sure that this happens, or happened in the pre-War era, in performances of even Wagner. But, when the dominant seventh chord is in a position of clear dominant function, V7-I or V7/V, we don&apos;t, as far as I&apos;ve ever heard or heard of, hear it intoned harmonically (in what we&apos;d call mainstream Western tonal music).</p><p>Conventional wisdom settled, as far as anything I&apos;ve ever seen, on the harmonic seventh as an intonational possibility for the augmented sixth and rejected it for the minor seventh.</p><p>Exceptions to this create very audible and very noticable stylistic and expressive signposts.

I think it good neither in theory or practice that the (unfortunately named) &quot;dominant seventh&quot; should never be harmonically tuned, or the harmonic limited to the augmented sixth. I also think that it is good neither in theory or practice to simply swap out the harmonic seventh for 16:9 or 9:5. Rather, as should be completely clear by my insistence on have a full complement of 7/6s and 6/5s in a 41-tET subset, I think a seventh chord should be tuned to one or the other according to feel, with the harmonic for more restful or flowing places and the 5-limit for driving (functionally dominant) places.

This distinction is certainly important to me when making music that is a continuation of Western tradition, rather than breaking with it as per usual.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There&apos;s consensus about something?? There&apos;s never consensus about anything.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I strongly disagree with the above. Barbershop quartets intone dominant seventh chords as 4:5:6:7 all the time and they&apos;re still dominant sevent chords. Nothing about the intonation &quot;causes them to no longer be &apos;dominant&apos;&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Speak up if you agree with me.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Keenan<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Come on Keenan, the whole world can see the cheap sophistry you&apos;re trying to pull here.

Nevertheless the result, at least in the instances where the seventh chord is functioning as a dominant (V, V/V etc.), I don&apos;t think there is any serious doubt that the intonation is well sharp of 7/4. In &quot;common practice&quot; music and its close relatives, that is.
