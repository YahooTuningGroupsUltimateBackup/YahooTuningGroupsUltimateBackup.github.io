One thing Zarlino did, after the original 1558 edition of _Le<br/>istitutioni harmoniche_, was to propose a new ordering, starting<br/>consistently from C. He also proposed new names for the modes in the<br/>_Dimostrationi_, 1571. He dropped the new names, but kept the revised<br/>numbering, starting on C, in the 1573 edition of _istitutione_.</p><p>Why the focus on C? Because it allowed an optimum harmonic division of the<br/>octave, with harmonic divisions of the endpoints with the arithmetic and<br/>harmonic means of the whole octave. There&apos;s a diagram, in book 1 I think,<br/>that shows all of this:</p><p>       octave divided harmonically<br/>   ______________________________________<br/>  |                      |               |</p><p>  5th divided harmonically<br/>   ______________________<br/>  |           |          |<br/>  C           E    F     G      A        C<br/>                   |____________|________|<br/>                    5th divided harmonically</p><p>  |________________|_____________________|<br/>       octave divided arithmetically</p><p>You can&apos;t get this starting on any other note.  The relation to Ptolemy&apos;s<br/>writings can be found in the middle of this scale - we get</p><p>             E     F     G      A<br/>              16:15  9:8   10:9</p><p>which is one of several tetrachordal divisions Ptolemy gives, including<br/>five for the diatonic genus. This one, compared to most of the other<br/>diatonic divisions, has a higher F and G, so the strings for those notes<br/>had to be tenser. Thus the name syntonic, and Zarlino, having just read<br/>a newly available Latin translation of Ptolemy, gave the name syntonic<br/>diatonic to his scale of a whole octave that incorporated Ptolemy&apos;s<br/>tetrachord.</p><p>As for Zarlino talking about major and minor, as far as I remember the<br/>only thing along these lines is that he says you could classify the octave<br/>modes according to whether they had a major or minor third above the<br/>final. He doesn&apos;t seem to place as much importance on it as people<br/>sometimes say he did. (By the way, the modes on C and A had been<br/>described earlier, in Glarean&apos;s _Dodekahedron_ of 1547).</p><p>There was quite a debate between Zarlino and Galilei (Galileo&apos;s father)<br/>about whether singers and instrumentalists actually use the syntonic<br/>diatonic or not - Galilei points out some of the harsh consonances that<br/>would arise. Zarlino ends up fudging it a bit, and says that singers<br/>really do use the syntonic diatonic, but because of the flexibility of the<br/>voice they can get around the harsh intervals (which amounts to admitting<br/>they don&apos;t use it at all).</p><p>Someone also mentioned Didymus - his diatonic tetrachord was divided this<br/>way:</p><p>            E     F      G      A<br/>             16:15  10:9    9:8</p><p>and so could be called the first true 5-limit division - he wrote maybe a<br/>century earlier than Ptolemy. (Earlier still you get the strange 7-limit<br/>suggestions by Archytas, like 28:27 - 8:7 - 9:8)</p><p>Bye -Jon</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2000 2:32:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15319">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15319</a></p><p> The relation to Ptolemy&apos;s<br/>&gt; writings can be found in the middle of this scale - we get<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;              E     F     G      A<br/>&gt;               16:15  9:8   10:9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which is one of several tetrachordal divisions Ptolemy gives,<br/>including five for the diatonic genus.
