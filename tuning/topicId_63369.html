Now I&apos;ve made a new one. Similarly to the previous two<br/>scales, Its chain of fifths also goes from F to A# and the tuning comes from<br/>beat rates as well. Here is how to tune the scale (by &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;lower&quot; I<br/>mean compared to JI):</p><p>1. A4 = 439Hz<br/>2. E4 = Perfect 4th downwards (slightly lower to get -6 bps)<br/>3. D4 = Perfect 5th downwards from A4 (slightly higher to get 4 bps)<br/>4. C4 = Major 3rd downwards from E4 (slightly lower to get -1 bps)<br/>5. G4 = Perfect 5th upwards from C4 (slightly lower to get -1 bps)<br/>6. F4 = Major 3rd downwards from A4 (slightly lower to get -2 bps)<br/>7. B4 = Major 3rd upwards from G4 (slightly higher to get 0.5 bps)<br/>8. F#4 = Perfect 4th downwards from B4 (slightly lower to get -3 bps)<br/>9. C#4 = Minor 3rd downwards from E4 (slightly higher to get 9 bps)<br/>10. G#4 = Minor 3rd downwards from B4 (slightly higher to get 7 bps)<br/>11. D#4 = Minor 6th downwards from B4 (slightly higher to get 1 bps)<br/>12. A#4 = Augmented 6th from C4 (slightly lower than 7/4 to get 1 bps)</p><p>As you can see, the preferred chords in this tuning are C major and G major.<br/>Also E major and B major sound quite OK, though not so smoothly. A very<br/>strong sonority appears in the C-E-G-A# tetrad as many of the beat rates<br/>there are equal. This is interesting because playing G-A#-C-D-E-G comes out<br/>close to 6:7:8:9:10:12, which is one of the most popular scales in East<br/>Africa. So it may actually be a good idea to play East African folk melodies<br/>in this tuning (these were promoted mainly by the Master Musicians of<br/>Tanzania and their lead singer Hukwe Zawose at the end of the 1980s).</p><p>Now the actual scale follows.</p><p>! qmeb3.scl<br/>!<br/>Equal beating quasi-meantone tuning no. 3 - F...A# (1/1 = 262Hz)<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 2197/2096<br/> 147/131<br/> 9819/8384<br/> 1311/1048<br/> 877/655<br/> 5877/4192<br/> 785/524<br/> 3281/2096<br/> 439/262<br/> 1833/1048<br/> 1963/1048<br/> 2/1</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=63370 href="#63370">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2006 5:29:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I was incorrect when I said that C4-A#4 did 1 bps.

It was originally<br/>meant just to go along with the other instructions on tuning the scale. If I<br/>say that A# should be tuned slightly lower than a 7/4 from C, it&apos;s obvious<br/>that the resulting beating comes out as -1 bps in this particular case. I<br/>just wanted to avoid confusion for the case someone decided to tune this<br/>scale on an acoustic instrument, which may more or less require the beat<br/>rates to match the ones I&apos;ve given. In such a situation, one needs to know<br/>if they want to get positive or negative beats (or in other words, if the<br/>tone they&apos;re tuning should be higher or lower than for a JI interval). It<br/>has nothing to do with actual music performance after the instrument has<br/>been tuned.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=63406 href="#63406">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2006 6:08:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Petr,</p><p>On Mon, 9 Jan 2006 Petr Par&iuml;&iquest;&half;zek wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; This is interesting!
