The 3-limit would be 12-equal but there&apos;d be a small interval giving you the 5-limit corrections.  Except that I see that this doesn&apos;t work with the ratio library.  You can see the result I mean by putting in 12 and 72 for the two-et script though:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/temperament.cgi?et1=12&et2=72&limit=5">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/temperament.cgi?et1=12&et2=72&limit=5</a></p><p>A real example from Paul Erlich&apos;s Middle Path paper is Blackwood temperament: unison vector of 256:243.  Again, doesn&apos;t work with online script :(</p><p>But yes, try excluding 2.  You can plug in 27:25 and get the bug exotemperament.  So how does the program know that 2 was the other prime you wanted to use?  It has to go with complete prime limits.</p><p>&gt;&gt;  Sometimes the period won&apos;t be a simple ratio.<br/>&gt; &gt; The solution for schismatic and other temperaments could be writing the &gt; factor like (2/1)^(1/2) or something similar.</p><p>Oh, well that&apos;s easy.</p><p>&gt;&gt;  See makeIntervalExact. Sometimes this isn&apos;t uniquely<br/>&gt;&gt;  determined.<br/>&gt; &gt; Right now, I have to admit I can&rsquo;t think of any case where this could &gt; happen.</p><p>Augmented temperament, tempering out 128:125.</p><p>&gt;&gt;  It should be simple using my library, where it&apos;s possible. &gt; It&apos;s very &gt; similar to what the online script does anyway.<br/>&gt; &gt; It is, indeed, but for some reason, at least as far as the online &gt; version of your script is concerned, although it works okay when I type &gt; &quot;2401/2400, 1029/1024&quot;, it refuses to show any results if I type &gt; &quot;1029/1024&quot; alone even though these are 3-dimmensional prime coordinates &gt; which should be simpler to process than the 4-dimmensional ones. And, &gt; AFAIK, 1029/1024 is tempered out nicely with a generator 7 times smaller &gt; than 18/7.</p><p>1029/1024 is a 7-limit ratio, so the script assumes you want the whole 7-limit, and finds it doesn&apos;t have enough ratios.   If you want incomplete prime limits you will need to fiddle with the code.  It gets difficult to second guess what the user wanted.  (In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.)</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2008 7:07:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham wrote:</p><p>&gt; If you want incomplete prime limits you will need to<br/>&gt; fiddle with the code.</p><p>Does it mean that because hanson doesn&apos;t do 11s (or the temperament I&apos;ve mentioned doesn&apos;t do 5s) there&apos;s no way to find the desired mapping?</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/2008 7:54:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr Pa&rcaron;&iacute;zek wrote:<br/>&gt; &#xFEFF;<br/>&gt; Graham wrote:<br/>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  If you want incomplete prime limits you will need to<br/>&gt;&gt;  fiddle with the code.<br/>&gt;  &gt; Does it mean that because hanson doesn&apos;t do 11s (or the temperament I&apos;ve &gt; mentioned doesn&apos;t do 5s) there&apos;s no way to find the desired mapping?</p><p>It&apos;s not something the unison vector web script supports.
