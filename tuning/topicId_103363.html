The problem, as I see it, is that his app always includes all the basis elements of the limit, whether or not removing some of them will lower the error. If you could just, say, plug in an ET (or some combination of ETs) and the 19-limit, and have the app sort through all the subgroups of the 19-limit and spit out the ones on which the resulting temperament has the lowest errors, we&apos;d be in business.</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=12&limit=19">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=12&limit=19</a></p><p>There&apos;s all the 19-limit matches for 12-EDO, for instance.

Or maybe I should ask, under what circumstances does inconsistency become problematic?</p><p>&gt; You could also try starting out with the 15-integer-limit diamond as<br/>&gt; the set of starting consonances, and treat every single element in<br/>&gt; that as its own basis. To simplify, you might make it so that powers<br/>&gt; of 2 are always consistent, so that you end up instead using the union<br/>&gt; of the 15-odd-limit tonality diamond and 2/1 as your basis - so that<br/>&gt; you get <a href="http://2.3.5.5/3'.7.7/3'.7/5'.9'.9">2.3.5.5/3'.7.7/3'.7/5'.9'.9</a>&apos;/3.etc as a basis. Then, for most<br/>&gt; useful temperaments with halfway decent error, all of these<br/>&gt; inconsistencies should vanish - which means you&apos;ll get &quot;commas&quot; like<br/>&gt; 9&apos;/9 vanishing and so on, and it&apos;ll all work itself out.</p><p>Right, that&apos;s kind of what I&apos;m thinking--error should control inconsistency, and I suspect that the best mapping for a given scale should end up being consistent...but I can&apos;t prove that yet.</p><p>&gt; Graham&apos;s finder does this sort of thing for whatever limit that you<br/>&gt; put in, especially the temperament search part of it.</p><p>Huh?  The problem, as I see it, is that his app always includes all the basis elements of the limit, whether or not removing some of them will lower the error.  If you could just, say, plug in an ET (or some combination of ETs) and the 19-limit, and have the app sort through all the subgroups of the 19-limit and spit out the ones on which the resulting temperament has the lowest errors, we&apos;d be in business.  But I&apos;m not going to ask/beg/demand that Graham make any modifications when he&apos;s already done so much work.  If he thinks it&apos;d be a worthwhile feature to add, I&apos;d be ecstatic, but I&apos;m not expecting it to happen.</p><p>&gt; He&apos;s written<br/>&gt; stuff on how his algorithm works. If you just want to round things off<br/>&gt; to the nearest match, you can do that as well. It&apos;s kind of like the<br/>&gt; &quot;patent val&quot; vs &quot;best val&quot; approach, generalized to higher-dimensional<br/>&gt; temperaments, and mapping things from this particular inconsistent-JI<br/>&gt; space onto it.</p><p>What language did he program in?  Maybe if I can learn the language, and get a bit of help with the math, I can take his code and modify it...but realistically, how much time and effort will that take me?</p><p>-Igs</p><p>------------------------------------</p><p>You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>Yahoo!

We&apos;d have to introduce proper error weighting that accounts for the number of &quot;primes&quot; that are mapped, and the complexity of primes being mapped.
