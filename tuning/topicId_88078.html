Getting rid of this bit of decoration produces the seven note scale</p><p>97/88, 107/88, 59/44, 1041/704, 287/176, 633/352, 2</p><p>This is, finally, the MOS we were looking for, but finding it was a lot of work. It could, of course, be extended to a 12 note scale with the same generator which would provide a lot more resources, even if they are not ones an ethnically minded musician would want. But why second guess what someone might want?</p></div><h3><a id=88524 href="#88524">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2010 8:19:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/temper/pregular.html">http://x31eq.com/temper/pregular.html</a></p><p>Why in the world don&apos;t you list 7-limit planar generators by comma?</p></div><h3><a id=88525 href="#88525">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2010 8:42:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Why in the world don&apos;t you list 7-limit planar generators by comma?</p><p>Some of these rank three babies have names, and some I&apos;ve actually composed in--including breed, which Graham may feel would,be a bit much to stick on his own web site, I suppose.

The true Mavila would be the one that follows the same series<br/>&gt; that Erv used.</p><p>It seems to me that what I&apos;ve seen described as the &quot;Mavila&quot; linear<br/>temperament does not match with Erv&apos;s &quot;Mavila&quot;.<br/>And I find very different values for it ; what are the best ones ? is<br/>it identical to &quot;Pelogic&quot; ?.<br/>BTW, just like with most other Mt Meru series, what Erv calls &quot;Chopi-<br/>Mavila&quot; is one I found myself long ago I call &quot;Samak&quot; (and it is not<br/>a 4th degree algorithm, but a 3rd degree, as I wrote to Kraig Grady<br/>in this list - this may induce wrong series).<br/>Anyway I didn&apos;t select Samak for the Ethno tunings, where I used in<br/>the same range Sapaan, N&ucirc;ng-Phan, and Simdek.<br/>Here is a more complete list of the area :</p><p>Evan  686.2389753438 c.

The generator is so close to 2 steps of 13 that it takes a long time to get a good approximation of 3 (108 steps to get closer than 10c) and even longer to approach 7.</p></div><h3><a id=88582 href="#88582">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/1/2010 7:59:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jacques Dudon wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Herman, Gene, and Graham,<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks for your efforts with this &quot;ethnic&quot; selection of fractal generators.<br/>&gt; I am asking your attention on one point.<br/>&gt; We are making here comparisons between octave-tempered and octavial &gt; systems (my usual recurrent systems are based on pure 2/1).<br/>&gt; In differential coherence or equal-beating systems the intervals are &gt; very sensible, and it makes sense whatever octaves to consider the &gt; precise values of the generators as important, though they would need to &gt; be slightly retuned when transported in a stretched octave context.<br/>&gt; But on the other hand, in the scales further developpement through the &gt; various MOS and edos approached, the ratio period/generator would be &gt; more pertinent, and in temperaments using heavy octave tempering this &gt; makes a big difference.<br/>&gt; For example with the Mavila temperament, whether I use the exact &gt; generator or its cyclic ratio equivalent, it makes a difference of 4 &gt; cents, in which I have 8 different fractal species ; then there is about &gt; just as much difference (again 8 different species) according to my data &gt; between this last one and Samak (= Erv Wilson&apos;s Chopi-Mavila).</p><p>Mavila temperament in particular has a wide range of generator sizes. In general, the more accurate a temperament, the more precise the size of the generator needs to be; since mavila tempers out 135/128 (a fairly large 92c interval), the tuning is not as sensitive. Graham&apos;s list of generator sizes had specific &quot;optimal&quot; sizes for the generator (which in this case are based on a 2/1 octave period), so the mavila generator for instance was given as 520.194 cents. For a tuning with stretched octaves, the TOP-RMS generator is 523.827 cents with a period of 1208.380 cents. So the generator/period ratio is the same.</p><p>The list I&apos;m using is similar to Wilson&apos;s scale tree, with generators expressed as fractions of an octave (e.g. 4/9, 7/16, 10/23), except that I have a mapping associated with each entry, and I label them with the names of the corresponding temperaments (so 4/9, 7/16, and 10/23 all end up being labed as &quot;mavila&quot;). One problem with this is that some of these ET&apos;s are boundary cases, so I&apos;ve got 3/7 labeled as &quot;mavila&quot; and 7/17 labeled as &quot;helmholtz / schism&quot;. So Graham&apos;s list with the TOP-RMS generator sizes is probably a better reference.</p><p>&gt; Graham wrote :<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; There are different generators in Jacques&apos; list that cluster around<br/>&gt;&gt; Mavila. The true Mavila would be the one that follows the same series<br/>&gt;&gt; that Erv used.<br/>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that what I&apos;ve seen described as the &quot;Mavila&quot; linear &gt; temperament does not match with Erv&apos;s &quot;Mavila&quot;.<br/>&gt; And I find very different values for it ; what are the best ones ? is it &gt; identical to &quot;Pelogic&quot; ?.</p><p>Pelogic is one of two 7-limit versions of mavila, also known as hexadecimal.</p><p>&gt; BTW, just like with most other Mt Meru series, what Erv calls &gt; &quot;Chopi-Mavila&quot; is one I found myself long ago I call &quot;Samak&quot; (and it is &gt; not a 4th degree algorithm, but a 3rd degree, as I wrote to Kraig Grady &gt; in this list - this may induce wrong series).<br/>&gt; Anyway I didn&apos;t select Samak for the Ethno tunings, where I used in the &gt; same range Sapaan, N&iuml;&iquest;&half;ng-Phan, and Simdek.<br/>&gt; Here is a more complete list of the area :<br/>&gt; &gt; Evan  686.2389753438 c.

I&apos;ll say this about JI, it&apos;s pretty good for getting a quick estimate of what kinds of chords are likely possible...but it sure doesn&apos;t seem capable of explaining everything.</p><p>&gt;&quot;One theory may mean that perfection is possible, that there is reason, etc. I see that as the opposite of &quot;sad&quot; as you call it.&quot;<br/>  Admittedly, the flip side is the are ultimately many &quot;perfect musics/scales/theories&quot; as there are different artistic personalities making the music.  I made the Silver Scale and eventually considered it too weird after not touching it for months and then coming back to it...but a song made with it became the most downloaded song on the SoOn online label.  And now I&apos;ve been working with mixed-JI (meaning follows some JI rules but not others) scales that go the complete opposite direction of the scales both in theory and practice and yet are doing very well (though not necessarily better).</p><p>  Making a scale that uses one theory more than others is going to lean it toward use by a certain kind of musician...and certainly, say, leaning a theory all on JI is going to single out musicians who don&apos;t want the JI feel.  Do you see any reason why all musician&apos;s preferences (new and old) can be singled down into one theory?</p></div><h3><a id=88655 href="#88655">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/3/2010 8:40:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene&gt;&quot;In scales, products of intervals lead to other intervals.

It means using any interval (A) as input find an interval the same distance from one and only one simple rotational &quot;center&quot; interval R (where R is usually 2/1, 1/1, 3/2, or 4/3) on the other side of that interval R.</p><p>&gt;&quot;What I said was that &quot;mirroring&quot; seemed to be when the same interval<br/>appeared twice.

That seems to be what you are talking about--is<br/>it?&quot;</p><p>     No...because they have to be the same distance from one interval, not two.  You are talking about a given distance from 3/2 and 1/1...to be mirrored the intervals have to be the same distance from either 1/1 or 3/2...but not both.  Your example goes wrong in that<br/>A) You use 9/8 AND 3/2 as rotation points...and there can only be one rotation point<br/>B) You are putting both results on the same side of each rotation IE 3/2 &gt; 1/1 and 27/16 &gt; 9/8.   In a true rotation result intervals are on opposite sides of the rotation point and rotating either interval around the center gives the other interval as a result.</p><p>&gt;&quot;4/3 * 3/2 = 2 (one of your examples) is mirroring but<br/>    5/4 * 8/5 = 2 isn&apos;t?&quot;<br/>    Bad example on my part...basically in each of the above I gave only one half of the mirror (so it&apos;s neither right nor wrong, just incomplete)! :-(<br/>Say for the example 4/3 * 3/2 = 2 (mirroring around 3/2)...the other half of the mirror would be 3/2 * 3/4 = 9/8.  Make sense?</p><p>&gt;&quot;So &quot;mirroring&quot; is when a lot of very simple and basic intervals appear<br/>in a scale? &quot;<br/>No it&apos;s when intervals that are built around revolving around basic intervals (typical rotating points are intervals like 3/2 and 1/1 or 2/1 and occasionally 4/3).</p><p>  For example you can rotate the &quot;not so simple&quot; 27/20 fraction around 3/2 to get    3/2 * 20/27 = 60/54 = 30/27...that 30/27 is mirrored but is not simple.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Why must they &quot;mirror&quot; around G? And in any case, G to G# equals F# to<br/>G, G to A equals F to G, etc etc etc. &quot;<br/>There&apos;s no &quot;must&quot;.  Mirroring around 1/1 and 2/1 or even 4/3 work fine too...it&apos;s just harder to explain the math in examples as the &quot;mirrored&quot; interval often ends up crossing over the octave.</p><p>Mike&gt;      You can easily say 12TET itself mirrors, say, around 3/2...for example G to F and G to A  or G to E  and G to A#...but at some point<br/>with doing this you run into tones that are simply out of key (IE A# is<br/>not in the key of C where G is the fifth).</p><p>Gene&gt;&quot;Sorry, but you&apos;ve now introduced a whole new idea, &quot;key&quot;, which one<br/>might think depended on a scale being already implicitly constructed.<br/>This is a  mess!&quot;<br/>  You made a statement that any TET (which, of course, is a type of tuning and not a type of scale) is very &quot;mirrored&quot;.<br/>   I&apos;m saying that simply isn&apos;t true because scales use only limited subsets of tunings.  My example assumed the notes CDEFGAB in the key of C and shows, for example, that many notes from the key of C become rotated out of the key of C (IE become notes like A#,C#,D#,F#,G#) when mirrored.  Thus 12TET in common practice theory is often not mirror-able in the same way to entire chromatic scale is.  Same goes for things like MOS scales, which also take subsets which run into the same problem.</p></div><h3><a id=88667 href="#88667">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2010 9:01:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Start with the scale 1/1 6/5 3/2 2/1.</p><p>2/1 over 3/2 is 4/3.<br/>Mirror this around 2/1 (AKA 1/1) to get 4/3.<br/>Thus 3/2 mirrors around the &quot;center&quot; 2/1 to produce the rotated interval 4/3.<br/>...giving the new resultant scale<br/>1/1 6/5 4/3 3/2 2/1.</p><p>Also 6/5 over 1/1 is 6/5.<br/>Mirror this around 1/1 (AKA 2/1) to get 2/1 * 5/6 = 5/3.<br/>Thus 6/5 mirrors around 2/1 to produce the rotated interval 5/3.<br/>...giving the new resultant scale<br/>1/1 6/5 4/3 3/2 5/3 2/1.</p><p>Now 5/3 over 4/3 = 5/4.<br/>And (mirroring around 4/3) ...<br/>  4/3 over 5/4 = 16/15<br/>...giving the new resultant scale</p><p>1/1 16/15 6/5 4/3 3/2 5/3 2/1.</p><p>Now 16/15 mirrors around 1/1 (AKA 2/1) to give<br/>2/1 over 16/15 = 15/8.<br/>...giving the new resultant scale<br/>***********************<br/>1/1 16/15 6/5 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1.<br/>***********************</p><p>Look familiar?</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: genewardsmith &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Mon, May 3, 2010 11:41:58 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: The regular mapping paradigm strikes back</p><p>--- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene&gt;&quot;Judging my your example below you almost can (take any multiplication of ratios and call it a mirror)&quot;</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t think we&apos;re talking about the same type of &quot;mirroring&quot; in that case.<br/>&gt;     Example: Take 9/8 and 3/2 times 9/8.  the latter is NOT a mirror as it as not the same distance from 3/2 as 9/8 is.</p><p>What I said was that &quot;mirroring&quot; seemed to be when the same interval appeared twice.

You can&apos;t do half a rotation, translate it somewhere else, and then complete the rotation.<br/>  The whole point is to give the mind more ways to get from one note to another easily...translating in the middle of a rotation would just make it that much more complicated.</p><p>Gene&gt;It (TET) is a type of scale if it is used as one, as is often the case with 12<br/>and 7 and sometimes with other divisions.<br/>   In that case, you are right.  7TET is &quot;perfectly mirrored&quot; when the whole tuning is used as a scale.  The question then becomes when you make a chord in said scale can you rotate on note in a chord around another to get a third note in the chords (and thus use rotation to help the brain find one note in the chord from another)...again you run into the issue of does rotation help the brain tie the notes in whatever &quot;simultaneously played notes&quot; you are using together?</p><p>Me&gt;&gt;    &quot;I&apos;m saying that simply isn&apos;t true because scales use only<br/>limited subsets of tunings.&quot;<br/>Gene&gt;&quot;Sez you. The most famous scale, the diatonic scale in 12-et, uses more<br/>than half the notes, which is already a pretty large percentage.&quot;<br/>     But, as I stated with my example, when many of those notes are mirrored they form notes that are not in the scale.<br/>     In the key of C diatonic try mirroring E around G and you get A#...which is a &quot;useless&quot; mirror because it&apos;s outside the scale.  Also in the key of C, try mirroring B around the octave and you get C#, which is again not in the key of C.  Now try mirroring A around the octave and you get D#, which is once again out of key.  My point again is...the stereotypical type of scales where the scale is not the tuning are often not very good examples of mirroring.  They may well have other interesting symmetrical properties and I&apos;m not saying they are bad simply because they often lack ability to be mirrored, but &quot;mirroring&quot; isn&apos;t one of them.<br/>   BTW Chris&apos;s 12TET &quot;mirroring&quot; example was of a very well mirrored scale that used subsets...but that was an odd case IE he only used whole tones to make the scale IE C D E F# G# A#...C, which surely is not the &quot;famous diatonic scale&quot; but rather a copy of 6TET under 12TET where the tuning is used as the scale.</p></div><h3><a id=88676 href="#88676">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2010 12:30:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene&gt;&quot;Your whole example shows why I thought &quot;mirroring&quot; meant using the same<br/>interval more than once, since that is all you really are doing.&quot;<br/>     No it isn&apos;t.

Your very first example mirrored through 2, 3/2, and 4/3.&quot;<br/>     No, it mirrored one interval through 3/2, another through 4/3, and another through 2/1.  That&apos;s three separate mirroring instances each using one mirroring interval, not one mirroring using 3 intervals at once.  Big difference.</p><p>Me&gt;&quot;For each mirroring one and only one center is picked, and that center<br/>can be one of the following points: 2/1, 1/1, 3/2, 4/3, or 5/3.!!!!&quot;<br/>Gene&gt;&quot;It makes little sense to restrict the center in this way, as by<br/>transposition you can put the center anywhere. With octave equivalence,<br/>you can assume the center is 1 or 2 if you want to restrict it, which<br/>says &quot;mirroring&quot; is where a scale has, by transposition, a lot of<br/>inversely related intervals in the scale.&quot;</p><p>Mathematically your statement makes perfect sense.  But, in practice, I&apos;ve found doing so sets you up for mirroring around so many different centers causes a major issue...your brain has trouble keeping track of all of them.  In such cases, the mirroring technique loses the very advantage it is designed for: to help the brain quickly and easily keep track of intervals.</p><p>Example...if you have a 4 tone scale of<br/>1  6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2<br/>...and mirror everything around 3/2 to get 3 more tones<br/>1 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 27/16 9/5 15/8<br/>  your brain only has to know the first 5 tones of the scale and one mirroring type (a rotation about 3/2) to quickly know where the other 3 should be.  Plus, your brain can find 3/2 and 2/1 more easily than any other interval as those two are the simplest fractions.</p><p>  Now say you mirror around 4/3 then 3/2 then 2/1 to create the rest of a scale.  Your brain now has to track 3 different mirroring types to figure out what is in the scale...thus in part ruining the ability of mirroring to set up simple symmetries for the brain to follow.   If you mirrored about more complex intervals, like 23/17, you add yet another step as the brain has to first find 23/17 (not nearly as easy to find as something like 3/2) before it maps out the mirroring. This again counters the point of making the note positions follow an easy-to-find pattern for the brain to pick up on.</p></div><h3><a id=88692 href="#88692">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2010 8:31:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>MikeB&gt;&quot;but from my perspective it looks like you&apos;re just taking a<br/>bunch of intervals, reflecting them around 1/1, and then treating the<br/>whole combined set as a scale.&quot;</p><p>     Exactly!
