It<br/>was based on the observation that the preferred cultural development of<br/>scales goes from 5-tone to 7-tone to 12-tone (each displacing but not<br/>eliminating the former). The most efficient division of the scale by each of<br/>these numbers has been reported in ethnomusicological literature: 5-TET in<br/>Uganda; 7-TET in Thailand; 12-TET in Europe (starting with luthiers).<br/>However, equal temperaments have limited capacity for expansion as<br/>meantones, because additional pitches coincide exactly with those already<br/>there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The addition of tones to most meantone systems will eventually hit<br/>stretches where the added pitches fall too close to those in existence to be<br/>practical in use. The only method I have found that avoids this inefficiency<br/>is division by the golden ratio. Applying the golden ratio to 5-tone,<br/>7-tone, or 12-tone produces Golden Meantone<br/>(&lt;<a href="http://www.rev.net/people/aloe/music/golden.html">http://www.rev.net/people/aloe/music/golden.html</a>&gt;), which is close to<br/>1/4-comma, although not identical. Because Golden Meantone works<br/>consistently for low numbers, it is extended to higher numbers. That<br/>produces close correspondence to the Fibonacci sequence {2, 5, 7, 12, 19,<br/>31, 50, 81, 131, . . .}. So Golden was used as the base for choosing just<br/>intervals from those of the smallest limit practicable. However, I have<br/>started to make exceptions to the limit rule, with some misgivings. I may<br/>eliminate those exceptions, because I don&apos;t see justification for them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Conceptually, new notes don&apos;t seem to generate from a void. They are more<br/>likely to be daughters of pitches in the previous generation, e.g., minor<br/>second descended from natural (major) second. This parallels another<br/>acoustically-based digital theory, that of phonology, in which more complex<br/>systems of vowels can be explained by the imposition of additional variables<br/>to simple systems. The vowels in a standard system of five (the most popular<br/>in the world, occurring in such languages as Spanish, Russian, Japanese,<br/>Swahili, and Hawaiian) can be differentiated by the use of three variables.<br/>Splitting the mid vowels &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; into two states of tension produces a<br/>seven-vowel system, which Italians recognize only in speech, Portuguese<br/>acknowledge with accents, and ancient Greeks designated with different<br/>letters. Alternatively, allowing front (or as theory describes them,<br/>non-back) vowels to be rounded (a quality otherwise reserved for back<br/>vowels) results in the seven-vowel system of German articulation (although<br/>the rounding determines the identity of the vowel, with an umlaut nullifying<br/>the location in the back of the mouth. (Germans use a subset of a<br/>theoretical 12-vowel gamut that also includes Finnish and Romanian, plus a<br/>long-short durational distinction that can also be explained in terms of 14<br/>of 24 vowels). As with most behavioral sciences, the abilities to use these<br/>distinctions and to explain them do not necessarily coincide. I wonder<br/>whether there has been research to see if there is any relationship between<br/>the overtones that identify vowels and the frequencies of notes in chords<br/>that accompany the syllables in which they are sung.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To pursue a tangent, the undesirability of &quot;inefficient&quot; spacing of pitches<br/>seems to be aesthetic, not merely hypothetical. People seem to prefer scales<br/>with two or more sizes of adjacent intervals, because uniformity is bland.<br/>On the other hand, if the spacing is too severe, such as quarter-tones in a<br/>pentatonic scale (&lt;<a href="http://www.rev.net/people/aloe/music/enharmonic.html">http://www.rev.net/people/aloe/music/enharmonic.html</a>&gt;),<br/>the scale is not comfortable. Quarter-tones might be acceptable in a<br/>double-digit scale. It&apos;s too early to tell, because the heptatonic scale has<br/>yet to be eclipsed in popularity by the dodecatonic. (Although equivalent<br/>changes in taste have previously taken centuries, they are subject to<br/>acceleration by technology, as Ed Foote indicates.)</p><p>&gt;&gt;Adding tones after the first three always divides intervals in the<br/>&gt;&gt;golden ratio, which you&apos;re right is roughly 5:3, but is exactly<br/>&gt;&gt;(sqrt(5)+1)/2 . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes. I wanted to give the reader some idea where the ratio fell, but it is<br/>not as clear as intended. I&apos;d better take another look at it.</p></div>
