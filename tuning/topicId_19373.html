Third draft.</h1><h3><a id=19373 href="#19373">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf1@matavnet.hu&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2001 7:18:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To Johnny Reinhard who wrote:</p><p>&quot;My only question on the informative<br/>second draft by Daniel is if by the end of the first line, one must still<br/>look up  &quot;temperament&quot; and &quot;syntonic&quot; and comma&quot; and &quot;cents&quot; and deal with<br/>numbers, there must be a better way to organize difficult material.&quot;</p><p>I presume that basic terminology will be treated separately in the FAQ. If each<br/>item in the FAQ is required to re-define basic terms, I believe they will get<br/>hopelessly bogged down, and lose the graces of brevity.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard also wrote:</p><p>&quot;WHAT IS &quot;MEANTONE&quot;</p><p>Meantone is a tuning that was developed in the Renaissance to modulate on a<br/>keyboard instrument.&quot;</p><p>(1) The time frame in which the development occured is not clear. My item<br/>includes the most crucial dates in the theoretical literature. An association of<br/>the tuning with the Renaissance is plausible (I had it in my initial rough<br/>draft) but arguable.</p><p>(2) The purpose &quot;to modulate&quot; is only one attribute, and perhaps rather<br/>secondary to the goal of simply finding a workable compromise between the<br/>product of a(n octave-reduced) series of fifths and a pure major third. For a<br/>great deal of the repertoire we&apos;re concerned with, modulation is a negligible<br/>concern, but this basic relationship between intervals is vital. Tuning history<br/>could have gone another way, solving the problem, for example, by a distribution<br/>of the skhisma instead of the syntonic comma. But because music history went in<br/>the meantone (5:4 = up four fifths) direction rather than the skhismatic (5:4 =<br/>down 8 fifths), my draft attempts to respond to that experience.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard also wrote:</p><p>&quot;Theorists devised a way to split a major third into 2<br/>equal parts (the &quot;mean&quot; whole tones) by flattening the pure fifth<br/>consistently in every key.&quot;</p><p>(1) Do we know that this was developed by theorists or by practitioners through<br/>trial and error and only later analyzed/desribed by theorists? No.</p><p>(2) The mean whole tone is a consequence of this tuning process, and indeed, it<br/>is the atttribute that gave the tuning its name, a point on which my draft is<br/>strict. However, it is far from likely that the mean division of the just major<br/>third was the principle goal of the tuning.  I characterize that goal as one of<br/>attempting to relate the interval of the just major third to the product of a<br/>series of fifths.</p><p>(2) If you intend it to mean tonality, the term &quot;key&quot; here is inappropriate for<br/>the era in question. Better would have been &quot;flatten each fifth identically.&quot;</p><p>Johnny Reinhard also wrote:</p><p>&quot;This produces variants; quartercomma meantone splits a pure major third<br/>(ratio 5/4 or 386 cents), while sixthcomma meantone was preferred by other<br/>musicians in different times and places.&quot;</p><p>This is a non-sequitor to your previous sentence.  Please note in my third draft<br/>that I follow Barbour and describe the n-th-comma temperaments other than<br/>quarter-comma MT as n-th-comma temperaments (not MTs), in that they do not have<br/>mean-sized wholetones.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard also wrote:</p><p>&quot;When the pure fifth (formed by the ratio of 3/2) is consistently flattened by<br/>anywhere from 2 cents to 6 cents (with 1200 cents equal to an octave), a set<br/>of identical diatonic keys are set up.&quot;</p><p>This sentence is empty: A set of identical diatonic keys would be set up by<br/>_any_ uniform size of fifth.</p><p>That noted, I&apos;m curious to learn on which grounds you have selected the range<br/>of -2 to -6 cents? (The third-comma temperament would be excluded by your<br/>definition and quarter-comma MT barely makes it).</p><p>Please answer me off list. I don&apos;t think this discussion is doing anyone else<br/>any good.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
