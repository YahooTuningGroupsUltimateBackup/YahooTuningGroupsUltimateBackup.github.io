Does Manneristic modality favor an even temperament?<br/>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Having identified the dog -- or domesticated Wolves -- which didn&apos;t<br/>bark, we may ask why something like a 12-note well-temperament of the<br/>Bach era was in demand in 1572 or 1622, as opposed to 1722.</p><p>Here I would like to suggest a possible answer which might link two<br/>interestingly &quot;synchronous&quot; events: the rise of the major/minor key<br/>system around the epoch of Corelli (say 1680), and the description of<br/>well-temperaments by Werckmeister (1681 and later).</p><p>In a Manneristic setting, there may be two factors together helping to<br/>account for the general disinterest in 12-note well-temperaments.<br/>First, even with a standard meantone range of Eb-G#, the fluid system<br/>of 12 modes offers enough musical variety (including some striking<br/>chromatic progressions) that more remote inflections or transpositions<br/>seem more of a special or experimental effect than a routine<br/>imperative.</p><p>Secondly, given the largely homogenous texture of smooth tertian<br/>sonorities, with bold dissonances used as a special or poetic effect,<br/>the more tense thirds and sixths inevitably introduced by a 12-note<br/>circulating temperament would clash with the sonorous ideal of the<br/>music. One might say that the acoustical dissonance introduced would<br/>be in tension with the stylistic aesthetic of concord/discord.</p><p>In contrast, the circulating 19-tone and 31-tone keyboards of the era<br/>fit this tertian/modal ethos while expanding it to encompass chromatic<br/>or enharmonic nuances. Vicentino thus includes in his treatise not<br/>only a description of his archicembalo and some examples of chromatic<br/>and enharmonic composition, but also a presentation on typical<br/>four-voice progressions in the usual modes.[14]</p><p>In discussing this modal common practice, as well as his chromatic and<br/>enharmonic innovations, Vicentino notes that modes may pleasingly be<br/>mixed in a composition, for example to express the sense of the words.<br/>He compares such artfully commixed modes to the pleasing mixture of<br/>Doric and Attic styles in architecture.[15]</p><p>Not only the variety of the modes, but the variety of vertical<br/>progressions, contributes to the fluidity of this music. These<br/>progressions between saturated tertian or 5-limit sonorities<br/>(Zarlino&apos;s &quot;third-plus-fifth-or-sixth&quot;) are guided by a diverse set of<br/>directed two-voice resolutions, with traditional trinic[16] or 3-limit<br/>resolutions &quot;to the nearest consonance&quot; (e.g. m3-1, M3-5, M6-8) being<br/>adopted to the new tertian setting. Not only a conventional<br/>16th-century theorist such as Zarlino (1555), but a Late Manneristic<br/>exponent of the new continuo techniques such as Agazzari (1607), takes<br/>as basic this principle of &quot;moving to the nearest consonance.&quot;[17]<br/>The resulting variety of progressions, with bass motion by a second or<br/>third nicely balancing that by a fourth or fifth, is a great resource<br/>of this music.</p><p>Further, the fluid degree inflections routinely occurring within a<br/>mode (e.g. B/Bb, C/C#), as well as the direct chromaticism possible in<br/>theory and practice on a 12-note meantone keyboard with its engaging<br/>contrast between large diatonic and small chromatic semitones (in<br/>1/4-comma meantone, respectively about 117.11 and 76.05 cents),<br/>enhance the variety of the system in pieces ranging from the<br/>conventional to the highly experimental.</p><p>A keyboard with 31 notes, of course, would multiply such creative<br/>possibilities already available on a standard 12-note keyboard; but in<br/>either case, transposing the same mode to different steps is only one<br/>of many resources open to the composer or performer.</p><p>On a 12-note keyboard, where a meantone range of Eb-G# nicely<br/>accommodates the 12 modes and their usual accidental inflections,<br/>compromising the uniform smoothness of thirds and sixths within this<br/>gamut for the sake of some more remote inflections or transpositions<br/>would seem a very dubious musical proposition.</p><p>By around 1680, however, both musical factors had changed. The<br/>fluidity of the Manneristic 12-mode system was largely replaced by the<br/>constraints of the major/minor key system. The new system treated bold<br/>dissonances not as special effects, but as basic elements in defining<br/>a key, dramatically raising the level of routine concord/discord<br/>contrast.</p><p>In this new setting, transposition shifted from one of many resources<br/>to an imperative source of variety in a system with only two basic<br/>modes (major and minor) and a more narrowly channeled set of vertical<br/>progressions and relations.</p><p>At the same time, the shift in vertical aesthetics toward a<br/>fundamental contrast between concordant and boldly dissonant<br/>sonorities defining a key might make the graduated acoustical<br/>&quot;dissonance&quot; of the thirds and sixths in a 12-note well-temperament<br/>a less obtrusive compromise.</p><p>In fact, a theorist such as Kirnberger (1771) sees this contrast as a<br/>positive virtue. In a discussion of the older modal system and its<br/>treatment in some works of Bach, Kirnberger reflects that &quot;the old<br/>style of writing has real advantages which are missing in the new<br/>style.&quot; In the latter system, &quot;where the keys are divided into twelve<br/>major and twelve minor ones,&quot; the modes are reduced to two,<br/>restricting many &quot;expressive&quot; possibilities of the older system.[18]</p><p>           &quot;However, as we shall see below, each of the<br/>            twelve major and minor keys has its own<br/>            character as the result of temperament.&quot;[19]</p><p>Thus an unequal well-temperament of the kind introduced by<br/>Werckmeister and very likely applied to Bach&apos;s WTC in 1722 not only<br/>made free transpositions available as a prime element of variety in<br/>the new key system, but augmented that variety by lending contrasting<br/>acoustical &quot;colors&quot; to these transpositions of what appeared on paper<br/>to be identical intervals, scale patterns, and key progressions.</p><p>The Manneristic approach offers the radical alternative of a system of<br/>12 modes and 31 steps, combining modal flexibility, full circulation<br/>if desired, and chromatic and enharmonic nuances making the meantone<br/>diesis a high artistic resource as well as a mathematical necessity.</p><p>To conclude, both the meantone keyboard tunings of the Manneristic Era<br/>(including those for 19-note and 31-note instruments), and the 12-note<br/>well-temperaments of Bach&apos;s era, may reflect as well as reinforce the<br/>stylistic preferences of these eras. Each system has its own unique<br/>possibilities.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. Giovanni Paolo Cima, _Partito de Ricercari &amp; Canzoni Alla Francese<br/>(1606)_, ed. Clare G.

Some of the &quot;active thirds&quot;  that<br/>Margo speaks of may have really nailed them to the wall in 12th century<br/>harmony, but today a Pythagorean third just flips a lot of people out.  They<br/>start hiding from it on the keyboard.<br/>      Making the consonances as consonant as possible has a cost. The<br/>dissonances are as dissonant as possible and you have a restrictive tuning.<br/>This seems to have been left behind by the early 1700&apos;s,  and from then on,<br/>the contrasts were continually reduced during  circular/irregular<br/>temperament&apos;s 200 year evolution.

A Werckmiester<br/>causes most everybody to sit up and notice.<br/>   Recognizing key color is a learned skill, and no amount of verbal<br/>communication will teach it without actual exposure to the sounds.
