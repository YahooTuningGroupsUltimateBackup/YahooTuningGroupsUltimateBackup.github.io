Bifrost has two major thirds<br/>worse than those of 12-et, Asbru deals with this at the expense of the<br/>fifths and the 14/11 thirds. It was created by an rms optimization<br/>against the target major thirds of Bifrost; this did not completely<br/>determine the values, so a second optimization was done for the fifths.</p><p>Asbru has three 12-et major thirds, 400 cents, six nice 3.29 cent<br/>sharp major thirds, and three thirds sharper than 14/11 by precisely<br/>the same 3.29 cents. In the minor third department, it has<br/>two 12-et minor thirds, 300 cents, six minor thirds flat by 5.24<br/>cents, two minor thirds sharper than 13/11 by a mere 0.39 cents, and<br/>two subminor thirds sharper than 7/6 by 12.33 cents. Tuning optimists<br/>may prefer to regard the last as a 20/17 third.</p><p>In the fifths department, we have eight of 12-ets excellent fifths,<br/>two fifths sharp by 8.44 cents, and two fifths flat by 12.35 cents. It<br/>should be noted that 12.35 cents is still less of an error than the<br/>13.69 cents the 400 cent thirds are off by, and quite a bit less than<br/>the 15.64 cents the 300 cent thirds are off by.</p><p>Asbru has a major tetrad on the fourth scale degree and minor tetrads<br/>on the first (sort of, at any rate) and sixth degrees.</p><p>Here are the triads:</p><p>1: [420.796166, 289.601917, 710.398083]<br/>2: [389.601917, 310.398083, 700.000000]<br/>3: [389.601917, 310.398083, 700.000000]<br/>4: [400.000000, 289.601917, 689.601917]<br/>5: [389.601917, 300.000000, 689.601917]<br/>6: [420.796167, 279.203833, 700.000000]<br/>7: [389.601917, 310.398083, 700.000000]<br/>8: [400.000000, 310.398083, 710.398083]<br/>9: [389.601917, 310.398083, 700.000000]<br/>10 [389.601917, 310.398083, 700.000000]<br/>11 [420.796167, 279.203833, 700.000000]<br/>12 [400.000000, 300.000000, 700.000000]</p><p>Here is Asbru:</p><p>! asbru.scl<br/>Modified bifrost<br/>12<br/>!<br/>89.601917<br/>200.000000<br/>310.398083<br/>400.000000<br/>510.398083<br/>589.601917<br/>700.000000<br/>800.000000<br/>900.000000<br/>1010.398083<br/>1089.601917<br/>1200.000000</p></div>
