I&apos;ve been looking for something like this for years - I<br/>asked this list in 2004, and ever since have held the idea of creating<br/>it myself someday. Lovely to find that someone else has done the work<br/>for me, and has come up with a solution rather more elegant than what<br/>I had in mind :)</p><p>-Patrick</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;aleksanderbaath&quot; &lt;aleksanderbaath@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - modernization of Eivind Grovens project.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Portable pure tuning<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pure tuning is a tuning method not based on compromises in the intervals<br/>&gt; between the tones.
