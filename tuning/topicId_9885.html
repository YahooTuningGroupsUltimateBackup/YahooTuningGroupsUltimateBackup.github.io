<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Korg MS2000/MS2000R 4 microtones</h1><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2000 6:54:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>So I finally tracked down a Korg MS2000R (rack, no keyboard, the<br/>keyboard model is the MS2000), an analog<br/>modeling synth. At the store I entered my own user<br/>tuning but couldn&apos;t get it to work. The sales people<br/>didn&apos;t know the unit (it&apos;s brand new) and surely<br/>didn&apos;t know what I was talking about (tuning tables? microtones???).<br/>And of course they couldn&apos;t find a manual.<br/>A phone call to Korg product support revealed that they<br/>don&apos;t know how it works either &lt;grin&gt;. But I found a store that<br/>had one in stock ($650, Sam Yak) and now that I have it at home<br/>I found out, unlike my Korg 05R/W, I can save<br/>a different tuning for each patch instead of a global change<br/>that affects all the patches at once. This means that I<br/>can have Werkmeister on one patch and the user tuning on<br/>another.</p><p>There is only one user tuning table &lt;ouch&gt;. And there&apos;s the<br/>usual Korg tuning presets: Pure Major, Pure Minor,<br/>Arabic, Pythagorean, Werkmeister, Kirnberger, Selendro,<br/>and Pelog. I guess there&apos;s no stretch tuning because<br/>there are no piano patches.</p><p>Plenty of knobs to twiddle too.</p><p>Only 4 voices but for what I&apos;m doing, nut that&apos;s plenty. You<br/>might be able to hook two or more boxes to get more voices,<br/>but I haven&apos;t read enough of the manual to know.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
