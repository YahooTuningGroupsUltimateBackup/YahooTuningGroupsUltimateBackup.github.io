How<br/>&gt; many C&apos;s octaves are there below? above?  Why only those many?  Why<br/>&gt; are they 8 notes apart and not 10?  Why are they &quot;harmonics&quot; of each<br/>&gt; other?  How many C notes could you actually have on a piano that the<br/>&gt; human ear could hear if the keyboard could be infinite? Why are there<br/>&gt; not more?</p><p>i&apos;m perhaps not really answering any of your specific questions<br/>here, but you&apos;ll probably find this useful:</p><p>in the original paper i put online about my tuning theories<br/>(&lt;<a href="http://makeashorterlink.com/?M6C022302">http://makeashorterlink.com/?M6C022302</a>&gt; -- wait a moment<br/>for the redirected link to work), there&apos;s a section discussing<br/>a &quot;reference pitch&quot;, which i call &quot;C n^0&quot; and suggest as<br/>referring to either 1 Hz or 256 (= 2^8) Hz.</p><p>since my notation is based on prime-factoring, this makes<br/>&quot;middle-C&quot; either 2^8 in the former case or n^0 in the latter.</p><p>i also state here: &quot;The approximate range of human hearing is<br/>from 20 to 20,000 Hz. Described as powers of 2, this is roughly<br/>2^4 (=16) to 2^14 (= 16,384) Hz.&quot;  if &quot;middle C&quot; at 256 Hz is<br/>C n^0, this range is described as 2^(-4...+6).</p><p>they are &quot;harmonics&quot; of each other because they are all<br/>powers of 2, and by definition, the interval which most<br/>scales set up as the &quot;interval of equivalence&quot; is one whose<br/>bounding pitches have the frequency ratio of 2:1.</p><p>this ratio usually goes by the more familiar musical name<br/>of &quot;octave&quot; (abbreviated &quot;8ve&quot;), which is Latin for &quot;eighth&quot;.</p><p>during the medieval period, the standard scale in use was the<br/>heptatonic diatonic scale -- that is, 7 different pitches<br/>(&quot;heptatonic&quot; = &quot;7-tone&quot;) within one &quot;8ve&quot;, assumed to repeat<br/>exactly in all other &quot;8ves&quot;, and which have a mixture of both<br/>&quot;half-steps&quot; and &quot;whole-steps&quot; as the intervals between the<br/>degrees of the scale.</p><p>(&quot;diatonic&quot; is Greek for &quot;thru tones&quot;, because of the three<br/>basic _genera_ in ancient Greek theory, this was the one<br/>which had 2 tones in each &quot;tetrachord&quot;; the other two _genera_<br/>had an interval which was bigger and two which were smaller.<br/>see my &quot;Tutorial on ancient Greek tetrachord-theory&quot;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://makeashorterlink.com/?X65121302">http://makeashorterlink.com/?X65121302</a>&gt; for more info.)</p><p>when listening to a scale such as this, one is immediately<br/>struck by how similar the 8th note (doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s<br/>the 8th note below or the 8th note above the starting pitch)<br/>sounds like the starting note.</p><p>thus, the &quot;8ve&quot; became the most basic interval involved in<br/>scale construction as well as harmonic usage and analysis.</p><p>i suggest you peruse the following definitions from my<br/>Tuning Dictionary:</p><p><a href="/tuning/files/dict/harm.htm">/tuning/files/dict/harm.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/harmser.htm">/tuning/files/dict/harmser.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/equivalenceinterval.htm">/tuning/files/dict/equivalenceinterval.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/octave.htm">/tuning/files/dict/octave.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/diatonic.htm">/tuning/files/dict/diatonic.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/tetrachd.htm">/tuning/files/dict/tetrachd.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/semi.htm">/tuning/files/dict/semi.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/wholetone.htm">/tuning/files/dict/wholetone.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/degree.htm">/tuning/files/dict/degree.htm</a></p><p>later (c. 1200s to 1300s), mainly thru the process of &quot;mutation&quot;,<br/>the scale resources expanded to include what we would now call<br/>the &quot;flats&quot; and &quot;sharps&quot;, eventually leading to the &quot;chromatic&quot;<br/>scale.</p><p>during the early development of Western music, from its origins<br/>in the Frankish kingdom c. 700 up to the recognition of &quot;3rds&quot;<br/>and &quot;6ths&quot; as &quot;consonances&quot; c. 1500, the &quot;Pythagorean&quot; (3-limit)<br/>scale was the basic tuning.</p><p>after 1500, 5-limit &quot;just-intonation&quot; became a theoretical<br/>paradigm but proved difficult to achieve in practice, leading<br/>to the idea of &quot;temperament&quot;.  in roughly chronological order,<br/>the leading families of temperaments have been &quot;meantone&quot;,<br/>&quot;well-temperament&quot;, and then &quot;equal-temperament&quot;.</p><p>for a long time it has been recognized that 12 different pitches<br/>could form a nearly-closed circle, and by tempering, it could<br/>become an actual closed circle.  thus during the 1900s the<br/>tuning standard became &quot;12-tone equal-temperament&quot;, so that<br/>the 2:1 ratio or &quot;8ve&quot; now contained 12 different notes, each<br/>one spaced the same distance from those adjacent to it.</p><p>more definitions:</p><p><a href="/tuning/files/dict/mutation.htm">/tuning/files/dict/mutation.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/chromati.htm">/tuning/files/dict/chromati.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/major3rd.htm">/tuning/files/dict/major3rd.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/minor3rd.htm">/tuning/files/dict/minor3rd.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/consonance.htm">/tuning/files/dict/consonance.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/pythag.htm">/tuning/files/dict/pythag.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/limit.htm">/tuning/files/dict/limit.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/just.htm">/tuning/files/dict/just.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/temp.htm">/tuning/files/dict/temp.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/meantone.htm">/tuning/files/dict/meantone.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/well.htm">/tuning/files/dict/well.htm</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dict/eqtemp.htm">/tuning/files/dict/eqtemp.htm</a></p><p>the real question about the range of the piano keyboard<br/>(a real piano has 88 keys, or a range of about 7&amp;1/2 &quot;8ves&quot;)<br/>is not &quot;why aren&apos;t there more notes?&quot;, but rather &quot;why are<br/>there that many?&quot;.  the notes at either end of the keyboard<br/>are so low or high that their pitch can barely be discerned,<br/>and they&apos;re usually used only in combination with like notes<br/>an &quot;8ve&quot; apart, to give and effect of increased depth or<br/>brilliance respectively.</p><p>for an illustration and explanation of a keyboard that was<br/>designed to use the 24-tone equal-temperament, commonly known<br/>as the &quot;quarter-tone scale&quot;, see my newly updated web version<br/>(with Klaus Schmirler&apos;s English translation) of Willi<br/>M&iuml;&iquest;&half;llendorff&apos;s _Musik mit Viertelt&iuml;&iquest;&half;nen_ (Music With<br/>Quarter Tones) at &lt;<a href="http://makeashorterlink.com/?L67124302">http://makeashorterlink.com/?L67124302</a>&gt;.</p><p>the diagram of the keyboard is here:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://makeashorterlink.com/?C1A123302">http://makeashorterlink.com/?C1A123302</a>&gt;.</p><p>-monz  (this group&apos;s list-mom)<br/>&quot;all roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=39253 href="#39253">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/5/2002 12:07:27 PM</span><button style="float: right;
