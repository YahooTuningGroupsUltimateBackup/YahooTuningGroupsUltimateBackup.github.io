It was without a doubt the<br/>finest piece of music I&apos;ve heard in years, of any genre or culture. It rose above the mindless<br/>destruction being carried on around him. The virtuosity was stunning. It was obviously improvised,<br/>though it sounded like an elaborate working of a vocal chant. All I can say is that it was very<br/>&quot;Eastern&quot; and microtonal in the extreme.</p><p>Apart from wanting to make or find one of these instruments I&apos;d be interested to know what scales<br/>or modes this musician would have been playing. A poor guy in rural Afghanistan in 2002.</p><p>Regards.<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=35138 href="#35138">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2002 12:10:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig Grady wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello Alison!<br/>&gt;     Usually one of the tubes is a drone with the other having large equidistant holes giving on a subharmonic scales often going down to the 14 if not more.

I look forward to seeking out some of this music and to exploring how one might build such an instrument.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div>
