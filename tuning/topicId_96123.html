The Pythagorean comma is easy to understand if you first imagine a 2-dimensional tuning space where the x-axis is powers of 3/1 and the y-axis is powers of 2/1.  It&apos;s obvious from this conception that because 2 &amp; 3 are co-prime, no amount of movement along the axes will do anything but lead to larger and larger ratios--any power of 3 will be co-prime with a power of 2.  No power of 3 will ever equal a power of 2, so you&apos;ll never be able to subtract a power of 2 from a power of 3 and get 0, but you *can* get arbitrarily close to 0.  A comma in this space is really just a point where a power of 3 comes close to a power of 2, such that when put into a ratio, the ratio is close to 1/1.</p><p>Now, imagine that we just &quot;say&quot; a given comma EQUALS 1/1.  We have basically assigned values x and y such that 2^x=3^y, meaning that some power of 2 *does equal* some power of 3.  What this effectively does is &quot;collapse&quot; our two-dimensional space into a one-dimensional space, because there is now an equivalence relationship between powers of 2&apos;s and powers of 3&apos;s, meaning we can now get to some powers of 2 using only powers of 3.  This means subtracting 3^y from 2^x will equal 0, in other words getting us back to our root note.  At this point, because we have collapsed a 2-dimensional space to a 1-dimensional one, we have a &quot;Rank-1&quot; temperament, aka an EDO.  In the case of the Pythagorean comma, tempering it out gives 12-EDO.</p><p>So in the 3-limit, we can actually call ANY 3-limit ratio a &quot;comma&quot; and temper it out to get an EDO.  If we temper out 9/8 (which is the difference between 3^2 and 2^3, i.e. 9/1 and 8/1), we get 2-EDO, for example.</p><p>Now, the interesting thing is that we can also take that 2-dimensional space and, instead of tempering, just draw a &quot;boundary&quot; at the comma.  I mean, 3-limit JI effectively contains an infinite number of intervals, right?  But what if we just draw a boundary using the Pythagorean comma, and make a &quot;box&quot; in the 2-D space--we&apos;re saying &quot;we&apos;re only going to use notes in this box&quot;.  Well, now we have a 12-note scale, but this scale will have two step-sizes instead of one.  It is, in fact, what we would call a &quot;distributionally-even&quot; (DE) scale, wherein the small steps are as evenly-distributed between the large steps as possible.  If we draw our box using the comma 3^7/2^11 (2187/2048), we get the Pythagorean diatonic scale, which is the result of stacking seven 3/1&apos;s (or 3/2&apos;s) and reducing to fit in 1 octave.  Again, two step sizes and DE.</p><p>Now, what about the 5-limit?  Here, we have 3 primes: 2, 3, and 5, so our tuning space is 3-D, rather than 2-D.  Tempering out a single comma (whether it&apos;s a (2,3) comma, (2,5) comma, or (3,5) comma doesn&apos;t matter) does NOT get us to an EDO.  It gets us to a 2-D tuning-space, where we can either temper out another comma to get an EDO or we can draw a boundary using another comma to get a DE scale.  We can also, in this 3-D space, use two commas to define a block, and this is where the JI diatonic scale comes from.  The JI diatonic scale has three step-sizes: 16/15, 10/9, and 9/8, and anyone who tells you that this is the scale that music theory is founded on, they have no idea what they&apos;re talking about.  This scale does not translate to the circle/spiral of fifths at all, since it&apos;s inherently 3-dimensional.</p><p>This is what took me the longest time to figure out.  To get to &quot;Meantone Temperament&quot; in from 5-limit JI, you start by collapsing the 5-limit so that it can be described by a &quot;warped 3-limit&quot;, by setting 81/80 (aka 3^4/(5*(2^4))) equal to 1/1.  At this point, I&apos;m not sure but I *think* you have exactly 1/4-comma meantone.  THEN, you can temper out any number of 3-limit commas to get to a variety of EDOs, and any of them will technically be &quot;versions of Meantone temperament&quot;.  However, they will not all be psychoacoustically &quot;valid&quot; versions of Meantone, because depending on the size of the Pythagorean comma you temper out to get to your EDO, you might warp the (already warped) 3-limit so much that four 3/2&apos;s minus two 2/1&apos;s no longer gets you to something that actually sounds like a 5/4.  So to get an EDO that does a good job of approximating Meantone, you need to temper out a small 3-limit comma, i.e. one that is close to 1/1.  You can also think of this 3-limit comma as just &quot;modifying the size&quot; of 81/80, since both 81/80 and your 3-limit comma of choice will be used to alter the size of your 3/1 (and by octave equivalence, your 3/2 as well).</p><p>HTH!  Oh, and if I got something wrong in this explanation, I hope someone will correct me.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some of the points Gene makes seem to be related to The Book&apos;s<br/>&gt; purpose.

(29/6 is a good harmony interval in my system.)</p><p>Your elucidation makes sense but it&apos;s seems to me to be at odds with my own approach. I know a little bit about commas and (if you can believe it) I rediscovered meantone temperament in the late 90&apos;s by using the fourth root of 80 instead of 3 in the circle of fifths.</p><p>I should point out that my meantone had seventeen notes where (if D is the starting note and you go up 8 notes and down 8 notes from D) A# was slightly lower than Bb, C# was slightly lower than Db and so on. But I think regular meantone is a subset of this.</p><p>My approach has nothing at all to do with commas. I choose a tonic (1/1) and I select eleven more notes (between 1/1 and 2/1) so that (i) all the chosen notes go well with the tonic, 1/1 and (ii) the greatest possible number of *good* harmony intervals (either containing the tonic or otherwise and an octave or less wide) occur, over a one octave range.

We have basically assigned values x and y such that 2^x=3^y, meaning that some power of 2 *does equal* some power of 3.  What this effectively does is &quot;collapse&quot; our two-dimensional space into a one-dimensional space, because there is now an equivalence relationship between powers of 2&apos;s and powers of 3&apos;s, meaning we can now get to some powers of 2 using only powers of 3.  This means subtracting 3^y from 2^x will equal 0, in other words getting us back to our root note.  At this point, because we have collapsed a 2-dimensional space to a 1-dimensional one, we have a &quot;Rank-1&quot; temperament, aka an EDO.  In the case of the Pythagorean comma, tempering it out gives 12-EDO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So in the 3-limit, we can actually call ANY 3-limit ratio a &quot;comma&quot; and temper it out to get an EDO.  If we temper out 9/8 (which is the difference between 3^2 and 2^3, i.e. 9/1 and 8/1), we get 2-EDO, for example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, the interesting thing is that we can also take that 2-dimensional space and, instead of tempering, just draw a &quot;boundary&quot; at the comma.  I mean, 3-limit JI effectively contains an infinite number of intervals, right?  But what if we just draw a boundary using the Pythagorean comma, and make a &quot;box&quot; in the 2-D space--we&apos;re saying &quot;we&apos;re only going to use notes in this box&quot;.  Well, now we have a 12-note scale, but this scale will have two step-sizes instead of one.  It is, in fact, what we would call a &quot;distributionally-even&quot; (DE) scale, wherein the small steps are as evenly-distributed between the large steps as possible.  If we draw our box using the comma 3^7/2^11 (2187/2048), we get the Pythagorean diatonic scale, which is the result of stacking seven 3/1&apos;s (or 3/2&apos;s) and reducing to fit in 1 octave.  Again, two step sizes and DE.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, what about the 5-limit?  Here, we have 3 primes: 2, 3, and 5, so our tuning space is 3-D, rather than 2-D.  Tempering out a single comma (whether it&apos;s a (2,3) comma, (2,5) comma, or (3,5) comma doesn&apos;t matter) does NOT get us to an EDO.  It gets us to a 2-D tuning-space, where we can either temper out another comma to get an EDO or we can draw a boundary using another comma to get a DE scale.  We can also, in this 3-D space, use two commas to define a block, and this is where the JI diatonic scale comes from.  The JI diatonic scale has three step-sizes: 16/15, 10/9, and 9/8, and anyone who tells you that this is the scale that music theory is founded on, they have no idea what they&apos;re talking about.  This scale does not translate to the circle/spiral of fifths at all, since it&apos;s inherently 3-dimensional.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is what took me the longest time to figure out.  To get to &quot;Meantone Temperament&quot; in from 5-limit JI, you start by collapsing the 5-limit so that it can be described by a &quot;warped 3-limit&quot;, by setting 81/80 (aka 3^4/(5*(2^4))) equal to 1/1.  At this point, I&apos;m not sure but I *think* you have exactly 1/4-comma meantone.

Because by then I understood that tempering out<br/>&gt; &gt; the Pythagorean comma gave a circle of fifths, and I knew that was<br/>&gt; &gt; desirable, I was able to see that tempering other commas might be<br/>&gt; &gt; useful for other reasons. (I still don&apos;t know what all the reasons<br/>&gt; &gt; might be, but I figure I&apos;ll learn some as I lurk.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So that&apos;s why I suggest that specific structure for the book: octaves,<br/>&gt; &gt; fifths, and fourths show how the familiar 12-EDO maps almost perfectly<br/>&gt; &gt; to the harmonic series. 5-limit ratios build out the diatonic scale<br/>&gt; &gt; (without mentioning how badly &quot;out of tune&quot; they are in 12-EDO).<br/>&gt; &gt; Stacking intervals seems like a normal and reasonable way to build out<br/>&gt; &gt; a scale, and that leads to the circle of fifths.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Which fails to circulate, contrary to expectation.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And that leads directly to commas and temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This may not be the way you want to think about commas now, but as a<br/>&gt; &gt; didactic approach I thought it could be effective.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; One thing there is, which you don&apos;t mention, are a variety of ways of constructing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; JI scales in a systematic way--Fokker blocks, combination product sets, Euler generi,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; dwarves, etc.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have a lot to learn. I tried reading about dwarves on the<br/>&gt; &gt; Xenharmonic wiki and didn&apos;t get it fully -- I wasn&apos;t even sure whether<br/>&gt; &gt; it applies to JI specifically or if it is used to generate selections<br/>&gt; &gt; of notes from other scales, that&apos;s how ignorant I am. And I don&apos;t know<br/>&gt; &gt; anything substantial about the others, either.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This kind of thing might make it reasonable to break some things into<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;basic&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; sections: basic JI theory giving what I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; given, leading to the circle of fifths (that isn&apos;t), leading to<br/>&gt; &gt; commas, leading to basic temperament theory. Later, an advanced JI<br/>&gt; &gt; section could deal with the other things you mention, and it seems<br/>&gt; &gt; likely that an advanced temperament section could be useful, too.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ** Regular temperaments [are &quot;well-temperaments&quot; included in this?]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; They&apos;d better be--those are of central importance.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I wasn&apos;t sure which was a subset of the other.

We have basically assigned values x and y such that 2^x=3^y, meaning that some power of 2 *does equal* some power of 3.  What this effectively does is &quot;collapse&quot; our two-dimensional space into a one-dimensional space, because there is now an equivalence relationship between powers of 2&apos;s and powers of 3&apos;s, meaning we can now get to some powers of 2 using only powers of 3.  This means subtracting 3^y from 2^x will equal 0, in other words getting us back to our root note.  At this point, because we have collapsed a 2-dimensional space to a 1-dimensional one, we have a &quot;Rank-1&quot; temperament, aka an EDO.  In the case of the Pythagorean comma, tempering it out gives 12-EDO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So in the 3-limit, we can actually call ANY 3-limit ratio a &quot;comma&quot; and temper it out to get an EDO.  If we temper out 9/8 (which is the difference between 3^2 and 2^3, i.e. 9/1 and 8/1), we get 2-EDO, for example.</p><p>I think it would be good to point out the two general motivations for choosing commas: accuracy and simplicity. Accuracy is how close to 1 your ratio that you&apos;re setting equal to one actually is, and simplicity is how few powers of your primes you have to go through to get to that comma.</p><p> The pythagorean comma is a good compromise between the two because when you set 3^12=2^19, you are setting 524,288=531,441. Dividing both sides by 524,288 shows that you are setting 1.01364326... equal to 1. That&apos;s relatively close to being true, so tempering that comma is retains reasonable accuracy, and we didn&apos;t have to go very far in powers of 2 and three the get there, so it&apos;s reasonably simple.</p><p>Tempering 9/8=1/1 (which you do by setting 3^2=2^3) gives you 1.125=1. Not near as accurate as the pythagorean comma (1.0136...=1), but it is admittedly MUCH simpler. You go through very few powers of 2 and 3 to get to this comma.</p><p>Conversely, if you go much much further in the powers of 3 and 2, you can set 3^53=2^84 tempering a comma so that 1.00209031=1. This comma gives you extremely good accuracy compared to the pythagorean comma, but it is also far more *complex*, taking far more powers of 2 and 3 to reach.</p><p>This battle between accuracy and simplicity has perceptual implications. Commas that are too complex (regardless of their accuracy) tend to lead to musical structures that are hard to deal with compositionally and in performance, and they&apos;re hard to follow for a listener. Commas that are too inaccurate (regardless of simplicity) will lead to musical structures with very out of tune harmonies that will probably make you cringe.</p><p>As per your taste, you may lean towards exploring temperaments with inaccurate commas that have unique or simple structures, or you may decide to work with some of the overly complex temperaments to take advantage of some very precise harmonies. Just as a general rule though, people seem to gravitate towards compromises between the two.</p><p>John</p></div><h3><a id=96132 href="#96132">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2011 2:39:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m not Igs, but I&apos;ll respond to the obvious math questions anyway.</p><p>On Wed, Feb 9, 2011 at 5:28 PM, john777music &lt;jfos777@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What about 29 limit?

There&apos;s no reason you couldn&apos;t do a 2.3.5.7.29 subgroup.  Although if you only want 29/6 and not 29/1 (or 29/4, 29/8, 29/16 etc.) you can do a 2.3.5.7.29/6 or a 2.3.5.7.29/3 subgroup.  The beauty of tuning space is that you can construct it however you want.</p><p>However, if you&apos;re working with octaves, you&apos;re not going to be able to avoid getting 29/12 and 29/24 if you have 29/3 or 29/6.  And 29/24 isn&apos;t a very strong identity, I believe it&apos;s firmly in the dyadic entropy well of 6/5.  Thus I&apos;m pretty sure if you try to combine 5-limit consonances with ratios of 29, the two are going to fight each other during optimization and probably end up splitting the difference and having 29/24 mapped to the same interval as 6/5.</p><p>&gt; My approach has nothing at all to do with commas.</p><p>From your description, it sounds like your approach is very similar to that taken by Michael S. (aka djtrancendance).  If I understand it correctly, your approach has little to do with commas because it has little to do with limits.  You have worked out a set of ratios that you consider desirable, and you have worked out an error threshold that you consider to be acceptable, as well as a maximum number of notes.  I&apos;ll have to read your book to get much deeper into the nuts and bolts.</p><p>Looking at your Blue JI scale, it looks to me to be a 4-dimensional scale of mostly 5-limit intervals but with two notes that poke into the dimension of prime-7, as Kraig handily diagrammed here with the dimension of prime-2 omitted since octaves are equivalent:</p><p><a href="http://anaphoria.com/OsullivanBLUESjiscale.gif">http://anaphoria.com/OsullivanBLUESjiscale.gif</a></p><p>As a JI scale, I&apos;d say it&apos;s better than strict 5-limit chromatic (which has a 16/15 and a 45/32 instead of 15/14 and 7/5), but still has all the same problems all JI systems do: limited modulation ability due to harsh discords in distant keys.</p><p>Now, your temperament is essentially what is considered a &quot;well-temperament&quot;, whereby intervals are tempered less in some keys and more in others.  The end result is something which really isn&apos;t all that different than 1/4-comma meantone or the Meantone[12] scale in 31-EDO.

The &quot;regular temperament paradigm&quot; is a relatively recent innovation, LOOOOOONG after the advent of Meantone.  I should note though that 12-EDO is actually much older than we take it to be, having been discovered in China as an essentially 3-limit temperament (which it is very good for).  But no, the conception of multi-dimensional tuning spaces had absolutely nothing to do with the historical procession from JI to Meantone to 12-tET.  However, I suspect that that is because people were so fixated on a particular small subset of harmonies that they never bothered to explore alternatives.  The idea of generating a musical scale by chaining some interval other than a fifth, and arriving at a temperament from some other comma, is quite rare (if not nonexistent) in the history of musical tunings.  So no one ever bothered to try to generalize the theory of temperament to a higher level of mathematical abstraction until very recently.  But the results of these recent innovations have been quite remarkable.  There are some fascinating alternative temperaments now at our disposal, and although none match both the simplicity and the accuracy of Meantone for dealing with 5-limit harmonies, there is much to be said of exploring equally-simple, equally-accurate, or different prime-limit (or subgroup) temperaments.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=96157 href="#96157">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2011 10:33:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; How would you get golden meantone then - you&apos;d have to have real<br/>&gt; monzos, rather than fractional ones?</p><p>This is why I said I was oversimplifying.

Then the fifth crept up sharper values, and circulating temperaments were introduced, until finally 12edo was accepted as the theoretical standard.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Big hulking question...so why was 12EDO considered over 31EDO (IE virtually the same as quarter-comma-meantone)?</p><p>Probably because those ~9/7&apos;s still kind of sound like 5/4&apos;s, and<br/>those wolf 3/2&apos;s still kind of sound like 3/2&apos;s.

First it was mainly didactic, as you very well just pointed in your example of Dudon(81/80) in the sense that it lights up a relation between some of our most common traditional scales (here the anhemitonic pentatonic scale) and some archetypal co&iuml;ncidences between harmonics (such as between 3 and 5 here with the syntonic comma). So the idea was to see if I could find other examples, and I did find many indeed. Then it was tempting to compare the musicality of all possible commas through this very basic traduction, and to compare musicalities produced by different limits, etc.  Also while doing this I started quickly to extend this idea to groups of two or three commas together, and to use it as a tool for scale creation.<br/>Another purpose was more directly related with a specific photosonic disk technique that I call omission, where I replace one black arc every one given number of them, by a blank space. This generates a subharmonic drone in polyphony. And commas are simply the kind of notes that will generate the more rich polyphonies.</p><p>&gt; (1) One thing it does is to find simple intervals between which there is the comma.

You could also do the same procedure with 2 (replacing it with 2-alpha=Two), and any other primes I&apos;d like to. I was going to ask why people only reduce with the Three and never talk about messing with the Two -- you could, after all, reduce the sharpness of the 12-tET major third by flattening the octave (i.e., reducing the Two). But after spending too much time in Excel I realized what should have been intuitive: Even with a 10-cent decrease in the octave (i.e., an octave = 1190 cents, or Two = 0.012), tempering out the Pythagorean comma (Three^12)/(Two^19) = 1 yields little substantial benefit. A fifth is very flat at 694 cents, a major third is still way too sharp at 397 cents.</p><p>This does make me note the difference between 19-tET and 19-EDO: You could temper the octave to make a 19-tET that&apos;s a little bit &quot;better&quot; than 19-EDO. (By &quot;better&quot;, of course, I mean &quot;something that I like more&quot;.  I tend to be bothered much more by flat notes than by sharp ones.)

In the course of my investigations I encountered &quot;heroes&quot; (such as Helmholtz, Partch and Fokker) and &quot;villains&quot; (naysayers such as Paul Hindemith and sources of misinformation masquerading as &quot;authorities&quot; who have written articles for music reference books) who often disgreed with one another.  Independent study enabled me to sort through the contradictions and half-truths in order to draw my own conclusions, and before long I was exploring new territory (such as grouping EDO&apos;s into temperament classes according to generating intervals) and discovering useful concepts (such as odd-limit consistency in EDO&apos;s).  Having gone beyond what I had learned from my reading, I became a primary source of information, one who could speak from first-hand experience, qualified to write The Book.</p><p>After writing about ten chapters I realized that I didn&apos;t have a satistifactory notation (or notations) for all of the tunings I wanted to cover, so I decided to suspend work on the book until I had adequately addressed that problem.  Around that time I was contacted by several members of this tuning list and invited to participate.  It was here that I was introduced to Dave Keenan, and together we spent several years working on a system of notation that will handle tunings much more complicated and diverse than I had ever anticipated.</p><p>Nine years later I have not yet gotten back to working on The Book, which is now sorely in need of an overhaul, since so much has taken place in the interim.  Whereas I originally conceived this as paper-and-ink hard copy, I&apos;m now thinking of something on CD-ROM, with numerous links to sound files to illustrate brief musical examples discussed in the text.  I&apos;m thinking that this would initially be made available (at no cost) only to members of the tuning lists as a work in progress, with suggestions and constructive criticism welcomed!</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jake Freivald wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I would love to see a book on tuning theory.

I would want to include sound files of entire compositions (in a variety of styles, from a variety of contributors) that demonstrate or exemplify techniques and tunings discussed in the text.  I would also like to include articles written by others on these lists as additional resources that go into greater detail on selected topics that may be of special interest.</p><p>As Dr. Oz observed, this is a very ambitious project, and I don&apos;t expect to be able to do it alone.  When I undertook my notation project, I had no idea that it would take about ten times as long as I expected and that the result would be at least ten times as versatile as I had imagined -- and it would not have been possible without having Dave Keenan as collaborator, not to mention those who contributed helpful suggestions and encouragement.  If anyone else would like to help me with this project, I would be most grateful.  There are probably some out there who could contribute a chapter or two on topics in which you have more knowledge and expertise than I do.</p><p>I should mention that I was not expecting to resume work on my book for another 3 years, at which time I plan to retire from my full-time job.  But since there has been so much discussion about the need for The Book, I&apos;m thinking that perhaps this may be the time to review my chapter outline and start reworking those ten chapters.</p><p>Your thoughts, anyone?</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=96267 href="#96267">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2011 7:22:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Feb 13, 2011 at 2:09 AM, gdsecor &lt;gdsecor@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nine years later I have not yet gotten back to working on The Book, which is now sorely in need of an overhaul, since so much has taken place in the interim.
