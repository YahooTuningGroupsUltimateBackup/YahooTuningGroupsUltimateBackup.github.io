However, in no way is a fourth alone more utonal than a fifth alone,<br/>any more than a first-inversion major triad is more utonal than a<br/>root-position major triad. In Partch&apos;s theory, whether a triad is in root<br/>position, first inversion, or second inversion does not affect its important<br/>characteristics: whether it is utonal or otonal and what identities it<br/>contains. In this sense, a fourth may be construed as either the 1 and 3<br/>odentitites or the 1 and 3 udentities. A fifth may also be construed both<br/>ways.</p><p>&gt;In contrast, the utonal trine (3,4,6) or triad (10,12,15)<br/>&gt;has for its lowest note a partial which is not an even octave of the<br/>&gt;fundamental.</p><p>Since the lowest note doesn&apos;t matter for Partch&apos;s purposes, I see an<br/>important difference here: the utonal trine (i.e., 3-limit Utonality)<br/>contains a note which is an octave of the &quot;fundamental&quot;, while the utonal<br/>triad (i.e., 5-limit Utonality) does not. In fact, no higher-limit utonal<br/>chord will contain a note octave-equivalent to the &quot;fundamental&quot; (which, in<br/>Partch&apos;s terms, is really the Unity of the simplest otonal representation of<br/>the utonality -- not very simple even in the 7-limit: (60,70,84,105)).</p></div>
