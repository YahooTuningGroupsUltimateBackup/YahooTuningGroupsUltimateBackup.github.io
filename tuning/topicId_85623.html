That concept is minimizing the different between low and high points in volume in a music track (often done with compressors, maximizers...but, I&apos;m am starting to believe, also possible at least in part by reducing beating/difference-tones even over tiny periods of time).</p><p>    Attached are graphs of major and minor chords, which have the exact same intervals only in reverse.<br/>     So (as discussed before) you&apos;d think that they would have the same roughness and consonance...but most people instantly sense the major triad is more relaxed sounding.  But, when you look at the pictures, you&apos;ll notice a beautifully level part of the wave graph (highlighted in white) where the beating is minimized and no such &quot;beat-less&quot; rest in any part of the minor chord.</p><p>    IMVHO...this all seems to say that we should actually consider things like compression and maximization on scales to help fine-tune them and see how they adjust certain frequencies to obtain cool &quot;resting&quot; areas where the beats level-out as they do in the major chord.</p><p>  While it is true the human ear does prefer closer ratios at higher frequencies, the change in the curve over octaves in very slight and certainly not half as dramatic as the difference of the two intervals in the major vs. minor chord...which is why I&apos;m asking the question &quot;Do you think there&apos;s anything beyond the fact the human ear physiologically has a smaller critical band at higher frequencies that causes the preference for major vs. minor&quot;?</p></div><h3><a id=85646 href="#85646">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forro &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2010 10:08:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Just few points of amused distant observer who will not take part in:</p><p>- Competitions are possible in sports or in eating hamburgers. Not in the art, where result is based mainly on subjective opinion of jury. It&apos;s easy to judge quantity, not so easy to judge quality, and very difficult to judge artistic quality. There is some mechanistic, technical &quot;craftsmanship&quot; even in the art, but the rest (if there&apos;s some) is a pure magic. Somebody can like, somebody not.</p><p>- And I mean jury of well selected experts, not public voting (OK, here are also selected experts only)</p><p>- Voting - hm, participants shouldn&apos;t vote... But anyway if each of them votes for himself, result is the same...</p><p>- This &quot;competition&quot; is not primarily targeted on the artistic quality, to me it&apos;s not quite clear what will be measured - quantity or quality? By which method? Melody, harmony, consonance...?</p><p>- That Beethoven&apos;s work of course WAS written for 12ET. I&apos;m not aware at all about any mention, or note, or consideration about tuning issues from the side of this particular composer. Also his works don&apos;t show anything like results of similar research or considerations. Maybe just &quot;colors&quot; of different keys... So maybe he was aware of tuning, but not so deeply to think about commas. Correct me if I&apos;m wrong in this.</p><p>- I would understand if somebody offers money to support some talented person, research, institution, society or foundation as an independent decision of independent unbiased donor. But here a person offering money will take part in the competition, what more - even to change all works sent by participants. And anonymity of participants is not allowed.</p><p>- Nothing to say about the fact this person&apos;s target probably is only to show that his work is the best one...</p><p>- OK, money price, yes, why not. Some people will take part in just for money, we all have to pay our bills. But beg you pardon - all this rumour for 100 Euro?

A triad<br/>can also be looked as three overlapping dyads: for C major you have C-E,<br/>E-G, and C-G, for example. It can also be looked at as three individual<br/>notes: C, E, and G, and it can be looked at as a fused triad: C-E-G.</p><p>For a minor chord, you have C-Eb-G. The C-Eb suggests a weak Ab fundamental,<br/>the Eb-G suggests a slightly stronger Eb fundamental, and the C-G suggests a<br/>very strong C fundamental. Looking at all of the notes separately, C Eb and<br/>G suggest themselves as fundamentals. And, while trying to place the triad<br/>as a whole, C-Eb-G suggests a very weak Ab fundamental, an octave below the<br/>Ab fundamental from the C-Eb.</p><p>You are no doubt familiar with the C, Eb, and G suggesting themselves as<br/>fundamentals -- that&apos;s why you can pick out the individual notes in the<br/>chord. You are also no doubt familiar with the C-G suggesting a C an octave<br/>below as the fundamental -- that&apos;s why the C-G in a minor chord seems so<br/>strong and resonant. You are also no doubt familiar with the<br/>second-strongest fundamental of the minor triad - the Eb-G dyad suggesting<br/>an Eb -- which is why a Cm chord can also function, in a sense, as an Ebmaj6<br/>chord.</p><p>You might not have thought of the C-Eb suggesting the Ab dyad, which is<br/>possibly why Aeolian tends to be the minor scale of choice in western music<br/>-- since it contains this bVI interval. You might also not have thought of<br/>the C-Eb-G suggesting a low Ab, which is kind of like thinking of a Cm triad<br/>as the upper partials of an Abmaj7 chord.</p><p>However, although you might not have thought of it, your brain certainly<br/>has. It is my opinion that the simultaneous existing of these modes is<br/>responsible for the characteristic &quot;flavor&quot; of the minor chord.</p><p>On the other hand, all of the fundamentals for all permutations of the C<br/>major chord are the exact same thing - a C, two octaves below the root. So<br/>there are only really two ways to see a C major chord: as three individual<br/>notes, C, E and G, or as a rock-solid chunk of the harmonic series referring<br/>to C two octaves below. If you think about your perception of the major<br/>chord, this will probably ring true on some level for you. It certainly does<br/>for me.</p><p>So it isn&apos;t a matter of that a minor chord is more &quot;dissonant&quot; than a major<br/>chord -- it&apos;s that it contains more possible modes of consonance. If we want<br/>to label this &quot;dissonance,&quot; then fine by me... I&apos;ve basically completely<br/>given up on the belief that there is a single quantifiable dimension of<br/>musical pleasantness at this point. This is certainly a different type of<br/>beast than the kind of dissonance talked about by detuning notes, which<br/>harmonic entropy models very well.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Wed, Jan 13, 2010 at 12:54 AM, Michael &lt;<a href="mailto:djtrancendance@yahoo.com">djtrancendance@yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;  [Attachment(s) &lt;#126263f7e1f76754_TopText&gt; from Michael included below]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Why is a major triad more consonant than a minor one (even with sine<br/>&gt; waves)...an alternative explanation.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       I have been fiddling around more and more with the same concept often<br/>&gt; taught in production workshops.

Let&apos;s take 7 possible scales: Locrian is out of the game because of its diminished fifth which doesn&apos;t create stable Tonic. Three major scales: Lydian is too much major, Ionian major,  Mixolydian little bit minor. Three minor scales: Dorian is little bit major, Aeolian minor, Phrygian too much minor. Now let&apos;s take Bb, the first flat which was used. Original all-white-keys (AWK) Dorian on D will be changed with it into Aeolian, original AWK Lydian on F will become Ionian. And with the first used sharp - F#, original AWK Phrygian on E will be turned into Aeolian, finally original AWK Mixolydian on G gives Ionian. It&apos;s highly possible this process happened this way. But maybe in some parallel world they have selected both extremes - Lydian as a main major and Phrygian as a main minor.

For the rest of us, though, I wonder if there&apos;s a solution to the extreme difficulty level involved in matching different scales in ways overtones don&apos;t clash terribly when &quot;cross-scale&quot; chords are played.  Same goes with things like 53-TET...it takes a huge learning curve and amount of thinking to quickly find the notes to &quot;perfect&quot; a chord when there are so many near-answers.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And always is questionable why there&apos;s a quest for consonance only,  it&apos;s limited view in my opinion. We need as well dissonances, at<br/>least for the contrast.&quot;</p><p>   To me, dissonance just seems so easy to add.  Simply adding noise, notes about a 1.05 ratio from each other, many notes close together at the same time, notes with bizarre timbres, faster tempo....can all create dissonance.  IMVHO, solving for dissonance is like saying for what values of x does is 14&lt;x&lt;18...where virtually everything not calculated adds to dissonance (what are the chances of a number hitting or nearing 16 out of all numbers?).</p><p>   Of course, there should be a contrast between the most consonant and dissonant chords in a scale, for example....but, unless you are using the harmonic series as your scale it&apos;s almost certain that there is a significant range between the highest consonance and dissonance in it.</p></div><h3><a id=85664 href="#85664">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2010 9:34:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Michael wrote:</p><p>&gt;    However, of course, there are people (myself included)<br/>&gt; who actually think too much harmonic distortion from closely-space periodic notes sounds mechnical and grating to the senses.</p><p>#1.

I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s impossible, but I have no clue even vaguely where to start on that one.<br/>  One easy way to take advantage of it that I do know where to start with...is to simply add more notes in between notes on higher octaves IE you could make a scale with 7 notes around 200hz which adds 2 more notes at 1600hz and pushes the notes around it up and down a tad to make space for it.</p><p>  An easy candidate for this is, for example, adding a c# between the large C and D (and the large A and B) intervals in the basic just-intonation diatonic scale ALA going from</p><p>1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1 to<br/>1/1 (17/16) 5/4 4/3 3/2 (19/12) 5/3 15/8  at 1600hz to take advantage of the closer gaps allowed at higher frequencies via the curve of critical band.</p><p>&gt;&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalms_chord">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalms_chord</a>&quot;</p><p>     Now that is one interesting chord...on one hand it sounds beautifully different...on the other hand it is a charged example IMVHO of why close intervals aren&apos;t used much in chords (roughness, not lack of periodicity: even if you play a JI-perfect version of the chord it will still &quot;bark&quot; at you).<br/>    Especially (if I got it right) the minor second &quot;hurts&quot;: to my ears anything closer than about a minor second plus an extra 1/4 tone space sounds too rough to be held as a dominant chord in a piece of music (sadly).   Hence why I&apos;m so gung-ho on the idea of searching for a hack to allow such chords (and several new ones) to &quot;bark&quot; enough less so they become much more useable.</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Chris Vaisvil &lt;<a href="mailto:chrisvaisvil@gmail.com">chrisvaisvil@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Wed, January 13, 2010 12:28:07 PM<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Why is a major triad more consonant than a minor one  (even with sine waves)...an alternative explanation.</p><p>Michael - I want to know what harmonic distortion means to you so that I might add to this conversation because I have a feeling you mean something different than the  distortion of the harmonic spectra of a tone....</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_harmonic_distortion">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_harmonic_distortion</a></p><p>I think any &quot;theory of consonance in tuning&quot; has to take register into account.

So<br/>when two voices are talking, after all is said and done, your brain<br/>realizes that there are two distinct spectra going on - one for each<br/>voice. It does not try to combine the two into one larger, super-voice<br/>-- likely because of tracking/envelope differences -- which just<br/>serves as a proof of a concept that yes, the brain can simultaneously<br/>track more than one fundamental at the same time, or fuse more than<br/>one series at the same time, or however you&apos;d like to call it.</p><p>That being said, when a triad is played, your ear again has no idea<br/>that cognitively speaking, we conceptualize of it as a triad. For a<br/>triad it will come up with 7 distinct spectra: one for each of the<br/>individual notes being played, one corresponding to the fundamental of<br/>the whole chord, and one corresponding for the fundamental of each<br/>dyad. For a major triad, the dyads C-E and E-G, as well as the triad<br/>C-E-G, will be the same, and the C-G dyad will be one octave up. So in<br/>reality you will have 5 different spectra, three of which are the same<br/>chroma - C.</p><p>If you just take a second to think about it, you will find that this<br/>makes perfect sense: our experience of a major chord is just this,<br/>three individual notes that on a more subconscious level fuse to<br/>create the virtual C an octave and 2 octaves below. I&apos;m not sure yet<br/>if your brain flips between all of the possible fundamentals, though<br/>-- as in an auditory version of the Necker Cube -- or hears them all<br/>simultaneously.</p><p>&gt; I have another original construction why Ionian was taken as basic<br/>&gt; major and Aeolian as basic minor scale, it&apos;s based on historical<br/>&gt; development of music. Besides you need for this only one sharp and<br/>&gt; one flat, and it can be also called theory of the golden rule of<br/>&gt; middle way. Let&apos;s take 7 possible scales: Locrian is out of the game<br/>&gt; because of its diminished fifth which doesn&apos;t create stable Tonic.<br/>&gt; Three major scales: Lydian is too much major, Ionian major,<br/>&gt; Mixolydian little bit minor. Three minor scales: Dorian is little bit<br/>&gt; major, Aeolian minor, Phrygian too much minor.</p><p>Well let&apos;s put it this way: assuming that the maj 2nd was picked over<br/>the min 2nd just because of its closer harmonic proximity to the root<br/>-- why was the min 6th picked over the maj 6th? My hypothesis is that<br/>it has something to do with the fact that spectrally speaking, it&apos;s<br/>already in the chord.</p><p>&gt; Now let&apos;s take Bb, the<br/>&gt; first flat which was used. Original all-white-keys (AWK) Dorian on D<br/>&gt; will be changed with it into Aeolian, original AWK Lydian on F will<br/>&gt; become Ionian. And with the first used sharp - F#, original AWK<br/>&gt; Phrygian on E will be turned into Aeolian, finally original AWK<br/>&gt; Mixolydian on G gives Ionian. It&apos;s highly possible this process<br/>&gt; happened this way. But maybe in some parallel world they have<br/>&gt; selected both extremes - Lydian as a main major and Phrygian as a<br/>&gt; main minor. It would give increased contrast between major and minor.<br/>&gt; Maybe George Russell came from such world...</p><p>&gt; I wouldn&apos;t call it extremely consonant by itself, it depends on the<br/>&gt; context. Meanwhile in the Baroque music it was still considered<br/>&gt; dissonant, in jazz or contemporary music it can sound consonantly in<br/>&gt; the comparison with more dissonant chords.

Owen Jorgensen&apos;s books gave us a start on understanding keyboard tuning practices, which according to him could not have been modern 12-tone edo. &nbsp; &nbsp;Abbe Vogler was an influential teacher &nbsp;in the late 1700&apos;s who introduced some of the most influential chromatic progressions used by the early Romantics; one would think that these would have required 12-tone edo, but the tuning system he proposed was not edu (he died in the 18-teens, I believe. &nbsp;There are string manuals from this period that clearly distinguish finger positions for sharps and flats (C# lower than Db), such as Romberg&apos;s, who played the early Beethoven cello sonatas. &nbsp;So the standard belief that Beethoven&apos;s music was performed with 12-tone edo is probably wrong. But we don&apos;t have enough solid research yet to be certain what systems players were using.&nbsp;<br/>Franklin Cox</p><p>Dr. Franklin Cox</p><p>1107 Xenia Ave.</p><p>Yellow Springs, OH 45387</p><p>(937) 767-1165</p><p>franklincox@...</p><p>--- On Wed, 1/13/10, monz &lt;joemonz@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: monz &lt;joemonz@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Beethoven tunings (was: The Contest)<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Wednesday, January 13, 2010, 8:00 PM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>      Hi Daniel,</p><p>--- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, Daniel Forro &lt;dan.for@... &gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; - That Beethoven&apos;s work of course WAS written for 12ET.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not aware at all about any mention, or note, or</p><p>&gt; consideration about tuning issues from the side of</p><p>&gt; this particular composer.

Even if two people say the same thing at the same time, timing will produce at least an obvious chorus effect due to slight timing error (IE even the exact same voice spoken over a recording of itself saying the same thing at the same pitches)...and that&apos;s certainly not a perfect &quot;super voice&quot;, far from it.  Also if anything more is different two voices will be very easily heard as separate.</p><p>&gt;&quot;That being said, when a triad is played, your ear again has no idea that cognitively speaking, we conceptualize of it as a triad.&quot;</p><p>     Psycho-acoustically much of the effect low-numbered fractions create is simply quick beating due to shorter periodicity.  The beating (per frequency) is often almost so quick you can&apos;t tell it&apos;s there.  IMVHO much the reason the mind &quot;likes&quot; periodic harmonics is that it has an easier time calculating when they will repeat: even when graphing a wave file you&apos;ll see a simple fraction like 7/6 is simpler to look at then, say 121/107.<br/>      I can swear that&apos;s where both concepts of roughness/beating and periodicity come together: they both give the brain an idea of a pattern it can summarize quickly and easily rather than keep &quot;recalculating&quot; where it may go.  If it repeats over a short period (IE periodicity), you know where it will go...if it beats less within the period, the curves within the period become easier to summarize and have less &quot;edges&quot; to trace to hear the &quot;picture&quot;.</p><p>   Anything that can be both easily summarized by the brain and contains a lot of information, I believe, gets its attention.</p><p>   And something like</p><p>   reward = amount-of-information-conveyed/trickiness-of-pattern-finding</p><p> I am guessing summarizes what makes certain music effective, at least mathematically.  Emotionally...that&apos;s a whole other ballgame: otherwise we would likely all gravitate toward very orchestral &amp; motif-based classical music (Debussy anyone?), the rhythmic equivalent (African poly-rhythmic music), or maybe even something with easy-to-track notes but lots of information conveyed via timbre (often trance music or distorted/overtone-intensive rock music). :-D</p></div><h3><a id=85707 href="#85707">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2010 11:10:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Without arguing any further (which I&apos;d love to but it&apos;s kinda pointless now<br/>:), I&apos;m going to agree to doing the competition blind.<br/>However.

It&apos;s a bit like if you said that 8192/6561 is a Pythagorean major third. But it&apos;s not, because you have to rise by 5 octaves and fall by 8 fifths to get there, so it&apos;s a diminished fourth. Instead, 81/64 is a major third, because you rise by 4 fifths and fall by 2 octaves to get there. And the 5-limit question is similar. If you do 5/4 squared and fall by one octave, you get a falling diminished fourth (25/32), which is the same as going from C4 to E4, then to G#4, and then G#3.

It&apos;s similar to the event which probably you know more about than I do -- when some people thought the standard notation was too complicated and they invented something called Klavierscribo.

Obviously, the inventors of Klavierscribo weren&apos;t stupid, but they probably didn&apos;t think about the broader meaning of harmony, or they thought that it was not as important for musicians as it actually was, otherwise they would probably have come up with a &quot;more-dimmensional&quot; system.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=85744 href="#85744">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2010 4:28:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Marcel wrote:</p><p>&gt; If I&apos;m following your thoughts correctly then it becomes clear that you allways see<br/>&gt; a major chord spelled as a major chord as 1/1 5/4 3/2, and a minor chord spelled as<br/>&gt; a minor chord as 1/1 6/5 3/2?</p><p>If the music is strictly based on 5-limit triads (like Renaissance or early Baroque music, for example), then, yes, you&rsquo;re right. Some differences may occur in cases of polyphonic music or music which doesn&rsquo;t care about chords.</p><p>&gt; Yet you&apos;ve also said that sometimes such a chord is not 1/1 5/4 3/2<br/>&gt; but 1/1 81/64 3/2? (which is more dissonant than any of my chords in my opinion)</p><p>In cases where you are primarily interested in the melodic steps of the individual voices and don&rsquo;t care about chords (like some middle-age polyphonic pieces), then Pythagorean tuning is appropriate because it perfectly preserves the important characteristics of the melodic steps -- i.e. a major second of C-Db being smaller than the &bdquo;chroma&ldquo; of C-C#, C# being higher than Db, and so on. And you also have really only two step sizes in a Pythagorean diatonic scale, a major second of 9/8 and a minor second of 256/243. But when you start thinking about chords and about the way the voices sound together (which is what happened towards the end of the 15th century), then the prime 5 comes in, thirds and sixths become as &bdquo;stable&ldquo; as fifths and fourths, and the difference in intonation of a &bdquo;chroma&ldquo; and a minor second turns the other way round (i.e. C-Db is larger than C-C# and C# is lower than Db, not higher). Although there&rsquo;s a remarcable difference in the sound of 64:81:96 (meaning 1/1-81/64-3/2) and 4:5:6 (meaning 1/1-5/4-3/2), there&rsquo;s no difference in how these two are notated because Renaissance music was mostly played in meantone (if not rarely in 5-limit JI) where 81/80 is tempered out. BUT (and there&rsquo;s the big but) the important thing to know here is that this is the one and only interval which is tempered out in meantone, which means that the diesis of 128/125 (the distance from 5/4 to 32/25) is not tempered out, nor is the Pythagorean comma, nor the 5-limit schisma (although the schisma is only about 2 cents in size). For this reason, a chord which is notated as A-C#-E should always come out as 4:5:6 in the case of strictly &bdquo;chordal&ldquo; 5-limit music, or 64:81:96 in the case of strictly &bdquo;melodic&ldquo; 3-limit music. Obviously, when you&rsquo;re doing something which is &bdquo;melodic&ldquo; and which is 5-limit, then some new possibilities may occur. One of them, for example, might be a situation where you would have to use a major third of 100/81 or some such. But none of them is to render A-C#-E as 1/1-32/25-3/2, because if 1/1 is A, then 32/25 is Db and not C#, which is perfectly preserved in our standard notation -- i.e. in meantone. 32/25 is away from 5/4 by a diesis of 128/125, which is not an integer multiple of the syntonic comma size, which means that you can&rsquo;t get this diesis by stacking syntonic commas one above another, which means that the diesis isn&rsquo;t tempered out in meantone, which means that a notated minor third can&rsquo;t come out as 32/25 in 5-limit JI -- because nothing else than the syntonic comma vanishes in meantone.</p><p>&gt; And a D F A chord in C, what is it? going to have a comma shift with certain progressions?<br/>&gt; or gets a different tuning with different chord progressions?</p><p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll be surprised, but both of these solutions are possible and both of them were even sometimes applied during the 16th century prior to finally settling on meantone. There were theorists and instrument builders who were designing keyboards with more than 12 keys or who were using two 12-tone keyboards at once to get a 24-tone set (Fogliano, Zarlino, Salinas, Vicentino, Mersenne and maybe others).</p><p>&gt; JI is not directly one on one related to enharmonic spelling.</p><p>It isn&rsquo;t in the 5-limit field, but it is in the 3-limit field. When you start with 3-limit JI which is 2-dimmensional, the intervals can be perfectly preserved. When you then add the prime 5, you get a 3-dimmensional syst&eacute;m. Of course, you can turn any 3-dimmensional syst&eacute;m into a 2-dimmensional one by choosing one interval which you&rsquo;re going to ignore in your new syst&eacute;m. This is the same as if you temper it out. So if standard notation doesn&rsquo;t distinguish two pitches which would originally (i.e. in 5-limit JI) differ by a syntonic comma, it&rsquo;s the same as if meantone doesn&rsquo;t distinguish two pitches originally differing by a syntonic comma. But now that you have made a 2D syst&eacute;m out of a 3D one by ignoring the syntonic comma, you have to keep in mind that only the size of the syntonic comma (and its integer multiples) vanishes in it, which means that you can render A-C# as either 81/64 or 5/4 or maybe rarely 100/81, but not 32/25.</p><p>&gt; And why do you insist everybody spells their notes correctly? (except janacek)</p><p>Until about the mid-1800s, the rules of classical-romantic harmony were so tight and precise that everyone who went against them would simply &bdquo;stick out&ldquo;. Obviously, there were a handful of composers who &bdquo;sticked out&ldquo; this way and there&rsquo;s still some debate on why they were doing so, AFAIK.</p><p>&gt; I belief JI is the highest form of note spelling.</p><p>Sure, because 5-limit JI is a 3D syst&eacute;m and both standard notation and meantone are 2D systems. But when converting a &bdquo;model&ldquo; piece of music (based primarily on some old chord relations coming from 5-limit JI) from 5-limit JI to notes or to meantone, one needs to remember what is lost after the conversion and what is preserved. You seem to only care about the data which is lost in the conversion without considering the data which stays preserved.</p><p>&gt; And one more thing. Why does it matter how Beethoven starts the drei equale?<br/>&gt; A starting chord can just as well be dissonant as any other chord.</p><p>Maybe it can but in a different way than you describe. There were obviously composers who used dense clusters even in the 17th century, but anyway, they stayed within certain boundaries. A diminished fourth could either be resolved to a minor third (like C#_F-C#_E or C#_F-D_F) or included in a dense cluster (like A-Bb-C#-D-E-F-G-A) but not in a triad which is not resolved to something else. Using 32/25 in a triad where nothing gets resolved is against the rules of common classical harmony.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=85745 href="#85745">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2010 5:35:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; a major second of C-Db being smaller than the &bdquo;chroma&ldquo; of C-C#</p><p>I meant &bdquo;minor second&ldquo;, of course.</p><p>&gt; which means that a notated minor third can&rsquo;t come out as 32/25 in 5-limit JI</p><p>I meant &bdquo;major third&ldquo;.</p><p>&gt; When you then add the prime 5, you get a 3-dimmensional syst&eacute;m.<br/>&gt; Of course, you can turn any 3-dimmensional syst&eacute;m into a 2-dimmensional one</p><p>Hell, this is what happens when I don&rsquo;t switch off the corrections in MSWord.

That&apos;s just the second phrase of the &gt; piece. You can&apos;t pick out the second phrase of a piece and claim &gt; the piece is in that key when all other evidence--the closing key, &gt; the opening key, the key signature, the other cadences, and so &gt; forth--undercuts that key.<br/>&gt; I did not say C major. That&apos;s a scale in my opinion.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not into major / minor.<br/>&gt; I said the tonic is C. The piece uses several modal scales from the &gt; tonic of C (aswell as C major sometimes).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The second phrase does in this instance create a strong sense of &gt; tonic.<br/>&gt; You can&apos;t get more clear than with I - V7 - I. Especially when &gt; before that there were only 2 chords of which one is very easy to &gt; see as ii.<br/>&gt; Furthermore the tonic of C is often reinforced throughout the piece.<br/>&gt; After the first 3 phrases, the 4 melodies all go down and end in C &gt; major chord. After which the diminished chord, and it resolves &gt; again to C major, after which diminished again, then more sadness &gt; like phrase 1 and 3, then phrase 1 again then again the I - V7 - I, &gt; etc<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And lets change one single note as a test.<br/>&gt; The C# to C.<br/>&gt; It still sounds right, only changes a great deal the emotion of the &gt; chord (not from happy to sad as would be the case with changing a &gt; dominant major to a minor, but because this is not a dominant chord &gt; but a very emotional 1/1 32/25 3/2 chord, it changes to a less &gt; emotionally charged chord)<br/>&gt; Now we have ii - vi - I - V7 - I chord progression in C.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for the starting and ending D chords. They have a very different &gt; character / feel to me than tonic chords.<br/>&gt; Sure, often in many sompositions the starting and ending chords are &gt; tonic chords. But not in this piece.<br/>&gt; They are so tragic / they wring. Now when the piece is in C they &gt; finally do so in tuning aswell.<br/>&gt; This piece is not about tonic chord consonance, it&apos;s about the &gt; dissonant chords that have a sad and painfull emotion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for the key signature, I&apos;ve allready explained previously this &gt; holds no value to me.

During the final revisions<br/>of this volume for publication, our attention was drawn to a recent discovery<br/>in Beethoven research that is significant in the context of Mark Lindley&acirc;Â€Â™s basic hypothesis.<br/>In his article, &acirc;Â€ÂœEin verlorener Registerklang. Beethovens Imitation der Aeolsharfe&acirc;Â€&#x9D;<br/>(Musik &amp; &Atilde;Â„sthetik #9 [2005], pp. 83-92), Hans-Werner K&Atilde;&frac14;then considers a<br/>Beethoven sketchleaf he discovered which contains excerpts from the Allgemeine<br/>musikalische Zeitung from February to September 1801. Among these excerpts, there is<br/>an entry by Beethoven which refers to an anouncement for, as well as a review of,<br/>a Tuning Book, or Even More Precisely: Instructions how Every Music Lover Can Repair and<br/>Thus Also Tune His Keyboard Instrument, Incidentally, Whether It Has Strings or Pipework.<br/>The book was written by Joseph B&Atilde;&frac14;ttner and Ernst Nachersberg and published in<br/>Breslau in 1801(!).<br/>This written entry attests first of all to Beethoven&acirc;Â€Â™s active interest in the question<br/>of piano tuning. Beyond this, B&Atilde;&frac14;ttner&acirc;Â€Â™s work offers concrete evidence that equal temperament<br/>tuning can by no means be taken for granted as a universal practice around 1800. Although the basic premise for proper tuning as stated in B&Atilde;&frac14;ttner&acirc;Â€Â™s book is that<br/>it should allow one &acirc;Â€Âœto play equally &acirc;Â€Â˜pure&acirc;Â€Â™ in all twelve hard and soft keys&acirc;Â€&#x9D;, B&Atilde;&frac14;ttner<br/>subsequently claims: &acirc;Â€ÂœThe only true tuning can be given to an instrument, if one<br/>bases it upon unequal temperament.&acirc;Â€&#x9D; To be sure, equal temperament was employed<br/>nonetheless. It was, however, somewhat modified to compromise for certain disadvantages<br/>in comparison with the older unequally tempered system: &acirc;Â€ÂœThe n ew style<br/>of tuning weakens all fifths equally, that is, each one only by a twelfth of a comma<br/>(&iuml;Âœ&pm;&iuml;Âœ&sup2;&iuml;Âœ&deg;th of a whole tone); of course all major thirds are tuned larger than pure and,<br/>necessarily, offend the ear. That is why the new system does not really meet with the<br/>approval of many [listeners]; they find it too harsh and less harmonious than the old<br/>[one].&acirc;Â€&#x9D; The reviewer for the AmZ promptly criticizes the tuning book for not advocating<br/>resolutely enough the one and only appropriate equal temperament tuning.<br/>Whether it was this particular alleged deficit of the piano tuning book that attracted<br/>Beethoven&acirc;Â€Â™s attention, or even provoked his opposition, must, of course, remain<br/>speculation. Such criticisms did not, however, diminish his interest in the subject.<br/>The significance of B&Atilde;&frac14;ttner&acirc;Â€Â™s writing with regard to the basic hypothesis of the<br/>present volume is obvious: there is little question that it implies the existence of ideas<br/>about a subtly unequal temperament at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Yet<br/>even the question as to whether this would support specific details of Mark Lindley&acirc;Â€Â™s<br/>&acirc;Â€Â˜style of tuning&acirc;Â€Â™, such as he sees in B&Atilde;&frac14;ttner&acirc;Â€Â™s instructions for the rate of beating for<br/>certain thirds, must be discussed at a later point....</p><p>[page 14]</p><p>...The selection of Beethoven&acirc;Â€Â™s Opus 34 as the chief example for such a<br/>demonstration was perhaps not stringent, but suggested itself for several reasons.<br/>The variations are suitable in range, catchiness and musical diversity for<br/>a comparative tuning project of this nature.

I think<br/>this is the mistake of the very limited concept of tonality in normal music<br/>theory.<br/>I think it&apos;s absolutely nonsense to see everything as major/minor.<br/>If i&apos;m correct there is no clear theory for modal scales and tonality and<br/>functional harmony.<br/>I see this as an obvious shortcomming in normal music theory.<br/>And something that JI makes very clear that such an expanded theory of<br/>tonality is clearly needed.</p><p>Therefore I think that my use of the word tonic and tonality are valid and<br/>make sense, but are perhaps confusing simply because they sometimes disagree<br/>with normal music theory.<br/>I&apos;ll use the words JI tonic, and JI tonality from now on.</p><p>In any case, I&apos;ve finished analysing the drei equale in full with what I&apos;ve<br/>learned about JI tonality.<br/>The result is this:<br/>bars 1 to 15 are in JI tonic E<br/>bars 15 to 27 are in JI tonic A<br/>bars 28 to 35 are in JI tonic E<br/>bars 35 to end are in JI tonic A</p><p>You can hear the result at <a href="http://www.develde.net">www.develde.net</a></p><p>You can very clearly hear the JI tonics and changes in JI tonics.<br/>It&apos;s now as if the piece is divided into 4 sections.<br/>I found it very interesting to hear this effect so clearly, highly<br/>recomended listen!<br/>I think it&apos;s my best version yet :)</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=85785 href="#85785">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2010 5:11:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Btw, I forgot to say that in this version not a single major triad was hurt<br/>:)</p><p>All major triads are 1/1 5/4 3/2 (and any inversions offcourse), and<br/>offcourse 1/1 32/25 3/2 though that one never occurs in this piece.<br/>Only the minor triads can be either 1/1 6/5 3/2 or 1/1 32/27 40/27 (and even<br/>a hint of 1/1 75/64 3/2 though it never forms a triad, it could have)</p><p>Now I don&apos;t have a single solid example in any piece or theoretical chord<br/>progression of when a 1/1 5/4 40/27 major traid occurs.<br/>Perhaps they don&apos;t exist..

So in A) the chord has the colors of the multiples 2,4 and 8.<br/>    And in the &quot;odd&quot; chord 5/4, 4/3, 5/3 (15:16:20...over 12)...for example, you get the colors of the multiples 3,4 and 12.</p><p>C) The quickest way to get quite varied color is to aim for least and second-to-least common multiples that are factors of different prime numbers.<br/>So in the second chord (15:16:20...over 12), you get additional tonal color because the LCM is 3 and the second to least is 4 (which &quot;factors down&quot; to a prime at 2).<br/>.....whereas the 10:12:15 chord has the LCM at 2 and the second at 4 and these BOTH &quot;factor down&quot; to the prime of 2.</p><p>     Hence...the 15:16:20 chord has more tonality...and, IMVHO, a major the reason diatonic JI, which its denominator of 3, has more color than the harmonic series (IE x/16, which &quot;factors down&quot; to the common multiple of 2).</p><p>    Furthermore, some denominators beside 3 that can be used to add color b/c they factor down to primes are<br/>5 (prime)<br/>7 (prime)<br/>6 and 9 (factors down to 3)<br/>12 (factors down to 3 or 2)<br/>15 (factors down to 3 or 5)<br/>18 (factors down to 3 or 2)...my personal favorite as it contains many factors with primes of 2 and 3 IE 2,3,6,9 and is still lower than the &quot;JI standard&quot; common multiple of 24.<br/>24 (factors down to 3 or 2)</p><p>    One easy application is to change JI diatonic to x/12 form IE<br/>1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1 becomes</p><p>1/1 13/12 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 11/6 2/1<br/>.........in order to allow more chords with both x/3 and x/2 factors.</p><p>********************************************************************************<br/>Now here&apos;s where IMVHO it gets really interesting...</p><p>     Once you make a scale involving many of, say, the above factors to add color, you can mess around with things that aren&apos;t as strict.<br/>Like tempering to your own discretion by up to around 7 cents to help eliminate roughness IE the root tones being too close and causing beating (though experimentation I&apos;ve found anything closer than about 12/11 begins to sound quite rough) or even, for example, throwing in denominators that make LCM&apos;s for certain chords higher than 24 to add color (IE using 6/5 instead of 5/4 in diatonic JI would make the LCM 40 IE x/8*x/5).</p><p>     Then you can experiment with things like maximizing the amount of tonal color, eliminating roughness, and keeping a low LCM (24 or less between all notes the entire scale) to enhance periodicity.

It is a little more expensive, but conforms to international import/export laws. Studying the card later I was able to determine what kind of snakeskin it uses- it is a more primitive relative of the boa, and is farmed. The wood is not mentioned, but wood being my long family tradition (I can still cut piston-fit dovetails by hand), I&apos;m pretty sure it is acacia, either from Australia or China, and plantation wood.</p><p>Nantong is wonderful, great food and sub-tropical climate. Sang at the old pagoda- &quot;Microtonal&quot; would be an understatement, my Theremin player went off on a tangent mid-song on one tune, but somehow a harmonically related tangent, and we made it miraculously back, hahaha! I heard lots of really microtonal music in China, there seems to be a great gap between commercial cheese and the musics of the<br/>actual many different peoples.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The two strings of the erhu are traditionally tuned a<br/>&gt; &gt; pure fifth apart, so that a droning sympathetic fifth is<br/>&gt; &gt; part of the sound- so, 12/11 is better than 10/9 on the<br/>&gt; &gt; instrument.
