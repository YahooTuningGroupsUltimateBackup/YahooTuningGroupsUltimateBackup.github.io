So every value of x should<br/>&gt; theoretically give a complete Scale Tree that is unique that to that x<br/>&gt; (and, if generalized, to that period).</p><p>As you&apos;ll see from my last post, I just noticed that too!<br/>We&apos;ve got the pattern now as well.</p><p>&gt; So what you have is the whole JI universe of ratios, uniquely<br/>&gt; articulated to ET scale degrees in giant, unbounded grids--each<br/>&gt; relative to the degree of bend and the complexity of x (the simpler<br/>&gt; the value of x, the simpler the fractions of the period).</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s amazing!</p><p>I wonder if you&apos;ve had the thought I&apos;ve just had:</p><p>scale repeat 2:</p><p>x    = 20/10  21/10   22/10 ...<br/>3/2 at 20/30  21/32   22/34 ...</p><p>Trying scale repeat 3:</p><p>x    = 20/10  21/10   22/10  23/10  24/10 ...<br/>3/2 at 20/50  21/54   22/58  23/62  24/66 ...</p><p>It&apos;s the same pattern, but you increment by 4<br/>each time instead of 2.</p><p>Try scale repeat 4:</p><p>x    = 20/10  21/10   22/10   23/10  ...<br/>3/2 at 20/70  21/76   22/82   23/90  ...</p><p>increment by 6 each time.</p><p>Try scale repeat 5:</p><p>x    = 20/10  21/10   22/10   ...<br/>3/2 at 20/90  21/98   22/106  ...</p><p>Extrapolating all those series back to 10:</p><p>x    = 10/10  11/10   12/10 ...<br/>3/2 at 10/10  11/12   12/14 ... for scale repeat 2<br/>3/2 at 10/10  11/14   12/18 ... for scale repeat 3<br/>3/2 at 10/10  11/16   12/22 ... for scale repeat 4<br/>etc.</p><p>Formula:</p><p>If scale repeat is r, and x = (a+n)/n<br/>then the 3/2 occurs at (a+n)/(a+2(r-1)n)</p><p>I expect that will also work for r non integer.</p><p>Let&apos;s try r = 5/3, a = 6, n = 11, just for fun</p><p>x = 17/6, 3/2 should occur at  17/(6+2(2/3)11)<br/>= 51/62</p><p>- no that doesn&apos;t work, the actual value is 13/4.</p><p>Can you see the pattern for r non integer I wonder?</p><p>The script wouldn&apos;t let you go back to those values<br/>because it was handy to be able to enter 1 to<br/>get the best value of r for the<br/>undertone series (conversely the overtone),<br/>but now I&apos;ve added a button to do that, and<br/>let it go down to just above 1.</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.co.uk/uo_non_oct.htm">http://tunesmithy.co.uk/uo_non_oct.htm</a></p><p>I know you originally thought it better to start<br/>at the undertone series as the minimum value,<br/>and that works well, but perhaps now this makes<br/>sense so that we can explore beyond the edge<br/>at the left side of the tree.</p><p>While you are off-line maybe I&apos;ll write this up<br/>as a couple of web pages or something, as on<br/>some of the other maths / micro sites.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
