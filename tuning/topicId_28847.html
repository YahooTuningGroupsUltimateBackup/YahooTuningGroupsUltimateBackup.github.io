Bankruptcy is at the door;<br/>angry mullahs are at the gate. The corruption of the<br/>powerful is epic, the poverty of the masses crushing. The<br/>army has taken charge, again putting democracy on the<br/>shelf. More people own guns than refrigerators.</p><p>This country, then, may seem a strange choice as America&apos;s<br/>indispensable ally in the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Islamic<br/>guerrillas - many would call them terrorists - openly<br/>operate inside Pakistan&apos;s borders, with government support.</p><p>But for the Bush administration, Pakistan it is - a<br/>rediscovered crony from America&apos;s cold war days, forced<br/>back into friendship at gunpoint to fight terrorism. In his<br/>Sept. 19 speech to the nation, Gen. Pervez Musharraf,<br/>Pakistan&apos;s military ruler for the last two years, explained<br/>that he was facing an American ultimatum - join us or fight<br/>us - and that he felt that the country&apos;s very survival was<br/>at risk.</p><p>In many ways, it is. The country is polarized. On one side<br/>stand sympathizers with the West who have felt increasingly<br/>marginalized in recent years and believe that the current<br/>turmoil may be a rare stroke of fortune that halts the<br/>&quot;Talibanization&quot; of Pakistan, a drift toward the<br/>fundamentalist Islam of neighboring Afghanistan. On the<br/>other stand the holy warriors, the hope of the country&apos;s<br/>myriad dispossessed.</p><p>Pakistan, with a population between 140 million and 150<br/>million, is the world&apos;s seventh most populous country. Like<br/>many nations in the third world, it seems to be<br/>simultaneously moving ahead and falling behind at frantic<br/>speeds. It is this dichotomy that explains some of the<br/>violence of the country&apos;s conflicts.</p><p>Today, someone claiming to be from one of the best-known of<br/>Pakistan&apos;s radical Islamic guerrilla groups,<br/>Jaish-e-Muhammad, took responsibility for a suicide bombing<br/>at the state legislature in Srinagar, in<br/>Indian-administered Kashmir. The attack killed at least 26<br/>people.</p><p>One of this region&apos;s many open secrets is that the<br/>Pakistani government itself has armed Islamic militants,<br/>sending them off to fight the Indian authorities in Kashmir<br/>in an attempt to wrest the contested Himalayan territory,<br/>which is primarily Muslim, from Hindu control.</p><p>A Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman, in a statement<br/>today, condemned the Srinagar attack. &quot;Pakistan condemns<br/>terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,&quot; he said.</p><p>But whatever the government&apos;s past relationship to<br/>Jaish-e-Muhammad, it seems clear that the United States, in<br/>its new determination to combat terrorism, has sided with a<br/>military government that has not been averse to backing<br/>insurgency in Kashmir.</p><p>Radical Muslim political parties, historically weak at the<br/>polls, are traditionally potent in the streets, where the<br/>number of poor and the number of refugees grow.<br/>Kalashnikovs are everywhere, as are men who know how to use<br/>them. Twin jihads - one in Afghanistan, one in Kashmir -<br/>save many from the idle hours of joblessness and fill them<br/>with lethal, self-righteous purpose.</p><p>But the radical Islamists drawn to holy war, however<br/>grateful for their supply of guns and grenades, very often<br/>despise the national leaders who provide them. The more<br/>those Pakistani leaders look like American cronies working<br/>to oust the Taliban government in Afghanistan, the more the<br/>hate may grow.</p><p>By drafting this fragile and fractious nation into a<br/>central role in the &quot;war on terrorism,&quot; America runs the<br/>danger of setting off a cataclysm in a place where civil<br/>violence is a likely bet and nuclear weapons exist.</p><p>Pakistan has long been the speculated locale for one of the<br/>world&apos;s worst nightmare scenario, in which Islamic<br/>terrorists, in league with rogue elements of the military,<br/>seize control of the government and wield the vengeful<br/>sword of jihad with a nuclear tip.</p><p>Islam is a growing force here. Hundreds of religious<br/>schools, known as madrassahs, have eagerly sent their<br/>students to fight at the Taliban&apos;s side. Pakistani border<br/>guards wish them well as they head to the front lines.</p><p>Last Friday, in a drama repeated in hundreds of towns and<br/>cities across the country, mullahs at the Red Mosque in<br/>Islamabad followed the gentle chanting of afternoon prayers<br/>with frenzied threats of violence: Death to America! Let<br/>Americans come here to be buried!</p><p>A plea went out for 50,000 volunteers to defend Afghanistan<br/>against &quot;the infidels.&quot; The entreaty was made with the<br/>desperate ardor of merchants at a going-out-of-business<br/>sale. Many of Pakistan&apos;s fundamentalist clerics endorse the<br/>Taliban&apos;s formula for a pure Islamic state. Without the<br/>Taliban, these mullahs would be without their rallying<br/>point.</p><p>An 18-year-old spectator, Tai Muhammad, said he had pledged<br/>his life to the anti-American jihad, enlisting at the<br/>mosque&apos;s sign-up table. &quot;People like me will be the<br/>Americans&apos; reception committee,&quot; he said, grinning in<br/>satisfaction.</p><p>Lambasted along with President Bush was General Musharraf,<br/>called a traitor to his country, his religion and 1,400<br/>years of Islamic history.</p><p>Afghanistan, Mr. bin Laden&apos;s sanctuary, is not merely<br/>Pakistan&apos;s neighbor. Pakistani intelligence agents have<br/>been the Taliban&apos;s godfathers, turning a throng of self-<br/>righteous religious students into a militia of self-assured<br/>soldiers.</p><p>Until recently, the Taliban have been useful to Pakistan,<br/>providing an ally on its western flank as rival India lurks<br/>to the east, and a breeding ground for Islamic militancy<br/>that could be redirected toward Kashmir.</p><p>So to many at the Red Mosque, Pakistan&apos;s cooperation with<br/>America seems like a sellout.</p><p>American money, of course, is not an insignificant<br/>inducement, especially to a nation $37 billion in debt with<br/>virtually no prospects of climbing out of the hole.</p><p>So far, a windfall has yet to appear, though America -<br/>suddenly forgiving of the testing of nuclear weapons and<br/>the eschewing of democracy - has removed many economic<br/>sanctions against Pakistan. Together with the Japanese, the<br/>United States has rescheduled nearly $1 billion in debt and<br/>authorized $90 million in aid.</p><p>Indeed, renewed solvency is the hope of many Pakistanis who<br/>believe that a decisive battle has at last been joined.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s a wonderful thing,&quot; said a retired general, speaking<br/>on condition of anonymity. &quot;We were in a state of drift.<br/>The silent majority was being dragged in a terrible<br/>direction by a very vocal minority. This is God-sent. We&apos;re<br/>saved.&quot;</p><p>That optimistic view is shared by much of a Westernized<br/>elite that would see the Taliban&apos;s overthrow as the logical<br/>halt to the onrushing fundamentalism in their own midst.</p><p>Many have long assumed that an upheaval was inevitable,<br/>with moderate Islam battling the religion&apos;s extremist,<br/>intolerant version.</p><p>That confrontation is better fought now than later, they<br/>say. &quot;If there is a silver lining in this, it&apos;s that the<br/>radicals, the jihadists, will be de- fanged now instead of<br/>10 years later when they&apos;d be stronger,&quot; said Pervez<br/>Hoodbhoy, a physicist and peace activist.</p><p>But radicalism has deep social roots here. In the cities,<br/>the turn of a street corner can seem to be time travel<br/>between centuries. Wide boulevards clogged with expensive<br/>cars become narrow lanes where shrouded women carry jugs of<br/>water on their heads.</p><p>About 75 percent of all Pakistanis reside in rural areas.<br/>Most are sharecroppers, eking out a subsistence. In some<br/>areas, feudal families still hold sway, making private laws<br/>and operating private jails.</p><p>While the wealthy send their children to college in America<br/>or Britain, many of the poor are deprived of even an<br/>elementary education. The literacy rate is below 40<br/>percent. A fifth of Pakistan&apos;s government schools are<br/>&quot;ghosts,&quot; with buildings but no students or teachers,<br/>General Musharraf himself admitted. This void increasingly<br/>has been filled by thousands of madrassahs. Considered a<br/>godsend by the destitute, they feed and house their pupils<br/>while teaching them the wisdom of the Koran and the moral<br/>requirement to fight in holy wars.</p><p>Islam is the great refuge of Pakistan&apos;s masses. In mosques,<br/>in the fields, on the roadsides, men drop to their knees<br/>and perform their daily prayers. However empty their<br/>pockets, they are equal in these genuflections before God.</p><p>But it is not a simple picture. Fundamentalist Muslims,<br/>like secular ones, are minorities. Between them are a<br/>multitude of gradations in the practices of faith - one<br/>reason why recent polls suggest layers of ambivalence about<br/>the current crisis,</p><p>Before General Musharraf&apos;s address to the nation on Friday,<br/>the pollster asked people whom they would support in a war<br/>between America and Afghanistan. Seven percent said America<br/>and 67 percent Afghanistan, with about 26 percent neutral.<br/>Four days after the speech, those who said they would side<br/>with the United States remained the same, though 20 percent<br/>shifted from Afghanistan to neutrality.</p><p>Some of this sentiment reflects a general doubt that<br/>America has enough proof against Mr. bin Laden to warrant a<br/>punishing attack on Afghanistan. At the same time, many<br/>Pakistanis are merely wary of America, regarded as a<br/>companion of shallow sincerity.</p><p>&quot;Unfortunately, America seems to be Pakistan&apos;s friend only<br/>when it suits America&apos;s needs,&quot; said Zahid Mahmood, a bank<br/>manager. &quot;When the need is over, America deserts you.&quot;</p><p>In the 1980&apos;s, America had great needs in the region. In<br/>late 1979, the Soviet Union sent its troops into<br/>Afghanistan, getting itself closer to a warm-water port.<br/>Using Pakistan as a pipeline, the United States and other<br/>nations then financed the Afghan resistance. The Soviets<br/>soon found themselves bogged down in a crippling war<br/>against guerrillas adept at mountain combat. The cold war&apos;s<br/>end swiftly followed the Soviets&apos; humbling retreat in 1989.</p><p>America&apos;s attention span, as well its affection, did not<br/>last much longer. That was a shock to Pakistan.</p><p>Money had seemed a token of friendship, and in 1990 the<br/>United States aid package to Pakistan was $564 million;<br/>only Israel and Egypt received more. But then the largesse<br/>was suddenly withdrawn, the penalty for Pakistan&apos;s<br/>continuing program to develop nuclear weapons in pace with<br/>its archenemy India.</p><p>&quot;Looking out for No. 1, that&apos;s the American way, isn&apos;t it?&quot;<br/>snickered Ajab Gul, a barber in Peshawar. &quot;That is what<br/>Americans are proud of. We&apos;re different.&quot;</p><p>But the loyalties of Pakistanis are no simple matter,<br/>either.</p><p>In 1947, after a flurry of cartography, Pakistan and India<br/>were mapped out of the British Empire. Pakistan was devised<br/>with religious cohesion as a Muslim state. But it, rather<br/>than India, has been the one struggling for a national<br/>identity.</p><p>The country is split among several ethnicities and<br/>languages. Mr. Gul, the barber, is Pashtun and admits to<br/>feeling a greater affinity for the Pashtuns of Afghanistan<br/>than the Sindis of Karachi or the Punjabis of Lahore in his<br/>native land.</p><p>Democracy has never taken a firm foothold. The military has<br/>remained the dominant institution, and while it has failed<br/>in its three wars with India, it has had repeated success<br/>in overthrowing its own democratically elected governments.</p><p>During the 1990&apos;s, however, it was civilian governments<br/>that generally maintained control. The indefatigably<br/>corrupt governments of Prime Ministers Benazir Bhutto and<br/>Nawaz Sharif - as well the stopped-up American spigot -<br/>helped plunge the economy into the red while at the same<br/>time discrediting democracy in the eyes of the people.</p><p>Both Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Sharif now live in exile. Their<br/>political parties, the Pakistan Peoples Party and the<br/>Pakistan Muslim League, are in disarray. For now, public<br/>assembly is forbidden.</p><p>By order of the Supreme Court, a return to civilian<br/>government is supposed to occur by next October. General<br/>Musharraf, who recently assumed the title of president, has<br/>promised to abide by the timetable.</p><p>But his future, like his country&apos;s, is now linked to<br/>matters that could not have been foreseen a month ago: the<br/>number of American soldiers who will touch Pakistani soil,<br/>the amount of blood spilled in reflexive outrage, the havoc<br/>caused by the coming onrush of refugees and the furtive<br/>ability of a Saudi-born multimillionaire named Osama bin<br/>Laden.</p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/02/international/asia/02ALLY.html?ex=1003105506&ei=1&en=5168d77fada7a710">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/02/international/asia/02ALLY.html?ex=1003105506&ei=1&en=5168d77fada7a710</a></p><p>HOW TO ADVERTISE<br/>---------------------------------<br/>For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters<br/>or other creative advertising opportunities with The<br/>New York Times on the Web, please contact Alyson<br/>Racer at <a href="mailto:alyson@nytimes.com">alyson@nytimes.com</a> or visit our online media<br/>kit at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo">http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo</a></p><p>For general information about <a href="http://NYTimes.com">NYTimes.com</a>, write to<br/><a href="mailto:help@nytimes.com">help@nytimes.com</a>.</p><p>Copyright 2001 The New York Times Company</p></div>
