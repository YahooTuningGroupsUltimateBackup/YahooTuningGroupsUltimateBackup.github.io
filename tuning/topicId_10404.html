On the otherhand the notion and possibility of<br/>music acting upon the individual in a &quot;healing &quot; fashion is not new and one would expect to<br/>continue to function in this way in our society. The release of stress may not be the best<br/>way, in my own case I find that happy music makes me depressed and sad minor upon minor has an<br/>uncanny effect of lifting my spirits. I am not sure if the latter is just a release of the<br/>stress of sadness that its expression alleviates or not!</p><p>&quot;D.Stearns&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Margo Schulter,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thus while I might describe a tuning such as 1/4-comma meantone as<br/>&gt; not in any usual sense &quot;painful&quot; for Renaissance music, I would<br/>&gt; nevertheless recognize that the tempering of the fifths, for example,<br/>&gt; involves a degree of &quot;stress&quot; -- some stress possibly being a usual<br/>&gt; norm in music as in life.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; John A. deLaubenfels,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s the $64,000 question.  For me, music is a place where the<br/>&gt; greatest possible release from &quot;stress&quot; is paramount.  There, it is a<br/>&gt; joy for intervals (including 7:4) to be close to true in the midst of<br/>&gt; frenetic 19th century (etc.) music.  But I would not discount the<br/>&gt; opposite experience, especially given how different our ears are (I<br/>&gt; use the word &quot;ears&quot;, of course, to refer to the ear/brain combination,<br/>&gt; and, as for the brain, its subdivisions are endless...).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While I don&apos;t think this answer&apos;s going to get me the sixty-four<br/>&gt; grand, I&apos;ll roll it out there anyway for whatever it&apos;s worth... From<br/>&gt; an ideological or artistic standpoint, I for one am totally opposed to<br/>&gt; the _idea (the retuned music I&apos;d hope to take a listen at a time; each<br/>&gt; on its own merits as I understand or see them, etc.) of an across the<br/>&gt; board aesthetic that would retune all intervals in all music to a<br/>&gt; given optimal... 110% TOTALLY OPPOSED. However, that&apos;s just my view,<br/>&gt; and I wouldn&apos;t expect everyone to agree with it!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dan</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=10418 href="#10418">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;mtpepper@prodigy.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2000 7:20:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;d just like to comment that not enough distinction is being made between<br/>dissonance, which can be used, desired, and even focused on, and plain<br/>out-of-tune-ness, which I would only ever use for beats, as in the beginning<br/>of <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/midi/beatgen.mid">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/midi/beatgen.mid</a><br/>I&apos;ve experimented with various dissonant intervals (especially the 7/5<br/>tritone) in just and tempered, and the dissonance, or pull to the<br/>resolution, is incariably sharpened. The fact that they are in tune adds the<br/>extra capacity to linger tantalizingly of them before finally resolving,<br/>without the pain.</p><p>On a related thought, I think the limit of a piece should be split into two<br/>categories, tuning limit and consonance limit. Tuning limit is the regular,<br/>familiar concept of the highest prime number appearing in a ratio, but<br/>consonance limit is the highest odd multiple that can appear in a final<br/>chord, all the more complex intervals needing to be resolved. Thus in<br/>7-limit 5-consonant music, 7-limit ratios and chords would appear, but they<br/>would always resolve to 5-limit consonances.</p><p>Stay Tuned,<br/>    Keenan P., JI Fanatic</p><p>P.S.
