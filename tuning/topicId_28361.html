Please consider<br/>the following, taken from &quot;sangitaratnakara&quot; [1.4.4-5] :</p><p>The verses 4 and 5 relate to the gaandhaara graama. The gaandhaara<br/>graama is prevalent only in Heaven, not on the face of the Earth.<br/>This gaandhaara graama is treated as having been derived from the<br/>shhaDja graama. The formation of gaandhaara graama requires changes<br/>in the locations of gaandhaara, dhaivata, and nishhaada. The<br/>gaandhaara-related change affects R^ishhabha and madhyama; the<br/>dhaivata-related change affects pa~nchama; and, finally, the<br/>nishhaada-related change affects dhaivata and shhaDja.</p><p>The changes are effected as follows:- gaandhaara takes one shruti<br/>each from R^ishhabha and madhyama; dhaivata takes one shruti from<br/>pa~nchama; and, nishhaada takes one shruti each from dhaivata and<br/>shhaDja.</p><p>I thank you in advance and in anticipation.  Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=28380 href="#28380">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2001 2:22:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Haresh,</p><p>It is my understanding (based on much research) that there are many<br/>various and conflicting specifications for the Ga-Grama in the<br/>literature. Many researchers have expended pages upon pages promoting<br/>their own personal interpretations of this &quot;lost scale&quot;. At this<br/>point one is free to choose among these, or invent one&apos;s own, without<br/>much hope of acheiving universal agreement on what the &quot;scale of<br/>Heaven&quot; really is.</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
