From a closed-minded Westerner, we may expect statements like, &quot;it&apos;s too false to listen !<br/>And the way is false ! Nobody  and never will like microtonal compositions :) The true music dont have one future in this direction... The rest is &quot;bla bla &quot; in french...&quot; This kind of patronizing, high-and-mighty, our-way-is-the-right-way thinking, is exactly what got the world into the mess that it is in today!</p></div><h3>Seth Austen &#x3C;klezmusic@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2001 7:11:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 9/18/01 4:49 AM, <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> at <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a></p><p>&gt; From <a href="http://www.jewishsf.com/bk990716/ebazaatar.shtml">http://www.jewishsf.com/bk990716/ebazaatar.shtml</a></p><p>&gt; &quot;This music is a way to build bridges with Arab communities.

This subject is near and dear to me, as I<br/>perform Jewish/klezmer music in one of my performing lives. Ever since<br/>Tuesday I&apos;ve felt an acute awareness of hightened possibilities of<br/>encountering negative responses when playing Jewish music due to escalating<br/>anti-Arab/Jewish prejudice and fear. The scale that is most used in Askenazi<br/>Jewish music, freygish or Ahava Raba, is in fact the same scale as Hijaz,<br/>used extensivelly in Arabic music. We personally haven&apos;t encountered any<br/>problems as of yet (that I know of) playing klezmer music in our gigs this<br/>past weekend, however, I have a dear friend in CT who has encountered some<br/>audience members expressing their feelings that this music wasn&apos;t<br/>appropriate at this time. This type of thing will not keep me from<br/>expressing myself in the music of my culture and spiritual life, however, I<br/>do think we are entering difficult times ahead as musicians expressing our<br/>melodic creativity in the beautiful middle-eastern modes of our heritage.</p><p>I for one, would like to see more Jewish/Arabic music fusion as a step<br/>toward healing the chasm that divides us.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a><br/><a href="mailto:klezmusic@earthlink.net">klezmusic@earthlink.net</a></p></div>
