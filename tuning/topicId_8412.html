I would say that most people referring to the traditional<br/>term &quot;functional harmony&quot; also do not.  There is a web of complexity that<br/>the following chart does not, I believe, properly convey:</p><p>&gt; VII        Dominant or Subdominant<br/>&gt;VI          Tonic or Subdominant<br/>&gt;V            Dominant<br/>&gt;IV           Subdominant<br/>&gt;III          Tonic or Dominant<br/>&gt;II            Subdominant (sometimes Dominant, I think)<br/>&gt;I             Tonic</p><p>&gt;So typically, in an analysis, every chord is marked either<br/>&gt;&apos;T&apos;, &apos;S&apos;, or &apos;D&apos;.</p><p> Rather than taking my word for it, let&apos;s make a few citations from Allen<br/>Forte&apos;s _Tonal Harmony in Concept and Practice_.</p><p>&quot;II (Supertonic) in the Major Mode -- the term supertonic indicates the<br/>position of this triad _above_ the tonic.  Functionally, however, the<br/>supertonic triad has little relationship to the tonic triad.  By virtue of<br/>the 5th relationship II always functions as a dominant preparation.&quot;</p><p>This is, of course, your &quot;standard&quot; V of V relationship which is so crucial<br/>to functional harmony.  Perhaps if we were to consider functional harmony<br/>as a string of fifths (obviously originally derived from the Pythagorean<br/>practice)  we would be getting someplace in our understanding.  This is<br/>different, however, from a &quot;reduction&quot; to the three primary triads.</p><p>More Forte:</p><p>&quot;III (Mediant) in the Major Mode&quot; [don&apos;t forget that &quot;key&quot; term, literally]<br/> &quot;It is important to notice that III does NOT serve as a dominant<br/>preparation.  On the contrary, it occurs as a SUFFIX to V.  [Joey P&apos;s caps]<br/>it also occurs as a suffix to I.  THUS III IS QUITE DISTANT FROM BOTH<br/>ELEMENTS OF THE HARMONIC AXIS, AND IS RELATED TO THEM ONLY THROUGH VI.&quot;<br/>[NB,NB,NB!!]  &quot;The function of III in minor differs significantly from that<br/>of III in major.  Whereas in major the mediant is relatively unimportant,<br/>in minor it is a quasi-primary triad.&quot;  [This is, of course, your &quot;garden<br/>variety&quot; relative major]</p><p>We&apos;ve been over IV and V a bit too heavily, I believe, so let&apos;s go on to<br/>&quot;juicy&quot; VI (Submediant)</p><p>Again from Forte.  (Don&apos;t trust ME for a minute...):</p><p>&quot;We have seen that VI  SERVES AS A DOMINANT PREPARATION BOTH IN MAJOR AND<br/>IN MINOR. [NB, NB!]  Often it follows I immediately, providing the first<br/>cue to progression toward V.&quot;</p><p>And, of course, our traditional gems of I-vi-ii-V-I, etc. the nourishment<br/>of beginning harmony students everywhere, come from this Submediant.)<br/>Note, again, however that this &quot;functional harmony&quot; is linked by our<br/>Pythagorean (now &quot;squeezed&quot; into 12-tEt) fifth relationships.</p><p>From Forte:</p><p>&quot;VII (Leading-Note Triad) in Major.  The VII is a dissonant triad both in<br/>major and in minor.  Like II in minor, it occurs rarely in fundamental<br/>position.  When represented by its first inversion, it often stands between<br/>I and I-6&quot; (I 6/3 of course).</p><p>Naturally, the VII chord is a substitute for an incomplete dominant seventh<br/>chord.</p><p>So, let&apos;s not forget that there is LOTS of &quot;baggage&quot; associated with<br/>traditional functional harmony.  All the traditional progressions, etc.  It<br/>is NOT reducible to three triads, but possibly could be considered<br/>reducible to a whole string of dominant fifths.  This is where the example<br/>given by, I believe, Carl Lumma of barbershop is interesting.  They are,<br/>obviously, moving their dominant sevenths around like some kind of parallel<br/>set theory, and are not, as Paul Erlich queried, interested in &quot;functional&quot;<br/>modulation of seventh chord to seventh to seventh around the circle,<br/>established by our 3-limit ancestors.</p><p>Here&apos;s Forte&apos;s functional harmony chart, again from _Tonal Harmony in<br/>Concept and Practice_:<br/>I quote:</p><p>II -- Supertonic -- Dominant preparation<br/>III (in major)-- Mediant -- Leads to dominant preparations IV, II-6 or VI<br/>III (in minor) -- Mediant -- Independent triad that often usurps role of<br/>tonic<br/>IV Subdominant -- Dominant preparation or melodic embellishment of tonic<br/>VI (in major) Submediant -- Dominant preparation or tonic substitute<br/>VI (in minor) Submediant -- Dominant preparation<br/>VII (in major and harmonic minor) -- leading tone triad -- Dominant<br/>substitute or melodic embellishment of tonic<br/>VII (in natural minor) -- Natural VII - Secondary dominant in relation to<br/>the mediant triad.</p><p>Unquote...</p><p>There have been various attempts to &quot;simplify&quot; traditional &quot;functional<br/>harmony&quot; over the years.  Classifying everything as I, IV or V would, to my<br/>mind, not be a good way (!!)  Others have been superior -- Heinrich<br/>Schenker comes to mind...</p><p>Schenker was a weird bird.  His book _Harmony_ is right here, and some<br/>incredible statements &quot;jump out&quot; right away:  &quot;Against all traditional and<br/>historical notions, I would go so far as to claim that even Greek music<br/>never was real art.  It can only be ascribed to its very primitive stage of<br/>development that Greek music has disappeared without leaving any traces...&quot;</p><p>And, even _worse_ for us here:  &quot;NO OVERTONE BEYOND THE FIFTH IN THE SERIES<br/>HAS ANY APPLICATION TO OUR TONAL SYSTEM&quot;  &quot;The human ear can follow Nature<br/>as manifested to us in the overtone series only up to the major third as<br/>the ultimate limit; in other words, up to that overtone which results from<br/>the fifth division.&quot;</p><p>Schenker didn&apos;t even recognize the 7th partial.  (No jazzer he). However,<br/>there was SOME validity in his simplifications.  Anyone who has done a<br/>&quot;Schenkerian analysis&quot; can attest to this.  Basically, everything is<br/>reducible to &quot;pitch level.&quot;  Yes, the primary I, IV and V (major and minor)<br/>were emphasized (remember, one uses BIGGER notes for the BIGGIE functional<br/>chords and SMALLER notes for the functional chords and lines of lesser<br/>magnitude -- like stars in the sky!), but it is always with POSITIONING or<br/>pitch height in mind.</p><p>That kind of &quot;positioning simplification&quot; is a more logical dig.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2000 8:50:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Joe Pehrson, TD 525.20]<br/>&gt; Regarding Joe Monzo&apos;s comments concerning &quot;functional harmony&quot;<br/>&gt; in  TD. 523:6, there is a bit more complexity, I believe to the<br/>&gt; &quot;matrix&quot; of functions than were described,</p><p>Joe, thanks for elaborating on what I wrote, and for quoting<br/>Forte. As I stated (not quite this precisely) at the beginning<br/>of my post, I have Forte&apos;s _The Structure of Atonal Music_, but<br/>not his book on Tonal Harmony.  So the quotes are much<br/>appreciated.</p><p>However, keep in mind that I am more familiar with, and was<br/>communicating in my post my knowledge of, the *origin* of<br/>the concept and term &apos;functional harmony&apos;, with Riemann.<br/>Forte&apos;s descriptions are a much later elaboration - or perhaps<br/>one should call it a summary of the later elaborations of<br/>others - of Riemann&apos;s theories.</p><p>I see nothing in any of the information you provided<br/>that contradicts Riemann&apos;s fundamental hypothesis that all<br/>*functions* of chords in tonal music (meaning &apos;common-practice&apos;<br/>Western-European art and popular music) are ultimately reducible<br/>to a paradigm which places the tonic in the center as a<br/>balancing point and the subdominant and dominant on either<br/>side of it in opposing forces, with all other chord-roots<br/>being categorized into one of the three &apos;positions&apos;.</p><p>This is at its most basic level a recognition of the primacy<br/>of the Pythagorean tuning scheme, or, as I said, 3^(-1,0,1).<br/>So when you say:</p><p>&gt; [Joseph Pehrson]<br/>&gt; Perhaps if we were to consider functional harmony as a string<br/>&gt; of fifths (obviously originally derived from the Pythagorean<br/>&gt; practice)  we would be getting someplace in our understanding.<br/>&gt; This is different, however, from a &quot;reduction&quot; to the three<br/>&gt; primary triads.</p><p>I don&apos;t see the difference at all.</p><p>Certainly Riemann and Forte both mean to include other<br/>elements in their pitch-sets, including those with 5 as<br/>a factor, and including an extension of the Pythagorean<br/>axis in either direction (i.e., strings of &apos;dominant-7th&apos;<br/>relationships).</p><p>(In fact, Riemann was thinking in terms of 5-limit JI, while<br/>my guess is that Forte&apos;s assumed tuning scheme is 12-EDO/tET.)</p><p>But the fundamental dynamic in a &apos;string of fifths&apos; progression<br/>is the one portrayed in the V-I-IV paradigm.</p><p>Note that Riemann did not consider the I, IV and V simply as<br/>&apos;primary triads&apos;, as you called it, but as opposing forces<br/>exhibiting a symmetrical &apos;pull&apos; on the tonic.</p><p>I get the feeling that even reading Forte, your mind is more<br/>locked into the Roman-numeral analysis than it should be.<br/>Roman-numerals are a product of German/Austrian _stufen_-theorie.<br/>I don&apos;t know enough about the history of this to offer further<br/>comment, so I defer to Daniel Wolf or other experts.  But<br/>in order to understand Riemann, you need to think in terms<br/>of the 3^(-1,0,1) paradigm.</p><p>The whole point of having the new qualifier &apos;functional&apos;<br/>added to &apos;harmony&apos; is to explain the secondary chord-roots<br/>as &apos;substitutes&apos; for the three primary functions.</p><p>Some quotes you gave from Forte which support my explanation<br/>of Riemann:</p><p>&gt; [Forte, quoted by Joe Pehrson]<br/>&gt; Functionally, however, the supertonic triad has little<br/>&gt; relationship to the tonic triad.  By virtue of the 5th<br/>&gt; relationship II always functions as a dominant preparation.</p><p>&gt; [monz referring to Riemann]<br/>&gt; II            Subdominant (sometimes Dominant, I think)</p><p>Note that the one category that&apos;s missing from my description<br/>is that of &apos;tonic&apos;.  In complete agreement with Forte.</p><p>&gt; [Forte, quoted and edited by Joe Pehrson]<br/>&gt; It is important to notice that III does NOT serve as a<br/>&gt; dominant preparation.  On the contrary, it occurs as a SUFFIX<br/>&gt; to V.  [Joey P&apos;s caps] it also occurs as a suffix to I.</p><p>&gt; [monz referring to Riemann]<br/>&gt;III          Tonic or Dominant</p><p>Note that V (dominant) and I (tonic) are precisely the<br/>functions I specified.</p><p>And as I made clear in my original post, there&apos;s a whole lot<br/>more to what Riemann had to say on this than what&apos;s in my<br/>little abstract of it.  He may himself have made many of<br/>the points made by both Forte and yourself.</p><p>For those interested, there&apos;s been quite a resurgence of<br/>interest in extending Riemann&apos;s theories within the last<br/>year or two.  A recent _Journal of Music Theory_ was entirely<br/>devoted to it; the articles include lots of 12-tET adaptations<br/>of &apos;our&apos; lattice diagrams.</p><p>And also be aware that the 3^(-1,0,1) paradigm was of<br/>fundamental importance in Schoenberg&apos;s theories.  In one<br/>place in _Harmonielehre_ he even provides an amusing little<br/>allegory about the &apos;war&apos; between the &apos;forces&apos; in a simple<br/>chord-progression.</p><p>&gt; [Joseph Pehrson]<br/>&gt; There have been various attempts to &quot;simplify&quot; traditional<br/>&gt; &quot;functional harmony&quot; over the years.  Classifying everything<br/>&gt; as I, IV or V would, to my mind, not be a good way (!!)</p><p>Then you simply don&apos;t agree with Riemann; or perhaps, you<br/>don&apos;t understand that &apos;functional harmony&apos; is not synonymous<br/>with &apos;traditional harmony&apos;.  &apos;Functional harmony&apos; refers<br/>specifically to the simplification of everything to I, IV, or V.</p><p>&gt; [Joseph Pehrson}<br/>&gt; Others have been superior -- Heinrich Schenker comes to mind...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Schenker was a weird bird. ...&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>You can say that again!  I don&apos;t find Schenker&apos;s methods<br/>superior in any way to those of Riemann.  There are certainly<br/>very different.  While I go along with recognizing the merits<br/>of Schenker&apos;s idea of prolongation, I&apos;ve been on record long<br/>ago as disagreeing with the specifics of just about everything<br/>else he said.</p><p>I suppose everyone whose primary interest in music is tuning<br/>would agree that pitch is the most interesting (if not<br/>necessarily the most important) aspect of music.</p><p>But one of the favorite games of contemporary music-theory<br/>writing is to note how wrong it was in past theory to assume<br/>that pitch-height held the preeminent position in a consideration<br/>of musical analysis, and to right that wrong with new in-depth<br/>explorations of timbre, rhythm, meter, amplitude (i.e.,<br/>&apos;dynamics&apos;), and spatial location.</p><p>And of course, anyone with a serious interest in tuning will<br/>laugh at many of Schenker&apos;s more dogmatic statements.  I&apos;m<br/>afraid I just can&apos;t accept a lot of the Schenker-derived<br/>modern analyses of music entirely at face value.  I think<br/>lattice diagrams explain a whole lot more, and are a lot<br/>more &apos;truthful&apos;.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
