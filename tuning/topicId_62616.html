Some<br/>familiar ones are the augmented (LsLsLs) and diminished (sLsLsLsL)<br/>scales in 12-equal (or better temperaments), but other scales not<br/>possible in 12-equal (and supporting chord cycles that would drift in<br/>12-equal) come out of this investigation too, such as the 7- and 8-<br/>note Porcupine scales for example. Didn&apos;t I mail you a copy of part<br/>1, Mark? Did you ever receive it?
