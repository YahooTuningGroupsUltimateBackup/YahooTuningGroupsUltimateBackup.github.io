D Eb F# G Ab B C D most certainly sounds to me like a diatonic scale. As a matter of fact, all maqams can be reduced to instances of one or more diatonic scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Safiyuddin Urmewi of Baghdad also considered such intervals as Eb-F# whole tones, no matter how augmented. It would not be wrong to assume that augmented whole tones function similarly as whole tones in a tetrachord. Thus, I cannot possibly accept the claim that the above-mentioned scale in not diatonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Cordially,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=57691 href="#57691">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/2005 3:02:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi all,</p><p>I think Klaus has hit on a most important consideration -<br/>what is your _purpose_ in using the term &quot;diatonic&quot;?</p><p>If your music is essentially harmonic, it&apos;s bound to mean<br/>something different from what it does if you music is<br/>essentially melodic.

I&apos;m also aware how Western tonality has<br/>superceded ancient Greek theory so as to render modal configurations<br/>obsolete in many ways. In this context, it would not be out of place to<br/>re-define what we understand of diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic genera. I<br/>think Daniel summed it up neatly, saying:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I also understand the steps C to D-flat as diatonic, C to C-sharp as<br/>chromatic, and C-sharp to D-flat as enharmonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You should know that Western ears do not have monopoly over what is<br/>diatonical and what is not. Al-Qindi, Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina and Safiyuddin<br/>Urmewi all precede Western theorists in promulgating Hellenic tetrachord<br/>calculations. The Maqams of then and today most certainly sound diatonical<br/>to me, in that, each instance is made up of 7 steps whose intervals function<br/>as half-tones and whole-tones in a given tetrachord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Well, actually I wanted to insist that Western tonality has not<br/>superceded Ancient Greek theory, it just concerns a different music.</p><p>In Greece, diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic concerned independent<br/>tunings with steps around 200 and 100, 300 and 100, and 400 and 50<br/>cents. In Western harmony, the terms concern harmonic relations, and the<br/>enharmonic relation is the difference between the diatonic and chromatic<br/>halfsteps in a given tuning. In a modal context, I think that Greek<br/>theory gives you a better handle in classifying tetrachords of<br/>heptatonic scales. Western music (apart from the harmonic relations<br/>emntioned above) essentially differentiates between music in scales,<br/>which are diatonic except for the harmonic minor, which is explained as<br/>having a &quot;borrowed tone&quot;, and music which uses all the tones of 12-ET.<br/>Middle Eastern music has steps of around 150 cents that neither the West<br/>nor the Greeks know about, so there are probably Arabic terms going<br/>around that fit better than the Greek ones.</p><p>Your scale with the adjacent half steps is not diatonic in the Western<br/>of the Greek sense. Since it can be analyzed as two tetrachords with two<br/>half steps and large second, it is a perfect chromatic scale for the<br/>Greeks, but not to Western theory. Not being diatonic makes it a bad<br/>scale for anybody who needs consonant chords and movement by fifths,; it<br/>does not make it an inherently bad scale. So why call it diatonic?</p><p>klaus<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.7.4 - Release Date: 18/3/05</p></div>
