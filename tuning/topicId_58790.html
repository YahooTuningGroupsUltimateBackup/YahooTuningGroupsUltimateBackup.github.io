For example, take the<br/>blues scale (0,3,5,6,7,10) Some interested facts: If C=0, then what you<br/>have is a pentatonic scale on Eb with added minor third (Gb over Eb).<br/>So we are working with C minor pentatonic or Eb pentatonic. Also,<br/>(0,3,5 and 7,10,12) are the top halves of dominant seventh chords F7<br/>and C7. So this relates to the 7-limit. Also, if you take the Z-related<br/>complement of (0,3,5,6,7,10) you get (1,2,4,8,9,11) which is E7 and A<br/>major triad superimposed. When one considers all the music based on the<br/>blues scale and variants (blues, jazz, rock etc) I think this angle<br/>might be worth pursuing. One gets (36, 42, 48, 49, 54, 63, 72) as one<br/>possible just intonation version of the blues scale. You get a C minor<br/>triad of (6,7,9) and an Eb minor triad of (6,7,9 - the simplest form for<br/>a minor triad.

This expanded the scale to<br/>1-7/6-49/40-4/3-49/36-10/7-3/2-49/30-7/4-40/21, which can be used as<br/>is or tempered by 441 or 612 so that the 2401/2400 relationships<br/>between some of the notes go away. This now has a 1-7/6-7/5 chord and<br/>(via 2401/2400) a 1-6/5-7/5 chord, they fit together in a<br/>1-7/6-7/5-49/30 chord, which is an interesting chord I don&apos;t have a<br/>name for: it has intervals 7/6-6/5-7/6-60/49, so two 7/6 subminor<br/>thirds, a minor third, and a neutral third making up the octave. If we<br/>consider the neutral third to be an 11/9, we now want to temper out<br/>540/539, which we could do in miracle, or in 130 or 171, or in the<br/>130&amp;171 temperament I called &quot;sesquiquartififths&quot; at one point, a<br/>horrible name someone may want to suggest an alternative for.
