I could have played the same scale in 22-EDO, but any accuracy gained in 6/5 would be lost in 7/6.  Since 7/6 is more complex, I figured it would benefit from greater accuracy.</p><p>Basically, I looked at a bunch of different scales, and 18-EDO gave me a nice 8-note scale that is strictly proper and allows 4 instances each of both triads.  It seemed ideal for my purposes.  Once a few more guesses come in, I&apos;ll lay out the scale and you can tell me if I could have picked a better one.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=92783 href="#92783">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/2010 3:06:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>M M m m M M m m</p><p>Great example (including the choice of 18-ET)!</p><p>-Carl</p><p>Igs wrote:</p><p>&gt; Okay, folks, I came up with a scale in 18-EDO that gives four<br/>&gt; 5:6:7 chords and four 30:35:42 chords.
