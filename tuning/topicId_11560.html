The first of these puts the 7th degree at<br/>&gt; 9/10 of the root above, the second puts it at 7/8.  What about the<br/>&gt; intermediate tuning, 8/9?  To my ear this last is discordant but<br/>&gt; tolerable, where the 9/10 is VERY high.  Is 9/10 more &quot;historical&quot;?</p><p>In 1/4-comma meantone, one characteristic temperament of the era<br/>around 1600 when tritonic seventh combinations came into vogue (the<br/>later dominant sevenths of Rameau&apos;s key system), the tuning would<br/>actually be about midway between 20:25:30:36 and the alternative to<br/>which you very rightly call attention: 36:45:54:64. Specifically, the<br/>meantone minor seventh is precisely the mean of 16:9 (as in this last<br/>tuning) and 9:5.</p><p>When I cited the version with 9:5, I may have had in mind Vincenzo<br/>Galilei&apos;s statement remarking that the minor seventh is a dissonance<br/>with a ratio of 9:5. Galilei (father of the astronomer Galileo),<br/>endorsing the bold tritonic seventh combination and its cadential use<br/>during the 1580&apos;s, may have been the first theorist to describe an<br/>idiom which came into vogue in the composers of the next decade or so<br/>(e.g. Monteverdi, Gesualdo).</p><p>However, the minor seventh in 5-limit JI can be either 9:5 or 16:9.<br/>The first value would occur when this seventh is built from a pure<br/>fifth plus a minor third, for example in this progression from<br/>Monteverdi:</p><p>C4  B3   C#3<br/>A3  G#3  A3<br/>D3  E3   A2</p><p>Here, if the fifth D3-A3 of the first sonority is a pure 3:2, and the<br/>minor third A3-C4 a pure 6:5, then D3-C3 will be 9:5.</p><p>For an orthodox 16th-century example, let&apos;s consider a 7-6 suspension<br/>with a 9:5 minor seventh:</p><p>    D4  C#4  D4<br/>    G3       F#3<br/>... E3       D3</p><p>If E3-G3 is a pure 6:5, and G3-D4 a pure 3:2, then E3-D4 is 9:5.<br/>Incidentally, this example illustrates the kind of tritone resolution<br/>(here augmented fourth to minor sixth between the two upper voices)<br/>routine in the 16th century and described by theorists including<br/>Vicentino (1555) and Zarlino (1558). This resolution combines with a<br/>typical M6-8 between the outer voices. The innovation near the end of<br/>the century was boldly combining the tritone resolution with the kind<br/>of cadential motion of the bass down a fifth or up a fourth which<br/>you&apos;ll see in the next example of 16:9.</p><p>The 16:9 minor seventh would typically occur in suspensions, where<br/>this interval arises from two pure 4:3 fourths:</p><p>    F4  E4  F4<br/>    C4      C4<br/>    G3      A3<br/>... C3      F3</p><p>In this typical 4-3 suspension formula, the suspended sonority<br/>C3-G3-C4-F4 includes the pure 4:3 fourths G3-C4 and C4-F4; therefore<br/>G3-F4, equal to two such fourths, is 16:9.</p><p>Incidentally, the highest minor third of the 36:45:54:64 sonority is a<br/>Pythagorean 32:27; this interval plus the pure 3:2 fifth (54:36) form<br/>the 16:9 minor seventh.</p><p>Historically, in the era around 1600 or 1720 for that matter, I would<br/>suggest that either 9-based tuning of the minor seventh in this<br/>sonority seems a more likely approximation than a 7-based tuning;<br/>meantone basically splits the difference, exactly what singers or<br/>players of non-fixed-pitch instruments might do without<br/>fixed-pitch-instruments in the ensemble remains an open question.</p><p>While conventional theorists such as Zarlino took 5-limit JI as the<br/>model for voices, Vincenzo Galilei argued that singers actually tend<br/>toward a regular temperament not too far from 2/7-comma meantone,<br/>Zarlino&apos;s favorite keyboard tuning, but with the fifths somewhat<br/>closer to those on the common lute tuning of 12-tone equal temperament<br/>(12-tet).</p><p>There is possibly some humor here, by the way, because Galilei, at<br/>one time a student of Zarlino, often engaged in heated controversies<br/>with his former instructor. Specifically, he argues that unaccompanied<br/>singers tend toward a regular rather than pure tuning -- proposing<br/>Zarlino&apos;s own keyboard temperament as one fairly close approximation.</p><p>(Your adaptive tuning, of course, could be seen as a synthesis of the<br/>two views.)</p><p>Some odd final comments for now. Maybe one could argue that if we<br/>follow a JI rather than meantone approach, then 9:5 might be an ideal<br/>tuning for a minor seventh conventionally treated as a suspension, but<br/>that singers might shade this somewhat toward 16:9 with the new and<br/>bolder seventh combinations.</p><p>At any rate, composers such as Monteverdi evidently meant it to be a bold<br/>and audacious sonority, a figure of musical &quot;rhetoric&quot; as it were; one<br/>theorist defending Monteverdi&apos;s technique says that the seventh in<br/>place of the octave is a kind of poetic liberty, like a simile or<br/>metaphor.</p><p>By the 18th century, keyboard temperaments other than 1/4-comma<br/>meantone tend to shift the minor seventh mostly toward 16:9, I&apos;d<br/>guess. By this era the tritonic seventh combination -- now the<br/>dominant seventh -- has shifted from a &quot;special effect&quot; to a routine<br/>feature of the key system. Maybe the tuning in 1/6-comma meantone,<br/>~1003.26 cents (16:9 is ~996.09 cents, and 9:5 is ~1017.60 cents),<br/>gives some idea of this trend; in well-temperaments, of course, the<br/>size of this interval would vary depending on the transposition.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
