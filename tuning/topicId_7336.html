Like Yasser, he makes an extremely elegant<br/> presentation for his case, which ultimately boils down to number patterns<br/> that, though the author makes them _seem_ musically relevant, it&apos;s more an<br/> act of intellectual sleight-of-hand. &gt;&gt;</p><p>I really beg to differ on this one.  Balzano really trained himself to hear<br/>12tet and 20tet by systematically learning all of the simple divisions (i.e.<br/>12 by 2,3,4,6; 20 by 2,4,5,10) and then the cyclic patterns (i.e. by<br/>relatively prime divisions like 5 or 7 in 12).  This is basically the same<br/>mode of hearing as that demanded by Princeton-style 12-tone music,  so your<br/>evaluation of whether it is &quot;musically relevant&quot; or not may be essentially an<br/>aesthetic one.  I find that with a small bit of practice, one can learn to<br/>recognize basic tri- and hexachords, as well as complete aggregates, _by ear_<br/>in 12tet pieces by Hauer, Webern, Schoenberg, Babbitt.  I can&apos;t imagine why<br/>it would be otherwise in 20, which shares the same number of divisors as 12.</p><p>I readily agree that these modes of listening are harder than others<br/>associated with tonal practice, but that doesn&apos;t negate them.</p></div>
