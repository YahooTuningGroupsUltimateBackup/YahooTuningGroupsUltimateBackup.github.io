The discovery was announced at the<br/>American Astronomical Society meeting in San Diego.<br/>The planet sleuths from the University of California at Berkeley, NASA and<br/>other institutions discovered the planetary pair locked in what appears to<br/>be &quot;resonant&quot; orbits, moving in synch around the star with orbital periods<br/>of 60 and 30 days. Because of the 2-to-1 ratio, the inner planet goes around<br/>the star twice for each orbit of the outer one. They gravitationally tug on<br/>each other to maintain this synchronicity.</p><p>&quot;The resonance between the two orbiting planets is among the most exciting<br/>planet detection discoveries to date,&quot; said Dr. Jack Lissauer, a NASA Ames<br/>Research Center scientist based in the heart of California&apos;s Silicon Valley.<br/>A &quot;resonance&quot; is similar to the harmonic vibration produced by plucking two<br/>notes on a stringed instrument. This gravitational pas de deux between the<br/>two planets is common among moons and asteroids, but not planets. The axes<br/>of the two newly detected planets&apos; elliptical orbits also appear to be<br/>nearly perfectly aligned.</p><p>Lissauer and State University of New York at Stony Brook graduate student<br/>Eugenio Rivera used a numerical model to demonstrate the stability of the<br/>nearly twin orbits around the star known as Gliese 876, a dim red dwarf 15<br/>light years from Earth in the constellation Aquarius. &quot;Questions about<br/>planetary migration and gravitational influence are still very much<br/>unsolved,&quot; Lissauer said.</p><p>&quot;This discovery is significant for several reasons,&quot; said Lissauer. &quot;This is<br/>the first extra-solar planetary system to show a strong resonance. It also<br/>is the smallest star known to have any orbiting planets, much less two,&quot; he<br/>said.</p><p>The two gravitationally linked planets have masses of at least 0.5 and 1.8<br/>times the mass of Jupiter, he said. The inner planetary companion was not<br/>recognized at first because the orbital resonance allowed the pair of<br/>planets to masquerade as a single planet with an elongated orbit.</p><p>The two orbiting planets are located relatively close to each other, within<br/>0.08 Astronomical Units (the distance between the Earth and the sun) of each<br/>other, less than one-third the distance from the Earth to its nearest<br/>neighbor, Venus. In our solar system, the only known resonances between a<br/>pair of planets is Pluto, which orbits the sun twice for every three times<br/>Neptune circles the sun.</p><p>Besides Lissauer, the planet-hunting team that discovered the system<br/>includes Drs. Geoff Marcy and Debra Fischer of the University of California<br/>at Berkeley; Dr. Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington; and<br/>Dr. Steve Vogt of the University of California at Santa Cruz.</p><p>Though significant and unusual, the discovery will require more modeling<br/>before researchers can determine what the resonance they discovered actually<br/>means.</p><p>The team based both sets of its conclusions on 6 years of precise Doppler<br/>measurements and observations made at the Keck I telescope atop Mauna Kea in<br/>Hawaii and the Lick Observatory telescope in California. The research is<br/>part of a multi-year project to look for planets among 1,100 stars within<br/>300 light years of Earth. The project is supported by NASA, the National<br/>Science Foundation and Sun Microsystems.</p><p>More information about these discoveries is available at<br/><a href="http://www.exoplanets.org">http://www.exoplanets.org</a>.</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2001 2:50:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Monz,</p><p>&gt; There are two MIDI versions of the piece, found here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/monz/solarsystem/">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/monz/solarsystem/</a></p><p>Really interesting chord to listen to!</p><p>&gt; It is.

But Pluto&apos;s orbit is far more erratic than those of<br/>&gt;&gt; the other planets, and so the amount of &quot;tempering&quot; is harder<br/>&gt;&gt; to pin down.</p><p>Robert wrote,</p><p>&gt;Does the orbital period fluctuate greatly over time then?</p><p>No -- it&apos;s mode-locked into a 3:2 ratio. What Monz meant was that the orbit<br/>is very elliptical, and so its speed varies quite a bit.</p><p>&gt;Also, that Pluto&apos;s orbit is also not so well known as the others<br/>&gt;as it hasn&apos;t completed a full cycle yet, and also, no spacecraft<br/>&gt;has visited it.</p><p>This is irrelevant because precise astronomical measurements allow us to<br/>very accurately forecast (and retrodict) Pluto&apos;s motion for thousands of<br/>years.</p><p>&gt;Suggests the golden ratio doesn&apos;t it, as Mary<br/>&gt;mentioned in her post.</p><p>Yes, the golden ratio and other noble numbers are very important in orbital<br/>dynamics because they are the ratios that minimize the potentially<br/>destabilizing effects of resonances.</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2001 12:46:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Monz,</p><p>I&apos;ve added a musical orrery to the &quot;to do&quot; list for FTS 1.10 -<br/>see the download page &quot;for the future&quot; section.</p><p><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/fts_beta/fts_beta_download.htm">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/fts_beta/fts_beta_download.htm</a></p><p>Drawing ellipses is easy.
