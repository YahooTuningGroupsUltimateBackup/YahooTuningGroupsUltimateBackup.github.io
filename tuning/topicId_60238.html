I also feel that brats come into play in music, maybe even to the detriment of Just Intonation. That is probably why meantone temperaments with proportional beats are so much appealing to me.</p><p>My proposal for ascertaining the concordance of a chord was this:</p><p>----------------------</p><p>Assuming that z&gt;x...</p><p>if &grave;z&grave; ( i.e. 1.5) becomes &grave;z+n&grave;</p><p>then &grave;x&grave; (i.e. 1.25) becomes x+(x/z times n)</p><p>For example, if one modifies the pure fifth so that the new value is 732 cents, then to preserve the consonance of the chord, one needs to modify the third by this amount:</p><p>386.31+(30.04 * 386.31/701.96)= 386+16.5= 402.84 cents</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>According to Paul Erlich, the explanation is that the error of the minor third should be distributed between the major third and the fifth in an optimal manner. Yet, he may have a different proposal in mind.</p><p>My approach produces near-proportional beating:</p><p>If one modifies the pure third so that the new value is 392 cents (+5.686 cents), then to preserve the consonance of the chord, one needs to modify the fifth by this amount:</p><p>701.955+(5.686 times 701.955 / 386.314)= 701.955+10.332= 712.288 cents</p><p>However, a 392 cents major third from the base frequence of 260 Hz has the beat rate:</p><p>2^ (392/1200) * 260 = 326.07 Hz</p><p>(326.07 * 4) - (260 * 5) = 1304.28-1300 bps</p><p>which makes 4.28 bps or</p><p>1 over 4.28 = one beat every 0.233645 seconds.</p><p>In order to achieve the same beat rate for the fifth in a major triad, I have to temper 3/2 so that the result is:</p><p>(f*2) - (260 * 3) = 4.28 bps</p><p>thence,</p><p>2f - 780 = 4.28</p><p>2f = 780 + 4.28</p><p>f= 784.28 / 2</p><p>f= 392.14 Hz</p><p>The relative frequency of the fifth from the base is:</p><p>392.14 / 260 Hz = 1.5082307692307692307692307692308</p><p>The size in cents is:</p><p>1200 / (log 2) * log 1.5082307692307692307692307692308 = 3986.3137 * 0.1784678 = ~711.429 cents</p><p>The equal beating tempered triad has the frequencies:</p><p>260 Hz<br/>312.68 Hz<br/>392.14 Hz</p><p>and the cent values are:</p><p>0<br/>392<br/>711.429</p><p>In contrast, my solution resulted in 712.288 cents.The difference is less than a cent: 0.859</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  From: Charles Lucy<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 07 Eyl&uuml;l 2005 &Ccedil;ar&scedil;amba 16:46<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Beats analysis of meantones etc. - links please.</p><p>  I am very pleased to see that an interest in the analysis of beat<br/>  frequencies is developing on this list.</p><p>  To my mind this could develop into a very useful way to examine<br/>  tunings, on the assumption that the &quot;allusive harmonics&quot; do actually<br/>  beat.</p><p>  I would be very grateful if someone could post all the relevant links<br/>  to the various methods of calculation which are being proposed,<br/>  so that I can explore any new (to me) ideas.</p><p>  Until recently, members of the various tuning lists have seemed less<br/>  than enthusiastic to even entertain the idea that the beat rates between<br/>  frequencies are significant, unless they are at integer frequency<br/>  ratios.</p><p>  I have experimented with many different mathematical models of this<br/>  phenomena over the years,<br/>  and have often felt as though I was shouted down by the JI mob,<br/>  whenever I insisted that harmonics &quot;should&quot; beat.</p><p>  Let&apos;s really explore what is happening with beating from every<br/>  direction,<br/>  for I am convinced that this is the most potentially productive<br/>  direction for future microtuning research.</p><p>  Charles Lucy - <a href="mailto:lucy@harmonics.com">lucy@harmonics.com</a><br/>  ------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>  for information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>  for LucyTuned Lullabies go to <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>  Buy/download/CD from: <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2</a></p></div><h3><a id=60249 href="#60249">ðŸ”—</a>George D.
