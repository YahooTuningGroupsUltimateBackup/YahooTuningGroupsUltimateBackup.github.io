Some may want to avoid any list using their services.</p><p>If these statements are correct (and I have no information that would<br/>suggest that they aren&apos;t), I would think that anyone who does not want<br/>people to get their E-mail addresses from the MLA-L server with the<br/>&quot;review&quot; command would want to think *several* times before either<br/>subscribing to or recommending that anyone else subscribe to *any* list at<br/><a href="http://onelist.com">onelist.com</a>.</p><p>There are other lists for orchestra administrators, at locations where<br/>advertisements are NOT added to messages, and subscribers&apos; names are NOT<br/>collected for passing on to advertisers. I regret that I can&apos;t supply the<br/>addresses of such lists, as the notebook in which I kept such information<br/>seems to have disappeared. Perhaps someone else will have that<br/>information.</p><p>Hope Ehn                     &lt;<a href="mailto:ehn@world.std.com">ehn@world.std.com</a>&gt;</p><p>******************************************************************************<br/>Dennis and Hope Ehn are 2 different people sharing one account.<br/>Hope is the author of &quot;On-Line Resources for Classical &amp; Academic Musicians.&quot;<br/>Dennis does programming (mostly C++).<br/>PLEASE don&apos;t get us confused!                                 :-)<br/>******************************************************************************</p></div><h3><a id=545 href="#545">ðŸ”—</a>alves@xxxxx.xx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>1/28/1999 4:08:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: Paul Hahn &lt;<a href="mailto:Paul-Hahn@library.wustl.edu">Paul-Hahn@library.wustl.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In light of this information, forwarded from another list, might I<br/>&gt;suggest that whoever it was (Bill Alves?) who was looking into setting<br/>&gt;up the list server on a machine he had access to continue those efforts?<br/>&gt;Ideally our current home would be a temporary one.<br/>&gt;<br/>If there is a consensus of the need to move the list, I would be happy to<br/>set up a list here at my institution. It is fairly easy for me to do. I<br/>don&apos;t know what to believe about <a href="http://onelist.com">onelist.com</a>. Here&apos;s what they say on their<br/>faq:</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>How do you make money?</p><p>We are advertiser supported. We make money by selling ads on our web-site.<br/>We also sell advertising on the emails that we send out.</p><p>What do you do with the registration information you collect?</p><p>ONElist uses the information to build composite demographic profiles of the<br/>mailing lists. This is used by advertisers to help target ads to lists that<br/>are most appropriate for them. ONElist strongly believes in privacy and<br/>will never disclose an individual&apos;s registration information to anyone<br/>without their express consent.</p><p>What is ONElist&apos;s policy on SPAM?</p><p>ONElist has taken several measures to discourage spam, or unsolicited<br/>commercial email. Part of the registration process involves responding to<br/>an email message that ONElist sends out. This is to  ensure that every list<br/>subscriber is using a valid email address and can therefore be held<br/>accountable if they spam. Only subscribers to a list may send email to the<br/>list. All archived messages on the ONElist web site have had the sending<br/>email addresses removed. This is to eliminate address harvesting.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>This seems to suggest that they only make money by selling web-site ads and<br/>sending out emails, not by selling email addresses. So far I haven&apos;t gotten<br/>any email advertisements -- has anyone else? Again, I would be happy to<br/>move the list here, but I won&apos;t do anything until there is a clear<br/>consensus from the subscribers.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
