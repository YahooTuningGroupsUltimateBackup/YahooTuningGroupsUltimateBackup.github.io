Triangular is better than rectangular.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For octave-equivalent lattices, I totally agree, and perhaps Joe Monzo<br/>&gt; is coming around on this too. But for octave-specific lattices, an<br/>(n*d)<br/>&gt; measure of complexity would be handled by a rectangular lattice with<br/>&gt; prime axes (or, equivalently as far as the city-block metric is<br/>&gt; concerned, a Monzo-type lattice with an additional axis for octaves)<br/>and<br/>&gt; lengths proportional to the log of the axes. This is equivalent to<br/>&gt; Tenney&apos;s harmonic distance if he included a 2-axis (anyone know if he<br/>&gt; did or didn&apos;t)? I now see where Graham Breed was coming from in<br/>&gt; supporting rectangular lattices for octave-specific lattices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The reason omitting the 2-axis forces one to make the lattice<br/>triangular<br/>&gt; is that typically many more powers of two will be needed to bring a<br/>&gt; product of prime factors into close position than to bring a ratio of<br/>&gt; prime factors into close position. So the latter should be represented<br/>&gt; by a shorter distance than the former. Simply ignoring distances along<br/>&gt; the 2-axis and sticking with a rectangular (or Monzo) lattice is<br/>&gt; throwing away information.</p><p>I admit there are still modifications I&apos;d like to make<br/>to my lattices, but I&apos;m not sure know how yet.</p><p>I really think the &quot;crumpled napkin&quot; idea is the best way<br/>of making a harmonic lattice, with low--high-prime bridges<br/>forming the wrinkles.  But this is a geometry which<br/>is far beyond my ability to draw</p><p>- but I&apos;m working on it.     ;-)</p><p>-monz<br/> |\=/|.-&quot;&quot;&quot;-.
