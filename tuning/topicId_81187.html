I agree with Carl mathematically there are all but a few cents difference between Lucy Tuning and the mean-tone scale used.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; But, for some reason...that little mathematical difference seems to allow the brain to tie things together more easily...almost like comparing a circle to a slightly jagged circle.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, maybe Lucy Tuning does not have the academic &quot;proof&quot; in some people&apos;s minds to truly be considered something new and I&apos;ll admit it sounds a lot like a purer version of 12TET with virtually the same chords and emotions...it&apos;s doesn&apos;t really create any new music theories so much as it purifies existing ones.&nbsp; Then again, to some extent, the same &quot;emotional originality limit&quot; can be said of 5-limit JI.<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it seems obvious to me...that some special irrational ratios like PI truly do have special meaning, even when stuck into &quot;old&quot; scale creation formulas like mean-tone.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; One question I do have (and I might try myself)...is what happens when you create a tuning from PI directly IE result tone 243 * (PI ^ X / 2^Y) where PI = 1 to about 16 and Y is whatever number is needed to make (PI ^ X / 2^Y) equal to somewhere between 0 and PI (where PI is the octave).&nbsp; How much different would a scale under that tuning that sound from Lucy Tuning (likely quite a bit)...and would it sound better or worse?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Or...do any of you know about any experiments involving scales based on PI where PI is&nbsp; used as the equivalent of the octave?</p><p>-Michael</p><p>--- On Fri, 2/13/09, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@...&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Carl up North for the weekend - God save ---- Carl&apos;s tuning mp3 &amp;

And then, isn&apos;t this the actual concept of regular temperaments where one interval is called the &quot;period&quot; and the other is called the &quot;generator&quot;? For example, in quarter-comma meantone, the period is a pure octave and the generator is ~696.5 cents (i.e. its factor is the fourth root of 5). This means that the syntonic comma (i.e. the difference between 4 fifths minus 2 octaves and a pure major third) is made to turn into unison and that the distance of 4 fifths minus 2 octaves is tuned to 5/4. This is one of many, many possibilities how to get 2-dimmensional temperaments.

For example, for the time being, what I &gt; find very pleasant to my ears is a meantone temperament where the octave &gt; is 1/9 of the syntonic comma wider than a pure octave and the fifth is &gt; 2/9 of the syntonic comma narrower than a pure fifth. And I think (I &gt; say, I THINK) I know why it sounds so great. The major and minor thirds &gt; are only 1/9th of the syntonic comma away from pure; and major and minor &gt; tenths are actually pure here.</p><p>The first thing I noticed when trying out a tuning with slightly sharp octaves (1/7 of a comma in my case) was how that slight detuning made the octaves sound better to my ears than the pure electronic octave -- the individual notes can be perceived more distinctly. With an electronic instrument, and both notes coming from the same speaker, that makes a difference (especially when the rest of the scale is tempered). So it&apos;s possible that part of the reason why that tuning sounds so good is the slight detuning of the octave.</p></div><h3><a id=81260 href="#81260">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2009 2:47:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #ddd'><b>Attachments</b></div><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Michael wrote:</p><p>      &gt;     243HZ...I think that&apos;s around the starting frequency of the note &quot;C&quot;.</p><p>      243Hz is a bit lower than B3, C4 is about 261.6Hz, as long as we are using 12-equal and we want A4 to be 440Hz.</p><p>      &gt; I believe so.  Meaning, the period is the octave and the generator is what&apos;s used to create the<br/>      &gt; &quot;circle of 5ths&quot; used to make the scale?  If I got the definitions right, I think we&apos;re on the<br/>      &gt; same page more or less.  In that case, for my idea of a pure &quot;PI&quot; scale the &quot;octave&quot; period<br/>      &gt; would be PI and the generator would also be PI.</p><p>      I Don&rsquo;t know what you mean. You can&rsquo;t have the period of the same size as the generator because that would create a scale whose smallest contained interval would be the period and there would be no possible way to make smaller intervals then. But you&rsquo;ve said that your tuning uses reduction to 2/1, which probably means that your generator is &bdquo;phi&ldquo; and your period is 2/1. In fact, IIRC, Carl said he thought the same.</p><p>      &gt; Hmm...I missed that message (and, hey, maybe a PI tuning was somewhere in there)...could<br/>      &gt; you please give me a link?</p><p>      Probably there isn&rsquo;t because your tuning doesn&rsquo;t temper out any particular comma, which is the main requirement of regular temperaments.
