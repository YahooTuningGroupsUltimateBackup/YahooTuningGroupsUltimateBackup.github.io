I usually tak&eacute; some time to decide if I want to make a more &quot;composed&quot; piece or just record an improv. But there are obviously some exceptions. For example, when I made the first version of my &quot;Run Down The Whistle&quot; back in December 2007, the first track was completely improvised. Then I had to almost learn my own piece of music just by listening to the recording, measure by measure, to be able to add some chords onto the second track. Nearly half a year later, I made the piece longer and now it&apos;s not an improv anymore. BTW: Until three days ago, that was the only non-improvised piece played in semisixths.
