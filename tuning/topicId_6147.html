In my reply to &quot;the Monz,&quot; by the way, I give more on<br/>Guillaume Costeley (c. 1531-1606) and his formulation of 19-tet (1570)<br/>-- as opposed to 31-tet and related systems.</p><p>&gt;&gt; and mathematically precise 19-tet as defined by Lemme Rossi (1666)</p><p>&gt; Did you mean 31-tET? Who&apos;s Rossi -- tell us more!</p><p>Thanks for catching this slip, but I&apos;m delighted to have provided the<br/>opportunity for more dialogue on a fascinating theorist.</p><p>My source for Lemme Rossi is Henry W. Kaufmann, &quot;More on the Tuning of<br/>the _Archicembalo_,&quot; _Journal of the American Musicological Society_<br/>23:84-94 (1970). Clearly I&apos;d like to learn more about Rossi&apos;s life and<br/>musical activities, and your post prompts me to look into this, but<br/>Kaufmann does include some very interesting information about Rossi&apos;s<br/>treatise regarding the tuning of Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo.</p><p>This treatise, _Sistema musica overo musica speculativa_ (1666), gives<br/>two tunings compared by Kaufmann. The first is a _sistema participato_<br/>or &quot;tempered system&quot; with 19 notes in 1/4-comma meantone, i.e. Gb-A#,<br/>the notes found on the usual &quot;chromatic harpsichords&quot; popular in<br/>Naples around 1600. For a comparison of Rossi&apos;s string lengths for<br/>these 19 notes in this system and in Rossi&apos;s interpretation of<br/>Vicentino&apos;s tuning, see p. 88, Table I, citing Rossi at pp. 83, 86.</p><p>For a table showing Rossi&apos;s string lengths for his version of<br/>Vicentino&apos;s complete 31-note tuning, see Kaufmann&apos;s Table 2, p. 93. As<br/>Kaufmann explains: &quot;Lemme Rossi has given a diagrammatic representa-<br/>tion of this tuning according to string lengths. From these string<br/>lengths, the value of each tone of the cycle in cents can be derived<br/>(Table II). It will be seen that each diesis amounts to from 38.6 to<br/>38.74 cents, and thus, for all intents and purposes, is uniformly<br/>equal.&quot; (Ibid. p. 93).</p><p>Rossi&apos;s mathematics thus indicate that by 1666, at least one theorist<br/>was interpreting Vicentino&apos;s &quot;31-division&quot; on the archicembalo as what<br/>we might well call more specifically &quot;31-tet.&quot;</p><p>Although I happen to like an interpretation in 1/4-comma meantone, in<br/>part because of &quot;historical tuneability&quot; under 16th-century conditions<br/>and in part because of the elegance of having pure 5:4 major thirds,<br/>Rossi&apos;s tuning does indeed constitute a germinal document for 31-tet.</p><p>By the way, could the other musician connected with 19-tet be the organist<br/>Jean Titelouze (1563-1633), whom Mersenne (1636) says had a special<br/>_Epinette_ that &quot;divides the tone in three equal parts.&quot; This is mentioned<br/>in Kenneth J.  Levy&apos;s article on Guillaume Costeley which I cite in the<br/>reply to Joe Monzo (maybe in this same Digest), at pp. 249-250. While I&apos;m<br/>not sure I mentioned Titelouze previously, he certainly deserves to be<br/>mentioned under the heading of 19-tet, based on Levy&apos;s short reference.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
