Imagine multiplying each note in it by some factor,<br/>F.  Call the new scale S_f.  Now see if any notes are shared between the<br/>two scales.  If they are, see if they occupy the same scale positions in<br/>their respective scales.  If they do, write...</p><p>&#x9;S -TC-&gt; S_f</p><p>If they don&apos;t, write...</p><p>&#x9;S -/TC-&gt; S_f.</p><p>Now, the main question is:</p><p>&#x9;IF S -TC-&gt; S_f AND S -TC-&gt; S_g, can S -/TC-&gt; S_(f-g)?</p><p>It is easy to see that this is the same as asking...</p><p>1. If a scale is TC by each of its notes, are each of the resulting scales<br/>TC with eachother?</p><p>...or...</p><p>2. If a scale is TC by each of its notes, is it TC by each of the notes in<br/>its diamond?</p><p>...or...</p><p>3. If a scale is TC by the intervals through which it is connected on a<br/>rectangular lattice, is it TC by the intervals through which is is<br/>connected on a triangular lattice?</p><p>-Carl</p><p>P.S.  Contrary to what I implied in a previous post, this question has<br/>nothing to do with: If a given mode is TC, will all modes be TC?  We&apos;ll get<br/>to that question next time.</p></div><h3><a id=5892 href="#5892">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

All you&apos;re really doing is rotating the scale in<br/>various ways and comparing the rotated configuration with the original one.</p></div><h3><a id=5902 href="#5902">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/1999 5:13:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I don&apos;t see what is gained in talking about specific modes in this context.</p><p>When you take a cross set of a scale and itself, you only multiply by the<br/>intervals measured up from the root.

Then you do the same for a mode of the<br/>scale starting on a pitch a ratio r above the original root. That is<br/>equivalent to transposing the original scale by 1/r. The resulting cross set<br/>will be the same as the original cross set, transposed by 1/r&#xFFFD;. (Can you<br/>read that ASCII? That&apos;s supposed to be 1/(r^2).</p></div>
