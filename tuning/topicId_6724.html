At least that&apos;s what<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I do. (If you&apos;re writing for a sequencer I guess you&apos;d better count on its<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; lack of intelligence, lack of musicality, and completely literal<br/>&gt;&gt; interpretation of your instructions.) For my singers I find that it is<br/>&gt;&gt; often better to not try to be so complete in my instructions. For example,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; when arranging Bydlo (Ox Cart) from Mussorgsky&apos;s Pictures at an<br/>&gt;&gt; Exhibition,<br/>&gt;&gt; I carefully copied all of Mussorgsky&apos;s eighth-note rests, many of which<br/>&gt;&gt; simply indicate phrasing. Well, my singers were so careful not to sing<br/>&gt;&gt; through the rests that they ruined the phrasing! So I rewrote the<br/>&gt;&gt; arrangement without the rests, forcing my singers to find the phrasing. Of<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; course I wished that my singers had exercised more intelligence in their<br/>&gt;&gt; interpretation of the rests, but in any case I think my example shows how<br/>&gt;&gt; a<br/>&gt;&gt; less complete set of instructions can lead to better results.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; We must also remember that the composer himself might not fully know his<br/>&gt;&gt; intention. (Is this dangerous ground? Let me go further: A composer, if he<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; is any good, simply does his best to give instructions to others to<br/>&gt;&gt; recreate sounds that he has imagined, and might make mistakes in<br/>&gt;&gt; transcribing his imagination or might be misunderstood.) On several<br/>&gt;&gt; occasions I&apos;ve had the extremely satisfying experience of hearing one of<br/>&gt;&gt; my<br/>&gt;&gt; singers, even in an audition, sing something I wrote in such a way that I<br/>&gt;&gt; felt as if I had been shown something about my music. What a pleasure that<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; was. I wish that all of you could have performances like that.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; John Link<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/1999 6:23:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig Grady wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Kraig Grady &lt;<a href="mailto:kraiggrady@anaphoria.com">kraiggrady@anaphoria.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JOHNS!<br/>&gt;     You don&apos;t need to tinker with anothers work to experiment, if fact I<br/>&gt; suggest it will get in your way.
