Seriously, though ... I<br/>bought a hand-held cassette tape recorder today, to use to capture sounds<br/>for processing. I was looking around in my office for a spare cassette to<br/>test it with. Well, sitting on a shelf ... right in the open ... was a<br/>cassette labelled &quot;Ed Borasky  Computor Music  1978&quot;. Now strange thing<br/>number one -- it&apos;s not my handwriting on the tape! So of course I played it.<br/>The first section is a three-part harmony of &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot;. I<br/>don&apos;t remember doing this. And the rest of it sounds like some kind of<br/>random loops ... it definitely sounds like something I might have done, but<br/>I can&apos;t for the life of me remember how.</p><p>Strange thing number 2 ... in 1978 if I had any working computer at all, it<br/>was a KIM-1. For you young sprouts, this thing was a 6502 chip with a hex<br/>keypad, a cassette interface for saving and loading programs and something<br/>like 1K bytes of memory. I had an 8-bit DAC hooked up to it. I didn&apos;t get a<br/>real computer (Commodore 64) till 1982 or thereabouts. So I must have<br/>generated this thing on the KIM-1, either using the DAC or tapped into the<br/>cassette recording port. I still have the KIM-1, BTW, and all the manuals,<br/>and I just might be able to find where the code came from. Some of the<br/>sounds are actually quite interesting, and I&apos;m going to scan it into my<br/>computer and put it on my web site. If I can find the code I&apos;ll probably<br/>convert the algorithm to Sfront or CSound and post that, too -- it really<br/>generates some interesting sounds, for example, an overtone series.</p><p>So ... if anyone out there had a KIM-1 and thinks this sounds familiar,<br/>please let me know ...</p><p>(those were the days, eh?)<br/>--<br/>M.

Around 1980, I built a<br/>computer which was a close derivation of the KIM-1, the Junior<br/>computer from Elektuur, a Dutch electronics magazine. It had a<br/>1 MHz clockspeed and 2 Kb of RAM. Then later when the 6581 SID<br/>chip became available, I bought two and soldered them on the<br/>Junior. Also bought a cheap 5 octave keyboard and made some TTL<br/>logic to drive it from the computer&apos;s port. So there I had a<br/>6-voice polyphonic organ with programmable sound! The only<br/>drawback was that the software had to be read from a cassette<br/>tape all the time, so usually I left it on. I don&apos;t remember<br/>doing any tuning experiments with it, I was more interested in<br/>programming some automatic accompaniment.<br/>Really loved the 6502 instruction set with all its addressing<br/>modes. Later at the university I had to program an 8080, yuck!</p><p>&gt;(those were the days, eh?)</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
