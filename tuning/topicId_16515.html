This is an area of microtonal<br/>&gt; technique, that I do not recall being discussed in this forum.<br/>&gt; Xenakis is an important point of reference for me with this technique.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is an area of particular interest here. Ways that I&apos;ve did this<br/>&gt; electronically, are by using portamtento, or alternately, drawing<br/>&gt; pitch bends with a controller window in my sequencer. But by far, the<br/>&gt; most impressive experiments have been with doing this with singing,<br/>&gt; where many voices begin on certain tones and gliss to others.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anybody out there that enjoys the bliss of the gliss?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky Ligon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; P.S. I know that we do have the Glissmeister himself, Seth Austen<br/>&gt; here, who definitely is no stranger to this important musical<br/>&gt; vocabulary.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Jacky,</p><p>I&apos;m quite flattered by your titular addition to my name, however undeserving<br/>I might feel of this accolade. I do love using gliss, my use of it is<br/>entirely from an intuitive level though, as opposed to mathematical, and is<br/>rarely the same from performance to performance of any piece.</p><p>Having read the numerous postings on gliss when I returned home has really<br/>gotten me thinking about how to better notate this in my compositions. I<br/>have always notated my slide pieces in 12-tET (shame on me), and merely<br/>offered a few suggestions on intonation for pitches such as the third. I<br/>think I could get much more exacting, these postings certainly inspire me to<br/>try for this. Back to the drawing board :-)</p><p>Seth</p><p>PS I love group singing of glisses crossing over each other... I think I<br/>first encountered this sort of thing to wonderful effect on Bulgarian<br/>Womens&apos; Choir and David Hykes Harmonic Choir CDs.</p><p>------<br/>Seth Austen<br/><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>email; <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a></p><p>--<br/>&quot;To be nobody-but-myself -- in a world which is doing its best, night and<br/>day, to make you everybody else -- means to fight the hardest battle which<br/>any human being can fight, and never stop fighting.&quot;<br/>                                                -- e.e. cummings</p></div>
