Carl Lumma, June 2003.</p><p>The octave is three cents flat, and there are two sizes of<br/>fifth -- ten meantone fifths and two 709.5-cent fifths.</p><p>My basic idea is to look at the major thirds, while keeping<br/>the fifths between 695 and 710 cents and the octave within<br/>3 cents of just.  The range for the minor third is so wide,<br/>with anything from 6:5 to 19:16 to 13:11 to 7:6 being okay,<br/>that I ignore it.  Sure, sticking to these exact ratios maybe<br/>better than not, but the range of the major third is just so<br/>much more important -- anything much flat of a 5:4 sounds off<br/>to my ear and the sweetness of the interval says goodbye<br/>somewhere around 400 cents -- that I focused on that.</p><p>Anyway, the above scale has the two large fifths separated<br/>by 5 small fifths and gives the following major 3rds...</p><p>(390.0 390.0 403.5 403.5 403.5 403.5 390.0 390.0 403.5 403.5<br/>403.5 403.5)</p><p>...four are way better than equal, and eight are not much<br/>worse.</p><p>If we separate the large fifths by 2 small fifths, we get...</p><p>(390.0 403.5 390.0 403.5 390.0 403.5 403.5 390.0 417.0 390.0<br/>403.5 403.5)</p><p>...five of the better thirds, 7 near-equal ones, and one<br/>14:11!</p><p>Separate the large fifths by one small fifth, get 6 good,<br/>4 near-equal, and 2 14:11 thirds.  Make the large fifths<br/>adjacent on the chain and make that 7, 3, and 3.</p><p>All of these variants will enjoy some minor 7ths much closer<br/>to 7:4.</p><p>I&apos;ve been listening to them, and they sound killer.</p><p>Anybody know if there are any historical &quot;improved meantones&quot;<br/>of which these could be considered 1197-cent-octave versions?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
