But looking at<br/>the piano roll in Cakewalk, I see that I used a lot of neutral thirds. So<br/>this isn&apos;t a fair test of the &quot;beep&quot; temperament, even though it produced<br/>interesting results. Scala shows that the 14-ET neutral third splits into<br/>two intervals; 317.920 cents (the excellent minor third you mentioned) and<br/>361.560 cents (24.75 cents flatter than a major third). It&apos;s likely that<br/>sharpening the neutral thirds to make them closer to a major third is a big<br/>part of why this tuning of _Egress_ sounds better than the 14-ET version.</p><p>The splitting of the perfect fourth into two minor thirds, which is a<br/>prominent feature of the _Egress_ melody, _does_ imply a tempering of<br/>27/25. But it&apos;s better to think of these as subminor thirds in the 14-ET<br/>version. This implies a comma of 49/48, which actually happens to be<br/>consistent with 14-ET.

If you want something<br/>less dull, you probably want more beating, hence deviation from JI<br/>(again if you&apos;re using harmonic timbres).</p></div>
