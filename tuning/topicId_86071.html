Is there<br/>&gt; some required reading<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ve figured out some JI rules aswell that prevent things from sounding<br/>weird.</p><p>- 5-limit JI</p><p>- Stepsizes of melodies. The smallest step must be 16/15, 10/9, 9/8 or 75/64<br/>(steps larger than this can be broken into these smaller steps)<br/>  Offcourse stepsizes like 25/24, 135/128 and 27/25 etc are ok too, but they<br/>give chromatic music and can sound very weird (which when used right is a<br/>good thing) so better leave these till later.</p><p>- No modulating because it can sound very weird too. Best to begin in a<br/>single 12 tone JI scale. Will get to what constitutes modulating later.</p><p>- Avoid dissonant/wolf JI chords unless you&apos;re really sure what you&apos;re<br/>doing.</p><p>- Build scales on 3 connected triads of either 1/1 5/4 3/2 or 1/1 6/5 3/2<br/>(though 1/1 5/4 3/2 15/8 can be included aswell, I&apos;ll get to it later why)<br/>  For instance 1/1 5/4 3/2, 4/3 5/3 2/1 (connected in octave offcourse), 3/2<br/>15/8 9/4, making major scale.<br/>  In the beginning mind stepsizes of melodies mentioned earlyer.<br/>  Then locate (could be 2 locations possible, investigate both) the scale<br/>you just built in the 12tone 5-limit JI scale of 1/1 16/15 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3<br/>45/32 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1<br/> The scales you build using this method will allways fit.</p><p>&gt; OK, the cliffnotes:<br/>&gt; - I V IV I is a beautiful progression<br/>&gt; - I ii bVII I is also<br/>&gt; - In general, there are tons of amazing sounding 5-limit progressions<br/>&gt; - My experiments to extend this and come up with intuitive, emotional,<br/>&gt; aesthetically pleasing 7 and 11-limit progressions have basically<br/>&gt; failed<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ve succeeded in finding aestethically pleasing 7 and 11-limit like<br/>progressions in 5-limit JI.<br/>Take for instance what I believe to be used as the major scale in most music<br/>extended to 12 tones:<br/>1/1 25/24 9/8 75/64 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 25/16 5/3 225/128 15/8 2/1<br/>(this is with the 1/1 at position &quot;8/5&quot; of the 5-limit JI scale I gave<br/>before)</p><p>We find very 7-limit sounding minor triads as 75/64.<br/>Play for instance:<br/>15/16 5/4 3/2 15/8 9/4 45/16<br/>1/1 5/4 3/2 225/128 9/4 45/16<br/>2/3 4/3 5/3 2/1 75/32 6/1<br/>How&apos;s that for a 7 - 11 limit chords :) It sounds great, like jazz, yet<br/>there&apos;s one crucial difference between a real 11-limit chord... the 5-limit<br/>version plays nice with all the other tones, allows inversions and allows so<br/>many chord progressions without comma shifts, whereas 7-limiy doesn&apos;t do any<br/>of these things.<br/>I personally believe 7-limit has no place in music and that the 75/64<br/>interval has allways been confused for a 7-limit interval.</p><p>- Does anyone see the big picture of all of this yet, and of how chord<br/>&gt; progressions work in general?<br/>&gt;</p><p>The big picture I&apos;ve formed myself up till now has to do with permutations<br/>of the harmonic series.<br/>I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve read me talking about it before, but here it is in short<br/>form ones again.</p><p>Take the harmonic series till the 5th harmonic.<br/>Permutate these intervals any way you like / eg change the order of the 4<br/>intervals.<br/>If you see each of the 5 harmonics of the 5-limit harmonic series as an<br/>anchor then the resulting scale of all the permutations is:<br/>1/1 16/15 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1<br/>I see this scale as tonality, as potential for a chord.<br/>One can also have the permutations run freely. Listen to the mp3 at the<br/>bottom of my page for the result: <a href="http://www.develde.net">www.develde.net</a><br/>Then one modulates.<br/>This harmonic permutation structure tells a lot of things. Like the harmonic<br/>structure of the above 12tone scale, but also about modulations.<br/>Like the following (by bach):<br/>C (1/1) - G (3/1) - C (4/1) - E (5/1) -&gt; tonic chord<br/>E (5/4) - G (3/1) - C (4/1) - E (5/1)<br/>G (3/2) - G (3/1) - C (4/1) - D (9/2)<br/>G (3/4) - B (15/4) - D (9/2) - G (6/1) -&gt; V chord<br/>D (9/8) - A (10/3) - D (9/2) - G (6/1) -&gt; II Chord<br/>F (4/3) - A (10/3) - D (9/2) - F (16/3)<br/>A (5/3) - A (10/3) - D (9/2) - E (5/1)<br/>A (5/6) - C (4/1) - E (5/1) - A (20/3) -&gt; A minor tonic chord</p><p>Harmonic permutation structure sais that it can&apos;t be played in a consonant<br/>manner / without wolves. And that it must be the above.<br/>Try as much as you like with harmonic permutations to find a solution to the<br/>above progression but there isn&apos;t one (also no comma shifting one)<br/>One really can&apos;t do anything wrong with harmonic permutation structure.</p><p>Here another progression example but this one is all consonant (both chords<br/>and simple melodic stepsizes as I mentioned before):<br/>1/1 6/5 3/2<br/>16/15 4/3 8/5<br/>5/4 3/2 15/8<br/>4/3 5/3 2/1<br/>3/2 15/8 9/4<br/>8/5 2/1 12/5<br/>15/8 9/4 45/16<br/>2/1 12/5 3/1<br/>15/8 9/4 45/16<br/>8/5 2/1 12/5<br/>3/2 9/5 9/4<br/>4/3 8/5 2/1<br/>5/4 3/2 15/8<br/>16/15 4/3 8/5<br/>1/1 5/4 3/2</p><p>As you can see it uses all 12 tones.<br/>(but it doesn&apos;t use all triads possible, there are more + all major seventh<br/>chords)</p><p>Ah long story. There&apos;s so much more to tell but I&apos;d be typing too long, I<br/>should put more work into making a proper website then I&apos;ll only have to<br/>write everything once :)</p><p>But 5-limit JI can do it all.<br/>Consonant music in one tonic with a fixed scale.<br/>Consonant music that modulates all over the place.<br/>Dissonant chords diatonic music in one tonic, dissonant diatonic music<br/>modulating all over the place.<br/>Consonat chormatic music, dissonant chormatic music.<br/>Jazz / blues (75/64 etc)<br/>Arabic music<br/>Atonal music<br/>etc</p><p>Btw once you accept 9/8 4/3 5/3 as a ii chord in major mode etc, the old<br/>idea that JI can&apos;t do common practice music is gone!<br/>It can do it.<br/>And a lot of music with suprising ease.<br/>My continued strugle with drei equale is not because it is impossible. It is<br/>because I wish to have a good analisys technique that&apos;ll tell me exactly<br/>when the modulations are in a consistent way.

It even shows how to do 11-limit extensions,<br/>&gt; much like jazz extends the triads of the diatonic scale.</p><p>I have read it, although I treated it mainly like a curiosity that was<br/>out of the realm of what I was looking for. I think I was a bit put<br/>off by Paul&apos;s assertion that many of the modes that I like aren&apos;t<br/>valid scales to place over the I chord, which runs counter to my<br/>entire compositional paradigm. I&apos;ll read it again though, because now<br/>you have my curiosity piqued.</p><p>I think what I also need to do is reread Graham&apos;s work with my<br/>elevated awareness of what&apos;s going on now.</p><p>&gt; These decatonic scales belong to what we now call the pajara<br/>&gt; temperament. It&apos;s definitely the best temperament for what<br/>&gt; you&apos;re trying to do -- functional 7-limit harmony. Moreover,<br/>&gt; 12 is a pajara system, and it&apos;s been suggested that many<br/>&gt; jazz standards are actually using it.</p><p>Now that&apos;s fascinating. I really need to dig into this.</p><p>&gt; But there are other temperaments. In 31, there are 7-limit<br/>&gt; meantone extensions that&apos;ll let you leverage the skills you<br/>&gt; already have. In 72 there&apos;s miracle[10], the decatonic<br/>&gt; miracle scale. And many others in 31 and 72. You just have<br/>&gt; to know where to look. That&apos;s the point of the theory of<br/>&gt; regular temperaments... otherwise these large scales can be<br/>&gt; completely daunting.</p><p>Well, I&apos;ve been looking at 31 to extend meantone, thinking that I was<br/>used to meantone - but perhaps I&apos;ve been thinking more conceptually in<br/>pajara. I have a much different take on harmony and such than most<br/>classically oriented composers do, and it springs from my jazz ear<br/>training at UM. Perhaps this means I&apos;ve been using 12-tet to &quot;think&quot;<br/>in another temperament rather than meantone all along - like I&apos;ve been<br/>thinking in pajara without realizing it.</p><p>I think what I need to do is figure out what the point of temperament<br/>IS - I have always viewed it as a slight mistuning of the real<br/>underlying reality of music (JI), for convenience&apos;s sake, and to limit<br/>the amount of notes that someone has to think of. But when I listen to<br/>comma pump-based chord progressions in 12-tet -- such as I vi ii V --<br/>it seems clear that something else is going on.</p><p>Jeez, I should have written this thread 2 years ago! Thanks for the<br/>insight. Can&apos;t you just write a book on this already, man?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=86127 href="#86127">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2010 6:03:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I&apos;ve figured out some JI rules aswell that prevent things from sounding weird.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - 5-limit JI<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Stepsizes of melodies. The smallest step must be 16/15, 10/9, 9/8 or 75/64 (steps larger than this can be broken into these smaller steps)<br/>&gt; &nbsp; Offcourse stepsizes like 25/24, 135/128 and 27/25 etc are ok too, but they give chromatic music and can sound very weird (which when used right is a good thing) so better leave these till later.</p><p>I think you&apos;re on the right track with this, and this is the sort of<br/>thing that I have realized too. The fact that you referred to it as<br/>&quot;chromatic music&quot; shows that we&apos;re on the same page with this, except<br/>I don&apos;t think that 135/128 would really be a &quot;chromatic&quot; interval. To<br/>me, the characteristic &quot;feel&quot; of chromatic intervals seems to involve<br/>two major thirds stacked on top of each other - like 25/16 being<br/>involved somewhere or something. And on that note, I would say that<br/>75/64 is a very &quot;chromatic&quot; sounding interval.</p><p>Put another way - most intervals that are labeled &quot;chromatic&quot; tend to<br/>be two units out along the 5-axis in 5-limit pitch space. Whether this<br/>is just a pattern I&apos;ve noticed or some underlying tenet of reality,<br/>I&apos;m not sure. I think the word &quot;chromatic&quot; originally evolved more in<br/>a pitch-class-labeling meantone sense.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve succeeded in finding aestethically pleasing 7 and 11-limit like progressions in 5-limit JI.<br/>&gt; Take for instance what I believe to be used as the major scale in most music extended to 12 tones:<br/>&gt; 1/1 25/24 9/8 75/64 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 25/16 5/3 225/128 15/8 2/1<br/>&gt; (this is with the 1/1 at position &quot;8/5&quot; of the 5-limit JI scale I gave before)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We find very 7-limit sounding minor triads as 75/64.<br/>&gt; Play for instance:<br/>&gt; 15/16 5/4 3/2 15/8 9/4 45/16<br/>&gt; 1/1 5/4 3/2 225/128 9/4 45/16<br/>&gt; 2/3 4/3 5/3 2/1 75/32 6/1<br/>&gt; How&apos;s that for a 7 - 11 limit chords :) It sounds great, like jazz, yet there&apos;s one crucial difference between a real 11-limit chord... the 5-limit version plays nice with all the other tones, allows inversions and allows so many chord progressions without comma shifts, whereas 7-limiy doesn&apos;t do any of these things.<br/>&gt; I personally believe 7-limit has no place in music and that the 75/64 interval has allways been confused for a 7-limit interval.</p><p>So what&apos;s the name of the temperament eliminating the difference<br/>between 75/64 and 7/6? That would be the septimal comma, right? Isn&apos;t<br/>that pajara?</p><p>&gt; Btw once you accept 9/8 4/3 5/3 as a ii chord in major mode etc, the old idea that JI can&apos;t do common practice music is gone!<br/>&gt; It can do it.<br/>&gt; And a lot of music with suprising ease.</p><p>Perhaps the idea is that if you temper out 81/80, you get the &quot;mental<br/>function&quot; of 9/8 4/3 5/3, but the &quot;harmonic resonance&quot; of 10:12:15,<br/>thus getting you the best of both worlds. But I&apos;m completely useless<br/>with temperament, my experiments having been confined to coming up<br/>with novel isolated harmonic structures.</p><p>&gt; My continued strugle with drei equale is not because it is impossible.

Yes, as with you, this is just my opinion, but you<br/>&gt; tend to be dismissive of a lot of music, much of which is valued by many of<br/>&gt; the members on these lists.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That&apos;s a fair view.<br/>And it&apos;s true. I don&apos;t like tunings other than JI.<br/>But I do still enjoy good music in any tuning :)<br/>But it&apos;s just a personal opinion and preference that the music I heard<br/>posted on these lists so far doesn&apos;t really trigger much in me.<br/>But since much music here is about certain tunings which I don&apos;t find<br/>interesting that&apos;s not surprising I guess.<br/>There&apos;s a lot of experimenting on these lists and that&apos;s great offcourse.<br/>But in my view it&apos;s apparently pretty hard to get all the parts together<br/>that are required to make great music.<br/>But that&apos;s just my taste.<br/>I don&apos;t have high apreciation for commercial music either. Though this has<br/>the advantage that it&apos;s professionally produced. Music on these lists isn&apos;t.<br/>Anyhow these are just my opinions. Not ment in a disrespectfull way.<br/>Ahh it&apos;s a long story to explain what I ment and why I said it and how it&apos;s<br/>related to people commenting negatively on my research.<br/>But it was ment as let me do my thing in piece even if you don&apos;t agree. I<br/>let eveybody else do their thing in piece even if I don&apos;t agree.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, whether one takes *limits* in the intonation sense, or in the sense of<br/>&gt; boundaries, I&apos;m all for loosening and raising the limits.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J<br/>&gt;</p><p>Perfectly allright with me :)<br/>All I ask for is it beeing ok too that I&apos;m doing my thing.

The fact that you referred to it as<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;chromatic music&quot; shows that we&apos;re on the same page with this, except<br/>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t think that 135/128 would really be a &quot;chromatic&quot; interval. To<br/>&gt;&gt; me, the characteristic &quot;feel&quot; of chromatic intervals seems to involve<br/>&gt;&gt; two major thirds stacked on top of each other - like 25/16 being<br/>&gt;&gt; involved somewhere or something. And on that note, I would say that<br/>&gt;&gt; 75/64 is a very &quot;chromatic&quot; sounding interval.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 75/64 one finds in the harmonic minor mode.<br/>&gt; I&apos;d still call that a diatonic mode.<br/>&gt; And 135/128 I see as not beeing a normal step in a diatonic mode, a very chromatic step.<br/>&gt; But my use of the word diatonic and chromatic may not be textbook correct.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Put another way - most intervals that are labeled &quot;chromatic&quot; tend to<br/>&gt;&gt; be two units out along the 5-axis in 5-limit pitch space. Whether this<br/>&gt;&gt; is just a pattern I&apos;ve noticed or some underlying tenet of reality,<br/>&gt;&gt; I&apos;m not sure. I think the word &quot;chromatic&quot; originally evolved more in<br/>&gt;&gt; a pitch-class-labeling meantone sense.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve succeeded in finding aestethically pleasing 7 and 11-limit like progressions in 5-limit JI.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Take for instance what I believe to be used as the major scale in most music extended to 12 tones:<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; 1/1 25/24 9/8 75/64 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 25/16 5/3 225/128 15/8 2/1<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; (this is with the 1/1 at position &quot;8/5&quot; of the 5-limit JI scale I gave before)<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; We find very 7-limit sounding minor triads as 75/64.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Play for instance:<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; 15/16 5/4 3/2 15/8 9/4 45/16<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; 1/1 5/4 3/2 225/128 9/4 45/16<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; 2/3 4/3 5/3 2/1 75/32 6/1<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; How&apos;s that for a 7 - 11 limit chords :) It sounds great, like jazz, yet there&apos;s one crucial difference between a real 11-limit chord... the 5-limit version plays nice with all the other tones, allows inversions and allows so many chord progressions without comma shifts, whereas 7-limiy doesn&apos;t do any of these things.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; I personally believe 7-limit has no place in music and that the 75/64 interval has allways been confused for a 7-limit interval.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; So what&apos;s the name of the temperament eliminating the difference<br/>&gt;&gt; between 75/64 and 7/6? That would be the septimal comma, right? Isn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; that pajara?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know much about temperaments.<br/>&gt; But to temper this interval would mean you have to temper for instance the major third in a major triad.<br/>&gt; Besides this I see no reason for tempering it.<br/>&gt; Everybody like the number 7 but is it actually better?<br/>&gt; I think not. Try playing the above progression in 7-limit, it will sound weird and require comma shifts etc.<br/>&gt; Also 75/64 has it&apos;s own &quot;ring&quot;. Try playing 1/1 2/1 75/32 or 75/16 to hear it. Sounds perfectly in tune to me, 7/6 doesn&apos;t. It rings strong, but in the wrong way to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Btw once you accept 9/8 4/3 5/3 as a ii chord in major mode etc, the old idea that JI can&apos;t do common practice music is gone!<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; It can do it.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; And a lot of music with suprising ease.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Perhaps the idea is that if you temper out 81/80, you get the &quot;mental<br/>&gt;&gt; function&quot; of 9/8 4/3 5/3, but the &quot;harmonic resonance&quot; of 10:12:15,<br/>&gt;&gt; thus getting you the best of both worlds. But I&apos;m completely useless<br/>&gt;&gt; with temperament, my experiments having been confined to coming up<br/>&gt;&gt; with novel isolated harmonic structures.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes that&apos;s how I see it too :)<br/>&gt; Mental function of 9/8 4/3 5/3 but harmonic resonance/ring/consonance resembling 10:12:15<br/>&gt; But after repeated listening and getting used to 9/8 4/3 5/3 I really really like it and personally wouldn&apos;t have it any other way anymore.<br/>&gt; And besides this, to temper this interval has a domino effect and means other intervals get tempered aswell, like a major chord becoming tempered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; My continued strugle with drei equale is not because it is impossible.

It turns your computer keyboard into an isomorphic keyboard with the same fingering in every key and tuning (within a given temperament). On this interface you can play in 12-, 17-, 19-, 31-, and 53- equal divisions of the octave with the SAME FINGERING :D<br/>This way you don&apos;t have to spend a year learning the basic patterns of a single tuning just to find out you don&apos;t love it. Instead, you spend that time learning the patterns of  a given temperament and learn how to apply them to every tuning within that temperament.</p><p>While providing you with an ergonomic interface through which you can play every tuning with the same fingering, the program also modifies the harmonic structure of the timbres you use to maximize sensory consonance. It is the harmonic structure that determines sensory consonance experienced from intervals, both harmonic and melodic, played with complex tones, and the TFS changes the partial structure of the tones you use to make sure they match up closest to your current tuning. This, though altering the timbre of your sounds slightly, provides consonance in many tunings so that they don&apos;t sound NEAR as &quot;weird&quot;.<br/>For instance, 22-edo the major third gets pretty darn sharp. Instead of just dealing with the clash, the TFS remaps the partials of your given tone so that it is this &quot;sharp&quot; third that is the one that is MOST consonant for that timbre. This sharp third no longer sounds sharp, just different.<br/>Here is a short video demonstrating dynamic tonality:<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd4h8vmEsQM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd4h8vmEsQM</a></p><p>And you can download it (for free) at the bottom of this page:<br/><a href="http://www.dynamictonality.com/spectools.htm">http://www.dynamictonality.com/spectools.htm</a></p><p>Hope this helps you find your way =)</p><p>John Moriarty</p></div><h3><a id=86146 href="#86146">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2010 10:13:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jlmoriart&quot; &lt;JlMoriart@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I highly recommend checking out the TransFormSynth,<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; And you can download it (for free) at the bottom of this page:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.dynamictonality.com/spectools.htm">http://www.dynamictonality.com/spectools.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hope this helps you find your way =)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; John Moriarty</p><p>I think my head just exploded.

The thing is that although you<br/>&gt; &gt; assert that only 5-limit music sounds good to you -- keep in mind that<br/>&gt; &gt; we have the benefit of centuries of research that have helped us<br/>&gt; &gt; figure out how 5-limit music works.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But without arguing over the matter, let&apos;s put it this way: there may<br/>&gt; &gt; very well be some neurological or psychological reason why 5-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; music is &quot;optimal&quot; in one way or another. However, there would have to<br/>&gt; &gt; be some explanation WHY it&apos;s optimal, why it&apos;s better than 3-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; music, why it can&apos;t be expanded to 7-limit music, etc.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Your assertion that 5-limit JI is basically the best there can be<br/>&gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t have much logical backing without some explanation as to why.<br/>&gt; &gt; Otherwise, one might ask if it&apos;s simply the best there is so far. Many<br/>&gt; &gt; would even contest the fact that it&apos;s the best so far as well.

The fact that you referred to it as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;chromatic music&quot; shows that we&apos;re on the same page with this, except<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I don&apos;t think that 135/128 would really be a &quot;chromatic&quot; interval. To<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; me, the characteristic &quot;feel&quot; of chromatic intervals seems to involve<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; two major thirds stacked on top of each other - like 25/16 being<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; involved somewhere or something. And on that note, I would say that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 75/64 is a very &quot;chromatic&quot; sounding interval.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 75/64 one finds in the harmonic minor mode.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;d still call that a diatonic mode.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; And 135/128 I see as not beeing a normal step in a diatonic mode, a<br/>&gt; very chromatic step.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But my use of the word diatonic and chromatic may not be textbook<br/>&gt; correct.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Put another way - most intervals that are labeled &quot;chromatic&quot; tend to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; be two units out along the 5-axis in 5-limit pitch space. Whether this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is just a pattern I&apos;ve noticed or some underlying tenet of reality,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I&apos;m not sure. I think the word &quot;chromatic&quot; originally evolved more in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a pitch-class-labeling meantone sense.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve succeeded in finding aestethically pleasing 7 and 11-limit like<br/>&gt; progressions in 5-limit JI.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Take for instance what I believe to be used as the major scale in<br/>&gt; most music extended to 12 tones:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1/1 25/24 9/8 75/64 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 25/16 5/3 225/128 15/8 2/1<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (this is with the 1/1 at position &quot;8/5&quot; of the 5-limit JI scale I<br/>&gt; gave before)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; We find very 7-limit sounding minor triads as 75/64.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Play for instance:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 15/16 5/4 3/2 15/8 9/4 45/16<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1/1 5/4 3/2 225/128 9/4 45/16<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2/3 4/3 5/3 2/1 75/32 6/1<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How&apos;s that for a 7 - 11 limit chords :) It sounds great, like jazz,<br/>&gt; yet there&apos;s one crucial difference between a real 11-limit chord... the<br/>&gt; 5-limit version plays nice with all the other tones, allows inversions and<br/>&gt; allows so many chord progressions without comma shifts, whereas 7-limiy<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t do any of these things.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I personally believe 7-limit has no place in music and that the<br/>&gt; 75/64 interval has allways been confused for a 7-limit interval.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So what&apos;s the name of the temperament eliminating the difference<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; between 75/64 and 7/6? That would be the septimal comma, right? Isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that pajara?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know much about temperaments.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But to temper this interval would mean you have to temper for instance<br/>&gt; the major third in a major triad.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides this I see no reason for tempering it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Everybody like the number 7 but is it actually better?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think not. Try playing the above progression in 7-limit, it will<br/>&gt; sound weird and require comma shifts etc.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Also 75/64 has it&apos;s own &quot;ring&quot;. Try playing 1/1 2/1 75/32 or 75/16 to<br/>&gt; hear it. Sounds perfectly in tune to me, 7/6 doesn&apos;t. It rings strong, but<br/>&gt; in the wrong way to me.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Btw once you accept 9/8 4/3 5/3 as a ii chord in major mode etc, the<br/>&gt; old idea that JI can&apos;t do common practice music is gone!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It can do it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; And a lot of music with suprising ease.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Perhaps the idea is that if you temper out 81/80, you get the &quot;mental<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; function&quot; of 9/8 4/3 5/3, but the &quot;harmonic resonance&quot; of 10:12:15,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; thus getting you the best of both worlds. But I&apos;m completely useless<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with temperament, my experiments having been confined to coming up<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with novel isolated harmonic structures.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes that&apos;s how I see it too :)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mental function of 9/8 4/3 5/3 but harmonic resonance/ring/consonance<br/>&gt; resembling 10:12:15<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But after repeated listening and getting used to 9/8 4/3 5/3 I really<br/>&gt; really like it and personally wouldn&apos;t have it any other way anymore.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; And besides this, to temper this interval has a domino effect and means<br/>&gt; other intervals get tempered aswell, like a major chord becoming tempered.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; My continued strugle with drei equale is not because it is<br/>&gt; impossible.

It turns your computer keyboard into an isomorphic<br/>&gt; keyboard with the same fingering in every key and tuning (within a given<br/>&gt; temperament). On this interface you can play in 12-, 17-, 19-, 31-, and 53-<br/>&gt; equal divisions of the octave with the SAME FINGERING :D<br/>&gt; This way you don&apos;t have to spend a year learning the basic patterns of a<br/>&gt; single tuning just to find out you don&apos;t love it. Instead, you spend that<br/>&gt; time learning the patterns of a given temperament and learn how to apply<br/>&gt; them to every tuning within that temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While providing you with an ergonomic interface through which you can play<br/>&gt; every tuning with the same fingering, the program also modifies the harmonic<br/>&gt; structure of the timbres you use to maximize sensory consonance. It is the<br/>&gt; harmonic structure that determines sensory consonance experienced from<br/>&gt; intervals, both harmonic and melodic, played with complex tones, and the TFS<br/>&gt; changes the partial structure of the tones you use to make sure they match<br/>&gt; up closest to your current tuning. This, though altering the timbre of your<br/>&gt; sounds slightly, provides consonance in many tunings so that they don&apos;t<br/>&gt; sound NEAR as &quot;weird&quot;.<br/>&gt; For instance, 22-edo the major third gets pretty darn sharp. Instead of<br/>&gt; just dealing with the clash, the TFS remaps the partials of your given tone<br/>&gt; so that it is this &quot;sharp&quot; third that is the one that is MOST consonant for<br/>&gt; that timbre. This sharp third no longer sounds sharp, just different.<br/>&gt; Here is a short video demonstrating dynamic tonality:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd4h8vmEsQM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd4h8vmEsQM</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And you can download it (for free) at the bottom of this page:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.dynamictonality.com/spectools.htm">http://www.dynamictonality.com/spectools.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hope this helps you find your way =)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; John Moriarty<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86150 href="#86150">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2010 11:29:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I think my head just exploded.

Let me show what I<br/>mean...</p><p>Let&apos;s imagine you were working in strict JI and notating the notes in<br/>the key of C. Acoustically C would be the 1/1. Now, let&apos;s think about<br/>the E above C. If your notation was based on a circle of fifths the<br/>E would be acoustically an 81/64 while you might notate 5/4 above C<br/>as E- for example. Alternatively, if the notation was based like Ben<br/>Johnston&apos;s on just major diatonic scale, 5/4 would be notated as E<br/>and 81/64 as E+. The important thing to realize about both of these<br/>notations is that both of those notes are some kind of E. This<br/>implies that they are also heard as versions of the same thing. So<br/>the essential spirit that leads to tempering already exists in the<br/>minds of many strict JI composers too.</p><p>Temperament just makes these different versions of the same thing also<br/>acoustically identical. The point of this is to have chords<br/>reasonably close to their ideal JI versions while avoiding commatic<br/>melodic movement which many find unpleasant. But of course there are<br/>other ways to handle this than fixed-pitch temperament, some kind of<br/>adaptive tuning for example.</p><p>Kalle Aho</p></div><h3><a id=86166 href="#86166">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2010 7:21:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike B&gt; &quot;I have always viewed it as a slight mistuning of</p><p>the real underlying reality of music (JI), for convenience&apos; s sake,</p><p>and to limit the amount of notes that someone has to think of.&quot;</p><p>   Oddly enough, to a fair extent, so have I.  At least, among the people who I see &quot;prophetizing&quot; their use of JI: the idea seems to be simply to temper to acheive better &quot;average dyadic purity&quot; rather than to, say, increase the degree of tonal color or number of chords available.</p><p>Kalle&gt;&quot;5/4 would be notated as E and 81/64 as E+.&quot;<br/>   Right, so in this example (and many others) different versions of a note are established, each to harmonize more purely with particular other notes forming perfect dyads.  And all adaptive JI does is determine that selections while avoiding commatic melodic movement so much as possible, correct?</p><p>&gt;&quot;If your notation was based on a circle of fifths the<br/>E would be acoustically an 81/64 while you might notate 5/4 above C<br/>as E- for example.<br/>Temperament just makes these different versions of the same thing also<br/>acoustically identical.&quot;</p><p>    Right.  You could say I consider a loophole in many people&apos;s though process is the idea that everything must aim for the ideal of being more or less &quot;acoustically identical&quot; to 12TET tones.  For example 11/9: when I made a scale with it I was posed the question (paraphrased) &quot;is this supposed to be an E or a D#?!&quot;</p><p>&gt;&quot;So the essential spirit that leads to tempering already exists in the minds of many strict JI composers too. &quot;<br/>     Then again, of course, 11/9 can be considered JI, but many people would avoid tones like that as they are of &quot;high limit&quot; (11, to be exact).<br/>    I guess you could say that&apos;s what I mean in a sense by &quot;strict-JI&quot; as well...the quest to keep low limits and the idea that only the lowest limits (particular 7 and under) consistute enough consonance to form &quot;resolved sounding&quot; chords.</p><p>   A flip question becomes: why argue about a single &quot;fixed&quot; JI scale<br/>when you can just use adaptive JI to do &quot;perfect JI purity tempering&quot;?   I sure hope few people view adaptive<br/>JI with unnoticably small commatic melody movement as the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of tuning though...  Because then I fear once the &quot;purity equation&quot; problem is solved few of us would experiment with anything more complex than, say, a 7:8:9 chord IE other chords that yield more complex tonal colors.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=86167 href="#86167">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2010 8:02:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Oh I have reaaaally reaaaally good tip for working with 5-limit JI!! :)</p><p>I can&apos;t beleive I missed the importance of this before!!<br/>I had half found and realised this trick before but had so many things to<br/>worry about I had put this on in the back of my mind.<br/>It is so much nicer to work with than working out permutation possibilities!<br/>:)</p><p>Ok here it is.<br/>To determine wether a minor triad is the consonant 1/1 6/5 3/2 or one of the<br/>more dissonant variants like 1/1 32/27 40/27 or 1/1 75/64 3/2 (I don&apos;t know<br/>yet about 1/1 32/27 1024/675, perhaps it is never allowed. and these are all<br/>major triad possibilities in 5-limit permutation JI).<br/>There is the following trick:<br/>Every single instance of 1/1 6/5 3/2 can also be played as 8/5 2/1 12/5 3/2.<br/>In other words a major 7th chord of 1/1 5/4 3/2 15/8, with the minor triad<br/>as 5/4 3/2 15/8!!<br/>This will make clearly audible the true structure of the permutation.</p><p>Now take for instance the I-vi-ii-V example:<br/>I -&gt; C-E-G clearly major chord.<br/>vi -&gt; C-E-A minor chord, but which one? play F-A-C-E, does it sound right?<br/>it does, then yes it&apos;s a 1/1 6/5 3/2 minor.<br/>ii -&gt; D-F-A minor chord, but which one? play Bb-D-F-A, does it sound right?<br/>well... hmmm this does sound nice, but it doesn&apos;t sound at all like the<br/>chord we ment does it!!

So, sadly...it seems you&apos;re not gaining extra possibilities for chords, but merely trading purity from certain chords to others.

But we have to remember even math can be viewed subjectively within music.  In fact even the so-called objective theories such as roughness/critical-band and periodicity can be viewed as subjective as different people stress those two to different amounts.  An extreme example some just need periodicity and don&apos;t care about roughness and actually love the sound of harmonic distortion (even for a dyad of 15/14 AKA a &quot;half step&quot;) while others can&apos;t stand roughness of two notes less than a full two whole steps apart.   Also some the critical band roughness of overtones matters a lot and<br/>Setharesian timbres can make even the most un-periodic and rough scales sound pure to these people.  Not to mention the issue of the mood of chords: some people may like a 7:8:10 chord more than a 2:3:4 just because of its mood without regard to roughness, timbre, or periodicity.</p><p>  And of course, many people think somewhere inbetween...taking a bit of each theory and weighing how much each well-established theory matters by their own personal preference.    To me any theory where 80%+ of people think it increases musicality/sound-makes-you-feel-good-ness is worth holding as objective and a good rule of thumb is try to maximize all of the above so much as you can in a balanced fashion..</p><p>Marcel&gt;&quot;...not 1/1 32/27 3/2 which is never possible.&quot;<br/>     I&apos;ll say this much, it&apos;s generally agreed upon by many (and thus fairly objective) that tones very high up on the harmonic series AKA tones lacking much periodicity at all....generally sound unresolved (unless they are within, say, 12 cents of a JI ratio that has good/short periodicity).<br/>   Thus 1/1 32/27 3/2 becomes 54:64:81...so far from periodic I&apos;d be surprised if anyone considered it consonant: I think that&apos;s what Marcel is trying to say.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t know yet about 1/1 32/27 1024/675, perhaps it is never<br/>allowed.&quot;<br/>   This just sounds weird to me.  True 1024 is within a few cents of 34/27...but is the x/27 harmonic series partial really close enough to the center to be OK?  This is very subjective ground, IMVHO.  To me around harmonic 18+ is where things get too un-periodic (having a very long period, kind of like my...(LOL)) while Marcel, I&apos;m guessing, thinks that happens around more like harmonic #30.  And I know some people won&apos;t touch anything over about x/10 and consider it &quot;terribly dissonant&quot;.</p><p>  I think where Marcel is getting trouble is instead of saying &quot;it sounds too un-periodic to me&quot; he&apos;ll say things like &quot;it isn&apos;t allowed&quot; that seem to indirectly imply his opinion is the exclusive answer.  I try my best (as I&apos;m sure many of you do) to say things in the form of &quot;this is my opinion and I believe it could help of X issue in tuning math or at least reveal a good direction to go when searching for answers&quot;.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=86179 href="#86179">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2010 10:21:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; You obviously think that your take on JI exists objectively and is<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;out there&quot; to be discovered.

Because in the first chord,<br/>you hear the C-D# as a major third on top of a fifth on top of a major<br/>third -- or 75/32 -- but in the second chord, you hear the C-Eb as a<br/>minor third, or 6/5 (or 19/16 or whatever you&apos;d like).</p><p>What&apos;s the difference?

It turns your computer keyboard into an isomorphic keyboard with the same fingering in every key and tuning (within a given temperament). On this interface you can play in 12-, 17-, 19-, 31-, and 53- equal divisions of the octave with the SAME FINGERING :D<br/>&gt; This way you don&apos;t have to spend a year learning the basic patterns of a single tuning just to find out you don&apos;t love it. Instead, you spend that time learning the patterns of  a given temperament and learn how to apply them to every tuning within that temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While providing you with an ergonomic interface through which you can play every tuning with the same fingering, the program also modifies the harmonic structure of the timbres you use to maximize sensory consonance. It is the harmonic structure that determines sensory consonance experienced from intervals, both harmonic and melodic, played with complex tones, and the TFS changes the partial structure of the tones you use to make sure they match up closest to your current tuning. This, though altering the timbre of your sounds slightly, provides consonance in many tunings so that they don&apos;t sound NEAR as &quot;weird&quot;.<br/>&gt; For instance, 22-edo the major third gets pretty darn sharp. Instead of just dealing with the clash, the TFS remaps the partials of your given tone so that it is this &quot;sharp&quot; third that is the one that is MOST consonant for that timbre. This sharp third no longer sounds sharp, just different.<br/>&gt; Here is a short video demonstrating dynamic tonality:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd4h8vmEsQM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd4h8vmEsQM</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And you can download it (for free) at the bottom of this page:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.dynamictonality.com/spectools.htm">http://www.dynamictonality.com/spectools.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hope this helps you find your way =)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; John Moriarty<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86192 href="#86192">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2010 1:36:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wish I had joined this list 3 years earlier.</p><p>&gt; As it turns out, decatonic scales HAVE been used extensively in Jazz.<br/>&gt; One of the most common bebop scales is a major scale with added blue<br/>&gt; 3rd, 5th and 7th: C D Eb E F F# G A Bb B.

Modern guys are<br/>starting to move towards a different decatonic scale though - C C# D<br/>D# E F# G G# A B C - this is basically a lydian scale with a &quot;#15&quot;<br/>thrown in, and giving the option between lydian and lydian augmented.<br/>It&apos;s a mixture of lydian, lydian augmented, lydian #2, and lydian aug<br/>#2 -- which are all modes of the 4 usual parent scales of western<br/>music - with the option of the #1 thrown in as well, which is related<br/>to the other extensions by fifth, as well as to the root directly via<br/>17/16, and to the D# by a major second, and to the A by a major third,<br/>etc. There are all sorts of 17- and 19- limit intervals being tempered<br/>out here. Sometimes an A# can be used as well, making it an 11 note<br/>scale.</p><p>And if you throw in an F (which merges lydian augmented with ionian<br/>augmented), you get the full 12 note scale, but conceived of as a far<br/>cry from it being a &quot;chromatic&quot; scale, with every note having a<br/>possible harmonic function. Perhaps this is what Bartok was also doing<br/>with his polymodal chromatic scales. Perhaps once I finally figure out<br/>what&apos;s going on with temperament in general, I&apos;ll try to reverse<br/>engineer some linear or planar temperament making use of this fact.</p><p>For those curious as to what this scale sounds like, you can hear my<br/>piece &quot;Sand Prism&quot; here:<br/><a href="http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/students/mbattaglia/Senior_Recital/1-01%20Sand%20Prism.mp3">http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/students/mbattaglia/Senior_Recital/1-01%20Sand%20Prism.mp3</a></p><p>It&apos;s a bit long, but demonstrates the harmonic concept.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, my feeling is paultone/twintone is in fact the second most<br/>&gt; common linear temperament in western music after meantone, and<br/>&gt; therefore warrants more study.</p><p>I have often noticed that my harmonic ideas differ quite a bit from<br/>the usual &quot;classical&quot; approach -- perhaps it&apos;s that I tend to think<br/>naturally in a pajara or dominant context, and the classical folks<br/>tend to think in meantone.</p><p>What temperament was Debussy thinking in? How about Ravel?</p><p>This has been a very inspiring day.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Tue, Feb 9, 2010 at 1:49 PM, gdsecor &lt;<a href="mailto:gdsecor@yahoo.com">gdsecor@yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kalle&quot; &lt;kalleaho@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It describes the decatonic scales I mentioned, and tells you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how the tetrads work in a way analogous to the triads of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; diatonic scale.

At least, among the<br/>&gt; people who I see &quot;prophetizing&quot; their use of JI: the idea seems to<br/>&gt; be simply to temper to acheive better &quot;average dyadic purity&quot;<br/>&gt; rather than to, say, increase the degree of tonal color or number<br/>&gt; of chords available.</p><p>It depends what you take as chords. If any kind of subset is a chord<br/>then any scale, tempered or not, with the same number of notes has<br/>the same number of chords. On the other hand, if chords have to be<br/>consonant, then tempering can increase the number of chords<br/>available.</p><p>&gt; Kalle&gt;&quot;5/4 would be notated as E and 81/64 as E+.&quot;<br/>&gt;    Right, so in this example (and many others) different versions<br/>&gt; of a note are established, each to harmonize more purely with<br/>&gt; particular other notes forming perfect dyads.  And all adaptive JI<br/>&gt; does is determine that selections while avoiding commatic melodic<br/>&gt; movement so much as possible, correct?</p><p>This is basically correct although the kind of adaptive tuning I<br/>advocate doesn&apos;t try to avoid inflections but minimizes the pitch<br/>range of a note (that also keeps inflections small).</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;If your notation was based on a circle of fifths the E would be<br/>&gt; acoustically an 81/64 while you might notate 5/4 above C as E- for<br/>&gt; example. Temperament just makes these different versions of the<br/>&gt; same thing also acoustically identical.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Right.  You could say I consider a loophole in many people&apos;s<br/>&gt; though process is the idea that everything must aim for the ideal<br/>&gt; of being more or less &quot;acoustically identical&quot; to 12TET tones. For<br/>&gt; example 11/9: when I made a scale with it I was posed the question<br/>&gt; (paraphrased) &quot;is this supposed to be an E or a D#?!&quot;</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what you mean. The only thing that is acoustically<br/>identical to 12TET is 12TET itself.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;So the essential spirit that leads to tempering already exists in<br/>&gt; the minds of many strict JI composers too.&quot;<br/>&gt;      Then again, of course, 11/9 can be considered JI, but many<br/>&gt; people would avoid tones like that as they are of &quot;high limit&quot; (11,<br/>&gt; to be exact).<br/>&gt;     I guess you could say that&apos;s what I mean in a sense by &quot;strict-<br/>&gt; JI&quot; as well...the quest to keep low limits and the idea that only<br/>&gt; the lowest limits (particular 7 and under) consistute enough<br/>&gt; consonance to form &quot;resolved sounding&quot; chords.</p><p>What I mean by &quot;strict-JI&quot; is the practice that both melodic and<br/>harmonic intervals are derived from low-limit whole number ratios.<br/>But what is considered low-limit may vary, even from piece to piece<br/>by the same composer. In adaptive JI chords are just but melodic<br/>intervals may be tempered.</p><p>&gt;    A flip question becomes: why argue about a single &quot;fixed&quot; JI<br/>&gt; scale when you can just use adaptive JI to do &quot;perfect JI purity<br/>&gt; tempering&quot;?   I sure hope few people view adaptive JI with<br/>&gt; unnoticably small commatic melody movement as the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of<br/>&gt; tuning though...  Because then I fear once the &quot;purity equation&quot;<br/>&gt; problem is solved few of us would experiment with anything more<br/>&gt; complex than, say, a 7:8:9 chord IE other chords that yield more<br/>&gt; complex tonal colors.</p><p>I think we should separate the intonation and scale/structural<br/>issues. Now they are both under the broad category of tuning. I don&apos;t<br/>know if anyone disputes the datum that a scale and its&apos;<br/>intonation/tuning can be understood as different things. Some people<br/>here are only interested in the intonation of existing music like for<br/>example some of the 12-tone well temperament people, some are<br/>interested in new possible scales and structures that don&apos;t exist in<br/>12-tone tunings and some (like me) are interested about both in<br/>varying degrees.</p><p>Kalle Aho</p></div><h3><a id=86222 href="#86222">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2010 8:13:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The important thing to realize about both of these<br/>&gt; &gt; notations is that both of those notes are some kind of E.

This is true in<br/>pythagorean tuning. This thinking was inherited when triads started<br/>to be used. One thing that may also explain why we hear discriminable<br/>pitches as versions of the same note is that in diatonic context the<br/>syntonic comma is much smaller than seconds. If notes separated by<br/>syntonic comma were included in the scale separately as &quot;seconds&quot; the<br/>resulting scale would be improper. See</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothenberg_propriety">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothenberg_propriety</a></p><p>So if a scale is strictly proper, all thirds are larger than seconds,<br/>all fourths are larger than thirds and so on. I don&apos;t know how it is<br/>explained but supposedly some notes in improper scales are more<br/>likely heard as inflections than separate notes.</p><p>&gt; For the last few months my approach has been to try to &quot;separate&quot;<br/>&gt; those things in my mind. That being said -- the chord C-E-F#-B-D#<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t have the same harmonic properties as C-Eb-G, even though in<br/>&gt; 12-tet the D# and the Eb are identical. Because in the first chord,<br/>&gt; you hear the C-D# as a major third on top of a fifth on top of a<br/>&gt; major third -- or 75/32 -- but in the second chord, you hear the C-<br/>&gt; Eb as a minor third, or 6/5 (or 19/16 or whatever you&apos;d like).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s the difference? Well, one&apos;s called D#, and one&apos;s called Eb.<br/>&gt; But there is no diesis in 12-tet -- does that not reflect that<br/>&gt; people also hear those notes as the &quot;same thing?&quot; If not, where do<br/>&gt; you draw the line?</p><p>They have different names because notation is based on pythagorean<br/>and meantone, not 12-equal. I actually think that D# and Eb are<br/>melodically the same in 12-equal but the same note can have different<br/>harmonic functions in different contexts.</p><p>&gt; So I think that even in temperament you can distinguish underlying<br/>&gt; perceptual changes happening with the same notes... or discover new<br/>&gt; ways that existing notes can harmonically function.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; Of course, this personal view of mine makes perfect sense until you<br/>&gt; consider 12-tet comma pumps that sound perfectly natural, and I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not sure what&apos;s going on with that. Perhaps your brain switches its<br/>&gt; mode of placement for some tempered intervals around in retrospect,<br/>&gt; as the progression completes. Or perhaps it merges them together.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure.</p><p>I think they sound perfectly natural because, contra Marcel, our<br/>brain doesn&apos;t analyze music in terms of JI. Our mind doesn&apos;t<br/>recognize a tempered scale or some extra harmonic relation not<br/>existing in its&apos; JI version as some kind of unnatural perversion or<br/>illusion even if tempered intervals gain their resonance from their<br/>proximity to just intervals.</p><p>Kalle Aho</p></div><h3><a id=86225 href="#86225">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2010 8:44:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The important thing to realize about both of these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; notations is that both of those notes are some kind of E.

Not-very-periodic waveforms take a long time to repeat and if that length is greater than a 20th of a second or so (time resolution of human hearing, as exploited in the mp3 format) the brain requires extra effort to process it.&quot;<br/>   I could also add &quot;JI purity is &apos;tonal-ness&apos; because it insist all tones in a chord point to a root tone in a straight harmonic series, thus sharing difference tones that point to the root tone and make the consecutive dyads in the harmonic series beat at the same rate against each other.&quot;<br/>///////////////////////////////////<br/>   That the &quot;easy answer&quot;, in my book.  The hard question then becomes how much lack of periodicity really causes the brain to struggle...and in the same way how much roughness does...and, ultimately, what quantitative combinations of Periodicity+Roughness are possible in chords and scales while still feeling &quot;resolved&quot;. I&apos;d add the sensation of roughness is caused by the resolution of the basilar membrane in your ears.</p><p>    We have Plomp and Llevelt for roughness graphs and perhaps periodicity covered by Paul Erlich...it&apos;s about time someone made &quot;human tolerance for periodicity + roughness&quot; graphs that record the result of &quot;sum of the two theories&quot; and &quot;human tolerance for varying parameters of periodicity + roughness&quot;.

This<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; implies that they are also heard as versions of the same thing. So<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the essential spirit that leads to tempering already exists in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; minds of many strict JI composers too.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, but the question is -- why? Eb is also an E with an accidental,<br/>&gt; &gt; why is that different?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Standard notation doesn&apos;t distinguish between E, E- and E+.<br/>&gt; Accidentals are a feature of standard notation which is based on<br/>&gt; diatonic scale as naturals. No one thinks that E and Eb are somehow<br/>&gt; same. On the other hand, it is a defining feature of diatonic scale<br/>&gt; that four fifths makes a major third + two octaves. This is true in<br/>&gt; pythagorean tuning. This thinking was inherited when triads started<br/>&gt; to be used. One thing that may also explain why we hear discriminable<br/>&gt; pitches as versions of the same note is that in diatonic context the<br/>&gt; syntonic comma is much smaller than seconds. If notes separated by<br/>&gt; syntonic comma were included in the scale separately as &quot;seconds&quot; the<br/>&gt; resulting scale would be improper. See<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothenberg_propriety">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothenberg_propriety</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So if a scale is strictly proper, all thirds are larger than seconds,<br/>&gt; all fourths are larger than thirds and so on. I don&apos;t know how it is<br/>&gt; explained but supposedly some notes in improper scales are more<br/>&gt; likely heard as inflections than separate notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For the last few months my approach has been to try to &quot;separate&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; those things in my mind. That being said -- the chord C-E-F#-B-D#<br/>&gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t have the same harmonic properties as C-Eb-G, even though in<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-tet the D# and the Eb are identical. Because in the first chord,<br/>&gt; &gt; you hear the C-D# as a major third on top of a fifth on top of a<br/>&gt; &gt; major third -- or 75/32 -- but in the second chord, you hear the C-<br/>&gt; &gt; Eb as a minor third, or 6/5 (or 19/16 or whatever you&apos;d like).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What&apos;s the difference? Well, one&apos;s called D#, and one&apos;s called Eb.<br/>&gt; &gt; But there is no diesis in 12-tet -- does that not reflect that<br/>&gt; &gt; people also hear those notes as the &quot;same thing?&quot; If not, where do<br/>&gt; &gt; you draw the line?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They have different names because notation is based on pythagorean<br/>&gt; and meantone, not 12-equal. I actually think that D# and Eb are<br/>&gt; melodically the same in 12-equal but the same note can have different<br/>&gt; harmonic functions in different contexts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So I think that even in temperament you can distinguish underlying<br/>&gt; &gt; perceptual changes happening with the same notes... or discover new<br/>&gt; &gt; ways that existing notes can harmonically function.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Of course, this personal view of mine makes perfect sense until you<br/>&gt; &gt; consider 12-tet comma pumps that sound perfectly natural, and I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; not sure what&apos;s going on with that. Perhaps your brain switches its<br/>&gt; &gt; mode of placement for some tempered intervals around in retrospect,<br/>&gt; &gt; as the progression completes. Or perhaps it merges them together.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not sure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think they sound perfectly natural because, contra Marcel, our<br/>&gt; brain doesn&apos;t analyze music in terms of JI. Our mind doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; recognize a tempered scale or some extra harmonic relation not<br/>&gt; existing in its&apos; JI version as some kind of unnatural perversion or<br/>&gt; illusion even if tempered intervals gain their resonance from their<br/>&gt; proximity to just intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kalle Aho<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86233 href="#86233">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2010 10:27:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I like what I hear.

I&apos;ll leave it at this: I agree with many of the statements above, but believe they are incomplete parts of a larger picture defined by abstract psycho-acoustics and a certain degree of personal taste.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86239 href="#86239">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2010 11:13:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That&apos;s interesting!

In common practice music one of Hindemith&apos;s most consonant chords, an 027 (say, [low to high] G C D) is is always a dissonance and must resolve, with the C always resolving downwards.&nbsp; Any chord with tritones and half steps in Hindemiths system is automatically more dissonant that a chord lacking these intervals, yet a V m9 chord in minor, one of the most important chords in the harmonic syntax of late Romantic music. What is more, one can weave all sorts of non-chord tones that are more consonant with the bass than the m7 and m9, yet these will feel dissonant to this very dissonant chord.&nbsp; This is owing to the harmonic syntax and to contrapuntal expectations (the m9 will eventually resolve down by half step, but if the m9 is clearly the chord tone,&nbsp; a neighbor-tone M9 against the bass<br/> [i.e., a more consonant interval] will clearly be a non-chord tone).&nbsp; Another interesting case involves borrowed chords--bVI in a clearly-established major key is more consonant than the diatonic vi or diatonic ii7, etc., but will always sound somewhat foreign and connote the minor tonality (owing to the b3 and the b6-5 tendency). The Neapolitan chord in a minor key gives a little island of major, but it clearly sounds foreign to the key, especially in the older tunings.&nbsp; The&nbsp; historical derivations for the Np6 chord are from the minor iv chord, with the 5th raised to a m6.&nbsp; This was a standard tactic in figured bass practice, in which a triad (minor iv) was always considered more consonant than a sixth chord (Np6).&nbsp; Ergo, the Np6 was more dissonant than the minor iv; in addition, it required chromatic voice leading (b2-1-l.t.).&nbsp; So there are a lot more factors than harmonic sonority in play.</p><p>Some of you probably know Tenney&apos;s little book, A History of Consonance&apos; and<br/>&apos;Dissonance&apos;<br/>.&nbsp; It&apos;s a bit superficial, but it does show nicely how perceptions of consonance and dissonance have changed over the centuries.</p><p>Franklin</p><p>Dr. Franklin Cox</p><p>1107 Xenia Ave.</p><p>Yellow Springs, OH 45387</p><p>(937) 767-1165</p><p>franklincox@...</p><p>--- On Wed, 2/10/10, hpiinstruments &lt;aaronhunt@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: hpiinstruments &lt;aaronhunt@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: The point of temperament<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Wednesday, February 10, 2010, 9:39 PM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>      --- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, Michael</p><p>&lt;djtrancendance@ ...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;P.S. changing spectra to fit a tuning is an</p><p>&gt; &gt; example of using a principle of harmonic</p><p>&gt; &gt; correctness from JI.&quot;</p><p>&gt;      How so?

Couldn&apos;t someone have just as well learned, for example, that mean-tone is created by taking 1.5^x and then dividing by multiples of the octave and then learned JI to find the chords?</p><p>&gt;&quot;I would never properly understand how temperaments<br/>like hanson or semisixths work (or even Bohlen-Pierce) if I hadn&apos;t, prior to<br/>that, understood how mean-tone works.&quot;</p><p>   Let&apos;s start with BP since I haven&apos;t tried the other two temperaments yet.  I know BP uses the octave * a fifth AKA the &quot;tri-tave&quot; as it&apos;s period, aims to foremost align the odd harmonics rather than the even ones, and uses the 3/5/7 chord (rather than the 6/5/4 chord (noting 6/4 = 3/2) as with meantone) to generate itself and thus produces very pure &quot;thirds and fifths&quot;.  To me it seems like just a variation on meantone with the triad shifted to odd harmonics: very connected to history, but not really showing anything new far as psychoacoustics, higher-limit intervals...at least on the surface.  What is there that makes BP, Hanson...and other temperaments you say you learned well &quot;only&quot; because you learned meantone well first so special and new (at least so far...I&apos;m unconvinced you&apos;re doing much more than connecting historical tuning to only-slightly-less historical tuning)?</p><p>&gt;&quot;... And you want to tell me that the two groups of<br/>&quot;microtonalists&quot; have nothing in common?&quot;<br/>    I never said they had nothing in common...just very little.  Especially when it comes to how they go about making new scales or viewing why certain intervals &quot;work&quot; and psychoacoustics.  From what I&apos;ve heard from you in this e-mail, it sounds like you are focused mostly toward preserving the type of chords prominent in mean-tone (IE those with strong thirds and fifths) and slight variants of them such as those in BP.</p><p>   Part of it might be personallity too...to me BP is a historic scale and if it indeed has its roots in mean-tone that only seems to prove it moreso.  To me Just Intonation is modern, but only when used to create scale that break traditional scale limits IE have more than 2 step sizes, differ more than 10 cents from traditional mean-tone intervals, etc. ...otherwise it seems to always end up becoming some sort of Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>    One other observation...it seems those interested more in historical tunings obsess a bit about maintaining the purity of thirds and fifths (with Magic temperament, for example, concentrating on keeping the purity of thirds).

And one group focusses<br/>&gt; mostly on developing tunings for new songs while the other tries to<br/>&gt; re-tune existing ones.<br/>&gt; B) That some of us deal in making or designing micro-tonal<br/>&gt; instruments for both ET and non-ET scale...which is a similar<br/>&gt; mathematical challenge regardless of the tuning.<br/>&gt;    Feel free to give counter-examples, but I get the impression<br/>&gt; there is not much overlap and relatively few people from either of<br/>&gt; the two groups interested in much of what the other group has to<br/>&gt; say (which often degenerates into dogmatic arguments where each<br/>&gt; side &quot;knows they are right&quot; from the get go).

This is what makes 31-EDO interesting both from the historical and from the &quot;contemporary&quot; point of view. Someone may have discovered the meantone-like possibilities of 31-EDO back in the 16th century, but, OTOH, only towards the end of the 20th century, it became apparent that it can also do temperaments like miracle, mothra, orwell, myna, or w&uuml;rschmidt.</p><p>&gt; Couldn&apos;t someone have just as well learned, for example, that mean-tone is created<br/>&gt; by taking 1.5^x and then dividing by multiples of the octave and then learned JI to find the chords?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;m following you. You&apos;re swapping the order of events the other way round. We don&apos;t live in a 3-limit age anymore. If I only knew about Pythagorean tuning and nothing else in my life, maybe I wouldn&apos;t feel any need for tempering then, because I would treat C-E as a &quot;ditone&quot; (which has hte meaning of an unstable interval that should be resolved to something else) rather than a &quot;major third&quot; (which has the meaning of a stable interval because of its 5-limit origin). This is exactly what I was writing about in the document I uploaded yesterday.</p><p>&gt;   Let&apos;s start with BP since I haven&apos;t tried the other two temperaments yet.  I know BP uses<br/>&gt; the octave * a fifth AKA the &quot;tri-tave&quot; as it&apos;s period, aims to foremost align the odd harmonics<br/>&gt; rather than the even ones, and uses the 3/5/7 chord (rather than the 6/5/4 chord (noting 6/4 = 3/2)<br/>&gt; as with meantone) to generate itself and thus produces very pure &quot;thirds and fifths&quot;.  To me it seems<br/>&gt; like just a variation on meantone with the triad shifted to odd harmonics: very connected to history,<br/>&gt; but not really showing anything new far as psychoacoustics, higher-limit intervals...at least<br/>&gt; on the surface.  What is there that makes BP, Hanson...and other temperaments you say<br/>&gt; you learned well &quot;only&quot; because you learned meantone well first so special and new (at least<br/>&gt; so far...I&apos;m unconvinced you&apos;re doing much more than connecting historical tuning<br/>&gt; to only-slightly-less historical tuning)?<br/>I don&apos;t know what you want me to say. If I want to know why someone suggests 13 equal divisions of 3/1 (and not 12, for example), then I have to know answers for some questions regarding temperaments and what &quot;tempering&quot; means. If I want to know that, I have to find an example of tempering which is clear enough to me that I can say I&apos;ve understood the point. Trying to explain why the so-called &quot;BP diatonic scale&quot; can be described using pentachords without first knowing why meantone diatonic can be destribed using tetrachords is a bit like trying to solve logarithms without understanding powers and roots. The same goes for hanson or tetracot or semisixths, although these use a 2/1 octave as meantone does. Why do I get only two one-step sizes in an 11-tone scale of hanson (4 large + 7 small) while I get two one-step sizes in a 7-tone scale of meantone (5l + 2s)? Why does the first and last chord of some harmonic progressions sound the same in tetracot while ther&apos;yre not the same if I try to convert them to standard notation? Why can&apos;t I retune a piece from meantone to miracle just by tuning a 12-tone miracle scale on my keyboard and hearing what happens? Why is it impossible to retune a piece from meantone to miracle while it is possible to retune it from meantone to mavila? Why some harmonic progressions work well in porcupine while there&apos;s no equivalent for them in meantone? Well, it would be probably a few more words to read -- but if you really want, I can give you some example explanations how I found out about some temperaments (through understanding meantone) in the past.</p><p>&gt;    I never said they had nothing in common...just very little.  Especially when it comes to how they go<br/>&gt; about making new scales or viewing why certain intervals &quot;work&quot; and psychoacoustics.<br/>&gt;  From what I&apos;ve heard from you in this e-mail, it sounds like you are focused mostly toward<br/>&gt; preserving the type of chords prominent in mean-tone (IE those with strong thirds and fifths)<br/>&gt; and slight variants of them such as those in BP.</p><p>#1. Where do you find slight variants of thirds and fifths in BP? Isn&apos;t eventually each of us meaning different things by BP? Yes, fifths and thirds are the aim in temperaments like hanson or tetracot, but not in BP.</p><p>#2. In many cases, my aim was not to approximate only fifths and thirds, but generally chords with &quot;linearly equal&quot; frequency differences (as they exploit an audible amount of periodicity), the simplest of which is something like 3:4:5:6 if we want to include higher primes than 3. That&apos;s the main reason why I&apos;m so interested in the lots of 2D temperaments that have been discovered and classified less than 30 years ago. For the same reason, I was also interested to know more about BP because the &quot;original target&quot; of 3:5:7:9 not only exploits some periodicity but also offers a new &quot;general feeling&quot; of the chords because of the absence of even ratios. For the same reason, I&apos;m planning to make a piece of music in my &quot;Triharmonic scale&quot; from 2006 which approximates 4:7:10:13:16 (see message #75311 for details). But then there are exceptions, although not many. One of them is, of course, the &quot;Golden Spectrum&quot; scale which you can find in my folder at Tuning Files -- I think you&apos;ve actually heard my small improv in that scale when I recorded it a year ago.</p><p>&gt;   Part of it might be personallity too...to me BP is a historic scale<br/>&gt; and if it indeed has its roots in mean-tone that only seems to prove it moreso.</p><p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;roots in meantone&quot;.</p><p>&gt;  To me Just Intonation is modern, but only when used to create scale that break traditional<br/>&gt; scale limits IE have more than 2 step sizes, differ more than 10 cents from traditional mean-tone<br/>&gt; intervals, etc. ...otherwise it seems to always end up becoming some sort of Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>#1. Are you saying that any scale that has two one-step sizes and a period of 2/1 becomes &quot;some sort of Pythagorean tuning&quot;?</p><p>#2. If you really do see two one-step sizes as a limitation, then what about the 3D temperaments I was mentioning in some of my earlier messages? In April last year, I recorded a short improv in a 3D temperament whose aim was to approximate chords like 8:10:11:13:16 and it only tempered out 2200/2197 and nothing else. And even though, I wouldn&apos;t say that this temperament has nothing to do with historical temperaments. First of all, I would never understand 3D temperaments without knowing about 2D temperaments (one of which is meantone). And then, one of the approximated intervals is 5/4 which was a highly appreciated interval in earlier times as well.</p><p>&gt;    One other observation...it seems those interested more in historical tunings obsess a bit about<br/>&gt; maintaining the purity of thirds and fifths (with Magic temperament, for example, concentrating<br/>&gt; on keeping the purity of thirds).   What are your favorite counter-examples to this?</p><p>Again, I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;m following you. If you used pure thirds in magic, you would end up with pretty mistuned fifths (supposing we want pure octaves).</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=86269 href="#86269">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torsten.anders@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2010 7:31:48 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 11.02.2010, at 13:10, Petr Par&iacute;zek wrote:<br/>&gt; Someone may have discovered the meantone-like possibilities of 31-<br/>&gt; EDO back in the 16th century, but, OTOH, only towards the end of the<br/>&gt; 20th century, it became apparent that it can also do temperaments<br/>&gt; like miracle, mothra, orwell, myna, or w&uuml;rschmidt.</p><p>Please excuse my ignorance, but could you perhaps expand this remark a<br/>bit?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Best wishes,<br/>Torsten</p><p>--<br/>Torsten Anders<br/>Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>University of Plymouth<br/>Office: +44-1752-586219<br/>Private: +44-1752-558917<br/><a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/><a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a></p></div><h3><a id=86275 href="#86275">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2010 9:04:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron Hunt&gt;<br/>&quot;7ET certainly is related to a chain of pure fifths;<br/>a chain of pure fifths is at its heart - 3 tones its axis,<br/>5 tones approximating pentatonic give a default scale<br/>in 7ET.&quot;<br/>  If I have you right, you are saying 5 of the 7 tones approximate a chain of fifths.  So part of it is related to a chain of pure fifths.<br/>  So I can understand why a 5 tone scale under 7TET would be chain of fifth based, but not the entire 7 tones (which is what I was aiming at: using all 7 tones as a scale and not just a subset as a tuning).  If a 7 tone scale contained 5 of the 7 tones of diatonic JI would that alone necessarily make the whole scale a diatonic JI scale?  Not at all...  I think you are confusing the symptoms with the cause (IE 7TET used as a 7 note scale has symptoms/signs of a chain of 5ths but I&apos;m pretty sure is not a chain of 5ths).<br/>   Let me put it this way: can a chain of fifths and nothing but a chain of fifths build 7TET within 14 cents or less accuracy (AKA as accurately as 12TET)?</p><p>   This sounds to me like Pythagorus vs. Ptolemy: Pythagorus believe scales are exclusively related to chains of 5ths while Ptolemy said anything that can form tetrachords is fair game.  So far I&apos;m under the impression Ptolemy was the one seeing the forest and Pythagorus the trees: Magic temperament (chain of thirds) and Miracle (chain of seconds) being two obvious examples.<br/>-----------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt; The chain of<br/>&gt;&gt; pure-fifths seems to be a common and IMVHO a bit<br/>&gt;&gt; over-stated goal on this list...<br/>&gt;It&apos;s not a goal. It&apos;s a basic structure.</p><p>   Not a goal...in that case, how come you seem to pointing at that all things must be related to the circle of 5ths when many scales simply are not?  It seems clear to me the only reason why it would absolutely have to be a circle of 5ths would be that you choose it to be as such.  I don&apos;t know the name for it (if anyone knows the name for it, I would be very interested to learn)...but I&apos;m fairly sure someone must have based a scale on a chain of 7ths or even a chain of, say, 5th then 2nd then 5th....</p><p>&gt;&quot;Sure, that&apos;s a structure too, but a *less basic one* than the chain of fifths, unless you want to argue that 5 is less than 3?&quot;<br/>   Interesting, so you&apos;d argue a scale based on a chain of 7ths is more basic than the chain of fifths?  I&apos;ll admit that 2/1 is easier to make consonant than a 3/2 which is easier than a 4/3 and so on...but then what happens to, say, the purity of 2nds or 6ths?  I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a one way street...</p><p>&gt;&quot;Ask yourself the question: what is a tetrachord? Your answer points you back to the number 3.&quot;<br/>   Tetrachord = 4 note chord where the lowest and highest tones are 4/3 apart.  So the fraction has a denominator of three...but what does that have to do with your list of<br/>&gt; &gt; 1) - chain of pure fifths<br/>&gt; &gt; 2) - JI intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; 3) - ETs&quot;<br/>?<br/>   It seems to me that it points to JI and not at all the other two.  I can chain tetrachords on top on each other, but I can also say, make a chain with the second tetrachord starting on the third note of the first one rather than the fourth.  I&apos;ll gladly read your reference to Ptolemy...but even before that I&apos;ll note that, from what I&apos;ve seen of his scales, many to a fair extent very much disobey the circle of 5ths and, at least to my ear, actually sound more balanced than meantone ones (especially with regards to his clever avoidance of the IMVHO very hard to use in chords &quot;perfect&quot; minor second).</p><p>&gt;&quot;You can&apos;t escape these things. They seem to be too simple for you...&quot;<br/>   They are not &quot;too simple&quot; for me...it&apos;s just that reviewing a learning them mainly points me in the direction of making innovations that have already been made rather (or at best, slightly tweak them) than actually add much new.</p><p>  So I respect those simplicities, but there&apos;s a huge difference between respecting something as a valid way to do things and thinking they must be the &gt;only&lt; way to do things.  I never said anything like &quot;scales designed from chains of 5ths fail to do what they are designed to do well&quot;.  They do, and they are great for things like 5th (obviously), major 7ths, and triads.</p><p>    However so far I&apos;ve found if you want to do different things well, like make notes near (or between) minor seconds or major seconds starting with any root note in a scale sound resolved enough to work in chords...I&apos;ve seen you have to abandon the security of those constructs.  I&apos;ve asked people &quot;give me a meantone scale with the highest minimum purity&quot; and have heard 1/4 comma meantone, JI diatonic, and even a straight set of harmonic series partials as a scale, suggested a bunch of times.  I tried it, and the minor second still sounds rough enough to be unusable.  I&apos;ve tried Ptolemy Homalon scales and my own tempered variations on them to do the same thing and have had much better luck.</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>      I guess that&apos;s my &quot;problem&quot;.  On one hand don&apos;t get me wrong: I understand how things like meantone work and see things like the circle of 5ths and 4ths and why they are valid for the kind of consonances composers normally see as thesible (IE fairly widely spaced ones).  On the other hand I ask myself &quot;why not try for something that compromises perfect periodicity for better/less roughness...rather than stay around the same range for both by following things like using exclusively JI ratios within exclusively mean-tone-like tunings or TET approximations of them&quot;?</p></div><h3><a id=86276 href="#86276">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2010 10:24:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t understand this question. Seconds are already intervals, so<br/>what are intervals between them? &quot;</p><p>     Well, say our minor second is 15:14 and our major is 9/8.<br/>Now try 12/11.  That&apos;s an in-between ratio used in Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon scales that I often experiment with tempering for my own scales.  I ran into it myself upon experimentation, but Jacques reminded me that<br/>A) It already was used by Ptolemy in some of his scales<br/>B) Ptolemy&apos;s scales are among his favorites (and I can see why)</p><p>     And, while it&apos;s obviously not so pure as 9/8...it (at least to my ears) strikes a much better balance of periodicity and roughness than 15/14 and just plain old sounds better in chords as a more-resolved substitute for a minor second.<br/>    This is the kind of thing I&apos;m talking about when I say non-standard interval sizes.<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;Why can&apos;t seconds be used in chords? They are used all the time in<br/>music. What&apos;s the problem?&quot;<br/>   Really the minor seconds and anything too close to them.  Say the &quot;chord&quot; C C# G.  I&apos;ve found most people will jump at the C# as sounding too rough and most composers will jump as say &quot;you can&apos;t use a minor second in a held/&quot;rest&quot; chord...it&apos;s a neighboring tone; hit it quickly and then quickly resolve it with a clearer chord...learn your music theory&quot;.<br/>   Meanwhile, sure, I&apos;ve heard C D E G AKA C add2 used a lot...no problem with that.  It&apos;s the &quot;dark&quot; area of the minor second that bugs me.  Again (at least to me) something in-between the second and minor second is &quot;close enough&quot;.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;I didn&apos;t say it&apos;s hideous. I just said you&apos;re obviously obsessed. :D&quot;<br/>   True enough.  I tend to gravitate toward things I see hints could be done without too much trouble...but barely (if at all) see anyone working on.<br/>  I don&apos;t disrespect what others are working on, I just figure (at least for now) while everyone else is figuring out great ways to purify their 3rds, 5ths, 7ths....I might as well see what happens if I do something like try and purify something that can be used a bit like what it seems nearly everyone thinks is the nastiest interval, the minor second.<br/>  And, as a plus, try to do so without making the other intervals sound intolerably sour...that&apos;s kind of what I mean by the whole &quot;chord-scale&quot; obsession where virtually any combination of notes can make a fairly consonant chord.  I also figure that trying to &quot;knock through that wall&quot; could (no guarantees but it would be nice) lead me to some sort of &quot;loophole&quot; in psycho-acoustic theory that allows all sorts of new chord combinations with more closely spaced notes.  I think it has just become a dogmatic limitation among composers that close notes in chords must only mean atonal or &quot;accidental&quot;.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;It seems to me that whether c c# d# can sound at least nice (if not resolved) depends more on the musical context than tuning. Those kind<br/>of sonorities are favoured by atonal composers and in that context they don&apos;t demand resolution.  &quot;<br/>   True, but I figured it would be nice to open chords a bit like that to a non-atonal audience.  Sure, as stands, they have their values in uniqueness...but I think it would be fun to see what musicians would try to do if they found a way to use a chord with a similar feel as a point of resolution.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;You must mean detuning because tempering harmonic series segments<br/>makes no sense to me. Detuning and temperament are not the same<br/>thing.&quot;<br/>    Please explain.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_temperament">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_temperament</a> says &quot;to intentionally choose an interval with beating as a substitute for a just interval is the act of tempering that interval.&quot;  Does the proper term temperament have to exclusively deal with tempering out commas/schismas...in &quot;chain of xths&quot; generated scales to make octaves/tritaves/etc. match the chain or making a chain of multiple to approximate a scale (IE 12TET being tempered from meantone)?  If it&apos;s anything like that...yes I mean &quot;de-tuning&quot; and not temperament.</p><p>   Personally I &quot;de-tune&quot; simply as a means to balance between periodicity and roughness and reduce each to a tolerable amount. IE if two tones are too close, de-tune them to decrease roughness...if a tone is periodic with the tone next to it but not very much so with the tone two notes below it, de-tune it closer to a pure-JI ratio with the note two-tones below it a bit (but not so much it loses too much periodicity with regards to the note next to it.<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt;    One way I think of it is that a 2:3:4 chord can sound vastly<br/>&gt;&gt; different depending on a different root pitch or even just a little<br/>&gt;&gt; bit of &quot;bending&quot; of any tone in the chord.<br/>&gt;That&apos;s a bit vague but maybe you just mean the chord&apos;s overall timbre?<br/>Yes, that&apos;s a fair way to say it. :-)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t believe in &quot;a chord is perfectly pure or it&apos;s just a poor<br/>&gt;&gt; imitation of perfectly pure&quot;...though I will agree too far from<br/>&gt;&gt; pure can cause some nasty lack-of-periodicity issues.<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t know if anyone thinks that even a tiny deviation from pure<br/>&gt;is a poor imitation.<br/>Fair enough...I was going a bit on a ledge as it sounded like you were saying &quot;chords have to be a &gt;perfect&lt; straight series AKA 4/4 5/4 6/4 (4:5:6), that&apos;s the only way to do make them&quot; and I was quite eager to say &quot;no, some deviation is legal&quot;.<br/>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;Unless you have faulty speakers there is no harmonic distortion.<br/>Harmonic distortion happens when poor quality electronic equipment<br/>adds harmonics to sine waves. What you hear is something else, maybe<br/>periodicity buzz.  &quot;<br/>   I&apos;ve heard the terms used interchangably but yes, you&apos;re right, I meant periodicity buzz and I&apos;ll exclusively use that term in the future.<br/>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Feel free to start your own group where you can sensor any<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; discussions that don&apos;t cater to your singular interests.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;     I have never tried to censor anyone or say &quot;stop talking&quot; in<br/>&gt;&gt; any form...how are you coming to the conclusion I am?<br/>&gt;I am not coming to such a conclusion, you are putting words into my<br/>&gt;mouth.<br/>   Well you were at least hinting &quot;Feel free to start your own group where you can sensor any discussions&quot; as if I would somehow find that an attractive option.  My somehow finding that an attractive option would imply I may well &gt;enjoy&lt; censoring others.  So I think it&apos;s fair to say that comment you made was targetted as an indirect insult to me, which is why I jumped at it.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;What makes you think that the interests could be divided in exactly two groups? As how you answered to Petr you seem to think that even<br/>such a xenharmonic scale as BP is &quot;traditional&quot; . I wonder how many people would be qualified for the &quot;progressive&quot; group.&quot;</p><p>    I don&apos;t think it&apos;s about being &apos;qualified&apos; so much as it is being tolerant.  I usually get the same 5 or so answers for everything a bring up here (and often delivered in an almost angry fashion), including but not limited to<br/>1) Use mean-tone (particularly 1/4 comma), diatonic JI, 53TET, or a straight set of partials harmonic series to get maximum average consonance...you&apos;re a bit crazy for thinking there might be another option for optimizing consonance.<br/>2) Consonance is based only on periodicity and its close cousin tonallity, you won&apos;t get a serious answer on any other type of experimental optimization (IE roughness, difference tone patterns, timbre...)<br/>3) All consonant chords must be based on only very low integer ratios...anything like 11-limit JI is a bit crazy...stick with 7-limit or less.  It follows &quot;forget about making scales with a ratio between a major and minor second/third/etc.&quot;...people give me weird responses when I say I&apos;m going for something inbetween two widely accepted ratios.<br/>4)  There is no way any sort of irrational ratio can feel consonant...stop experimenting with 1+(1/sqrt(2))^x, 1 + (1/PHI)^x, 1 + (1/any other irrational)^x as generators.<br/>5)  If you want big chords and large scales, try octatonic scales of 22TET (for the record, I really like 22TET on the whole, just not for close-ratio chords).</p><p>    Sethares (who pretty much sparked my interest in micro-tonallity) left this list.  So did Rick Ballan over his GCD theories (which I still see promise in).  Sevish (who I work with a lot) has not been on nearly as often and didn&apos;t seem too happy about the JI-or-nothing attitude floating around so far as I can tell.  Charles Lucy and Marcel get constant heat...and is it really that much of an issue if they are right or not when they aren&apos;t telling people what to do and not to do by any means?  Is it really worth all the ego battling for &quot;academic correctness&quot;?...and what if someone successfully finds something that improves on what was academically correct before: is it really that crazy?</p><p>    Maybe (in fact, quite likely) there are only a few out of hundred people on here who give a ---- about what I&apos;m trying to shoot for.  And that&apos;s fine: I never said I expected any sort of fan club and I know what I&apos;ve been doing musically is incredibly odd.

They do, and they are great for things<br/>&gt; like 5th (obviously), major 7ths, and triads.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     However so far I&apos;ve found if you want to do<br/>&gt; different things well, like make notes near<br/>&gt; (or between) minor seconds or major seconds<br/>&gt; starting with any root note in a scale sound<br/>&gt; resolved enough to work in chords...I&apos;ve seen<br/>&gt; you have to abandon the security of those<br/>&gt; constructs.</p><p>Yes, see what you get when you &quot;abandon the security<br/>of those constructs&quot;. The simplicities that emerge<br/>from whatever you do will relate back to those very<br/>things you think you are escaping. I *never said*<br/>you have to use those constructs to build whatever<br/>it is you want to build.</p><p>&gt;       I guess that&apos;s my &quot;problem&quot;.  On one hand<br/>&gt; don&apos;t get me wrong: I understand how things<br/>&gt; like meantone work and see things like the<br/>&gt; circle of 5ths and 4ths and why they are valid<br/>&gt; for the kind of consonances composers<br/>&gt; normally see as thesible (IE fairly widely spaced<br/>&gt; ones).  On the other hand I ask myself &quot;why<br/>&gt; not try for something that compromises perfect<br/>&gt; periodicity for better/less roughness...rather<br/>&gt; than stay around the same range for both by<br/>&gt; following things like using exclusively JI ratios<br/>&gt; within exclusively mean-tone-like tunings or<br/>&gt; TET approximations of them&quot;?</p><p>By all means, go for it.</p><p>I&apos;ll not be discussing these things with you any<br/>further, Michael. I hope you have understood the<br/>point. If you haven&apos;t, then fault me for being a<br/>bad teacher. If you do get it and just don&apos;t like it,<br/>that&apos;s fine. I&apos;ve presented the ideas here as clearly as I<br/>can. They are not my ideas per se. Those things<br/>have been said before by many, many people; I was<br/>merely summarizing.</p><p>My contribution to this topic ends here.</p><p>Some words of advice: read what you respond to<br/>more carefully, and when you paraphrase, be careful<br/>not to change meanings, and avoid being emphatic.</p><p>I sincerely wish you good luck with your innovations.</p><p>Yours,<br/>AAH<br/>=====</p></div><h3><a id=86283 href="#86283">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2010 12:47:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;We don&rsquo;t live in a 3-limit age anymore. If I only knew about Pythagorean<br/>tuning&quot;<br/>    I was not talking about Pythagorean tuning, but about mean-tone...and I was talking about how a scale are generated, not how certain intervals in the scale are/were used composition-wise at the time the scale was derived.  I think this is a common problem when I write something in the context of generating a tuning and someone follows up with a point about compositional practice throughout history.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Well, it would be<br/>probably a few more words to read -- but if you really want, I can give you some<br/>example explanations how I found out about some temperaments (through<br/>understanding mean-tone) in the past.&quot;<br/>  I am interested in how you found out how to do miracle temperament via mean-tone, since miracle involves generation via chaining of seconds and, at first glance, you would think they have little in common (plus I am admittedly interested in the art of purifying seconds and minor-seconds since so many musicians consider them as a-tonal for use in chords).</p><p>&gt;&quot;#1.<br/>Where do you find slight variants of thirds and fifths in BP? Isn&rsquo;t eventually<br/>each of us meaning different things by BP? Yes, fifths and thirds are the aim in<br/>temperaments like hanson or tetracot, but not in BP.&quot;<br/>     I was wrong, I assumed thirds were strong since BP is built from the 3:5:7 chord that it optimized the third at 7/3.  It is indeed a lot newer than I gave it credit for, in some sense.  Counter question, what are some temperaments you know (other than Miracle) which focus on optimizing intervals other than 3rds, 4ths, and 5ths?</p><p>&gt;&quot;#2.<br/>In many cases, my aim was not to approximate only fifths and thirds, but<br/>generally chords with &bdquo;linearly equal&ldquo; frequency differences (as they exploit an<br/>audible amount of periodicity) , the simplest of which is something like 3:4:5:6<br/>if we want to include higher primes than 3.&quot;<br/>     Isn&apos;t this basically scales that involves the chaining of four note chords (and not just tetra-chords)?  If so, I&apos;m all for you on that one...although I typically find myself messing with tetra-chords all the way up to about 8:9:10:11 on the series and ones with spaces in between steps up to more like 10:11:16:18.  Oddly enough, Ptolemy did a lot with ratios like 12/11...but I don&apos;t hear many people talking about him.</p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>Part of it might be personality too...to me BP is a historic scale<br/>&gt;&gt; and<br/>if it indeed has its roots in mean-tone that only seems to prove it<br/>moreso.<br/>&gt;Depends<br/>on what you mean by &bdquo;roots in meantone&ldquo;.<br/>     Well let&apos;s start with this: how did you learn BP from meantone?   So far I have the impression that the common thread is chaining chords together...which I think is a smart way to design scales, but doesn&apos;t seem to me to have its roots in music history.</p><p>&gt;&quot;#1.<br/>Are you saying that any scale that has two one-step sizes and a period of 2/1<br/>becomes &bdquo;some sort of Pythagorean tuning&ldquo;?&quot;<br/>    No, the point of similarity to me has to do with using either a chain of 5ths or approximated 5ths to generate a scale.</p><p>&gt;&quot;the &bdquo;Golden Spectrum&ldquo; scale&quot;<br/>     Which is also based on a &quot;chain of x&quot; generator (chain of PHI^x/2^y, to be exact) as I understand it...kind of like my first PHI-based scales before I started using 1+(1/PHI)^x to split the notes into golden sections...isn&apos;t it?</p><p>    Here a some for you...<br/>   1) What temperaments do you know which are not based on some sort of &quot;chain of x interval&quot; algorithm or a close approximation of one?<br/>   2) How does mean-tone theory apply to those?</p><p>&gt;&quot;#2.<br/>If you really do see two one-step sizes as a limitation, then what about the 3D<br/>temperaments I was mentioning in some of my earlier messages? In April last<br/>year, I recorded a short improv in a 3D temperament whose aim was to approximate<br/>chords like 8:10:11:13:16&quot;<br/>    Now that does sound really interesting...my knowledge honestly probably wasn&apos;t up to stuff at the time you posted those.  I&apos;m a huge fan of scales that can manage step sizes down to about 11/10 (actually &quot;all the way&quot; up to closeness of about 12/11) and still sound fairly resolved.  I&apos;m also great believer in any sort of experiment that uses harmonics from the harmonic series up to 20 yet spaces them in a way that controls tonal roughness reasonably.  I will admit, from what I&apos;ve heard of 2-tone MOS that theory of scale generation seems a bit limited to me...going 3D (AKA hyper-MOS, right?) sounds quite interesting.</p><p>    If you can put together some links to posts as to how you derived such 3D temperaments, I&apos;d be happy to read about them.  I think I&apos;ve run into a few simply by stacking 4-note chords using some fairly high-limit ratios, but admittedly did so by experimentation rather than knowing the inner workings of how to &quot;run a 3D temperament generator&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt; maintaining the purity of thirds and fifths (with<br/>Magic temperament, for example, concentrating<br/>&gt;&gt; on keeping the purity of<br/>thirds).   What are your favorite counter-examples to<br/>this?<br/>&gt;Again,<br/>I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m following you. If you used pure thirds in magic, you would<br/>end up with pretty mistuned fifths (supposing we want pure<br/>octaves).<br/>    Well I said &quot;with<br/>Magic temperament, for example, concentrating on keeping the purity of<br/>thirds&quot;...I was trying to say Magic is fairly common and purifies thirds while other relatively common tunings (namely mean-tone) purify 5ths...I didn&apos;t say or mean &quot;Magic purifies 3rds and fifths&quot;.  It makes perfect sense to me that Magic purifies thirds at the expense of 5ths.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=86285 href="#86285">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2010 1:26:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Halfsteps and wholesteps of the diatonic naturals can be collapsed into a single step size,<br/>resulting in 7 Tone Equal Temperament, 7ET.&quot;<br/>    Hmm...ok.  As I understand it you assume the 7TET step size can be &quot;heard&quot; as a major or minor second and is in-between both tones...almost as if to say anything right in between two diatonic tones is &quot;heard&quot; as either one of those diatonic tones but not it&apos;s own entity...which I&apos;m hard-pressed to believe.  As I understand it, it sounds like a bit of a forced dogma.</p><p>&gt; &gt;5 tones approximating pentatonic give a default scale<br/>&gt; &gt;in 7ET.&quot;<br/>   Yes and it seems clear from what you said that&apos;s 5 tones, not the entire 7 in 7TET.  I&apos;m assuming all 7 tones are used as the scale, not just 5...proving 5 are related does not prove 7 are; scale is not equal to tuning (and Lord knows how many threads there have been on this board about scale/tuning confusion).</p><p>&gt;&quot;Again, if you want to say something about Greek music theory, then first learn something substantial about it.&quot;<br/>    Did you ever think that just maybe I have composed with and learned about Ptolemy&apos;s scales?  I have.  The inconvenient truth is I haven&apos;t read anything about his Homalon or &quot;smooth&quot; scales having anything to do directly with meantone.  Those scales are based on tetrachords of 9:10:11:12 and are very evenly spaced, much more so than anything I&apos;ve heard under low-limit JI.  What I don&apos;t know much about is specfics about Pythagorean music theory...to be honest, I&apos;m not overly interested in the details of it because it is simply a chain of fifth&apos;s (with no tempering to make it match the octave, unlike mean-tone).</p><p>&gt;&quot;Some words of advice: read what you respond to more carefully, and when you paraphrase, be careful<br/>not to change meanings, and avoid being emphatic.&quot;<br/>    I guess you could say it&apos;s time simply to hand this one over to the list and see what they thinl.  I get a strong impression that even when I listen to you, you assume I am not listening mostly because I don&apos;t agree with you that it&apos;s the only way to do things...and that you were being at least as emphatic as myself if not more.</p><p>   Perhaps I&apos;m the opposite, if someone tells me there&apos;s only one way to do things I look for many types of proof before I agree.  For the longest time I though music was limited by the periodicity of the harmonic series and 12TET was the ultimate compromise for that back in music school when they talked about basic frequency ratios.   Then Sethares showed me it could be otherwise with his roughness/critical-band-based theories and brought me into being interested in microtonallity and bound it with my interest in psychoacoustics I already had from DSP programming.  So if I&apos;m really skeptical when someone seems to tell me everything is based on some construct that seems to be solely based on generating periodicity, don&apos;t take it personally.</p></div><h3><a id=86297 href="#86297">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2010 3:17:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;I don&apos;t understand this question.

I usually get the same 5 or so answers for<br/>&gt; everything a bring up here (and often delivered in an almost angry<br/>&gt; fashion), including but not limited to<br/>&gt; 1) Use mean-tone (particularly 1/4 comma), diatonic JI, 53TET, or a<br/>&gt; straight set of partials harmonic series to get maximum average<br/>&gt; consonance...you&apos;re a bit crazy for thinking there might be another<br/>&gt; option for optimizing consonance.<br/>&gt; 2) Consonance is based only on periodicity and its close cousin<br/>&gt; tonallity, you won&apos;t get a serious answer on any other type of<br/>&gt; experimental optimization (IE roughness, difference tone patterns,<br/>&gt; timbre...)<br/>&gt; 3) All consonant chords must be based on only very low integer<br/>&gt; ratios...anything like 11-limit JI is a bit crazy...stick with<br/>&gt; 7-limit or less.  It follows &quot;forget about making scales with a<br/>&gt; ratio between a major and minor second/third/etc.&quot;...people give me<br/>&gt; weird responses when I say I&apos;m going for something inbetween two<br/>&gt; widely accepted ratios.<br/>&gt; 4)  There is no way any sort of irrational ratio can feel<br/>&gt; consonant...stop experimenting with 1+(1/sqrt(2))^x, 1 + (1/PHI)^x,<br/>&gt; 1 + (1/any other irrational)^x as generators.<br/>&gt; 5)  If you want big chords and large scales, try octatonic scales<br/>&gt; of 22TET (for the record, I really like 22TET on the whole, just<br/>&gt; not for close-ratio chords).</p><p>11-limit is not generally considered crazy, there is healthy interest<br/>in it.

Some rules I follow though:</p><p>I have heard a lot of great music from a lot of great composers on<br/>here, and a lot of it has given me a lot of ideas. But I have yet to<br/>hear the masterpiece that fluidly ties it all together though. AKJ,<br/>Neil Haverstick, GWS have all written at pieces in which I started to<br/>see the very large picture at how 7-limit harmony could really work,<br/>but I have yet to assimilate it myself.</p><p>5-limit harmony is so intuitive to me that I don&apos;t even have to think<br/>about it. As an improvisational musician, that&apos;s pretty much my goal.<br/>7-limit harmony I can safely say I&apos;m useless with, except for just<br/>throwing in a few cool chord ideas.</p><p>&gt; - Practice.</p><p>And now we&apos;re at main problem #1, which is I have no instrument :)<br/>Using eastwest with 6 detuned channels to get in 72tet is also pretty<br/>inefficient.</p><p>&gt;//snip<br/>&gt; - Progress with stepwise contrary motion. (Schulter)</p><p>BTW, are there any examples of Margo&apos;s work online? I&apos;ve heard a lot<br/>about her stuff, and the way she talks about this sounds like her work<br/>is exactly what I need to hear.</p><p>&gt; - Introduce the 7-limit as a dissonance, and resolve it. It will<br/>&gt; sound strange first time. Tell your listeners you know what you&apos;re<br/>&gt; doing.</p><p>I have heard a grand total of one piece in which the 7-limit sounded<br/>completely natural the first time I heard it - AKJ&apos;s &quot;melancholic.&quot; I<br/>still don&apos;t know how he did it so effectively there - other pieces I<br/>had to listen a few times before it started to sound natural.</p><p>Of course, now that I&apos;ve said this, I&apos;m going to remember some other<br/>piece, but I can&apos;t right now. Don&apos;t be mad at me other composers, now<br/>I&apos;m on the spot!</p><p>&gt; - Take 5-limit chords, add higher limit notes, and take the root away.<br/>&gt; That shows the logic behind a strange chord. Reverse the process for<br/>&gt; a strong resolution.</p><p>That might be why.</p><p>&gt; - A 4:5:6 can already sound wrong as the 5 is flatter than expected.<br/>&gt; Sharp is better than flat.</p><p>This is something I&apos;ve noticed as well, and I have no idea why. I<br/>think it might have to do with how we tend to overestimate the size of<br/>an octave with pure tones and such.</p><p>&gt; My favorite 7-limit trick: resolve 6:7:8 to 4:5:6 with the middle<br/>&gt; note held constant.</p><p>Yes, tricks! Tricks are what I need.</p><p>A trick of my own: take the following chord structure: E- F C D G</p><p>and play it over a C. Sounds great. Now move it up a third - still<br/>sounds good. Now move it another minor third up so it&apos;s over the fifth<br/>- still sounds amazing. Now go 7/6 up from that and blast off.</p><p>So if you notice what I&apos;m doing, I&apos;m transposing it so that the &quot;C&quot; in<br/>the middle of that chord structure moves to different otonal ratios.<br/>First do it with C, then E- (G#-- A- E- F#- B) then with G, then with<br/>Bb&lt;, etc.</p><p>Long story short, once you get to 11:4, rumor has it that your brain<br/>will actually melt right out of your ears. Flipping back and forth<br/>between 11:4 and 13:4 is the most heavenly sound on planet earth.

Written by a certain person named Anonymus, and full<br/>&gt; of errors and strange statements. Only trustful sources are some<br/>&gt; facts, but explanations and interpretations not always...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I see it like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Polymodal chromaticism doesn&apos;t exist, both terms just describe two<br/>&gt; different approaches to music.</p><p>I don&apos;t really know anything about it. I just threw something in based<br/>on what I&apos;d heard and read. Clearly someone thinks it&apos;s real. Doesn&apos;t<br/>bother me.</p><p>&gt; - Of course if we superimpose, combine two or more modes or scales<br/>&gt; which have less tones then 12, we can get the chromatic scale in the<br/>&gt; result. But in such polymodal works composer doesn&apos;t use<br/>&gt; chromaticism, he works with modes. Chromaticism is more or less<br/>&gt; latent and can be avoided. Even dissonances and chromatic seconds can<br/>&gt; be avoided with careful composing method. I wouldn&apos;t talk in this<br/>&gt; case about chromaticism.</p><p>I&apos;m not just superimposing two random modes. I took a sound I was<br/>hearing and fleshed it out, and to my surprised it turned out to yield<br/>every note of the chromatic scale functionally. This isn&apos;t that<br/>unbelievable.</p><p>If you were to intonate this chromatic scale with JI, it would have a<br/>different tuning than the usual 5-limit chromatic scale. There&apos;d also<br/>be a bunch of comma-shifted versions of the same note in there too.</p><p>&gt; - Chromatic scale is a chromatic scale. Nothing else. To describe it<br/>&gt; as &quot;12-tone polymode&quot; just because it was a result from combining two<br/>&gt; or mode modes is really unnecessary.</p><p>Yes, but in the case of my scale - it&apos;s hardly &quot;chromatic&quot; in the<br/>traditional sense, short of that it has 12 notes. Every note in that<br/>scale can be used simultaneously. It&apos;s a sound I was hearing in my<br/>head that I fleshed out; it really does stretch the meantone thing to<br/>it&apos;s limit.</p><p>Viewed in a JI context, with the root as C, it goes two steps out into<br/>the 5-axis (G#), and then a fifth over (so from C-D#). Then it goes<br/>another fifth over to A#. The C# can be viewed as a fifth below 25/16,<br/>or as a 135/128 over C, or as a 17/16 over C, and I will conceptually<br/>use all of those and mix them together. The D# can also be a 19/16.<br/>It&apos;s almost 7 AM and I&apos;m way too tired to do the math now, but that<br/>corresponds to some linear temperament, I am sure - a linear 19-limit<br/>non-7 non-11 non-13 temperament.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>&gt; Just my opinion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Forr&oacute;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86302 href="#86302">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2010 4:20:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Everything you just said is exactly why I think the word &quot;consonance&quot;<br/>should be considered a profanity around here. There are so many<br/>meanings for the word that roughly 2/3 of conversations about it<br/>degenerate into semantic disagreements within 10 or so posts.</p><p>There are many legitimate musical phenomena that go into the<br/>perception of a chord:</p><p>- Its overall harmonicity and intonation<br/>- The interaction between any and all of the multiplicity of harmonic<br/>relationships perceived in the chord<br/>- Critical band factors, roughness, beating<br/>- Whether you&apos;ve been writing a pleasant song in major the whole time<br/>and then throw 4:5:6:7:9:11 in over the I chord out of nowhere<br/>- Whether the high priest at your monestary thinks that the tritone is<br/>the devil&apos;s interval<br/>- Whether a certain chord reminds you of that one time your girlfriend<br/>broke up with you while you were doing your taxes</p><p>I don&apos;t think a single qualitative dimension of &quot;consonance&quot; can<br/>really describe whether random listener X will end up &quot;liking&quot; the<br/>sound of a chord at the end of the day. That being said, the first<br/>three things I mentioned are actual psychoacoustic principles that<br/>have at least some reasonable tangible component to them, and I just<br/>prefer to think of them as completely separate things that sometimes<br/>overlap. The fourth likely has some kind of psychoacoustic basis<br/>behind it as well, despite its usually being considered a cultural<br/>thing, but I have no idea how to even start analyzing that.</p><p>We prioritize those things differently: For me #1 and #2 are about<br/>equal, and #3 I don&apos;t even care about. Those around here who are<br/>accustomed to tunings without the crystal clear pure fifths of<br/>12-equal care in the order of #2, #1, and #3, I think. And Michael<br/>Sheiman for some reason seems to care in the order of #3, #2, and #1.</p><p>In my view, just disregarding all that to pretend that a single<br/>dimension of &quot;consonance&quot; can handle all of this really makes no<br/>sense, although it can be kind of useful as a rough rule of thumb or<br/>something.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Wed, Feb 10, 2010 at 5:07 PM, Cox Franklin &lt;<a href="mailto:franklincox@yahoo.com">franklincox@yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Responding to Michael:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m convinced something that would cover the<br/>&gt; &gt; entire gammut would explain<br/>&gt; &gt; A) where consonance becomes dissonance<br/>&gt; &gt; (roughness wise...for example with regard to<br/>&gt; &gt; consecutive sine tones played in TET tunings)<br/>&gt; &gt; B) where consonance becomes dissonance<br/>&gt; &gt; (periodicity/ &quot;JI&quot; wise)<br/>&gt; &gt; C) If a chord meets A and B (is consonant<br/>&gt; &gt; according to A and B) yet somehow sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonant, why does it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One of the problems I see in this is that it leaves harmonic/contrapuntal function and historical changes in perception of consonance/dissonance out of the equation. In common practice music one of Hindemith&apos;s most consonant chords, an 027 (say, [low to high] G C D) is is always a dissonance and must resolve, with the C always resolving downwards.&nbsp; Any chord with tritones and half steps in Hindemiths system is automatically more dissonant that a chord lacking these intervals, yet a V m9 chord in minor, one of the most important chords in the harmonic syntax of late Romantic music. What is more, one can weave all sorts of non-chord tones that are more consonant with the bass than the m7 and m9, yet these will feel dissonant to this very dissonant chord.&nbsp; This is owing to the harmonic syntax and to contrapuntal expectations (the m9 will eventually resolve down by half step, but if the m9 is clearly the chord tone,&nbsp; a neighbor-tone M9 against the bass [i.e., a more consonant interval] will clearly be a non-chord tone).&nbsp; Another interesting case involves borrowed chords--bVI in a clearly-established major key is more consonant than the diatonic vi or diatonic ii7, etc., but will always sound somewhat foreign and connote the minor tonality (owing to the b3 and the b6-5 tendency). The Neapolitan chord in a minor key gives a little island of major, but it clearly sounds foreign to the key, especially in the older tunings.&nbsp; The&nbsp; historical derivations for the Np6 chord are from the minor iv chord, with the 5th raised to a m6.&nbsp; This was a standard tactic in figured bass practice, in which a triad (minor iv) was always considered more consonant than a sixth chord (Np6).&nbsp; Ergo, the Np6 was more dissonant than the minor iv; in addition, it required chromatic voice leading (b2-1-l.t.).&nbsp; So there are a lot more factors than harmonic sonority in play.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some of you probably know Tenney&apos;s little book, A History of Consonance&apos; and &apos;Dissonance&apos; .&nbsp; It&apos;s a bit superficial, but it does show nicely how perceptions of consonance and dissonance have changed over the centuries.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Franklin<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dr. Franklin Cox<br/>&gt; 1107 Xenia Ave.<br/>&gt; Yellow Springs, OH 45387<br/>&gt; (937) 767-1165<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:franklincox@yahoo.com">franklincox@yahoo.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- On Wed, 2/10/10, hpiinstruments &lt;aaronhunt@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From: hpiinstruments &lt;aaronhunt@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: The point of temperament<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Date: Wednesday, February 10, 2010, 9:39 PM<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, Michael<br/>&gt; &lt;djtrancendance@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;P.S. changing spectra to fit a tuning is an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; example of using a principle of harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; correctness from JI.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; How so?

And presumably one<br/>&gt; day the Bach of xenharmony will arrive, and we will get a<br/>&gt; genre where 81/80 (or some other comma that vanishes in 12)<br/>&gt; becomes commonly heard as chromatic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is what I feel as well.

We hear frequency<br/>ratios between sounds by having auditory experiences of pitches<br/>separated by intervals so that there is a regular causal connection<br/>between a frequency ratio and the type of experience it produces in<br/>us. That is, the same frequency ratio always produces the same type<br/>of interval experience in us no matter what the pitches are (this<br/>somewhat breaks down at very high registers) and this regular<br/>connection gives us the ability to perceive frequency ratios.</p><p>It is true that low-numbered integer ratios are perceived as<br/>special with exactly harmonic sounds and this is explained by<br/>psychoacoustic theories of consonance. But it is also true that this<br/>breaks down for even slightly inharmonic sounds like piano tones.<br/>That is, the maximally consonant ratios are not exactly at low-<br/>numbered integer ratios but somewhere close.</p><p>Another sense of &quot;hearing frequency ratios&quot; must be also examined.<br/>That is the sense that some irrational ratios are purportedly<br/>perceived as or as substitutes of low-numbered integer ratios as if<br/>our brains categorized intervals into classes defined by low-numbered<br/>integer ratios. Interpreting this claim very charitably it is correct<br/>in the sense that pitches played simultaneously produce the experience<br/>of a root when they form an approximate harmonic series. Both the<br/>frequency ratio 2:3 and a ratio close to it produce the same type of<br/>root experience (a virtual pitch at 1) even if the experience is<br/>stronger with 2:3. Only in that rather contorted sense we can be said<br/>to hear a ratio of 2:3 when we hear a 12-equal fifth for example.</p><p>But that&apos;s it. I claim that this is where it stops. The hearing of<br/>ratios doesn&apos;t carry further into the cognition of musical structures<br/>like scales and chord progressions. That is, multiples and ratios of<br/>ratios are already not perceived as being composed of ratios.<br/>When we have been ear-trained to recognize a fifth and a fourth we<br/>are not thereby able to recognize a whole tone or an octave as being<br/>made of a fifth and a fourth. That is why a tempered comma pump<br/>progression doesn&apos;t sound like an illusion or a perversion. When the<br/>tonic chord is reached and it doesn&apos;t sound a syntonic comma off<br/>the brain doesn&apos;t go &quot;WTF just happened! Four 2:3s should make a<br/>16:81, not a 1:5. Initiate a sensation of vertigo!&quot; It doesn&apos;t<br/>calculate the relations of frequency ratios further than the basic<br/>first-order level. Why would it do that?

I&rsquo;m just explaining that I can&rsquo;t imagine how I could ever understand meantone without first understanding JI. And I was giving an example that if someone told me to make a temperament with octaves as periods and fifths as generators, I would obviously go for Pythagorean and not bother with tempering at all because I wouldn&rsquo;t treat C-E as a consonant interval (if I had never heard a larger part of the harmonic series) but rather as an unstable &bdquo;ditone&ldquo; which should be resolved into a stable interval like a fourth or a fifth. Or otherwise, I just don&rsquo;t know what you meant.</p><p>&gt;  I am interested in how you found out how to do miracle temperament via mean-tone,<br/>&gt; since miracle involves generation via chaining of seconds and, at first glance,<br/>&gt; you would think they have little in common (plus I am admittedly interested in the art<br/>&gt; of purifying seconds and minor-seconds since so many musicians consider them<br/>&gt; as a-tonal for use in chords).</p><p>Well, there are more possible methods of &bdquo;discovering&ldquo; temperaments. Let&rsquo;s start with the meantone example. Suppose I want to get a temperament approximating 3:4:5:6. Either I could find the factor of 81/80 and break it into two complementary prime exponent pairs with the target period of 2/1 (which tells me that the interval approximating 5/1 is 4 times larger than the one approximating 3/2), which eventually gives me a fifth as a generator (or a fourth if I prefer smaller intervals). Or I could take the three factors (a=4/3, b=5/4, c=6/5) and split them by each other as many times as I want (d=a/c, e=b/d, f=c/e, g=e/d), which gives me a scale of five 10/9s, two 16/15s, and three 81/80s. Then I&lsquo;ll temper out the smallest of the resulting intervals by widening the larger ones by a desired fraction of the small one, which gives me the meantone diatonic scale. Since I know how many of the three intervals I need to get a 4/3, 5/4, or 7/6, this allows me to find other intervals as well and thus possibly describe the meantone mapping. The important thing to note here is that both of these methods can reveal many different temperaments even if I leave the target primes at 2,3,5 (for the former method) or if I leave the target chord at 3:4:5:6 (for the latter).</p><p>Now to miracle. One method is to first temper out (let&rsquo;s pick up something more obvious in miracle) 1029/1024 by breaking it into two complementary prime exponent pairs (which tells me that the interval approximating 3/2 is 3 times larger than the one approximating 8/7), then temper out 225/224 by breaking it into three prime exponent pairs (which tells me that the interval approximating 16/15 also approximates 15/14 and therefore stacking two of them approximates 8/7). Another method is to begin with a 7-limit chord like 5:7:8:12:14 (i.e. a=7/5, b=8/7, c=3/2, d=7/6) and split the intervals by each other as many times as I want while already thinking ahead of where I could get similar interval sizes (e=c/b, f=a/f, g=e/b, h=d/b, i=g/b, j=b/f, k=j/f), which gives me a scale spanning a total range of 14/5 where one octave contains ten 16/15s, one 49/48, one 1029/1024, and five 225/224s. Since both 1029/1024 and 225/224 are farily small, I can temper them out by widening the two larger intervals by a desired fraction of these, which gives me the 11-tone miracle scale. And again, since I know how many occurrences of the four original intervals I need to get a 7/5, 8/7, 3/2 or 7/6, this allows me to get other intervals as well, which eventually describes the possible mapping of miracle. Obviously, some intervals can&rsquo;t be mapped with only 11 tones (for example, for a minor third, you need at least 13 generators to map 12/5, which requires at least 14 tones). However, this can easily be resolved by splitting the minor second into 49/48 and 256/245 (i.e. l=f/h), which gives me the 21-tone &bdquo;blackjack&ldquo; and allows me to map a full part of the harmonic series from 1 to 10 and also such intervals like the chroma of 25/24.</p><p>&gt; what are some temperaments you know (other than Miracle)<br/>&gt; which focus on optimizing intervals other than 3rds, 4ths, and 5ths?</p><p>#1. Personally the only tuning that I think would belong to this category is Bohlen-Pierce rather than miracle.</p><p>#2. Even though this tuning includes, among other things, major thirds, I think an interesting example may be a temperament I made in March 2008 which uses a period of 2/1 and a generator equal to the 13th root of 130 (or its octave inversion which is only about half of a cent away from 11/8). Its main target is to approximate chords like 8:10:11:13:16 but this is a 2D tuning which is not the 3D temperament I was talking about earlier. And then, there&rsquo;s the &bdquo;triharmonic scale&ldquo; whose description you can find in message #75311 and whose primary target approximation is 4:7:10:13:16. And then there&rsquo;s an octave-reduced version of that where the primary approximation is 4:5:7:10:13 (I&rsquo;ve made some music in this as well).</p><p>&gt;     Isn&apos;t this basically scales that involves the chaining of four note chords (and not just tetra-chords)?</p><p>You&rsquo;re mixing up things from different contexts. What I meant was that if you temper out 81/80 within a target chord of 3:4:5:6 and you get a fifth as the resulting generator, you may better understand why you can easily split the meantone diatonic scale into two tetrachords like &bdquo;C-D-E-F, G-A-B-C&ldquo;. Similarly, if you temper out 245/243 within a target chord of 3:5:7:9 and you get ~440 cents as the resulting generator, you may better understand why you can easily split the &bdquo;BP diatonic&ldquo; scale into two pentachords (where each pentachord will span a tempered 5/3 instead of 4/3).</p><p>&gt;     Well let&apos;s start with this: how did you learn BP from meantone?</p><p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll give the 2D version of BP as an example. Again, let&rsquo;s just apply the two methods I previously applied to meantone. The way I was doing it is to set a target chord of 3:5:7:9 instead of 3:4:5:6 (i.e. a=5/3, b=7/5, c=9/7) and splitting the intervals by each other as many times as I wish (d=a/c, e=b/d, f=d/c), which gives me a scale of four 9/7s, one 27/25, and two 245/243s. Then I simply temper out the smallest interval by widening the larger ones by a desired fraction of that. Another method is to take the factor of 245/243 and break it into two complementary prime exponent pairs with a target period of 3/1, which eventually gives me a tempered 9/7 as the resulting generator.</p><p>&gt;   So far I have the impression that the common thread is chaining chords together...which I think is<br/>&gt; a smart way to design scales, but doesn&apos;t seem to me to have its roots in music history.</p><p>Why do you think so?</p><p>&gt;    No, the point of similarity to me has to do with using either a chain of 5ths<br/>&gt; or approximated 5ths to generate a scale.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve already said that even if you keep the period at 2/1 and even if you keep the approximants at 3/2 and 5/4, you can get many other generator sizes than fifths and therefore many possible mappings of the approximated intervals, which in turn offers you new harmonic progressions you might otherwise never think of.</p><p>&gt;   1) What temperaments do you know which are not based on some sort of &quot;chain of x<br/>&gt; interval&quot; algorithm or a close approximation of one?</p><p>If we don&rsquo;t want a &bdquo;chain of something&ldquo;, then why bother with tempering? Look at Partch&rsquo;s tonality diamonds or my &bdquo;epiworld&ldquo; and &bdquo;epi2&ldquo; scales and you&rsquo;ll know what I mean. And if we DO want to temper something, don&rsquo;t forget tempering can also be linear, not only exponential. So you could, for example, take relative frequencies of 8:9:10:11:12:13:14 and change the differences to get 7.875:8.75:9.625:10.5:11.375:12.25:13.125:14, which changes the 7/4 into 16/9 and therefore &bdquo;linearly&ldquo; tempers out 64/63. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, this is exactly what Mike Battaglia was doing when he shrunk a chord of 4:5:6:7:8:9:10:11 so much that the 11/4 turned into an 8/3.</p><p>&gt;   2) How does mean-tone theory apply to those?</p><p>There&rsquo;s tempering in both cases, although it&rsquo;s exponential in one case and linear in the other.</p><p>&gt;    Now that does sound really interesting...my knowledge honestly probably wasn&apos;t up to stuff at the time<br/>&gt; you posted those.  I&apos;m a huge fan of scales that can manage step sizes down to about 11/10 (actually<br/>&gt; &quot;all the way&quot; up to closeness of about 12/11) and still sound fairly resolved.  I&apos;m also great believer in any<br/>&gt; sort of experiment that uses harmonics from the harmonic series up to 20 yet spaces them in a way<br/>&gt; that controls tonal roughness reasonably.  I will admit, from what I&apos;ve heard of 2-tone MOS that theory of<br/>&gt; scale generation seems a bit limited to me...going 3D (AKA hyper-MOS, right?) sounds quite interesting.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;    If you can put together some links to posts as to how you derived such 3D temperaments, I&apos;d be happy<br/>&gt; to read about them.  I think I&apos;ve run into a few simply by stacking 4-note chords using some fairly high-limit<br/>&gt; ratios, but admittedly did so by experimentation rather than knowing the inner workings<br/>&gt; of how to &quot;run a 3D temperament generator&quot;.</p><p>In message #84266, you can find descriptions for three of the temperaments -- i.e. the octave-reduced variant of the &bdquo;triharmonic&ldquo; tuning, then the 2D tuning from March 2008 (which i was privately calling &bdquo;emka&ldquo; because of the prime mapping order), and then the 3D tuning from April last year. First, the target primes are listed. Then, the mapping is described in terms of period and generator counts, where the period is meant to be 2/1. And finally, the generator size in cents is given (or &bdquo;sizes&ldquo; in the 3D case).</p><p>&gt;    Well I said &quot;with Magic temperament, for example, concentrating on keeping the purity of thirds&quot;...I was<br/>&gt; trying to say Magic is fairly common and purifies thirds while other relatively common tunings (namely<br/>&gt; mean-tone) purify 5ths...I didn&apos;t say or mean &quot;Magic purifies 3rds and fifths&quot;.  It makes perfect sense to me<br/>&gt; that Magic purifies thirds at the expense of 5ths.</p><p>#1. Do really both of us mean the same thing when saying &bdquo;magic&ldquo;?</p><p>#2. Why do you think that &bdquo;magic is fairly common&ldquo;?</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=86315 href="#86315">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2010 8:11:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Then what do our brains analyze music in terms of? It can&apos;t all just<br/>be arbitrary cultural conditioning.&quot;</p><p>So far I&apos;ve run into these things that challenge how our brain analyzes music<br/>A) Lack of periodicity.  Perhaps the most obvious one.  I&apos;ve found the period in a chord must be fairly short, but that shortness is in fact still much longer and more flexible than in ratios like 8:7.  As the period gets shorter at higher octaves, the requirement for the critical band of hearing becomes more stringent and less periodic ratios and even noisey instruments like cymbals become more legal. I find that periodicity relates to the curve of the critical band no coincidence.</p><p>     My ears tell me its not as strict a requirement as people think it is IE there&apos;s no need for strict JI and only the lowest limits...up to 11-limit really isn&apos;t that bad.  For example, chords like 9:11:18 don&apos;t sound too bad so long as the closest intervals in the chord are far enough to avoid excessive...</p><p>B) Roughness.  Even blind testing with pure sine waves lets me know at a certain point (I&apos;ve found it&apos;s around 11/10) notes become so close the ears have trouble separating them and beating (or in formal terms &quot;difference tones&quot;) become too prevalent to easily digest.  Also a personal opinion: I do think there is such a thing as too much periodicity buzz where the brain starts to mind, against starting at around 11/10 and close intervals.  Of course more roughness and lack of periodicity is introduced when you add</p><p>C) Non-matching timbres.  Sethares has the solution to solving that one fairly well covered: ideally overtones must match or at least merge toward root tones.  I&apos;ve found a lot of times when people complain a &quot;semi-periodic&quot; scale (esp. 11-limit or 13-limit) sounds bad because of lack of periodicity, the complaint vanishes once matching timbres are applied.</p><p>     I also have strong suspicions that, rather than simply focussing on &quot;tonality&quot; and finding a root harmonic series pitch for a chord, the brain focuses on periodicity (which may or may not point so obviously to a single root tone) and has problems when there is</p><p>D)  Lack of obvious/&quot;generated&quot; patterns within the root tones of the scale.  If I take a scale generated by 1+(1/sqrt(2)) ^x and start detuning notes even slightly from it the rhythm formed by the difference tones seems more chaotic.<br/>  Sure, this sort of alignment applies for things like TET scales as countless people have suspected. However, I&apos;m pretty sure it has an effect on any scale formed by a &quot;generator&quot;: the brain likes root tones to follow or at least merge near a single generator if some sort...just as it likes to follow a curve in visual art.</p><p>     I get a lot of heat on this list, it seems, because I don&apos;t tie everything in music related to the sense of &quot;resolve&quot; down to simple A) and the concept of tonality.  I&apos;m a firm believer that the is much more to explore related to making music easier for the brain to digest yet more complex and flexible in its own right.</p><p>  Those of you who also believe that it&apos;s about more than periodicity and tonality please show your hands. :-)</p></div><h3><a id=86316 href="#86316">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2010 3:55:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr, thanks for this.

Neil Haverstick once contacted me and said he thought a major problem with microtonallity is it needs to be displayed in a fashion that it&apos;s attractive to the average professional musician from a compositional standpoint.   And I agree.  If there were one quick way to get musicians away from the monotony of standard chords quickly, it would be to convince them to use such intervals.  I&apos;ve never seen any sort of musicians (including even my brother who&apos;s a professional jazz guitarist) who compose much with semi-tone chords, if at all.</p><p>      I just figure if we micro-tonalists want anything like a minor-second to become commonplace for use among many of the non-avant-garde musicians we love to hear, it&apos;s probably worth it to try and think up a more resolved sounding alternative to the semitone.</p><p>&gt;&quot;G E F B C G A - there&apos;s a great mixolydian voicing that uses half steps.<br/>Gb D Eb A Bb F - another great one for Gb aug #9 that I just came up<br/>with off the top of my head.<br/>C E F A - a simple maj7 chord in an inversion.&quot;</p><p>     See my experiment on &quot;tone clustering&quot;.  I&apos;m currently &quot;messing around&quot; trying to figure out just how many half-steps one can fit into a chord before they become so jumbled they come across as in-audible.<br/>Out of your chords...</p><p>    C E F A is actually a chord clear enough sounding for most &quot;standard&quot; musicians to actually just want to pick up and use. :-)<br/>   Do you have any more 4-note chords using the semitone with nearly as good or better consonance?</p><p>    G E F B C G A is very cool but IMVHO a bit too dissonant and avant-garde sounding to get most musicians to accept and actually use.  It&apos;s in chords like that where I&apos;m tempted to use intervals like 11/10 or 12/11 in place of the &quot;semi-tone&quot; to give it that extra edge that would make so many more musicians open to using it.</p><p>Just wondering...could you make a list of, in your opinion, the best 5-tone-per-octave chords utilizing the half-step/semi-tone?

Or what alternative term do you think would make it specific enough?</p><p>&gt;&quot;- Whether the high priest at your monestary thinks that the tritone is<br/>the devil&apos;s interval&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot;- Whether a certain chord reminds you of that one time your girlfriend<br/>broke up with you while you were doing your taxes&quot;<br/>Irrelevant, but still quite funny. :-D</p><p>&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t think a single qualitative dimension of &quot;consonance&quot; can<br/>really describe whether random listener X will end up &quot;liking&quot; the<br/>sound of a chord at the end of the day.&quot;</p><p>  True, but look at the chord structures in, say, advanced jazz vs. pop and their popularity.  Obviously, this is when jazz is actually the more technical and thorough art.</p><p>     Point is...if we ever want lots of musicians to take micro-tonality seriously or most professional musicians to even give it a nod...we need to show them some scale with chords they could never do before and give them non-embarrassing levels of resolve (aka consonance) that they wouldn&apos;t be embarrassed to play live.<br/>     Then I figure we can worry about things like how the composition around those chords can evolve.  Guaranteed virtually no professional composers are likely to care about switching to a scale where you maximize the purity of his third by a mere 10 cents...and they will definitely run if most chords in your scale sound like sour types of 13ths.  And that&apos;s regardless of if they are composers who use context very well IE know not to throw a sudden chord with much more/less resolve suddenly into a piece without transition or warning.</p><p>  Most people aren&apos;t going to recognize micro-tonality until micro-tonality takes their needs more seriously.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And Michael Sheiman for some reason seems to care in the order of #3, #2, and #1.&quot;</p><p>    I did not insist on the order being in order of importance in the first place.  I simply said those were some of the many things that can be used to improve &quot;mathematical&quot; consonance and &quot;even&quot; convince some professional musicians to take micro-tonality more seriously.  Granted I put periodicity first...but only because I&apos;ve heard so many people on the list talk about when they discuss &quot;consonance&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;In my view, just disregarding all that to pretend that a single<br/>dimension of &quot;consonance&quot;&quot;</p><p>     Single dimension?

There is absolutely no intention to limit this to just 12 different tones.</p><p>All of these software have been made available free, so I suppose development is a bit slow, but we are moving ahead (slowly).</p><p>Also, you may be interested in Hex - a microtonal MIDI sequencer designed to interface with the above synths. It&apos;s still in alpha stage, but briefly, any linear mapping from a 2-D tuning to a 2-D button lattice has an &quot;isotone&quot; axis (a series of parallel lines) that connects the centres of &quot;buttons&quot; with the same pitch. As the ratio of the two generators&apos; tunings changes, the angle of the isotone rotates. This means that if a button lattice is rotated so as to keep the isotone horizontal, it can be used as a replacement for the standard piano roll interface, but can be used for any 2-D tuning. If you want more info, email me and I can send a draft paper that explains this properly.</p><p>Anyway, they can all be downloaded from <a href="http://www.dynamictonality.com">www.dynamictonality.com</a>.</p><p>Here&apos;s the MIDI mapping bumpf....</p><p>Both 2032 and Hex map MIDI channel 1 note numbers to in such a way as to give a standard meantone piano note-selection (i.e., C, C-sharp, D, E-flat, E, F, F-sharp, G, G-sharp, A, B-flat, B), whilst MIDI channel 2 note numbers are mapped to 12-TET enharmonic equivalents twelve fifths below (i.e., D-double flat, D-flat, E-double flat, F-double flat, F-flat, G-double flat, G-flat, A-double flat, A-flat, B-double flat, C-double flat, C-flat), and MIDI channel 3 to 12-TET enharmonic equivalents twelve fifths above (i.e., B-sharp, B-double sharp, C-double sharp, D-sharp, D-double sharp, E-sharp, E-double sharp, F-double sharp, F-triple sharp, G-double sharp, A-sharp, A-double sharp). This means that when playing in 12-TET, the channel number has no effect, but when playing in another relatively familiar tuning, such as meantone or Pythagorean, where enharmonically equivalent notes no longer have the same frequency, the user can choose between them simply by changing MIDI channel number. For example, D-sharp can be represented by MIDI note number 63, MIDI channel 1; whereas, E-flat can be represented by MIDI note number 63, MIDI channel 2.</p><p>In this way, 2032 maintains backwards compatibility with traditional hardware and software MIDI controllers and sequencers, whilst still enabling the new feature of being able to differentiate between the tunings of sharps and flats in certain tunings. The mapping also means that Hex can be used to control conventional 12-TET synthesizers.</p><p>For non-syntonic continua - the mapping between MIDI note number/channel and generators is the same...</p><p>Andy Milne</p></div><h3><a id=86329 href="#86329">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2010 2:06:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris,</p><p>Since the Silver scale seems to be doing so well (at least in your hands), you may want to try this new 5-tone version</p><p>1/1<br/>13/12 (approximates 1.07106)<br/>15/12 (approximates 1.24264)<br/>17/12                                                             (approximates 1.4142135...silver-Tave)<br/>20/12 or 5/3 (approximates1.1715728*1.414)<br/>2/1                                                                 (approximates 1.4142135^2...double Silver-Tave)</p><p>AKA</p><p>12:13:15:17:20:24</p><p>      My latest ventures into periodicity seem to show the 18th harmonic partial is where periodicity fades into lack of resolve/&quot;dissonance&quot; and the ratio 12/11 is around where the mind start having serious trouble handling beating/roughness.

I claim that this is where it stops. The hearing of<br/>&gt; ratios doesn&apos;t carry further into the cognition of musical structures<br/>&gt; like scales and chord progressions.</p><p>Why not scales? If come up with a simple 3-note scale that&apos;s just 4:5:6, and<br/>I play each note separately - C, E, G, E, C, E, G, E, C - does your brain<br/>not still put it together as a major chord? Or, if I play an Eb chord, and<br/>then go to just a C-G drone -- you will still hear some minor quality to it.</p><p>&gt; That is, multiples and ratios of<br/>&gt; ratios are already not perceived as being composed of ratios.<br/>&gt; When we have been ear-trained to recognize a fifth and a fourth we<br/>&gt; are not thereby able to recognize a whole tone or an octave as being<br/>&gt; made of a fifth and a fourth.</p><p>As for what you said - that we don&apos;t hear an octave as a fifth + a fourth -<br/>this is true, but I do think that to some extent we can hear a major 7th as<br/>a 3rd + a fifth. And in the example I showed above:<br/>C-E-F#-B-D#<br/>If that C-D# were played in isolation, I think it&apos;d probably sound like 6/5.<br/>However - when the other notes are put in, the cracks are filled in, and the<br/>brain gets an idea of how to travel from C to D#.</p><p>&gt; That is why a tempered comma pump<br/>&gt; progression doesn&apos;t sound like an illusion or a perversion. When the<br/>&gt; tonic chord is reached and it doesn&apos;t sound a syntonic comma off<br/>&gt; the brain doesn&apos;t go &quot;WTF just happened! Four 2:3s should make a<br/>&gt; 16:81, not a 1:5. Initiate a sensation of vertigo!&quot;</p><p> Hahahaha! Well, it should. I think I&apos;ll start making my own artificial<br/>vertigo so my brain can catch up.</p><p>Despite the examples I wrote above - what you said here is obviously right<br/>as well. I&apos;m not sure where to draw the line between how the brain can<br/>&quot;remember&quot; intervals and how it can&apos;t.</p><p>Obviously the brain can remember previous intervals to some extent, or else<br/>all chord progressions would sound the same, which is emotionless and dull.</p><p>&gt; It doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; calculate the relations of frequency ratios further than the basic<br/>&gt; first-order level. Why would it do that? What evolutionary reason<br/>&gt; would there be for the existence of such a faculty. How would it help<br/>&gt; in hearing speech sounds for example?</p><p>This is related to an experiment that I think you should try: Go to an<br/>organ, and set the drawbars so that the only harmonics coming out are the<br/>fundamental and 3/1. Turn the fundamental so it&apos;s down low, but still there.<br/>Start playing happy birthday or something easy. Meanwhile, after playing it<br/>through once or twice, start turning the fundamental down until it is<br/>completely silent, and only 3/1 remains.</p><p>If you do it right, you can actually &quot;trick&quot; your brain into perceiving the<br/>phantom 1/1, even though the only thing there is a 3/1 sinusoid. It helps to<br/>keep imagining the original &quot;happy birthday&quot; song in the original key while<br/>you do this. You&apos;ll find you can very easily &quot;flip your brain&quot; around to<br/>just hear the 3/1 as a new 1/1, and once you do that, it&apos;s hard to go back.</p><p>This I think is related to the source separation and identification<br/>processes going on in your brain. The concept of finding &quot;different harmonic<br/>spectra&quot; for the wash of sound coming in is inherently tied in with notions<br/>of source separation anyway. Once your brain has a harmonic spectrum picked<br/>out, it holds onto it for a second.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=86338 href="#86338">ðŸ”—</a>Steven Grainger &#x3C;srgrainger@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2010 3:42:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Michael</p><p>Are there any mp3 links to music played in your scales?</p><p>I am especially interested in consonance.</p><p>Ta Steve<br/>&nbsp;</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Sat, 13 February, 2010 8:06:07 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Silver scale revisited...apparently enjoyed by a handful of people, if just that</p><p>&nbsp;<br/>Chris,</p><p>Since the Silver scale seems to be doing so well (at least in your hands), you may want to try this new 5-tone version</p><p>1/1<br/>13/12 (approximates 1.07106)<br/>15/12 (approximates 1.24264)<br/>17/12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (approximates 1.4142135... silver-Tave)<br/>20/12 or 5/3 (approximates1. 1715728*1. 414)<br/>2/1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (approximates 1.4142135^2. ..double Silver-Tave)</p><p>AKA</p><p>12:13:15:17: 20:24</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My latest ventures into periodicity seem to show the 18th harmonic partial is where periodicity fades into lack of resolve/&quot;dissonance &quot; and the ratio 12/11 is around where the mind start having serious trouble handling beating/roughness.&nbsp; So here&apos;s a new version of the Silver scale which de-tunes certain notes a bit so all the possible dyads meet those standards you may want to try.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&nbsp; However..... .........</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want more dissonance (or at least what I perceived as dissonance), you can always add 18/12 (approximates 1.4142135 * 1.1715728)&nbsp; and &quot;grind&quot; it against the nearby 17/12<br/>OR<br/>add 21/12 or 7/4 (approximates 1.4142135 * 1.24264)<br/>OR<br/>add 14/12 (approximates 1.4142135 * 1.07106) for some extra periodicity buzz.&nbsp;</p><p>Adding all of these would result in a &quot;just-ified&quot; yet fairly dissonance-capable 8-tone Silver Scale</p><p>12:13:14:15: 17:18:20: 21:24</p><p>&nbsp;I just figure hey....if you&apos;re going to make dissonance it might as well be somewhat periodic.</p><p>-Michael</p><p>Hello Michael</p></div><h3><a id=86344 href="#86344">ðŸ”—</a>jlmoriart &#x3C;JlMoriart@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2010 3:54:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Just to clarify:<br/>The TransFormSynth is NOT limited to 12 tones per octave. ONLY the Viking and 2032 are, and this is an artifact of the fact that they are designed in synthmaker. There are plans to change the layout to an isomorphic layout, I assume when time allows.</p><p>Until that happens, not only do I not recommend them, but I recommend *not* using them, because they use a piano layout which hides useful information about what is actually happening when changing the tuning.</p><p>Basically, in these two synths, only one of two enharmonic equivalents can be chosen to occupy a space on the keyboard and so when the tuning is changed you only have one or the other. This is not the case for the TFS, which has a different location for each enharmonic equivalent as shown in that above diagram.</p><p>If instead of The Viking or 2032 one tried the TFS, one would find that one would indeed have more than 12 tones per octave available, and they would be in this layout here:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicki-Hayden_note_layout">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicki-Hayden_note_layout</a></p><p>Notice the different locations of each enharmonic equivalent in 12-edo.</p><p>The interesting thing is that, as one progresses along the beta chain (or stacks of fifths), the pitches reached become less and less tonally relevant to a given tonic. As it turns out, only about 19 pitches are ever tonally relevant to a given tonic, these being the tonic itself and the first nine stacks of the generator (or fifth) above and below that tonic. So, in 31-equal divisions of the octave with a generator size of about 697 cents, only 19 of the generated 31 tones would be tonally useful at one given time, and those are the pitches that are mapped to the wicki/hayden isomorphic layout that the TFS uses.</p><p>The intent for the Thummer was to provide only these 19 pitches at once and then provide a function for modulation that would then transpose the instrument whenever a key change (a change in tonic) occurred. The instrument would then contain the 19 pitches relevant to the new tonic.</p><p>This is comparable to how in traditional notation, when playing with a tonic C, one never ever saw a D double sharp unless there was some serious modulation beforehand. The tonal function of a doubly augmented second is not useful in common practice tonal music.</p><p>So, no matter the tuning, only (about) the first nine generated pitches above and below your tonic and their octave equivalents are tonally useful to that given tonic. Sometimes, like with 5-,7-,12-, and 17-edo, there is overlapping of pitch within even these 19 harmonic functions, sometimes the overlapping occurs within a still relatively small number of stacks larger than 19 like with 31-, 43-, or 53-edo, and sometimes the overlapping does not occur for a very long time with the beta generators in between all of our generally recognized syntonic equal divisions of the octave.<br/>I did a small analysis of tonal function across the syntonic temperament and blogged about it here:</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.ning.com/profiles/blogs/harmonicdiatonic-function">http://xenharmonic.ning.com/profiles/blogs/harmonicdiatonic-function</a></p><p>If you want a little more depth on the matter, I have an unfinished powerpoint presentation that may be at least somewhat useful.

This is what I<br/>was talking about earlier. To prove this premise suspect,<br/>one need only to compose some music using those<br/>pitches that are excluded, showing how relevant those<br/>excluded pitches can be.</p><p>&gt; So, in 31-equal divisions of the octave with a<br/>&gt; generator size of about 697 cents, only 19 of the<br/>&gt; generated 31 tones would be tonally useful at one<br/>&gt; given time, and those are the pitches that are<br/>&gt; mapped to the wicki/hayden isomorphic layout that<br/>&gt; the TFS uses.</p><p>This is the bias inherent within the approach<br/>that&apos;s being taken with the Wicki/Hayden layout.<br/>The approach begins with an assumption of privileged<br/>subsets, based on a premise of tonal centricity. So<br/>from scales having large numbers of pitches, the only<br/>pitches anyone can use are those subsets that are<br/>mapped to the keys for them.</p><p>&gt; The intent for the Thummer was to provide only<br/>&gt; these 19 pitches at once and then provide a function<br/>&gt; for modulation that would then transpose the<br/>&gt; instrument whenever a key change (a change in<br/>&gt; tonic) occurred. The instrument would then contain<br/>&gt; the 19 pitches relevant to the new tonic.</p><p>Again, the exclusion rules of tonal centricity, forcing<br/>choices to only some pitches and not others.</p><p>&gt; This is comparable to how in traditional notation,<br/>&gt; when playing with a tonic C, one never ever saw<br/>&gt; a D double sharp unless there was some serious<br/>&gt; modulation beforehand. The tonal function of a<br/>&gt; doubly augmented second is not useful in common<br/>&gt; practice tonal music.</p><p>Which shows again the bias here towards thinking<br/>only in terms of diatonicism.</p><p>&gt; So, no matter the tuning, only (about) the first<br/>&gt; nine generated pitches above and below your<br/>&gt; tonic and their octave equivalents are tonally<br/>&gt; useful to that given tonic.</p><p>Same assertion, deciding for me what is and is<br/>not tonally useful.</p><p>&gt; Sometimes, like with<br/>&gt; 5-,7-,12-, and 17-edo, there is overlapping<br/>&gt; of pitch within even these 19 harmonic functions,<br/>&gt; sometimes the overlapping occurs within a still<br/>&gt; relatively small number of stacks larger than<br/>&gt; 19 like with 31-, 43-, or 53-edo, and sometimes<br/>&gt; the overlapping does not occur for a very long<br/>&gt; time with the beta generators in between all of<br/>&gt; our generally recognized syntonic equal divisions<br/>&gt; of the octave.<br/>&gt; I did a small analysis of tonal function across the<br/>&gt; syntonic temperament and blogged about it here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://xenharmonic.ning.com/profiles/blogs/harmonicdiatonic-function">http://xenharmonic.ning.com/profiles/blogs/harmonicdiatonic-function</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want a little more depth on the matter, I<br/>&gt; have an unfinished powerpoint presentation that<br/>&gt; may be at least somewhat useful.

So be it.  -Carl<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi all, just to clarify a few aspects about The Viking, TransFormSynth, and 2032, they are intended to be complementary - the first is an additive-subtractive synth, TFS is an analysis-resynthesis synth, the latter is a modal synth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is our intention to map MIDI note and channel number to generator in the manner shown at the bottom of this email (I think this has been done in TFS - I may be wrong), it has not yet been done in Viking, 2032 is still very much in alpha stage. There is absolutely no intention to limit this to just 12 different tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All of these software have been made available free, so I suppose development is a bit slow, but we are moving ahead (slowly).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, you may be interested in Hex - a microtonal MIDI sequencer designed to interface with the above synths. It&apos;s still in alpha stage, but briefly, any linear mapping from a 2-D tuning to a 2-D button lattice has an &quot;isotone&quot; axis (a series of parallel lines) that connects the centres of &quot;buttons&quot; with the same pitch. As the ratio of the two generators&apos; tunings changes, the angle of the isotone rotates. This means that if a button lattice is rotated so as to keep the isotone horizontal, it can be used as a replacement for the standard piano roll interface, but can be used for any 2-D tuning. If you want more info, email me and I can send a draft paper that explains this properly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, they can all be downloaded from <a href="http://www.dynamictonality.com">www.dynamictonality.com</a>.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s the MIDI mapping bumpf....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Both 2032 and Hex map MIDI channel 1 note numbers to in such a way as to give a standard meantone piano note-selection (i.e., C, C-sharp, D, E-flat, E, F, F-sharp, G, G-sharp, A, B-flat, B), whilst MIDI channel 2 note numbers are mapped to 12-TET enharmonic equivalents twelve fifths below (i.e., D-double flat, D-flat, E-double flat, F-double flat, F-flat, G-double flat, G-flat, A-double flat, A-flat, B-double flat, C-double flat, C-flat), and MIDI channel 3 to 12-TET enharmonic equivalents twelve fifths above (i.e., B-sharp, B-double sharp, C-double sharp, D-sharp, D-double sharp, E-sharp, E-double sharp, F-double sharp, F-triple sharp, G-double sharp, A-sharp, A-double sharp). This means that when playing in 12-TET, the channel number has no effect, but when playing in another relatively familiar tuning, such as meantone or Pythagorean, where enharmonically equivalent notes no longer have the same frequency, the user can choose between them simply by changing MIDI channel number. For example, D-sharp can be represented by MIDI note number 63, MIDI channel 1; whereas, E-flat can be represented by MIDI note number 63, MIDI channel 2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this way, 2032 maintains backwards compatibility with traditional hardware and software MIDI controllers and sequencers, whilst still enabling the new feature of being able to differentiate between the tunings of sharps and flats in certain tunings. The mapping also means that Hex can be used to control conventional 12-TET synthesizers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For non-syntonic continua - the mapping between MIDI note number/channel and generators is the same...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Andy Milne<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86374 href="#86374">ðŸ”—</a>andymilneuk &#x3C;ANDYMILNE@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2010 2:41:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Aaron</p><p>Any misunderstandings are mostly our fault because we&apos;ve done very little to actually document what we&apos;re doing...</p><p>With regard to the mapping chosen: No single mapping from MIDI note number (and channel) to the number of periods and generators that define a tone in a 2-D tuning system can suit all its tunings (because the pitch order of the tones changes as the size ratio of the generator and period changes).</p><p>So we decided to choose a mapping that made standard MIDI controllers compatible when using conventional (diatonic) tunings - when any of the synths are set to &quot;syntonic&quot;, they can be played with a standard MIDI keyboard or sequencer. When set to any other continuum, the pitches produced by a standard MIDI controller will have no obvious logic. Of course, a user can remap the MIDI produced by their controller so as to produce a mapping that suits them - or use three stacked keyboards, if that suits.</p><p>But, these synths are ideally controlled by a 2-D button lattice. The purpose of the sequencer Hex is to make a software 2-D &quot;button&quot;-lattice sequencer freely available.</p><p>Another thing to note about the DT synths is that although they are based on 2-D tunings, using the tone-diamond interface, it is possible to move smoothly to two different 5-limit (3-D) JI scales that are related to the 2-D chain (they are JI notes that are mapped to the 2-D notes by the mapping matrix - i.e. the temperament class - with comma-variants selected so the chain contains the highest density if 4:5:6 triads). In other words, the JI-notes form a band running across a JI-tonnetz.</p><p>Also, I&apos;m a bit out-of-touch with exactly what&apos;s been coded (in terms of MIDI mappings) with each of the synths - I&apos;m not doing the hands-on programming myself.

For example, D-sharp can be represented by MIDI note number 63, MIDI channel 1; whereas, E-flat can be represented by MIDI note number 63, MIDI channel 2.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In this way, 2032 maintains backwards compatibility with traditional hardware and software MIDI controllers and sequencers, whilst still enabling the new feature of being able to differentiate between the tunings of sharps and flats in certain tunings. The mapping also means that Hex can be used to control conventional 12-TET synthesizers.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For non-syntonic continua - the mapping between MIDI note number/channel and generators is the same...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Andy Milne<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86377 href="#86377">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torsten.anders@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2010 3:23:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 12.02.2010, at 23:54, jlmoriart wrote:<br/>&gt; The interesting thing is that, as one progresses along the beta &gt; chain (or stacks of fifths), the pitches reached become less and &gt; less tonally relevant to a given tonic.

First of all, if you want to understand the qualities of those unfamiliar temperaments, it&rsquo;s necessary to get rid of the prejudices trying to compare everything to classical harmony. The syst&eacute;m of relating chords and keys by fifths and ommitting the syntonic comma differences comes undeniably from the properties of meantone (the same for standard notation); and it&rsquo;s important to note that the syntonic comma is the one and ONLY interval which is tempered out in 5-limit meantone while other intervals (including smaller ones) are not. In 5-limit hanson, for example, the only interval which is tempered out is the kleisma (15625/15552) while other intervals (including the syntonic comma) are not. For this reason, a piece originally intended for meantone can&rsquo;t be retuned to something like hanson (preserving the same chords) or vice versa.</p><p>But even so, you still have other possibilities. One of them is to tak&eacute; a 12-tone chain of the desired generators and apply that (or try to apply that) to the conventional 12-tone keyboard, although many temperaments don&rsquo;t make a MOS with 12 tone scales and therefore, unlike meantone, their 12-tone versions have more than two intervals per interval class (for example, hanson makes a MOS with a scale of 11 tones, 15, or 19, among others). If you use Scala, you may get a possible version of 5-limit hanson by first doing &bdquo;equal 11 15/2&ldquo; and then &bdquo;normalize&ldquo; (i.e. first make a chain of 11 slightly wider minor thirds and then reduce this into a single octave range). Because we already know that hanson uses minor thirds as generators and that it tempers out 15625/15552, this can also tell us that 6 generators approximate 3/1 and that 5 generators approximate 5/2 -- i.e. something which doesn&rsquo;t have an equivalent in meantone or in standard notation because 6 minor thirds don&rsquo;t make a twelfth (like E#, G#, B, D, F, Ab, Cb -- and not B#). This is more or less all you need to know to be able to understand how hanson works. When you eventually get the scale on your keyboard, I would suggest to first verify that you can find all the desired tones of the chain to make sure that none of them is missing or &bdquo;mistuned&ldquo; and that there are no &bdquo;bugs&ldquo; in your scale -- i.e. if your 12-tone chain of minor thirds goes from C upwards, the last tone of the chain should be B (obviously, in cases like this, the keyboard mapping can&rsquo;t always match the intervals you hear because stacking 6 minor thirds in 12-EDO doesn&rsquo;t make a twelfth). Now the only thing that remains is to improvize in it for 10 minutes or so, and you&rsquo;ll probably get it.</p><p>Another possibility is to begin with a chord progression that actually works as a triadic comma pump for the particular temperament and make some music based on that. There are a couple of ways how these chord progressions can be calculated by breaking the ratio for the &bdquo;comma&ldquo; into a complementary pair of exponents of some other factors, and I&rsquo;m currently updating an unfinished article explaining this in detail. Basically, first you find out how many generators approximate each of the three basic intervals (3/1, 5/1, and 5/3 for the 5-limit temperaments) and the highest of these generator counts then equals to the number of chords required for one repetition of the progression (i.e. 4 for meantone or mavila, 5 for magic or porcupine, 6 for hanson, 7 for negri, 9 for tetracot or semisixths).</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=86388 href="#86388">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torsten.anders@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2010 8:30:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Caleb,</p><p>Just to clarify: you are asking for &quot;gear to create sound&quot; (e.g., softsynths) that you can use in Logic via MIDI? I.e., not alternative controllers (like generalised keyboards) or alternative    techniques to organise your music (non-MIDI) or ways to compose?<br/>&gt; Current Gear: Mac OS X, with a range of conventional keyboards as<br/>&gt; input. Logic Pro. These are adequate, as far as I&apos;m concerned.<br/>&gt;<br/>Are you aware that you can freely tune the softsynths that come with Logic via Scala files? Even (5-limit) adaptive JI is supported. However, you are always limited to at max 12 pitches per octave, but its not too bad for a start :)</p><p>If you want to stay in MIDI land (for understandable reasons :) but want more that 12 pitches per octave then you may consider the &quot;classical method&quot;: write for individual voices and each voice associated with its own MIDI channel. You can then freely detune each voice with pitch bend messages.</p><p>Finally, if you want more than 12 pitches per octave and also more than one note per MIDI channel tuned freely, then there is relatively little software available for doing that. I wrote some script for the sampler Kontakt that allows to detune individual pitch classes with MIDI CC messages. I also did a module for the Tassman softsynth that does the same (there seems to be some principle Tassman limitation though that detuning some already sounding pitch classes suddently always results in some annoying portamento, so one has to take that into account).</p><p>Best wishes,<br/>Torsten</p><p>--<br/>Torsten Anders<br/>Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>University of Plymouth<br/>Office: +44-1752-586219<br/>Private: +44-1752-558917<br/><a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/><a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a></p><p>On 13.02.2010, at 14:49, caleb morgan wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m ready to take the plunge, this time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Apologies to Carl and others who gave me a list last time--I can&apos;t<br/>&gt; find it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This time, I&apos;ll make multiple backups of any responses.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m defining my goals, gear, and background for people--not to preen<br/>&gt; or complain, but so that you folks can give me appropriate advice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Basically, I&apos;m looking for what microtonal soft-synths to get, or soft<br/>&gt; samplers, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Goal: To make &apos;tape&apos; pieces--that is, recorded microtonal pieces,<br/>&gt; done here in my home studio.

When set to any other continuum, the pitches produced by a standard MIDI controller will have no obvious logic. Of course, a user can remap the MIDI produced by their controller so as to produce a mapping that suits them - or use three stacked keyboards, if that suits.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But, these synths are ideally controlled by a 2-D button lattice. The purpose of the sequencer Hex is to make a software 2-D &quot;button&quot;-lattice sequencer freely available.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another thing to note about the DT synths is that although they are based on 2-D tunings, using the tone-diamond interface, it is possible to move smoothly to two different 5-limit (3-D) JI scales that are related to the 2-D chain (they are JI notes that are mapped to the 2-D notes by the mapping matrix - i.e. the temperament class - with comma-variants selected so the chain contains the highest density if 4:5:6 triads). In other words, the JI-notes form a band running across a JI-tonnetz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, I&apos;m a bit out-of-touch with exactly what&apos;s been coded (in terms of MIDI mappings) with each of the synths - I&apos;m not doing the hands-on programming myself.

So be it.  -Carl<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all, just to clarify a few aspects about The Viking, TransFormSynth, and 2032, they are intended to be complementary - the first is an additive-subtractive synth, TFS is an analysis-resynthesis synth, the latter is a modal synth.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It is our intention to map MIDI note and channel number to generator in the manner shown at the bottom of this email (I think this has been done in TFS - I may be wrong), it has not yet been done in Viking, 2032 is still very much in alpha stage. There is absolutely no intention to limit this to just 12 different tones.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; All of these software have been made available free, so I suppose development is a bit slow, but we are moving ahead (slowly).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, you may be interested in Hex - a microtonal MIDI sequencer designed to interface with the above synths. It&apos;s still in alpha stage, but briefly, any linear mapping from a 2-D tuning to a 2-D button lattice has an &quot;isotone&quot; axis (a series of parallel lines) that connects the centres of &quot;buttons&quot; with the same pitch. As the ratio of the two generators&apos; tunings changes, the angle of the isotone rotates. This means that if a button lattice is rotated so as to keep the isotone horizontal, it can be used as a replacement for the standard piano roll interface, but can be used for any 2-D tuning. If you want more info, email me and I can send a draft paper that explains this properly.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, they can all be downloaded from <a href="http://www.dynamictonality.com">www.dynamictonality.com</a>.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Here&apos;s the MIDI mapping bumpf....<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Both 2032 and Hex map MIDI channel 1 note numbers to in such a way as to give a standard meantone piano note-selection (i.e., C, C-sharp, D, E-flat, E, F, F-sharp, G, G-sharp, A, B-flat, B), whilst MIDI channel 2 note numbers are mapped to 12-TET enharmonic equivalents twelve fifths below (i.e., D-double flat, D-flat, E-double flat, F-double flat, F-flat, G-double flat, G-flat, A-double flat, A-flat, B-double flat, C-double flat, C-flat), and MIDI channel 3 to 12-TET enharmonic equivalents twelve fifths above (i.e., B-sharp, B-double sharp, C-double sharp, D-sharp, D-double sharp, E-sharp, E-double sharp, F-double sharp, F-triple sharp, G-double sharp, A-sharp, A-double sharp). This means that when playing in 12-TET, the channel number has no effect, but when playing in another relatively familiar tuning, such as meantone or Pythagorean, where enharmonically equivalent notes no longer have the same frequency, the user can choose between them simply by changing MIDI channel number. For example, D-sharp can be represented by MIDI note number 63, MIDI channel 1; whereas, E-flat can be represented by MIDI note number 63, MIDI channel 2.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; In this way, 2032 maintains backwards compatibility with traditional hardware and software MIDI controllers and sequencers, whilst still enabling the new feature of being able to differentiate between the tunings of sharps and flats in certain tunings. The mapping also means that Hex can be used to control conventional 12-TET synthesizers.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; For non-syntonic continua - the mapping between MIDI note number/channel and generators is the same...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Andy Milne<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86406 href="#86406">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2010 6:32:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Another sense of &quot;hearing frequency ratios&quot; must be also examined.<br/>&gt; &gt; That is the sense that some irrational ratios are purportedly<br/>&gt; &gt; perceived as or as substitutes of low-numbered integer ratios as<br/>&gt; &gt; if our brains categorized intervals into classes defined by<br/>&gt; &gt;low-numbered integer ratios...<br/>&gt; //snip<br/>&gt; &gt; But that&apos;s it. I claim that this is where it stops. The hearing of<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios doesn&apos;t carry further into the cognition of musical<br/>&gt; &gt; structures like scales and chord progressions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why not scales? If come up with a simple 3-note scale that&apos;s just<br/>&gt; 4:5:6, and I play each note separately - C, E, G, E, C, E, G, E, C<br/>&gt; - does your brain not still put it together as a major chord? Or,<br/>&gt; if I play an Eb chord, and then go to just a C-G drone -- you will<br/>&gt; still hear some minor quality to it.</p><p>Yes. My wording was a bit misleading. All I meant was that the<br/>perception of ratios stays at the first-order level and I<br/>elaborated on that here:</p><p>&gt; &gt; That is, multiples and ratios of ratios are already not perceived<br/>&gt; &gt; as being composed of ratios. When we have been ear-trained to<br/>&gt; &gt; recognize a fifth and a fourth we are not thereby able to<br/>&gt; &gt; recognize a whole tone or an octave as being made of a fifth and<br/>&gt; &gt; a fourth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for what you said - that we don&apos;t hear an octave as a fifth + a<br/>&gt; fourth - this is true, but I do think that to some extent we can<br/>&gt; hear a major 7th as a 3rd + a fifth.</p><p>Yes but I think that whatever explains this is not some faculty that<br/>literally mathematically calculates interval composites as multiples<br/>of rational numbers. A more likely explanation is our familiarity<br/>with major 7th chords. This kind of explanation is cognitive: hearing<br/>major 7ths as 3rd + 5th is based on a mental schema of diatonic<br/>structure. Of course such mental schemata don&apos;t have to conform to<br/>the logic of rational numbers.</p><p>&gt; And in the example I showed above: C-E-F#-B-D#<br/>&gt; If that C-D# were played in isolation, I think it&apos;d probably sound<br/>&gt; like 6/5. However - when the other notes are put in, the cracks are<br/>&gt; filled in, and the brain gets an idea of how to travel from C to D#.</p><p>Yes but I really doubt that the interval from C to D# is thereby<br/>literally represented in the brain as the ratio 32:75 even if it is<br/>tuned so. I&apos;m not even sure if I hear that chord in the way that<br/>spelling suggests when it is played alone without any tonal context.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It doesn&apos;t calculate the relations of frequency ratios further<br/>&gt; &gt; than the basic first-order level. Why would it do that? What<br/>&gt; &gt; evolutionary reason would there be for the existence of such a<br/>&gt; &gt; faculty. How would it help in hearing speech sounds for example?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is related to an experiment that I think you should try: Go to<br/>&gt; an organ, and set the drawbars so that the only harmonics coming<br/>&gt; out are the fundamental and 3/1. Turn the fundamental so it&apos;s down<br/>&gt; low, but still there. Start playing happy birthday or something<br/>&gt; easy. Meanwhile, after playing it through once or twice, start<br/>&gt; turning the fundamental down until it is completely silent, and<br/>&gt; only 3/1 remains.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you do it right, you can actually &quot;trick&quot; your brain into<br/>&gt; perceiving the phantom 1/1, even though the only thing there is a<br/>&gt; 3/1 sinusoid. It helps to keep imagining the original &quot;happy<br/>&gt; birthday&quot; song in the original key while you do this. You&apos;ll find<br/>&gt; you can very easily &quot;flip your brain&quot; around to just hear the 3/1<br/>&gt; as a new 1/1, and once you do that, it&apos;s hard to go back.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This I think is related to the source separation and identification<br/>&gt; processes going on in your brain. The concept of finding &quot;different<br/>&gt; harmonic spectra&quot; for the wash of sound coming in is inherently<br/>&gt; tied in with notions of source separation anyway. Once your brain<br/>&gt; has a harmonic spectrum picked out, it holds onto it for a second.</p><p>I tried this and what a kick-ass experiment it is, really<br/>interesting!

A more likely explanation is our familiarity<br/>&gt; with major 7th chords. This kind of explanation is cognitive: hearing<br/>&gt; major 7ths as 3rd + 5th is based on a mental schema of diatonic<br/>&gt; structure. Of course such mental schemata don&apos;t have to conform to<br/>&gt; the logic of rational numbers.</p><p>I agree with that, but if you listen closely enough, you notice that<br/>often it does. That is, the tritone C-F# can function in a thousand<br/>possible ways. Play that tritone, then imagine it as part of a D7<br/>chord. Then imagine it as part of an Ab7 chord. Then imagine it as<br/>part of a C7#11 chord, and then a Cmaj7#11 chord. Voila, same thing.<br/>You&apos;re &quot;imagining&quot; different bridges from C to F#.</p><p>The only thing is that you treat this purely in psychological terms -<br/>in terms of mental schemata and such - but I think that it isn&apos;t quite<br/>so isolated. You have a bit of influence in how you hear a chord, and<br/>the schema that pops up when you hear it is a part of it. Play a 350<br/>cent third and then &quot;imagine&quot; that it&apos;s a really flat 6/5, and then<br/>&quot;imagine&quot; it as a really flat 5/4. Voila again. The same thing is<br/>happening here as above. I think what&apos;s happening here is that when<br/>you imagine other notes in addition to a chord, your brain basically<br/>analyzes the notes you hear + the ones you imagine all together. It<br/>just gives the imagined notes less &quot;weight,&quot; the same as if they<br/>existed in real life but at a lower volume.</p><p>&gt; Yes but I really doubt that the interval from C to D# is thereby<br/>&gt; literally represented in the brain as the ratio 32:75 even if it is<br/>&gt; tuned so. I&apos;m not even sure if I hear that chord in the way that<br/>&gt; spelling suggests when it is played alone without any tonal context.</p><p>You hear the C-E, the E-B, and the B-D#. If you can&apos;t hear this as a<br/>coherent chord but rather some dissonant stack of noise, I would<br/>expect your brain would hear it more as &quot;bitonal&quot; or &quot;polytonal&quot; -<br/>consisting of multiple harmonic structures - and not have the 32:75.<br/>However, if you can hear the whole thing as a single harmonic<br/>structure, I think that would imply the 32:75 has been recognized.</p><p>&gt; I tried this and what a kick-ass experiment it is, really<br/>&gt; interesting! But I fail to see its&apos; relevance to what I said.</p><p>It&apos;s relevant to what you said here:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; It doesn&apos;t calculate the relations of frequency ratios further<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; than the basic first-order level. Why would it do that? What<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; evolutionary reason would there be for the existence of such a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; faculty. How would it help in hearing speech sounds for example?</p><p>When you said this, you mentioned that the brain doesn&apos;t &quot;remember&quot;<br/>previous frequency ratios and that&apos;s why comma pumps don&apos;t cause you<br/>to become psychotic. Then you said, why would it do that, what<br/>evolutionary reason would there be?</p><p>Well, I&apos;m saying that it DOES remember previous frequency ratios, and<br/>the above experiment is proof of that. The evolutionary reason is that<br/>this capability would have assisted in source identification. I think<br/>this is also responsible for why chord progressions &quot;work.&quot;</p><p>Perhaps, in this context, comma pumps &quot;work&quot; because they&apos;re just<br/>perceived as a slight &quot;background inharmonicity&quot; in the chord<br/>progression, similar to Sethares&apos; detuning of timbres being perceived<br/>as a slight inharmonicity. It might just be so slight that we don&apos;t<br/>notice it or can&apos;t hear it.</p><p>Just my theory anyway, but I do think there&apos;s something to<br/>second-order periodicity coming into play. That&apos;s why minor chords can<br/>be perceived as having multiple fundamentals, and they also don&apos;t<br/>sound like completely chaotic polytonal mush.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>&gt; Kalle Aho<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86408 href="#86408">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2010 9:36:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Another sense of &quot;hearing frequency ratios&quot; must be also examined.<br/>&gt; That is the sense that some irrational ratios are purportedly<br/>&gt; perceived as or as substitutes of low-numbered integer ratios as if<br/>&gt; our brains categorized intervals into classes defined by low-numbered<br/>&gt; integer ratios...<br/>   Agreed...<br/>   The question to me then becomes...how high limit do ratios does a chord have to be before the brain starts trying to &quot;round it to low-numbered ratios...and how low must those ratios be not to be interpretted as &quot;noise&quot;?<br/>   For example, take the relatively &quot;irrational&quot; 21:29:35 chord and a 3:4:5 chord...do they sound more or less the same to you...does the brain effectively interpret one chord as the other (at least for the most part)?</p><p>  Now what if you play (with sine waves) a 3:4:5 chord a 4:5:6 chord with the 3 in the first chord and the 4 in the second starting on the same note.

I&apos;m not sure what it sounded like I said, but what I mean is this:</p><p>In the &lt;b&gt;Syntonic temperament&lt;/b&gt;, the generators are the fifth and octave. The Syntonic Temperament defines each tonal/harmonic/diatonic function as a located in the stack of fifths&apos;s reduced into every octave. In order for the described functions to be retained, the fifth can not be above 720 cents or below 686. Above or below these value, fourths overlap with fifths, thirds overlap with fourths, etc. These values are called the Sytonic Temperament&apos;s &quot;Valid Tuning Range&quot;.</p><p>This subject is described here:<br/><a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15">http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15</a></p><p>Other 2D temperaments can have any two generators, but generally they tend to be a tempered variations of just intonation intervals, one of which is almost always the octave, or 2/1. The Syntonic Temperament tempers the 3/2 major fifth, the Magic Temperament tempers the 5/4 major third, and the Hanson Temperament tempers the 6/5 minor third, and so on.</p><p>2D temperaments do not merely define mappings of notes to pitches, but also of partials to pitches, as is described in this paper declaring &quot;The Matrix&quot; as a new parsimonious paradigm for music:<br/><a href="http://www.igetitmusic.com/papers/Matrix.pdf">http://www.igetitmusic.com/papers/Matrix.pdf</a></p><p>Each Temperament defines certain locations within the matrix (or locations in the stack of generators reduced by the period)as the pitches for a partial of a timbre, this allowing for both maximized sensory consonance in the tuning as well as for appropriate harmonic function.</p><p>Consequently there are temperaments other than the Syntonic that also use the functions of the octave and fifth as generators, but map the acquired pitches to different partials. One such temperament is the Schismatic Temperament which, instead of using the major third (or, more specifically, up 4 fifths, down 2 octaves) for triadic harmony, uses the diminished fourth (or down 8 fifths and up 5 octaves). It places the tempered timbres partials differently than the Syntonic Temperament does making each tuning it creates functionally different. It also has a different valid tuning range.</p><p>Is this more clear? I&apos;m not an expert on these subjects, but this has been my understanding.</p><p>John Moriarty</p></div><h3><a id=86411 href="#86411">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2010 10:21:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike B&gt;&quot;Just my theory anyway, but I do think there&apos;s something to second-order periodicity coming into play.

Folks have been<br/>throwing that idea around for a while.</p><p>I&apos;m actually coming up with a model for this now. I think that the<br/>idea is, the chord will have an entire &quot;harmonic profile&quot; that pops up<br/>when it&apos;s heard, which consists of all of the possible periodicities<br/>heard in that chord.</p><p>This seems pretty intuitive when you consider the simple case of the<br/>major chord:</p><p>For a C major chord, for example, there will be 5 total periodic<br/>structures heard: the C itself as a fundamental, the E itself as a<br/>fundamental, the G itself as a fundamental, the C-G dyad as a 2:3, and<br/>the C-E, the E-G, and the C-E-G which all refer to a root 2 octaves<br/>below the C.</p><p>This manifests itself in a very predictable way: you simultaneously<br/>hear the C-E-G as notes themselves, the C-G as a solid dyad with a<br/>root an octave below, the C-E and E-G as solid dyads with roots 2<br/>octaves below, and C-E-G as a solid triad with a rood two octaves<br/>below.</p><p>It seems like a very elegant and intuitive solution to me, and<br/>accurately represents the way I hear a major chord. The whole set of<br/>periodicities I&apos;ve been calling the chord&apos;s &quot;harmonic profile,&quot; the<br/>set minus the periodicities of the notes themselves I&apos;ve been calling<br/>the &quot;subharmonic profile,&quot; and the periodicities of the notes<br/>themselves I&apos;ve been calling the &quot;apparent profile.&quot; Subharmonic<br/>profile + apparent profile = harmonic profile.</p><p>The &quot;apparent profile&quot; of a chord, in short, represents the notes<br/>themselves, without any regard to how they interact. The &quot;subharmonic<br/>profile&quot; refers to everything else. The entire perceptual experience<br/>that we have of a &quot;chord,&quot; I think, is related to the interaction<br/>between the two of these, and with the subharmonic profile with<br/>itself.</p><p>I&apos;ll make a more formal post about this once I can get the math worked<br/>out, but that&apos;s what I&apos;ve been thinking, anyway.</p><p>&gt; It would just, at least IMVHO, be very useful to have a way to, for example, gauge the resolved-ness of things like minor chords beside saying things like &quot;it&apos;s just how the human ear is trained for evolutionary purposes&quot;.

For example, in meantone, 3/2 is approximated by the interval 4 times smaller than the one approximating 5/1, which means that if you do &bdquo;C, A, D, G, C&ldquo; in 5-limit JI, you finish a syntonic comma lower than where you started (i.e. the bass tones being 5/6, 4/3, 2/3, 4/3), while in meantone you end up with the same C with which you started (this is also true for standard notation which is essentially a written representation of meantone). In hanson, the interval approximating 6/5 is 6 times smaller than the one approximating 3/1, which means that if you rise by 6 minor thirds and then fall by a &bdquo;twelfth&ldquo; (although these names actually shouldn&rsquo;t be used outside the meantone context), you finish where you started. This is impossible to represent in standard notation because the kleisma (15625/15552) isn&rsquo;t tempered out in meantone -- i.e. 6 minor thirds minus a twelfth come out as B#, D#, F#, A, C, Eb, Gb, Cb -- and not B#. Similarly, if you convert the original JI sequence of &bdquo;5/6, 4/3, 2/3, 4/3&ldquo; to hanson, you don&rsquo;t arrive at the pitch you started with because the syntonic comma isn&rsquo;t tempered out there.</p><p>Not sure if you&rsquo;ve read my replies to your questions in messages #86312 and #86311 but I think this should give you a lot of answers you were looking for.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=86423 href="#86423">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torsten.anders@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2010 5:45:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear John,</p><p>Thanks for this clarification.

In order for the described functions to be retained, &gt; the fifth can not be above 720 cents or below 686. Above or below &gt; these value, fourths overlap with fifths, thirds overlap with &gt; fourths, etc. These values are called the Sytonic Temperament&apos;s &gt; &quot;Valid Tuning Range&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This subject is described here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15">http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Other 2D temperaments can have any two generators, but generally &gt; they tend to be a tempered variations of just intonation intervals, &gt; one of which is almost always the octave, or 2/1. The Syntonic &gt; Temperament tempers the 3/2 major fifth, the Magic Temperament &gt; tempers the 5/4 major third, and the Hanson Temperament tempers the &gt; 6/5 minor third, and so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2D temperaments do not merely define mappings of notes to pitches, &gt; but also of partials to pitches, as is described in this paper &gt; declaring &quot;The Matrix&quot; as a new parsimonious paradigm for music:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.igetitmusic.com/papers/Matrix.pdf">http://www.igetitmusic.com/papers/Matrix.pdf</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each Temperament defines certain locations within the matrix (or &gt; locations in the stack of generators reduced by the period)as the &gt; pitches for a partial of a timbre, this allowing for both maximized &gt; sensory consonance in the tuning as well as for appropriate harmonic &gt; function.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Consequently there are temperaments other than the Syntonic that &gt; also use the functions of the octave and fifth as generators, but &gt; map the acquired pitches to different partials. One such temperament &gt; is the Schismatic Temperament which, instead of using the major &gt; third (or, more specifically, up 4 fifths, down 2 octaves) for &gt; triadic harmony, uses the diminished fourth (or down 8 fifths and up &gt; 5 octaves). It places the tempered timbres partials differently than &gt; the Syntonic Temperament does making each tuning it creates &gt; functionally different.

Folks have been<br/>throwing that idea around for a while.&quot;<br/>Bizarre thing is...I posted the first message in this thread about a week ago and only now am I getting this answer and/or even a single person mentioning there is evidence for such a theory already being studied.</p><p>  I am not surprised at all that there is, but I have been surprised how many people on this list seem stuck on the idea that the is only one virtual root tone for a &quot;valid&quot; consonant chord (and anyone who thinks otherwise must simply be uneducated).  Finally, it sounds like you may have opened the door on this one. :-)<br/>******************************************************<br/>&gt;&quot;I&apos;m actually coming up with a model for this now. I think that the idea is, the chord will have an entire &quot;harmonic profile&quot; that pops up when it&apos;s heard, which consists of all of the possible periodicities<br/>heard in that chord.&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot;the C-G dyad as a 2:3, and the C-E, the E-G, and the C-E-G which all refer to a root 2 octaves<br/>below the C.&quot;<br/>   Ok, here&apos;s the odd thing (at least as I calculated it), they don&apos;t all seem to point to just one virtual root.<br/>  The C-G indeed seems to point to 2:3 with the virtual pitch being 1/2 or an octave below it IE the 2:4 in (2 virtual pitch):4:5:6.  Meanwhile the C-E dyad seems to imply a harmonic series of 1:2:3:4 leading up to the 4 in 4:5:6...thus representing a 1/4 IE double octave below the root.  The 5:6 also seems to point to the same harmonic series.   So even then, according to my calculations, we have both an octave and a double octave below the 4 in 4:5:6 as virtual root tones.  The only way to get a single virtual root tone then appears to be a 1:2:3 chord, which makes sense since it&apos;s literally is a triad at the root of the harmonic series.</p><p>&gt;&quot;This manifests itself in a very predictable way: you simultaneously hear the C-E-G as notes themselves, the C-G as a solid dyad with a root an octave below, the C-E and E-G as solid dyads with roots 2<br/>octaves below, and C-E-G as a solid triad with a rood two octaves below.&quot;<br/>   Actually there, man I jumped the gun and wrote the above before I read this.  It seems you clarified it yourself it seems...it doesn&apos;t simply point to the one virtual pitch two octaves below, but two tones (one and two octaves below).<br/>********************************************************************************************************<br/>&gt;&quot;Subharmonic profile + apparent profile = harmonic profile.&quot;<br/>    Exactly...and now IMVHO its time to make some good postings about what makes subharmonic tones clash more vs. sound better, how many the brain seems to be able to handle at ones confidently, how &quot;low&quot; a virtual tone can be before the brain loses track of it (esp. if you get very high in the harmonic series far as ratios)...now that we seem to agree how they are derived. :-)<br/>********************************************************************************************************<br/>&gt;&quot;A major triad doesn&apos;t sound &quot;better&quot; than a minor one. It&apos;s just different.&quot;<br/>   True, it&apos;s not &quot;better&quot; but perhaps &quot;tenser&quot; is a better word.  I certainly don&apos;t avoid using minor chords as much or more than major ones in practice, heck I throw in things like chords with semitones at times in personal compositions.</p></div><h3><a id=86428 href="#86428">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2010 10:50:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; He&apos;s a regular mapper (we should make t-shirts).

A more likely explanation is our<br/>&gt; &gt; familiarity with major 7th chords. This kind of explanation is<br/>&gt; &gt; cognitive: hearing major 7ths as 3rd + 5th is based on a mental<br/>&gt; &gt; schema of diatonic structure. Of course such mental schemata<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t have to conform to the logic of rational numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree with that, but if you listen closely enough, you notice that<br/>&gt; often it does. That is, the tritone C-F# can function in a thousand<br/>&gt; possible ways. Play that tritone, then imagine it as part of a D7<br/>&gt; chord. Then imagine it as part of an Ab7 chord. Then imagine it as<br/>&gt; part of a C7#11 chord, and then a Cmaj7#11 chord. Voila, same thing.<br/>&gt; You&apos;re &quot;imagining&quot; different bridges from C to F#.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The only thing is that you treat this purely in psychological terms<br/>&gt; - in terms of mental schemata and such - but I think that it isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; quite so isolated. You have a bit of influence in how you hear a<br/>&gt; chord, and the schema that pops up when you hear it is a part of<br/>&gt; it. Play a 350 cent third and then &quot;imagine&quot; that it&apos;s a really<br/>&gt; flat 6/5, and then &quot;imagine&quot; it as a really flat 5/4. Voila again.<br/>&gt; The same thing is happening here as above. I think what&apos;s happening<br/>&gt; here is that when you imagine other notes in addition to a chord,<br/>&gt; your brain basically analyzes the notes you hear + the ones you<br/>&gt; imagine all together. It just gives the imagined notes less<br/>&gt; &quot;weight,&quot; the same as if they existed in real life but at a lower<br/>&gt; volume.</p><p>If you mean that the higher cognitive level can feed back and have<br/>a &quot;downward&quot; influence on the lower sensory and perceptual levels, I<br/>agree.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes but I really doubt that the interval from C to D# is thereby<br/>&gt; &gt; literally represented in the brain as the ratio 32:75 even if it<br/>&gt; &gt; is tuned so. I&apos;m not even sure if I hear that chord in the way<br/>&gt; &gt; that spelling suggests when it is played alone without any tonal<br/>&gt; &gt; context.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You hear the C-E, the E-B, and the B-D#. If you can&apos;t hear this as a<br/>&gt; coherent chord but rather some dissonant stack of noise, I would<br/>&gt; expect your brain would hear it more as &quot;bitonal&quot; or &quot;polytonal&quot; -<br/>&gt; consisting of multiple harmonic structures - and not have the 32:75.<br/>&gt; However, if you can hear the whole thing as a single harmonic<br/>&gt; structure, I think that would imply the 32:75 has been recognized.</p><p>The hearing of that particular harmonic structure is indeed<br/>&quot;modelled&quot; quite well with rational number math. But although integer<br/>ratios have an important role in the explanation of psychoacoustic<br/>consonance and root perception I suspect that the brain doesn&apos;t<br/>literally use rational number math in the perception and cognition of<br/>music. Not only is this a bit hard to believe but JI doesn&apos;t even<br/>generally work as a theory of music perception because there are many<br/>commonly used chords that cannot be analyzed in terms of JI. Play the<br/>chord A:C:D:G in some meantone tuning, for example 12-equal. A:C is<br/>heard as a minor 3rd, A:D and D:G are heard as 4ths and C:G is heard<br/>as a 5th. The chord sounds perfectly natural and commonplace but it<br/>nevertheless cannot be tuned in JI so that all those intervals<br/>are pure! Ergo, diatonic hearing and structure cannot be modelled<br/>with JI math and this makes the claim that the brain analyzes music<br/>in terms of JI dubious.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I tried this and what a kick-ass experiment it is, really<br/>&gt; &gt; interesting! But I fail to see its&apos; relevance to what I said.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s relevant to what you said here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It doesn&apos;t calculate the relations of frequency ratios further<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than the basic first-order level. Why would it do that? What<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolutionary reason would there be for the existence of such a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; faculty. How would it help in hearing speech sounds for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When you said this, you mentioned that the brain doesn&apos;t &quot;remember&quot;<br/>&gt; previous frequency ratios and that&apos;s why comma pumps don&apos;t cause you<br/>&gt; to become psychotic.</p><p>No, I didn&apos;t say that. Of course the brain remembers previous<br/>intervals to an extent. Tempered comma pump progressions sound fine<br/>because we hear them diatonically.

If you can&apos;t hear this as a<br/>&gt; &gt; coherent chord but rather some dissonant stack of noise, I would<br/>&gt; &gt; expect your brain would hear it more as &quot;bitonal&quot; or &quot;polytonal&quot; -<br/>&gt; &gt; consisting of multiple harmonic structures - and not have the 32:75.<br/>&gt; &gt; However, if you can hear the whole thing as a single harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; structure, I think that would imply the 32:75 has been recognized.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The hearing of that particular harmonic structure is indeed<br/>&gt; &quot;modelled&quot; quite well with rational number math. But although integer<br/>&gt; ratios have an important role in the explanation of psychoacoustic<br/>&gt; consonance and root perception I suspect that the brain doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; literally use rational number math in the perception and cognition of<br/>&gt; music. Not only is this a bit hard to believe but JI doesn&apos;t even<br/>&gt; generally work as a theory of music perception because there are many<br/>&gt; commonly used chords that cannot be analyzed in terms of JI. Play the<br/>&gt; chord A:C:D:G in some meantone tuning, for example 12-equal. A:C is<br/>&gt; heard as a minor 3rd, A:D and D:G are heard as 4ths and C:G is heard<br/>&gt; as a 5th. The chord sounds perfectly natural and commonplace but it<br/>&gt; nevertheless cannot be tuned in JI so that all those intervals<br/>&gt; are pure! Ergo, diatonic hearing and structure cannot be modelled<br/>&gt; with JI math and this makes the claim that the brain analyzes music<br/>&gt; in terms of JI dubious.</p><p>That&apos;s a great example. I figuring out why that chord works is the<br/>same as why my chord progression works.</p><p>Yeah, A:C:D:G (and some other even worse chords I&apos;ve sound) screw it<br/>up. But what I think is happening is the same thing that&apos;s happening<br/>with C-Ev-G: the Ev will tend to &quot;flip&quot; back and forth between Eb and<br/>E, and in this case, the C, D, and G will &quot;flip&quot; back and forth<br/>between C:D:G and C+:D+:G+. However, not only is C:D:G/C+:D+:G+ a much<br/>more subtle change than Eb/E - I don&apos;t think many listeners could<br/>recognize such a perceptual change if they hear it.</p><p>Since it&apos;s easy for us to put a label on the way we&apos;re perceiving the<br/>C-Ev-G example - as the first dyad being &quot;major&quot; (5/4) vs &quot;minor&quot; -<br/>that example is relatively easy to figure out. However - we&apos;re not<br/>used to a system of tuning in which 32/27 and 6/5 are different<br/>intervals, nor in which 4/3 and 27/20 are different intervals, nor in<br/>which 16/9 and 9/5 are different intervals. So my theory is that our<br/>modes of perception for these intervals are constantly shifting<br/>without us really being aware of this. Alternatively, or perhaps it&apos;s<br/>more that our 12-tet experience of a minor seventh just is 16/9 and<br/>9/5 all smushed together.</p><p>So I guess in the end I really am saying what you&apos;re saying, but in a<br/>slightly different way. We do perceive music in terms of more<br/>&quot;diatonic&quot; pitch sets and intervals - at least for now, since that&apos;s<br/>what we&apos;re used to - but these diatonic pitch sets can then be<br/>analyzed in terms of JI. Each equal tempered interval can map back to<br/>more than one JI pitch, but mentally, schematically, we just lump all<br/>of these possible JI functions into the same schema for the chord.</p><p>&gt; &gt; When you said this, you mentioned that the brain doesn&apos;t &quot;remember&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; previous frequency ratios and that&apos;s why comma pumps don&apos;t cause you<br/>&gt; &gt; to become psychotic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, I didn&apos;t say that. Of course the brain remembers previous<br/>&gt; intervals to an extent. Tempered comma pump progressions sound fine<br/>&gt; because we hear them diatonically. There is even a diatonic math that<br/>&gt; models this but it cannot be based on JI. It is actually the JI comma<br/>&gt; pumps that sound weird and &quot;unnatural&quot; to intonationally naive<br/>&gt; western listeners! How can that be if the brain represents music<br/>&gt; in terms of JI?</p><p>Well, one thing&apos;s for sure - you&apos;re absolutely right about that. But<br/>how does the diatonic math work? It can&apos;t just be arbitrary, JI has to<br/>be involved -somewhere- down the line.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=86440 href="#86440">ðŸ”—</a>hpiinstruments &#x3C;aaronhunt@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2010 6:32:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kalle&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt; Play the chord A:C:D:G in some meantone tuning,<br/>&gt; for example 12-equal.

When you&apos;re playing a polytonal<br/>mix of two major chords, is it really one big chord, or two separate chords?<br/>The fact that we &quot;conceive&quot; of a certain harmonic structure as a singular<br/>unit - a &quot;chord&quot; - is a cognitive decision, not a psychoacoustic one.</p><p>All of the noise in the room first enters your ears as one big wash of sound<br/>- there&apos;s no &quot;chord&quot; to be isolated from anything else. Eventually, this<br/>noise gets separated into different frequencies via the cochlear filterbank,<br/>and then is further processed within the auditory and nervous system. But<br/>note that when you hear two people talking at the same time - you are<br/>hearing two different harmonic spectra that have independently fused into<br/>two separate timbres.

Why argue that every interval from every<br/>tone to every other tone in the chord has to sound good in<br/>isolation, as if they weren&apos;t sounding together as a chord? It<br/>doesn&apos;t make much sense. The basic rules of counterpoint don&apos;t<br/>even require that. Things work fine in 3 parts between upper<br/>voices that wouldn&apos;t work in two parts. Both those tunings I<br/>gave for A:C:D:G sound &quot;wicked good&quot;. Who cares if there is a<br/>septimal fourth in one of them that would sound wrong in<br/>isolation. It&apos;s not in isolation. It&apos;s in the chord. Now, voice<br/>the chord differently, in a different inversion or different<br/>register, open voicing, etc. and you may want to change the<br/>tuning again, but there are always a few tunings to find for<br/>any chord in JI.

The rest is all supposition, which doesn&apos;t pass muster<br/>IMO.

If you build<br/>chords of varied timbre then you just have to use common<br/>sense and good taste to make it sound right. That&apos;s<br/>getting into the art of orchestration.

The rest is all supposition, which doesn&apos;t pass muster<br/>&gt; IMO. It&apos;s a matter of seconds to sit down and play all three<br/>&gt; versions of that chord one after the other on a TPX keyboard,<br/>&gt; and they are all beautiful, and all sound different.

But although<br/>&gt; &gt; integer ratios have an important role in the explanation of<br/>&gt; &gt; psychoacoustic consonance and root perception I suspect that the<br/>&gt; &gt; brain doesn&apos;t literally use rational number math in the<br/>&gt; &gt; perception and cognition of music. Not only is this a bit hard to<br/>&gt; &gt; believe but JI doesn&apos;t even generally work as a theory of music<br/>&gt; &gt; perception because there are many commonly used chords that<br/>&gt; &gt; cannot be analyzed in terms of JI. Play the chord A:C:D:G in some<br/>&gt; &gt; meantone tuning, for example 12-equal. A:C is heard as a minor<br/>&gt; &gt; 3rd, A:D and D:G are heard as 4ths and C:G is heard as a 5th. The<br/>&gt; &gt; chord sounds perfectly natural and commonplace but it<br/>&gt; &gt; nevertheless cannot be tuned in JI so that all those intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; are pure! Ergo, diatonic hearing and structure cannot be modelled<br/>&gt; &gt; with JI math and this makes the claim that the brain analyzes<br/>&gt; &gt; music in terms of JI dubious.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a great example. I figuring out why that chord works is the<br/>&gt; same as why my chord progression works.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, A:C:D:G (and some other even worse chords I&apos;ve sound) screw it<br/>&gt; up. But what I think is happening is the same thing that&apos;s happening<br/>&gt; with C-Ev-G: the Ev will tend to &quot;flip&quot; back and forth between Eb<br/>&gt; and E, and in this case, the C, D, and G will &quot;flip&quot; back and forth<br/>&gt; between C:D:G and C+:D+:G+. However, not only is C:D:G/C+:D+:G+ a<br/>&gt; much more subtle change than Eb/E - I don&apos;t think many listeners<br/>&gt; could recognize such a perceptual change if they hear it.</p><p>Personally I don&apos;t hear such duck/rabbit or Necker cube like flipping<br/>at all.</p><p>&gt; Since it&apos;s easy for us to put a label on the way we&apos;re perceiving<br/>&gt; the C-Ev-G example - as the first dyad being &quot;major&quot; (5/4)<br/>&gt; vs &quot;minor&quot; - that example is relatively easy to figure out.<br/>&gt; However - we&apos;re not used to a system of tuning in which 32/27 and<br/>&gt; 6/5 are different intervals, nor in which 4/3 and 27/20 are<br/>&gt; different intervals, nor in which 16/9 and 9/5 are different<br/>&gt; intervals. So my theory is that our modes of perception for these<br/>&gt; intervals are constantly shifting without us really being aware of<br/>&gt; this. Alternatively, or perhaps it&apos;s more that our 12-tet<br/>&gt; experience of a minor seventh just is 16/9 and 9/5 all smushed<br/>&gt; together.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I guess in the end I really am saying what you&apos;re saying, but in<br/>&gt; a slightly different way. We do perceive music in terms of more<br/>&gt; &quot;diatonic&quot; pitch sets and intervals - at least for now, since that&apos;s<br/>&gt; what we&apos;re used to - but these diatonic pitch sets can then be<br/>&gt; analyzed in terms of JI. Each equal tempered interval can map back<br/>&gt; to more than one JI pitch, but mentally, schematically, we just<br/>&gt; lump all of these possible JI functions into the same schema for<br/>&gt; the chord.</p><p>We could model the diatonic way of hearing with 5-limit JI math but<br/>with the additional rule that (81/80)*r=r, syntonic comma being<br/>an &quot;identity element&quot;. But this is potentially misleading because one<br/>might then think that &quot;syntonically equivalent&quot; ratios are actually<br/>heard (flipping) when one hears an interval in the context of music<br/>tuned to meantone. But it can&apos;t be so because there is an infinity<br/>of syntonically equivalent ratios. It would have to stop at<br/>some &quot;depth&quot; and I suspect that most diatonic listeners don&apos;t hear<br/>much depth at all. Perhaps somebody who has deeply internalized JI<br/>pitch relations would hear intervals as flipping all the time when<br/>listening to music tuned to meantone but in a sense he/she would be<br/>hearing the music in a &quot;wrong&quot; way.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; When you said this, you mentioned that the brain<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t &quot;remember&quot; previous frequency ratios and that&apos;s why<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; comma pumps don&apos;t cause you to become psychotic.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No, I didn&apos;t say that. Of course the brain remembers previous<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals to an extent. Tempered comma pump progressions sound<br/>&gt; &gt; fine because we hear them diatonically. There is even a diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; math that models this but it cannot be based on JI. It is<br/>&gt; &gt; actually the JI comma pumps that sound weird and &quot;unnatural&quot; to<br/>&gt; &gt; intonationally naive western listeners! How can that be if the<br/>&gt; &gt; brain represents music in terms of JI?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, one thing&apos;s for sure - you&apos;re absolutely right about that.<br/>&gt; But how does the diatonic math work? It can&apos;t just be arbitrary, JI<br/>&gt; has to be involved -somewhere- down the line.</p><p>Actually anybody who is interested in non-meantone temperaments or<br/>composes JI music where the syntonic comma functions as a distinct<br/>interval *assumes* that syntonic equivalence is arbitrary i.e. a<br/>matter of choice. For them, syntonic equivalence is not some<br/>&quot;eternal axiom of musicke&quot; but just one (valid) way of hearing.</p><p>How is JI involved then?</p><p>For arguments sake, take the 12-equal C major scale as a given. Now<br/>don&apos;t think of its&apos; fifths, minor thirds and major thirds as 2:3s,<br/>5:6s and 4:5s but simply as 12-equal fifths, minor thirds and major<br/>thirds. After all, they aren&apos;t acoustically 2:3s, 5:6s or 4:5s! Try<br/>to think of them as intervals of their own, not as approximations.<br/>D:A really is a 12-equal fifth even if JI C major scale doesn&apos;t have<br/>a pure 2:3 fifth there. There are structural properties, intervals<br/>and chords that don&apos;t exist in JI and they are really there<br/>acoustically!</p><p>The (relatively mediocre) consonance of 12-equal intervals and chords<br/>is explained by their proximity to purely tuned intervals and chords.<br/>Also 12-equal pitches can form approximate harmonic series segments<br/>which explains the perception of roots. I believe this is the only<br/>way JI is involved.</p><p>Searching for alternative temperaments often starts with a JI lattice<br/>of pitches. Then some commas are tempered out and the lattice<br/>is &quot;collapsed&quot; to lower dimensions. Even if this is done, one should<br/>resist the temptation to think that the JI lattice is somehow still<br/>there in the resulting temperament. After all, you can start from the<br/>opposite direction and find temperaments from equal divisions.</p><p>Kalle Aho</p></div><h3><a id=86472 href="#86472">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2010 7:37:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kalle&gt;&quot;A:C is heard as a minor 3rd, A:D and D:G are heard as 4ths and C:G is heard<br/>as a 5th.

There<br/>&gt; &gt; are many spooky correspondences between numbers<br/>&gt; &gt; and what we hear, for sure, but IMO they are to JI what<br/>&gt; &gt; relativity is to Newtonian mechanics... not well worded,<br/>&gt; &gt; but I think you get my point.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; &gt; AAH<br/>&gt; &gt; =====<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86487 href="#86487">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2010 9:25:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; The other point is that there are chords that sound good<br/>&gt;&gt; which you wouldn&apos;t discover drawing on just intonation alone.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>Aaron Hunt&gt;Of course.

No matter how justified the excuse to censor something for lack of correctness on any musical forum...what will quite likely happen is people overlooking the list will think &quot;looks like this guy/censored can&apos;t disprove the validity of this in detail, otherwise why would he/she suddenly label so many things off-topic?&quot;<br/>   I admit I have been guilty of jumping the gun and saying something is dead wrong or perfectly right at first glance as well only to find otherwise later on.<br/>----------------------------------------<br/>    Now I try my best to be very careful and remember tuning is ultimately part of music and music is highly subjective in many ways.  Otherwise there would be one formula to make songs everyone likes (and we could sell it to a major label for some ridiculous sum of money...or, better yet, take them down by making it &apos;open-source&apos;&quot;). :-D</p><p>  And if anything truly has virtually no applications or value it need not be &quot;censored out&quot;: it will simply generate less and less interest.<br/>  Such as was true with a scale I &apos;made&apos; years ago which turned out to just be the x/16 harmonic series.  Meanwhile another scale people at first jumped at as being absurd, the &quot;Silver section&quot; scale actually got brought back by others even after I abandoned it.</p><p>  It seems obvious to me we should rate ideas on here as more/less likely to work rather than &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;...because, ultimately, some initially conceived as &quot;more wrong&quot; ideas may prove themselves &quot;more right&quot; and vice-versa.  Some ideas, like JI, are always going to be around b/c so many people think they are &quot;more right/applicable than wrong/inapplicable&quot;...but that doesn&apos;t mean other ideas instantly become &quot;off-topic&quot; or can&apos;t grow into something equally useful.</p><p>  The best way to make progress in tuning, IMVHO, is to keep your mind open and let things prove (or disprove) themselves.  And, IMVHO, psychoacoustic properties of temperament sounds like something that could easily become &quot;more right&quot; within the subject of tuning if people work on it and are allowed to do so in peace.

Ergo, diatonic hearing and structure cannot be modelled<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; with JI math and this makes the claim that the brain analyzes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; music in terms of JI dubious.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s a great example. I figuring out why that chord works is the<br/>&gt; &gt; same as why my chord progression works.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yeah, A:C:D:G (and some other even worse chords I&apos;ve sound) screw it<br/>&gt; &gt; up. But what I think is happening is the same thing that&apos;s happening<br/>&gt; &gt; with C-Ev-G: the Ev will tend to &quot;flip&quot; back and forth between Eb<br/>&gt; &gt; and E, and in this case, the C, D, and G will &quot;flip&quot; back and forth<br/>&gt; &gt; between C:D:G and C+:D+:G+. However, not only is C:D:G/C+:D+:G+ a<br/>&gt; &gt; much more subtle change than Eb/E - I don&apos;t think many listeners<br/>&gt; &gt; could recognize such a perceptual change if they hear it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Personally I don&apos;t hear such duck/rabbit or Necker cube like flipping<br/>&gt; at all.</p><p>In C:Ev:G, or in A:C:D:G? What I&apos;m saying is that you wouldn&apos;t notice<br/>the necker-cube like flipping in A:C:D:G, since the intervals it could<br/>be perceived as are so similar. There is, however, a huge difference<br/>between C-E-G and C-Eb-G.</p><p>&gt; We could model the diatonic way of hearing with 5-limit JI math but<br/>&gt; with the additional rule that (81/80)*r=r, syntonic comma being<br/>&gt; an &quot;identity element&quot;. But this is potentially misleading because one<br/>&gt; might then think that &quot;syntonically equivalent&quot; ratios are actually<br/>&gt; heard (flipping) when one hears an interval in the context of music<br/>&gt; tuned to meantone. But it can&apos;t be so because there is an infinity<br/>&gt; of syntonically equivalent ratios. It would have to stop at<br/>&gt; some &quot;depth&quot; and I suspect that most diatonic listeners don&apos;t hear<br/>&gt; much depth at all. Perhaps somebody who has deeply internalized JI<br/>&gt; pitch relations would hear intervals as flipping all the time when<br/>&gt; listening to music tuned to meantone but in a sense he/she would be<br/>&gt; hearing the music in a &quot;wrong&quot; way.</p><p>Well, it isn&apos;t like that with a 400 cent interval you&apos;ll hear it<br/>flipping between 5/4, 5/4 * 81/80, 5/4 * 81/80 * 81/80, etc. With a<br/>400 cent interval in isolation - you&apos;ll probably hear it as 5/4. What<br/>I&apos;m saying is that in a specific musical context, you might hear a<br/>tempered interval one way, and in a different context, you might hear<br/>it another.</p><p>If you mess around in 7-tet for a bit, you&apos;ll note that there are<br/>times in which you hear elements of &quot;majorness&quot; and &quot;minorness&quot;<br/>popping out of the mix, even though all triads are tuned the same. I<br/>think this applies to 12-tet as well, although if you have no prior<br/>experience with JI - would you even notice?</p><p>&gt; For them, syntonic equivalence is not some<br/>&gt; &quot;eternal axiom of musicke&quot; but just one (valid) way of hearing.</p><p>Hahaha!</p><p>&gt; How is JI involved then?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For arguments sake, take the 12-equal C major scale as a given. Now<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think of its&apos; fifths, minor thirds and major thirds as 2:3s,<br/>&gt; 5:6s and 4:5s but simply as 12-equal fifths, minor thirds and major<br/>&gt; thirds. After all, they aren&apos;t acoustically 2:3s, 5:6s or 4:5s! Try<br/>&gt; to think of them as intervals of their own, not as approximations.<br/>&gt; D:A really is a 12-equal fifth even if JI C major scale doesn&apos;t have<br/>&gt; a pure 2:3 fifth there. There are structural properties, intervals<br/>&gt; and chords that don&apos;t exist in JI and they are really there<br/>&gt; acoustically!</p><p>I think you&apos;re right with this. So from the standpoint that a chord is<br/>really a harmonic structure - would that then mean that &quot;magic chords&quot;<br/>with commas tempered out of them really just indicate a very slightly<br/>inharmonic structure? Kind of like Sethares&apos; retuning of timbres to<br/>temper out 81/80 and so forth?</p><p>So perhaps in that regard - the question really turns into one of how<br/>inharmonic timbres are perceived.</p><p>&gt; Searching for alternative temperaments often starts with a JI lattice<br/>&gt; of pitches. Then some commas are tempered out and the lattice<br/>&gt; is &quot;collapsed&quot; to lower dimensions. Even if this is done, one should<br/>&gt; resist the temptation to think that the JI lattice is somehow still<br/>&gt; there in the resulting temperament. After all, you can start from the<br/>&gt; opposite direction and find temperaments from equal divisions.</p><p>Alright, I think that what you&apos;re saying is true. But I do think that<br/>in some way, shape or form JI influences are still &quot;present&quot; in the<br/>end result, given that you can hear harmonic relationships in<br/>inharmonic intervals. As you yourself said, 3/2 isn&apos;t even there in<br/>12-tet, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be able to distinguish a JI 3/2 from a<br/>12-tet 3/2 if I tried, except for some beating.</p><p>Either way your point is well taken. So I guess I got what I wanted<br/>out of this thread then. I&apos;ll have to do some more thinking about all<br/>of this, and thanks for the insight.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>&gt; Kalle Aho<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86504 href="#86504">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2010 1:04:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m saying those things embody core simplicities to which all tunings<br/>&gt; have an inescapable relationship.</p><p>All tunings?

However, within<br/>the context of other intervals referring to the &quot;actual&quot; 1 of the<br/>9:11, such as 8:9, 9:10, 10:11, etc, the perception of it as 9:11 is<br/>strengthened, and so on.</p><p>It isn&apos;t quite as linear as just analyzing the separate dyads and<br/>adding them together.

That&apos;s<br/>certainly a huge strength of tempered systems. Do things in<br/>JI and to change harmonic context you have to retune the<br/>chord.

I gave<br/>&gt; a link to the previous thread for a reason (why do people<br/>&gt; consistently ignore links I give for specific purposes?)</p><p>It&apos;s not that I haven&apos;t read the message. In fact, I&apos;ve read it on the day you posted it. It&apos;s that it doesn&apos;t answer my question. Before the phenomenon of chords appeared, Pythagorean tuning was an excellent choice because 1) the &quot;trine&quot; of 2:3:4 was understood as the most stable of all and 2) the fifth of 3/2 splits the octave (i.e. the equivalence interval) into two &quot;linearly equidistant&quot; steps (not exponentially), which slightly amplifies the relative frequency of 1 in this trine (i.e. the GCD is 1, 3-2 is 1, and 4-3 is 1). However, during the 16th century, the meaning of the prime 5 was highly promoted because of the new phenomenon of chords. On one hand, it became apparent that music based on chords sounded better with thirds of 5/4 and 6/5 than with 81/64 and 32/27 (a major third in a triad has a different meaning than a &quot;ditone&quot; which was considered unstable and required resolution to a stable interval). OTOH, since both the GCD and the difference frequency of a perfect fifth is an octave equivalent of the lower sounding tone (i.e. 1 octave lower) and is clearly audible, many people still insisted to keep the concept of a chain of fifths which had served for centuries. Of course, when the chains of fifths were large enough, when combined with the number 5, this lead to the problem of either having pairs of close pitches (differing by 81/80) or mistuned fifths or both. This is why meantone was eventually accepted as &quot;the solution&quot;, although there are many possible solutions -- i.e. since it all began with Pythagorean tuning back in the 3-limit age, the chain of fifths seemed to be the correct choice preferred over a chain of anything else. But the fact is that 5-limit JI is 3-dimmensional and you can get a 2D tuning out of it by tempering out any interval you want (or an 1D tuning if you temper out two intervals). And there&apos;s no explicit reason why tempering out 81/80 should be &quot;more obviously derived from the basic intervals&quot; than tempering out 15625/15552 apart from the fact that a chain of fifths may look similar to Pythagorean tuning while a chain of minor thirds does not.</p><p>Let me give you two examples. First, let&apos;s say we start with a tone of D5 and we keep lowering it alternately by 6/5 and 5/4 until we&apos;ve done 7 pitch changes. So we get D5, B4, G4, E4, C4, A3, F3, D3. Since we used thirds of 6/5 and 5/4 rather than some tempered thirds, our final D3 comes out as 20/81, which is a syntonic comma lower than 1/4. Interestingly enough, if we narrow each third by 1/7 of the comma and reduce the result into a single octave range, we get a diatonic scale of 2/7-comma meantone (i.e. 5 major seconds + 2 minor seconds) where 4 fifths are 1/7-comma smaller than 5/1 and where 3 fifths are 1/7-comma wider than 10/3.</p><p>Now let&apos;s say we start with a tone of, for example, B#5 and we keep lowering it alternately by 5/4 and 4/3 until we&apos;ve done 11 pitch changes. Since standard notation is based on chains of fifths (i.e. it was meant to represent either Pythagorean or meantone), the notes would then come out as B#5, G#5, D#5, B4, F#4, D4, A3, F3, C3, Ab2, Eb2, Cb2. The final Cb2 compared to the B#5 is 972/15625, which is only a kleisma (15625/15552) lower than 1/16, or 4 octaves falling. If we narrow each third or fourth, respectively, by 1/11 of the kleisma and reduce the result into a single octave range, we get the 11-tone &quot;quasi-diatonic&quot; version of hanson (i.e. 7 small and 4 large intervals) where 6 minor thirds (if I use the conventional name) are 1/11-kleisma wider than 3/1 and where 5 minor thirds are 11-kleisma smaller than 5/2.</p><p>Both of these examples are equally valid in explaining approximating JI, in explaining the phenomenon of tempering, and in explaining possible development of certain harmonic progressions reflecting this (like the often discussed &quot;C major, A minor, D minor, G major, C major&quot; in the case of meantone).</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=86543 href="#86543">ðŸ”—</a>hpiinstruments &#x3C;aaronhunt@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2010 9:45:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Petr.</p><p>Thanks for writing.</p><p>First, it&apos;s good that you know the things you know, and<br/>you do a fine job explaining them, but honestly, and for<br/>heaven&apos;s sake, do you really think I need a history lesson<br/>in tuning theory? Good grief, I know historical tuning<br/>theory inside and out; thanks and no offense. As a small<br/>correction, chords didn&apos;t all of a sudden &apos;appear&apos; in the<br/>16th century; harmony has been experimental since<br/>the beginning of recorded music history.

Before the phenomenon of chords appeared, Pythagorean tuning was an excellent choice because 1) the &quot;trine&quot; of 2:3:4 was understood as the most stable of all and 2) the fifth of 3/2 splits the octave (i.e. the equivalence interval) into two &quot;linearly equidistant&quot; steps (not exponentially), which slightly amplifies the relative frequency of 1 in this trine (i.e. the GCD is 1, 3-2 is 1, and 4-3 is 1). However, during the 16th century, the meaning of the prime 5 was highly promoted because of the new phenomenon of chords. On one hand, it became apparent that music based on chords sounded better with thirds of 5/4 and 6/5 than with 81/64 and 32/27 (a major third in a triad has a different meaning than a &quot;ditone&quot; which was considered unstable and required resolution to a stable interval). OTOH, since both the GCD and the difference frequency of a perfect fifth is an octave equivalent of the lower sounding tone (i.e. 1 octave lower) and is clearly audible, many people still insisted to keep the concept of a chain of fifths which had served for centuries. Of course, when the chains of fifths were large enough, when combined with the number 5, this lead to the problem of either having pairs of close pitches (differing by 81/80) or mistuned fifths or both. This is why meantone was eventually accepted as &quot;the solution&quot;, although there are many possible solutions -- i.e. since it all began with Pythagorean tuning back in the 3-limit age, the chain of fifths seemed to be the correct choice preferred over a chain of anything else. But the fact is that 5-limit JI is 3-dimmensional and you can get a 2D tuning out of it by tempering out any interval you want (or an 1D tuning if you temper out two intervals). And there&apos;s no explicit reason why tempering out 81/80 should be &quot;more obviously derived from the basic intervals&quot; than tempering out 15625/15552 apart from the fact that a chain of fifths may look similar to Pythagorean tuning while a chain of minor thirds does not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let me give you two examples. First, let&apos;s say we start with a tone of D5 and we keep lowering it alternately by 6/5 and 5/4 until we&apos;ve done 7 pitch changes. So we get D5, B4, G4, E4, C4, A3, F3, D3. Since we used thirds of 6/5 and 5/4 rather than some tempered thirds, our final D3 comes out as 20/81, which is a syntonic comma lower than 1/4. Interestingly enough, if we narrow each third by 1/7 of the comma and reduce the result into a single octave range, we get a diatonic scale of 2/7-comma meantone (i.e. 5 major seconds + 2 minor seconds) where 4 fifths are 1/7-comma smaller than 5/1 and where 3 fifths are 1/7-comma wider than 10/3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now let&apos;s say we start with a tone of, for example, B#5 and we keep lowering it alternately by 5/4 and 4/3 until we&apos;ve done 11 pitch changes. Since standard notation is based on chains of fifths (i.e. it was meant to represent either Pythagorean or meantone), the notes would then come out as B#5, G#5, D#5, B4, F#4, D4, A3, F3, C3, Ab2, Eb2, Cb2. The final Cb2 compared to the B#5 is 972/15625, which is only a kleisma (15625/15552) lower than 1/16, or 4 octaves falling. If we narrow each third or fourth, respectively, by 1/11 of the kleisma and reduce the result into a single octave range, we get the 11-tone &quot;quasi-diatonic&quot; version of hanson (i.e. 7 small and 4 large intervals) where 6 minor thirds (if I use the conventional name) are 1/11-kleisma wider than 3/1 and where 5 minor thirds are 11-kleisma smaller than 5/2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Both of these examples are equally valid in explaining approximating JI, in explaining the phenomenon of tempering, and in explaining possible development of certain harmonic progressions reflecting this (like the often discussed &quot;C major, A minor, D minor, G major, C major&quot; in the case of meantone).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86544 href="#86544">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2010 10:53:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Personally I don&apos;t hear such duck/rabbit or Necker cube like<br/>&gt; &gt; flipping at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In C:Ev:G, or in A:C:D:G? What I&apos;m saying is that you wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; notice the necker-cube like flipping in A:C:D:G, since the<br/>&gt; intervals it could be perceived as are so similar. There is,<br/>&gt; however, a huge difference between C-E-G and C-Eb-G.</p><p>In A:C:D:G.</p><p>&gt; Well, it isn&apos;t like that with a 400 cent interval you&apos;ll hear it<br/>&gt; flipping between 5/4, 5/4 * 81/80, 5/4 * 81/80 * 81/80, etc. With a<br/>&gt; 400 cent interval in isolation - you&apos;ll probably hear it as 5/4.<br/>&gt; What I&apos;m saying is that in a specific musical context, you might<br/>&gt; hear a tempered interval one way, and in a different context, you<br/>&gt; might hear it another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you mess around in 7-tet for a bit, you&apos;ll note that there are<br/>&gt; times in which you hear elements of &quot;majorness&quot; and &quot;minorness&quot;<br/>&gt; popping out of the mix, even though all triads are tuned the same. I<br/>&gt; think this applies to 12-tet as well, although if you have no prior<br/>&gt; experience with JI - would you even notice?</p><p>I&apos;d say that a (hypothetical) person whose musical mother tongue was<br/>strict JI would probably hear such flipping in A:C:D:G because she<br/>would listen it within a strict JI template. I tend to hear the<br/>neutral third as major or minor and think that this is the same<br/>phenomenon. My brain is trying to fit the neutral third into the<br/>diatonic category of third which is supposed to come in two<br/>varieties, minor and major. This is the phenomenon of categorical<br/>perception, for example many Japanese can&apos;t hear the difference<br/>between /l/ and /r/. Once when I took a course in Swedish my teacher<br/>tried to teach me the difference between two versions of the<br/>vowel /y/ (or was it /u/, I&apos;m not sure). I just kept staring at her<br/>because I heard no difference. :D</p><p>I feel that categorical perception is a much more important thing to<br/>consider for microtonalists than it is often taken to be. Of course<br/>it is not so important if one is working with &quot;recognizable diatonic<br/>tunings&quot; (Easley Blackwood&apos;s term) as intervals are then supposed to<br/>be heard in diatonic terms as minor and major thirds and sixths,<br/>diminished and perfect fifths and so on.</p><p>It is very easy to hear 6:7 and 7:9 as some kinds of minor and major<br/>thirds but if you look at table 1 in Paul Erlich&apos;s 22-tone paper you<br/>see that the 22-equal approximation of 6:7 is a major 3rd(10) while<br/>~5:6 is a minor 4th(10). ~7:9 is an aug. 4th(10) or a dim. 5th(10)<br/>while ~4:5 is a major 4th(10). If you want to hear decatonically, you<br/>must hear the ~6:7 as belonging to the same generic interval category<br/>of 3rd(10) as ~7:8/~8:9. I really hope it is not as hard as learning<br/>new phonemes!</p><p>I wonder if people who listen and play a lot of octatonic (diminished<br/>scale) music have learned some kind of octatonic template. I often<br/>hear octatonic passages as undergoing modulation even when they stay<br/>within one octatonic collection.</p><p>&gt; I think you&apos;re right with this. So from the standpoint that a chord<br/>&gt; is really a harmonic structure - would that then mean that &quot;magic<br/>&gt; chords&quot; with commas tempered out of them really just indicate a<br/>&gt; very slightly inharmonic structure? Kind of like Sethares&apos; retuning<br/>&gt; of timbres to temper out 81/80 and so forth?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So perhaps in that regard - the question really turns into one of<br/>&gt; how inharmonic timbres are perceived.</p><p>I guess so, the spectra of all tempered chords really are inharmonic<br/>even when they approximate harmonic series.</p><p>&gt; thanks for the insight.</p><p>The pleasure is mine!</p><p>Kalle Aho</p></div><h3><a id=86545 href="#86545">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2010 11:46:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I&apos;d say that a (hypothetical) person whose musical mother tongue was<br/>&gt; strict JI would probably hear such flipping in A:C:D:G<br/>&gt;</p><p>I just played A:C:D:G as 5/3 2/1 9/4 3/1<br/>And then my ear heard a F# as in mode.<br/>So I mistuned it and even then my ear/brain heard/interpreted it as the most<br/>logical solution.<br/>Which is 27/16 2/1 9/4 3/1, and the F# would be 45/16 making it a dominant<br/>7th chord.</p><p>To hear A:C:D:G as 5/3 2/1 9/4 3/1:<br/>5/3 2/1 9/4 3/1<br/>5/3 2/1 9/4 8/3<br/>3/2 15/8 9/4 8/3<br/>1/1 3/2 2/1 5/2</p><p>There is no flipflopping, it&apos;s the mode / notes that came previously or<br/>later that make clear to the brain which tuning it is even if the ear can&apos;t<br/>hear it.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=86546 href="#86546">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2010 12:42:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Hm, I think a neutral triad with an 11/9 third sounds very round and smooth. Just half an hour ago I introduced a guy with a very good ear and traditional European childhood music school training to microtonality- his unsolicited opinion of 11/9 alone and in a triad with 3/2 was also &quot;smooth/soft&quot;. Of course it not possible around here not to hear microtonal Balkan music, so a neutral third isn&apos;t a complete stranger to anyone, but still, I suspect that a person has to learn to hear an 11/9 as rough. The guy recognized 11/8 immediately as an &quot;in tune augmented fourth&quot;, which is quite interesting come to think of it.</p><p>I didn&apos;t mean that 11/9 was synesthetically &quot;rough&quot; or anything like<br/>that, just that it&apos;s hard to swallow for those of us not used to it.<br/>It does have a fairly &quot;smooth&quot; sound, but especially in lower<br/>registers, I tend to just hear it as a really sharp minor triad or a<br/>really flat major triad, with it flipping back and forth.</p><p>But again, what you say here is more anecdotal evidence supporting<br/>what I&apos;ve believed for a while: that you can be &quot;trained&quot; to recognize<br/>the order in higher-entropy intervals.</p><p>&gt; I did have a &quot;shredding&quot; &quot;jazz&quot; pianist complain that 5/4 sounds dreadfully flat, the one and only such experience I can remember, everyone else I&apos;ve ever &quot;tested&quot; has always found Just intervals, including higher limits, to sound &quot;soft&quot;, &quot;ancient&quot;, &quot;ethnic&quot;, and so on. :-) Oh, and 7/4 is almost 100% guaranteed to get the response &quot;blues!&quot;, which is quite telling I think.</p><p>Well, I&apos;m a jazz pianist. And, in certain circles, one could say that<br/>I &quot;shred.&quot; And now that I&apos;ve destroyed all perception of humility for<br/>myself, I might as well weigh in and say that sometimes, especially at<br/>first, 5/4 did sound dreadfully flat. However, this has to do with the<br/>fact that as Kalle mentioned, us jazz guys tend to take the 400 cent<br/>interval as being a lot more than just a 5/4 - its use as 81/64 is<br/>very common (as in the tendency of jazz musicians to use quartal and<br/>quintal chords), and probably some other intuitive ways to use that<br/>interval that I&apos;m not thinking of. That was one of the main problems<br/>for me at first - I tended to always think in terms of the circle of<br/>fifths. It&apos;s also a bit too flat to create much tension as a leading<br/>tone.</p><p>Nowadays I actually do like 5/4 quite a bit, but I&apos;d prefer 81/32 for<br/>a chord like C G Bb+ D F+ A C+ E, or 32/21 for a chord like C F Bb Eb<br/>G.</p><p>As for 7/4, my response as well as that of my friends at school was<br/>that it was also very &quot;flat&quot; at first, since were used to thinking of<br/>a minor seventh as being accessible via the circle of fourths if<br/>necessary. Nowadays I just hear it as a separate animal from the usual<br/>12-tet &quot;minor seventh&quot; though.</p><p>&gt; 9/7 is another interval I hear as quite smooth, but personally I also need it in context, because I find it exceedingly pushy- not unstable as far as spectra, but very aggressive as far as wanting to go somewhere. An interval I have a hard time with, a kind of bully that doesn&apos;t often play well in tunings.</p><p>Just curious, have you written many pieces making extensive use of<br/>this interval? I have only heard one piece of yours, a vocal<br/>composition from a long time ago.

So generally one<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; needs to chain several instances of a softsynth together,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and use a MIDI split to send, say, the bottom 3 octaves<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; to instance 1 and the top 3 to instance 2.

I often<br/>&gt; hear octatonic passages as undergoing modulation even when they stay<br/>&gt; within one octatonic collection.</p><p> I use this scale all the time in my compositions, and I think it&apos;s a very,<br/>very cool sound. Harmonically, I still tend to think of it diatonically,<br/>with it being a dom7 with certain extensions - b/#9, maj13, #11, etc.<br/>However, there are ways to emphasize it&apos;s &quot;octatonic&quot;ness as well. For<br/>example, over a C aux. diminished scale, play the fourth Db-F#, and then<br/>transpose it up octatonically stepwise. So Db-F#, Eb-G, E-A, F#-Bb, etc.<br/>That&apos;ll shake it up a bit.</p><p>I can vouch from personal experience that at school, guys would be<br/>practicing symmetrical octatonic patterns until the wee hours of the<br/>morning. Teachers would actually assign patterns for students to learn. And<br/>in general Jazz guys -love- stuff like this, because it&apos;s a break from the<br/>&quot;usual&quot; diatonic perception of things. Finding breaks from the &quot;usual&quot;<br/>diatonic perception of things in 12-tet is pretty much all that jazz seems<br/>to be about these days, since we&apos;re all bored to tears of the &quot;usual&quot; stuff.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=86589 href="#86589">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2010 11:59:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kalle wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;d say that a (hypothetical) person whose musical mother tongue was<br/>&gt; strict JI would probably hear such flipping in A:C:D:G because she<br/>&gt; would listen it within a strict JI template. I tend to hear the<br/>&gt; neutral third as major or minor and think that this is the same<br/>&gt; phenomenon. My brain is trying to fit the neutral third into the<br/>&gt; diatonic category of third which is supposed to come in two<br/>&gt; varieties, minor and major.</p><p>What you said is true, but I think there are certain cases in 12-tet<br/>even to a 12-tet &quot;native&quot; where you can hear the difference.</p><p>Consider this example: C Eb+ G Bb+ D F+ A C+<br/>vs this one: C E- G B- D F#- A C#-</p><p>Note that the examples are closely related: one is a stack of minor<br/>and major thirds, and the other is a stack of major and minor thirds.</p><p>In 12-tet, the C# on top of the second example clearly sounds like<br/>some kind of extension of the chord, and in JI, it would be - it would<br/>be 135/64. In 12-tet, the C on top also &quot;feels&quot; like some kind of<br/>extension of the chord, and in JI, it also would be, as 81/40. However<br/>- in 12-tet this same interval is also tempered to be equal to the octave.</p><p>And if you play the chord for long enough, the fact that that C-C dyad<br/>is a perfect 4/1 will stand out to you, and change your perception of<br/>things a bit - with that C on top starting to just sound like a benign<br/>octave doubling of the root and not really adding any new &quot;color.&quot;</p><p>The same thing doesn&apos;t happen with the C E G B D F# A C# example in<br/>12tet. There is absolutely no question in anyone&apos;s mind that that C#<br/>is a unique chord extension, not just some &quot;doubling at the octave,&quot;<br/>and for pretty obvious reasons. But because the parallel of the C# in<br/>the first chord is a C natural in 12tet - the perception flips of it between<br/>being a unique chord extension (the minor third above the A is prioritized<br/>as the &ldquo;figure&rdquo;) and just a low-entropy, benign, octave doubling of the root<br/>(the 4/1 above the C is prioritized as the &ldquo;figure&rdquo;).</p><p>Maybe this is just me, because my jazz background preempts me to &quot;find<br/>routes&quot; between complex intervals subconsciously as part of the way I<br/>improvise. Or maybe this is universal. I don&apos;t know.</p><p>&gt; It is very easy to hear 6:7 and 7:9 as some kinds of minor and major<br/>&gt; thirds but if you look at table 1 in Paul Erlich&apos;s 22-tone paper you<br/>&gt; see that the 22-equal approximation of 6:7 is a major 3rd(10) while<br/>&gt; ~5:6 is a minor 4th(10). ~7:9 is an aug. 4th(10) or a dim. 5th(10)<br/>&gt; while ~4:5 is a major 4th(10). If you want to hear decatonically, you<br/>&gt; must hear the ~6:7 as belonging to the same generic interval category<br/>&gt; of 3rd(10) as ~7:8/~8:9. I really hope it is not as hard as learning<br/>&gt; new phonemes!</p><p>Well, think about the 12-tet &quot;altered scale&quot; - C Db Eb Fb Gb Ab Bb C.<br/>This is used in jazz all the time as a dominant chord, especially<br/>leading to a minor chord. This is because jazz musicians often tend to<br/>think of it more as C Db D# E F# Ab Bb C - with the Fb as a major third.</p><p>The fact that that major third &quot;should&quot; be spelled as an Fb, implying<br/>that it&apos;s 32/25 or something, didn&apos;t really matter to guys who were<br/>just doing this for fun. So, the diesis vanishes, and it becomes a major<br/>third.</p><p>Contrast that with the interpretation of the same scale as an &quot;even<br/>more&quot; locrian mode with a diminished fourth. If you play it in that<br/>&quot;context&quot; mentally, it&apos;s easy to come up with some ultra-dissonant,<br/>much darker interpretations of the scale, and create voicings and<br/>progressions in which that E sounds very, very, very dissonant and<br/>almost unnaturally so.</p><p>So I would say that decatonically the same thing will happen. The<br/>option to just hear the 7/6 as a type of third will always be there.<br/>The only difference is that now you have this new &quot;option&quot; in which<br/>you can hear it in other ways, which didn&apos;t exist before.</p><p>- Mike</p></div><h3><a id=86591 href="#86591">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2010 1:08:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/magic/tripod.pdf">http://x31eq.com/magic/tripod.pdf</a></p><p>I found this, do you have a link to sound files?

You shouldn&apos;t draw<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; battle lines, as you have in the past, about my &apos;refusal to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; support the only microtonal corporation in the world&apos;. And<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; probably, if you wanted to sell instruments to microtonalists,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; you should have bothered to understand the microtonal theory<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; developed on the largest and longest-lived hangout for<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; microtonalists in the world before plowing ahead with your<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; own keyboard and notation ideas.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; As for Caleb&apos;s needs, he clearly stated that he&apos;s looking to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; abandon hardware and go for a softsynth-based studio. Which<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; is certainly a prudent choice.

I used Translator byChicken Systems for conversion purposes.</p><p>Yes, other soft-synths geared towards physical modelling, realistic<br/>sampling or reconstructive phrase modelling will naturally excel over<br/>SF2.

This is, after all, an indispensible<br/>feature to a microtonal composer - even over aural realism.</p><p>Nevertheless, I think that two recent microtonal compositions of mine<br/>made through Scordatura, &quot;East Dreams West&quot; and &quot;Icicle Caverns&quot;<br/>demonstrate that a modest amount of realism is very much achievable<br/>even when using 16-bit 44.1 Hz mono soundfonts.</p><p>As for linking Scordatura to Logic... As far as I know, you can<br/>configure Sibelius (for instance) to send MIDI data to all the ports<br/>and parts of Scordatura, which can in turn send the data to the<br/>relevant output destinations after tuning the incoming notes. The soft-<br/>instruments hooked up to Scordatura must, of course, be able to respond to GM pitch bending.</p><p>Another thing to be mindful of if using Sibelius as the sender, is<br/>that you need to specify your own manual soundset under Sibelius<br/>Playback Devices in order to be able to choose a channel number in the<br/>instrument Mixer window. This is necessary if you have specified<br/>several intrument patch groups in a virtual Scordatura port.</p><p>I have myself failed to create instruments in Logic Pro which can<br/>receive MIDI data from Scordatura&apos;s output ports. Even if it could be<br/>done, a 16 port x 4 channel part setup would require 64 distinct<br/>tracks in the arrange window. Very possible, but surely a resource<br/>gulper.

For example a guitar has different voicing for the chords than violin or mandoline. And chords on guitar can be played in quick arpeggio down or up, or rasgueado, which is not possible on the violin. Violin chords are usually broken in two dyads, or arpeggiated up/down. Guitar can play plucked tremolo on one string, violin not (only single pizzicato, but tremolo can be achieved with the bow, of course). Mandoline and some double stringed balalaika can easily play tremolo  with a plectre, but also some instruments without doubled string  can do it (koto...).</p><p>Or harp is strictly diatonic instrument which can&apos;t play quick chromatic scale. One of the reasons why big orchestras have two harps.</p><p>Or take higher positions on the fretboard of stringed instruments combined with open strings - such chords like on the guitar you will never find on the keyboard, also because sometimes there&apos;s real unisono between open string and same note fretted on the other string...</p><p>Or take amplitude envelope of the sound - piano, marimba or harpsichord music looks totally different than accordeon, organ or reed organ music with sustained notes which are impossible on the previous (sustain pedal on the piano has different effect). It directly dictates how ideal music for each of this instruments should look. Harpsichord toccata or highly ornamentated Couperin&apos;s work has different structure and character than organ prelude with long sustained chords. Mozart&apos;s piano music is different than Chopin&apos;s music not only because of different music styles, but also thanks to the invention of the sustain pedal which created specific piano music different from that written for harpsichord, clavichord, pipe organ or reed organ. Nothing to say about jazz organ, for example Hammond with very specific playing technique (palm and finger glissandos, block chords, quick riffs and licks, tremolos, using of percussion effect, Leslie speed switching, vibrato/chorus, clearly defined role of both hands...).</p><p>Some instruments are predestined for playing polyphony (keyboards), the others are limited in this (strings), with some others it&apos;s almost impossible even when they can play chords (marimba).<br/>Also some other elements of music have their specialties and limitations on certain instruments, for example trills and tremolos. Or take a glissando - for example on trombones there&apos;s a lot of limitations, the longest tritone glissando must start from certain notes only... Fretless string instruments can play fully continuous glissando, fretted ones only chromatic glissando...</p><p>While keyboard instruments nowadays use five finger technique for passages, string instruments can use only four fingers. This has a great impact on the music. I can often recognize if music was composed on the piano or on the guitar - piano has unlimited passage structures, and pentachords are often to hear, or groups with less or more neighboring tones, while guitar relies on tetrachordal structure or less. I mentioned this for the first time when playing with fusion group in 1975 we studied works of Corea&apos;s Return to Forever. &quot;Mediterranean Sundance&quot; by guitarist Al DiMeola had totally different character of passages than works of Corea who of course invented them on the piano. So it was more difficult to play them on piano than on guitar, as I remember, and it was possible only with some special piano fingering, and still not so comfortable.</p><p>Also instrument specific things and tactile human interface must be taken into the account how ideal music (and that means also relatively easily performable or improvisable) for that instrument will look. For example I know zillions of piano works using white keys and black keys as two groups, each one for every hand, played alternatively or together. So many compositions that I personally try to avoid this in my own works, it sounds almost like a cheap old trick good only to attract girls during improvisation :-). The other instruments have similar features. If you consider tactile action as priority, you can find interesting things directly reflected in the music. I did more compositions where I have selected this &quot;tactile&quot; attitude, for example shapes of the fingerings on the fretboard or keyboard, and it gave me interesting patterns I would never find when the main approach would be pure notes and their organization.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 18 Feb 2010, at 11:15 AM, Chris Vaisvil wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Daniel,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure there is an English equivalent.<br/>&gt; I do know what you mean now - every instrument has its own natural &gt; phrasings and tendencies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86635 href="#86635">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2010 1:09:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Factura is Latin, the making of something.

And, in certain circles, one could say that<br/>&gt; I &quot;shred.&quot; And now that I&apos;ve destroyed all perception of humility for<br/>&gt; myself, I might as well weigh in and say that sometimes, especially at<br/>&gt; first, 5/4 did sound dreadfully flat. However, this has to do with the<br/>&gt; fact that as Kalle mentioned, us jazz guys tend to take the 400 cent<br/>&gt; interval as being a lot more than just a 5/4 - its use as 81/64 is<br/>&gt; very common (as in the tendency of jazz musicians to use quartal and<br/>&gt; quintal chords), and probably some other intuitive ways to use that<br/>&gt; interval that I&apos;m not thinking of. That was one of the main problems<br/>&gt; for me at first - I tended to always think in terms of the circle of<br/>&gt; fifths. It&apos;s also a bit too flat to create much tension as a leading<br/>&gt; tone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nowadays I actually do like 5/4 quite a bit, but I&apos;d prefer 81/32 &gt;for<br/>&gt; a chord like C G Bb+ D F+ A C+ E, or 32/21 for a chord like C F Bb &gt;Eb<br/>&gt; G.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for 7/4, my response as well as that of my friends at school was<br/>&gt; that it was also very &quot;flat&quot; at first, since were used to thinking &gt;of<br/>&gt; a minor seventh as being accessible via the circle of fourths if<br/>&gt; necessary. Nowadays I just hear it as a separate animal from the &gt;usual<br/>&gt; 12-tet &quot;minor seventh&quot; though.</p><p>This points out a major problem in the presentation of the &quot;regular mapping paradigm&quot;: the emphasis on &quot;tempering out&quot; intervals, whereas in actual practice the concern really amounts more to &quot;tempering IN&quot; intervallic possibilities. &quot;Fa-of-Fa sounding the same as Te&quot; means, in practice (however it described) a lot to a many musicians, whereas<br/>&quot;tempering out 64/63&quot; does not. The seventh of 12-tET also has a direct parallel in 5-limit JI as well as this Pythagorean equivalent:<br/>two 5/4s and a 9/8, however ordered, make a &quot;pun&quot; with 7/4. &quot;An augmented sixth equals a minor seventh&quot; needs to mentioned, not just &quot;tempering out 225/224&quot;. You could have a temperament with a pure 7/4 divvied up into two M3&apos;s and a whole tone, or 12-tET, both with the same &quot;pun&quot; found in the lower harmonic series.</p><p>&gt; Just curious, have you written many pieces making extensive use of<br/>&gt; this interval? I have only heard one piece of yours, a vocal<br/>&gt; composition from a long time ago. Maybe you&apos;re just more dialed into<br/>&gt; these higher-limit intervals than I am.</p><p>Hardly ever used 9/7 at all, ever, I tend to find it garish, like brightly painted fiberglass sculpture (depending on context of course). I prefer either a high third like 14/11, or most of all a &quot;thirth&quot; or &quot;fourd&quot; in the region between 13/10 and 17/13.

The seventh of 12-tET also has a direct parallel in 5-limit JI as well as this Pythagorean equivalent:<br/>&gt; two 5/4s and a 9/8, however ordered, make a &quot;pun&quot; with 7/4. &quot;An augmented sixth equals a minor seventh&quot; needs to mentioned, not just &quot;tempering out 225/224&quot;.

To me, a pun is a kind of logical homophonic vector &quot;occuring in nature&quot; so to speak.

To me, a pun is a kind of logical homophonic vector &quot;occuring in nature&quot; so to speak. Human modalities implementing these are going to tend to be more immediately tangible as &quot;sensible&quot; and &quot;harmonious&quot;, I think, for the simple reason that they mimic suggested modalities within the very sensible and, well, harmonious, harmonic series.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Why would my pun happen at the 53rd fifth? I set it up so that 6 whole<br/>&gt; &gt; steps tempers right into the octave. My question was mainly if the<br/>&gt; &gt; word &quot;pun&quot; refers to the perceptual experience of harmonically &quot;going<br/>&gt; &gt; somewhere&quot; and then arriving somewhere else due to tempering... as in<br/>&gt; &gt; whoaa, this guy&apos;s going way out... wait hold on.. now we&apos;re back at<br/>&gt; &gt; the I chord again.

Whereas smoothest third, smoothest third, smoothest second (aug 6) to get to a pun with the smoothest seventh works in both consistency of character and in sheer proximity (size of comma- more than 3 times smaller than the syntonic).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; A search of the archives here at the tuning list turns up only a passing mention, and no disscusion at all, of what is perhaps the most obvious and simple &quot;pun&quot; in the low harmonics, which strikes me as very strange and hard to believe, perhaps the search function is not good. Herman Miller certainly knows all about it, as it is the &quot;key&quot; to one of his temperaments- the most immediately useful, by far and away, of any of the &quot;regular temperaments&quot; found at this list. This pun is both concretely more simple and more radical than &quot;tempering out the syntonic comma&quot;, yet is also dealing with a comma much smaller: a &quot;no brainer&quot; so to speak.

That is, you said justly tuned.<br/>&gt; They&apos;re obviously indistinguishable in the temperament.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s hard to know whether Kalle&apos;s right or not. We&apos;re so<br/>&gt; used to hearing the syntonic pun that articulating the 81/80<br/>&gt; sounds perspicacious, rather than the other way around.</p><p>I&apos;m confused here - given the definition you gave above, it would be that<br/>we&apos;re not used to hearing the syntonic pun, because 5/4 and 81/64 are<br/>indistinguishable in 12-tet?</p><p>Or are you saying that we can &quot;pick up&quot; on the underlying pun that WOULD<br/>exist if it were set back into JI?</p><p>&gt; Tempered progressions involving commas that ARE distinguished<br/>&gt; in 12-ET certainly sound punny to me (as long as the required<br/>&gt; prog. is short enough), but how do I know they only sound this<br/>&gt; way because they defy the system I learned, rather than some<br/>&gt; JI ideal?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One way to test this might be to listen to non-diatonic (and<br/>&gt; therefore less commonly-heard) puns in 12. For instance,<br/>&gt; C - E - G# - C. Sound punny?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or, if you&apos;ve ever heard the title track from the King Crimson<br/>&gt; album _Red_, it&apos;s based on a diminished (aka octatonic)<br/>&gt; progression. Sound punny?</p><p>Red is too busy sounding awesome for me to hear it as punny. Which isn&apos;t<br/>trivial, there&apos;s a point to this, an untestable hypothesis that I have: that<br/>song manages to temper out 640/625 but not make it sound like you&apos;re<br/>awkwardly back at the root. Although now that I&apos;m listening to it again, it<br/>sort of does, but not always.</p><p>Danny Elfman&apos;s favorite trick - major chords ascending in tritones - is<br/>punbelieva -- well you get it.</p><p>Probably the best example I have ever heard of is John Coltrane&apos;s tune<br/>&quot;Giant Steps.&quot; This piece makes use of the fact that 12-tet tempers out the<br/>diesis. Although you&apos;re probably familiar with the chords, just for<br/>everyone&apos;s sake, they are:</p><p>Bmaj D7  | Gmaj Bb7 | Ebmaj | Am7 D7<br/>Gmaj Bb7 | Ebmaj F#7| Bmaj  | Fm7 Bb7</p><p>And then it goes on to the rest of the song. In case any of you can&apos;t<br/>immediately see the pattern, I&apos;m going to shift the bottom line over so it<br/>syncs up:</p><p>Bmaj D7  | Gmaj Bb7 | Ebmaj    | Am7 D7<br/>           Gmaj Bb7 | Ebmaj F#7| Bmaj  | Fm7 Bb7</p><p>OK, so you see the pattern. If we were to do this in JI, Bmaj would be the I<br/>chord, and then it modulates down to 8/5 (one step &quot;down&quot; the 5-limit axis).<br/>Then it modulates to the key of 32/25 (two steps along down 5-limit axis).<br/>Then it temporarily modulates back one step to 8/5, goes down to 32/25<br/>again, and finally arrives at 128/125. That&apos;s 3 steps along the 5-limit<br/>axis. Chew on that.</p><p>Except in 12-equal, there is no 128/125, so you&apos;re just back at the root.<br/>Until I took the time to learn to play and improvise over this song I had NO<br/>IDEA we were back at the root there, because it sure didn&apos;t sound like it.<br/>People would say &quot;oh yeah Giant Steps is easy because it&apos;s just like major<br/>thirds and stuff brah&quot; and I didn&apos;t know what they were saying at all. And<br/>this is coming from a guy with AP0 or whatever it&apos;s called.</p><p>So yes, I think that the perception of comma pumps or puns exist even in<br/>tempered systems - to an extent. And furthermore, because at first I had no<br/>idea that the tempered 1/1 relationship between those two chords even<br/>existed at all - I only heard a large sequence of chords moving in awesome<br/>intervals happening, with that final Bmaj sounding insanely colorful and<br/>awesome. Then I started hearing the 1/1 relationship (thanks to music theory<br/>teachers), and the multistable perception began. And now I no longer feel<br/>&quot;compelled&quot; to hear it as 1/1 anymore, and I can hear it the way I used to,<br/>which is awesome.</p><p>This also ties into what you were saying - that they only sound punny if<br/>they&apos;re short enough. Well, yes, because if they&apos;re too long, you might not<br/>remember what the original chord was that you&apos;re punning back around to.<br/>AKA, an endless Cmaj-Am-Dm-G7 progression might not sound punny if played<br/>slow enough, but if you play it really fast - it starts to sound a little<br/>hokey.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=86701 href="#86701">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/19/2010 7:21:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No. It&apos;s only a pun if they ARE distinguishable (and the more<br/>&gt; &gt; distinguishable, the more punny).

For example.</p><p>But there is no &quot;fifth&quot;, as in 3/2, in that example at all. It is an illusion, pointed out in the second part of the example( where the tonic drops an octave). &quot;Sol&quot; here is literally a septimal tritone: three consecutive steps of pure 8/7. There are actually ONLY a bunch of steps of 8/7 in this example- the whole thing is pretty much a brute mimesis of audible spectral proportions, it could hardly sound anything but pretty, regardless of how &quot;good&quot; or &quot;meaningful&quot; or whatever.</p><p>Lower partials, 8/7. Quick trip, three of them.</p><p>Hopefully this elucidates my point. My personal opinion is that the aug6/m7 homophonic vector is not really the actual key to riding up the harmonic series from 5 to 7. And, I think example one illustrates this very well. In tuninglistese, I would say that first key comma is actually 1029/1024. The next comma is addressed in example 2. And I think that example</p><p>&gt; Are you referring to 225/224?  Miracle tempers it to zero,<br/>&gt; so comma pumps based on 225/224 do in fact become puns.</p><p>1029/1024 in the first example, and something else, requiring a<br/>full article, in the second.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve renamed your folder to conform to the naming convention<br/>&gt; in the Files area<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/CameronBobro/">/tuning/files/CameronBobro/</a><br/>&gt; Is this OK with you?

Then what makes the harmonic series perfect, and what makes it not<br/>music.</p><p>I thought of the following things that make it perfect in it&apos;s own way:<br/>It&apos;s intervals are perfect 2/1 3/2 4/3 5/4 6/5 etc.<br/>It&apos;s order is perfect. from large to smaller etc.</p><p>What makes the harmonic series not music?<br/>I belief all musical harmonies to exist in the harmonic series somewhere,<br/>and therefore all musical intervals to exist in harmonic series somehwere.<br/>So the way the intervals are perfect is not the way the harmonic series<br/>differs from music.<br/>But the order of the harmonic series, that doesn&apos;t resemble music to me at<br/>all.<br/>Music is somewhat symetric, there are inversions and mirrors everywhere,<br/>intervals follow eachother in all sorts of orders etc.<br/>So what makes the harmonic series not music is it&apos;s order I thought.</p><p>Not that this is perfect thinking, it&apos;s just one of many thoughts trying to<br/>make sense of things.</p><p>There was another thing that I wanted to do.<br/>I want to be able to classify chords in many ways.<br/>Classify chords from simple to more complex etc.</p><p>Now the harmonic series is easily classified.<br/>1/1 2/1 is more simple than 1/1 2/1 3/1, or 2/1 3/1 etc</p><p>Now back to the order of the harmonic series not beeing music.<br/>What happends if we change the order of the intervals in the harmonic<br/>series?<br/>Starting from simple to more complex.</p><p>1/1 2/1 you can&apos;t change the order.<br/>1/1 2/1 3/1 you can. there is 2/1 interval followed by 3/2 interval. We can<br/>change the order to 1/1 3/2 3/1 (3/2 + 2/1 instead of 2/1 + 3/2)<br/>Now that doesn&apos;t sound terrible at all :)<br/>It is still the most simple in a certain way, limited the harmonic series to<br/>the 3rd harmonic.<br/>But it lost the harmonic perfection of interval order.<br/>Now we try thesame with 4th harmonic limit:<br/>1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1  (2/1 + 3/2 + 4/3)<br/>We can make it:<br/>1/1 2/1 8/3 4/1  (2/1 + 4/3 + 3/2)<br/>1/1 3/2 3/1 4/1  (3/2 + 2/1 + 4/3)<br/>1/1 3/2 2/1 4/1  (3/2 + 4/3 + 2/1)<br/>1/1 4/3 8/3 4/1  (4/3 + 2/1 + 3/2)<br/>1/1 4/3 2/1 4/1  (4/3 + 3/2 + 2/1)</p><p>If we keep the 1/1 at thesame frequency, and lay on top of eachother all the<br/>possible permutations of 4-limit harmonic series (as given above) we get:<br/>1/1 4/3 3/2 2/1 8/3 3/1 4/1<br/>Reduced to one octave it is: 1/1 4/3 3/2 2/1</p><p>Of the above scale we can say the following:<br/>All the intervals come from / are related to 1/1.<br/>All these permutations are the simplest in an harmonic sense just like a<br/>limited harmonic series is, with the only difference that the harmonic order<br/>is permutated.</p><p>For 5-limit harmonic permutation the scale is:<br/>1/1 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1 (when reduced to one octave)</p><p>For 6-limit harmonic permutation the scale is:<br/>1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1</p><p>For 7-limit harmonic permutation the scale is:<br/>1/1 21/20 35/32 9/8 7/6 6/5 5/4 21/16 4/3 7/5 35/24 3/2 14/9 8/5 5/3 7/4 9/5<br/>28/15 15/8 35/18 2/1</p><p>Now I do not think that for instance a musical mode like major and minor<br/>scales are nessecarily in 1 root.<br/>It&apos;s quite possible there&apos;s a change of interval root / chord root going on<br/>during the playing of a mode.</p><p>So for instance major mode: 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1 could be part<br/>of 1 &quot;root&quot; / all intervals comming from thesame 1/1 source in the 6-limit<br/>harmonic permutation scale.<br/>But it could also be that there&apos;s a 3/2 change of root somewhere while<br/>playing the mode, and that there are 2 roots, 1/1 and 3/2 and both roots<br/>have the 5-limit harmonic permutation scale comming / centering from them.<br/>giving (1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1)</p><p>And there&apos;s another way of looking at it.<br/>If you take 5-limit harmonic series.<br/>And instead of centering all permutations on 1/1, you also center them on<br/>2/1 3/1 4/1 and 5/1, you get the following scale:<br/>1/1 16/15 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1   (12 tone scale!)<br/>You can hear a simplified result of this line of thinking in my computer<br/>generated choir composition at <a href="http://www.develde.net">www.develde.net</a> (bottom of page)<br/>6-limit harmonic permutation scale centering around 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 6/1<br/>gives: 1/1 25/24 16/15 10/9 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 27/20 25/18 45/32 3/2 25/16 8/5<br/>5/3 27/16 16/9 9/5 15/8 2/1</p><p>But I&apos;ve come back a bit to seeing chords as stemming from intervals comming<br/>from a single 1/1 root.<br/>Though not sure about anything really.</p><p>But the above things give me some reference to chords and modes, and changes<br/>of roots (something similar to a modulation, only a bit deeper and much more<br/>frequent, more like change of root or fundamental bass).<br/>Thesame things above can be aplied to &quot;changes of roots&quot; and give<br/>interesting musical results and insights.</p><p>Many many more things to tell but I&apos;ll figure things out a bit more myself<br/>and then make a pretty website.</p><p>As for why it works.<br/>Well you can read my above story to start.<br/>Lots more to tell besides this though. I&apos;ve put a lot of thinking into<br/>things.<br/>Both mathematically and logically, thinking about things like comma pumps<br/>and other impossibilities and possibilities etc.<br/>And offcourse tried to test everything by ear and by tuning things, trying<br/>to make sense of music etc.<br/>And of all things I tried (many many things over the past several years),<br/>the above way of seeing things is by far the most musical I&apos;ve ever<br/>encountered, and it works out.<br/>Not saying I&apos;m done yet though, but it&apos;s allready really good in my opinion.<br/>And as far as I know there isn&apos;t anything better out there.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=86810 href="#86810">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2010 12:40:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You&apos;re telling me what the definition of &quot;pun&quot; is at the tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; list.

It&apos;s interesting to see the<br/>differing ideas that people have about extending to the 7-limit. I like the<br/>&quot;5and7example&quot; clip that Cameron posted - although it&apos;s a different &quot;way&quot; of<br/>extending to the 7-limit than I was picturing, it&apos;s good for me to hear how<br/>other people are doing things as well.</p><p>It&apos;s kind of like if I was an early Catholic monk transported to the present<br/>day asking how to extend music to the 5-limit. And some people are saying<br/>&quot;check out Beethoven,&quot; some say &quot;check out Bach,&quot; yet others are saying<br/>&quot;listen to Chopin,&quot; and so on.</p><p>In case people are curious - I have found a lot of success by taking 12-tet<br/>chord progressions that I -ALREADY- perceive as being in the 7-limit - and<br/>then justly intonating them, starting with simple modal things for now. By<br/>&quot;meditating&quot; on and thinking about common chord progressions, sometimes I<br/>can get an intuitive glimmer of how I&apos;m really perceiving things &quot;under the<br/>hood.&quot; Maybe it&apos;s all placebo but it&apos;s been working well so far.</p><p>Something like ||: Abmaj | F7 :||. This is a very Beatles-esque progression<br/>and I find it works well in the 7-limit. You keep the C between the two<br/>chords constant, and shift the Eb in the Ab chord down 36/35 - which works<br/>very well as a &quot;chromatic&quot; interval in this case.</p><p>It is something fun to play with though - where in already existing 12-tet<br/>music are 7-limit implications hinted at? I think that it might be<br/>worthwhile (for me at least) to examine some more recent popular music:<br/>later Beatles stuff, classic 60&apos;s soul, and so on. Sometimes it&apos;s just<br/>5-limit modal stuff they use, but I think there&apos;s a deeper answer in there<br/>somewhere.</p><p>One question to cameron: what is your pundemo02 supposed to be?

Obviously it can be used as a tempered fifth, I have called it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;sol&quot; a number of times already.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK, why then did you say &quot;there are no tempered intervals&quot;? As Carl<br/>&gt; &gt; said in message #86723:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;There are of course an infinite number of pairs of lattice points<br/>&gt; &gt; that are imperceptibly close together, where one does not need to<br/>&gt; &gt; change the size of any intervals to achieve temperament. That &gt;doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; change the fact that temperament (in the abstract sense we use on<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning-math) has been achieved.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I said that there are no tempered intervals because there are no tempered<br/>&gt; intervals. &quot;imperceptibly close together&quot;?

Mike, a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; jazz pianist versed in 12-tET but looking for harmonic-series<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; evolution of the art in fixed-pitch instruments, wanted a fluid<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; connection to the seventh partial, all I did was present one of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;organic&quot; connections.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Carl suggested 22-tET to Mike, pajara temperament. Now, take a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; look at the examples I posted...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; That stuff about terminology, what&apos;s a &quot;pun&quot;- that&apos;s just smoke, a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; distraction. The real issue is that I consider the 8:7...3:2<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (7:4...4:3) connection vital to a fluid evolution from 5-limit to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 7.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is puzzling in so many ways. How does this 7:8s to 2:3<br/>&gt; &gt; connection constitute a fluid evolution from 5-limit to 7-limit?<br/>&gt; &gt; 1024:1029 doesn&apos;t even contain factors of 5. I would have thought<br/>&gt; &gt; that going from 5-limit to 7-limit would start with 5-limit &gt;intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; but you just introduce 7:8s out of nowhere. And why do we have to<br/>&gt; &gt; find these bridges first in the &quot;untempered&quot; JI lattice? That &gt;smacks<br/>&gt; &gt; of JI fundamentalism.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What &quot;JI lattice?&quot; To be honest, my eyes kind of glaze over when I see<br/>&gt; those lattices. I&apos;m talking about proportions in harmonic series combined<br/>&gt; with scalar modalities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean, &quot;out of nowhere&quot;?

Yes, &gt;I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; think 22 is simply a wrong answer. Of course Mike may try 22 and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; find that it the holy grail for him.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Wrong answer to what question? And maybe Mike is better suited to<br/>&gt; &gt; answer: why there has to be a fluid evolution instead of a direct<br/>&gt; &gt; leap?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course Mike may like his 7th partial just &quot;tacked on&quot;, or may even be up<br/>&gt; for losing the 5-limit altogether, I don&apos;t know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t think it is a good argument against Pajara or 22-equal that<br/>&gt; &gt; they don&apos;t temper out 1024:1029. Even 99-equal which has very<br/>&gt; &gt; accurate 7-limit approximations doesn&apos;t temper it out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, there is the problem: too much noun, not enough verb. The 7/4<br/>&gt; proportion is not just &quot;so and so large&quot;, it is also &quot;does this and that in<br/>&gt; relationship with these and those.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Cameron Bobro<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86878 href="#86878">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2010 5:03:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mike,</p><p>In case people are curious - I have found a lot of success by taking 12-tet<br/>&gt; chord progressions that I -ALREADY- perceive as being in the 7-limit - and<br/>&gt; then justly intonating them, starting with simple modal things for now.

I have been saying for a couple of years here that in judging &quot;good approximations&quot; of Just intervals, sheer proximity is not enough. Let&apos;s say you have an 8/7 approximated at 230 cents, and an 8/7 approximated at 233 cents. The first is about 1 cent flat, the second about 2 cents sharp (of a pure 8/7). But if you are using this particular division of the pentachord, which interlocks with other divisions, the second, &quot;worse&quot; approximation is clearly better, not only because you&apos;d probably want a 699 cent fifth rather than a 690 cent fifth, but because a 690 cent fifth will monkey up the symmetrical interlocking 5-limit-thirds structure of the pentachord, as well as the interlocking symmetrical 7-limit structure of the fourths.  (And, obviously, it can make a big difference whether you temper up or down- the fifth of 22 is about 7 cents sharp and the fifth of 26 about 8 cents flat, but musically speaking they sound very different indeed, one is bright and the other is dark (or one is edgy and the other soggy, or whatever)).</p><p>-Cameron</p></div><h3><a id=86912 href="#86912">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2010 9:52:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; No, it isn&apos;t that obviously &quot;sol&quot;.

What is the &quot;8/7&quot; of miracle? I<br/>&gt; &gt; also think that there isn&apos;t much difference as long as three &quot;8/7s&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; make a good &quot;pun&quot; with 3:2, that&apos;s the point! It is when they don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; that you a disjointed 7th partial.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Personally I don&apos;t hear those 7:8s with their harmonic connotations<br/>&gt; because they are presented only melodically. They just sound like<br/>&gt; some whole-toneish intervals. I just hear an ~2:3 divided into three<br/>&gt; equal parts. So the pun is sort of lost on me even if I know what&apos;s<br/>&gt; going on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, why then did you say &quot;there are no tempered intervals&quot;? As<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Carl said in message #86723:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;There are of course an infinite number of pairs of lattice<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; points that are imperceptibly close together, where one does not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; need to change the size of any intervals to achieve temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; That doesn&apos;t change the fact that temperament (in the abstract<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sense we use on tuning-math) has been achieved.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I said that there are no tempered intervals because there are no<br/>&gt; &gt; tempered intervals. &quot;imperceptibly close together&quot;? I made a point<br/>&gt; &gt; of stating that what I&apos;m talking about does NOT require intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; to be imperceptibly close together, even got lead off on a tangent<br/>&gt; &gt; about the perceptible difference in the example I gave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, to achieve temperament (in the abstract sense) two intervals<br/>&gt; (or pitches) that are different in JI must be heard as &quot;the same&quot;<br/>&gt; (i.e. belonging to the same specific interval category, scale degree<br/>&gt; etc.).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We&apos;ve strayed far afar from the original point, though. Mike, a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jazz pianist versed in 12-tET but looking for harmonic-series<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolution of the art in fixed-pitch instruments, wanted a fluid<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connection to the seventh partial, all I did was present one of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;organic&quot; connections.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Carl suggested 22-tET to Mike, pajara temperament.  Now, take a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at the examples I posted...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That stuff about terminology, what&apos;s a &quot;pun&quot;- that&apos;s just<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; smoke, a distraction. The real issue is that I consider the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8:7...3:2 (7:4...4:3) connection vital to a fluid evolution<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from 5-limit to 7.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; This is puzzling in so many ways. How does this 7:8s to 2:3<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; connection constitute a fluid evolution from 5-limit to 7-limit?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1024:1029 doesn&apos;t even contain factors of 5. I would have thought<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that going from 5-limit to 7-limit would start with 5-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; intervals but you just introduce 7:8s out of nowhere. And why do<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; we have to find these bridges first in the &quot;untempered&quot; JI<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; lattice? That smacks of JI fundamentalism.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What &quot;JI lattice?&quot; To be honest, my eyes kind of glaze over when I<br/>&gt; &gt; see those lattices. I&apos;m talking about proportions in harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; series combined with scalar modalities.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What do you mean, &quot;out of nowhere&quot;? Did you listen to the file I<br/>&gt; &gt; uploaded in conjunction, PunDemo02?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I listened to all of them. I pointed out that the 7:8s to<br/>&gt; 2:3 connection is a no 5s-relation. So it is strange that you<br/>&gt; consider it making a bridge from 5-limit to 7-limit. And I would have<br/>&gt; thought that an organic progression from 5-limit to 7-limit would<br/>&gt; involve some combination of 5-limit intervals sounding a bit like a 7-<br/>&gt; limit one. Instead, the ~2:3 is found by stacking 7:8s. So we kind of<br/>&gt; go from 7-limit intervals to a 3-limit interval. That&apos;s why I<br/>&gt; said &quot;out of nowhere&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why exactly do you think 1024:1029 is vital to a fluid evolution from<br/>&gt; 5-limit to 7-limit?

I&apos;ll check on that soon.</p><p>&gt; This is an attitude, not a fact. &quot;Tonally relevant&quot;<br/>&gt; according to whom, under what criteria? This is what I<br/>&gt; was talking about earlier.

Playing in other<br/>temperaments provides compact configurations of all MOS scales because, by<br/>definition, a scale composed of a continuous stack of a single generator and<br/>reduced into a single period *will* be well-formed, and this is how the<br/>thummer and the TFS locate pitches on their layout: by generator stacks and<br/>period reductions that tightly surround a given tonal center. For instance,<br/>in the magic temperament which is generated by the major third and octave,<br/>there is an unnamed 10 note well-formed scale that functions similarly<br/>across the entire temperament.

The thing<br/>that ties them all together is basically the presence of the b6<br/>somewhere resolving to the I chord. So if you&apos;re in C major, somewhere<br/>in that chord progression is going to be an Ab. Whether you want to<br/>treat that as a progression based in C harmonic major, or &quot;descending<br/>melodic major,&quot; or something in C minor that turns into C major - is<br/>really arbitrary and up to you.</p><p>&gt; See Mike&apos;s &quot;Beatles&quot; progression Ab7-F for another specific septimal<br/>&gt; question (fifth and seventh of respective chords, tied or blued?)</p><p>If you try the Ab7-Fmaj progression, honestly to me the most natural<br/>sounding thing is to make the root move down 6/5. This would move the<br/>Eb down chromatically (commatically?) and keep the C constant. Doing<br/>it the other way - moving the root down 7/6 - would keep the Eb held<br/>constant but makes the rest of it sound awful as far as I&apos;m concerned.</p><p>Or maybe it sounds good, I just have to &quot;get used to it.&quot; Who knows?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=87035 href="#87035">ðŸ”—</a>christopherv &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/2010 5:06:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I think this is the tuning I was thinking of - though there was I thought one more.;</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris,<br/>&gt; To put this (&quot;JI Silver Scale&quot;) all into Scala simply input the following values into scala after selecting &quot;new scale&quot; type in<br/>&gt; 13/12,14/12,15/12,17/12,18/12, 20/12, 21/12<br/>&gt; (with the commas to indicate the separation of the ratios).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Scala will automatically reduce the fractions for you.<br/>&gt; Note how the 12:13:14:15: 17:18:20: 21:24 notation relates to the above fractions, only scala creates the 24/12 Silver double octave and 12/12 root tone for you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________<br/>&gt; From: Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Sent: Fri, February 12, 2010 6:00:27 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [tuning] Silver scale revisited...apparently enjoyed by a handful  of people, if just that<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hate to be a pain...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; is there an easy way to put this into scala?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 12:13:14:15: 17:18:20: 21:24<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=87045 href="#87045">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2010 8:40:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris,</p><p>I&apos;m still looking for the &quot;non-Silver&quot; 14-tone scale but, basically, it&apos;s a variant on the below 7 tone scale (recently improved)</p><p>1.08333333333 = 13/12 (starting generator of bold mirroring)<br/>1.21875      = 39/32  (3/2 - (24/13 over 3/2))<br/>1.33333      = 4/3<br/>1.5               = 3/2 (2 over 4/3)<br/>1.66666666 = 5/3<br/>1.84615 = 24/13 (AKA *2* over *13/12*)</p><p>   The odd/&quot;mirror generated&quot; notes are in bold, the rest pretty much fit into the x/12 harmonic series.
