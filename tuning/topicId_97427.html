I<br/>would have replied to an existing line of emails, but none of the recent<br/>ones had a title appropriate to the subject.</p><p>I&apos;ve been brute-forcing through some hundreds of formulas of a certain form<br/>with the idea that at least one might be close to something very usable.<br/>What I&apos;m lacking, though, is a good culling mechanism. I don&apos;t want to put<br/>up a file with tons of &quot;off&quot; results. I know we&apos;ve talked a lot about this<br/>subject and that, as Carl mentions in his FAQ, the topic was talked to death<br/>long before I came to the list, and before any of us were born. I&apos;m asking,<br/>however, for a sort of consensus summary as a culling heuristic to determine<br/>which results should be kept for further investigation.</p><p>Probably the best way to do this would be to state under what conditions<br/>results should be thrown out.</p><p>A little bit more about the particular implementation I am using:</p><p>Along with the interval ratio, the cents, and the dissonance score, a list<br/>of 12-EDO note names is generated based on closest values in cents assuming<br/>C is tonic. These are uppercase unless the note is 25+ cents off, then they<br/>are lowercase; e.g. 730 cents is &quot;g&quot;. Whether it is called sharp or flat is<br/>not dependent on the particular cents, but instead by which appears sooner<br/>in the minimal usual key signature convention; e.g. Eb not D#, since Bb,Eb<br/>is shorter than F#,C#,G#,D#. Also, Ab is assumed instead of G#.</p><p>So, for example, a simple heuristic would be that the first 12 intervals<br/>should be near Tenney height such that the 12-EDO note names are &quot;C C G F A<br/>E bb Eb F# Ab eb Bb&quot;. It would be unusual that any function I would use<br/>would match those note names and not match the Tenney height intervals<br/>themselves, so this can be thought of as an approximate shorthand. Of<br/>course, the first two intervals might be (2/1,1/1) or (1/1/,2/1), but this<br/>is not of too much concern to me since they are octave equivalent. (For now<br/>I&apos;m only testing intervals in the standard octave, btw).</p><p>There is no need to restrict the culling mechanism to note names only,<br/>however.</p><p>Also, if you suspect that there is a function I should include in the<br/>combinations that is not as complicated as HE or serious matrix<br/>computations, then please let me know. My plan was to make a call for<br/>suggested functions after posting initial results along with functions<br/>included. Btw, I&apos;m already using Tenney-Euclidean-lb distance as one<br/>function in the array of input functions to be combined, as well as Tenney<br/>height, Mann height, and several others.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2011 1:49:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Daniel,</p><p>I feel like I&apos;m missing something here.

Produce a list<br/>&gt; of... ?<br/>&gt;<br/>...functions that might be suitable for rating harmonicity of intervals in a<br/>way similar to Tenney height, but with slight differences that might be<br/>defensible as important and valid. This of course assumes that Tenney height<br/>might be improved by a simple extension.</p><p>My model is running on the assumption that there is something like a<br/>&quot;signal&quot; that needs to be extracted from some &quot;noise&quot;. For instance, Gene<br/>pointed to wider intervals by some accounts being perceived as less<br/>dissonant. We might consider, then, some inharmonicity metric to be the<br/>&quot;signal&quot;, and some measure of interval distance to be the &quot;noise&quot;. As the<br/>noise increases, the inharmonicity able to be meaningfully perceived<br/>decreases, in a sense similar to the Weber law. That may be making too<br/>specific of an analogy, though. Basically what I&apos;m getting at is that one<br/>might expect a meaningful ordering of results to derive from a ratio of<br/>functions F(a,b)=S(a,b)/N(a,b) for some reduced ratio a/b.</p><p>The measuring scales of the numerator and the denominator might not be in<br/>correct alignment for these purposes; some might be cubes, some might be<br/>square-roots, etc. For that reason I check over powers as well using</p><p>F(a,b) = ( S(a,b) )^m / ( N(a,b) )^n, for some domain of positive integers m<br/>and n</p><p>That way there is little need to, say, define sqrrt(a*b) or cubrt(a*b) as<br/>well as a*b in the array of searchable functions, since squaring the<br/>numerator is equivalent to square-rooting the denominator when it is only a<br/>monotonic ordering one is concerned with (similar to using square-distance<br/>instead of distance).</p><p>Culling is important because it defines what is counted as &quot;meaningful&quot;. For<br/>instance, if I were to say that the first ratios of a possibly meaningful<br/>ordering must approximate 12-EDO&apos;s &quot;C C G F A E bb&quot;, and that is the only<br/>necessary condition, then F(a,b)=b works just as well as F(a,b)=a*b. This<br/>would result in an overwhelming deluge of data that is considered<br/>&quot;meaningful&quot;.</p><p>I do want to cull these somehow, so I was hoping to get opinions on how to<br/>rate the resultant orderings.</p><p>What&apos;s the point of the 12-ET note names?<br/>&gt;<br/>That was just intended to make things a little easier to write and test, but<br/>it is not directly connected in any meaningful way and likely didn&apos;t need<br/>the mention.</p><p>&gt; Are you looking for formula to try?

D/C and C/D are here being called<br/>the &quot;relative dissonance&quot; and &quot;relative consonance&quot;.
