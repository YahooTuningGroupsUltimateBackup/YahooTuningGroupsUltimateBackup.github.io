It is true that almost any piece of<br/>music is appropriate for some situation and/or mood.  When that situation<br/>is less likely to occur than the sun going out, I say suck.</p><p>(Or if you prefer, you can create the situation to enjoy a given piece of<br/>music, and its suckitude is inversely proportional to how much you gain<br/>from doing so.)</p><p>It also can come in handy when the recording someone&apos;s charging for would<br/>take me about the same amount of time to record as it would to listen to.</p><p>&gt;As well as I can tell from the writings of Mr. Lumma, he has a very<br/>&gt;conservative and limited taste in music.</p><p>You think so?  I bet my taste is wider than yours.  Prove it!  Nah, nah,<br/>nah, nah, nah, nah...  Infinity plus 1!</p><p>I was just responding to somebody trying to haphazardly add things to my<br/>list.  Make your own.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m a Californian and have lived in Europe for a decade now and would&apos;ve<br/>&gt;put La Monte Young on my list without reservation.</p><p>Europe, eh?  Are you stocked up on canned goods and US currency?</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ll add Rod Poole and Kraig Grady to the list. I didn&apos;t this morning<br/>&gt;because I needed to go to sleep. Pat Pagano is doing some cool<br/>&gt;stuff too, keep an ear out for him.</p><p>Grady is on my list, yo.  Rod almost made it.  I have recorded several<br/>hours of music with Pat&apos;s ensemble.  I love his stuff.</p><p>&gt;Frankly, Carl I thought you a bit more adventurous. Your playing would<br/>&gt;benefit from a big spoonful of Pandit Riley.</p><p>I never said I didn&apos;t like Riley.  I just said he didn&apos;t make the list.</p><p>&gt;For an essential Microtonal music list no one should be without the<br/>&gt;entire catalogs of the following Labels:<br/>&gt;Ocura<br/>&gt;Avidus/Unesco<br/>&gt;Music Du Monde/Le Chant Du Monde<br/>&gt;JVC World sounds<br/>&gt;Inedit</p><p>We&apos;re talking about $10,000 worth of CD&apos;s here?</p><p>Carl</p></div>
