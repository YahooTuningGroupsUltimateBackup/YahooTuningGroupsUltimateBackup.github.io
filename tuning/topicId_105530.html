As the<br/>&gt; favorite stable concords, they are acceptable as parallels -- but<br/>&gt; limited in serious counterpoint by the general preference for a<br/>&gt; variety of motions (especially contrary) and intervals.</p><p>This is an interesting thought; I&apos;ve never come across this idea<br/>before. But I guess my question is, why do the parallel thirds and<br/>sixths have to come -at the cost- of parallel fifths then? Why didn&apos;t<br/>16th-century harmony just adopt full parallel triads, with parallel<br/>thirds and parallel fifths and everything?</p><p>Also, do you know if the status of parallel octaves changed from the<br/>medieval era to the 16th century?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; And even in the 16th century, it&apos;s not the _sound_ of parallel<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fifths in textures for three or more voices that&apos;s the issue, but<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the relative loss of independence of parts where 3/2 is no longer<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the standard of rich stability, but less ideally euphonious than<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; a third, sixth, or tenth. If the two voices cross which form the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fifths, there&apos;s no violation of the rule. Some anachronistic<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; criticism of 16th-century compositions treats this as a flaw; but<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; it&apos;s a flaw in the eyes of the beholder, not of 16th-century<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; practice or theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not sure I understand; do you mean that they&apos;re treating 3/2 as<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonant in general? As in, it&apos;s not as &quot;stable&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A good question that helps me communicate more clearly! There&apos;s<br/>&gt; no question that 3/2 or 2:3:4 is still stable in the 16th<br/>&gt; century, but it&apos;s increasingly felt as &quot;stable but incomplete.&quot;</p><p>OK, so after your examples, I know what you mean. So if I understand<br/>correctly, you&apos;re saying that a tradeoff is involved: in the medieval<br/>era, having parallel fifths gives you a loss of independence of parts,<br/>but now given the added advantage of having lots of nice rich trines<br/>around, this trade-off is worth it. But in the 16th century, trines<br/>weren&apos;t such a big deal, as you demonstrated with your Emaj -&gt; A5<br/>resolution, so now you&apos;re only getting the loss of independence of<br/>parts without any of the &quot;functional&quot; advantage. Right?</p><p>I also note that a similar situation happens in extended harmony,<br/>particularly in things like jazz standards where every dominant 7<br/>chord has tons of extensions on it and so on. Playing a raw dominant 7<br/>tetrad in closed position is pretty much the kiss of death in that<br/>setting; it&apos;s rather &quot;conservative,&quot; as you described the resolution<br/>to A5 in Zarlino&apos;s time.</p><p>&gt; And Don Randel has suggested that the prohibition against<br/>&gt; parallel fifths, as it became more consistently observed by<br/>&gt; around 1450, played a large role in shaping 16th-century and<br/>&gt; later progressions by a process of exclusion. As someone most<br/>&gt; often following a medieval style, with countless cadences and the<br/>&gt; like routinely involving parallel fifths, I can appreciate his<br/>&gt; point.</p><p>Do you mean here because the &quot;rules&quot; prohibiting parallel fifths<br/>started to pigeonhole composers into newer and different directions<br/>when they&apos;d invent chord progressions?</p><p>&gt; The interesting thing is that, if one assumes our 20/11 or<br/>&gt; whatever is stable and ideally euphonious, analogous to 5/4 in a<br/>&gt; 16th-century style, then applying both factors might lead to<br/>&gt; tentative rules we could try out like these:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (1) Avoid parallel 3/2&apos;s in &quot;serious&quot; 16th-century-like<br/>&gt; writing;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2) Use parallel 20/11&apos;s or 51/28&apos;s or whatever in a<br/>&gt; restrained way, especially in two-part writing, because<br/>&gt; they&apos;re ideally rich and euphonious, but a row of more<br/>&gt; than two or three creates something more like a textural<br/>&gt; effect than the development of two independent voices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (3) With three or more voices, we might loosen up a bit on<br/>&gt; rule (2), since two voices moving in parallel 20/11&apos;s or<br/>&gt; whatever can be balanced by other voices in oblique or<br/>&gt; better yet contrary motion.</p><p>I think these rules are a great starting point! As for number 2: Do<br/>you expect that the generator, aka this 20/11 or 9/5 or 11/6, will be<br/>acting in some sort of &quot;rich and euphonious&quot; way, in analogy to the<br/>role of the fifth in medieval music, by virtue of its generating the<br/>scale? Or is it simple ratios that you expect will be rich and<br/>euphonious, such as 3/2 and 5/4? Or both? I do expect that 3/2 and 5/4<br/>will be more concordant from a purely psychoacoustic perspective, but<br/>I think we&apos;re talking about something different here.</p><p>&gt; No problem, and taking some time led you to some really helpful<br/>&gt; questions which I saw shortly after getting back online.

It isn&apos;t the answer<br/>I would have given, but that doesn&apos;t mean that it<br/>isn&apos;t at least part of the picture.</p><p>The rule itself -- understood at first to apply<br/>only in two voices moving note against note, as<br/>opposed to ornamental counterpoint or multivoice<br/>composition -- appears in the early 14th century,<br/>and seems associated with the Ars Nova &quot;moderns.&quot;<br/>These &quot;moderns&quot; also call for a stricter treatment<br/>of intervals such as major seconds (9:8), major<br/>ninths (9:4), and minor sevenths (16:9) as clearly<br/>dissonant, and reserved for ornamental contexts.</p><p>In contrast, 13th-century perspectives do not<br/>prohibit any specific parallels (including octaves,<br/>which frequently occur), but simply call for a<br/>variety of intervals and motions, with contrary<br/>motion generally preferred. Parallel fifths are<br/>common in the best writing, e.g. Perotin, and in<br/>two-voice, note-against-note, textures as well<br/>as others. Also, 9:8, 16:9, and 9:4 are often<br/>held to be relatively dissonant but with some<br/>&quot;compatibility&quot; (a common 20th-century European<br/>view also), and Jacobus Liege regards them as<br/>&quot;imperfect concords,&quot; likewise meaning rather<br/>tense but not acutely so, with 9:4 actually<br/>an &quot;intermediate concord&quot; comparable to 81:64<br/>or 32:27.</p><p>The rule against parallel fifths, as well as<br/>octaves, in simple two-voice writing could<br/>thus be seen, like the treatment of major<br/>seconds and ninths as well as minor sevenths,<br/>as a shift toward a more privileged role for<br/>thirds -- and also major and eventually minor<br/>sixths, still unstable but likely more often<br/>to be used under the new rules simply because<br/>lots of other traditional possibilities would<br/>be excluded -- if these rules were actually<br/>followed.</p><p>In 13th-century theory and practice, the contrast<br/>was between stable 2:1, 3:2, and 4:3 concords,<br/>and a range of unstable intervals, with thirds<br/>and sixths very important, but seconds and sevenths<br/>also used frequently and often boldly. Even<br/>&quot;perfect discords&quot; about which theorists had<br/>mixed feelings, such as minor seconds (256:243)<br/>and major sevenths (243:128), occur prominently<br/>in practice, as Perotin&apos;s music will bear out.</p><p>Despite the new 14th-century rules, a composer<br/>such as Machaut favors traditional 13th-century<br/>liberties with seconds, sevenths, and ninths,<br/>while also following the modern taste for an<br/>increased focus on thirds and sixths.</p><p>For traditionalists, moderns, and artists such<br/>as Machaut choosing the most appealing traits<br/>of both the old and new approaches, however,<br/>parallel fifths are an accepted reality in<br/>writing for three or more voices. Standard<br/>cadences would be impossible if the modern<br/>rule -- however observed or otherwise in<br/>two-voice writing -- were applied here.<br/>And this remains true, at times, even in<br/>the earlier 15th century. Consider, for<br/>example, this wonderful cadence:</p><p>        G#   A<br/>        C#   D<br/>        E    D</p><p>Here the unstable sonority of major sixth and<br/>tenth could be 32:54:81 (1/1-27/16-81/32) in<br/>the standard Pythagorean tuning, or possibly<br/>something like 7:12:18 in an accentuated<br/>cadential style of the kind described by<br/>Marchettus of Padua. The resolution to a<br/>stable 1:2:3, with the wide 12th typical of<br/>the wider range often favored in this era,<br/>is most memorable. And the parallel fifths<br/>between the two upper voices are a routine<br/>aspect of this cadence.</p><p>A four-voice version, perhaps most famously<br/>used in Machaut&apos;s _Mass_, shows that parallel<br/>octaves are also permissible in this context:</p><p>        G#   A<br/>        C#   D<br/>        G#   A<br/>        E    D</p><p>At the opening of the 15th century, Prosdocimus<br/>de Beldemandis, also an advocate of a 17-note<br/>Pythagorean tuning (Gb-A#) to make regular<br/>Pythagorean intervals available at more locations,<br/>explains that parallel fifths and octaves are<br/>excluded because the point of counterpoint is<br/>for the singers to produce a variety of intervals,<br/>not to have them sing the same thing. This is a<br/>common argument in later literature, also.</p><p>Prosdocimus definitely takes a Pythagorean<br/>viewpoint on intonation, specifically preferring<br/>to avoid the near-5-limit schismatic thirds which<br/>around 1400 are coming into vogue, with the<br/>tuning chain altered to move this altered thirds<br/>into more prominent locations. So a general<br/>rule of avoiding parallel fifths in two-voice<br/>writing clearly developed well before the era<br/>where meantone is presumed to have come into<br/>vogue, around 1450-1480.</p><p>One date suggested as the point where the rule<br/>against parallel fifths becomes generally observed<br/>in multivoice writing is around 1450. The advent<br/>of meantone, which some have seen as implied by<br/>the style of Conrad Paumann&apos;s keyboard compositions,<br/>likely dates to about this time also.</p><p>Other changes are also taking place. For example,<br/>the beautiful 14th-century cadence with major<br/>third and sixth expanding to fifth and octave,<br/>with some variants with an expansion from major<br/>tenth to twelfth as shown above, is being largely<br/>replaced by other forms. Restrictions on seconds<br/>and sevenths are being more strictly observed --<br/>with these intervals, however, being harnessed<br/>in the special idiom of the suspension dissonance.</p><p>What is new is not the prominent use of thirds and<br/>sixths -- important intervals through the 13th-14th<br/>century era -- but the increasing feeling for these<br/>intervals as not only pleasant and euphonious but<br/>restful and &quot;firm.&quot; It is this &quot;firmness&quot; which<br/>meantone or 5-limit JI supports.</p><p>Both the increasing stylistic and intonational<br/>stability of thirds and sixths, and the general<br/>desire for a refined art of counterpoint where<br/>all elements are in a delicate balance, may have<br/>led to the feeling that any two voices moving<br/>in parallel fifths somehow introduced an element<br/>of disproportion.</p><p>Yet there are sometimes exceptions made in the<br/>later 15th century for certain situations<br/>involving canon or imitation for example --<br/>loopholes generally closed in 16th-century theory.</p><p>The rule against parallel fifths between any two<br/>voices of a multivoice texture thus seems to<br/>correlate with a number of changes around the<br/>mid-15th century, with meantone temperament<br/>being one of those changes. However, the causal<br/>relationships remain open to debate: correlation<br/>sometimes, but not always, involves causality.</p><p>However, the idea that a desire to avoid parallel<br/>fifths was related specifically to meantone might<br/>invite a consideration of some factors on either<br/>side of the argument.</p><p>Certainly parallel fifths _were_ favored in vocal<br/>genres such as the villanella, and also used for<br/>less &quot;serious&quot; instrumental music, including much<br/>dance music for keyboards, which would very likely<br/>have been tempered in meantone. In Italy, where<br/>such dance music was common, the tempering may<br/>have been often at 1/4-comma or 2/7-comma, making<br/>any meantone-related distaste for these fifths<br/>more pronounced; but there seems to have been<br/>no problem for performers or listeners.</p><p>Especially interesting are the statements of<br/>early composers and theorists of basso continuo<br/>or thoroughbass such as Viadana and Praetorius,<br/>who advise that the extemporized _organ_ continuo<br/>part is not obliged to avoid parallel fifths.<br/>Around 1600, organs would have generally been<br/>tempered in meantone, with Praetorius specifically<br/>favoring 1/4-comma, which in the German literature<br/>(e.g. Werckmeister) sometimes became known as the<br/>&quot;Praetorian temperament.&quot; So formally correct<br/>written counterpoint versus a more flexibly realized<br/>continuo seems to have been the relevant distinction<br/>for at least these writers, rather than the impurity<br/>of fifths in meantone.</p><p>The views of Vicenzo Galilei might be cited to support<br/>either side of the argument here. He regards the<br/>application of the rule against parallel fifths to<br/>multivoice writing as wrong and pedantic, as he also<br/>holds of many of the conventional rules restricting the<br/>use of dissonance.</p><p>Interestingly, although proposing a possible scenario<br/>for the adoption and evolution of the rule rather<br/>than citing actual medieval developments (not so well<br/>known in this era), he suggests that the rule<br/>originally applied only to two-part counterpoint,<br/>where a series of fifths might seem not to have<br/>enough variety. With three or more voices, however,<br/>the rule did not make sense to him.</p><p>Galilei was a noted advocate of 12-EDO, which he saw<br/>as a &quot;perfection&quot; of the lute in its standard fretting,<br/>and wanted to apply to harpsichord as well, although<br/>he admitted that, having tried it, he preferred 2/7-comma<br/>meantone, the tuning of his former teacher and major<br/>opponent Zarlino. One might argue either a correlation<br/>between his tolerant attitude toward parallel fifths and<br/>advocacy of 12-EDO with its near-pure fifths; or note his<br/>willingness to have these fifths played on a harpsichord<br/>in 2/7-comma meantone, whose imperfections he evidently<br/>saw not so much in terms of the greater temperament<br/>of the fifths, but the absence within a usual 12-note<br/>tuning of free transposibility.</p><p>Someone might also argue that the general adoption<br/>around 1900 of 12-EDO as a standard for keyboards<br/>correlates with the trend toward new styles favoring<br/>fourths and fifths, in a neomedieval manner or<br/>otherwise, with the free use of parallel fifths as<br/>a trademark of Debussy and others. The argument<br/>might run that standard tunings with pure or near-pure<br/>fifths correlate with the two eras, the 9th-14th<br/>centuries and the 20th-21st centuries, when parallel<br/>fifths have been permissible and even relished.</p><p>One reason I am inclined from experience to the view<br/>that tempering in itself may not be the main factor<br/>is experience with parallel fifths in systems where<br/>the tempering is in the _wide_ direction, but<br/>comparable to that of 15th-17th century meantone.</p><p>For example, 17-EDO with fifths almost 4 cents wide<br/>(705.88 cents) is comparable in impurity to a more<br/>moderate shading of 16th-century meantone at<br/>around 1/5-1/6 comma. George Secor&apos;s 17-WT has its<br/>nine nearer fifths at 707.22 cents, very close to<br/>the impurity of 1/4-comma meantone. And 22-EDO<br/>at 709.09 cents is almost identical in its degree<br/>of impurity to 1/3-comma meantone or 19-EDO.</p><p>While my own experience may say little about<br/>how European composers and theorists heard things<br/>around 1450, I can say that parallel fifths pose<br/>no problems for me in any of these wide-fifth<br/>tunings: if they did, I would have problems,<br/>since such fifths are absolutely routine in<br/>standard medieval or neomedieval cadences.</p><p>While not deciding the matter, the views<br/>of period theorists may also be of interest<br/>on this point: it is sometimes explained that<br/>those who developed the rule against these<br/>parallels did so because &quot;they did not wish<br/>to repeat perfection many times.&quot; Such fifths<br/>are disfavored in a Renaissance style not<br/>because they are too dissonant, but because<br/>they are felt as too completely blending,<br/>too &quot;simple,&quot; even when offset by the varied<br/>motions of other voices.</p><p>My apologies for possibly being detailed to<br/>a fault; and I would emphasize that exploring<br/>this kind of hypothesis can be very productive,<br/>wherever the inquiry leads, both in understanding<br/>history and getting ideas for the creation of<br/>new music.</p><p>Also, recent scholarship could have things to<br/>say that might make my suggestions a bit<br/>obsolete or even incorrect -- this happens!<br/>My initial caution doesn&apos;t mean the hypothesis<br/>is wrong, and I&apos;m very open to persuasion in<br/>either or any direction.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105563 href="#105563">ðŸ”—</a>bigAndrewM &#x3C;bigandrewm@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/16/2012 10:12:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>As always, I am amazed at the expertise and clarity of how people discuss here.</p><p>Thank you!</p></div>
