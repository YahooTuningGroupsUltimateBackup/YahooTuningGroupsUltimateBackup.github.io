However, I think it would<br/>have been more productive to have arranged the tetrads according to<br/>increasing complexity, rather than just as to their appearance as one<br/>strikes the traditional Halberstadt keyboard.</p><p>Maybe I&apos;ll do that sometime.</p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=44310 href="#44310">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2003 3:08:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_44307.html#44307">/tuning/topicId_44307.html#44307</a></p><p>Just as a further clarification:</p><p>What I&apos;m meaning is that, as one has the Blackjack *lattice* in front<br/>of him, it&apos;s really pointless to list all the different possible<br/>tetrads or chords, since one would readily see the same transposition<br/>of intervals at other points of the lattice, and the same chord<br/>really sounds pretty much alike even though it&apos;s at different pitch<br/>levels.</p><p>And the idea of just cataloging by ascending Halberstadt finger<br/>placement really isn&apos;t an *aural* organizing principle.</p><p>So, it would be better to make a graphic of increasingly dissonant<br/>chords depending on their SHAPE in the lattice, getting more<br/>dissonant, for the most part, as pitches get further from the basic<br/>simple ratio just ones.</p><p>That would be a *very* valuable study, particularly if the chords<br/>were to be shown graphically on the lattice.  People are busy now,<br/>though, so I doubt there would be any &quot;takers&quot; for this task...</p><p>In any case, that&apos;s pretty much the way I&apos;m working with the lattice<br/>now, anyway, but in a somewhat less systematic manner.</p><p>J.
