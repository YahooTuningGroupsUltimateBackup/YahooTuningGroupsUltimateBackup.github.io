Then again, it<br/>was Erv Wilson himself who placed the order for the custom keyboard.<br/>Harvey let me glance at the documents that Wilson sent him which contained<br/>the detailed keyboard design.  We kind of scratched our heads and<br/>speculated as to how somebody would play this instrument, especially with<br/>the hexagonal keys not being straight but slanted.<br/>It was definitely a novel experience fooling around with the keyboard.</p><p>Paolo</p></div><h3>pvallad1@tampabay.rr.com</h3><span>1/4/1999 2:39:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 11:11 PM 2/28/00 -0500, you wrote:<br/>&gt;From: Ricardo Sheets &lt;<a href="mailto:spliffrd@inch.com">spliffrd@inch.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Does anyone know of a softsynth that can be retuned microtonally?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;how about the SB Live card - w/soundfonts</p><p>I too have just begun my research into this kind of thing.

But my general feeling is: Never<br/>underestimate human ingenuity!</p><p>I was watching an &quot;underground&quot; video of some rollerbladers the other day<br/>at the camping store where I work.  It was just these city kids on<br/>rollerblades, doing the most _amazing_ stuff.   Totally nuts.  But, like,<br/>easily olympic-quality stuff, as far as my un-trained eye could tell.</p><p>This past July, my friend got some videos of these break-dancing (correct<br/>terminology is apparently &quot;B-boying&quot;) &quot;battles&quot; out of LA.  Some amazing<br/>stuff, like this kid spinning on his head while removing everything but his<br/>underwear and tossing it into the crowd.  Totally out of character for my<br/>friend, I asked why he got them.  I forgot he had been studying gymnastics.<br/> Half the moves are straight out of a pommel horse routine.</p><p>Did this have to do with keyboards?  Oh yeah.  It&apos;s amazing what people can<br/>do.  At least, it is to me.  No, these keyboards will not be _easier_ to<br/>play.  But they should be playable.
