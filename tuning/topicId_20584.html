Other instruments will need<br/>a fair number, for instance if you want to simulate the sound<br/>of any of the members of the violin family.</p><p>The other way round, a string player can selectively sound some of the<br/>harmonics of a note by playing it, and then lightly touching on the string<br/>in various places.</p><p>It&apos;s also possible to train to hear some of the constituent harmonics of<br/>an instrument timbre, perhaps most easily if one can play the instrument<br/>oneself.</p><p>One field where this has been developed to a high degree is the craft<br/>of bell making. The more general term for a constituent frequency of<br/>a timbre is &quot;partial&quot;, and bells have inharmonic partials - frequencies<br/>that aren&apos;t constrained to simple multiples or near multiples of the<br/>basic frequency, but cab be of any frequency.</p><p>Bells are tuned by ear, in combination with measuring instruments,<br/>with the 17th century carillioneur (and recorder player) Jacob Van<br/>Eyck pioneering the field of tuning bells.</p><p>Initerestingly, bell tuners also use ratios. They make some use of the<br/>so called sub-harmonic series (the inverses of the harmonics) for the<br/>first few partials of a bell, favouring the ratios<br/>1/12, 1/6 1/5 1/4 1/3.<br/><a href="http://www.oakcroft13.fsnet.co.uk/lehr.htm">http://www.oakcroft13.fsnet.co.uk/lehr.htm</a></p><p>Another pattern of partials that concern bell founders are<br/>doublets - closely spaced pairs of partials caused by a small deviation<br/>of the bell from perfect symmetry.</p><p>Here is a fascinating web site about bell partials, which<br/>also has an excellent user - friendly program, designed for bells,<br/>that one can also use to find the partials in any instrument.<br/><a href="http://www.oakcroft13.fsnet.co.uk/index.htm">http://www.oakcroft13.fsnet.co.uk/index.htm</a></p><p>The numbers such as 9/8, 6/5 and 5/4 that one sees so often in definitions<br/>of scales often come straight from the harmonic series. So for instance,<br/>you get the 5/4 - major third, from the ratio of the fifth and fourth<br/>multiple of the asic note. The 6/5 is a minor third, 3/2 is a major<br/>fifth and 9&apos;8 is a whole tone.</p><p>10/9 is another form of the whole tone. If you play harmonics<br/>8 9 10 12, you get four of the five notes of the just intonation<br/>pentatonic scale. 8/8 = 1/1, 9/8, 10/8 = 5/4, and 12/8 = 3/2.</p><p>It is perfectly possible to play this fragment scale on the harmonics<br/>of a string instrument (and on other instruemnts that can be played<br/>in this way).</p><p>The missing note is the major sixth which is a third _below_ the<br/>octave, so is at a ratio of 8/5 (i.e. 4/5 of 2/1).</p><p>You won&apos;t find this one in the same fragment of the harmonic series<br/>as it would be at a ratio of 64/5 to the fundamental.</p><p>However, if you multiply all the numbers by 5, you can then find the<br/>entire pentatonic scale in the harmonic series as</p><p>(8 9 10 12 64/5) times 5<br/>= 40 45 50 60 64</p><p>These harmonics are a bit high even for a stringed instrument<br/>(can a skilled player play these? anyone know).</p><p>Some instruments use notes from the harmonic series when played<br/>normally, notably the natural trumpet of course.</p><p>It is also possible to play virtuoso tunes on a hosepipe by sounding<br/>harmonics, and a skilled player can get a most interesting<br/>pure fluty sound in this way.</p><p>This simple example introduces some of the ideas that will be<br/>needed for more advanced studies of the harmonic series and<br/>of scales in ratios notation.</p><p>There is quite a degree of interest also in scales based on<br/>inharmonic partials - i.e. using the constituent frequencies<br/>of a timbre such as a bell sound to make a scale. There is<br/>also some speculation that the Indonesian gamelan scales may<br/>have originally been inspired partly in this way.<br/>(Ok to say this?)</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=20585 href="#20585">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>3/30/2001 10:08:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Correction:</p><p>The missing note is the major sixth which is a minor third _below_ the<br/>octave, so is at a ratio of 5/3 (i.e. 5/6 of 2/1).
