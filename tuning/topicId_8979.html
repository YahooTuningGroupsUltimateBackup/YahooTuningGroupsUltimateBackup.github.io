On second thought<br/>maybe I should have said the deeply scaloped neck is more<br/>sitar than guitar. Since I was at NAMM and actually heard<br/>the thing, I can tell you that yes, it does sound like<br/>a sitar. Obviously without moveable frets or sympathetic<br/>strings it is not a sitar.</p><p>It&apos;s more sitar than the Danelectro/Jerry Jones Electric Sitar<br/>or Baby Sitar:</p><p><a href="http://www.jerryjonesguitars.com/index.htm">http://www.jerryjonesguitars.com/index.htm</a></p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
