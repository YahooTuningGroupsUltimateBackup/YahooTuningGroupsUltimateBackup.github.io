The<br/>statement was about composers who *need* to be in front of a<br/>keyboard, implying that they couldn&apos;t hear their music otherwise. The<br/>point (IMHO) is therefore that a good composer should be able to hear<br/>their own music in their head, and not need a keyboard to do it.<br/>Music that is neither heard *nor* played, but simply worked out by<br/>system, would be considered the worst according to this attitude,<br/>contrary to what you say. At least that&apos;s the way I read the above<br/>statement given how divine Bach&apos;s music is.</p></div><h3><a id=61245 href="#61245">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2005 4:48:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Who hears heady-theoretical or serial music in their head?</p><p>Supposedly Milton Babbitt...</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=61297 href="#61297">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/10/2005 8:23:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Aaron,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thursday 06 October 2005 1:16 pm, Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I read once a quote attributed to Bach that said composers<br/>&gt; &gt; who need to be in front of a keyboard are basically no good,<br/>&gt; &gt; and that the best way to compose was with pen and paper only.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes...he called them &quot;Clavier-Ritters&quot;.....&quot;knights of<br/>&gt; the keyboard&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I love Bach, but in a sense, I don&apos;t like that attitude...<br/>&gt; taken to the extreme, it leads to heady-theoretical music<br/>&gt; that tends to sound like shit.<br/>&gt; Witness most serialism.</p><p>Hey, that&apos;s just *your* opinion!

Beethoven, who<br/>was also renowned as an improviser at the keyboard,<br/>wasn&apos;t able to hear any of his greatest pieces, because<br/>they were all written after he had gone deaf.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
