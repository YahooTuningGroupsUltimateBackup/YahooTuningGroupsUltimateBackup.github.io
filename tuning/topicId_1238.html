I&apos;ll have a quick stab now,<br/>apologies that this isn&apos;t properly thought out.</p><p>There&apos;s an explanation of lattices on my website at<br/><a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/lattice.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/lattice.htm</a></p><p>Pianos, ah yes.  I&apos;ve played a lot on cheap synths and very little on<br/>pianos.  I much prefer the synth keyboard, mostly I&apos;m sure through<br/>familiarity but also because my hands are fairly weak and not up to piano<br/>keys.  Trying electric pianos, I found it easier to control the dynamics,<br/>but harder to play fast.  When I have played an acoustic piano, I found it<br/>very difficult to even get a sound out of it.  The point is, don&apos;t write off<br/>those synth keyboards just because you were trained with something else.  As<br/>regards the keys, yes, there are no substitutes for natural materials.<br/>However, some people are working very hard on this and claim to be making<br/>progress.  As regards the sounds, most synths do sound crap, but they can be<br/>improved much like pianos can.</p><p>I had &quot;heard of&quot; Phish before that e-mail conversation with Carl Lumma, but<br/>only because Paul Erlich had previously mentioned them on the list.  Nobody<br/>else in my office even knew the name.  Except that they&apos;d heard of Fish ex<br/>of Marillion, of course.</p><p>That&apos;s all for now,</p><p>                    Graham</p></div>
