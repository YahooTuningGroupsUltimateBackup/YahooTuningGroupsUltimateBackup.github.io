However, if we follow 13th-14th century<br/>theorists as well as the practical music of the era, major and minor<br/>thirds (81:64, 32:27) might be described as unstable but _relatively_<br/>concordant. To borrow Ludmila Ulehla&apos;s useful terminology, they are<br/>neither stable concords nor clear discords, but &quot;dual-purpose&quot;<br/>sonorities.</p><p>With major and minor sixths (27:16, 128:81), a typical 13th-century<br/>viewpoint regards M6 about on a par with M2 (9:8) and m7 (16:9) as<br/>_relatively_ tense (more so than M3 or m3) but somewhat &quot;compatible.&quot;<br/>However, m6 is often classed with m2 (256:243), M7 (243:128), and A4<br/>or d5 (729:512, 1024:729) as a sharp or &quot;perfect&quot; discord.</p><p>In the typical &quot;modern&quot; theory of the 14th-century Ars Nova, major<br/>sixths and eventually minor sixths also tend to be grouped together<br/>with the thirds as &quot;imperfect concords,&quot; while M2 and m7 are regarded<br/>as clearly &quot;discordant.&quot;</p><p>A 14th-century composer such as Guillaume de Machaut sometimes seem to<br/>follow the &quot;modern&quot; view in his free treatment of sixths as well as<br/>thirds, and the &quot;ancient&quot; (i.e. 13th-century) view in his free<br/>treatment of M2, m7, and M9.</p><p>Note generally that Pythagorean or 3-limit JI, like many JI systems,<br/>tends to optimize the concord of intervals recognized as richly stable<br/>(here fifths and fourths), while making some other intervals _more_<br/>tense than they might be in some compromise system such as 12-tone<br/>equal temperament (12-tet). Likewise, in 5-limit, the rather tense m7<br/>at 9:5 contrasts with the Pythagorean 16:9 and the 7-limit 7:4.</p><p>&gt; Also, a JI diatonic scale has a wolf 5th between the 2nd and 6th<br/>&gt; degrees, so it is not possible for _all_ the notes of the scale to<br/>&gt; be consonant with the reverberations of previously sounded notes.</p><p>At first blush, I might be tempted to argue that such a tuning<br/>often suggests more than 12 notes per octave -- but this would not<br/>address your issue of what might be termed &quot;diagonal dissonances&quot;<br/>between notes of different sonorities, which the acoustical setting<br/>can in effect &quot;verticalize&quot; through the effect of prolonged tones.</p><p>Of course, quite apart from Wolf intervals, any prolongation of this<br/>kind will inevitably lead to dissonances such as minor seconds whether<br/>melodic lines move by a semitone -- except maybe in pieces such as<br/>Bartok&apos;s &quot;Major Sevenths, Minor Seconds,&quot; where these vertical<br/>intervals are treated as concords.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
