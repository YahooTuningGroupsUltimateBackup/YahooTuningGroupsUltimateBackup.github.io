Makes sense to me; and, I figure Bach was a rather curious feller, and since he loved the sound of the lute so much, why not tune it like the lutenists do, just to hear what it sounds like? Again, makes sense, and no biggie, in my mind...I don&apos;t think Bach was the sort of artist who felt like he needed to limit himself in any way...it would only take a few minutes for him to tune in any case. And, after a few mugs of that stout German beer, probably didn&apos;t matter much anyway.<br/>   Also, I&apos;d like to know more about the earlier lute tunings...Reinhard had a pic of a lute once on the cover of PITCH which was tuned differently from 12; anybody have some info? I know Galileo&apos;s dad suggested setting lute frets to 18/17, which is 99 cents, and they may well have fudged that to 100 cents.<br/>Best...Hstick   <a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p></div><h3><a id=75573 href="#75573">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/2008 11:07:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;zoukboy_2000&quot; &lt;rwlandes@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps 12TET was common on the lute by Bach&apos;s time, but it was fairly<br/>&gt; common to approximate other temperaments on the lute by placing the<br/>&gt; movable gut frets to unequal divisions. 1/6 comma meantone was/is<br/>&gt; pretty common for earlier repertoire...<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; Roger Landes<br/>&gt; rwlandes@...<br/>&gt; Website: <a href="http://rogerlandes.com">http://rogerlandes.com</a></p><p>Any citations / references / evidence for that exact claim? Are there<br/>any historical depictions of lutes with meantone-like fret spacing?</p><p>Of course putting the frets to unequal divisions does produce *some*<br/>sort of unequal tuning. Frets could also be angled. Whether the result<br/>is anything like a regular temperament is another question.</p><p>The tuning of open strings was, so far as I know (book by Ledbetter on<br/>French Renaissance/Baroque lute and harpsichord music) quite variable,<br/>and mostly not regular, in the sense that the intervals between<br/>successive strings were not the same. For example A-D-f-a-d&apos;-f&apos; or<br/>D-G-c-e-a-d&apos;.<br/>Given this irregularity, unequal fret spacings could produce<br/>significantly different portions of a meantone system on different<br/>strings. To be more precise, some strings would produce enharmonics<br/>which might or might not be musically useful.<br/>For the 1st fret, if some meantone is assumed, you had, say,<br/>Bb-Eb-gb-bb-gb-eb or Eb-Ab-db-f-bb-eb; or A#-D#-f#-a#-d#-f# or<br/>D#-G#-c#-e#-a#-d#. Now a g-flat will not go with the f# produced by<br/>the 4th fret on the D-string, conversely an A# will not go with a Bb<br/>from the 3rd fret on G or 8th fret on D.</p><p>None of this is prohibitive, but it would require a lot of care and<br/>attention from both composer and fret-positioner to get everything<br/>lined up within a single composition. Now what happens, let&apos;s say, in<br/>another piece when the f strings are tuned up to f#? This &apos;D major<br/>tuning&apos; was also relatively well known. Or when some other string is<br/>taken up or down a tone or semitone? You would have to recalculate<br/>everything you thought you knew about which enharmonic notes were to<br/>occur on which strings.</p><p>The fact that many different tunings of open strings were employed at<br/>the same time, to me, strongly suggests that there was no systematic<br/>inequality of semitones by unequal fret placement. It would just be<br/>too complex to take account of. Unless it can be shown that there was<br/>a well-established convention of unequal fret placement, understood by<br/>both composers and players, rather than ad-hoc tweaking towards what<br/>seems to sound better in this or that chord or piece.<br/>~~~T~~~</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;microstick@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    I&apos;ll betcha Bach tuned his lute/clavier to 12 tone equal temp<br/>&gt; cause that&apos;s how lutes were tuned...Hstick<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=75618 href="#75618">ðŸ”—</a>zoukboy_2000 &#x3C;rwlandes@taosnet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/2008 9:31:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sure.
