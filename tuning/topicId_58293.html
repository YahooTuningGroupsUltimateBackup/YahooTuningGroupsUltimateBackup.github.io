(5*9)+(2*5)=55</p><p>  &gt; I would be much happier if it was said that the major<br/>  &gt; whole tone is the 9/8th of an open string, but could<br/>  &gt; be tempered depending on the tuning.</p><p>  i&apos;m sure that would be fine for Turkish music ... but<br/>  not for either of the Mozarts. European common-practice<br/>  music always tempered out the syntonic-comma, which means<br/>  that there has to be a mean-tone, not a major and minor<br/>  whole-tone. it&apos;s important to this repertoire that there<br/>  is no distinction between different whole-tones -- there<br/>  is only one size of whole-tone, and thus it is a meantone.</p><p>  -monz</p></div><h3><a id=58298 href="#58298">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2005 2:15:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ozan Yarman wrote:</p><p>&gt; Do you approve of the fact that the Arel-Ezgi notation utilizes F# as 4 &gt; commas<br/>&gt; higher than F within the G Major Rast scale (whose third degree B is &gt; lowered by<br/>&gt; a ditonic comma to achieve a perfect fifth) in a tuning which is &gt; practically 53tET?</p><p>&gt; I was entertaining the idea that the apotome sharp, as George Secor tought &gt; me,<br/>&gt; equals 7 fifths minus 4 octaves.

I have to agree with you there too, as I&apos;m a fan of international standards (on a similar note, I have a major beef with the fact that most my fellow Americans avoid using SI/Metric so much and stick to English measurements). Now I know a Turkish or Armenian oud is usually tuned a major second higher than an Arabic oud, so Rast on the former is higher than Rast on the latter, but that&apos;s hardly different than how clarinets can be in A, B-flat, C, D and E-flat (and there&apos;s also the metal &quot;Turkish clarinet&quot; in G).</p><p>[As an afterthought, when I got my Egyptian oud, I didn&apos;t think about how the tuning would match up with guitar, which is tuned to roughly E minor, so I probably should&apos;ve gotten a Turkish instrument, or have the guitar tuned a whole step down, nu-metal-like.]</p><p>~Danny~</p></div><h3><a id=58299 href="#58299">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2005 3:46:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Ozan and Danny,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Danny Wier&quot; &lt;dawiertx@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Ozan Yarman wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Do you approve of the fact that the Arel-Ezgi notation<br/>&gt; &gt; utilizes F# as 4 commas higher than F within the G Major<br/>&gt; &gt; Rast scale (whose third degree B is lowered by a ditonic<br/>&gt; &gt; comma to achieve a perfect fifth) in a tuning which is<br/>&gt; &gt; practically 53tET?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was entertaining the idea that the apotome sharp, as<br/>&gt; &gt; George Secor tought me, equals 7 fifths minus 4 octaves.</p><p>the standard way of notating that is with<br/>the 2,3-monzo |-11 7, &gt; .</p><p>the -11 exponent of 2 could be expressed (-7-4), because:</p><p>. a &quot;5th&quot; with ratio 3/2 has the 2,3-monzo |-1 1, &gt; , so</p><p>. seven 5ths  = |-1 1, &gt; * 7 = |-7 7, &gt; = ratio 2187/128.</p><p>then, subtracting 4 octaves is |1 0, &gt; * -4 = |-4 0, &gt; .</p><p>so |-7 7, &gt;<br/> + |-4 0, &gt;<br/>------------<br/> = |-11 7, &gt; = ratio 2187/2048 = the pythagorean apotome.</p><p>a lattice of the pythagorean chain with F = n^0 :</p><p>|----- apotome ------|</p><p>0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 = exponents of 3<br/>+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+-<br/>F  C  G  D  A  E  B  F#</p><p>&gt; &gt; It is clear that Turkish Music notation is fundamentally<br/>&gt; &gt; flawed in this respect.</p><p>how so? an explanation might make an interesting<br/>Encyclopedia entry.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not Monz, obviously,</p><p>it&apos;s OK, i am. ;-)</p><p>&gt; but I need to comment myself.

Maybe he<br/>  &gt; wanted a limma alteration for sharps to make F#/Gb and<br/>  &gt; other enharmonic pairs the same pitch. And usually sharps<br/>  &gt; tend to be lowered a comma anyway because they&apos;re found<br/>  &gt; in makamlar with Hicaz tetrachords. It&apos;s still confusing,<br/>  &gt; and I have to agree with you - F# should be 5 commas higher<br/>  &gt; than F, not 4.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; And if enharmonic pairs only map to the same pitch in<br/>  &gt; 12, 24, 36 etc. tone and not in 17, 19, 22, 29, 31, 41, 43<br/>  &gt; and so on, why should they be the same in 53-tone?</p><p>  hmm ... i&apos;m wondering if there are other tunings besides<br/>  12n-edo (i.e., the aristoxenean family) which have similar<br/>  enharmonically equivalent pairs based on the familiar<br/>  letter-name nominals with sharps and flats. anyone care<br/>  to post a list? ... that would be a great addition to<br/>  the Encyclopedia &quot;enharmonic equivalence&quot; page.</p><p>  anyway, in 53-edo,</p><p>  . 4 commas make a diatonic semitone (&quot;limma&quot;,<br/>  if emulating pythagorean tuning), and</p><p>  . 5 commas make a chromatic semitone (&quot;apotome&quot;<br/>  in pythagorean).</p><p>  so according to a 53-edo notation, F# should<br/>  be 5 commas higher than F.</p><p>  i don&apos;t know of a way for enharmonic pairs to be equal<br/>  in 53-edo, unless some totally different notation<br/>  (i.e, not based on the pythagorean/meantone letters)<br/>  is used.</p><p>  every equal temperament will exhibit<br/>  enharmonic equivalence, because they all<br/>  temper out certain commas. whatever the notation<br/>  is, enharmonic equivalence will occur somewhere.</p><p>  i&apos;m wondering if the phenomenon of enharmonic equivalence<br/>  has anything to do with whether or not the cardinality size<br/>  of the set of nominals, is the same as the number<br/>  of notes inside the periodicity-block. ...?</p><p>  &gt; &gt; Also, do you approve of the practice which allows<br/>  &gt; &gt; the standart diapason (A4=440Hz) to be altered in<br/>  &gt; &gt; Turkish Music regardless of the inclusion of voices<br/>  &gt; &gt; or strings in unison monody? The above-mentioned<br/>  &gt; &gt; G-Major Rast is then rendered as D Major Rast in<br/>  &gt; &gt; &grave;Bolahenk Key&grave; (Transposes ~260 Hz C4=Rast a whole tone<br/>  &gt; &gt; above to D) with the note names preserved as they are.<br/>  &gt; &gt;<br/>  &gt; &gt; This is a practice which I find absurd and wrong.</p><p>  this, and Danny&apos;s follow-up comments, sound to me just<br/>  like the nonsense of transposition on so many European<br/>  instruments. i don&apos;t know enough about Turkish music<br/>  to comment further than that, but basically, i also<br/>  agree that this is silly.</p><p>  -monz<br/>  <a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>  microtonal music software</p></div>
