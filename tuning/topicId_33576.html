But if we&apos;re talking about<br/>&gt; the _intervals_ 31:16 and 125:64, then I&apos;m not. I thought we were<br/>&gt; talking about the _intervals_ 31:16 and 125:64, since Monz invoked<br/>&gt; harmonic entropy to justify his point of view, and harmonic entropy<br/>&gt; concerns _intervals_, not _pitches_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [klaus]<br/>&gt; &gt; Examples: 5/4 consists of the primes 2, 2, and 5. The second<br/>&gt; &gt; 2 is taken to the power of 0, and I add 5+2+1, 8. 25/24<br/>&gt; &gt; consists of the prime 5 twice (-&gt; 5+1), 3 once, and 2 three<br/>&gt; &gt; times (-&gt; 2+1+0.5).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The plausibility value is 5+3+3.5, 11.5.<br/>&gt; &gt; 125/64 consists of 5 three times (-&gt; 5+1+0.2) and 2 six<br/>&gt; &gt; times (-&gt; 2+1+0.5+0.25+0.125+0.0625) and is thus 10.1375.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 31/16 already has prime 31. With the reduced factors of 2<br/>&gt; &gt; added, this is 34.875. Very different.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What to make of it? I&apos;m supposing two things: a) listeners<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t readily jump to interpretations implying a much higher<br/>&gt; &gt; value, and b) ratios with higher values need to be tuned<br/>&gt; &gt; much more accurately.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [paul]<br/>&gt; My point of view is that there are two levels of ratio-<br/>&gt; interpretation: (1) the actual psychophysical character of an<br/>&gt; _interval_, which is what harmonic entropy talks about; (2) the<br/>&gt; action of the music theorist when faced with a piece of music which<br/>&gt; moves around, can follow the movement musically speaking, and hence<br/>&gt; decides to multiply the _interval_ ratios to derive the _pitch_<br/>&gt; ratios. 125/64 is a result of the _latter_ process, and in reckoning<br/>&gt; its complexity (like Barlow, Wilson, and many others) you take into<br/>&gt; account the number (or some function thereof) of degrees of musical<br/>&gt; memory and movement recognition that are involved. Then, based on<br/>&gt; some picture of what the music might be like, you _combine_ the types<br/>&gt; of reckoning in (1) and (2).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I thought Monz was talking about, since he invoked harmonic<br/>&gt; entropy, was strictly the first part. This part alone merits serious<br/>&gt; study, because if you don&apos;t get part (1) right, how can you combine<br/>&gt; it with your model of (2) afterwards?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So if a piece of music (or a collection of pitches :) )  uses<br/>&gt; &gt; an interval of around 1160c &quot;understandably&quot; as 125/64<br/>&gt; &gt; (1159c),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So you mean a _pitch_ labeled 125/64, then?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and there is another one 10-15c smaller , this will<br/>&gt; &gt; more likely be heard as 35/18 (1151c) than as a 31/16<br/>&gt; &gt; (1145c), unless the context consists of the harmonic series<br/>&gt; &gt; exclusively.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK . . . but you pretty much have to assume a context that includes<br/>&gt; 5/4 and 25/16 for 125/64 to be &quot;understandable&quot; in the first place,<br/>&gt; don&apos;t you?<br/>&gt;</p><p>ok, I should have specified what I was really thinking of</p><p>not of bare dyads, but rather in a systemic sense, i.e.<br/>listening to a piece of &quot;JI&quot; (whatever that means) music,<br/>likely to have lots of 5-limit harmonies in it, and an<br/>instance of a 31:16</p><p>in a case like that, the listener is very likely to<br/>&quot;understand&quot; 31:16 as 125:64</p><p>now i believe paul will agree with that, right paul?</p><p>but i might have contradicted myself by starting from<br/>two logically incompatible assumptions</p><p>since we&apos;re making a big deal about context, here&apos;s the orignal<br/>statement i made in its original context:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [JG]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that - in a system considering sinusoidal<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sound source &quot;voices&quot; - the distinction of whether the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *lower* valued primes or the *higher* valued primes hold<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a more significant place would be a hard thing to establish.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it&apos;s a foundation of my theory that the brain<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;understands&quot; the lowest primes far more easily than higher<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ones.  This would be primarily because our perception of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; pitch is multiplicative rather than additive.  The lowest<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; primes, as factors in ratios, form a sort of ultimate<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; reduced basis for our comprehension of harmonic relationships.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JG: But larger valued primes are, themselves, irreducible,<br/>&gt; &gt; are they not?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, absolutely.  But let&apos;s take this example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; prime-factor<br/>&gt;  2  3  5 31       ratio      ~cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -4  0  0  1  =    31/16     1145.035572<br/>&gt; -6  0  3  0  =   125/64     1158.941142<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s a difference between them of only ~13.90556913<br/>&gt; (a bit more than 1/2-comma).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In a context where these two ratios would be audibly<br/>&gt; indistinguishable, a listener will probably perceive<br/>&gt; 31/16 *as* 125/64, because of the lower prime-factors.</p><p>[the prime-factor 5 label was erroneously given as 11 before]</p><p>so i suppose that a piece &quot;likely to have lots of 5-limit<br/>harmonies in it&quot; would not actually provide &quot;a context<br/>where these two ratios would be audibly indistinguishable&quot;</p><p>hmmm ...</p><p>i think maybe what it boils down to is that i must believe<br/>that when listening to actual music that has a texture<br/>generally thicker than dyadic, the additional notes<br/>influence our sense of harmonic perception in ways which do<br/>not equate to the sum of the affect of the dyads involved</p><p>this is along the lines of why no-one thinks the 1/(6:5:4)<br/>triad sounds anywhere near as concordant as the 4:5:6, while<br/>they both have exactly the same intervallic composition</p><p>again, my theory is that we boil everything down to a<br/>prime-factor lattice and &quot;plot&quot; the pitches as we hear them</p><p>and of course, the prime basis of everyone&apos;s lattice is<br/>different, and the same person&apos;s lattice varies at any<br/>given time too</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2002 3:01:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; ok, I should have specified what I was really thinking of<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; not of bare dyads, but rather in a systemic sense, i.e.<br/>&gt; listening to a piece of &quot;JI&quot; (whatever that means) music,<br/>&gt; likely to have lots of 5-limit harmonies in it, and an<br/>&gt; instance of a 31:16<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; in a case like that, the listener is very likely to<br/>&gt; &quot;understand&quot; 31:16 as 125:64<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; now i believe paul will agree with that, right paul?</p><p>are you talking about the _intervals_ 31:16 and 125:64, or the<br/>_pitches_ 31/16 and 125/64?</p><p>&gt; i think maybe what it boils down to is that i must believe<br/>&gt; that when listening to actual music that has a texture<br/>&gt; generally thicker than dyadic, the additional notes<br/>&gt; influence our sense of harmonic perception in ways which do<br/>&gt; not equate to the sum of the affect of the dyads involved</p><p>how about a context for this example</p><p>&gt; this is along the lines of why no-one thinks the 1/(6:5:4)<br/>&gt; triad sounds anywhere near as concordant as the 4:5:6, while<br/>&gt; they both have exactly the same intervallic composition</p><p>but that&apos;s an issue which I think can be settled in realm (1) from my<br/>last essay in this thread, so nothing like these realm (2) issues you<br/>seem to me referring to.</p></div>
