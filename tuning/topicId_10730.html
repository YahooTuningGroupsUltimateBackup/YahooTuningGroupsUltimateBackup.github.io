The dominant seventh chord was<br/>used to &quot;imply&quot; 4:5:6:7, and the half-diminished seventh for<br/>1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4. Unfortunately, 12-tET makes errors of up to 33 cents<br/>in the intervals in these chords. Fortunately, these chords are<br/>available at all positions in the scale, making for a total of 24 (12<br/>dominant sevenths and 12 half-dimished sevenths).</p><p>It is interesting to consider ways of modifying 12-tET (retaining a<br/>rough scale of &quot;semitones&quot;) to improve some of these tetrads. There<br/>is a tradeoff, though -- the better the good tetrads, the fewer of<br/>them we can have.</p><p>The first way is to take the subset of 22-tET I call the &quot;symmetrical<br/>dodecatonic scale&quot;. This is much like the file erl.kbm Joseph Pehrson<br/>mentioned except that F is raised by 1 step of 22-tET. So<br/>the &quot;semitones&quot; are all 2 steps of 22-tET, except that between F and<br/>F#, and between B and C, they&apos;re only 1 step of 22-tET. Then we get<br/>the following tetrads with all intervals within 17 cents of JI:</p><p>4:5:6:7:<br/>D F# A C<br/>A C# E G<br/>E G# B D<br/>G# C D# F#<br/>D# G A# C#<br/>A# D F G#</p><p>1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4:<br/>A C D# G<br/>E G A# D<br/>B D F A<br/>D# F# A C#<br/>A# C# E G#<br/>F G# B D#</p><p>So, by restricting ourselves to 12 tetrads instead of 24, we can cut<br/>the maximum error with respect to JI in half.</p><p>With this many tetrads, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if we could find some<br/>significant passages of tetradic music, by say Wagner or Stravinsky,<br/>that if suitably transposed would come out sounding very smooth in<br/>this tuning. It doesn&apos;t hurt that all diminished seventh chords in<br/>this tuning sound very nice as well.</p><p>In the next tuning, we will cut the number of tetrads in<br/>half again, down to 6, but the maximum error with respect to JI will<br/>be reduced by almost a factor of 10. This is of course the Fokker-<br/>Lumma-Keenan scale, (lumma.scl, fokker_12t.scl, and fokker_12t2.scl<br/>in the Scala archive are all good examples of this scale, with very<br/>tiny differences between them).<br/>Mapped so that 1/1 = C, we get the following tetrads within 2 cents<br/>of JI:</p><p>4:5:6:7:<br/>C E G Bb<br/>Db F Ab B<br/>F A C Eb</p><p>1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4:<br/>C Eb Gb Bb<br/>Db E G B<br/>Ab B D Gb</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if one could find a great example in the repertory of an<br/>excerpt that features just these tetrads (or a transposition thereof)<br/>and none others, but perhaps one could compose a new example that<br/>featured the near-just tetrads of this scale.</p><p>Finally, if one is a stickler for exact JI, one can only have 4 7-<br/>limit tetrads in a roughly even 12-tone scale. There are many ways to<br/>do this (including several ways of &quot;de-tempering&quot; the Fokker-Lumma-<br/>Keenan scale). Here is the lattice diagram of one from Paul Hahn,<br/>Mills Tuning Digest 1598 (12/1/98):</p><p>42:25------21:20-------21:16<br/>   \&apos;-.   .-&apos;/ \&apos;-.   .-&apos;/ \&apos;-.<br/>    \  6:5--/---\--3:2--/---\-15:8<br/>     \ /|\ /     \ /|\ /     \ /|<br/>      \ | /       \ | /       \ |<br/>     / \|/ \     / \|/ \     / \|<br/>    /  7:5---------7:4--------35:32<br/>   /.-&apos;   &apos;-.\ /.-&apos;   &apos;-.\ /.-&apos;<br/> 8:5---------1:1---------5:4</p><p>which you will note has two hexanies in addition to the four tetrads.<br/>An equally good scale is obtained by substituting 25:15 for 8:5 and<br/>105:64 for 42:25:</p><p>            21:20-------21:16------105:64<br/>          .-&apos;/ \&apos;-.   .-&apos;/ \&apos;-.   .-&apos;/<br/>       6:5--/---\--3:2--/---\-15:8  /<br/>        |\ /     \ /|\ /     \ /|\ /<br/>        | /       \ | /       \ | /<br/>        |/ \     / \|/ \     / \|/ \<br/>       7:5---------7:4--------35:32 \<br/>          &apos;-.\ /.-&apos;   &apos;-.\ /.-&apos;   &apos;-.\<br/>             1:1---------5:4--------25:16</p><p>Thanks to the other Paul!</p></div>
