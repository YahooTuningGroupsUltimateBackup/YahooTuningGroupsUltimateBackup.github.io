I say any meantone is fine for a &apos;major<br/>&gt; 6/9&apos; chord, while the augmented triad and diminished seventh chord<br/>&gt; definitely cry out for something close to 12-tET. What these chords have in<br/>&gt; common, though, is that their ideal tuning is something different from JI.</p><p>Now that I better understand (thanks to you and others) the ongoing context<br/>of this point, I have a question and a comment.</p><p>Question: Would not the &quot;crying out for...12-tET&quot; most likely occur when<br/>tonality is not clear--as in a chromatic transitional passage. When the<br/>destination key of a diminished-seventh chord is known (by singers and/or<br/>string players), wouldn&apos;t the functional tritone (in an &quot;incomplete dominant<br/>ninth,&quot; ala Piston) &quot;refocus&quot; as the leading tone pulls upward toward tonic<br/>while the chord seventh drastically pulls downward (and likely the ninth, as<br/>well)--even when the destination tonic is temporary?</p><p>Comment: I suspect that the tonal destination of a well-tuned (JI?)<br/>dominant-function diminished seventh chord is audibly evident even before it<br/>resolves. Also, the functional augmented triad likely offers a clue toward a<br/>destination tonality by means of a &quot;high third&quot; tuning in relation to the<br/>functional root, causing one member (of the three) to emerge as the leading<br/>tone.</p><p>(Any grad students out there in need of a topic?)</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>Paul H.

It is well-measured and modeled in the<br/>psychoacoustical literature. William Sethares has based most of his musical<br/>publications and theories around this phenomemon. The point is, if you play<br/>an augmented triad or diminished seventh chord outside any specific<br/>voice-leading context, considerations of sensory consonance will lead to a<br/>tuning closer to the 12-tET one than a JI one.</p></div>
