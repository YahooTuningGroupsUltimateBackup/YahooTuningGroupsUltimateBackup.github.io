But I&apos;m not sure,<br/>reading them, which category MIDI files would fall into.</p><p>The copyrighted MIDI files are just &quot;licensed&quot; through the Yahoo site<br/>to be played by anyone accessing the &quot;files&quot; area.  [That is, if<br/>the MIDI files ARE copyrighted.  Can somebody copyright a MIDI<br/>performance rendition of music of the past??  If so, then it&apos;s like a<br/>&quot;translation&quot; and there could be a potential problem... if the guy<br/>who originally sequenced the material was not notified and finds out]</p><p>Essentially we have TWO copyrights... apparently the &quot;sequence<br/>copyright&quot; and your OWN retuning.  If you were to stay on Yahoo, you<br/>have given your implicit permission to the Terms of Service license<br/>agreement.  They assume people have read it.  However, clearing the<br/>&quot;original sequence&quot; with the maker of the sequence is another matter.</p><p>I would presume, if you were to contact this person, he would be<br/>DELIGHTED that his work is available in various tuning forms on the<br/>Internet.  But then, I can&apos;t really speak for somebody else...</p><p>Yahoo has, as outlined in the terms of service, NO copyright claim to<br/>the material.</p><p>If the original MIDI sequences are copyrighted, you should<br/>have, technically, obtained the right to retransmit or &quot;license&quot;<br/>them, whether they are on Yahoo or on &quot;Adaptune.&quot;  In other words,<br/>you are still doing EXACTLY what Yahoo is doing, only, apparently,<br/>you didn&apos;t inform the original &quot;MIDI sequence maker&quot; of your OWN<br/>&quot;Terms of Service!&quot;</p><p>Therefore, I have  moved the files I had posted there to my Colorado<br/>web page, accessible through<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    <a href="http://www.adaptune.com">http://www.adaptune.com</a></p><p>See above.  Same difference, but, apparently with no &quot;Terms of<br/>Service&quot; explicitly outlined.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve put a link from the tuning files to there.  Yahoo is now free<br/>to  spread that link around all they like; they don&apos;t own the content<br/>of my web.<br/>&gt;</p><p>No... but they didn&apos;t &quot;own the content&quot; on the Yahoo site<br/>either.  However, perhaps you don&apos;t own the content of the original<br/>MIDI sequences, either.  I would confer with the &quot;owner(s)...&quot;</p><p>Did the person doing the sequencing put a &quot;copyright&quot; sign on it?</p><p>The original musical material is in the public domain.  Perhaps a<br/>MIDI rendition is somewhat like a &quot;translation,&quot; in which case, there<br/>IS a copyright problem.  I would need to talk to a &quot;music lawyer,&quot;<br/>though, to confirm this...</p><p>&gt; As for paranoia, I&apos;d rather err on the side of caution.  I don&apos;t<br/>want to risk &quot;giving away&quot; others&apos; work (the original sequencers of<br/>the files I&apos;ve tuned), something I have no right to do.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Please explain how putting them on your own page, rather than on<br/>Yahoo makes this difference?  I would say it makes matters WORSE...<br/>You haven&apos;t expressed any explicit &quot;Terms of Service...&quot;  (!)</p><p>Again, Yahoo has made it clear that they do NOT own the copyright of<br/>any materials on the site.  They can&apos;t &quot;spread anything around&quot;<br/>(this sound like an infection!) without the permission of the<br/>copyright holder!</p><p>All they can do, under the terms of their &quot;non-exclusive&quot; license, is<br/>make the material available on the Tuning List Yahoo-groups site.</p><p>&gt; Whether there is another list hosting choice that would offer more<br/>&gt; unambiguous terms is an open question,</p><p>The terms of service are very clear.  Actually, I finally read them.<br/>There is nothing ambiguous in them at all.  Lawyers have to eat too,<br/>after all!!</p><p>&gt;but if one could be found,<br/>I&apos;d agree with moving, and I have so voted in Daniel Wolf&apos;s poll.</p><p>I believe this is a real mistake, and a severe and unnecessary<br/>interruption!  Let&apos;s not be yahoos!  I mean, let&apos;s BE Yahoos!</p><p>________ _____ ___ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=18292 href="#18292">ðŸ”—</a>Rosati &#x3C;dante.interport@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2001 1:03:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: John A. deLaubenfels [<a href="mailto:jdl@adaptune.com">mailto:jdl@adaptune.com</a>]<br/>&gt;Then for Dante&apos;s poll, I voted for the interval 32768:32805, since my<br/>&gt;actual favorite, 7:4, wasn&apos;t listed.
