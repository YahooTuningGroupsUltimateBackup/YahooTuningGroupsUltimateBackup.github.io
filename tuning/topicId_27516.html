Anything delayed by more than 64 msec (my usual setting for the<br/>max length of a Pseudo-Simultaneous Event (PSE)) causes a new time slice<br/>to be defined, which, without horizontal restraint, shifts the<br/>intonation of sounding notes at will (as required by changing vertical<br/>pressures, balanced by grounding springs).</p><p>&gt;I have a question about that, though...  I didn&apos;t realize that you<br/>&gt;could change the pitch of a note *after* the attack had already<br/>&gt;sounded...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Can you do that??  I thought once the note was sounded it didn&apos;t<br/>&gt;accept any more &quot;bending&quot; information??</p><p>Actually, the pitch bend message is intended to be used for real-time<br/>glissandos, usually after a note is started.  So it&apos;s well-suited for<br/>adaptive tuning from that standpoint.</p><p>&gt;In any case, the changes in intonation we call &quot;wobblies&quot; are not far<br/>&gt;afield from what regular *human* players do with intonation...<br/>&gt;sometimes...yes??, so, in a sense, aren&apos;t the &quot;wobblies&quot; a kind of<br/>&gt;intonational &quot;humanization??&quot;</p><p>Maybe.  Some adjustment takes place even when full-strength horizontal<br/>springs are present; it&apos;s just much smaller.  I think the 2nd mvmt of<br/>the Mozart in vv sounds pretty strange.  The Bach sounds pretty good<br/>much of the time, but occasionally not.  For me, it does depend upon my<br/>mood as well: sometimes I like it, sometimes not.</p><p>&gt;Just curious...</p><p>Me too!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
