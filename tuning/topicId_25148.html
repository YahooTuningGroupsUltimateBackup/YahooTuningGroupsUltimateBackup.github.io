How do the different<br/>&gt; interval sizes give each part its own unique character, when all<br/>the parts have the same set of different interval sizes? Even if this<br/>did make sense, the 41-tET, 34-tET and 22-tET versions have just as<br/>much variety of interval sizes as the JI version, but with a greater<br/>&gt; difference between the different &quot;inflections&quot; of particular<br/>&gt; intervals, so JI wouldn&apos;t stand out in this regard.<br/>&gt; &gt;</p><p>I was actually puzzling over this myself...  It didn&apos;t seem to make<br/>sense, but then I thought that, well, maybe if the different sets of<br/>intervals in different lines started on different sized scalar<br/>elements in more a LINEAR exposition, maybe it would affect the part<br/>separation to a degree.</p><p>However, certainly the unequal steps wouldn&apos;t affect the separation<br/>as much as the SET PATTERNING of the melodic line, which would be a<br/>similar process both in a scale of equal AND non-equal steps...

After writing that sentence,<br/>&gt; I just *had* to compare 72-EDO with 5-limit JI back-to-back,<br/>&gt; in light of Ezra Sims&apos;s comments about not being able to<br/>&gt; tell the difference in computer renditions of his own music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 72-EDO to my ears was the closest of any of the other tunings<br/>&gt; to the 5-limit JI version, but I *still* heard a difference,<br/>&gt; or at least I think I did.  It would be interesting to do<br/>&gt; these kinds of tests without knowing beforehand what the<br/>&gt; tunings are.  But It seems to me that the ear recognizes some<br/>&gt; extremely subtle differences in intonation.</p><p>I can&apos;t really hear the difference between 53, 65, and 5-limit<br/>tunings.  There may be something slightly different about 65,<br/>but I&apos;d probably need training to tell it apart on a blind<br/>test.  72 definitely sounds rougher than these three.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
