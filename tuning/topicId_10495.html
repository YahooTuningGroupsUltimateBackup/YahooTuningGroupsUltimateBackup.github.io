You know,<br/>&gt;traditional major and minor chords in these scales sound like jazz!</p><p>Jazz? They sound pretty close to JI major and minor chords, at least<br/>compared to 12-tET. Unless you mean traditional _keyboard_ major and minor<br/>chords, in which case we&apos;re in irrelevant territory again.</p><p>&gt;First, why are almost all of them &quot;decatonic&quot; 10 notes.  Why does that<br/>&gt;work well for 22?  Why don&apos;t we use the full 22??</p><p>They&apos;re meant to be analogous to the 7-note diatonic scales in 12-tET (or<br/>19-tET, 31-tET, etc.) Read my paper. You can use the full 22 if you want (I<br/>work that way).</p><p>&gt;And, what does the terminology &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; refer to in these<br/>&gt;scales... maybe I just have to work with them longer to hear it...</p><p>They refer to the quality of the tonic tetrad, obtained by playing the 1st,<br/>4th, 7th, and 9th notes of the scale at the same time.</p><p>&gt;Of course, in Paul&apos;s article, one idea of these scales is to make<br/>&gt;7-limit consonances work nicely.  Of course this is totally unrelated to<br/>&gt;the Indian music which used similar intervals, or at least 22 notes in<br/>&gt;an octave, yes?</p><p>Right.</p></div>
