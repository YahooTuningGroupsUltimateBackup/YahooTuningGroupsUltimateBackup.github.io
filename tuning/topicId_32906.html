It&apos;s really upbeat... I like the new &quot;skin...&quot;</p><p>Glad you like it, thanks.</p><p>I wonder if you know that it is customisable too. Easiest change<br/>- if you have a program with gradient fill such as PaintshopPro,<br/>prob. most of the paint packages, you can get the same<br/>effects, but with other colours, by editing the files<br/>in the folder Images-Original and saving them on top<br/>of the ones in the folder Images. I used<br/>the various types of gradient fill such as radial gradient<br/>and sunburst gradient in Paintshop Pro.</p><p>The readme in the Images folder says a bit about this.</p><p>N.B. I found that when one exits from it,<br/>sometimes it will crash with a &quot;this program has done<br/>something illegal and will be terminated&quot; type bug.</p><p>I.e. you click Exit, and at that point Windows<br/>tells you that it will terminate the program.<br/>It is exiting anyway, so not such a big thing,<br/>not like the one you found in autumn 2000.</p><p>It was an easy fix too once I discovered it.<br/>It was because of the new buttons, because<br/>it was trying to update them when the window<br/>they were in had vanished already, or was about<br/>to go away, or something like that.</p><p>Download page:<br/><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/ftsbeta.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/ftsbeta.htm</a><br/>url for the setup prog.<br/><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/FTS_Beta_Preview_Setup.exe">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/FTS_Beta_Preview_Setup.exe</a></p><p>N.B. help is very much mid edit.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=32914 href="#32914">ðŸ”—</a>ppagano@bellsouth.net</h3><span>1/18/2002 6:34:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Robert<br/>Would you consider a Institutional copy for SEJIS?<br/>It is a tax deduction and may be very useful for students.<br/>I used it a bit on Windows last year and found it helpful</p><p>Cheers<br/>Pat Pagano<br/>Director,<br/>South East Just Intonation Society</p></div>
