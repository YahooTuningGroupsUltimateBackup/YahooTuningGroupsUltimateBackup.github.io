If I make a suggestion, I<br/>recommend we distinguish between &quot;sensory consonance&quot; (aka roughness,<br/>sonance etc.) and &quot;contextual consonance&quot; as Tenney does in his History<br/>of Consonance and Dissonance, somewhere in the glossary or FAQ.</p><p>Also, I think we should call the various lattice diagrams &quot;tonal<br/>lattices&quot; to distinguish them from the partially ordered sets subject to<br/>certain requirements of greatest lower and least upper bounds on pairs<br/>of elements that other mathematicians call lattices.</p><p>&gt;Another problem in the latter: the 225/224 is not a septimal schisma (which<br/>&gt;is 33554432/33480783) but I think it&apos;s a kleisma.</p><p>I suggest this definition:</p><p>The Kleisma is a small interval composed of 6 major thirds up and 5<br/>fifths down. Its ratio is 15635/15552 or approximately 8.10728 cents.<br/>The term was introduced by Shohe&apos; Tanaka.</p><p>determinant: I suggest the folowing minor changes.</p><p>A calculation made on a square matrix. When the rows of the matrix<br/>represent independent unison vectors, the absolute value of the<br/>determinant indicates the number of pitches contained within the<br/>corresponding periodicity block. This was documented by Fokker.</p><p>--John</p></div>
