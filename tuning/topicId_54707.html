Does this question make<br/>sense?</p><p>From what I can gather, your problem of dissonance with double stops<br/>on the harmonica is rooted in the fact that the tempering errors<br/>inherent in 12-tone equal temperament (12-ET) are emphasized more<br/>with fixed-pitch instruments having timbres that are rich in<br/>harmonics, such as the harpsichord, harmonica, and accordion (my main<br/>instrument; it was only the other day that I was once again<br/>distressed by the dissonance of 12-ET on the accordion after weeks of<br/>listening extensively to more consonant tunings in the electronic<br/>medium).  The piano and acoustic organ (flue pipes) are not as rich<br/>in harmonics, which makes 12-ET more tolerable on those instruments.</p><p>I should qualify my statement about lumping the harmonica in with<br/>fixed-pitch instruments.  If you&apos;re playing only one note at a time,<br/>then you have some control over your intonation, but with double<br/>stops I imagine that it would be very tricky to adjust the pitch of<br/>each tone simultaneously by different amounts to detemper your<br/>intervals.</p><p>I believe you need an instrument in an alternate tuning, possibly the<br/>meantone temperament (or 19-ET might be interesting).  Where can you<br/>get one?  Beats me!  You may have to learn how to tune reeds and do<br/>the retuning yourself, but I think that it may well be worth the<br/>effort.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>David A.

For some<br/>reason, I assumed that inorder to play alternative tunings one had to<br/>have a special instrument only.  After, investigating and listening to<br/>some recordings. I can see now that it&apos;s not as completed as I<br/>expected. I for one wouldn&apos;t modify a chromatic harp, although some do<br/>with a diminished tuning. I was awed with some of the diagrams I<br/>found, which, When I was a kid I use to make such drawings but didn&apos;t<br/>know the reason behind it. When I seen these geometric drawing they<br/>put a chill up my spine. I have always had a craft for unusual<br/>intervals with traditional instruments. I still have my synthezier and<br/>a few effects units that allow me to play detune intervals and melodic<br/>motifs just messing around. I am lol because, when I was learning to<br/>bend on the harmonica at first, not knowing that there were different<br/>key centers for each harmonica in the major and minor keys, I sounded<br/>pretty much like some of the recordings I  was listening too this<br/>morning. Once again, thanks for your post and insights. I am still<br/>working on the math.Reading a little each day on the links.

Viewed in terms of major/minor modes, JIs involve a variety of different sizes of whole- and half-steps and, arrayed melodically, the choices between them are not always intuitively obvious.  Those choices are more apparent played harmonically against a drone, for example.  Equal temperaments, again speaking in broad generalities, tend to be exactly the reverse:  Their melodic step sizes are very consistent and thus easily predictable melodically, but are less placid when placed in block chords.</p><p>Those two goals in tuning - cleanliness in block harmony vs. cleanliness in melody - are impossible to reconcile completely, and for that I&apos;m eternally grateful!  If there existed a single ideal solution, there would no longer be choices of myriads of tunings to choose from, each with its own unique, insightful way to balance those trade-offs, and similarly for other trade-offs.  It&apos;s every bit as interesting for a tuning to have what are, from one viewpoint or another, &quot;bad&quot; attributes as it is for them to have &quot;good&quot; attributes.  It&apos;s even more interesting when those &quot;bad&quot; attributes from one viewpoint are &quot;good&quot; from some other viewpoint, because you can then use that one attribute to convey greater variety of impressions to your audience, each in a different context.</p><p>On a different, but somewhat related, topic, you might perhaps find Bill Sethares&apos; research into the interactions between tuning and tone qualities interesting.  In short, the question is why certain harmonies sound better on certain timbres than on others.  He described his results in his book entitled, &quot;Tuning Timbre Spectrum Scale.&quot;  On the downside, the math is even more involved than the basics, but on the upside, the accompanying CD does a good job of illustrating these effects in the form of actual sounds and music.</p></div><h3>George D.

There are<br/>quite a few models available in 12TET (Lee Oskar, Hohner&apos;s Golden<br/>Melody and most of those made in Japan), but most other diatonic<br/>harmonicas use some sort of compromise temperament somewhere between<br/>JI and 12TET.</p><p>Sadly, the tuning of most mass-produced harmonicas is so variable it<br/>is often hard to tell what the tuning is meant to be.</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s been very many years since I&apos;ve tried playing a harmonica, and<br/>&gt;the ones I played were definitely in 12-ET, so I don&apos;t think you can<br/>&gt;make a blanket statement that harmonicas are *not* in 12-equal.  But<br/>&gt;since they&apos;re often pitched in specific keys, I would think that<br/>&gt;someone might have tried a non-12-ET tuning somewhere along the line,<br/>&gt;so I&apos;m not surprised at what you have to say.  (But I *would* expect<br/>&gt;chromatic harmonicas to be in 12-ET.)</p><p>Almost all chromatic harmonicas are in 12TET, or at least they are<br/>supposed to be.</p><p>&gt;After re-reading part of David&apos;s original question (which I repeat<br/>&gt;here):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I have a question. I play the harmonica and find certain harmonicas<br/>&gt;&gt; dissonant to play double stops when harmonising with traditional<br/>&gt;&gt; players.(some harmonicas are tuned different) ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So we would need more information to determine whether the particular<br/>&gt;harmonicas that produce dissonant double stops:<br/>&gt;1) Are in 12-equal (with the dissonance of the tuning made more<br/>&gt;apparent by rich harmonic content), or<br/>&gt;2) Are really intervals in non-equal tuning that suffered in order to<br/>&gt;improve other intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Whatever the case, I would think that a meantone or 19-ET tuning<br/>&gt;could have possibilities.  Imagine a 19-ET two-decker &quot;chromatic&quot;<br/>&gt;instrument with naturals and sharps (on one level) and possibly flats<br/>&gt;and naturals (on the other level, 1 degree lower than the first<br/>&gt;level) that would allow enharmonic scales.  The instrument could be<br/>&gt;called an &quot;enharmonica&quot;.  :-)</p><p>I hate to put a damper on the enthusiasm, but such an instrument would<br/>introduce many other problems, particularly efficiency of air usage,<br/>to say nothing of the retail price. There have been patents for<br/>instruments along these lines, but none of them have ever made it as<br/>far as a commercial model. The harmonica market is a very conservative<br/>one, for the most part, although there are a few customisers (such as<br/>myself) that cater to a more discerning bunch of customers. If anyone<br/>is interested in a Bohlen-Pierce harmonica, I&apos;d be more than happy to<br/>take on the job... but I digress.</p><p>As regards temperament for the convention chromatic harmonica, there<br/>are a few things to keep in mind. One is that single notes (and<br/>double-stops to a limited extent) can be played into tune by slight<br/>degree of note bending, although obviously this requires that the note<br/>to be played is lower than the tuning of the instrument itself, as<br/>notes can only be bend downwards in pitch. The other thing is that<br/>only certain note combinations can be played at any given time. For<br/>example, on a typical C harmonica C E and G are blow notes and D F and<br/>A are draw notes. This means that you don&apos;t have to worry too much<br/>about getting the A to make both a 3/2 with D and a 5/3 with C, just<br/>provided the note combinations that you ~can~ play sound reasonably<br/>good with each other and not too out of tune with any accompanying<br/>instruments.</p><p> -- Pat Missin.</p></div><h3>George D.
