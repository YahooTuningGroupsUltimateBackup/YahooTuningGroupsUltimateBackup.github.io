I&apos;m just not into<br/>the whole seedless-grapes and nippleless-Barbie thing, different<br/>strokes of course.</p><p>The physical experience of the &quot;comma pump&quot; is<br/>a very cool thing- I remember a formative experience. Before I knew<br/>what the &quot;comma pump&quot; was theoretically, I had a disconcerting<br/>experience of finding that our choral group always wound up<br/>a semitone (!) flat of the starting pitch when running through<br/>a certain round (&quot;the hoot-owl is sitting&quot;). Being the first bass<br/>and ultimately anchoring the whole intonation, at first I thought<br/>I was screwing up the whole thing when the harmonies hit seconds,<br/>but I found that the more carefully I sang and the more more in tune<br/>we were, the more concrete the effect was of the whole tune<br/>dropping. I was able to &quot;correct&quot;, almost exactly, by slowing<br/>sharping every time through the round, at which point it lost, to<br/>my ears, &quot;the real sound&quot;. So I just let it drop like it was born to<br/>do, and started looking deeper into what was going on.</p><p>The thing is- if you don&apos;t want comma pumps, you don&apos;t really want<br/>JI.</p><p>&gt;But<br/>&gt; as soon as one gives up the idea that there must be only one pitch<br/>&gt;and<br/>&gt; not a range of pitches for every note the problem vanishes. That&apos;s<br/>&gt;why<br/>&gt; I advocate the use of adaptive intonation whenever it is<br/>&gt;possible.</p><p>That&apos;s above-board, in my book.</p><p>&gt; &gt; A 1/4 comma meantone fifth doesn&apos;t sound like a 3/2, it sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; like a 1/4 comma meantone fifth.

When it appears as a harmonic<br/>interval and not literally as sol, it&apos;s a certain harmonic<br/>color- not a 3/2.</p><p>&gt;Trivially they are different intervals but I don&apos;t think the<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma meantone fifth sound special in any way. It doesn&apos;t stand<br/>&gt; out from the other fifths in its neighborhood like 3/2 does.</p><p>I find all the meantone fifths in that area to sound &quot;soft&quot;, while<br/>3/2 doesn&apos;t. And while I like high fifths, I think that most will<br/>agree with me that high fifths get radical and hard more quickly<br/>than low fifths. Maybe in isolation the difference between a<br/>meantone fifth and a 3/2 is trivial (I don&apos;t think so but whatever),<br/>but the total effect is completely different. The literal appearance<br/>of 3/2 isn&apos;t incessant except in block-chord tunes anyway.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro.</p></div><h3><a id=72890 href="#72890">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2007 2:47:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Cameron Bobro&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote<br/>&gt; I feel that the whole basic idea of basing tunings on<br/>&gt; approximating Just intervals is of dubious artistic<br/>&gt; integrity.<br/>&gt; To each their own of course.</p><p>Look at it this way.

Sometimes you want<br/>&gt; something a little sharper, such as 1/6 comma.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yet you have refused to acknowledge my (frequent) statements that<br/>sheer proximity to a JI interval is not the whole story. Given<br/>softness as a criterium (a nice criterium IMO), would you say that a<br/>fifth 4 cents sharp of pure is better than a fifth<br/>6 cents flat? In terms of sheer proximity to the pure interval, the<br/>higher fifth is inarguably &quot;better&quot;, yet even I who like high fifths<br/>(&quot;brassy&quot; to my ears) would choose the lower fifth without<br/>hesitation if softness were the issue. If this is so, then my<br/>statement that sheer proximity to a JI interval is not the whole<br/>story is a simple and obvious fact.</p><p>If you acknowledge this, then you must acknowledge that minimizing<br/>travel on a lattice simply can&apos;t be gauged on quantity alone, if<br/>musical character is an issue.

In other words, if we have a tone with a<br/>fundamental of 100 Hz, and the timbre is harmonic, we&apos;re not going<br/>to find a partial at 125 Hz, which is where the fundamental of<br/>another tone in a &quot;5:4&quot; relationship with our original 100 Hz tonic<br/>would sit.</p><p>&quot;5:4&quot; is found in its natural state at 500 and 400 Hz in the<br/>harmonic series of our 100 Hz tone. It is not found at 125 Hz.</p><p>Our pure &quot;5:4&quot; major third is an interpretation and application of<br/>something found in the harmonic series. This is unlike, for example,<br/>the octave above the tonic, 2:1, which is found in literal form<br/>in the harmonic series.</p><p>Obviously using a 5:4 major third isn&apos;t exactly going far afield or<br/>out on the limb as far as interpreting and applying the<br/>harmonic series; it&apos;s a simple matter of dropping something in plain<br/>earshot into the first octave, and the original is sitting on top<br/>of an octave of the tonic anyway.</p><p>&quot;Everyone knows that&quot; someone will say, to which I say, oh yeah?</p><p>If you truly KNOW this, then it is obvious that an interval that<br/>is simply near to the 5:4 third IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY A TEMPERED 5:4.</p><p>Now let&apos;s say we say that we want 5:4 as our third. Great,<br/>wonderful. And we&apos;re going to have to temper it to avoid<br/>&quot;comma pumps&quot; and all that jazz. Fine, groovy, whatever.<br/>Now, unlike the octave, 5:4 as a major third in relation to the<br/>fundamental simply isn&apos;t physically, directly found in the harmonic<br/>series.<br/>This means that a: we can temper it a lot, and b: we can&apos;t temper it<br/>too much at all.</p><p>We can temper it a lot because it&apos;s not likely to be directly<br/>and loudly contrasting with our tempered version, which 2:1 for<br/>example tends to do. But we CAN&apos;T temper 5:4 too much for the same<br/>reason:<br/>as an interpretation, although a strong and good one, of the<br/>harmonic series, it doesn&apos;t directly, physically assert itself like<br/>the 2:1 does and therefore, once we tweak our M3 a bit away from the<br/>exact 5:4, IT IS NO LONGER 5:4.</p><p>AND, because 5:4 is NOT engraved in stone, there can be many<br/>different M3s that were never intended to have anything to do<br/>with 5:4 in the first place.</p><p>AND, even if a &quot;JI&quot; interval is strong enough to assert itself<br/>in its manifestations, not just its original form, for example<br/>3:2 (which is an interpretaion of the partial 3:1) can appear as<br/>2:3, 2:6, 6:2, etc., to the point where it can still be felt<br/>through a good amount of tempering, it DOES matter, audibly<br/>(whether anyone here wants to admit it or not), whether it&apos;s<br/>tempered up or down!<br/> DIFFERENT SOUND. DIFFERENT CHARACTER.</p><p>&quot;approximating Just intervals&quot; is simply not a firm foundation<br/>without many qualifying factors.</p><p>&quot;JI&quot; is not the center, source, or constant point of reference, of<br/>tuning! The harmonic series is.<br/>If &quot;JI&quot; is STATED to be the desired point of reference, that&apos;s fine<br/>and dandy. If it&apos;s<br/>assumed as some kind of universal truth, that&apos;s bullshit. And<br/>if &quot;JI&quot; is stated to<br/>be the desired &quot;sound&quot;, which is also just dandy, then a quality<br/>approach to<br/>achieving that goal is NOT just a matter getting near to<br/>specific &quot;JI&quot; intervals:<br/>it matters whether you&apos;re high or low, and once you have a set<br/>of &quot;tempered&quot;<br/>intervals, that set has its own demands as far as sounding cohesive.</p><p>Now to any replies of yes we know all this, I say: then show me the<br/>vast tomes in<br/>the archives addressing the intervals that are most decidely<br/>NOT &quot;JI&quot;.

However, &gt; it&apos;s good that you did write &gt; &quot;JI vs. temperament&quot;, for the expression itself reveals a &gt; fundamental misunderstanding I&apos;m bitching about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once again, very slowly:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;JI&quot; is NOT the harmonic series. It is an INTERPRETATION and &gt; APPLICATION of the harmonic series. &gt;<br/>&gt; Intervals that are not &quot;JI&quot; are not necessarily &quot;tempered&quot; at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Take the Just Intonation interval 5:4. &gt;<br/>&gt; As a MAJOR THIRD in relation to the fundamental, it doesn&apos;t exist in<br/>&gt; the harmonic series. In other words, if we have a tone with a &gt; fundamental of 100 Hz, and the timbre is harmonic, we&apos;re not going<br/>&gt; to find a partial at 125 Hz, which is where the fundamental of &gt; another tone in a &quot;5:4&quot; relationship with our original 100 Hz tonic &gt; would sit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;5:4&quot; is found in its natural state at 500 and 400 Hz in the &gt; harmonic series of our 100 Hz tone. It is not found at 125 Hz. &gt;<br/>&gt; Our pure &quot;5:4&quot; major third is an interpretation and application of<br/>&gt; something found in the harmonic series. This is unlike, for example, &gt; the octave above the tonic, 2:1, which is found in literal form &gt; in the harmonic series. &gt;<br/>&gt; Obviously using a 5:4 major third isn&apos;t exactly going far afield or &gt; out on the limb as far as interpreting and applying the &gt; harmonic series; it&apos;s a simple matter of dropping something in plain &gt; earshot into the first octave, and the original is sitting on top &gt; of an octave of the tonic anyway. &gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Everyone knows that&quot; someone will say, to which I say, oh yeah?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you truly KNOW this, then it is obvious that an interval that<br/>&gt; is simply near to the 5:4 third IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY A TEMPERED 5:4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now let&apos;s say we say that we want 5:4 as our third. Great, &gt; wonderful. And we&apos;re going to have to temper it to avoid<br/>&gt; &quot;comma pumps&quot; and all that jazz. Fine, groovy, whatever. &gt; Now, unlike the octave, 5:4 as a major third in relation to the &gt; fundamental simply isn&apos;t physically, directly found in the harmonic &gt; series.  &gt; This means that a: we can temper it a lot, and b: we can&apos;t temper it &gt; too much at all. &gt;<br/>&gt; We can temper it a lot because it&apos;s not likely to be directly<br/>&gt; and loudly contrasting with our tempered version, which 2:1 for &gt; example tends to do. But we CAN&apos;T temper 5:4 too much for the same &gt; reason: &gt; as an interpretation, although a strong and good one, of the &gt; harmonic series, it doesn&apos;t directly, physically assert itself like &gt; the 2:1 does and therefore, once we tweak our M3 a bit away from the &gt; exact 5:4, IT IS NO LONGER 5:4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; AND, because 5:4 is NOT engraved in stone, there can be many &gt; different M3s that were never intended to have anything to do<br/>&gt; with 5:4 in the first place.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; AND, even if a &quot;JI&quot; interval is strong enough to assert itself<br/>&gt; in its manifestations, not just its original form, for example<br/>&gt; 3:2 (which is an interpretaion of the partial 3:1) can appear as &gt; 2:3, 2:6, 6:2, etc., to the point where it can still be felt<br/>&gt; through a good amount of tempering, it DOES matter, audibly &gt; (whether anyone here wants to admit it or not), whether it&apos;s &gt; tempered up or down!<br/>&gt;  DIFFERENT SOUND. DIFFERENT CHARACTER.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;approximating Just intervals&quot; is simply not a firm foundation<br/>&gt; without many qualifying factors. &gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;JI&quot; is not the center, source, or constant point of reference, of &gt; tuning! The harmonic series is. &gt; If &quot;JI&quot; is STATED to be the desired point of reference, that&apos;s fine &gt; and dandy. If it&apos;s<br/>&gt; assumed as some kind of universal truth, that&apos;s bullshit. And &gt; if &quot;JI&quot; is stated to<br/>&gt; be the desired &quot;sound&quot;, which is also just dandy, then a quality &gt; approach to<br/>&gt; achieving that goal is NOT just a matter getting near to &gt; specific &quot;JI&quot; intervals:<br/>&gt; it matters whether you&apos;re high or low, and once you have a set &gt; of &quot;tempered&quot; &gt; intervals, that set has its own demands as far as sounding cohesive. &gt;<br/>&gt; Now to any replies of yes we know all this, I say: then show me the &gt; vast tomes in<br/>&gt; the archives addressing the intervals that are most decidely &gt; NOT &quot;JI&quot;. Show me the<br/>&gt; evidence that intervals are accepted for what they are, and not &gt; inevitably cartooned into<br/>&gt; &quot;tempered JI intervals&quot;. Traditional  triadic harmony doesn&apos;t fly &gt; with the so-called &gt; &quot;neutral&quot; intervals, yet they sound great in harmonies, so, where &gt; are the long &gt; discussions on alternative harmonic theories which are obviously &gt; necessary for &gt; polyphonic music heavy in &quot;neutral&quot; intervals? &gt;<br/>&gt; Take care.  &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Cameron Bobro<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt;  &gt; Yahoo!

(An interval just below<br/>5/4 doesn&apos;t have as much potential to be percieved of as a<br/>detuned 5/4 because as you go down, the first couple of partials<br/>start getting into harsh zones and the 5/4 character gets lost<br/>more quickly but this is definitely more subjective).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for temperament, it&apos;s simply the desire to distribute the<br/>&gt;fruits of<br/>&gt; JI among all the &apos;tonics&apos; equally---communism/socialism of a sort.<br/>&gt;JI is<br/>&gt; arch-monarchy, equal-temperament is idealistic communism or<br/>socialism,<br/>&gt; and unequal temperament might be considered a brand of democratic<br/>&gt; capitalism (haves, have-nots, and have-nothings) or even a type of<br/>&gt; capitalistic constitutional monarchy in some cases (C major is<br/>&gt;golden,<br/>&gt; F# major lives in dire poverty in the ghetto).

Linear temperaments are not pretending to<br/>&gt;_be_ JI<br/>&gt; (except perhaps those few we call microtemperaments or&gt;<br/>&gt;nanotemperaments).</p><p>One of these temperaments, Gene&apos;s ennealimmal, does seem to be<br/>claiming to sound like &quot;JI&quot;, and if we consider &quot;7-limit JI&quot; in the<br/>way it should be considered, ie &quot;simple ratios&quot; including the<br/>ones where literal consonance at the seventh partial is<br/>happening, I think it is successful harmonically. It&apos;s an<br/>interesting effect- close to stillness harmonically but much<br/>more even-sounding as far as step sizes. From what I have<br/>heard done in this temperament, it succeeds very well in doing<br/>what the &quot;middle path&quot; paper is addressing.</p><p>My gripe- and to me this is a very important thing- is about<br/>the fundamental position of &quot;JI&quot; as a kind of center of the<br/>tuning universe. In a way or to a degree, it must be (even in a<br/>negative sense, ie deliberately avoiding it), for it<br/>is such a direct application of the harmonic series. But I<br/>violently disagree that &quot;JI&quot; &quot;IS&quot; the harmonic series, for it<br/>is simply not.</p><p>A &quot;middle path&quot; between JI and ET is just fine- the<br/>implication that &quot;JI and ET&quot; are the mountains between which<br/>paths lie is just plain wrong.</p><p>&gt;They are of musical interest in and of &gt;themselves.</p><p>That&apos;s great- but when this is true, then it is inevitable<br/>that either by tempering JI intervals or using other means<br/>to create tunings, you will create tunings which simply<br/>cannot be understood in terms of JI approximates. Unless of<br/>course you extend what you mean by &quot;JI&quot;.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, many people find they prefer the sound of linear<br/>&gt;temperaments<br/>&gt; that are in some sense _closer_ to JI. But this has to be weighed<br/>&gt; against the preference to also minimise the number of different<br/>&gt; pitches required on fixed-pitch instruments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Comma pumps are just fine for a cappella and variable pitch<br/>&gt; instruments, but cause problems for those of us whose thing might<br/>be<br/>&gt; guitar or keyboards or indeed any ensemble containing at least one<br/>&gt; fixed-pitch instrument. Surely we can still be allowed &quot;artistic<br/>&gt; integrity&quot; despite wanting to modulate widely _and_ use fixed pitch<br/>&gt; instruments. (Incidentally, the only thing I could be remotely<br/>said to<br/>&gt; have ever _composed_ is in strict JI. And I am now building<br/>&gt;microtonal<br/>&gt; guitars for which strict JI is difficult).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One point of Paul&apos;s paper is that this does not limit us to a<br/>&gt;choice<br/>&gt; between JI and ETs as the debate often seems to be cast. There is a<br/>&gt; whole world of middle paths to explore. However to save a lot of<br/>time,<br/>&gt; he has catalogued for us the few dozen most promising areas for<br/>&gt; exploration, based on them being good tradeoffs between closeness<br/>&gt;to<br/>&gt; JI and number of pitches required.</p></div><h3><a id=72970 href="#72970">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2007 6:28:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Cameron Bobro&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;In this<br/>&gt; &gt; sense---I have to disagree---JI *is* in the harmonic series.</p><p>Yes, &quot;In&quot; the harmonic series, but not &quot;Is&quot; the harmonic series.<br/>There&apos;s a fundamental difference.</p></div><h3><a id=72971 href="#72971">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.

Okay.<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; Everything you say is true about the harmonic series, etc.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; However, 5/4 derives it&apos;s special consonance from the coincident &gt;&gt; harmonics of the overtones of 2 harmonic series in conjunction. &gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; Consonance, yes, that&apos;s what I mean when I say &quot;literal&quot; consonance-<br/>&gt; there are lower partials literally as one. But consonance is a &gt; thing, not the only thing. &gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; In this &gt;&gt; sense---I have to disagree---JI *is* in the harmonic series. &gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; Do you find 9/8 beatless? In terms of literal consonance &gt; and &quot;stillness&quot;, I find 7/5 for example more concordant than 9/8. &gt; Just an observation. Anyway, are we going to equate beatless &gt; intervals with the harmonic series? That won&apos;t work because any &gt; integer ratio can be derived from the harmonic series and we can<br/>&gt; have all kinds of wildly beating ratios. Beatless intervals are<br/>&gt; a certain class of integer ratios- an interpretation and &gt; application of the harmonic series, not the harmonic series<br/>&gt; and all its potentials itself. Just like I said before. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; It&apos;s &gt;not &gt;&gt; simply an &apos;interpretation&apos; as you insist, when the brain is simply &gt;&gt; perceiving co-incident tones among pairs (or groups) of series. &gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; As soon as you establish any kind of limit- prime, n*d complexity,<br/>&gt; whatever, you are dealing with an interpretation. And I did not<br/>&gt; say that an interpretation is simply the brain perceiving coincident<br/>&gt; tones, for the things that make JI what it is are &quot;real&quot; (ie its<br/>&gt; not just some conditioned thing). The same inborn perceptions<br/>&gt; also make other interpretations of the harmonic series as &quot;real&quot; as &gt; JI. &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; So, what &gt;&gt; we really have is you talking at cross-purposes by insisting that &gt;&gt; we &gt;&gt; should not say &quot;6&quot; but &quot;a half dozen&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; I am saying that &quot;some of the eggs&quot; shouldn&apos;t be referred to<br/>&gt; as &quot;all the eggs&quot;. Anyway sometimes it is very important &gt; to distinguish between &quot;six&quot; and &quot;half a dozen&quot;, for example<br/>&gt; when what you&apos;re talking about some kind of process like &gt; counting by dozens. &gt;   &gt;&gt; Another thing to consider---you brought up how it would &gt;&gt; be &apos;ridiculous&apos; &gt;&gt; to think of 400 cents as a sharp 5/4 instead of thinking of it as &gt;&gt;     &gt; 81/64. &gt;   &gt;&gt; On one level, yes, what you say is true, in that 12-equal is both &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; Pythagorean and an extreme meantone simultaneously, however, the &gt;&gt;     &gt; ear &gt;   &gt;&gt; hears 400 cents, nonetheless, as a sharp 5/4, not a flat 81/64.<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; My ear does not, what can I say? I just tuned up a dozen 3/2s and &gt; sure enough, the triads with 81/64 (in isolation) sound just like<br/>&gt; 12-tET &quot;only better&quot;, the triads with the dim4 version of the M3 &gt; also sound pretty good but nothing at all like 12-tET. Actually<br/>&gt; this straight and dry Pythagorean tuning sounds pretty good IMO.<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; The proof is simple---no dyad as complex 81/64 will be perceived &gt;&gt; as &gt;&gt; beatless. &gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; But beatlessness is a thing, not the thing. Beatlessness equals &gt; beatlessness, not the harmonic series. Beating doesn&apos;t bother<br/>&gt; me in the slightest. Come to think of it, my wife tends to be<br/>&gt; highly irked by beatless intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; 5/4 can be perceived as beatless, 81/64 cannot, because the &gt;&gt; brain interprets it as a member of the 5/4 family. &gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; This is a theory, and it simply does not agree with my experience.<br/>&gt; 81/64 cannot be percieved as beatless for the simple reason that<br/>&gt; it beats, and it beats because it beats, not because it is not<br/>&gt; a 5/4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Dang that girl is ugly- she doesn&apos;t look like Sharon Stone at &gt; all!&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; This is perfectly in &gt;&gt; line with what Harmonic Entropy predicts.<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; Does harmonic Entropy predict that I (and everyone I know out<br/>&gt; in the physical world, afaik) that 60/49 is a soft and<br/>&gt; consonant interval?<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; All this of course, says nothing about the aesthetic issues and &gt;&gt; choices &gt;&gt; about whether or not to use 81/64 in music. I&apos;m just simply &gt;&gt; stating &gt;&gt; basic facts about human auditory perception---81/64 is not a &gt;&gt; beatless dyad.<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; Yes 81/64 beats, and it beats in the same place that 5/4 doesn&apos;t, &gt; but that does not make it a detuned 5/4. In fact, that&apos;s what<br/>&gt; makes it NOT a detuned 5/4, for the identity of 5/4 includes<br/>&gt; the softness of conincident partials- an interval a couple of<br/>&gt; cents above 5/4 still has softness, a slow beat or creaming &gt; effect, in the same place 5/4 does, so it can be legitimately<br/>&gt; viewed as a tempered or detuned 5/4. (An interval just below<br/>&gt; 5/4 doesn&apos;t have as much potential to be percieved of as a<br/>&gt; detuned 5/4 because as you go down, the first couple of partials  &gt; start getting into harsh zones and the 5/4 character gets lost &gt; more quickly but this is definitely more subjective). &gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; As for temperament, it&apos;s simply the desire to distribute the &gt;&gt; fruits of &gt;&gt; JI among all the &apos;tonics&apos; equally---communism/socialism of a sort. &gt;&gt; JI is &gt;&gt; arch-monarchy, equal-temperament is idealistic communism or &gt;&gt;     &gt; socialism, &gt;   &gt;&gt; and unequal temperament might be considered a brand of democratic &gt;&gt; capitalism (haves, have-nots, and have-nothings) or even a type of &gt;&gt; capitalistic constitutional monarchy in some cases (C major is &gt;&gt; golden, &gt;&gt; F# major lives in dire poverty in the ghetto). Non-JI, non-octave &gt;&gt; temperament is perhaps anarchy (looters are everywhere, no one has &gt;&gt; anything, people are eating people for lunch)?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Ok, now let&apos;s get serious...<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; Actually I take those kinds of comparisons most seriously. :-) &gt;   &gt;&gt; Let&apos;s make this conversation a bit more polite and civil, shall we?<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; Okay, no sweat, take care. &gt; -Cameron Bobro<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt;  &gt; Yahoo!

I see no reason not to assume that such &quot;tolerances&quot; or varied interpretations have not been apart of the fabric for quite some time or at least present to varied degrees. Artist have never been conformist to what others tell them. they are the ones that tell others, and when they hit on something the lesser then use it to build a wall against the next developments.

In order to be perceived, such variations have to have a<br/>certain size (which comes from harmonic content) and lie within a<br/>certain range of frequency (which depends on both interval and<br/>absolute pitch).</p><p>It is true for *some* 81:64&apos;s that they beat by virtue of being<br/>mistuned 5:4&apos;s - but not others. For example, say, just below tenor C<br/>on a piano you will get fairly slow beat rates and the character of<br/>the interval is not so far from 5:4. But if you go up to the treble<br/>octave (ie between one and two octaves above middle C), first the<br/>variation in power is much more rapid and probably beyond the range<br/>where the listener can hear it as a beat; second, the 5th partial is<br/>getting weaker; third, the sensitivity of the ear to changes in<br/>interval is greater in this octave. In this case the ear will probably<br/>not hear definite beats (but will certainly hear something different<br/>from a 5:4).</p><p>There are possibly situations where 81:64 beats because it is a<br/>mistuned 19:15 - that is, perceptible variations in power arise from<br/>the 19th partial of the lowest fundamental. As I described some time<br/>ago, once when searching for a pure third just below middle C on an<br/>Italian harpsichord I hit a 19:15 instead - and was able to tune it,<br/>out of curiosity.</p><p>There is a small class of &apos;beatless&apos; intervals which (given harmonic<br/>timbres) never produce perceptible beats when sounded in an audible<br/>range. 7/6 may be more or less the boundary of this class, I&apos;m not<br/>sure, one would have to experiment a bit. All the rest are then more<br/>or less beating, depending on timbre and pitch...</p><p>The question may really be unresolvable if we believe (as Helmholtz<br/>more or less said) that sufficiently low single notes with a<br/>sufficiently strong high harmonic content are perceived as dissonant<br/>and rough in themselves.

Actual threads about alternative theories of harmony are quite thin on the ground.  There are good reasons for this.

They&apos;re going to associate neutral thirds with 11:9 and neutral seconds with 12:11 or 11:10.  That really comes down to other people not being you.

This is especially true in that<br/>&gt; meantone is an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; English language term, and the term has come to mean more.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But by taking the term to &quot;mean more&quot;, that is to describe a larger<br/>&gt; &gt; number of tuning, it actually means less, in that several of the<br/>&gt; &gt; salient qualities of meantone have to be given up to accomodate<br/>&gt; &gt; tunings which (a) do not have mean tones, (b) do not have just<br/>&gt; major<br/>&gt; &gt; thirds, and possibly, depending upon what tunings you include in<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; family: (c) are not regular, or (d) do not have larger diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; semitones than chromatic semitones, etc..<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The English language term meantone is precisely analogous to terms<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; other languages (German Mittelton, French ton moyen etc.) and the<br/>&gt; &gt; fact that it has been misused in the past -- some 19th century<br/>&gt; &gt; theorists used it to describe _all_ non-equal 12-tone keyboard<br/>&gt; &gt; tunings and Ll.S. Lloyd used it as a synonym for just intonation --<br/>&gt; &gt; is simply not an argument for misusing it further.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The comparison of meatone with other tunings is very important, but<br/>&gt; &gt; we have adequate vocabulary to do that correctly: &quot;meantone-like&quot;<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; often useful, and in an active theoretical and practical enviroment<br/>&gt; &gt; like ours, in which such a large number of possible and practical<br/>&gt; &gt; tunings are under consideration, what&apos;s the harm in simply being<br/>&gt; &gt; explicit about the most salient feature, which, in the family<br/>&gt; &gt; presently under discussion, is the regular distribution of the<br/>&gt; &gt; syntonic comma, and not many of the other salient charcateristics<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; meantone.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; djw<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve tried to pick &amp; choose carefully those threads in which to<br/>&gt; participate, lest I become obligated to commit much more time &amp;<br/>&gt; effort than I had expected in their resolution.

It&apos;s strange for a meantone not to have mean tones but we didn&apos;t invent the term &quot;1/4-comma meantone&quot; which implies this possibility.</p><p>&gt; The English language term meantone is precisely analogous to terms in &gt; other languages (German Mittelton, French ton moyen etc.) and the &gt; fact that it has been misused in the past -- some 19th century &gt; theorists used it to describe _all_ non-equal 12-tone keyboard &gt; tunings and Ll.S.

To compare cats with other animals we could say &quot;cat-like&quot; but who ever does?  When the need came to talk about other members of the cat family we generalized the word &quot;cat&quot;.  So if somebody says &quot;a tiger is a cat&quot; we know exactly what they mean, and don&apos;t expect tigers to make good pets or be interested in catching mice.

Most of us are working in different areas so it&apos;s<br/>&gt; difficult to find common ground.  A lot of artists aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; good at explaining what they actually do.  So, no, there<br/>&gt; aren&apos;t long threads about alternative harmonic theories.</p><p>It&apos;s not just this tuning list. Although some might claim<br/>otherwise, this tuning list is not an<br/>ivory tower or self-contained system. I perform in public<br/>and physically promote &quot;alternative&quot; tuning- we&apos;re right in<br/>the middle of a mini-festival I have organized, of non-standard<br/>music and performance (great shadow-theatre to-nite, we had an<br/>Indian raga, sarod and tabla, last week). I guess everybody<br/>here has musical stuff going on in the physical world. So,<br/>when I bitch about something I feel to a fundamental problem,<br/>don&apos;t take it personally because I think bogosities<br/>are evident everywhere in tuning theory.

You look like one of the gang.</p><p>&gt;&gt;not the burning issues &gt;&gt;that you think they should be talking about. &gt; &gt; Where do you get this crazy stuff from? I am saying: there<br/>&gt; must be certain assumptions about what is &quot;central&quot; (a subset/<br/>&gt; interpretation of &quot;JI&quot; to be specific) to tuning, otherwise<br/>&gt; the worlds of tuning that are not bound to that presumed center<br/>&gt; would be far more in evidence. Your original argument seemed to be that if we understood certain obvious things to be obvious (that there&apos;s more to life than getting close to JI, and high and low make a difference) then we&apos;d be talking about the one particular subject that&apos;s still in the quotes above.</p><p>Have you considered that some subjects are inherently easier to talk about than others?  Or that different list subscribers have different assumptions and presumptions to the generalization you&apos;re painting?</p><p>&gt; The work here (I continually read the archives) on &gt; the possibities of : 1/1,(6/5),5/4,3/2 (7/4) : is staggering in &gt; quantity and excellent in quality.

Of course that was also about there being too much temperament.  You seem to be equating temperament with JI.  If you carry this logic any further you should be careful on zebra crossings.</p><p>&gt; Now this is just fine, to each their own, as I said<br/>&gt; in the generative post of this particular sprawling &gt; discussion, if it really is a matter of musical<br/>&gt; preference. But if it&apos;s a matter of assuming the &gt; divine right or manifest destiny of this particular &gt; subset of JI, that&apos;s a different story. What you said was &quot;I feel that the whole basic idea of basing tunings on approximating Just intervals is of dubious artistic integrity.&quot;  Hardly an inclusive sentiment.</p><p>&gt; By the way I am fully aware of the &quot;natural&quot; force of<br/>&gt; the aforesaid subset of JI, and I bet I could come<br/>&gt; up with more explanations and descriptions of its<br/>&gt; inborn weight than you could, for if you were truly<br/>&gt; aware of the myriad of things that give it weight<br/>&gt; you&apos;d anticipate the muscle of other interpretations<br/>&gt; of the harmonic series and not be trying to bicker with me. &gt; &gt; Hahaha! :-)</p><p>So where&apos;s the beef?  You&apos;re saying you object to treating (an incomplete) 7-limit JI as special, although of course it is?</p><p>Incidentally, you seem to be hung up on the 7-limit.  Well, that is as far as Paul got in the Middle Path paper.  And he says why.  Don&apos;t you believe him?</p><p>&gt;&gt;There are &gt;&gt;good reasons for this.  &gt;&gt;It takes a long time to produce a &gt;&gt;body of music from which you can deduce valuable harmonic &gt;&gt;rules.  Most of us are working in different areas so it&apos;s &gt;&gt;difficult to find common ground.  A lot of artists aren&apos;t &gt;&gt;good at explaining what they actually do.  So, no, there &gt;&gt;aren&apos;t long threads about alternative harmonic theories.<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s not just this tuning list. Although some might claim &gt; otherwise, this tuning list is not an &gt; ivory tower or self-contained system. I perform in public<br/>&gt; and physically promote &quot;alternative&quot; tuning- we&apos;re right in<br/>&gt; the middle of a mini-festival I have organized, of non-standard<br/>&gt; music and performance (great shadow-theatre to-nite, we had an<br/>&gt; Indian raga, sarod and tabla, last week). I guess everybody<br/>&gt; here has musical stuff going on in the physical world. So,<br/>&gt; when I bitch about something I feel to a fundamental problem,<br/>&gt; don&apos;t take it personally because I think bogosities<br/>&gt; are evident everywhere in tuning theory. Nor am I innocent of &gt; perpetuating of the same bogosities, for they are part and<br/>&gt; parcel of the theatrical sound-languages that most of the &gt; Western world mistakenly considers to be &quot;music&quot;. Good for you on the performances!  But you are bitching. And only the Western world -- am I out of it?</p><p>&gt;&gt;- The neutral third MOS (in the Middle Path paper as dicot, &gt;&gt;with a dubious 5-limit mapping).

And it was the spark that led to the Middle Path paper (and it&apos;s listed).</p><p>&gt;&gt;Of course some of these threads will involve messages that &gt;&gt;disagree with you about neutral intervals not being JI.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Where do you get this from? I have several definitions of<br/>&gt; JI, one ultra-conservative historical, one realistic and<br/>&gt; positive rather than negative (ie, audible coincident lower &gt; partials rather than &quot;beatlessness&quot;), and my own personal<br/>&gt; and private definition based on other concepts of what is &gt; a &quot;simple ratio&quot;. All three include &quot;neutral&quot; intervals.</p><p>From the original message I was quoting.  &grave;Show me the<br/>evidence that intervals are accepted for what they are, and not inevitably cartooned into &quot;tempered JI intervals&quot;.&apos;</p><p>&gt;&gt;They&apos;re going to associate neutral thirds with 11:9 and &gt;&gt;neutral seconds with 12:11 or 11:10.  &gt; &gt; That&apos;s fine as long as it doesn&apos;t imply that for example 27/22<br/>&gt; is a detuned 11/9, an audibly bogus idea as I physically &gt; experienced the other week, singing with a couple of &gt; musicians who performed in the festival.</p><p>I usually work with systems where 11/9 and 27/22 approximate to the same interval.  It simplifies matters.</p><p>&gt;&gt;That really comes down &gt;&gt;to other people not being you. &gt; &gt; This is something you should really take to heart. There are<br/>&gt; many intervals I, and the musicians I work with afaik, simply<br/>&gt; do not hear as detuned JI intervals, and &quot;dissonances&quot; that<br/>&gt; simply do not sound dissonant.

What do they call the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;meantone class?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Salinas is defintely exploring this class, as a class<br/>(independent<br/>&gt; &gt; from pythagorean, for example), and Werckmeister&apos;s temperaments<br/>can<br/>&gt; &gt; defintely be construed as classes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then what does Salinas call it?  (I take it you&apos;re using<br/>&gt; &quot;French&quot; to denote the Romance language branch.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe I should have said &quot;regular temperament classes&quot;.  But<br/>&gt; still, if temperament class means &quot;a set of temperaments<br/>&gt; with the same mapping from ratios to interval classes&quot; I can<br/>&gt; happily accept different irregular temperament classes.<br/>&gt; They&apos;d each have same number of notes to the octave.  Did<br/>&gt; Werckmeister look at many such or did he only consider 12?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Saying the term is historically confused is a strange<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;argument for imposing a strict definition now.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I specifically indicated that incidents of historical confusion<br/>arose<br/>&gt; &gt; in the late 19th century, well after the meantone era, in<br/>conflating<br/>&gt; &gt; all non-12tet keyboard tunings (a mistake not made by the better<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning theorists: Bosanquet, Riemann, Tanaka etc.) and in the<br/>20th<br/>&gt; &gt; century, with Lloyd who used it synonymously with just, and with<br/>this<br/>&gt; &gt; group. Even the oft-confused Barbour has it right, and his book<br/>&gt; &gt; usefully is organized into what may be construed as classes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But George said it was Barbour who invented the &quot;fractional<br/>&gt; comma meantone&quot; terminology.  So did he or did he not use<br/>&gt; &quot;meantone&quot; for tunings other than 1/4-comma?</p><p>To the best of my recollection he did, because I specifically<br/>remember reading his caveat that, strictly speaking, the<br/>label &quot;meantone&quot; designates the regular temperament (i.e., what we<br/>call a regular tuning) having fifths narrow by 1/4 (syntonic) comma.<br/>(Had he not used the &quot;m/n-meantone&quot; terminology, there would have<br/>been no reason for the caveat.)  I have the book (but not handy at<br/>the moment), so I&apos;ll have to look for something to quote.  (I&apos;ll be<br/>away from the internet till Monday, so I won&apos;t be able to report back<br/>till then.)</p><p>It&apos;s important to observe that he considered these other tunings<br/>*variants* of the meantone temperament, so that without any m/n<br/>qualifier the term &quot;meantone&quot; would default to the tuning with 1/4-<br/>comma fifths.  To use the term &quot;meantone&quot;, without any qualifier, to<br/>represent an entire class of tunings (named after its pre-eminent<br/>member) would deprive the term of the context required for the proper<br/>interpretation of its meaning.</p><p>There&apos;s another thing I should point out about Barbour&apos;s<br/>terminology.  The title of his book is _Tuning and Temperament_, and<br/>he treats the terms &quot;tuning&quot; and &quot;temperament&quot; as mutually<br/>exclusive!  For Barbour a tuning is what we would call a *rational<br/>tuning*, while a temperament is what we would call a *tempered<br/>tuning*.  (I&apos;ll report back with a quote confirming this.)  To the<br/>best of my knowledge, everyone back then understood the<br/>term &quot;temperament&quot; to mean either a tempered tuning or the process of<br/>altering intervals to produce a tempered tuning (and that has always<br/>been my understanding of the term).</p><p>This is very different from the distinction Gene makes between those<br/>two terms, if I&apos;m interpreting him correctly.</p><p>&gt; &quot;Temperament class&quot; is a technical term.  It means a set of<br/>&gt; temperaments with the same mapping.</p><p>As I understand it, Gene is now using the word &quot;temperament&quot; to refer<br/>to a whole class of temperaments (having the same mapping) and the<br/>word &quot;meantone&quot; to refer to the temperament (class) that arrives at<br/>its best 5/4 by a chain of fifths.  This is in distinction to the<br/>term &quot;tuning&quot;, which refers to a set of tones with specific interval<br/>sizes (either rational or irrational).  Is this correct, Gene?</p><p>If so, then I&apos;m afraid that the rest of the musical world is going to<br/>take exception to the way these terms have been redefined.  It&apos;s<br/>going to alienate others, something we can ill afford to do.</p><p>As far as I&apos;m concerned, it&apos;s okay to use &quot;tuning&quot; to apply to either<br/>rational or irrational tunings (since I&apos;m not sure that anyone is<br/>currently using it the way Barbour defined it), but the use<br/>of &quot;temperament&quot; (in the singular) for an entire class of tunings,<br/>and &quot;meantone&quot; or &quot;meantone temperament&quot; for a particular class of<br/>tunings, is guaranteed to lead to confusion, because mainstream<br/>authorities don&apos;t use those terms that way.  The term &quot;meantone<br/>temperament&quot; (without any qualifiers) invariably indicates the 1/4-<br/>comma tuning (and &quot;comma&quot; in that context is understood to mean<br/>80:81).  That&apos;s the way Barbour understood it, and that&apos;s the way the<br/>rest of the musical world understands it.  To use the term otherwise<br/>is to invite confusion.</p><p>&gt; It isn&apos;t the same as an<br/>&gt; organization into what &quot;may be construed as classes&quot;.  Did<br/>&gt; Barbour give names to a number of temperament classes?  If<br/>&gt; so, what were they?</p><p>He did classify temperaments (i.e., tempered tunings) in various<br/>ways, e.g., regular vs. irregular and open vs. closed.  Apart from<br/>that, I don&apos;t remember any formal classes.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=73130 href="#73130">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

James Cook, of Mathemusicality makes what<br/>&gt; might<br/>&gt; &gt; be called a strong (and, imo, cranky) voice leading argument for<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; ultimate irrelevance of harmonic theory.

In my work -- still in progress -- about<br/>Javanese<br/>&gt; &gt; gender playing, I try to show that the two-voice gender style<br/>uses<br/>&gt; &gt; the maximal contrapuntal complexity in a pentatonic enviroment,<br/>&gt; &gt; drawing a parallel with modal counterpoint in a seven-tone<br/>&gt; &gt; environment.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; From your messages here, I take it that your interest is in<br/>&gt; creating<br/>&gt; &gt; a polyphonic voice leading enviroment which is pitch- and<br/>interval-<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; richer than traditional western diatonic or chromatic<br/>&gt; enviroments.  I<br/>&gt; &gt; am not certain how much I can help you, but the harmonic use of<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals suggesting, if not actually corresponding to,<br/>&gt; &gt; configurations higher up in the harmonic series (especially &quot;mid-<br/>&gt; &gt; tone&quot; intervals like 11:10, 12:11, 13:12, but also neutral and<br/>&gt; wider<br/>&gt; &gt; thirds 11:9, 9:7, 14:11) found in Bulgarian or Georgian choral<br/>&gt; music,<br/>&gt; &gt; especially in higher (female) tessituras is definitely worth<br/>&gt; &gt; exploring.  I would really like to have some in-depth analysis<br/>to<br/>&gt; see<br/>&gt; &gt; if these interval do, indeed, &quot;lock&quot; over consonant difference<br/>&gt; tones.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Paul Erlich, who was very active on this list in the past,<br/>&gt; correctly<br/>&gt; &gt; pointed out that the dominant 9th chord (c-e-g-bb-d) represented<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; particular limit in 12tet harmonic practice, in that, within<br/>&gt; 12tet,<br/>&gt; &gt; this chord and its inversion, the subharmonic 9th chord, were<br/>&gt; &gt; intonationally indistinguishable.  I have a suspicion that these<br/>&gt; &gt; choral practices with harmonies in the 9:10:11:12:13:14<br/>&gt; neighborhood<br/>&gt; &gt; (lots of major seconds and midtones) are touching a similar<br/>level<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; ambiguity or limit of clearly-defined intervals, and that<br/>singers<br/>&gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; simply aiming for interval that lock over good difference tones<br/>&gt; &gt; rather than consistantly aiming for particular pitches and<br/>&gt; intervals.<br/>&gt; &gt; If so, this could indicate a path to a very flexible -- if<br/>&gt; somewhat<br/>&gt; &gt; chaotic in functional harmonic terms -- form of voice leading.<br/>But<br/>&gt; &gt; this is no more than a suspicion on my part.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; djw<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=73251 href="#73251">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2007 5:33:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don&apos;t you agree that it makes a difference whether you temper<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up or down<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; :-) And this is why I keep saying, ad nauseum, that &quot;sheer<br/>&gt; &gt; proximity to a JI interval is not enough&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It matters, but it doesn&apos;t matter so much that it isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; appropriate to ignore it as an expedient way to do<br/>&gt; calculations.

The Pythagorean tuning, equal temperament, meantone<br/>temperament -- all are regular systems.  The systems that follow are<br/>also regular, with values for the fifth smaller than that of equal<br/>temperament and (usually) larger than that of the meantone<br/>temperament.  Since their construction is similar, it is easy to<br/>describe them as varieities of the meantone temperament.  In all of<br/>them, the tone is precisely half of the major third.  No harm will be<br/>done by such a nomenclature if we realize that these are regular<br/>temperaments which the earlier theorists themselves considered of the<br/>same type as the 1/4-comma temperament and some of which they<br/>preferred to it.</p><p>The first regular temperament to be advocated after the description<br/>of the ordinary meantone temperament was that described by Zarlino in<br/>which &quot;each fifth remains diminished and imperfect by 2/7 comma.&quot; ...</p><p>In Table 26, we see the 2/7-comma temperament applied to a keyboard<br/>with 12 notes to the octave.  ...</p><p>The next variety of meantone temperament is also highly<br/>unsatisfactory when applied to an octave of twelve semitones.

This particular difference in terminology is<br/>not at issue in this discussion.</p><p>2) Barbour&apos;s definition of &quot;temperament&quot; is such that, if we compare<br/>it with his definition of &quot;a tuning, we must conclude that he<br/>intended the term to apply to what we call a (single) &quot;tempered<br/>tuning&quot;, not to multiple tempered tunings in the same classification.</p><p>3) Barbour avoided using the word &quot;meantone&quot; in identifying specific<br/>temperaments, except in the case of the 1/4-comma (meantone)<br/>temperament.

However, I&apos;d say that the most famous<br/>representative member of the class is the latter (12-equal) rather<br/>than the former (1/4-comma), so if we&apos;re naming the temperament class<br/>that way, perhaps we should call it &quot;equal&quot; rather<br/>than &quot;meantone&quot;.  &quot;No way!&quot; you say?  I submit that, to theorists<br/>outside this group, it&apos;s just as confusing (should I say outrageous?)<br/>to call meantone temperament &quot;equal&quot; as to call equal<br/>temperament &quot;meantone&quot;.  When you have terms that have long been<br/>thought of (and frequently written about) as *mutually exclusive* by<br/>many authorities, you&apos;re asking for trouble if you insist on using<br/>one of these as a name for a category that includes the other.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; [#73302]<br/>&gt; I agree with Monz, we can live with both a &apos;narrow&apos; and a &apos;broad&apos;<br/>&gt; definition, the difference is determined (hopefully) by context.</p><p>Hopefully by context?

Must they be<br/>&gt; rechristened &apos;tuning ordinaire&apos; etc.)</p><p>Temperament is still a generic word for these things; what Gene is describing is more specifically a &quot;regular temperament&quot;. I noticed that Gene used the word &quot;abstract&quot; to describe these things, whatever we want to call them. Actually, &quot;abstract temperament&quot; might be a good name for these &quot;mathematical&quot; things after all (if we want to reserve &quot;temperament&quot; for a particular implementation with specific intervals). In which case we might call this an &quot;abstract regular temperament&quot; or a &quot;regular abstract temperament&quot;. Then we can still go about calling them &quot;temperaments&quot; with the understanding that this is a convenient abridgement of these longer terms.</p><p>&gt; If I ask how this or that piece sounds in &apos;2/7 comma meantone<br/>&gt; (temperament)&apos;, none of the words means a mathematical construct. They<br/>&gt; mean that someone tuned an (unspecified) instrument with some<br/>&gt; (unspecified) pitch standard by narrowing each fifth, or widening<br/>&gt; fourths, etc., by some particular amount ... or someone programmed a<br/>&gt; tone-producing computer! ... in order to render certain harmonic<br/>&gt; progressions tolerable. Some features of the audible result will be<br/>&gt; very well approximated by mathematical entities (and hopefully we can<br/>&gt; see beyond the ends of our noses that inaudible inaccuracies in tuning<br/>&gt; are ignorable) but what I mean is the audible result.</p><p>Certainly the sounds are what counts; it doesn&apos;t make sense to ask what something sounds like in 12&amp;19 regular temperament (12&amp;19-RT), since there are many possible implementations of this abstract system. 12-ET and 19-ET are only two convenient reference points. You can even tune 12&amp;19-RT with fifths wider than 12-ET or narrower than 19-ET. But it does make sense to investigate what chord progressions are possible in 12&amp;19-RT, since the 81/80 comma vanishes in this system. And you can crunch the numbers and come up with an optimal tuning of this thing, either using TOP or TOP-RMS, or some other method (the results are similar but not identical). In this case it ends up sounding much like a typical meantone tuning. But there are so many of these things that you get lost if you don&apos;t name some of them. 12&amp;19-RT is a meantone-like system, so it&apos;s only natural to call it &quot;meantone&quot; for convenience. But in a more general context, where &quot;meantone&quot; already has an understood meaning, maybe we could call it something like &quot;abstract meantone&quot;.</p><p>&gt; If one wants to be more precise, a temperament is a way to tune<br/>&gt; musical intervals where at least some intervals are adjusted away from<br/>&gt; purity by an irrational amount. Even without a very accurate<br/>&gt; mathematical description of what this amount is (eg temperament<br/>&gt; ordinaire!) one can have a temperament.</p><p>I agree with the exception that the adjustment isn&apos;t necessarily irrational. It tends to be so, but Hammond organs for instance are tuned to a rational scale.</p><p>&gt; This group is &apos;tuning&apos; not &apos;tuning-math&apos;. If someone wants to talk<br/>&gt; about relevant mathematics they are welcome, but it does no good to<br/>&gt; complain that other people are using words in the traditional and<br/>&gt; practical sense of audible procedures and results in tuning. &gt; ~~~T~~~</p><p>There have been numerous changes in the terminology used to describe these &quot;middle path&quot; sorts of constructs, so many that I can understand the reluctance to change yet again. The problem is you need *some* words to talk about the things to begin with, but those don&apos;t always turn out to be the best words in the long run. Unless you have a good memory for numbers (then you can just use wedgies to identify these things).</p></div><h3><a id=73401 href="#73401">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2007 7:09:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman wrote...<br/>&gt; I agree with the exception that the adjustment isn&apos;t necessarily<br/>&gt; irrational.</p><p>I was hoping someone would say this.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=73403 href="#73403">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2007 7:23:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>George D.

Since it appears that &quot;m/n-<br/>&gt; comma meantone&quot; has been used too often in the recent past to &gt; backtrack and redo the terminology, I&apos;m willing to go along with a &gt; term such as &quot;meantone family&quot; to designate the related group of &gt; (regular) tempered tunings of which the meantone temperament is a &gt; member.  In a discussion of temperament families &quot;meantone &gt; temperament&quot; could thereby be shortened to &quot;meantone&quot;, as long as the &gt; qualifier &quot;family&quot; was clearly indicated by the context.<br/>&gt; &gt; But if not &quot;family&quot;, then what?</p><p>I really think &quot;family&quot; would be better as a term for a group of related &quot;abstract regular temperaments&quot; or whatever we&apos;re going to call these, which share one or more commas. E.g. the starling family includes related (abstract regular) temperaments such as myna and grackle, which temper out 126/125. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything family-like about what we&apos;ve been calling &quot;regular temperaments&quot;. E.g. myna can be thought of as any tuning system in which 126/125, 1728/1715, 2401/2400, etc. are all tempered out. This is like a slice through the space of possible tunings, a continuous region. Another way to describe myna would be using ET&apos;s as reference points, e.g. 27&amp;31. Or you could just use the wedgie &lt;&lt;10, 9, 7, -9, -17, -9]], but no one remembers that. The point is that it&apos;s not a collection of separate but related tunings; it&apos;s an abstract property shared by a whole range of possible tunings.</p><p>I don&apos;t personally see any problem with using &quot;meantone temperament&quot; as a name for the 12&amp;19 regular temperament, as the context is always clear. It doesn&apos;t bother me that bankers use the word &quot;default&quot; with a meaning different from what I&apos;m familiar with from computer science. But I can see the potential for confusion in a forum like this one where historical and new tuning systems are both frequent topics of discussion. So I&apos;m willing to consider something along the lines of &quot;abstract meantone&quot;. But I wouldn&apos;t go so far as to abandon any connection with meantone. This is the one system that anyone has much chance of already being familiar with, and it&apos;s a good point of reference when starting off on a trip into &quot;middle path&quot; space; it should have a familiar name.</p></div><h3><a id=73404 href="#73404">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.

By that I mean a set of intervals measured between notes.  For example, 5:4 maps to 4 steps on a 12 note scale.  You then have a separate mapping (not a homomorophism) from notes to pitches which allows for steps being of different sizes. This definition is fine for irregular temperaments.

Als Direktor der K&iuml;&iquest;&half;nigl.<br/>Hochschule f&iuml;&iquest;&half;r Musik machte er Berlin zum Zentrum des<br/>Geigenunterrichts in Deutschland. Sowohl als Solist als auch als<br/>Quartettspieler und P&iuml;&iquest;&half;dagoge beeinflusste er fast 50 Jahre lang<br/>Generationen von intern. Geigern, die wiederum als hochgesch&iuml;&iquest;&half;tzte<br/>Orchestermusiker (Konzertmeister), Kammermusiker und Solisten<br/>hervortraten. Auch nur einige seiner bekanntesten Sch&iuml;&iquest;&half;ler und<br/>Sch&iuml;&iquest;&half;lerinnen hier anzuf&iuml;&iquest;&half;hren w&iuml;&iquest;&half;rde den Rahmen sprengen, aber<br/>wenigstens Leopold Auer w&iuml;&iquest;&half;re zu nennen, dessen bekannteste Sch&iuml;&iquest;&half;ler<br/>wiederum Heifetz, Elman, Milstein, Hansen, Seidel und Zimbalist waren<br/>(Hier k&iuml;&iquest;&half;nnte man nun schon mit einem Buch beginnen).<br/>Wir haben bei unserer Besch&iuml;&iquest;&half;ftigung mit der Kammermusik und dem<br/>Violin-Solo-Werk von Max Reger bemerkt, dass der Komponist diese Werke<br/>vor allem Joachim-Sch&iuml;&iquest;&half;lern gewidmet hat.

Can one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;blame<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; them?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s the point- using the interval you actually want, whether<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s tempered, just, or whatever. Don&apos;t you see that this does<br/>&gt; &gt; not jibe with the idea of rating intervals as more or<br/>less &quot;good&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; or &quot;bad&quot; according to their proximity to Just intervals?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your argument is semantic. I can see why someone would call 40/27 a<br/>&gt; &apos;bad&apos; 3/2, but the same person would still use it to make music.</p><p>Argument? My statement of fact :-) is conceptual.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In any event, I would suggest not feeling shame for liking the<br/>&gt; intervals you like b/c you feel that the labels are unfair or<br/>&gt; something. Whether or not 40/27 is a &apos;bad&apos; fifth--use it if you &gt;<br/>&gt;like<br/>&gt; &apos;bad&apos; fifths!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;Why should one blame them?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Who is blaming &quot;them&quot;? I also use tempered intervals, as well as<br/>&gt; &gt; Just intervals, and intervals which are neither tempered, nor<br/>&gt; &gt; Just, but follow a different logic- all in the same tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt; My original comment referred to the &quot;middle path&quot; paper, and<br/>&gt; &gt; I was referring both to truth-to-materials and to the general<br/>&gt; &gt; idea of what exactly is it we&apos;re aiming for when either choose<br/>or<br/>&gt; &gt; temper intervals? How this gets interpreted as tempered &quot;vs&quot; JI<br/>or<br/>&gt; &gt; extrapolated into some kind of general attack on the &quot;regular<br/>&gt; &gt; mapping paradigm&quot; is beyond me, for by advocating the idea<br/>&gt; &gt; of is-what-it-is, I&apos;m actually also talking about what seems to<br/>me<br/>&gt; &gt; to be an excellent potential usage of &quot;regular mapping&quot;, mo&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; better than using it as a rhinestone factory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wasn&apos;t saying _you_ were blaming anyone...I was more responding<br/>&gt;to<br/>&gt; Kraig&apos;s statement that non-JI intervals were of dubious artistic<br/>&gt; integrity. All due respect to Kraig and his amazingly good music,<br/>&gt;this<br/>&gt; statement makes no sense when you unravel it.</p><p>AFAIK Kraig did not make that statement, nor did anyone else.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snipped&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;If yes, I would wonder why one would accept those and &gt;not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; similar approximations in systems designed to be practical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;expediants<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to reduce the gamut of notes required to make music.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Approximation? 40/27 is approximation of what?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3/2...and a &apos;bad&apos; one...</p><p>But it is not. It is what it is. You can use it functionally as<br/>in the same way you&apos;d use a 3/2, but it&apos;s not an approximation<br/>of 3/2 because it sounds different. Even in the most tertian<br/>and restricted view, it&apos;s a &quot;grave fifth&quot;, not a &quot;fifth&quot;. Neither<br/>audibly nor historically is it an approximate 3/2.</p><p>&gt;you are going a different direction with &gt;this<br/>&gt; than I am--Most temperaments are designed as a compromised JI,<br/>&gt; historically speaking.</p><p>You state that as a fact, but is it? Historically speaking,<br/>most music is basically monophonic, modulating little or none in the<br/>Western sense, and the primary function of temperament must be<br/>coloristic.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mind you, I am not saying that 40/27 isn&apos;t pleasing on some level,<br/>&gt;or<br/>&gt; useful, or &apos;bad&apos; in an absolute sense...it&apos;s all relative to one&apos;s<br/>&gt;goals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Lesses, I can enter<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals into scala without displaying them, what does it sound<br/>&gt; &gt; like? Very nice! It sounds like a &quot;perfect interval&quot; in<br/>character<br/>&gt; &gt; but it&apos;s not a fifth or a fourth... much more &quot;M3&quot;-flavored, and<br/>&gt; &gt; more beer than wine... okay 680 cents. Sweet. Scala calls it<br/>&gt; &gt; a &quot;grave fifth&quot;, which is a swanky moniker but I fail to find<br/>&gt; &gt; anything &quot;grave&quot; about something that sounds like a pint of ale<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; me- in sound it&apos;s not 3/2 with an &quot;accent grave&quot;, if anything it<br/>&gt; &gt; sounds like an extremely broad version of some unidentifiable<br/>&gt; &gt; interval, like if you mated 5/4 and 4/3 and cornfed their baby.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; funny!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s not an &quot;approximation&quot; of jack. 700 cents is<br/>&gt; &gt; an &quot;approximation&quot; of 3/2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; by your logic 700 cents is it&apos;s own thing, too, one would think.<br/>&gt;you<br/>&gt; seem to be saying that nothing is ever an approximation to<br/>anything else.</p><p>&quot;By my logic&quot; the harmonic series does exist, as well as pitch<br/>flucation, and  different levels of accuracy, and different<br/>timbres,so I do not seem at all to be saying that nothing<br/>is an approximation of anything else. Once again it is contextual-<br/>in most contexts 700 cents is clearly an approximation of 3/2,<br/>don&apos;t confuse fundamental concepts with splitting hairs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe that the idea the music making can and should be<br/>&gt;limited<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; one tuning system or another is dubious....I really try to<br/>look at<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; final artwork, and I try not to assign my like or dislike to<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt; based<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on the tuning.....just my take on all this.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; IV-I! So you&apos;ll agree with me in avoiding rating intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; as mo&apos; good or mo&apos; bad by virtue of their proximity to JI<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, not exactly..it&apos;s useful language if you goal is to be as true<br/>&gt;to<br/>&gt; JI as possible while having transposition.</p><p>Hehe, that&apos;s a real can of worms... for some other time.</p><p>take care,</p><p>Cameron Bobro</p></div>
