I started out, like Johnston, going for a Just basis and<br/>getting quite confussed seing books where a modifier had to be used to<br/>make C-E a 5:4 major third.  Now, I can see more advantages in the<br/>Pythagorean approach, but they aren&apos;t overwhelming.  I&apos;ll outline the<br/>pros and cons.</p><p>One thing I don&apos;t like about the Johnston notation is the profusion of<br/>accidental types.  I&apos;d prefer to notate to a temperament, and leave<br/>the fune tuning to the performer.  This may run into problems with<br/>reality, but I don&apos;t need to worry about that.  It also seems that the<br/>more accidentals, the more mental arithmetic you expect the performers<br/>to do while they&apos;re reading the score.  And the same goes for ratio or<br/>prime lattice notations.</p><p>The main temperaments I can see value in writing around are meantone,<br/>12-equal and schismic.  I think I&apos;ll take them in turn.</p><p>meantone<br/>--------</p><p>This is the most obvious for staff notation.  You can write 5-limit<br/>chords with out anything special happening, and reserve some new<br/>modifiers (v and ^ look good these days) for 7- or 11-limit intervals,<br/>with 31-equal as the basis.  This is what I&apos;d go with most of the<br/>time.</p><p>12-equal<br/>--------</p><p>This would mean either writing in cents deviations or using symbols<br/>for 72-equal.  You may want two extra pairs of symbols, to cover both<br/>quartertones and sixth-tones.  Say v and ^ for the former and / and \<br/>for the latter.  If three pairs of symbols is too much, a 12 note<br/>staff would be better, but also has problems with backwards<br/>compatibility.  It would also meant that similar chords always have<br/>similar notation.</p><p>If your scale doesn&apos;t fit meantone or schismic, cents deviations from<br/>12-equal will probably be the best option.</p><p>The big advantage of assuming the traditional symbols refer to<br/>12-equal is that it seems to correspond most closely to what<br/>performers expect.</p><p>schismic<br/>--------</p><p>For 11-limit music, 41-equal will be the basis.  \ and / can then be<br/>used for comma shifts.  I think it&apos;s best to keep to a 12-note gamut,<br/>so performers don&apos;t have to think about which way round G# and Ab are.</p><p>I&apos;d also like the particular 12 notes to depend on an extended key<br/>signature.  I think Ellis also proposed this, although he&apos;s lumped in<br/>with the Pythagoreanists.  Anyway, for C major here are the arguments<br/>for placing the wolf between D and A:</p><p>You get a compact structure on the lattice:</p><p>              A---E---B---F#--C#--G#<br/>             / \ / \ / \ /<br/>Ab--Eb--Bb--F---C---G---D</p><p>This means that a piece which is rooted on those nominals will require<br/>few comma modifiers and therefore look simpler on the page.  You&apos;ll<br/>tend to find D requires two different pitches for 5-limit harmony.<br/>When you get beyond 5-limit, it starts to look less consistent, so<br/>this argument is weaker.  But then you might find a higher limit scale<br/>that it makes sense to start with.</p><p>&lt;ASIDE&gt;</p><p>You could even make it</p><p>F#--C#--G#<br/> \ / \ / \<br/>  A---E---B<br/> / \ / \ / \<br/>F---C---G---D<br/>     \ / \ /<br/>      Eb--Bb</p><p>which would make some sense for 5-limit JI as there are lots of chords<br/>that can be written without needing any comma shifts.  I think this<br/>matches Johnston&apos;s notation.  If he didn&apos;t keep to these chords, too<br/>bad.  It doesn&apos;t make much sense for schismic anyway.</p><p>You could also try the 7-limit</p><p>   A-----E-----B<br/>  / \ F#/ \ C#/ \ G#<br/> / Eb\ / Bb\ /   \<br/>F-----C-----G-----D</p><p>that may be useful as a &quot;key signature&quot; but not really a default<br/>scale.</p><p>&lt;/ASIDE&gt;</p><p>The unmodified scale is more like what you would play in meantone.  If<br/>you&apos;re used to just thirds, you won&apos;t need a \ to tell you to play<br/>them.  You will have to think about what D you play.  This does assume<br/>that your performers will be familiar with the 5-limit nature of<br/>meantone notation, which tends not to be the case.</p><p>The # and b symbols don&apos;t refer to more than half a tone.  This would<br/>be what performers would expect if they were familiar with meantone<br/>notation.  I think they should be before they get to worrying about<br/>advanced concepts like comma shifts.  Unfortunately, the symbols don&apos;t<br/>match a 25:24 chromatic semitone, so the minor third above C is Eb/<br/>rather than plain Eb.</p><p>You don&apos;t have to worry about the difference between G# and Ab because<br/>they come out the same.  So do D# and Eb.  The wolf is placed right<br/>out in the open where everyone can see it, instead of hidden in the<br/>flats to bite the unwary.</p><p>My 29 note keyboard mapping fits a wolf D-A.  This is an important<br/>detail for me.</p><p>The advantages I see in a G#-Eb wolf are:</p><p>Most performers these days who don&apos;t think in 12-equal seem to think<br/>in Pythagorean terms.</p><p>The position of the wolf is consistent with the way it&apos;s written down,<br/>so you don&apos;t need to give extra instructions.  However, if you follow<br/>this rule you can&apos;t consider G# and Ab equivalent, so if you want to<br/>use both you have to tell your performers the difference between them.</p><p>Intervals have a consistent way of being commatized, provided they<br/>don&apos;t stray too far into the flats.  If this is what you want, using<br/>72-equal should make it work a lot better.  With schismic temperament<br/>you&apos;ll be led towards endless chains of fifths, with ambiguity between<br/>12-note enharmonies.  And staff notation isn&apos;t consistent this way to<br/>start with because a minor third could be A-C or C-Eb.  A 12 note<br/>staff with 72-equal would work perfectly.</p><p>I think I&apos;ll stick to a D-A wolf for my own purposes, when I&apos;m using<br/>schismic temperament, but re-write for a Pythagorean assumption if a<br/>violinist ever has to read the music.</p><p>One compromise would be to use the Pythagorean basis, but with both<br/>comma and diesis pairs such that v==\\ and ^==//.  Then, you can write<br/>so that it makes sense in meantone if you strip out the commas.  Then<br/>again, if you want to write in meantone you can do that with less<br/>complexity.  Perhaps a lazy version of this idea, using a comma shift<br/>only where it wouldn&apos;t be expected.  So if you insist on a major tone<br/>between C and D, write the latter as D/.  And if you want a<br/>Pythagorean major third, write it as C-E/.  But leave D-F-A as D-F-A.<br/> I think this comma shift would match Vicentino&apos;s comma symbol.</p><p>                        Graham</p></div><h3><a id=21512 href="#21512">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/24/2001 8:27:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Graham Breed&quot; &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21432.html#21432">/tuning/topicId_21432.html#21432</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The # and b symbols don&apos;t refer to more than half a tone.

By intuition, right<br/>judgement, and very hard and extensive training (to which you refer,<br/>later in this post), the singer has his &apos;incorrect&apos; tone adjusted<br/>quickly enough to the correct pitch, as it starts sounding as a<br/>note.</p><p>This becomes more challenging in the &quot;taan-s&quot;, the fast passages.<br/>But with sufficient talent and rigorous training, most singers do<br/>achieve this.  This is where the system of &quot;guru-shishya-parampara&quot;<br/>[guru-pupil-tradition] comes in the picture.  You need time, talent,<br/>training and guidance, to get many things right.  This is also where<br/>the gharana (school) becomes all-important, because you learn to<br/>emphasize specific aspects of aesthetics as taught in a particular<br/>gharana.</p><p>(4)  In the middle of all this, you are required to strictly follow<br/>the format of the raga, as stipulated in each gharana.<br/>(5) No intellectual effort is involved in all this, during<br/>performance.  It is pure and simple musical talent and hard work.<br/>Thinking and discussion may take place every once in a while, for<br/>clarification, during learning sessions.  In the old days, even such<br/>discussions were savagely discouraged. For example, when I was<br/>learning, my Ustad would not tell me even the name of the raga he was<br/>about to start teaching me. No theory, no information on the raga<br/>(vadi-samvadi, aroha-avaroha, etc. etc.)-- just the raga in all its<br/>depth, right from the beginning.<br/>(6) You may come to learn some theory from your seniors -- during<br/>those days, reading books was not even a remote possibility.  In fact<br/>hardly any books were available.  No writing of any kind is involved<br/>at any stage.</p><p>So, it takes a capable guru, very good talent, hard training,<br/>persistent effort, and ten to twelve years, to be able to really<br/>perform well.</p><p>I am sure hard work must be the first requirement in any music.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; For a notation where the performer must listen for a &quot;comma shift,&quot;<br/>&gt; in a fast tempo, if the performer has to listen to the QUALITY of<br/>the<br/>&gt; interval right off the top before &quot;adjusting&quot; it, there may not be<br/>&gt; that kind of target, and the adjustment may not be quick enough.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; THAT IS, unless the performer has so internalized the different<br/>comma<br/>&gt; distances that this &quot;target&quot; is there... which, of course, would<br/>&gt; require a particular and probably fairly extensive type of<br/>training...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (??)<br/>&gt; _______ _______ ______ ____<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=21539 href="#21539">ðŸ”—</a>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>4/24/2001 2:36:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My guess, which could be wrong, is that performers might be able to<br/>&gt; perceive these just intervals in slow tempos, but in faster tempos<br/>it<br/>&gt; would be impossible...

I&apos;m certain he would have a valuable opinion!&quot;</p><p>I probably haven&apos;t been able to trace the whole thread, and I haven&apos;t any<br/>personal interest in 72tet, so the following is a quick and dirty, if neutral<br/>view. Ezra Sims&apos; article on notation in Xenharmonikon XI presented both his<br/>notation, that of Richter Herf, and that of Rudolph Rasch. I suspect that the<br/>Richter-Herf notation, associated with the Mozarteum in Salzburg is as widely<br/>accepted as the the Sims-Maneri version with its own institutional associations,<br/>while Rasch&apos;s notation is associated with his Diapason Press.  None differs from<br/>the others in structure (i.e. all are viewed as alterations from 12tet) and can<br/>be usefully applied to each of the subsets of 72.  I have no attachment to a<br/>particular set of graphics, but do find Richter Herf&apos;s double-arrow-headed 12th<br/>tones to be counterintuitive (the single arrowheads are 6th tones), the Sims<br/>square-root-radical quartertones to be a bit odd, so I suppose that I&apos;d go with<br/>the Rasch.  In any case, any score composed in any of these notations will<br/>presumably come with a brief legend beforehand, spelling out what the signs<br/>represent.</p><p>The question of the ASCII representation is an interesting one. In order to<br/>avoid possible misunderstandings, why not simply include an additional mod 72<br/>number relative to C=0/72? That would be a small effort that goes a long way<br/>towards settling any possible ambiguity, avoids the whole issue of describing<br/>sizes of intervals in terms of fractions of tones, and may indeed have the added<br/>benefit to be more appropriate for describing musics that are outside more<br/>traditional tonal patterns.</p><p>This has probably not been too helpful.  As the three notations of which I am<br/>aware are structured similarly, I don&apos;t consider this to be as critical an issue<br/>as the question of notating Just Intonation on the basis of either a Pythagorean<br/>series or the diatonic syntonon.  In _that_ discussion, especially when it comes<br/>to the question of notating the music of Harry Partch, which only rarely relates<br/>to the diatonic syntonon and constantly features a strong sense of<br/>factor-identities, I come down firmly on the Pythagorean side. I like to teach<br/>Just Intonation to players by teaching them to tune particular intervals, not<br/>pitch classes, and the Pythagorean approach is ideal in that each interval<br/>graphic has an invariant rational interpretation: every notated perfect fifth,<br/>for example, should be interpreted as a ratio of 3:2.  If Johnston&apos;s music is<br/>indeed based upon the diatonic syntonon on c, then his notation may well be the<br/>best for his music, but I believe that his notation does not fit Partch&apos;s ideas<br/>well. But that&apos;s another discussion.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Composer,  Budapest/Morro Bay<br/><a href="mailto:djwolf1@matavnet.hu">djwolf1@matavnet.hu</a><br/><a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/</a></p></div><h3><a id=23872 href="#23872">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2001 9:33:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf1@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>Ezra Sims&apos; article on notation in Xenharmonikon XI presented<br/>both his<br/>&gt; notation, that of Richter Herf, and that of Rudolph Rasch.</p><p>Can someone please explain why Sims felt the need to invent another<br/>notation, given that he knew about these other two.</p><p>Can somoene please tell us what these two others look like. e.g. put<br/>up a scan or post some enlarged ASCII-graphics of them, or<br/>unambiguously describe them in words.</p><p>&gt; I suspect<br/>that the<br/>&gt; Richter-Herf notation, associated with the Mozarteum in Salzburg is<br/>as widely<br/>&gt; accepted as the the Sims-Maneri version with its own institutional<br/>associations,<br/>&gt; while Rasch&apos;s notation is associated with his Diapason Press.</p><p>A possible tie-breaker?

I thought previously that you meant linear temperament, but the<br/>line thru 12,19 and 31 does not include 17.</p><p>In fact you&apos;ve given a family of the kind that makes sense with<br/>fifth-nominals.</p><p>An ET may belong to many different and completely unrelated families<br/>in the sense of linear temperaments, but only to one or two families<br/>in the sense of range-of-fifth-sizes.</p><p>&gt; (without diesis symbols, and just using<br/>&gt; sharp flat and their doubles). True, there are issues here, but I&apos;m<br/>&gt; trying for the big view.</p><p>Well keep trying, and I&apos;ll be glad to help. There is definitely a<br/>place for these notations and I&apos;d like to see them done in a way that<br/>does not conflict with Sagittal but rather leverages off it in any way<br/>that is appropriate.</p><p>One of the things we did, to make sure we weren&apos;t closing off any<br/>possibilities for MOS-nominal notations using sagittal accidentals,<br/>was to not use any uppercase ASCII characters in our suggested ASCII<br/>shorthand for the accidentals (although the ASCII longhand does use X<br/>and Y in some uncommon symbols). So all uppercase ASCII are available<br/>as nominals in text.</p><p>By the way, Erv Wilson has a fascinating interlocking system of<br/>nominals for the most common (fifth-generated) LTs in an article<br/>published in Xenharmonikon 3, 1975, &apos;On Linear Notations and the<br/>Bosanquet Keyboard&apos;.</p><p>This article is probably on Kraig Grady&apos;s site. If anyone finds it<br/>could they please post the URL.</p><p>&gt; There are those that would argue that preserving the 5-line 7 nominal<br/>&gt; notation acts as a guide to performers, permitting them to see the<br/>&gt; scale in relation to their preconceived intonational scheme. This can<br/>&gt; be useful.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; But suppose we are now transported to another planet where the<br/>&gt; 11-nominal 19EDO scale is the norm: 22122212221, and they use a<br/>&gt; seven-line stave, but otherwise they use noteheads like us and sharps<br/>&gt; and flats (though they mean something slightly different). Would we<br/>&gt; write their scale in our notation or ours in theirs? Surely each would<br/>&gt; have developed *for their particular scale*. The notation symbol set is<br/>&gt; the same: sharps and flats, so there&apos;s your consistency.</p><p>Ah .. the idealism of youth. ;-) The thing is, we&apos;re on _this_ planet<br/>with its history of human and cultural evolution as given. In any<br/>case, I&apos;m not sure what you were trying to establish with the above<br/>thought-experiment. You might try again.</p><p>&gt; Worse in my<br/>&gt; opinion is the plethora of symbols used on the seven-nominal scale.</p><p>Well, with Sagittal, we&apos;ve got that plethora down to a very few<br/>symbols (8 up/down pairs) needed to notate zillions of the most common<br/>tunings: 9-limit JI plus odd-harmonics to 15, and about 50 of the most<br/>popular ETs under 100 (and many LTs although we have not spent much<br/>time on these so far).</p><p>And if 8 vertically-mirrored pairs still seems too many. I note that<br/>the symbol set has its own internal logic. All but one of them is<br/>constructed from only 4 simpler parts taken 1 or 2 at a time. And<br/>within this set of 8 symbol-pairs there&apos;s an even smaller set of 3<br/>pairs that does most of the work; those representing the 5 and 7<br/>commas and the 11 diesis, which should be familiar from the HEWM<br/>system for notating 72-ET.</p><p>&gt; One<br/>&gt; principle: generators and segments of them to determine nominals and<br/>&gt; accidentals. Fits all EDO scales. As for JI, the problem is more<br/>&gt; serious. I can&apos;t pretend to fit a notation to that. Even Partch<br/>&gt; couldn&apos;t.</p><p>Well I believe Sagittal does it. I believe George provided the key<br/>that made it manageable, with his proposal to construct arrow-like<br/>accidentals from a small number of simple components in a logical manner.</p><p>In my opinion, notating JI is the key to notating everything else.</p><p>&gt; Mark (hoping he&apos;s rocked the boat in the nicest possible way)</p><p>There&apos;s not much of a boat to rock. We&apos;re mostly floundering in an<br/>open sea. But I do hope the Sagittal system is some kind of raft we<br/>can cling to, and maybe build on.</p><p>The camera-ready copy of our introductory Sagittal article has been<br/>mailed off to John Chalmers for publication in Xenharmonikon 18,<br/>hopefully early in the new year.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=50362 href="#50362">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/2003 6:52:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:<br/>&gt; By the way, Erv Wilson has a fascinating interlocking system of<br/>&gt; nominals for the most common (fifth-generated) LTs in an article<br/>&gt; published in Xenharmonikon 3, 1975, &apos;On Linear Notations and the<br/>&gt; Bosanquet Keyboard&apos;.</p><p>Here it is:</p><p><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/xen3a.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/xen3a.PDF</a></p><p>When you&apos;ve digested that, then we can talk.</p></div><h3><a id=50366 href="#50366">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/2003 8:25:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21432.html#50345">/tuning/topicId_21432.html#50345</a></p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t want to appear obtuse, but it is my honest and clear<br/>opinion<br/>&gt; that fitting whatever scale you have at hand to the seven-nominal<br/>&gt; five-line stave is stupid.</p><p>***Well, Mark, I would try, first to get some performers who have not<br/>played microtonality before to tell you which they prefer.

As a *tuning*, 19-ET can be notated using only<br/>conventional sharps and flats (with 7 nominals); likewise, for a<br/>*meantone scale* which is a subset of 19-ET, the same notation would<br/>be the logical choice.</p><p>Now if you&apos;re notating a subset of 19-ET that uses a different<br/>generating interval (say a major or minor 3rd), then (following your<br/>logic above) you would most likely want a staff with a different<br/>number of nominals.  For the sake of *accuracy*, might you also want<br/>symbols other than conventional (single and double) sharps and flats,<br/>since these required accidentals may be nowhere near a &quot;semitone&quot; in<br/>size (not likely in 19, but there are other tunings, such as a<br/>Miracle MOS scale, where this would be the case; more about this<br/>below)?</p><p>Thus, for a single *tuning* you might have 2 or 3 different<br/>notations!  Suppose you switch *scales* within a composition<br/>(alternating between them from one measure to the next), then do you<br/>propose to switch notations (including staff configurations) that<br/>often?  Pity the poor performer!</p><p>The Sagittal notation that Dave Keenan and I have developed was<br/>intended to notate *tunings* rather than *scales*.  Granted there are<br/>some ET&apos;s (tunings) that do not work well with 7 nominals; for these<br/>we recommend that they be notated as subsets of larger ET&apos;s (e.g., 15<br/>as a subset of 60, or 16 as a subset of 48).</p><p>But suppose that you were to notate one of these using a different<br/>staff.  Earlier in the year Dave Keenan pointed out that, because we<br/>have such a generous assortment of new accidentals that keep the same<br/>harmonic meanings across all tunings, it would be possible to use<br/>some of these as accidentals (in lieu of sharps and flats) in<br/>situations where a non-conventional staff (having other than 7<br/>nominals) is employed, in which case the accidental could reflect the<br/>true nature (i.e., both approximate size and harmonic meaning) of the<br/>alterations in pitch required for the new staff.  While many<br/>performers might not wish to read something like this, certainly it<br/>would be valuable for purposes of studying new scales, and the new<br/>symbols would have the same meanings in other scale systems or<br/>tunings in which they might be used.</p><p>Does this make any sense?</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=50382 href="#50382">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2003 2:51:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Now if you&apos;re notating a subset of 19-ET that uses a different<br/>&gt;generating interval (say a major or minor 3rd), then (following your<br/>&gt;logic above) you would most likely want a staff with a different<br/>&gt;number of nominals.

But more usually a scale that uses pitches<br/>&gt;of 19-ET would be some subset of that tuning, e.g., a major or minor<br/>&gt;scale.</p><p>My point exactly!</p><p>&gt;And major and minor *scales* are not restricted to 19-ET, but<br/>&gt;may also be in other *tunings*, such as Pythagorean, meantone, 12-ET,<br/>&gt;31-ET, 55-ET, or a well temperament, to give a few examples.</p><p>That&apos;s right, but now look at the original context...</p><p>&gt;Thus, for a single *tuning* you might have 2 or 3 different<br/>&gt;notations!</p><p>...I guess what I really should have said is that you can&apos;t notate<br/>tunings.

How long do you think it would take to<br/>&gt;&gt; get fast with the Hs?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It isn&apos;t just the Hs. You have to learn new meanings for most of the<br/>&gt;others too, which will be forever clashing with their diatonic<br/>&gt;meanings that you then have to try to _un_learn.</p><p>One can easily know both if he/she practices them together.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Speaking for myself, 2-3 weeks, which is a<br/>&gt;&gt; very good lead time for a typical premiere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And how long do you think it would take to learn that E# and B# are<br/>&gt;the same as Fb and Cb respectively. A day? Maybe less depending what<br/>&gt;the instrument is.</p><p>Actually, to &quot;get fast&quot; with a new system of enharmonics, it would<br/>take me about as long.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Something new must be learned either way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes. However, I estimate the task of learning your notation to be<br/>&gt;at least 10 times that of learning the two enharmonics for the<br/>&gt;diatonic-based notation. Of course a lot depends on the instrument<br/>&gt;being played.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But these are mere expressions of opinion.</p><p>Maybe you&apos;ve come up with a way of learning this stuff I haven&apos;t<br/>thought of.  How long&apos;d it take you to get fast with diatonic<br/>notation?</p><p>&gt;I think your actual failure to notice your mistake in ratio-ing and<br/>&gt;naming your A D F chord says more than any of these.</p><p>Huh?  I hit 60 instead of 50?

Absent from this list are 6 and 10. 10 is of<br/>course the number of nominals in the decatonic system described in my<br/>papers, as well as in the quite different decimal system developed by<br/>others here in connection with Miracle temperament.</p><p>The next thing Wilson says is that he has yet to consider systems<br/>based instead on &quot;semi-fifths&quot; and &quot;semi-fourths&quot;. This would bring<br/>him a step closer to the general view of &quot;linear temperament&quot;<br/>espoused especially on the tuning-math list, and in this list&apos;s<br/>database, where one begins with the just lattice and then tempers out<br/>any reasonable smallish JI interval, or comma -- or in higher prime<br/>limits, some group thereof -- so as to yield a system where only one<br/>dimension (that which Carl and Graham and Mark and I propose notating<br/>with iterative application of an accidental drawn from a single pair,<br/>perhaps the convetional #/b) extends infinitely (not counting the<br/>octave dimension). In some cases (as in meantone, where 81/80 is<br/>tempered out; schsimic, where 32805/32768 is tempered out; and<br/>even &apos;pelogic&apos;, where 135/128 is tempered out) this leads to a<br/>generator that is roughly a &quot;fifth&quot;/&quot;fourth&quot;; in some cases we do<br/>get &quot;semi-fifths&quot;, in some cases we do get &quot;semi-fourths&quot;; but in<br/>other cases we get different generators entirely (such as the ~116.7<br/>cent &quot;secor&quot; for Miracle temperament); and some cases turn out, even<br/>when assuming octave-equivalence, to naturally have a period that is<br/>not 1 octave but rather . . ., 1/5 octave, 1/4 octave, 1/3 octave, or<br/>1/2 octave (the latter being the case for my decatonic temperaments),<br/>as exemplified in my recent post &quot;Grady, Monzo, Comma, Temperament&quot; --<br/> where all the examples mentioned happen to actually be<br/>understandable simply as multiple interlocking chains<br/>of &quot;fifths&quot;/&quot;fourths&quot;. All these types of &quot;linear temperament&quot; occur<br/>with equal &quot;naturalness&quot; qualitatively speaking.

If you make<br/>&gt; such adaptive 1 cent and occasional 2 cent adjustments to the<br/>notated<br/>&gt; pitches in your Blackjack chords, then even Johnny could not deny<br/>&gt; that you were composing in adaptive JI.</p><p>***Hi Paul,</p><p>Yes, this makes sense and, in fact, I had discussed this possibility<br/>with Johnny at one point (the idea of &quot;adjusting&quot; Blackjack with<br/>cents deviations to achieve JI).</p><p>I imagine, though, that one could question why one would use<br/>Blackjack at all in such a case, rather than devising some &quot;true&quot; JI<br/>system that would maintain even the linearities using the cents<br/>system...</p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=50733 href="#50733">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/2003 2:04:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, kraig grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Paul!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Viggo Bruns methods seems to be far better in picking these type &gt;<br/>(6 and 10) of structures and<br/>&gt; definately fills in some gaps that such methods as this chart seem<br/>&gt;to miss.</p><p>Of course there are many other such methods, including more general<br/>ones.

The generator varies gently as one moves along the line (I<br/>did not attempt to show this explicitly on the chart as it was<br/>already cluttered enough). For example, the meantone line, since it<br/>crosses the numbers 7, 12, and 19, implies MOSs of those<br/>cardinalities (and if you mouse-over &quot;zoom 1&quot;, you&apos;ll see it crosses<br/>2 and 5 as well). At the point where the generator is just the right<br/>size to close on itself, I put the number corresponding to the<br/>relevant ET. Now if you look at the diaschismic line, since it<br/>crosses the number 10, 12, and 22, you get MOSs* of those<br/>cardinalities. And so on. The chart also shows the quality of<br/>approximation of all the 5-limit consonances, but could be extended<br/>into higher dimensions to show higher-limit consonances, and then one<br/>would probably add more lines, such as for Miracle, etc.</p><p>*the latest from you is that some of these may not really be called<br/>MOSs, so the academic term &quot;distributionally even&quot; or DE scale would<br/>be better -- it means that each generic interval comes in no more<br/>than two specific sizes.</p><p>&gt; I will say that I don&apos;t like mixing greek and english alphabets,<br/>although right this minute, i<br/>&gt; could be talked into it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, kraig grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; All you have to do is ask Dave!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;  <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/xen3a.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/xen3a.PDF</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d like to comment on page 5 of this document.
