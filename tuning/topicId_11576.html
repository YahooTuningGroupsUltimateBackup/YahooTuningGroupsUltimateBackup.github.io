The ear produces combination tones of many<br/>different orders (e.g, 2a-b, 5a-3b, etc.) whose loudnesses as a (nonlinear)<br/>function of a and b have been very well measured (see, for example, Plomp&apos;s<br/>_Aspects of Tone Sensation_. For the most part, these causes of these<br/>combination tones are very well understood, resulting from the ear&apos;s<br/>nonlinear response to loud input stimuli (see, for example, the Feynman<br/>Lectures in Physics to see a derivation of how combination tones result from<br/>nonlinear response curves). However, there is no phenomenon (analogous or<br/>otherwise) that would produce the &quot;inverse differential&quot; tones.</p><p>Pierre, following up on Wim&apos;s remarks -- you should use your own ears,<br/>rather than just awaiting the consensus of others, to inform your<br/>theoretical speculations. To what extent have you done so?</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
