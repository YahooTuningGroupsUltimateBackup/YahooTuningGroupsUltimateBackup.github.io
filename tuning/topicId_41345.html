It seems that<br/>&gt;many here wish they would escape 12-ET but would keep diatonism and &gt;temperament way of thinking.<br/>&gt;Would you interpret that as a consequence of a such internalization?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;yes, i would say this is the consequence of fearing other &apos;places&apos; &gt;and what they might bring.  but, &gt;since they are perhaps unknown at that point, it is more the fear of &gt;leaving, or the inability to see<br/>&gt;beyond these internalized spaces -<br/>&gt;more and better explanation below  -- &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;4) I can hardly accept the term sensation in my vocabulary. On one &gt;hand, as far as I seek to track<br/>&gt;something that would be an elementary sensation, say the red &gt;sensation, I find relations, for instance<br/>&gt;the importance of the background / foreground, the cultural &gt;diversity of limits about the red category, etc.<br/>&gt;On the other hand, qualities appears always finest far from &gt;quantities and far from elementary level, as<br/>&gt;fused globality, like the face of things. So I see an elementary &gt;sensation as a regressive perception in<br/>&gt;artificial conditions of forced attention.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;what about the Red sensation, as seen in a particular room, a &gt;particular place, in the company of particular people,<br/>&gt;in a particular moment?  to say all red has the same sensation would &gt;be proposterous, but perhaps there is an<br/>&gt;argument to be made that in a given moment, the red sensation is &gt;playing a specific role in the larger sensation of the<br/>&gt;moment, that, if one trains oneself, can become a near certainlty &gt;as to what role it is playing, thus slowly revealing<br/>&gt;the nature of the &quot;red sensation&quot; through an understanding and &gt;dissection of it&apos;s synergies (the places where multiple<br/>&gt;forces meet).   &gt;<br/>&gt;i think you nail the question down by going here with it because it &gt;is indeed dependant upon a particular theory/experience<br/>&gt;of consciousness.  it seems in essence it is the question of whether &gt;there are relatively ordered layers to human/world consciousness<br/>&gt;that can be slowly ascended within in order to reach an &gt;understanding of &apos;red&apos; or not.  in this, there is room for the &gt;creation of<br/>&gt;culture, and the creation of rituals to invoke certain states, etc. &gt;that would not be in opposition -  for most cultures have a<br/>&gt;priest character, shaman, healer character, who is supposed to see &gt;these things clearly.  Often that person&apos;s perception would simply<br/>&gt;be taken as truth with a capital T.  maybe we have lost this in the &gt;West.  though maybe we treat alan greenspan this way :)  (maybe &gt;you&apos;re not<br/>&gt;american, i don&apos;t know).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;in any case, i don&apos;t claim to know beyond what i know for myself &gt;seems true, and for me, i would say that in a certain moment, a &gt;force is<br/>&gt;acting in a specific way.  to me, imagination is a process by which &gt;we construct images of spaces, sounds, etc, using the same sort of &gt;perception -<br/>&gt;making imagination a way of knowing, not a way of making.  to me, &gt;those with brilliant imaginations are generally people who perceive<br/>&gt;a great deal of clarity in things like sound, color, interactions &gt;between people.  it is not that they wouldn&apos;t be affected by the &gt;touch of a beautiful<br/>&gt;woman&apos;s knee (g-d knows we all would be!), but they might know the &gt;role that this particular force is interacting with the others &gt;around them, making<br/>&gt;the touch an element within a composition - and if isolated, an &gt;entire composition!  to me this is very very exciting, and &gt;attempting to improve these<br/>&gt;skills are what excites me about getting up in the morning, and what &gt;excites me about growing as a composer.  i see the two things as &gt;integral to<br/>&gt;each other.    i would never claim perfection, or near perfection in &gt;either department, but would strongly lay claim to the idea that you &gt;can get closer<br/>&gt;to this clarity - that i know just because if the ebbs and flows of &gt;my connection with it -  a hangover for instance, generally makes &gt;that sort of thing impossible :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;thanks for such a strong and thoughtful reply!,  this is turning &gt;into something very interesting  - - &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;5) A mental space is something relational. It&apos;s constructed with &gt;quality differences (and some concrete<br/>&gt;law of transformation of these differences) rather than qualities as such.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;i think i answer this above, but to me, i think of it is a state of &gt;experience of synergy between multitudes of forces .  all i am &gt;really saying is that through concentration<br/>&gt;and practice, and commitment to working on it, these synergies can &gt;be broken apart,  and one can start taking note of &quot;red&quot; every time &gt;one notices they are<br/>&gt;under the influence of it, and suddenly one begins to understand the &gt;force of red just a little bit, and with time it seems to become &gt;clearer.   the best painter i<br/>&gt;know would often speak of this sort of thing in terms of color and &gt;she had an incredible catalogue of interactions/synergies that she &gt;could draw upon for her<br/>&gt;work.   also, i think it is not unfair to make the argument that if &gt;one gains clarity on the forces that are internal to oneself and &gt;begins to understand how they  interact<br/>&gt;with the exterior world, the role exterior environments, sounds, &gt;colors, have in this mental space become much more tangible.   i see &gt;the viewpoint that these things<br/>&gt;are completely relational as a sort of modern disease that is mostly &gt;indicative of a lack of sensitivity, that perhaps the degree of &gt;stressful sensory input we have to<br/>&gt;swallow has brought upon us (among other more historical issues &gt;which are less clear to me). &gt;<br/>&gt;thanks for such a thoughtful response<br/>&gt;-micah<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--<br/>&gt;</p><p>Micah Silver<br/>--<br/>860.559.3456</p></div>
