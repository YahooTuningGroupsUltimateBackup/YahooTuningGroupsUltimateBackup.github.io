It is based on the multiplication of complex numbers that can be broken down to the equation a+bi, where a and b are &quot;real&quot; numbers (like you count on your fingers) and i is an imaginary number, usually referred to as the square root of -1.</p><p>Benoit Mandelbrot discovered this complex mathematical mess in the 1970&apos;s and fractals have lead to some seriously cool coding capabilities since.</p><p>But according to retired mathematics professor Bob Schipke, the Mandelbrot set seems to have originated with a monk named Udo of Aachen 700 *years* before Benoit started pooping in his pants. Although the very concept of imaginary numbers would take another 500 years to develop, Udo produced a Mandelbrot fractal in a nativity scene as the Star of Bethlehem which lead Schipke to investigate the monk&apos;s writings to uncover that this holy man discovered the magic of fractal geometry by continually multiplying numbers by themselves and then substituting complex numbers until he, too, arrived at the, um, Udo set.</p><p>Schipke published his findings in 1999, but only now is the news making the rounds.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; <a href="mailto:jonszanto@yahoo.com">jonszanto@yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=21167 href="#21167">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>4/16/2001 2:03:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon Szanto wrote:</p><p>&gt; List,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not wanting to build an entire aura based on negative postings, here is<br/>&gt; a mention (which I quote verbatim, and don&apos;t vouch for the<br/>&gt; descriptions) that I received today, and thought some here might find<br/>&gt; it of interest (or debunk?).
