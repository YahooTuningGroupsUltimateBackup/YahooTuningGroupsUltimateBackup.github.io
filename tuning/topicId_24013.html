I had the<br/>impression that he plotted the points on the consonance<br/>axis just by judging them, expressing his opinion<br/>as a consonance value (more important relative to the<br/>others rather than absolutely), and eyeballed a spline<br/>through the points.</p><p>Finding the harmonic spectrum best suited to his<br/>curve is interesting, but it might be more interesting<br/>to find a scale optimized for the actual spectra of<br/>his (inharmonic) instruments.  If analogies can be drawn<br/>with the levels of consonance of his 43 on the<br/>chromelodeon, you might be able to call it &quot;Partch&apos;s<br/>implied&quot; scale.  I think it would be interesting in<br/>any case, and I wonder what recasting his music in<br/>that tuning would sound like.</p><p>-m</p></div><h3><a id=24034 href="#24034">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2001 1:48:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., michaelsaunders7@h... wrote:</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s what I always thought, since it&apos;s the easiest<br/>&gt; of his instruments to experiment with (the only one<br/>&gt; with sustained, fixed pitches, I think).

But clearly Partch&apos;s text suggests that the splines are<br/>not to be taken at face value -- at all! See my posts from yesterday.</p></div>
