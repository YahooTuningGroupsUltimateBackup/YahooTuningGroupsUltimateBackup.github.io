The reversed-flat symbol commonly used for a quarter tone flat represents a comma flat in Turkish notation. Another issue is that composers and performers have different needs as far as notation goes.</p><p>&gt; Jacques told me ages ago to use the 12:13:15:17....format IE<br/>&gt; summarizing each scales as harmonic partials.  I would simply call<br/>&gt; the above scale a &quot;12th harmonic&quot; scale because the ratios in it can<br/>&gt; all be summarized as being x over the 12th harmonic. And, as such,<br/>&gt; diatonic JI would be an x/24 scale since it can be summarized (in<br/>&gt; most reduced form as) 24:27:30:32:36:40:45:48. Note that the &quot;x-th<br/>&gt; harmonic&quot; format gives a fairly good sense of how much periodicity<br/>&gt; and JI-compliance a scale has...but leaves roughness out of the<br/>&gt; equation.  An obvious example being the following scales A)<br/>&gt; 21:24:28:35 B) 21:25:26:35</p><p>So what would you do with the 7-limit tonality diamond, multiply all the ratios by 420? And that&apos;s a relatively small scale.</p><p>&gt; Note how scale B has it&apos;s smallest dyad at 25/26, which is much<br/>&gt; rougher than anything in scale B. So I propose this &quot;rating&quot; of the<br/>&gt; scale A) &quot;21st harmonic, 24/21 minimum&quot; B) &quot;21st harmonic, 26/25<br/>&gt; minimum&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now you might ask, what happens if something is de-tuned from or<br/>&gt; tempered off a harmonic series segment for whatever reason.</p><p>Or what if the ratios of the intervals between notes in the scale are significant, as in Erv Wilson&apos;s golden horograms?</p><p>&gt; I did a test and found about the smallest ratio the human ear can<br/>&gt; hear as having a different tonal color is about 41/40.....so if<br/>&gt; something can&apos;t fit within the &quot;40th harmonic&quot; I propose the<br/>&gt; following notation... &quot;merges near 35st harmonic, approximate 38/37<br/>&gt; minimum, exact notes of (list of notes as exact fractions)&quot; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;  If Just Intonation does one thing fairly well it gives us a quick<br/>&gt; way to look at fractions in a scale and take an educated guess at the<br/>&gt; levels of consonance we can obtain from it.

But this doesn&apos;t get rid of the need for calculation. Take for instance 8:9:10 vs. 36:40:45. What&apos;s the difference between these? It isn&apos;t immediately obvious that the interval between 8 and 10 is the same as between 36 and 45, and only the middle note is different, or that these are simply the same two step sizes in a different order.</p><p>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s my idea for making micro-tonality easier to notate or<br/>&gt; approach...what are yours (for different ones and/or improvements to<br/>&gt; the one stated)?</p><p>As a simplified notation, the 72-ET subset of Sagittal notation has some nice properties. For one, it&apos;s closely related to the standard notation for 12-ET, especially if you use the mixed-symbol version, and on the other hand, the symbols can be used to represent many common JI intervals. Then once you&apos;re familiar with 72-ET notation, it&apos;s not many steps from there to the Spartan subset of Sagittal, which works for many ET&apos;s and quite a few JI intervals.</p><p>But if you&apos;re already ignoring intervals smaller than 41/40 (42.7 cents), the 16.7 cent steps of 72-ET should be more than enough for a simplified notation.</p></div><h3><a id=86774 href="#86774">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2010 8:08:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 21 February 2010 18:32, jlmoriart &lt;JlMoriart@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; For example, this is possible on a one dimensional staff,<br/>&gt; using symbols (like accidentals) or alternate noteheads to<br/>&gt; represent the second dimension.

That&apos;s<br/>asserted but not demonstrated.  If you know the reason then you can<br/>enlighten me.  Whether it&apos;s easier than traditional notation is a<br/>matter of opinion.  Chromatic notations aren&apos;t new and they never took<br/>off for chromatic music, so why push them for microtonality?</p><p>Alternate noteheads for an extra dimension are a good idea.

The keyboard<br/>is all well and good.  But it looks plain wrong when it comes to rank<br/>2 temperaments in general.  He says rank 2 temperament will work with<br/>the ThumField.  In fact, it assumes 5 tones and 2 semitones to an<br/>octave, for suitable definitions of each interval.  That&apos;s a<br/>Pythagorean bias.  You can only map temperaments with a one to one<br/>mapping with Pythagorean intonation.  That is, temperaments where an<br/>octave and a fifth work together as the generators.  That is,<br/>meantone, schismatic, and mavila.  Chromatic notation throws out<br/>mavila.</p><p>Anyway, much as I support the general project (they pretty much agree<br/>with me, after all) I&apos;m unimpressed by this notation.</p><p>He doesn&apos;t mention jianpu, which I&apos;m a bit miffed about.  It&apos;s a<br/>movable-doh system, one of the world&apos;s main notation systems (up there<br/>with staff notation and guitar tablature), and western in origin (in<br/>so far as that matters).  It&apos;s also about the simplest system out<br/>there (hence the name).  If you&apos;re proposing something supposedly<br/>simple for musical education it&apos;s jianpu that&apos;s your competition.</p><p>There&apos;s an assertion that Andrew Milne &quot;was the first to recognize<br/>the relationship between the structure of isomorphic note layouts<br/>(such as the ThumField) and rank-2 regular temperaments &ndash; a<br/>significant insight for which I suggest he deserves widespread<br/>recognition.&quot;  Is there any evidence for this?  He&apos;s been sitting on<br/>the idea for a long time if it&apos;s true.  He doesn&apos;t mention it on his<br/>website whereas Erv Wilson published it in the 70s, along with a<br/>chromatic notation for meantone tied to a generalized keyboard.  If<br/>these were Mr Milne&apos;s ideas all along, it&apos;s time we set the record<br/>straight.</p><p>&gt; And a (revised!) presentation discussing the topic is here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JlMoriart/fundamentals-of-music-3177075">http://www.slideshare.net/JlMoriart/fundamentals-of-music-3177075</a></p><p>&quot;Flash Player 9 (or above) is needed to view presentations.&quot;</p><p>&gt; P.S.

They&apos;re more into the aesthetics of a chromatic notation, talking about colors and shapes, than they are about the actual theory behind the music which, in my opinion, should actually dictate the notation of music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@...m, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    There&apos;s just such a learning curve to micro-tonal theory...sometimes it makes me think &quot;no wonder people are scared away from it so easily.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;     I intend this thread to be about any possible ideas to simplify &quot;standard&quot; micro-tonal notation.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    Jacques told me ages ago to use the 12:13:15:17....format IE summarizing each scales as harmonic partials.  I would simply call the above scale a &quot;12th harmonic&quot; scale because the ratios in it can all be summarized as being x over the 12th harmonic.<br/>&gt; &gt;     And, as such, diatonic JI would be an x/24 scale since it can be summarized (in most reduced form as)<br/>&gt; &gt; 24:27:30:32:36:40:45:48.<br/>&gt; &gt;     Note that the &quot;x-th harmonic&quot; format gives a fairly good sense of how much periodicity and JI-compliance a scale has...but leaves roughness out of the equation.  An obvious example being the following scales<br/>&gt; &gt; A) 21:24:28:35<br/>&gt; &gt; B) 21:25:26:35<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;      Note how scale B has it&apos;s smallest dyad at 25/26, which is much rougher than anything in scale B.<br/>&gt; &gt; So I propose this &quot;rating&quot; of the scale<br/>&gt; &gt; A) &quot;21st harmonic, 24/21 minimum&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; B) &quot;21st harmonic, 26/25 minimum&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    Now you might ask, what happens if something is de-tuned from or tempered off a harmonic series segment for whatever reason.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   I did a test and found about the smallest ratio the human ear can hear as having a different tonal color is about 41/40.....so if something can&apos;t fit within the &quot;40th harmonic&quot; I propose the following notation...<br/>&gt; &gt;   &quot;merges near 35st harmonic, approximate 38/37 minimum, exact notes of (list of notes as exact fractions)&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt;    If Just Intonation does one thing fairly well it gives us a quick way to look at fractions in a scale and take an educated guess at the levels of consonance we can obtain from it.

Let&apos;s take a look at why interval names are so called in the first place:</p><p>They are derived from functions in the diatonic scale. Each general interval (except the unison and octaves) like second, third, etc, exists twice in the diatonic scale. The larger one gets the name major and the smaller one is called minor.</p><p>For example, in the C diatonic scale, there is a second that spans two semitones (excuse the use of semitones, they&apos;re so much easier to use than locations in a stack of fifths) from C-D, D-E, F-G, G-A, and A-B. There is also one than spans only one semitone, from E-F and B-C.<br/>So, the larger is called the major second and the smaller is called the minor.</p><p>The same applies to the third. There are two sizes in the diatonic scale that can function as thirds, the smaller size is labeled the minor and the larger is called the major.</p><p>This, in traditional theory, applies also to the sixth and seventh. *If* this interval naming pattern were to be continued *consistently*, it would apply to the fourth and fifth as well.</p><p>Notice how in the C major diatonic scale, there is still a small and large version of both the fourth and fifth. The large fourth occurs between F and B, the rest of the fourths in the diatonic scale are small, so our traditional &quot;perfect fourth&quot; *should* be the &quot;minor fourth&quot;, and our traditional &quot;augmented fourth&quot; *should* be the &quot;major fourth&quot;. In other words, the lydian mode makes use of the *major fourth*, and every other mode uses the minor one.</p><p>The small fifth occurs between B and F, and the rest of the fifths in the diatonic scale are the larger instance of the fifth, so our traditional &quot;perfect fifth&quot; *should* be called the &quot;major fifth&quot;, and our traditional &quot;diminished fifth&quot; *should* be called the &quot;minor fifth&quot;.

Today, nobody would fear the &quot;diabolous in musica&quot;, but this concept is relevant to understand old music.

That is a kind of comfort that brings no contribution (wealthy) to the musical culture.</p><p>Please excuse me the somewhat exaggerated comparison, but I think it is like denying the &quot;Holocaust&quot; or justifying terrorist wars on false claims of &quot;terrorism&quot;: an interpretation of the facts that is more favorable for some group is presented as an universal truth in a way which is inconsistent with the actual historical facts.</p><p>Of course, one can argue (as you did above) that the traditional classification can cause a similar --conservative-- effect; that is an issue I think should be addressed from a comprehensive perspective, comparing old and current pratices, and maybe speculating for new practices, but not just deleting names or concepts.</p><p>To avoid misunderstaning: I consider valid to question and to redefine musical concepts from a creative perspective, as an esthetical approach (namely, treating &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;aug/dim.&quot; intervals as similar, not opposing them as consonance versus dissonance); but I don&apos;t agree that personal poetics should affect elementary instruction on conventional concepts (names!) in a radical way.</p><p>In some moment, your pupils must learn the traditional interval classification, if they are going to be professional musicians.

In JIMS notation,<br/>alternate noteheads are used for seven of the chromatic locations to tell<br/>apart enharmonic equivalents (this giving you the 19 notes that JIMS uses at<br/>once for any given tonic), then arrows are used to notate transposition of<br/>the entire staff for when modulation occurs and the tonal center of the<br/>entire piece changes.</p><p>One reason chromatic staves are used is because they are simply more<br/>ergonomic; there is less inherent mental load to the system because for each<br/>location on the staff there are less possible notes possibly being<br/>represented:<br/>In traditional notation, any given staff location can represent an<br/>*infinite* number of notes through sharps and flats, though traditionally<br/>it&apos;s likely to represent one of maybe 5.<br/>With a chromatic staff using alternate noteheads a given staff location will<br/>only ever represent one or two notes.

If each enharmonic<br/>note were given a unique line or space, the intuitive one dimensional aspect<br/>of the staff locations corresponding to pitch would become void. Because Eb,<br/>depending on the tuning, maybe be higher than, lower than, or equivalent to<br/>D#, they must be put on the same line and differentiated between by some<br/>other means. Also, the chromatic scale is the scale over which there is no<br/>overlapping of function across the entire syntonic temperament. In other<br/>words, though Eb and D# overlap across the syntonic temperament, D and Eb<br/>will never cross. F# and Gb may cross each other, but F# will not cross over<br/>F.</p><p>&gt; Which system&apos;s easier is an opinion and will remain so until there are<br/>&gt; properly controlled studies establishing it.</p><p>I was more-so trying to avoid the counter-argument that there is no<br/>continuous load imposed on a user by any system, as long as he understands<br/>the system. This seems obviously wrong to me because I understand<br/>traditional notation but have a very hard time reading it, whereas I have<br/>far less experience with chromatic notation but find it immensely easier to<br/>read. I just wanted to point out that personal preference to a notation does<br/>not affect its actual definable difficulty in its imposed load on a user.</p><p>&gt; That existing, acoustic<br/>&gt; instruments require different fingerings for different scales is a<br/>&gt; fact.</p><p>Though true, the fact that instruments require different fingerings for each<br/>scale doesn&apos;t support, I don&apos;t think, that traditional notation is any<br/>more-so fit for standard instruments than chromatic notation. In fact, I<br/>think chromatic notations are necessary to reveal to a musician with such an<br/>instrument that in each key they are merely playing the same combinations of<br/>intervals. I&apos;ve played some (very little admittedly) chromatically notated<br/>music on my trumpet, and still found it easier to read, just like it was<br/>easier to read on my isomorphic keyboard.</p><p>For an interesting example, take any 12-edo instrument, isomorphic or not,<br/>and imagine reading a song from both diatonic and chromatic notation without<br/>regard to anything but staff position.

That&apos;s not much for microtonal work.</p><p>&gt; One reason chromatic staves are used is because they are<br/>&gt; simply more ergonomic; there is less inherent mental load to<br/>&gt; the system because for each location on the staff there are<br/>&gt; less possible notes possibly being represented:</p><p>But jianpu has all the notes in one location, so why doesn&apos;t that have<br/>an intolerable mental load?

No more than<br/>three if you have a 19 note limit.</p><p>&gt; With a chromatic staff using alternate noteheads a given staff location<br/>&gt; will only ever represent one or two notes. Less cognitive load.</p><p>But there are also more locations.  And the &quot;one or two&quot; is assuming<br/>your 19 note restriction.  Traditional notations work very well if you<br/>restrict the music to a 7 note gamut.</p><p>&gt; The more technichal reason that a chromatic staff is used<br/>&gt; (as opposed to an enharmonic staff with 19 staff locations which<br/>&gt; would give a unique staff location to each note that JIMS defines<br/>&gt; as functionally relevant to a given tonic) is that the enharmonic notes<br/>&gt; will sometimes be higher and sometimes be lower that their<br/>&gt; counterpart depending on the tuning.

They will for a schismatic temperament, which is one<br/>valid reason for using chromatic scales for microtonality, which the<br/>papers you cited don&apos;t mention.</p><p>It helps to define your &quot;entire syntonic temperament&quot; so that this is<br/>true.

It&apos;s easy to read<br/>but you have to learn each key separately.  That&apos;s always been the<br/>problem with movable-do systems.  It means your rule about not<br/>learning new fingerings only works for the isomorphic keyboard.  Which<br/>is great for the keyboard, but you could also use jianpu with it,<br/>which is a traditional notation.</p><p>&gt; For an interesting example, take any 12-edo instrument, isomorphic<br/>&gt; or not, and imagine reading a song from both diatonic and chromatic<br/>&gt; notation without regard to anything but staff position.
