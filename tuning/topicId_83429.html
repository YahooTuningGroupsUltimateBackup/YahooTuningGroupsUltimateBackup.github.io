Why are you so intent on<br/>arguing with people? Your scale sounds great. It can be used to make<br/>music that sounds good.

And I don&apos;t know if I<br/>agree with your hypotheses as to why your scale works, to be honest.<br/>Nonetheless, is the important thing here not to be making music?

And<br/>&gt; it still managed 4.5+ of 5 rating.<br/>&gt; And true, composition matters, but it&apos;s very rare someone can &quot;compose their<br/>&gt; way out&quot; into making an only decent scale sound beautiful...and I certainly<br/>&gt; am no Debussy so far as compositional skill.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;If it&apos;s so easy to use, then it&apos;s very limiting, and all works made<br/>&gt; from it will sound very similar.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;If all tones combinations sound sweet and nice, where are your<br/>&gt; &quot;different tonal colors&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll have to test against that assumption but, especially following from<br/>&gt; Mike B&apos;s statement that my PHI scales seem to have a huge degree of tonal<br/>&gt; color, I highly doubt that will be the case. I know easy to use often means<br/>&gt; less tonal color...such as it does in 5TET where it&apos;s virtually impossible<br/>&gt; to make very sour chords...but that&apos;s a very narrow 5-tone scale and this is<br/>&gt; a fully fledged 8-tone scale (an extra tone over diatonic).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot; Where&apos;s a potential to input some contrast in music if only consonance is<br/>&gt;&gt; there?&quot;<br/>&gt; Number of notes used, amplitude of certain notes....these can both be used<br/>&gt; to control the degree of tension. Not to mention rhythm and staccato, as<br/>&gt; always, can be used to build tension.<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;If there&apos;s some math in the way how scale (tuning) was created, then<br/>&gt; there&apos;s a possibility to derive from it also the other musical<br/>&gt; parameters necessary for composition.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You still have parameters, such as those mentioned above. And you still have<br/>&gt; the large palette of tonal colors. Only the whole &quot;math of finding non-sour<br/>&gt; chords&quot; problem is virtually eliminated so you can concentrate on other,<br/>&gt; often more exciting musical parameters instead.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;And why not to use pelog in chords? Yes, they will be out of tune, that&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; all. This is nothing wrong on it if composer wants it.&quot;<br/>&gt; There is nothing wrong with it.
