Usually, the term becomes &quot;linear temperament&quot;, because<br/>some members of the chain will get close to consonant intervals,<br/>as when four 3:2&apos;s get close to a 5:4 -- even though we haven&apos;t<br/>tempered the generator, if we treat the near-5:4 as a consonance<br/>musically, we&apos;ve &quot;tempered&quot; it.  All equal temperaments are<br/>linear temperaments when their step size is the generator, and<br/>also when the generator is made of a number of steps relatively<br/>prime with the et number (so prime ets like 17 and 19 are linear<br/>temperaments of all their intervals).  The subject of linear<br/>temperaments has been in the spotlight on the tuning-math list<br/>for some time.</p><p>Chains of two different generators are less explored... if they<br/>alternate, they can be viewed as a superposition of two chains<br/>of their sum offset by either of them.

 thanks.</p><p>well, by implicitly assuming that the period had to be equal to the<br/>interval of equivalence (the octave), daniel wolf looked at the mos<br/>possibilities of the &apos;4:3&apos; (actually 491 cents, or 9 steps in 22-<br/>equal) generator and only saw the 5-, 7-, 12-, and 17-tone ones.<br/>however, since 22 is not a prime number, it is possible to have the<br/>octave play the role of a *multiple* of the period -- in this case,<br/>*two* periods. so with a period of 600 cents (11 steps in 22-equal),<br/>the same generator produces mos scales with 5 or 6 notes per period,<br/>or 10 or 12 notes per octave (and this 12-tone mos is different from<br/>the one daniel found).</p><p>note that you don&apos;t need to start with the assumption of an non-prime<br/>equal temperament to &apos;organically&apos; end up with periods that are a<br/>fraction of an octave. for example, these latter 10 or 12 tone mos<br/>scales (possibly tuned differently, though not more than a few cents<br/>in any pitch) come up immediately once you specify that 50:49 and<br/>64:63 are to be tempered out.</p></div><h3><a id=34034 href="#34034">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2002 5:53:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; p.s. i tried, on tuning-math, to draw out of you the implications of<br/>&gt; *not* considering the octave as one of the generators, or a power of<br/>&gt; a generator, for a 2-dimensional (&apos;linear&apos;) temperament.</p><p>I thought I answered that, but there were two separate questions--one the octave or fraction thereof as a generator, and the other *scales* constructed so that they do or do not repeat at octaves.
