I *knew* you were going to ask for examples, Paul!  :)</p><p>Well, probably they&apos;re not 11-limit relationships, but other<br/>relationship in Blackjack &quot;substituting&quot; for 12-equal.</p><p>Soon, I&apos;m going to be in the process of translating my new Blackjack<br/>woodwind quintet into 72-tET notation, and when I do that, I will<br/>give you some examples of what I consider &quot;faux&quot; 12-tET.</p><p>Generally speaking, I try to &quot;sprechen sie Blackjack&quot; as it were, but<br/>sometimes I enjoy using a &quot;faux 12&quot; chord, &apos;cause I hear it...</p><p>Essentially, as you can guess, I mean chords that have some semblance<br/>of functional 12-equal harmony but which are &quot;faux&quot; or &quot;substitutes&quot;<br/>for that system and are only approximated in Blackjack.  But they<br/>have a weird charm.</p><p>More specific examples will come soon.  That will be fun.  Maybe I<br/>don&apos;t know what I&apos;m talking about, which might not be so much fun,<br/>but it *will* be fun straightening it all out...  :)</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2003 10:48:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; More specific examples will come soon.
