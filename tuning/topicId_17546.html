I am VERY<br/>surprised at the result!  The ideal tuning that I calculate is extremely<br/>close to 12-tET.</p><p>Perhaps, given the fact that the pieces ARE in all 24 keys, this seems<br/>only self-evident, or, at the very least, expected.  Yet I thought I had<br/>gathered from posts on this list (which I can&apos;t remember in detail at<br/>the moment), that Bach had tended to arpeggiate chords in the more<br/>distant keys, while stressing nice major thirds in the keys most favored<br/>by Well Temperaments in use at that time.</p><p>Instead, I find the following:</p><p>   12-tET Total          spring pain:     9599911.701<br/>   Werckmeister III      spring pain:    11581027.133<br/>   Kirnberger III Total  spring pain:    11879895.829<br/>   Thomas Young Total    spring pain:    10845223.537<br/>   COFT Total            spring pain:     9576719.049<br/>   After relaxing, Total spring pain:     4037621.105<br/>   Final vertical        spring pain:     1958782.615<br/>   Final horizontal      spring pain:      325804.112<br/>   Final grounding       spring pain:     1753034.378</p><p>All of the three Well Temperaments I threw at it are significantly<br/>worse than 12-tET, and my own COFT number is less than 1% better than<br/>12-tET.  The intervals are very evenly distributed in this set of<br/>pieces.  The COFT tuning values themselves that I calculate range from<br/>a high of +0.8 cents more than 12-tET for A, down to a low of 0.5 cents<br/>below 12-tET for F.  We&apos;re talking minuscule deviations from 12-tET<br/>here!</p><p>I do not claim, of course, that these results imply that Bach used<br/>12-tET.  Still, it seems surprising to me, if he had a Well Temperament<br/>under his hands as he wrote these pieces, that he didn&apos;t skew his chord<br/>selection at all (as far as I can tell) in a way that would make<br/>favorable use of its qualities to tend toward JI.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=17550 href="#17550">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;joseph@composersconcordance.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2001 6:21:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I suddenly became intensely curious about what tuning might best fit<br/>&gt; the entire set of Bach&apos;s &quot;Well Tempered Clavier&quot;, Book I.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, I went up to <a href="http://prs.net">prs.net</a> and pulled down John Sankey&apos;s complete set,<br/>&gt; concatenated all 24 of them together, and fed the result to my<br/>program<br/>&gt; for a 5-limit Calculated Optimum Fixed Tuning analysis.

I&apos;ll see what I can dig up<br/>regarding past analyses of Bach&apos;s WTC in the next couple of days (or<br/>this weekend at the latest).  I do have a fair degree of confidence in<br/>my routines&apos; COFT analysis, but it&apos;d be dumb to claim I&apos;m certain of my<br/>results.</p><p>If anybody has in front of them one of the twelve major thirds which<br/>past analysis has shown to be underrepresented in the WTC, I could pull<br/>out an analysis of the presence of this third in each of the 24 parts.<br/>Etc.  Sometimes verifying methods (or proving them wrong) is not easy,<br/>but choosing some specific focus can help.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=17602 href="#17602">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2001 10:57:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;Thanks Paul, Joe, and Manuel, for the refs.
