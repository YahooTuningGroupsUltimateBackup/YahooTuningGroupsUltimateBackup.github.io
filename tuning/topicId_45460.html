other synths as well...</p><p>this thread began over the weekend, while you<br/>were away from the list.</p><p>yes, in fact, the resolution you give here for<br/>the TX81Z, and the statement that it&apos;s &quot;pretty<br/>common&quot;, has been under much discussion over<br/>the last few days.</p><p>this resolution, which actually is exactly<br/>1.5625 = 1 &amp; 9/16 cents, is 768edo.  it is<br/>indeed the tuning resolution on a vast number<br/>of pieces of MIDI hardware, including my own<br/>soundcard, as i just found out yesterday.</p><p>this resolution is the result of using 6 bits<br/>of data per 12edo semitone.</p><p>i have proposed 768edo as a MIDI _de facto_<br/>tuning standard because the vast majority of<br/>MIDI instruments tune to a resolution of one<br/>byte of tuning data, ignoring the other byte<br/>of the 2-byte pitch-bend data word.</p><p>this byte (8 bits) uses its most significant<br/>digit, which represents 2^7 = 128, set to 0<br/>to indicate to the hardware that this is a<br/>data byte.</p><p>likewise, in MIDI, all status bytes (which are<br/>the actual commands, i.e. &quot;pitch-bend&quot;, &quot;note-on&quot;,<br/>&quot;control change&quot;, etc.) have the most significant<br/>bit set to 1, to indicate to the hardware that<br/>this is a status byte.</p><p>therefore, because one bit is being used as<br/>a status/data flag, there are only 7 bits available<br/>for use as the actual data of the pitch-bend<br/>command.</p><p>for example, here&apos;s a command to send a pitch-bend<br/>to channel 1 :</p><p>128 64 32 16   8  4  2  1  =  decimal value of bit<br/>  1  1  1  0   0  0  0  0  =  binary value of bit</p><p>because the first bit is 1, that tells the hardware<br/>that this is a status byte and not data.</p><p>the next 3 bits specify exactly which type of<br/>command this is.  in this case, the 1 1 0 are<br/>defined as a pitch-bend command.</p><p>the last 4 bits specify the MIDI channel number.<br/>internally the channels are stored as 0 to 15,<br/>but humans (and software used by humans)<br/>generally translate that to 1 to 16.  in this<br/>particular example, all the bits are zero, so<br/>that&apos;s MIDI channel 1.</p><p>if for some reason someone needs to know the<br/>decimal equivalents of these bits, a whole byte<br/>is usually converted to decimal number. the<br/>decimal value for my example here is 224, which<br/>is the first number which specifies a pitch-bend.</p><p>239 is the last decimal number which specifies a<br/>pitch-bend, since it designates a pitch-bend<br/>on channel 16, thus:</p><p>128 64 32 16   8  4  2  1  =  decimal value of bit<br/>  1  1  1  0   1  1  1  1  =  binary value of bit</p><p>the first nibble (4 bits) is the same as before:<br/>a status bit and 3 bits specifying that status as<br/>&quot;pitch-bend&quot;.</p><p>the final nibble, with all 4 bits set to 1, is<br/>at its highest value, which equals 15.  this<br/>translates into MIDI channel 16, the maximum<br/>number of MIDI channels available.  now you<br/>know why there&apos;s a limitation to 16 channels<br/>in MIDI.</p><p>now, after a status byte containing a pitch-bend<br/>command, the hardware expects 2 data bytes to follow.<br/>together they make up the MIDI &quot;data word&quot;.</p><p>however, most hardware actually ignores the LSB<br/>(least significant byte, i.e., the one with the<br/>lower numerical value).  this, in effect, truncates<br/>any high-resolution MIDI pitch-bend data by dividing<br/>it by whatever power of 2 makes the difference between<br/>it and the truncated value (this divisor is typically 64),<br/>and then lopping off the decimal part, thus giving<br/>64 units per semitone.</p><p>now you&apos;re in a position to understand what i wrote here:<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_45398.html#45412">/tuning/topicId_45398.html#45412</a></p><p>which actually explains how the truncation of the<br/>tuning data operates.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=45464 href="#45464">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/2003 7:41:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
