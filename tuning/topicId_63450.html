It was great meeting you too.</p><p>Chris thinks of himself more as a &quot;53-ist&quot; than a<br/>&quot;microtonalist&quot;, since 53-ET is the tuning in which<br/>he is specifically interested, as a temperament of JI.</p><p>He kept wanting me to show him Tonescape lattices of<br/>53-edo as a temperament of 7-limit JI, and it *is*<br/>significantly better at approximating ratios-of-7 than<br/>12-edo is, but it really excels at 5-limit JI so that&apos;s<br/>mostly what i showed him ... besides, when the dimensionality<br/>of the lattice goes beyond 3 dimensions, Tonescape&apos;s<br/>&quot;Geometry|Closed Curved&quot; menu choice results in a shape<br/>which i think doesn&apos;t particularly convey much useful<br/>information -- where this menu choice *does* work beautifully<br/>is when the JI space is 2-dimensional, then you can see<br/>the helix, torus, etc., which results from the tempering.</p><p>Anyway, it was terrific to meet Chris and his lovely wife<br/>Karen, and Chris even came back by himself on Sunday, armed<br/>with his hand-drawn 53-edo &quot;circles-of-5ths&quot; diagrams, which<br/>reminded me of the earliest microtonal research i did:<br/>calculating transpositions of Partch&apos;s 29-tone 11-limit<br/>Tonality Diamond using all 29 of the notes as a &quot;local 1/1&quot;<br/>... and in those days, i did all the calculations with a<br/>pen and paper, not even a calculator (let alone a computer).</p><p>And of course, the MahlerFest itself was a total blast,<br/>concluding with an *outstanding* performance of the Mahler<br/>warhorse: his 1st Symphony ... but that&apos;s a topic for a<br/>different Yahoo list:</p><p><a href="/mahler/">/mahler/</a></p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
