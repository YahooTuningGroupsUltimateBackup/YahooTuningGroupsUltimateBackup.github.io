If you could group<br/>&gt;them by general category that would be best.</p><p>Here&apos;s something may help (recent discovery).</p><p>You can search Monz&apos;s site in Google by adding site:ixpres.com at the end.<br/>E.g.<br/>&quot;comma iv  site:ixpres.com&quot;<br/>which turns the page up as first entry.</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/i-iv-v7-i/i-iv-v-i.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/i-iv-v7-i/i-iv-v-i.htm</a></p><p>while &quot;comma iv&quot; doesn&apos;t even have it on the first page. I suppose<br/>there are lots of meanings of the word &quot;comma&quot;!</p><p>There are other web pages on <a href="http://ixpress.com">ixpress.com</a>, which sometimes turn up in the<br/>results, but usually most of the pages are from your site!<br/>At least, if the search phrase contains any terms in use for microtonal<br/>music.</p><p>You can also make a google search page which does this automatically.</p><p>I remember you asked about it before - just found out that google has one,<br/>and ot is easy to do.</p><p><a href="http://www.google.com/services/free.html">http://www.google.com/services/free.html</a></p><p>Only lets one refine the search to the domain, not a directory in the<br/>domain - version for my own site searches the whole of nbci, but<br/>is also useful if one wants to do that.<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/searches/google_search.htm">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/searches/google_search.htm</a></p><p>I also did one to search your site:<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/searches/monz_google_search.htm">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/searches/monz_google_search.htm</a></p><p>However, it is also easy to add site:ixpress.com to the search field<br/>as well, once one knows to do that, so I don&apos;t expect to use it<br/>much.</p><p>Interesting page of tunings of the progression. Maybe I wasn&apos;t<br/>on the list at the time as I&apos;m sure I&apos;d have remembered it.</p><p>I find the 8/9 j.i. 7th gives a far more decisive resolution<br/>while the 9/10 one gives a more harmonious chord<br/>which one notices especially in longer passages as in<br/>the C.P.E. Bach that John deLaubenfels has adaptively tuned for me.</p><p>This clip shows that well, and one can see why it is,<br/>because of the 4/3 to the 1/1.</p><p>If the dominant seventh has no fifth in it (in the C.P.E. Bach) then<br/>the 8/9 is about as harmonious as the 9/10 and one gets<br/>the best of both worlds if enough of those types of dom7ths are used.</p><p>John has posted about his new method for adaptively tuning<br/>dom7th so that if it has a fifth it is 9/10, and if no fifth, 8/9,<br/>on the math-tuning list<br/><a href="/tuning-math/message/128">/tuning-math/message/128</a></p><p>The 7 limit one is also harmonious but not<br/>so decisive.</p><p>The quarter comma meantone one is rather interesting. Seems to<br/>have less of a sense of return to it, almost like<br/>one has moved somewhere else as a result of the<br/>progression, especially when one hears it in<br/>comparison with the others with a strong sense of return.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=25075 href="#25075">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2001 9:33:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s something may help (recent discovery).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can search Monz&apos;s site in Google by adding site:ixpres.com at<br/>the end.</p><p>Something I&apos;ve found infinitely useable, available on the Google<br/>site, is their Google Toolbar.
