I won&apos;t back<br/>out if no one else volunteers, but let&apos;s give others a chance to step<br/>forward.  Joe, I understand you to mean that _lack_ of formal music<br/>education is no obstacle, and perhaps that&apos;s true, within limits,<br/>especially if FAQ entries are subject to the scrutiny of the many list<br/>members who know a shootload more than I do about so much of music<br/>history and practice.</p><p>&gt;And, Robert Walker as &quot;technical supervisor&quot; with the new Web-tree<br/>&gt;method... &quot;bells and whistles&quot; galore!</p><p>I get dizzy just reading Robert&apos;s posts on the subject, but will try<br/>to understand more of what he&apos;s saying by going to his example place.<br/>Robert, you don&apos;t want to volunteer to be FAQ-man?</p><p>&gt;Yes??  Do we need a full vote??  I rather doubt it, unless there is<br/>&gt;some serious objection since, I believe there is only ONE candidate<br/>&gt;running for office!!!!</p><p>&gt;Conscientious objectors please step forward!</p><p>Yeah, it&apos;s not too late to object, everyone!  BTW, I&apos;ll be out of town<br/>all next week, but this is a project that&apos;ll take much longer than a<br/>week to get even into first functional draft mode, much less polish.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=19613 href="#19613">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/1/2001 1:46:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_19609.html#19609">/tuning/topicId_19609.html#19609</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeeeeeow: what that me who said I&apos;d do it this morning?

I, personally,  see it as a much longer-range<br/>project.  No... not meaning more work for you, but more as a<br/>long-range &quot;topic discussion&quot; on the list that will &quot;crystallize&quot;<br/>gradually into a finalized entry.  It can grow, gradually, entry by<br/>entry.  In fact, THAT part will be the &quot;fun&quot; of it...  It can be<br/>something going on in the &quot;background&quot; so to speak...</p><p>It will grow page by page, just like the HTML trees themselves!  If<br/>we<br/>don&apos;t &quot;rush&quot; we can really have something nice, and some great<br/>discussion to boot(up)!</p><p>________ _______ _______ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
