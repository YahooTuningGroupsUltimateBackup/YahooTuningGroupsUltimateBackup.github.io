I just see two cranks who got &apos;obsessed&apos;<br/>with their own half-baked method for a number of years without ever<br/>bothering to look at historical sources on music or mathematics or<br/>architecture.</p><p>&quot;The symbolism in Rosslyn is reaching back to times of a civilisation<br/>that is lost to us now that had sciences that are the roots of all the<br/>mechanics of the universe,&quot; says Mitchell.</p><p>Doesn&apos;t he know any medieval history?</p><p>They think &apos;knowledge of harmonics&apos; was suppressed by the Church?

The effects are fairly<br/>dramatic: playing the two tones that comprise the augmented fourth<br/>produces another two separate notes, as though the effect was a design<br/>feature of the stonework.&quot;</p><p>Hmmm... something fishy going on here.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/6605767.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/6605767.stm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a story that was first on BBC a couple of years ago, and<br/>&gt; today they are giving more details + audio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Charles Lucy lucy@...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -----<br/>&gt;</p></div>
