Two 29-et keyboards separated by this comma should work very nicely.</p><p>Yes!  I&apos;ve got it on my ZTar with 29-equal running down the neck, and the strings tuned to neutral thirds.  It works, but it&apos;s cumbersome so I haven&apos;t got much to show for it yet.</p><p>The best reason I&apos;ve found for using 13-limit harmony is to get 8:11:13 chords.  They share some rare properties that may be important with 4:5:6.  And they sound okay.  The mapping can be optimised for them by having whole tones (5 steps of 29-equal) down the neck instead of single steps.  That leaves neutral third scales as compact structures.  It seems to work melodically, but needs some more tinkering to be useful, because the notes you want are only on one part of the neck.  It still gives the 3-approximation, but 5 and 7 are more remote.</p><p>                       Graham</p></div><h3><a id=41318 href="#41318">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/2002 11:27:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Graham Breed &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [[1, 0, -31, -21, -14, -9], [0, 1, 21, 15, 11, 8]] [1200., 1904.391710]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; rms 6.209025908 comp 11.46080276 graham 21<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; bad 240.9051197 grabad 597.5199555<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; mos [12, 17, 29, 46, 63]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This has a fifth of 704.39, which is right in Margo&apos;s range.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s this &quot;grabad&quot; supposed to be?</p><p>Err, would you believe rms error times 21^(3/2)?</p><p>&gt; &gt; [[2, 0, 11, 31, 45, 55], [0, 1, -2, -8, -12, -15]] [600.0000000, 1903.786589]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; rms 2.880707578 comp 19.68247952 graham 34<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; bad 251.5468524 grabad 571.1070885<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; mos [10, 12, 22, 34, 46, 58]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This has two chains of fifths of size 703.79 cents, separated by a half-octave, so it is readily adaptable to a double keyboard setup.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s the 13-limit diaschismic.</p><p>That&apos;s what I&apos;d call it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; [[29, 46, 0, 14, 33, 40], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]] [41.37931034, 2788.239580]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; rms 2.277983567 comp 22.46330341 graham 29<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; bad 242.5275176 grabad 355.7521911<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; mos [58, 87]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s Mystery.</p><p>Mystery?
