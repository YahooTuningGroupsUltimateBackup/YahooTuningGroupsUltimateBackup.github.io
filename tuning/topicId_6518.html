This is vividly portrayed on my list<br/> now.  It&apos;s also made obvious that during the 1920s and 1930s the<br/> vast majority of his work was in 24-tET. &gt;&gt;</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t read too much into this -- he was simply more enthusiastic during<br/>his youth about the quartertone project, and like many younger composers, he<br/>was able to compose with impressive fluency.</p><p>The drop-off also coincided with his deeper engagement with the<br/>Anthroposophical movement, which left him rather isolated under both<br/>nationlist and socialist Czechoslovakian states.  Nevertheless, under the<br/>latter, he did receive performances, recordings, and publications despite his<br/>distance to socialist realism.</p></div>
