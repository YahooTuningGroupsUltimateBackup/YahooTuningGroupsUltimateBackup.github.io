It is, at this point, a<br/>dyadid discordance measure, which certainly conforms to Pierre Lamothe&apos;s<br/>partial ordering for simple ratios, but is a realistic, continuous function<br/>that is well-defined for all intervals, simple ratios or otherwise. For this<br/>exercise, I used a Farey series of order N=100 and an auditory resolution of<br/>1%. Within the first two octaves, the resulting harmonic entropy curve shows<br/>significant local minima at the ratios 5:6, 4:5, 7:9, 3:4, 7:5, 2:3, 5:8,<br/>5:3, 4:7, 1:2, 4:9, 3:7, 2:5, 3:8, 4:11, 1:3, 3:10, 2:7, 3:11, as well as<br/>hints of minima at 7:8, 6:7, 5:12, 5:13, 2:15, and 1026&cent; (the last one<br/>results from being less than 1% from two different simple ratios -- 5:9<br/>below, and 11:6 above). I&apos;ll make a graph of this curve available soon.</p><p>Anyway, I calculated the total pairwise harmonic entropy for about 8 million<br/>tetrads, allowing each of the 3 intervals between adjacent notes to vary<br/>between 150&cent; and 550&cent; in 2&cent; increments. By &quot;total pairwise harmonic entropy&quot;<br/>I mean I added the six harmonic entropy values for the six possible pairs of<br/>notes found within the tetrad. As I&apos;ve mentioned before, this ignores<br/>effects that arise from the synergy of three or more notes. I found 140<br/>tetrads that were local minima (i.e., changing one, two, or three notes by<br/>2&cent; would necessarily increase the total pairwise harmonic entropy), and<br/>ranked them according to total pairwise harmonic entropy (call it<br/>discordance, since that&apos;s what it&apos;s a crude model of). Going from lowest<br/>(most concordant) up the list:</p><p>First there were a bunch of chords which were really triads with the lower<br/>note doubled an octave higher.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrad was:<br/>0          498          886         1384&cent;<br/>or 9:12:15:20 or 1/1:4/3:5/3:20/9. It is an open-voiced JI minor seventh<br/>chord in third inversion, or an open-voiced JI major added sixth chord in<br/>second inversion. So, in a sense, Margo agrees with this model (note,<br/>HOWEVER, caveat in second-to-last paragraph below) that this &quot;added sixth&quot;<br/>chord is the most concordant tetrad with distinct pitch classes, though<br/>perhaps not in the voicing she would have suggested (of course, had I<br/>increased the upper bound for adjacent intervals, some other inversion of<br/>this chord, or some other chord, might have come out as most concordant).</p><p>The next most concordant tetrad was one that George Kahrimanis brought up<br/>recently, and Margo and I have brought up in the past:<br/>0          492          980         1472&cent;<br/>It is the &quot;stack of fourths&quot; chord where the fourths are tempered narrow so<br/>that the outer interval approaches 3:7, and the bass-alto and tenor-soprano<br/>intervals approach 4:7. To the 2&cent; accuracy of the calculation, this is the<br/>same as the 22-tET tuning of the &quot;stack of fourths&quot;. This clearly shows that<br/>the relationship between concordance and JI is quite different when dealing<br/>with dyads vs. dealing with larger chords, even when the model only takes<br/>dyadic discordance, with local minima at JI ratios, into account. Also,<br/>since the triadic analogue to this calculation showed a local minimum at 0<br/>498 996&cent;, this model agrees with George K. that while a stack of two fourths<br/>sounds best pure, a stack of three fourths can be improved with some<br/>temperament.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrad was the JI major seventh chord, 0 386 702<br/>1088&cent; or 8:10:12:15 or 1/1:5/4:3/2:15/8.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrads were (tied)<br/>0          502         1002         1390&cent;<br/> and<br/>0          388          888         1390&cent;<br/>which have their fourths and major thirds tempered a bit wide, as in a very<br/>mild meantone. The first one is the &quot;Carole King&quot; chord, the second is an<br/>add6, add9 (6/9) chord with no 5th, in typical jazz fashion. Relative to<br/>what would seem ideal just tunings of 9:12:16:20 (1/1:4/3:16/9:20/9) and<br/>36:45:60:80 (1/1:5/4:5/3:20/9), respectively, the intervals are expanded a<br/>bit, probably to bring the outer 9:20 closer to the much more concordant<br/>4:9.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrad was the JI minor seventh chord, 0 316 702<br/>1018&cent; or 10:12:15:18 or 1/1:6/5:3/2:9/5.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrads were (tied) the second-inversion JI major<br/>triad with the fourth in the bass, 0 204 702 1088&cent; or 8:9:12:15 or<br/>1/1:9/8:3/2:15/8, and the first-inversion JI minor triad with the ninth on<br/>top, 0 386 884 1088&cent; or 24:30:40:45 or 1/1:5/4:5/3:15/8.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrad was a surprise -- a very modern &quot;augmented<br/>octave&quot; chord, 0 388 886 1274&cent; or 12:15:20:25 or 1/1:5/4:5/3:25/12. It<br/>contains two 4:5s, two 3:5s, and one 3:4s, all concordant enough to<br/>counteract the great discordance of the 12:25.</p><p>While the usual, 5-prime-limit JI minor seventh chord has appeared in two<br/>different voicings so far in our list, at this point the next most<br/>concordant tetrad was the other JI minor seventh chord discussed at<br/><a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/erlichs.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/erlichs.htm</a>, 0 268 702 970&cent; or 12:14:18:21 or<br/>1/1:7/6:3/2:7/4.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrads (tied) were<br/>0          318          818         1320&cent;<br/> and<br/>0          502         1002         1320&cent;<br/>obtained by stacking a minor third and two fourths, or two fourths and a<br/>minor third. In JI, these would be 15:18:24:32 (1/1:6/5:8/5:32/15) and<br/>45:60:80:96 (1/1:4/3:16/9:32/15), respectively, but the intervals are<br/>expanded a touch, probably to help alleviate the sharp discordance of the<br/>outer interval.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrads (tied) are Margo&apos;s vote the JI added sixth,<br/>0 388 702 886&cent; or 12:15:18:20 or 1/1:5/4:3/2:5/3, and its second inversion 0<br/>184 498 886&cent; or 10:12:15:18 or 1/1:10/9:4/3:5/3.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrads (tied) were<br/>0          434          820         1320&cent;<br/> and<br/>0          500          886         1320&cent;<br/>which exploit the fact that a 7:9 stacked with a 4:5 very nearly produces a<br/>5:8 (exploiting the 225:224 comma), and add a 3:4 on either the low end or<br/>the high end (the 3:4 is adjacent to the 4:5, producing a 3:5).</p><p>The next most concordant tetrads (tied) were<br/>0          302          502         1004&cent;<br/> and<br/>0          502          702         1004&cent;<br/>which are two of the ways a stack of fourths can be transposed to within one<br/>octave. A slight meantone-like tempering of the fourths is evident, in order<br/>to bring the 27:32 closer to a more concordant 5:6.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrads (tied) were the first-inversion JI major<br/>triad with the ninth on top, 0 318 816 1020&cent; or 5:6:8:9 or 1/1:6/5:8/5:9/5,<br/>and the second-inversion JI minor triad with the fourth in the bass, 0 204<br/>702 1020&cent; or 40:45:60:72 or 1/1:9/8:3/2:9/5.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrads (tied) were also of the augmented octave<br/>type,<br/>0          498          888         1282&cent;<br/>0          394          784         1282&cent;<br/>where the 3:4 is attached to either the low end or the high end of a stack<br/>of two 4:5s (each slightly stretched to alleviate the discordance of the<br/>25:16), producing a 3:5.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrads (tied) exploit the fact that a major third<br/>plus two fifths is very nearly a 5:7 (i.e., exploiting the 225:224 &quot;comma&quot;):<br/>0          384          588         1086<br/>0          498          702         1086<br/>The major third is compressed a bit to make this tempering magic happen.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrad is an open-voiced third-inversion major<br/>seventh chord,<br/>0          500          816         1316&cent;<br/>which would be 15:20:24:32 or 1/1:4/3:8/5:32/15 in JI, but the fourths are<br/>expanded a touch, probably to help alleviate the sharp discordance of the<br/>outer interval.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrads (tied) are the JI major 7 (#5) chord, 0 388<br/>776 1090&cent; or 16:20:25:30 or 1/1:5/4:25/16:15/8, and the JI minor (maj7)<br/>chord.       0 314 702 1090&cent; or 40:48:60:75 or 1/1:6/5:3/2:15/8.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrads (tied) are the second-inversion JI major<br/>triad with ninth on top, 0 498 702 886&cent; or 6:8:9:10 or 1/1:4/3:3/2:5/3, and<br/>the first-inversion JI minor triad with the fourth in the bass, 0 184 388<br/>886&cent; or 36:40:45:60 or 1/1:10/9:5/4:5/3.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrad is<br/>0          442          884         1326<br/>which stacks three 442-cent intervals, each of which approximates 7:9 from<br/>the high side, and each pair of which approximates 3:5 very closely. In<br/>other words, an equal division of the 3:5!</p><p>The next most concordant tetrads (tied) are a major triad with 5-prime-limit<br/>minor seventh in the bass, 0 186 576 888&cent; or 18:20:25:30 or<br/>1/1:10/9:25/18:5/3, and a JI minor triad with 5-limit major sixth on top, 0<br/>312 702 888&cent; or 30:36:45:50 or 1/1:6/5:3/2:5/3. The 18:25s in these chords<br/>are actually expanded relative to JI, to help them approximate the<br/>concordant 5:7. These are thus pretty close to inversions of the 7-odd-limit<br/>tetrads, but the major sixth between the outer voices is clearly 3:5 and not<br/>7:12, and in fact the 7-limit versions do not show up as local minima of<br/>their own.</p><p>The next most concordant tetrads (tied) are the &quot;root position&quot; 7-odd-limit<br/>tetrads, the otonal 0 388 702 970&cent; or 4:5:6:7 or 1/1:5/4:3/2:7/4, and the<br/>utonal 0 268 582 970&cent; or 60:70:84:105 or 1/1:7/6:7/5:7/4. Although for the<br/>purposes of my 22-tET paper, and Pierre&apos;s recent post, it might have been<br/>nice if these appeared on top of the list, they didn&apos;t. (HOWEVER: the order<br/>here is pretty arbitrary. The Farey-series-based harmonic entropy curve<br/>greatly favors large intervals over small ones, and no open voicings of<br/>these chords had an opportunity to make it into the comparison, since I<br/>limited the adjacent intervals to be under 550&cent;. Voicings such as 0 702 970<br/>1588 and 0 618 886 1588 would handily defeat all the chords listed above,<br/>while even 0 498 886 1468 and 0 582 970 1468 would have come out ahead of<br/>the major seventh chord above. Other formulations of the model, though they<br/>might completely change the order, would have very little effect on _what_<br/>these local minima are, so that&apos;s what&apos;s important here). Experientially<br/>speaking, I&apos;m not too opposed to the ranking as regards the utonal 7-limit<br/>tetrad, while the otonal 7-limit tetrad is clearly more concordant than this<br/>ranking implies, which reflects the fact that this model ignores synergies<br/>between three or more notes. A true triadic or tetradic harmonic entropy<br/>model (rather than a sum of dyadic harmonic entropy models, which is what<br/>this is) would take this into account.</p><p>I stop here. If anyone wants the full list of 140 local minima (cents only),<br/>I&apos;ll e-mail it to them. One could spend a considerable period of time just<br/>listening to the chords above, and tweaking the notes one by one to see how<br/>the particular tuning (just or tempered) is a local optimum for that chord.<br/>Many of the chords above come from a standard application of 5-limit JI to<br/>tetrads found in the diatonic scale (including melodic minor and harmonic<br/>minor variants), but many are tempered in a subtle way, and some are<br/>downright xenharmonic. An excellent exercise for a composer looking for<br/>points of stability in the infinite realm of microtonal harmony would be to<br/>spend some time with the chords above.</p></div>
