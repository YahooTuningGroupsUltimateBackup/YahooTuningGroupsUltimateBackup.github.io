Therefore, for any scale, diamond(scale) represents the set of<br/>all intervals appearing somewhere in this scale. Under this<br/>definition, diamond(diamond(scale)) represents the multiset of all<br/>differences between intervals in the scale. In other words, it&apos;s the<br/>multiset of &quot;chromas&quot; that transform one interval to another. I will<br/>call this the &quot;chroma multiset&quot; of a scale. What we want is to make<br/>all of these chromas as large as we possibly can, so that the<br/>intervals are as spread out as they can possibly get.</p><p>One way to do this is to make the size of the average chroma in the<br/>chroma multiset as large as possible. Unfortunately, if we naively<br/>take the arithmetic mean of this set, meaning we look at<br/>mean(diamond(diamond(scale))), it&apos;s trivial to show that we will<br/>always get a value of 1/2 the period no matter what scale we use. A<br/>solution presents itself by considering that we don&apos;t actually care<br/>about ALL of the differences between intervals in the scale. What we<br/>care about most are the chromata between intervals that are close in<br/>size - things like the MOS &quot;s&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; intervals.</p><p>We can thus focus our attention on maximizing the size of the<br/>-smallest- intervals in the chroma multiset. Furthermore, it&apos;s also<br/>trivial to see that any interval in this multiset will be perfectly<br/>matched by its octave-inverse, so that the smallest intervals in the<br/>set are matched 1-1 to the largest intervals in the set. This means<br/>that an equivalent goal is to minimize the size of the largest<br/>intervals in the chroma multiset - the octave-inverted chromata - as<br/>this is an identical procedure to maximizing the size of the smallest<br/>intervals in the same set. We will find that minimizing the rms of<br/>diamond(diamond(scale)) does the trick; this measure when applied to a<br/>scale will be called the &quot;RDD&quot; of the scale for short.</p><p>While RDD can be used for any scale, for now we&apos;re going to restrict<br/>our attention to seeing what it says about various MOS&apos;s. The<br/>following is a graph of the RDD for all 7-note scales consisting of<br/>iterated stackings of a single generator - which may not always<br/>correspond to MOS. The x-axis represents the size of the generator,<br/>and the y-axis represents the RDD of the resulting scale:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MikeBattaglia/RDD7.png">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/MikeBattaglia/RDD7.png</a></p><p>Note that local maxima of RDD are typically found at simple rational<br/>divisions of the octave. The reason for this should be pretty clear:<br/>if the generator for your MOS is close to something like 1/2 or 1/4 of<br/>an octave, then you&apos;re going to end up accumulating a ton of very<br/>small intervals in your scale, which doesn&apos;t satisfy our initial<br/>desideratum of making all of the intervals as distinct in size from<br/>one another as possible. Local minima, which are what we want,<br/>typically end up being placed maximally far from such ratios.</p><p>Here&apos;s the set of all minima for N=7. These are listed in order of<br/>goodness, and if the generator doesn&apos;t actually make an MOS, I&apos;ve put<br/>a question mark next to it:</p><p>525.2 - Roughly mavila[7] in 16-EDO<br/>160.5 - Roughly porcupine[7] in 15-EDO<br/>503.4 - Roughly POTE 7-limit meantone[7] (!)<br/>353.8 - Roughly maqamic[7] in 17-EDO<br/>182.3 - Roughly glacial[7] in 33-EDO<br/>331.9 - Roughly orgone[7] in 18-EDO<br/>458.2 - Roughly father[7?] in 21-EDO<br/>442.6 - Roughly sensi[7?] in 19-EDO<br/>535.2 - Slightly sharp of mavila[7] in 9-EDO<br/>144.9 - Roughly bleu[7] in 17-EDO<br/>215.1 - Roughly machine[7?] in 17-EDO<br/>272.1 - Roughly orwell[7?] in 22-EDO<br/>262.0 - Roughly superpelog[7?] in 23-EDO</p><p>Note that if you want the generators minimizing RDD for 7-note scales<br/>of period less than an octave, you can simply multiply these<br/>generators by period/1200 to get the new values. Divide by two to get<br/>the best 7-note generators with respect to a 1/2-octave period.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2012 5:58:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Some more useful data for this model is to look at the<br/>greatest-cardinality MOS formed by some generator under a certain<br/>ceiling.

It&apos;s similar to how<br/>Graham&apos;s temperament finder yields many of the same results as<br/>Keenan&apos;s HE search, for instance - sensible models of the same<br/>desiderata simply tend to give similar results. You&apos;re not going to<br/>see Father[8] at the top of any list of temperaments optimized for<br/>harmonic accuracy in any sort of reasonable way, and you&apos;re not going<br/>to see tetracot at the top of any of these lists either.</p><p>(However, tetracot is still awesome; the fact that it&apos;s quasi-equal is<br/>actually something I really like about it. I should note here that<br/>this approach doesn&apos;t model how &quot;good&quot; the scale is, just how easy it<br/>is to identify the intervals overall. But quasi-equalness can produce<br/>its own, beautiful effect, and the intervals in things like porcupine<br/>and tetracot in my experience get easier to identify with training<br/>anyway.)</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Sat, Mar 17, 2012 at 3:59 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s the set of all minima for N=7.
