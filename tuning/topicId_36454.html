Scala shows 437.3989 Hz for the tone A. I<br/>expected it to give 440 Hz. Until now, I thought that A was always<br/>440 Hz nowadays, independent of the tuning. But since my Scala<br/>experiment I am not sure about that.</p><p>Part of params.par looks like:</p><p>[-------------------------------------<br/>! Default frequency of middle C in Hz:<br/>261.625565301<br/>-------------------------------------]</p><p>so, according to Scala, it is middle C that always has the same<br/>frequency. And A is only equal to 440 Hz in 12 EDO.</p><p>I find this very strange. Does anyone know whether this is right ?</p><p>I used the following coomands to calculate the frequencies:</p><p>[-------------------------------------<br/>calculate 3/2-$k^1/4<br/>pythagorean<br/>12<br/>2/1<br/>7<br/>$0<br/>3<br/>show /frequency<br/>-------------------------------------]</p><p>I use Scala version 1.41 for DOS. Maybe that&apos;s an old one ?</p><p>Bart Pauwels</p></div><h3><a id=36460 href="#36460">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>4/17/2002 6:15:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Beste Bart,</p><p>This is indeed how it&apos;s intended to be. The pitch<br/>reference is tied to scale degree 0 or 1/1. When your<br/>A is scale degree 9, it will indeed vary with the<br/>scale. This can&apos;t be changed, because Scala was not<br/>built for 12-tone scales only.<br/>However, you can set your A to be scale degree 0<br/>and see the right frequencies for concert pitch by<br/>doing</p><p>set freq 440.0<br/>key 9<br/>show/freq</p><p>This doesn&apos;t apply to tuning a synthesizer or retuning<br/>a MIDI file, they use the frequency setting of the<br/>keyboard mapping.<br/>But 440 Hz. is not really a universal standard.

When a contemporary organ builder has to<br/>build an organ in 1/4 comma meantone, and the customer wants standard<br/>pitch, does it have to be A=440 or 437.3989 Hz ?<br/>Even if the 440 Hz standard is not always used by anyone, the<br/>necessity for a standard remains.<br/>Maybe the people who raised A=440 Hz to a standard didn&apos;t think about<br/>alternate tunings at all. I suppose the standard was established<br/>sometime in the first half of the 20th century. And I suppose that<br/>were bad times for anything else but 12EDO ?</p><p>Bart Pauwels</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., manuel.op.de.coul@e... wrote:<br/>&gt; Beste Bart,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is indeed how it&apos;s intended to be.

Several years ago,<br/>when I was &quot;studying&quot; piano tuning, there were two &quot;competing&quot;<br/>systems, a German &quot;A&quot; method and a Smith &quot;C&quot; method.  I believe they<br/>both ended up with A-440, but the beginning &quot;reference note&quot; was<br/>obviously different in the different systems...  And that was just<br/>for 12-tET systems.</p><p>J.
