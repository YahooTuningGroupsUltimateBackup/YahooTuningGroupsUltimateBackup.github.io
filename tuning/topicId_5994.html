Often I tend to ask for a 12-note tuning:<br/>&quot;Where&apos;s the Wolf?&quot; in order to get my bearing (e.g. Eb-G# in one<br/>14th-century Pythagorean tuning, and typically in 16th-century<br/>meantone).</p><p>While Ramos&apos;s tuning is famed for its introduction of 5-based ratios<br/>for major and minor thirds, Ramos himself advocates it especially as<br/>an easy method for students who may not be conversant with the more<br/>complex arithmetic used in traditional Pythagorean tunings such as<br/>those of Boethius and Guido d&apos;Arezzo.</p><p>At the same time, pedagogical convenience quite aside, Ramos both in<br/>this monochord tuning and in his discussion of &quot;good and bad<br/>semitones&quot; (likely on a meantone keyboard instrument, argues Mark<br/>Lindley) reflects the orientation of his era toward a texture pervaded<br/>by thirds and sixths, which approach stability.</p><p>In 1477, Tinctoris had reported the view of the time that there was no<br/>music worth hearing save that written in the previous 40 years. What<br/>he is reporting is not, of course, an objective judgment of the<br/>beauties of the previous Gothic styles, but an impatience with the<br/>&quot;old&quot; common to many eras.</p><p>Part of the &quot;new&quot; was an altered approach toward concord and discord,<br/>one which not only treated thirds and sixths as more and more favored<br/>intervals, but restricted the often bold role in Gothic music of major<br/>seconds and minor sevenths. By around 1500, composers such as Josquin<br/>and Isaac were ending pieces on sonorities including a third,<br/>reflecting the same changes in taste suggested by the Ramos monochord<br/>tuning.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. The Ramos monochord of 1482: string-ratios and divisions<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Following the suggestion of Oliver Strunk, translator of an extract<br/>from Ramos describing his tuning, I am diagramming this tuning based<br/>on a string length of 288, so that all ratios may be expressed with<br/>integers:</p><p>                             1 1<br/>                             2 2<br/>                  80  96     0 8       160    192       240 256<br/>q              p  o  n m  l  k # i  h   g   f  e    d     c  b       a<br/>|--------------|--|--|-|--|--|-|-|--|---|---|--|----|-----|--|-------|<br/>0             72    90   108    135 144    180     216             288<br/>               |  |  | |  |  | | |  |<br/>               a  g  f e  d  c # bb a</p><p>Note that while the upper B-natural between &quot;i&quot; and &quot;k&quot; should<br/>properly be marked with a &quot;square-B&quot; sign -- our natural sign --<br/>medieval usage often treats this and &quot;#&quot; sign (available in ASCII) as<br/>equivalent. Either sign indicates the solmization syllable _mi_, with<br/>a semitone above (here b-c).</p><p>One of the very striking things I realized while reading through<br/>Ramos&apos;s division and diagramming it above is that his tuning, a<br/>version of Ptolemy&apos;s syntonic diatonic, seems to result naturally from<br/>a convenient arithmetic division or &quot;bisection&quot; of the fifth into two<br/>thirds. Quite apart from matters of tertian just intonation, it _is_<br/>an easy division to perform from a practical point of view.</p><p>After dividing the entire string length a-q (288) in half, with h as<br/>the division point (144, 2:1 to a), Ramos uses an arithmetic division<br/>(bisection into two equal lengths) of a-h to find point d (216). This<br/>note is a fourth 288:216 (4:3) above a and a fifth 216:144 (3:2) below<br/>h (or aa). In other words, the basic division is 4:3:2.</p><p>Now comes another arithmetic division, this time of d-h, to find f<br/>(180). The fifth d-aa is thus divided into intervals of d-f or 216:180<br/>(6:5), and f-aa, 180:144 (5:4). Here the division is 6:5:4.</p><p>Note that with such arithmetic divisions of an interval, the smaller<br/>resulting interval is located below, and the larger interval above --<br/>a-d-aa for the octave a-aa, or d-f-aa for the fifth d-aa.</p><p>Ramos then bisects h-q to find p or aaa (72), the double octave to a,<br/>with a ratio of 288:72 or 4:1. Then he arithmetically divides h-p to<br/>find l or dd (108), a 144:108 (4:3) fourth above aa and a 108:72 (3:2)<br/>fifth below aaa.</p><p>Next l-p is bisected to find n of ff (90), arithmetically dividing the<br/>fifth dd-aaa into a lower minor third dd-ff of 108:90 (6:5), and an<br/>upper major third ff-aaa of 90:72 (5:4).</p><p>Making an arithmetic division of f-n, Ramos finds i (135), or Bb, the<br/>note dividing the octave f-ff into a lower 180:135 (4:3) fourth and an<br/>upper 135:90 (3:2) fifth.</p><p>These divisions so far are shown by the numbers below the line<br/>representing the monochord in the diagram. Subsequent divisions are<br/>shown by numbers above this line.</p><p>The next step is to divide the whole length a-q into three equal<br/>parts, thus finding m or ee at one-third length (96), and e at<br/>two-thirds length (192), respectively the 288:96 (3:1) twelfth a-ee<br/>and the 288:192 (3:2) fifth a-e.</p><p>Then e-q is similarly trisected to find the two-thirds point #<br/>or square-B (128), forming the 192:128 (3:2) fifth e-#. Taking twice<br/>the length #-q, we find b (256), forming a 256:128 or 2:1 octave b-#.</p><p>Next we bisect m-h to find k or cc (120), dividing the fifth aa-ee<br/>into a 144:120 (6:5) minor third aa-cc and a 120:96 (5:4) major third<br/>cc-ee. Taking twice the length k-q, we find c (240), forming the<br/>240:120 (2:1) octave c-cc. This note, in turn, divides the fifth a-e<br/>into the 288:240 (6:5) minor third a-c and the 240:192 (5:4) major<br/>third c-e.</p><p>Finally, bisecting e-#, we find g (160), dividing the fifth e-# into a<br/>192:160 (6:5) minor third e-g and a 160:128 (5:4) major third g-#.<br/>Finding half of the length g-q gives us o or gg (80), forming the<br/>160:80 (2:1) octave g-gg.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. The syntonic diatonic: a division of arithmetic convenience?<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>As promised by Ramos, this division of the monochord indeed is based<br/>on a few simple processes: division or multiplication by two to find<br/>octaves and double octaves; division by three to find fifths;<br/>arithmetic divisions of octaves into lower fourths and upper fifths;<br/>and arithmetic divisions of fifths into lower minor thirds and upper<br/>major thirds.</p><p>Curiously, looking into the monochord of Ramos has suddenly impressed<br/>me that Ptolemy&apos;s syntonic diatonic could arise as a simple bisection<br/>of the fifth -- 6:5:4. Being able to quote this string-ratio is one<br/>thing; realizing how easily it could arise on a monochord is another.</p><p>The analogous arithmetic division of the 9:8 whole-tone, 18:17:16, is<br/>presented by Boethius and later medieval theorists of his tradition<br/>not as a practical tuning, but as a demonstration that the whole-tone<br/>cannot be _equally_ divided (we might add, &quot;by using integer ratios&quot;).<br/>However, Marchettus of Padua seems to present this division as one<br/>possible practice, while an English treatise on organ pipe lengths<br/>from around 1373 recommends this 18:17:16 rule for dividing a<br/>Pythagorean whole-tone into two semitones (e.g. with the length for c#<br/>an average of the lengths for c and d).</p><p>From this point of view, while Ramos&apos;s arithmetic division of the<br/>fifth into a 6:5 minor third and 5:4 major third is indeed the first<br/>Renaissance formulation of Ptolemy&apos;s syntonic diatonic, it may also be<br/>(like an 18:17:16 scheme for organ pipes) partially motivated by sheer<br/>simplicity.</p><p>Incidentally, if we take the lowest note of Ramos&apos;s monochord as A re<br/>(A2, the note immediately above Gamma ut or G2, the usual starting<br/>point of the hexachord system), then his scheme follows the medieval<br/>tradition of the integral gamut or _musica recta_, including Bb in the<br/>upper octave but not in its lower octave, where the first hexachord on<br/>G2 has only B-mi, not any Bb or B-fa (which would be _musica ficta_,<br/>for example the _fa_ of a hexachord on F2, the step below gamma ut).</p><p>As a practical tuning scheme for fixed-pitch instruments, of course,<br/>the Ramos division would have the obvious &quot;bug,&quot; as Mark Lindley<br/>points out also for some comparable 15th-century schemes, of quite<br/>unobligingly placing a Wolf fourth or fifth at D-G. In the diagram, we<br/>thus have d-g at 216:160 (27:20) rather than 4:3, and g-dd at 160:108<br/>(40:27) rather than 3:2, etc. These Wolf fourths and fifths, as is<br/>characteristic of 5-limit just intonation, are respectively a syntonic<br/>comma (81:80) larger or smaller than pure.</p><p>In fact, as Ramos suggests in his own discussion of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;<br/>semitones as interpreted by Lindley, keyboardists were already solving<br/>this problem in practice by using meantone, where fifths were slightly<br/>narrowed to achieve pure or near-pure thirds without the complications<br/>of the syntonic comma. The practice may have started by around 1450,<br/>and Gaffurius more explicitly confirms it in 1496.</p><p>To conclude, the Ramos division of the monochord has two appealing<br/>aspects from a Renaissance standpoint: it is simple, and it typifies<br/>some of the musical trends of the epoch, codified in the next century<br/>by Fogliano and Zarlino in their advocacy of the syntonic diatonic.</p><p>From a medieval viewpoint, of course, such a tuning might be seen in<br/>some ways as an _oversimplification_ of a subtle balance between the<br/>intervals, and in others as a scheme with unwelcome complications such<br/>as a Wolf at D-G in a tuning with only eight notes per octave. A<br/>traditional Pythagorean tuning in eight notes, or in 12 notes with a<br/>Wolf at some less prominent location such as Eb-G# or even Gb-B, might<br/>seem more elegant, not to mention a 17-note tuning of Gb-A#, as<br/>proposed earlier in the century by Prosdocimus and Ugolino, with its<br/>many resources.</p><p>For music up to around 1420 or 1450, indeed, such a Pythagorean scheme<br/>would nicely fit practice as well as theory; the late 15th century is<br/>a time of new practices and theories, not better but different. Ramos<br/>nicely reflects the spirit of his age.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
