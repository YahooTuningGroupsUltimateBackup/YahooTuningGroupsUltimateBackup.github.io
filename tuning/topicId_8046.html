In meantone, the extended reference will be weakened considerably<br/>by the considerably flattened fifths, so that the interval Ab-F# is actually<br/>smaller than a 7:4, crossing a kind of perceptual threshold.</p><p>In &quot;French&quot; augmented sixth chords, one does enjoy the ambiguous relationship<br/>of the two major thirds to one another; I don&apos;t know how this ambiguity could<br/>be maintained in a just environment.</p><p>Incidentally, I would be somewhat wary about the spelling rules found in the<br/>_Harvard_ definitions.  There are plenty of &quot;German&quot; augmented sixth chords<br/>spelled as augmented sixths and &quot;Italian&quot; chords spelled as minor sevenths to<br/>be found in real repertoire.</p></div>
