You&apos;re<br/>getting hot, though, with the recognition that the major and minor<br/>thirds are flat by the same amount.</p><p>2/7-comma meantone and Paul Erlich&apos;s comment mentioning Zarlino&apos;s<br/>mathematical description of it came up in the context of my work with<br/>beat synchrony in temperaments. Gene had mentioned that 1/7-comma<br/>meantone has 2.0 beat ratios of minor to major thirds in the close,<br/>root-position triads in all playable keys. I mentioned 2/7-comma<br/>meantone as another example of a synchronous meantone, along with 1/5-<br/>comma.</p><p>Remember that major triads with justly tuned perfect fifths will<br/>always have a beat ratio of 3/2 for minor to major thirds. Also<br/>notice that this is a case of the minor third always being exactly as<br/>flat as the major third is sharp, which yields a beat ratio of -1.50<br/>if we include phase relationships by including the sign.</p><p>In 2/7-comma, you have a +1.5 beat ratio (opposite sign), since the<br/>major and minor thirds are flat by exactly the same amount. This<br/>accounts for the positive sign indicating phase.</p><p>I don&apos;t believe these musicians decided favorite temperaments on the<br/>basis of technical considerations. I think they loved how<br/>HARMONIOUSLY SMOOTH AND SATISFYING this temperament is. After all,<br/>this is a MUSICAL criterion resulting from a technical one, to be<br/>sure, but the MUSICALITY of the result is what I believe they found<br/>so convincing.</p><p>I mentioned TWO good reasons for this:</p><p>1) It is a synchronous temperament, meaning the beat rates are tuned<br/>to synchronize, 3 beats on the minor third for every two on the<br/>major. It is a clear subjective experience for me and some of the top<br/>professional tuners in the Piano Technician&apos;s Guild, some of whom<br/>design temperaments themselves, that tuning (synchronizing) the beats<br/>is important, too. It is a kind of second-order coherence that helps<br/>compensate the sacrifice in first-order harmonic coherence that<br/>tempering unavoidably introduces.</p><p>2) It is fairly close to Woolhouse&apos;s optimization of meantone, which<br/>minimizes the degree to which all three intervals in a triad are<br/>compromised. I believe this, combined with a theoretically perfect<br/>3/2 beat ratio, is what makes it the most harmoniously smooth<br/>meantone temperament, even smoother than Woolhouse&apos;s optimization.</p><p>In a word, it SOUNDS GOOD! That&apos;s why they like it, darn it! It&apos;s<br/>MUSICAL! It sounds good! That&apos;s it, period, in my view.</p><p>Musically yours,</p><p>Bob</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; does anyone know *why* Zarlino had a preference<br/>&gt; for 2/7-comma meantone?

Thank you. That&apos;s exactly my hypothesis, and what I<br/>meant earlier by the reasons not being technical. A preference may<br/>have a basis in some technical aspect underlying the good sound, but<br/>liking something because it sounds good, whatever the underlying<br/>technical reasons for the perception may be, is not in itself a<br/>technical reason for the preference. We may like the smooth, mellow<br/>sound of a French horn because of the lovely, balanced regularity of<br/>its harmonics, but this reaction may occur despite a total lack of<br/>unawareness of this, even though it has everything to do with it.</p><p>Also, although I don&apos;t think a valid argument for it sounding better<br/>is dependent on hearing beats, I don&apos;t believe that it is necessary<br/>to understand analytically the existence of harmonics to hear beats.<br/>In answer to one of Paul Erlich&apos;s questions, &quot;tuning wrench in hand&quot;,<br/>1/4-comma meantone has an interesting characteristic that makes it<br/>easier to tune and check for accuracy:</p><p>The major thirds are completely just, so a fourth above the top tone<br/>(e.g., A above a M3, C-E) will beat with the top note (E) at exactly<br/>the same rate as it does with the bottom not a major sixth below it<br/>(C). This is because both notes in the major third have a common<br/>harmonic with A, as well as with each other. The common harmonic with<br/>each other has no beats on it, since the third is just, so they both<br/>beat at the same rate with the common harmonic on the A.</p><p>This means you can tune the third justly not simply by eliminating<br/>beats between the common harmonic on the two notes in the third, but<br/>even more accurately by making the beating with the fourth above the<br/>top note exactly the same rate. This is actually easier and more<br/>accurate on piano strings than trying to eliminate beats between the<br/>two notes of the third itself.</p><p>The beats on the latter are the fifth and fourth harmonics of the<br/>bottom and top notes respectively. The beats of either with the<br/>fourth above the top note is lower in the harmonic series, on the<br/>stronger third harmonic of the fourth above. This beating is much<br/>easier to hear. It makes a wonderful cross-check as well as a means<br/>to move quickly to remote parts of the cycle of fifths to forestall<br/>the effect of miniscule but cumulative errors, the universal bane of<br/>even the finest ears among tuners. Further, it helps compensate<br/>inharmonicity on piano strings to tune 1/4-comma this way.</p><p>It is difficult to imagine that people who tuned their own<br/>instruments every day before playing, and even multiple times per day<br/>in some circumstances, and who often had a choice of several commonly<br/>used temperaments in their era that were not so grossly different<br/>from each other, would never notice this beating even if they never<br/>once thought in terms of harmonics. The other arts were highly<br/>refined, with a deep, if not always scientifically understood,<br/>mastery of technical considerations. I find it difficult to think,<br/>all things considered, that the art of music represented some kind of<br/>contrast in this regard.</p><p>I find it much more likely that is was subjectively refined beyond<br/>the imagination of most musicians living in an age in which tuning<br/>temperaments is left to professional technicians, and who are never<br/>confronted with the fine pitch distinctions that inevitably manifest<br/>when you set any kind of temperament, and which mandate tempering in<br/>the first place. It is important to remind ourselves that mathematics<br/>conjured up in the whimsical imaginations of theorists such as<br/>Riemann and Lobachevsky, end up being used to describe large-scale<br/>reality in Einstein&apos;s General Relativity.</p><p>This illustrates that there are qualities in the human mind that<br/>reflect the &quot;external&quot; realities in nature around us. Not everything<br/>that is written about the external completey explains<br/>the &quot;knowingness&quot; that we possess within ourselves and<br/>our &quot;subjective&quot; reality. So some things may be considered too<br/>commonplace or &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;subjective&quot; or subtle or even obvious<br/>but conceptually elusive to bother to write down.</p></div><h3><a id=42670 href="#42670">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>3/4/2003 10:23:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I hadn&apos;t written yet that it&apos;s possible to print out the cross<br/>checks that Robert mentioned with Scala.

I find it difficult to think,<br/>&gt; &gt; all things considered, that the art of music represented some kind<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; contrast in this regard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; everything i&apos;ve said is well-documented. hopefully you&apos;ll be able, at<br/>&gt; least, to get a library to provide you with a copy of the jorgenson<br/>&gt; book. also, if possible, read up on mersenne&apos;s _harmonie<br/>&gt; universelle_, the state of tuning technique before it, and the state<br/>&gt; of tuning technique after it. you&apos;ll find some good info in the new<br/>&gt; grove dictionary. the &quot;scientific revolution&quot; happened a bit later in<br/>&gt; the musical arts than in the other arts in our civilization.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=42694 href="#42694">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2003 12:54:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, manuel.op.de.coul@e... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;i tried this command but it didn&apos;t work. i have scala 2.05b . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t keep track of what was added when, but you should<br/>&gt; upgrade then.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Manuel</p><p>according to this:</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/release-notes.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/release-notes.html</a></p><p>the latest version is 2.05. does &quot;b&quot; mean &quot;beta&quot;?</p></div><h3><a id=42695 href="#42695">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2003 12:59:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>who&apos;s &quot;they&quot;? &quot;when&quot;?</p><p>&gt; The other question is whether beats can be &quot;sensed&quot;<br/>&gt; without being percieved. the possibility of this is high when you<br/>consider most of music is things still<br/>&gt; more &quot;sensed&quot; than percieved in a way that we can analytical<br/>desipher!</p><p>kraig, i agree with this! you&apos;re still missing my point. in order for<br/>certain tunings to have been &quot;preferred&quot; for a given &quot;sensed&quot; reason,<br/>the tuning would have to first be *realized* accurately enough to<br/>distinguish it from one that would not be preferred, so that<br/>someone&apos;s preference had a chance to actually *prefer* something. my<br/>point is that the technology did not exist to do this, to accurately<br/>set the tunings, in the first place!</p></div><h3><a id=42696 href="#42696">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2003 1:01:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; according to this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/release-notes.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/release-notes.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the latest version is 2.05. does &quot;b&quot; mean &quot;beta&quot;?</p><p>If you look at the download page:</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/downloads.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/downloads.html</a></p><p>...you&apos;ll see that the latest PC platform download is 2.05y.

Thank you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; dear bob,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; please read monz&apos;s reply to what i wrote again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; beats and overtones were unknown in zarlino&apos;s day.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; there was no way to accurately tune, IN THE FIRST PLACE 2/7-comma<br/>&gt; meantone as opposed to, say, 7/25-comma (also &quot;optimal&quot;, though by<br/>&gt; different criteria), in those days.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so what sounded good and what didn&apos;t sound good could have been 2/7-<br/>&gt; comma and 7/25-comma, or the reverse, or none of the above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; no one had any way of knowing in those days. the &quot;result&quot; gene<br/>&gt; postulates above simply had no way of coming about, with any<br/>&gt; accuracy, in the first place -- as opposed to some &quot;result&quot; in which<br/>&gt; the beat synchrony did not appear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; we take accurate tuning for granted today with our electronic tuners<br/>&gt; and computers. but before beats and overtones were even suspected of<br/>&gt; existing (and logarithms hadn&apos;t been invented yet), these small<br/>&gt; fractions of a comma were completely *theoretical*, in the realm of<br/>&gt; ideals rather than tangible musical entities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is difficult to imagine that people who tuned their own<br/>&gt; &gt; instruments every day before playing, and even multiple times per<br/>&gt; day<br/>&gt; &gt; in some circumstances, and who often had a choice of several<br/>&gt; commonly<br/>&gt; &gt; used temperaments in their era that were not so grossly different<br/>&gt; &gt; from each other, would never notice this beating even if they never<br/>&gt; &gt; once thought in terms of harmonics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the problem is that this &quot;choice&quot; was not simply &quot;given&quot; the way it<br/>&gt; is with today&apos;s electronic gear. until the 17th century, there were<br/>&gt; absolutely no aural guides for setting temperaments -- neither<br/>&gt; eliminating beats nor getting their rates to match. so even if<br/>&gt; they &quot;preferred&quot; one temperament over another, they wouldn&apos;t know<br/>&gt; what they were comparing to what! until mersenne came around, setting<br/>&gt; different varieties of meantones was more guessing game than science.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as to noticing beats, the vast majority of pianists whom i&apos;ve talked<br/>&gt; to about tuning are unable to hear them even with a great deal of<br/>&gt; prodding. i walk over to the piano, play a major third, and say &quot;hear<br/>&gt; the beats&quot;? if we&apos;re using a synth, i&apos;ll play a just major third for<br/>&gt; comparison. &quot;hear how that *doesn&apos;t* beat?&quot; silence. i go back to the<br/>&gt; tempered major third and sing &quot;wawawawa&quot; in time with the beating<br/>&gt; common overtone. &quot;hear that?&quot; almost no pianist does. it&apos;s no wonder<br/>&gt; beating escaped everyone&apos;s attention until the 17th century.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The other arts were highly<br/>&gt; &gt; refined, with a deep, if not always scientifically understood,<br/>&gt; &gt; mastery of technical considerations. I find it difficult to think,<br/>&gt; &gt; all things considered, that the art of music represented some kind<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; contrast in this regard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; everything i&apos;ve said is well-documented. hopefully you&apos;ll be able, at<br/>&gt; least, to get a library to provide you with a copy of the jorgenson<br/>&gt; book. also, if possible, read up on mersenne&apos;s _harmonie<br/>&gt; universelle_, the state of tuning technique before it, and the state<br/>&gt; of tuning technique after it. you&apos;ll find some good info in the new<br/>&gt; grove dictionary. the &quot;scientific revolution&quot; happened a bit later in<br/>&gt; the musical arts than in the other arts in our civilization.</p></div><h3><a id=47713 href="#47713">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2003 8:12:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;akjmicro&quot; &lt;akjmicro@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hey guys,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I know this is an old thread, but I&apos;ve been taking an interest in<br/>the 2/7 comma<br/>&gt; meantone lately.
