Paul Hahn only<br/>listed the strict odd-limits but he went to 31-limit and to 1200-EDO<br/>in some tables, and 200-EDO in others.</p><p>Folks can extract their own information, e.g. search for an ET for<br/>some specific harmonic purpose, by adding their own formulae. For<br/>example, Margo Schulter might add a row that only shows the<br/>1,3,7,9,11,13 (no 5) max-error when the ET is not also 1,3,5,7,9,11,13<br/>consistent.</p><p>So your question really belongs to the &quot;A common notation for JI and<br/>ETs&quot; thread which is why I&apos;ve answered it here.</p><p>The common-notation project is at this stage quite independent of the<br/>specific symbols used. For my own convenience I am currently using the<br/>ASCII version of the Sims accidentals v^ &lt;&gt; [] for the 5 7 and 11<br/>commas and some other up/down pairs of characters that no-one is<br/>currently using as ASCIIdentals. These don&apos;t necessarily relate to the<br/>possible extended Sims accidentals I posted earlier as ASCII-grafix.<br/>In particular I think the 17 and 19 commas should be represented by<br/>symbols that give some indication of their small size relative to the<br/>others. Mind you, very few ETs below 72-tET will require the use of a<br/>17 or 19-comma symbol and they will all be ETs that are rarely used.<br/>Even the 13-comma will be rare below 72-tET.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul and Daniel Wolf have gotten to me somewhat and<br/>convinced me that there is a living European microtonal tradition that<br/>is incompatible with the Sims notation, and in particular, that the<br/>problem with the slashes \ / as syntonic comma symbols can be<br/>mitigated by putting a short vertical stroke thru the up-comma slash,<br/>thereby making it reminiscent of a &quot;+&quot; sign and avoiding left-right<br/>confusability. [You&apos;ll need Message Index, Expand Messages to see this<br/>correctly on Yahoo&apos;s dopey web interface].</p><p>    /<br/>  |/<br/>  |<br/> /|<br/>/</p><p>I think the traditions agree reasonable well on the septimal comma<br/>symbols (L7, or &lt;&gt; in ACSII). Although I&apos;m worried that perhaps<br/>someone writes a harmonic seventh as G:F7 rather than G:FL? Anyone<br/>know?</p><p>And of course we know the Europeans (and some US residents) want to<br/>use the up and down arrows (ASCII v^) for the 11-diesis because they<br/>have been used for quartertones.</p><p>Well I may just have to find _two_ sets of 19-limit symbols, in order<br/>to encourage acceptance of the basic idea of notating ETs using<br/>19-limit JI, but I will never ever support the use of ordinary &quot;-&quot; and<br/>&quot;+&quot; as accidentals on scores.</p><p>Now Joseph there&apos;s another way in which this project is probably not<br/>the answer to all your prayers (I don&apos;t think such an answer exists),<br/>and this relates to the recent confusion over the two different ways<br/>of understanding and using commas. If we use v^ &lt;&gt; and [] to notate a<br/>whole host of ETs, then no matter how we do it, there is no way that<br/>they can always represent the same pitch change in cents, across all<br/>the ETs. I don&apos;t even expect # and b to do that.</p><p>The only feasible way of notating all ETs so that the notation<br/>indicates shifts from 12-tET, is the Johnny Reinhardt method of<br/>writing the + or - cents next to the notes.</p><p>As I understand it, Dan Stearn&apos;s notational proposal is similar to<br/>Johny&apos;s in that it tries to use symbols to mean specific numbers of<br/>cents from 12-tET, instead of meaning the difference between a<br/>particular prime ratio and a particular-length chain of fifths, but<br/>one problem is that it forces you to round the deviations to the<br/>nearest multiple of 8&amp;1/3 cents. I just don&apos;t think this is good<br/>enough. And it certainly doesn&apos;t have the same property as Gene&apos;s and<br/>my Rapoport-style proposal, that the best approximation to a<br/>4:5:6:7:9:11 chord (for example) is always spelled G:Bv:D:F&lt;:A:C] no<br/>matter what ET you&apos;re in (except when the commas, and therefore their<br/>accidentals, vanish in some ET).</p><p>Slightly off-topic, I have a proposal for a shorthand that allows both<br/>Blackjack and 22-tET to be notated with only one accidental per note<br/>and without slashes thru noteheads as Alison Monteith has done.<br/>Someone who can make or edit fonts, should make a pair of symbols that<br/>are a standard flat symbol with an arrow head pointing upwards on the<br/>top of the vertical stroke and a standard sharp symbol with an<br/>arrowhead pointing down on the bottom of the leftmost vertical stroke.</p></div><h3><a id=34813 href="#34813">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2002 10:46:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;     /<br/>&gt;   |/<br/>&gt;   |<br/>&gt;  /|<br/>&gt; /</p><p>How is this relevant to ascii symbolism?</p><p>&gt; Well I may just have to find _two_ sets of 19-limit symbols, in order<br/>&gt; to encourage acceptance of the basic idea of notating ETs using<br/>&gt; 19-limit JI, but I will never ever support the use of ordinary &quot;-&quot; and<br/>&gt; &quot;+&quot; as accidentals on scores.</p><p>Let&apos;s please not confuse things further.</p><p>I don&apos;t even expect # and b to do that.</p><p>Of course they don&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; The only feasible way of notating all ETs so that the notation<br/>&gt; indicates shifts from 12-tET, is the Johnny Reinhardt method of<br/>&gt; writing the + or - cents next to the notes.</p><p>I imagine some other unit than cents would be feasible, for starters.</p></div><h3><a id=34818 href="#34818">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2002 12:26:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;     /<br/>&gt; &gt;   |/<br/>&gt; &gt;   |<br/>&gt; &gt;  /|<br/>&gt; &gt; /<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How is this relevant to ascii symbolism?</p><p>Because folk want the ASCII symbols to look like (or at least suggest)<br/>the real symbols used on scores.</p><p>I was previously able to reject the use of \ / as comma symbols and<br/>therefore the whole (for want of a better term) &quot;European&quot; system of<br/>\/ &lt;&gt; v^ for 5, 7 11.

The<br/>fact that Manuel Op de Coul isn&apos;t about to change Scala to correspond<br/>to the Sims notation, is fairly serious.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****I guess I&apos;ll have to confess that it really does look like<br/>there&apos;s no &quot;worldwide&quot; standard... :)</p><p>Well, we&apos;re back to making sure we have LEGENDS on our scores, like<br/>back in the *wild* 60&apos;s... where half of the music was the invention<br/>of a new *notation...*  :)</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well I may just have to find _two_ sets of 19-limit symbols, in<br/>&gt; order<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to encourage acceptance of the basic idea of notating ETs using<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 19-limit JI, but I will never ever support the use of<br/>ordinary &quot;-&quot; and &quot;+&quot; as accidentals on scores.</p><p>****Your point, Dave, about these little symbols for the syntonic<br/>comma being illegible is, I believe well taken.  I agree with Monz<br/>that they are kind of &quot;neat&quot; for the small alterations of that comma,<br/>but, really they don&apos;t work on scores.</p><p>\ and / are considerably better, I believe...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The only feasible way of notating all ETs so that the notation<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; indicates shifts from 12-tET, is the Johnny Reinhardt method of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; writing the + or - cents next to the notes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I imagine some other unit than cents would be feasible, for<br/>&gt; starters.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Depends what you mean by &quot;feasible&quot;. I meant &quot;sufficiently accurate<br/>&gt; while being easily understood by performers with ordinary training&quot;.</p><p>***Yes, let&apos;s please keep that in mind.  Theory is *great* but we&apos;re<br/>talking about, maybe, music that is to be *played...*   (I hope some<br/>of it, anyway...)  :)</p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=34904 href="#34904">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2002 12:38:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; i&apos;ve just made a new Dictionary entry for &quot;error&quot;, in which i<br/>&gt; chose two subsets of your spreadsheet (11-limit, 5-22edo and 5-<br/>41edo)<br/>&gt; to make some column graphs showing the error.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/error.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/error.htm</a></p><p>good info, but unfortunately</p><p>&middot;&apos;primes&apos; is not a good annotation, since 9 is not a prime;</p><p>&middot;the 3d bar graph doesn&apos;t really help get the information across,<br/>since the order of sets of odds is arbitrary.</p></div>
