But given a val...<br/>&gt; &gt; how do I know which commas matter?</p><p>Mike replied:</p><p>&gt; Do you mean how do you know which commas some val tempers out?</p><p>If Michael is like me, then no, that&apos;s not what he means; it&apos;s not hard to<br/>find out what commas a val tempers out. The question is, what commas matter,<br/>and why?</p><p>When a newbie comes to this list and to the wiki for the first time -- okay,<br/>I really mean &quot;when I came [etc]&quot;, but let&apos;s roll with it -- he sees a<br/>shocking amount of information with little assistance (that he can<br/>understand, anyway) in interpreting it. A huge amount of that information<br/>pertains to commas and EDOs. (That makes sense, of course, given the regular<br/>mapping paradigm. I&apos;m not complaining, I&apos;m just relating my experience.)</p><p>A typical example from the 121 EDO page:</p><p>&quot;The 121 equal temperament divides the octave into 121 equal steps of 9.917<br/>cents each. It has a distinctly sharp tendency, in that the odd primes from<br/>3 to 19 all have sharp tunings. It tempers out 15625/15552 in the 5-limit;<br/>4000/3969, 6144/6125, 10976/10935 in the 7-limit; 540/539, 896/891 and<br/>1375/1372 in the 11-limit; 325/324, 352/351, 364/363 and 625/624 in the<br/>13-limit; 256/255, 375/374 and 442/441 in the 17-limit; 190/189 and 361/360<br/>in the 19-limit. It also serves as the optimal patent val for 13-limit<br/>grendel temperament.&quot;</p><p>I now understand what this is saying, but -- and I think this is where<br/>Michael is coming from along with me  -- I don&apos;t know why these particular<br/>commas are musically useful.</p><p>I understand why tempering out 81/80 is useful: I&apos;m able to play ii-V7-I<br/>without a wolf interval.</p><p>I understand why tempering out 243/242 is useful: two approximate 11/9<br/>neutral thirds make up an approximate 3/2.</p><p>I don&apos;t really understand why tempering out 15625/15552, the Kleisma, is<br/>useful. I went to the Kleismic family page, which says, &quot;...the generator is<br/>a minor third, and that to get to the interval class of major thirds will<br/>require five of these, and so to get to fifths will require six.&quot; In 12-tET,<br/>stacks of minor thirds would bring me back to the octave: C-Eb-Gb-A-C, so my<br/>melodic and chordal relationships will be different in Kleismic / Hanson /<br/>Whatever temperament than they would in 12-tET. 19-tET *does* temper out the<br/>Kleisma, so I&apos;d get 315-632-947-63-378 cents instead of a cycle. But how<br/>often do I repeatedly stack minor thirds on each other? The occasional<br/>diminished chord, maybe, but not often. So what does this *really* mean to<br/>me? (No, I don&apos;t expect you to answer that. It no doubt takes a lot of<br/>experimentation.)</p><p>By and large, a comma list doesn&apos;t mean anything to me yet. It&apos;s like<br/>Arabic: I know a few words and can read the letters, but I only rarely<br/>derive meaning from it. For instance, I don&apos;t have a clue why I&apos;d want to<br/>temper out 4000/3969, but I stumbled across a reason to temper 6144/6125<br/>once (though I didn&apos;t write anything using that scale).</p><p>I&apos;m not complaining or anything, just saying that even when I get the<br/>mathematical parts of what&apos;s going on, I think I rarely get the musical<br/>parts.</p><p>On the other hand, sometimes I see explanations I can understand. One of the<br/>reasons I&apos;m probably going to play with Breedsmic is that it has some great<br/>descriptions on its page:</p><p>-----<br/>Breedsmic temperaments are rank two temperaments tempering out the breedsma,<br/>2401/2400. This is the amount by which two 49/40 intervals exceed 3/2, and<br/>by which two 60/49 intervals fall short. Either of these represent a neutral<br/>third interval which is highly characteristic of breedsmic tempering...</p><p>It is also the amount by which four stacked 10/7 intervals exceed 25/6:<br/>10000/2401 * 2401/2400 = 10000/2400 = 25/6, which is two octaves above the<br/>chromatic semitone, 25/24. We might note also that 49/40 * 10/7 = 7/4 and<br/>49/40 * (10/7)^2 = 5/2, relationships which will be significant in any<br/>breedsmic temperament. As a consequence of these facts, the 49/40+60/49<br/>neutral third and the 7/5 and 10/7 intervals tend to have relatively low<br/>complexity in a breedsmic system.<br/>-----</p><p>That&apos;s great information, and I think I understand how this temperament can<br/>help me make music.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=101346 href="#101346">ðŸ”—</a>petrparizek2000 &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2011 4:20:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jake.<br/>Not sure if you use Scala but if you do and if you have a recent version, try locating the files &quot;pump_kleisma.seq&quot; and &quot;shansx.scl&quot; and then type something like &quot;example pump_kleisma.seq pump_kleisma.mid&quot;.<br/>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=101351 href="#101351">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2011 11:56:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; A typical example from the 121 EDO page:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The 121 equal temperament divides the octave into 121<br/>&gt; equal steps of 9.917 cents each.

The tuning of the Persian tar and setar, often with 17<br/>notes per octave, is a good example (e.g. persian.scl or<br/>persian-far.scl in the Scala archive). We find that Nelly Caron<br/>and Dariouche Safvate describe one style of tuning, Hormoz Farhat<br/>another, and Dariush Tala&grave;i yet another. An instrument with fewer<br/>notes per octave like the Persian santur also illustrates the<br/>technique of customizing a tuning to fit a given family of<br/>modes used in a performance -- with retuning to fit a different<br/>modal family.</p><p>Secondly, irregular temperaments can be very attractive for<br/>beginners as well as more experienced students of alternative<br/>tunings, with George Secor&apos;s 17-note well-temperament (17-WT) as<br/>a fine example.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/Secor17puzzle.pdf">http://anaphoria.com/Secor17puzzle.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>Third, focusing on the types or &quot;families&quot; of intervals a tuning<br/>supports may often be more easily and quickly comprehensible than<br/>starting with a list of the commas tempered out or observed ==<br/>although both, naturally, may be of some interest.</p><p>For example, &quot;at this location we have a small neutral seventh<br/>around 1037 cents, somewhere between 20/11 at 1035 cents and<br/>51/28 at 1038 cents&quot; might be more immediately understandable to<br/>many people than &quot;this tuning effectively disregards the<br/>561/560.&quot; Of course, the comparison of 20/11 and 51/28 might<br/>engage one&apos;s curiosity as to the distinction between these<br/>ratios, leading one to the 561/560 -- but starting with the<br/>interval of 1037 cents actually there (nicely suited for a<br/>Turkish Maqam Segah, for example) might be a &quot;user-friendly&quot;<br/>approach, although simply listing the commas might be<br/>&quot;expert-friendly&quot; in certain circles.</p><p>Also, both beginners and more experienced people in our area may<br/>want to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of tempering out a<br/>given comma. For maqam music, I would far rather observe the<br/>243/242 or equivalent (27/22 vs. 11/9, or 12/11 vs. 88/81) than<br/>temper it out, because traditional musicians relish the subtle<br/>distinctions between larger and smaller neutral intervals, even<br/>if some instruments tend toward 24-ED2.</p><p>Similarly, while one opinion holds that it&apos;s a disadvantage to<br/>require 21/16 in a chain of fourths to get a septimal ratio like<br/>7/3, I find that 9:12:16:21 is quite delicious! Someone sharing<br/>my tastes might still, of course, want enough notes per octave so<br/>as to have 4/3 as well as 21/16 available at a good number of<br/>locations.</p><p>In short, I would consider the regular mapping paradigm as one<br/>interesting approach, together with various types of irregular<br/>temperaments, not to mention just intonation systems. For<br/>beginners and others, which direction you are moving in may<br/>influence your chosen tools for description and analysis.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
