He<br/>notes that players of the &quot;common&quot; chromatic harpsichords can play<br/>D#-F#-A# with the minor third instead, while a performance on a larger<br/>instrument like Stella&apos;s or Colonna&apos;s 31-note keyboards could play the<br/>version with the major third.</p><p>Incidentally, as a curiosity, I might add that one could play the<br/>sonority with the major third in either of Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo<br/>tunings -- D#-F##-A# (or D#-Gb*-A# in Vicentino&apos;s spelling, with the *<br/>raising a note by a diesis) in his first tuning with the 31-note<br/>cycle, and D#-F##&apos;-A# in his second or adaptive JI tuning. Here the<br/>trick is that while the lower manual has a Gb-B# range (like a 19-note<br/>chromatic harpsichord of around 1600), the upper manual is tuned in<br/>&quot;perfect fifths&quot; -- so we have B#-F##&apos; (F##&apos; a quartercomma higher<br/>than the usual meantone F##).</p><p>With both Vicentino and Colonna, we have a situation where they<br/>specifically described their instruments as dividing a tone into five<br/>presumably equal dieses -- very much fitting 31-tET. At the same time,<br/>one could argue that Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI system suggests<br/>1/4-comma, and that in 1618, Colonna would have found it much easier<br/>to tune 1/4-comma by ear than to make the adjustments needed for<br/>31-tET.</p><p>Maybe we could just say &quot;19-tone-cycle&quot; or &quot;31-tone-cycle&quot; -- and I&apos;d<br/>place Trabaci, along with Vicentino and Colonna, in the 31 category.</p><p>By the way, we can place expressive chromaticism and enharmonicism on<br/>the list of advantages for meantone, and I much agree with comments<br/>you&apos;ve made about the fitting quality of these tunings in a<br/>Renaissance or Manneristic kind of style.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/2001 7:05:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Joe Pehrson, and before getting into 31-tET and<br/>1/4-comma meantone, please let me congratulate you on your Moscow trip<br/>as reported in the new issue of TMA, and thank you for being such a<br/>microtonal ambassador of goodwill to a country with its own<br/>fascinating microtonal and &quot;ultrachromatic&quot; traditions.</p><p>----------------------------------------<br/>1. Paul Erlich&apos;s point: thinking &quot;5 + 2&quot;<br/>----------------------------------------</p><p>Please let me open by saying that Paul Erlich has made a very<br/>important point, one that makes my own explanation maybe a bit<br/>simpler.</p><p>In tunings based on 12n-tET, it&apos;s natural to take as an automatic<br/>assumption that six whole-tones equal a pure 2:1 octave.</p><p>However, for other tuning systems involving the diatonic scale, and<br/>very specifically for the systems of Gothic and Renaissance Europe and<br/>current offshoots, I&apos;d echo Paul&apos;s wise advice: &quot;Think 5 plus 2!&quot;</p><p>That is, think of an octave as 5 tones and 2 semitones. I tend to<br/>write &quot;5T + 2S&quot;; you can go by &quot;5L + 2s&quot; (&quot;five large, two small&quot;), or<br/>any other notation you like, but the basic rule is a very important<br/>one.</p><p>Incidentally, if you find the idea that &quot;six tones equals an octave&quot;<br/>is an attractive one, you&apos;re not alone historically either: this<br/>opinion was associated in medieval times with Aristoxenos, whatever<br/>the actual nature of his tuning systems, and some theorists pointed<br/>out how it did not hold under Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>Before getting into 31-tET and 31-note meantone with pure major thirds<br/>(1/4-comma), let&apos;s quickly consider why 5 + 2 is the way to go.</p><p>If six tones are equal to a 2:1 octave -- and here we&apos;re talking about<br/>&quot;eventone&quot; tunings where all regular whole-tones have the same size --<br/>then a tone must be equal to precisely 1/6 octave, or 200 cents.</p><p>However, it&apos;s easy to show that for any Gothic or neo-Gothic eventone,<br/>Pythagorean tuning or a modern temperament with fifths wider than<br/>pure, a tone will be larger than 200 cents -- about 204 cents in<br/>Pythagorean (9:8), 207 cents in 29-tET, 212 cents in 17-tET, or 218<br/>cents in 22-tET, etc. Thus six of these tones will be _larger_ than an<br/>octave.</p><p>How about Renaissance meantones, another form of eventone tuning? Here<br/>we find that the tones of these tunings are _smaller_ than 200 cents,<br/>for example around 193 cents for 1/4-comma or 31-tET. Thus six of<br/>these tones will be _smaller_ than an octave.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Positive and negative tunings: prelude to the &quot;31&quot; systems<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In fact, this basic difference has given rise to one very useful<br/>method for classifying these regular diatonic tunings. If a system has<br/>a whole tone larger than 200 cents, so that six whole-tones exceed an<br/>octave, we call it a _positive_ tuning. If the tones are smaller than<br/>200 cents, so that six fall short of an octave, then it is a<br/>_negative_ system.</p><p>From this viewpoint, we could describe 12n-tET, where six tones are<br/>precisely equal to a 2:1 octave or 1200 cents, as the limit of either<br/>a positive or a negative tuning.</p><p>With Renaissance meantones, we&apos;re talking about negative tunings.<br/>Here there are two more general points to note before we get into the<br/>&quot;31&quot; tunings, 31-tET or 1/4-comma.</p><p>Since five tones plus two semitones equal an octave in any eventone<br/>tuning, and six tones are _less_ than an octave in a negative tuning<br/>such as a Renaissance meantone, this tells us something interesting.<br/>In this tunings two semitones -- diatonic semitones, that is<br/>(e.g. E-F, B-C) -- make a _larger_ interval than a tone. In other<br/>words, a diatonic semitone is larger than half of a tone.</p><p>In 1/4-comma meantone, for example, a tone is around 193.16 cents --<br/>exactly half of a pure major third at 5:4, or ~386.31 cents. A<br/>diatonic semitone is around 117.11 cents, considerably larger than<br/>half of this tone.</p><p>In 31-tET, as Paul has pointed out, we can use simple fractions. A<br/>diatonic semitone is equal to precisely 3/5-tone, or 3/31 octave.</p><p>Our second general point is that since a diatonic semitone plus a<br/>chromatic semitone make a tone (e.g. F-F#-G), in negative tunings such<br/>as Renaisance meantones the diatonic semitone is larger than the<br/>chromatic semitone.</p><p>In 31-tET, the chromatic semitone F-F# is exactly 2/5-tone, and the<br/>diatonic semitone F#-G 3/5-tone. This makes 5/5-tone, F-G, in all.</p><p>A possible distinction between negative or positive tunings and<br/>12n-tET is that in the former tunings, unequal semitones are<br/>&quot;hard-wired&quot; into the basic diatonic structure, so to speak.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. The simpler case: 31-tET with one flavor of &quot;quark&quot;<br/>------------------------------------------------------</p><p>We can refer to both 31-tET and the almost identical 1/4-comma<br/>meantone as &quot;31-tone&quot; systems, or cycles: 31 notes make a circulating<br/>temperament.</p><p>Please let me emphasize that although 1/4-comma meantone is what I use<br/>myself, often I find it very convenient to count in &quot;fifthtones,&quot;<br/>ignoring the small mathematical asymmetries which only seem relevant<br/>musically in certain special contexts, or for people concerned with<br/>very small distinctions of intonation.</p><p>Thus 31-tET seems a logical place to begin.</p><p>There are various systems for notating the steps of a 31-tone system,<br/>but here for the most part I&apos;ll follow the oldest known, Vicentino&apos;s<br/>of 1555.</p><p>The rules are as follows:</p><p>            A flat (b) lowers a note by 2/5-tone, the chromatic<br/>            semitone of this tuning;</p><p>            A sharp (#) raises a note by the same 2/5-tone;</p><p>            A diesis or fifthtone sign (*) raises a note by<br/>            1/5-tone.</p><p>In 31-tET, the basic &quot;particle&quot; or smallest interval of the system is<br/>the diesis or fifthtone of 1/31-octave or 1/5-tone, about 38.71<br/>cents. The tone consists of 5 such identical &quot;quarks,&quot; and the octave<br/>of 31 such quarks.</p><p>Here&apos;s a 31-tone gamut in 31-tET, moving from C3 to C4 (middle C):</p><p>         T=5            T=5         S=3         T=5<br/>  |---------------|--------------|-------|--------------|<br/>  C3 C* C# Db Db* D D* D# Eb Eb* E E* E# F F* F# Gb Gb* G</p><p>         T=5            T=5         S=3<br/>  |---------------|--------------|-------|<br/> (G) G* G# Ab Ab* A A* A# Bb Bb* B B* B# C4</p><p>Thanking &quot;5 + 2,&quot; we confirm that five tones of 5 &quot;quarks&quot; each, plus<br/>two semitones of 3 quarks each, add up to 31 equal quarks per octave,<br/>as advertised.</p><p>Incidentally, while I find Vicentino&apos;s diesis or fifthtone sign very<br/>convenient, we can also write this system using only flats and sharps:</p><p>          T=5            T=5          S=3         T=5<br/>  |----------------|---------------|-------|---------------|<br/>  C3 Dbb C# Db C## D Ebb D# Eb D## E Fb E# F Gbb F# Gb F## G</p><p>          T=5             T=5         S=3<br/>  |----------------|---------------|-------|<br/> (G) Abb G# Ab G## A Bbb A# Bb A## B Cb B# C4</p><p>Note that a double flat lowers a note by 4/5 tone (e.g. Dbb), while a<br/>double sharp raises it by 4/5-tone (e.g. C##).</p><p>Personally I find the idea of C*, the note a diesis or 1/5-tone higher<br/>than C, usually more intuitive than Dbb, the note 4/5-tone lower than<br/>D; but each concept can have its uses.</p><p>The important point is that C*=Dbb, and so forth, precisely and<br/>symmetrically: our 31 quarks, or fifthtones, are identical in size.</p><p>Now we come to 1/4-comma meantone, which as a 31-tone system often<br/>very conveniently fits this model for lots of practical purposes, but<br/>has its asymmetries on a fine scale.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------<br/>3. A 1/4-comma meantone cycle: two flavors of quarks<br/>----------------------------------------------------</p><p>For maybe 95% of practical musical purposes, we can regard a 31-note<br/>cycle of 1/4-comma meantone as conceptually identical to 31-tET; each<br/>tone is divided into &quot;roughly equal&quot; fifthtones, 31 of which make an<br/>octave.</p><p>At a fine scale, however, we find that this model is useful but<br/>approximate, just as the Earth is _almost_ a sphere, but in fact more<br/>like a pear with slight asymmetries. This doesn&apos;t prevent anyone from<br/>circumnavigating it -- either the Earth, or a circulating 31-tone<br/>version of 1/4-comma meantone.</p><p>For the most part, we can use Vicentino&apos;s notation for either system;<br/>and people still debate exactly how his own instruments were tuned.<br/>His own instructions call for a common-practice tuning of the first 12<br/>or 19 notes of his 31-note cycle, with 1/4-comma meantone appearing<br/>(at least to me) a likelier interpretation than a systematic procedure<br/>for 31-tET which might be difficult to tune by ear.</p><p>To show the _precise_ intonational structure of 1/4-comma meantone,<br/>however, we may conveniently introduce a new symbol to Vicentino&apos;s<br/>very useful notation. Let&apos;s first consider the asymmetry involved, and<br/>then the new symbol to show this asymmetry in action.</p><p>In 1/4-comma meantone, as mentioned above, a whole-tone is equal to<br/>precisely half of a 5:4 major third, about 193.16 cents; and a<br/>diatonic semitone to about 117.11 cents. The difference between these<br/>two intervals is the chromatic semitone of around 76.05 cents.</p><p>One way of defining a fifthtone in this system is through the diesis,<br/>the difference in size between these two semitones. As it happens,<br/>this type of fifthtone has a ratio of precisely 128:125, or ~41.06<br/>cents.</p><p>Let&apos;s, for our present purposes, define our diesis sign (*) as raising<br/>a note specifically by this diesis, a rounded 41 cents.</p><p>As it happens, this diesis is also the amount by which 12 fifths fall<br/>short of 7 pure octaves -- or six tones fall short of one such octave<br/>(this is a negative tuning).</p><p>This means that the diesis is equal to the interval we get by moving<br/>12 fifths _down_, or in the flat direction, on the tuning circle.</p><p>To build the whole 31-note cycle, we need 30 such fifths in all. One<br/>approach is to have 15 fifths down from C, and another 15 fifths up<br/>from C. Let&apos;s arbitrarily build our gamut in that way.</p><p>Here we&apos;ll find an extra symbol helpful, one actually familiar from<br/>some modern notation systems: the double sharp abbreviated as &quot;x&quot;. For<br/>our purposes, this symbol raises a note by _two chromatic semitones_,<br/>or about 152.1 cents.</p><p>Using Vicentino&apos;s signs, plus this &quot;x,&quot; here&apos;s the part of our 31-note<br/>meantone gamut between C and D, with C* identical to Dbb (12 fifths<br/>down from C):</p><p>      (Dbb)<br/>C       C*      C#      Db      Cx      D<br/>0       41      76      117    152     193<br/>   LF       SF     LF       SF      LF<br/>   41       35     41       35      41</p><p>The important point here is that in our 1/4-comma meantone cycle, we<br/>have _two_ distinct flavors of fifthtone &quot;quarks,&quot; rather than one as<br/>in 31-tET. Instead of every quark at 1/31 octave, or ~38.71 cents, we<br/>have two distinct sizes around 41 cents and 35 cents.</p><p>We can prove this by noting that C-C#, a chromatic semitone, is a<br/>rounded 76 cents; C-C*, or C-Dbb on the circle of fifths, is a 41-cent<br/>diesis. This means that the remaning interval of C*-C# must be equal<br/>to the difference between chromatic semitone and diesis, 35 cents or<br/>so.</p><p>More precisely, this &quot;small fifthtone&quot; is equal to about 34.99 cents.<br/>People who like superparticular approximations may note that this is<br/>very close to 50:49.</p><p>Anyway, the basic pattern to note is that a chromatic semitone<br/>consists of a large fifthtone (LF) plus a small fifthtone (SF), or as we<br/>might abbreviate, LF + SF.</p><p>Since a diatonic semitone equals a chromatic semitone plus a diesis<br/>(e.g. C-C#-Db), the latter identical to our LF, that means that a<br/>diatonic semitone is equal to two large fifthtones plus one small<br/>fifthtone (2 LF + SF).</p><p>Now let&apos;s look at our complete 31-note gamut:</p><p>       T=~193.16          T=~193.16       S=~117.11      T=~193.16<br/>|-------------------|--------------------|----------|------------------|<br/>C3  C*  C#  Db  Cx  D   D*  D#  Eb  Eb*  E  E*  E#  F  F*  F#  Gb  Fx  G<br/>  LF  SF  LF  SF  LF  LF  SF  LF  LF  SF  LF  SF  LF LF  SF  LF  SF  LF</p><p>       T=~193.16           T=~193.16        S=117.11<br/>|--------------------|--------------------|----------|<br/>(G)  G*  G#  Ab  Gx  A   A*  A#  Bb  Bb*  B  B*  B#  C4<br/>   LF  SF  LF  SF  LF  LF  SF  LF  LF   SF LF  SF  LF</p><p>If we break our octave down into the smallest intervals or particles<br/>of the tuning, or large and small &quot;quarks&quot; or fifthtones, then we have<br/>19 large fifthtones and 12 small fifthtones (19 LF + 12 SF). This<br/>makes 31 in all, showing the kinship to 31-tET with its single uniform<br/>size of quark or fifthtone.</p><p>-------------------------------------------<br/>4. Regular and &quot;odd&quot; intervals -- in quarks<br/>-------------------------------------------</p><p>Here are some intervals expressed in terms of their constituent<br/>&quot;quarks,&quot; with T for whole-tone, S for diatonic semitone, and C for<br/>chromatic semitone:</p><p>                    8 = 19 LF + 12 SF<br/>                    5 = 11 LF +  7 SF<br/>                    4 =  8 LF +  5 SF<br/>                    T =  3 LF +  2 SF<br/>                    S =  2 LF +  1 SF<br/>                    C =  1 LF +  1 SF<br/>                   M3 =  6 LF +  4 SF<br/>                   m3 =  5 LF +  3 SF</p><p>You may recall that in some earlier messages, we discussed the slight<br/>asymmetries which occur in certain concords in this 31-note cycle, and<br/>our analysis of flavors of &quot;quarks&quot; can show where these &quot;odd&quot;<br/>intervals occur -- quite musically acceptable, but what we might call<br/>variations on the regular sizes of fifths and thirds, etc.</p><p>To find where these intervals occur, we might consider the chain of<br/>fifths in this 31-note cycle. Here I&apos;ll give both the 31-note notation<br/>above, and conventional spellings for the notes on the flat side of Gb:</p><p>Eb*  Bb*  F*  C*  G*  D*  A*  E*  B*  Gb  Db  Ab  Eb  Bb  F  C<br/>Fbb  Cbb  Gbb Dbb Abb Ebb Bbb Fb  Cb</p><p>(C)  G   D   A   E   B   F#  C#  G#  A#  E#  B#  Fx  Cx  Gx</p><p>Here the extreme notes of the chain are Eb* or Dbb, and Gx.</p><p>Note that the interval Gx-Eb*, or Gx-Fbb, is here something other than<br/>a regular fifth, for example Gx-Dx (the next sharpward fifth in the<br/>chain). Let&apos;s look again at our 31-note gamut showing the &quot;quarks.&quot;<br/>Since the range of the diagram is C-C, we might find it more<br/>convenient to focus on the fourth Eb*-Gx, or Fbb-Gx.</p><p>       T=~193.16          T=~193.16      S=~117.11       T=~193.16<br/>|-------------------|-------------------|----------|------------------|<br/>C3  C*  C#  Db  Cx  D   D*  D#  Eb  Eb* E  E*  E#  F  F*  F#  Gb  Fx  G<br/>  LF  SF  LF  SF  LF  LF  SF  LF  LF  SF LF  SF  LF LF  SF  LF  SF  LF</p><p>       T=~193.16           T=~193.16        S=117.11<br/>|--------------------|--------------------|----------|<br/>(G)  G*  G#  Ab  Gx  A   A*  A#  Bb  Bb*  B  B*  B#  C4<br/>   LF  SF  LF  SF  LF  LF  SF  LF  LF   SF LF  SF  LF</p><p>A regular fourth should have 8 LF + 5 SF; taking these quarks as a<br/>rounded 41 cents and 35 cents, this gives us (41*8 + 35*5) or 503<br/>cents -- more precisely, about 503.42 cents.</p><p>However, counting the quarks from Eb* to Gx, we actually get an<br/>interval of 7 LF + 6 SF, or around (41*7 + 35*6) or 497 cents -- more<br/>precisely, about 497.35 cents.</p><p>This near-pure fourth is smaller than a usual tempered one by the<br/>difference between the two sizes of quarks -- about 6.07 cents.</p><p>How about an &quot;odd&quot; major third, a bit different in size than the<br/>regular 5:4 which defines this temperament? Let&apos;s try such a third<br/>starting from Gx.</p><p>To get a regular major third, we might look for the spelling Gx-Bx.<br/>In 31-tET, we could define the &quot;x&quot; sign or double sharp as raising a<br/>note by precisely 4/5-tone, so that Gx would be identical to Ab*, and<br/>Bx would be four &quot;quarks&quot; or scale steps above B.</p><p>Since B-C is a diatonic semitone -- precisely 3/5-tone, or three equal<br/>quarks, in 31-tET -- Bx as a 31-tET step would be one quark higher,<br/>identical to C* or Dbb.</p><p>Let&apos;s see what happens when we try the major third Gx-C* in our<br/>1/4-comma meantone cycle.</p><p>In this meantone, as in any eventone tuning (e.g. Pythagorean), a<br/>regular major third is equal to two tones. Since our tone is here<br/>equal to 3 LF + 2 SF, such a major third will have 6 LF + 4 SF, or<br/>a rounded (6*41 + 4*35) or 386 cents -- our expected pure 5:4.</p><p>However, from Gx-C* we actually find 7 LF + 3 SF, making the interval<br/>about 6.07 cents larger than pure -- about 392 cents, or more<br/>precisely around 392.38 cents.</p><p>How about an odd minor third? Here we might look for such an interval<br/>at F*-Gx, where a regular spelling would be Ex-Gx.</p><p>In 31-tET, where Ex is defined as the step four equal quarks above E,<br/>we have E-E*-E#-F-F*; adding one more quark, F*-F#, would give us five<br/>in all, the regular tone E-F#.</p><p>In our 1/4-comma temperament, as in any meantone (or more generally<br/>any eventone), a regular minor third consists of a tone plus a<br/>diatonic semitone, or T + S. This gives us an expected 5 LF + 3 SF, or<br/>about (5*41 + 3*35) or 310 cents, more precisely around 310.26 cents.</p><p>Moving from F* to Gx, however, we find 4 LF + 4 SF, an interval of<br/>around (41*4 + 35*4) or 304 cents -- more precisely, about 304.20<br/>cents.</p><p>While counting quarks along our gamut is one way to keep track of the<br/>sizes of these intervals, we could also calculate these sizes from the<br/>accidentals, either by dividing the interval into any convenient set<br/>of steps, or by comparing the pitch heights of the notes by reference<br/>to any convenient point on the gamut.</p><p>A few definitions of notational signs in terms of cents may be<br/>helpful:</p><p>               a flat (b) lowers a note by a chromatic semitone<br/>               of ~76.05 cents;</p><p>               a sharp (#) raises it by the same ~76.05 cents;</p><p>               a diesis (*) raises it by a large fifthtone (LF)<br/>               of ~41.06 cents;</p><p>               a double sharp (x) raises it by two sharps or<br/>               chromatic semitones, ~152.10 cents.</p><p>For example, for F*-Gx we could divide this into steps of F*-F#-G-Gx.<br/>Here F*-F# is a small fifthtone of around 35 cents; F#-G a diatonic<br/>semitone of around 117 cents; and G-Gx a double sharp equal to two<br/>chromatic semitones, or about 152 cents. We get about 304 cents in<br/>all. Incidentally, we describe this slightly smaller minor third as a<br/>&quot;tetrachroma,&quot; equal precisely to four chromatic semitones of ~76.05<br/>cents each.</p><p>How about our slightly larger major third Gx-C*?</p><p>Here we could try Gx-A-C-C*. The step Gx-A is a large fifthtone or<br/>diesis of about 41 cents; A-C, a regular minor third around 310 cents;<br/>and C-C* another large or 41-cent fifthtone, for about 392 cents in<br/>all.</p><p>How about using pitch heights, for example from C? For F*-Gx, we find<br/>that F* has a distance from the C below equal to a usual meantone<br/>fourth at a rounded 503 cents plus a 41-cent diesis (C-F-F*), or about<br/>544 cents. We can consider C-Gx as C-G-Gx, a meantone fifth at a<br/>rounded 697 cents plus a 152-cent double sharp, or about 849 cents.<br/>The difference of (849 - 544) gives 305 cents, quite close to ~304.20<br/>cents.</p><p>For Gx3-C*4, we again find that C3-G3-Gx3 gives about 849 cents;<br/>C3-C*4 is an octave plus a 41-cent diesis, or around 1241 cents. The<br/>difference of (1241 - 849) gives us an estimate of 392 cents, close to<br/>the ~392.38 cents of this slightly large major third.</p><p>----------------------------------<br/>5. In practice -- a bit of balance<br/>----------------------------------</p><p>Because the topic of 31-tET and 31-note meantone is often raised, but<br/>not so often presented so as to examine the slightly unequal<br/>fifthtones of the latter tuning, I would like to emphasize a<br/>conclusion stated by Ivor Darreg and others: for most practical<br/>purposes, we can disregard the distinctions and happily perform,<br/>improvise, or compose in either of these 31-tone systems.</p><p>Here we might note especially that the asymmetries most notably effect<br/>only a few intervals at the extreme of a 31-note cycle -- one fifth,<br/>four major thirds, and three minor thirds.</p><p>As Paul might quip, this doesn&apos;t mean that there wouldn&apos;t be any<br/>tangible differences: one fifth in the 1/4-comma cycle would be<br/>notably almost pure among the all the others a bit more than 5 cents<br/>narrow.</p><p>The &quot;odd&quot; major and minor thirds might also be noticeable -- but the<br/>variations of ~6.07 cents are still quite small by comparison with an<br/>18th-century well-temperament, for example.</p><p>If we seek an &quot;operational definition&quot; of the distinction in 1555 or<br/>1618 between tuning &quot;1/4-comma meantone&quot; or &quot;31-tET,&quot; it might be<br/>this: were major thirds deliberately made pure, or were they<br/>deliberately and very slightly tempered in the wide direction to get<br/>more even fifthtones?</p><p>This may be a moot question, because the instructions of which I know<br/>about from Vicentino and Colonna simply say that the first 12 or 19<br/>notes are tuned as in good common practice. There is no explicit<br/>mention of pure major thirds, or of slightly compromising such thirds<br/>to get a more uniform tuning circle.</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s fifthtone arithmetic suggests 31-tET -- which is how Lemme<br/>Rossi (1666) interprets the system, giving string lengths accurate to<br/>around a tenth of a cent.</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI tuning, in contrast, tends to suggest pure<br/>regular major thirds, and somehow such a system seems more congenial<br/>to tuning by ear -- Zarlino comments that 1/4-comma meantone is &quot;not<br/>very difficult to do.&quot;</p><p>There is a curious passage in the famous treatise of Salinas (1577)<br/>discussing an archicembalo dividing each tone into five parts, and<br/>discussing the sizes of the dieses. Possibly this passage might be<br/>relevant to the kind of &quot;1/4-comma vs. 31-tET&quot; distinction we are<br/>considering.</p><p>By 1666, Rossi makes it clear that at least some theorists are making<br/>this distinction; in the Vicentino-Colonna era, the question of such a<br/>conceptual distinction remains an open one.</p><p>Here the term &quot;31-note cycle&quot; may communicate a useful ambiguity,<br/>describing a circulating tuning with &quot;virtually equal&quot; fifthtones<br/>while leaving open the issues of precise purity of major thirds, or<br/>symmetry of temperament.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>8/15/2001 1:36:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27033">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27033</a></p><p>&gt; Hello, there, Joe Pehrson, and before getting into 31-tET and<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma meantone, please let me congratulate you on your Moscow<br/>trip<br/>&gt; as reported in the new issue of TMA, and thank you for being such a<br/>&gt; microtonal ambassador of goodwill to a country with its own<br/>&gt; fascinating microtonal and &quot;ultrachromatic&quot; traditions.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thank you very much, Margo, for your good wishes and, also, for your<br/>interesting post on the various step sizes in 31-note scales...</p><p>It was a particularly good approach to *begin* with 31-tET in your<br/>post, where the step sizes are all equal to the case of 31 notes of<br/>1/4 comma meantone, where the fifthtones differ in size.</p><p>This very much helped me understand your previous post, where you<br/>describe major thirds which are actually 6 cents off in a 31 tone 1/4<br/>comma meantone tuning, where, supposedly, they should be just...</p><p>I was a little &quot;mystified&quot; as to why the various step sizes of the<br/>fifthtones in the 31 tone tuning fell as they did in the scale.
