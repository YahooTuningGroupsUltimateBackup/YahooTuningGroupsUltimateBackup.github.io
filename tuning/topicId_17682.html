The old cats didn&apos;t necessarily stay<br/>&gt; on a strict form, tune their instruments, agree on how much (or how little)<br/>&gt; swing on the eighth notes, and had systemic disagreements on what the chords<br/>&gt; were to certain sections (I mean systemic in that every time a certain point<br/>&gt; of the song comes up, the guitarist, and he alone, strums the IV chord in a<br/>&gt; sort of blurry polytonality).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But MAN does that stuff express. Music poured out of the soul.</p><p>I love that poly chordal stuff. Also the non-metrical nature of the chord<br/>changes. I had the good fortune a number of years ago to accompany country<br/>bluesman John Jackson for a few sets at a festival. I was scrambling all<br/>over the first set, trying not to get in the way while keeping up with chord<br/>changes happening either earlier or later than the 12 bar format. By the end<br/>of the weekend, I was recognizing the consistency of these changes, and was<br/>noticing that they had their internal rhyme and reason in the way that they<br/>followed and supported the lyrics. It was a great education to &apos;real&apos; blues,<br/>as opposed to a watered down, twelve bar I, IV, V version. Some of the<br/>greatest tunes never go to the V at all, lots of songs sound really great<br/>not bothering with the IV either.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. In the musics I was mentioning you certainly have many simultaneous<br/>&gt; definitions for the thirds and sevenths. Maybe there is a groove or swing<br/>&gt; for tuning as there is for rhythm.</p><p>I think this is true, and worth looking at in depth.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve been thinking of &apos;World Music&apos; these days. I like the more traditional<br/>&gt; &apos;field recordings&apos;. Then I was listenning to a few recordings of U.S. bar<br/>&gt; bands and realized that these too were &apos;field recordings&apos;, with the field<br/>&gt; being the US. [The recordings were Jimmy Rivers and the Cherokees<br/>&gt; which was a great Honky-Tonk swing band in Texas, Danny Gatton live at a<br/>&gt; bar in D.C. and Eric Dolphy live at the 5 Spot, where absolute geniuses<br/>&gt; are playing for about twenty drinkning patrons].</p><p>Most of my favorite world music is either field recordings, or reissues of<br/>old 78s.</p><p>Seth<br/>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>email; <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a></p><p>&quot;Music is far, far older than our species.
