Consistency<br/>does not apply to scales within an ET, it applies to consonant harmonies<br/>within an ET. Intervals like 15/8 and 32/27 are not consonances within the<br/>13-limit, let alone the 5-limit, so the quality of their approximation is<br/>irrelevant. If you&apos;d like to use 15/8 as a consonance, you&apos;re at the<br/>15-limit at least, so 26-equal is inconsistent. Moreover, the 32/27 in the<br/>&quot;standard JI major scale&quot; is more a defect than something you&apos;d like to<br/>accurately approximate.</p><p>Consistency is really intended as a check against the kind of errors Wendy<br/>Carlos and Yunik and Swift made -- evaluating how well JI intervals are<br/>approximated without bothering to check whether those approximations &quot;fit&quot;<br/>with one another. Yunik and Swift liked 19-equal&apos;s approximations of<br/>13-limit intervals, but those approximations are incompatible!</p></div>
