Thanks for the appropriate terminology, Paul.</p><p>And Paul Erlich offered:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jerry, I suspect you&apos;re operating under a serious misconception here. Our<br/>&gt; ears and brains are remarkably oblivious to phase, and the kind of &quot;lining<br/>&gt; up&quot; you&apos;re talking about, even if you could come up with a mathematical<br/>&gt; definition of such a thing (there&apos;s a challenge), would have virtually no<br/>&gt; effect on any audible characteristics of the sound. So I believe it&apos;s<br/>&gt; meaningless to say that the ear does anything like what you describe above.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure of the source of your misconception, but it reminds me of<br/>&gt; Robert Asmussen&apos;s web page:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/Studio/rproj_swss/tuning/tuning.htm">http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/Studio/rproj_swss/tuning/tuning.htm</a>. Here he<br/>&gt; makes the error of picturing all tones as sine waves (a very unmusical<br/>&gt; timbre); that makes &quot;lining up&quot; easy to define, but leads to the false<br/>&gt; conclusion that the consonance of simple ratios is somehow enhanced when<br/>&gt; this lining up is done correctly. Though framed as a computer music project,<br/>&gt; Asmussen probably never carried out a comparison with different phases; if<br/>&gt; he did, he surely would have heard no differences.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It may sound like I&apos;m actually supporting your point, Jerry, because if you<br/>&gt; don&apos;t hear a difference, it would seem that the ear must be &quot;lining things<br/>&gt; up&quot; so that no difference arises. But it is simpler, and more in keeping<br/>&gt; with how we understand hearing, to assume that there is no difference<br/>&gt; because we are essentially picking up only the frequencies, and not the<br/>&gt; relative phases of the different frequencies, in the sounds we hear.</p><p>Huh? Are we talking about the same thing? &quot;Hear a difference&quot; of what? I&apos;m<br/>talking about the simple act of hearing an interval--in which the likelihood<br/>of the simultenaity of phase--ebb and flow of compacting and (whatever the<br/>opposite of compacting is)--is extremely small; nevertheless, the ear seems<br/>readily capable of perceiving the &quot;mathematical&quot; ratios. That&apos;s it!</p><p>That our brains are &quot;oblivious of lining up,&quot; is exactly what I&apos;m talking<br/>about. The source of my &quot;misconception&quot; is original with me. (I try not to<br/>store bits of &quot;wisdom&quot; that do not make sense to me.) You _are_ supporting<br/>my point when you say that &quot;we are essentially picking up only the<br/>frequencies.&quot; The interesting(???) point that I was attempting to make is<br/>that we are able to perceive frequencies and compare them to other<br/>frequencies EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT LIKELY TO &quot;LINE UP.&quot; However you would<br/>like to rephrase my point is certainly agreeable to me. And whether you<br/>support it is not material to my meaning. I simply am in awe of nature in<br/>this regard.</p><p>Jerry</p><p>P.S.: This is not the first time I have been described as &quot;operating under a<br/>serious misconception.&quot; However, over the years I&apos;ve learned not to<br/>particularly worry about it.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2000 12:34:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jerry wrote,</p><p>&gt;The interesting(???) point that I was attempting to make is<br/>               that we are able to perceive frequencies and compare<br/>&gt;them to other<br/>               frequencies EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT LIKELY TO &quot;LINE<br/>&gt;UP.&quot; However you would<br/>               like to rephrase my point is certainly agreeable to<br/>me. &gt;And whether you<br/>               support it is not material to my meaning.

An excellent place to start is Juan Roederer&apos;s _Physics<br/>and Psychophysics of Music_.</p><p>Sorry I misunderstood you -- I guess I&apos;m used to thinking of waves in<br/>terms of constituent frequencies due to my training in quantum<br/>mechanics and such. Though from a physical standpoint, the component<br/>frequencies are generally the most relevant feature of a wave, I<br/>should remember that this is less than obvious intuitively, as<br/>evidenced by the fact that civilization had to wait for Fourier to<br/>discover the concept of analyzing a function into component<br/>frequencies.</p></div>
