Sorry, I<br/>didn&apos;t intend to stir up controversy or dissension, but merely to put<br/>his life in context. His death is one of the first things one reads of<br/>in his biography and his fanatical desire to &apos;prove&apos; the Christian<br/>doctrines<br/>by logic is the basis of most of his works. Catholic Church called him a<br/>Doctor Illuminatus and beatified him, but considered his proselytizing<br/>missions so reckless as to be suicidal, which may explain in part why<br/>he has not been canonized. Another account, however. claims he drowned<br/>in Tunis.</p><p>My point in discussing Llull was to refer people to the microtonal music<br/>inspired by<br/>his writings. I don&apos;t know if he wrote anything about music himself.</p><p>Llull also opened the first university in Europe for the study of Arabic<br/>and Chaldean language and culture.</p><p>-John</p><p>--John</p></div>
