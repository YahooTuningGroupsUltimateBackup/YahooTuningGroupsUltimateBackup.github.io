Furthermore, many instruments will exhibit slight inharmonicity such that their second harmonics are sharp as well. This is just an educated guess, but the tendency to prefer sharp octaves might reflect a tendency towards slightly sharp and inharmonic timbres in general. It may mean that not only do humans prefer sharp octaves, but generally prefer stretched timbres all around. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if this were true in general.</p><p>Either way, there&apos;s no point arguing over which one is the &quot;true&quot; octave.

I&apos;ve said that there were/are other people who already have made instruments tuned to stretched-octave temperaments and you should probably find some info on that to possibly avoid double work.<br/>#2. I&apos;m not saying I don&apos;t know what an equal division is or what a 12th root is. I&apos;m saying that you&apos;re once again describing the intervals using decimal representations of the factors. I&apos;m sorry to bring up this topic once again, but you seem to be the only person on the tuning list who does this. There are three other ways of describing intervals:<br/>- A) there are exponents of prime numbers,<br/>- B) there are cents,<br/>- C) there are ratios.<br/>Now let&apos;s compare these:<br/>- A) Prime exponents clearly tell us what interval it is (i.e. how it was found) but they make it difficult to recognize how large it is from simply looking at the numbers.<br/>- B) Cents say very clearly how large it is but they contain absolutely no information at all about what it is (i.e. how we got it).<br/>- C) Ratios can tell us what it is and with a bit of learning also roughly how large it is.<br/>- D) Your decimal numbers also don&apos;t contain any information about what it is and they also don&apos;t tell me much how large it is. What&apos;s more, if you want to stack intervals upon each other, decimal factors have to be multiplied and divided; in contrast, prime exponents or cents are added or subtracted, which corresponds to the way we understand intervals.<br/>Honestly, in my personal calculations, I often alternate among three different methods of interval description (i.e. prime exponents, cents, and ratios) and I&apos;ve been able to describe every possible interval that I have ever thought of. So why should I use one more if it&apos;s no better than the other three? It&apos;s a bit like learning a foreign language spoken by just a few people in the world. If a person who speaks S&aacute;mi comes to a country where most people speak English, will those people suddenly start learning S&aacute;mi if that language is spoken by about 30,000 people? Of course not.<br/>Petr</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/1/2011 9:05:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Aug 1, 2011 at 8:04 PM, Mario Pizarro &lt;piagui@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Mike wrote that most humans prefer &nbsp;stretched octaves, I agree with him when he<br/>&gt; explained that numbers like 2 or 2.00678700656 are simple numbers.

Since the progression comprises 6 groups, the total number of cells equals 104 x 6 =<br/>     624 cells.</p><p>     Cell # 612 .= 2 is the octave of the equal tempered scale and is aligned to the third comma of group JMM.<br/>     If we analyze the commas distribution along the progression of cells, we can verify that most of them take<br/>     part in successive groups of M*M* J * J*M* M and that the third comma of either the group MMJ or JJM is<br/>     always aligned to one of the many classic cells that lie in the progression like 9/8, (9/8)^n, 2^(n/2), 3/2,<br/>     (4/3), (45/32), (15/8), (16/9), (27/16), 2, ...etc.</p><p>     The stretched octave should also be considered a classic cell so it is one of the three frequencies that lie<br/>     in Segment Q column shown in the table, which are signaled by cell frequencies # 609, # 612 and # 615<br/>     that are aligned to the third commas (J, M, J) given in the first column of table.</p><p>     In the period 1947 to 1967, Juli&iuml;&iquest;&half;n Carrillo has demonstrated  that the physical octave is not 2 but a slightly<br/>     higher than the 2 ratio.</p><p>     Therefore, the correct octave is given by cell # 615 = 2.00678700656 = 1205.865 cents</p><p>       Cell # SEGMENT Q SQ.

What&apos;s MMJ JMM? What are the Cells?  And wouldn&apos;t Cell 614 be flatter than an octave ...?</p><p>As it&apos;s quiet here, I&apos;ll post my summary of what I&apos;ve managed to glean about this (actually I wrote this about a year ago):</p><p>--------------<br/>1) In case it is not obvious, the 612 &quot;cells&quot; are simply 612 different notes, within the octave, relative to an origin or 1/1 note.  To me, this is reminiscent of the Indian system, where 22 notes forming JI ratios with the origin are derived by the three different sruti sizes occurring in the right order.  In Mario&apos;s case there are three much smaller &quot;sruti&quot; (M, J, U) and hence many more notes before the octave is reached.  Note also that in the Indian system the sruti are formed of integer powers of 2, 3 and 5, but in Mario&apos;s system two of them contain fractional powers of 2 or 3.</p><p>2) Mario says that the system is derived using mathematical principles, but I am not sure what they are.  However, we can see a number of features in the 612 note set.  The 22 Indian notes are all there, and many more notes from the extended &quot;5-limit JI lattice&quot; formed by combining the 2:3 and the 4:5 interval in familiar ways.  For example, the Pythagorean diatonic scale is found in cells: (0,) 104, 208, 254, 358, 462, 566, 612; and the JI syntonic scale in (0,) 104, 197, 254, 358, 451, 555, 612.</p><p>3) However, in between these &quot;just&quot; intervals there are other positions with fractional powers of 2 or 3.  They &quot;fill in&quot; the gaps between the more &quot;just&quot; values.  They include the cells 153, 306, 459, which together with 612 (=0) split the octave precisely into quarters, i.e. they form a diminished 7th chord in 12-tET. (NB the other cells that are multiples of 51 give very close approximations to 12-tET notes, but they are not exact.)  This diminished chord is a feature in the first three Piagui scales.</p><p>4) The three sruti M, J, U are very similar in size, so overall this scheme is very similar to 612-EDO.  However, whereas in 612-EDO the JI ratios are approximated, (e.g. 2^(197/612) approx 4:5; 2^(358/612) approx 2:3), in Mario&apos;s scheme they are exact (e.g cell 197 = 4:5; cell 358 = 2:3).</p><p>5) Because the division of the octave is unequal, this means that a constant number of sruti does not always equal the same interval - it depends where you start and end (just as in the Indian system).  So we can say that often, but not always, 197sruti=4:5, 358sruti=2:3, 104sruti=8:9, 58sruti=2048:2187, 46sruti=243:256, 12sruti=Pythagorean comma, 11sruti=syntonic comma, 21sruti=diesis, 1sruti=schisma.  More precisely, we can express any interval in terms of the number of M, J, U it contains, as a vector.  For the intervals in this paragraph, the vectors are (121,68,8), (220,124,14), (64,36,4), (36,20,2), (28,16,2), (8,4,0), (7,4,0), (13,8,0), (1,0,0).  This vector is precise for the interval, but may not be available at every point within the octave.</p><p>6) The smallest repeating pattern in the order of the srutis is that of the 8:9 interval, that consists of 104 srutis (64 M, 36 J, 4 U).  The pattern is also symmetric.  Therefore I suspect that Mario intends the pattern not to repeat after the octave (that is 612 sruti) but after 624 sruti, that is the interval (9/8)^6, a Pythagorean comma greater than one octave.  This is supported by the fact that he says that he has a full set of 88 notes for a piano.  OTOH it is slightly contradicted by the way he describes the sets of 12 notes in Piagui 1, 2, 3.</p><p>--------------</p><p>To answer your questions, MMJJMM is a sequence that occurs often within the full sequence; and cell 612 is the octave so 614 is still bigger.  None of this means that I understand why 615 is special.  In fact I&apos;m still not sure exactly what Carrillo&apos;s result was - even if it is to do with harmonics themselves or with human perception ...</p><p>Steve.</p></div><h3>Mario Pizarro &#x3C;piagui@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2011 6:41:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Steve,</p><p>You can not imagine how happy I feel now after reading your summary.

Since the explanation might take hours due to the complexity of the subject, I wrote &quot;For the present.....&quot;.In every country these three words mean that I asked Mike just to believe me and also believe Steve Martin that the Progression of cells contains the needed data for determining the octave. It has no sense to talk on cell # 614 but cells #609, #612, #615, #618.....#624.

Since I know why cell 615 and not cell 614 is the natural octave, it is expected that not only Mike but also Steve Martin arrive to the same conclussion I arrived. Steve made an analysis of the progression, he also entered to some topics I bypassed. The main step is to understand and recognize that the third comma of MMJ, that is J and the third comma of JMM, that is M, when are seen in the progression tables, are always aligned (placed in the same row) either to a triad tone, a consonant cell like 3/2, 4/3.... or to the musical octave.

I dunno what the ideal stretch<br/>would be, but I also notice I prefer fifths a little sharp (like in<br/>17-equal) and major thirds a little sharp, etc. Then again, flat<br/>intervals can be very relaxing.</p><p>&gt; There are also three questions here: do people like octaves stretched, if so by how much, and do they like them stretched for 12edo?

I&apos;m more suggesting that the evolutionary<br/>response in humans to millenia repeated exposure with harmonic timbres<br/>could have been, for whatever reason, the perfect concordance point<br/>being slightly sharp. No, there&apos;s no need to throw JI away, and I<br/>doubt the difference would be too great to really matter, but no need<br/>to rule it out, especially when we&apos;re seeing weird preferences for<br/>stretched octaves in the literature.</p><p>For the record, I actually did like Mario&apos;s stretched-octave tuning a<br/>lot.

What&apos;s MMJ JMM? What are the Cells?  And wouldn&apos;t Cell 614 be flatter than an octave ...?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As it&apos;s quiet here, I&apos;ll post my summary of what I&apos;ve managed to glean about this (actually I wrote this about a year ago):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --------------<br/>&gt; 1) In case it is not obvious, the 612 &quot;cells&quot; are simply 612 different notes, within the octave, relative to an origin or 1/1 note.  To me, this is reminiscent of the Indian system, where 22 notes forming JI ratios with the origin are derived by the three different sruti sizes occurring in the right order.  In Mario&apos;s case there are three much smaller &quot;sruti&quot; (M, J, U) and hence many more notes before the octave is reached.  Note also that in the Indian system the sruti are formed of integer powers of 2, 3 and 5, but in Mario&apos;s system two of them contain fractional powers of 2 or 3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) Mario says that the system is derived using mathematical principles, but I am not sure what they are.  However, we can see a number of features in the 612 note set.  The 22 Indian notes are all there, and many more notes from the extended &quot;5-limit JI lattice&quot; formed by combining the 2:3 and the 4:5 interval in familiar ways.  For example, the Pythagorean diatonic scale is found in cells: (0,) 104, 208, 254, 358, 462, 566, 612; and the JI syntonic scale in (0,) 104, 197, 254, 358, 451, 555, 612.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) However, in between these &quot;just&quot; intervals there are other positions with fractional powers of 2 or 3.  They &quot;fill in&quot; the gaps between the more &quot;just&quot; values.  They include the cells 153, 306, 459, which together with 612 (=0) split the octave precisely into quarters, i.e. they form a diminished 7th chord in 12-tET. (NB the other cells that are multiples of 51 give very close approximations to 12-tET notes, but they are not exact.)  This diminished chord is a feature in the first three Piagui scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4) The three sruti M, J, U are very similar in size, so overall this scheme is very similar to 612-EDO.  However, whereas in 612-EDO the JI ratios are approximated, (e.g. 2^(197/612) approx 4:5; 2^(358/612) approx 2:3), in Mario&apos;s scheme they are exact (e.g cell 197 = 4:5; cell 358 = 2:3).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5) Because the division of the octave is unequal, this means that a constant number of sruti does not always equal the same interval - it depends where you start and end (just as in the Indian system).  So we can say that often, but not always, 197sruti=4:5, 358sruti=2:3, 104sruti=8:9, 58sruti=2048:2187, 46sruti=243:256, 12sruti=Pythagorean comma, 11sruti=syntonic comma, 21sruti=diesis, 1sruti=schisma.  More precisely, we can express any interval in terms of the number of M, J, U it contains, as a vector.  For the intervals in this paragraph, the vectors are (121,68,8), (220,124,14), (64,36,4), (36,20,2), (28,16,2), (8,4,0), (7,4,0), (13,8,0), (1,0,0).  This vector is precise for the interval, but may not be available at every point within the octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6) The smallest repeating pattern in the order of the srutis is that of the 8:9 interval, that consists of 104 srutis (64 M, 36 J, 4 U).  The pattern is also symmetric.  Therefore I suspect that Mario intends the pattern not to repeat after the octave (that is 612 sruti) but after 624 sruti, that is the interval (9/8)^6, a Pythagorean comma greater than one octave.  This is supported by the fact that he says that he has a full set of 88 notes for a piano.  OTOH it is slightly contradicted by the way he describes the sets of 12 notes in Piagui 1, 2, 3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To answer your questions, MMJJMM is a sequence that occurs often within the full sequence; and cell 612 is the octave so 614 is still bigger.  None of this means that I understand why 615 is special.  In fact I&apos;m still not sure exactly what Carrillo&apos;s result was - even if it is to do with harmonics themselves or with human perception ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Steve.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Mario Pizarro &#x3C;piagui@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2011 4:50:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear fellows,</p><p>Thank you Steve for using your spreadsheet and filing the converted progression in your folder.<br/>Perhaps the following information is useful to you.

This is a &gt; point that I have intended to take up with Mario.  Of course, it may be &gt; that the sequence I have is incorrect, but I am sure I got it from Mario.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 2) Is the sequence just MMJ JMM MMJ JMM etc, forever, alternating?<br/>&gt; A: No; remember that there is a third comma, U, and remember that I &gt; already revealed (tut) that the minimal repeating sequence is of 104 cells &gt; (not a multiple of 3).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; What is the sequence generating the cells?<br/>&gt; Mario may tell you this!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I wonder how to analyze what Mario&apos;s doing as a linear temperament,<br/>&gt;&gt; and if his progression of cells is MOS.<br/>&gt; It can&apos;t be MOS, as there are three different intervals (or is there some &gt; extended definition of MOS I don&apos;t know)?

The point is that, as far as I am aware, you have &gt; done all your work using decimals, which is OK but suffers from rounding &gt; error.  My spreadsheet converts the letters M, J, U to powers of 2, 3 and &gt; 5, and then progressing through the cells can be done without rounding &gt; error - cell 612 is literally calculated as 2^1 * 3^0 * 5^0.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Steve M.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!
