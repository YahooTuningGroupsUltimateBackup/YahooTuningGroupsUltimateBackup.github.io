This is the theory of Indian music.</p><p>On the other hand, in terms of aesthetics, Indian music is the<br/>language of a divine art form, an expression of a creative activity<br/>which brings into form the formless; it is a stupendous act of<br/>harnessing the ecstacy in terms of 22 shruti-s, and gamaka-s, and<br/>alankara-s. Indian music embodies the eternal truth that we can use<br/>the finite (numbers of notes), to reach the Infinite.  It is, verily,<br/>the nada-yoga (the Union through Sound). This relates to the<br/>Aesthetics of Indian music.</p><p>My principle of Heisengerg&apos;s Indeterminancy, as applied to Indian<br/>music, is :<br/>In Indian music, THE THEORY AND THE AESTHETICS CANNOT BE STUDIED<br/>SIMULTANEOUSLY, with sufficient accuracy. A detailed study of only<br/>one of the two is possible, at a time.</p><p>Let us recapitulate the applications of this principle, called the<br/>Principle of Uncertainty (Indeterminancy) put forth by Werner<br/>Heisenberg in 1927, to various fields of study.</p><p>In Physics, it says: &quot;The more precisely the POSITION is determined,<br/>the less precisely the MOMENTUM is known&quot;. If the momentum spectrum<br/>is peaked around a particular value, then so is the spatial<br/>probability density. If the width of the momentum  spectrum is small,<br/>then that of the position spectrum is large, and vice versa.<br/>Heisenberg&apos;s Uncertainty Principle says that in looking at<br/>subatomic particles, we can never know their precise conditions.<br/>(Position, &quot;appearance&quot; and action are all we can ever know of any<br/>&quot;particle&quot;, including humans.) This is Heisenberg&apos;s (position-<br/>momentum) Uncertainty Principle.  In other words,it is in effect<br/>impossible to know both momentum and location or energy and time to<br/>the same accuracy. Whenever, we analyse the location (momentum) of a<br/>particle we are in effect, altering it enough to disturb  the<br/>accuracy of readings of its momentum (position). But it is a lot more<br/>than the problem of energy and location.</p><p>In the studies of the duality of Mind and Matter, the separation by<br/>Descartes of dualism of mind and matter is replaced by a Cartesian<br/>shift.</p><p>The very presence of the experimenter and his measuring instruments<br/>becomes a determining factor in the field of investigation.</p><p>I do not repeat the PC version of the Heisenberg uncertainty<br/>principle; please visit:<br/><a href="http://www.ncns.com/news/2/heisenberg.html">http://www.ncns.com/news/2/heisenberg.html</a></p><p>For the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics and<br/>several well- known concepts in economic theory, please visit:<br/><a href="http://ideas.uqam.ca/ideas/data/Papers/wpawuwpgt9904004.html">http://ideas.uqam.ca/ideas/data/Papers/wpawuwpgt9904004.html</a></p><p>In the field of research and development (R &amp; D), Extended Epstein-<br/>Heisenberg Principle is applied, as examplified in :<br/><a href="http://www2.informatik.uni-erlangen.de:8082/IMMD-II/Services/webmaker-">http://www2.informatik.uni-erlangen.de:8082/IMMD-II/Services/webmaker-</a><br/>1.4/Field_32.html</p><p>In an R &amp; D orbit, only 2 of the existing 3 parameters can be defined<br/>simultaneously. The parameters are: Time, resources ($), and amount<br/>of R &amp; D task completed.</p><p>In the field of environmental studies, on the Northern Great Plains,<br/>the environmental baseline study have invoked the Heisenberg<br/>Principle; please check:<br/><a href="http://www2.informatik.uni-erlangen.de:8082/IMMD-II/Services/webmaker-">http://www2.informatik.uni-erlangen.de:8082/IMMD-II/Services/webmaker-</a><br/>1.4/Field_32.html</p><p>For anyone interested in Qabala: Noun in final (the 50 becomes 700)<br/>is the Principle of Indetermination. The projection of Zayn (7) --<br/>Ayn (70) -- Noun (700) represents the seed or probability amplitude -<br/>probability -- indetermination, the ultimate freedom. In physics,<br/>this is Heisenberg&apos;s Principle without which no universe is possible.<br/>For more, please visit:<br/><a href="http://www.psyche.com/psyche/autiot/noun-final.html">http://www.psyche.com/psyche/autiot/noun-final.html</a></p><p>An extremely intriguing generalisation has been thus arrived at: The<br/>Principle of Incomplete Knowledge.  It states that the model embodied<br/>in a control system is necessarily incomplete.</p><p>For Auto dynamics, the uncertainty principle is a simple question of<br/>knowledge about the infinitesimal world. The uncertainty principle is<br/>only a question of relative levels of energy, separated by many<br/>orders of magnitude.</p><p>To repeat: My principle of Heisengerg&apos;s Indeterminancy, as applied to<br/>Indian music, is :  In Indian music, THE THEORY AND AESTHETICS CANNOT<br/>BE STUDIED SIMULTANEOUSLY, with sufficient accuracy. A detailed study<br/>of only one of the two is possible, at a time.</p><p>The study of the theory (as exemplified by shruti-s,and the like),<br/>and the study of aesthetics (as illustrated in the study and<br/>applications of gamaka-s, alankara-s, alap, taan -- all graces and<br/>embillishments used in improvisation, etc.) , in Indian music, are<br/>complementary, not contradictory. Most certainly, they are not<br/>contraindicated (as at least some Indian musicians seem to believe);<br/>in fact, they are absolutely essential. The study of theory enriches<br/>the aesthetics; the study of aesthetics would empower the theory.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div>
