The Audiospark spring bubbles turquoise track was<br/>awesome. My buddies from school dug that one, probably more because of the 5<br/>vs 4 polyrhythm than anything.

It&apos;s really striking to me how having a consonant whole-tone (i.e. between 180 and 200 cents) seems to be more important in creating consonance than having a major or minor third close to the 5-limit ideal.  For instance, 25-EDO Unfair hits 5/4 within a cent of Just, but the scale sounds like rubbish because the &quot;whole-tone&quot; is around a 13/12.

In my latest scale a vast majority of the &quot;semi-tones&quot; are either 10/9 or 11/10, with only two intervals out of seven not meeting that criteria (12/11 and 13/12).  And believe me, I wish I could find a way to &quot;hack out&quot; that relatively nasty 13/12 (which still comes across to me as more harmonically usable in many more ways on the average than, say, the 15/14 semi-tone in diatonic JI).</p><p>   Specifically the part below gets me<br/>&gt;&quot; It&apos;s really striking to me how having a consonant whole-tone (i.e.<br/>between 180 and 200 cents) seems to be more important in creating<br/>consonance than having a major or minor third close to the 5-limit<br/>ideal.  &quot;<br/>   ...Because it really seems to follow the train of thought I used to create my latest scale...the &quot;guess-timate&quot; that using precision for closer tones like the second and allowing more &quot;non-just-ness&quot; in tones further away (like thirds) to achieve that is a good way to go if you want to improve the scale&apos;s overall sense of &quot;resolved-ness&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=87806 href="#87806">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2010 3:30:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &quot;Sapphire&quot; was written for 20-EDO, &quot;Protagonism&quot; for 15-EDO, and &quot;Audiospark&quot; for 25-EDO Unfair.</p><p>Are these scales available somewhere?</p></div><h3><a id=87808 href="#87808">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2010 4:26:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cityoftheasleep&gt;&quot;For instance, 25-EDO Unfair hits 5/4 within a cent of Just, but the<br/>&gt; scale sounds like rubbish because the &quot;whole-tone&quot; is around a 13/12.
