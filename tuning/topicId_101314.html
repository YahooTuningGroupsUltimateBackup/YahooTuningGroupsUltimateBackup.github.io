This would give 11*5 = 55.  And 14/9 would become 9/7 (octave inverse)...which, again, would give 42.  Listening to these two...I think it&apos;s clear why they are both almost equally useful to use as alternatives to fifths.  Meanwhile 16/11 could be reduced to 11/8, which gives 88 as a dissonance level...and faithfully summarizes how it sounds edgier than 22/15 despite having a lower numerator and denominator (Igs warned me a long time ago how harsh 16/11 sounds vs. 22/15...despite how much Tenney Height may say otherwise).</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2011 2:50:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Aug 19, 2011 at 3:04 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;But to my ears, 8:10:12:15 is more consonant than 8:11:13:14, so I don&apos;t use odd-limit much.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A few things to consider<br/>&gt; 1) 8:11:13:14 has more odd harmonics, which lessens the chance of (typically stronger) even harmonics in a timbre matching</p><p>Why should even harmonics be stronger?
