It&apos;s a 31-limit scale, built out of a<br/>harmonic series fragment: 17-18-19-20-22-24-26-28-31/17 and a subharmonic series<br/>fragment:  17/17-31-16-15-14-13-11-10. I&apos;d guess that it has a tendency to be<br/>ambiguous about its origins, as the harmonic series is missing the one identity<br/>(32/17) and the subharmonic series is missing the three identity (17/12).</p></div><h3><a id=19978 href="#19978">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2001 9:55:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yep!

I was about to post a similar analysis. If we show only odd<br/>factors, the harmonic series subset looks like 3:5:7:9:11:13:17:19:31<br/>and the subharmonic series subset looks like 1/(31:17:15:13:11:7:5:1).<br/>Of course we can multiply any of those numbers by 2, 4, 8 etc since<br/>this is an octave repeating scale.</p><p>The large harmonic series subset gives ample opportunity for the 17 to<br/>be heard as justly intoned, unlike Pat and Dave&apos;s scale where the only<br/>harmonic series subsets containing 17 are 1:17, 3:17, 5:17, but the 17<br/>corresponds to a different note in each case. Note that I was wrong<br/>before when I said that there was only one 17-limit dyad in the scale.<br/>There are 3 (out of 66), but none of them extend even to triads.</p><p>Now whether a bare 8:17, 10:17, 12:17 or 16:17 can be heard as justly<br/>intoned, particularly when the lower note in all these is only 7 cents<br/>away from being the 5 in a 4:5:6, may be a matter of opinion. _My_<br/>opinion on this was of course delightfully rebutted by the description<br/>&quot;just the silliest SH*T I&apos;ve heard in ages&quot;. I just can&apos;t help but<br/>admire the author&apos;s tight logic and his appeal to empirically<br/>verifiable facts, not to mention his good humour. ;-)</p><p>There is a subharmonic series segment 1/(17:5:3:1) in Pat and Dave&apos;s<br/>scale, but my understanding is that a utonality doesn&apos;t provide any<br/>more context for justness to become audible, than do the dyads of<br/>which it is composed.</p><p>But there is an important point raised by both these scales that is<br/>_not_ a matter of opinion.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Merely looking at the ratios describing the notes in one particular<br/>mode of a scale can be _incredibly_ misleading about what kind of<br/>intervals are predominant.</p><p>A scale with N notes has N*(N-1)/2 intervals. So 12 notes means 66<br/>intervals, 16 notes means 120 intervals.</p><p>When the prime factors are few (say 4 or fewer), constructing a<br/>lattice is a good way of seeing most of the intervals of interest. But<br/>as a more general method, looking at every mode of the scale is<br/>guaranteed to show us every interval (in fact we get to see them<br/>twice, the second time inverted). Also, removing all factors of two<br/>from all numerators and denominators makes it easy to spot subsets of<br/>harmonic and subharmonic series. (If anyone wants to see the Excel<br/>spreadsheet just let me know).</p><p>If you look at the ratios for all intervals in Pat and Dave B&apos;s scale<br/>you will find only those 3 ratios of 17 (and their inversions).</p><p>If you look at Johnny&apos;s scale you will find 15 ratios of 17. But,<br/>perhaps surprisingly, this is the same or one less than the number of<br/>ratios of 5, or 7, or 11, 13, 31. There is slightly less 17-ness in<br/>that scale than there is 13-ness or 31-ness for example. What&apos;s<br/>special about 17 in that scale is the that it is the identity of the<br/>one note that is common to both the harmonic and subharmonic subsets.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Johnny, could you please expand on &quot;The limit in JI is based on the<br/>powerful resonance of the first 5 harmonics.&quot;</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=19997 href="#19997">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>3/9/2001 9:18:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 3/9/01 12:57:10 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU">D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; Johnny, could you please expand on &quot;The limit in JI is based on the<br/>&gt; powerful resonance of the first 5 harmonics.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>As theorists, y&apos;all are forcing a round peg into a square shape.

Performing<br/>accurately to the cent is doable when you hear done it right.  It is<br/>eminently repeatable.

Of<br/>course, that is due to it being used in a performed composition.  On the<br/>page, there is more room for interpretation.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
