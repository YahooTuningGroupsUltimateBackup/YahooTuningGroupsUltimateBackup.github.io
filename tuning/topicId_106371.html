It also tempers out the starling comma 126/125,<br/> so stacking three minor thirds 6/5 gives 12/7.</p><p> Possible generators for cuckoo are 2/1, 11/9, 6/5, or 2/1, 11/9, 5/4. One<br/> way to look at it would be 7-limit starling with generators 2/1, 3/2, 6/5,<br/> except that the 3/2 generator is split in two neutral thirds 11/9, extending<br/> it to the 11-limit.<br/> Another useful way to look at it would be as a variant of 11-limit mandos,<br/> but with a different mapping for 7.</p><p> Related linear temperaments include myna, migration, wollemia,<br/> worschmidt, cypress, hemisensi and monocerus.<br/> The respective temperament finder links are here:<br/> <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=7d_31_27e&limit=11">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=7d_31_27e&limit=11</a><br/> <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=38df_31_27e&limit=13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=38df_31_27e&limit=13</a></p><p> I gave it the name &quot;cuckoo&quot; because (a) a bird name would be appropriate<br/> for a starling temperament, and (b) the intervals 6/5, 11/9, 5/4 and 4/3,<br/> which are typical for a cuckoo, are within close reach of each other in this<br/> temperament.</p><p> The other two (linear) temperaments are named after two oracles from<br/> Epirus. The first one is an extension of 5-limit cypress:</p><p> Necromanteion<br/> Commas: 1029/1024, 5103/5000</p><p>POTE generator: ~48/35 = 541.779</p><p>Map: [&lt;1 7 10 1|, &lt;0 -12 -17 4|]<br/>EDOs: 11c, 20c, 31, 51c, 82c, 113c, 144c</p><p>11-limit<br/>Commas: 176/175, 243/242, 1029/1024</p><p>POTE generator: ~15/11 = 541.729</p><p>Map: [&lt;1 7 10 1 17|, &lt;0 -12 -17 4 -30|]<br/>EDOs: 31, 82c, 113c, 144c</p><p> 13-limit<br/>Commas: 144/143, 176/175, 243/242, 343/338</p><p>POTE generator: ~15/11 = 541.606</p><p>Map: [&lt;1 7 10 1 17 1|, &lt;0 -12 -17 4 -30 6|]<br/>EDOs: 31, 51ce, 82cf, 113cf, 144cf</p><p> This temperament is very closely related to 31-EDO, and I think there is<br/> no other important EDO that supports it using the patent val.<br/> Like oracle, it tempers out the gamelisma 1029/1024, meaning the fifth 3/2<br/> is split into three septimal wholetones 8/7. Unlike oracle, it uses 5103/5000<br/> (instead of 225/224) to split the 8/7 into two secor-like semitones 27/25.<br/> 27/25^2 * 7/8. This semitone plus an octave is further split into two intervals<br/> of 35/24 (or 22/15 in the 11-limit), the generator for this temperament.<br/> In the 11-limit, it tempers out the valinorsma 176/175, equating the generator<br/> 35/24 with 22/15 (or 48/35 with 15/11, if you prefer), and 35/32 with 11/10.<br/> It also tempers out the rastma 243/242, meaning 6 stacked generators<br/> make a neutral third 11/9.</p><p> Tempering out 176/175, 243/242 and 144/143, necromanteion is strongly<br/> related to mandos. It is identical to cypress in the 2.3.5.11-limit, and to<br/> miracle in the (contorted) 2.3.7.11-limit if unmapped intervals are ignored.</p><p> Since I already named a temperament &apos;oracle&apos;, which splits 8/7 into four<br/> approximate 540 cent steps and is related to miracle (or orwell) temperament,<br/> I thought I could use specific oracle names for similar temperaments, and<br/> choosing greek oracles somehow fits with the mediterranean theme of<br/> other similar temperaments like &apos;casablanca&apos; or &apos;cypress&apos;.<br/> &apos;Necromanteion&apos;, the &quot;Oracle of Death&quot; (or &quot;Oracle of the Dead&quot;) seemed<br/> to go well with the mandos theme. I also read that cypresses are related to<br/> the deceased; firstly, its &quot;noble&quot; wood seems to have been used for sarcophagi<br/> by egypts, and secondly, they were apparently typical for roman cemeteries<br/> or tombs.<br/> However, I didn&apos;t verify the credibility of these claims, which I found here:<br/> <a href="http://www.slowtuscany.it/tuscany/pisa/cypresses_1.htm">http://www.slowtuscany.it/tuscany/pisa/cypresses_1.htm</a></p><p> The second temperament which I decided to name after an oracle is simply<br/> 2.9.15.7.11-limit orwell, i.e. the subgroup orwell that results from doubling<br/> its generator:</p><p> Dodona<br/> Subgroup: 2.9.15.7.11<br/> Commas: 99/98, 121/120, 176/175<br/> Svalname: 11&amp;31 (?)</p><p> Generator: ~11/8</p><p> Map: [&lt;1 0 3 1 3|, &lt;0 7 2 4 1|]<br/> EDOs: 11, 22, 31, 42, 53, 84e</p><p> Dodona is an oracle where Zeus was worshipped, and this was the closest I<br/> got to zeus temperament while fulfilling the above criteria.<br/> (8/7 split into four ~540 cent intervals; related to miracle or orwell)<br/> In the 11-limit, orwell tempers out all intervals which zeus does, so dodona<br/> does the same in the 2.9.15.7.11-limit.</p><p> I&apos;m not too familiar with subgroup temperaments, so the &apos;Svalname&apos; might not<br/> be what I assume it is, and I don&apos;t know how to calculate a POT2 generator.<br/> Also, I don&apos;t know if the EDOs I listed for the temperaments are a good choice,<br/> I just listed some which I think are worth mentioning. And I still don&apos;t know how<br/> to calculate badness, so if those temperaments get approved, I&apos;d be glad if<br/> someone could calculate it for those (and for oracle). :)</p><p> Best<br/> - Geddy</p></div><h3><a id=106374 href="#106374">ðŸ”—</a>gedankenwelt94@...</h3><span>2/9/2014 12:07:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ok, Graham has put the data for cuckoo and necromanteion in the temperament finder<br/> database (many thanks!), and none complaint yet, so I assume there are no problems<br/> with those suggestions.<br/> If there should be any concerns about names or classification nonetheless, we can<br/> discuss them, and maybe find a better compromise.</p><p> Speaking of classification: Where should I put necromanteion? I see only three more<br/> or less reasonable options:</p><p> (1) Create a new page &quot;Rastmic Temperaments&quot; for linear temperaments that temper<br/>  out the rastma 243:242, and add cypress and necromanteion.<br/> (2) Create a new page &quot;Cypress Temperaments&quot; for linear temperaments that temper<br/>  out 258280326/244140625, and add cypress and necromanteion.<br/> (3) Keep cypress as a starling temperament, and add necromanteion to the gamelismic<br/>  clan.</p><p> #3 is possible, but I&apos;m not very fond of the idea. #2 looks to me like the most solid solution.<br/> #1 is interesting, but also a little unconventional, and I&apos;m not sure how well it would work.</p><p> I&apos;d love to get some feedback; if there&apos;s none I&apos;ll simply go for option #2.</p><p> - Geddy</p><p> P.S.: Here are the temperament finder links for necromanteion, seems I forgot them<br/> in my previous post: <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=31_51c&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=31_51c&limit=7</a><br/> <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=31_51ce&limit=11">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=31_51ce&limit=11</a></p><p> <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=31_51ce&limit=13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=31_51ce&limit=13</a></p></div>
