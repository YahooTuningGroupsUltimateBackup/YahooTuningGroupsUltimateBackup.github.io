Meditation is an aspect of<br/>Ritual Music making. One can hear this in its purest form in the<br/>music of India. I recall reading years ago, Ravi Shankar&apos;s &quot;My Music,<br/>My Life&quot;, where during some of the first performances he gave in the<br/>US, audiences actually wept at the beauty of the music. Wherever<br/>music making has this Ritual Function at work in the practices of the<br/>composers and performers, it can plainly be heard in the sound of the<br/>music, which speaks to the deepest part of soul. The music of India<br/>stands as the greatest model of this in my mind, and through<br/>microtonal music practice I hope to harness some portion of this<br/>beautiful essence.</p><p>&gt; About the kind of music that supports more formal meditation,<br/>drones,<br/>&gt; etc. later.</p><p>I will be eagerly awaiting every letter of what you have to say on<br/>this topic.</p><p>&gt; Regards, and happy music.meditation!</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
