This is what I&apos;ve just finished about half an hour ago. :-D Although the &quot;style&quot; may be changing during the piece, the temperament used is still the same overall the composition. I even don&apos;t think I have to tell you what the temperament is; towards the end, there are lots of &quot;model&quot; comma pumps played, which can spell it out quite nicely.<br/>Here&apos;s the link:<br/><a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/frygkc">www.sendspace.com/file/frygkc</a></p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2009 9:24:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&angst;Â™&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s the link:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/frygkc">www.sendspace.com/file/frygkc</a></p><p>A lot of great moments in there, as usual.

One of the open areas<br/>in regular temperament research is the classification of<br/>rank 2 temperaments above the 7-limit.  We&apos;ve never done a deep<br/>dive on it, partly because the relationships between temperaments<br/>gets tricky (e.g. which of the 8 meantone-like mappings should be<br/>called the 11-limit extension of meantone).  Anyway, music like<br/>this is good reason to continue the search.  I heard the 11-limit<br/>intervals and really thought they added to the piece, but could<br/>tell it was something like porcupine due to the 3rds-based<br/>movements.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2009 1:07:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl wrote:</p><p>&gt; (e.g. which of the 8 meantone-like mappings should be<br/>&gt; called the 11-limit extension of meantone)</p><p>I never knew about 8 possibilities, I only knew of four.

There&apos;s the question of notating<br/>&gt; it, though.</p><p>Well, I was just thinking about some &iuml;&iquest;&half;model versions&iuml;&iquest;&half; of comma pumps and this is the result. Similarly as a major triad in meantone can be viewed as generator numbers of &iuml;&iquest;&half;0 1 4&iuml;&iquest;&half; (i.e. 1 generator maps the prime 3 and 4 generators map the prime 5), a major triad in porcupine can be viewed as generator numbers of &iuml;&iquest;&half;0 3 5&iuml;&iquest;&half;. So in meantone I can happily make a comma pump by keeping adding or subtracting 1 from the generator numbers and modifiing one of them to use as few generators as possible in the entire chord progression (as long as at least one of them is preserved in consecutive chords). For example: I can do &iuml;&iquest;&half;0_1_4, 1_2_5, -1_2_3, -1_0_3, 0_1_4&iuml;&iquest;&half; (C G d F C, like in Abba&iuml;&iquest;&half;s &iuml;&iquest;&half;s.o.s.&iuml;&iquest;&half;) or &iuml;&iquest;&half;0_1_4, 0_3_4, -1_2_3, 1_2_5, 0_1_4&iuml;&iquest;&half; (C a d G C). Similarly, in porcupine, I can make a comma pump by adding or subtracting 2 (not 1 because none of the generator numbers in the triad are 1 step apart there). So for example, I can do it like &iuml;&iquest;&half;0_3_5, 0_2_5, -1_2_4, -1_1_4, -2_1_3, 0_3_5&iuml;&iquest;&half; (which is one of the progressions I&iuml;&iquest;&half;ve used there) or I can do &iuml;&iquest;&half;0_3_5, 1_3_6, 1_4_6, -1_2_4, 0_2_5, 0_3_5&iuml;&iquest;&half; (hey, I&iuml;&iquest;&half;m realizing I haven&iuml;&iquest;&half;t used this one, I&iuml;&iquest;&half;ll probably have to make another version some day :-D).</p><p>Petr</p></div>
