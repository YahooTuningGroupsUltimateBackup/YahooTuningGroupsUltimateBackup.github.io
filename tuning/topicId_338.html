This doesn&apos;t seem much more useful<br/>&gt;than the octave scales with the -64 +63 cent tuning.</p><p>Yup. Personally, I think it&apos;s quite sensible to limit sample-based<br/>&quot;synths&quot;,<br/>i.e. &quot;romplers&quot;, to 12-note tunings, and the +63/-64 system (XG &amp; GS)<br/>is neat. I find samples can begin to sound quite terrible if shifted too<br/>much<br/>from their original pitch. And many of these instrument have less perfect<br/>samples, the Yamaha XG devices cram the 128 GM sound set into 4MB !</p><p>But (!), there is a work around on XG and GS instruments (GS can hold<br/>individual tunings on individual channels, oui ?) :<br/>Simply use your keyboard&apos;s splitting function, assign each split region<br/>to a different channel, and work out the (rather fun) puzzle of<br/>tunings the tables to get different pitches in each keyboard &quot;octave&quot;.<br/>It works for many tunings.</p><p>&gt;I have also added tables of various microtonal scales (equal tempered, just<br/>&gt;intonation, well tempered, world ) to my web site with tuning values in<br/>&gt;cents, interval names, and deviations from closest just intervals.<br/>Hey, thanks fo these, John. Very handy. I was quite happy to stumble<br/>across<br/>them after accidentally clicking on my bookmark for your site.</p><p>- Drew</p></div><h3><a id=375 href="#375">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/1999 10:42:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Drew Skyfyre wrote:</p><p>&gt; I find samples can begin to sound quite terrible if shifted too much<br/>&gt; from their original pitch.</p><p>   I generally end up making different sounds for each tuning, but that&apos;s<br/>mostly because the ASR-10 makes it difficult to do otherwise.</p></div>
