Chris, I wrote<br/>you in August at <a href="http://foothillschapel.com">foothillschapel.com</a>, which was the last address<br/>John had for you at the time.</p><p>The most glaring feature of the Microzone is probably its .008&quot;<br/>key travel, coupled with polyphonic aftertouch (!).

I believe the keys are attached<br/>with adhesive, making them re-arrangeable.  Chris, can you<br/>confirm?  The tops come in black and white... are any other<br/>colors available?</p><p>One of Erv&apos;s design goals was easy glissando, which the short<br/>action travel certainly helps.</p><p>Also of interest was the MIDI mapping tool.  I know Starrlabs<br/>was working on Windows software to do this, with Kurzweil<br/>K25xx gear as the primary output device.  What are you playing<br/>through, Chris?  Did the software ever ship?  How do you control<br/>the midi configuration?</p><p>Dylan, I&apos;m sure we&apos;d all love to hear about your project, which<br/>has seen far less discussion here than the Microzone (check the<br/>archives).</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Dylan Horvath &#x3C;dhorvath@cortex-design.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2004 2:31:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul!</p><p> I don&apos;t have permission to share *too* much about the keyboard, but I<br/>can tell you things are moving fast now and we&apos;re eager to get a<br/>one-octave prototype into the hands of as many people as possible to<br/>give feedback for a full keyboard.

The key travel will be longer (~0.100&quot;) and smoother, the whole goal<br/>&gt; being to produce a more playable keyboard than the Microzone.</p><p>You were not exactly asking for more design input, and perhaps it is too<br/>late anyway, but I took this as an invitation anyway, so here goes...</p><p>One of the problems with MIDI keyboards for some expressive purposes is that<br/>MIDI does not track key position dynamically.  There is polyphonic<br/>aftertouch, which is rare enough, but I have heard it has the problem that<br/>it arpegiates--when a lot of keys are moving it is not possible for the MIDI<br/>banwidth to keep up with it all resulting in jumpy responses to individual<br/>key aftertouch changes.  I have never played a keyboard with poly<br/>aftertouch, but the problem is clear given MIDI bandwidth limitations.<br/>However, I don&apos;t think polyphonic aftertouch is quite equivalent to<br/>reporting key position dynamically, correct me if I&apos;m wrong.</p><p>So basically what I&apos;m hoping for is to finally have a keyboard that will<br/>report dynamic position of all keys smoothly, using an interface standard<br/>that is capable of the required bandwidth.  Perhaps MIDI over USB or mLan is<br/>cabable of this.  If it is necessary to report this as &quot;aftertouch&quot; it<br/>should be position sensitive to the full key range, not operating only in an<br/>extra-pressure-after-key-fully-pressed mode.  If aftertouch is limited to<br/>keys that are &quot;on&quot; (I don&apos;t know whether it is) then it would be important<br/>to be able to configure keys to be &quot;on&quot; immediately after the slightest<br/>movement downward.  I hope I managed to make that clear.</p><p>Gulbransen for example has an optical-based piano retrofit which measures<br/>key position dynamically, however it converts this to a sophisticated<br/>(presumably improved over the normal) measurement of key velocity.  People<br/>at CNMAT have retrofitted this Gulbransen interface so that it *does*<br/>transmit full key position information which is important for so many<br/>expressive uses.  They use their own custom ethernet-based interfaces for<br/>transmitting this information to the host computer.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Kurt Bigler</p></div><h3>Chris Mohr &#x3C;fromtherealmoftheshadow@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2004 7:00:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi George,</p><p>You may have dealt with this question before, but<br/>Johnny Reinhard  recently told me the keyboard you are<br/>designing has 55 notes to the octave.

We do the best we can with what we have, but it&apos;s<br/>nice to dream about these things.  However, even if you could have<br/>this keyboard of your dreams, I think that you would soon encounter<br/>frustration of another sort in that simultaneously pressing keys<br/>widely separated in the Y-direction would be rather difficult or<br/>clumsy, as would occur with the number of tones you&apos;re considering.<br/>That&apos;s another reason I recommend ~55 keys/octave as a maximum for<br/>the Bosanquet geometry.</p><p>If you wanted to map tones to 41 or 72, I think that the decimal<br/>keyboard (which uses the Miracle geometry) would be a better choice,<br/>but now that&apos;s a keyboard we can only dream about at present.</p><p>&gt; &gt; One of the great advantages of JI is that, since not all tones are<br/>&gt; &gt; created equal, some will be more useful than others.

Since<br/>certain tonalities might take you close to one or the other edges of<br/>the keyboard, and since there were not very many keys that played<br/>duplicate pitches (to allow homogeneous fingering patterns), I<br/>suggested that a foot switch be provided that would move the pitch<br/>down by 2 degrees, so that the pitches that were played by keys near<br/>the edges of the keyboard were relocated to keys much farther from<br/>the edges.  Another press of the switch restored the pitch 2 degrees<br/>back up.  The pitch programming for those ETs was hard-wired, but<br/>there it was also possible to program your own tunings (by means of<br/>banks of very small switches) that could be alternated using the foot<br/>switch.  So the suggestion I made to you is not new, but was actually<br/>implemented some 25 years ago.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2004 11:48:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 5/26/04 1:27 AM, Gene Ward Smith &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

This is of course anything but freedom, yet music<br/>has for a long time been working with limitations and limitations always<br/>teach something:  because in our desire for freedom we tend to neglect the<br/>power of what is available to us in our present limitation.

The 11 is there for the C<br/>root.  And the D:A is definitely pretty oddball.

With meta meantone and related tunings instead of 27/33/40 one<br/>ends up with taking the two other tones and using the mean interval which<br/>sounds even smoother. 54/67/80 evenly beating. The 40/27 is a great interval by<br/>itself and the persians use it to resolve to a 4/3.
