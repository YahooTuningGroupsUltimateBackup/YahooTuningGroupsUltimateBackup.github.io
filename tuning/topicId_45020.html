Then open the file with RealPlayers,Windows Media Player, or something similar. It shouldthen sound very clean. I&apos;m sure you can do somethingsimilar from Macintosh or other computers.NOTE: Don&apos;t try to download more than 5 or 6 excerptsat a time, or Yahoo/Geocities will balk. And sorry forthe ads. As you might guess, these free sites are avery<br/> cost-effective way to present my music, but dohave their limitations.--------------------My apologies if you get this message more than once.Also, let me know if you&apos;d rather not receiveinfrequent updates about the music of Harold Fortuin,mainly about updates on the web, recordings, andconcerts.Yours for a more creative musical future,Harold</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>SBC Yahoo!
