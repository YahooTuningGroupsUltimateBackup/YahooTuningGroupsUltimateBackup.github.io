&gt; is to express that, as i see it, equal temperaments<br/>&gt; &gt; are quite sophisticated, quite the opposite of &quot;crude&quot; . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Isn&apos;t it true that even with our &quot;overworn&quot; 12-tET,<br/>&gt; that musicians and mathematicians didn&apos;t even have the<br/>&gt; tools to mathematically create this ET until comparatively<br/>&gt; *late* in the overall historical development of tuning???<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Well, I guess the Chinese did it early, but they came<br/>&gt; upon it in a different way, yes??)</p><p>the idea of 12-tone equal-temperament has surely been<br/>around ever since the first time someone discovered the<br/>so-called &quot;Pythagorean comma&quot;.  &quot;tuning by concords&quot;<br/>(i.e., by successive &quot;4ths&quot; and &quot;5ths&quot;) was known to<br/>the Babylonians and is documented in the famous &quot;tuning<br/>tablet&quot; known as CBS 10996.  see my webpage about the<br/>reconstruction of the Hurrian hymn:<br/><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/babylonian/hurrian/monzh6.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/babylonian/hurrian/monzh6.htm</a></p><p>anyone who tunes a 13-tone scale according to this method<br/>will notice right away that the 13th note is extremely close<br/>(~23.5 cents higher, the &quot;Pythagorean comma&quot;) to the starting<br/>note, and it would be a natural thing for this person to<br/>consider the possibility of tempering all 12 notes of the<br/>scale to eliminate this small &quot;anomaly&quot; and close the system.</p><p>while it&apos;s true that so far the only positive documentation<br/>we have shows that the Europeans, and the Chinese only<br/>slightly before them, discovered how to calculate absolutely<br/>true 12edo, as 2^(12/12), in the early 1600s, we do know<br/>from some Babylonian tablets (the most famous one is<br/>YBC 7289) that the Babylonians knew how to find arbitrarily<br/>close approximations to 2^(1/2) (i.e., the square-root of 2).</p><p>this is the essential problem in calculating 12edo, as<br/>one only needs to be able to calculate the square-root<br/>of the square-root of the cube-root to find the semitone,<br/>because 2*2*3 = 12.  and that can indeed all be done<br/>by hand, if one knows the procedure.</p><p>so while the Europeans and Chinese only rediscovered<br/>the mathematics of roots and exponents in the late 1500s,<br/>we know that the Babylonians were familiar with them<br/>back around 1600 BC.  and as i show in my webpages,<br/>the Babylonians used certain Sumerian words as &quot;logograms&quot;,<br/>much as we use the &quot;Arabic&quot; numerals as symbols representing<br/>our words &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;, etc., and that if one<br/>strips out all the Babylonian words, one finds that the<br/>essentials of the math problems are still there, entirely<br/>in Sumerian.</p><p>the only conclusion that can be reached from this is that<br/>the Sumerians were aware of the mathematical procedures<br/>which exist today in the Babylonian math problems, and<br/>that this knowledge must therefore date from the height<br/>of Sumerian civilization c. 2500 - 2000 BC.  see the<br/>section of my &quot;Speculations on Sumerian Tuning&quot; where<br/>i detail how Sumerian base-60 mathematics could give an<br/>extraordinarily close approximation to 12edo with rather<br/>simple (albeit tedious) calculations:<br/><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/sumerian/sumeriantuning.htm#12edo">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/sumerian/sumeriantuning.htm#12edo</a></p><p>-monz<br/>&quot;all roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2002 6:03:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
