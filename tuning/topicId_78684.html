Pastor passed down sentences for second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, respectively, on Michael Sheridan and his wife, Angela, for the 2007 Mother&apos;s Day slaying of musician Rod Poole. Pool, 45, had confronted the pair after Angela Sheridan, then 24, bumped a busboy as she maneuvered her car in the Hollywood parking lot of Mel&iuml;&iquest;&half;s Diner. Within moments of exchanging words with Ms. Sheridan, Poole was on the ground while she kicked his head and her husband, then 25, stabbed him half a dozen times. (See June 14, 2007 L.A. Weekly feature.) Michael&iuml;&iquest;&half;s mother and his two-year-old son remained in the car.</p><p>Pastor threw the proverbial book at Michael Sheridan, giving him an indeterminate sentence of 15 years to life in state prison, and for good measure tossed on three years for a probation violation; the sentences will run consecutively but will, said his attorney, Alba Marrero, be appealed. Angela received a &iuml;&iquest;&half;mid-base term&iuml;&iquest;&half; of three years; however, with 771 days of custody credits, she will be free in less than a year. She and her attorney, Jana Seng, seemed satisfied, although the prevailing mood in a courtroom filled with supporters of victims and perpetrators alike was gloom.</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;What sane person,&iuml;&iquest;&half; Poole&iuml;&iquest;&half;s widow, Lisa, asked the court, &iuml;&iquest;&half;carries a knife in their car on Mother&iuml;&iquest;&half;s Day, with their child and their mother in the car?&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>Judge Proctor had no answer, other than to say that Mr. Sheridan&iuml;&iquest;&half;s &iuml;&iquest;&half;conduct is egregious beyond words. It&iuml;&iquest;&half;s cowardly and presents a danger to society.&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/trials/mels-slay-suspects-sentenced/">http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/trials/mels-slay-suspects-sentenced/</a>&gt;</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=78686 href="#78686">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/2008 8:58:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Killer of guitarist Rod Poole sentenced<br/>Oct. 8, 2008 at 10:48 AM</p><p>LOS ANGELES, Oct. 8 (UPI) -- The wife of guitarist Roderick Poole called her husband a champion of the underdog during the Los Angeles sentencing of his killer.</p><p>Michael Sheridan was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the May 2007 stabbing death of Poole during a dispute that began when Poole yelled at Sheridan after he and his wife nearly ran over another man in the parking lot of a Hollywood diner.</p><p>The Los Angeles Times said Wednesday that Lisa Ladaw told the courtroom that Poole hadn&apos;t been looking for trouble when they went to Mel&apos;s Drive-in to celebrate Mother&apos;s Day but shouted at Sheridan after he bumped into a restaurant employee in the lot.</p><p>Sheridan was convicted of stabbing Poole six times with a steak knife and then speeding away with his wife behind the wheel and young son sitting in the back seat.</p><p>&quot;He would speak for the underdog, he would speak for people who needed to be defended,&quot; Ladaw said of Poole.</p><p>The Times described the British-born Poole as a fixture in the Los Angeles experimental music scene who had been focused on composing in recent years.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/10/08/Killer_of_guitarist_Rod_Poole_sentenced/UPI-29151223477296/">http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/10/08/Killer_of_guitarist_Rod_Poole_sentenced/UPI-29151223477296/</a>&gt;</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=78687 href="#78687">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/2008 9:30:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Beardsley &lt;db@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mel&apos;s Slay Suspects Sentenced<br/>&gt; by Steven Mikulan<br/>&gt; October 7, 2008 1:21 PM</p><p>Thanks for the update, David.  -Carl</p></div><h3><a id=78688 href="#78688">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/9/2008 12:51:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A very important artist of intonation was taken from us.
