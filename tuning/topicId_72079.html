Use one pitch for velocities 0-63 and the other for velocities 64-127. The loudness for the sounds is, of course, the same, and the velocity tracking envelope is not a ramp, but &quot;square&quot;: &#x304;&#x304;&macr;&macr;&macr;&macr;&#x2CD;&#x2CD;&#x2CD;&#x2CD;. If more modern synths have something like &#x2CD;&#x2CD;&#x2CD;---&macr;&macr;&macr;, more than two pitches are possible.</p><p>Playing with expression like a pianist does is out of the question, but modulating wind or (bowed) stringlike sounds with the pitch wheel and aftertouch was OK for my humble needs.</p><p>klaus</p></div>
