After all, the ratios b/w string lengths and frequencies<br/>are the same i.e. to halve string is to halve period but double freq.<br/>Both are 1:2.</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=82000 href="#82000">ðŸ”—</a>martinsj013 &#x3C;martinsj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2009 9:57:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;traktus5&quot; &lt;kj4321@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hi group.
