I have had an off-list conversation with<br/>him since.  I doubt he would really want to stop the process at this<br/>point.  He really doesn&apos;t want to participate on the list right now,<br/>and has many other composing projects that are taking precedence...</p><p>So, I believe, Paul, that if people know for certain that you have<br/>decided to do the assembling and are willing to do it, they will<br/>start sending FAQ entries to you!  Yes, no, too busy??  Whatever.</p><p>Frankly, I am quite warming up to the idea of the FAQ, since I have<br/>noticed that I ALREADY have learned some stuff, and have noticed that<br/>others have remarked similarly...</p><p>It&apos;s especially good in areas where there is SOME knowledge, and<br/>maybe a &quot;blind spot&quot; here or there.  Many of us have these, of<br/>course, more the novitiates, of which I still must number one, than<br/>some of the xenharmonic &quot;old timers...&quot;</p><p>Anyway, a second point is the fact that I believe the FAQ entries<br/>should be fully discussed on the list.  Even if it is about simple<br/>stuff... sometimes in the distilling of the so-called &quot;simple&quot;<br/>EVERYBODY learns something.  Am I right on that, or do I have<br/>dissenters in that view?</p><p>I believe a full discussion of these terms would be a very valuable<br/>thing to do on this list, and we could all benefit.</p><p>Do others agree... yes, no, maybe, fugeddaboutdid...(??)</p><p>Either we should do this full discussion with Paul as editor, or we<br/>should just completely drop the FAQ idea and get on to other<br/>matters....</p><p>_________ ______ _____ _____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p><p>The above is only theory, and quite possibly could be wrong.  As<br/>Richard Nixon once said, &quot;This would be wrong...&quot;</p></div><h3>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>2/28/2001 12:41:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; Ummm... just curious.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul, did you decide that you are accepting the FAQ proposals as<br/>&gt; &quot;editor??&quot;  I know you are very busy with, apparently, a new<br/>project<br/>&gt; right now... so it wasn&apos;t really clear if you had accepted (mostly<br/>by<br/>&gt; default, since it was YOUR idea and everybody else said no) the<br/>&gt; position of &quot;FAQ Editor...&quot;</p><p>I can&apos;t do it.
