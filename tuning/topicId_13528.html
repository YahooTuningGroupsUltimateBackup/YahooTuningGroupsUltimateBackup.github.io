It&apos;s<br/>called &quot;Tonal Pitch Space&quot;  (I believe) and will be out soon, if not<br/>already.   It contains theories of &quot;chord distance algorithms&quot; and so on<br/>for tonal music.   Although some find his theories to be problematically<br/>arbitrary, nonetheless, there are at the very least some very good ideas<br/>floating around in there.</p><p>His other book, &quot;Generative Theory of Tonal Music&quot; written with Ray<br/>Jackendoff, is also something of a classic and attempts to apply Chomsky<br/>lingual theories to tonal music.</p><p>Sadly, both of these texts are solidly 12t-ET based.</p><p>But that&apos;s nothing we all can&apos;t fix in due time. . . . . . .</p><p>Your application of &quot;distance&quot; ideas to maqams he&apos;d probably find very<br/>interesting;  write me off-list and I&apos;ll pass you his e-mail.</p><p>&gt; Can Akkoc wrote:<br/>&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I have been grappling with the problem of defining a metric for<br/>&gt;characterizing the musical &apos;distance&apos; between two maqams. Musicians<br/>&gt;constantly refer to different maqams being &apos;close&apos; or &apos;distant&apos; in<br/>&gt;their dialogues.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I was wondering whether there is a well established metric defined in<br/>&gt;western music for the musical/harmonic &apos;distance&apos; between two chords.<br/>&gt;If I am talking nonsense, please ignore this post with my apologies.<br/>&gt;If not, I would be interested in references in the literature.</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div>
