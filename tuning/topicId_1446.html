What I found was Brian McLaren<br/>making a personal attack on me on the digest.</p><p>So I don&apos;t have any problem with discussing BM here.</p><p>&gt;Personally, I miss his posts.</p><p>Personally, he&apos;s just another hostile net kook - very<br/>opinionated and ready to insult anyone who stands in his way.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/1999 1:40:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In fact, McLaren was never here.</p><p>Whatever McLaren might have had to say -- and Paul Erlich is right on in<br/>calling him to task for the flood of errors in his missives; I would have<br/>also added his entirely unprovoked and arbitrary attacks on people who<br/>happened not to fall into his good graces -- the main point is that McLaren<br/>just threw stuff at the list without ever condescending to become a member<br/>of it. That created a lot of ill will and that&apos;s a shame because the guy<br/>might have had something to say.</p><p>It could be he picked this up from Ivor Darreg, whom one could visit for<br/>hours without ever having to say a word -- which wouldn&apos;t have been<br/>listened to anyway -- as he went on expository autopilot. But Darreg,<br/>unlike McLaren, had lived the kind of life that somehow excused all of<br/>that, and my regret that Darreg was not able to express himself in a way<br/>that would reach a wider public remains great.</p><p>I&apos;m pleased to hear that McLaren is planning his own web site. Since he is<br/>not interested in exchanging ideas or receiving criticism, it&apos;ll be a more<br/>appropriate forum than an open list.</p></div>
